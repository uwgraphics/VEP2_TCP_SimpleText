TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, HENRY LORD RICH BAron Kensington of Kensington, Earl
of Holland, Captain of his Majesty's Guard, and Gentleman of the Bedchamber,
Justice in Air of all his Majesty's Forests, Chases and Parkes, on this side
Trent; Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, Knight of the most Noble
Order of the Garter: And one of his Maties most Honorable Privy Counsel.
RIGHT HONORABLE,
BEing importuned by many to publish these my elucubrations upon the Epistle to
the Hebrews; J could think of none so fit as your Honor, being truly
honorable both (...), for your virtue, and for the dignity of your place,
whereunto God has advanced you. It is said of Chrysippus, that he wrote much;
yet (...), dedicated them to no potent men, but contented himself (...), only
with an old woman, that saw his writings: In that he was injurious to
posterity; For bonum est sui diffusivum, for the good of others. And the
Writers of all ages had need to fly to the Patronage of great men, as to a
kind of Sanctuary. You are Chancellor of the University of Cambridge: Of the
which that may be verified, which is spoken of the Academie of Alexandria, that
it was (...), a shop of all good learning, wherein your Honor, together with
your noble brother was trained up: And in that College, whereof my self was
once a fellow of the Foundation. But (...) is best, when we speak or write to
them that are encumbred with many weighty affairs. I trust it shall not
repent you to steal as it were, some hours from them to the perusing of this
worthy Epistle; it being as a Crystal glass wherein we may behold the
natures of our Savior Christ, his Offices, Kingdom, Priesthood, and
Prophecy, as likewise the hand that apprehends and applies him to us, which
is faith, as also hope and charity, the necessary fruits and effects of faith.

Thus J humbly take my leave, commending your Lordship to the High and Eternal
God.

From East Bergholt in Suffolk. Your Honors in all humble service, WILLIAM
JONES.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, Sir THOMAS IERMYN, Vice-chamberlaine, and one of his
Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council.
RIGHT HONORABLE,
YOur wits, endowments, together with other natural parts suitable unto them I
have always admired: but especially since your coming to the University
being then most conspicuous. To testify my dutiful respect to you, and your
virtuous Lady, having interpreted the two short Epistles of St. John, and that
of Saint Paul to Philemon: I thought good to dedicate them to you and her, for
you resemble the man, and she the woman, to whom Saint John writes: And that
to Philemon being (...), as the word imports, does most fitly agree to you.
Zeno asked of the Oracle, how he might live best, Answer was made him, (...):
if he were of the same color with the dead: Upon that he fell a reading of the
Ancients: And in the interpretation of these Epistles, I have followed (as you
shall see) the judgment of the Ancients. Thus I humbly take my leave,
commending your honor to the Almighty.

From East Bergholt in Suffolk. Your Honors in all humble service, WILLIAM
JONES.

TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.
THe whole Scripture, says Saint Paul, 2 Timothy 3.16.
is given by inspiration from GOD, and is profitable to teach, to reprove, to
correct, to instruct and comfort, that even the man of GOD Himself may be
perfect to every good work. And they that labor in the elucidation of the
Scriptures, bring no small commodity to the Church of GOD; yea, though their
labors be but mean. And for mine own part, I rank my self among the
meanest, as that worthy Father said of himself, minimorum minimus* and as
Ignatius, dejecting himself lower, Tertullian. ad Trallianos.
non sum dignus dici minimus. For this cause, at the importunity of many I have
published these my poor Commentaries upon some Epistles; which in very truth
are no other then my ordinary Sermons whiles I was able to Preach. It cannot
be denied, but that a great number have done the like, whereof as Saint
Augustine speaks: De Doctrine. Christ. lib. 2.
Graeci numerari possunt, Latini non possunt, yet not very many English men. If
these may give satisfaction, I shall be encouraged to proceed to other portions
of Scripture. In these, according to Saint Augustines admonition, I thought it
most meet recurrere ad fontes, to have recourse to those sacred tongues
wherein the Scriptures were written, unfolding the nature of the Original
words. It is a true saying, bonus textuarius bonus theologus; I have always
endeavored to make the Text clear. If there be weaknesses in these my
labors (as undoubtedly there be many) I am the more to be borne withal,
because it is well known I may truly take up that complaint of Nazianzen, that
my body is (...), spent with sickness, age and labor. Orat. In presentia 170.
Epise.
But I entreat thee (Gentle Reader) to take in good part these my
elucubrations, commending thee heartily to the Lord.

Thine in the LORD WILLIAM JONES.

Waver: we must not waver in our profession. 409 Way: how Christ is the way, the
Living way. 405 Weakness: it is twofold. 528 Whoremongers: God will Judge,
and that many ways. 613 Will: Gods will, how revealed, when, and by whom. 52,
53. he accepts the Will for the Deed. 475 Women: Origens invective against
them. 662. S. Paul's and S. John's praise of them. 663 Word: that Gods Word is
never without fruit, 141. we must take heed of Contemning the Word 179. the
Word is a Lively Word ibid. Mighty and Powerful. 180. This power of the Word
is set forth, 1 Comparatively, 2 Simply, 180, 181. It is lively, 1, In the good
2, In the bad, 181, this should gain our Reverence to it, 182, 183, this
before all other writings is to be propounded to the people by the preacher,
183 the Word is a heart searcher 184. the Word is a Touchstone 205, the Word
compared to Rain 220, the want of the Word miserable, ibi. we should be
therefore thankful. ibid World: It is of Gods making and therefore to be
esteemed, 57, what is meant by the World to come, 87, 88, In this world there
is nothing but changing, 278. whatsoever is worldly, we must not be too much
in love with it, 328, 329, It is not eternal, 371, the world is not the Saints
Country. 469, we are out of this world, two ways, 625 Works: why called dead
works, 207, Not meritorious, 227, 230, their proper end, 228, one special good
work is to minister to the necessities of the Saints, ib. our good works shall
not be forgotten, 229. our best works are defiled with some sin, 252, 253.
sins called dead works, 356. dead things and dead works compared, 357.
sins well so called. 357 358, the works of the unregenerate please not God,
444. the praise of good Works, 628 the next way to be famous, is to be full of
good Works, 692, examples. 693

FINIS.
A COMMENTARY UPON THE EPISTLE OF St. Paul to PHILEMON.
THis Epistle has been questioned, as well as others, yea, above others.
There were some in St. Chrysostomes, St. Ambrose and Saint Hieromes time, that
would have it to be quite wiped out of the sacred Canon; two motives induced
them to it: the brevitie of it for the manner; the levitie of it for the matter.

A short thing, not worth the reading: then away with the LORDS prayer: with
some of the small Prophets, Abdie, Nabum, Sephonie. Who art thou that despisest
the day of small things? Zach. 4.10. There was a little City, and a wise poor
man in it. So here is a little Epistle: and a wise poor man in it, Eccles.
9.14.
namely Onesimus, whom God made rich in faith, and in the graces of the spirit.
Our little Sister, says the Church, must not be contemned; He that made the
Camel and the Elephant, Cant. 8.8.
made the Ant and the Be too: The same God is Author of little Epistles, as
well as of great, they be all (...), inspired from above by God: God made Pella
as well as Jerusalem. Lot said of Zoar, is it not a little one? Let my soul
fly thither and live: this Epistle is but a little one, yet fly hither and your
soul shall live; Ye shall find much heavenly food in it: the shorter the way
is, the sooner it may be gone: the shorter the Epistle is, the sooner it may be
read: therefore read it to the comfort and instruction of you all.

The second thing that displeased them, was the levitie of it, for the matter
of the Epistle: trifling things are handled in it.

1. It was written (...), for one man: that good Shepherd left 99. sheep in
the Wilderness and sought up one. Luke 15.4.
One soul is to be saved, Iac. 1.20.
being more worth than a world. One man is Gods Image, and our brother:
therefore not to be neglected.

2. For a base man. 1. A servant, CHRIST took on him the form of a servant.
Philip. 2.7. Gal. 3.20.
In saeculo there is great difference between a Master and a servant; In
Christo equal. CHRIST died for servants as well as for masters. Saul sought
his fathers Asses: and should not Saint Paul seek up Gods servant? 2. A
fugitive: the prodigal son was a fugitive, yet his father embraced him.
Saint Paul reduced him a fuga, from his flight, and caused him to fly to
Christ with the wing of faith, he lost his earthly master and found an heavenly
master, as Saul seeking Asses lighted on a kingdom.

3. A thief, he stole from his Master, I but he did not continue a thief.
Saint Paul was a blasphemer and a persecutour, the good thief was with CHRIST
in Paradise: the young man which Saint John commended to the Bishop became a
thief, a master thief: yet Saint John went to him in his own person, and
reduced him to CHRIST again: this thief became a good Spiritual thief, one
of those that did rapere regnum Caelorum: therefore this History is worth the
reading.

2 Timothy 4.13. Luke 9.52.
2. There be (...) in it, matters of small importance: as Verse 22. he is
sollicitous for his lodging: so he is for his cloak: and Christ sent
messengers to provide a lodging for him, therefore away with the Gospel of St.
Luke, and the 2. to Timothy.

In this Epistle is to be considered. 1. The gate or entrance into

His name is Paul, his Hebrew name was Saul: he was an Hebrew of the Tribe of
Benjamin. King Saul and he were of one Tribe.

Paul is a little name: and being the Apostle of the Gentiles he takes most
delight in that. Saint Hierome supposes he took this name of Sergius Paulus
the proconsull, Act. 13.
tanquam a primo ecclesiae spolio, as of the first spoil among the Gentiles,
which he took out of the Devils mouth: as Scipio was called Africanus of
Africa, which he subdued, and Metellus Creticus, Creete which he conquered: so
he was called Paul of Sergius Paulus, whom he converted.

There may be some probability of it, but Saint Augustins interpretation is
rather to be embraced. Sermon 42. de Ver. Apost.
Paulus. i. e. modicus, pusillus: de Saulo Paulus, de superbo modicus immo
minimus, as he interprets his own name, minimus apostolorum, 1 Cor. l5.9. It
is nomen humilitatis a name of humility; in that we must all be Paul's, having
a base and lowly opinion of our selves.

In the next place he is described by his masters badge or livery: not the
Apostle of Jesus Christ, but the prisoner of Jesus Christ, which is greater
(...), there can be no greater thing to glory of than this. Chrysostom.
Some may be the Apostles of JESUS CHRIST, as Judas was, yet not the prisoner
of Jesus Christ: the Apostles themselves gloried in this, Act. 5.41.
that they were counted worthy to suffer for the name of Christ.

He uses this title to mollify the heart of Philemon, and to make it more
inclinable to his suit for Onesimus: he must needs have an heart of iron, that
denies the request of a poor prisoner, and the prisoner of Jesus Christ.

There be vincti diaboli, and vincti Jesus Christi. Zedekiah was a prisoner,
bound in chains by the King of Babel. He was imprisoned for rebellion, not for
religion; Barabbas was a famous prisoner, as we say famosum scortum. He was
against Christ, not for Christ. The good thief on the Cross was a prisoner,
yet not for Christ, but for his own evil deeds; we receive worthy of that we
have done; Luke 23.41.
though Christ in mercy had compassion on him.

The Jesuits have always boasted of their bonds, imprisonment and martyrdom,
as they did in Wisbich Castle, in Fremingam Castle, and in other places they
were vincti Papae, non Christi: The Popes, not Christ's prisoners. All Queen
Elizabeth's days, all KING James his days, all King CHARLES his days never
any was imprisoned or put to death simply for Religion; if they could have
kept their fingers out of treason, they might have kept their necks out of the
halter. I would they would listen to that of Cyprian, ardeant licet flammis, De
simpl. praelat.
what though they give their bodies to be burnt, though they be cast to Wild
beasts, non erit illa fidei Corona, sed paena perfidiae; non religiosae
virtutis exitus gloriosus, sed desperationis interitus; that is, not the Crown
of Faith, but the punishment of perfidiousnesse; not the glorious end of
religious virtue, but the miserable destruction of desperation.

The Donatists complained of their persecution: Contr. lit. Petil. lib. 2. cap.
19. Cont. 2. Gaudentij Epist. lib. 2. c. 12.
as the Brownists and Sectaries do amongst us: but as Saint Augustine told
them, ye suffer, non propter Christum, sed contra Christum: persecutionem
patimini, non a nobis, sed a factis vestris. CHRIST was whipped, that was
persecution: CHRIST whipped some out of the Temple, that was no persecution.
Sarah beat Hagar: and the Apostle calls that no persecution. Ismael mocked
Isaac, and that he calls a persecution. Quid laudas paenam, at non ostendis
causam? Super gestis cum Emerito Donat.
Let no man suffer as a thief, as a murderer, as a busy body in another
man's matters (it seems there was a rout of them then: 1 Pet. 4.15.16.
but now a rabble of them) but if any suffer as a Christian, let him not be
ashamed, but glorify God on that behalf. It is a glorious thing to be
CHRIST'S prisoner, and to say with St. Paul, for the hope of Israel am I bound
with this chain.

The second person saluting is annexed to him, Acts 16.1.
which is Timothy. His mother was a Iewesse and a believer: his father a
Grecian. Eunice his mother had brought him up in the holy Scriptures from a
child; 2 Timothy 3.
him he styles his brother: when he writes to him, he calls him his Son:
because he writes with him, he honors him with the title of brother. Cajet.
Vt hoc negotium utriusque nomine authoretur, that his request being commenced
in the name of them both, might be armed with greater authority.

He was his brother; not only in the faith in general, but in the Ministry
in special.

Matthew. 23.8. 1 Cor. 1.1.
One is your Doctor, which is CHRIST: and all ye are brethren. Sosthenes our
brother. Saint Peter, whom the Papists will have to be head of the Church, and
LORD over all the Apostles, calls Saint Paul his brother, 2 Pet. 3.15.
though he came Postliminio after him. It is said of our blessed Savior, he
is not ashamed to call us brethren, Hebr. 2.11.
and shall we be ashamed to call one another brethren? All the faithful are
brethren: we have one father and mother too; but after a more special manner,
in an honorable office, are the Ministers brethren. Some are in higher places,
as the reverend Bishops: some in lower, as the inferior Ministers, yet all
brethren; the Mayor and Aldermen are brethren, the Judges and Sergeants are
brethren. Bishops are to be honored as Fathers: inferior Ministers to be
esteemed of, as brethren.

De dignitate sacerd. c. 1. Bern. In epi. dom. ser. 2.
Meis conservis loquor tanquam obediens servus, says Saint Ambrose. Quanto
sublimitas notior, tanto humilitas pretiosior: The higher the place, the more
precious is the humility of the Person. I have known diverse Bishops, that
have used their inferior brethren, with greater humanity, humility, and
courtesy, then many arrogant Schismatic preachers would use their
superiors. Brethren should not be so Lord-like one over another; that was a
fault in S. Chrysostom. (...). he was too supercilious. Socr. lib. b. c. 4


Brethren love, accord, support one another.

1. Accidentally they may hate, as Cain hated Abel, Esau Jacob, that is
unnatural; naturally they love one another; so should we: if the people must
have us above all abundance in love for our works sake; 1 These. 5.12.
then we that be the workmen, must abound in love one toward another, else we
are hinderers of the work.

2. Brethren accord: sometimes there is discord among them, nay, rara est
concordia fratrum, brethren seldom agree, that is the Devils policy, and
our corruption, nature conjoynes them together. So it should be with us in the
ministry; CHRIST sent his Disciples two and two, not one by one: we should
not sever our selves one from another, but be linked together one with another.
We should be like the Muses, (...) quasi (...). So (...) quasi (...), because
they should be together, as in place, so in affection: all Ministers are
tanquam chordae in Cythara Colligatae, as strings in a Lute tied together and
sounding together; Ignat. ad Ephesians.
that will make a sweet harmony. Oh that all the Ministers in England did
accord together in points of doctrine, and in rites and ceremonies!

3. Brethren support one another: we should not be underminers, but
underproppers one of another: frater a fratre adjutus est, (...). So it is in
the 70. A brother helped of a brother, Prove. 18.19.
is as a strong and high City; we should support the good name, and the goods
one of another, brethren must not be like the scoales in a balance, one up and
another down: we must not go about to pull down one another in our Sermons,
but to set up one another. It is the manner of some laborers, almost in every
Sermon to declame against ministers, because they know it to be a plausible
theme to the people, whose servants they are; as one told Demosthenes, being
(...), men-pleasers, rather then God-pleasers.

The persons saluted. 1. The house-holders. 2. The household. The
house-holders, the man and the woman; the man is described ex nomine, ex amore,
ex labor.

1. By his name, his name was PHILEMON. Saint Hierom de nominibus hebraicis,
deriveth it from the Hebrew mire donatus: wonderfully gifted, of Spalal
mirabile, and Nathan donatus. Indeed his gifts were admirable; or phi-lechem,
os panis little, the mouth of their bread. But why may it not be a Greek name?
He especially being a Grecian of Colosse, Col. 4.12. PHILEMON quasi (...) Our
friend Gaius was the Churches host, he the Churches friend: in the same kind
too, all that professed the name of CHRIST, were welcome to him: he was a
friendly entertainer of them all.

2. He is set forth by love; not active, but passive. (...) that our dearly
beloved, above others, our especial friend, not (...), but (...); they may be
dilecti, that deserve no love; as our enemies: they be (...) which deserve love
in respect of the rare qualities and excellent virtues, wherewith they be
adorned, as PHILEMON was. Some say, he was Nobilis, a noble man: surely he was
Dives, a rich man, in faith and in good works too; that was a load stone to
draw love unto him.

Last of all, he is described ex labor, by his labor: fellow laborer, not
in the harvest of the ministry; pray you the Lord of the harvest to send forth
laborers into his harvest; but in the general harvest of Christianity. Fuit
cooperarius Evangelij, non praedicatione, Cajet.
sed facto, he was a fellow laborer in the Gospel, not by preaching, but by
doing; non praedicando, sed praedicatores reciplendo, not by preaching, but by
receiving the preachers. Gorr.
Carthusian enlarges it further: non fuit praedicator, sed fidelium
sustentator, he was not a preacher, but the sustainer and nourisher of the
faithful. Fuit magnus quidem Christianus, a Christian of great note.

They that put to their helping hand any kind of way, Aquin.
for the furtherance of the Gospel, are the Ministers fellow laborers, that
edify their brethren in the most holy faith, that exhort one another while it
is called to day, that comfort one another, that are as bells to toll others to
Christ, are the Preachers fellow laborers. So was the Woman of Samaria that
called the whole City to Christ, John 4.
those women that ministered to Christ of their own substance. Priscilla and
Aquila tent-makers, Luke 8. Act. 18.26.
which expounded to Apollos the way of GOD more perfectly. Let us all thus be
fellow laborers, and our labor shall not be in vain in the Lord.

John 12.26. Where I am, there also shall my Minister be, (...): this is not to
be understood tantummodo de Episcopis and clericis, only of Bishops and Clerks,
Aug. in Ioh. Tract. 51.
teach, exhort, and with sobriety Catechize thy family, and quodam modo
episcopale implebis officium: and thou shall perform in a sort the office of a
Bishop.

V. 2.
From the man he proceeds to the Woman; Apphiah of (Aph) and Parah) amplius
fructificare: She was fruitful daily more and more, a fit name for a woman;
she must not be a barren Rachel, but a fruitful Leah, abounding in the fruits
of righteousness by JESUS CHRIST daily more and more, this made her to be
beloved of Saint Paul too.

Illyr.
Forte fuit uxor Philemonis.

Beza.
It is probable she was his Wife.

Chrysostom.
(...). It seems to me (and without a peradventure,) that she was his Wife;
then a famous couple. I would to God all married folks were like to them.

So much of the house-holders; now to the household, wherein some were Majores,
some Minores, greater, lesser; the greater was Archippus (...), Naz.
a ruler of Horses: It requires art to rule a Horse well, and the Ministry is
(...). The art of arts, 2 Cor. 3.
and the science of sciences; who is sufficient for those things? There be
many wild and untoward Horses in every congregation, there had need be an
Archippus among them.

This Archippus was the Bishop or Pastor of Colosse where PHILEMON dwelt; Col.
4.17.
say to Archippus, etc. He married the daughter of Philemon and Apphiah, as
some conjecture; others stick not to say, he was their son. It seems to be
out of all question, that he kept in Philemons house, because St. Paul joins
him with the household.

To him he gives the title of fellow-Souldier, because he fought under CHRIST'S
banner in the ministry, as he did. All Christians are Soldiers, Sen.
yea all men are Soldiers; Vivere est militare: to live is to war, the life
of man is a warfare on the earth. So soon as we are borne, we come into a
warfare; but much more is the life of a Minister, the Devil spites him above
all: the King of Aram gave this charge to his Soldiers, 1 Reg. 22.31.
fight neither against more, nor less; save against the King of Israel only:
and the prince of darkness gives this charge to his instruments, fight
neither against more, nor less, save against the Ministers only; they pull us
down, and we will pull them down, if we can: this is the voice of all the
Devils in hell. 1 Cor. 16.9.
A Preacher shall never want enemies: a great door and effectual is opened
unto me, but there be many adversaries; yet let us be strong and of a good
courage. 1. We have a Potent, a faithful, a careful, and a loving Captain:
he holds the seven stars in his right hand, Apoc. 1.16.
he fights for us, he fights with us. The Prophets hand was on the Kings hand,
when he shot: Acts 11.21.
and CHRIST'S hand is on our hand, when we preach. 2. If we hold on faithfully
to the end, we shall have the Crown of life: they that have converted many,
shall shine as the stars for ever and ever. Dan. 12.3.


He is not only a Soldier, but his fellow. Soldier. Saint Paul was a Captain
in comparison of him, being an Apostle! yet he terms him his fellow. The
Angels are our fellows: Apoc. 19.10. Psalm. 45.7.
nay it is said of Christ; thou have anointed him with the oil of gladness
above his fellows: Let no Minister disdain to call his brethren fellows,
though he be set in never so high a chair of dignity in the Church.

Having saluted one in the house in special, he salutes the whole house in
general.

Cornelius a lapide affirms, that his house was the place of public meeting
appointed by Saint Paul, where the Church did assemble together: for that cause
is his house termed a Church. But then. 1. He would have said, to thy house the
Church: not to the Church in thy house. 2. In the Greek it is not (...), but
(...); in thy house, but throughout thy house, in every corner of thy house:
For in his house were children, strangers and servants, which were dispersed
throughout the house: Cathar.
Vniversam domum appellat honorifico nomine ecclesiae, Cajet.
he calls the whole house by the honorable name of a Church: familiam ipsius
ecclesiam appellat; Chrysostom. in arg. Epist.
he calls his family a Church. He was (...) an admirable man, whose house has
the name of a Church.

It did resemble a Church in many things.

1. In sanctitate, in holiness: a Church is holy, They be holy persons that
come to Church: Procul este prophani. So Philemons house consisted of them that
were holy: he purged his house, as David did. A froward heart shall depart from
me; Psalm. 101.4.
him that privily slandereth his neighbor will I destroy: no deceitful person
shall dwell in my house, he that speaks lies shall not remain in my sight.
There was no coseners, flatterers, no liars, drunkards, tale-bearers permitted
in Philemons house: an holy company, therefore it might have the name of a
Church.

2. It is so termed propter ordinem: A comely order is kept in a Church: So was
there in Philemons house. 1 Reg. 10.5.
The Queen of Shebah wondered at the sitting of Solomon's servants, at the order
of his Ministers, of their apparel, drinking vessels, etc. So if a man had
been in PHILEMONS house, he would have been ravished with the decent and
religious carriage of all in the house, Men, Women and children.

3 Propter multitudinem; for the multitude: there be many in a Church: So was
there in Philemons house. It is said of the house of ^aal, it was full from end
to end: So Philemons house, 2 Reg. 10.21.
though large and ample, yet it was filled from end to end.

4. Propter exercitia pietatis, for the godly and Religious exercises, that
were in it, reading of Scripture, singing of Psalms, prayers morning and
evening, and preaching too; for before the Gospel was countenanced by public
authority, they were feign to have preaching in houses. Acts 20.
As the Town Clerk of Ephesus said, the Law is open: So now the Church is
open: there is no necessity of house-preaching, which is used by Brownists and
Schismatikes.

This was a worthy family, which Saint Paul honors with the title of a
Church; such a family was Iosuahs. I and my house will serve the Lord; Ios.
24.15.
Such a family was that of the Centurions: who as he had a great faith, so he
had great good government in his house: his servants were at his beck, he said
to one, come, and he came: go, and he went: do this, and he did it. Such a
family was Cornelius's, which feared God with all his household. Such a
family had Iuliana, to whom Saint Augustine, and Alypius writ, Domum vestram
non parvam Christi ecclesiam deputamus: Epist. 143.
We account your house no small Church of Christ: Eusebius reports of
Constantine, Lib. 4. de vita
that he had in his Palace the form of a Church, singing of Psalms, Constan.
and himself would begin the Psalm: reading of Scripture, prayers. Oh that
all Christian families were like to these! Saint Bernard finds fault with
Eugerius, that the laws of Justinian made a greater noise in his Palace, De
consid. ad Eug. lib. 1.
then the laws of GOD. Suffer no unchastitie, no indecencie to reside in the
countenance, in the habit, in the gate of those that be about thee. Inter
mitratos discurrere calamistratos non decet: Ambr. in hunc locum.
it is not comely to see uncomely heads among them that wear miters upon their
heads.

Catharinus being himself a Bishop, is not afraid to say, that Philemon vir
saecularis, a secular man, shall rise up in judgment against us the Prelates
of the Church, who had turned his house into a Church. A worthy pattern for
all to imitate! There is much crying for reformation: let every man reform
himself, and every house-holder his family: then soon would there be an
happy reformation in Church and Commonwealth.

We have had the persons in the salutation: there remains now the matter of
it: which conteines in it three things. Donum, datorem, mediatorem, the gift,
the giver, the Mediator. The gift is double; primum and ultimum: the first,
which is grace: the last, which is peace: the one is causa and fons bonorum,
the cause and fountain of all good things: the other finis and perfectio
bonorum, the end and perfection of them all.

Grace first, the undeserved love and favor of God. By nature we are out of
favor with him: the children of wrath. All have sinned, and all stand in need
of the favor of God.

It is a sweet thing to have the favor of Princes, yet that is mutable.
Mephibosheth had David's favor: but he was wound out of favor. Athanasius had
the favor of Constantine, but he lost it. 1. God is immutable, not so much as
a shadow of turning in him. 2. They can pleasure us but with fading things: God
with durable. 3. They dye: God lives for ever. 4. They can do us no pleasure,
when we be dead: God can, for all live to him: he can raise us up again, and
set us in heavenly places with Christ; let us all sue for his favor.

The next is peace, flowing from the other. 1. All kind of prosperity,
especially the peace of Conscience, that surpasses all.

There is the worlds peace, that worldlings have: their eyes stick out by
reason of fatness: they are not in trouble as other men, they have more than
heart can wish: they dye, and that peace dies with them.

There is CHRIST'S peace: Romans 5.1.
being justified by faith we have peace with God, through JESUS CHRIST our
LORD. That is the comfortable peace indeed; Is it peace, Iehu, said Iehoram?
What peace, when as the Witchcrafts and Adulteries of thy Mother Iezebel, are
yet in great number? What peace can a man have, when as his sins box him
continually, and will not suffer him to be quiet? As the Ghost of NERO his
Mother tormented him.

There is no peace, says God, to the wicked: Isa. 57.20.2^
he is like the raging Sea, foaming out dirt and mire. When Herod intended to
make War with them of Tyrus and Sydon, they sued for peace by Blastus his
Chamberlain. God Almighty intends to make War against us for our sins: let
us sue to him for peace by Christ Jesus, who by the blood of his Cross has
set at peace all things in heaven and earth. Augustus Caesar wished three
things to his Son; the favor of Pompey, the boldness of Alexander, and his
own fortune; Let us wish these two things to all that we love: grace and
peace.

From whom? From GOD our Father. Isa. 9.6.
All the Persons in the Trinity are our father. CHRIST is the everlasting
Father: the Holy Ghost is our Father. I will not leave you Orphans,
fatherless: the comforter shall be a father to you. Haymo.
They may all be here comprehended. Vbi una persona Trinitatis auditur, ibi
tota Trinitas intelligitur. Iac. 1.17.
Every good gift and perfect thing comes from above, even from the Father of
light: from him comes grace, peace, and all other good things; let us all put
up our supplications to him.

By whom? He is described three ways; a Dignitate, a Charitate, a Sanctitate.
For his dignity, he is the Lord: for his love, he is JESUS, and a Savior: for
his Sanctity, he is Christ, the anointed above all.

CHRIST is the Conduct pipe, whereby all blessings are conveyed to us: he is
the heir of all; we Coheyres by him: he is primarily beloved; we secondarily,
in him and for him. As the ointment powered on Aarons head, went down to his
beard and the skirts of his garment: So the oil of gladness powered on Christ
our head, came down from him to us all: we have nothing without him, he is to
be magnified for all.

Saint Paul in this inscription has broached a great deal of Christian
eloquence for Onesimus: every word is an orator to plead for him. 1. The name
of Paul, which was renowned among all. 2. The estate of Paul, a Prisoner, and
that of Jesus Christ: he may not stop his ears against the cry of such a
prisoner. 3. Not he alone, but Timothy too: Et vis unita fortior. 4. He is
his dearly beloved: he may not deny him, that loves him so dearly. 5. He is
his fellow labourer, and he must give him leave to labor with him in this
business. 6. He puts in the Woman too: this night-raven even in bed may sing
a sweet note for Onesimus. 7. Archippus being appointed their Pastor, cannot
easily be rejected. 8. The whole household will speak a good word for their
old fellow servant. 9. The name of grace must needs make him to deal
graciously with Onesimus. Philemon had the forgiveness of his sins, by the
grace of God: that must induce him to forgive his servant, as God of his mere
grace and mercy had forgiven him, (...), imitate thy heavenly Master in this:
it is Chrysostomes observation. In hunc locum.


VERSE 4.
We have dwelt something long in the porch; yet no longer then necessity
required: let us now enter into the house, and come to the substance of the
Epistle.

Where, first, there is the subject of it, secondly the conclusion of it, Verse
21.

The subject of it is an earnest suit for Onesimus. Where, 1. There is the
foundation, whereupon his suit is built. 2. The commencing of the suit or
supplication to him for Onesimus. 3. The foundation is the graces, wherewith
PHILEMON was beautified: they are expressed in a thanksgiving; wherein these
circumstances are to be considered.

Verse 4.
1. Cui, to whom he gives thanks. 2. Quando, when he gives thanks. 3. Super
quo, for what he gives thanks, for his love and faith. 5.
Where 1. A relation of them. 2. A communication of them.
6.
4. Quare, Why he gives thanks; because he has a joyful experience of them in
himself. 7.

He does not say, I commend thee, I extol thee to the skies for this great
love thou show to the Saints, and for the faith thou have in the LORD JESUS!
but I thank GOD for them. He is to be praised for all. Aug. de great. and lib.
Arbitr. c. 19
The Orator would thank God for honor, but himself for virtue. It was the
Donatists song; Scientia ex Deo, charitas ex nobis: knowledge is of GOD, love
is of our selves. Whereas God is to be blessed for them all: for what have we
poor beggars but that which we have received? Eo quisque pessimus, 1 Cor. 4.
Bern. in Cant. Sermon. 84.
quo optimus, fi adscribat sibi quod optimus. He, that is best, is worst, if he
ascribe his excellency to himself. Ambr. De Ios pair. c. 11.
Joseph indeed (says Augustine) found silver in Benjamins sack: but it was of
his own putting in: So God finds silver and golden graces in us, but he put
them in before: therefore he is to be thanked for all. Homo est exceptorium
bonitatis Dei: Man is an empty vessel that receives all, Iren. lib. 4. cap.
24.
which it pleases God to power into it.

Whose God is he, whom he thanks? My God. What? is he Saint Paul's God, and not
Saint Peter's God? Yes verily. It is not his meaning to monopolize God to
himself, as it is the manner of some to do. God is their God alone, they are
the Sole children of God: all others are reprobates. St. Paul was not of such a
proud spirit: he speaks this, Non Deum restringendo, sed Deum applicando, not
restraining God to himself, but applying God to himself. Aug. makes a sweet
commentary upon it. Dicis, Deus meus, thou say, my God; Securus dicis, verum
dicis: De ovib. cap. 16.
thou speak it securely, thou speak it truly: at non fecisti, ut non sit
alterius: yet thou have not hereby brought it to pass, that he should not be
other men's God, as well as thine: Non enim sic dicis, Deus meus, quomodo equus
meus; for thou do not so say, my God, as thou do, my horse: equus tuus
est, non alterius; he is thy horse, and not another. Deus and tuus est, and
alterius, Romans 3.29. Ios. 3.13.
he is thy God and another too: not of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles
too: yea the God of the whole world. The Sun is ALEXANDERS, and Diogenes too.

But this is the property of faith, to apply God particularly to our selves.
My Redeemer lives, says Job: there is no peace, Job 19.25. Isa. 57. vlt. Luke
1.74. Ioh. 20.^8. Romans 1.8. Gal. 2.20.
says my God, to the wicked: my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, says the
Virgin Mary: My God, and my Lord, says Saint Thomas: I thank my God, says
Saint Paul, which has loved me and given himself for me. Meus Jesus says
Origin, my Jesus, frequent in his books. Erasmus reports of Dr. Colet Deane of
Saint Paul's, that he was often heard to speak these words, O Vtinam essem cum
meo Christo. The Devil can say, God; and he trembles at it: but he cannot say,
my God: this is proper to the faithful. Psalm. 27.1.
The Lord is my strength and my salvation, whom shall I fear? the Lord is the
strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? Psalm. 23.4.
though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
evil: he will be my God in life and in death too: he will never forsake me, 2 Timothy 4.18.
till he has brought me to his everlasting kingdom.

But where or when did he give thanks for him? in his prayers: making mention
of thee. He was not unmindfull of him, he did not forget him, as Pharaohs
butler did Joseph: he remembered him, he made mention of him.

Not now and then, but always.

Where? Not in his cups: but in prayers. There were some in Saint Ambrose time,
that would make mention of the Emperor in their cups: but St. Paul made
mention of Philemon in his prayers: as he praised God for him, so he prayed to
God likewise for him.

The best men cumulated with the greatest graces of the Spirit, had need to be
prayed for. St. Paul was rapt up into the third heavens, where he saw secrets
not to be uttered, yet he desires the Ephesians prayers. Ephesians. 6.
Saint Peter was a stout champion: yet CHRIST prays that his faith should not
fail. Philemon abounded in all good gifts, of knowledge, faith and love, yet
St. Paul ceased not to pray for him.

1. The best of all know but in part, believe in part, love in part: therefore
we had need to pray for them, that their defects may be supplied, 1 These. 3.10.
that they may increase daily more and more.

2. Here we are viatores, non apprehensores, wayfaring men, we are not come to
our journeyes end: therefore we had need to be prayed for, that we may
persevere to the end, and have the crown of life.

Paul had his prayers: So we must all. Isaac went into the field to pray:
Psalm. 55.17.
and he prayed often in his tent too. David prayed at all seiles of the day:
morning, evening, noone, and he prayed in the night too. David was encumbred
with the weighty affairs of the kingdom: yet he prayed thrice a day.
Cornelius prayers, went up into remembrance before God. Our Savior in the
days of his flesh was full of prayers: there was one that paid three hundred
prayers to God every day, as a daily tribute. Constantine was stamped in his
coin, praying, he would especially be marked for that.

1. Our necessities are many, for soul and body: therefore let our prayers be
many. We are as houses that stand in continual need of reparations; therefore
let us pray to him that made us, to repair us, 2 Pa^al. 20.12.
that we may be fit buildings for his Majesty.

2. Our enemies are many, within and without too. Now there is no strength in
us, against this great multitude: let us pray to God to stand by us and for us.

Iac. 1.6.
But let us pray, first in faith: else we are like the Waves of the Sea, Iac.
5.16.
and shall obtain nothing.

2. In fervencie: remembering the Apostles (If) dignior sequeture effectus, Aug.
Ep. 121.
quem ferventior praecedit affectus: that prayer shall have the greatest
efficacy, which has the greatest fervencie.

Hier. lib. 1. c. 3. Psalm. 34 6. Aug. in illum Psalmum. Luke 1.
3. In humility: omnis rogatio humilitate eget: all requests must be preferred
in humility. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him: thou prayest, and
art not heard, quia diveses: because thou art rich in thy own conceit: he sent
the rich empty away.

4. Pray with importunity: a kind of godly impudency, says Nazianzen is to
be used in prayer.

1 Timothy 2.1. 2 Samuel 18.3.
5. Perseveringly.

Special mention is to be made of some in our prayers. 1. Of Kings, which are
(...), the pillars of the people: they are worth ten thousand of us,
therefore let us pray for them nominatim, by name.

Ter. ad Scapul.
Sacrificamus pro salute Imperatoris Deo nostri and ipsius, sed quomodo? pura
prece: we sacrifice for the safety of the Emperor, to his God and ours. But
how? by pure prayer.

2. Of learned, and godly Preachers, that may win many thousands to Christ.

3. Of extraordinary commonwealths men.

4. Of rare Christians, as Philemon was.

Alexander counted Achilles happy, that he had such a trumpetter of his
praises, as Homer was. PHILEMON might count himself happy, that he had such
a worthy man to pray for him, as Saint Paul was. KING Abimelech was beholden
to Abraham, Genesis 20.7. Job 42.8.
for his prayers: and Jobs friends to him, for his prayers. Constantine thought
his palace strong, because it was fenced with the prayers of holy Bishops. Let
us rejoice in this, that we have Paul's to pray for us.

VERSE 5.
But what was the motive of his thanksgiving? The excellent graces wherewith
GOD had adorned him: where there is 1. Fama bonorum, the report of them. 2.
enumeratio bonorum, an enumeration of them. 3. Objecta eorum, the objects of
them.

For the fame or report, Saint Paul heard of them: an admirable hearing, from
Phrygia to Rome, says Chrysostom and Oecumenius.

There are two things that are wont to be carried in the Wagon of fame; bad and
good: the one swiftly, the other slowly: the one lamely, the other lustily: of
the one we shall hear all, and more than all: and scant half of the other; as
it fell out in the Wisdom of Solomon.

What did he hear? His love and faith: where is hope then? tanquam media in
ijs intelligitur, says Aquin. as a middle virtue between both, it is
comprehended in both. Bern. in Psalm. 91. Ser. 10.
These three in a golden chain are linked together: faith says, parata sunt
mihi magna; great things are prepared for me: hope says, mihi servantur magna,
great things are reserved for me: love says, curro ad illa magna; I make have
to those great things.

But why hath' love the precedencie? Love is the daughter; faith the mother:
and must the daughter be placed above the Mother? It is so: 1. Because it is
Saint Paul's drift in this whole Epistle, to procure PHILEMONS love to Onesimus.
2. Because love is Notior Nobis, better known to us then faith, which is more
hid and secret.

These are illustrated by their objects; CHRIST and the Saints. The Papists
refer both to both objects: whereupon they infer. As we love God and the
Saints too: So we must believe in God and in the Saints too: yet diversely; in
God principaliter, principally; in the Saints consequenter, consequently.

There is no consequence in this argument: for God has commanded us to love
all; but he has not commanded us to believe in all: that he has reserved as
a regal prerogative to himself; and his glory he will not give to another. He
says, owe nothing to any man, save love: but he does not say, owe nothing to
any man, save to believe in him.

2. Here the Apostle speaks of living Saints, to whom Philemon extended his
liberality: now the Papists will not have us to believe in living Saints, but
in dead Saints: therefore this place makes not for them.

Romans 4.5.
3. It is said, to him that works not, but belieueth in him, that justifies
the ungodly, De peccat. mer. and remis. cap. 14.
his faith is counted for righteousness. Aug. makes a worthy collection upon
it: whosoever dares say, justifico te, I justify thee, may consequently say,
creed in me, believe in me: which none of the Saints can truly say; save only
he which is Sanctus Sanctorum, Ioh. 14.1.
the Saint of Saints. Ye believe in God, believe also in me. Credimus Paulo,
sed non credimus in Paulum: we believe Paul, but not in Paul: we believe
Peter, but not in Peter: As we believe the Catholic Church, but not in the
Catholic Church: because the Creed says, I believe in the Holy Ghost, Nazian.
concludes from thence, De theol. l. 5.
that the Holy Ghost is God: for we must believe in none but God.

4. Quid est credere in cum, nisi credendo in cum ire, and ejus membris
incorporari? What is it to believe in him.i. In CHRIST? but by believing to go
into him, and to be incorporated as members into his body? Now we are not
incorporated into the Saints: therefore, we are not to believe in them.

5. They can erect no such building out of this place: for the praepositions in
the Greek distinguish the objects. Hearing of thy love and faith, there he
pauseth a while; which thou have toward the Lord Jesus, there he restraines
faith; and toward all Saints.i. Thy love toward all Saints, regulating (...)
before mentioned.

6. Paul is a good expositour of himself.

Since we heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and of your love toward all
Saints. Col. 1.4.
Here he reduces them to their proper objects; so that no question can be made
of it.

7 If we must believe in the Saints; we must hope in the Saints: It is St.
Basil's reason. In Psalm. 7.
But we must hope in God alone: Maledictus qui sperat in homine, cursed be he
that hopes in man.

As Saint Paul heard of PHILEMONS faith and love: So it were to be wished, that
all the world might ring of our faith and love: these be necessary for all
Christians: faith in the first place; love in the second: nec palms sine vite,
nec virtus sine fide: there can be no branch without the Vine; Bern. in Cant.
Ser. 30.
no virtue, no not love without faith. Faith makes a Christian, love makes and
shows a Christian. No CHRIST, no heaven; no faith, no CHRIST. Faith is the
hand that lays hold on CHRIST. The high Priests and Pharisees gave a strait
charge, Ioh. 11. ult.
that if any knew where CHRIST was, he should show it, that they might take
him. Would ye feign take him, says Augustine? I will tell you where he is, In
Ioh. tract. 50.
and how ye may take him. He is in heaven, there ye may take him. Sed quomodo
mittam manum in Coelum, ut ibi sedentem capiam? How shall I send my hand into
heaven, to take him? mitte fidem, and tenuisti. Send thy faith thither, and
thou have taken him. By faith we apprehend him and all his benefits: by faith
we put on CHRIST as a garment, wherewith our sins are covered from the sight
of God: and as Jacob got the blessing in the clothes of his elder brother; so
do we get heaven, clothed with Christ; Apoc. 12.1.
like the Woman clothed with the Sun.

CHRIST dwells in our hearts by faith. O happy house, Ephesians. 3.17.
where the Son of God dwells! Faith is the victory, 1 Ioh. 5.4. Romans 8.37.
whereby we overcome the world: we are more than Conquerours through him, that
has loved us. Insomuch that we may take up that triumphant song; O death where
is thy sting? Hell, where is thy victory? the strength of death is sin: the
strength of sin is the Law: but thanks be to God through Jesus Christ, that
has delivered us from you all. By Faith Moses saw him which is invisible!
Hebr. 11.27.
by faith we see the joys of heaven, and Christ standing at the right hand of
GOD, ready to receive us into them: he that believes, has eternal life; Ioh.
3. ult.
he is as it were in heaven already: therefore let us be suitors to God,
because faith is the gift of GOD, to bestow it where it is not, and to increase
it, where it is: yea let us all pray for the faith of Job; though thou kill me,
I will believe in thee.

It is an axiom with the Papists, that faith may be without love: Aug. In ep.
Io tract. 10.
we grant it; fides Daemonum; but not fides Christianorum: an Historical faith
(which is the faith of the Church of Rome defined by a Catechism authorized by
the Council of Trent) may be without Love, and a miraculous faith may be
without love, 1 Cor. 13.2.

But a justifying faith cannot; he that is persuaded of the love of God toward
him in Christ, God so loved the world, etc. cannot but love the brethren, and
members of Christ. 1 Ioh. 5.1.
Every one which loves him that begat, loves him also which is begotten of
him. They that brag of faith, and have no love, are like empty vessels; that
give a lusty sound and have nothing in them.

Though I speak with the tongues of men and Angels, 1 Cor. 13.1.
and have not love; I am as sounding brass, and as a tinkling Cymball: though
I had the gift of Prophecy, and knew all secrets and all knowledge; If I had
all faith, that I could remove mountains, and had not love; I were nothing:
Though I feed the poor with all my goods, and give my body to be burned, and
have not love; it profits me nothing. So though I talk of Religion with a
silver, yea with an Angelical tongue; though I go (which is the glory of
many) to never so many Lectures, hear Sermons, receive Communions, and have
not love; I am nothing.

Saint Augustine amplifies it further. In. 1. epist. Ioh. tract. 5.
Signent se omnes signo crucis; Let them sign themselves with the sign of the
Cross; Let them say Amen, that the Church rings of it; let them sing
Hallelujah; let them fetch deep sighs and groans at Sermons: that may be
added. Let them enter into Churches, let them build Churches; all this is to
small purpose: non discernuntur filii Dei a filiis diaboli, nisi charitate;
nothing distinguishes the children of GOD from the children of the Devil, De
resur. dom. Ser. 2.
but love. Hereby shall all men know ye be my Disciples, if ye love one
another. Faith without love is as a lamp without oil: vita corporis anima;
vita fidei charitas. Bern. the life of the body is the soul: Gal. 5.6.
and the life of faith is love: faith that works by love.

Iac. 2.16.
Not a verbal love, like them; warm your selves, fill your bellies, and give
them nothing; but a real love: to feed the hungry, to cloth the naked, to
be an eye to the blind, a foot to the lame; to be a father and mother to the
poor and fatherless; to be a covering to them, Job 31.17.
that their loins may bless us, as they go in the streets; to be bountiful
in our alms to all the people, as Cornelius was; Acts 10. Acts 9.
to prepare garments for poor widows, as Dorcas did. Such was the love of
PHILEMON, an actual love; he refreshed the bowels of the Saints. Such must be
the love of all true Christians, 1 Ioh. 3.18.
My little children, love not in word and tongue only, but in deed and in
truth.

PHILEMONS love extended it self to the Saints, as is here avouched of him:
yet it was not couped up within the pen of the Saints: the Saints must have
the prime place in our love, but not the whole. Do good to all men: chiefly
to them of the household of faith: Gal. 6.10.
they chiefly, but not they wholly. Aristotle gave an alms to an unworthy
man: one reproved him for it. Says he, I gave it (...), non (...). To the
nature of the man, not to the man; the nature is Gods, and must be sustained:
the vice is his own and the Devils, and must be reformed.

Neh. 5.5. Isa. 58.7.
Their flesh is as our flesh, and we must not hide our eyes from our own flesh.

Psalm. 16.3.
Nevertheless, the Saints must drink most deeply and frequently of the cup of
our love. All my delight is in the Saints that be on the earth. 1 Cor. 16.1.
Saint Paul ordaines a collection for the Saints every first day of the week.
He himself was content to be a messenger to carry a contribution to the poor
Saints at Jerusalem, and requesteth the prayers of the Romans, Romans 15.26.31.
that, that his service might be accepted of the Saints.

1 Cor. 6.2.
Know ye not that the Saints shall judge the world? God honors them to be
the judges of the world: therefore the world ought especially to be relievers
and lovers of them.

VERSE 6.
LAst of all, quorsum? To what end? We give thanks and pray: that the
communication of thy faith -- Where, 1. There is a narration of it. 2. A
confirmation of it, Ver. 7. In the narration, 1. The act of communication. 2.
The effect of it. 3. The end of it. As there is a communion of Saints, so there
must be a communion of gifts: bonum, quo communius, eo melius, a good thing the
more common it is, the better it is: Clem. Alex. l. 3. Paedagogi. c. 7. Ambr.
Offic. l. 1. c. 33.
the Sun communicates his light to all the world, and shines the brighter for
that: the springs and fountains communicate their water, and are the fuller
for that: a nurse or mother communicates her milk to the infant, and her
breasts are replenished still: the communication of faith, of knowledge and
other gifts is not a diminution, but an augmentation of them. Let us joyfully
communicate that which we have, one to another.

May become effectual. In some Greek copies it is (...) conspicuous,
manifest: but (...) is rather to be embraced; having an effectual operation in
others, to provoke them to the like. 2 Cor. 8.8.
So Saint Paul provokes the Corinthians to liberality, by the example of the
Macedonians: one student provokes another, one Merchant an other, and one
Christian an other. Sanguis martyrum semen ecclesiae, the burning of one Martyr
made many: and the liberality of one Christian makes many liberal: examples
are more availeable then precepts.

But how? By the acknowledging of every good thing. We must acknowledge the
good things that be in others. 1 Reg. 10.9.
The Queen of Shebah extolled the good things that were in Solomon, and
blessed GOD for them. The elders of the Jews acknowledged the good things that
were in the Centurion. Luke 8.5.
God set the good things that were in Job, as on a stage, Job 1.8.
and the Devil himself could not but acknowledge them, though maliciously he
depraved them. Christ though he were the giver of them, Ioh. 1.47.
acknowledged the good things that were in Nathaniel. 2 Pet. 3.15.
Peter acknowledges the good things that were in St. Paul. St. Augustine
acknowledged the good things that were in St. Hierome: and Hierom also the good
things that were in Saint. Aug. as appears by their Epistles one to another.
We are injurious to God, if we do not acknowledge them. No Painter but would
have his picture acknowledged: every good man is the beautiful picture of God
Almighty; they be envious persons, that will not acknowledge them.

How comes it to be in them? In CHRIST JESUS. (...) for (...). In us dwells
no good thing. Romans 7.
Christ is the worker of all good things in us: Phil. 1.11.
that ye may be plentiful in the fruits of righteousness by Jesus Christ.

Or (...) to CHRIST JESUS.i. Catharin.
In gloriam Christi Jesus: that he may have the glory of it. Not to us, O Lord,
but to thy name give the praise. Matthew. 5.16.
Debes videri, thou ought to be seen Let your light so shine before men,
that seeing your good works, they may glorify your Father, Aug. In ep. 10.
tract. 8.
which is in heaven. Sed non ad h^c debes facere, ut videaris, but thou must
not do it to this end to be seen. Ille in te laudetur, qui in te operatur;
let him be praised, that works all good things in thee.

VERSE 7.
THis St. Paul confirms by experience in himself: Where, 1. exprimit
latitiam, he expresses his gladness: then ostendit causam, he shows the
cause of it.

We.i. I and Timothy: not, we had, as it is in the vulgar. We have, even at
this present time. Not a little, but great joy: and consolation arising of joy.
First, his heart was affected with wonderful joy: from that did spring
consolation, in the midst of his great troubles and afflictions, that comforted
him: it was as aquavitae to revive him withal.

Wherein did he take so great joy? Not in his riches, but in his love. Many are
rich, wherein men take no great joy nor consolation. Nabal was rich: yet David
had no joy, nor consolation by him: but in thy love which did untie thy purse
strings, and made thee bountiful unto all: 1 Cor. 13.4.
for that is the nature of love.

Why? because the bowels, of the Saints -- Some interpret the bowels of the
Saints, the children of the Saints, because they be the fruit of our body and
our bowels; 2 Samuel 16.11.
as David says of Absalom, my Son which came out of my own bowels seeks
my life. But it is more general: not only the children of the Saints, but the
Parents too. The father and mother were refreshed by him. The Greek is
Emphaticall, were quieted: for when the bowels are empty, they be out of quiet.

He does not say, the backs of the Saints are refreshed by thee: that is
requisite; but the refreshing of the bowels is more necessary: for if the
belly be well lined, less cloth will serve the back.

Alms, or a work of mercy is a singular work above others:

1. Homines facit Deo similes. Be ye merciful, as your heavenly Father is
merciful. Merciful men draw nearest to God. GOD feeds all creatures; Clem.
Alex. strom. l. 2.
and he feeds as many as he can: homo benefaciens est imago Dei, a bountiful
man is the image of God. An Image is a lively representation of the party; and
a liberal man that does good to others, represents God.

2. Eleemosyna est scopa, quae mundificat omnia: It is a fair broom, that
makes all clean. Give alms, and ecce, behold! A fine spectacle; Luke 11.41.
not some, but all things are clean unto you. As the first fruits in the time
of the law did sanctify the rest of the fruits: So alms in the time of the
Gospel sanctify all unto us: all that we possess are unclean without them.

3. Eleemosyna est usura a Deo approbata, an usury approved by God, more
gainefull than any other usury: He that has mercy on the poor lends to the
Lord, and the Lord will recompense him that which he has given. Whereupon St.
Basil says; It is both (...) and (...), a gift and a lent gift put forth to
usury: In Psalm. 15.
not to a mortal man, but to the immortal God, who will give great use for
it; not ten in the hundred, but an hundred fold in this world, Matt. 19.
and everlasting happiness in the world to come. Naz Epist. Ambr. de Nab.
It is (...), the gainefullest trade of all. Vende aurum, and eme salutem, sell
thy gold, and buy salvation; vende lapidem, and eme regnum; sell a stone, and
buy a Kingdom; vende agrum, and eme tibi vitam aeternam, sell a piece of land,
and buy Heaven.

4. It is procurator coeli, an Harbinger that goes before to provide thee a
place in heaven. Act. 10.4.
Cornelius his alms went up into remembrance before God. God registered it in
the book of his remembrance against he himself came thither. 1 Timothy 6.18.
Saint Paul charge the rich men of the world, to do good, to be rich in good
works, ready to distribute and to communicate, laying up in store for
themselves a good foundation for the time to come.

5. Remuneratur in coelo, prae aliis operibus, It is rewarded with Heaven above
all other works. Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared
for you. When I was hungry, Matt. 25.
ye gave me meat, etc.

Therefore let us refresh the bowels of the Saints here, that we may enter
into the place of eternal refreshing hereafter. Act. 3.19.


We are too straight laced; we make this mammon of unrighteousness our enemy,
whereas we should make him our friend. Naz. in sun. patr.
Nazianzen's mother carried such a bountiful mind to the poor, that a Sea of
wealth could scarce have sufficed her: She was contrary to Salomon's
horse-leach, that cried, give, give, namely to me: She cried; give, give to
the poor. He heard her often say; She and her children should want, before
the poor should want: we are all for our selves, our Wives and Children;
nothing for the poor.

Amadeus Duke of Sabaudia, being asked of certain Orators, Munster. l. 2.
Cosmogr.
whether he kept hounds or not? Yes, says he, Come to morrow, and ye shall see
them. They being come, he opens a window into his Hall, where a great multitude
of poor folks were dining: hij sunt canes mei, said he, these are my dogs,
and with them I hope to get Eternal Life. It is not unlawful for Noblemen
and Gentlemen to have their hawks and hounds. God has given us things for
pleasure, as well as for necessity, wine and oil etc. Yet so, as we be
moderate in the use of them, and forget not the affliction of Joseph. One poor
Lazarus is worth more than ten thousand dogs; Ye are of more value, than many
sparrowes: and we should, value the poor members of Christ above all the
hawks and hounds in the world: as the Elect of God, let us put on the bowels
of mercy, and refresh to our ability, yea beyond our ability, the bowels of the
Saints, especially in these hard times wherein we live. The hard hearts of men
make the times harder, then otherwise they would be.

He shuts it up with a kind compellation; brother. Not in the Ministry, as
he called Timothy his brother, Verse 1. but in CHRIST our elder brother. The
Donatists were angry with St. Augustine for calling them brethren. In Psalm. 33.
That learned father deplores their case before the people, doleamus illos
(fratres) tanquam fratres, let us lament them (brethren) as brethren: Velint,
nolint, fratres nostri sunt, whether they will or no, they are our brethren:
tunc esse desinent fratres nostri, quando desierint dicere, pater noster, then
they shall cease to be our brethren, when they cease to say, Our Father. Isa.
65.5.
Stand apart, says the Hypocrite, come not near me, I am holyer than you. So
say some holy ones among us: namely the brethren of the separation; So they
style themselves (an unbrotherly title) disdaining us for their brethren: they
are not so good brethren as we wish they were, like ungracious children having
forsaken their mother: neither indeed will they say Pater noster with us: for
it is piaculum with them, to say the LORDS Prayer: yet for all that, they shall
be our brethren, professing the same GOD, the father of us all, and the same
CHRIST, the SAVIOR of us all. We will not utterly discard them, though they
discard us.

VERSE 8.
THat for the gratulation. Now to the supplication. Where, 1. The manner of it.
Then the matter of it. 10. For the manner, it is not by the way of command. 8.
But of entreatie. 9.

Why does he not command? Because he wanted authority? No: he had sufficient
power to do it; not fearfully, but boldly: he had not a little, but much
boldness: not usurped, but committed to him from CHRIST: he had boldness, not
to request, but to enjoyne: Not, that which was inconvenient, but that which
was convenient.

Ministers may be bold in the execution of their office:

1. Quia Deus imperat, because GOD commands it, Ierem. 1.17. be not afraid of
their faces: he adds a forcible reason; least I destroy thee before them:
Ezekiel. 2.6.
And thou Son of man, fear them not, neither be afraid of their words,
though thorns be with thee, and thou remainest among Scorpions, fear not
their words, nor be afraid of their looks.

2. Quia ipsi ministri pro hoc or ant, because it is that which the Ministers
themselves beg by earnest prayers at the hands of GOD. Now O Lord, behold
their threatenings, and grant unto thy servants with all boldness to speak thy
word. Act. 4.29.30. Ephesians. 6.18.19.
Pray with all manner of prayer and supplication in the spirit: watch thereunto
with all perseverance and supplication for all Saints, and for me, that
utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth with all boldness to
publish the secret of the Gospel. Shall they pray for it, and not practice it?

3. Officii dignitas id postulat: the dignity of their office does require it:
an Ambassador may speak boldly: 2 Cor. 5.10.
We are the Ambassadors of God, the King of Kings: we are in CHRIST'S stead.
Therefore let us be bold.

4. Protectio Dei ad hoc animat. Gods protection may encourage us unto it.
Behold, I have made thee a defenced city, Ier. 1.18.
an iron pillar, and walls of brass against the whole land, against the kings
of Judah and the Princes thereof, against the Priests thereof, against the
people of the land. Apoc. 2.1.
CHRIST holds the seven stars in his right hand; and none shall dash us out
of his hand.

5. Admirationem apud ipsos inimicos procurat: it procures admiration even with
the very enemies. When they saw the boldness of Peter and John, they
mervailed, Act. 4.13.
the high Priest and the whole counsel. This made Luther so famous among all.
The Pope himself and the Emperor could not but admire him. This made Elias
bold with Achab; John Baptist with Herod: Liberius with Constantius:
Chrysostom with Arcadius and Eudoxia: Ambrose with Theodosius; which moved him
to give him this commendation, Solus Ambrosius dignus episcopi nomine; only
Ambrose that has dealt so roundly with me, is worthy the name of a Bishop.
Let us all be bold and courageous in our places, with wisdom and discretion;
but not saucie and impudent, as some are.

2. Ministers have authority not only to entreat, but to enjoyne. The King has
his Injunctions, and we under God and the King have ours. We may enjoyne you
to leave your rash, needless and unadvised swearing, your prophanations: we
may enjoyne you to honor your Fathers in Church and commonwealth, to live in
peace, and love and unity one with another, and he that despises these
things, despises not men, but God. 1 These. 4.8.


But what, to enjoyne?

Quod ad rem pertinet, says the vulgar interpreter, that which concerns the
matter: Sed hoc nihil ad rem, nothing to the purpose. Cajetan finds fault with
that circumlocution, affirming (as the truth is) that in the Greek there is but
one word (...), quod decens est and conveniens, which is decent and convenient:
we have no authority to enjoyne you any unlawful and inconvenient thing; to
go to Mass, where CHRIST is offered up daily by a Priest: because by one
sacrifice once offered, and that by himself alone, he has perfected for ever
them that are to be sanctified: to conspire against Princes, to kill kings, if
in our opinions they be Heretics; heresy makes no divorce between Man and
Wife, much less between the King and his Subjects: so far as God enjoynes
you, we enjoyne, but no further.

VERSE 9.
He has produced his authority, and shown his commission; yet he lays it
aside and falls to entreatie: Where, 1. The motive of it. 2. A description of
the party entreating. The motive is love: Yet for loves sake I rather beseech
thee: for the love of God toward us all in CHRIST: for the love I bear to
thee, for the love thou bear to me, for the love I bear to Onesimus thy
servant, and my Son: let the cords of all those loves draw thy affection to
him. Love has a greater attractive force, then fear: the love of CHRIST
constrains us, says the Apostle. 2 Cor. 5.14.
Lydia being but a woman, by her loving eloquence constrained Paul and Silas:
(...), she used a (...), which is the most forcible argument with the
Logitians: if the people be persuaded of the Preachers love, his preaching
shall be more availeable, Bern. In Cant. Sermon. 23. Hier. ad Theop. adv. Job.
Hie. rusa.
he may wind himself into their affections. Studeto magis amari, quam metui,
strive rather to be loved then feared. Pontifices Christi non dominorum metu,
sed patrum honor veneramur, the Bishops of CHRIST we do not fear as stately
Lords, but honor as loving Fathers: the love of a father will make a good
natured child do any thing.

What does he for loves sake? he rather beseeches then commands: Bern. in Cant.
Sermon. 23.
suspendite verbera, producite ubera, suspend your blows, produce your dugges:
pectora lacte pinguescant, non typho turgeant; let your breasts swell with
milk, not your hearts with pride. Christus non fulminans and tonans, Hier. ad
Theop.
sed in praesepi vagiens, and tacens, in cruce salvavit humanum genus: CHRIST
not thundering and lightning, but weeping and holding his peace saved mankind
upon the cross.

The Pope has not learned this submisse style of Saint Paul: he comes not with
his obsecramus, but with his Volumus and jubemus, we will and command: his
roaring Bulls of excommunication are more frequent, then his humble bills of
supplication: and thundering Preachers now adays, are more applauded, then
loving and beseeching Preachers. Ambr. Offic. lib. 2. c. 7.
Moses cum Deo constanter, cum hominibus humiliter loquebatur; Moses spoke with
God constantly, with men humbly: So let us do that sit in Moses chair.

Then there follows a description of the parties beseeching.

1. In general, being such a one. The vulgar has it, thou being such a one,
referring it to PHILEMON: thou being an old man as I am: but not a prisoner, as
he was: then it should have bin (...), not (...).

It must needs have reference to the party beseeching: though Cor. a lapide
would feign salve it up with a far fetched hebraisme, which is good for none,
but his Romish Ladies. Cajetan and Catharinus correct it; melius, cum sim
talis. Better, I being such an one.

I being such a one. Which may be understood for greatness and for
littleness. Then he describes himself more particularly.

1. a nomine. 2. ab aetate. 3. ab afflictione. 4. a religione. Just. Mart. Ad
orthod.


1. For his name, Paul: Patrum pater, doctor orbis, the Father of fathers, the
teacher of the world: which labored more than they all, and was wrapped up into
the third heaven above them all: or, I Paul, Paulus, little, of small
estimation: and it is for little men to request.

2. For his age: aged. He was a young man, Act. 7.58.
when Stephen was stoned: but he lived till he was an old man.

When he wrote this Epistle, he was above 55. years old. Cajet.
And old men are to be reverenced. 1. Propter ipsam aetatem, for their very
age; because they draw nearest to the Ancient of days: whereupon GOD gave a
charge, thou shall rise up before the hoare head, Lev. 19.32.
and honor the person of the old man. The Lacedaemonians did greatly reverence
them: being at Athens, when they saw an old man coming upon the stage, they
rose up and bowed to him: So did not the Athenians. They had more learning, but
the Lacedaemonians more civility.

2. Propter prudentiam, for their wisdom: in that respect old men have been
of the counsel in all ages, with all nations. (...): Sometime a senioribus,
because it consisted of old men.

3. Propter experientiam, for their experience, which makes them more cautelous
and circumspect: whereas young men are rash and inconsiderate.

4. Propter pietatem, for their piety: if they be good old men indeed, as Saint
Paul was. Age is a Crown of glory, Prove. 16.31.
when it is found in the way of righteousness.

3. He is described by his affliction, a prisoner: and it were pity to add to
the grief of a prisoner, by denying his request.

4. By his religion: not the devils prisoner, but CHRIST'S: and he is to be
regarded, especially by a Christian, and so worthy a Christian as Philemon was.

In these two verses there be six motives to win PHILEMONS love. Gorran.


1. Aspectus authoritatis, the sight of his authority, Ver. 8. 2. Effectus
charitatis, the effect of his love: for loves sake. 3. Affatus humilitatis, his
humble speaking, I beseech thee. 4. Gravitas Senectutis, the gravitie of his
old age: the aged. 5. Captivitas carceris, the bondage of the prison, a
prisoner. 6. Captivitatis causa, the cause of that imprisonment and bondage,
the prisoner of JESUS CHRIST. All these are as Lawyers at the Bar, to plead
for Onesimus.
VERSE 10.
We have had the manner of the supplication: now to the matter of it: which is
Onesimus, that he may be received into favor. Which is 1. Pressed. 2.
Iterated. 20. It is pressed by four principal arguments.

1. Ex part Onesimi, on the part of Onesimus himself. 10, 11. Verses. 2. Ex
part Pauli, on Paul's part, Verse 12.13. 3. Ex part Dei, Verse 15.16, 17. on
Gods part, who had so disposed of it in his providence. 4. Ex part debiti, on
the behalf of the debt, whereof Paul promises satisfaction, Verse 18, etc.
On the part of Onesimus there be two motives.

1. Is, Spiritualis generatio, the spiritual begetting of him, Verse 10. 2.
Is, Vitae mutatio, the happy change that is in him, Verse 11.
I beseech thee: he repeats the word again.

Not for thy servant, but for my Son.

What Son? Not Adoptatus, but Genitus; not adopted, but begotten. Where? Not
in a pulpit in the Church, but in a prison, where I am in bonds. Saint Paul
then was Onesimus his father: not natural, but spiritual: and we are more
beholden to our Spiritual, then to our natural fathers.

1. They beget us of a woman: these of the Church, which is the spouse of
CHRIST.

2. They beget us of mortal seed, therefore we dye: these of the immortal seed
of the word of GOD, whereby we live for ever.

3. They beget us to a temporal life: these to an eternal.

4. They to the miseries of the world: these to the joys of the world to come.
Therefore let us love them, let us have them in singular love for their works
sake. As Alexander professed, he was more beholden to Aristotle, then Philip:
the one gave him esse, being, the other his been esse, his well being. Yet this
is little considered of.

On the other side, our spiritual children should be as dear, yea dearer to
us, Amb. Offic. lib. 1. c. 7.
then our natural: non minus vos diligo, quos in Evangelio genui, quam si ex
conjugio suscepissem; I love you no less, whom I have begotten by the Gospel,
then if I had begotten you in marriage. 1. The love of grace must be more
vehement than the love of nature. 2. Our natural children are to abide with us
but for a time: those for ever.

In hunc locum.
The place where he begat him, is not to be pretermitted: in his bonds: which
Hierom wonders at: tenetur in carcere, vinculis stringitur; squalore corporis,
charorum separatione, paenalibus tenebris coarctatur: he is kept in prison,
bound in chains, he is molested with unsavory smells, yea even with the ill
usage of his own body, with separation from friends, with the darkness of
the prisons: yet now he preaches, now he labors to convert souls to Christ.
Paul and Silas begat the Jailer in prison. CHRIST begat the thief on the
Cross, in the midst of all his pains. And shall not we that beat liberty,
strive to win many unto CHRIST, that we may say with the Prophet, Here am I,
and the Children that thou have given me?

But when did he beget this son of his? when he was Paul the aged: Ideoque
tenerrime diligebatur, says Lyra, he was the more tenderly beloved of him.
Israel loved Joseph above all his sons: Genesis 37.3.
why? Because he begat him in his old age. So did Saint Paul Onesimus. What
was Onesimus whom Paul begat? A servant, a fugitive, and a thief too: yet
Saint Paul disdained not to preach to him. God has his chosen among all: among
harlots, as Rahab: among Publicans, as Zacheus: among the Pharisees, as
Nicodemus: among Persecutors, as Paul: among thieves, as the young man whom St.
John recalled: among poor distressed servants, Eus.
as Onesimus: therefore let us preach to all.

The other thing on the part of Onesimus, is his happy change. Where is to be
considered. 1. What he was. 2. What he is: he was to thee unprofitable, in
being unfaithful in thy service, in purloyning from thee: but now is
profitable to thee, and me: to thee; pro te orando, by praying for thee: to
me; mihi ministrando, Carthus.
in ministering unto me.

There must be an alteration in us all. Such were some of you: 1 Cor. 6.9.11.
but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified. I was a blasphemer, 1 Timothy 1.13.
I was a persecutor; but I am not so now: we must all shoot at that Butt.
Onesimus was unprofitable: but he became profitable. Ye know the doom of the
unprofitable servant: Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into outer
darkness. Mat. 25.30.


(...) with Tertullian are (...): they must be (...), profitable: profitable
Bees, not unprofitable drones, telluris inutile pondus: a company of Lubbers
that are good for nothing.

Saint Paul does not commend Onesimus for being profitable to himself; but to
him and Philemon: He that is not good for himself, is good for no body: there
our goodness must begin, but it must not stay there: do good to all; so be
profitable to all. Gal. 6.14.


Saint Paul here rhetorically and piously descants on the name of Onesimus.
(...) is utilis. Profitable before he was Onesimus by antiphrasis: as lucus,
quia minime lucet, a wood, a lucendo, because there is no light in it: now he
is the right Onesimus. The Scripture is eloquent: Prophetarum, ac Apostolorum
scriptis, Aug. de Deit. Christ. lib. 4. cap. 6.
non solum nihil sapientius, verum etiam nihil eloquentius mihi videri potest:
they did not sequi eloquentiam, sed eloquentia sequuta est eos; not follow
after eloquence, but eloquence followed after them. Saint Paul in that place
where he says he speaks like a fool, quam sapienter dicit? 2 Cor. 11.22.26.
quam eleganter? How wisely? nay, how elegantly does he speak? He that marks
the Scripture diligently, says Saint Chrysostom, will neither desire the
smooth style of Isocrates, nor the swelling style of Demosthenes, nor the grave
style of Thucidides, nor the high style of Plato.

Ambr. Exhor. ad virg.
If we have good names, we should be answerable unto them: There were two
Martyrs: the one Vitalis; the other Agricola: both suitable to their names.
Vitalis showed, that he contemned hanc vitam this life, and sought a better:
Agricola sowed the seed of a spiritual life here, that he might reap eternal
hereafter. Basils Mother was called (...) of (...) membrum: Naz. in Basil.
magnum.
not only for the elegant proportion of her body, but chiefly for the
elegancie of her manners. Epist. ad Hier.
St. Aug. commends one Profuturus to Hierom, whom he hoped by both their
endeavors vere fore profuturum, to be profuturus indeed. Saint Hierom finds
fault with Bonasus, because he presumed too much on his name. Hier. Bonaso.
An ideo tibi bellus videris, quia justo vocaris nomine? Do thou think, that
thou art a fine man, because thou have a fine name? As if they be not called
Parcae, quia minime parcunt. The former part of Onesimus life was contrary to
his name: the latter part was correspondent to it. Onesiphorus for whom Saint
Paul prays, 2 Timothy 1.16.
has a name not much different from Onesimus: he according to his name brought
great profit to Saint Paul and all the Saints: as Onesimus did after his
conversion: if we have good names, let us verefie them by our good lives.

VERSE 12.
THe second Plea is ex part Pauli. Who is singularly well affected to
Onesimus: he testifies his love to him. 1. By sending him. 2. By suing for him.
3. By unfolding the cause of his sending. Negative, Verse 13. Affirmative,
Verse 14.

Not as if he had sent him before: but having run away from PHILEMON he
sends him to him again: though he could hardly have spared him. It seems it
was not well done of him, for Deuteronomy. 23.15. Thou shall not deliver the servant
to his Master, which is escaped from his Master unto thee. We must not deliver
him hero irato, to his Master, when he is angry, in a rage and fury: but we
may deliver him hero placato, to his Master pacified, as Saint Paul here does:
for he had his wrath allayed with many sweet arguments.

Religion does not overthrow polity; evert the degrees of superiority and
inferioritie, that be among men.

In CHRIST there is neither bond nor free, Male nor Female; we are all one in
CHRIST JESUS. Gal. 3.28.
True indeed, we are all one in Christo, but not in mundo: in CHRIST, but not
in the world. CHRIST has dyed indifferently for all: Aug.
for servants as well as for Masters: yet the degrees that be in the world must
be retained and acknowledged to the end of the world.

Masters must have a Sovereignty over their servants, and servants must subject
themselves to their Masters. The Angel said to Hagar being run away from
Sarah her Mistress, Genesis 16.9.
return to thy dame and humble thy self under her hands. Saint Paul here
sends Onesimus to Philemon again.

But how does he send him? Not with a passeport from Constable to Constable:
but with a letter of commendation, and with a request to entertain him. I have
sent him something unwillingly, because I had so good use of him: thou
therefore receive him, not (...), but (...), receive him unto: to thy house,
grace, favor and mercy: pardon all that is past, all the wrongs he has done
to thee, raze them for ever out of the book of thy remembrance: receive him
into the lap of thy love.

There must be a reconciliation between Christians: Colos. 3.12.
all offenses must be buried. As the elect of God put on tender mercies,
forbearing one another, forgiving one another, as GOD in CHRIST has forgiven
us.

1. GOD offers reconciliation to us. If a man put away his Wife, and she become
another man's, shall he return again to her? Ier. 3.1.
thou have played the harlot with many lovers: yet turn again to me says the
LORD. And shall we be so hard hearted, as not to be reconciled one to another?
Let us be merciful, as our heavenly Father is merciful.

2. All we do is abominable in the sight of GOD without it. If thou bring thy
gift to the Altar, and there remembrest that thy brother has ought against
thee, thou should have done it before: yet better late than never: Lay down
thy offering: not upon the Altar, but before the Altar: First be reconciled to
thy brother, then come and offer thy gift: first seek the kingdom of God. GOD
should be first served, yet he will have his own service to stay, till thou
be reconciled to thy brother. 1 Cor. 13.1.
If I speak with the tongues of men and Angels, if I come to Church, hear
never so many Sermons, receive never so many Communions, talk never so
gloriously of Religion, and dwell in hatred, be not reconciled; I am as a
sounding brass and as a tinckling Cymbal.

3. We can have no assurance of our reconciliation to God without it, Matthew.
18. ult. As the King dealt with his servant: So God will cast you into the
prison of hell for ever. This should make us all to quake.

4. We have no certainty of our lives. This night may our souls be taken from
us. Iovinian the Emperor supped plentifully, went to bed merrily: yet was
taken up dead in the morning. And if death take us before we take one another
by the hand, as a token of hearty reconciliation; what shall become of us? Ephesians.
4.2^.
We should not suffer the Sun to go down on our wrath.

Johannes Eleemosynarius Archbishop of Alexandria, being angry in the day
with Nicetus a Senator, toward night sends this message to him: Sol est in
occasu, vir maxim honorande, My honorable brother, the Sun is a setting:
let there be a setting of our anger too: if we do it not within the compass of
a day and a night, yet let us do it within the compass of our lives; let not
our anger be like the fire of the Temple, Ion. 4.7.
that went not out day nor night. Let us not say with Jonah, I do well to be
angry to the death: let our anger be aculeus apis, not aculeus serpentis, the
sting of a Be that is soon gone, not the sting of a Serpent, that tarries
long, and it may be proves lethall. Let us receive one another in all brotherly
love and kindness, as Saint Paul entreats PHILEMON to receive Onesimus.

But who is Onesimus, that PHILEMON should receive him?

Paul's own bowels: he does not say, my own eyes: though they be precious to
us: and we use to term our dear friends Ocelli mei: not my own hands, which
minister to my necessities: my own feet which carry me from place to place:
but my own bowels, our internal and vital parts: the longues, the liver,
especially the heart the seat of love and affection. Whom I do most tenderly
affect: Cathar.
teneritudinem rarissimi amoris declarat, he points out hereby the tenderness
of a most rare love. Phil. 1.8.
As Saint Paul says of the Philippians, I desire you all in the bowels of
JESUS CHRIST. 1. In an hearty love in CHRIST JESUS. One Christian should be
exceeding dear to another.

Col. 3.12.
1. It is a token of election. As the elect of God, put on the bowels of mercy.
Without these bowels, no assurance of salvation.

2. The affinity between Christians require it. We have one Father, which is
GOD: one Mother, the Church: we are of one house, the household of faith: one
Elder brother, which is JESUS CHRIST: one inheritance, the kingdom of heaven.

3. We are all bought with one and the same dear price, the invaluable blood
of CHRIST: therefore we should be dear one to another.

3. Every one is tender over his bowels: our brethren are our bowels: he that
touches them touches our own bowels. Oh that we did so esteem and
commiserate one another! When the child was to be divided by Salomons sword, 1
Reg. 3.26.
the bowels of the true mother yerned within her: So should our bowels do, if
we see any hurt toward our brethren.

VERSE 13.
IN the next place, he unfolds the reason of his sending. 1. Negative: not as
if he had not been useful to him. In that respect he would willingly have
retained him still, that he might have ministered to him in the bonds of the
Gospel.

There be the bonds of impiety; such were Zedekiah his bonds: and there be
the bonds of piety; Such were St. Paul's bonds, not for any sin of his, but
for the Gospel: which were famous throughout all the judgment hall, and in
all other places. Phil. 1.13.


That in thy stead he might do it, (...), for thee: in this he supplies thy
room, and discharges thy office.

The Gospel is the common cause, that concerns us all: if any suffer for it,
we are all bound from the highest to the lowest to assist them with our purses,
our prayers, and personal presence too, if conveniently it may be: yea though
we be never so great personages. 1 Reg. 18.13.
It is like that obadiah himself hid the Prophets in Caves from the rage of
Iesabel, though peradventure he might send the bread and water by his servants.
Ioh. 13.
Our SAVIOR himself washed his Disciples feet. Saint Cyprian writes to the
Priests and Deacons, L. 3. Epist. 6.
to provide all things necessary for them that were in prison, wishing that he
himself were present with them, Promptus and lubens, readily and willingly he
would perform Cuncta dilectionis obsequia, all obsequious duties of love unto
them. Socr. l. 5. c. 17
Helena the mother of Constantine being at Jerusalem served in meat her self
to the Virgins that were there, (...). Placilla the Wife of Theodosius the
Emperor in propria persona pauperibus ministravit, Theod. l. 5. c. 18.
ministered to the poor in her own person: and PHILEMON himself should have
ministered unto Saint Paul. The Angels minister to us, yea when we be in prison,
as to Saint Peter: and shall we scorn be we never so wealthy, worshipful,
honorable, Acts 12.
to minister to them that be in bonds for the Gospel? Let us count it an
honor to us. In ministering to them, we minister to CHRIST, and he will reward
it at the latter day. Mistake me not, Mat. 25.36.
I plead not for them that are buffeted for their faults; nor do I reckon
them to be in bonds for the Gospel, who worthily suffer for their folly.

VERSE 14.
WE have had the negative cause of his sending: not because Saint Paul had no
use of him, but because he would not keep him without his good will: without
thy mind, thy sentence, thy judgment (...), would I do nothing. In hoc
negotio, in this business otherwise: in every thing he would not tie himself
to Philemons mind. Servants must not be detained without their Masters liking.
Eustathius Bishop of Armenia was deposed from his byshop-ricke, quia servos
praetextu pietatis heris abstulerat: because under a color of piety he had
taken servants from their Masters. Socr. l. 2. c. 43.
Therefore the Papists themselves will not permit servants to take upon them a
religious course of life, to vow chastity, Aquin. 2.2. (...) 189. art. 5.
conclus. art. 6. resp. ad. 2. arg. Bell. de Monach. l. 2. c. 36.
without the consent of their masters: yet children may invitis parentibus,
whether their parents will or no, so as they be of age, a man 14. a woman 12.
and that their Parents need not their help. A strange thing that servants may
not, but Children may. But servants may not. Bellar. Reason is without reason,
because Masters have power and authority over their servants: as if Parents had
not as great over their children; and as if Parents might be less regarded,
then Masters: this is well, that servants may not enter into a Monastery
without their Masters consent: but if they be in, who shall bring them out
again? Their Masters may send an hundred times for them, Reg. Fus. interrog.
11.
and go without them. Yet Basil sets it down as a constitution, that after they
have been admonished and made better, remittendi sunt ad dominos, they are to
be sent back to their masters again.

In hoc Paulus imitandus, qui Onesimum Philemoni remisit. In this Paul must be
followed, who sent back Onesimus to Philemon again. We may not keep an horse
or a Cow without the will of the owner, and shall we keep back servants
without the good will of their Masters?

Why would he not do it without his mind? That thy good: (...) for (...), for
good doing. Therefore it is well translated benefit; as Romans 5.7. for a just
man some will dare to dye, (...).i. (...), for a beneficial man.

Not simply of necessity, but with an (...) a tanquam: as it were of
necessity: if he had detayned him to wait upon him without his knowledge;
therefore he thought good to acquaint him with it.

It is a received axiom: quod ex necessitate bonumest, non est bonum; that
which is good of necessity, is not good; yet it is to be understood de
necessitate coacta, of a coacted necessity, not of a voluntary.

God is necessarily good: yet willingly good. Death comes necessarily upon all;
yet some dye willingly. I desire to be dissolved and to be with CHRIST: but the
good which is done upon a constrained necessity, loses the name of good:
patience perforce is no patience. A willing mind in a good action is all in
all. If Solomon had not willingly built the Temple, it had not been pleasing
to God: if the Centurion had not willingly set up the Synagogue, God would not
have respected it: if the Woman of Shunen had not willingly entertained the
Prophet, it had been no good work in the sight of God: if Dorcas had not made
the Coats willingly, they had not been acceptable unto God.

We must distinguish inter fructum and datum, between the fruit and the gift.
Aug. Confess. l. 13. c. 26.
Datum is that which is given, money, meat, raiment: fructus is bona and recta
voluntas datoris, the fruit is the good and upright meaning of the giver. Si
panem dederis tristis, and panem and meritum perdidisti, if thou give thy
bread with an heavy heart, thou have lost thy bread, and thy reward too.

Affectus tuus imponit nomen operi tuo, thy affection gives a denomination to
thy work: Ambr. Off. l. c. 30.
quomodo a te proficiscitur, sic aestimatur. Look with what affection it
proceeds from thee, such estimation has it with God.

GOD loves a willing and cheerful giver: Whosoever is of a willing heart,
Exodus 35.5.
let him bring his offering to the Lord, gold, silver, brass, etc. 2 Cor.
8.12. Col. 3.23.
If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted, be it great or small:
Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily: come to Church heartily, hear Sermons
heartily, receive the Sacraments heartily, pay the Minister his due heartily, give
to the poor heartily. In the building of the Temple it is said, the heart of
the people was with the work: Nehem. 4.6.
Let our hearts be with all that we do: We cannot abide a servant, that does
our work grudgingly; and do ye think God will accept of grudged service?

VERSE 15.
THe third plea is ex part Dei, on Gods part. The wise God in his unsearchable
providence has turned his running away to good. Therefore forgive and forget
it. Here is, 1. A narration of Gods providence in disposing of his flight. 2.
An application of it to Philemon. 3. A conclusion inferred upon it, to receive
him, Verse 17.
GODS providence in this action is set down, 1. Quasi dubitative, something
doubtfully, perhaps. 2. Charitative, charitably; he calls it not a running
away, but a departing. 3. Temporary, temporally, for a time, for a season.


He uses this particle (...), for two causes. 1. because Gods judgments in
themselves are hid in secret, Hierom.
and it is temerity pro certo pronunciare, quod dubium est; to pronounce that
for a certainty, which to us is uncertain. 2. He would not peremptorily avouch
i^, for animating servants to do the like. While it lay hid in Gods secret
counsel, it was doubtful; being revealed, the event shows evidently, that
God has ordained it for singular good, for Onesimus, Paul and PHILEMON too.

(...), for this cause: therefore he went away, that he might be brought into
the right way. God is not author, but ordinator peccati, the author, but orderer
of sin. He brings light out of darkness and good out of evil. Ioseph's
brethren intended his utter extirpation when they sold him into Egypt: yet God
made that the corroboration of his Church. God sent me before for your
preservation. Genesis 45.5.
Onesimus meant nothing less by running away from his master, then to become a
Christian, and a Preacher: yet so it fell out by the admirable dispose of God
Almighty. This is Saint Hieromes Logic; If Onesimus had not fled from his
master, he had not gone to Saint Paul being in prison at Rome: If he had not
gone to Saint Paul, he had not received faith in CHRIST. If he had not had
faith in CHRIST, he had not been Saint Paul's son, nor sent into the work of
the Gospel or Ministry. Therefore we may conclude by degrees, that he was
made a Minister of the Gospel, because he fled from his Master. It is
received by antiquity, that he was advanced to the function of the Ministry;
Hier. Ep. 62.
yet this must be no encouragement unto sin. A wise Physician so tempers
poison, that he makes a sovereigne medicine of it: will thou therefore drink
poison? God can make the sickness of the body the health of the soul: will thou therefore be sick? God can turn our sins to good: 1 Io. 2.1.
shall we therefore sin? God forbid; these things write I unto you that ye
sin not. The crucifying of CHRIST was the salvation of the world: Shall we
therefore crucify CHRIST? All work for the best, to them that love God:
sickness, Romans 8.28.
poverty, death: This is the goodness of God, not the proper effect of them.

Ioseph's imprisonment, proved Ioseph's advancement: Will thou therefore desire
to be in prison? The banishment of Hester was her preferment; will thou
therefore desire to be banished? Saint Augustines going out of his way, was the
saving of his life: for if he had kept his way, he had fallen into the hands
of the Circumcelliones his deadly enemies: Will thou therefore wish to go out
of thy way as thou art traveling?

God turns sin to good, which is a deviation from the Law of God; shall we
therefore sin? The proper fruit of sin is death, yea death everlasting. It
is by accident, through Gods mercy, if any good come of it: therefore let it
be carefully abandoned by us all.

Chrysostom.
He does not say, perhaps he therefore ran away: (...) usus est (...), he uses
a word of better report: he departed, (...), was separated from thee, by the
permissive hand of Gods providence. After that men have repented of their
sins, we must not aggrava^e, but in some measure extenuate them. Not Noah's
drunkenness; 1 Reg. 15.5.
but Noah's unadvised drinking: Not David's adultery with Vriah's wife, but the
matter of Vriah. Not Peter's apostasy, but Peter's denial. Not Onesimus
running away, but departing. Before they be humbled, we must be as Trumpeters
to waken them out of their sins: Isai. 58.1. 1 These. 2.7.
Lift up thy voice as a trumpet: After that we must be as Nurses to cherish
them: before Corazives; after lenitives: before, we must come with the Law as
a Schoolmaster to whip them; after, with the Gospel to comfort them: before
we must be Bonerges, 2 Cor. 2.5.
the sons of thunder: after Barnabasses the sons of consolation.

But for how long did he depart? (...), for an hour. It is the last hour. Our
whole life is but an hour, in respect of eternity: The whole race of our life,
is but the running of an houre-glasse, and a short houre-glasse too, a spanne
long. There was a woman that had an issue of blood twelve years; an other that
was bowed by Satan eighteen years; a man diseased in his feet 38. years:
all in comparison of eternity was but an hour. Endure with cheerfulness an
hours pain here, that thou may have eternal joy hereafter.

Having made a narration of Gods providence in his flight, he makes an
application of it to Philemon. 1. Showing the end of it to be, that he might
receive him with advantage. 2. Declaring the manner how he should receive him.
Verse 16.

(...) 1. a fuga, from his flight. 2. a me, from me. 3. a Deo, from GOD. In all
these respects, let him be welcome unto thee.

But for how long? not for a season, as before, but for ever. Some interpret it
for ever.i. to serve thee for ever, so long as ye both shall live: alluding to
that place; If the servant say thus, Exodus 21.5.
I love my Master, I will not go out free, then his Master shall bring him to
the Judges, set him to the post, bore his ear through with an awle, and he
shall serve him for ever.i. to the year of Iubilee. So that he should serve
Philemon for ever.i. during life: that is not suitable to the place. 1. The
opposition requires it should be taken for eternity. He departed for a while;
but thou shall receive him for ever. 2. In the Greek it is an Adjective, not
an Adverbe, that thou should receive him, (...) eternal: not only for a
time in this world: but also to reign eternally with CHRIST, together with thy
self, and the rest of his Saints, being now engraffed into CHRIST by faith, as
thou art. This implies the resurrection of the body: for if Onesimus should not
rise again, Ter. De resur. car.
he could not be eternal. Idoneus est reficere, qui fecit; he that made the
body of nothing, can remake it, when it is consumed to nothing. The faithful
are omnipotentes in CHRISTO, omnipotent in CHRIST. I can do all things by
JESUS CHRIST that strengthens me: that is Luther's collection: and they be
aeterni in CHRISTO, Phil. 4.13.
eternal in CHRIST. In CHRIST we shall all be made alive again, meet him in
the air, be translated with him into the Kingdom of glory, and abide with him
for ever. The wicked are eternal too: they in endless torments; the godly in
endless joys, which neither eye has seen, nor ear heard; nor can enter
into the heart of man.

VERSE 16.
But how is he to receive him? not now, because an alteration is made in him
now, as a Servant. He does not speak it in contempt of servants. Dominus and
servus diversa nomina: Aug.
sed homines and homines paria sunt nomina. Master and servant are diverse
names: In Psalm. 124.
but men and men are equal names. Thou art a man, a weak man, a sinful man,
as well as thy servant: therefore despise not thy servant. One may go to
heaven as well out of the degree of a servant: as of a master. Let none of you
suffer as a thief: there the name of thief is a contemptible name: 1 Pet.
4.15.
so is not the name of a servant here: when as he says, not as a servant, non
ut servum tantum, not as a servant only. Joseph esteemed Mary not as a Wife:
but as a woman greatly honored by God, to be the mother of him, that was both
GOD and man: yet he esteemed her as his Wife. So here.

What then? but above a servant. Why? a brother: and a brother is more than a
servant. We are all brethren: maxim cum fides accedit media, Ambr.
qua omnem superbiam amputat, especially when faith conjoynes us together,
which is as a knife to cut off all pride. In CHRIST there is neither bond nor
free, Gal. 3.28.
but we are all one in CHRIST JESUS. The Father and the Son are brethren: the
Minister and the people are brethren, if they believe in Christ. So also the
Master and the servant are brethren: we have one Father which is God; one
mother, the Catholic Church: one elder brother, which is JESUS CHRIST; one
inheritance, the kingdom of heaven: we are all brethren: and godly servants are
to be used by their masters as brethren.

Before, Paul called Onesimus his Son, Verse 10. Now his brother: in the one
(...); in the other (...): in the one is manifested his natural affection; in
the other his benevolence and equality.

What brother? a beloved brother: beloved of all good Christians, but
especially of Saint Paul, who was his Father, as well as his brother: upon that
he inferres he should be more beloved of PHILEMON, because he is tied to him
with two bonds: to St. Paul but with one.

The one in the flesh, the other in the LORD. Grace alone knit him to Saint
Paul: grace and nature too to Philemon. By the flesh is meant Carnal
affinity; by the LORD spiritual. Onesimus was Saint Paul's only in the Spirit:
he is PHILEMONS in the spirit and in the flesh too: they be near to us in the
flesh, that be near in carnal and outward considerations; as man and wife:
brethren, kins-folke, country men, Townsmen, of one house or one family. Genesis
29.14.
Laban said to Jacob, thou art my bone and my flesh: the fire warmes them most
that be nearest to it. GOD is more beneficial to the good Angels, then to men,
because they be nearer to him then men: in nature, spirits, as he is: in
quality, of greater holiness than men: in place, because they be with him in
the Court of heaven. Our kindness, si caeteris paribus, if other things be
correspondent, should extend it self more to them, that be nearest to us in
the flesh. 1 Io. 3.17.
He that has this worlds wealth, and sees his brother want: So he that has
this worlds wealth, and sees them that be near to him in the flesh, especially
if there be neerenesse in the spirit too: how dwells the love of God in him?

Matthew. 12.48.50.
Nevertheless the spiritual affinity is (in some regards) to be preferred
before all. Who is my Father, my Mother, says Christ? he that does the will
of my Father in heaven, he is my Mother, brother, and Sisters.

VERSE 17.
THen he concludes the receiving of him, with a kind of adjuration. If thou
have me, (...), in thy opinion and judgment: it is well translated, if thou
count me: What? a partner, (...), one of the same county together with thy
self, of the same communion of Saints, of the same household of faith: he
does not say, if thou count me a Prelate, a ruler of the Church, but a partner:
he is content to be unus ex illis, non supra illos, to be one of them, part
and part like, not one above them. The Angels count us partners. I am thy
fellow servant, Apoc. 19 10.
and one of thy brethren: CHRIST counts us partners, Heb. 2.14. and shall we
disdain to call one another partners?

There be partners in nature, so are we all: partakers of the same air, of
the same water, of the fruits of the same earth, partakers of misery, and of
death: there be partners in office, as Churchwardens, and Constables: they
that answer for a child at the font are called partners.

There be partners in grace; partakers of the divine nature, 2 Pet. 1.4.
not of the substance, but of the qualities of it: partakers of one Christ, of
one heaven. Such a partner did St. Paul desire to be accounted: and happy are
they, that be in this partnership: He is very earnest with Philemon; as Lydia
was with Paul and Silas. Acts 16.15.
If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house: they
durst not but count her faithful to the Lord: and Philemon durst not but count
Saint Paul a partner. Now receive Onesimus, or exclude me out of thy
partnership: he pressed sore upon him.

But how should he receive him? As my self: as my own bowels. Thou would
receive me affectuose and reverenter, with a loving affection and with
reverence; so receive him. Pape! Oecumen.
quanta verbi dignitas! Good Lord, how does he dignifie Philemon by it? O
admirable love! especially to a fugitive and a servant.

VERSE 18.
THe last argument to persuade the receiving of him, is ex part debiti;
concerning the debt, which he owes, and wrong that he has done to him: which
he would have to be no hinderance to the business. Where, 1. There is a
concession of the wrong and debt. 2. St. Paul's undertaking for the satisfaction
of it, Verse 18. 3. A confirmation or strengthening of the satisfaction. 4. An
amplification of the satisfaction, Verse 19.


Injured thee (...) in any thing: or owes thee, namely, ought.

Wherein we have confitentem reum, he himself with tears has acknowledged
it to me. So that the particle ( If) here is not nota dubitantis, but
concedentis. At his departure, as fugitive servants are wont to do, he carried
away with him a piece of Plate, or some other thing: if he have so done, as I
know he has, impute it to me: set it on my account, I will be countable for
it and discharge all.

Here first, we see that restitution must be made of wrong. Restituere (as
Aquinas does well define it) est aliquem iterato in possessionem and dominium
rei substituere. 2 a. 2 ae. art. 20. quaest. 62.
Restitution is a constitution of a man in the right possession of the thing
again.

The wrongs whereof restitution is to be made, are bona animi, corporis, famae
and fortunae: the goods of the mind, if we have heene the means of the
distraction of any: the goods of the body, if we have wounded any: the goods of
fame, if we have defamed any: the goods of fortune, as we call them, but
indeed the blessings of God: this text leads us only to the latter. If we
have wronged any this way, let us be careful to make restitution: non
remittitur peccatum, Aug. Ep. 54.
nisi restituatur ablatum, sin is not remitted, unless the thing taken away
be restored.

1 It is Gods precept: if the wicked have restored the pledge, and given again
that which he has robbed: Ezekiel. 33.15.
till restitution be made, he remains as a thief and robber.

Mat. 27.3.
2 Judas made restitution, he brought again the thirty pieces of silver: they
are worse than Judas that make no restitution.

3 The thing remaining, unless it be restored, will ruinate thee and thy house
too. The taking away of Naboths Vineyard, was the overthrow of Ahab and his
house.

1 Samuel 12.3.
If we have so lived, that we may make Samuels challenge at our dying-day, whose
Ass or Ox have I taken? to whom have I done wrong? It is a sweet thing, yet a
rare thing; if our conscience tells us, we have wronged any, let us make
satisfaction for the wrong.

De quanto, how much is to be restored, we will not curiously dispute: at the
least simplum, the same thing, if it be possible: if not, yet something
equivalent thereunto, and according to the quantity of the wrong: if the party
have sustained much wrong by a long detention of it, then duplum or triplum, as
the Schoolmen speak. Zacheus offers a fourefold restitution: Luke 19.8.
the which he does not by the way of supererogation, as Aquinas will have it:
but in an extraordinary fervent zeal, for the demonstration of the efficacy of
his conversion.

The person, to whom restitution is to be made, is the party himself, if he be
alive; or else his heirs: Et ubi non est haeres, ecclesia haeres, De vita
Constable. lib.
says Eusebius, where there is no heir, the Church is heir.

But in any case, let restitution be made, and that with as great expedition as
may be: Aquinas.
for nec per modicum tempus in peccato morandum, for there is no dwelling in
sin, no not a small time. Lactantius affirms of the Romans, Lib. acephal.
si restitutionem facerent, ad casas and egestatem reverterentur, if they
should make restitution, they must come to poor Cottages, instead of their
magnificent Palaces. So would many, it is to be feared, if they made
restitution of all wrongs, especially, to the poor Church, which has been
wronged in all Ages.

2 Here it is apparent, that debts are to be paid. Rather than Philemon should
be unpaid, Saint Paul will pay him: a matter of greater moment than we are
aware of. 1. It must be preferred before our living and maintenance. When the
Prophet had made a bountiful provision of Oil for the poor Widow, 2 Reg.
4.7.
he gives her this charge; go sell the Oil, pay them thou art in debt unto;
and live thou and thy children of the rest. We may not live, we, and our
children, on that, which is another man's: that is an unlawful living, and Gods
blessing cannot be expected on it. 2. GOD will have his own worship to give
place unto it; I will have mercy, not sacrifice. We may not sacrifice to GOD of
that which is another man's. The Athenians came to Phocion for money toward a
solemn sacrifice; to whom he returned this answer: (...). It were a shame for
me to give to you, and not to pay this man, (pointing out his creditor) that
which I owe him. GOD will have thee to serve him with thine own, not with that
which is other men's: yet small reckoning is made of it. We go a borrowing with
Asahels feet: a paying with Mephibosheths. Augustus Caesar would needs buy the
Senators bed, that slept so securely, being so much in debt: he wondered how he
could sleep: it never breaks our sleep: we take thought how to borrow; none
to pay.

VERSE 19.
HE gives him a bill of his hand for it. I Paul have written it with my own
hand. Noverint universi per praesentes, me Paulum firmiter teneri and obligari,
etc. Thou have my word and my hand too: therefore doubt not of it. I, but what
is Saint Paul's word or his bond worth? he made many rich; yet he himself was
poor: his wealth consisted in a cloak, a few books and parchments. Though
his estate was not great: yet his credit was great. He could take up upon his
bare word among well disposed Christians many hundred pounds.

I will repay it. It is my own debt now, and I will see it discharged: we
ought to be mervailous circumspect, before we give our word or bond for any. He
is a fool in the judgment of wise Solomon, that does it rashly, he is worthy
of no favor: take his garment that is surety for a stranger, take his bed from
under him. Prove. 20.16.22, 26.
Before he was a free man, now he is a bondsman: nay he is taken in the snare
of his own mouth: he is as a bird in a snare. Let us look carefully before
we leap. The best cast at dice, say some, 6, 2.
is to cast them quite away: the best surety is, not to be surety for any:
Prove. 11.15.
he that hates suretiship, is sure: but if we be once in bonds, let us labor
to unbinde our selves so soon as we can: as dear, to deliver our selves out
of the hands of the hunter, Prove. 6.5.
and as birds, out of the hand of the fowler.

Regulus, though an heathen, stood to his word, to the death.

If we did live as it becomes Christians, there should need no greater bond,
then the word of a Christian. The saying is, by the word of a King: who would
not take a Kings word, so royal are they in their performances? CHRIST has
made us all Kings, to GOD his Father: therefore we should have a singular care
of any of our bare words: though the witnesses dye, yet God that heard our
word, lives for ever. But we are fallen into such an age, that many men's bonds
are of no validity. Sampson broke the coards: and some break the seals of
green wax at their pleasure: they make no account of paper or partchment
bonds, till they be cast into iron bonds. Some put their hands and seals to a
writing, that make no conscience of the accomplishment of that, which they have
written.

They are content to go so far with Pilate, as to acknowledge their hand
writing; what I have written, I have written: but they will not say, what I
have written, I will perform.

Saint Paul was of another mind; as he gave him his hand for the payment, so
he gives him his heart and faithful promise to pay it: I will repay it.

Then there follows a mitigation, not an abrogation of the debt.

Albeit I do not say, quamvis veraciter dicere possem, says Carthusian,
though I might truly say it, how thou owe to me a far greater matter than
this, even thine own self also or besides.

That which the Minister receives of us, is not a benevolence; but a debt: you
are bound to pay it, for you owe it.

But what is it that we owe to the Ministers and Preachers?

1. Love, not a single, but a singular love, (...), an overabundant, 1 These.
5.13.
and overflowing love. Nebridius said of Saint Augustine, that he did nimium
amare, and was nimium amatus: he loved too much, and the people loved him too
much. Where is that nimium now, especially on the peoples side?

2. We owe them reverence. Herod reverenced John Baptist. Alexander honored
Iaddus the high Priest, Joseph.
to the admiration of all his followers. Epist. 26. de obitu Val. Epist. 27.
Gratian wrote letters to Saint Ambrose with his own hands. Valentin the elder
called him father. Valentin the younger, though an Arrian, rose up to him in
token of reverence, when he came into the Consistory.

Cornelius gave too much respect to Saint Peter: we give too little to Saint
Peter, and Saint Paul too.

3. We owe them maintenance. Who goes to warfare on his own cost? 1 Cor. 9.6.
Who planteth a vineyard and eats not of the fruit thereof? Who feeds a
flock, and eats not of the milk thereof? yet many great cowes in many
parishes, that give little milk to the shepherds: nonne vides arcam inanem
praepositi tui? In Psalm 33. Epist. 155. (...).
says Saint Augustine, do not see his chest empty that is over thee in the
Lord? Saint Basil complains of want. Nazianzen says of himself, that he
was, (...), a little, and a poor shepherd: the like complaint may many
painful Preachers take up in England.

4. We owe them obedience. Hebr. 13.17. Ios. 1.16.
Obey them that have the oversight of you, and submit your selves. As the
people said to Joshua, so must we say to the Preacher in the pulpit speaking to
us in the name of God: all that thou command us we will do: and
whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go: if they command us, to go out of
the Church, we will do it: but if they command us to observe the orders of the
Church, we will not do it: we will give them the hearing, but not the obeying:
nay, we will hear at our leisure, and do at our pleasure.

Wonderful is the debt we owe to the Ministers: wonderful is our negligence
in paying of it: we owe them our goods. Gal. 6.6. Gal. 4.15. Romans 16.4.
He that is taught in the word, make him that teaches him, partaker of all his
goods: we owe them our eyes: we owe them our lives. Priscilla and Aquila laid
down their necks for Saint Paul. We owe them our selves, as it is in this
place: for we have the salvation of our souls and bodies from them.
Instrumentally they be called Saviors. In so doing, Obad. 21. 1 Timothy 4.16.
thou shall save thy self and them that hear thee.

VERSE 20.
HAving used his Christian Rhetoric for the receiving of Onesimus, he shuts
up that his suite and petition, first with a vehement obsecration in this
Verse, then with a confident presumption in the next.

(...) Yea, the Greek particle ((...)) answers to the Hebrew Nah, or Annah,
says Hieronymus. Est quoddam adverbium blandientis, Erasmus.
a flattering or fawning adverb, if we may so term it: est vox obtestantis,
per eam adjurat Philemonem, thereby he does insinuate himself into Philemon.

(...): alluding to the name of Onesimus, that signifies profitable, or
pleasant: let me have joy of thee in receiving of him: if thou grant my
request, thou joyest me at the very heart; if thou deny it, thou make me a
sorrowful man and without heart.

The people ought so to carry themselves, that the Ministers may have joy of
them; that they may watch over you with joy, Hebr. 13.17.
not with grief: for that is unprofitable even for you. Let us not grieve them
by our notorious sins, by our malevolent tongues, smiting Jeremy with the
tongue: by an injurious detaining of their right from them. Let us add to
their joy what we can, not to their grief. Yet some perverse and froward
people deal with their Ministers, Genesis 26.35.
as Esau did with Isaac and Rebeccah, make them weary of their lives.

Why? what joy? refresh my bowels in the Lord. Some think he calls Onesimus
his bowels: he rather speaks of his own bowels. If thou receive him, thou
shall make my very bowels to leap in me for joy. So acceptable a thing will it
be to me. We refresh the bowels of the Saints diverse ways.

1. By meat and drink. So did Cornelius. 2. By clothing them. So did Dorcas.
3. By comfortable words. So did Elkanah Hannah. 4. By loving deeds. So PHILEMON
refreshed Saint Paul, by a kind receiving of Onesimus at his request: Let us
all refresh one another here, that we may all meet in the place of eternal
refreshing hereafter.
VERSE 21.
THen he closes it up with an holy presumption. Trusting, not (...), sed (...),
not in thy hearing, but in thy obeying, whereof I have had already comfortable
experience: knowing that thou will not only do this, but a greater matter, if
I shall request it of thee, more than I say. A good and a religious people will
not only do that which the Preacher requires: but more too. Exodus 36.5.
Moses desired but so much as would serve for the tabernacle, 2 Reg. 5.22.
yet the Israelites brought more. Gehazi in the name of Elisha (yet he abused
his name) requested but one talent, Naaman gave him two.

Saint Paul entreated the Corinthians to contribute to the poor Saints at
Jerusalem to their ability: yet they gave (...), above their power or
ability: but it were well now adays, if the people would do so much as the
Ministers require, though they did no more. We desire kind usage: no
surplusage.

VERSE 22.
THe conclusion of the Epistle. Which has three branches: An invitation in
this Ver. A salutation, 23.24. A valediction. 25. In the invitation. 1. There
is the substance of it. 2. The reason of it: the substance is this; but
withal, preparing me a lodging. This makes for Onesimus, says Chrysostom,
because St. Paul himself will come shortly, and then he shall see what is, and
has been the usage of him.

(...): together with other private matters, which I will not insist in: (make
ready) to thy former favors add this also. A lodging. Such as strangers are
wont to have. Saint Hierom is of opinion, that he would have him to prepare an
house for him in the midst of the City, a large and a spacious house:
because, especially after his imprisonment, a great number would flock to his
preaching: yet it is very like that St. Paul means a lodging in his own house,
because there he might be boldest, and because it was a religious and well
ordered house. Saint Chrysostom collects from hence, that Philemons house was
(...) an Inn for all Saints. It might be so very well, as Gaius was St. Paul's
host, and the host of the Church too. Howsoever, Cajet.
St. Paul would have him to prepare a lodging for him there: not as if he
needed so great preparation; a little would content him, and his train should
not be great: but he speaks it ad amplitudinem fiduciae, and majoris
familiaritatis spem; for a declaration of the confidence he had in him, and a
demonstration of the familiarity, that was between them: prepare me also a
lodging.

No doubt but when Philemon read this clause of the letter, he gave an echo in
mind, saying, I will, Paul, with all my heart: thou shall be exceeding welcome
to men we should be all willing to receive CHRIST'S members, chiefly his
Ministers, into our houses: our houses shall prosper the better for it. The
Shunamitish woman got a Son to her great joy, by entertaining of Elisha.
Za^heus gained by CHRIST'S coming to his house: by it he was made the Son of
Abraham.

We never read that Gaius had the less for keeping open house to the faithful.

Ambrose that noble man, which kept Origin in his house, was the more beloved
of God, and the more renowned in the world. Cassianus St. Ignatius his host
has his name by that propagated to ^ll posterity. If any Paul's come to us; Ad
Mariam Cassabolitam.
let us do as Zacheus did, come down hastily, and receive them joyfully: and
Christ will lodge you in his house at the latter day, Matthew. 25.35.

Then follows the reason of it, because I am in great hope to come to thee
shortly. Philemon happily might reply; do thou speak for a lodging, Paul?
thou art lodged already, being in pri^on. I, but says he, I trust to be
dislodged of that shortly: which is ^llustrated by the isntrumental, and the
efficient cause: the isntrumental is their prayer; the efficient, Gods
goodness in delivering him out of prison.

Through your prayers: not say, through my prayers, but yours, in modesty
ascribing more to theirs, then to his own. And indeed, the prayers of all
religious persons avail much, if they be fervent. By the prayer of Moses the
red Sea was divided: Water gushed out of an hard and stony rock: Iac. 5.16.
by the prayer of Joshua the Sun stood still; till he had gotten the victory
over his enemies: the prayer of the three children quenched the violence of the
raging fire: the prayer of Daniel stopped the mouths of the Lions: the prayer
of Jonah brought him out of the Whales belly; the prayers of the Church brought
Saint Peter out of prison, and their prayers here bring Saint Paul out of
prison. Eusebius. l. 5. c. 5.
When Marcus Aurelius Verus, the Emperor, was in Germany, there was such a
drought in the army, as that man and beast was like to perish: the legion
called Melitina, afterward Iulianea, being Christians, fell down on their
knees in the open field, sent up a piercing prayer to heaven. Immediately there
fell such abundance of rain, as made a gracious supply to the comfort of them
all. De doctr. Christ. l. 1. initio.
Saint Augustine writes of a certain Barbarian servant, which was made a
Christian, who never learned to read, yet by three days prayers obtained so
much of God, that he could read the bible, to the admiration of those that were
with him.

This should encourage us all to pray for our selves, and others too. Say on my
mother, said Solomon to Bathshebah, I will not say thee nay. So God by the
secret inspiration of the spirit speaks to us; say on my children, I will not
say you nay: ascendit precatio; descendit miseratio.

Aug.
We have had the isntrumental cause: now to the efficient, which was Gods
grace and mercy. He does not say, your prayers shall merit my delivery: but
through your prayers I shall be given to you. In the Greek, not (...), but
(...), of Gods free and undeserved goodness. Prayer is a sacrifice well
pleasing and acceptable to God. I will lift up my hands as an evening
sacrifice: yet it is not meritorious. Psalm. 141.2.
When we have done all we can, prayed as attentively, as zealously as we can;
we are unprofitable servants: and we had need to pray to God to forgive the
weakness of our prayers.

VERSE 23.
THe second member of the conclusion is salutations sent to him from those
which were with Saint Paul: of whom the one is a prisoner, the rest at
liberty, 24.

The prisoner is Epaphras. Hierom says it is an Hebrew name. Epaphras
frugifer, In hunc locum.
of spharah, fructificare: and indeed he was full of the fruits of
righteousness, by JESUS CHRIST. Why may it not be a Greek name, Col. 4.12.
he being a Grecian, one of Colosse? (...) of (...), expono. He was a Preacher
and good expositour of Scriptures, a faithful Minister of CHRIST.

My fellow prisoner: (...), one that was (...), cuspide captus, taken with the
spear, a captive in War. So these were taken by the spear of Satan, and
Nero his bloody instrument. Before, Col. 1.7.
he called him (...) his fellow servant: now his fellow prisoner, which is
more: for all his fellow servants were not his fellow prisoners. Saint Paul
gives him this as a more honorable title. It is a greater dignity to suffer
for Christ, Phil. 1.29.
then simply to believe in CHRIST.

It is no honor to be fellows in evil, as Simeon and Levi were brethren in
cruelty: Genesis 49.5.
but in good and commendable things it is. My fellow-Iudge, my fellow-Bayliffe,
my fellow-Alderman; especially, fellow-prisoner in CHRIST JESUS. To be
Barabbas's fellow-prisoner is an ignominious thing: but to be S. Paul's
fellow-prisoner is a glorious thing. Let us not be fellow prisoners in the
Devil, as Traitors, Thieves, Murderers, Jesuits: but if we be fellow prisoners
in CHRIST JESUS, let us rejoice in it, 1 Pet. 4.16.
and glorify God on that behalf.

Unto this may be applied the vulgar saying, Est aliquid socios habuisse
doloris, It is a comfort to have a fellow-prisoner in a good cause. They may
pray together: sing Psalms together: confer together: edify one another:
comfort one another. Jeremy was alone in the Dungeon, his sorrow was the
greater. S. Paul has a fellow with him in prison at Rome, his sorrow is the
lesser.

VERSE 24.
THe other that be at liberty, are in number four. The first, is Marcus: John
was his Christen name, Mark, Acts 12 25.
was his surname. Saint Hierome interprets Mark to be sublimis, High; of [Rum]
elevare, To lift up: he was lifted up by GOD to the Sacred Office of the
Ministry. There be three things that tend to his commendation. 1. His
consanguinity with Barnabas, which was a Levite, a great benefactour to the
Church, Acts 4.10.
Saint Paul's especial friend, and is entitled the Son of Consolation: he
was his sitters Son. 2. Is the piety of his Mother; her name was Marie, in
whose house the Saints were assembled, and prayed for Saint Peter, when he was
in prison. Acts 12.12.
3. His own industry and forwardness in accompanying St. Paul and Barnabas,
whose Minister he was: yet there is one thing that is a stain in this fair
cloth: that is, his departing from Paul and Barnabas. He went not through with
them in the work, Acts 13.13
left them in the plain field, and returned to Jerusalem: which was an
occasion of a great falling out between these two worthy Men. Nevertheless,
Acts 15 38.
by all probability he repented of it, and became a more painful labourer
afterward: for at this present he was of good reputation in the Church: else
Saint Paul would not have set him in the forefront of his salutation.

The second is Aristarchus. Mons operis amplioris, says Hierome. [Har] mons:
and Magnaseh, opus: a Mountain of a more ample work: he was of Macedonia, and
a Thessalonian: Acts 27.2. Col. 4.10.
he was Saint Paul's prison-fellow, when he wrote to the Colossians: but now at
liberty.

The third is Demas. Sileas says Hierome of [Dum] silere, he was dumb, and
too much silent: or (...) of (...), quasi (...) popularis: he was a popular
Man, a man-pleaser: he loved the praise of men, more than the praise of God.
Saint Paul sets a brand of infamy upon him, 2 Timothy 4.10.
Demas has forsaken me, and embraced the present World. But at this time he
was in good account with Saint Paul: otherwise he would not have done him so
much honor, as to place him before Luke. Dorotheus reports, he became an
Idolatrous Priest; and Cajetan calls him an Apostate. But if this Epistle were
written after the second to Timothy, as it has the after place; then
undoubtedly GOD gave him repentance, he returned to CHRIST and to Saint Paul
again. Ad Mariam Cassabolitam.
Insomuch, as Ignatius reports, that he was afterward Bishop of Magnesia.
Howsoever that caveat may be profitable for all: Let him, that thinks he
stands, take heed lest he fall. Apoc. 9.1.
A great Star fell from heaven: the greatest of all may fall if GOD support
them not with the hand of his Spirit. Therefore let us all have an eye to our
standing.

The fourth is Luke. Ipse consurgens: of [Luz] ipse [Kum] surgere. And indeed
he rose to great estimation in the Church: he is low, ultimus; sed dignitate
primus: the last in place, the first in dignity. Hier. procem. in Mat. Iguat.
ad Ephesians. Romans 2.16.
He was a Syrian by Nation, and of Antiochia; Saint Paul his Disciple: Hic est
ille frater, cujus laus est in Evangelio; this is that brother whose praise is
in the Gospel, throughout all the Churches, 2 Cor. 8.18. When Saint Paul
says, according to my Gospel, he means, S. Lukes Gospel.

Eusebius. l. 3. c. 4.
He did Evangelizare calamo and lingua: he preached by his pen, in writing a
Gospel, and the History of the Acts: they be both eloquently written. He
preached also with his tongue, as Epiphan. records, Anacephalaiosis lib. 2.
c. 43.
in Dalmatia, Galatia, Italia, Macedonia. Nicephorus affirms, that he was an
excellent painter, another Apelles: surely he painted out Christ in lively
colors sundry kind of ways: this we are sure of, Col. 4.14.
he was a Physician, and greatly beloved too. Luke the beloved Physician,
saluteth you: a Physician for the body and the soul too, l. 7. c. 32.
which is more than ordinary. Eusebius makes mention of one Theodotus a Bishop,
that was both Medicus and Theologus, a Physician and a Divine too. Paul says
of one of them, (...)? who is sufficient for Divinity alone? he must needs be a
rare man, that is sufficient for both.

These be they that send commendations to him, whom he dignifies with this
Title: my Fellow Laborers, or Fellow-workemen: Some in the calling of
Christianity: some in the calling of the Ministry too. Both are works, both
are labors. Nomen Christiani est nomen operis, says S. Augustine: and S. Paul
says, he that desires the office of a Bishop, 1 Timothy 3.1.
desires a worthy work.

Here a common place of salutations does not only salute us, but inviteth us
unto it. In Greek, saluting is a kind of embracing; (...), because whom we
salute we embrace with the arms of love: or at the least pretend it. In
Latin, Salutare est salutem optare, to salute, is to wish health and
prosperity to the parties whom we salute.

The Anabaptists are not only unchristian, but uncivil also to condemn
salutations. 2 Reg. 4.29.
Indeed, Elisha willed his man, that if he met with any, he should not salute
him: Luke 10.4.
and CHRIST charges his Disciples to salute none by the way. Iudic. 6.12. Luke
1.28.
Those were in matters of extraordinary importance, which required great
expedition: otherwise we may, and ought to salute.

Angels salute. The Lord is with thee thou valiant man, says he to Gideon:
hayle Mary freely beloved, says Gabriel to the Blessed Virgin.

CHRIST would not have his Apostles to be so unmannerly, Luke 10.12.
to go into an house, and not to salute it: he himself salutes after his
resurrection: peace be unto you. Saul went forth to meet Samuel, Luke 24.36. 1 Samuel 13.10.
and saluted him. Though Nabal was a churl and a fool too, yet David would
not deal so foolishly with him, as not to salute him. 1 Samuel 25.5.
Thus shall you say, for salutation. There is a sweet echo of salutations
between Boaz and his reapers: the Lord be with you, says he: Ruth. 2.4. 1 Samuel 30.21
the Lord bless thee, say they. David saluted his soldiers. The greatest
think no scorn to salute the meanest.

I but whom must we salute? All. We must love all, pray for all, even for our
very enemies. Now saluting is nothing else save an intimation of love, a kind
of praying and well wishing: therefore we must salute all. I but Saint John
gives us other counsel: Ioh. ep. 2. v. 10
If any come to you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not to house,
neither bid him God speed: We must not vouchsafe him a (...). We must
distinguish between gods enemies and our own: if they be notorious, open
professed adversaries to CHRIST, as those were, we ought not to afford them a
kind salutation: nay if an Angel from heaven should preach any other doctrine,
Gal. 1.8.
we should hold him accursed. But if they be secret adversaries and unknown,
it is not impiety to salute them. Some are so rigid that they will not salute a
stranger, because they know not whereabout he goes.

1. It is repugnant to charity. Love thinks not evil: 1 Cor. 13.5. v. 7.
it believes all things. It is greater charity in things doubtful to believe
the best, then the worst.

2. As Aristotle, being reproved for giving an alms to a wicked man, answered,
(...), Laert.
I had compassion of the man, not of his manners: so we salute the man, not
his life; we bid the man, God speed, not his actions.

But how are we to salute? 1. For the external manner, by word of mouth, or by
writing. Saint Paul omits salutations in never a one of his Epistles: but in
Romans 16. he is most plentiful in them: So is Ignatius. Ad Mariam Cassabolitam.


Commendations are requisite in our letters, if they be not made
commendations, matters of course not greatly regarded.

2. For the internal manner, we must salute sincerely, not hypocritically: it
must be Saint Paul's hail, not Judas his hail. Greet one another with an
holy kiss. They must be holy, not unholy greetings. The end of salutations is,
the preservation of love, Matthew. 26.49 1 Cor. 16.20.
which by all good means had need to be maintained by Christians: and a
demonstration of the respect we have one of another.

VERSE 25.
THe last branch of the conclusion is, a Valediction or farewell: he takes his
leave with a short, yet a sweet prayer: where, 1. There is the substance of it,
then the sealing of it. In the substance,

1. Res optata, the thing wished or prayed for, which is grace, love, mercy,
favor. Grace must be Alpha and Omega, the beginning and ending of every work.
Saint Paul began with it, and he ends with it.

2. Cujus sit gratia, whose grace it is: of our Lord Jesus Christ which has
brought us into grace and love with God, who before were his enemies and out of
grace: which has graciously redeemed us from sin, death, hell and damnation;
and has opened to us the doors of the kingdom of heaven.

3. Cui optatur, to whom it is wished: not to Philemon alone, but to all that
were with him. Be with your spirit. Man consists of two parts, Hierom.
a soul and a body: here by a Synecdoche, melior pars pro toto, the better
part is put for the whole: be with your spirit.i. with you.

The grace of CHRIST is to be preferred before the grace of all earthly Kings
and Princes.

1. Their grace is mutable: to day in grace, to morrow out of grace. As Haman
was with Ahasucrus, and Belisarius with Justinian. CHRIST is not mutable.

2. They dye: CHRIST lives for ever: CHRIST lives for ever: the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ be with us all.

Then he seals his prayer with, Amen. Nec Graecum est, nec Latinum, In Ioh.
tract. 41.
says Aug. it is neither a Greek word, nor a Latin, but an Hebrew word: and
mansit non interpretatum, and by the providence of God remains, in all tongues
uninterpreted, ne vilesceret nudatum, least happily being unfolded it should be
less esteemed: as Hallelujah, Hosanna, etc.

It is particula confirmantis, a particle of confirmation; as Saint Ambrose
well observes. In Psalm. 40.
So be it. So be it. The Lord grant, it may be so. It must in a fervent zeal,
be the shutting up of all our prayers. Nehem. 8.6.
It is doubled by the people; when Ezra praised the Lord, the great God, all
the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands, Lam. 3.41.
and no doubt their heart too. As the Church says, we will lift up our hearts
with our hands to God in the heavens. If the hand be lifted up without the
heart, it is an hypocritical Amen, and unacceptable unto God.

The end of this Commentary.
A COMMENTARY UPON THE EPISTLE OF St PAUL to the Hebrews.
FIRST, the inscription of the Epistle. Secondly, the substance of it. In the
Inscription there are four things: 1. What it is which is written: 2. Who
wrote it: 3. In what tongue he wrote it: 4. To whom it was written. Two of them
are expressed, and two of them are necessarily to be supplied.

The thing written is an Epistle, that which is sent. If we cannot go to men,
and speak to them by word of mouth, we may send a Letter to them, and speak
to them by writing. The Author of this Epistle, at this time could not
conveniently go to the Jews, therefore he writes to them.

Secondly, who wrote it: there is great controversy about that: some, and
those very learned and godly men, will not be persuaded, that this is S. Paul's
Epistle.

1 Because it wants S. Paul's hand and seal, 2 These. 3.17.
The salutation of me Paul, with my own hands, this I write in all my
Epistles. S. Paul is wont to put his name to all his Epistles; this has not
St. Paul's name, neither in the beginning nor in the ending; neither in the
forehead, nor in the foot. Therefore it is none of S. Paul's.

But that is easily answered. In wisdom, he concealed his name, Quia fuit
Iudaeis exosum, etiam ad fidem conversis; if they had seen his name, they
would have hurled away his Epistle, because they took him to be an enemy to
the Law.

2 They cannot be induced to think that S. Paul was the Penman of this
Epistle, Heb. 2.3.
because he puts himself in the Catalogue of them that were the Apostles
Scholars: whereas S. Paul is wont to stand upon his credit and reputation in
that behalf; that he learned nothing of any man; that he was nothing inferior
to the chief of the Apostles.

But either he may speak that by way of rhetorical communication, usual with
Orators and Divines too, to assume that to himself, which is proper to them to
whom he speaks, 1 Cor. 15.51. yet he did not think that he and the
Corinthians should live till that change, (...), ad nostrum tempus. So that for
modesty sake he may include himself: that he speaks in the person of the
believing Jews, to whom the Gospel was confirmed by the Apostles miracles,
and the receiving of the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost: or else (which
is the soundest answer) he does not affirm that he learned his doctrine from
the Apostles, but that it was confirmed to him by the Apostles miracles: and so
without any disparagement, it might be ratified by Saint Paul himself. But I
think though it be not much material, it may be evinced by strong arguments
to be writtten by Saint Paul himself.

1. It is as clear as the noone day, that Saint Paul wrote to the Hebrews. 2
Pet. 3.15.


1 Pet. 1.1.
Saint Paul wrote to the same people that Saint Peter did, but Saint Peter wrote
both his Epistles to the Hebrews. Ergo, St. Paul wrote to them. Now either
that writing of his is fallen to the ground, which is not like, so small an
Epistle as that to Philemon being reserved, or else this is the Epistle, which
Saint Peter avoucheth he wrote to the Hebrews.

2. The inscription in all Greek copies, save one, bears the name of Paul.
(...).

3. The phrases used in this Epistle are cousin Germans to them that are in
other of Saint Paul's Epistles: especially in those to the Rom: Philip. and
Coloss. Saint Paul has in other of his Epistles as lofty phrases as any be in
this.

4. The method is alike: for as in the rest of his Epistles. 1. He unfoldeth
the doctrine of salvation purchased by CHRIST: and then exhorts to a godly
life: so he does in this.

5. All the Greek Fathers with one voice acknowledge it to be Paul's. Clem.
Alexand. Chrysostom. Theoph. Basil. Theodoret and the rest: yea and though the
Latin Church for a time repelled this Epistle, yet the chiefest of the Latin
Fathers, as Augustine, Hierome, Ambrose confess it to be Paul's. That of
Athanasius is most famous: (...) -- since the Gospel of CHRIST has been
published to the world, this has been received for Paul's Epistle. So that,
though the matter be not weighty, it seems most probable to be Saint Paul's.
Whosoever was the pipe to convey it to us, the Holy Ghost, as appears by the
heavenly doctrine contained in it, was the fountain from whence it was
derived: therefore let it be reverently embraced by all.

The third question is, in what tongue it was written. Some are of opinion, in
Hebrew, and afterward translated into Greek by Luke, Barnabas or Clemens: but
it seems that it was never written in Hebrew.

If St. Paul or any other had written this in the Hebrew tongue, he would not
have cited the testimonies of the old Testament out of the 70. but out of the
Hebrew text: yet it is a common thing with the writer of this Epistle, to
allege the testimonies of the Old Testament out of the 70. interpreters:
therefore undoubtedly he wrote in Greek, not in Hebrew.

2. Though he wrote to the Romans, which at that time were Lords of all the
world, yet he wrote not in the Latin, but in the Greek tongue to them:
because the Latin tongue was included within the compass of a few regions,
and the Greek was understood of all nations: for that cause the Apostles wrote
in Greek, and not in the peculiar tongue of any nation.

Though he wrote to the Hebrews, yet he would not write in the Hebrew tongue,
but in the Greek, that all the world might reap benefit by it, as well as
them.

3. If he had written in Hebrew, it is not like the Church should have been
deprived of the original fountain: By all probability it was written in the
Greek tongue.

The last thing to be discussed is the persons to whom it was written.

The name of Hebrews was more general then the name of Jews, for that flowed
from one tribe, the tribe of Judah. Of Judah they were called Jews: but from
whom had they the name of Hebrews? Many both old and new writers affirm, of
Heber, that is mentioned, Genesis 10.21.

Yet it seems not to be so.

1. This title of these Hebrews is no where adscribed to Heber or his
posterity, but it is often applied to Abram and his posterity.

One told Abram the Hebrew; Genesis 14.13.39, 17.43, 32.
why have thou brought this Hebrew to mock me, says Potiphars Wife of Joseph?
It is an abomination to the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews. Abram and his
posterity are called Hebrews: we do not read that Heber and his progeny were.
It comes rather from Abram, then from Heber.

2. The Jews boast often that they are Abrams seed, never that they were
Hebers seed. Abram was their father, not Heber.

3. In their own tongue they be called (gnibrim) transeuntes, of gnabar,
because Abram their father passed over the river out of Mesopotamia into
Canaan. So that they have their appellation from Abram, not from Heber: as of
Judah they were called Iudaei; so of Abram Hebraei: for Aleph is a gutturall.
Thus ye see of whom they had the name of Hebrews.

To them was this Epistle written, and in them to us that be English men, and
to all Christian people in the world: that which I say to you, says CHRIST, I
say to all, watch: Mark. 13.37.
So that which Saint Paul writes to the Hebrews, he writes to us all:
therefore let us all with reverence attend to it.

So much of the inscription. Now let us come to the substance of the Epistle.
It is divided, as all others, into two parts. 1. The doctrine of Christianity
which we are to learn. 2. The life of Christians which we are to live.

The Doctrine has two branches. 1. A large and ample description of our
Savior CHRIST the author and finisher of our salvation.

2. A pointing out of the hand, whereby we apprehend Christ, and that is faith,
Chap. 11.

The doctrine concerning CHRIST may be reduced to his person, and offices; his
kingdom, cap. 1.2. His prophecy, cap. 3.4. His priesthood, cap. 5. etc.

His person consists of two natures. The 1. Is his deity. The. 2. Is his
humanity. His deity is first taught in this Chapter, then applied in the next.

CHAPTER 1.
1. AN introduction is made into the deity of CHRIST. 2. A confirmation of it.
1. Simply, then comparatively. 1. For his person. 2. For his offices. An
introduction is made by a comparison between them in the time of the law, and
of the Gospel.

A comparison is made between them in four respects wherein we excel them.

1. In regard of the matter of the Doctrine delivered to them: 2. Of the
manner, how it was delivered. 3. Of the time when. 4. Of the persons by whom it
was delivered.
For the matter of the doctrine, it was dispensed to them at sundry times,
divided into many parts: that is the nature of the Greek word. It was given
them by piece meal, now a part, then a part. They had one part of it in Adams
time, another in Noah's: one in Abraham's, an other in Moses time: one in David's
time, another in Ieremies, Isaiah's, and the rest of the Prophets. It was
parcelled out to them, as the capacity of the people in sundry times did
require: but we have the doctrine of salvation at one lump propounded to us, in
one whole and entyre Sum. Thus God has dealt more graciously and bountifully
with us. They had one flower now, and another anon: we have all the flowers in
Gods garden sweetly smelling all at once in our nostrills. They had now a loaf
and then a loaf: now a draught and then a draught of the Lords Wine: the whole
Magazen of God Almighty is opened to us. Then how thankful ought we to be to
God above them? And how careful should we be to enrich our selves with these
heavenly wares, that may freely enter the whole storehouse of the Lord of
hoasts?

2. For the manner: God delivered his will to them after diverse manners; to
Abraham by Angels, in the shape of men; to Moses in a bush and a cloud; to
Samuel in a dream; to Ezekiel in visions: by the oracles and answers of the
Priests, in a soft wind, as to Elias, by thunder, etc. To us he has delivered
his will in one manner, by the sweet and comfortable voice, by the powerful
and majesticall voice of his own Son: never man spoke as he, which taught in
the streets of Jerusalem and of Judea in his own person, and after his
resurrection and ascension, he sent his Apostles abroad, as his Legates and
Deputies into all the world. This one manner, far surpassed all the manners,
whereby God spoke to them. Those were dark and obscure; this plain: many of
those were terrible to the hearers, insomuch, as they ran to Moses and
desired that he might speak to them, not God, lest they died; this was a most
mild and amiable manner; Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden,
etc. He stood with unfolded arms ready to embrace them; he spread forth his
wings as a loving Hen, to gather all as chickens under them. We are to magnify
God for this one manner whereby he now speaks to us. Variety does delight,
yet it is not always the best. The World was in best case, when they had but
one Tongue, Speech and Language. Variety of tongues in respect of the
Original, was but a curse on mankind: and it is far better now with the
Church, since Almighty God began to speak to us after one manner by his Son,
than when he spoke after so diverse manners under the Law. Therefore let us be
thankful for it, and reverence the voice of his Son.

3 For the time; he spoke to them in old time, in the first and eldest age of
the world; he speaks to us in a new time, when all are made new by our Savior
CHRIST. It was said by them of old times, says CHRIST, Mat. 5.21.27. But I say
to you, this new time wherein all things are made green, fresh and flourishing
by our SAVIOR CHRIST, is far more excellent than that old time of the world.

4 For the persons by whom, or in whom it was delivered. Hos. 1.7. Psalm. 63.11.
Swear in him, 1. By him: (...) for (...). Yet there is a great emphasis in
(...): GOD spoke in them, moving their hearts and tongues, 2 Pet 1.21. The
Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of GOD spoke as
they were moved by the Holy Ghost, Mat. 10.20. It is not you that speak, but
the spirit of your Father which speaks in you: not in those alone that wrote,
but in all from Adam, Ier. 7.25. whereof some were of the bloud-royall, as
Isaiah. Some of the Priests, as Jeremy. Some of the common people, as Amos.
GOD spoke in them to the Fathers, not in the Patriarchs alone, but in all. But
our estate is far more excellent: he spoke to them by the Prophets, which
indeed were rare and singular men, worthy to be had in high price and
estimation: yet not worthy to be named with CHRIST by whom he speaks to us.

They were men; Christ, by whom God speaks to us, is GOD and Man: they were
wise, could foretell things to come, aptly and pithily interpret the Word of
GOD, yet all their wisdom and knowledge was borrowed; Christ was wise of
himself, clad with his own feathers; they mortal and corruptible, dust and
ashes; CHRIST never saw corruption, but abides for ever and ever; they were
servants in the House of God; Christ is the Son, yea, the Lord and owner of
the house. Therefore wonderfully has God honored us in the time of the
Gospel, above them in the time of the Law. If a King should speak to us by
one of his Privy Council, it is much: but if he speak to us by his son and
heir apparent to the Crown, it is a greater dignity. The Prophets were of
Gods Council, as the Preachers be at this day: the Jews were honored, that
God would speak to them, by them; but to us he has spoken by his only
Son, therefore our honor is the greater: Luke 10.23, 24
we are set in an high chair of dignity above them: happy are the eyes that
see that which we see: Many (Prophets and Kings) have desired to see these
things which we see, and have not seen them. God give us grace to use our
happiness to his glory and the salvation of us all.

In this the Old and New Testament are equal; God is the Author of them both.
God spoke by the Prophets then, and he speaks now by his Ministers. The word
of the Lord, the burden of the Lord, Acts 4.25. Luke 1.70.
thus says the Lord. These were the preambles of all the Prophets. God spoke
by the mouth of David; as he spoke by the mouth of all his Prophets. Mat.
10.20. 2 Cor. 5.20.
So God speaks by the mouth of the Preachers at this present day: It is not
you that speak, but the spirit of your Father which speaks in you. We are
the Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us. When we
teach, God teaches: when we exhort, God exhorts: when we reprove sin, God
reproves sin. It makes no matter what the man be, that speaks, so as he be
the lawful Minister of Christ; God speaks by the man, when the man speaks
Gods word. When the Ambassador of the King of Denmark, of France, or any other
Country, speaks in the Court, the King speaks whose person he does
represent: when my Lord Chief Justice gives the charge at the Assizes, the
King gives the charge, for he sustaines the Kings Person, and is a Commissioner
for the King: so when the Preacher speaks in the Pulpit, when he in Gods name
gives a charge against pride, malice, etc. God himself speaks and gives the
charge. Oh that this were imprinted in the hearts of all that come to Church!
the Preacher is a man as thou art, but God speaks by him: and if thou despise
him, thou despisest God that speaks in him.

VERSE 2.
WE have seen the estate of them in the time of the Law. Now let us take a
view of our condition under the Gospel.

Theirs were the first days; ours be the last. In those that were the first
days, some new Doctrine was daily to be expected: but in these last days, GOD
has opened to us his whole counsel, there is no mint of any new Doctrine to
be looked for; now nothing but the second coming of our SAVIOR CHRIST is to
be expected, which has revealed the whole will of his Father to us. If an
Angel from Heaven preach any other Doctrine, than that which we have received
in these last days, let him be accursed.

2 In the last days there is greatest abundance of knowledge. In the last
days I will power out my Spirit on all flesh. Acts 2.
GOD then was sparing of his Spirit, he sent it down by drops: but now he
powers it out upon the Church: they had the Moone-light, we have the Sun-light.
Therefore if we be ignorant, our condemnation shall be the greater: as GOD
knows, a number of ignorant persons are in this glorious light of the Gospel;
yea, in those Towns where the Candle of Gods Word has shined brightly, these
many years together. The preaching of the Word is a well of water, but we will
not come with our buckets to fetch water at this Well: or if we do, we come
with riven buckets, the water runs out by and by.

3 These last days wherein we live, are the most dangerous: sin overfloweth
with a full stream. 2 Timothy 3.1.
In the last days perilous times shall come. Never did sin show her self
with such a brazen face as it does now: Men now stick not to set themselves
against the Word of GOD it self, to call the authority of the Scripture in
question, whether all things be true in it or not? To band themselves against
the Preachers, if not openly, yet secretly, and to pull down, if possible, the
Church it self: these be the last times wherein we live; GOD keep us in them
by his holy Spirit.

4 Seeing they be the last days, let us not be so much in love with them. Will
any be bestowing great cost on his house the last day, when he is to go out of
it? These are the last days of the world, wherein we are ready to be turned
out of the house of this world: therefore let us not be inflamed too much with
the love of it. In the first days, when they entered first into the farm of
the world, they might be merry and jocund: we live in the last days, when we
cannot have long to tarry in it, therefore let us not be glewed and wedded to
it: let us use this world as if we used it not, 1 Cor. 7.31.
for the fashion of this world fades away in these last days: let us so live,
that whenever Christ comes to judgment, we may meet him joyfully in the
Air, and be translated with him into his kingdom of glory.

Spoken unto us.] 1. To the Apostles first, that saw and heard him; then to all
Christians. [ His] must be understood, Mat. 21.37. But last of all he sent unto
them his Son: [in his Son,] Col. 2.9. For in him dwells all the fullness of
the Godhead, bodily.

The which Son, speaks to us by his Ministers to the worlds end: they had
servants to speak to them, but God has spoken to us by his Son; yet even his
Son is little regarded. Many of the Pharisees knew him to be the Son of God,
this is the Heir, yet they said, come let us kill him. I am persuaded, if
CHRIST were now alive, and preached many years together in this Town, yet
there be some so maliciously set against the Word, and the preachers of it,
that they could find in their hearts to kill him. He that hears you,
hears me: and he that goes about to kill them, goes about to kill CHRIST
too: What a vile age do we live in?

What manner of Son? not adopted, but natural:

1 Heir. The Son is the Fathers Heir: he has a right and interest to all his
Fathers goods and lands: when his Father is dead, he has the same power,
lordship, and authority over all, that his Father had. So Christ, Psa. 2.8.
John 16.15. Ioh. 17.10. Yet God his Father never dies: He is Heir as God and
Man, the King and Mediator of the Church, Mat. 28.18.
All power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth.

God appointed Him, He did not intrude Himself: He was not appointed Heir,
because being in time made, He deserved it by His holy life; as Photinus said,
not only Heir in time, but with the Father, before all times.

Of all.] Of all persons as well as of all things. CHRIST has a right to all:
he that takes away any thing bequeathed to the Heir, by the Will and
Testament of his Father, robs the Heir, and is guilty of theft: if we go
about to take any thing away from CHRIST, we rob Him: our souls and bodies are
Christ's, therefore let us not keep them away from Him, but consecrate them
wholly to him.

Romans 8.17. Gal. 4.7.
2 We are Heirs by Him: the poorest man that believes in Christ, is an Heir,
though he have scant a place to hide his head in, nor a good meals meat all
the week long. Christ Himself was Heir of all when He breathed on the Earth,
yet He was hungry, thirsty, had no money in His purse; when the receivers of
tribute came, He had not an house to dwell in: then He had a right to all,
though He had fruition of little. So is it with us. Men are wont to make much
of them that be Heirs to great Personages: the godly are Heirs, not of Men,
but of God; not of transitory Lordships, or fading Kingdoms in this world, but
of a Kingdom that cannot be shaken in the world to come: make much of them. If
we see the Heir of a Noble man, we reverence him; especially if he be the
Kings Heir. Good Christians are the Heirs of the King of Kings, therefore
have them in high price and estimation: but the world knows not these Heirs,
therefore she makes no reckoning of them. If the Kings Son should come to a
town in a beggars weed, no man would regard him: no more do they the heirs
of God, because many of them do not flourish in pomp and honor, and wealth
as others do: yet let not that discourage them; GOD knows them, the Angels
know them, and account them their brethren, and CHRIST will know us at the day
of judgment, when he shall say to many that were gay-fellowes here, I know you
not: let that be a sufficient comfort to us.

2. Arg. He that made the world is God: CHRIST made the world. Ergo. CHRIST was
not made: he was a maker. The ages: the times themselves, which have been
from the beginning. The world continues from age to age, therefore the ages are
put for the world, Hebr. 11.3.

The world was made by CHRIST, not as by an instrument, or an inferior, but as
an equal, a workman of equal power with the Father.

1. The world is of Gods making: therefore it is to be highly esteemed of us.

The Tabernacle was of Bezaleels making, that was furnished with all skill and
wisdom, therefore the more regarded by the Israelites: the Temple was of
Salomons making, the wisest man that ever was, therefore in that respect more
honored by the Jews.

A picture of Apelles making would be in great request: The world is the
glorious worke-man-ship of God Almighty, therefore to be admired of us all. If
a stranger be in a boat on the Thames, he cannot but wonder at the brave
buildings that be situate on it: shall we pass through this famous frame, and
superexcellent building of this world set up by God himself, and not wonder at
the wisdom, power and goodness of God, that made it? We see what a goodly
coat the earth has: Solomon in all his royalty was not so clothed as it: we
see the Sun in the firmament, the Moon, the Stars GOD Almighty his
Candles, birds of the air, beasts of the field, fishes of the Sea, the
admirable work of our own bodies; yet they do not make us almost to think
of GOD. The Gentiles had no book but this to look upon, yet it left them
without excuse. Let us all behold GOD, even in the creation of the world.

2. Though the world be a worthy work, and that of GODS making, yet let us not
admire it too much: as there was a time when it was set up; so there is a time
when it shall be pulled down. The Disciples stood gazing on the Temple
wondering at the workmanship of it; Matthew. 24.
but CHRIST told them that one stone should not be left upon another: So the
time shall come, as Saint Peter speaks, when the whole world shall pass away
with a noise, 2 Pet. 3.12.
the elements melt like fire: therefore let us not be too much in love with
this world: Let us lay up treasure especially in the heavenly Jerusalem that
abides for ever. This world is but an Inn, wherein we take up a nights
lodging. If thou come to an Inn, be it never so fair, will thou always
continue there? Nay, thou will leave the Inn, and make have to thy house,
though it be nothing so beautiful as the Inn. Remember that this world is
but an Inn, be it never so goodly a piece of work, hasten to that house, that
is made without hands, eternal in the heavens. Plato said that the world had a
beginning, but should have no ending, that is confuted by Aristotle his
Scholar. If it had a beginning, it must have an end too, that cannot be
avoided. Therefore he to make it eternal, would have it to be without both,
wherein he bewrayed his ignorance of God and his word.

Col. 1.16.
3. All things in the world were made by CHRIST: without him nothing was made:
he is the first begotten of every creature, whether principalities or powers,
etc. The Angels were made by him, and we men are made by him: he is the maker
of all things in the world: we are all his creatures; therefore we are bound to
glorify him, especially we men for whom all things are made. Men are wont to
say of a Noble man, or Gentle man, by whom they have ascended to great wealth;
such a one was my maker, I am bound to love him, I owe him all duty: CHRIST is
thy maker, he fashioned thee in thy mothers belly, he put into thee the
breath of life, in him thou live, moovest and have thy being: therefore thou
art bound to do him all the service thou can. Daniel reproved that great
King, that he forgate the God in whose hand his breath consisted: we have all
breath by God, yet we forget him. The Devil is our marrer and undoer, CHRIST
is our maker; yet a number serve the Devil more than him. CHRIST made thy
mouth, therefore praise him with it, rail not on him and his Ministers with
that mouth which he made: he made thy eyes, therefore look up to heaven with
them, look not on fair Women with them to lust after them. CHRIST made thy
feet, therefore go not to the Alehouse with them, till thou be past wit and
honesty too; but go to the house of God with them for the salvation of thy
soul, etc.

VERSE 3.
THe former might seem by participation and similitude to be adscribed to
Christians: we are the Sons of GOD and heirs of GOD: Matthew. 5.14.
you are the light of the world, says CHRIST. Therefore here he ascends
higher, showing that CHRIST is of the same nature and essence with GOD: as the
brightness of the Sun is of the same essence with the Sun, and as the
brightness proceeds from the Sun; so Christ is of the same essence with the
Father, and proceeds from the Father, as the brightness from the Sun: he
is lux de luce: and as we know the Sun by his brightness; so the Father by
Christ.

And the express image of his person. The former did show that CHRIST was of
the same nature with the Father: but this, that he further resembles the
person of the Father; every Son is of the same nature and essence that his
Father is of; but every Son is not like the person of his Father, in stature,
countenance, voice, gesture, etc. Whereas there is nothing in the person of the
father, but it is expressed in lively colors in CHRIST: not a painted form,
but an engraven form. As if a man's picture were taken in brass or Wax; all
the lineaments of his face, hands, and the rest of the parts of the body might
evidently be seen in it: he that beholds the one, beholds the other, Col.
1.15. Io. 14.9. the eternity of the Godhead, his wisdom, power, justice and
goodness may be seen in CHRIST. This is the third argument to prove the deity
of CHRIST, and it is drawn from the identity of the divine essence: He, that
is the brightness of Gods glory, and engraven form of his person is GOD: but
CHRIST is the brightness of GODS glory, and engraven form of his person. Ergo
--

He shows him in the fourth place to be God by the work of preservation. He
that bears up the world by the mighty power of his providence, is God, Exodus
15.13. Isai. 46.3. Deuteronomy. 1.31. Cap. 32. v. 11. but Christ bears up the world
by the power of his providence. Ergo, he bears it up, else it would fall.
Some say that (...) is put for (...) ruling all things. Yet the metaphor is
significant, Christ bears up all things in heaven and earth. There were two
pillars that bear up the house, where Sampson played, and the Philistims were
assembled together: but Christ is the only pillar that bears up the house of
the world.

The Poets write much of one Atlas, that bore up the heavens with his
shoulders: but our Savior Christ is the true Atlas that bears up heaven and
earth.

As he made the world, so he bears up the world, and keeps it up from
falling. If it were not for him; the Sun, Moon, Stars, and all the host of
heaven would fall to the ground: if it were not for him, the birds of the air,
the fishes of the Sea, the beasts of the field would drop away in a moment: the
earth would sink down under our feet, the Sea would overflow his banks and
drown us all. Our Savior Christ bears up all: in regard of their nature he
bears up the Devils themselves, and all his instruments in the world: he does
not bear them out in their wickedness, but he bears up their essence. In
him all live, breath and have their being.

But more particularly, in love and mercy he bears up his children, and the
members of Christ; as a father bears his Son, Deuteronomy. 1.31. Isai. 46.3.
and takes him up into his arms, so does he those whom he has adopted in
Christ: Nay, as a mother bears the infant, Deuteronomy. 32.11.
so does he us; as an Eagle fluttereth about her young ones, so the Lord
bears us on his wings. This may be a singular comfort to us all wheresoever
we be, on the water or on the land, in the day or night, though we be among the
thickest of our enemies, nay among Devils; yet the Lord Jesus bears us in
his hands, and none can take us out of his hands.

This should cause us all to stand in aw of him, to be afraid to displease him.
Will any be so mad as to make holes in the ship that bears them? Will any
hew down the pillars that bear up the house? Shall a child scratch out the
eyes of the nurse that bears him? Our Savior Christ bears us up all:
therefore let us not like rebels fight against him by our sins: let us please
him, all that we can, Acts 12.20.
by whom we are borne up. They of Tire and Sydon sought Herod's favor, because
their land was nourished by him: all men throughout the wide compass of the
world are nourished by our Savior Christ. The breath would quickly be out of
the nostrills of us all, if it were not for him. Kings, Princes, Noblemen,
Gentlemen, Merchants, Clothiers, Rich and Poor depend upon him: if he take
away his hand, we are all gone. Therefore let us serve him with all our might,
that bears us up with his mighty word. It is not our riches, our Silver and
Gold, our Sheep and Oxen, that can bear us up: then the rich man would never
have dyed. It is Christ that upholdeth us all. Let us all therefore fear and
reverence him: we especially that be his Ministers, of whom he has such a
fatherly care, being the watchman and keeper. Let us above all others glorify
this GOD that bears us up by the hand of his power and mercy.

The fifth argument to prove the deity of Christ is drawn from the work of
redemption. He that has purged us from our sins, is God. But Christ, etc.

This is spoken of whole Christ: His humanity was the isntrumental cause of
this purgation; his deity the efficient. We are purged by the word, as by an
instrument applying this to us; and by the Sacrament of Baptism sealing it up
in our hearts, Ephesians. 5.26. but by the blood of Christ Meritorie, Acts 20.28.
by the oblation of his own body, and the shedding of his own blood; not by an
Angel, not by the cooperation of our merits with himself.

Not of His own, for He knew no sin: but ours, that are bred, borne, and
brought up in sin: of all our sins He has not left one unpurged.

Not by our selves, nor by Angels. Here the sly and nice distinction of the
Jesuits is taken away, which they invented of late to make us believe, that by
the Doctrine of Merits they derogate nothing from the glory of CHRIST. Indeed
they say, that we may make satisfaction for sin and merit Heaven: yet it is not
we that do it, but Christ by us: not our works simply in themselves, but as
dyed in the blood of CHRIST. Our merits are Christ's merits, and therefore they
may deserve Heaven. I but Christ has purged our sins by Himself, not by our
selves: he has done it by his own blood immediately, not mediately by our
works dyed in His blood: therefore that is a mere delusion to mock the World
withal.

This is a singular benefit, that we receive from Christ a purgation from all
our sins. Sin is an heavy load and importable burden: a man had better have a
mountain than one sin hang on Him. Hence it is, that they cry, O ye hills fall
on us. In what a pitiful taking was Judas, when he felt the horror of his
sin not purged, by the Lord Jesus! How did he houle and cry, I have sinned* --
and at length, took a rope and hanged himself? There is no torment to the
torment of sin: this is in a manner the only hell: though we be never so rich,
have never so many bags of gold and silver, lie on beds of down, have never so
many friends and Physicians about us; yet if the worm of conscience lie
gnawing on us for our sins, our murders, adulteries, drunkenness, etc. That we
have no hope that Christ died for them; in what miserable case are we? The
Hypocrite would give 1000. Rams, 10000. Rivers of Oil, the fruit of his body
for his soul: as a man that is dangerously sick would give any thing for
health: so a man that is oppressed with the burden of his sins, would give any
thing that they were removed.

Now CHRIST JESUS alone has purged us from our sins. Apply this purgation to
thy self by the hand of a true and a lively faith, and then thou art a happy
man: if CHRIST had not purged us from sin, we had fried in hell for ever.
Therefore let us magnify the Lamb that was killed for us, and give praises to
him for ever. Worthy is the Lamb who has purged us from our sins, to
receive power and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, Apoc. 5.12.
and glory, and blessing. Again, has Christ purged us from our sins, and
shall we tumble in them? Has the Physician purged thy body and made thee
whole, and will thou by ill diet make thy self sick? Christ the heavenly
Physician has purged us from sin that made us sick to death, and shall we run
into sin again? O that men would effectually consider of this great benefit,
the purging of our sins by Christ! Who has purged us? not an Angel, but the
Son of God: with what has He purged us, not with the blood of Martyrs, but
with His own blood: to what end has He purged us? not that like swine we
should still wallow in the mire of our sins, but that we should be an holy
Nation, a royal Priesthood, a peculiar people to Himself, zealous of good
works. Therefore as CHRIST has purged us from our sins, so let us hurl away
our sins, and have nothing to do with them, least we crucify again the Lord
of life. That proverb is known to us all; the Hog to the mire: a Hog is
washed clean and fair, he runs into the mire again: what a filthy sight is
that? So it is for one whom Christ has purged from sin, to return to them
again: a Dog to his vomit. Who can abide to see a Dog take up that which
he has cast out of his belly? and a loathsome sight it is to see men daily,
yea hourly to take up the Vomit of their old sins again.

How has Christ purged us from sin, when as sin still remains in us all? If
we say we have no sin, we deceave our selves, etc. The answer is easy: there is
in sin, materia and forma; the matter still remains to exercise us withal;
but the guilt that is, the form of sin, which gave an esse to it, that is
taken away by Christ. In so much as we may say, death where is thy sting, hell
where is thy victory? the strength of death is sin; but thanks be to God,
which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

The sixth and last Argument to prove the deity of Christ, is taken from His
exaltation: which is fitly inferred upon the former humiliation. He that
sits on the right hand of the Majesty on high, is GOD: but CHRIST sits on
the right hand of the Majesty on high. Ergo. He does not say, stands: that
belongs to Servants and inferiors: but he sits. Kings, Senators, Judges sit
when they hear causes.

He sits, not at the commandment or appointment of another, but of Himself:
He knows His place, and takes it: not at the left hand, but, which is higher,
at the right hand: His fathers equal.

Regia majestas, the Kings Majesty is more magnificent then to say the King.
Prove. 25.27. Scrutator majestatis opprimetur a gloria. Heb. 8.1. We have such
an High Priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in
the heavens.

Christ could not purge our sins but by dying: He was feign to shed His blood
and to dye for us: yet He rose again, ascended into Heaven, and fitteth on the
right hand of the Majesty on high. Out of this we have two notable comforts.

1 If Christ sits above in the highest places, then he beholds all things
here below. A man, that is upon the top of some high Tower, may see far: and
Christ being in the high Steeple and Tower of Heaven, can see all things on the
earth. He that is upon the top of an high Tower, may see men, but he cannot
discern who they be: Christ sees them, and discernes them too. If the wicked
be laying of plots and snares against His Children, Christ being in Heaven
sees them, and in due time will overthrow them: and He that sits in Heaven,
laugheth them to scorn. This is a singular comfort, that our Head, King and
defender is in Heaven, and has equal Power, Glory and Majesty with God. If
thou have a friend in the Court, that sits daily by the King, and is in favor
with him, will thou care for any in England? we have a friend that siteth on
the right hand of God, and has all power in Heaven and earth; therefore let us
fear nothing; he will keep us, none shall do us any harm, but it shall all
turn to our good in the end.

2 As Christ sits in the heavens: so we shall one day sit there with Him.
Luke 13.29.
Many shall come from the East, and from the West, and from the North, and from
the South, and shall sit down in the Kingdom of God. Math. 10.28.
Ye shall sit on the twelve Seats and Judge the twelve Tribes of Israel.
Which is not spoken of all the Apostles; for Judas never sat there: nor yet of
the Apostles only, but of all Christians: Know ye not that we shall judge
the World? we shall one day sit in Heavenly places with Christ: we sit there
already in our head, but we shall likewise sit there in our own persons with
our head. Let this comfort us against all the calamities of this life: here the
children of God are oftentimes made the wickeds footstooles, they sit on them
and tread on them: no reckoning is made of a godly man. A rich man that is a
common drunkard and whore-master shall be more esteemed of by many then a godly
poor man. Here they sit as forlorn persons, none regards them. Many times
they sit weeping and wayling, for their sins, for their children, for crosses
in goods, in bodies, in good name; the wicked deriding them, jesting at them,
making songs of them in the Alehouses: but let this comfort us against them
all; how contemptible soever we sit here, we shall sit with CHRIST JESUS,
though not in that degree of glory, yet in the same kingdom of glory with him
for ever.

VERSE 4.
THe Jews in general were bitter enemies to Christ: they that thought most
highly of him, took him to be but some admirable Prophet, like Moses, or an
Angel in the shape of man. Therefore here he shows him to be above the
Angels: Where, 1. A proposition comprehending in it the excellency of CHRIST:
above the Angels. 2. A confirmation of it by diverse strong and invincible
arguments.

1. CHRIST is the Son of God: So are not the Angels. 2. The Angels worship
CHRIST: therefore he is their superior. 3. The Angels are Ministers and
servants: Christ is the Lord to whom they minister. 4. CHRIST is an everlasting
King: So are not the Angels. 5. CHRIST made heaven an earth: So did not the
Angels. 6. CHRIST sits as an equal at the right hand of GOD, whereas the
Angels are ministering spirits, and stand round about his throne: therefore it
must needs be confessed that Christ has a chair of dignity above the Angels,
and for that cause is the high and eternal God; and is become by virtue of his
Deity being from all eternity with the Father, better than the Angels by many
degrees: they are not worthy to be named with him the same day. A more
surpassing name above them.i. greater honor and dignity, then they, Phi. 2.9.
Ephesians. 1.21. he has given him a name.i. A prerogative and privilege: this name
came to him jure haereditario, by descent, as it does to the Son from the
Father.
CHRIST is exalted into a chair of dignity above the Angels. This is a
singular comfort to the Church. The Angels are great, mighty, puissant and
glorious creatures: we men cannot endure the presence of an Angel: many of
the Saints have fainted for fear, at the sight of Angels: yet our Savior
Christ that has dyed for us, our elder brother, the Lord protector of his
Church and Children, is far more excellent than the Angels. If he be above
the good Angels, then above the bad: therefore let us not fear all the Devils
in hell. Christ our captain is above them, and able to trample them under his
feet.

VERSE 5.
I But how proves he this, that Christ is more excellent then the Angels?

1. By a relation between GOD and him, which agrees not to the Angels: He
brings it in by the way of an interrogation, after the manner of Rhetoritians.
That CHRIST is the Son of GOD, he does not prove by his preaching, which
made some to confess it, never man spoke as this man does: not by his
miracles, the stilling of the Sea, and Winds, which made some come and worship
him: not by his resurrection, ascension and sending of the Holy Ghost from
heaven: the Jews would have cavilled at these: but he proves it by two places
of Scripture.

What Son? The natural Son of GOD, begotten of Gods essence: the Angels
are made by God, but not begotten of God, as Christ is.

(...), discretive, thou alone, whereby he distinguishes him from other Sons.
The Angels, Job 1.6. The Magistrates, Psalm 82.6. are called the Sons of
God, in regard of the Majesty of that rule and dominion which they exercise in
the name of God, whose sons they are in respect of their office: but they not
begotten of the essence of GOD, as Christ is. God begets us by the word of
truth, but that is mediately: he begat Christ immediately of himself.

To day: some refer it to the Virgins Womb: to day. i. When thou wast
conceived, begotten and borne of the Virgin. Athanas. and Cyril. others
interpret it de hodie quodam infinito: To day.i. from all eternity: in such a
day as lasts for ever, Hebr. 13.8. So Augustine.

To day: In this clear light of the Gospel, I have manifested thee to be my
begotten Son, Matthew. 3.17. So the word, hodie, is used, Hebr. 3.13. as he was
begotten of the Father from all eternity: so he was begotten by him anew
again in the minds and hearts of men, when he was revealed to them by the
preaching of the Gospel, after Christ his resurrection and ascension into
heaven, Romans 1.4.

This first text of Scripture the Rabbis themselves expound of Christ, 2 Samuel
7.14. No doubt but that was spoken of Solomon, that was to build a Temple unto
God. Many things are peculiar to him, as the words immediately following: yet
Solomon was a type of Christ, which is our true pacificus, who built a more
glorious temple to God, which was the Church.

And some things there be in that prophecy which cannot be applied to Solomon,
but to Christ, as Verse 12. the seed that shall proceed out of thy body,
Solomon was come out of David's loins already: CHRIST was to come of him: which
is called the seed of David, and the Son of David. 2. Verse 13. Salomons
kingdom was not established for ever: 11. Tribes were rent from his Son.

By Christ we also are made the Sons of God: and God is our Father. I go to
my God and your God, to my father and your father. We are all the Sons of God
by faith in Christ Jesus: the Spirit cries in our hearts, that is, makes us to
cry, Abba, Father.

1 What an honor is this? See thou a man that believes in Christ? though
never so poor a man, he is a Kings Son, the Son of the King of Kings, and
Prince of Princes.

2 As Christ has made us the Sons of God, so let us live like the Sons of God:
If I be your Father, where is my honor? will a child play the wag in his
fathers sight? he will reverence his Father more then so: we are continually in
the sight of our heavenly Father, He compasses our paths round about, not a
thought in our hearts but he searches it out: therefore let us fear Him, let
us commit no sin in any secret closet, because our father sees us. Potiphers
Wife picked out a time when no man was in the house, then she said to Joseph,
come lie with me I pray thee; here is no man to look on us. I but our Father
is in the house, therefore let us not sin because of him: let this be a bridle
to restrain us from all Sin.

VERSE 6.
ANd when again he brings in: the Prophet, or rather God the Father: a
trajection of the particle (...). As if it had been said, (...): or rather no
trajection. For once He brought him into the world in the Verse going before,
when at His exhibition in the flesh He manifested it to the world, that He
was His only begotten Son, as Matthew. 3, 17. chap. 17, 5, 27, 54. He brought
Him in first, when He sent Him to take flesh of the Virgin. 2. When after His
Ascension He manifested Him to the world by the propagation of the Gospel
over all the earth: therefore when He sends Him at the day of judgment, to
judge the World, He brought Him into the World to take possession of it as His
own house. Chrysostom.

He is the first begotten Son of Blessed Mary, in respect of His humanity: of
God, in respect of His deity: because He was the first begotten of Him, before
any creature was: Col. 1.15. He is unigenitus respectu naturae; primogenitus
respectu dignitatis. The first begotten had a privilege above all his
brethren: Romans 8.29.
So had Christ: In Hebr. elohim: which may be applied to the Angels, or
Magistrates: the Seventie expound it of the Angels, which he follows.

Divine worship is proper to God. Matthew. 4.10. CHRIST must be worshipped. Ergo,
He is God. 2. The Angels must worship Him; therefore they are inferior to Him.
Not some, but all: the highest of them all. God alone is to be worshipped: thou
shall worship the Lord thy God? There is a civil and humane worship, that may
be ascribed to men. So Abraham worshipped the Hittites in bowing himself to
them: So Jacob worshipped Esau in bowing to him seven times. Thus the Subject
may be said to worship the Prince, when he kneeles to him in token of
reverence: thus the Husband is said to honor the Wife as the weaker vessel,
which is counted a kind of worship: but divine worship is proper to God alone.
Saint Paul and Silas were worthy men, yet would not be worshipped by the
Lycaonians; when they were about to offer Sacrifice to them, as if they were
Gods, they rent their clothes, and would none of it. Saint Peter was a famous
Apostle, yet he would not be worshipped: nay the Angels themselves refuse
divine worship, Reve. 19.10. none but God must have a divine worship given to
Him.

Then how sharply are the Papists to be reproved, that worship the images of
our Lady and other Saints? Nay what a presumptuous man is the Pope, that will
have Kings and Princes fall at his feet?

He takes on him to command the Angels of Paradise: even they also must
worship him. They pray to images, they offer to images, they expect aid and
Succor from them. What could they do more to God Himself? They praise their
Idols for benefits received. Christ is worshipped, and that by the Angels, the
highest creatures of all: therefore He is God. 1. Laud and magnify Him,
subject your selves to Him, as to your Lord and Master, acknowledge Him for
your King. So they do in the Apocal. they cast down their crowns at his
feet, they sing praises to him Day and Night.

Now if the Angels worship Christ, shall not we men that be dust and ashes
worship Him? If the Lords of the Privy Council stand bare to the King, shall
not we silly men of the Country do it? The Angels that dwell in the Court of
Heaven with God, worship Christ: and shall not we on earth do it? Let us
worship Him, and Him alone: let us not worship our gold and silver, as Covetous
men do, and come within compass of Idolatry: let us not worship our pleasures
as Epicures do, and make their bellies God: but let us worship Christ as the
Angels do. If thou love any thing more then Christ, if thou fear any
above Christ, if thou trustest to any more then to Christ, thou art not a right
worshipper of the Lord Jesus. We worship Christ with our lips, we have His Name
in our mouth; but we worship Him not with our hearts and lives. A great number
of Christians are like the Soldiers that sat a Crown of thorns on Christ's
head, put a reed in stead of a Scepter into His hand, clothed Him with a
purple garment, and in the end did nothing but mock Him. So we talk
gloriously of CHRIST, and of His Kingdom; in words we profess Him to be our
King; but we do not worship Him in truth and sincerity, and serve Him in
holiness and righteousness, as we ought to do.

VERSE 7.
Pr for per, ad for de: unless it be in regard of the antithesis, verse 8. or,
quod ad angelos attinet. Psalm. 1047.
It is an other argument taken from the Angels, whereby he proves Christ to be
Superior to them: The Son is greater than the servant: Christ is the Son, the
Angels are servants. Ergo.

Hebr. creates: (...), which uses: for it is ad usum adhibere. Beza
translates it, which made his Angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire:
which uses them as winds and lightning.

1 The Angels are Created: Christ is the Creator.

2 They be finite Spirits: He an infinite Spirit.

3 They be messengers: Christ the Lord, that sends them: Spiritus est nomen
naturae; angelus officij: ex eo quod est, Spiritus est: ex eo quod agit, angeus
est. Mat. 4.11.

His Angels Spirits: of a lively and swift nature; not flesh which is lumpish
and heavy.

They all agree together: have one mind in praising God, and doing good to the
faithful and elect of God: therefore there needs no superiority among them, as
there does among men that are of jarring dispositions. One may be called an
Arch-Angell in regard of some peculiar business committed to him for the time:
as the Subject is sent Ambassador from the Prince for the time.

And His Ministers a flame of fire.

1 Fire is lightsome and strikes a terror into men, so do the Angels, when
they appear. 2. Reg. 6.17. they be called, Seraphim urentes, ab ardore seu
inflammatione. Esaias. 6.

2 Fire is of a subtle and piercing nature: So are the Angels, they are
quickly here and there.

3 Fire consumes and burns up: so do they the wicked, our enemies. This is
the greatest honor of the Angels to be Gods Ministers and Messengers: So must
we count it the greatest dignity of all men on the face of the earth. Though
thou be a rich tradesman, a wealthy Merchant, a gentleman of great
revenewes, a Knight, a Lord, or a King: yet the most magnificent style thou
can have is this, to be GODS Minister and Servant, to be his messenger and
to go on his errands. As the Centurion said of his Soldiers, I say, to one
go, and he goes, etc. So God has Angels under him; If he say go, they go --
The counsel and Parliament house have their messengers whom they send into all
quarters of the land: So the high Court of Parliament held in heaven, has his
messengers, namely, the Angels, whom God sends into all the world. Let us be
his Ministers and messengers, as the Angels be: let us not be the Devils
messengers, for to run on his errands: if he say, dwell in malice, kill thy
brother, etc. Let us not do this; but if God injoyne us any thing, let us be
his messengers. We say in the Lords prayer, thy will be done in earth as it is
in heaven: the Angels in heaven do the will of GOD with all cheerfulness; so
let us do on the earth.

VERSE 8.
HE does not call him his messenger or Minister, but he gives him his own
title: and here he speaks of his authority. In his throne is signified his
inauguration into his kingdom: by the scepter the administration of his
kingdom.

Psalm. 45.7.
That Psalm is first to be understood of Solomon, then of Christ: he is the
fairest among men, Verse 2. Grace was in his lips: he rides on the word of
truth.

Princes have thrones, so has CHRIST.

Salomons throne was but for a short time, this for ever and ever. What manner
of kingdom? administered in equity, Isai. 11.3. swayed with righteousness:
there is no respect of persons with him: he is just in his government, he will
punish the wicked, comfort and defend the godly. CHRIST'S Scepter is a scepter
of righteousness; there is no partiality, no unjust dealing with him: If his
own servants sin, he inflicts punishment on them, as well, as on the wicked:
judgment begins at his own house first. If a King will reform his
kingdom, he must reform his own court first; so does CHRIST in the
government of the world: if they of his own family offend, he will begin with
them first. Moses murmured, therefore he lost the enjoying of the land of
Canaan. David a man after Gods own heart committed adultery; therefore his
wives were deflowred before his eyes, and he had like to have lost his kingdom
for it. Therefore let not us that be within the Walls of the Church, flatter
our selves in our sins; we may drink, etc. CHRIST will be merciful to us,
nay, his Scepter is a Scepter of righteousness, he must punish sin
wheresoever he finds it.

VERSE 9.
THat the Scepter of CHRIST'S kingdom, is a Scepter of righteousness, he
proves by two effects: he loves righteousness, and hates iniquity: ergo, it
is a Scepter of righteousness.

Hebr. It is, because: both are good and true. The cause of good government is
the grace of God: and God rewards good government.

Thy God, by generation: Ours, by creation.

Has anointed thee -- Hereby he is distinguished from GOD the Father: as
Genesis 19.24. GOD the Father anointed him, in respect of his humanity.

With the oil of gladness: with the graces of the Holy Ghost, which make the
hearts of the faithful glad and cheerful to every good work; as they that
were anointed in the time of the law, were made the fitter to those businesses
which GOD enjoined to them. Further, because they made CHRIST glad to power
down those graces on his Church: JESUS rejoiced in the spirit, Luke 10.

We are Christ's fellows, as men; as members of his body, and as his brethren,
we are anointed: touch not mine anointed, Psalm. 105.15. and 2 Cor. 1.21. We in
measure; he above measure Romans 12.3. Io. 1.16. Io. 3.34. he is Sanctus
Sanctorum.

Who be those that are Christ's fellows? Surely the faithful: we are his
servants and fellows too. The head is above all the members of the body, yet
the head and members are fellows: the husband has a superiority over the
Wife, yet the man and the Wife are fellows: Christ is our Husband, we by his
grace and favor are his Wife; therefore his fellows: the eldest Son and
heir to a Nobleman has many prerogatives above the rest of his brethren; yet
in that they be brethren, the Sons of one Father, they are all fellows. So
CHRIST our elder brother is above us: yet because we are his brethren, we may
be termed his fellows.

By this oil of gladness is meant nothing else, save the graces of the
spirit. The ointment shall teach you, says John: 1 Ioh. 2.27.
the Holy Ghost is this oil or ointment. Where we have many observations and
instructions.

1. All the oil that we have comes from God: we have no grace but it is of
him: the uprightness of Noah, meekness of Moses, zeal of Phineas, sincerity
of David, the patience of Job, the hope of Abraham, the wonderful faith of the
Centurion, the knowledge of Ezra and Paul, that spoke with tongues more than
all, the courage of Peter, all is of God: it is he that anointed us with his
holy oil; therefore let us be proud of no gift, but use all in fear and
trembling to the glory of the giver.

There is one that bestows precious oil on thee, with that thou anointest thy
face, and have a cheerful look; thou art not to praise thy self, but him,
that gave thee the oil: all our spiritual oil comes out of Gods shop;
therefore let us magnify him for all: if he anointed Christ, much more us:
he was anointed with this oil as he was man; otherwise as he was God, he had
all fullness of himself.

2. If Christ were anointed above his fellows, then his fellows also are
anointed, though not in that measure he was: we have a little Crewse full of
oil; but he has a great Pot full of it: yet every Christian must have some
oil, else he is a Christian in name, not in deed.

Hence it is, that we are called Christians of Christ, because we are anointed
as he was: but none may be called Jesuits of Jesus, because there is no Savior
beside him: we may communicate with him in the name of Christ, but not in the
name of Jesus: and if we be Christ's members, we must have some oil, as well as
our head. Saint Paul profited in the study of the law above his fellows:
therefore his fellows profited something. CHRIST was anointed above us:
therefore we must be anointed too. If thou have no knowledge in the will of
God, no faith, no zeal, hope, meekness, patience, thou art no Christian:
therefore let us entreat the LORD to anoint us with this oil daily more and
more.

1. Oil was a token of consecration in the time of the law. Aaron and his
Sons, Saul, David, and all the Kings by oil were consecrated to the Lord,
Genesis 28.
and set apart to an holy use: Jacob powered oil on the pillar whereof he was
purposed to make an altar to the Lord. So we by this heavenly oil of the
spirit, are dedicated to God, as a royal Priesthood, an holy nation, a
peculiar people, zealous of good works.

2. Oil gives a sweet taste to the meat: whereupon God commanded that on the
meat offering should be powered oil and incense: Levi. 2.1.
oil for the taste, and incense for the smell. So this spiritual oil of Gods
graces makes us a sweet and pleasant meat to the Lord: the wicked he will spew
out of his mouth; but in us, that are seasoned with the oil of the spirit, he
takes singular delight.

3. Oil supples the wounds that be in a man's body. The Samaritane powered oil
into the wounds of the man, that lay half dead, by the high way side: so the
oil of the spirit supples us against the wounds of sin, a certain
persuasion being settled in our hearts of the love of God toward us in Christ.

4. Oil makes a man nimble: therefore wrastlers in all ages were wont to
anoint themselves with oil, that they might bestirre their joints the better:
So the graces of the spirit make us more lively in Gods service, to wrestle
with great alacrity with Satan and all the enemies of our salvation.

5. Oil keeps the body Soluble, and is a means to purge it from many gross
humors: So the graces of the spirit cleanse us from many sins, which are the
corruptions of the soul.

6. Oil swims aloft above all other things, it will have the preeminence above
all liquid things: So the oil of the Spirit carries us aloft, makes us to have
our conversation in heaven.

7. Oil makes the lamp to burn: the five foolish Virgins went to buy oil
for their lamps. So the oil of the Spirit makes us to continue burning in
zeal and all good works.

8. Oil makes a man cheerful: he has given him oil to make him a
cheerful countenance: when men would look cheerfully, they anoint their
faces with oil. So the graces of the spirit infuse unspeakable cheerfulness
into the faithful: for this cause it is called the oil of gladness: none so
merry, none so cheerful, as they that be anointed with this oil. Act. 8.3.
There was great joy in Samaria when this oil came to the City, when the
Gospel of Christ was planted among them. The Iaylor rejoiced with all his
household, that by Saint Paul's Preaching he believed in God: the Christians in
the Primitive Church, being for the most part poor folk, eat their meat
with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God. This oil makes us
exceeding cheerful in all estates and conditions. Sometimes indeed we have
cause of weeping for our selves and others. Saint Peter wept bitterly for his
denial of Christ. Phil. 3.
There be some of whom I tell you weeping: yet this cheerful oil of the
Spirit comforts us in the midst of all calamities whatsoever: in Sickness,
poverty, in the loss of goods and friends too, yea in the hour of death it
self. David was in a pitiful taking; the City was burnt wherein he was, his
wives taken prisoners, 1 Samuel 30.6.
the people ready to stone him: yet having this oil in him he was of a
cheerful heart. It is said of him, yet David comforted himself in the Lord
his God. Some are afraid to become strict livers, because they suppose there is
no mirth in that way. Christians must be ever weeping with Heraclitus, they may
not go to the Taverns and Alehouses, they may not be dancing, skipping and
rejoicing as other men: yes verily, they that be right Christians, anointed
with this oil of the Spirit, are the merriest men in the world: they may in
some respect, though not as he did, be always laughing with Democritus.

There is no peace, says God, to the wicked: if no peace, Isai. 57.21.
then no true joy: they may be merry in their cups, as Belshazzar was; but the
soundest mirth is among the godly, that are anointed with this oil of
gladness. Come War, peace: health, sickness, death, life: they are merry in
the Lord, ready to sing as the Swanne does, at the sight of death. What a
joyful man was Saint Paul, when he was in the Lions mouth at Rome? I am now
ready to be offered: 2 Timothy 4.6, 8.
henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of righteousness -- Therefore let
us entreat the Lord to anoint us with this oil of gladness; it surpasses all
the joy and mirth in the world.

All the faithful have some of this oil: but Christ is anointed with it above
us all. Semper excipio Platonem, said he; So when we talk of rare and
excellent men, we must say, we always except our Savior Christ. Noah was a
famous man, Abraham a notable man; Moses, David, Solomon, were of great
renown; Peter, Paul, Thomas were adorned with singular graces: yet Christ is
many degrees above them. Prove. 31.29.
As he says of a good huswife, many women have done valiantly, but thou
surmountest them all: So though many of GODS children were beautified with the
oil of the spirit; yet CHRIST surmounts them all: he is anointed above his
fellows: they were as stars, he as the Sun. Therefore let us all do
reverence to him: we are Saints, but he is Sanctus Sanctorum, and of his
fullness we all receive.

The principal scope of the place is this. CHRIST is above all, above all men,
above all Angels, above all creatures whatsoever. Which must needs be a pillar
of singular comfort for us to lean upon, that the King and protector of the
Church is the high, mighty and eternal God: all stoop to him. Let Satan spew
out the Sea of his malice against us: let his instruments rage never so much:
let the cruel and blood thirsty Jesuits be continually plotting against us,
as out of all question they are never idle; yet let us not be dismayed: CHRIST
our head and keeper is above all: he has all power in heaven and earth; he
sits in the high tower of heaven, sees all their doings and laughs them to
scorn. This doctrine concerning the deity of CHRIST, in the pressing whereof
the Holy Ghost is so large and ample, is not lightly to be passed over: let us
all apply it to our own hearts, that it may be a bultwarke to us in the time
of need, that seeing he is God blessed above all for ever and ever, so we may
boldly put our trust in him in this world, count our selves safe under the
shadow of his wings, and reign with him in the world to come.

VERSE 10.
AN other Argument from the Creation of the world. Christ is the maker of
heaven and earth: therefore GOD, Ier 10.11.

Psalm 102.25. This Psalm entreats of the deliverance of the Church out of
captivity in Babylon, of the re-edifying of the Temple, and the repairing of
the Walls of Jerusalem: which is further to be applied to our deliverance from
sin, to the building up of the Walls and Temple of the Church: whereupon the
Psalmist converteth his speech to CHRIST, the true instaurator of the Church.

Lord: to whom all Creatures are subject as servants to their LORD.

In the beginning: therefore CHRIST was before that beginning: Io. 1.1. Before
Abraham was, I am, Io. 8.58. CHRIST is the beginning of the world who was
before it had a beginning.

Laid the foundation of the earth: made it firm, sure and solid, so as it
cannot be moved: contrary to those Philosophers, that are of opinion, that the
heavens stand still, and the earth moves, though it cannot be discerned with
the eye.

And the heavens, i. all the heavens: the firmament and the air; are the
works of thy hands: it is a metaphor borrowed from Carpenters and Masons; else
God has no hands.

CHRIST in setting up the building of the world observed an other order then
earthly Artificers. When they go about to build, they lay the foundation
first, and set on the roof afterward, for they cannot build otherwise: but
this celestial builder made the roof first, and the foundation afterward:
Genesis 1.
first he spread forth the heavens as the roof, and afterward laid the
foundation of the earth: which was a lively demonstration of his unspeakable
power.

Heaven and earth is the workmanship of CHRIST, the high and eternal God. In
that respect it should be admired by us all: if thou had a picture of
Apelles making, that famous and renowned Painter, would thou not often look
upon it? The world is the admirable picture of God Almighty, in whom the
treasure of all wisdom is hid: therefore let us behold it with admiration.
If the Tabernacle were now to be seen which was of Aholiabs and Bezaleels
making, or if the goodly Temple that was of Salomons setting up, were now to
be seen, we would run and ride many a mile to take a view of it. The frame
of the world set up by the wise, high and eternal God, surpasses them all, yet
we go through it, we look upon it, and it never carries us to the
contemplation of the wisdom and power of GOD. The reason is, because it is so
common and ordinary a sight. They that come first to London, and look on Paul's
and Westminster, upon the fair Tombs, and costly ornaments that be in them,
are ravished with the sight of them: but if they have been there long, they
pass by them and regard them not.

So is it with us: because we see the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the glorious
curtain of the heaven, the birds of the air, fishes of the Sea, beasts of the
field, the goodly coat of the earth daily, which is better arrayed than
Solomon was in all his royalty; because these are common, they are not
esteemed of us. Let us remember they be the handy work of God, a glass
wherein we behold the everlasting Godhead, and in that respect; let us view
diligently, and be brought to the knowledge, the fear and love of God by it,
that has made all these things for our sakes.

VERSE 11.
AS CHRIST had no beginning, so he shall have no ending. The heavens shall
decay, but not he. Thus CHRIST is eternal, without beginning and ending: who
as he is the beginning of the world, being before it had a beginning; So he is
the end of it, who shall continue when it has an end.

2. He is immutable. They are young and old; so is not Christ: he remains
always in the same estate and condition.

All garments in the world in the end wax old, Deuteronomy. 29.5. So the whole
fabric of the world: there is not that cleerenesse of light, in the Sun and
Moon, that there was: not that force and strength in the Stars: the earth is
not so lusty and lively.

Old things are not wont to be had in any price or estimation: who cares for an
old pair of shoes that be not worth the taking up?

Who regards an old Coat that has no strength in it, but is ready to be torn
in pieces? Who will give much for an old house, the timber whereof is rotten,
and it is ready to fall on his head? Now is the last age of the world, it has
continued many thousand years, it is now as an old house, an old garment that
cannot last long: therefore let us not be too much in love with it.

There was some reason, why in former times, when this building was new and
strong, when the coat and garment of the world was fresh, fair, and of good
durance, that men should set their affections on it: but now when the beauty
and strength of it is gone, why should we be enamoured with it? Let us use it,
as if we used it not: and let us long for that day, when both the heavens and
the earth, and we our selves likewise shall be changed and be translated with
CHRIST into the kingdom of glory: the heavens are most fitly resembled to a
garment. Observe the similitude and dissimilitude.

1. A garment covers a man: So do the heavens. 2. The substance of a garment
must be before, as Silk, Velvet, Cloth, else you can make no garment: but
CHRIST made the heavens of nothing. 3. A garment must have a form or fashion:
So has this an excellent one. 4. A garment stands in need of mending: we need
be at no cost nor labor in mending of this garment; but CHRIST by the power of
his providence upholds it.
VERSE 12.
NOw this vesture of the heavens is spread abroad, and cast as a mantle about
us: then it shall be folded up. Esaias 34.4. And all the host of Heaven shall be
dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scrole, and all their
host shall fall down as the leaf falls from off the Vine, and as a falling
fig from the fig tree: but CHRIST yesterday, and to day the same, for ever:
there is not a shadow of turning in Him: He is the same both in respect of His
essence and promise.

Properly to speak, CHRIST has no years. In the first or fortieth year of
such a Kings reign: but CHRIST reigns without years. This is spoken only
for our capacity. Such a King reigns so many years and in the end he dies:
but Christ's years never fail.

The world it shall be changed. Plato, lighting on the books of Moses,
affirmed that it had a beginning: but would not grant it should have an ending:
which opinion of his Aristotle confuteth; for Omne genitum est corruptibile.

Democritus, Empedocles and Heraclitus, held that it had a beginning; and shall
have an ending: yea, some of them did speak of two destructions of the world;
the one by water, the other by fire.

There shall not be consumptio, but mutatio and renovatio mundi.

1 (...), praeteribunt. Marc. 13.31. Non peribunt: (...) transit. 1 Cor. 7.31.
Non, interit.

2 Figura mundi, non natura. 1 Cor. 7.31. the fashion of this world passes
away.

3 As the old world perished by water: so shall the new by fire. 2 Pet. 3.6.
but the substance of that perished not: no more of this.

4. It shall be delivered only from corruption, Romans 8.21.22.
for the which it sigheth.

5 There shall be new heavens and earth, 2 Pet. 3.13. Apo. 21.1.

6 As our bodies shall not perish, but be changed, of corruptible made
incorruptible, 1 Cor. 15. And as it is in the little world of man's body, so it
is in the great world. Vid. Aug. lib. 20. de civ. Dei, cap. 14. and 16.

CHRIST remains ever without any change or alteration, either in respect of
His promise, or essence: which may cause us both to put our trust in Him, to
believe whatsoever He has said, and to depend on Him, as a strong and
unmovable pillar. Kings and Princes dye, our friends dye, our fathers and
mothers that were our stays are taken out of the world: but CHRIST the King
and protector of the Church continues for ever. King Henry the eight is dead,
who banished the Pope out of England. That worthy Prince Edward another Josiah,
and favourer of the Gospel, is dead. Queen Elizabeth that famous Queen, the
wonder of the world, while she lived, a careful and loving nursing mother to
the Gospel, is dead. King James of Blessed memory a great Patron of the
Church, a just and a peaceful Prince is dead. Yet CHRIST lives still, His
years fail not, and He will always provide for his Church and children.

When we hear any ill news, that such and such be gone, such wise
Counselors, such godly and religious common-wealths-men be gone; let us in
some measure grieve at it: the faithful dye, and no man considers it: that is
not well. There should not be such blockishnesse among us: yet let us not be
too much daunted at it: let this be a castle of refuge for us to fly unto;
Jesus Christ our Captain, keeper and defender remains for ever: He is the
same, and His years never fail.

Now as the head remains for ever, so shall we that be His members: our souls
never dye at all, but are immediately in Paradise with Christ: our bodies
though they dye, putrify in the Earth, and and there sleep for a season as in
beds, yet they shall be raised up at the latter day: we shall meet CHRIST in
the air, and remain with Him for ever. Let this be a singular comfort to us
all.

VERSE 13.
NOe Angel sits at the right hand of God: CHRIST does. Ergo.

That Psame 110.1. must needs be understood of CHRIST.

1 S. Peter expounds it of Him. Acts 2.34.

2 That verse 4. cannot be applied to David: he was no Priest: all the Priests
were according to Aaron, not Melchizedec: none of them were for ever.

3 The Pharisees are mute, when CHRIST presses them with this testimony,
Matthew. 22.46. Whereby it is evident, that all took it as confessed, that this
Psalm was meant of Christ.

1* God the Father honors Him with the title of [ Lord;] therefore He is God
equal with Him.

2 He places Him at His right hand as His equal. Ergo. Til: 2 Samuel 6.23.
Matthew. 1.21. it denotes continuationem temporis: then thou shall sit quietly
with me for ever.

Footstool. that is, extrema subiectio. 1 Cor. 15.24, 25.

As Christ's enemies shall be made His footstool; so shall ours be: for His
enemies are our enemies: the Captain and the Soldiers, the Head and members
have common enemies.

We are here the footstool of the wicked: but the time will come when they
shall be our footstool. The Israelites were the Egyptians footstool on
the earth, they drowned their children, they oppressed them with many burdens;
but they shall be their footstool in heaven.

The wicked now for a short time may domineere over the godly, they may make
long furrows on their backs, put them to much slavery, they may feed them
with the bread and water of affliction, as Achab did Micaiah: they may cast
them into stocks, prisons and dungeons, as they did Jeremiah: they may spit on
their faces, as they did on the blessed face of our Savior CHRIST: they may
rail on them with reproachful terms, as Shimei did on David: they may gibe
and jest at them, mock and deride them, as base Varlets did Job, whose Fathers
he disdained to set with the dogs of his flocks, and as impudent wretches
do now a days, even at the Preachers and Ministers themselves: stone them,
saw them in pieces, put them to the sword and fire. But let us be of good
comfort, we shall one day be Lords over them, they shall be our slaves and
vassals, yea the Lord will tread Satan, and all of them under our feet and make
them our very foot-stooles: the gates of hell may avayle, but cannot prevail
against us, we shall be Conquerours yea more than Conquerours over them all.
This Hamans Wife her self could see, Hest. 6.13.
If Mordecai be of the Jews seed -- If he be a faithful man appertaining to
CHRIST, thou do but strive against the stream to set thy self against him:
be thou never so great, never so mighty, never so malicious, thou shall be his
footstool in the end: let this encourage us against all enemies whatsoever.

VERSE 14.
Ye have heard what CHRIST is: Will ye know what the Angels be? for their
nature, they be spirits, yet created and finite: for their office, Ministers,
Officers, Apparitours, (...), public ministers, for the public good and
benefit. Servants, not Lord, as CHRIST is: sent forth, at the will and
commandment of an other. CHRIT is sent into the world, yet as a Son, not as
a servant: of his own free will, not by the simple authority of an other, as
the Angels be. All Angels are Ministers. Some are not ministrantes; some
assidentes, as Dionysius collecteth, Dan. 7.10. They all stand about GOD
expecting his pleasure to be sent by him.

They are principally for the elect: they are occupied about the wicked, as an
Angel destroyed the host of Senacherib, and slew Herod, but it is for the
godly their sake, Psalm. 34.7. Psalm. 91.11.12. They minister to God, as their
Lord and Master: to us, as their fellow servants at the appointment of the Lord.

Sometimes they are sent to instruct the godly in the will of God: as Isaiah 6.
to the Prophet in the Apocalypse, to John, to Cornelius, to the Shepherds, etc.
Sometimes to deliver them out of danger, as Lot out of Sodom: Peter out of
prison: to carry Lazarus soul into Abraham's bosom.

1. Here we may see, that the name of a Minister is an honorable name: Romans
13.4.
the Magistrate is a Minister, the Angels are Ministers, CHRIST himself was a
Minister, Romans 15.8.
even the Minister of circumcision, when he lived on the earth. Some profane
fellows there be, that think basely in their hearts, and speak irreverently
of the Ministers. I tell you, it is an Angelical name, an high and magnificent
title. Is it not an honorable office to serve the King or the Queen? We that
be the Ministers, are servants to Christ the King of Kings, and to his Church
the Lambs Wife: therefore think highly of us, because of our office. Is it a
grace to the Angels to be called Ministers, and shall it be a disgrace to us?
Nay, we will glory in it, and shame shall light on them that contemn the
Ministers of CHRIST.

2. Whose Ministers are the Angels? They be our Ministers, they Minister for
our sakes: and what be we in comparison of the Angels? They are spirits, we
flesh and blood: they holy, we unholy: they immortal, we mortal: they in
heaven, we on earth; yet they be our Ministers: they Minister to CHRIST, as to
their Lord and Master: to us, as to their fellow servants. But what an honor
is this to wretched and sinful man, that the Angels should be his Ministers?
As if the King should command an honorable Lord of his privy Counsel to wait
on a poor man in the Country, to conduct him from the Court to his own house:
the Angels are of Gods Court in heaven, and see his face continually. We are
silly worms on earth: yet the Lord has appointed them to attend on us, to be
our nurses, to carry us in their arms, that we dash not our foot against a
stone. Let us praise and magnify God, that has provided such keepers for us:
What is man, O Lord, that thou regardest him? thou have made him a little
lower, nay, a little higher than the Angels. The Angels are our Ministers: but
we are not the Angels Ministers. This is thy gracious goodness toward us, thy
name be blessed for it for ever and ever.

Whether he have appointed to every one of us a particular Angel or not, let
us not be too curious in the discussing of it: this is comfortable for us, that
we have many Angels to Minister to us: Their Angels, Matthew. 18.10.
says CHRIST of those that believe in him, not their Angel: not one Angel,
but many carried Lazarus his soul into Abraham's bosom.

3. What an unspeakable comfort is this for us? What a Tower of defense against
Satan and his Angels? The Devil compasses the earth to and fro, he walks up
and down like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour: and there be many
1000s of devils: there were a legion in one man. These by Gods permission raise
up tempests, stir up extraordinary winds, blow down houses, Nay, if God did
not bridle them, they would quickly tear us all in pieces: but let this be our
castle to fly unto: as there be bad Angels to hurt us; so there be good Angels
to defend us. There were Charrets and horsemen of fire round about Elisha: and
the Angels of God, though we cannot see them with our eyes, pitch their Tents
round about us: these be stronger than the Devil and his angels, because they
never sinned, and have God on their side. In the time of Popery the people were
much deluded with the walking of spirits, they durst not go through a
Churchyard in the night for fear of them. Sundry are afraid of Fairies and of
ill spirits, that haunt their houses: no doubt but the evil angels are busy
in all places, yet let us fear none of them all: we are guarded with the
celestial guard of holy Angels, that are able to protect us from them all;
especially, Christ Jesus is on our side, which is above all Angels; he sits at
Gods right hand, has all power in heaven and earth, he will preserve us from
all dangers in this life, and bring us to his everlasting Kingdom in the life
to come.

4 Seeing that God has ordained the Angels to be ministring-spirits, for our
sakes, which undoubtedly look carefully to their charge, seldom or never are
they absent from us, some or other are present with us continually: Let us do
nothing that may grieve these Heavenly Spirits: 1 Cor. 11.10.
let the Women be covered because of the Angels. So let not us swear and
blaspheme the Name of God, etc. because of the Angels. Men would blush to
commit filthiness in the presence of an honorable Personage; the Angels are
always present with us; therefore, even in respect of them, let us abstain
from sin.

CHAP. 2.
IN the former Chapter the Author (as in a Glass) showed the Deity of CHRIST,
and both simply and absolutely ratified it. Now he applies it to them to whom
he writes. Where 1. An application. 2. A transition to his humanity. In the
Application, 1. the Use. 2. the Reasons whereby it is pressed. 1. From the
incommodity. 2. From the punishment, set forth by a comparison.

(...): for so much as CHRIST the Author of the Gospel, is not only above the
Angels, but is the high and eternal God, being the natural Son of the
everlasting Father, and engraven form of his Person.

(...), we ought. So then it is not left to our discretion: we are tied with
the bond of necessity to it.

(...), intend our minds, that the things may be imprinted in our hearts, and
practiced in our lives.

(...), more abundantly. We should abound more in hearing, attention, and
practice, than they did, in the time of the Law: we should excel them by a
more rare and singular attention: for though the things are the same: yet the
party is not the same, by whom they are delivered.

It is not enough to hear Sermons every week, which is good and commendable,
but we must yield a diligent attention to the things that we hear: we
especially now in the time of the Gospel when God speaks to us by his own
Son. The people were bound to hear attentively in the time of the Law, when
the Prophets of God spoke to them: but much more are we, when the Son of God,
the Prince of Prophets, the Prophet of the Prophets speaks to us. All Samaria
gave heed to Simon Magus that bewitched them, Acts 8.10.
and lead them to the Devil: and shall not we give heed to Jesus Christ, that
labors to carry us to Heaven? Do not only hear, but attend to that which ye
hear. Luke 8.18.
Take heed how ye hear, whether loosely or carefully, profitably or
unprofitably. Lydia attended to the things that Paul spoke. Acts 16.14. We must
not only hear the Preacher, but attend to the things which he utters. An
Infant does not only take the dug into his mouth, but he sucketh at it, and
that with greediness. So we must not only lie at the big of the Word, but we
must suck sweet doctrines and heavenly instructions from it. The ground that
receives not the seed into it, will never be fruitful, if it lie aloft and be
not hidden in the bowels of the earth, it can never yield fruit: so when the
seed of the Word is sown, if we do not mark it and lay it up in our hearts,
hide it within us, as David did; the birds of the Air, that is, the devils
that fly up and down in the Church, will pick it up and run away with it.
Therefore let us diligently give heed to the things which we hear: hearing is
good, and they be commended that hear, yet that is not sufficient; a diligent
attendance must be given to that which we hear. When Christ reads a Divinity
Lecture to us, we that be his Scholars must attend to it. It is said of the
people, that they hung on Christ, watching the words that came from his mouth,
ready to receive them before they came: so with all care and diligence we must
hang on the Preacher; mark his words, and be ready to receive them into our
ears and hearts, even before they are delivered; so eager should we be of the
Word.

Especially now in the time of the Gospel: what attention is there in the
Star Chamber, when the Lords of the Privy Counsel speak? But if either the
Prince or the King himself make an Oration, then there is wonderful
attention. In the time of the Law the Prophets spoke, which indeed were of Gods
counsel, by whom God revealed his will to the people: but now the Prince of
peace, the everlasting Counselor, the Kings own Son, that lay in his own
bosom, in whom all the treasures of wisdom are hid, speaks to us. Therefore
let us listen with all diligence to the things which he speaks.

And how does Christ now speak? Not daily from Heaven, as he did to Saul: but
by the mouth of his Ambassadors. He that hears you, hears me: will ye have
an experience of Christ that speaks in me? Christ spoke in Paul, when he
preached; and he speaks in us when we preach. The Pearl is precious though
it be in an earthen vessel, that brings it to you: therefore receive it with
all reverence. We ought more diligently to give heed to the things which we
hear, and yet we are more negligent in hearing, than they were in time past:
an egregious fault! Let it be amended by us all.

The reason is taken, 1. From the danger: lest we be as wet paper which
blotteth out the words and letters that are written in it, so as they cannot be
read: Psalm. 68.2.
or lest we perish as water that runs over and is spilt on the ground, as
wax that melts away before the fire. The words following seem to ratify
this interpretation, (...). Chrysostom.

Ne praeterfluamus: lest we run by, or run over: lest we be like to Sieves and
Vessels full of holes, out of which the water runs out immediately, so soon
as it is powered in: as he said in Terence, Plenus sum rimarum, huc et illuc
diffluo: lest we run by, as water does by a way, and stays not. So lest we
pass by the celestial doctrine propounded to us, and regard it not, we must
dwell upon the things which we hear, by a serious meditation, and not flow
(like water) from one thing to another.

We must let the Word slip at no time, though we have never such weighty
business: One thing is necessary. This one thing necessary is to be preferred
before all others: never let a Sermon slip from you without some profit. I, but
how shall we keep them from slipping away? There be four things to hold the
Word from slipping from us?

1 A meditation in that which we have heard: blessed is the man that
meditateth in the Law of God. When thou have heard a Sermon, take some time to
meditate in it, that thou may imprint it on thy memory.

This is a common fault among us. The word of God preached to us passes away
as water on a stony Rock. When we are once out of the Church, we never think
on it again: therefore no marvel though it slip away from us.

The 2d. thing to hold it, is conference with others. The Disciples that
traveled to Emaus, conferred together: Luke 24.14.
the Bereans that came from S. Paul his Sermon took their Bibles and conferred
together of the Sermon: many eyes see more than one: Acts 17.11.
that which one has forgotten, another may remember. Therefore let Christians
recount the things they have heard, and that repetition will be as a nail to
fasten the things they heard.

The 3d. is prayer. Our corporal meat will not thrive, except GOD bless it:
therefore they that have any fear of GOD, have grace before and after meals:
no more can the food of our souls do us good without the blessing of God upon
it: therefore it behooves us to pray both when we come to Church, and go from
Church, that he would send us good speed, and bless his word to us.

The 4th. is a care to practice that which we have heard. This is the digesting
of our spiritual meat, and the converting of it into our substance. Many
hear, but few care to practice that which they hear: it is never our own
truly and indeed, till it be practiced: that will make us grow up as perfect
men in CHRIST JESUS. We hear swearing reproved; yet we swear still:
drunkenness inveighed against; yet we are drunk still: envy and malice
controlled; yet malicious still, yea, against the Preachers, that are as Gods
arm to pull us out of our sins: a manifest argument that we hold not that,
which we hear, but suffer it without fruit to slip from us. Shall a Child be
put to a Nurse, that has abundance of milk and be never a whit the fatter
for it? Has God sent you many spiritual Nurses, that in great plenty have
delivered the sincere milk of the Word to you (and are you never a whit the
better for it? Surely GOD will require it at your hands.

Does a man sit at a table well furnished every day, and yet is he lean and in
no good plight? There is some internal let in himself, as there was in
Amnon. Has God spread before you a rich Table of his word, where you had dish
upon dish, meat upon meat, and yet are you lean and ill favored, do you not
grow up by the Word? truly your meat is ill-bestowed on you, and GOD shall
deal justly with you if he take it quite away from you: therefore let us
attend diligently to the things that we hear, that they slip not from us, but
may remain and continue with us to the salvation of us all.

VERSE 2.
THE second reason to enforce the use is drawn from the punishment, which is
set forth comparatively.

The greatest part of Interpreters by the word spoken by Angels, understand the
Law, which they say was given by the Ministry of Angels, grounding on those
places, Acts 7.53. Gal. 3.19. Whereas, if the words be examined in the
Original, they imply no such matter. Stephen says not, that they received the
Law by the Ministry of Angels, but among the Orders or Ranks of Angels, that
is, the Angels, by whom the fearful Trumpet was sounded, as a celestial
Guard and Army attending upon God at the present time, which gave the Law to
the people: and in the Galatians it is, among the Angels by the hand of a
Mediator: therefore by the word spoken by Angels, is not meant the Law, but any
doctrine or admonition whatsoever, which God sent to man by Angels in the Old
Testament. The Lord then used much the Ministry of Angels, and by them he
revealed his will to them, the which if they despised and regarded not, they
were surely punished for it, as Lots sons in law that would not believe the
destruction of Sodom, and Zachary that would not give credit to the Angels
speech was made dumb: yea, even the word spoken by the Prophets, though but
men, was severely punished; much more shall that which is spoken by CHRIST.

Was steadfast, that is remained firm and unmovable against the contumacie and
stubbornness of them that resisted it. It took effect in despite of all the
adversaries, though they strove with might and maine against it.

Not some, but every one. GOD suffered none to go unpunished, some copies have
(...), responsation.

Transgression has reference to those things that are forbidden, (...) to
those that be commanded: every swarving or declining from the right way, every
stubborn contempt, when men will scant vouchsafe to give it the hearing, or
reject that which they hear.

Received a just recompense, a lawful recompense, which cannot be gaine-sayed;
pronounced by the Law it self, Deuteronomy. 28. from Verse 15. ad finem. They were
diversely punished.

Of reward: both good works and evil are rewarded, 2 Timothy 4.14.

VERSE 3.
WE would seek ways of escaping, any hole or crany to escape by, but we
shall find none: he makes them Judges. I appeal to your own selves, Judge you.

He does not say, if we contemn, secretly or openly, Ier. 48.10.
but if we neglect. The careless neglect of the Gospel shall pull damnation
on us.

He does not say, so great a word, as before: but, so great salvation. A
glorious and comfortable title, which cannot be ascribed to the law: that
kills, it does not save. 2 Cor. 3.
Saint Paul calls the law a killing letter, the ministration of death and of
condemnation: but the Gospel says. It is the word of salvation, Act. 13.26.
The power of GOD to salvation, Romans 1.16. So that, they which contemn it,
contemn their own salvation.

So great as can not be expressed by the tongue of men and Angels: wrought by
so great a Savior, Tit. 2.13. So great as eye has not seen, ear heard,
neither entered into the heart of man to conceive: not a saving of us from, our
enemies in this world: but of soul and body from the Devil, death and
damnation in the world to come. Great also in eternity and durance: for it
shall never have end.

The greatness of this salvation is amplified three kind of ways.

1. By the first Preacher and divulger of it. 2. By those worthy instruments
that succeeded him. 3. By the miracles wherewith it was graced.
That which we hear is salvation; a matter of great weight and singular
importance: Ephesians. 1.13. Act. 13.26. Romans 1.16.
therefore let us not neglect it. If a man lie in a deep pit ready to be
drowned, and one come to him offering him his hand to pull him out, will he not
listen to him? The preaching of the word is Gods hand, to pull us out of the
pit of hell, and shall we neglect it? If a man tell thee of a Lord-ship which
thou may have for a little money, will thou not give him the hearing? We
bring you tidings, not of an earthly Lordship, but of an everlasting kingdom,
which you may have without Gold and without Silver, only reaching out the hand
of faith to apprehend it, and shall we turn away our ears, and not regard it?
How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation? When men are at a
play, they will be attentive: and the preaching of the word, whereby we may be
saved in the life to come, is had in small estimation. What a lamentable thing
is this? This must needs pull the wrath of GOD on us. We count it a small
matter to neglect the Word of GOD: yet they that do it shall hardly escape the
vengeance of GOD: how shall they escape, says the Apostle? Certainly with
great difficulty: therefore let us be diligent hearers of it.

The threatenings of Angels, if despised were severely punished: and shall not
the threatenings of the Son of GOD in the ministry of the Word? The Preachers
in the name of CHRIST thunder out GODS judgments, against swearing,
profanations, etc. A number hear them, and are no more moved than the stones
in the wall: but GOD will meet with such, they shall hardly escape, GOD will
one way or other make them feel the smart of his heavy hand: there is no way
of escaping for them. Therefore let us with reverence tremble at the word.

Which at the first began. Having taken a beginning to be preached by the LORD,
which brought it first out of the bosom of his Father, he did not introduce it
into this world by stealth, secretly, as heresies and fantasies are wont to
be, but openly: Christ always taught in the Synagogues, and in the Temple.

The Lord. That is, the LORD JESUS, the LORD of heaven and earth.

The LORD often so called: not by Angels, as the Law: but by the LORD, the
natural SON of GOD: not by mortal men, as Plato, Aristotle, etc. In this
respect the Gospel should be most welcome to us.

The LORD JESUS Himself was the Preacher of the Gospel: Luke 8.1.
he went up and down through Cities and Towns preaching the Gospel.

The first Sermon he made was in Nazareth, where he was brought up: from
thence he went up to Jerusalem, etc. CHRIST was a Preacher, and shall we think
basely of Preachers? Was it not an high office, which the Son of GOD will
take on him? CHRIST would not be a King, be refused that: then what wretches
are they that will rail on Preachers, gibe and jest at them; make songs of
them? Reverence the Preachers, seeing CHRIST Himself was a Preacher.

And was confirmed unto us, etc.

Some expound it thus: and after them that heard it of Christ: it was confirmed
to me, that is, after it was preached by CHRIST, and the first Apostles that
heard him on the earth, it was confirmed to me also as a later Apostle, yet one
that heard and saw CHRIST from heaven: rather, Paul in modesty and humility
puts himself in the number of the common Saints and Christians, 1 Cor. 15.8 9.
to whom the Gospel was confirmed by the miracles of the Apostles, or by the
Apostles that heard Christ.

Or, he does not speak here of his doctrine, as if he received that from the
Apostles: but that he was confirmed in the truth of the Gospel by the
miracles of the Apostles, which was no disparagement to him.

This is the strongest argument: to persuade some, that this is none of Paul's
Epistle. Saint Paul is wont to stand stiffely on the reputation of his
Apostle-ship: he had his doctrine not from men, but God: he was not inferior
to the chiefest Apostles: whereas the Author of this Epistle was one of the
Apostles Scholars; he had the doctrine of the Gospel not at the first hand,
but at the second.

This may be answered diverse kind of ways.

1. Both these may well be applied to Saint Paul: the LORD JESUS first
preached the Gospel to him from heaven, when he called him, and he was
confirmed in it by Ananias.

2 It may be a rhetorical (...), frequent in divine and profane writings:
when as the speaker assumes that to himself, which is proper to the hearers,
and by a Synecdoche includes himself in their number: as the Penman of this
Epistle says, how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation? yet he
was none of them that neglected this salvation, Heb. 10.26. Yet he did not
commit that wilful and horrible sin against the Holy Ghost. Paul, 1 These.
4.17. says, We that are alive; yet he was not alive at Christ's second
coming: so though he say, which was confirmed to us, yet he speaks in the
name of the Hebrews, not of his own: as 1 Pet. 1.12. where S. Peter seems to
exempt himself out of the number of the Apostles, yet he was one.

3 S. Paul by conference with the Apostles, that heard Christ preach when he
was on the earth, might without any disparagement to him be the more confirmed
in the truth of the Gospel.

4 He does not say he was confirmed, but the Doctrine was; and that clause
(...), imports not the persons, but the time.

Was confirmed to us: that is, to our time, by those that heard him, some of
them being still alive even in our time: the Law and the Prophets were to John,
that is, to John's time. The Gospel in England has been continued to us,
that is, to our time: not by me alone which am a secondary Apostle borne out of
time; but by the first Apostles of all: those after Christ preached to you
Hebrews.

VERSE 4.
GOD Himself was a witness to the Gospel: therefore let us believe it.

But how did GOD bear witness to it? by signs and wonders, etc. Then they
came not from Satan, but from GOD.

Signa, quia significant, the Divine Power and Majesty of God. Signs are any
miracles in general: as the fleece to Gedeon, etc. Hezekiahs sign.

(...), prodigia, quod porro dicant. Some call them praedicidia, because they
do praedicere aliquid mali, terrible miracles of GOD's wrath and judgment: as
the striking of Ananias and Sapphira with sudden death, the killing of Herod by
the Angel, the blindness of Elymas the Sorcerer: but it is sometimes taken
also, for miracles of mercy.

And with diverse miracles, (...), whereby the power of God is showed to the
world. Act. 2.43. cap. 5.12. The distributions of the Holy Ghost. 1. Because
they be freely, and frankly bestowed by him. 2. Because liberally and
bountifully. vid. 1 Cor. 12.8, 9, 10.

The reason moving him to this distribution is, no merits in us: but his own
blessed will: his gracious goodness is the cause of all, both of sending the
Gospel by Christ, and of confirming it by so many miracles and gifts.

There be counterfeit miracles, Matthew. 24.24. 2 These. 2.9. and true miracles:
they may be distinguished by the matter, the cause, and the end.

1 Sometimes they seem to be that which they are not: as the walking of
spirits in Churchyards: blood in their breaden god, whereas they be but a
cousenage.

2 They may be substantial for the matter, and yet effected by a wrong cause;
as the Sorcerers in Egypt brought forth true Frogs, etc. yet by the Devil, not
by the finger of GOD: and they may be wrought by a natural cause which men see
not, nor can comprehend; as they shut up Mahomet in an Iron-Chest, brought him
into a Temple, and made it hang aloft, which was done by Loadstones, that the
silly people were ignorant of: There was a Lamp in Venus Temple that burnt
continually, which some thought to be a miracle; whereas it was done by a
certain stone called Asbestus which was found in Arcadia.

3 By the end. If it be to confirm falsehood, it is a bad miracle, Deuteronomy. 13.1.
though never so glorious.

Whereas a true miracle is effected by the power of GOD, exceeds the bounds
of Nature, and is for the confirmation of the truth.

The Gospel at the beginning was adorned with many miracles.

1. Because it seemed strange to the world, a new doctrine. 2. Because it
seemed repugnant to the law of Moses instituted by GOD. 3. Because it could not
be proved and confirmed by natural reasons.
But now since the famous miracles of CHRIST Resurrection, ascension into
heaven, of the sending of the Holy Ghost, of the spreading of the Gospel over
all the world, we must not still curiously gape after miracles: that is
reproved, Matthew. 12.39. Ioh. 4.48. Luke 23.8. To the law and the testimony,
Isai. 8.20. the people must resort.

The glory of miracles with the Papists is a note of the Church: and they
brag much of their miracles: they have one thousand miracles to our one.
Bernard the Monk restored sight to a blind man. Dominicus raised up three from
the dead, Antoninus 38.

Franciscus Xavorius the Jesuit cured many dumb, lame and blind in India. As
for us, we have no miracles: therefore ours is not the Church. What of all
this? Ioh. 10.41.
John Baptist wrought never a miracle, yet he was a good Preacher sent from God.

But for the determination of this point. In some sense we will not deny but
that miracles may be notes of the Church: but here we must distinguish of notes
and of miracles too. One true note of the Church, is the sound preaching of the
Word. where that is to beget men, and women to CHRIST, there is the Church: yet
miracles may be an ornament to the Church, a confirmation of it in the truth
of the Gospel.

But what miracles?

1. Not forged or counterfeit, as the miracles of the Papists be, their juggling
being brought to light, and detected to all the world: but true miracles,
wrought by the finger of GOD. not lying wonders, with the which Antichrist
should come and delude the world.

2. Not new miracles, that came yesterday out of the mint, but the old and
ancient miracles of CHRIST and his Apostles are a demonstration of the Church
and of the truth of the Gospel: that the Gospel might be carried more
speedily throughout the world miracles were requisite at the beginning, but now
no such necessity of them.

A wicked and crooked generation seeks a sign. Herod would feign see CHRIST,
that he might see some miracle done by him. Let us not now gape after new
miracles: the miracles wherewith God honored the Gospel at the first, were
sufficient for the confirmation of it to all posterity.

The rich man in Hell would feign have had a miracle for the saving of his
brethren. Lazarus must be sent from the dead to them: but it was answered him,
they have Moses and the Prophets, that is enough: if we will not believe for
the preaching of the word, all the miracles in the world will not save us.

Yet the Gospel at this day has many miracles, though they be not observed:
men are metamorphosed and changed by it: of proud, they become humble; of
Devils, Saints: men are raised from the death of sin by it; they that were
blind in the knowledge of CHRIST, are come to a clear sight in matters of
religion: they that were lame and could not walk in the way to the kingdom of
heaven, are made to run cheerfully in it: they that were dumb and could not
speak for CHRIST, are made to speak wisely and boldly in his quarrel.

These are excellent miracles, which might procure an estimation of the Gospel
in our hearts.

Now for so much as the LORD honored the Gospel with so many miracles, let us
yield a reverent attention to it, and not neglect so great salvation, which
with so many great and wonderful miracles has been so much graced by GOD;
let us lay it up in our hearts, let us frame our lives according to it, that
we may feel the power and comfort of it in our hearts, and be saved eternally
by CHRIST in the world to come.

He returns to CHRIST, where, 1. A farther confirmation of his deity. 2. A
transition to his humanity, Verse 10. His deity is confirmed by this argument:
He, to whom the world is subject, is God: the world is subject to CHRIST. Ergo,
he is God. The proposition is laid down, Verse 5. Where the negative part
alone is expressed: but the affirmative is to be supplied. Not to the Angels,
but to CHRIST, which is the heir of all things, the Lord of the whole world.

The assumption is laid down, Verse 6. Which is confirmed by a testimony out
of the Psalms: Where, 1. The allegation: 2. The application of it.


In the allegation an admiration of the goodness of GOD.

1. The dejection of man.

2. His exaltation, by his neerenesse to the Angels, by his dominion over all
creatures. In the Application, 1. An exposition. 2. An anticipation.


VERSE 5.
NOw he comes to the confutation of them, that opposed themselves to the Deity
of CHRIST: wherein we have two things.

1. A constant holding of the conclusion, that CHRIST is GOD. 2. An overthrow
of the argument against the Deity.
The conclusion soundly and largely ratified before is confirmed by a new
argument: if the world be subject to CHRIST, not to the Angels; then he is God,
superior to the Angels: but the world is subject to him, not to the Angels,
ergo.

Here the word (...) is to be supplied.

The word (...), does signify to subject in a military rank or order, when as
the whole army is subjected to one captain, leader or governor, as the
Church is to CHRIST.

Whether has this coherence with that which went before, Quest.
or with that which follows after?

Some think it is a proof of that, Verse 3. That CHRIST was called ( Lord.)
The world is subject to him: therefore he is Lord of all.

Others that it is a confirmation of that in the former Cha. concerning Christ's
superiority over the Angels. It may have dependence on the words going before;
for he does all things according to his own will, in regard whereof he has
subjected the whole world to his Son, not to the Angels.

It is rather a patheticall introduction of the maine conclusion: which still
he keeps in mind, and prefixeth as a firm foundation; the adversaries with
all their cunning are not able to shake: say what they will, yet Christ is God:
for he has subjected the world to him. As for the Lord: they deliver that
first as the ground of all.

What is meant by the world to come?

Some expound it of that time and part of the world that is to come, since the
public preaching of the Gospel, till Christ's second coming. In the former
time of the world, while the Law was in force, Moses and the Angels seemed to
bear sway, by whom the law was delivered: but the world to come in the time of
the Gospel God has subjected to Christ, not to the Angels. Others interpret
it of the world to come, after the day of judgment. In this world the Angels
seem to have rule, they be the governors of the world, Satan is the Prince of
the world: but in the world to come, the Angels shall have nothing to do: 1
Cor. 15.24.
that shall be wholly subject to Christ alone.

Yet the Apostles meaning seems to be more general: the whole world both
present and to come is subject to CHRIST: he has all power in heaven and
earth, and Ephesians. 1.20.21. Phil. 2.9. and the Apostle alleges out of the
Psalm, Verse 8. that all things are put in subjection under him.

The world in general is said to come, in respect of CHRIST, which was from
all eternity: CHRIST was always the everlasting Jehovah. Before Abraham was, I
Am: but the world in time was to come. Now this world to come with all things,
with all creatures contained in it, above and beneath, has the LORD subjected
to CHRIST, not to the Angels: ergo, he is God above the Angels and all other
creatures. Thus our Savior Christ the second Adam, is said to come in regard
of the first Adam, that went before him, Romans 5.14. So the world is said to
come in respect of CHRIST, that went before the world.

By the world to come is meant the whole company of Gods elect, that shall be
gathered together in the life to come: the which is termed the world to come,
because both the number and perfection of them is to come: the whole number not
yet being accomplished in this world, nor having aspired to perfection.

This agrees with that which went before: if we neglect so great salvation
which is reposed for us in the world to come: the which world, God has subdued
to Christ, that he may be the King of the Church and reign for ever.

Whereof we speak in this our treatise, showing that all things are subject to
Christ: who is not only superior to the Angels, as he is God alone; but even
as he is God and man, the mediator of the Church.

VERSE 6.
THen he comes to the Argument: which the adversaries used for the overthrow of
CHRIST'S Deity. Man is inferior to the Angels; CHRIST was a man: therefore,
inferior to the Angels.

The proposition they proved out of the Psalm: What is man? thou have made him
a little lower than the Angels.

To this he answers.i. confessing Christ to be a man, and in regard of
humane infirmities, his death, passion, etc. inferior to the Angels: yet the
same man Jesus Christ, being God too, is advanced above the Angels.

The proof of the proposition: One says in a certain place, etc.

Why does he shoot at rovers, not at pricks?

He speaks not this in contempt: but. 1. Because the Psalms were well known
to the Jews above other portions of Scripture, being sung continually at home
in their houses, and publicly in their Synagogues: therefore Saint Paul
thinks it needless to name the place, which was common and trivial among
them all. One says, you know whom I mean, I need not to name any.

2 Peradventure it was doubtful who was the Penman of the Psalm, whether
David, Asaph, or one of the Sons of Chore: therefore S. Paul says generally,
one says: it makes no matter who he was, the Holy Ghost being the author of
the Psalm.

3 He did not well remember at the present what Psalm in order it was:
therefore he contents himself with a general allegation.

Many now a days take a pride in quoting the very Chapter and Verse. S. Paul
was not so scrupulous: no more were the ancient Fathers: they thought it
sufficient to cite Scripture, oftentimes not naming the Book, out of the which
the testimony was desumed. And indeed it was a long time before the Scripture
was sorted into Chapters: of late years was it divided into verses. Let us be
sure to (...) the Scripture aptly and fitly: and let us not be curious about
chapter and verse, which were but of late invention.

Here you have an admiration of Gods goodness toward man. What is man?
Aenosh, of Anash, indoluit, aegrotavit, a receptacle of all miseries: or of
[Nashash] oblivisci: he has forgotten thee; yet thou have not forgotten him:
or, the son of Adam, the progeny and offspring of man: what a vile and
contemptible thing, of no worth, of no value? In respect of his original, he
is dust; for the course of his life on the face of the earth, he is subject to
all griefs, sorrows, sicknesses, diseases, a continual sinner against thee:
for his end, he is wormes-meat.

That thou once mindest him: that thou have such a fatherly care over him: that
thou carriest him in thy remembrance: that thou have written him in thy
Table-bookes, and art mindful continually to do him good? Non vacat exiguis
rebus adesse Iovi, said the Poet.

Visitest him? There is Visitatio irae and gratiae: not in judgment, Luke
1.68.78
but in mercy: as appears by that which follows: as a Physician his
Patient, or a Father his Son.

Elizabeth wondered that the Virgin Mary should visit her. Whence comes this
to me, that the Mother of my Lord, etc. Much more may we admire this
visitation, that the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords should visit us.

For So Much as this Psalm is applied to the Messiah by our Savior Christ, Mat.
21.16. and by Paul, 1 Cor. 15.27. the Author of this Epistle does directly
apply it to him in the words following: Sundry learned and godly men apply it
first and principally to our Savior Christ: but I see not how that can be:
shall we say of CHRIST, What is he, that God should be mindful of him? his
beloved Son in whom he is well pleased, that never did any thing amiss, that
never transgressed his Commandment: though he be a man as we are, yet he
is an unspotted man, separate from sinners, higher than the heavens: as he is
man, so he is GOD too; and shall we say of him, What is he, that God should
visit him?

Sundry things in this Psalm must needs be applied to him: but not the whole
Psalm. It is not so in any Psalm. First it is understood of the type, then of
him that is figured by the type.

What is man? He does not speak of man in his first creation: he retained that
estate but a while: therefore he would rather have deplored, than admired it.
He does not speak of man as he is after his fall, for in that respect he is
most miserable, not glorious: therefore he must needs speak of man, as he is
ingraffed into Christ by whom he is advanced to wonderful and unspeakable
glory.

What is man? Not only considered in his first creation, but even in his
renovation: what is the best man that ever was? What is Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob? What is Moses, David, Peter, Paul? What is the holiest man on the face
of the earth, that God should have any respect to him? by creation indeed he is
the workmanship of God, the image of God Almighty; yet for all that, in
respect of his original, he was taken out of the ground: he is but a piece of
earth, since the fall, he is a mass of sin: though he be regenerate, and by
faith ingraffed into Christ, yet still he has sin in him, and must dye.
Therefore what is this man, that thou should power down so many blessings
on him? That the Sun, Moon, and Stars, should give him light? That the birds
of the Air, fishes of the Sea, the beasts of the field should be his meat?
That he should walk as a King on the earth? especially that thou should
send thy only Son to dye for him, make him a member of his body, and provide an
everlasting kingdom for him in the life to come? What is vile, wretched,
sinful, corrupted man, that thou should be so far mindful of him?
Protect him with the shield of thy favors from all dangers? That thou
should vouchsafe him thy word and Sacraments? That thou should give him
thy holy Spirit to help him to pray, and to comfort him in all miseries?

We should not be like the Peacock spreading forth our golden feathers, and say
within our selves, what goodly men be we? we ought to think basely of our
selves: what are we that God should regard us?

What am I and my Fathers house, said that regal Prophet, that thou have
brought me hitherto? What are we miserable wretches, worms meat, that God
Almighty should do any thing for us? we are less than the least of all his
mercies. Yet we are wont to vaunt of our selves: do ye not know who I am?
Do thou not consider to whom thou speak? yes, very well. I speak to dust
and ashes. Let no high conceit of our selves enter into our minds: let us
think basely of our selves: What am I, O Lord, that thou should give me the
least thing in the world? A drop of drink, a crust of bread, an hole to hide
my head in, especially that thou should give me thine only Son, and together
with him all things that be good?

What is any man in the world? Art thou a rich man? God can puff away thy
riches and make thee poor: Art thou a wise man? God can take away thy senses
and make thee a fool: art thou a beautiful man? God can send the pox and many
diseases to take away thy beauty: art thou a strong man? God can send sickness
and make thee weak: art thou a Gentleman, a Knight, a Lord? yet thy breath is
in Gods hand. This night he can take away thy soul from thee, and what art
thou then? therefore let us all have an humble opinion of our selves: let us
cast down our selves at Gods feet, and say, What are we, O Lord, that thou art
mindful of us, that thou so graciously visitest us, especially with thy
everlasting mercies in Christ Jesus?

VERSE 7.
MAclohim. Some interpret it, then God, as Hierome, Bucer. But the seventy
Interpreters translate it, Angels: so does the Chalde Paraphrase: and the word
in Scripture is most commonly applied to them.

The Angels are glorious creatures: and when we speak of an excellent man, we
call him an Angel, 1 Samuel 29.9. 2 Samuel 14.20. Acts 6.15.

There is not much ods between the Angels and us: they are immortal wholly;
we immortal in part: they have no sin, because they never fell; we that are
ingrafted into Christ have sin within us, yet it is covered with the garment of
Christ's righteousness, so that it is not imputed to us.

They have a rule and dominion under GOD in the world; whereupon they are
called, principalities, powers, thrones, dominations: and we have a rule in
the world too, all things through CHRIST being subjected to us: they are in
heaven, and behold the face of God: So we one day shall be in heaven and like
the Angels: they are endewed with wisdom, knowledge and understanding; So are
we, though we come short of them by many a mile: they are our brethren and
fellow servants: in sundry things, there is not much difference between them
and us. We are but a little inferior to them: we have massy, heavy, sinful,
corruptible bodies: So have not they. They took to them true bodies for a
time, but those bodies were no essential parts of them, they were not
personally united to them, as ours are. Otherwise there is no great difference,
no not between the Angels and us. How are we to magnify God, that has so
highly exalted man? The consideration hereof should cause us to lead a life in
some acceptable measure worthy of that honor whereunto we be advanced. We are
not much inferior to the Angels: yet a number of our lives are as ill, nay,
worse than bruit beasts. The Ox knows his owner, the Ass his masters crib:
but we will not know, love and fear that God which feeds us.

A Dog will love his Master that makes much of him; we will not love, no not
those, that deserve well at our hands. A Dove will keep her self to her own
mate: many of us will not keep our selves to our own Wives: bring an horse to
the water, to the sweetest water in the world, he will drink no more than will
do him good: we are excessive and more than brutish in drinking, all places
ring of this sin, this beastly sin of drunkenness: what a vile thing is
this? How do we forget our selves? Has GOD made us but a little inferior to
the Angels, and shall we live like bruit beasts, and give over our selves to
all uncleanness? How do we disgrace that worthy estate whereunto God has
advanced us? As we draw near to the Angels any kind of ways, so let us, so
far as is possible, lead an angelical life with the Angels in this world,
that we may remain with them in the world to come.

Thou crownedst him. He shows wherein our excellency does consist: he has
made him a King and set a Crown on his head.

With many glorious gifts, that are a wonderful honor to man, both external
and internal, especially with the knowledge of CHRIST, wherein consists
eternal life.

One part of that glory is, that he has a Soveraigntie and dominion over all
creatures, which was given him at the creation, Genesis 1. renewed and ratified
by GODS seal after the flood, Genesis 9. enlarged (no doubt) to the faithful
by CHRIST 1 Cor. 3.21.

VERSE 8.
Under his feet. This agrees to all men in general: to the faithful in
special, whom God has made Kings and Lords over all his creatures by CHRIST.
But principally it is to be understood of our SAVIOR CHRIST, 1 Cor. 15.27.
who is the chief Lord of the world, the King and mediator of the Church: he
has all power in heaven and earth. All things, yea, even the Devils themselves
are put in subjection under his feet. God has given him a name above every
name, that at the name of JESUS every knee should bow, Phil. 2.9. We also by
him: because we are members of his body and his brethren, we have an interest
to all creatures: all things throughout the wide world are ours. The heaven,
the earth, the birds, the beasts, the fishes, the trees, the flowers are ours:
Death is ours: the very Devil himself is our slave and subject: God has put
him under our feet.

1. Here we may behold the dignity of Christians: all things by JESUS CHRIST
are under our dominion. O what a bountiful GOD is this, that has given us so
large a possession! Let us sound forth his praises for it, and use his
liberality to his glory. As God said to Peter, arise, kill, and eat; when the
sheet full of all kind of creatures was let down to him from heaven: Acts 10.
so does he say to us all: we may freely eat of all creatures whatsoever: but
let us not abuse GODS creatures to his dishonor and our destruction. Let, us
use them soberly, religiously, to make us more cheerful in the service of our
God.

2 Let us not stand in a slavish fear of any creature; of the stars, the
winds, no not of the Devils themselves: for all are put in subjection under
our feet, by Jesus Christ that loved us, and has given us a superiority over
all; we shall be conquerers over them all; a singular comfort to the faithful!
Satan may tempt and assault us, but God will tread him under our feet.

3 For this dominion let us thank the Lord Jesus Christ. Of our selves we are
worth nothing, stark beggars: in CHRIST and by CHRIST we have all that we
have. Let us magnify him for it. Then he concludes from the general to the
special. If all things be subject to him, then nothing is exempted from his
Dominion, no not the Angels themselves.

To the former the adversaries again replied: thou talkest of a glorious
Empire, Rule, and Dominion, whereunto Christ is advanced, but it is an
imaginary conquest: for we see not all things subdued to him. The Kings and
Princes of the earth, cast away his yoke, and submit not themselves to the
Scepter of his Word. Satan and his instruments rebel against him: sin and
death still play the tyrants, and are not subdued to him.

VERSE. 9.
TO that he answers. 1. Though we see it not, yet all things may be subject to
him: we see not God; yet there is a God: we see not our own soul: yet we have
a soul. Here it is (...): there is a difference between videre and cernere:
we do discern so as it cannot be denied: a man may see a thing and yet not
discern it.

2 He answers it by a distinction of submission, or subjection. The one is
external, conspicuous to the eye of the world: the other internal, seen by
the eye of faith. Christ's kingdom is not of this world; it is not temporal,
but spiritual: all things are subdued to him, though he suffer his enemies for
the trial and exercise of his children to tyrannize over them for a time. A
Beareheard may have a Bear under his rule and authority, though he suffer him
now and then to range abroad: so has Christ the Devil. Yet we see Jesus, that
was made a little lower than the Angels, through the suffering of death, to be
crowned with glory and honor.

These words, [ Through the suffering of death,] may be referred to that which
goes before, or follows after: after he had suffered death, he was crowned
with glory, as Phil. 2.9.

But rather refer them to the former: he was made a little lower than the
Angels through suffering of death. (...), a little while: refer it to the time,
that is, during his death, passion, Act 5.34.
continuance in the grave 3. days, and 3. nights: all this while he was
inferior to the Angels: not at the time he lived upon the earth; for Mat. 4.11.
The Angels Ministered to him as servants to their Lord. But in his Passion, and
Death, the Deity withdrew his power, and the humanity was left alone: then he
was lower than the Angels: the Angels are immortal, and dye not; Christ was
mortal, and died: in that respect he was inferior to them.

But he was afterward exalted to all glory and dignity, placed at the right
hand of God, and so superior to the Angels.

We that are the faithful, see him crowned with glory and honor; in that he
raised up himself from the dead, ascended into heaven in a cloud in the sight
of his Disciples, the Angels attending on him; in that Stephen saw him sitting
at the right hand of God; in that he sent down the Holy Ghost from heaven, and
by a few simple men to look to, through the preaching of the Gospel conquered
all the world. We may all see him crowned with glory and honor. Thus he is
higher than the Angels, though through the suffering of death, he was for a
time lower than they: Christ truly suffered death, not phantastically, in a
fantastical body, as the Manichees and Apollinarists dreamed; he felt and
endured the bitter pangs of death.

Which is illustrated by two causes, the efficient, and final: the efficient,
is the grace, love, and mercy of God, John 3.16. the final, that as much as
lay in Christ, all men might be saved.

CHRIST's death was sufficient for all, 1 Timothy 2.4. effectual only to them
that believe, Isay 9.6. Mat. 26.28. Physic is offered to many sick Patients,
that may do them good, if they will receive it: but many are so froward that
they will none of it: the fault why they do not recover, is not in the
physic, nor in the Physician, but in themselves: so CHRIST offers the
sovereign medicine of salvation, purchased by his death, to all: but some
reject it, and will not believe it can save them. It is effectual for all
those that be sanctified, that be his brethren, as it is expounded afterward.

Whereas it is said, that Christ tasted death, therein he dealt as the
Physician does: he needs not the physike prepared for his patients; yet the
better to induce them to take it, he tastes of it himself before their eyes.
So death belonged not to Christ, because he had no sin: yet he would taste of
it, that we might be more willing to taste and drink of that cup. The Metaphor
must not be pressed too far: as if Christ did but sip and taste of the cup of
death; as a man tastes vinegar, but drinks not of it: for he swallowed it up
quite, 1 Cor. 15.54.

It is a borrowed speech. Death is resembled to a cup whereof CHRIST did taste:
let this cup pass from me. This has reference to the time that he continued
in death, not to the sharpness of his death.

They that taste of a thing, tarry not long at it, their lips are quickly
removed from it: so CHRIST did not continue long in death, not past three days
and three nights: he did but taste as it were of it, and so away: yet he truly
dyed, and it was a most bitter taste to him.

Thus the tasting of death was no dishonor, but an honor to Christ.

By it he brought many to eternal life: for all that he is above the Angels,
and all other creatures whatsoever.

CHRIST has tasted of death before us: therefore let not us that be
Christians, be too much afraid of death. There is a potion brought to a sick
Patient, which the eye loathes, and the mouth distasts. The poor sick man is
loath to drink of it, the Physician takes it into his hand, tastes of it before
his eyes: by that he is encouraged to receive it: so is it with us, death is a
sour cup, which nature abhors: we are all unwilling naturally to drink of
it; but for so much as Christ our loving and heavenly Physician has tasted of
it before hand, let us not be afraid of it. The godliest men in the world
cannot but in some measure fear death; Christ feared it, Et non est fortior
miles quam Imperator: yet let this be as Sugar to sweeten this bitter Cup to
us; CHRIST tasted of it, and overcame it: so shall we do by his virtue and
power. As after the receipt of a purgation, the body is the better, more sound
than before: so after we have drunk this bitter Cup, of Death, both in soul
and body we shall be the better, far more glorious than before: therefore let
us be willing, whenever it shall seem good to the Lord for us to taste it.

All of us should have died eternally: At what time thou eatest thereof, thou
shall dye, both thou, and all thy posterity. We should have trodden the
Winepresse of GOD's wrath, and been tormented with the Devil and his angels,
in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone for ever: but CHRIST has
tasted death for us all.

O the wonderful and unspeakable love of Christ! as if a company of Traitors
were going to the Scaffold to be executed; the Kings Son should step forth to
dye for them: what an admirable thing were that! We by nature are enemies to
God, traitors to his Majesty: the Son of the King of Kings comes from heaven
and dies for us. Is not this to be admired of us all? scarce will any dye for a
righteous man; we were unholy, unrighteous, defiled with the scab of sin, in
soul and body; yet the Lord Jesus died for us. Life is sweet: who will dye for
his friend? but will any dye for his enemy? The consideration of the death of
Christ, should occupy our minds continually: we should ever be thinking of
it: it should cause us to be always singing of that song, Worthy is the Lamb
that was killed for us, to receive all honor, etc.

But why did Christ taste death for us? what moved God to send his Son to dye
for us? Surely his own grace, mercy, and favor: eternal life is (...). So
God loved the world, that he gave, etc.

There was no goodness in us, that might procure Christ to die for us: no
praevisa opera, nor praevisa fides: it is the grace of God, that we are
preserved from eternal death: by grace ye are saved, not by works. Let us not
part stakes with the Lord, give half to our selves, and half to him: but let
us ascribe the whole praise of our salvation to the grace of God alone: not to
us, O Lord, not to us, but to thy own name, and mercy, in thy Son Christ
Jesus, be given all praise for ever and ever.

VERSE 10.
NOw he descends to Christ's humanity, by preventing an objection of the
adversaries.

Well, you have affirmed Christ to be God, above the Angels, and all other
creatures, and that his suffering of death was no derogation from the glory of
his Deity, but a declaration of Gods grace and mercy to mankind by his death,
to preserve men from death eternal: but seeing he was GOD, what need was
there that he should become man, suffer afflictions, and dye? He might have
saved men by the power of his Deity, yea, even by his bare and naked word,
whereby he made all things at the first.

Answer: indeed, GOD being omnipotent might have saved mankind (if it had
seemed good to him) by some other means than by the incarnation and death of
his Son: yet this seemed to be the most fit and convenient means; that as man
by sin had deserved death, so by the death of a man he should be redeemed from
sin and death. The necessity of Christ's incarnation, he proves, first from the
end of it: He that by suffering for men, was to bring men to salvation, must be
man: Christ by suffering for men, was to bring men to salvation: ergo, Christ
was to bring many to glory. This he could not do but by afflictions, and namely
by death it self: for the Cross must go before the Crown: therefore it was
requisite that in our humane nature he should first suffer.

It became: this was most comely, fit and convenient for him: namely, that God,
ver. 9. which so graciously gave his Son for us, that is, God the Father, by
whose grace and mercy Christ died for us.

It became him for the better illustration of his owneglory; for a more lively
demonstration of his mercy and justice to the world; of his mercy in not
sparing his own Son, but giving him up to the death for us: of his justice, in
punishing the sins of the world so severely in his own Son.

(...), etc. These words are to be referred to Christ, not to God the Father.
1. They are affirmed of him in Scripture, 1 Cor. 8.6. Col. 1.16. 2. Before he
spoke of his humiliation, it was meet to premise something concerning his
glory, power, and dignity. 3. For so much as it is said, he was to be perfected
through afflictions, by afflictions to mount up to glory; that concerning his
Deity was well premised, that we might know it was no new glory, which he took,
but that which he had from all eternity, as he was GOD, Ioh. 17.5.

It became God the Father to perfect the Prince of our salvation through
afflictions; for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, after he had
brought many children to glory.

(...), having made them willing by his holy spirit. We are said also to be
drawn: Sed trahit sua quemque, voluptas. (...), by the Syntaxis might better
be referred to CHRIST, than to the Father: otherwise the participle should have
been in the dative case, to agree with the pronoune (...), then in the
accusative case. It ought to be translated thus; for it became him for whom
are all things, and by whom are all things, to consecrate the Prince of their*
salvation through afflictions, bringing many Children to glory.

Children: not friends, but Children: begotten by the word, made the Sons of
God by faith, John 1.12. known by the spirit, Romans 8.14.

Not a few, but many: for he is a powerful SAVIOR: many shall come from the
East, etc. Not all men: Matthew. 22.
because all embrace him not, being offered to them. Sundry were called to the
feast that came not.

To glory, in the kingdom of heaven.

(...). Some translate it, Sanctify, because of the next Verse: but the words
are diverse.

To perfect. CHRIST is said to be perfected, because after his suffering he
was glorified in his Humanity, as well as in his Deity.

CHRIST his afflictions are so far from being a shame or ignominy to him,
that they be solemn rites or sacred ceremonies, whereby he was consecrated
Bishop of the universal Church.

Through afflictions; in the whole course of his life: especially at his death
and passion.

The Archduke, the Captain, the leader, in whose steps we are to tread, the
Author of their salvation, Acts 3.15.

If CHRIST had not become man, afflicted and put to death; he could not have
carried men into the kingdom of heaven: for a purgation must be made for the
sin of man by the fiery furnace of affliction, and especially by death:
therefore it became Christ to be made man too, though he were God.

GOD is the efficient and final cause of all. 1. There is nothing but it is by
GOD; the Host of heaven, the Sun, Moon and Stars are by him: the birds of
the air, the fishies of the Sea, the beasts of the field, the green and
flourishing coat that the earth has, is by him.

All men, yea Angels, even the Devils themselves are by him: not as Devils.i.
malicious accusers of the Saints: but as they be invisible and immortal
spirits, all are by him: nay, to proceed a little further, and yet to keep
our selves within compass of sound Divinity, sin it self is not without the
providence of God, it is not a Deo creante, sed disponente: he disposes of all
the gross sins that be in the world, to his own glory: as a wise Physician
makes a good use, even of poison in his confections.

Furthermore, as all things are by GOD, so all for him: all serve his holy will
and blessed pleasure; some unwillingly, some willingly. GOD makes Satan and his
instruments to be for him, whether they will or no: but the faithful are
willingly for him, and serve him with all cheerfulness. Let us remember, that
we our selves and all that we have, is for God: he made us, he redeemed us
with the blood of his Son; therefore we are his, not our own: our wit,
wealth, honor, worship, learning, our souls, our bodies, our eyes, tongues,
hands, feet, all are for him: with all that we have we must glorify him.
Psalm. 12.
Our tongues are our own, said the wicked: that is false: all that we have is
Gods; therefore all must be at his commandment.

The pot is for him that made it, and the servant must be employed about his
Masters business: he must be his masters man, not his own: therefore as we
were created by God, so let us be wholly for him.

Now it became this high and mighty God, for whom are all things, and by whom
are all things, which works all as seems best to him, to consecrate the
Prince of their salvation, through afflictions, bringing many children to
glory. CHRIST brought them to glory, which he could not do, but by enduring
many afflictions.

1 Here we see that CHRIST could not bring us to heaven, without innumerable
afflictions, which our sins had deserved: he himself knew no sin; but he was
afflicted for our sins. And indeed, he was wonderfully afflicted for them, from
his cradle to his grave: A man of sorrows, as the Prophet terms him: he was
borne, not of a wealthy Lady, but of a poor woman, base and contemptible to
the eyes of the world: at his first coming, he was not laid in a costly
Cradle, but in a Cratch: not in a Chamber well furnished, but in a Stable:
borne in Winter, and in the night; when he was an Infant, banished into Egypt:
he wrought (as is thought) in the trade of his Father, and was a Carpenter: he
had not a hole to hide his head in: women were feign to minister to him of
their own substance, as he went up and down preaching the Gospel: he had not
bags of silver and gold about him, but was feign to send to the Sea for a piece
of 20d. hungry and thirsty he was many times: He was called all to naught, a
bibber of wine, a Samaritane, and one that had a devil: a little before his
Passion, they blindfolded him, spit on his face, buffeted him, whipped him
extremely, platted a crown of Thorns on his Head, that made the blood run
about his Ears: they stripped off all his clothes, nailed him hand and foot to
the Cross, where he continued in bitter pains of soul and body a long while
together. Thus was this innocent Lamb killed, and pitifully handled for our
sakes. Our sins were the causes of all: He bore our infirmities, and he was
wounded for our transgressions. These were the knives that cut the throat of
this Lamb; and yet shall we take delight in sin? CHRIST went through all these
afflictions, for our drunkenness, uncleanness, covetousnes, pride, etc. yet
shall we lie wallowing in these sins? the consideration of the manifold
afflictions that Christ suffered for sin, should cause sin to be odious and
loathsome to us all.

2 If the Prince could nor get to Heaven without afflictions, should the
subjects imagine to go thither without crosses? the Master was afflicted, and
shall the servants think to live without affliction? it cannot be avoided: we
must all drink of Christ's cup, and be baptized with his baptism: Many in
their hearts complain of God that he is too hard to them; they are never
without some cross or other; one while in their souls, another while in their
bodies, sometimes in goods, in good-name, one while they have the toothache,
another while the headache; one while vexed with children, another while with
servants; one while losses in goods, another while by lying and malevolent
tongues, they are robbed of their good names: sometimes God stirs up
adversaries against them, in Town, or Country, as he did against Solomon.

Marvel not at that, neither repine nor grudge at it. God grievously afflicted
his natural Son, and shall we think much if he afflict his adopted sons? GOD
imposed many afflictions upon him that knew no sin, and shall we sinners
stomach it if we be afflicted? CHRIST has gone before as a Captain in the
foul way of afflictions; we must follow him. All that will live godly in
Christ Jesus, Luke 24.26.
2 Timothy 3.12.
shall suffer persecution through many tribulations we must enter into the
kingdom of God, Acts 14.22. no remedy. They that Will go to London in the
dead of Winter, must go through many showers: and if we will pass to that
high City, the heavenly Jerusalem, it must be through afflictions: they that
are without correction, are bastards, not children.

It is an argument of a wicked man, of whom God makes no reckoning, to be
without affliction: Psalm. 73.5.
they are not in trouble as other men. If we Will be glorified with Christ, let
us suffer with Christ: as he went to heaven through afflictions, so must we:
else we shall never get thither: we must not think to go to heaven out of all
prosperity, but out of adversity. Apoc. 7.14.
These be they that came out of many tribulations. Therefore let not
afflictions be altogether unwelcome to us: nay, let us boast of them after an
heavenly manner. Gal. 6.17.
I carry about with me the marks of CHRIST, says Saint Paul: afflictions are
CHRIST his marks, by them we are known to belong to him: afflictions
consecrate us.

There is no Bishop elected, but will joyfully go to his consecration:
afflictions consecrate us as Kings and Priests to GOD Almighty: therefore
though irksome to the flesh, yet in some sort let us willingly embrace them,
as some Martyrs did the flame of fire. CHRIST went to Heaven by afflictions:
and let us be content to be afflicted here for a short season, that we may
live with CHRIST for ever: let us suffer with Christ, that we may be glorified
with Him.

VERSE 11.
ANother reason, why it became Christ to be man: it is taken from the impurity
of our nature. Men had sinned, and were destitute of the grace of God: they
were by nature impure and unholy, conceived, borne, brought up in sin: now it
was necessary they should be sanctified, made clean, and holy. This could not
be done by the blood of Goats and other sacrifices in the Law: neither could
they sanctify themselves by their own good works and merits: therefore it
was requisite that God should take this sanctification on him. Now man's nature
being corrupt, was to be sanctified by a man, that knew no sin or corruption:
for he that sanctifies, and they that are sanctified, are of one: therefore
Christ became man.

The High Priest that sanctified the people in the time of the Law, and the
people sanctified by him were both of one Father, namely Abraham, the Father of
the Israelites; so Christ that sanctifies us, and we that be sanctified by
him, are of one, (...), in the neuter gender, of one thing, of one nature.

Of one,] that is, of one Parent of whom came all mankind, Acts 17.26. Christ
and we, came of one Adam: whereupon S. Luke deduceth his Genealogy from Adam,
Luke 3.38. We are all of one; high and low, rich and poor, and Christ is man
like to us, sin only excepted?

All the persons in the Trinity sanctify us. God the Father by the Son, God
the Son by the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost immediately by himself: but Christ,
as the Mediator of the Church, sanctifies it. As the ointment came from Aarons
head down to the skirts of his garment: so the spiritual oil of holiness,
comes from Christ the Head, to us, that be his members. Christ is our only
sanctifier, 1 Cor. 1.30. No Saint, as the Virgin Mary; no Angel can sanctify
us. How he sanctifies us, is apparent, Ephesians. 5.26, 27. 1 Cor. 6.11. by purging
us from our sins, clothing us with his righteousness, renewing us by his
Spirit, making us New Creatures, and fit for the holy Jerusalem.

This does give us to understand, that by nature we are unholy and
un-sanctified, conceived, borne, and brought forth in sin, the children of
Gods wrath. In us, that is, in our flesh dwells no good thing. Being considered
in our selves, we are Idolaters, Whoremongers, Wantons, Raylers, Drunkards,
ready to be carried into all impiety. Such were some of you, says S. Paul: but
ye are washed. As the Leper in the time of the law cried out, I am unclean, I
am unclean: So must every mothers Son of us say, we are as unclean swine by
nature, except the Lord Jesus sanctify us. When Christ washing his Disciples
feet came to Saint Peter, he repelled him, saying, thou shall not wash my
feet. No, says Christ? then thou have no portion in me. Saint Peter hearing
that answered: Lord, not my feet alone, but my head and hands. We are corrupt
in soul and body: therefore let us entreat Christ to wash and sanctify us in
them both. No unclean thing shall enter into the heavenly Jerusalem: Dogs,
Enchanters, Whoremongers are without. Therefore let us beseech CHRIST to make
us clean by his Word and Spirit in this life, that we may have entrance into
the holy Jerusalem in the life to come.

If CHRIST and we are all of one, much more are we among our selves.

A King and a beggar are of one: a rich man and a poor man are of one: a fair
and beautiful man or woman, and they that want beauty are of one: we descended
all of Adam, and were taken out of the dust of the ground: therefore let us not
insult one over another. GOD for a season has advanced one above another, the
Magistrate above the Subject, the Father above the Son, the Rich man above the
poor man, and every one is to be honored according to that place, whereunto
God has exalted him: yet if we look back to our original, to the stock from
whence we are taken, we are all of one. The Wax that has the print of the
Kings seal on it, is the same in substance with the wax that has the print
of the seal of a mean man: yet it is honored, in that the Kings seal is set
on it: So we are all of one weak and waxie nature: save that it pleases God
to set a more honorable print upon one, then on another. Therefore let us not
think highly of ourselves, and contemn our brethren, but submit to them of
low degree, using the greatness that GOD has given us, to the glory of the
Giver. See thou a poor Lazarus full of sores, desirous to be refreshed with
the crumbes that fall from rich men's bordes? Contemn him not in thy heart: he
and thou, though thou farest deliciously every day, and rufflest out in silks
and velvet, are both of one.

This he proves by the relatives. They that be brethren, come of one Father
and Mother: CHRIST and we are brethren: therefore we are of one: of one Adam,
which is our Father, and of one Mother, which is Eve.

Whereas some interpret it of one God, of one heavenly Father; it is
impertinent to the Text.

He does not simply say, they are his brethren: but, he is not ashamed to call
them brethren, Prove. 19.7. All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much
more do his friends go far from him? He pursues them with words, but they
are wanting to him. But Christ thought it no disparagement to his glorious
Deity, to call men his brethren. Though there be wonderful ods between Christ
and us; he the Creator, we the creatures; he the LORD and Master, we his
servants; he without sin, we defiled with sin in Soul and body; he
mervailous rich, heaven and earth being his; we poor men, of our selves not
worth a groat: yet Christ is not ashamed to call us brethren. If a man come
once to be Lord Major of London, he will scant acknowledge his poor brethren
and Sisters, when they come to him. Christ is not a Lord for a year and a day,
but an everlasting King, yea the King of Kings, yet he vouchsafes to call us,
brethren. One Judge will call another, brother; and if he be a Sergeant, he
shall have that name; but every pettifogger and paltrie Lawyer shall not be the
Judges brother: yet Christ the Judge of the whole world calls us all brethren.
O the humility of Christ, and the dignity whereunto he has advanced us!

VERSE 12.
THis he proved out of the Psalm 22.22.

Many things in that Psalm are in the New Testament applied to CHRIST, as
Verse 1. Verse 16. Verse 18.

The Prophet speaks this of himself: that when GOD had delivered him from
his enemies, he would declare his name to the people which were his brethren,
though GOD had exalted him above them. But prophetically also he speaks of
the Messiah: after that CHRIST was delivered from Satan's fury and the rage of
his instruments, from the power of death and of the grave, he would declare
the name of GOD to his brethren. This he did, while he was alive, Ioh. 17.6.
but especially after his resurrection, when he sent his Apostles to preach the
Gospel to all nations. CHRIST was not only the Author and matter of the
Gospel: but he was also the proclaimer and Preacher of it: he declared it in
his own life time by himself; after his Ascension, by his Apostles.

The name, that is the power, mercy, and goodness of God.

By brethren here are understood, not the Apostles or faithful only, though
they in more special manner be the brethren of CHRIST, Matthew. 12.49. Ioh.
20.17. but all men generally: for CHRIST and all men came of one, which is
Adam, and were made by one God, Mal. 2.10. CHRIST will not declare his name in
a corner, but in the midst of the Church. In the midst of the Church among
the rest of my brethren as fellow singers. Christ did sing with his Disciples
after the supper, he prayed, worshipped, and sung as we do.

CHRIST has many Brethren.

1. All men in respect of our humane nature, which Christ assumed to himself,
are his brethren: he a man, as all are. 2. In regard of Country and lineall
descent the Jews are his brethren, of whom Christ came according to the flesh,
Romans 9.5. Deuteronomy. 18.18. 3. In respect of consanguinity; the kinsfolk of CHRIST
in the Scripture are called his brethren, James the brother of the Lord, that
is, the kinsman of the Lord. 4. In respect of the Ministry; the Preachers of
the Word are CHRIST his brethren: for he was a Minister and Preacher of the
Gospel as we are; although in gifts and graces he excelled us all, as the
Sun does the Stars. But more nearly and properly, the faithful are his
brethren, being made the Sons of GOD by faith in CHRIST JESUS. I go to my
God and your God, to my Father and your Father, Ioh. 20.17.
1. As CHRIST is not ashamed to call us brethren; so let us do nothing so
near as we can, that may shame this our Brother.

Is it not a shame that the Kings brother should be a common drunkard,
whoremaster, or such like? Does not the King take himself disgraced by it? And
shall we that are Brethren to the King of Kings, take such courses, as that
great ignominy should redound to CHRIST by it? As he is not ashamed to call
us brethren, so let us do nothing that may pull a shame on him and his Gospel.

2. Can a brother that is a wealthy man, of fair revenewes, and ample
possessions, see any of his brethren go a begging? will he not rather receive
him to his own house, and set him at his table? CHRIST which is the Lord of
heaven and earth, is our brother: therefore let us fear no want, so long as
we fear him. This may be a comfort to us in all our calamities; that CHRIST
and we are brethren.

VERSE 13.
AN other argument to prove the humanity of Christ: it is drawn from the
effects. Christ puts his trust in God: therefore he is man.

He that trusts to another, is inferior to him, to whom he trusts: the
party whom he makes his pillar to lean upon, is superior to him, greater than
he: CHRIST trusted in GOD the Father: therefore in respect of his humanity, he
is inferior to the Father.

These words, whether deduced out of Isai. 12.2. or out of Psalm 18.2. are
fitly applied to CHRIST. Chasah, I will fly to him, as to a strong tower and
Castle. That song in Isaiah, is sung by the whole Church, and so consequently
by CHRIST the head of the Church. The 70. have it, (...).

In the Psalm, though David speaks it of himself, that for all the fury of
his adversaries, he would trust in God, of whose goodness he had comfortable
experience by his deliverance from the house of Saul, as in the title: yet
being a type of Christ, figuratively he speaks also of him. Sundry things in
that Psalm cannot be applied to David, as Verse 43. and that, Verse 7. Whereas
at the passion of Christ the earth quaked.

Our Savior Christ in his bitter agony in the garden, trusted in God: and when
he hung on the cross, he knew that though God seemed to forsake him for a
time, yet he would deliver him out of all, and assume him into his kingdom:
thus he still put his trust in GOD.

If he did trust in God in all calamities, from whom the Deity was never
separated; much more ought we miserable men in all adversities, trust in God.
Some trust in Charets, and some in Horses: but let us remember the name of the
Lord our God, and trust in him. Cursed be he that makes flesh his arm. Let us
not put our trust in riches, though our barnes be never so full of corn, our
coffers of gold and silver. Let us not trust in our strength, in the multitude
of our men, in our walled towns and defenced castles. Let us not put our trust
in the fortitude of this good yland, that is compassed about with the Seas. Let
us not put our trust in our friends. When we be sick, let us not put our trust
in the Physicians, as Asa did: not trust in our policy, as Achitophel: but
let us always in all difficulties put our trust in GOD, he is able and
willing to pluck us out of all dangers.

He delivered the Israelites from the red Sea: Daniel from the the Lions:
Peter from the fury of Herod. He can and will preserve us from all the devils
of hell: the gates of hell shall never prevail against us.

Happy are they that put their trust in him: he is a sure friend that will
never fail them.

The fourth argument to prove the humanity of Christ, is taken from the
relatives. The Father and the children are of one nature: Christ is the Father,
we his children. ergo.

This is at large amplified by the Apostle.

1. He that makes himself equal with the rest of the faithful, and of the
servants and children of God, is a man as they be: but Christ makes himself
equal with the rest of the faithful, of the servants and children of God.
Ergo.

2. He that receives children as a gift from God, is inferior to GOD, that
gave him these children: but CHRIST receives children as a gift from GOD:
ergo, he is inferior to GOD: which cannot be but in respect of his humanity.
Ergo, he is man as well as GOD.

He produces an other testimony, Isa. 8.18. That this testimony is to be
applied to the Messiah, is evident by many places in that chapter where he is
called Immanuel. 2. That v. 14. is expounded of Christ in sundry places of the
New Testament, as Luke 2. Romans 9. 1 Pet. 2. 3. Though this was true in the
Prophet himself, and in his Disciples, yet it is verified likewise of Christ,
of whom the Prophet was a Type.

Behold,] this argues his prompt and ready obedience, presenting himself to
the Lord: so Christ was obedient to God the Father, even to the death, yea, of
the Cross.

By children are meant servants, followers, attendants upon any, 1 Samuel 21.4.
Acts 4.25. Ioh. 21.5. by them are signified the faithful, which as children
and servants waited on Christ, and attended to his voice, as children do to
the voice of their Father.

All the faithful in the world, by whose ministry soever turned, are Christ's
children: he the chief Father; we secondarily: they are his children
principally; ours instrumentally. It is CHRIST that begets us, though not now
in his own person, yet by the Ministers and Preachers, who are our Fathers
under Christ, and we their Children. GOD the Father gave him those children. 1.
By the administration of baptism: 2. Then by the working of his Spirit, and
the powerful preaching of his word: Ioh. 17.9.6. Ioh. 6.37. John 10.29.

Properly to speak, they are given to no Prophet nor Minister, but to Christ
alone.

That they be as signs and wonders, agrees well to Christ, and all the
faithful. Christ was despised, and so are we, Ioh. 15.18. 1 Cor. 4.9. to 14.
S. Paul might have had more pregnant testimonies for the confirmation of
Christ's humanity, than these be; yet he made choice of these, partly because
peradventure they were applied by the Rabbis and the Jews themselves to the
Messiah: partly because these set forth to us, the mercy of God toward us, and
our honor and dignity, that we should be Christ's brethren, that he and we
should be in a manner equal, coupled together in one yoke.

This is true in the Prophets and in CHRIST too: the preachers of the Word have
children given them of the Lord. The Prophets in their time had their children:
the Apostles theirs: and we ours. Saint Paul begat Onesimus in his bonds. GOD
gave Lydia as a child to Saint Paul, in opening her heart, and causing her to
believe. Yea, many Nations were given to S. Paul. GOD gave those three thousand
souls as a great company of children to St. Peter. And the Lord by the
ministry of the Word gives us children at this present day. You are our
children; and therefore you ought to love and honor us. What child will rail
on his Father? they be Bastards that endeavor to pluck out their Parents eyes:
yet some do on the Ministers, their spiritual fathers.

This also may be affirmed of Christ; he is our brother, and our father too, he
is the right and proper father of the faithful, whom he begets by the word
of truth: and they that are truly begotten by the word, are Christ's children,
whom the Father gave to him from all eternity, before all times, and whom in
time he gives to him daily, by the preaching of the Gospel to the worlds end.

1 We have not these children of our selves, simply by our preaching, be it
never so powerful: It is GOD that gives them to us. Children are the
inheritance of the Lord, so these spiritual children. Let us praise God for
them. A Father rejoices in his children; so may and do Preachers in their
Children.

2 There is no Father but will protect his Children, as much as lies in him:
he will be content to take a blow in defense of his Child: and do ye think
that Christ Jesus our spiritual Father will not defend us? A Hen hides her
Chickens under her wings against the Kite: and Christ will shroud us under the
wings of his power and providence against Satan and all enemies.

3 What Father will see his child want, being a man of ability? CHRIST that is
the LORD of all the world, The Earth is his, and the fullness thereof, will not
suffer us that be his children to want the thing that is good. Because Wine is
hurtful for young children, it inflames their blood, which is hot of it self,
a wise Father will not give his child Wine, yet he loves him well enough: so
because GOD our heavenly Father oftentimes sees wealth, honor, ease, to be
hurtful for his children, to drown them in the pit of perdition, he keeps
them away from them: but let us assure our selves of this, he will deny us that
be his children, nothing that is good for the salvation of our souls.

As we are the children of CHRIST, so let us walk worthy of such a Father. You
are of your Father the Devil, says Christ to the Pharisees, for the works of
your Father ye will do. A fearful thing to call CHRIST Father, and to do as
the Devil bids us. A child must do the commandment of his Father: and if we
be CHRIST's children, we must do as he will have us. CHRIST would not have us
swear: therefore let us not rend Gods name in pieces by swearing: Christ would
have us to be sober and temperate in the use of his creatures; therefore let
gluttony and drunkenness be avoided by us: let us show our selves to be the
dutiful children of Christ in this life, that we may have the inheritance
prepared for children in the life to come.

VERSE 14.
1 A Description of CHRIST'S incarnation. 2. An application of it, Verse 17.

In the description. 1. The equity of it. 2. The ends of it. 3. An exaggeration
of it by a comparison, Verse 16.

The ends are two. 1. The overthrow of the Devil. 2. Our deliverance out of
the hands of the Devil, Verse 15.

In the comparison. 1. The nature refused. 2. The nature assumed, verse 16.

In the application. 1. A repetition of the incarnation. 2. An illustration of
it by the ends thereof. 1. That he might be a faithful high Priest, in making
our reconciliation. 2. A merciful high Priest, in succouring us in our
temptations.

He infers upon the two testimonies going before in the 12. and 13. Verses.
a plain conclusion of Christ's humanity, and makes it open to all the world.

He concludes it, a pari. They that were to be redeemed by him were men:
therefore he also would be a man. This is amplified by the end, and by a
comparison.

Our humane nature is here described by the matter, and the substance, whereof
it consists.

By flesh and blood sometimes is signified the corrupt nature of man, 1 Cor.
15.50. Flesh and blood defiled with sin, subject to mortality and corruption
cannot inherit heaven.

Sometimes it is taken for the substance of man's nature as here: and Matthew.
16.17. Gal. 1.16. The children did all communicate of flesh and blood: it was
the common condition of all.

(...), even as they did: as milk is like milk. That he might be their
neighbor and kinsman, our Immanuel; he participated of flesh and blood too.

He took part of it.i. The substance, but not the vicious qualities: he knew
no sin. A spirit has not flesh and bone, as ye see me have: He was the
fruit of his mothers womb, made of a woman: he names that part of our nature,
which is visible, the other also being included, namely the soul, which
quickened this flesh and blood. But here is the difference.

1. We take flesh of both our Parents: he but of one. Filius hominis is here
of the feminine gender. 2. Our flesh is polluted with sin: so is not his. 3.
We are mere men: he both God and man. 4. Our mothers ceased to be Virgins,
when they brought forth us: his was a maid and a mother too.
Here we have a lively description of man: he is but flesh and blood, which is
weak, frail and subject to many miseries. A knife may easily cut it, the
heat scorch it, the cold benumme it: it is subject to thirst, hunger,
faintness, weariness, etc. All flesh is as grass. With them is an arm of
flesh, with us is God. We are not steel, iron, Isai. 40.6.
brass: but flesh and blood. A wise Solomon, a strong Samson, a beautiful
Absalom, Bathshebah, a learned Paul that spoke tongues more than all, a Lord, a
Lady, are but flesh and blood, dust, and must return to dust: the
consideration whereof should humble us all.

The fowls of the air, the beasts of the field, are flesh and blood too: yea
theirs excells ours. 1. Their flesh and blood is clothed at their first
entrance: ours naked. 2. Their's well fenced: ours soon pierced. 3. More
profit may be made of their flesh when they dye, they will sell for something:
so not ours. 4. As sound as a fish, they are free from diseases. Sicknesses
grow in ours, and GOD makes our's meat for Worms. Let this appellation then
pull down our Peacocks feathers, and make us walk humbly before our God.

But as CHRIST did participate of our flesh and blood; So shall we of his: he
shall change our vile bodies, that they may be fashioned according to his
glorious body, Phil. 3.21.

Now he proceeds to the ends of Christ's incarnation. 1. The overthrow of the
Devil. 2. Our deliverance out of his claws. 1. He describes him. 2. He names
him.

The cause why CHRIST took our humane nature upon him was, that being
compassed with flesh and blood he might ^ye, and so conquer the Devil, and
deliver men out of his claws. If he had not been man, he could not have dyed,
and then we had not been delivered. The means for the vanquishing of the
Devil, sin and death, was his own death. As the brazen Serpent was lifted
up, and by looking on it the Israelites were delivered from the fiery
Serpents: So Christ was lifted on the cross; and we are saved by looking on
him with the eye of faith. The death of this immaculate Lamb was the overthrow
of the Devil and of death too: which Hosea in the spirit of prophecy
foretold, and was afterward accordingly verefied, Hos. 13.14. 1 Cor. 15.54. As
Sampson by his own death, vanquished the Philistims, Iud. 16.30. So CHRIST by
his death overcame death, and destroyed him that had the power of death, that
is, the devil: and that with his own sword.

He does not say, that he might weaken the Devil, diminish his force, or give
him a wound, but destroy him. So that he has nothing against us, Ioh. 12.31.

Not death alone, but the Devil too, the LORD of death. The Devil by carrying
men into sin, had power also to carry them into death: the wages of sin is
death, Romans 6.23. First he entises men to sin, and then he has power and
authority from God, to give them the wages they have deserved, that is death:
thus he has the power of death as a thief and murderer.

Not to hold us in suspense, he names him the Devil, who compasses the earth
to and fro, ranging up and down like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may
devour, 1 Pet. 5.8.

There be three that have the power of death: God, Man and the Devil.

1. GOD, He strikes men dead, and that suddenly: he rayses up from the dead, as
Hannah speaks in her song: The Lord kills and makes alive, he brings
down to the grave, and raises up, 1 Samuel 2.6. he has supremam potestatem:
Gods power is immediate, absolute, and unlimited.

2. Man, a King or a Judge has the power of death. As Pilate said to our
Savior, John 19.10. Know thou not, that I have power to crucify thee, and
have power to release thee? True: man has a delegatam potestatem.

3. The Devil has power, that is rule and empire; sed consequutam potestatem:
tanquam carnifex, he may not kill us at his own will and pleasure; no more
than the hangman may execute a malefactor at his will, but according to the
appointment of the Judge.

VERSE. 15.
NOw he comes to the second end of Christ's incarnation and death, that he
might deliver us from the devils hands: non liberaretur humanum genus, nisi
sermo Dei factus esset humanus, August.

Deliver them: set them free, quaking at the cogitation of death, in regard of
eternal damnation which it brought with it for their innumerable sins,
whereof their own consciences accused them.

Deliverance is a comfortable thing, most welcome unto all: Galley-slaves and
Prisoners are glad to hear of their deliverance.

Not some, but all: so many as embrace his deliverance.

Not only those which were bound, but subject to bondage: that had willingly
subjected themselves to the Devil: which had bound themselves apprentises to
him, Romans 6.16. The Indentures were made between them and the devil: we will
serve thee, thou shall be our Master: this was our estate.

Why were we subject to him? what kept us in subjection? the fear of death all
our life time: they were subject to bondage, that is, to the stroke of death,
which they expected every moment. The devil threatened death to us all our life
time, every hour: being sinners, we might look for death every moment: not
only for a temporal death, but for an eternal in hellfire. Death is (...):
we quaked at the mention of death: this kept us in bondage to the devil.

A miserable condition! but Christ has delivered us out of it: he has taken
away the fear of death, that made us to shake, the fetter, wherewith the
Devil kept us bound. Now death is but a sleep, a passage to a better life:
yea, it is (...), as Basil speaks. Thus he has rescued us out of the devils
claws, and made us free, John 8.36. The devil, sin, and death, are left still
ad agonem, to exercise us withal, as Antagonists to wrestle withal: but the
victory through Christ is ours. We sin, we dye; and the devil like a roaring
Lion, walks up and down, seeking how to devour us: but none of these shall
be able to prevail over us. Sin, though it remains, yet it does not reign
in us. 2. The guilt and the punishment of it is taken away, so that it shall
not condemn us, Romans 8.1. The sting of death is gone. O death where is thy
sting? Cogitur, non abesse, sed non obesse: hence the servants of God have
wished for it, Phil. 1.23. I desire to be dissolved, etc. Neither can it
separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus. The malice of Satan, that
shall turn to our good. GOD may suffer him to tempt and assault us; he walks
up and down like a roaring Lion. 1. That we should not be secure. 2. To stir
us up to pray: but, 1. we are no longer in his jurisdiction. 2. we shall be
conquerors over him, God will tread him under our feet, Romans 16.20. and will
give us an issue with the temptation, 1 Cor. 10.13. Satan may plot against us,
1 These. 2.18. Luke 22.31. but God will confound him: he may make us sin, but he
cannot make us continue in sin. Sin, the Devil, and Death, are three of the
mightiest enemies that we have: all these are destroyed by Christ for us:
therefore let us be thankful to Christ, that has wrought for us so great and
gracious a deliverance.

Let us not stand in an immoderate fear of death. Death is a Serpent without a
sting. Though he gripe us, yet he cannot hurt us. Damocles the Parasite
extolled the magnificence of Dyonisius, affirming that there was not an happier
man in the world than he; will thou have a taste of my happiness? I: he caused
him to be set in a chair of state, the Table furnished with all delicates,
singing-men and women making melody with voices and Instruments, noble
attendants to wait on him: but therewithal he commanded a sharp naked sword to
be hung over his head, by a slender Horse-haire; the which he espying, took no
pleasure in that Paradise, but besought him earnestly to take him out of his
happiness again. So though we have the world at will, though we be Gentlemen,
etc. yet the sword of death hanging over our heads continually, must needs
quail the courage of the greatest Gallant.

O quam pulchrum esset dominantibus hic dominari,
Si mors non posset dominantibus insidiari!
It is appointed for all men once to dye: when, and how suddenly we know not:
our breath may be stopped on the sudden, as Valentinians, Luc. 12.20. We are
all obnoxious to the fear of death: but Christ has delivered us from a
slavish fear of it.

VERSE 16.
HEre you have the amplification of it, by the comparison of a more excellent
nature refused by him: the Angels far surpass us, yet he took not on him
their nature, but ours.

Not the seed of Adam, of Noah, but of Abraham, because the promise was made to
him, In thy seed shall all Nations of the earth be blessed.

If he should have taken on him the nature of Angels; it was either for the
good Angels, or the bad. The good needed it not, because they never fell: as
for the evil Angels, there was no such reason, because they sinned in a more
high degree than men. 1. They sinned of themselves without the instigation of
any: man fell by the subtle provocation of the Serpent. 2. They sinned in
heaven, in the Court of the King of Kings: we sinned on earth, which is his
footstool. 3. They were endued with more excellent gifts, of wisdom,
knowledge, and understanding: we are but babes and children to them. 4. They
were only of a spiritual essence, they had no flesh to intise them to sin, as
we have: but the greatest of all is his own goodness, and mercy, Isai. 9.6.
John 3.16. Both had sinned, Angels, and men. Why was Christ made a man to dye
for men, and not an Angel, to redeem Angels, from everlasting death? because
it was his own good will and pleasure, his singular love to mankind. Let us
therefore magnify him for it, from generation to generation.

Some, as Augustine observes, took occasion from hence to be proud and
insolent. See, Christ took on him our nature, not the Angels: therefore we are
exalted above Angels: we have just cause to think highly of our selves. As if
a sick man should boast: the Physician came to my house, not to my neighbors;
therefore, I am a better man than my neighbor: the reason why Christ took on
him thy nature, not the Angels, was because thou were sick of sin: so were not
the good Angels.

Nevertheless, it is a preferment to us, that Christ should assume our nature
to his, our corruptible nature, to his incorruptible: as if a King should take
the patcht cloak of a beggar, and annex it to his royal cloak, decked with
Pearls, and precious Stones. Now as Christ has honored our nature in
becoming man: so let not us men dishonor our own nature by drunkenness,
uncleanness, covetousness, nor by wrangling and contending one with another.
Christ has graced our nature, let not us disgrace it.

VERSE 17.
WHereupon he returns to his conclusion, which he would have to be infixed in
our memories: I will declare thy name to my brethren: which he could not do,
unless he were a man, as his brethren are.

(...), debuit, he ought, because it was his fathers will, and his own will
too: necessitate, non coactione.

In all things appertaining to the substance, not to the corruption of our
nature: He was like unto us in all things, sin only excepted.

He was like to us, in all the faculties and members of soul and body. He had
the same affections that we have, yet unstained with sin. We are sorrowful; so
was He: My soul is heavy to the death: We are joyful; so was He, Luke 10.21.
In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, (...). We are zealous; so was He, the
zeal of thy house has eaten me up. We are hungry; so was he, Mark 3.5. We
wonder at all things; so did He. We are afraid of death; so was He: My soul is
heavy to the death.

Come to the Body:

We are little ones, grow in stature; so Christ, Luke 2. ult. We are hungry,
thirsty, sleepy; so was He: He slept in a Ship, Mat. 8.24. not in a Church. We
are weary; so was he: He rested himself on Iacobs-Well, John 4:6. We dye; so
He died also. As He is like to us, so let us be like him; in meekness,
patience, charity, in praying for our enemies.

Brethren. All are his brethren, quoad naturam: the faithful, quoad gratiam.
John 20.17. He will not be ashamed to call us Brethren, at the day of
judgment, Mat. 25.40. and shall not we call one another brother? The King and
Subjects are brethren, the Ministers and their People, rich and poor are
brethren: and let us not be snapping and snarling one at another, but live
lovingly together as brethren.

Both members are unfolded in the words following, that is, he was a faithful
High Priest.

Appertaining to God. In divine, not in humane matters. The High Priest made an
atonement for the people, Levit. 16. So did Christ for his people. GOD and man
were fallen out, Christ made us friends. God was displeased with us, he
pacified his wrath toward us: which the Father by an audible voice witnessed
from heaven; Matthew. 3.17. This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
How? by the blood of his Cross, which was Gods blood, Acts 20.28. We were not
redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the precious
blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot. 1 Pet. 1.18,
19.

In many things we offend all: who then can be saved? our sins for number
exceed the sands of the Sea, and the least sin is sufficient to throw us into
hell without Christ. But by Christ we are reconciled to his Father, and have
peace with him, Col. 1.20. Luke 2.14. Romans 5.1. Oh I have sinned: but 1 John
2.2. Christ is the propitiation for our sins. Worthy then is the Lamb, the Lord
Jesus, to receive all glory. Men at Christ-masse use to take a greater liberty
to sin, to quaffe, swill, and carowse, to open the floud-gates of all impiety:
but the consideration of Christ's coming into the world, should be a bridle to
restrain us from sin. Christ came now to make a reconciliation for our sins,
and shall we plunge our selves deeper into the Sea of sin? God forbid. The love
of Christ should constrain us to forsake sin: it should not make us wallow in
the filthy puddle, and sink of sin. Will thou make much of the knife that cut
thy Fathers throat? David, though he longed for the water of the Well of
Bethlehem, yet when it was brought to him, by three of his Worthies, he refused
to drink of it, saying, Is not this the blood of the men, that went in
jeopardie of their lives? 2 Samuel 23.17. Sin cost the blood of Christ: let us
not then drink iniquity like water.

VERSE 18.
HE prosecuteth the former branch, touching mercy.

As CHRIST was like to us in nature, so he was tempted as we are. Saepius ipse
miser, miseris succurrere disce. Art thou tempted, whether thou art the child
of GOD or not? A shroud temptation, wherewith the best men and women are
shaken! So was CHRIST: If thou be the Son of God: the Devil calls it into
question, and would have had CHRIST to doubt of it. Art thou tempted with
poverty, with want of things necessary for this life? So Was Christ; from his
Cradle to his grave: he was borne in a stable, laid in a cratch, had not an
hole to hide his head in; he had no money in his purse, but was feign to send
to the Sea for some: he kept his Passover in an other man's chamber, was buried
in an other man's grave. Art thou tempted with malevolent tongues, with some
that are ever railing on thee? So was Christ: he was termed a Wine bibber, a
glutton, etc. Art thou tempted with sickness, the toothach, the headache, the
cholike, the gout, etc. We never read that Christ was sick, because he had no
sin in him, yet being clothed with our nature, he knows what belongs to
pain, and will succor us in all our distresses.

Art thou persecuted? Herod sought his life, as soon as he was borne. A rich
man that has a good fire continually in his house, a table furnished with all
delicates, that lies soft on a bed of dowlne, he cannot so well pity a poor
man, as one poor man may do another.

CHRIST being rich would become poor: he would be a man, that he might the
better pity us that be men: that he might be a merciful high Priest to us
all: and shall we be unmercifull one to another? As the elect of God, put on
bowels of mercy, Col. 3.12. We have a merciful high Priest; Let us be
merciful one to another. It is a token of a wicked man, of a reprobate, to be
unmercifull: as that rich glutton was, that saw Lazarus daily at his gates, and
would have no compassion on him. True Christians are merciful, as Christ is.

Judas came howling to the high Priests and Pharisees; Oh I have sinned in
betraying innocent blood: what is that to us, say they? See thou to that: So,
such a neighbor is sick in the Town, such a one is mourning for the death of
his Children, his Wife, etc. Such a poor man has neither meat nor firing,
nothing to relieve himself and his Children withal: what is that to us? A
lamentable thing! There is a thorn in the foot that pains it, and makes it to
swell: shall the head and hands say, what is that to us? We are members one of
another, and we have an head that is pitiful to us. Let us be pitiful one
to another, that Christ may have pity and compassion on us, both in this
world, and in that which is to come.

This may be a singular comfort to us all. They say, he is happy that has a
friend in the Court, especially if he be gracious with the King: we have a
friend in the Court of heaven that is deep in Gods books; such a friend, as
has a feeling of all our infirmities. He and we are as Hippocrates twins,
weeping and laughing together. Saul, why persecutest thou me? If we be sick,
or grieved -- he is, etc. This was one special end why CHRIST assumed our
nature, that he might the better have compassion on us in our calamities. As
the bowels of the true mother yerned, when her Child should have been cut in
pieces: so if we be in any affliction, the bowels of CHRIST yerne toward us:
therefore let us sound forth the praises of CHRIST with a cheerful heart,
that took our nature on him: let us glorify this our elder brother, LORD and
Savior in this life, that we may be glorified with himself in eternal glory,
in the life to come.

CHAP. 3.
HItherto he has entreated of the person of Christ, showing him to be God and
man: now he proceeds to his offices. As for his regal dignity, it might be
perceived by that which he had already spoken of him, that he was above the
Angels themselves: therefore he says little of his kingdom: in his other two
offices he is ample.

1. They are propounded jointly, Verse 1. Then opened Severally and
particularly.

1. He begins with his prophecy, which is contained in this Chapter and part
of the next, to Verse 14. Then with his Priesthood, in the Chapter following.

About his prophecy there be two things.

1. An admonition, with all reverence to listen to this our Prophet. 2. Reasons
to induce us to it.
Within this Chapter there are four. The 1. is taken from his fidelity,
illustrated by a comparison between him and Moses, a 2. ad 7. 2. From the
testimony of the Holy Ghost, who stirs us up to listen to him: where we have
the allegation of the testimony, a 7. to 11. an application of it, Verse 12,
13. The 3d. reason is taken from the fruit and commodity we shall have by it: a
society and fellowship with Christ, verse 14. 4. From the punishment inflicted
on them, that contemn this Prophet, to the end.

In the admonition there be two branches. 1. A description of the persons that
are to attend. 2. Of the person to whom they must attend.

Vnde, whereupon. Seeing the Prophet and Doctor of the Church, is the high and
eternal God above the Angels and all creatures: seeing in time he became man,
that by Gods grace he might taste death for all men; therefore let us make an
high account and estimation of him. The parties admonished to listen to this
Prophet and Teacher of the Church are described by their estate and condition,
and by the gracious benefits bestowed on them.

1 For their condition, they be brethren: dulciter eos alloquitur: not carnal,
but spiritual brethren. He does not call them brethren only, because they
descended of the Fathers, and came of the seed of Abraham, as he did: but
because they were brethren in the Lord Jesus Christ. By this sweet and loving
title he does insinuate himself into the Hebrews, and allures them to have a
reverent opinion of Christ.

Yea, he calls them, holy brethren, such as are made holy by Jesus Christ, the
Holy one of God, 1 Cor. 6.11. By nature we are unholy, as well as others; but
Christ sanctifies us and makes us holy. We that be Christians must not be
unholy brethren, brethren in evil, as Simeon and Levi were, but we must be
holy brethren. As GOD our Father is holy, the Church our Mother is holy, Christ
our elder brother is holy, the Angels our fellow-brethren are holy, Heaven is
an holy place; so must we in some measure be holy. Seeing you are holy, and
have all your holiness from Christ, listen to him.

2 For their dignity; Partakers together with the rest of the Saints, of the
Heavenly and glorious kingdom, whereunto God in mercy has called us by the
preaching of the Gospel, 1 These. 2.12. Now as GOD has been so gracious to
you, as to make you partakers of his own kingdom, purchased by the blood of
his Son; so listen you with all reverence to him, and cleave to him alone.

Of the heavenly calling, that is, Of the preaching of the Gospel, whereby we
are called to the kingdom of heaven: whom God has predestined, he has
called. The preaching of the Gospel is the bell whereby we are called to
eternal glory. As by the sound of a Trumpet the people were called together in
the time of the Law: so the Word is the silver Trumpet sounding in our ears,
whereby we are called to the Kingdom of Heaven. Blessed are they that be
partakers of this calling. Such are we in England at this present day, if we
had eyes to see it, and hearts to consider it. But GOD calls, and we refuse to
come: wisdom has made ready her Feast, she shath sent her maids into the
streets to call us to her banquet, but we pass not for it. The King made a
Supper for his Son, sent and invited many to it, but they made excuses and came
not: so GOD calls us continually; but some sit at home in their houses, some
ride abroad, etc. when God calls them to his kingdom. As we are partakers of
the heavenly vocation, so let us make a precious account of it, that we may be
called out of the kingdom of darkness, into the kingdom of light, and
remain with Christ for ever.

Then he comes to the admonition it self.

Consider: not lightly, as they that do not mind the thing they look upon:
their eyes are upon it, but their mind is on another matter: do not you so,
but let your mind be wholly fixed on him: look on him with the sharp eye of
your mind: consider, that in him All the treasures of wisdom lie hid: he is a
rich and plentiful Storehouse, in whom ye may find all the Pearls and
Jewels of wholesome doctrine: in him there is salvation, and in no other,
therefore all other teachers set aside, listen to him. When the Judge of an
Assizes gives the charge, all that be in the shire-house, especially they that
be of the great Inquest, consider seriously what is spoken. When a Paul or
Timothy stands in the Pulpit, Christ Jesus the Judge of the whole World,
gives a charge by his Ministry, and shall not we deeply consider it? When the
King makes a speech in the Parliament House, the whole House considers
earnestly what he says: CHRIST JESUS the King of Kings, speaks to us in the
Ministry of the Word, yet few consider the excellent things that be spoken. The
Queen of Sheba considered Solomon well, all that he spoke or did. Behold, here
is a greater than Solomon: Solomon is but a fool to him. Therefore let us
diligently consider what he says. If they were matters of no moment, we were
not to be blamed, though we did not consider them: but being of such weight as
they be, touching the eternal salvation of our souls, what madmen be we,
that we consider them no better? If one should talk to us of gold and silver,
we would consider what he says: Christ speaks to us of that, which surpasses
all the silver in the World, yet we regard him not. Let us consider him now,
that he may consider of us hereafter, when he comes with his holy Angels.

VERSE. 2.
THEN he comes to the description of the party unto whom they must attend. He
describes him by two of his offices: his Apostleship or Prophecy, and his
Priesthood.

As Romans 15.8. he is called the Minister of circumcision: so here, an Apostle,
one that is sent, John 3.2. he was sent from God. Genesis 49.10. of Shalach,
Shiloach. John 20.21. As my Father has sent me, so, etc. He is an honorable
Legate sent from God to us: therefore let us give ear to him: he is Apostolus
Apostolorum, the Prince of Apostles.

2 The High Priest, to perform all things between GOD and us: to present our
prayers to God, as the High Priest did in the time of the Law, and to make
atonement between God and us, by the sacrifice of himself on the Cross.
Pontifex, pontem faciens: so Christ by his passion has made a bridge for us to
go to heaven: therefore let us consider him, and no other.

Of our profession, that is of the Faith and doctrine, Romans 10.10.
which we profess.

And if this be not a sufficient description of him, in the end he names him:
CHRIST JESUS: the anointed of God, and Savior of the world.

He is called an Apostle, or a Prophet sent from GOD, in opposition to Moses,
who was the most worthy Prophet among the Jews: and the high Priest in respect
of Aaron, which was the high Priest in the time of the Law. The LORD JESUS is
all in all, therefore let us all listen to him: Non quid hic, aut ille dixerit:
sed quid Christus, qui fuit ante omnes: none in comparison with him, none in
competition against him.

The first argument, which is first set down simply, then comparatively.

He is a faithful Apostle or Prophet: he has delivered to us the whole
counsel of God, without the mixture of humane inventions: therefore let us
consider him.

To him, that is to God the Father.

That made him, that appointed him the Apostle and high Priest of us all, that
advanced him into this chair of dignity, 1 Samuel 12.6. Acts 2.36.

He may be said to be made of God, in respect of his humanity, Gal. 4.4. but
when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman,
made under the Law.

As Moses so greatly renowned among you.

His fidelity is set forth by the person, to whom he was faithful: by the
place where, 1 Timothy 3.15. 1 Peter 2.5. The whole Church was committed to
CHRIST: So is it to no other. He is the head of the whole Church, in the time
of the law and of the Gospel too.

Then he compares him with Moses.

1. In that wherein they were alike.

2. In that wherein unlike, wherein a dissimilitude between them.

As he was faithful, so was Moses: in that they agree, Number. 12.7. As CHRIST
was faithful in all the Church throughout the world: So Moses was faithful in
all that part of Gods house which was in Israel: they were both faithful. I
derogate nothing from Moses: let him have his due to the full. Moses made the
tabernacle, rites, sacrifices, as GOD prescribed him: CHRIST was faithful,
delivered sound doctrine, not mixed with the glosses of the Pharisees: he was
faithful to the death. Fidelity is a principal quality in a Minister and
steward of Gods house, Matthew. 24.45. 1 Cor. 4.2.

VERSE 3.
NAy, in some respects he is many degrees above Moses.

Moses in the estimation of the Jews, was the most rare and famous Prophet,
Ioh. 9.28. The Scribes and Pharisees sat in Moses chair, Matthew. 16.14. None
durst say he was Moses: they thought none comparable to him: yet here he
exalts CHRIST above Moses; that is, the builder of the house is more
honorable than the house: CHRIST is the builder of the Church the house of
GOD: Moses was but the house; nay, a little part and parcel of the house:
therefore our Savior CHRIST far surpasses him.

CHRIST is more glorious than the whole house, then all in the Church of God:
therefore more glorious than Moses, a piece of the house.

The reddition is more significant. The builder of the house, in all men's
judgment is to be preferred before the house, he is of greater estimation
then the house: for his wisdom, wealth and power in building of it.

The workman is more to be accounted of, then the workmanship: the potter
more than the Pot.

The Church is the house of the living God: the principal builder of this
house is our SAVIOR CHRIST, Matthew. 16.18. upon this rock I will build my
Church: inferior builders under him, as it were his men, are the Ministers and
Preachers: the tool wherewith he builds, is the Word: the mortar wherewith
he fastneth together the spiritual living stones in this building, is faith:
the ground whereon this house stands, is the whole world: for he has his
chosen in all nations: the time of building, is this present life: the wood and
stones concurring in this building, are all the faithful in all ages: they are
all built from time to time by our Savior Christ: he built Adam, Sheth, Enoch,
and Noah before the flood; Abraham, Isack, Jacob before the law was written;
Moses, David, Samuel, and all the Prophets; he built the Virgin Mary his
Mother, Saint Peter, Saint Paul and all the Apostles; and he builds us at
this present day; and will build all his Elect to the end of the world.

2 Cor. 6.1.
We that be the Preachers, together with him are builders. Saint Paul and the
rest of the Apostles, were arch-builders: yet our building is nothing worth, of
no force and efficacy without him. Saint Paul may plant, and Apollos may water:
but God must give the increase. CHRIST said to Saint Peter, I will make thee a
fisher of men, Matthew. 4.19. Yet without Christ he could catch never a fish,
Luke 5.5. So we may build, till our hearts and hands ache, and yet not lay one
stone well in the building, without the Lord Jesus. By one Sermon of Peter's,
three thousand souls were added to the Church, Act. 2.41. yet Christ wrought
at that Sermon, else Saint Peter's preaching had been in vain. It was not so
much St. Philip, as Christ that built the City of Samaria, as a glorious house
for the LORD. It was not Saint Paul but GOD, which by the key of his holy
Spirit opened the heart of Lydia to believe: and it is Christ Jesus at this
day, that builds us up by the preaching of the Gospel. As they say in the
Psalm; except the Lord build the house, Psalm. 127.1.
they labor in vain that build it: So may we at every Sermon; except the LORD
JESUS CHRIST build with the Preacher, we shall never be a fit house for GOD
Almighty. Therefore let us all be suitors to CHRIST, that it would please him,
by his holy, blessed and powerful spirit, to build us up daily more and more,
and to water all the Sermons we hear, with the dew of his gracious spirit.

VERSE 4.
HE does illustrate it by a common received principle.

Mervaile not, though I said, the Church is built; for every house must be
built of some: the Church is an house, even the house of the living GOD:
therefore it must be built. By whom? Not by a mortal man, but by the immortal
GOD, which is Jesus Christ. Christ, 1 Cor. 3.11. is the foundation, in respect
of doctrine: he is the material and efficient cause of the building. An house
consisting of many stones and pieces of wood, must have an artificer to put
them together: so the Church consisting of Jews and Gentiles, of all people in
the world, must be fastened together, by the Lord Jesus Christ.

The force of the Article is not to be omitted: all those things whereof we
entreat, appertaining to the Church the house of GOD.

It is true that CHRIST built all things in the world, as well as in the
Church: but that is impertinent to the scope of the place: therefore it is
fittest to restrain the universal particle to that which we have in hand.

As in the former Verse was contained the proposition of the argument: So in
this the assumption. The builder of the Church is greater than Moses, or the
whole Church: Christ is the builder of this house, being the high and eternal
GOD; therefore greater than Moses and all the Church.

VERSE 5.
THe second comparison. What then? Make thou no reckoning of Moses? Yes, as a
servant, but not as the Lord and Master of the Church.

The Son and heir has greater pre-eminence in the house, then any servant.
Christ is the Son, Moses the servant.

1. The Son, especially the eldest Son and heir, is more reverenced in the
house then any servant. Mark. 12.6.
I will send my Son, it may be they will reverence him. Moses being a worthy
servant in the house, was greatly honored in his time: but CHRIST is honored
in all ages. He was reverenced but of men: CHRIST is worshipped by the Angels
themselves: the Angels came, and ministered unto him, Matthew. 4.11.

Ioh. 8.35.
2. The servant abides not in the house for ever: there is change of servants
almost every year. Moses was in the militant Church but for a time, he served
out his years and went away: CHRIST tarryeth in the Church for ever.

3. The servant waits on his Master, he sits not at the same board with
his Master, as the Son does. So Moses was attendant on GOD: but CHRIST
sits at the right hand of GOD as equal in Majesty with him.

4. The servant may look for his wages: but he has no right, no title to the
goods that be in the house, as the Son has. So Moses as a servant had his
wages of Gods mercy, that is, eternal life: but Christ has right to the
Church, it is his possession.

5. A servant may be faithful in some measure, but not so faithful as the
Son, whose the house is, and all things in the house: wherefore Christ far
excels Moses.

Both the parts are handled severally.

I do not deject Moses, when I set up Christ. Let Moses be honored in his
place, and Christ in his.

He was no coozening and deceitful Merchant, but faithful in all the house of
GOD, committed to his charge: but how? As a servant, not as Lord of the house.
Saint Paul has made choice of the fairest word the Grecians have for a
servant: he does not call him (...) or (...), but (...), an ingenuous servant,
that in respect of that reverent estimation, which he has of his Master,
performs to him all the duties and offices that he can: one, that honors and
reverences his master: he was a most rare and honorable servant.

Wherein did his service consist? in bearing witness to Christ. Which
hereafter should be published in all Ages concerning Christ to the people, as
they were able to conceive of those heavenly mysteries. Moses prophesied of
CHRIST, Deuteronomy. 18.15. and Acts 3.22. he wrote of CHRIST, John 5.46. he
instituted many types and figures of our Savior Christ; as the Paschall Lamb,
the brazen Serpent, etc. Thus did he bear witness to CHRIST, to the Gospel:
this was one special piece of service that he did. So the Apostles were
CHRIST's witnesses: and so be the preachers at this day.

Here we may behold the antiquity of the Gospel: it is at least, as old as
Moses, which was the first Writer that we read of. The Athenians thought it to
be a new doctrine. Yet it is as ancient as Moses; nay, as Adam: for the
doctrine of the Gospel was in Paradise.

VERSE 6.
YE have heard what Moses was, now see what Christ is.

And there is great ods between the Son and the Servant. Christ was a servant
too: Isay 53. yet he served GOD as a Son, not as a Servant. A Son serves his
Father, not in the house, as Moses; but over the House, as the Ruler and
Governor of the House.

Not over another man's house, as Moses was; but over his own house: the house
was his own: therefore more reverence by many degrees is due to Christ, than
was to Moses. If the people heard him with great attention, much more ought we
in the time of the Gospel to give ear to Christ, that speaks to us in the
ministry of the Word: This is my beloved Son, hear him.

Now in the end, the Apostle makes an exposition of the Allegory, and applies
it to them to whom he writes.

I do not speak of the Tabernacle or Temple, which were glorious houses,
wherein God in some sort dwelt: but I speak of Gods spiritual house, the
Church, a part whereof you are, as well as Moses, and they in the time of the
Law.

All Christians in all Ages are the house of God.

What a singular honor is this, that we should be Gods house? yea, his
dwelling house? 1. A Nobleman has many Houses, which he dwells not in
himself, but lets them forth to other men: we are not houses to let, but
God himself dwells in us: we are his Mansion House. The Centurion said to
Christ, I am not worthy that thou should come under my roof: so may we say,
Ephesians. 3.17. Apoc. 3.20.
we are mortal and sinful men, houses of clay, unworthy that God should come
under our roof: yet it pleases him of his infinite mercy to dwell in such
base houses as we are.

2 If God dwell in us, and we be his house, then how neat and handsome should
it be kept? Shall a Kings house be overgrowne with weeds? Shall there be filthy
and sluttish corners in a Kings Palace? And shall we that profess our selves
to be Gods house, be full of pride, envy, and malice, that be stinking weeds
in the nostrils of God? Shall Gods house be full of swearers, drunkards,
adultereres, etc. The devil found his house swept and garnished to his mind,
and shall not Gods house be swept for the entertaining of him? Let us garnish
our selves, which are Gods house, with the sweet flowers of faith, love, hope,
zeal, humility, temperance, patience, sobriety, that God may take delight to
dwell in us.

3 There is no man, especially if he dwell in an house, and it be his own, but
will bestow needful reparations on it: and do you think God will suffer his
house to lie unrepaired? nay, being Gods house, we shall want nothing for soul
or body. If we decay in faith, zeal, and other graces of his spirit, he will
in due season repair them again, he will keep his house wind-tyde, and
water-tyde, he will preserve it from wind and weather: yea, the gates of hell
shall never prevail against his house.

4 A man may have an house and be defeated of it; some wrangling Lawyer may
wring it out of his hand, or he may be weary of his house, and make it away:
none can snatch Gods house out of his hand: he is no changling, he will keep
his house for ever. Blessed are we that be GODS house! and the Lord give us
grace to keep us undefiled for his Majesty, that he may take pleasure to dwell
in us in this World, and we may dwell with him in the World to come.

What? are we the house of God simply? Live as we list, and do what we will? No
verily: but if we hold fast the confidence, etc. One special quality of a good
house is to be firm, and stable: if it be a tottering house, ready to shake in
every wind and tempest, a man will have small joy to dwell in it: even so, we
that be the house of God Almighty, must not be wavering and inconstant, but we
must stand sure, and hold fast the graces we have received. There be two things
which we must hold fast; faith and hope: the boldness that we have by faith,
to come into the presence of God, to whom we have access by Christ,
apprehended by faith: and by virtue whereof we may boldly call God Father, and
open our minds freely to him: that is the nature of the word.

Unto faith must be annexed hope: faith makes a Christian, hope nourishes and
susteines a Christian: we must hold both fast.

As we have begun to put our trust in Christ, so we must make him our pillar to
lean upon continually: as we have begun to hope for eternal happiness
purchased by Christ, so we must still stand in a steadfast expectation of it.
Though persecution arise for the Gospel, though we be clapped up into prison,
banished out of our country, though we be put to the fire for the name of
Christ, yet let us not cast away our hope, let us not deny Christ, and sleep
in an whole skin: let not the pleasures and profits of this world carry us away
from Christ: though death it self come, yet let us trust in him. We are wont
to be hold-fasts in our money, none shall easily get that from us: but let us
chiefly be hold-fasts in the Pearls and graces of the Spirit. Whatsoever
comes, let us hold faith and hope fast: let Houses and Lands, Wife and
Children, yea, our own life go, rather than them. Thus if we hold the
confidence that we have in CHRIST, and the rejoicing of our hope to the end, we
shall be Gods houses in this life, and be received up into that house which is
made without hands in the heavens.

He does not simply say, ( hope,) but the rejoicing of the hope, the glorying
of hope. Satan and his instruments go about to overthrow our hope, and mock
at it. It is a goodly thing I warrant you, which you hope for? What fools are
you, in hope of an imaginary kingdom hereafter, to deprive your selves of so
many pleasures in this life? be wiser than so: A bird in the hand is better
than two in the bush. Take your pleasure while you be here, and hope not, ye
cannot tell for what.

To that he opposes this glorying and rejoicing. Yea, Romans 5.2.
boast of your hope, even before your enemies faces, what excellent things are
reposed for you, and rejoice in this hope, as if you had the kingdom of heaven
already.

Not as if these did make us the house of GOD: but by these we shall have an
assurance to our selves, that we are the house of GOD.

A Father says to his Son, if thou will be no Alehouse hunter, but do as I
will have thee, thou shall be my Son: this does not make him his Son; for
he was his Son before: but it assures him to be his Son. A Captain says
to his soldier, if thou will play the man, and not shrink in the wetting,
thou shall be my Soldier, yet he was his Soldier before: so here, if ye
hold fast faith and hope, ye shall be my house; that is, all the world shall
see indeed that you are my house; not for a while, but to the end: So as
neither we faint in persecution, nor in the time of prosperity be drowned in
the pleasures and profits of this world. Be faithful to the end: he that
continues to the end shall be saved.

The second argument is desumed from the testimony of the Holy Ghost.

In the allegation of the testimony, first a charge, not to shut up their ears
and hearts against this worthy and heavenly Prophet, but to entertain him
with all reverence. Secondly, a strengthening of the charge by an argument,
which he disputes by the example of their fathers.

Where, first the sin of their fathers: then the punishment of the sin.
Their sin is set down, first generally; then particularly, with the
circumstances belonging to it; of the place where it was committed, the persons
by whom, the nature and quality of the sin: amplified by the means they had to
call from it, the time how long they continued in this sin.

The punishment is double. 1. GODS wrath and displeasure. 2. A definitive
sentence proceeding from it, an exclusion of them out of his rest.

VERSE 7.
SEeing we have such a rare and excellent Prophet, as is not as a servant, but
as the Son in the house of GOD, let us attend to him: and for so much as
faith makes us to be of this house, and hope is as a pillar for the susteining
of us in it; let us beware of infidelity, that pulls down the house, and shuts
up the door against this Prophet, that he cannot enter in into us.

Now because he was to make a commemoration of the stubbornness and
contumacie of the ancient Israelites, which in time rejected this Prophet, and
would not hear him; very wisely for offending of the Hebrews, he delivers it
in the words of the Holy Ghost, rather then of his own. They would
peradventure have kicked against his reproof: but they durst not spurn at the
reprehension of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost long ago by the mouth of David
provoked the people to lysten to CHRIST, the true Prophet of the Church:
therefore let us all attend to him.

The Author of this Epistle was not ignorant, that David was the penman or
Author of this Psalm: for he himself affirms, Hebr. 4.7. yet he does not
say, as David speaks, but as the Holy Ghost says: whereby he gives us to
understand; that the Holy Ghost, the third person in the glorious Trinity
speaks in the Scriptures: the whole Scripture is given by inspiration of God,
2 Timothy 3.16. this heavenly spirit did breath them into those worthy
instruments, which he used: 2 Pet. 1. ult.
Holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. The Manichees
said, that the evil GOD was the Author of the Old Testament, and the good GOD
of the new: yet the Holy Ghost spoke in the Old Testament. This then is the
prerogative of the sacred Scripture above other wrytings. In other books men
speak: but in this God speaks. In other writings, Tullie, Seneca, Plato,
Aristotle, Plutarch speaks, who indeed were wise and learned men: but in the
books of holy Scripture the Holy Ghost speaks, which is the fountain of all
wisdom. In them the servants speak: in this the LORD speaks. In them the
subjects: in this the Prince. The Holy Ghost speaks in the books of Moses,
of the Psalms, of the Prophets, in the books of the New Testament: yet such
is the blindness of our understanding, and the corruption of our nature, that
we prefer humanity before Divinity, the writing of men before the writings of
God, the Moon before the Sun: we had rather be reading of humane Authors,
then of these heavenly books, wherein the HOLY GHOST speaks to us.

Now if ye will hear his voice, as God has commanded you to do, Deuteronomy.
18.18. Then harden not your hearts. Thus it is as clear as the noone day, that
the Spirit of God gives an evident testimony of our Savior CHRIST. To day. In
the time of the Gospel. The law was as the night: this as the day. While he
speaks to us. 2 Cor. 6.2. CHRIST spoke in Moses time, in David's time, he
spoke in his own person on the earth, and he speaks in the Ministry of the
Gospel to the worlds end. The Gentiles that were not as yet of CHRIST'S fold,
hear the voice of CHRIST, Ioh. 10. but CHRIST is now in heaven: therefore the
voice of the Preachers is the voice of CHRIST.

He does not say, to morrow: post it not off till to morrow, but hear it To
day, while it may be heard.

VERSE 8.
WHat then? He does not say, stop not up your years: we must not do that
neither: but it is in vain for the ear to hear, if the heart be hardened:
therefore first he begins with the heart. God opened the heart of Lydia. The
heart is the principal thing which GOD requires in the hearing of the Word.
In vain do we hear with our ears, if our hearts be not opened: therefore
says the Holy Ghost, harden not your hearts.

GOD hardens the hearts of men, and men harden their own hearts.

He hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and Deuteronomy. 2.30. GOD hardneth not only
permissive, but also active: the LORD has a kind of act in it, his providence
is in it. He gave up the Gentiles unto their own lusts, Romans 1.24. 2 These.
2.11.
He sends the wicked strong delusions to believe lies. He did not only
suffer Pharaohs heart to be hardened, but he hardened it indeed: How? Not
infundendo malitiam, by infusing evil into our hearts, for they be as pots
full of all impiety already: GOD needs not, nay GOD cannot, it is repugnant to
his nature, to put any evil into us: yet he does not harden only subtrahendo
gratiam, though that be one means; but by having an operation in the action:
yet so as he is free from the least imputation of sin. As hardness of heart
comes from GOD, it is a punishment of sin, of our former contempt of his grace
and mercy offered to us: as it proceeds from our selves, it is a sin, yea
an horrible sin.

To conclude, we first contemn that grace which should soften our hearts, and
then God hardens them.

We our selves, properly to speak, are the hardners of our own hearts. GOD
gives us his sacred word as a trumpet to waken us out of sin, he sends us his
Ministers and Preachers, as bells to toll us to the kingdom of heaven: they
will us in GODS name to believe in CHRIST, to forsake our sins, be they never
so near or dear unto us: we for all that, harden our hearts, that those
heavenly admonitions cannot enter into them. Let God say what he will, let him
preach by his Ambassadors; we will still continue in unbelief and dwell in
our sins: we say with them in the Gospel, we will not have this man to
reign over us. Luke 19.14.
Sin shall be our King, Lord and Master. CHRIST JESUS shall not rule us by
his word and Spirit. This is the hardness of heart that is in us by nature. Oh
Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy children together, and ye
would not? Matthew. 23.37. The LORD sent his Prophets early and late: 2 Chronicles.
36.16. and in Zach. 7.12. there is a wonderful example to this purpose.

This hardness of heart reigns exceedingly at this present day, yea even in
those towns where there is most plentiful preaching. Therefore let us entreat
the LORD to give us a new heart, to take from us this heart of stone, and give
us an heart of flesh: let us desire him, by the dew of his spirit to mollify
our hearts, that the heavenly doctrines, exhortations and admonitions delivered
to us, may sink deeply into our hearts, and make a conversion of us: that our
hearts may melt, as Iosiah's did at the hearing of the law. Nothing can enter
into that which is hard: if the ground be hard, it cannot receive the seed: if
the Wax be hard, it cannot take the impression of any seal: and so long as
our hearts remain hard, they cannot receive the immortal seed of the word,
nor the print of the Spirit, which is GODS seal. Wherefore let us be suitors
to God, to soften our hearts daily more and more. Above all evils, the Lord
deliver us from hardness of heart, for that is the ready way to hell. When ye
be at Sermons, harden not your hearts against the vices, that are reproved, but
tremble at the word of GOD, be grieved for your sins, open the doors of your
hearts to the Lord Jesus which stands knocking at them with the hammer of his
word, that he may come and suppe with you in this life, and you dine and suppe
with him in the life to come.

From this hardness of heart he disswadeth them, by the fearful judgment of
God, that fell upon their fathers for it: which he propounds first generally.

In the provocation. Hebr. (Meribah:) in the chiding and contending, when the
fathers chode and contended with Moses: which Saint Paul calls an exacerbation
or provocation, because God by that was provoked to anger, in so much as he
became very bitter in words and deeds toward the Israelites.

Do not you dance after that Pipe, and walk according as they did.

Temptation. Hebr. (Massah,) which is expounded afterward.

It is a question among interpreters, to what place of the Old Testament Saint
Paul here alludeth. Some refer it to that, Numb. 14. Where after the return
of the Spies they despaired of entering into the Land of Canaan, and murmured
against GOD and Moses.

Others, to that. Exodus 17. where water came out of the rock: whereas before,
they murmured for want of water. There may be some allusion to both places: for
the one place has her name of the contending, and tempting, and is called, (
Massah and Meribah;) and in the other place is contained the form of the oath
that God used.

Nevertheless, it were fittest to expound it generally of the stubborn and
contumelious behavior of the Israelites in the wilderness, then of any one
particular temptation.

1. Because he names no particular place, but the wilderness in general.

2. Because the tempting he speaks of here, lasted the whole forty years.

3. The word, ( day,) is often taken in Scripture not for any set and prescript
time, but for an indefinite time, a continuance of time, Ioh. 8.56. Psalm.
25.5. all the time that the temptation lasts, Psalm. 50.15. As ( to day) in
the former verse was largely taken: So here.

4. Number. 14.22. It is apparent, that they tempted him many times.

Then he describes it by all particular circumstances belonging to it.

1. By the place where this sin was committed, in the wilderness, where they
were subject to innumerable dangers, scarsitie of meat and drink, to the
invasion of wild beasts, compassed with enemies on every side: yet the LORD was
as a wall of fire round about them, he carried them on Eagles wings, he
suffered none to do them any wrong, but reproved Kings for their sakes.
Notwithstanding in this place where they were continually under the wings of
GODS protection, they tempted him and provoked him to wrath: as if the Child
should scratch the nurses face, when he is in her arms.

VERSE 9.
2. THe parties that committed this offense, were their Fathers, of whom they
much gloried and boasted. Our fathers eat Manna in the wilderness. God made a
covenant with our fathers, that he would be their God, and they should be his
people. The oracles of God were committed to our fathers. God talked familiarly
with our fathers, our fathers were deep in Gods books. If we do as our
fathers did, we cannot do amiss. I but our fathers must not always be a
rule for us to follow: your fathers tempted CHRIST in the wilderness, so must
not you do: your fathers resisted the HOLY GHOST, so must not you: your
fathers killed the Prophets, your fathers were often ready to stone Moses, so
must not you. The Papists at this day are the Jews Apes: they are likewise
wedded to their fathers. Our fathers were of this Religion, therefore we will
be of it: our fathers kissed the Popes feet: ergo. Our Fathers cast off the
yoke of CHRIST, therefore we will do the same: our fathers would be joint
Saviors with Christ, they would merit heaven, therefore we will do the like:
our fathers worshipped they knew not what, so we will do.

But Saint Paul gives us a better rule: be ye followers of me, as I am of
Christ, 1 Cor. 11.1. If our fathers followed CHRIST, let us follow them,
otherwise let them go alone: thy father drowned himself, and will thou drown
thy self too?

The Father of lights must be preferred before the fathers of darkness: the
Father of heaven before the fathers on earth. If we delight in antiquity, let
us do as the ancient of days prescribes us: let us not dote with our fathers,
and go to hell with our fathers.

Children must be content to hear of their fathers sins, for the better
avoiding of them. If any rail of our fathers that be dead, spew out their
poison against them, disgrace our fathers where there is no cause, or rake up
the infirmities of our fathers, a^ out of graves; we have just cause to be
moved at it: but if any in the fear and zeal of GOD admonish us of our
fathers gross and notorious offenses, that we stumble not at the same stones
and break our necks as they did; we are to take it in good part, and profit
by it: to that end does the Apostle here make a commemoration of their fathers
sins: but do not you tempt me, as they did.

The quality of their sin, was a tempting and proving of him: probaverunt:
that is causa curiositatis exquisiverunt an possem facere: Number. 11.18.

God is tempted diverse ways.

1. If having means, we neglect them, fondly flying to the supposed providence
of GOD: if CHRIST having a pair of stairs to come down by, should have cast
himself down from the pinnacle of the Temple, he had tempted GOD. Many that
be sick, would feign be well, but they are resolute to use no physic: many
would gladly fare well, have sufficient for themselves, their Wives and
Children, but they will not labor, nor take pains: that is a tempting of God.

2. Men tempt God, when having had evident proof and manifest experience of
his wisdom, power, mercy, and goodness; yet if they be driven into any
streights, and see no present means to come out, then they murmr against
God, despair of his providence, and are ready to exclaim against God. This
was the Israelites fault: and thus often times they tempted God in the
wilderness. If they wanted water to quench their thirst withal; then they
must needs dye, God was not able to provide them water.

If they wanted bread; So they did likewise, and in a pelting chafe were ready
to stone Moses and Aaron. Then they would back again to Egypt; then they
wished themselves dead: as if the same God, that had miraculously beyond the
expectation of men provided for them heretofore, was not able to do so still.
So when some told them of the walled towns that were in the land of Canaan, of
the mighty Giants that were in the Country in comparison of whom they were but
Grasse-hoppers; then they brake forth into this exclamation; God is not able to
bring us into this land; we and our Children shall perish in this wilderness.

They had seen with what a strong hand God had brought them out of Egypt, how
miraculously he divided the red Sea, that the waters stood as a wall on both
sides till they safely passed over: yet for all that, when they were in any
difficulty, then God was no body, of no power or willingness to do for them.
This was a vile tempting of God, which highly displeased him.

But there is no reason, why we should thus tempt God, casting off the hope and
confidence we have in him. He is subject to no changes; yesterday and to day
the same for ever. Men may change, but God changes not: a man may be strong to
day, and weak to morrow; whole to day, and sick to morrow; rich now, and poor
afterward: alive now, and dead a while after: a man may love us this hour,
and hate us the next, as Amnon did his sister: therefore we may make a question
of the help of man. But God is one and the same continually, not a shadow of
turning in him: his arm is never shortened, the welspring of his mercy and
goodness is never dried up.

Therefore in all distresses let us trust in him, though all worldly means
fail us: in sickness and health, in poverty and wealth, in death and life,
let him be our pillar to lean upon. The Prince that would not believe the
plenty, that GOD had promised, was trodden to death, 2 Reg. 7.17. and the
carcasses of these men that thus tempted God, fell in the wilderness:
therefore let us beware of incredultie. As Faith is the best virtue: so
infidelity is the greatest vice. CHRIST could do nothing among his own
kinsfolk, because of their unbelief. Shall any thing be impossible with God?
Indeed, that which he wills not, that he cannot do: it is his will that CHRIST
in respect of his humanity should be in heaven, till the day of judgment:
therefore he cannot do this, make his body to be here on the earth. The
Papists set Gods omnipotency on the tainters, and stretch it too far, as some
bad clothiers deal with cloth.

But if God have once given us his faithful promise to do this or that, let
us believe it, though all the world say nay to it. God had promised to bring
them into the land of Canaan, though there were never so many blocks in the
way, they should have depended on this promise. So God has promised us the
kingdom of heaven: fear not little flock, it is your Fathers pleasure to
give you the kingdom, Luke 12.32. though now and then through weakness we
fall into sin, though Satan and his instruments rage, though we be sick,
dye, be buried, our bodies consumed to dust and ashes, yet let us certainly
know we shall have this kingdom.

This is amplified by an excellent means which they had to pull them out of
this infidelity: which was a continual view and contemplation of the
wonderful works of God: although they saw my works, in the Hebr. they saw
the Egyptians drowned in the red Sea, and themselves safely walking through
it, they saw the cloudy pillar, conducting them day and night; water gushing
out of a stony rock; Manna descending from heaven, that the clothes on their
backs and shoes on their feet did not wax old many years together, they
might have felt with their hands the power and goodness of GOD protecting
them; yet they would not believe in him: whereas the sight of Gods former
works should strengthen our faith in all future calamities. That use did David
make of the works of GOD. The LORD delivered me from the claws of the Bear,
and paws of the Lion: therefore he will deliver me from this Philistim. GOD
was gracious to me in such a sickness: therefore he will be in this. GOD
provided for me when I was a child and could not shift for my self: therefore
he will provide for me being a man grown. GOD preserved me in such a plague
and pestilence, therefore I will depend on him still: when I was in such an
extremity, GOD helped me; therefore he will help me still. God delivered
England in the year one thousand five hundred eighty eight, therefore if
England serve him, he will deliver it still.

When Queen Elizabeth, the mirror of the world, was taken away, we looked for
a woeful day; yet God gave us a joyful day after it: therefore always let us
trust to him: let the sight of his wonderful works daily before our eyes, be
as oil to nourish the lamp of our faith, that it never dye.

The last circumstance appertaining to this sin, is the time how long it
continued, they tempted and proved him 40. years, though they saw his works.
These words in the Hebr. are coupled with that which follows: 40. years was
I grieved with that generation. Yet there is no jarre between Paul and David:
for these two are convertible, and depend the one on the other.

They be both true: they tempted God 40. years, and he was grieved with them
40. years. If they tempted him 40. years, then he must needs be grieved with
them: and if God was grieved with them 40. years, then they tempted him so
long, so that the one cannot be separated from the other.

They dwelt in this sin a long time, and would not be plucked out of it.

VERSE 10.
THe punishment of the sin. Gods wrath was kindled against them. In the end,
after he had borne the burden of their sins many years together, his wrath
did break out against them for it. They were irksome and tedious to me. I
could bear them no longer, after that I had striven with them forty years --
when there was no remedy, I cast them off.

God is grieved similitudinarie.

That rebellious, that obstinate generation. He was not grieved with their
Children, but with them. The Children do not smart for the fathers faults, if
they make not their fathers sins, their own sins. Their Children went into
the land of Canaan, though they did not.

Least it should seem to be a grief or anger without reason, he shows the
equity of it: they were a blind, ignorant and perverse people, that would not
hear me; therefore I was worthily grieved with them.

They are a vagrant and wandering people, straying out of the way. He does not
say, they have erred; but err: continually erring: ever. Not in their outward
lives and conversations only, but in their heart, which carries the whole man
after it: there he points, out the fountain of this sin: the corruption of
their hearts. If the heart be blind, the whole man must needs be blind.

Ways, that is my laws and commandments. These be the ways wherein we
ought to walk: or, my works: quia per ea ad nos venit, to impart his benefits
to us, and to open himself to us. They had means enough to come to the
knowledge of my ways: my servant Moses and others were ever teaching of them,
but they willingly continued ignorant, and would not know my ways. For this
cause I have cast them off; this is that corruption which is in us all by
nature: an ignorance of the will of God, that carries us from Gods ways to the
Devils ways, Ephesians. 4.17, 18.

Yet there is in men a double ignorance: the one is simplex and insita, the
other is composita and affectata. All by nature err and are drowned in
ignorance. Paul saw at Athens an inscription on an Altar, ignoto deo: but many
of them, if God send the candle of knowledge amongst them, skip for joy, and
embrace it with both arms. Others, though they live in those places, where the
light shines before their eyes, where there is continual preaching, yet they
remain ignorant still; some through carelessness and negligence not regarding
it; others even upon will and stomach, they close up their eyes, and will not
see the light. Such were many of these Israelites, they would not know the
ways of God. A fearful thing to live in the Church where God is preached,
and not to know him.

VERSE 11.
WHereupon God proceeds to a definitive sentence against them: which he
ratifieth with an oath.

Seeing they be such an obstinate people: he does not say, but swear, not in
sport and merriment, but being much moved, hot and angry against them for
their sins.

If they shall enter. Constructio est defectiva, ad modum irati, qui truncat
verba sua: it is a passionate speech, when a man is so moved, as that he
cannot bring forth his words: an usual Aposiopesis. Something must be
supplied, If they shall enter into my rest, let me be counted no GOD, let me
never be believed hereafter. The suppressing of these imprecations, does argue
that they should be seldom used by us. So did Abram, Genesis 14.22. Christ, Mar.
8.12. Saul, 1 Samuel 14.44. whereas we in our anger cannot contain our selves,
but furious speeches come by and by out of our mouths. If I be not even with
him, I pray God I may sink where I stand, never enter into the kingdom of
heaven, etc. We should not be so rash in producing of them.

God, as ye see, swears, so may we do: if we could keep our selves within
those limits, that he did.

1. God swears seldom: the Scripture does not bring him in swearing often: at
every word, as we do.

2. When God swears, it is by himself, by no creature: we swear by blood,
wounds, fire, bread, cheese, etc.

3. It is a matter of weight that makes God swear: he does not swear upon
every trifling occasion, as we do: it was a matter of importance that made
him swear now, even the establishing of his justice, that men should beware
how they provoke him by their sins.

4. God swears not rashly in heat and choler, as we do: if our blood be
stirred, then we swear vengeably. Though it be here said, he swear in his
wrath, yet it was a just and advised anger; not a choleric fury, as ours is.

There be two things that make God swear: the one is the confirmation of his
mercy, and gracious promises to his Children; Hebr. 6.17.

The other is the strengthening of his justice, and threatenings against the
wicked; as in this place: and let us beware when God swears. If the King do
not only say, such a man shall dye, but swears to it, then there is little
hope of life for him. God has not only said but sworn, that all contemners of
his word, that harden their hearts against it, shall perish eternally.
Therefore there is no dallying, let us look to it.

An horrible sin that wrings an oath from God.

It is called, his rest, because he in his eternal counsel prepared it for
them, and promised it to them long ago: and it was he that brought them into
that rest.

This rest is double. 1. The Land of Canaan, which is called a rest in regard
of their continual toils and turmoyles in the wilderness, where they were
always molested with flitting up and down: but when they came into this land,
they should rest. Here they rested under their Vines and Figtrees: hence it
has the name of rest. 2. By it also is meant the Kingdom of Heaven, where we
shall rest with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob for ever. Now were all they that dyed
in the wilderness, excluded from that rest too? no. Moses never came into the
Land of Canaan: yet he came into the Kingdom of Heaven. I dare not say, that
all that were overwhelmed with the flood, went to hell; nor, that all were
deprived of the celestial Canaan, that missed of the earthly: but the wicked
persisting in their sins without repentance, undoubtedly lost both.

The cause why they were deprived of this rest, was their stubborn contempt of
God, in his Servant Moses speaking to them from time to time. He persuaded them
by a true and lively faith to depend upon God, assuring them, that as he had
promised them the Land of Canaan, so, what difficulty soever came, he would one
day put them into a peaceful possession of the Land: but they would not
believe it: when any thing crossed them, then they would go to Egypt again.
Therefore let us take off that sin, that we be not partakers with them of the
punishment. As Christ said, behold a greater than Solomon is here: So say I of
the ministry of the Gospel, a greater than Moses is here.

If the ancient Israelites lost the land of Canaan, and some of them the
Celestial Canaan too, for despising Moses, and for murmuring against him and
grieving him: how shall we escape that contemn Christ, the Apostle and High
Priest of our profession, which is so far greater than Moses, as the Son
and heir of the house, is above the servant in the house? 2 Cor. 13.3.
Christ spoke by Saint Paul and the rest of the Apostles in their time, and he
speaks by us, which are His Ambassadors at this day: therefore harden not
your hearts against his preaching, least he shut you out of his rest, but
reverently embrace his preaching, let Christ enter into your hearts by His Word
and Spirit; that ye may have rest and peace of conscience in this life; and be
received up into his everlasting rest where ye shall never be molested any
more, in the life to come.

Now follows the application of the former testimony: wherein. 1. A naration
of the use, that we are to make of it. 2. A further declaration or exposition
of it, a 16. to the end. In the use. 1. An admonition. 2. A reason. In the
admonition. 1. A disswasion from the poison of infidelity, that was the bane
and destruction of the Israelites. 2. A persuasion to a mutual exhorting and
stirring up one of an other: which may be a counter-poyson against infidelity.
In the disswasion, the manner, and the matter of it.

VERSE ^^
1 FOr the manner, he gives them a caveat to take heed of it. See to it; it is
a dangerous vice, therefore beware of it.

2 He draws them to the embracing of this caveat, by a loving title given to
them. One brother should be careful of the good of an other: I count you as my
brethren in the Lord Jesus, having all one Father, and one elder brother,
Christ Jesus: therefore I could not but in love give you this watchword.

And what is the substance of it? whereof should they take heed? sooner, or
later: at no time they must forsake Christ. There is no time for them that be
on the Sea, to make shipwreck, especially when they be near the haven: you
have begun long ago to give up your names to CHRIST; continue with Him, and
forsake Him at no time.

In any of you. For mine own part I love you all, and would be loath that any
of you should perish.

What? he does not say, an evil eye, an evil tongue, an evil hand, but an
evil heart: that is the fountain of all.

And least they should be ignorant, what kind of evil heart he means, he
adds of infidelity, that is, according to the Hebrew phrase, an evil
unfaithful heart, that is possessed with infidelity, as the hearts of the
Israelites were.

What to do? what will infidelity cause us to do? it will produce a
lamentable effect, if we look not to it: it will make us depart from the
living God: to leave His camp and to go to the enemies camp; that is the
nature of the Word.

From whom? from God to men; from him that lives for ever, to them that
continue but a while: this is the horrible sin of infidelity; these fruits it
has, therefore let it be eschewed by us all.

The conjunction (...), Verse 7. is to be referred hither, as if all the rest
had been included in a parenthesis. Wherefore as the HOLY GHOST said to them
of old time: so say I to you now; beware that the same unfaithful heart be
not in you that was in them.

1 Here we are taught, that we of the new testament, must make use of the
examples that be in the old. Whatsoever things were written before time, were
written for our learning. Romans 15.4. Hence it is that Noah's flood, wherein the
whole world was drowned, that the destruction of the Sodomites, the overthrow
of Tire and Sydon, Lots Wife, and such like are mentioned in the writings of
the Evangelists and Apostles: and Saint Paul in this place will have them to
beware of infidelity, which was the overthrow of their fathers. We read the
Scriptures cursorily, to be acquainted with the History, that we may be able to
talk of it: but we make not that profitable use of them for the reformation of
our lives, as we ought to do. If any in the time of the Law have been
punished for any sin, let us take heed of that sin.

2 Whereas the Apostle charge us especially to take heed of an evil and
unfaithful heart; it gives us to understand, that every Christian is to look
most carefully to his heart. It is good to set a watch over our eyes, hands,
feet, tongues, but chiefly for to set a watch over our hearts: Keep thy heart
with diligence, omni custodia. Prove. 4.23.
The heart carries all the body, as the great wheel in a clock does the whole
clock: therefore let us all have an eye to it, that it be in good temper. Out
of the heart come Murders, Adultery, all kind of mischiefs: therefore let us
take heed to our hearts. It is a folly to go about to stop the stream, if
the fountain remain unstopped. A beautiful apple is not worth a straw, if it
be rotten at the Core. The root of the tree is especially regarded by every
good husband, that there be no worms in it: otherwise it is a folly to look
to the branches. Let us that be Christians, sift and examine our hearts, let us
labor to purge and cleanse them: especially, let us take heed, that the worm
of infidelity, which will cause us to depart from God, be not breeding in them.

That is the maine point that he aymeth at. Infidelity is a grievous sin. As
faith is the greatest virtue: so infidelity is the greatest vice. Christ could
do nothing among His own brethren, for their unbelief sake: Matthew. 13. ult.
Infidelity is a bar to keep out Gods blessings. Our Savior after His
Resurrection reproved the eleven Apostles, for their infidelity. Mark 16.14.
The Holy Ghost shall rebuke the world of sin, because they did not believe in
Christ: John 16.9. The Jews were cut off for their infidelity, and we that be
Christians stand by faith. Romans 11.20. The noble man that would not believe
Gods promise, was trodden under feet in the gate: 2 Reg. 7.17. The ancient
Israelites whom God brought with a mighty arm out of Egypt, perished in the
wilderness for their infidelity, and never set a foot into the promised land.
Therefore take heed, there be not in any of you an unfaithful heart: shall we
not believe God? shall we make him a liar? has he said it, and shall He not do
it? Let us not upon the sight of every difficulty murmr against God, as the
Israelites did, and cast away the hope we have in His mercy and power; but let
us at all times, and in all extremities trust in Him.

Let us never depart from Christ Jesus, which is the high and living God, as
the Israelites did. Will ye also go away, said Christ to his Apostles? no,
says Saint Peter, in the name of the rest. Lord, whither shall we go? thou
have the words of Eternal life. There is no name under heaven, whereby we can
be saved, but the name and power of Christ. Therefore let us not depart from
Christ to Moses, to circumcision and other Jewish ceremonies, to seek
salvation by the observation of the law: but as we have begun to fight as
Soldiers under Christ's banner; so let us continue fighting to the end. Let us
never depart from this our Captain. Let not the assaults of Satan, the
allurements of the world, honor, riches, preferment, let not the sweet
pleasures of the flesh carry us away from Christ; but as faithful soldiers
let us continue with Him to the end: If we go from Him, we depart from our
own life, and throw our selves into death and destruction. Therefore let us
tarry with Him: Let us believe this our Prophet, and never depart from Him.

VERSE 13.
NOw as a Sovereigne remedy against infidelity and hardness of heart, he
prescribes a mutual exhortation unto them, that will be as a trumpet singing
in our ears, to keep us out of the sleep of sin.

Call one to another, as Soldiers do in the battle. Still he persisteth in
the same metaphor. As soldiers when they be in the fight and conflict, call
one to another, saying, o be of good cheer, play the men, start not aside,
cleave to your company, be not afraid of enemy, the victory shall be ours: So
we, that be CHRIST's Soldiers, must stir up and provoke one another. Cast
not off your confidence that ye have in CHRIST, let neither Satan, nor any of
his instruments pull you from Christ, the author and finisher of your
salvation; be not faint hearted, but hold out to the end.

This mutual exhortation one of another is amplified three kind of ways: 1.
By the time, when it is to be performed. 2. By the occasion, which is not to be
neglected. 3. By the end, for the which it is worthy to be practiced. The time,
when, is not once or twice, but, daily. 1. We are forgetful of heavenly
matters: therefore we have need to be put in mind of them every day. 2. We are
dull and slow in practice of them, lazy horses that will scarcely go, therefore
we must be put forward with the spur of daily exhortation. As Christ said
concerning the forgiving of our brother, that we must forgive him 77. times:
so it may be affirmed of the exhorting of our brethren, we must exhort them 77.
times: we must be continually exhorting them. Many think if they have called
on their brethren once or twice to pray, to go to Church, etc. they have done
their duty. I have told him of it often, I will speak no more to him of it: I
but thou must exhort him every day. That which is not effected to day, may be
effected to morrow: gutta cavat lapidem, non vi, sed sape cadendo. Therefore
exhort him every day: if thou do no good on him, yet he is left without
excuse, and thy reward is with God.

2 To this duty of exhortation he stirs us up, by the opportunity of the
time, which he wishes us to lay hold of. What is this day? Some interpret it of
the time of the Gospel, which has the name of day, in regard of the great
light that is in it: whereas the time of the Law may be compared to the night
in comparison of it. But I take that to be curious. Others expound this day to
be the whole course of our life, which in respect of the brevity of it is
termed by one Diecula. While our life lasts, which is but short; let us
exhort one another. That is good counsel; yet I take it not to be the direct
meaning of the place. By day he means that gracious time wherein God
stretches forth his arms to us in the ministry of his Word, to call us unto
his Kingdom.

We are to take the opportunity offered to us, and not let it slip: walk,
while ye have the light, while our peace lasts: that we may conveniently go
one to another, while we have the Scripture amongst us, whereby we may learn
how to exhort one another; while GOD speaks unto us by His ambassadors, from
whose mouth we may have instructions for a wise execution of this duty: while
the candle of truth shines among us, let us be careful to exhort one another,
in these peaceable days, in this flourishing time of the Gospel; let this
Christian duty be performed by us all.

3 The third is the danger that will ensue, if exhortation be omitted:
hardness of heart will grow, and so our brethren shall be incureable. The
which hardness of heart is amplified by the efficient cause of it, the
deceitfulness of sin, carrying us like a thief out of the way and leading
us to destruction, that is the nature of the word.

There be many to deceive us. 1. We deceive our selves. Romans 7.11.
James 1. 1 John 1.8. 2. The Devil that sly serpent deceives us. 3. Sin
deceives us: and that she does three kind of ways. 1. by putting on the
visard of virtue. Adultery is but a trick of youth: a sweet sin that may
easily be borne withal: covetousness is but thrift and good husbandry, every
man must have a care of his own estate: swearing is the part of a Gentleman,
of a generous and heroical spirit; they be nice fellows base minded men, that
will not swear, there is no life in them: drunkenness is good fellowship,
they be misers that will not spend a penny in an Alehouse, we mault-men are the
only companions in the world. Thus we are coosened by sin.

2 Sin deceives us by shrouding it self under the coat of Gods mercy. But
let us not be so afraid of sin. God is merciful, he will wincke at such light
sins as these be; we shall never be called into GODS counting house for them:
whereas he is a severe punisher of sin, even in his own children.

3 Sin deceives us by custom in sinning. Many sins at the first we were
afraid to commit, our consciences checked us for them: but in process of time
being inured to them, we commit them without fear or shame. A custom in
sinning makes sin at the length seem to be no sin. The children of the
Lacedaemonians being used to stripes, had no feeling of stripes: and after we
have been used to sin, we have no sense or feeling of sin. Thus especially we
come to be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, our own consciences
feared up with an hot iron. Therefore for the avoiding of this, let us exhort
one an other daily, that the fire and heat of exhortation may cause our hearts
to melt, and so keep us from being hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

Exhortation, if it be used in time, will be as a trumpet to waken our selves
and others out of sin. Saint Paul and Barnabas went from town to town,
exhorting the brethren. Acts 14.22. Exhort one an other, and edify one
another. 1 These. 5.11. have compassion on some, putting difference: and others
save, with fear pulling them out of the fire. Jude, verse 22.23. But alas this
duty is neglected: every one for himself, and God for us all. Am I my brothers
Keeper? I will look to my own soul as well as I can, what have I to do with
my brothers soul? Let not us that be Christians, have such a thought in us.
Let us as the Scripture wills us, exhort one an other daily, labor to
preserve one an other from being hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, and
let us be as Bells to toll one another to the Kingdom of Heaven, that we and
our brethren glorifying CHRIST in this world, may be glorified with Him in the
world to come.

VERSE 14.
THe reason of the Caveat is taken from the common estate and condition of
Christians: which is illustrated by a condition carefully to be observed by
them.

They that are partakers of one Christ, and of one Savior, ought to have a
care of the Salvation one of an other, and labor by the cable-rope of
exhortation to pull one an other out of sin: but we that profess the Gospel
are partakers of one Christ: therefore let us exhort one another, and save one
an others soul.

One member must respect an other. If the foot be ready to fall into a ditch,
the hand must pull it up. We are members of the same body, whereof Christ is
Head; therefore we should keep one an other from the pit of sin. They that be
brethren, that have one Father and Mother, should be jealous of the good estate
one of an other. We are brethren in Christ, he is the elder brother to us all:
therefore let us have a tender care of the salvation one of an other. As we are
partakers of Christ, so let us participate the grace which we receive from
Christ, one to another. They that pass not whether their brethren sink or
swim, go to heaven or to hell, do argue that they have no portion in Christ:
for if they had, the preservation of all Christians would be dear unto them.
Let us exhort one an other daily, because we are partakers of Christ.

Here likewise we behold the singular dignity of Christians: they are
partakers of Christ: they are Christ's partners and fellows. There is a
mutual participation between Christ and us: he partakes with us of flesh and
blood, he takes the load of our sins on his back and bears them for us: and
we partake with him in all his benefits. There is nothing that Christ has, but
we have part of it: his wisdom, holiness, his righteousness is ours; yea
his kingdom is ours. We are heirs, yea coheyres with him of his kingdom. As
the man at the day of marriage says to his Wife, with all my worldly goods I
thee endow: so the Lord Jesus our Husband, that in mercy has married us to
himself, endoweth us with all his goods: by reason whereof being poor of our
selves and worth nothing, we become exceeding rich. Christ is ours, death,
life, the world is ours. O unspeakable prerogative vouchsafed to dust and
ashes. Let us walk worthy of this honor whereunto we are advanced: being
Christ's partners, let us not be the Devils partners. Let us not partake with
the Devil in sin, in blaspheming the name of GOD, contemning of his Word, in
pride, malice and other abominations: but as we be partakers of Christ, so let
us participate of Christ's virtue. Let us be holy as he is holy; humble, as he
is humble: let us contemn this world with all the vain pleasures that be in
it, as he did. What fellowship is there between CHRIST and Belial? If CHRIST
be ours, let not the Devil be ours.

This is good news: we are partakers of CHRIST, therefore we may sleep
soundly on both Ears, we need take thought for nothing? Not so: such a thought
cannot be incident into Christ's partners; for we be partakers of Christ, if we
hold, etc. All interpreters with one consent refer this to faith: and indeed
it is called (...), Hebr. 11.1. the beginning of that lively faith, hope and
confidence, that we have in him, which is as a sure foundation, that cannot be
shaken.

I do not deny, but it is a good sense: yet without any circumloquution or
violence offered to the words, it may fitly be translated, if we hold fast the
beginning of the subsistence and being that we have in him. For Hypostasis most
properly does signify a subsistence, according to the etymology of the word.

If as we have begun by faith to have a being in Christ; so we hold fast this
our being to the end, growing up daily in him, till we come to a perfect age
in Christ Jesus.

Christians must not needlessly doubt of their salvation. Why doubtest thou, o
man of little faith? as Christ has promised to us a kingdom, so he will
undoubtedly perform his promise: for there is not in him a shadow of turning.
We must say with Paul, I am persuaded, neither life nor death shall be able to
separate us from the love of CHRIST.

Yet we must distinguish between faith and presumption. Christians must not set
all at six and seven: be not high minded, but fear. Blessed is the man that
fears always. A Child may fear to displease his father, and yet not doubt
of his fathers love.

As we have begun in Christ so let us continue in him. Ye are they that have
continued with me in my temptations, therefore I appoint to you a kingdom,
Luke 22.28. Be thou faithful to the end. Let us hold fast to the end, the
beginning of our subsistence in CHRIST. Remember Lots Wife: She begun well, but
ended ill. So run, that ye may obtain: run not your selves out of breath
at the first: never leave running till ye have the gole of eternal life. We
have begun in sound and pure Religion, let us not end in profaneness, in
Atheism, in Brownisme and Anabaptisme. Let us hold our beginning fast, and
continue with CHRIST to the end: let neither the sly temptations of Satan, nor
the sweet allurements of the flesh, nor the dangerous baits of the world, nor
the stormy tempest of persecution, if it should arise hereafter, carry us from
CHRIST, but let us hold fast the beginning of our being in him, and remain
firmly engraffed into him to the end.

VERSE 15.
WHy? what is that end, to the which we must hold out? even so long as ye
live, and GOD speaks to you in the Ministry of the Gospel: While it is said:
for that voice spoken to the Israelites appertains to us. So long as the
voice of God sounds to us in the trumpet of the Gospel, let us hold fast
that being that we have in CHRIST: take the time, while the time serves.

VERSE 16.
SO much of the Application of the testimony, of the caveat and the reason,
whereby it is enforced. Now let us come to the commentary and explanation, that
the Apostle makes of it. In this he expounds four branches of the testimony.

1. Who they were, that provoked God to anger. 2. Who they were, with whom God
was angry. 3. Who they were, which by oath were excluded out of his rest. 4.
The cause why they were excluded.
In the latter end of the fifteenth Verse he made mention of the provocation:

First of all he shows who they were, that provoked God.

They that provoked him to anger are described.

1. By the number of them: they were some, not all. 2. By a gracious benefit
contemned by them, namely the word preached: when they heard, that is, Almighty
God speaking to them by his servant Moses.
Whereby we are given to understand, that one of the greatest things that
provokes the wrath of God, is the contempt of his Majesty in the preaching of
the Word. When they heard, they provoked him to anger: therefore take heed how
ye hear: if ye despise the messengers, by whom God speaks, if ye regard not
their word, God will be mightily offended with you.

They made God bitter against them.

Furthermore whereas he says some, not all, it teaches us that the word of God
is never without some fruit: some or other profit by it. The thorny ground,
the stony, the ground by the high way side received not the seed, yet some good
ground received it, and brought forth fruit. When the book of the Law was
read, the hearts of all that heard it, were not hardened. Iosiahs heart melted
at it. The greatest part of the assembly at Athens, the wise and learned
Philosophers mocked at Saint Paul, when he preached Christ, and the
resurrection: yet some believed at his Sermon, as Dionysius: amongst the women
to whom Saint Paul spoke, one Lydia believed. Let this encourage us that be
Christ's Ambassadors: our labor is not altogether fruitless, we shall carry
some sheaves or others into the barn of the Kingdom of heaven. Though many in
a town, where the word is preached, provoke God to anger, they hear, and
regard it not: yet some there be in whom we may rejoice; and though there were
none, yet our reward is with God. A fisherman is to be commended for his
painfulness in his calling, though he get never a fish: So God will reward us
His Spiritual fishermen: though we should not catch one fish in the net of the
Gospel; yet for the most part there be some in the worst town that is, that
profit by the ministry of the Word: these some though they be few, shall be
our crown of rejoicing at the latter day. Again, here we see the estate of
the Church militant: the bad are always mingled with the good, Cockle and
Corn in the field, chafe and wheat in the barn floor. In this house there
be earthen, and golden vessels. In the Church triumphant no unclean thing; all
dogs, enchanters, etc. stand without, and are not admitted in: but in the
militant Church, there be many dogs, profane persons, as Esau was: there is a
Cain, as well as an Abel; a Saul, as a David; an Ishmael, as an Isaac; a Judas,
as a Peter; neither let us be discouraged at it.

It has been so from the beginning, and it shall be so till the day of
judgment, when Christ shall come to purge this floor of his. Moses, whom God
used as his hand to carry them out of Egypt. God will not have those famous
instruments to be buried in silence, whom he has used for our good: the sword
of the Lord and of Gideon. S. Paul thanks Priscilla and Aquila: and here an
honorable mention is made of Moses, though he were dead long ago. We in
England were lead out of the Spiritual Egypt of blindness, superstition and
ignorance by Queen Elizabeth and other good Princes of worthy memory:
therefore let them be remembered still with thankesgiving to GOD.

VERSE 17.
SEcond branch: with whom he was grieved, in the ninth verse, the term of
forty years was annexed to their tempting of God: here the time that God was
displeased with them. But we have showed that this is all one.

They with whom God was grieved, are set forth, 1. By their action. 2. By their
passion. 1. By that which they did. 2. By that which they suffered.

That persisted stubbornely in their sins, and would not be reclaimed from
them. GOD is displeased with none, but with them that sin against Him: He
strikes not as a blind man, every one hand over head, that comes under his
reach; all is fish that comes to his net: he is angry with a godly man, as well
as with an ungodly man. The Sodomites were destroyed: but Lot was saved. Sin
not: and though thou dwell amongst sinners, yet GOD will not power down the
Vialls of His wrath upon thee: the soul that sins shall surely dye.

2 By that, which they suffered. Whose members. The parts put for the whole:
yet the word (members) is very emphaticall. Come into a field where a sore
battle has been fought, and you shall find here a leg, and there an
arm, one member in this place, an other in that, which is lamentable to
behold: So their members were scattered in the wildernsse: some lay in this
place; some in that. They fell: some one way, some another. Some devoured by
wild beasts: some stung to death by Serpents* some the earth swallowed up
quick: some swept away with the pestilence. They all fell in the wilderness
by one death or an other: namely, all the impenitent sinners. It is to be
restreined to them; for Moses and Aaron and sundry others are to be exempted.
Gods wrath was not thus extremely kindled against them. All those that dwelt
in their sins, fell thus in the wilderness.

The consideration of these temporal plagues inflicted on sinners, should
scare us from sin: the water wherewith the old world was drowned; the fire and
brimstome, that consumed the Sodomites; the casting of Iezebel that filthy
strumpet out of a window, and the eating of her by dogs; the hanging of Absalom
by the hair of his head, the fall of the tower of Siloam upon eighteen persons,
and the falling of the carcasses of the Israelites in the wilderness. Though
we fear not hell, because we see it not: yet let us fear the arrows of GODs
wrath which he may shoot at us in this world, and pierce us through. If ye will
not fear him, because he can kill the soul, which is the greatest: yet fear
him, because he has infinite ways to destroy your bodies. He can make the
French Pox to eat up the body of an Whore-monger: He can make the body of an
ominous and malicious person to consume away to the very bones: He can wash
away the flesh of a drunkard: He can give all our bodies, if it please Him, as
food to the fowls of the air: he can make them to lie rotting on the earth,
and not to have the honor of burial, as Iezabel and these in the wilderness,
but make us to be buried, as an Ass is buried, as it fell out to Iehojakim.
Therefore in respect of these bodily punishments at least let us fear God, and
take heed of displeasing him.

VERSE 18.
THE third branch: who they were, that God by an oath excluded out of his rest:
he says not, to whom spoke he? that would not be persuaded by all the heavenly
Rhetorique he used, but still persisted in their sins. He does not say, them,
that heard him not: they gave him not the hearing, as we saw before; but
because they obeyed not, they were shut out of his rest. Obedience is better
then Sacrifice. Hearing is good: to hear many Sermons is a good thing: but to
obey that which we hear, is better. Not every one that says, Lord, Lord, but
he that does the will of my Father, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.
Mat. 7.21. Christ shall come from heaven, to render vengeance to them that
obeyed not the Gospel. 2 These. 1.8. The ancient Israelites were banished out
of Gods rest, because they obeyed not His voice. I was not disobedient, says
Paul, to the heavenly vision. Let us by their example learn to obey God, that
we be not excluded out of His everlasting rest.

VERSE 19.
IN the last place he poynteth out that maine and capital sin, for the which
they were debarred this rest: and he introduces it in Emphaticall terms. In
the Greek, (...), a conjunction copulative, but often it has the force of an
illative, as 1 Cor. 15.21

It is as clear as the noone day, we may behold it with our eyes. Not, that
they would not; it may be they had a mind to enter into that rest, but could
not: why? what barred them out? unbelief. Infidelity is a grievous sin. The
Noble man on whose hand the King leaned, was trodden under foot in the gate,
because he believed not the Word of the Lord. If the Lord would make windows
in heaven, might this thing be? it cost him his life for it. 2 Reg. 7.17.
The ancient Israelites were here excluded out of the Land of Canaan, and many
of them out of the Kingdom of heaven too, because of their unbelief. Can God
give us flesh to eat? can he prepare a table for us in the wilderness? thus
they mooted on Gods power, and called it into question: o the towns of the
Land of Canaan are walled up to heaven: the inhabitants are Giants, we as
Grasshoppers in comparison of them. Can God bring us into this land? for that
cause they entered not into it: therefore let us labor to pluck up this bitter
root of infidelity out of the hearts of us all.

Nevertheless, it is the proper vice of this age, it reigns exceedingly
among the professors of the Gospel: we believe neither Gods threatenings, nor
His promises. God says, whoremongers I will Judge: a point for his judging, we
will be whoremasters still. God resists the proud: yet we will be proud men
still. Every tree that brings not forth good fruit, etc. We read of no hurt
that Dives did to Lazarus: he did not set his dogs on him, nor cudgel him
from his gate, yet because he did no good, he fried in Hell: we will not
believe this: for all that, we will keep that we have to our selves, and do
no good with it. The curse shall not depart from the house of the swearer: yet
we swear still: we laugh in our sleeves at the threatenings of God. And as for
his promises, we believe them not. God has promised us a Kingdom, where,
though we be consumed to dust and ashes, yet we shall rest with Christ for
ever: yet we believe not this. A Bird in the hand is better then two in the
bush. We will not leave our earthly pleasures in hope of this Kingdom. Our
unbelief is in a manner as great as theirs: therefore God may worthily shut us
out of his rest. But let us remove this infidelity out of our hearts. This is
the time of the year that we remoove tenants out of houses: unbelief is a bad
tenant, that will not only pay us no rent, but will also rend Gods Kingdom
from us, has dwelt in the houses of our hearts many years together: let us
now at length give him a remoove, thrust him out of doors: let us believe God
in all his sayings in this life, that we may rest with him in his eternal
Kingdom in the life to come.

CHAP. 4.
IN the former Chapter he excited us to a reverend attention to Christ, the
Doctor and Prophet of the Church, by a fearful example of the wrath of God,
that fell upon the ancient Israelites, for hardening their hearts against his
voice and contemning him: for this cause they were excluded Gods rest.

Now in the beginning of this Chapter he makes a more large and evident
application of that example to us in the time of the Gospel, wishing us not to
tread in the steps of the rebellious Jews, least we drink of the cup of Gods
wrath, as they did.

This Chapter divides it self into two branches.

1. The remainder of Christ his prophecy, to Verse 14.

2. A transition to his priesthood. In the remainder, the former example is
applied to us. In the which application we have, first a dehortation from
incredulity, which was the bar that kept them out of God's rest, to Verse
11. 2. An exhortation to a diligent study to enter into that rest. Touching
the former, 1. A propounding of the dehortation. 2. A preventing of an
objection, that might be made against it. In the propounding of it, 1. The
substance of it. 2. A reason whereby it is strengthened.

The substance of it is comprehended, Ver. 1.

VERSE 1.
SEeing we have such a terrible example of Gods wrath in the ancient
Israelites, which for their unbelief and contumacie were shut out of Gods
rest: let us being subject to the like frailety, and as little able of our
selves to stand as they, let us fear that we fall not as they did.

What is it; that we must fear?

Least any of us should seem to come short of his rest: for there is no time
to sin, and go to hell, in our youth or elder age.

How? lest the promise being left, cast behind our back and not regarded: the
cause of infidelity is a careless neglect of God his promise.

Where read we of any promise made of entering into his rest? we read of a
commination or threatening, that some should not enter into it: but in the
former testimony there was contained no promise. True: not directly, yet
indirectly and by necessary consequent: for if God swear that they should not
enter, which disobeyed him, then a secret promise was included, that the
faithful and obedient should enter in: therefore let us fear, least forsaking
this promise, of entering into his rest, etc.

Any of you. For I love you all, and would be loath that one of you should
perish.

Seem: not simply say, be deprived. Some think the Apostle so speaks, that
he might not exasperate the Jews: which would have taken it in great snuff.
Therefore he says, if any seem -- but that word may have his force. Seem,
and that worthily, even in the judgment of all the world, by neglecting so
great salvation to be deprived.

To come short. The word is very significant. To be left behind. If among them
that travel by the way, some being weary of the length and tediousness of the
journey, slack their pace, sit down and will make no have, the rest enter
into the town or City to the which they travel, but they are left behind. So
if we go not on cheerfully in the way, following God calling us, that leads
us to the celestial Canaan, we shall be left behind and not enter in, we shall
come tardie, as the five foolish Virgins did: as fainting and loitering
travelers are wont to do, and so never come to the journeys end: therefore
let us look to it, the danger is great.

In the substance of the dehortation is commended to us an holy and religious
fear, which we must carry in our hands, for fear of falling. This fear is
amplified by the object whereabout it must be occupied, and the danger that
will ensue, if we let go that fear.

Must we that be Christians fear? It may seem not, Luke 1.74. Romans 8.15.

For the determination of this ye must know, that there is a four fold fear:
mundanus, servilis, initialis, and filialis. This filial fear is not a
boisterous wind to shake the pillar of the certeinty of the Salvation of Gods
Children, which in respect of God our Salvation is sure: our life is hid with
God in CHRIST, Col. 3.3. yet in regard of our own weakness and frailety, we
must fear all the days of our life. Though a Soldier make sure of the
victory, yet he must not rush into the battle unarmed, nor be careless of
himself, he must fear the Pikes, Swords and Pellets of the enemy, and be
careful to avoyde them. Though a wayfaring man make sure to come home safe to
his house, yet he must not be reachlesse, but fear in some sort the thieves
that be in the way. They that be on the Sea, though they make no question of
their safe arrival, yet they must not give themselves to sleeping and playing,
let the ship drive whither it will; they must fear the waves, winds and
tempests. A kind and loving Wife doubts not of the good affection of her
husband: yet she will fear him. So we need not doubt of Gods love: he will
do his part: Ephesians. 5. ult.
for whom He once loves, he loves to the end; yet we must fear him.

There be two dangerous rocks, the one of doubt and despair: the other of
security and presumption. Though there is no reason to despair, Romans 11.29.
John 10.28. Heb. 6. yet we must beware that we be not drowned in security, not
give our selves to eating and drinking. I am sure I shall be saved, therefore I
care not how I live. Christians must fear; in regard of our own weakness,
we must distrust our own wit, policy, strength, and depend upon God alone, we
may stand a great while, and yet fall in the end, as Adam, Noah, David,
Solomon, Peter. In our selves we are as weak as water: therefore let us
distrust our selves, and put all our trust in the living God. Again, we must
fear in respect of the strength and policy of our enemies. We have many
enemies to encounter withal, and those not weak, but potent. We wrestle not
with flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against the rulers
of the darkness of this world: Ephesians. 6.12.
The Devil like a roaring Lion walks up and down seeking whom he may
devour. 1 Pet. 5.8. therefore we must fear.

VERSE 2.
THE reason is deduced from a gracious benefit bestowed on us, as well as on
them, which if it be rejected by us, as it was by them, will shut us out of
heaven. It has two parts, a par, and an impar. If they for not believing the
Gospel were banished out of his rest, then the like may happen to us: for we
are partakers of the Gospel as well as they: and for that cause let us fear.

1 That is to be unfolded wherein they and we are alike. We are Gospelled as
well as they: nay in that we are advanced above them. Adam, Abraham, Jacob,
had the Gospel velatum: to us it is revelatum. To them CHRIST was preached
afar off, to come, to us already come, a Virgin has conceived. They had the
Gospel by a servant which was Moses: we have it by the Son of God: they had
it darkely and obscurely: we have it clearly and plainly. They had the Moon
light, and we the Sun light. Blessed are the eyes that see that which we see.
It was one and the same Gospel in the Old and New Testament: John 5.46. and
39. here is the imparity; the Word preached did not profit them, as it did us
that believe.

The word of hearing. That word, which indeed above all other words is to be
heard, by the which faith comes. Romans 10.17 Plato, Aristot. Seneca, Tullie,
Augustine, Hieron. Irenaeus, Tertul. etc. in time and place are to be heard:
but this word above all. This is a word meet to sound in our ears continually.

He does not say, which came not unto them, for it was preached to them: as we
heard before.

Profited them not, did them no good. The Gospel is a precious pearl, an
unspeakeable blessing of God, yet all that are partakers of it are not saved.
Judas had the Gospel, yet it profited him not. Simon Magus, Jerusalem, etc.
The Sun is not comfortable to all. The most delicate fare does not make all
bodies fat. The rain does not make all grounds fruitful, neither does the
Word of God, though it be mighty in operation, profit all that partake of it.
Luke 13.26. Mat. 8.12. nay, it is the heaping up of a greater measure of
condemnation to some through their own default: Ioh. 15.22. Ioh. 9. ult.
Therefore let us not trust to lying words, as they did, crying, the temple of
the Lord, the temple of the Lord: neither let us cry, the Gospel, the Gospel,
Ier. 7.4.
and thrust our selves under the fig leaves of a bare profession of it, but
bring forth fruits worthy of the Gospel, that it be not taken from us and
given to another nation.

Why did the Gospel do them no good?

Because it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it. It is a metaphor
borrowed from liquid things. A physician prescribes to a man a cup of strong
wine, but he wills him to mingle it with Sugar, lest it fume into his brain
and make him sick: if he mingle it not, and temper it well with Sugar, he hurts
himself. So because they mingled not the wine of the word with the sweet Sugar
of faith; it was their destruction, it turned them over even into hell.

It is faith that makes the word profitable. For the procuring of an harvest,
it is not enough to have ground, and seed cast into the ground, but rain must
fall from heaven and be mingled with the ground: So it is not sufficient to
bring our selves as the ground to a Sermon, to have, the immortal seed of the
word sown in our hearts by GODS husbandmen, but there must be the drops of
faith mingled with this seed to make it fruitful. Genesis 19.14.
Noah preached to the old world, yet they did not believe; Lot to his Sons in
Law, but he seemed to them as a mocker: CHRIST to the Pharisees, but they
derided him, Luke 16.14. Let not us do so: but rather tremble at the
threatenings, believe the promises, and practice that which we hear. And this
faith will appear by working, 1 These. 2.13. it will work a change and
alteration in your whole man.

VERSE 3.
ON the other side, it profits us that believe, for we enter into his rest.

He does not say shall, but do. He that believes in me, has eternal life,
he does not see it a far off, as Moses upon the top of Pisgah, viewed the
earthly Canaan, but enters: not, into the boiling lead of Purgatory, but into
spiritual and everlasting rest.

As infidelity is the bar to keep out unbeleevers: So fidelity is the gate or
door whereby we may enter into heaven, Act. 16.31. Romans 3.28.

This may seem to be unfitly alleged. By consequent it prooves that
believers enter in: for if unbelievers do not, then by the law of contraries,
believers do.

And if the former words be included in a parenthesis, these do fitly follow
as a confirmation of that, which was in the latter end of the former verse, it
profited them not, because it was not mingled with faith. How prove you that?
As he said, etc. thus it does excellently well agree.

Hitherto the dehortation has been propounded. Now he comes to prevent an
objection, that the Jews might make, which was indeed the only shelter they
had to fly unto. This rest that David speaks of is the land of Canaan, which
some of our fathers missed of, because they would not believe God. What is that
to us? We believe in him, and are at this day of a long time seated in the land
of Canaan, therefore we are none of those unbelievers: thou need not to be
so fearful of us.

To that he answers, nay: this rest is a spiritual and an heavenly rest: and
that he prooves by two divine testimonies; one out of Genesis, about Gods
Sabbath: the other out of the Psalm before cited.

The rest of that Sabbath he introduces by a narration of the cause, why God
kept it. It is perobscurus locus, as Beza well observes, a defective speech,
something must be supplied.

And verily, (...). It is particula asseverantis, as well as adversantis, the
works being finished from the foundation of the world; this rest, that we
speak of, was fore-signified.

Here we may behold the end, for the which God Himself kept a Sabbath; namely
that we might perpetually commemorate the Creation of the world. The Lord
might, if it had pleased Him, have made the world in a moment: yet he took six
days to the making of it, that we might deliberately consider of his
wonderful workmanship: and then rested the seventh day, making it a type of
our eternal rest with him in heaven.

But here a question may be moved, whether all Gods works were finished at the
beginning of the world, whether all were made within the compass of these six
days, or not.

1. What say you to the souls of men? Is there not a daily creation of them?
they come not ex traduce, they are not traduced and conveyed unto us by the
seed of our Parents: for they are only the fathers of our bodies, not of our
souls: and the spirit returns to God that gave it: God makes souls every
day: Hebr. 12.9.
therefore all his works were not finished from the foundation of the world.

The answer is easy. They were in specie, from the beginning, though numero
they be augmented every day. They were not all created at the first in heaven,
and put daily into bodies according unto Gods discretion and appointment; but
God makes them continually: yet the same species, the same kind of creature
was from the beginning.

2. What shall we say to Mules? It was a long time, many hundred years before
they came into the world, Genesis 36.24.

1. The Hebr. word is ambiguous: ( Iemim) of ( Iam) the Sea. He found waters,
standing pooles in the wilderness like to Seas, above the expectation of men.

2. Let it be translated (Mules;) yet the meaning may be, he was the first
that found them in that country, whereas they might be in the world before.

3. Though they were invented by this man, yet the matter of them was made by
God in the beginning.

Thirdly, what shall we say to those creatures that rise of putrefaction? they
were materialiter and potentialiter, though not actualiter from the beginning.
All things were either in materia or in specie from the beginning of the world.
There were no houses, no ships, no Towns, nor Cities at the first: yet the
matter whereof they be framed, was prepared to man's hand by God, and he gave
man wisdom for the framing of them.

VERSE 4.
HOw does that appear? For He, that is, God.

He is not curious in the naming of the place, it was well known to the
Hebrews, being daily exercised in the Scriptures.

Now by that was prefigured that rest, when we shall rest with God in his
kingdom. As God for our capacity labored in the creation of the world, rested
afterward, delighting himself in the contemplation of the works that he had
made: So when this life is ended, we shall rest from all our labors, and enjoy
eternal quietness with him. Therefore, this shows that it is not a carnal
but a spiritual; not a temporal, but an eternal rest, that is here entreated
of.

John 5.17.
Did God rest from all his works? How is it then that our Savior says, my
father works hitherto?

There be the works of preservation and of creation. The high and eternal God
is not idle, since he made the world. His eyes are over all the ends of it,
beholding the evil and the good. He is the Rector of the University of the
whole world, nothing comes to pass without him. A Sparrow falls not to the
ground without his will. He disposes still of all things, and does whatsoever
he will in heaven and earth, and in all deep places: but as for the works of
creation, he has rested from them all: nothing now is created new.

Then all things throughout the wide compass of the world, are the workmanship
of God. He spread the heavens above our heads as a Curtain, he laid the
foundation of the earth, he made the roaring sea; the birds that fly in the
air, the beasts that walk on the earth, the fish that play in the Sea, the
Angels in heaven, and men on the earth are his creatures.

Psalm. 139.14.
O how wonderfully am I made! says the Psalmist. Therefore let us all glorify
our Creator, in whom we have our life, breath, being and moving. We especially
that are Lords over GODS creatures, let us magnify him above them all.
Nevertheless, (a lamentable thing to consider) we dishonor him above all: the
Birds of the air, the Beasts of the field, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, are
more dutiful in their kind than we be. O the unthankfulness of sinful Man!

This place again, which we have in hand, does intimate so much unto us.

VERSE 6.
WHich he proves first by the event, verse 6.

Some must enter in because of Gods promise, 2 Cor. 1.20.

From the testimony cited in the former verse he reasons in this. They did not
enter, therefore some others shall: for Gods promise shall take effect, and not
fall to the ground. If a man having prepared a sumptuous dinner, shall say, if
these dine with me, then never trust me again, thereby we may safely collect,
that there be others that dine with him. Has he said it, and shall he not do
it? They that shall not enter into this rest, are described by a prerogative
vouchsafed to them, and by the contempt of that prerogative.

The Prerogative has two branches: the 1. is the preaching and manifesting of
this rest to them: 2. is the order of time, in respect whereof they were
preferred before others. They were the first that had this glad tidings of
peace offered to them, yet they were stubborn, froward, and disobedient: they
would not believe GOD and his promise: for that cause they never sat a foot
into that rest.

Yet some there be that shall take possession of it: namely, they that believe
in God: heaven and earth shall pass away, but not one jot of Gods word shall
be unfulfilled. Though diverse regard it not, and think it to be but a fools
Paradise, yet undoubtedly some shall have it.

There be first, that shall be last, says CHRIST. Many may have this
privilege, to have the Gospel first preached to them, and yet not be saved by
the Gospel. Christ gave commandment, that his Apostles should begin their
preaching at Jerusalem. Luke 24.47. Act. 13.46.
The Gospel is the power of God to salvation, to the Jew first -- Yet easier
for Tyrus and Sydon at the day of judgment, then for many of them.

We in England in this last age of this world have had the Gospel again
revealed unto us, before a number of places in the world, we even in these
parts have had it a long time in most plentiful measure above and before
sundry places in the land, yet let us not flatter our selves in that. Some of
them that be still in darkness, may go to heaven before us. Howsoever they
that have the first offer, (which is a singular privilege) regard it not, yet
some out of all question shall have it. Many come from the east; and from the
West, and shall set down with Abraham, Isack and Jacob in the kingdom of
heaven, and the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
darkness, Matthew. 8.11.12.

Those that were first bidden to the marriage, would not come, they made
excuses: yet the Lord sent into the high ways and hedges, and his house at the
length was filled. God is not tied to any. If the first refuse, the last shall
have it: therefore while this rest is preached to us, let us take hold of it,
and not reject it; as the ancient Israelites did.

VERSE 7.
2. HE proves it by the circumstance of time. For David spoke this a long time
after they were settled in the land of Canaan by Joshua, even four hundred
years after: therefore he must needs mean another rest then the land of
Canaan.

In David: (...) is here put for (...), as Hebr. 1.1, 2.

Not that voice, that spoke in the wilderness, but which sounds now in the
preaching of the Gospel. Christ speaks to us at this present day: he that
hears you, hears me. Luke 10.16. 2 Cor. 5.20.
As if God did beseech you through us. Therefore let us take heed that we
harden not our hearts against him.

VERSE 8.
Joshua which was a type of CHRIST, has the same name with our Savior CHRIST:
yet in a diverse manner. Joshua was a Savior for them in temporal things;
CHRIST in spiritual and eternal things: he saved them from the Canaanites,
earthly enemies: CHRIST from sin, death, hell and Satan, spiritual enemies.
He gave them a land flowing with milk and honey in this world: CHRIST gives us
an everlasting habitation, a celestial paradise in the world to come.

If Joshua had given them this rest, then would not the Holy Ghost have spoken
of another.

VERSE 9.
WHereupon he infers the conclusion. 1. Introduced, then confirmed, Verse
10.

There remains therefore, By necessary consequence, by the force and strength
of reasoning.

A rest: besides the land of Canaan wherein ye now rest.

In this place he reteineth the Hebrew word. There remains a sabbatizing, a
keeping. of a Sabbath in heaven: for whom? not for the people of the Devil,
but of GOD, an holy nation, a people zealous of good works.

Many Atheists make a mock at the kingdom of heaven. The Preachers talk much
of a glorious and wealthy kingdom, which we shall have after this life; but
God send us wealth, peace, joy and pleasure in this world: let them look for
that kingdom.

I but there remains a rest, a Sabbath, where we shall never be molested any
more.

For whom does it remain? and who be this people of God? All nations in the
world are his people by Creation, but these be his people by adoption: whom
he has adopted in his Son Christ Jesus, whom he has constituted a Prince
and ruler over this people. Rebels and traitors are not the Kings people: they
be the kings people that obey the Kings laws.

1. Every people is gathered together by some means or other: a people is a
collection of many men. So we that are the people of God, are gathered together
with the trumpet of the word.

2. A people gathered together must have laws to rule them by, otherwise they
will soon be out of order: leges a ligando, because they are the bond that
ties the people together; otherwise they will range beyond limits: even so Gods
people have Gods laws set down in his word.

3 Every people must have a King or ruler, which is lex loquens: even so the
Ruler of Gods people is Jesus Christ, they that will not have him to rule over
them, are none of Gods people.

4 A people must have some Country to dwell in, some in Denmark, some in
France, etc. So the Country where this people dwell is the Church militant in
this life, and triumphant in the life to come.

5 All people are distinguished by some outward habit and attire. French men
go not as English men. Spaniards go otherwise then Turks, etc. So GODS
people have the Sacraments to distinguish them: Baptism which is Christ's
mark, and the Supper which is his Seal.

6 People must live in obedience to the laws of their King. Traitors and
rebels are not the Kings liege and loyal people. So we that be GODS people,
must live obediently to Gods laws. If we be abominable swearers that rend GODS
name in pieces, contemners of his word, if we be beastly drunkards, and
impure adulterers and adulteresses, if we wallow in the mire of all sin, we
are none of GODS people, neither can we have any assurance of this rest:
therefore let us show our selves by our works to be GODS people in this life,
that we may have this rest in the life to come.

VERSE 10.
ALL interpreters with one consent expound this of all the faithful: for he
that believes in Christ has eternal life, he is already in this rest: from
all his works wherein he was occupied and busied in this life, as God did
from all his works of Creation after he made the world.

I will not deny, but that this is the scope of the place, yet not the direct
meaning and exposition of it. 1. The illative conjunction argues that this is a
reason for the confirmation of the former conclusion, which this does not. 2.
In some greek copies there is the pronoune (...), poynting out some particular
man: therefore it is better to expound it first and principally of our Savior
Christ, then secondarily of all true Christians.

He, that is, Jesus Christ, our true Joshua, that conducteth us into the
Celestial Canaan, as he did the Israelites into the earthly. He that is now
entered into his rest, from his hungring and thirsting, from his working in the
trade of his supposed father, from his traveling up and down, from town to
town in the preaching of the Gospel, from his sweating of blood, from the
pains that he sustained on the Cross; he has ceased from all these works,
as God did from his: and where the body is, thither shall the Eagles be
gathered: where the husband is, there shall the wife be: where the head is,
there shall the members be. Christ his entrance into this rest is a certain
pledge of our entrance into it.

The name of rest is cheerful to us all, especially to those that have
traveled sore all the day long. Al men desire to live in rest. Hence it is
that the Kingdom of Heaven is set forth to us by it. Blessed are the dead
which dye in the Lord, Apoc. 14.13.
for they rest from their labors. And we say among our selves, when a man is
dead, he is at rest. O sweet and comfortable rest! The tongue of Men and Angels
is not able sufficiently to express it.

1 We shall rest from the labors of our calling, wherewith we are turmoiled.
The Husbandman shall follow the Plough no longer; the Weaver shall sit no
longer in the cold in his Loome: the Clothier not ride up and down, in the
rain, frost, and snow, about his wool, and cloth: the Preacher shall no
longer be turning over books, and taking pains in his study and pulpit: we
shall ride no more to market to buy corn, to make provision for our houses: we
shall no longer take thought for our selves, our wives and children: we shall
have all things provided to our hands, and eat of the hidden Manna, and of the
Tree of Life in the Paradise of God for ever.

2 We shall rest even from the works of Religion, which are now Charrets to
carry us to Heaven. We shall no longer be turning over the Bible in our Houses,
catechizing and instructing of our Families; no more go many a mile in the dirt
and wind to the Church, shall no more be praying with cries, sighs, and tears:
thanksgiving shall remain in Heaven. It shall be all our work to be praising
of God: but petitions shall then cease: no need of the Ship, when we be in the
Haven.

3 We shall rest from the works of sin: here in many things we sin all. Noah
is sometime overtaken with wine, David falls into adultery and murder, Peter
into the denial of Christ, Paul and Barnabas are at jarres between
themselves. The good that we would do, that do we not, and the evil we would
not, that do we. Sin makes us to cry out like tired Porters, O miserable men
that we are, etc. Then we shall rest from all sin, and be like the Angels in
Heaven for ever.

4 We shall rest from all the crosses and calamities of this life. There shall
be no banishment, no imprisonment, no hunger nor thirst, neither any leading
in captivity, or complaining in the streets, no sword of the enemy to fear, no
railing and slandrous tongues to grieve us, no discontents in our children and
servants, no sicknesses, diseases, nor head-atch, tooth-atch, agues, dropsies,
gowts, etc. All ease in all parts and members of the body, all joy and comfort
in our souls. Then the Devil, that roaring Lion, that walks about
continually seeking how to devour us, shall be utterly cast out, he shall have
nothing to do with us any more.

5 We shall rest from death. It is a work to dye: it is a maine enemy with
whom we struggle. But then this last enemy shall be put under our feet, 1 Cor.
15.
death shall be swallowed up into victory. O what an excellent rest is this?
This world is like Noah's Dove, which could find no rest to the sole of her
foot, Genesis 8.9. It may be we may have here a rest for a time, a man may be free
from sickness a year or two: but there we shall have rest for ever. Here is
some wormwood in our sweetest honey, some coliquintida in the pot of our
mirth: but there shall be joy without sorrow, happiness without misery. Let us
all long after this rest: let us not only wish with Balaam, that we had it; but
let us take the way that leads to it, and that is a straight and narrow way.
The broad way of pleasure and delight leads us to hell, where the rich man lay
in infinite torments.

The narrow way that leads to rest, where Lazarus is in Abraham's bosom. Let
us therefore mortify sin, subdue our stubborn lusts and rebellious
affections; let us if need be, suffer afflictions for the name of Christ, that
we may one day enter into this rest, where all tears shall be wiped from our
eyes for ever.

Now he stirs us up to take a course for the obtaining of that rest. It is a
folly to know that there is a fine and delicate Country, unless we our selves
may go into that Country. So it is to small purpose to know, that there is an
Heaven, unless we may be partakers of it.

Where 1. A commendation of an heavenly study to us. 2. Certain spurs to prick
us forward to this study. The spurs, are three strong and forcible arguments.
1. Is taken from a fearful example. 2. From the Ladder whereby we climb up
to this rest, which is the Word of God. 3. From the omniscience of God, that
sees whether we study it aright or not.

VERSE 11.
THE study is commended to us in these words.

He does not say, go to heaven, think on this rest now and then, at leisure
talk of it: but let us study, labor, etc.

He does not say, study ye, but us. S. Paul himself must be a Student in this
business.

Not loiter, but study and labor: not to take a view of this rest, but to
enter.

Not simply say, into any rest, but, into that rest, that noble, worthy,
famous, and renowned rest, spoken of before, where we shall rest with God, his
Angels and Saints for ever. There be rests in this world; many soft pillowes,
feather-beds, and beds of dowlne to rest our selves upon: many pleasant
Orchards, and Gardens, fair and beautiful houses, wherein we may rest; but
nothing comparable to that rest, the bosom of Abraham, where the soul of
Lazarus rests

We must not think to go to heaven without study, bare wishing will not serve
the turn. It is not enough to say with Baalam, O that my soul might dye the
death of the righteous, and my last end be like his, Number. 23.10. We must first
study to live the life of the righteous. It is not sufficient to say, oh that
I were in heaven, but we must study to go to heaven. Now in all studying these
things must concur.

1 There must be the party that studieth, and that is every Christian: high and
low, rich and poor, of what estate or condition so ever. The King and the
subject, the Ministers and their people, the Master and the servant, the Father
and the child, the Husband and the Wife, the Merchant and the clothyer, the
Gentleman and the Yeoman, the Divines, Lawyers, Physicians, Husbandmen, etc.
all must study to enter into this rest.

2 There must be a closet, or a place to study in, that is, the chamber of our
own hearts. Matthew. 6.6.
Enter into thy closet, says. CHRIST. We must go often into the chamber of
our own hearts, call our selves to an account, examine what sins we have,
what courses we take, whether we be in regia via or not, that leads to
heaven.

3 There must be a book to study on: every Student must have his books.
There can be no workman without his tools: nor no Scholar without a library.
Now the LORD will not trouble us with many books: as CHRIST said, one thing is
necessary: So one book is necessary, the book of books, the sacred book of
holy Scriptures. Let us study that thoroughly, and learn the way to heaven.

4 There must be a light to study by: no man can study in the dark; either he
must have day light, or candle light. The light whereby we study is the light
of GODS Spirit, who must enlighten our eyes, that we may see the wonders of
GODS Laws, and direct us to this heavenly rest. Let us therefore pray to GOD,
that His Spirit may be with us in all our study: as Acts 8.31. Lord take not
thy Holy Spirit from me: let him accompany me continually.

5 There must be diligence in study: every Student must be diligent. Learning
is not gotten without pains. The students in the University study day and
night: So do the Lawyers at Innes of Court, if they aspire to any fame in the
Law. So we that be Christians, must be diligent and painful in our study, 2
Pet. 1.10. use all diligence.

We must not study by fits, a start and away, but we must lie at it, if by any
means we may come to this rest.

6 There must be a time to study in. Now this time is the term of our life:
from infancy to old age, from the cradle to the grave, so far as is possible.
Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth. Wherewithal shall a young man
cleanse his ways? Eccles. 12.1.
Psalm. 119.9. A young man said of the ten Commandments, all these have I
kept from my youth upwards, Mark. 10. Young men may die in the flower of their
years, as Absalom did: therefore let young men even in the flourishing time of
youth study to enter into this rest.

And let old men likewise study it. In matters concerning the world there be
emeriti milites: a man at sixty years of age is exempted from warfare:
aptissima arma senectutis, arts exercitationesque virtutum.

The Levits were privileged from the service of the Temple at fifty, and some
Scholars are so old, that they can study no longer: not so here, we must all
study so long as we live, yea in the time of old age: hic opus est animo
magis, quam corpore: (...). Cato learned Greek when he was eighty years old:
(...). Solon. So though we be fifty, sixty, eighty, a hundred years old, yet
we must always be studying to enter into this rest.

And it is worth our study.

1. We shall rest from sin: here we sin daily, the best of us all: the just
man falls seven times a day. Sin makes the godly to cry out, like tired
porters, o miserable men that we are, who shall ease us of this burden? Then we
shall be like the Angels in heaven, and sin no more.

2. We shall rest from the works of our calling. The Merchant shall be no
more tossed upon the Sea: the clothier be no more riding up and down for
Wool, nor in the sale of clothes. The magistrate shall be no longer molested
with hearing of causes from morning to night, as Moses was. The Father no more
caring for his Children, etc. we shall have all things without care and labor.
O happy rest! let us study for it.

3. We shall rest from all grief, pain and misery. No more sickness, crying
and weeping: all tears shall then be wiped from our eyes. Oh blessed rest!
who would not study for it? Notwithstanding it is a wonder to see, how this
study is neglected. We study to get money, to hoord up gold and silver, to buy
houses and purchase lands. Some will study to get to great preferment; how to
climb to this or that office; but the maine study of all is set aside.

What advantageth it a man to win the whole world and loose his own soul?
therefore especially study to enter into this rest, where our souls and bodies
shall remain in happiness for ever. One Pamb. was studying the first Verse of
the thirty ninth Psalm. 19. years, and yet studied it not enough. We must be
studying this lesson, to enter into this blessed rest, the term of our whole
life, and yet all little enough: we must study, as they that fear to be
deprived of a thing, Verse 1. If you are afraid to be deprived of your house
and land by some false pretended title, you will study hard to defend your
selves: even so do you study for heaven; that ye be not defeated of this rest.

Let us study earnestly to enter into his rest, that when the few and evil
days of our Pilgrimage be ended, we may rest with Christ in the world to
come. (...), says Chrysostom. and without, we cannot be saved: yet that alone is
not sufficient, (...). If they could not get earth without much diligence, how
shall we heaven? Especially (...), indifferenter ac socorditer.

1. Reason or spur to prick us on to this heavenly and earnest study and
meditation, is taken from a terrible example: as good men as we in outward
appearance have fallen from this rest; therefore let us take heed that the
like happen not to us.

If you fall, as they did, you shall sink into the same bottomless pit, that
they have done: pares in peccato shall be pares in supplicio. Why should God
spare us more than them? We are his people: So they. We sit in the lap of the
Church: So they. We have the preaching of the Gospel: So they, Verse 2. We the
Sacraments: So they. They were baptized in the red Sea, they eat of the same
spiritual meat and they did all drink the same spiritual drink, 1 Cor.
10.34. Therefore if we be guilty of the like sin, we must look for the like
punishment.

The ancient Israelites went very far toward the land of Canaan. In many
things obedient to the voice of God, they journyed and stayed at his
appointment; they had sent spies that viewed the Country. No doubt, many of
them were in fight of it, they were on the borders, setting a foot on it, yet
because they were incredulous, stubborn, rebellious, and disobedient to God,
they were destroyed in the wilderness, and so came short of that rest: both of
the land of Canaan, the figure of this rest, and some of them, it is to be
feared, of heaven too prefigured by it: they came, says Saint Chrysostom. (...):
and there, (...). Let us therefore take heed it be not so with us. Would it
not grieve you that be Merchants to see a ship fraught with rich merchandise
miscarry in the haven? Alas, has it passed the raging waves, blustering
winds, terrible tempests, so many miles on the Sea, and is it cast away in the
haven? what a pitiful thing is this? So we may begin well, go out of Sodom
with Lots wife, follow God a great while, as they did in the wilderness, some
ten, twenty, thirty or forty years, yet be banished out of the kingdom
of heaven. Therefore let us not flatter our selves in our fair beginnings, but
let us run the ways of Gods Commandments to the end: forget the things that
are behind, but press on to the mark that is before: though as old disciples
as Mnason, yet let us study this to our dying day, how to enter into this rest.

It is something to begin well, to go toward heaven; but that is not all.
Lots wife went out of Sodom, Demas once embraced Christ.

If thou go to London, you will not stay at Romford, but go till thou
come to that famous city. Therefore let us all look to our selves: as we have
begun, so let us proceed, and never cease to our dying day. Phil. 3.13.
I forget the things that are behind and follow hard to the mark. Let us not
stand bragging what we have been, what we have done, how many miles we have
gone toward heaven: but let us run the ways of GODS Commandments to the
end, as David. Those that are travellours are subject to falling: you are
traveling to the heavenly Jerusalem; therefore be not secure, but take pains
in the rowing of the ship of your souls to the haven of eternal rest.

(...), into the same example. Vivitur legibus, non exemplis, all examples are
not to be followed, Phil. 3.17. There be exempla imitabilia, and declinabilia.
If any good examples be set before your eyes, follow them: The faith of
Abraham, the uprightness of Noah, the sincerity of David, the patience of Job,
the constancy of Paul, the humility of the blessed Virgin Mary, etc. But if bad
examples, follow not them: follow not Noah in his drunkenness, David in his
adultery and murder, Peter in his denial, nor the Israelites in their
obstinacy and disobedience to GOD in the Wilderness, for the which they were
excluded out of the land of rest. Away with those naughty examples of Lots
Wife, Absalom, Iesabel, Ananias and Saphira, etc. Come out says God, of
Babylon. Let us not follow the wicked in their wickedness, least we follow
them to hell. Let us believe God and his Word, let us walk in an holy
obedience to all his Commandments: then believing in Christ and bringing forth
the fruits of a true and lively faith, when the reprobate shall be in hell
with the rich glutton, wishing for a drop of water to cool their tongues; we
shall be in Abraham's bosom, and rest from all sorrow for evermore.

VERSE 12.
THe second reason to excite us to this study is taken from the power and
Majesty of the Word, that commands this lesson to be studied. As it was to
be to the ancient Israelites: So is it to us. God often moved them by Moses,
Joshua and Caleb, and others, to march on valiantly in the wilderness; as sure
as God is in heaven ye shall have the promised land: but they contemned this
Word, Number. 14. Therefore they were destroyed. So will GOD deal with us: for
his Word is as mighty now as ever it was. This is that study which God in his
Word enjoined to you, and has often excited you thereunto: beware how ye
contemn this Word. It is no dallying with edge tools: this sword of the
Spirit is sharper than any two edged sword, and will either open the soars of
your souls, that they may be healed, or, it will wound you to death
everlasting: therefore despise it not, but as God commanded you in his Word, so
study to enter into his rest.

1. The nature of the Word is set down: then illustrated and confirmed. For
the nature, it has two qualities.

Many things are lively, that are not mighty. There is life in a little child,
but no great might in him: the Word is not so. As it is lively, so it is
mighty. The Word of God is not a dead Word, it has life in it. There is some
wine and drink that is dead, we can feel no life in it, as it goes down our
stomach: the Word of God is lively Aqua-vita, and no auditour but shall feel
it to be lively in him, either to salvation or destruction. They are called
lively Oracles by St. Stephen, Act. 7.38. There is life in it, it begets us to
a Spiritual life in this world, and to an eternal in the world to come.

It is also a mighty or powerful Word, Jerome translates it evidens, as if he
read it (...): whereas it is (...) mighty. There are sundry potions that be
mighty in operation; purge mightily, and carry away a great deal of corruption
out of the body: but none so as the word of God; it purges us from Idolatry,
ignorance, superstition, profaneness, from swearing, cursing, and banning,
from drunkenness, fornication, and adultery, etc. It is a mighty purger, and
sweepes a great deal of filthiness out of the soul, and if it purge thee
not, it will kill thee; as a medicine, if not work upwards or downwards, it
will kill the man; so the Word will mightily cleanse thee, or mightily confound
thee.

These qualities are confirmed. 1. Comparatively; then simply, by the effects
thereof.

Now he sets forth the power of it comparatively.

It is sharper. Of a more cutting nature: not then a blunt sword, but a sharp;
not with one edge, but two, which pierces more speedily and thoroughly: with
two mouths. The edge of a sword is as a mouth that biteth, Isai. 49.2. Ephesians.
6.17. Apoc. 1.16. it is said to have two edges in respect of the two
testaments. Aug. de civ. Dei. Not sharper then some, but any. Let all the
swords in the world be put together, and they are nothing to this.

Piercing: as water and oil: to the dividing asunder: bearing down all that
is in the way, as a flood does. Of soul and spirit, that is, of the inferior
and superior part of the mind, the affections and understanding, Isai. 26.9.
1 These. 5.23.

And of the joints and marrow. Some Greek copies have (...), of all the
members of the body. Nothing so firmly compacted and united together, as
joints; so hard, as bones; so deep, as the marrow, that lies hid in the
bones, but it passes through all.

1 Samuel 21.9.
Goliah's sword not like to this. David said of that, none to it: but none to
this; LORD give it to us. This sword can hew in pieces the most stony,
flintie, and rockie heart in the world; to see what blindness in the
understanding, what frowardness in the affections: it will lay the heart open,
and bewray the secret filthiness, and all the sluttish corners of sin that
be in it. When the Preacher is a speaking, the word does so pierce the hearts of
the hearers, as that many in the Church imagine, that the Preacher is
acquainted with their sins. What does this man know of my drunkenness, of my
adultery, of my backbiting, of my oppression? the Word so ransakes their
hearts, as that they think the Preacher knows their particular sins, whereas
he speaks in general, and the spirit by the Word does so dive into their
hearts, as that it summons them before God his tribunal seat, and makes them
cry, guilty: so powerful is the Word. Plato said, a Poet was (...), the Word
is not so. It is said of Pericles that (...), Suada, the goddess of eloquence
sessitavit in ejus labris, and he left Aculeos behind him. The infinite and
admirable wisdom of GOD Almighty is couched in the Word, and it leaves its
effects behind in the hearts of the auditors. You shall find it to be a
lively and mighty Word, one way or other, either to save you, or to condemn
you.

It is lively and mighty, in the good and bad. The one it does (...): the other
(...). Theodor. Isai. 11.4. Ezekiel. 11.13. Act. 5.1.

It is lively and mighty in the godly; to kill sin within them, to raise them
up unto newness of life; to be as a wing to carry them to heaven. Was it not
mighty in David, making him cry, peccavi? In Josiah, making his heart to melt?
in Manasseh, when of the most horriblest Idolater, that was ever heard of, it
made him a zealous worshipper of the true God? in Zacheus, when it made him to
forsake his oppression; and to restore fourefold? in Mary Magdalen, when it
cast out seven Devils out of her? in those three thousand souls, when pricked
in their hearts they went to the Apostles? in the City of Samaria, when it
made them to abjure Simon Magus, and to lysten to Saint Philip? Was it not
mighty by twelve men, over all the world, when it subdued by their Ministry
all nations to CHRIST? in us, by making us leave swearing, covetousness,
adultery, drunkenesse, etc. and renewing us to the likeness of CHRIST in
righteousness and true holiness? it is a mighty word. There may be a dark
and misty morning: the Sun comes, scatters the mist, cleares the air, and
makes it a bright day. So the whole world was shadowed with the mist of
blindness, and ^he fogge of sin: the word comes forth like the Sun, and
introduces the knowledge of CHRIST, and of his Gospel into all the world. O
mighty word! Let us all acknowledge the power of this wonderful word: who is
able to stand before this mighty word?

It is lively and mighty too, even in the very reprobate. Sometimes they may be
senseless, and have no feeling of the cutting of the Word, as those in
Jeremiah: Ier. 36.24.
nay they may even scoff at the Word preached, as the Pharisees did, Luke
16.14. their consciences may be seared up and feel not the sword when it
cutteth; as they that be in a lethargy, they may inwardly fret and fume, be in
a pelting chafe with the Preacher for reproving sins, as Achab with Micajah,
and Iesabel with Elias: yet but like madd dogs, that sit biting of the chain
wherewith they are tied, but not break the chain: So they may snap at the
Preacher and the Word, but they themselves have the hurt: yet for all that, at
one time or other God will make them to feel the power of his Word, and the
strength of this mighty arm of his. Did not Belshazzar quake, and were not his
joints loosed, and his knees smote one against another, Dan. 5.5.
when he saw the hand writing upon the wall? Did not the very officers
themselves wonder at CHRIST? Ioh. 7.46.
did not the very enemies wonder at the boldness of Peter and John? Acts 4.13.
was not Herod moved with Saint John Baptist's preaching? Mark 6.20. did not
Felix tremble, when Saint Paul discoursed of righteousness and judgment to
come? Acts 24. ver. 25. was not Agripp^ made an half Christian by Saint Paul's
preaching? Act. 26.28. did not the very Devil cry in the maid, these are the
servants of the most high God? Act. 16. The preaching of the word makes the
Devil himself to quake; for it batters the walls of his kingdom, and makes
him fall like lightning from heaven, Luke 10.18.

This should cause us to come with all reverence to the hearing of this lively
and mighty word: if it save us not, out of all question it will condemn us: it
is like the rain, that comes not in vain; if it bring not up flowers, it will
weeds. Therefore let us pray to God to bless this word to us; that it may be
the savor of life unto life, not to death to any of us all.

1. This should cause us to stand in a reverent awe of the word of God. When
ye come to a Sermon, do not think, ye come to hear music to delight your
selves withal, to hear a man that has a sweet and delectable voice, as the
people said of Ezekiel: that ye come to hear an eloquent oration finely
penned by a flowing Rhetorician, Ezekiel. 33.
to tickle the ear withal: that ye come to hear the song of some Siren to
^ull you asleep: that ye come to hear the word of a King that is able to
inflict some corporal punishment on you, if you do not obey it: but ye come
to hear the Word of the King of Kings, that is able to cast soul and body
into hell, if ye disobey it: ye come not to hear a man. There is much
questioning now who stands to day. If such a one preach, I will come to Church;
if such a one, I will not stir a foot out of doors for it.

There be diversities of gifts, but hear all good Preachers; for ye come not
to hear man, but God: ye come to a sword and that a sharp one. Balaams Ass
started at the Angels sword: and shall not we fear at Gods sword? When that
Parasite Damocles had the tyrant Dionysius sword hanging over his head, he
quaked; and when we be at Sermons, Gods sword hangs over our heads; therefore
let us hear with trembling. Upon whom shall my spirit rest? Even on him that
trembles at my word. Isai. 66.2.


2. Seeing it is such a mighty word: let us take heed how we jest with it.
Sundry there be that will make themselves merry with the Scriptures, as they
sit at table, as they walk together, and ride by the high way side, they will
snatch a sentence out of the Bible, to exercise wit withal: like Julian that
gave a Christian a box of ear, and then bade him turn the other cheek to
take another; for so, scoffingly said he, did your master CHRIST command you to
do: it is ill jesting with edge tools. The word of God is a sharp tool,
sharper than any two edged sword: therefore use it reverently in all your
speeches, make not your selves merry with that, lest God make you sorry
afterward. Will you jest with the writings of a King? that learned King James,
whom the Lord in mercy set over us, has many excellent books in print; dare
any of you jest with a sentence taken out of them? and shall we sport our
selves with the sacred writings of the King of Kings? Isack sported himself
with Rebeccah his Wife God has given thee many blessings; a loving Wife,
besides many other earthly delights; sport thy self with them after an holy
and religious manner, but sport not thy self with the Word of God: if thou
do, it will byte thee ere thou be aware.

3. This graphicall description of the Word of GOD should inflame us with a
love of it: it should cause us to prefer this above all other books in the
world. There is wit in Seneca, Plutarch, in Tully, in Saint Aug. Chrysostom. Jerome,
Bernard, yea, many excellent pearls of learning to be found in them; but not
worthy to be named the same day with the Bible. For there is an unspeakable
Majesty in the Word of God to waken thee up, being dull and drowsy to all good
duties; to comfort thee in all afflictions, to make thee a new Creature in
Christ Jesus.

Therefore Saint Augustine, after he was converted, professed of himself,
avidissime arripui venerabilem stylum spiritus tui, Aug. Conf. lib. 7. cap. 21.
Illic potissimum quaerenda est sapientia, ubi staltitia titulus apparet.
Therefore let it be greedily affected by us all; Lactant.
let us spend less time in other books, and more in this.

4. Seeing it is such a lively, mighty, and piercing Word, let the Preachers
especially propound this to the people: they shall do more good with one
sentence of Gods Word, then with thousands of Poets, and Philosophers, etc.
those may delectare; but these will inflammare: did not our hearts burn within
us, when he expounded the Scripture by the way? Those will tickle the ear,
Luke 24.
but these will kindle a fire in the heart, that cannot be quenched: those will
make the people to say of thee when they are gone, a fine man, he has a sweet
and eloquent tongue: but the proofs of Scripture will make them to say, Oh
mighty and powerful man! The Philosophers says Lactant. have many excellent
precepts, yet no pondus in them, quia sunt humana, and authoritate majori. i.
divina curent: therefore, no man believes them, quia tam se hominem esse putat
qui audivit, quam ille qui praecepit: we cannot aliunde suadere de rebus fidei,
quam ex literis fidei. Tertul. At the Council of Nice there was a Philosopher
of singular note for learning, that disputed with the Bishops there assembled,
about three hundred and eighteen, he had so many cunning evasions, that
tanquam anguis lubricus, he always wound away. At length an ancient man,
which was no Minister but a good professor, takes him in hand: he encounters
with him only in the name of CHRIST, and with the naked Word of God: the
Philosopher was overcome, and yielded the bucklers to him, saying to his
Scholars: donec verbis mecum res gesta est, verba verbis apposui: ubi vero pro
verbis virtus processit ex ore dicentis, Ruff. lib. 1. cap. 3.
non potuerunt resistere verba virtuti, nec homo adversari Deo.

Virtus crucifixi in Paulo fuit omnibus poetis, philosophis, rhetoribus
potentior. As David said of Goliahs sword, may be said most truly of this,
there is none to the Word of God, I will fight with that in every Sermon.

But what manner of Word is this, that is so lively and mighty in operation?
Not the word that God speaks immediately with his own mouth from Heaven, as
he thundered at the giving of the Law: but the word that he speaks by the
mouth of his Ambassadors. Romans 10.8. 1 Cor. 1.21. 1 Pet. 1.25. Though a weak
man has the handling of this sword: yet because the Spirit of God strikes
with it, it will give a sound blow.

This word is a Discerner, a Critic, that judges soundly, and narrowly: as
Aristarchus and Aristophanes leave nothing unsearched, 1 Cor. 14.24. Luc. 2.35.

As the Prophet Elisha revealed to the King of Israel, whatsoever was done in
the King of Syria his privy Chamber; so the word of God does discern the most
secret thoughts of our hearts: the thoughts and intents of the heart, that is,
The first conceptions which are as children of the mind, the cogitations, which
delight and consent have apprehended, and are ready to bring into practice. The
consideration hereof should cause us to have a reverent regard of the word of
God, and to stand in awe of it. When ye come to a Sermon, ye come to a diligent
and narrow Searcher that can lay open all the secret sins that ye have
committed: your adulteries, oppressions, backbitings, and slanderings, thefts,
your beastly drinking in Tavernes and Alehouses. Behold a man that has told me
all that ever I have done, John 4.
said the woman of Samaria: and I say, behold you are now hearing of that word,
that will tell you all that you have done. You come to hear that which shall
judge you at the latter day: therefore hear not drowsily, loosely, carelessly,
negligently, Take heed how you hear, If it be not a sword to kill sin in you,
to mortify the members of the old- Adam in you, it will be a sword to kill you
everlastingly.

A strange thing! there has been wonderful plenty of preaching in this Land,
yet small profiting by it, and why? because we have not the reverent
estimation of the word of God that we ought to have: we think too basely of
it, we imagine it not to be of half the power it is.

VERSE 13.
THE third reason to excite us to this heavenly study is taken from the
omniscience and unspeakable knowledge of God Almighty, who is a spectator of
all our doings, and sees whether we have a care or not to enter into that rest
prepared for us.

That God knows all, he shows by a distribution of the persons, and of the
things: he that knows all creatures, and all things, knows all; but God
knows all creatures and all things; ergo.

Not man alone, but no creature, no not the Angels are unknown unto him:
whether they be Angels or Archangels, Cherubins or Seraphims, they are all
manifest in his sight. He beholds Angelum in Coelo, and vermiculum in Coeno:
the Angels in heaven, for they are continually in his presence; the fowls in
the heaven are manifest in his sight: he knows them all, from the Eagle to
the Sparrow that hoppeth on the ground: not a Sparrow falls to the ground
without his providence: all the beasts of the field are known unto him;
Bears, Lions, etc. are all at his Commandment: yea, the little Pismere is
known to him: the Fishes that play in the Sea from the great Whale to the
little Sprat: the waters under the earth, the grave, yea hell it self is
manifest in his sight.

Much more then is Man, yea the very heart of man: he knows the hearts of all
the Children of men: he knew Saul when and where he prayed: Act. 9.11.

Not only all creatures, but all things are known to him with whom we have to
do. Some things he knows in superficie: Aquin.
some in profundo.

All things are naked. When a man's Coat or shirt is pulled off, we may then
see any skars, wrinckles or blemishes that be in his body.

The fair coats, the velvet gowns that be on the backs of men and Women will
not suffer us to behold their bodies: many soars and blemishes may be in the
body which we see not. No Coats can keep us from GODS eyes. Though Herod
have his Royal apparel on him, though a Lady or Gentlewoman never so many
Coats, or gallant attire, yet God sees through them all: the darkness is no
darkness to him: and the coats, are no coats to him.

God sees likewise in profundo. For (...), they are all opened unto his eyes:
(...) are (...), all agree of that. (...).

(...).) It is a Metaphor taken from them, that pluck the skin from the
sacrifices, (...). As when the beast is slain, and the skin plucked of, all
that is within is open to the eyes of man: So all things are open to the eyes
of God.

Erasmus translates it cervicata, of (...): as when a beast is cut into two
pieces by the back bone, all his entralls and bowels are seen. (...) is a
neck. (...) is to lift up the neck, that it may be apparent to all; which a
man may do, when he lies along upon his back with his face upwards.

An Horse is said (...) when he lifts up his forefoot aloft, that his whole
neck and breast may be seen. When a man holds down his face, there may be a
wart or blemish in his neck under his chinne that cannot be seen: but when
he lies with his face upwards, all may be seen: so all things to God, lie
with the face upward, he sees whatsoever they have.

Omniscience or the knowledge of all things is peculiar to God: none but God
knows all things. The Angels are of great knowledge, yet they know not the day
of judgment, nor the heart of man: they learn many things by the Church, as
St. Paul speaks: Ephesians. 3.10.
it is proper to God alone to know all things.

Thou know all things, said the Disciples to CHRIST John 16.30. his eyes are
over all the ends of the world, to behold the things that are done therein.
Nothing, but is open to him. He knew the murder of Caine, and saw when he raked
up the body of his brother Abel in the field. He saw the theft of Achan, that
was hid from all Israel, the incest of Amnon in his Chamber, the quaffing and
swilling of Belshazzar in his palace, he saw Zimri and Cosbi together that were
taken in the act of Adultery. But men are come to this pass, Psalm. 94.7.
that they imagine God knows nothing: tush God sees it not: though we be as
drunk as beggars, lie like beasts in blind Alehouses, God sees it not:
though we lie, coozen, purloine, steal secretly one from another; God sees
not, est aliquid spectare deos, and adesse putare. The Schoolmasters is not
always in the School: the eye of the Tutour is not always on the pupil, to
see how he studies: but Gods eye is ever on us.

Psalm. 139.6.
Thy knowledge, says David, is too wonderful for me. Oh that this were
carefully remembered! We are not to deal with a one eyed Polyphemus, with
blind Appius, with Argus who had a hundred eyes: but he that we deal withal
has a thousand eyes: wherefore let us be afraid to sin any where. Potiphars
Wife watched a time when none of the men of the house were within: yet God was
in the house. Let us remember that God is every where, and that this (...) of
his Omniscience is upon us; that we may learn to walk with God as Enoch did,
live as in the presence of the eternal God, approving our conversation to him
in this world, that we may rest with Christ in the world to come.

VERSE 14.
NOw the Apostle comes to CHRIST whose Word it is, and makes a transition to
his Priesthood: wherein consider. 1. A description of this our high Priest. 2.
The use we are to make of it. He is described. 1. In regard of his excellency
and power. 2. In regard of his piety, love, and kindness. The use, is partly
exhortatorie, in this Verse; consolatory, in the rest. Where, First, the
foundation whereupon the consolation is built. Secondly the consolation it
self.

Our Priest is described, 1. By the adjunct of greatness. 2. By a wonderful
effect performed by him. 3. By his name. 4. By his nature.


Having therefore. It is not always a note of illation, but sometimes it is
put in the beginning of a sentence Ornatus gratia: yet it may have a coherence
with that which went immediately before.

Seeing we have a great high Priest, whose Word is so lively and mighty in
operation before whose eyes all things are naked. He does not say; seeing that
we hear of so great an High Priest, seeing that we see him afar off; but
seeing we have so great an High Priest, we have a right and interest to him.
Not an inferior Priest, but an High Priest, the chief of Priests, to whom all
Priests must submit their Miters. CHRIST is (...), he has a principality and a
pre-eminence in all things.

Great. Surpassing all the high Priests that ever were. They were mere men;
this both God and man: they mortal; this immortal: they kept their office for
a time; this for ever: Men did but stoop to them; the Angels stoop to this
our High Priest: their jurisdiction was shut up in the territories of Judea;
this rules over all the world. He is a great one: therefore do no ill,
because of his greatness, and fear no enemies, if we do well.

Which is gone through the heavens: Acts 1.9.
which has pierced these visible heavens object to our eyes, and is entered
into the highest heaven, where he sits at the right hand of God for ever.
The High Priest in the time of the law, entered into the Sanctum Sanctorum; but
this has entered into heaven, whereof that was a Type and a figure: there he
makes intercession for us. The High Priest went into the Sanctum Sanctorum
once every year: he is gone once into heaven for all.

Christ then in respect of his humanity, is not in the earth.

Jesus: excelling Iehosuah the High Priest, Zach. 3.1. Who according to his
name was a kind of Savior, but not worthy to be named with this Jesus the same
day.

The Son of God. He was the Son of man too: Mary was his Mother: The High
Priests in the time of the law were the Sons of Aaron, they descended of him;
this is the Son of God: he thought it no robbery to be equal with God. Phil. 2.


Upon that he infers the first Use -- Our High Priest is a mighty one, able
to punish us, if we shrink from our profession; Romans 10.10.
and of power to protect us from all our enemies, if we stick to him: therefore
let us hold fast our profession.

With might and maine, totis viribus, the doctrine professed by us: let no
enemies drive us from our profession, neither Satan, nor any of his
instruments. The Pharisees held fast the traditions of their elders and would
not be removed from them, Mark. 7.3. All Heretics have held fast their
opinions: they are (...). Some Heretics have held their opinions to the
death. Superstitious persons have held fast their superstitions, being wedded
to them. All Ephesus cried out for Diana, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. The
loss of Michas goods did not grieve him half so much as the loss of his
gods: ye have taken away my gods, and what have I more? Act. 19.28.
Iud. 18.

The Turks are wonderfully addicted to Mahomet: he is a great Prophet among
them, they will not let him go. And shall not we hold the profession of the
Lord Jesus? They hold errors fast, and shall not we the truth? The subject of
their profession are base and counterfeit things, mere inventions of men, lies
and fables. Mahomet was but a base fellow, a Merchants man, one that had the
falling sickness, a coozener and a jugler: the subject of our profession is
Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Therefore let us hold it fast: Let neither the
Syrenicall songs of Heretics and Schismatickes in the time of peace, nor the
blustering wind of persecution in the time of War, pull us from our confession.
Let us be faithful to the death, as the Martyrs were; let house and land,
Wives and Children, liberty and Country, yea our lives go, before our
profession. But this is an hard matter: we have no strength of our selves to
hold it against so many strong and mighty enemies. Saint Peter thought himself
a stout champion: though all deny thee, I will not: Yet he denied him, he was
not so good an holdfast of his profession, as he should have been. Therefore
let us all fear our selves and fly to God for strength: that it would please
him so to strengthen us by his holy spirit, that we may hold fast the
profession of Christ and his Gospel to the end: hold that which thou have,
lest another take thy Crown. We will hold our money fast, though it be to good
uses, we will not part with that: but as for religion, a number are at this
pass, they care not what becomes of it; let that go whither it will: So we
may sleep in an whole skin, and keep that which we have, let come what
religion there will, we can be of any Religion: Such turne-coats and
time-servers shall never set a foot in the kingdom of heaven. If we hold not
our profession fast, we shall miss of the Crown of eternal life.

VERSE 15.
THe foundation whereupon the consolation is built, is the wonderful love and
compassionate kindness of this our High Priest.

It depends on the former, by preventing an objection that might be made.
Thou willest us to hold fast our profession; but alas how shall we do it?
We are compassed about with many weaknesses and infirmities, by reason whereof
we shall not be able to keep it fast. Be not discouraged with the sight of your
infirmities; your High Priest is well enough acquainted with them: who as he is
high, and mighty, so he is wonderful, kind and loving.

He is not stately, as some great personages be, Kings, Priests and others,
that look aloft, and disdain them, that be under them: his magnificence does
not make him proud: he descends to the lowest of his brethren.

1. Misericordia vera. 2. Assumpta miseria. 3. Servata innocentia.

His love and kindness is set forth. 1. Negatively. 2. Affirmatively: which
cannot compati. He is not made of steel and iron, but of the same flesh that
we be.

He is acquainted with our infirmities. Simplici notitia, ut Deus: experientia,
ut homo: he has a feeling of all our miseries in soul and body.

But such a one as suffers with us in all calamities, being tempted as we
are; passing through the furnace of all afflictions, as we have done:
temptations are put for afflictions, Iac. 1.2.

In all points as we are: according to the same similitude that we are: not in
show, as a painted man is like a man; but in deed, in truth, Phil. 2.7. Christ
did really and truly sustain the like calamities that we do.

The only difference is in the manner, not in the matter: he was tempted as we
are; but not after the same sort: our temptations are mixed with sin; his
not: we sin in our afflictions; he not, 2 Cor. 5. ult.

1. They that be in high places, must have a feeling of the miseries of others:
Whereas many have not; what is that to us? Great personages in high places have
little feeling of the miseries of their brethren in low and inferior places:
many a Peer that fares delicately every day has little feeling of the
calamities of sundry of his poor brethren: but our High Priest, the great
Shepherd of our souls, has a feeling of the griefs, not only of the
Shepherds that be under him, but of every Sheep, nay of every Lamb that is in
his flock: being man he is acquainted with all the infirmities of men: he does
not only know them notitia speculativa, but experimentali: Saepius ipse miser
miseris succurrere disco: he that ^s in misery himself, can the better pity
them that be in misery: he that never tasted of poverty, can hardly pity a
poor man: a Physician may pity a sick man; but unless he have been
molested with sickness himself, he cannot have so great compassion on them
that be sick. Country fellows that never knew the labor of a student and
painful Preacher, think it is no labor to preach.

Nothing can move commiseration, so much, as a fellow-feeling of the same
misery. This is in our High Priest, our Lord and Savior: being clothed with
our nature, he is touched with our infirmities.

2. When we are afflicted, Christ is afflicted. If the meanest Christian
suffer, he suffers. Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? non meos. We do not
only suffer for CHRIST, but with CHRIST: he is not only the master for whom we
suffer, but the companion with whom we suffer. If we be sick, he is sick. Art
thou tempted of the devil, sometimes to presumption, to desperation? so
Christ: art thou hungry, thirsty, weary, or heavy of sleep? Art thou grieved
for the departure of thy friends? So was he for Lazarus. Is thy soul heavy
and pensive? So was Christ's: my soul is heavy to the death: do thine own
familiar friends betray thee? So was it with Christ: art thou molested with
railing, scoffing and backbiting tongues? So was CHRIST: as he hung on the
Cross in all his pains, they derided him, and nodded their heads at him: art
thou tormented with the pains of Death, and at the last give up the ghost?
So was it with our blessed Savior. No temptation has fallen to us, but the
same befell to Christ before us. We drink of his cup, and are baptized with his
baptism.

When the Wife is grieved, the Husband (if he be as he ought to be) is grieved.
We are the Spouse; Christ is our husband: therefore our grief is his grief.
When any member of the body suffers, though it be the foot that treads on
the ground, the head suffers. We are the members, Christ the head: therefore
our crosses are his crosses. Many are the troubles of the righteous: through
many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God. But let this be a
pillar for us to lean upon in all afflictions: our sufferings are Christ's
sufferings, and he will one day make a comfortable end of them all.

VERSE 16.
THe other comfortable use we are to make of this Priest, is contained in this
Verse, which is, that we have an access to God: which is amplified by the
manner how, the place whereunto, and the end.

Let us not fear him, because he is a great and mighty high Priest, but let
us go to him, and to God the Father by him.

This going is not only with the feet of our bodies, but of the mind.

Let us go by prayer to God: not fear to put up our supplications to him.

Not quaking and trembling as to a Judge; but with boldness, as to a father:
uttering our minds and disclosing our hearts to him.

To the throne of grace. There is thronus gloriae: Matthew. 25.31. Apoc. 6.16. he
speaks not of that, but of grace: because God is reconciled to us in the blood
of Christ.

1. We must pray to God, fly to him by prayer. 2. In the mediation of Christ
our high Priest. 3. In boldness with faith, Hebr. 11.6. Iac. 1.6. 4. The fruit
of prayer, which is double.
1. That we may find mercy for all our sins, and grace for all our miseries.

2. To a seasonable help, to help us in due time and season, when we stand
in need of it: In due time even in the time of trouble.

The Papists are enemies to this boldness: they will not have us to be so bold
as to go to God immediately by Christ: but we must have other intercessours by
the way; the Angels, the Virgin Mary and all the Saints triumphing in heaven:
yet the Holy Ghost will have us to go to God the father boldly, in the name of
Christ alone: observe the words of the Text.

Therefore. First, seeing we have such a compassionate high Priest; let us go
boldly in his name to the throne of God. 2. He does not say, let us stand a
far off, but let us go. 3. Not quaking and shaking like Aspen leaves, but
with boldness. 4. Not to the Throne of justice, but of grace: a gracious
reconciliation being made by him between God and us. 5. Not to find Jack
drums enterteinments, and to be sent packing away, but that we may obtain
mercy, etc. Therefore let us sue to God in the only name of this our high
Priest: Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name, Ioh. 16.23.
he will give it you. Then why should we seek to any other? he makes
intercession in the heavens for us, not the Saints or Angels: Romans 8.34.
there is one Mediator between God and man, 1 Timothy 2.5. The Scripture
acknowledges but one. True, say the Papists, but one immediate Mediator, yet
there be many mediate Mediators besides him. This is a plaster for many
soars with the Papists. There is but one immediate head of the Church,
whereunto the Church is united as a body; but the Pope may be a mediate head
of the Church: So there may be mediate mediators between Christ the
immediate Mediator. They might as well say, there be many mediate Gods; for
the text says, as there is one Mediator, so one God: shall we then
distinguish as they do? but one Immediate God, yet many mediate Gods besides
him? they may affirm the one as well as the other. Away with all those
mediators set up by the Church of Rome, and let us go with boldness to the
throne of grace, in the name of this our High Priest and only Mediator. None
so gracious with God as he: none has reconciled us to God, but he: none
loves, nor tendereth us, as he does, having laid down his life for us. Shall
we go to a father in the name of a servant, when we may go in the name of his
Son? Angels and Saints are but servants, our fellow servants and brethren;
Christ is the Son of God: therefore let us go to him, in his name: and if we
ask any thing according to his will, he will hear us for his sake.

This encouragement does the Holy Ghost give us in the next words: we shall not
loose our labor, nor go away empty: God the Father for Christ his sake will
lade us with his benefits. 2 Timothy 1. ult.
In due time, even in affliction, says the Psalmist, God will stand by us, in
all our needs, in sickness, poverty, imprisonment, banishment, yea in death
it self. The examples of Iosuah, the three Children, Daniel, Jonah, Peter,
stand as so many marble pillars to confirm and ratify this: when all leave
us, he will not forsake us: when my Father and Mother forsake me, the Lord
will take me up, says the Psalmist. Psalm. 27.10.
Even then, at the hour of death, he will command his Angels to take our
souls, and carry them up into Abraham's bosom, there to praise him for ever,
world without end.

CHAP. 5.
IN the latter end of the former Chapter was contained a transition to the
Priesthood of CHRIST: now he enters into the discourse of it, wherein he is
very ample: because many excellent points of celestial doctrine be comprised
in it.

1. A proposition concerning the Priesthood, from the first Verse to the
eleaventh, evinced by a comparison between the High Priest and him.

2. A large explication of it: wherein,

1. An entrance to the explication by a new exordium preparing them to it.
Verse 11. to the end of the sixth Chapter.

2. The explication it self. Chap. 7.8, and 9.

The proposition concerning the Priest hood is set down.

1. Generally by an enumeration of the qualities required in a Priest, in the
four former Verses.

2. An Application of them to Christ; from the fifth Verse to the eleaven^h.

In the setting down of the proposition in general these circumstances are
unfolded to us.



2. The end why the Priest is ordained.

3. The object whereabout he is occupied.

4. One principal po^nt wherein it does chiefly consist.







In the Application of it. 1. He shows, that Christ has a lawful

1. In respect of the things he was to do with God.





Ergo, you are dull hearers. For we have need to teach you your A. B. C.
again: which he illustrateth by a similitude, first set down.

Then unfolded with both the branches belonging to it.

The conjunction, For, is not always copulativa, but sometimes inchoativa: set
for a grace and ornament in the beginning of a sentence: yet it may have this
coherence with the former: having a great and a loving High Priest, let us go
with boldness to the throne of Grace: for this our high Priest has all things
that appertain to an High Priest, as shall appear by the particulars.

Not one or two, but all: every one, not one exempted. Aaron, Eleazar,
Iehojadah, Iehosuah, yea Melchizedec himself; though his father and mother are
not expressed in Scripture, yet he was taken from among men. So was our
SAVIOR himself, being made of a Woman, and found in the true shape and
similitude of a man.

Not only every inferior Priest, but every High Priest: the Highest of all was
taken from among men. God takes him by the hand, separateth him from among his
brethren, and sets him in a chair of dignity above them all.

He was not taken ex volatilibus, that he might not mount up above others: not
ex reptilibus, because he should not be too much glewed to the earth: not ex
piscibus, then in another element: not ex angelis, then he could not converse
familiarly with his brethren, nor have compassion on their infirmities: but the
High Priest was taken from among men: he is a man as others be. When God had
brought all Creatures before man, he found not an help meet for him: So God
thought it not meet to make an High Priest for men, but among men.

All Ministers and Preachers are taken from among men: it did not seem good to
the wisdom of GOD to call Angels to this office.

The Angel appeared to Philip, and sent him to instruct the Eunuch: but the
Angel did not teach him himself. It was not an Angel that preached CHRIST to
Cornelius, but Saint Peter that was a man as he himself was. As CHRIST took
not on him the nature of Angels, but the seed of Abraham: So GOD has not
appointed Angels Preachers, but men: we have this treasure in earthen vessels.
The Preachers that bring the pearl of the word, are vessels of earth, as you
your selves be: And take heed that ye do not contemn them. GOD has
honored them with an high and magnificent office, therefore do not you
dishonor them.

A number think basely of the Ministers, because they be but men as they are.
A father is but a man, yet the child honors him, yea though he be a man grown
himself, as Solomon did Bathshebah. A Master is but a man: yet the servant,
though elder and stronger then he, reverences him. The Mayor and Bayliffes of a
Town are but men, yet the whole corporation yields honor to them. Justices of
Peace are but men: yet feared in regard of their places. A King is but a man,
taken from among men, and dies as other men: yet we do not despise him,
because he is a man. So though the Preacher be a man, as others be, it may be a
weak and poorer man: yet in regard of that office whereunto God has exalted
him to be his Ambassador and steward, to be his arm to pull you up to the
kingdom of heaven, he is to be reverenced by you all. God has taken us from
among men, to carry men into his own kingdom: therefore love and honor us.

To what use? For the salvation of men, God by a man will save men: not for
himself alone, but for other men: he is not ordained for beasts, for the
building of houses, the tilling of ground, the making of Cloth; but to build
up men to life everlasting, to break up the fallow hearts of men, and to sow
the immortal seed of the word in them.

Not ordained for Angels, but for men: the good Angels need him not, the bad
Angels shall have no benefit by him. He is ordained for the saving of men, not
of Angels: not for rich men alone, but also for poor: not only to tell mean
men of their duties, but great men too, whatsoever their authority be in the
world.

So is the Magistrate ordained of God, Romans 13.4. therefore the distinction
follows, in things that are to be done with God: the one in temporalibus,
the other in spiritualibus: the one is occupied about the goods, names and
bodies of men: the other about the souls of men, Hebr. 13.17.

The Ministers office is to preach the Word, to teach the people the way to
heaven, to pray for the people in the congregation, to carry their prayers to
God, to celebrate the Sacraments: these be the lysts of the Minister. The
Magistrate has his bounds, and the Minister his.

Vzziah, though a King, must not meddle with the Priests office, and Azariah
the High Priest must not intrude himself into the Kings office: yet that High
Priest of Rome will have both swords; he will be a Priest and a King too: he
will be for matters of the world, as well as for GODS matters. Boniface the
eight showed himself one day in the attire of a Priest, another day in the
attire of a Prince; affirming that he was both.

Bellarmine of late has somewhat minced the matter, that the Pope has no
power in temporal matters direct: yet indirecte quoad bonum spirituale he may
play Rex. In respect of the spiritual good of the Church, he may depose
Princes at his pleasure, and dispose of their kingdoms as pleases him. So as
a man get into an house, it makes no great matter, whether directly or
indirectly: and the Papists, so as they may thrust the Pope into the possession
of temporalities, they care not whether directly or indirectly. If one kill a
man, whether directly or indirectly, all is one: So as the Pope may play the
butcher with Kings and Princes at his pleasure, what avails it, whether
directly or indirectly? this is indirect dealing by an indirect distinction to
break down the wall of partition, that God Himself has set up between the
Priest and the Magistrate.

Every one shall find enough to do in his office, and to guide his own
boat, though he intermedle not in the office of the other, and put his rudder
into another man's boat. Let the Magistrate look well to his temporal things:
and let the Minister keep himself to his spiritual things: they be both Gods
deputies; the one in things that belong to God, the other in things that
per^^ine to men. Let them discharge their offices, to Gods glory, and the good
of them that be committed to their charge.

He insisteth in one particular pertaining to GOD: that he may offer both gifts
and sacrifices for sins, that is for the expiation of sins.

The Jesuits will have a perpetual Priesthood to be here described and
ordained in this place. There must be Priests to the end of the world, to offer
sacrifice for sin: whereas, it is as clear as the noone day, that this
description is borrowed out of the law, to set forth the spiritual Priesthood
of Christ withal. The Apostle here teaches us, not what must be in the time
of the Gospel, but what was in the time of the law, applying it to Christ.

An external sacrifice propitiatory for sin (as they will have it) is
injurious to the blessed and perfect sacrifice, which Christ offered on the
Cross for the sins of the world. All outward sacrifices for sin must now
cease, the blood of Christ shed on the cross having purged us from all sin.

Yet the Ministers of the Gospel have now some sacrifices to offer up: they
be either common with all Christians, or proper to their ministry.

1. They must offer up themselves* souls and bodies, as an holy sacrifice to
God, as all Christians are bound to do.

2. They must be plentiful in the works of mercy to their power, as other
Christians are: for with such sacrifices GOD is well pleased.

But there be other spiritual sacrifices, that are also proper to them.

1. To present the prayers of the people to God. Ezra praised the great God of
heaven, and all the people said, Amen. So the Minister, as the mouth of the
congregation, as a Spiritual Priest, must offer up the prayers of the people
to God, and they in an holy zeal subscribe to him, saying, Amen, Amen.

2. We by the preaching of the Word do sacrifice the people to God. Romans 15.16.
The Priests in the time of the law took a knife and cut the throat of a Calfe,
a Sheep, a Goat, and so sacrificed them to the Lord. We by the sword of the
Spirit, cut the throat of sin, of covetousnes, pride, malice, uncleannes, and
so offer up the people as a glorious sacrifice to the Lord, an odor that
smells sweet. Happy are they that be sacrificed by the Ministers of the
holy Word: these sacrifices we must offer to the end of the world: and pray
for us, that we may offer them, to Gods glory, the comfort and salvation of you
all.

VERSE 2.
HE must not only execute his office, but in such a manner as God requires:
not in rigor and severity, but in love, kindness and compassion. Which is
illustrated by the persons, on whom he must have compassion, and the cause why.

If any sin on ignorance, or weakness; he must have compassion on them.
Such as are seduced by others and carried out of the way, what and if they
sin on knowledge? Must they not be pitied? Yes, God forbid else: but if they
sin on malice against the known truth, we must not so much as pray for them,
nor be touched with any compassion toward them. Ier. 11.14. 1 Ioh 5.16.
Pray not for this people, neither lift up a cry for them. There is a sin
unto death: I do not say that ye shall pray for it. Saint Paul had no pity
on Alexander the Copper-Smith, but prayed against him.

Otherwise, if any of the people through infirmity fall into a sin, if upon
weakness of brain he be overcome with drink; if by the flattering
entisements of the flesh, he happen to be carried into Adultery; if he be
somewhat too much in love with the world; if he be a little tinckled with
pride; if he happen to be seduced by any Heretics, that come with a show of
Religion, with fair and sugared words, and so beguile him ere he be aware;
we that be the Preachers of the Word must have compassion on such. A Minister
must not have an heart of flint, but of oil, ready to melt at the
consideration of the infirmities of the people, and there is good cause why?
Because he himself is compassed with infirmities, as they are, as with a
gown, that covers him from top to toe.

VERSE 3.
ANd that he proves by an evident sign.

A Minister is compassed with the same infirmities that the people are. The
Lycaonians would have sacrificed to St. Paul and Barnabas: Acts 14.15.
but they refused it. O do not so; we are men of the like passions with you.
Acts 10.26.
Cornelius fell down at Saint Peter's feet: but he took him up saying, I my
self also am a man. Elias was a rare and admirable Prophet, Iac. 5.17.
yet a man subject to like passions as we are.

Though we be never so wise, learned, or holy; yet let the best Preachers in
the world remember, that they be men clothed with the ragged Coat of
infirmities, as others be. Hence it is, that Ministers, yea famous Ministers
do often fall: As Noah did into drunkenness, David into Adultery and murder,
Peter into the denial of CHRIST: and grave and reverend Preachers are subject
to falls, at this present day: which are rather to be lamented, then insulted
of: therefore being clad with the same infirmities, let us pity our brethren,
when they sin, Gala. 6.1. So let us consider our selves, lest we be tempted
also. One poor man will pity an other: one sick man may well pity an other.
Thou art sick of the disease of sin, as well as the people, therefore pity
them, when through weakness they are carried into sin. Are the people heavy
and drowsy at Sermons? pity them; thou have the same lump of flesh as they
have. Is any overtaken with drink, pride, uncleanness and other sins? Wink
not at their iniquities, yet pity those poor souls; even we that be
Preachers, if GOD take away his hand, may fall as they do: therefore have
compassion on them, and with meekness pull them up out of their sins.

VERSE 4.
A Calling is most requisite in all things we take in hand, especially in the
ministry. Who will meddle with the Sheep of a man, unless he be called to
it? and shall we meddle with Christ's Sheep without a calling? The Jesuits
triumph in this place. If Luther, Calvin, Beza were examined by this clause:
there would be found foul matter against them. Nay, if Pope John the twenty
two that chose himself, Pope Hildebrand, that entered the seat with the murder
of his predecessors, if Pope Sylvester the second that came in by conjuring,
if Pope Eugenius that came in by Simonie; there would be found foul matter of
damnation: if all the Popish sacrificing Priests were examined by this clause,
which take upon them to offer up Christ without any calling, nay the whole
Scripture calling them from it, they would be in a miserable case.

As for our calling. 1. It is of God. 2. Of the Church of God. We have Gods
seal to our calling, because he has furnished us in some measure with gifts
for it: yet who is sufficient for these things? 2. We are called by the
Church, which by imposition of hands representing Gods hand, has separated us
to this office. Let every one be assured of his calling. The Brownists harp
much on this string: but I pray you who called Hunt a Soldier a mere ignorant
man to be a Minister or De la cluse a Cardmaker to be a Preacher? Who calls
Tailors, Weavers and other artificers to be expounders of the Word?

A lamentable thing to consider, what a number of intruders there be, that have
thrust themselves into this holy calling. In Ieroboams time every one that
would consecrate himself, 1 Reg. 13.33.
became one of the Priests of the high places. I pray God we live not in those
^imes: every one that has money, that can fee a greedy patron, may have a
benefice, and leap into the Ministry. A woeful thing.

Shall we have them to make cloth, that have no skill in clothing? will any
make him his Shepherd, that knows not what belongs to Sheep? and will thou
deliver Christ's Sheep into the hands of a blind and ignorant Shepherd?

Zach. 13.5.
Will thou have him to build thy house, that has no skill in building? will thou make him the Schoolmasters of thy child, that has no learning: but any
is good enough for the Ministry. If men did look as well to the charge, as
to the dignity of the office: if Onus were as well considered as honos, men
would not make such have to it as they do. Heb. 13.17.
They watch over the souls of the people, as they that must give an account:
The day of taking in our profits is sweet, but the counting day will be
terrible, when CHRIST will require every lost Sheep at our hands. Therefore let
none take this honor to himself, but see that he be called of God, as Aaron
was. If thou come uncalled, God will say to thee; Friend, how came thou
hither? bind thee hand and foot and cast thee into outer darkness. But if we
come in by Gods calling, he will protect us in our office against the Devil
and all his instruments; he will bless us in our office in this life, and of
his mercy, not of our merits, crown us in the life to come. Therefore let us
all examine our calling, internal and external: for an Ass may be in a
Lions skin, Nehem. 7.64.
an Ape in a purple Coat: endeavor therefore that in some measure we may be
sure of our calling.

Before, the qualities required in a Priest were generally propounded: now they
are particularly applied to Christ.

VERSE 5.
1. HIs calling to the office. 2. The exequution of his office. 1. In things
belonging unto God, Verse 7, and 8. 2. In things pertaining unto us, Ver. 9,
and 10.

His calling is iterated as the foundation of all. Which is first affirmed,
then confirmed by two testimonies: the one obscure; the other plain: Aaron had
his calling mediately by Moses, Exodus 28.1. Christ had his immediately by God,
Ioh. 8.42. Aaron was the Son of a man: Christ is the Son of God.

Thou art my Son: tu singulariter. In calling him his Son, he calls him a
Priest: for the first begotten was a Priest.

In the next words it is, ask of me. He appoints him to pray for the Church,
which is the office of the Priest.

VERSE 6.
SAcerdos: Sacer dux; docens, orans, offerens.

They were Priests after the order of Aaron: he after the order of Melchizedek.
They for a time; CHRIST for ever, Hebr. 9.24.

VERSE 7.
THe Priest did offer for the people: So CHRIST for us. Which is amplified by
the time, when; the things, what; the manner, how; the person, to whom; the
fruits: which are two.

1. The hearing of it. 2. His learning by it.
The Priest was a man: So Christ.

In the days of his flesh, that is of his mortal and weak flesh, compassed
with infirmities, Ioh. 1.14. In heaven he has flesh still, but immortal and
void of these natural weaknesses: no need of meat, drink, sleep, not
subject to weariness, without any possibility of dying.

As CHRIST'S flesh is in heaven, so shall ours be there too with him.

Offered up prayers, etc. that in the garden.

He uses the plural number, because it was made thrice, and so three prayers,
signifying wants and necessities: for things wanting, of (...), indigeo. (...).


(...), of (...), venio: because they went after a meek and submisse manner.

Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass, etc. There is his crying.

Tears, drops of blood, Luke 22.44.

Exauditus a metu.

Though Chrysostom translate it, reverence: yet Nazianzen and Theodoret,
translate it, fear. Calvin in this last time found it out raked under ashes,
but he was not the first founder of it: but Nazianzen, and Theodoret.

Mark. 14.33. Hebr. 11.7. The Jesuits translate, it ( feared.)

Christ as he was man, did not only fear the death of the body, the separation
of the soul from it: but also having the load of all the sins of all the
faithful on him, he feared the wrath of his Father: yet without any diffidence
or distrust. He was in a wonderful perplexity and perturbation as ever any
was, the power of the deity for a time suppressed, thinking himself as it were
forsaken of his Father.

God plucked him out of this fear, sending an Angel to comfort him, and
strengthening him himself.

This is no disparagement to CHRIST, because he was a true man.

It is not in vain to pray: for God will hear us. If not ad voluntatem, yet
ad utilitatem. He does not hearken so much to the external cry of the throat,
for Esau cried, but obtained not the blessing. Baals Priests cried from morning
to noone, but were not heard: he hearkens to the internal cries of his Spirit
in his Children, 1 Ioh. 5.14. So he heard Anna, Hezekiah, David, the Nine*
vites; Ion. 3.8.
when they cried unto him. He heard Daniel, Dan, 9.23. and Cornelius prayers
were in remembrance with God.

VERSE 8.
THe second fruit is, his learning by it. 1. The Scholar. 2. The Lesson. 3.
The Schoolmasters.

Though he were a Son, equal with his Father, Phil. 2.6. by those his
sufferings he learned what obedience meant: experimento didicit. Cajetan, he
felt by experience what it was to obey.

Christ learned as he was man, as Luke 2. ult.

Afflictions are very profitable for us. It is good for me, says the Psalm.
that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes. (...): qua
nocent, docent.

In prosperity, we are as Calves, Oxen and fat Horses, kicking against our
master, pursuing eagerly after the sinful pleasures and profits of this world:
but adversity makes us to retire home to God, and submit ourselves to him by
unfeigned repentance: in their affliction they will seek me early. When a
Scholar in the School is under the rod, he will cease then to play rex, he
will cry peccavi, keep in his seat afterward, and apply himself to his book:
So afflictions will make us to consider our ways, and apply our selves wholly
to the obedience of Gods word and will.

VERSE 9.
COnsecrate to God and approved of God, Hebr. 2.10.

Author. Good works are the fruits of faith, seals of our election, and
pledges of our salvation: but Christ is the Author.

Eternal. Not as some that are saved from the Gallows, and after dye.

Unto all. To Lazarus and Abraham; Jews and Gentiles; rich and poor, etc.

Obey. Not to those that talk of him, nor hear him in the preaching of the
Gospel, as 2 These. 1.8 but to those that obey him.

Why does he not say, to them that believe? because obedience is the
touchstone of faith. As the tree is known by the fruits: So faith by obedience.

As Christ obeyed, Verse 8. So must we.

Our Savior Christ is the Author of salvation, not to all that talk of him,
etc. It is a good thing to come to Church, hear the Word, receive the
Sacraments, etc. Yet we must not set down our staff here: for if we will
obtain eternal salvation, we must obey him. Every one that says unto me,
Lord, Lord, shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that does the
will of my Father. Not the hearers of the law, but the doers of it shall be
justified. Obedience is better than sacrifice. As a Physician is the cause of
health, to those patients that will follow his directions and obey him: So
CHRIST is the Author of salvation unto all those that obey him.

Let us examine our obedience. Christ wills us to avoid sins, that cause his
Gospel to be ill spoken of: by good works to adorn it, to stop the mouths
of the adversaries, etc. Do we so? does not drunkenness, covetousness,
pride, malice, and uncleannes abound? As they said and promised to Joshua: So
let us to Christ. Ios. 1.16.
Whatsoever thou command us, we will do, and whither soever thou sendest
us, we will go. Does Christ command us to abandon covetousness, which is
Idolatry and the root of all evil? then let us not be glewed to the world.
Does he forbid us drunkenness, malice, pride, etc. Let us have no fellowship
with these unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reproove them; let us
forsake father and mother, etc. and follow him: for without obedience there is
no salvation.

How must we obey him?

1. Fully. The young man in the Gospel most proudly vaunted, that he had kept
all the Commandments from his youth: let us endeavor, that we may say so in
truth and sincere heart: and as Zachary and Elizabeth, let us walk in all the
Commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.

2. Cheerfully. GOD loves a cheerful giver. I was glad says the Psalm. When
they said, let us go up into the house of the Lord, Psalm. 122.1.

3. Constantly. A runner has not the prize, till he come to the Gole. A
Taylour has not his wages, till the garment be finished. A Traveller has not
his money, till he come to his journeys end. Here we are as Children, 1 Cor.
13. growing higher and higher, in knowledge, faith, love, obedience, etc. Let
us hold out to the end, running constantly in the way of obedience, that we may
have eternal salvation.

VERSE 10.
COgnominatus -- That his sacrifice being finished, he has this glorious title
given him of God --

Perfectly. So we are called Priests now: but then more justly, offering the
sacrifice of praise for ever.

Hitherto of the lawfulness of his Priesthood. Now he is to proceed to the
excellency of his Priesthood: whereunto, that he might the better stir them
up to attention; he uses a new preface, to prepare their hearts and minds to
it.

There be two lets that hinder him from an immediate proceeding to it.

The one in the matter to be delivered: the other in the persons to whom it is
to be delivered. In the matter, there be too branches: the multiplicity, and
the difficulty of it.

In the hearers there is dullness which is to be removed: proved by the
effects. They that have gone long to the School and have profited but little,
are dull Scholars: but ye have gone a long time to School and profited but
little: which he proves, first simply, then comparatively.

They that must yet be taught the principles of Religion, have profited but
little: but you must yet be taught the principles of Religion.

2. They that stand in need of milk, and are not capable of strong meat, have
made small growth in Christianity: you need milk.

Both the members are severally ratified in the next words; by showing to whom
milk appertains, and to whom strong meat appertains.

VERSE 11.
OR in the Neuter Gender; of the which thing: of Christ being a Priest after
the order of Melchizedec.

Much speech, a long speech that can hardly be shut up in a narrow room, it
must have a large field to walk in. Concerning the person of Melchizedec and
of Christ too, what manner of man Melchizedec was, and why Christ is a Priest,
not after the order of Aaron, but of Melchizedec. Many points are here to be
unfolded, therefore ye had need to be the more attentive. A Scholar that has
many lines or leaves to learn, had need to be more diligent.

2. As they are many: So they are hard and difficult; to be explained and
interpreted for your capacity, that they may be comprehended by you.

1. A Minister must deliver many things to the people, he must not always be
harping upon one string, and the people must prepare themselves to receive many
things.

2. A Preacher must explain and interpret that which he speaks, Nehem. 8.7.

Why be they hard? because ye are dull of hearing: slow. It is a metaphor
taken from lazy Travellours that go slowly. (...) of (...), that cannot
run: tardus asellus. As men are slow in going: So are you in hearing of the
Word of God. And by hearing is not meant the external hearing alone: but the
internal. Slow in conceiving and learning, as is expounded in the next Verse.
Hearing is put for learning (as, hear ye me? understand ye me?) because
knowledge is conveyed by the sense of hearing.

There be many and sundry things, that procure this dullness and slownesse.

1. Carelessness or want of diligence. (...), Matthew. 13.19.

2. A mind possessed with other things, which keep the Gospel out of the
doors: as these were with an high opinion of the ceremonial law and
Leviticall Priesthood. A barrel full of corrupt water cannot receive wine.

3. Want of meditation. Blessed is he that meditateth in the Law of GOD day
and night. Mary pondered Christ's sayings.

4. Want of reading and conferring. The Bereans are highly commended for their
conference one with an other, and searching the Scriptures, Acts 17.

The want hereof is a maine cause of our extreme dullness in hearing.

5. Want of Prayer.

We are apt Scholars for the world, swift to hear news and tales, but slow
and dull in hearing of the Word of God. So that we may justly suffer that check
of our SAVIORS, Luke 24.25. O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that
the Prophets have spoken.

VERSE 12.
TIme. Having had the Scripture so long, which other nations have not, Romans
3.2. Ioh. 14.9.


To whom the Gospel was preached, before it was to the Gentiles, Matthew. 10.5.
Luke 24.47.

Teachers. Not public: for Ephesians. 4.11. but private. Teachers of your private
families, and one of another. Then he would have said, ye might, not ye
ought: for all are not bound to be Preachers.

He does not say, ye may have need: but, ye have need.

Whereas they were taught you long ago.

Not profound points and deep mysteries. The elements are the first things,
whereof bodies be made: So there be certain common points, concerning God,
Christ, Faith, etc. Which are the beginnings of Religion: rudimenta, quibus
pueri erudiuntur.

Not of the midst or latter end, but of the beginning: of the oracles of God.
We had need to begin with the A. B. C. again.

1. They that have had the Word a long time have the more to answer for.

2. Christians must also be teachers one of another: Not as, Iac. 3.1.

3. We must not be as those, 2 Timothy 3.7. ever learning, but never be able to
come to the knowledge of the truth.

Milk is fit for Children, because it is thin, warm, easy of digestion,
needs no teeth to chew it, which infants want, and is soon converted into the
substance of the body.

You are such babes in Religion, that ye need milk still: strong meat is not
for you, 1 Cor. 3.2. Isaiah 55.1. 1 Pet. 2.2. (...): through your own
negligence.

It is a shame for a great boy or a man to be fed with milk: for the nurse to
take a spoone and put milk into his mouth: fie on it. Cease to be children:
become perfect men, that stronger meat may be delivered to you.

VERSE 13.
PArtaker: have been never so long an hearer.

Though he be a Gentleman, etc.

That must be catechized still in the principles of Religion.

Has no skill, experience, knowledge.

Not righteous Word: but, the Word of righteousness; which teaches
righteousness. Romans 1.17.

That* cannot speak: a babe in religion. We must be babes in sincerity and
humility, Matthew 18.3. Not in knowledge, Ephesians. 4.14. 1 Cor. 14.20. CHRIST was
a babe, but grew in stature. Saul profited much in his sect: So must we make
some progress in Religion.

VERSE 14.
THat which makes the body strong.

Strong meat, that is deep and profound Points of religion: which have aspired
to some ripeness of age in Christ JESUS: who are described by a special
propriety.

Wherein must their senses be exercised? in the Scripture, as appears by the
opposition. They that use milk, are inexpert in the word of righteousness: but
they that use strong meat, are exercised in the word of righteousness, that
they may be able to discern between doctrine and doctrine.

Here we see what must be the exercise of Christians, that are of some
ripeness of age in Christ; they must be exercised through long custom, in the
sacred Scripture: search the Scripture. Searching requires our time and
diligence. Saul was seeking of Asses a good while: and shall not we spend many
days and years in seeking CHRIST in the Scripture? be thou in these things,
says St. Paul to Timothy. The Lawyers are exercised through long custom in
the volume of the Law: they can quote statute on statute for the space of many
hundred years. The Physicians are exercised in Galen and Hippocrates: the
Philosophers in Plato and Aristotle: the Mathematicians in Ptolomy and Euclide:
but we that be Christians, must be exercised in the Word of God. Yet this is
little practiced by us. We are exercised through long custom in our trades
and occupations, in buying and selling none shall go beyond us in them. The
husbandman is exercised in tillage, in making the best of his corn: the
Clothyer is exercised in his trade, the Weaver in his: the Merchant in his: Of
a long custom we are experienced in those things that belong to the world: but
few are so exercised in the Scripture, as they ought to be. Nay, that which is
to be lamented, sundry are exercised through long custom, in quaffing and
swilling, in lying, swearing, etc. but little exercised in the Scripture.

Now the merry time of the year approaches, wherein we invent many exercises
to pass time away withal: of carding, dicing, gaming. But I will commend to
you a most excellent exercise, that far surmounts them all. Have your senses
exercised through a long custom in the word of righteousness: spend time
these Holy days in reading of Scripture, that ye may not be children, but
men of wisdom and understanding to discern between good and evil.

The touchstone to discern pure gold from that which is counterfeit, is the
Word of God. The day discernes between a tree and a man. In a dark night we
may imagine a tree to be a man; but when the day comes, it is easily
discerned. So the Word of GOD is the bright day and glorious sunshine, whereby
we discern truth from false-hood, sound doctrine from that which is corrupt
and heretical. Therefore let us exercise ourselves in Gods Word continually,
that we may discern between the purity of the Gospel, and the impurity of
Popery, and all Errors and Heresies whatsoever: that being enlightened by the
candle of the word, we may see, and take the way that leads to the kingdom
of heaven.

CHAP. 6.
BEfore, we had Saint Paul's objurgation, that they were so great non
proficients in the School of Christ. Now follows an exhortation to prick them
forwards to greater perfection in Religion.

Where, 1. The substance of the exhortation. 2. The pressing and urging of it
by four arguments. 1. A ridiculo. 2. Ab exemplo. 3. A Deo. 4. A periculo.

1. From a ridiculous absurdity, set forth by a comparison.

2. From an enumeration of the chief rudiments which they are to leave.

3. From the efficient cause of the spiritual progress, which they are to
make, namely God.

4. From a fearful danger that will ensue; if upon a careless neglect, or
contempt of the heavenly doctrine they stand at a stay, and go not forward: by
that means they may go backward, and at the length may fall into the sin
against the Holy Ghost. Therefore it stands: them in hand, in fear and
humility to aspire to perfection daily more and more.

VERSE 1.
THe exhortation has two branches. 1. What they are to leave. 2. What they are
to contend unto. 1. Terminus a quo. 2. Terminus ad quem.

Seeing it is a shame, always to be babes; let us as men grown, seek after
stronger meat.

The principles.i. that which begins us and enters us into Christianity,
leaving that: How? Not casting it for ever behind our backs: suffering it
quite to slip out of our memories, never thinking of it any more: we must
remember even the principles of Religion, to our dying day, but we must not
insist in those, and set down our staff here, but as good travellours go on
forwards. As if one should say to a Grammar Scholar, leave thy Grammar and go
to Logic, Rhetoric, Philosophy, to more deep and profound points of
learning; his meaning is, not that he should leave his Grammar quite, and
never think on it any more, but that he should pass from that to greater
matters. As if one should say to a Traveller going to London, that sits eating
and drinking at Colchester: leave Colchester, and go on to London: So leave
this doctrine of the beginning of Christianity, leave your A. B. C. be not
always beginners, but proceed, till ye come to some maturity.

Let us go on to perfection, with all cheerfulness and celerity. Both we
that are the teachers, and you that are to be taught by us: that we may aspire
to perfection daily more and more.

We cannot go of ourselves, we must be led, namely by the hand of GOD
Almighty: as little Children cannot go, unless their mothers and nurses lead
them. Let us therefore entreat the Lord to lead us forward by the hand of his
spirit to perfection daily more and more. We cannot climb up to the highest
staire of the ladder of perfection in this world: we must be climbing all the
days of our life. Saint Paul was rapt into the third heaven: yet he professed
he was not yet perfect. We know in part, we believe in part, and we must be as
Scholars learning of our part, so long as we live. Though with Moses we have
been brought up in all the learning of the Egyptians, though we be as
perfect Scribes in the law of GOD, as Ezra: as eloquent and mighty in
Scripture as Apollos, though we have as many tongues as Saint Paul, who spoke
with tongues more than they all did, yet we must be carried on still to
perfection: we must be as Travellours, that are ever walking and going on and
on, never resting till we come to our journeys end, which will not be till
death it self shall come. Our SAVIOR himself, as he was a man, did grow up
in wisdom; and shall any of us think our selves so wise that we need not
to grow in wisdom? Let us all go on forwards to perfection every day more
and more.

The first reason is taken from a ridiculous absurdity, set forth by a
comparison.

Not laying again (...), quasi (...), because foundations are laid exceeding
deep in the earth. All men laugh at those builders that are always laying the
foundation, but never set up the Walls, lay on the roof, tyle, and glaze the
house, etc. but every day are laying the foundation. Those be foolish
builders. So we that be Christians, must not always be laying the foundation of
religion, but we must build up ourselves as a glorious house to the Lord.

Then he sets down the particular stones of this foundation, which we must
not ever be laying: he reckons up the chief points of the Christian
catechism, which all ought to have at their fingers ends, which it is a shame
to be ever learning. Of these, some concern this life; some, the life to come:
they that appertain to this life are private, or public.

1. Repentance, which is illustrated by the things we are to repent of.

There be living works, which we do when CHRIST lives in us; these are not
to be repented of, but to be practiced by us: and there be dead works, which
be sins, and are so called, 1. Because they come from dead men, that are dead
in trespasses and sins. 2. Because they tend to death and destruction, the
wages of sin is death. Romans 6.23.


All sins are dead works: covetousness, malice, pride, drunkenesse,
uncleanness, lying, swearing, etc. are dead works: therefore let us have
nothing to do with them. Men are afraid to touch dead bodies, or to come near
them, we fly away from a dead and stinking carcass. Every sin is a dead
carcass, that sends up an unsavory smell into the nostrills of God: therefore
let it be abhorred by us all: let us turn away our eyes and hearts too from
all dead works.

Repentance has two parts: the mortification of sin, and vivification to
newness of life, Isa. 1.16. Zacheus repented him, when he left his peeling and
griping and became a liberal man, made restitution to those whom he had
defrauded, and gave the one half of his goods to the poor. Peter repented of
his denial of Christ, when he did not only weep bitterly for it, for a time,
but stood in defense of Christ, to the very death. Then an adulterer repents of
his adultery, when he leaves quite his Whores and harlots, and possesses his
vessel in holiness and honor. Repentance is a forsak^ng of the sin, and an
embracing of the contrary virtue.

It is not the laying aside of sin for a time, as a man does his Coat at
night, and puts it on again in the morning: but it is an utter relinquishing
of sin, a shaking of it off, as St. Paul did the viper, never resuming it
again.

It is not a changing of sin, but a putting away of sin. Then a man has
repented, when of an old creature, he is made a new. It is not only a sorrow
for sin, a weeping and howling for sin, though these be good steps to
repentance. Caine was grieved for his sin. Esau howled for it. Judas was
pierced with the dart of sorrow for it: but it is an abandoning of the sin.
There may be (...), where there is not (...).

This is one of the principles of religion, as it were a piece of our A.B.C.
John Baptist cried, Mark. 1.^5.
repent -- Matthew. 3.2. Our Savior in his own person at his first entrance
into the Ministry preached it, after his resurrection enjoined the preaching
of it to his Disciples, Luke 24.47. and it was the subject of St. Peter's Sermon
at the day of Pentecost, Acts 2.38. Which doctrine of repentance in respect of
practice ought to sound continually in the Pulpit, but not in respect of
knowledge. But it is to be feared that many, where the Word has been long
preached, are ignorant of it, at the least we do not practice it as we ought
to do: we must be repenting in act continually the best of us all; but we must
not always be learning the doctrine of repentance.

The consideration of our dead works and manifold sins might carry us into the
pit of destruction therefore follows faith in Christ, by whom we have the
remissi^n of them.

And of faith toward GOD, that is faith in the LORD JESUS CHRIST, as St. Paul
exhorts the Iaylour, Act. 16.31.

Some interpret it, what we are to believe of God: but then he would have
said, (...), rathe^ than (...). 2. Then this branch might have served for all
the rest, and so all the other might have b^ene bury^d in silence.

It is called faith toward GOD in general, though the special object of
faith be Christ, which is God, as well as the Father and the Holy Ghost.

VERSE 2.
AFter that men had testified their faith and repentance, they were baptized,
incorporated into the Church, and publicly gave up then names unto Christ.

But why does he speak of baptismes in the plural number? When as Ephesians. 4.5.
There is but one baptism.

Not because men were wont oftentimes to be baptized. As we are borne once: So
baptized but once. They were but once circumcised, in the time of the law: and
we are but once baptized, in the time of the Gospel.

1. By the negligence of the Printers, (...) might quickly be turned into
(...). The Syriack reads it in the singular number, and so does Augustine de
fide and oper. cap. n. Yet because this reading has been of a long and
ancient continuance: let it remain unchanged.

Some think he names baptismes, because diverse kinds of persons were wont to
be baptized, infants and elder folk.

Others, because certain times were appointed to baptism, as Easter and
Whitsuntide.

Others, in regard of the three immersions that were used in baptism, to
signify the Trinity. Baptism properly is a dipping: the party was wont to be
three times dipped in the water: and therefore he calls it baptismes or
dippings.

Some, because there was a baptizing into Christ to come, which John used, and
a baptizing into Christ already come, which the Apostles used after Christ's
Ascension.

Rather, because the Apostle alluding to the manifold baptismes or washings in
the law, calls the Christian Sacrament baptismes too: therefore he calls it
the doctrine of baptismes, because many doctrines, as it were many baptismes,
are contained in it.

And of laying on of hands. There were diverse uses of this ceremony.

1. He that offered a sin offering, laid his hands on it, to signify, that
he was the sinner for whom it was offered.

2. It was a sign of healing, Luke 4.40. Mark. 16.18.

3. By it the extraordinary gifts of the HOLY GHOST were conferred. Acts 8.17.


4. By it men were ordained to the Ministry, 1 Timothy 4.14. This was a necessary
point to be catechized in, that all might know the authority of the sacred
Ministry, and reverence it. How can they hear without a Preacher?

5. It was used in the blessing, Mark. 10.16.

6. It was a custom in the Primitive Church: when the Children had been well
instructed in their Catechism, and given notice of their knowledge to the
Church, then by the laying on of hands they were confirmed and approved and
allowed to come to the Lords Supper: at the which laying on of hands public
prayer was made by the congregation for them, that they might proceed in the
race of Christianity, as they had begun, to Gods glory and the advancement of
the Gospel. This was called Confirmation, and this we still retain in our
Church. The Church of Rome prefers it before baptism. In baptism, say they,
we have our esse: in Confirmation a more perfect esse. Every hedge Priest may
baptize: only a Bishop or a Suffragan may confirm ex jure divino. A Priest may
not do it, nisi per dispensationem, says Bellar.

This seems to be employed in this place: and a good use might be made of it
still among Christians: our race being finished in this life, we look for the
resurrection and judgment in the life to come.

It is a worthy saying, Ioh. 5.28. Mervaile not at this: for the hour is
coming, in the which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice: yet the
Philosophers and wise men of this world mock at the resurrection, and count it
an impossible thing. When Paul preached CHRIST and the resurrection at Athens,
they laugh at it: and it may be, so do some close Atheists that sit in the lap
of the Church. But there be four Pillars for the Resurrection to lean upon.

1. The Power of God. 2. The Justice of God. 3. The Solemn funerals. 4. The
Resurrection of CHRIST.
For the first; Idoneus est reficere, qui fecit: he that made man at the first
of the dust of the ground, can fetch him out of the ground again when he is
quite consumed to dust and ashes: he that made an house, can set it up again
though it be defaced. God made this body, the house of clay: therefore he can
erect it again though pulled down.

The second pillar is the Justice of God. If there were no resurrection, God
should be unjust. The wicked flourish in this world, their eyes stick out by
reason of fatness: they have more than heart can wish: they are not in trouble
as other men. Baals Priests in some parts of the world, sit at Iesabels table,
when the Lords Prophets live in a Cave with bread and water: the rich glutton
fared deliciously, when Lazarus lay starving and full of sores at his gate:
ever under one Cross or another. If there were no resurrection where this
should be righted, that sentence of the Psalmist might be inverted, verily
there is no reward for the righteous: verily there is no God that judges in
the earth. Psalm. 58. ult.


The third pillar is the Solemn funerals that be in all nations. All which
are so many glasses, wherein we may behold the resurrection.

When we go to a buryall, we go to a sowing: the seed that is sown lies
covered in the earth all winter, in the spring it shoots up again, and a
goodly harvest arises of it: So the body is sown in corruption, it rises in
incorruption, more beautiful, then ever it was before.

The fourth pillar is that which Saint Paul urges to Christians, 1 Cor. 15.12.
Christ is risen: therefore we shall rise. As Jonas was three days and three
nights in the Whales belly: So Christ was three days and three nights in the
heart of the earth: on Thursday he kept his Maundy, he eat the Passover and
supper with his Disciples: on good Friday he suffered and was crucified: all
Saturday being the Jews Sabbath, he lay in the earth: on Sunday morning, the
first day of the week, the Lords day, the Lord Jesus rose triumphantly from
the dead; and this is the day of his resurrection: on this day he rose
victoriously from the dead. This is the day that the Lord has made, let us
rejoice and he glad in it: for Christ's resurrection is a pledge of ours. The
first fruits are in heaven: therefore the second fruits shall be there: the
head is in heaven, therefore the members shall be there. The Husband is in
heaven: therefore the Wife shall be in heaven also: we shall mee^e him with
joy in the clouds, and be translated with him into the kingdom of glory, and
abide with him for ever.

After the resurrection comes judgment: it is appointed to men once to dye,
and then comes the judgment. Death were nothing, if there were no judgment.
The Assi^es were nothing, if there were nothing, if there were no Gallows, no
execution: but as we must arise, so we must all appear before the judgment
seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, 2 Cor.
5.10.
according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad. Let us all think
seriously of this eternal judgment.

It is called eternal judgment. 1. Because it is of things eternal, eternal
life or eternal death. 2. Because the sentence of that judgment is eternal,
the force and power thereof remains ever, both to the elect and reprobate:
they all go eternally to the place appointed by the Judge. 3. Because the
Judge is eternal. 4. Because the persons judged are eternal. Some are to
enjoy eternal happiness, some to suffer eternal punishment.

The judgment it self is not eternal, that lasts not ever: but the fruit
and event of it is eternal.

Oh that the cogitation of this judgment were deeply fixed in the hearts of us
all! A great number, even in the lap of the Church, laugh at it in the closet
of their hearts: the Preachers talk much of a general judgment that shall be
after this life but if God let us alone till that day, we shall do well
enough. GOD grant we may escape the judgments here, a fly for that judgment.
Yet Felix himself trembled at (...) when Saint Paul spoke of righteousness
and the judgment to come; though he were a judge himself, he quaked at it.
Let us all fear this eternal judgment after an holy and religious manner,
and tremble at it. In these judgments we may have Lawyers to plead for us:
then none shall be for us, all against us, especially our own consciences as a
thousand Lawyers and witnesses, if our sins are not washed away in the blood
of CHRIST. Therefore let us judge our selves here, that we be not judged by
the Lord hereafter* let us bewail our sins here, that we come not into the
place where is weeping, wayling and gnashing of teeth for ever.

Let us remember this eternal judgment, that it may be as a bridle to
restrain us from sin. That godly Father, St. Hierome, professed of himself,
whether he did eat or drink, or whatsoever he did, this trumpet rang always
in his ears, surgite mortui, venite adjudicium. When we go to bed in the
evening, when we arise in the morning, when we are about the affairs of our
calling, when Satan provokes us to stealing, lying, coofening, purloyning, etc.
Let us remember this eternal judgment, let us call our selves to an account
for our sins in this world repent seriously of them: let us cast away our sins,
not as we do our coats when we go to bed, and put them on again in the
morning: but throw them away, and have no fellowship with these unfruitful
works of darkness; then we shall have fellowship with Christ, both in this
life, and in the life to come: then we shall not need to fear this eternal
judgment. The Judge is our SAVIOR, our elder brother, our head, our husband
to whom we are married: therefore we may lift up our heads at that day, because
our redemption is at hand; we may rejoice at his coming, for we shall sit on
the bench with him and judge the world, and reign with him for ever.

The Jesuits collect from hence, that the Christians had a Catechism delivered
to them by tradition, which they learned before they were acquainted with the
Scriptures. If every one should pick his faith out of the Scripture, there
would be madd rule.

Indeed if they had such heads as the Papists have, that are bold to call the
Scripture a nose of Wax --

But to answer.

1. These Hebrews to whom St. Paul writes, were exercised in the Scripture:
for Romans 3.2. Unto them were committed the oracles of God.

2. Here is nothing in this Catechism, but is derived out of the Scripture.

3. How shall men pick their faith out of the Paternoster, Ave-Mary, etc.
being in an unknown tongue?

Here we have a short Catechism consonant to the Scripture, that was used in
the Primitive Church: Such as is at this day, the Lords prayer, the ten
Commandments, and the Articles of our belief. These be profitable points; but
we that profess the Gospel must not always be in these: they are to be
propounded continually in the Church unto Children, to them that be rude and
ignorant; but Christians must not dwell in these, we must be carried to
perfection, till we come to a ripe age in CHRIST JESUS: we must be able to
answer all Heretics and gaine-sayers, and to defend the sacred truth of
Christ his Gospel against them all.

VERSE 3.
LEst he should seem to have presumed upon his own strength, when he said,
let us be lead forward to perfection, here he refers all to God, that must
be the leader of us all: he must give us feet to walk to perfection by.

We: both we that are to teach, and you that are to be taught.

The presumptuous boldness of those men, Iac. 4. is utterly to be condemned,
that say peremptorily; we will go to such a City, buy and sell, and get gain:
whereas there should be an ( If) always in our determinations, either
expressed or understood; we will do this or that, if God permit. I will go
to the Church and hear a Sermon, if God permit. I would go home to my house
and take my dinner, if God permit. I will go to bed and sleep quietly, I will
rise betimes in the morning and go about my business. I will refresh my self
in such an honest sport and pastime. I will increase in knowledge, etc. If God
permit. The servant must always say, I will do this or that, if my master
will give me leave; a subject must say, if the King will. God is our Master and
Sovereign, therefore let us presume to do nothing without him. Let us never
reckon without this our heavenly Fathers leave Iac. 4.15. 1 Cor. 16.7. Let us
always refer our selves to his blessed will. In him we live, breath, and
have our being: he may take the breath out of our nostrils, while we are
speaking; he may strike us with lamenesse, while we are going: he may bereave
us of our wits and senses, while we are learning: therefore let us do every
thing, if God permit, and without his permission let us attempt nothing. We
will not tarry always in our Catechism, but we will be deep Scholars in
divinity, if God permit.

Gods permission is not a naked sufferance, but an helping and assisting of us
by his grace. The constable may permit a man to pass, and yet give him nothing
toward his passage.

The King may permit one of his Subjects to go beyond Sea, and yet furnish him
with nothing for his journey: but as God permits us to do a thing, so he
aides us by his power to the doing of it. If God not only gives us leave, but
also assists us by his holy Spirit and grace, we will go on to perfection.

VERSE 4.
1. A Description of them that sin against the Holy Ghost.

2. A persuasion that the Hebrews are none of them.

They that sin against the Holy Ghost are described,

1. Simply. 2. Comparatively. In the simple description of them. 1. God his
bounty. 2. Their ingratitude. 3. The punishment. 1. An enumeration of the
graces wherewith God has adorned them. 2. Their ungracious falling from them.
3. The punishment inflicted on them for it.

In the enumeration of the graces. 1. A narration of them. 2. An illustration
of them.

The graces are in number two: the one for the understanding; the other for the
will, heart or affections.

For the understanding: they were once enlightened by the bright beams of the
Gospel, the Sun of righteousness Jesus Christ shining in their hearts: in
so much as they see plainly the work of man's redemption performed by him,
acknowledge it, confess and profess it, and embrace it with a kind of joy.

2. For the heart: they have tasted of the heavenly gift, that is either
Christ, who Ioh. 4.10. Is called the gift of God: or of faith in him, which
(...) is the gift of God, Ephesians. 2.8. They have a taste of that faith, and what an
excellent thing it is to be ingraffed into Christ.

Which faith is an heavenly, not any earthly gift. It comes from heaven, not
from earth, Iac. 1.17. Every good and perfect gift is from above, and comes
down from the Father of lights.

Then follows the illustration of them, by the causes and the effects.

1. By the efficient cause, which is the Holy Ghost, 1 Cor. 2.10. but God has
revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the spirit searches all things, yea,
the deep things of God. And the Apostle here affirms of them, that they were
made partakers of the Holy Ghost.

Aquin.
Partakers, participes: partem capientes: for Christ has him totally. We have
the Spirit in part and in measure: he was given to Christ totaliter, to us
partialiter.

Therefore it is called the sin against the Holy Ghost, not because it is
committed against his deity or person, as some Heretics have done, which
denied the Holy Ghost to be God, and no subsisting person by himself: but
because it is committed against the office of the Holy Ghost, which is, to
reveal the mysteries of God to us.

VERSE 5.
THe isntrumental cause is the Word of GOD, whereof they have a taste. Such
were the stony hearers, Luke 8.13. Who received the word with joy: and such
also were John Baptists auditors, who rejoiced in his light for a season, Ioh.
5.35.

It is called a good Word, Pro. 12.23. Sweet. (...), Nunc dicenda bono sunt
bona verba die. The Gospel is opposed to the law which is sower: this is
sweeter than honey.

This cannot be meant of CHRIST* de verbo increato: for in the Greek it is
(...), not (...): but it must be understood, de verbo creato: doctrinam
evangelicam, Ambrose interprets it.

2. It is illustrated by the effects.

And the powers of the world to come. So that there is no true felicity in this
world, but is to be expected in the world to come.

The joys of heaven are called powers.

1. In regard of their stablenesse and perpetuity: they are so full of might
and power, as that no power of the enemy can over^hrow them.

2. Because they have a powerful effect in men's hearts to affect and allure
them, quid possit futurum saeculum? The consideration of the joys and pains
to come makes them to forsake sin, and to walk in the ways of Godliness.
Oecumen.

3. Because they require a mighty power to bring us to them.

VERSE 6.
FAll, Prolapsi.i. procul lapsi. Gorr. Totaliter lapsi: The just man falls
seven times a day, but he rises again, (...), fall besides. Pro. 24.16.
If a man fall on the bridge, he may rise again; if he falls besides it, he is
drowned. Vltra cadunt. Cajet.

If they shall fall away, from all these points of doctrine mentioned before,
if they reject the doctrine of repentance, counting it but a policy to keep
men in awe withal; if they reject the doctrine of faith, counting it but a
mere and idle device; that will have no use of the sacred Ministry, to the
which men were consecrated by the imposition of hands; that say, baptism is of
no force, the water in the river is as good as the water in the font; if they
make a mock at the resurrection and the day of judgment: it is impossible
they should be renewed again unto repentance.

But what is every man in the state of damnation, and does he sin against the
HOLY GHOST, that being once enlightened, etc. falls away?

Noe. All falling after knowledge is not the sin against the Holy Ghost. Noah
fell, Lot, David, Solomon, etc. In many things we sin all. The just man
falls seven times a day. Saint Paul would have the incestuous person
restored. It is not (...), but (...): the elect cannot sin against the Holy
Ghost, neither do all the reprobate sin against the Holy Ghost.

They that sin against the Holy Ghost, must fall toti, a toto, and in totum.

1. The Elect fall but in part: either in their understanding or their will;
they that commit this sin fall wholly, in their understanding and will too:
they obscure the light which they have received, choke the good motions that
were in them, with their whole will, might and maine run against the truth
they professed. When Saint Paul was a persecutor, he sinned in respect of his
understanding, upon ignorance: but he did not persecute Christ with a malicious
mind. Peter fell upon infirmity, but not upon malice: in his will in part,
but not in his understanding and will too. They that commit the horrible sin
against the Holy Ghost; are set with their understanding and will, yea with all
their forces against the truth. Hence it is called blasphemia spiritus, Mat.
12.31. because it is with the spirit and mind of man in soul and body. (...)
is to fall voluntarily: with the Hebrew Greek and Latinists, procidere.

2. They must fall a toto, from all the former gifts, not from some one part of
the celestial doctrine and calling, but from the whole body of the doctrine
that concerns salvation, maliciously resisting it.

A man may fall on his knees, yet not on the whole body: So a man may fall from
some one fundamental point, though not from the whole body of the heavenly
calling: as many Heretics do. But these fall from the whole.

3. They must fall in totum, wholly and finally without recoverie.

Psalm. 37.24.
The godly man says in the Prophet; though I fall, I shall rise again, for the
Lord puts to his hand: these fall and never rise again, because God denies
them his hand.

Then follows the punishment. Where, 1. The grievousnesse of it. 2. The
equity of it.


They cannot be made new men again: they were once new men, at least in show;
having lost that new Coat, they cannot have another: they cannot be cast into
a new mould again, (...), it is an active. Some expound it, they cannot renew
themselves: so Erasmus. Some understand (...), that any Minister should renew
them; some (...); that God should renew them, because God cannot deny himself,
and that were an impotency, rather then a power, Tit. 1.2. 2 Timothy 2.13.

Impossible: because it is repugnant to the will of GOD; Dei posse est velle,
non posse nolle, Luke 1.37. Mark. 10.27. he does not say, (...), it is not
meet, not profitable, not convenient, but (...), impossible: (...), to drive
them into desperation. Chrysostom.

The Jesuits interpret it hard. It is an hard matter for them to be renewed,
but it is not impossible. Yet their own gloss says, non tantum difficile,
and Verse 8. their end is to be burned, they must burn for ever in hell.

Impossible: non difficile. Difficile est, quod quamvis cum labor, Ambr.
fieri potest; impossible, quod fieri non potest. So they cannot be renewed.
1. It implies a weakness. 2. A contradiction. So that it is not only hard and
difficult, but impossible that God should renew them to repentance.

By Repentance: is repugnant to the words. Of all other sins men may repent:
but not of this, 2 Timothy 2.25. Repentance is the gate whereby we must enter
into heaven; the very door and entrance is denied to them: therefore no
mervaile though the house be denied to them. If they could repent, they might
be saved: for at what time soever a sinner repents of his sins from the
bottom of his heart, the Lord will blot them out of his remembrance. But it is
impossible for them to repent: their hearts are hardened. And thou according to
the hardness of thy heart that cannot Repent, treasurest up to thy self wrath
against the day of wrath, Romans 2. ver. 5.

They have cast off GOD, and GOD has, cast off them: they may have an horror
in the Conscience for their sins, they may peradventure weep, howl and cry
for them: yet they do not repent. They are not pierced with true sorrow for
sin, they grieve for the fearful, and endless torments which they are to
sustain for their sins, but grieve not for sin, as it is sin: they are
grieved, that they are fallen into the hands of GOD as a judge, but are not
sorrowful that they have offended him as a Father. For any other sin GOD may
give Repentance unto men: but for this he will not. Oh horrible sin! GOD may
give Repentance for all other sins: yet he is not bound to do it. The King
may pardon burglarie, or for breaking into an house, yet he is not bound to
it. So GOD may give men Repentance for thefts, murders, adulteries,
drunkenness, etc. Yet none can challenge this at his hands. Therefore let none
presume to commit any sin whatsoever in hope of Repentance: this is no good
argument, no sound conclusion in Divinity; they that sin against the HOLY
GHOST cannot repent, therefore they that fall into any other sin, may repent at
their pleasure: a man is not sure to have Repentance for foolish idle words,
for wicked and unclean thoughts: i^ is in GODS hands: the pearl of Repentance
lies in his treasury. Thou may be stricken with the dart of sudden death,
while thou art sinning: therefore let not the hope of Repentance be as a
loadestone to draw thee to sin: Repentance is a singular thing, that will
open the lap of Gods mercy and the doors of the kingdom of heaven too.
Manasseh had been a monstrous Idolater, yet upon repentance he was received
to mercy. David had committed Adultery and Murder, yet on repentance they were
remitted: the Thief on the Cross had been a bad liver all the days of his
life, yet upon repentance he was taken into Paradise. There were some that
crucified CHRIST the Lord of life, being pricked in their hearts for it, were
embraced in the arms of mercy: the Prodigal Son that had spent all his
substance on harlots, yet when he came to his father with that doleful and
penitent voice, I have sinned against heaven and before thee -- his father fell
on his neck and kissed him: but they that sin against the Holy Ghost can
never repent, and therefore can have no mercy, neither in this life nor in that
which is to come: O fearful sin! the Lord in mercy keep us all from it.

If at any time we have sinned, as in many things we sin all: Let us pray to
God that we lie not in our sins, but that our hearts may quickly smite us for
them, as David's did; that we may fly to the throne of grace with broken
hearts and contrite spirits, that so we may find favor in this life by Jesus
Christ, that came into the world to save sinners, and eternal happiness with
him in the life to come.

Now follows the manner of the punishment, and the guilt of it. (...): to
their own condemnation, Romans 2.5. But after thy hardness and impenitent heart
treasurest up unto thy self wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of
the righteous Judgment of GOD.

There can be no renewing but by the death of Christ: now Christ dyed and was
crucified once for all that believe and abide in him. If any fall quite away
from CHRIST, they cannot be renewed, unless CHRIST be crucified again: but
that is impossible: therefore, the other, That they should be renewed to
repentance.

They tread under foot the Son of God, Hebr. 10.29. The greatest indignity
that can be offered: greater than to spit in a man's face. The foot is the
lowest member of the body: they will have Christ the King of Kings under their
feet, the greatest contempt that can be: before, they had an honorable opinion
of him, that he was the Son of God, the Savior of the world: but now they
count basely of him.

They count the blood of the Testament a profane thing: what is the blood of
Christ shed on the Cross? the blood of a malefactor is as good as that: o
horrible blasphemy! And despise all the graces of the spirit, which they have
received. And put him to an open shame: exemplificantes make a mock, Matthew.
1.19. Then Joseph her husband being a just man, and not willing to make her a
public example: as those, that be made public examples, and pointed at by
all: exposing him to the reproachful death of the Cross, on the which he was
derided of all: or CHRIST being once crucified and dead, is made immortal, and
living for ever. To crucify him again were to make him mortal again, which
were an egregious mockery.

Or, they despise CHRIST once crucified, and would feign have him to be
crucified for them again, which is to make a mock of him.

Or, it may be a reason drawn from the malice of men, seeing they are so
spitefully set against Christ, as that they could find in their hearts to
crucify him again, if it lay in their power, and so to make him a
mocking-stocke to all the world, accounting the crucifying of CHRIST to be but
a ridiculous thing, to make sport withal, of no moment to life eternal:
therefore it is impossible they should be restored. As much as lies in them,
they crucify the Son of GOD, and make a mock of Him: which are such
horrible sins, as that GOD cannot in justice give them Repentance for them.

Now he describes them that sin against the Holy Ghost comparatively: he sets
them out by a lively similitude taken from the earth. As the earth, that is
painefully tilled, and has plentiful rain powered down on it, and yet for
all that instead of good fruit brings forth pricking thorns, and scratching
brambles, is good for nothing but to be burnt: So those men who having bin
washed with many sweet showers of the Word of God, and enriched with diverse
excellent graces, yet prooving pricking thorns in the end, hurtful to men and
God too, they are good for nothing but to burn in hell fire for evermore.

Before he comes directly to this lamentable end of the reprobates, he does
illustrate it by a comfortable Antithesis in the good and godly, which might
provoke them with all cheerfulness to contend to perfection in Religion.

VERSE 7.
THe Protasis only is set down: the Apodosis is to be supplied.

1. For the Protasis: The earth, which is apparent to us all, none can be
ignorant of it. As a thirsty man takes in drink which is dispersed into his
bowels: So does the dry and thirsty earth the rain, she takes it and conveys
it into her bowels.

It comes into the earth: but because it must come upon it, before it can come
into it; therefore the HOLY GHOST uses that phrase not seldom, but often; God
being bountiful to the earth to send it much rain.

(...) brings forth: as a mother her Children, (...) by a Synecdoche is put
for all the fruits of the earth: because the herb is one of the first fruits,
that it brings forth.

Not only herbs, but trees and all kind of corn; for he speaks of such an
earth which is tilled: whereas herbs spring up without tillage.

What manner of fruit? Which does been reponere gratiam, requites the cost and
charges, which the dressers have bestowed on it.

Receives blessing from God: without whose blessing the earth would be as
brass and iron for all the labor of the husbandman: As such an earth is
blessed of God, God blesses it with a rich and plentiful harvest to the joy
and comfort of men; so is it with all those that profit by the Word of God.

For a more particular opening of every branch in the similitude. The earth is
every Christian man and woman in the lap of the Church. Man was taken out of
the earth, and therefore may fitly be resembled to the earth; bad hearers are
called bad ground, and good hearers, good ground, Luke 8. verse 15. The rain
that falls upon it, is the Word of GOD, Deuteronomie 32. ver. 2. Isaiah 55.
ver. 10.

1. Rain comes down from heaven: So the word.

2. Rain comes down to us by the clouds: So the Word by the Preachers.

3. Rain refreshes the earth: So the Word our souls.

4. Rain never returns in vain: So the Word accomplishes that which the Lord
pleases, and prospers in the thing whereunto he sends it; it never returns
void: either we are the better or the worser by it, through our own fault.

The fruits that they bring forth, is increase of knowledge and of all virtues.

The dressers of this ground, are God and the Ministers, Ioh. 15.1. 1 Cor. 3.9.
(...).

The blessing that good hearers receive is a further increase of all graces in
this life: to him that has shall be given, etc. Mat. 13.8. and eternal
blessedness in the life to come. Blessed are they that hear the Word of God,
and keep it.

1. All people are as the ground, that stand in need of the Rain of the Word
of God: the earth must have Rain all the year long, more or less, else it
dries and withers away: So do we if we want the Rain of the Word. In what
a miserable case were they in Israel, when there fell no rain by the space of
three years and six months? and in what a pitiful taking are those towns
and countries, though they feel it not, which want the Rain of the Word of
GOD?

You that have it, be thankful to God for it, and learn to esteem more
highly of this blessing than ye do. If it rain on your wheat and barley in the
due time of the year, ye praise God for it: and will ye not bless him for the
heavenly rain, that falls on your selves to make you fruitful to eternal
life? o magnify God for this rain, without the which ye should be as parched
ground, pitiful to behold.

2. As this rain by the goodness of God falls on you, so let it not pass by
you, as water running from the rocks and stones, but drink it in, that it may
cause you to increase in all virtue. The rain does no good on rocks and
stones, because they cannot receive it in. If your hearts be as stone, hardened
in sin; though ye have never such plenty of this rain, it will do you no
good: therefore drink in the rain of the Word of God, that falls on you at
every Sermon: let not the profitable instructions pass from you, ponder them
and lay them up in your heart, as the Virgin Mary did: let them not slip from
you so soon as you are out of the Church doors, but keep the rain that God
sends you: if it be not a ground rain that goes into the bowels of the
earth, it is to small purpose: and if the rain of the Word do not sink into
the bottom of your hearts, if it go no further then your ears, you shall
reap small benefit by it: therefore drink in this rain, that it may be
fruitful to you all.

3. None can well drink, but they that thirst after drink: if the ground be
not thirsty, it will not drink in the rain. If it be full already, the rain
lies aloft, and makes ponds that are noy some to men: So if ye be full already
of the cares of the world, the pleasures of the flesh, or a windy conceit of
your selves, saying we are rich, we stand in need of nothing; then the rain
of the Word cannot enter into you. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
after righteousness. Though ye have never so much preaching, yet hunger after
the Word of God: he that is full, despises an hony-combe: a full man regards
not a feast, but an hungry man is content with mean fare: though ye have never
so many sweet Sermons, yet if ye be full, though they be as pleasant as an
honey comb, ye will not care for them: therefore bring thirsting souls to
every Sermon, when this rain is powered down on you, that ye may drink it in
to the salvation of you all.

4. The more rain the ground has, the more fruit it ought to yield: the
oftener that any people has had the rain of the Word of God falling on them,
the more plentiful should they be in good works: to whom much is given, of
them much shall be required: you in this town have had much rain, therefore
much is required of you.

5. As it has the rain often, so it must bring forth fruit meet for them by
whom it is dressed: the more dressing, the more fruit, as we look from our
trees and grounds: the dressers are to be respected: ye must love them by whom
God dresseth and tilleth you: ye must have them in singular love for their
work sake: ye must not bring forth such fruit, as shall grieve the dressers,
Hebrews 13. Verse 17.

As ye have this heavenly rain in most plentiful measure, so bring forth
fruits answerable to it: leaves will not serve the turn. CHRIST cursed the
figtree that had nothing but leaves on it: good words, a glorious talking of
Religion, is not sufficient, a show of godliness, is not enough, but we must
have the power of it: as GOD has sent us this rain in abundance, so let us
be abundant in the fruits of righteousness: let us be full of good works;
then will GOD bless us with the increase of his graces in this life, and with
eternal happiness in the life to come. God make us all such blessed ground.

VERSE 8.
THere is also a cursed ground. Let us beware we be not like it.

They that increase not, but decrease, and go backward, are in a miserable
case. Where, 1. The nature and quality of the ground. 2. Gods Judgment on it.


The earth which for all the rain it had, does not bring forth only no fruit
meet for the dressers, but pernicious thorns and briars, it is a reprobate
earth, reproved, disallowed of all, cast away, no man regards it.

He does not say (...), but (...): innuens ejectionem praeter naturam: emittens
velut abortum.

Is nigh unto cursing. What? near and not cursed indeed? as he that is near
hanging, 2 Pet. 3.9. 2 Pet. 2.3.
is not hanged, near drowning, is not drowned. Not so: God may defer his
vengeance for a time, but their damnation sleeps not: they are very near it,
and shall have it in the end. A man sees a ship near sinking: does it
therefore follow, that it sinkes not? Though at that time when he sees it, it
is but a sinking, yet it may sink afterward. So these men at this time are
near unto cursing, yet they shall be cursed afterward indeed: therefore he
speaks peremptorily in the next words: whose end is to be burned. Every man
curses such an earth: and these men are cursed wretches.

As husbandmen burn such an earth as brings forth nothing but thorns and
briars: saepe etiam steriles incendere profuit agros, atque levem stipulam
crepitantibus urere flammis: Matthew. 13.50. Hebr. 10.27. Matthew. 3.12.
So God the true Husbandman will cast this cursed ground, which brings forth
thorns and briars, whereby they prick as much as in them lies Christ Jesus
Himself, and the Holy Ghost too, into that furnace of fire, where is weeping
and gnashing of teeth for ever. Every tree that brings not forth good fruit,
shall be cast into the fire: how much more such bad trees as these?

It is one thing for a ground to bring forth bad corn, an other thing to bring
forth briars: Cockle, darnel and weeds are hurtful: but thorns and briars are
worst of all.

1. They cumber the ground; if they were away, some profitable thing might
spring in their room.

2. If any corn or flowers happen to sprout forth out of the ground where
thorns are, they choke them, and will never suffer them to come to any
maturity.

3. They prick those that handle them, and make the blood run about their
fingers: so the wicked do not only hinder the growth of good things, but they
prick both God and men. As the Canaanites were as pricks in the Israelites
sides, and thorns in their eyes; So are these to God and his Children: they
rail on good men, and are ready to do them all the mischief they can. As
Ahab hated Micajah; so do they: they cannot abide sober and good men: their
hatred stays not here, but it is converted against God himself, they set
their mouths against heaven, they rail on Christ, and his Gospel, they
blaspheme the Holy Ghost, they persequute the truth to the end: If they do it
on ignorance, as Saint Paul did, who thus professes of himself, I was a
blasphemer, a persequutor and injurious, 1 Timothy 1.13.
but I did it ignorantly, and therefore he sinned not against the Holy Ghost;
If they do it on weakness, as St. Peter did, who cursed and swore he knew not
Christ; it is a grievous sin; yet not the sin against the Holy Ghost. An
Eunomian or Macedonian, that deny the deity of the Holy Ghost, may repent and
be received into mercy. Sabelliani or Patripussiani that oppugn his person,
may also repent and be forgiven: but if they do it on malice, then they
commit that sin, that cannot be forgiven in this world, nor that which is to
come: these be the thorns and briars which the Apostle points out in this
place.

Such a cursed earth bringing forth thorns and briars were some of the
Pharisees: they could say of CHRIST, this is the heir; yet they said, let us
kill him. Such a thorn was Alexander the copper-smith, which resisted Saint
Paul's preaching very soar: he set his feet against Saint Paul's feet, he
resisted not his person, but his preaching: not slightly, but vehemently with
might and maine. Such a thorn was Julian, surnamed the Apostata, that fell
quite away: he was baptized into the name of Christ, he was a professor of
the Gospel, and that a zealous one, as it seems: he was a public Reader in
the Church of Nicomedia: who so forward as he? yet afterward he proved a vile
pricking thorn: he washed away baptism with blood in contempt of it, he
abjured Christ, and sacrificed to the Gods of the Gentiles, he scoffed at
Christianity, mocking them that would believe in a crucified God. If they came
to have wrongs righted, he sent them away with a flouting speech; why, your
Master bids you put up wrongs, turn the other check when you be smitten. To
the last gasp he spewed out his malice against Christ: taking the arrow out of
his side, that gave him his deaths wound, he took the blood into his hand,
hurled it up into the air; crying, v^cisti Galilaee: he was but a plain
Galilean with him to the end. These be the special thorns that the Scripture
speaks of in this place, whose end is to burn in hell for evermore. O cursed
ground that has the rain of the Word of God falling on it, and yet brings
forth such thorns! The Lord grant that we be never such ground.

For the preventing of it, let us bring forth good fruit answerable to the
rain that falls on us: let us take heed of the stairs that may carry us
headlong into the sin against the Holy Ghost: let us not be patrons and
defenders of bad men and evil actions, against the light of our conscience:
that is a step to this fearful sin. Let us beware how on any sinister
affection we oppose our selves to the preachers of Gods Word. The Devil by
little and little may cause us to set our selves against the Word of God it
self. Let us not carelessly neglect, or any way contemn, those heavenly points
of doctrine, that are delivered to us. As we have the rain of the Word of God
in great plenty among us, so let us bring forth fruits in some measure worthy
of it, that we may not only escape the fire where these thorns burn, but may
be received into GOD his kingdom, there to reign with him in eternal
happiness for evermore.

VERSE 9.
NOw least they should imagine that they are the men, he shows that they are
persuaded better of them, that they are the elect Children of GOD, and shall
be eternally saved.

Here is, 1. The substance of the persuasion. 2. The foundation on which it is
builded. In the former. 1. The matter of it. 2. A qualification of it, by the
mitigation of the harshnesse of his former speech: that is, a fearful piece
of earth, which thou have mentioned, that brings forth briars and thorns, etc.
do thou take us to be such a ground?

No, says he, be it far from us: we have a better persuasion of you.

Beloved] of God and us too. He winds himself into them by a kind appellation
of them.

He does not say, we expect better things from you, we are in good hope you
will prove better than thus, or the like: but we are persuaded, and nothing can
remove us from this persuasion: we take you to be other manner of men, far
different from the former.

The things that be in them are stark naught, but we persuade our selves
most excellent things of you. They are reprobates, but we are persuaded that
you are the elect Children of God.

This is a goodly commendation, may some say: as if a man seeing a company
going to execution should say to one that stands by him, I am persuaded that
thou art a better man then these.

I, but this is a good persuasion; there are but two sorts of people, godly,
and wicked reprobates; now being persuaded that they are better then the
reprobate, he is persuaded they be elect: and what greater persuasion can there
be then that? therefore he adds, such things as accompany salvation.

Saint Augustine, reads it cohaerentia saluti: ad Crescen.

Such as have salvation: we are persuaded you are in the number of them that
shall be saved.

1. His persuasion is propounded, then strengthened against that which might
seem to overthrow it.

Though, we have somewhat sharply chidden you, and introduced a fearful
example of vile and wicked apostates: a father may set before the eyes of his
child thieves, murderers, drunkards, blasphemers, and yet be persuaded that his
child is none of them: only he does it to warn him, not to tread in their
steps: so, as a loving Father I have told you of these men, yet I am persuaded
better if you.

A Preacher must not always be inveighing against the faults, weaknesses and
imperfections that be among the people, he must sometimes speak kindly and
lovingly to them, manifesting the good opinion he has of them: they are the
fathers of the people, they must be wise and discreet fathers: they must
neither be like to David, that never reproved Adonijah, and said to him, why
do thou so? neither like the contentious woman in the Proverbs, as the
continual droppings of the rain, ever scolding with the people: they must
play the part of the Samaritane, that after Wine which made the wound to smart,
powered in oil, for the suppling of it. So we must sometimes come with the
sharp wine of reprehension: sometimes again with the oil of consolation.
Before, Saint Paul came with salt and vinegar, when he spoke of the reprobate
earth; now he comes with honey and sugar, but we are persuaded better things of
you. Generosus animus magis ducitur, quam trahitur, sweet and comfortable words
will prevail more with some, then rough and hard speeches: both in wisdom
must be used by Gods steward: severity and lenity must be tempered together,
if by any means we may save the people committed to our charge. Before, Saint
Paul like an hard father chode sharply: now he strokes them on the head
again, saying, we are persuaded better things of you.

2. We must have a good and charitable opinion of them, that sit in the lap of
the Church, that subject themselves to the Ministry of the Word, though there
be some defects and blemishes in them. St. Paul judged all in the Church of
Philippi to be the elect Children of God, Phil. 1.7. We must not be too lavish
or too strict in our judgment: some have such large consciences, as that they
are persuaded too well of all, that all in the end shall be saved, yea, even
the Devils themselves: that was the dotage of Origin. And some at this day
cannot be persuaded, that any shall be damned: the lap of their charity is
too wide; and others is too narrow.

They are scant persuaded well of any, but of themselves: they thank God with
the Pharisee, they are not as other men: all others are naught, and they only
are good: but except there appear manifest tokens of reprobation, except they
take an apparent bad course, and the very high way to hell, we must persuade
our selves, that they may appertain to the number of Gods faithful and elect
Children: we are persuaded of our own salvation judicio fidei, and we may be
persuaded of the salvation of others, scientia charitatis: we must not be too
rash in our sentence, as the Barbarians against Saint Paul, doubtless this man
is a murderer. Such a one has these and these faults, doubtless he is the
child of the Devil: if they prosesse the Gospel and have any godly care to
live accordingly, though there be wants in them, we must be well persuaded of
them.

But what was St. Paul's persuasion? did he persuade himself that they were
honest good natured men and the like? Nay, more then so, that they were in the
number of those that should be saved. That young man in the Gospel, was a man
of rare and excellent parts, Mark. 10.21.
he had kept (as he said) all the ten Commandments from his youth, and
Christ loved him: yet there were not things in him that accompanied salvation.
Thou may be a sour Cato, a just and upright Aristides in thy dealings with
men, and yet have not the infallible marks of salvation. It is an excellent
thing, when there be those virtues in men and women that accompany salvation.
Have thou a sharp and pregnant wit? So had Esau, that could wittily descant on
his brothers name. Have thou a brave and eloquent tongue? So had Aeschines,
Tully and Demosthenes. Art thou a fair, comely and beautiful man, as goodly a
man as one shall see in a summers day? So was Absalom. Have thou a reaching and
a politic head? So had Achitophel. Art thou a deep Scholar, a profound
learned man? So was Porphyrie, Lucian, Julian, that never set a foot in the
kingdom of heaven. Labor to have those things that accompany salvation,
faith, hope, zeal, patience, humility, and other graces of the spirit, whereby
we may be persuaded, that you are the dear Children of God. The Lord work
those things in us all, that accompany salvation. Though the Church be
persuaded of thee, that thou art a wise man, witty, learned, that is to small
purpose. So live, that both the Preachers and all good people may be persuaded
you have that in you, for the which they may judge you to be heirs of
salvation.

Here he prevents an objection that might be made. What Paul, have thou bin so
bitter toward us? have thou called us babes and novices in Religion? Have thou
set before our eyes such a terrible example of Apostates and backsliders, as if
we were birds of the same feather, and now art thou well persuaded of us? thou
do but flatter us, we can hardly think so. O yes, says St. Paul, assure
your selves, we have a good opinion of you; though we thus speak, these are
but trumpets to waken you out of sin, the wounds of a lover to cure you
withal: they be but spurs of fatherly admonitions to prick you forwards unto
all goodness. We made mention of these men; not as if you were such, but to
warn you, that you be not such.

Though the Preacher be sometimes round and vehement, yet the people must not
imagine that he is hardly conceited of them. A Father loves his child when he
chides him, a Physician his patient, though he give him bitter pills: and we
love you, though we be hot against the corruptions that reign among you.

VERSE 10.
SAint Paul's persuasion was not grounded on nothing: it is not as a castle
built in the air: it has a sure ground to stand upon: you have good works
issuing from faith; therefore we are persuaded of your salvation.

To forget, that is, both to prosequute and crown your works: as he has
begun a good work in you, so he will finish it in this life, and reward it in
the life to come. If God should not do this, he should be unjust; but he is
not unjust: he is not an unrighteous Father, that forsakes his Son, or an
unjust builder that leaves his building.

That this is his meaning, is apparent, by that which went before and that
which follows after: unless he were persuaded that God would finish the work
begun in them, his persuasion could not be firm: and in the next Verse he
prays, that they may go on forward to the end: and when he has done so, he
will crown his own work.

The Jesuits say it is a world to see what wrything and wringing the
Protestants make, to shift off this place, whereby it is clear, that good
works are meritorious, and causes of salvation. If it be an unrighteous thing
with God, not to give heaven to our works, then we have it not on mere mercy,
but of justice.

Iustum est ut reddat, qui debet: debet autem, qui promisit.

It is just with God so to do, not in regard of our merit, but of his own
promise. They that came into the vineyard at the last hour, had as much as the
first: yet not of merit, but of covenant.

It is an unrighteous thing for one to break his promise. GOD has promised to
reward our works with eternal life: therefore he should be unrighteous, if he
did it not: 2 These. 1.6, 7.
and in the next words he shows, that we must not depend on our merits, but
on Gods promise ratified by an oath.

But what manner of work is it? not an easy work, but a labor; (...) is more
than (...), of (...), Seco. Such a wearisome labor as cuts the body: it may be
they went away a mile to visit the Ministers and members of CHRIST, they had
many discouragements, yet they waded through them all: it was an hazarding of
their life to be seen in their quarrel, to make their part and to relieve
them.

This work of theirs is illustrated by the manner of it, the end, the matter,
and the continuance in it.

Here are many excellent instructions.

Love is laborious. If thou love a man, thou will labor for him, thou will
run and ride for him, thou will relieve him in his wants according to that
ability, wherewith God has blessed thee: Love not in word and tongue only, 1
Ioh. 3.18. I will not give any thing for such love, as has nothing but words.
Show me thy love by thy deeds and labor. Art thou ready to do what thou
can for thy brother? art thou willing to part with thy money, thy meat and
drink for the relieving of him? then thou love him: hic labor, hoc opus est,
this is the true labor of love indeed: do thou visit him, if he be in
prison for righteousness sake? do thou go to him and comfort him, if he be
sick? never prate of love, unless I may see the labor of thy love. Jacob
loved Rachel, therefore he labored for her.

For the glorifying of his name.] Here we have the end of a good work, which
makes it a good work indeed: when it is done for the name of Christ. The
Pharisees gave alms, yet because it was to procure a name to themselves, it
was not a good work; they have their reward amongst men: they shall have none
at the hands of God. If thou give to the poor because the statute compells
thee, or because thou shall be hardly thought of, if thou give not, or that
thou may be counted a liberal man, and that the world may talk of thee
and commend thee; it loses the title of a good work; whatsoever we do, let
us do all to the glory of God, and he will recompense us.

Why, what was this work of theirs? they ministered to the Saints. One special
good work is to minister to the Saints. There were certain women that
ministered to Christ of their own substance: Luke 8.3.
the woman of Shunem ministered to Elisha, 2 Reg. 4.10.
prepared a chamber and other necessaries for him. Onesiphorus ministered to St.
Paul, which often refreshed him, 2 Timothy 1.16.
and was not ashamed of his chain. Dorcas ministered to the poor widows in
clothing them. Do good unto all, especially to them who are of the household
of faith. Acts 9.39.
If any Saints are in want, minister to them. In this sense we must all be
Ministers: this is a glorious service, a worthy ministration: in ministering to
them, we minister to Christ; Matthew. 25.40.
in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye
have done it unto me: and let it not grieve us to minister to Christ, which
has ministered his own blood to us. The times are hard, wherein we live, all
victuals are at an high rate, many poor Saints fare hardly, lie hardly, go
hardly: let us open the bowels of compassion and minister to them. This work
above all others shall be recompensed at the day of Judgment: when I was
hungry, ye fed me, etc. Therefore let us occupy our selves in this
ministration.

But what, do they content themselves with their former ministering, do they
set down their staff there? No: and yet Minister. It is not sufficient to do
well for a time, but we must continue in well doing. Many soothe up themselves
in their former good works, they vaunt of them: such and such a thing did I. O
how bountiful were we to our Preachers? How kind have we been to them? O I,
but are you kind still? have ye ministered, and yet do ye minister? have ye
been zealous, and yet are ye zealous? have ye been diligent hearers of the
Word, and yet are ye diligent? have ye been liberal to the poor, and yet
are ye liberal? That is a worthy commendation: then are ye good Christians
indeed. In earthly blessings we cannot away with was, or had; has any great
list to brag, I was Rich, I had land, I had my health? we had rather say an
hundred times, I am rich, I have my health. I was good is not so much, but I am
yet good, I am more and more good, that is an excellent thing.

Yet there be many that have been good in the praeterperfecttence, that are
not in the present. They were sober, they would look at no Alehouse, but now
they are common drunkards; they were chaste, but now are adulterers: they were
wont to keep their Church well, they would never miss a Sermon; but now come
seldom to Church, every trifle will keep them from a Sermon: they were
liberal, but now are covetous: that is a miserable thing, a doleful tune. Let
us so behave our selves, that it may be affirmed of us, we are yet good, yet
zealous, yet religious: and let not this yet be given over, so long as we live.

This is an excellent place, as any in all the bible, to encourage us to good
works. God will never forget them. As he puts our tears into his bottle, so
he puts our good works into his book, and keeps a register of them all. Men
may forget the good turns to them; they write their injuries in steel, and
their benefits in water: many will not acknowledge them that have been their
benefactors. Pharaohs butler quickly forgate Joseph, though he foretold him of
his delivery. Men are forgetful, but God is not: he neither forgets us, nor
our works. Isai. 49.15.
Can a woman forget her sucking Child, that she should not have compassion on
the Son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet I will not forget thee. God
remembered the prayer and tears of Hezekiah, 2 Reg. 20.5. The alms deeds of
Cornelius went up into remembrance before God, Acts 10.4. God remembers our
prayers, our fastings, our joyful hearing of his Word: he remembers what money
we have given to the poor, the Cloth wherewith we have clothed them, the
kindness we have showed to his Ministers: if we have given but a cup of cold
water, he remembers it, and will reward it, Mat. 10.42. This should make us
all zealous of good works. Now a days by our preaching faith in CHRIST, we
have through the corruption of the people preached good works out of the
Church: the people nourish this conceit in their hearts, we cannot merit heaven
by our works, therefore it is not a pins matter though we do none. I but God
will not forget your good works, he will reward them both in this life and in
the life to come: he will give heaven to your works, as they are the fruits of
faith, though he give it not for the worthiness and dignity of your works:
therefore be full of them.

Good works are not the meritorious causes of heaven, yet they are the way to
heaven; and ye cannot go to heaven, but by the way of good works: 2 Pet.
1.10.
therefore make your calling and election sure by them. Blessed are the dead
which dye in the Lord, for they rest from their labors, and their works
follow them. Your houses and land, silver and gold tarry behind when ye be
dead: but your works follow you. God will not forget them, but Crown them
with the Crown of eternal glory: therefore let us be plentiful in good
works.

Now he does earnestly wish their increase and continuance in all goodness.
These verses contain an heavenly prayer that Saint Paul has for the Hebrews:
wherein he desires two things for them.

1. The virtue of diligence. 2. A removal of the vice of slothfulness
opposite to it, ver. 12. The former is amplified. 1. By the persons, to whom it
is wished. 2. By the manner, how it is wished, showed. 3. By the quality of
it, the same. 4. By the fruit. 5. By the perseverance of it.

VERSE 11.
WE as laborers together with God desire the same: we wish it with all our
heart at the hands of God. Prayer is nothing else save a fervent desire of the
heart: we lift up our hearts and our hands to thee, Lam. 3.41. All men have
their desires; a covetous man desires silver and gold, houses and lands: an
adulterer desires a fair Dinah and a beautiful Bathshebah in a corner to
sport himself with all: a malicious man desires the fall of him whom he takes
to be his enemy, as Esau, the days of my fathers mourning are at hand, and
then will I slay my brother Jacob, Genesis 27.41. The ambitious man desires
honor, as Absalom: but a godly man desires the spiritual good of himself and
others. Oh that I were dissolved and were with CHRIST! Phil. 1.23.
and here Saint Paul desires the continuance of the Hebrews in all good
things: let the like desire be in us all.

He does not pray for some alone but for every one. A father wishes well to all
his Children: a good Shepherd would not have one sheep in his flock to
perish. I would to God that all that hear me this day were as I am, said
Paul: Acts 26.29.
we desire the salvation of every one of you, yea of our enemies, if we have
any.

It is the joy of the Ministers to see the people continue in well doing: my
Crown and my joy: Phil. 4.1. 2 Io. 3.4.
they desire this above all earthly profit and preferment, and they pray
heartily to God for it.

He does not desire that they might have the same diligence, but that they do
show the same diligence, openly, abroad; that men may point at it with the
finger, and ye may be ensamples to others, Matthew. 5.16. Let your light so shine
before men, that they seeing your good works may glorify your Father in
heaven, 2 Cor. 8.21. providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the
Lord, but in the sight of men. We must not only be godly, but show our selves
godly: we must not only have faith, but show it, as Dorcas did: show me thy
faith by thy works: we must not only have zeal, but show it, as Phinees did:
we must not only have patience, but show it: let your patient mind be known to
all men: we must not only have love to the Saints, but show it. Yet we know
that there is an outward showing without an inward, an outward show and an
inward too: both must concur. Some are all in show, nothing in truth: some in
show and truth too. The Pharisees made a show of Religion, fasted, prayed, gave
alms, etc. but it was nothing but a show. When they fasted, they looked sour:
when they gave alms, a trumpet was sounded at their gate: they prayed in the
corners of the streets. Our show must be outward and inward too: as the outside
of the cup and platter is clean, so must the inside too: we must be
Nathaniels, within and without too: we must walk before God with Zachary and
Elizabet, as well as be just before men: thus let us show daily the graces that
be in us.

I desire that ye go not backward, but be as diligent as ever ye were:
yea, if possible, that ye may excel your selves, and be better.

He wishes the same diligence in quality, though he would have it to exceed in
quantity.

We will be diligent in our trades and callings. The Merchant in his, the
Clothyer in his, etc. We will be diligent in them for the trash of this world.
The hand of the diligent, it makes rich: but we use small diligence in
heavenly matters. Give all diligence, says Saint Peter. 2 Pet. 1.10. We
cannot go to heaven without diligence. A Scholar must be diligent before he
can get learning: and we must be diligent Scholars in the School of Christ,
before we can learn him as we ought to do, and reign with him in the life
to come. Therefore let us be diligent, if by any means we may attain to the
resurrection of the dead: and let us not be diligent to day and negligent to
morrow, but let us use the same diligence. It was Socrates commendation, that
he was Semper idem. Let us not be semper idem in evil things, but in good
things semper idem. Let us rather mend then pare, and let our last works be
more than our first.

This virtue of diligence is amplified by the fruit, and continuance of it.

That ye may be fully assured in your hearts and consciences of that kingdom,
which ye hope for.

Some men may be assured of their good estate. St. Paul is so sure of it, that
he sings a triumph over all his enemies, To. 8.33, 34, etc. Neither is it his
song alone, but the song of all the faithful. I am sure, my Redeemer lives,
Job 19.25. 2 Cor. 5.1. For we know, that if our earthly house of this
tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with
hands, eternal in the heavens. How come we by this assurance? not by
revelation from heaven, but by good works practiced by us here on the earth, 2
Pet. 1.10. When Saint Paul was ready to depart out of the world, he was sure of
the Crown of life: how? not by revelation: but by the godly life which he had
lead, 2 Timothy 4.8. 2 Timothy 2.19. depart from sin, be full of good works, as
Dorcas was, and thou may have a full assurance of the kingdom of heaven. It
is not a bare and naked faith, that can assure thee of heaven, but such as
works by love. Men in this age flatter themselves in a supposed faith, and
cast away the care of good works: We cannot merit heaven by our work;
therefore we will not work at all: as if good works served to no end but to
merit. They are as pledges of eternal life: by them we may know whether our
names are written in heaven or not: we must know that, not a priori, for who
at any time was Gods counselor? but a posteriori: have thou works? then thou
have faith: are there fruits? then there is a root: have thou faith? then thou
have Christ: have thou Christ? then thou have the kingdom of heaven. Therefore
let us all be abundant in good works, let us excel in good works, Tit. 2.8.
These are good and profitable to men: there is a necessary use of them: they
are infallible tokens of faith, faith of Christ, and Christ of the kingdom of
heaven: therefore let us show all diligence in them, to the full assurance of
the hope of eternal life.

But how long must we be diligent? Not for a time, but to the end. (...),
refer it to the verb, (show,) that ye may show the same diligence to the
end, holding out in the race of Christianity to the end of your life.

So run that ye may obtain. It is a folly to run at all, unless we run to the
end: a folly to fight at all, unless we fight to the end. Remember Lots Wife:
she went out of Sodom, but because she looked back, she was turned into a
pillar of Salt. Let not us be diligent for a time, but to the end: we must be
working to our lives end, so long as any breath is in our body: it is not
enough to be young Disciples, but we must be old Disciples, as Mnason was: as
we have been diligent in prayer, almsdeeds, in hearing of Sermons, in
crucifying of sin, so we must be diligent to the end: hold that which thou
have, lest another take thy Crown: be faithful to the end, and I will give
thee the Crown of life.

VERSE 12.
THat ye be not slothful, like the sluggard: yet let me lie a while in the
bed of sin -- Let us shake off all slothfulness, and be not weary of well
doing; like lazy travelers, that will go no further. If we served a bad
master, that either would not, or could not reward us for our service; then
there were some cause why we should be slothful: we serve a most loving, rich,
and bountiful master: therefore let us not be slothful.

Diligent servants may be a spur to them, that be negligent.

Mark such a one, be thou like him. So St. Paul, to whet this diligence
propounds worthy examples to them.

He does not simply say, be ye followers of the Saints: but he points out the
virtues wherein we must follow them.

Examples prevail much. Though we should rather live by laws then by
examples: yet examples have a mervailous attractive power. The Jews especially
were carried away with examples: therefore the Apostle propounds some to
them. We honor the Saints, non adoratione, sed imitatione: we do not make
gods of them, but we imitate the virtues that were in them: there is exemplar
primarium and secundarium, 1 Cor. 11.1. CHRIST is certum and indubitatum
exemplar, he knew no sin: therefore we may be bold to follow him in all
things, the which he did as man. We must not follow him in his fasting forty
days, in walking on the Sea, etc. but follow him in his humility, modesty,
patience, etc. In these things we may follow Christ without exception: but the
holiest men of all, have sometimes been exorbitant, therefore we must follow
them with limitation.

They were laughed at that counterfeited a kind of purblindnesse to follow
Alexander, that imitated Plato in his crooked shoulders: when they go
straight, let us follow them; but when they go crooked, let them go alone.
We must not follow Noah in his immoderate drinking, David in adultery and
murder, Peter in denying CHRIST: we must tread in their good steps, not in
their evil: we must imitate them in faith and patience, etc.

Faith inlayed with charity is regina virtutum. Temperance, meekness,
patience, etc. are the maidens of honor, that wait upon her. By faith we
live; the just man shall live by his faith, that is his life. By patience we
possess our souls, after we begin to live in CHRIST. Patience is a pillar
for the just to lean upon, while he lives. By Faith we have an interest into
the kingdom of heaven: by patience we sail through the tempestuous Sea of
this world till we come to the haven of rest. By Faith we apprehend the
promises: which is a metonymie, whereby is meant the joys of heaven promised
to us: patience is an iron pillar, to uphold us against all crosses and
afflictions.

Patience is a most necessary virtue: ye have need of patience, Hebr. 10.36. A
Soldier has need of his armor: So have we in this warfare, of the armor of
patience. Here is the patience of the Saints: Apoc. 14.12. if ye be Saints,
ye must have patience: many are the troubles of the righteous: these are they
that came out of great tribulation, Apoc. 7.14. We cannot get to heaven
without tribulations, therefore we must have patience by the way. Innumerable
are the crosses we meet withal: crosses in our souls, bodies, many
sicknesses and diseases: in our goods; they may be taken away by thieves, fire
and other casualities: in our names; we must pass through good report and
evil report -- What godly man lives without his cross? therefore we have need
of patience to bear them all.

I but what is patience? many talk of it that know it not.

In Christian patience there must be these four things.

1. Not a Stoicall apathie, a sencelesnesse, a blockishnes, that it should be
as pleasant a thing to us to be in equuleo, as in lecto. Christ Himself felt
pain, his soul was heavy to death: and Christians feel pain in their
afflictions, but they patiently endure it: they are not overcome with it.

2. If we suffer any misery, it must be in a good cause. Thieves by land, and
Pirates by Sea, suffer much hard-ship. Catiline did patiently abide cold and
other extremities, yet he was not patient. Baals Priests endured cutting and
slashing: and covetous misers and earth-wormes will endure much to get money,
yet that is no patience: miranda est duritia, sed neganda patientia. Patience
must be in a good cause, in Christ's quarrel, and in the suffering afflictions
imposed on us by God: else it is no patience.

1 Samuel 10. ult.
3. In our sufferings there must be a good affection, and a good end Saul was
patient: when men despised him, he gave them not a word: but that was in
policy, not in Christianity. Some have patience perforce, because they cannot
be avenged, they have no power to do it: that is dissimulation, not patience:
and some suffer much for vain glory, as Heretics have done; but we must
suffer for Gods glory, for the magnifying of him and his Gospel: that is right
patience, to keep faith and a good Conscience.

4. Our patience must be continual. As our crosses are perpetual, while we
are in this world: So our patience must be perpetual.

We must dye with patience in our mouths: patientia est, honestatis ac
utilitatis causa, voluntaria ac diuturna perpessio rerum arduarum. Cicer.

Iac. 5.
Take the Prophets, says Saint James, as an ensample of patience. But I will
commend one example to you instead of many. 1 Pet. 2.21.
Take our SAVIOR CHRIST for an ensample of patience: that endured such
contradiction of sinners. Hebr. 12.3.
As his life was full of miseries from his cradle to his grave: so was it full
of patience. He was reviled, and reviled not again: he was called Beelzebub,
and a friend of publicans and sinners; yet he gave never an ill word again:
He was buffeted, spit on, blindfolded, whipped, a crown of thorns was set on
his head, and was pitifully nay led to the Cross: yet he took all patiently*
Father, forgive them, they know not what they do. Let us be followers of him:
he knew no sin, there was no cause in him, why he should be so handled, yet
was patient. We deserve many calamities by our sins, and shall we be
impatient? Shall not we take our afflictions patiently? patientia est pars
fortitudinis: a Christian must be known by his sufferings; ferendo magis, quam
feriendo. We must overcome all our enemies. Sundry there be that profess they
will put up no wrong, they will suffer no injuries at no man's hands. I, but if
we be Christians, we must be patients, not agents in evil. Ought not Christ
to suffer, and so to enter into his glory? We must go to glory by suffering,
Luke 24.
as Christ did. Let us therefore be followers of them that by faith and
patience inherit the promises. Remember the patience of Job, and what an end
the Lord made: the end of patience is comfortable; therefore let us all be
patient, that we may inherit the promises by faith and patience in this life,
and have the full fruition of them to our everlasting glory in the life to come.

The reverent opinion and charitable persuasion that the Apostle has of the
Hebrews, Verse 9. is grounded on two arguments.

1. From the consideration of the graces wherewith they were adorned.

2. From the contemplation of Gods promise; wherein, 1. A narration of the
promise, which is as the text. 2. An exposition of it, or a commentary on the
text: that consists of two parts.

1. An explanation of the oath, whereby the promise was confirmed.

2. An application of it to us. 1. In regard of the end, which is the comfort
of the faithful. 2. In regard of the effect, that arises from it, a certain
hope of eternal life. Where,

1. A description of hope. 2. A confirmation of it, by an argument from the
relatives. It is described by the similitude of an ancre: where, 1. The
qualities of the ancre. 2. The power of it. In the end, 1. What moved GOD to
it. 2. The force and efficacy of it.

VERSE 13.
HE insists in one special example, which of all other is most famous. Both
because Abraham was the father of the faithful, and the Jews boasted
exceedingly of him.

Here we have, 1. A narration of Gods ancient promise made to Abraham.

2. His patient expectation of it. In the narration,

1. A declaration of the promise. 2. The confirmation of it, namely, by an
oath. 3. The matter of the promise, that was so confirmed by an oath Verse
14.4. The performance of it: which is 1. set down, then amplified by the time,
when, Verse 15.

Abraham by faith and patience inherited the promise: be ye followers of him
in faith patience, that ye may inherit the joys of heaven promised unto you.

The promise was ratified by an oath: where we have. 1. The person, by whom he
swear, which was himself. 2. The reason, why he swear by himself, because
he could not swear by a greater.

We must swear by the greatest of all: there is none greater than God,
therefore he swear by himself being God.

Object. GOD the Son might have sworn by the Father: my Father is greater
than I.

So, in regard of Christ's Humanity, the Father is greater than he; but in
regard of the Deity, they be equal: none greater than another.

VERSE 14.
HEre we have the matter of the promise, that was ratified by an oath.

Genesis 22.16.
Verily. Sane -- answering to ( ci.) Hebr. Some interpret it, nisi, except: it
is an aposiopesis. Let me never be believed any more.

In blessing I will bless thee. That gemination sometimes signifies the
certainty of the thing: morte morieris, thou shall surely dye.

Some interpret it with a double blessing, temporal and spiritual: here it
signifies plenitudinem, for the certainty was expressed before.

The performance of the promise is set down in this Verse.

VERSE 15.
THere were three things promised to Abraham: the land of Canaan, a great and
populous posterity, and Christ the Savior the world.

For the first, Hebr. 11.9. he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a
strange country, dwelling in tabernacles, with Isaak and Jacob, the heirs with
him of the same promise. For the second: while he was alive, he had but a small
seed: and as for the third, Christ came not many hundred years after: yet all
these he enjoyed by faith: he saw the day of Christ, and was glad.

He was an hundred year old, before he had a child. When he had him, he was
commanded to sacrifice him: yet by faith he stood, and by patience obtained
the promise: we must believe under hope above hope, as he did.

(...), being of a long suffering mind, and looking to things that were long
to come. As patience in Abraham went before the enjoying of the promise: So we
must patiently endure, before we obtain the promised inheritance of glory and
happiness. Patience is an excellent thing.

The Philosophers, though in other things they jarred, yet they agreed in the
commendation of patience. Tertul. God will take the part of a patient man. If
any offer thee injury, he is ultor: if thou have any loss, he is restitutor:
if thou be grieved, he is medicus: if thou be put to death, he is
restitutor. Tertul. The patient abiding of the poor shall not always be
forgotten. There is nothing lost by patience. Ye remember the patience of Job,
and what end the Lord made. The end of patience is comfort. It may begin with a
Tragedy, but ends always with a Comedy. The husbandman is feign to have much
patience, before he have his corn into the barn: with great toil and
wearying of his body, he plowes his ground, harrowes it, casts his seed into
the earth; he knows not whether he shall see it any more, but rests patiently
on Gods providence. The Merchant is feign to have much patience, before he can
mount up to any wealth: many a storm and tempest he endures on the Sea, often
in danger of his life. The Clothyer must have much patience, in buying of his
wool, in making of it out, in selling of his cloth, he is feign to stand to
many casualities; yet hope of a convenient gain in end, makes him with
cheerfulness to pass through them all. They do it for earthly things, that
are here to day, and gone to morrow; and shall not we be patient for heavenly
treasures, for a kingdom that cannot be shaken, but is eternal in the
heavens? Be patient a while: pass through poverty, sickness, malevolent
tongues, and all other calamities in this life, that we may at the length be
taken up into that place, where we shall have need of patience no more; for all
tears shall be wiped away from our eyes.

VERSE 16.
THe Application or explication of the promise is contained in this Verse.

1. It is explicated in regard of the manner, how it was confirmed.

2. In respect of the ends and effects.

The manner of confirming it, is by an oath; which is illustrated by an use and
custom frequent among men. Wherein there is an impar, and a par.

1. Men swear by that which is greater then themselves: but God having nothing
greater than himself, swore by himself. The second is a like: as an oath
among men is an end of strife; so is it here.

The Apostle does here argue from the less to the greater. 1. If we give
credit to men swearing, much more to God. All men are liars, God is truth it
self. 2. If then especially we believe men, when they swear by the sacred
name of God, much more should we believe God, when he swears by himself. 3.
If an oath be an end of all controversy, that a man takes; much more ought
that, which God takes.

An oath serves for two uses.

1. To confirm men and to settle their minds, that there be no doubting among
them. 2. To end controversies: it is the end of all contradiction: there is no
litigation, when a man has sworn.
1. It is not unlawful to swear. Against the Anabaptists.

For, 1. God never forbids an oath simpliciter, but (...).

2. He does not say in the third Commandment, non assumes nomen Dei omnino:
Sed non assumes in vanum.

3. An oath is lex naturae, and jus gentium, Genesis 21.22.

4. By an oath God is glorified, Ier. 4.2. Laudabunt eum; by an oath we
profess, that GOD is present every where, that he sees the heart, that he is
a just revenger of untruths. Our neighbor also is thereby benefited: strifes
are ended, and love is preserved.

5. It is commanded, as a part of Gods worship, Deuteronomy. 6.13. Exodus 22.11. Isai.
19.18.45, 23.

Object.
Objection, Matthew 5.34. but I say unto you, swear not at all, etc.

It cannot be Christ's meaning, simply to condemn swearing: for he came not to
destroy the law, Sol.
but to fulfill it, Verse 17. he takes away the corrupt glosses of the
Pharisees, but not the use of an oath: as may appear in all the other precepts
there reformed, but not abolished by Christ.

Again: as Christ said, ne juretis omnino: so he said, ne resistatis malo: yet
the Magistrate may resist evil, Verse 39.

There were two glosses of the Pharisees in this, Matthew 23. verse 16.

1. If any did swear by the name of God, or by those things that did
appertain immediately to the worship of God, as by the gold offered to God in
the Temple, or by the Sacrifice on the Altar, he sinned: but if he did swear
by other creatures, by heaven, earth, Jerusalem, the Altar; it was no sin.

2. That the breach of the first oath was damnable: but not of the second:
these Christ reformeth. The Pharisees meant only of private oaths, in the
ordinary speech of men: for in public judgment, they did swear only by God
alone.

Lastly, if it were unlawful to swear; how shall Christ be justified, that
adds to his speech, Amen, Amen?

Yet these three conditions must be observed in an oath, Ier. 4.2.

Vt sit in veritate, judicio and justitia.

1. It must be for the confirmation of a truth, not of a falsehood. It is a
most vile thing to make GOD who is the truth it self, the witness of a lie.

2. It must be in judgment, with wisdom and discretion, upon great and
weighty causes: when the glory of God, and the good of our brethren requires
it: when the truth cannot be known, but by an oath.

3. It must be for just and lawful matters, not for things that are unjust and
unlawful. We must not swear to kill, to take a purse or the like. Shall any
subject swear to break the Kings laws? and shall we swear to break the law
of the King of Kings? unto the first are opposed false oaths, to the second
rash, to the third unjust.

2. We must swear by none but GOD: for he is the greatest of all.

1. We are forbidden to swear by any other, Joshua. 23.7. Ier. 5.7. Zeph. 1.5.
neither let any think, that the Gods of the Gentiles are excluded, not the
Saints: for when God will not have his worship given to other Gods, in that he
opposes himself to all creatures: dii alieni sunt omnes creaturae.

2. The servants of God have chosen rather to die, Eusebius. l. 4. c. 17.
then to swear by any other creature. The Proconsul said to Polycarpus, jura
per Caesaris fortunam. I am a Christian, said he, I cannot do it: he would
rather burn then do it.

3. It is a part of Gods worship: therefore it is Idolatry to give it to others.

4. Whatsoever is not of faith, is sin: but we have no place of Scripture to
ground our faith upon, that Saints or Angels are to be called to witness in an
oath.

5. The Saints are not every where, therefore how shall we call them as
witness?

6. None has power over our souls, but God: 2 Cor. 1.23.
he only sees the heart and can reward us, when we swear aright, and punish
us, if we swear falsely, or break our oath: as, he did the house of Saul
for breaking their oath to the Gibeonits, 2 Samuel 21.14. Therefore we must
swear by none but God.

Joseph swear by the life of Pharaoh, Genesis 42.15. Object.


1. Not the examples of the Saints, Sol.
but the law of God must be a rule for us to follow. It is probable he did so
swear to apply himself to the manner of the Egyptians, which were wont to
swear by the life and health of their King: for at that time he would not that
his brethren should know but that he was an Egyptian: nay, some go further
and condemn him of perjury too, because they went away before Benjamin came:
but the right meaning is, if ye all go hence: they went all away, and Simeon
tarryed still.

2. It was not simply an oath, but a prayer, or an obtestation with an oath
included: the oath is suppressed, and the obtestation expressed.

Chei-Pharaoh, ita vivat Pharaoh: let my King Pharaoh so live, as this is true,
which I say, ye shall not go hence unless your youner brother come hither, as
1 Samuel 17.55. So let the King live in all happiness, as this is true; I cannot
tell; this manner of swearing is desumed from God: Ezekiel. 18.3. Trem.

3. In swearing by the life of Pharaoh, he did swear by God, in whom Pharaoh
and all men live.

4. This was the peculiar oath of the Egyptians, in the way of flattery to
their Kings, as the Romans did swear per genium principis, by the soul or
spirit of their Prince, and Joseph of purpose did use it, because he would
have his brethren think he was an Egyptian: Mercer.
yet he is somewhat to be borne with, because he had the oath in his mouth,
and not in his heart.

It has been an ancient custom in the Church of Rome to swear by Saints,
Object.
and by their relikes.

But consuetudo sine veritate erroris est vetustas, Cypr. l. 2. ep. 3.

Sol.
The laying on of the hand on a Bible or a testament, when we swear. Object.


This may be excused: for properly to speak, we do not swear by the Bible;
it is only an obtestation: as the words of this bible are most true, so is that
which I swear: and it is an outward token whereby we declare to the world,
that we swear by him which is the author of the Bible; or because in this
book are contained the promises and threatenings of the LORD to them, that
swear truly, and against them that swear falsely: so among the heathen they
touched the altar when they swore, yet they swore by him whom they worshipped
on that altar, for they would lift up their hands to heaven when they swore,
denoting by that bodily gesture of theirs that they did swear by God alone,
who made the heavens.

We may swear by God primario and principaliter; but we may swear by the
creatures Secundario.

This is but a mere shift and fond evasion, Zephan. 1.5. for they swear by the
Lord primarily, by malchum secondarily; yet God was offended with them.
Besides, there is none greater than man, but God. The Angels are creatures as
well as we: they are our fellow servants, and one fellow servants must not
swear by another: therefore we that be creatures, must swear only by the
Creator.

3. Here we see what a reverent estimation we are to have of an oath: it must
be the end of contradiction: after men have sworn, we should be as mute as
fishes, not have a word to say. An oath was sacred among the heathen, 1 Samuel
30.15. Abimelech and Phicol his Captain were satisfied, when they had Isacks
oath, Genesis 21.22. but with us small credit is to be given to oaths: the oath
of a Christian is no sure foundation to build upon. Iesabel had false witnesses
at her elbow to condemn Naboth withal: the Pharisees had two false witnesses
in a readiness to swear against our SAVIOR CHRIST. And now a days, such is
the corruption among Christians, that small credit is to be given to many men's
oaths: for they say it is an easy matter in London, and I would to God it
were not in the country, to procure men to swear to what they will. So that
now a days an oath is rather the beginning then the end of controversies,
whereupon so many perjuries are found in the land: a manifest argument that
Atheism grows among us. The fool that is the wicked man, says in his heart,
there is no God: and I think many swear by God, if there be a God: but all
false swearers shall one day know, to the terror of their conscience, that
there is a God, who will be avenged on them for abusing his name. Let an oath
be such an holy thing with us, that there may be no more controversy, after we
have sworn.

Then why should we doubt of our salvation? God has bound himself by oath and
promise to bring us to his kingdom, and shall we be as reeds wavering with
the wind? I, Bell. l. 3. de just. c. 6. p. 1113.
for our salvation depends in some sort on our works, pendet ex certitudine
operum, quae conjectu ralis atque imperfecta certitudo est. It depends on
works, not as causes, but as inseparable effects of faith: not upon their
dignity or perfection, but upon their being with faith. Be faithful to the
end, and I will give thee the crown of life. I, but who can tell whether he
shall persevere to the end or not? We may be good to day, and bad to morrow.
Noah, David, Peter fell. Yes, we may be comfortably sure of our perseverance;
for he that has begun a work in us, will finish it to the day of Christ: and
though we fall, yet we shall rise again, for the Lord puts to his hand:
whom he once loves, he loves to the end, and never forsakes them, till he
have brought them to his kingdom. Only let us not be rocked a sleep in the
cradle of security, but work out our salvation with fear and trembling.

VERSE 17.
ph': wherein, in the which thing, or, in the which oath, or for the which
cause.

God did it willingly, not by constraint, none could enforce him to it.

More abundantly: then was necessary: for his bare word had been enough, save
that the weakness of man required it. See here GODS dealing with us after the
manner of men.

To show: that is, to make a lively and evident demonstration.

Unto the heirs of promise: not to Abraham alone, Romans 9.8.
but to all the faithful.

The immutability, which cannot be transposed or altered.

Not of his promise, but counsel: arguing that it was no sudden or fickle
promise, but such as proceeded from wise and deliberate counsel: Isai. 46.10.
and the counsel or decree of God stands for ever. That of Hezekiahs, and
the Ninevites, had a secret condition: unless he had prayed earnestly for
life, and the others repented, Ier. 18.7, 8. or it was rather a commination,
then the pronuntiation of a decree or counsel.

Interposuit se: as if CHRIST the Mediator had made this oath, and interposed
himself in it between the father and us, for the greater ratifying of it.
Oecumen.

Annexed to his promise.

Here we have the dignity of the godly: they are heirs: not of a Knight, of a
Lord, a Duke, etc. but of God, and the promises, that is, of the joys of
heaven which GOD has promised to them in his word. The kingdom of heaven
belongs to Children, not to servants: Romans 8.
the faithful are the Children of God and joint heirs with Christ: so that
the inheritance of the celestial Canaan pertaines to them: how then dare you
despise the lest of the heirs of promise?

2. This may comfort us against the crosses of this life. Art thou a poor man,
have no money in thy purse, to relieve thy self and thy family withal, as
Peter and John had not? have thou not a bed to rest thy weary body on, nor an
house to hide thine head in, as Christ had not? the foxes have holes, and the
birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man has not whereon to lay his
head: yet faint not, neither be discouraged, for thou art an heir of promise;
and shall one day have a full fruition of the heavenly inheritance prepared
from before the foundations of the world were laid. The heir of a Gentleman is
kept under Tutors and Governors in the time of his nonage; but as soon as
that is expired, he is at liberty, and free from all: so though we be the
heirs of God, yet in the time of our minority and nonage in this world we are
kept under many austere masters: yet the day of our redemption draws nigh,
when as all tears shall be wiped from our eyes, and we shall have full
fruition of Gods presence, at whose right hand is fullness of joy, and
pleasures for evermore.

VERSE 18.
THat by two immutable things. God will have us to have two strings to our bow:
in which it was impossible for God to lie. God is not as man that he should
lie, or the Son of man that he should repent: there is our pillar to lean
upon, viz. the immovable truth of God.

That we might have strong consolation, against all the crosses and afflictions
of this life: not weak, but strong, coming from a strong GOD, cofirmed by two
strong means, the promise and oath of God, and continuing strongly a great
while, to the end of our lives.

Many are our crosses in soul and body, in goods, name, children, and
servants: against them all we have strong consolation.

Who have fled for refuge: which fly not to this, as our castle and tower, as
men in a storm and tempest fly into a tree or house.

(...): not to have, but to hold.

Upon the hope set before us: that is eternal life hoped for, which is set
before us.

VERSE 19.
THe effect of the promise is a sure hope; which is set forth by a similitude:
where we have the qualities of the ancre, and the power of it: it enters into
heaven it self, whereof the legal sanctuary was a type.

The which hope, whereby we hold heaven; refer it not to consolation, though
it be of the same case: for that is further removed, and it enters not into
heaven, but to the virtue of hope.

An ancre; a spiritual and an heavenly ancre, not a temporal and earthly: for
the preservation of the soul, not of the body.

(...): of (...) and (...): not slipperie, which cannot be supplanted, or
overthrown.

Firm, stable, that cannot be removed: an ancre must neither be too little
nor too light.

An ancre goes downward; this upward: anchora in imo; spes in summo.

Of this metaphor he made choice, that so he might return to the Priesthood of
Christ, from whence he had digressed.

Into the inner of the veil, that is the Sanctuary, which was separated by a
veil from the rest of the tabernacle, Exodus 40.3. (...): of (...) and (...),
pando: because it was spread over with a veil: this was a type of heaven, Heb.
9.12.10, 19. In this stood the Arc and other secrets, which were hid from the
people. None came into the Holy of Holies, but the high Priest, and he no more
than once a year: even so heaven is a secret place: there be joys which eye
has not seen, ear heard, neither can enter into the heart of man to
conceive: yet our hope as an ancre enters into it.

As a Ship cannot be without an ancre, no more can we with out hope. The ship
is the soul of a Christian, the ancre is hope: the Sea where it is tossed, is
the world: the place whereinto the ancre is cast, is heaven.

These ancres are thrown into the bottom of the Sea: this into the bottom of
heaven, where it is more sure. As the ancre in a storm and tempest holds the
ship fast, that it is not tossed up and down, nor shaken with winds and waves:
So does hope the Ship of our souls, in the tempestuous Sea of this world.

It is called (...), quasi (...), ab (...): quia (...), it draws all men to
the expectation of future happiness.

Wherein these things are briefly to be considered.

Romans 8.24.
1. Whereof hope is: it is of future, not of present things. Hope that is seen,
is not hope. 2. It is of some joyful thing that is to come: if it be an
uncomfortable thing, we rather fear it, then hope for it: hope is of some
joyful thing that is to come. As we that be Christians hope for heaven, where
we shall remain with Christ for ever.

2. Where is hope? the answer is easy: it is in this life: there is no hope in
the life to come: they that be in Hell, are out of all hope of coming out,
for there is no Jail deliverie: and they that be in heaven have the end of
their hope: they see, that is they feel the joys of heaven, they hope no
longer for them. There is use of hope only in this world, while we remain in
this veil of misery: and let us desire God to nourish the lamp of our faith
to our dying day.

3. In whom must our hope be fixed? In none but in God alone: thou art my hope,
my castle, my tower, my refuge. Cursed be he that makes flesh his arm. And
it is good reason why God alone must be the subject of our hope: for he only
can simply and of himself give all things: creatures cannot do it, but it
must be God reconciled to us by Jesus Christ.

Here we must distinguish between ( sperare in) and ( sperare per) we must
sperare in Deo solo, tanquam in autore and font bonorum omnium: sperare per
aliquem, aut per aliquid, est tanquam per instrumenta a Deo ordinata, te a Deo
bonum aliquod consequuturum; that is not unlawful: as Philem. 22. but withal
prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be
given unto you. We may hope for health by the Physician: but we must not put
our trust in the Physicians, as Asa did: we may hope by prayers, fastings,
reading of Scriptures, hearing of Sermons, by mortifying of sin, as by
instruments, to go to heaven, but we must not hope in these things.

4. What Pillars has our hope to lean upon? The Schoolmen make two: gratia
Dei, and merita praecedentia. Peter Lombard. lib. 3. did. 26. defines hope
thus: est certa expectatio futurae beatitudinis, veniens ex Dei gratia, and
meritis praecedentibus: he adds further, sine meritis aliquid sperare, non
spes, sed praesumptio dici potest.

Blasphemous in my opinion!

As for good works, as they be fruits of faith, and seals of our election,
they may cause us in some sort to be of good courage and to hope well; but we
have no merits to put our trust in: we must not hope to go to heaven for the
merit and dignity of our works: that is but a broken staff to lean upon: our
works are full of imperfections; therefore let us set them aside. The only
props that hope has, to support it withal, must be derived from God in
Christ: they be especially three, as St. Augustine speaks, and of them he
glories; Charitas adoptionis, veritas promissionis, potestas redditionis.

1. God has adopted me in CHRIST, to be a fellow heir of his kingdom with
him: therefore I hope for that kingdom: for once his Son and ever his Son:
there is not a shadow of turning in him.

2. God of his free mercy has promised heaven to me, Tit. 1.2. and has
sworn that I shall have heaven: therefore I hope for it.

3. CHRIST has purchased heaven for me with a dear purchase, even with the
shedding of his own blood: therefore I hope for heaven.

4. God, that has promised it to me in Christ, is able to fulfill his
promise, he does whatsoever he will in heaven and in earth: therefore though I
be unworthy of it being a wretched sinner; though I have many strong enemies to
wrestle withal by the way, even all the devils in hell against me; though I
meet with crosses, pass through a Sea of tribulations, yet I will hope for
heaven, and I know I shall one day have it: this is the ancre that pierces the
waters of troubles and enters into that within the veil. This is the hope of
a Christian, which makes not ashamed, as the Apostle speaks, Romans 5.5. this
makes us with Abraham, Romans 4.18. to believe under the hope of grace against
the hope of nature and our own worthiness. The hope of the hypocrite shall
perish, Job 8.13. Pro. 10.28. but the hope of a godly man that believes in
Christ shall never perish. There may be weaknesses in hope, as in faith, but
it shall never be quite overthrowen. A man may be sick, yet not dye: the
Sun may be eclipsed, yet not extinguished: we have this as an ancre of the
soul, and by virtue of it we arrive at the haven of happiness in the life to
come.

Therefore let us desire God to increase our hope, and to strengthen it daily
more and more. But this ancre being in heaven already may put us in an assured
hope of heaven: and the Lord in mercy so fortify this ancre, that no storms
of afflictions may be ever able to prevail against it. Lord increase our hope.

VERSE 20.
HEre we have a pledge of our entrance into heaven, which is Christ Jesus.

Our ancre is in heaven: but as for us poor souls, how can we come thither?
Well enough. Christ is there: therefore we shall be there. The argument is
drawn from the relatives. Christ is gone into heaven before, and we shall go
after him: he is praecursor, and we postcursores. John Baptist was Christ's
forerunner, and Christ is our forerunner: the head is in heaven, therefore the
members shall be in heaven: the husband is in heaven, therefore the wife shall
be with him: the first fruits are in the barn of heaven: Christ is the first
fruits of them that sleep; therefore we that are the second fruits sanctified
in him, and by him, shall one day be in heaven with him. Let this strengthen
our faith and hope too: our forerunner is entered into heaven before us, and we
shall follow after him. This may uphold us against all the suggestions and
temptations of Satan. Flesh and blood is ready to object against us: oh it is a
long way to heaven, an irksome and tedious way: through many tribulations we
must enter into the kingdom of God. You shall meet with many enemies by the
way, and your legs are weak to carry you in this way: how is it possible for
you to come thither?

To all these we must oppose this buckler. Christ our Savior is gone before
us, and we shall follow after. Christ had a body as well as we, compassed with
natural infirmities as well as we, he dyed as well as we; yet he is in heaven:
therefore, though I be full of weaknesses, though I dye, yet I shall rise
again, and meet Christ in the air, and be translated with him into his
kingdom of glory. This is our hope of eternal life, and the Lord strengthen
this hope in us all to the end.

Now least any should be ignorant of whom he means, he points him out by
his name and office.

CHRIST had good authority to enter into this sanctuary, because he is the true
high Priest. As the High Priest in the time of the Law went into the earthly
sanctuary: So is he gone into the heavenly.

Thus he is returned to Christ's Priesthood, from whence he digressed, Hebr.
5.11.

CHAP. 7.
IN the last Verse of the former Chapter, of purpose he made choice of such a
similitude to set forth the nature of hope withal, whereby he might justly
take occasion to return to the Priesthood of Christ again, from the which
he has digressed, Verse 11. Chap. 5. ad finem 6.

In the explication of this his excellent Priesthood according to the order of
Melchizedeck. 1. He entreats of Melchizedeck the type and figure, Verse 1. ad
11. 2. Of our Savior Christ prefigured by him: speaking, 1. Of his calling to
the office of Priesthood Chap. 7. and 8. 2. Of the exequution of it, Chap.
9.10.

In the type, 1. A narration of the dignity and excellency of Melchizedec, Ver.
1.2, 3.

2. An amplification of his greatness, Verse 4. ad 11.

In the narration of the dignity of Melchizedec. 1. A description of him out of
Moses. 2. An interpretation and application of it by the Apostle. Melchizedec
is described by his offices: he was both a King and a Priest: which are first
affirmed, then confirmed.

Melchizedec. Some take it to be a noune appellative, because of the
signification: that he was so called of the people, because he was a just King.

1. Then the names of Abram, Sarai, Jacob, Benjamin should be appellatives,
because they signify something.

2. Then Salem should be an appellative.

Some of the late Hebrews, whom others follow, say it was a common name to the
Kings of Salem, as Pharaoh to the Kings of Egypt, and Caesar to the Emperors
of Rome: but it is an invention of their own: it was the proper name of the
man.

Melchizedecks kingdom is illustrated by the place, where he ruled, King of
Salem.

Jerome in locis Hebraicis is of opinion, that this Salem is that which is
called Sichem, Genesis 33.18. where he affirms the ruins of Melchizedecks
palace were to be seen in his days, and that it is that Salem which is
mentioned, Ioh. 3.23. that was near Jordan* and in the Greek and Latin
tongue it is called Sicina.

Yet the same Jerome, epist. 126. ad Euagrium reckons up a great number of
learned men, which think it is Jerusalem: which at the first was called Salem,
after Iebus, and at the last Jerusalem: which, as some suppose, is composed of
Iebus and Salem. B. being turned into. R. for Iebusalem, Jerusalem.

Joseph. lib. 1. antiq. cap. 11. lib. 7. c. 3. and de bello Ind^ico. l. 7. c.
18. is also of opinion, that it is the same, that was after called Jerusalem.
Sundry Hebrews were of the same mind, as Jerome testifies in traditionibus
Hebraicis in Genesim: and the Chalde paraphrase does translate it, Melchizedec
Rex Jerusalem.

And indeed it is most probable, that it was Jerusalem.

1. The name of Jerusalem has [ Shalom] peace in it: ^^ru Shalom: they shall
see peace.

2. Shalom and Sion are all one, Psalm. 76.2. now Sion is Jerusalem: therefore
Salem.

3. As Christ was in special manner King of Jerusalem, the King of the Jews,
which came riding in great solemnity to Jerusalem: so it is like, Melchizedec
was King of Jerusalem, being a figure of our Savior Christ.

His Priesthood is illustrated by the relatives, the nomination of the person
whose Priest he was: not of the Devil, of any Idol or false God; but of the
most high God that dwells in the highest heavens, and is exalted above all
Gods.

Some translate it, Prince of the most high God: because [ Gohen] signifies a
Prince, as well as a Priest: as 2 Samuel 8.18.

But, 1. The addition Dei altissimi shows that it must be translated Priest:
for none is ever called the Prince of the most High GOD.

2. St. Paul here, and the seventie there translate it (...); which always
signifies a Priest, not a Prince: and 2 Samuel 8.18. the seventie translate
(...), Courtiers.

3. His receiving of tithes proves him to be a Priest, and Josephus calls him
Sacerdotem: so is he termed, Psalm. 110.4.

These offices are confirmed by the effects. 1. As a bountiful King, he met
Abraham, bringing out of his storehouse bread and wine, for the refreshing of
him and his men, after the battle.

The Papists are most ridiculous to fetch the Mass from hence: that the bread
and wine brought by Melchizedec was a figure of the Mass, and that he did
offer them as a sacrifice to God. But the Hebrew is [hotsia] prodire fecit: he
made them to come out of his cellar and butterie, he was no niggard of them:
protulit, non obtulit, so Cajetan himself observed.

2. He brought them forth, not for God, but for Abraham, to comfort him and
his, after the battle they had fought. vide Deuteronomy. 23. ver. 4.

3. How wide are the Papists, to strive so much for this bread and wine, when
as they in the Mass offer up no bread and wine, but the body and blood of
Christ? As Melchizedec was a King, he met Abraham, and of his Prince like
liberality gave him bread and wine: in the name (bread) all victuals being
included: which is illustrated by the circumstance of time, when he met him,
after the slaughter of the four Kings, Genesis 14.9. Undoubtedly there was a
marveilous slaughter: the Kings in this battle on both sides were in number
nine: then the common Soldiers, Captains and leaders must needs be many. Unto
them was annexed Abraham's family, which consisted of three hundred and odd: a
number of these fell in the slime pits, and no doubt but Abram and his men put
diverse of them to the sword. There must needs be an exceeding great
slaughter. Abrams fingers were at this time embrewed with blood; yet
Melchizedec, and GOD in Melchizedec blessed him: he does not curse him for it;
fie on thee, thou bloody man, why have thou defiled thy self with War? but
he blessed him at this instant.

Whereby it is apparent to all the world, that War is lawful,

1. Iud. 3.1, 2.

2. From examples. In the Old Testament many. In the new the Centurion, Luke
7.8. Christus fidem ejus laudavit, non militiae desertionem imperavit. Aug.
Contr. Faust. Mar. l. 22. c. 74. Cornelius, Acts 10. Peter having taught him,
Christ does not bid him leave that calling. In the Primitive Church,
Constantine, Theodosius, Valentinian were worthy Warriors.

3. God blesses War. Abram was blessed of Melchizedec after the battle,
Ios. 10. God has honored it with miracles from heaven with the standing of
the Sun, etc.

4. The commonwealth defends her Citizens from internal enemies by putting
them to the sword: so she may defend them from external by Wars.

So that it be a lawful War, these conditions are required.

1. Authoritas legitima: there is bellum defensivam, which private men, the
country being invaded, may take upon them: but bellum oftensivum must not be
undertaken without authority: tale bellum indicere, solius est supremi capitis.
Bell. de laicis. c. 15. p. 471.

2. Causa.

1. It must be justa: which the Soldiers must not too curiously examine, but
submit themselves to their rulers, unles they see manifestly that it is unjust:
even as the hangman does not offend in executing a man, though unjustly
condemned; but the Judge in condemning him.

Reum regem facit iniquit as imperandi: innocentem autem militem ordo
serviendi. Aug.

2. It must not be light, but weighty.

3. It must not be doubtful, whether it be good or not; but certain.

3. Condition that is required in War, is intentio bona: the public good.

4. Modus debitus.

Yet sundry have utterly condemned it.

As the Manichees, which accused Moses, Joshua and David for wicked men.

Erasm. annotat. in Luke 3. Saint John speaks this, not to Christians, but to
heathens, to the Roman Soldiers, or profane Jews that fought under them: he
does not prescribe what Soldiers should be: but that they should be minus
mali, qui erant pessimi.

He alleges that out of Ambr. de viduis. Arma ecclesiae fides est, oration est,
quae adversarium vincit. True: they be good weapons contra daemones: but we
must have other weapons too, contra homines. Mose orante, and Joshua pugnante
they prevailed against the Amalekites, and obtained the victory, Exodus 17.

Neither will the Anabaptists allow of it.

But let them know, milites non sunt homicidae, sed ministri legis: non ultores
injuriarum, sed salutis publicae defensores. Aug.


Bell. says, Luther is of opinion, that it is not lawful to War against the
Turk.

Not because all War is unlawful: or, that we have not a just cause to
War against him that seeks to extinguish Christianity; but, 1. Because he
is GODS scourge, to punish us for our heinous sins. 2. Because persecution is
more profitable for the Church then victory. 3. Chiefly, that the Pope might
be extinguished.


But Luther spoke this in an heat, which after he recanted.

Nay, Luthers assertion is this, that we may not War against the Turk, when he
is quiet, and does not molest us.

We must have Ministers and other good Christians to pray; and we must have
Captains and Soldiers to fight: for that cause, preparation to War is
requisite. They that have no care to furnish themselves with convenient armor
against the time of need, show themselves to have small care of Gods glory, of
the preservation of religion, of the safety of their native country, that is as
a mother and a nurse to us all.

Now if it be lawful on some occasions for Christians to make War, then it
is lawful to provide for War, and in the time of peace to have training for
War, that men be not to seek when the enemy comes. As Scholars are
trained up in Schools and Universities for the Ministry: as students are
trained up in the Innes of Court for the Law, some to be Counselors,
Sergeants, Judges throughout the Realm; as some are trained up to be
Merchants, Clothyers, Physicians,, etc. So it is requisite that some should be
trained up for the Wars. 1 Samuel 17.33.
Goliath is said to have been a man of War from his youth up: he was trained
up in the War: which is spoken to his commendation, though he were a wicked
man. The Centurion had Soldiers trained up under him: fidem laudavit, milites
non damnavit. So had Cornelius Soldiers, whom he brought up in the fear of
God: and it is requisite in all Countries professing the Gospel, there should
be training to make men fit for War, if God shall send it. In the time of
health we provide for sickness, we will not be without Kerchiefes to put on
our heads if need be, without Aquavitae in the house, least we happen to faint.
When the Sea is at the calmest, the Mariners are provided for a storm and
tempest: they have their Sails, Masts, Ropes, Oars, Ancres, etc. in a
readiness, which they employ when a tempest comes: So in the time of peace we
must provide for War, we must have our armor and weapons in a readiness,
wherewith we may defend our Country and Religion, our selves, our Wives and
Children. So did Vzziah, 2 Chronicles. 26.14. as GOD blesses the one, so will he
do the other, if it be used in his holy fear: and the Lord bless the
training that is amongst us, that no hurt, no drinking, swearing, and
swaggering, but much good may be done by it, to Gods glory, the comfort of us
all.

Melchizedec his Priesthood is confirmed by two effects: the one on his part;
the other on Abraham's: for his part, he blessed him, with a solemn blessing,
as Gods vicegerent: the manner of the blessing is set down, Genesis 14.19, 20.

From hence Bell. does infer. l. 5. de To: Pont. cap. 9. that one and the
same man may be both an ecclesiastical and a political Prince; as the Pope,
who though he have no civil jurisdiction directly, yet indirectly he has, so
far as it concerns the spiritual good of the Church; and by virtue thereof
he may set up and pull down Princes at his pleasure. Melchizedec, says he,
was both a King and a Priest: so may the Pope be. Heli and Samuel were Priests
and Judges: So may the Pope be.

1. These were extraordinary in a few men; that of Melchizedec before the law
was made for a separation of those two offices, after they were flatly
distinguished in Moses and Aaron.

2. Melchizedec was a type of Christ, and sustained both offices, which concur
in our Savior Christ. The Pope is no type of Christ, therefore he cannot by
that reason lay claim to both offices, whatsoever may be holden upon other
grounds.

Here we see what a reverent account we are to make of them whom GOD has set
apart to the office of the Priesthood and Ministry.

They be the Priests, the Ministers of the most high God, in spiritual and
ecclesiastical matters, they sustain the person of God: therefore they are
highly to be esteemed of us. Artaxerxes in his letter to Ezra gives him an
honorable title. Herod though a mighty King and glewed to his sweet Delilah of
incest, Ezr. 7.12.
reverenced John Baptist. Constantine that famous and religious Emperor used
the Bishops at the Council of Nice with mervailous respect: he would not
suffer them to stand bare before him: he would have them to sit down by him,
professing that as he was Gods deputy in the Commonwealth, so were they in the
Church: yet a number of profane persons are there, even where the Gospel is
preached, that think basely and speak basely of the Ministers: what be they?
they be but Priests; I but they are the Priests of the most high God.

The name of a Priest is an honorable name in the book of God, not a name of
reproach and contempt. Indeed the Popish massing Priests, that take upon them
to offer sacrifice for the quick and the dead, being most injurious to the one
sacrifice of Christ once offered up for us all, they are worthy to be thrust
out of the Country, with contumely. Whereupon a woman in Queen Mary's days
spoke to a Priest, that came into the market to buy fowls, can thou make GOD
Almighty, and can not make a Capon? But let us take heed how we mock the
true Priests, Prophets, and Ministers of the LORD. The little Children that
called Elisha balde pate, were torn in pieces by Bears: they are the Priests,
the servants of the most high GOD: the master, whom they serve is the Highest
above all; therefore take heed how ye despise his servants: reverence them for
their master his sake, for their office sake, being Gods Ambassadors: for
their works sake, the salvation of you all, which God effects by them,
receive the word preached by them with all meekness, that by it ye may be
saved in the life to come.

VERSE 2.
HIs Priesthood is ratified by another effect on Abraham's part: what? as it
were to requite him withal? No: but as his part and portion, which in equity
he could not with hold from him.

In the Hebrew it is somewhat doubtful, whether Melchizedec gave tithes to
Abraham, or Abraham to Melchizedec: nay, by that it seems rather that
Melchizedec gave to Abraham.

But the seventie, and especially St. Paul puts it out of doubt.

Melchizedec dedit spiritualia benedicendo: Abraham temporalia decimando.

Of this historical description of him out of Moses the Apostle first makes an
interpretation, then application. The interpretation is of that, which was
expressed by Moses: the application of that which was concealed by Moses.

1. He interprets his name.

2. The place where he ruled as King. Melechtzedec. (i) is put in ornatus
gratia: as in Adonibezek, Abimeleck, etc.

So is Christ the King of righteousness. Christ was righteous in his
conception, in his conversation, preaching, and in the exequution of the last
judgment.

1. He rules with righteousness.

2. Without sin.

3. He makes us righteous, Jehovah our righteousness, Ierem. 23.6, 26.

The second thing interpreted by the Apostle, is the place where he ruled as
King: and that is Salem, which is, peace. Christ is our peace: Romans 5.1. Esai.
9.6.

1. He was borne in the time of peace.

2. The Angels at his birth published peace, Luke 2.14.

3. Ephesians. 2.15. by his cross he made peace.

4. He left peace with us: John 16.33.

Abraham gave a tenth part, not of some, but of all. The Pharisees tithed Mint,
Cummin and Anise, even the least things: which our Savior commends them for,
if they had not left the weightier matters of the law undone. But this goes to
the heart of many. We are content to pay tithe corn: yet that, God knows, do
many unwillingly: but must we pay tithe hops, tithe cheese, tithe Apples? must
we pay tithe of the gain that we get by the trade of clothing? I verily. I
give tithe of all that I possess: and shall we be worse than the Pharisees?
Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teaches, Gal.
6.6.
in all good things. Abraham gave tithe of all things to Melchizedec: so ought
ye to do, howsoever you flatter your selves to the contrary.

Our best works are too often defiled with sin: many strange by-thoughts
creep into our minds while we are a praying: we pray not with sighs and
groans of the spirit, as we ought to do: we preach not with such wisdom,
love, zeal, and power, as we should: we give not our alms so sincerely, as
becomes us, we receive not the Communion so penitently and thankfully as we
should: we hear not the word with such reverence and attention as becomes
us: every one of us may knock on our breasts after the best action we have
done, with the Publican: and say, Oh God be merciful to me a sinner. I have
no righteousness of mine own to appear before thee withal: cloth us with
the righteousness of thy dear Son, the King of righteousness, that we may
be found in him, to the everlasting joy and comfort of us all. Let the Papists
trust to the broken staff of their inherent righteousness, scoffing at the
imputed righteousness of Christ: but let us desire this righteousness.

By nature there is War between GOD and us: he is our enemy, and we his:
the flagge of defiance is displayed between us both.

Then in what a woeful case are we? are we able to encounter with the GOD of
heaven and earth, that has all creatures at his beck? we must needs go by
the worst: he can arm heaven, earth and hell against us: but here is our
comfort, Ephesians. 2.14. Romans 5.1.
JESUS CHRIST is our peace: he has set at peace by the blood of his cross
all things in heaven and earth. This is the true peace indeed, without the
which we can have no sound comfort: there is no peace, says God, to the
wicked. What peace said Iehu to Iehoram, when as the adulteries of thy mother
Iesabel are yet in great number? Though a man have the world at will, fair
houses, large lands, ample possessions, great bags of silver and gold, yet if
his adulteries, oppressions, and other sins lie as an heavy load on his
conscience, alas what peace can he have? he is as the raging Sea, that cannot
be quiet. Achitophel had wealth enough; yet because he was not at peace with
God by Christ, took a rope and hanged himself. Judas had money enough being
the purse bearer, and having lately received ^hirtie pieces of silver from the
Scribes and Pharisees: but alas, his sin vexing his conscience he could have
no rest, but became his own butcher. Therefore let us all desire God to give
us an assurance in our hearts and consciences, that we are subjects
appertaining to the King of peace, and that Christ Jesus is our Peace.

It is a singular blessing to have outward peace, to sit quietly under our
vines and figtrees, to have no leading into Captivity; no complaining in our
streets. God has been wonderful gracious to England these many years
together, and that for the admirable peace which it enjoyed: we are to praise
God that there be no tumults, insurrections, nor massacres; that there is no
sword of the enemies to devour in the land: but if in the mean season we be
not at peace with God by Christ, we are most miserable. Therefore let us pray
especially for this peace, that we may be persuaded of the remission of all our
sins in the blood of Christ.

This is most livelily represented to us in the Lords Supper. The breaking of
the bread sets before our eyes the breaking of Christ's body for our sins: the
pouring out of the Wine represents to us the gushing out of the blood of
Christ, out of his Holy side for our iniquities: therefore let us come to this
heavenly banquet with broken hearts and contrite spirits, with a true and
lively faith in Christ Jesus, the true King of peace, that we may be assured
that Christ is ours, so that whenever death shall come, we may say with
Simeon, Lord now let thou thy servant depart in peace -- for mine eyes have
seen thy salvation. This is that peace which passes all understanding: the
God of peace give it to us all.

VERSE 3.
THe thing concealed by Moses is the eternity of Melchizedec: not in deed, but
in respect of Moses History. He is introduced by him on the sudden, as if he
came then presently from heaven, and returned thither again* for Moses never
spoke of him before, nor after.

His father and mother were not only not known; but they were not at all,
namely in the History of the bible. Cujus neque pater neque matter scribuntur in
generationibus. Sir. otherwise he could not have been a fit type of our
Savior Christ.

He does not say, of years, but not so much as of days: days go before
years, Isai. 53.8. Mic. 5.2.
Melchizedec was without beginning of days, quia hoc scriptum non est:
Christus, quia non habet initium. Chrysostom. Theoph.

Nor end of life. Not that he was translated as Enoch: but because his end is
not mentioned. So Christ had no father, in respect of his humanity: no mother,
in respect of his deity.

He had kindred according to the flesh, but not as God: without beginning and
ending, as God, Ioh. 12.34.

This he applies. Likened: they are not the same, but the one like to the
other. As the picture of the King is like the King, so Melchizedec was as a
picture of our Savior Christ.

Not (...), but (...): nothing can overthrow it. An immovable Priesthood, a
permanent Priest: so was not Aaron and his posterity. Some have affirmed from
hence, that Melchizedec was not a man, but something greater then a man. Origin
(as Jerome testifies of him, Epist. 126.) said he was an Angel: others that
he was the HOLY GHOST: others that he was the great power of GOD, yea greater
then Christ; because Christ is said to be a Priest after his order. Epiphan.
l. 2. cont. haereses, haeresi. 55. Aug. de haeresibus. c. 34. The same did
Theodotus the Heretic avouch, and that he was the mediator of the Angels,
praying for them, as CHRIST does for men. Tertul. de praescrip. adversus
haereticos, in fine. Some have taken upon them to set down his fathers and
mothers name: that his fathers name was Eracla, his mothers name Astareth or
Asteria. Vide Epiphanium.

All these are confuted by the text.

1. He is said to be likened to the Son of God: but nullum simile est idem.

2. He is said to be (...): not because he had no (...), stock or kindred,
but because there is no (...) of his (...), no mention, no commemoration of his
kindred in the Scripture: from whence arises (...), and (...), Verse 6. So
Horace, lib. 2. Satyr. 5. says of one, that he was sine gente, because his
nation was not known: qui quamvis perjurus erat, sine gente, cruentus*
Sanguine fraterno: and they use to call him terrae filium, whose father is not
known. Jobs Genealogy is not expressed in Scripture.

But why was his Genealogy omitted? Some of the Jews say, because his father
was a fornicatour, and his mother an whore. Eustathius Bishop of Antioch says,
because his ancestors were not worthy to be reckoned with such an holy man.
Some, because he did not appertain to the stock of Abraham, from whence the
Messiah came: rather, because he might be a full type and figure of CHRIST.

Sem cannot be Melchizedec: the Jews say he was. Lyranus. Jerome epist. 126.
calls it famosissimam quaestionem.

1. Sem his Genealogy is set down in the Scripture: his father and mother are
known, his Grandfather and great Grandfather: his posterity, Genesis 10.21. Ergo.

Object. Lyr. his Genealogy indeed is registered under the name of Sem: but not
under the name of Melchizedec, as the Holy Ghost means.

Sol. I but the Apostle speaks of the man, not of the name. This man
Melchizedec was without father and mother: So it may be said, that the
posterity of Israel is not mentioned, Matthew. 1. because the name of Israel is
not there, but of Jacob.

2. Sem had the east part of the world allotted to him, Genesis 10.31. then how
came he to dwell in Canaan appointed to Cham and his posterity, Genesis 10.19.
and to Reign there as a King?

Whereas Sem and his posterity had Chaldea allotted to them: Abraham came of
Sem, who dwelt in Vr of the Chaldees, from whence he came into Canaan at Gods
Commandment Gen..1.31. he passed over the river Euphrates, whereupon he was
called (...) by the seventie. But we never read that Sem was called into
Canaan, Ios. 24.2.
as Abraham and Lot were.

3. There is no probability, that seeing all this while often and constantly
he has been called by the name of Sem, the HOLY GHOST should now of the
sudden call him by the name of Melchizedec.

4. It is said of Melchizedec, Hebrews. 7.6. that his kindred is not counted
among the Levits: yet Abraham and Levi came of Sem: therefore Sem was not
Melchizedec.

5. Josephus and Philo Iudaeus affirm, that Melchizedec was a Cananite, so say
Irenaeus, Epiphanius, Theodoretus.

Adam and Eve had neither father nor mother: they had no earthly Father, to
beget them, nor mother to bear them in her womb, but were immediately created
by God. All others that descended of them, have both father and mother:
Melchizedec himself had father and mother, else he could never have had any
being in the world to meet Abraham and to bless him: but he is said to be
without father and mother, etc. because their names are not recorded in the
history of the Bible; otherwise both he and all other Men, Women, and Children
have beginning of days and end of life. We have a beginning, and we shall
have an ending: there is a time to be borne, and a time to die. Adam lived so
long, and he dyed. Methusalem almost a thousand years, yet he dyed in the
end. The rich man also dyed, and was buried. Rich and poor, high and low,
Merchants, Lawyers and Physicians dye. Lords, Earls, Dukes, and Kings dye.
Some go merrily to bed, and are dead in morning: Some lively and jocund at
noone, and dead by night. Some are made exequutors to others, that are feign to
have executors themselves, before they can come to the exequution of the will
and testament left to them. Such a frail thing is our life: a vapor, a bubble,
a thought, a dream, etc. Therefore let us so spend the few, evil, and
uncertain days of our pilgrimage in this world, as that we may live with
Christ that abides for ever in the world to come.

The Priesthood of our Savior is an everlasting Priesthood: as for his
sacrifice, the action is past: he offered himself once for all on the altar of
the Cross: but the fruit and efficacy of it remains for ever, his
intercession remains still: he is our intercessour in the heavens, and
presents the incense of our prayers to his Father in the golden censer of his
own righteousness, and he will offer up the sacrifice of praise for us to
his Father for ever. Therefore let us show our selves to be Priests to him,
offering up our selves, our souls, our bodies as an holy sacrifice to him in
this life, that we may reign with CHRIST our Priest for ever in the life to
come.

VERSE 4.
NOw follows the greatness of Melchizedec, which was a type of our SAVIOR
CHRIST: whereby the greatness of our SAVIOR CHRIST Himself may shine more
evidently to us all.

The amplification of his greatness is set forth by comparing him with two
famous persons, Abraham and the Levites. 1. That he is to be preferred above
Abraham, he evinceth by these two arguments.

1. He that takes tithes is greater than he that gives tithes. Melchizedec
takes tithes, Abraham gives tithes. Ergo.

2. He that blesses, is greater than he, that is blessed: but Melchizedec
blesses, and Abraham is blessed. ergo.

That he is to be advanced above the Levites, he shows by two arguments.

1. They are mortal: he is immortal. 2. They paid tithes to him: ergo, he is
greater than they.
The first argument has two parts: an affirmation, and an anticipation of an
objection.

1. Argument: he that received tithes of Abraham that famous and worthy man, of
whom the Jews do boast more than of any other, must needs be acknowledged to
be a great man: but Melchizedec received tithes of Abraham: ergo.

The proposition depends on this: tithes were Gods right: therefore they that
took tithes were in Gods room: and for that cause superior to them, that
paid tithes. Melchizedec was a taker of tithes; Abraham a giver of tithes:
therefore he was greater than Abraham.

Because it is a matter of importance and worthy the marking, he stirs them
up to attention by an Epiphonema.

Consider: as they do that are in a theater, which are wont with serious
min^es and careful diligence to consider of that which they see and hear.
Melchizedec as a magnificent King and royal Priest comes forth to play his
part: therefore consider him well.

How great. Not in stature, as Saul was, but in honor and dignity.

This: whatsoever he were.

Even the Patriarch Abraham. Such a rare man, 1 Chronicles. 8.6.
as Abraham was, the friend of GOD, the Archfather, a chief father, the Prince
of fathers. Ab rab gnam, the father of many nations: of him the Jews chiefly
boasted, that he was their father. So, Ioh. 8.53.
Acts 2.29, 7, 8 and 9.

Of the first or chief of the fruits: taken also for spoils. An ordinary
thing among the Gentiles to consecrate some of the spoils to their Gods, when
they had gotten a victory, 1 Samuel 15. ver. 15.

The chief of the spoils, he would not give of the basest: they by a
Synecdoche are put for the whole spoils. Some translate it, praecipua, the
chief things.

The taking of tithes by the Ministers argues a superiority, that GOD has
given them over the people. In things appertaining to their office they are
greater than the temporalty, they are Gods Ambassadors and workmen with him:
and the tithes are a tribute which the people are bound to pay them for their
work.

Here we behold the greatness of the Ministry, and what great men the
Ministers be. It is a thing worth the consideration of us all, for the Holy
Ghost wills us to consider it. The receiving of tithes from the people argues
the greatness of the Ministers, to whom tithes are paid. The world through the
subtilty and malice of Satan has a base opinion of the Ministers, supposing
them to be little men, of no account, or reputation: yet in very truth,
whatsoever their stature be, if as little as Zacheus, whatsoever their outward
estate and condition be, though as poor as Peter and John, that said, silver
and gold have we none, yet in truth they are great men. Obadiah though the
Kings steward, had an high opinion of Elias, says he, art not thou my Lord
Elias? the King of Israel esteemed highly of Elisha; My father the charet of
Israel and the horseman thereof. Herod reverenced John Baptist, and the very
Devil speaking in the maid, spoke honorably of Paul and Silas. Constantine
the Emperor used the Bishops at the Council of Nice with marveilous respect,
he would needs have them to sit down by him, and he would not be covered when
any of them were preaching. The Spirit of God says in this place, consider how
great a man Melchizedec was: So say I to you all; consider what great men the
Preachers of the word be. Is not the Kings Ambassador a great man? they are
Ambassadors of the King of Kings: therefore great men. Is not the steward of a
noble man's house a great man? these are Gods stewards, the disposers of the
secrets of God, as Paul terms them, 1 Cor. 4.1. they are as Christ himself,
in their place and office* he that hears you, hears me, Luke 10.16.

When they preach, Christ preaches: therefore great men, to be received as
Angels from heaven, yea, as Christ himself: yet some profane persons there be,
that suppose them to be the least of all others, of least account and
estimation. He is no Justice of peace, no governor in the Commonwealth:
therefore a little man, a straw for him. I but though in secular affairs they
are subject to the civil Magistrates, yet in spiritual matters they are above
them (I speak of subordinate Magistrates,) Consider them that labor among you,
and are over you in the Lord: they are the Shepherds; and all others, though
there be a Gentleman, a Knight, a Lord, in the parish, yet they be all his
sheep.

Therefore the Minister in respect of his office is a great man; So let us
esteem of him, and receive with meekness, fear and reverence the word
delivered by him. The small account that the people make of the Preacher,
causes the Word of God to find the lesser entertainment among them: therefore
banish that opinion out of your hearts, and know them to be great men, as
indeed they be.

VERSE 5.
AGainst that might be objected. What? is the receiving of tithes an argument
of greatness? Why then the Levites are as great as Melchizedec, for they take
tithes.

Sol: true indeed, yet great odds between them.

1. They are of the tribe of Levi, which GOD consecrated to the Priesthood: in
that respect they have a right to receive tithes: Melchizedec is none of that
tribe: yet he takes tithes, because his Priesthood is more excellent: in
regard whereof he has a greater interest to tithes.

2. The people give them tithes, because they have an express commandment
from GOD to take them. Abraham not by commandment, but willingly of his own
accord gave tithes to Melchizedec, because he knew he had an immediate authority
to take them from God, being in a more excellent manner the Priest of God.

3. The Levites take tithes of the progeny of Abraham, Melchizedec of Abraham
himself, the author and foundation of the whole stock of the Hebrews.

They have a commandment, which is laid down, Number. 18.21, 31. Lev. 27.30.
Deuteronomy. 14.22, 27. therefore they may lawfully take, and who be they that dare
resist this commandment?

According to the law: not of their own brains, but by warrant from the Law.

Not of some, but of all the people: none are exempted from paying of tithes.

To tithe the people: that is, by a metonymie, the goods of the people.

He shows what is meant by the people: the Israelites their brethren: they
were brethren in nature, having all one father, which was Abraham; and in
religion, professing one God and religion. This should make them more loving
one to another.

4. They took tithes or their brethren: but Melchizedec of their father, which
was Abraham.

Vterini, as it were: though in this respect they and the people are equal:
both came out of Abraham's loins; yet that did not privilege them from paying
tithes to the Levites.

There be two veins and two arteries from the loins, which carry the seed to
the place thereof: therefore they are put for generation.

Though the Ministers be advanced into a chair of dignity above the people,
yet they must remember, that they are their brethren. The King is the subjects
brother: when thou make a King, thou shall take him from among thy brethren:
much more is the Minister brother to those, to whom he speaks. Our Savior
Christ is not ashamed to call us brethren: and shall we disdain to call the
least Sheep in our flock, our brother, or our sister? We must not be as
Lords and tyrants over God his heritage, but carry our selves as brethren
toward them: Speak kindly, have compassion one on an others infirmities, as
brethren.

VERSE 6.
HEre we see Melchizedec Priest of the most high God, received tithes, and the
Levites had a commandment to take tithes. Now here a question does necessarily
offer it self, whereunto the text draws me, whether I will or no; whether
tithes be the perpetual maintenance of the Ministry or not? A thing somewhat
controversall in this last and wicked age of the world, wherein charity waxes
cold; as to all in general, so to the Ministers in special. Some, if there
were no law to compel them, would give them neither tithes nor any other thing
at all, so unthankefull are they for the food of their souls. I but we will
not stand to man's courtesy, for then in most places we should have a cursey;
but it shall be evinced out of the Word of GOD, that tithes is that part and
portion which God Almighty has allotted to us. It was not only the Levites
maintenance in the time of the law, but it is our maintenance in the time of
the Gospel, and must continue to the worlds end.

Bellar: contendeth, that tithes are due to the Ministry, non jure divino, sed
ecclesiastico: yet he allows, that in some sense it may be affirmed that
they are due jure divino. 1. Quoad substantiam, non quantitatem. 2. Si addatur
ecclesiae determinatio: and so the feasts are now to be kept holy jure divino.
3. That the very quantity is due, jure divino: yet non ex vi juris divini, sed
ex vi juris ecclesiastici.

These are nothing else but starting holes: for it is a firm and immovable
truth, that the very quantity is still due to the Ministers of the Gospel,
whether the Church determine it or not: for Gods institution depends not on
the constitution of the Church.

Here we have just occasion to entreat of tithes: wherein sundry questions are
to be discussed.

1. Whether tithes are now due to the Ministers of the Gospel? 2. Who they be
that must pay tithes? 3. Whereof we must pay tithes? 4. Whether we are bound
to pay tithes to a bad Minister or not?
For the former. Tithes are due to the Ministers of the Gospel; not of alms,
or of benevolence, which the people may pay us, if they will: but of justice,
we have a right and interest to them.

1. The labourer is worthy of his hire: a beggar is not worthy of alms, when
ye give a labourer his hire, ye give him his due, not an alms.

2. 1 Cor. 9.7. A Soldier has right to his stipend, he has it not of alms:
A Shepherd has a right to live on the flock, and an husbandman has a right
to eat of the fruit of the Vineyard, which he planteth.

Tithes are perpetual.
1. By Abraham's paying of tithes to Christ in Melchizedec, the Apostle
concludes the perpetuity of Christ's Priest-hoode, Hebr. 7.8. Now if tithes
were paid to Christ before the law, then they are still due to Christ to the
end of the world, so long as his Priesthood continues.

2. Tithes are the Lords, as a right in every man's goods, Le. 27.30.

Those he gave for a time to Levi, so long as he served at the tabernacle:
when Levi ceased to serve at the altar, tithes ceased to be due to Levi: but
they ceased not to be the Lords: for as they were his before the law; so they
stand his for ever: and he transferreth them from Levi to others, that still
serve the Lord in his ministry.

They were in the law of nature: therefore they are perpetual, as the law of
nature is written in men's hearts.

Abraham, Genesis 14.20.

Now Abraham paid tithes; not of the spoils, but of his own goods

1. It is not like he would give of other men's goods.

2. He could not give that, which he took not: but he took none of the
spoils, Genesis 14.23. therefore. So Master Calvin reasons on that place.

As for that Hebr. 7.4. 1. The Greek word is in no author taken simply for
tithes, but for primitiae: and sometimes for primitiae manubiarum. 2. Jerome
translates it, de praecipuis: and the Syriack calls it first fruits.

Yet be it, that Abraham paid tithes of the spoils, it follows not, of them
only, much more of his own goods: for Levi then in Abraham paid tithes to
Melchizedec, as Levi took tithes afterward, Hebr. 7.9. but he took tithes of
men's own goods. So did Abraham pay of his own goods, as well as of the
spoils.

And it is very probable, that Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedec, not at that
time alone, but yearly.

1. As tithes were paid in the law; so were they before the law: the manner was
all one: but in the law they paid yearly: Ergo. and the Priests before the law
were as worthy of them yearly, as afterward.

2. The distance of place could be no hinderance: for Abraham dwelt at Hebron
over against Sodom, and Melchizedec at Salem, which was afterward Jerusalem,
both of them in the tribe of Judah, not far asunder.

Jacob, Genesis 28.20.

Object. This proves that tithes were voluntary, and that men were not bound to
pay them: for (as Bellar.) If Jacob had been bound to pay tithes, as a moral
duty written in his heart by nature, then he did ill to vow it with a condition.

Sol. We may vow moral things, the better to bind our selves to the
performance of them, as God has bound us to them before: the worshipping of
God is a moral duty, but they bound themselves to it with an oath and a
covenant, 2 Chronicles. 15.12. to the 16. To praise God is a moral duty: but David
vowed it, Psalm. 50.14.56, 12.

And it is lawful to vow these things with a condition, as Jacob did: if God
would bless him with goods: for else he could have paid no tithes. We may vow
to honor our parents, if God will bless us with life: otherwise we cannot
honor them.

Object. 2. We must vow that which is our own, not another: if tithes at
this time were the Lords, then Jacob would not have vowed them.

Sol. Yes: we may vow that which is the Lords, to bind our selves by a new
promise to the performance of that whereunto God has already bound us: and
this argues a resolution to do it: as David bound himself to obedience, Psalm.
119.106.

2. It is like that Jacob vowed to pay tithes, not immediately to God, but
mediately to the Priest of God; as Abraham did before him.

It may be also proved by the consent of all nations.

From the sons of Noah; the custom of paying tithes to their Gods and
Priests, was dispersed among all nations. Cyrus King of Persia, when he had
overcome the Lydians, offered tithes of all he had to Iuppiter, Herod. Cli:
Macrobius prooveth out of Varro, that it was an ancient custom among the
Romans to vow and pay tithes to Hercules: and Plutarch reports that Lucullus
grew rich, because he used to pay tithes to Hercules. Xenophon witnesses that
men used to pay tithes to Apollo. Pliny writes of the Sabeans and Ethiopians,
that the Merchants meddled not with the spices, till the Priests had their tenth.

Rat. 4.
If tithes be neither judicial, nor ceremonial, then they are still to
continue in the Church: but they are neither judicial nor ceremonial, ergo,
they are to continue still in the Church.

1. They are not judicial. No holy things are judicial. Holy things are
separated from a common use to the LORD: either by the LORD Himself, or by
men, Leviticus 27.28. but judicialls are of things in common use, not separated
from men.

That they are not ceremonial may be proved from the definition of a
ceremony. A ceremony is a carnal type of an holy thing enjoined for the use
of the tabernacle, till the time of reformation, Hebr. 9.10.

By an holy thing is meant an evangelicall truth: by the time of reformation,
the first coming of our SAVIOR CHRIST.

That it is a carnal rite, Heb. 9.10. and Ver. 23. similitudes of holy things.

That these rites were for the service of the tabernacle, Ver. 2, and 8. that
they were to endure only to the time of reformation, V. 10.

Tithes come not within the compass of this definition.

1. They be not carnal, that is impotent and beggarly rudiments, Gal. 4.9.
which served for the institution of the rude and ignorant people of the Jews:
they did teach nothing, but served only for the honorable maintenance of
them, that taught the people.

2. They be no types of an holy thing in CHRIST and his kingdom, they did
signify nothing to come in Christ, or in his kingdom.

3. They were not instituted for the service of the tabernacle, but assigned to
it for a time.

4. They were not to cease at the time of reformation: for still they are
retained in the Church, as the maintenance of the Ministry: which the Church
should not do, if it were a ceremony that should end at the coming of Christ.

Here is no institution or assignation of tithes, but a declaration of the
Lords right. I do you no wrong in assigning the tithes to Levi, for they be
mine, and not yours.

They are holy to the Lord, that is, separate from the use of men: So that it
is sacrilege to take them away.

Here is an assignation of them to the tribe of Levi, only for the time of
their service at the tabernacle. Levit. 27.30.


Here we may see what is ceremonial, what perpetual in tithes. This
proposition, ( all tithes are the Lords,) is perpetual; the assignation of
them to the Levits in the second place is ceremonial, that is Levitically
ceremonial: for if there be any ceremony in tithes, it is a Leviticall
ceremony. Number. 18.21.


Object. Sacrifices were in use before the Leviticall and ceremonial law; yet
they are ceremonies: So are tithes though paid before the Law.

Sol. Sacrificing it self is in the law of nature: but particular ordinances
for the manner of sacrificing are ceremonial. So the payment of tithes is in
the law of nature: but certain particular ordinances for the payment of them
are in the ceremonial law.

Yet there is a difference between sacrifices and tithes.

1. In the propriety. Tithes are ever the LORD: sacrifices are not his, till
they be offered to him: before, the man that offers them, has a right in them.
When a man offers a sacrifice, he offers of his own: when he gives tithes, he
gives that to the Lord which is the Lords.

In not sacrificing, godliness is violated: in not paying tithes, not only
godliness, but Justice also is violated. Now a ceremony stands not in paying
to God that which is his: but in giving to God that which is thine own.

2. In the end. Sacrificing is to signify the great sacrifice on the cross
for the sins of the world. The end of tithes is not to signify any thing,
but is the honor and maintenance of the Ministry: and therefore they are to
remain so long as the Ministry remains.

That assignation of tithes to Levi, or, that lease being expired, they return
to their proper right again, that is, to CHRIST which lives for ever,
Hebrews 7. Verse 8 for though it be first true in Melchizedec the type, who
in respect of the silence of his death, is said to live: yet most of all is it
verefied of Christ.

The service of the tabernacle being abrogated, the assignation of tithes to
the Levites is void: but the propriety of them ever was and is in the Lord, for
his Ministers.

Improperly to speak, the assignation of tithes was ceremonial, that is,
appertaining to the ceremonial law: but properly to speak, there is nothing
ceremonial in the paying of tithes: for in it there is no carnal type of an
holy thing, neither in the Leviticall nor Evangelicall ministry.

There is no proof in all the New Testament for any other ordinary
maintenance of the Ministry: Rat. 5.
therefore tithes remain still the ordinary maintenance. He that preaches the
Gospel must live on the Gospel: Somewhat more sparingly, then the Priests did
in the time of the Law. They are injurious to the Ministers of the Gospel that
will say so: If they had the tenth part of the peoples goods, shall we have
less? Gal. 6.6. Let him that is taught in the Word, communicate unto him that
teaches, in all good things.

Though tithes were buried for a season in persecution, yet they were resumed
and established again in the Church in all ages, Rat. 6.
as appears by the Fathers and Counsels: till the Pope coming to the height
of his usurped authority exempted some from paying of tithes, and made
impropriations. In the defense of whose unjust dealing first Alexander de
Hales, then Aquinas and all the Schoolmen contended that tithes were
judicialls: yet they are still due de jure, though de facto the Ministers of
the Gospel are deprived of them: for tithes are moral by divine institution,
Mat. 23.23. there tithes have Christ his approbation, as a thing that ought to
be done; where there is an opposition between things of the same kind; the
greatest moral things are in mercy and judgment, and the least moral things
in paying the least tithes, Luke 18.12. tithes are moral, as fasting is.

The causes remaining, the things must still remain: but the causes of giving
tithes remains still, Rat. 7.
ergo.

1. It was an acknowledgement that they had all from GOD, and ought all to him,
Levi. 27.30. So must we do still.

2. That thereby they might learn to fear God, who otherwise might bring
sterility, and other plagues on the land, Deuteronomy. 14.23. So we must do still.
Nazianz. imputes the hail to this: de calamitate per grandinem.

3. That the Priests and Levites having no other maintenance might have this to
sustain them in their office: the Ministers of the Gospel cannot be
husbandmen, clothyers, they cannot wait on tables, but must give themselves to
the Word and prayer: therefore it is meet they should have the same
maintenance still.

2. Quest. Who they be, that must pay tithes?

All: high and low, rich and poor, husbandmen and Clothyers: because the
payment of thithes belongs to justitiam commutativam, in qua non consideratur
conditio personae, sed qualitas rei ad rem. 2. The poor have benefit by the
Ministry as well as the rich: the Clothyer has as great benefit by the
preaching of the Word, as the Husbandman has, therefore why should not he give
as largely to the maintenance of the Preacher as an other? In law they may have
a shift, but in equity and conscience they have none: let him that is taught
in the Word -- but the Clothyer is taught in the Word, therefore he that
teaches him should have as deep a part in his goods, as in the goods of an
other man. Shall the poor Farmer pay all to the Minister, and the rich
Clothyer nothing? Shall he that sits in the lower end of the Church pay, and
he that sits in the upper end not?

3. Quest. Whereof we must pay tithes?

Some things are due to the Ministers ex justitia: some ex dono, as houses and
gleebe land.

1. God has given us all, and shall it grieve us to give him for his Ministers
the tenth part?

2. Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are
Gods. i. Caesari tributa, Deo decimas. Jerome and Augustine.

3. The Ministers give us the rain of the Word of GOD, and shall we think
much to give them the hay of tithes? faenum decimarum?

4. The Pharisees paid tithes, and our righteousness must exceed the
righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, Aug. in Psalm. 146.

Decimae etiam quoad determinationem quantitatis, Canonistarum sententia.

Hanc refellit Bellar.

1. A commandment to pay the tenth is no where imposed upon Christians in the
Old or New Testament. That it is not in the New is evident: that it is not in
the Old, he proves;

Because the commandment of paying the tenth part was neither moral, nor
properly ceremonial, but judicial.

That it was not moral, he shows.

1. All moral Commandments did ever bind from the beginning of the world:
but the Commandment to pay the tenth part was not till Moses time; therefore
not moral.

2. Every moral commandment is agreeable to reason: but reason does not will
that the Priest should have the tenth part, but so much as is sufficient for
the sustentation of him.

3. Jacob vowed, if GOD would bless him in his journey, he would give him the
tenth of all that he had, but if he had been bound to it absolutely, he had
done wickedly to vow it upon such a condition.

4. If the determination of the tenth part be a moral precept, then that
which is annexed to it, is likewise moral, that they which receive tithes
should have no other patrimony: then Ministers must enjoy no temporal things,
page 141.

Resp.
1. To the first. The assignation of the tenth part began in Moses time, but the
institution of it was before. 2. In reason that is the most equal and
sufficient. 3. Is fully answered before. 4. That is not annexed to the first
institution of tithes, but to the assignation of them to the Levites.
2. The Levites had Cities and a great deal of lands round about those Cities
appointed to them besides their tenthes: So the ministers of the Gospel may
have temporal lands, besides their tithes.

Vide, Lev. 25.2, and 3.

That the paying of the tenth part was not properly ceremonial, he proves.

Because it was not ordained immediately for the worship of God, but for the
constitution of equity among men, and for that cause judicial, rather than
ceremonial. The equity was this, that there might be a proportion, between the
goods of the Levites and others. The whole family of Israel was divided into
twelve tribes, or rather thirteen tribes; for Joseph made two, Ephraim and
Manasseh: whereupon in equity, the Levites should have had but the thirteenth
part: yet because God foresaw that a number would pay badly, he allotted to the
Levites the tenth part.

By the same reason, no maintenance of Ministers should be moral: because it
has not an immediate relation to the worship of God.

2. I but tithes have an immediate relation to the worship of God, because they
be the Lords immediately, who of his own right gives them to the Ministers.

Neither is that the reason: but God assigned tithes to Levi, out of his own
right, Levit. 27.30.

2. If that had been the reason for paying of tithes, then they should not
have been paid before the law.

By what reason it may be showed, that the determination of the Church is
just, that Christians should give the tenth part of their fruits to the Church.

The meaning is not, whether that be just, which the Church determines (for it
were a madness says Bell. to dispute that) but upon what justice and equity the
payment of the tenth part depends.

There was some equity for it in the old law, because the Levites were the
twelfth or thirteenth part of the people: but now there seems to be no equity
of it, because the Clergy is not the hundred part of the people.

Yet it is still agreeable to equity.

1. Because the Clergy must be hospital, and maintain the poor.

2. Bellarmine denies that the Levites were the thirteenth part of the people,
and that the Clergy now is not the hundredth part: for the people were six
hundred thousand and three thousand, and five hundred and fifty, besides Women
and Children, Number. 1.45.46. whereas the Levites in all were but two and twenty
thousand, Number. 3.39.

3. Now the Clergy is subject to more cost and labor.

4. The Ministry of the New Testament is more worthy, then the Old.

5. Now the Church is more deprived of her right. Some pay no tithes at all:
the most pay unfaithfully.

6. Christian people should be more perfect, then the Jews were: Ergo, at the
least they should pay the tenth. page 146.

Where there is no custom set down by the Church to pay tithes, whether do
the people offend in not paying them?

In three cases they may offend.

1. If for want of tithes the Church be in great affliction and penury. 2. If
the Church do require them. 3. If the people be of this mind not to pay them,
though they be lawfully required.
Otherwise they are excused, because the Church in not demanding tithes, does
seem to forgive them: and it is no sin not to pay a forgiven debt. page 145.

Quest. 4. Whether we are bound to pay tithes to a bad Minister or not? Tithes
must be given to bad Ministers.

1. Matthew 22. Verse 21. Yet at that time bad Caesar's and bad Priests --

2. Decimae non dantur clericis, quia boni sunt, sed quia clerici sunt: Sicut
tributa dantur regibus, non quia probi, sed quia reges sunt.

A bad Father, must have maintenance from his Son, and a bad Minister must
have tithes from his people. But how cheerfully ought ye to give it to them,
that are faithful and diligent in the work of the Lord? Yet all is one. Let
him be never so good a Preacher, if St. Paul were among us, unless the law
constrained us, he should have nothing.

What a lamentable case is this?

The light of this truth is as clear as the noone day. Tithes are still due by
the Law of God to the Ministers of the Gospel: yet what a stir has he to
get his due? how hardly is it wrung even from them that carry a glorious show
of Religion? We have a custom, said the Jews to Pilat, thou must let loose
Barabbas to us, though he be a thief and a murderer: so we plead, we
have a custom to pay little or nothing instead of any tithes; therefore we
will hold this custom, though you preach your hearts out.

1. Consider the equity of the custom. That, which at the first springing up
of the custom was but worth a Groate, is now worth ten shillings: and yet
will ye against all reason hold that custom still?

2. The Jews had a custom, upon small occasion to put away their Wives,
derived from Moses: yet CHRIST brake the neck of that custom, saying, ab
initio non fuit sic. Moses permitted that for the hardness of your hearts,
because he had to deal with a stubborn and stiff-necked people; Matthew. 19.8.
but from the beginning it was not so. So say I, the law for the hardness of
your hearts permits this custom, as it does eight in the hundred, but look
back to the original, and ye shall find that from the beginning it was not
so. It is an Axiom in the law, nullum tempus occurit regi. The King never
looses his right for discontinuance of time. And shall the King of Kings be
debarred of his right, because of a new upstarte custom? Flatter not your
selves in your customs; they are but broken reeds for you to lean upon. St.
Paul says; If any man list to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor
the Churches of God. So say I to you, if any list to rob God and his Ministers
of their right, we have no such custom, nor the Churches of God.

It is a wonderful delusion, that the Devil has bewitched many withal;
stolen waters are sweet, and all is good that we may take from the Ministers.

He that robs a Minister; robs God, Mal. 3.8. and is it no sin to rob
God? he that steals from a common Christian, is a thief: but he that
steals from a Minister is a Church-robber: the one is theft, the other is
sacrilege: the one breaks the second table; the other the first table.
Therefore take heed of this grievous sin. Tithes are the LORDS, he has
given them to us: therefore take you good heed, how ye take them away from
us, least you be found fighters against God, Acts 5.39.
as wise Gamaleel said to the Council. Take away maintenance from any calling,
and it will quickly fall to the ground: who would be a Merchant if he must be
a beggar all the days of his life? Who would be a Clothier, if he get no gain
by it? Who would put his Son to the University, there be at charges with him
seven or eight years, afterward to be a Minister, and to have no comfortable
maintenance in his calling? it is a matter of greater importance then we are
aware of: the denying of the Ministers right is the overthrow of the Ministry,
and so consequently of the Word of God, whereby we must be saved in the life
to come: therefore let us not have a finger in it.

You think to wax rich by defrauding of the Ministers, but that is the
highway to poverty and beggary too. Such money is put into a bottomless
bag, it will never prosper. Consider what the Lord says Mal. 3.10. Prove me,
etc. pay your tithes conscionably in truth and sincerity, as you ought to do,
and Gods blessing shall be on you and yours: steal from the Ministers of God,
and thy wealth one way or other shall melt away as the wax before the fire.
Therefore in the fear of God let us all look to it: let us, as God has given
tithes to them for their livelihood, so give them cheerfully, for God loves a
cheerful giver; let us deal bountifully with GOD and his Ambassadors in
this present life, that he may deal bountifully with us, and give us his own
kingdom in the life to come.

The second argument whereby the Apostle proves Melchizedec to be greater than
Abraham, is laid down in the last words of this sixth verse. He that
blesses, is greater than he, that is blessed: but Melchizedec blessed Abraham,
ergo, he is greater than Abraham whom he blessed.

He does not say, him that had so many merits; Abraham the Father of the
faithful had no merits, whereof he might glory before God.

He was not justified in the sight of God by any of his works, but only by
believing the promises: this is our righteousness, to believe the promises of
God.

We are to make a precious account of Gods promises, they be the most excellent
jewels that we can have: he does not say; he blessed him that had silver
and gold, Sheep and Oxen, but the promises.

Abraham was a mervailous rich man, Genesis 24.35. Genesis 14.14.
God had blessed him exceedingly: he had at this time above three hundred
uprising and down-lying in his house, yet the Holy Ghost does not say, he
blessed him that was such a wealthy man, that had such large lands and
possessions, but he blessed him that had the promises. The promises of GOD are
the greatest riches that a man can have: our silver and gold may be taken from
us, but Gods promises shall abide with us for ever.

Now Abraham had not the promises for himself alone: but for all the Children
that believe as he did, Acts 2.39. as he had the promises, so have we: and
let us make much of them: they must be our comfort in all calamities, yea in
death it self: heaven and earth shall pass away, but not a tittle of my word
shall pass unfulfilled: therefore let us highly esteem of the promises of
God: they be the strongest pillars we have to lean upon.

VERSE 7.
THe major proposition of the argument is proved by the confession of all: and
without all contradiction, the less is blessed of the greater: that, which is
of lesser account and reckoning: the thing being put for the person.

I, but is the less blessed of the greater? Jacob blessed Pharaoh, Genesis 47.10.
and 1 Reg. 8.66. the people blessed the King, yet they were not greater than
Solomon: we bless God; yet we are not greater than God, 2 Cor. 1.3.

There is a double blessing: the one improper, the other proper.

Improperly to speak, to bless is to wish well, as to pray for one, 1 Cor.
14.16. So the poor blessed Job. Job 31.20. So inferiors may bless their
superiors, that is, pray to God for them: So the Child may bless the father,
the people the Minister, the subjects the Prince: but properly to speak,
blessing is a pronouncing and an actual bestowing of happiness on them, that
are blessed. Thus God Almighty does bless us all: Luke 24.50.
thus CHRIST blessed his Church at his Ascension into heaven: he left an
actual blessing with them, and in them with us all: thus the Priests in the
name of God blessed the people: and so do we that be the Ministers of the
Gospel at this day: we as Gods Ambassadors and in CHRIST 's stead: 2 Cor. 5.
do not only pronounce a blessing on the People, but by the gracious operation
of Gods Spirit we are as Gods hands to power down a blessing on them. In this
respect we sustain Gods person, and are greater than the people whom we bless.

The Papists ascribe too much to the blessing of the Ministers, and we give too
little to it: they say that a Bishops blessing takes away venial sins.

But that sounds ill: for the blood of CHRIST takes away all sin: yet there is
great force and efficacy in the blessing of faithful Ministers: their curse if
it be lawful, is terrible. The Children whom Elisha cursed, were torn in
pieces with Bears: and their blessing is powerful and effectual; when they
preach, God preaches; and when they bless, GOD blesses. Therefore they that
run out of the Church, before the blessing, despise GOD Himself. GOD by us
blesses you, and will you not set a straw by this blessing?

2. To bless is taken for giving of thanks. So we bless God, we give him
thanks for all his mercies.

3. To bless is to consecrate a thing to an holy use. So God blessed the
seventh day. So the Cup is called the Cup of blessing, because it was blessed
by Christ, and set apart to an heavenly use.

This is a lively demonstration of the Ministers superiority above the people,
without all contradiction -- we bless you, you are blessed of us: therefore
we are greater than you. Isaac blessed Jacob, therefore he was greater than
Jacob. Jacob blessed his twelve sons; therefore he was greater than they: we
as spiritual fathers bless you; therefore we are greater than you. Some of
you may be more honorable, more worshipful, more wealthy then we: yet in
respect of our office we are greater than you. If there be a Gentleman, a
Knight, a Lord, an Earl in the Parish, he must be willing to be blessed by
the Minister: we as Gods deputies bless you in the name of the Lord; in that
respect we are your superiors, highly to be esteemed and reverenced of you
all. You are to receive us, not simply as men, but as men of God; for we are
spiritual fathers that bless you in the name of God, and are as Gods arms to
pull you up into the kingdom of heaven.

VERSE 8.
NOw he comes to the amplification of Melchizedech's greatness by comparing
him with the Levites. The 1. argument to prove Melchizedech's advancement
above the Levits is laid down in this verse: he that is immortal, is greater,
than they that be mortal. Melchizedec is immortal, the Levites are mortal:
ergo. They dying had those that succeeded them, we read of no successor that
Melchizedech had: because if we respect the history, he lives still.

Here, that is, in the Leviticall priesthood; though they be superior to the
people, yet they dye, as the people do.

But there, that is, in Melchizedech.

Though the ministers as God his Lievtenants in spiritual matters receive
tithes, and in that respect are above the people, yet they must not be puffed
up with pride, and swell against their brethren: Here is a cooling card for us
all.

They that take tithes dye, as well as they that give tithes: the most famous
ministers in the world dye. Noah a preacher of righteousness, he was saved in
the Arc, when all the world was drowned: yet he dyed. Moses a renowned
prophet, brought up in all the learning of the Egyptians, catechized and
instructed by God himself, with whom the Lord talked familiarly, as one friend
with an other: yet he dyed. Elias and Elisha were worthy men, honored of all
in their time, the chariots and horsemen of Israel, yet they dyed: John Baptist
was admired of all, all Judea came flocking to him: yet he dyed. The Apostles
were taught by Christ's own mouth, the Holy Ghost descended on them in the
similitude of Cloven tongues, they were the silver trumpets that carried the
sound of the Gospel over all the world, yet they dyed. Let not the high and
magnificent office which we sustain in the church, because we stand in a
pulpit of wood, as Ezra did above all the people, because we are as Gods
stewards to dispose the food of eternal life to them, let not this make us
proud: though we be as perfect Scribes in the Law of the God of heaven, as Ezra
was; as eloquent a man and mighty in the Scriptures, as Apollos: as learned a
man as Paul was, that spoke with tongues more than they al, as powerful a
Preacher, as Elias or John Baptist, as thundering a Preacher, as the Sons of
Bonerges. Though thou had the Bible by heart, as Origin had, of as great
variety of reading as Athanasius -- yet die thou must. They that receive tithes
dye: yea all other receivers dye too. Though thou be a Lawyer that receivest
many hundred Angels in a year: though a Merchant, that receivest much by
traffike: a Clothier, that receivest a great deal by thy Clothes: a Physician
that receivest much by thy physic: though a Gentleman, a Nobleman, that
receivest great rents per annum, it may be a thousand, two thousand, three
thousand pounds, nay, though a King, that receivest much by the crown lands,
by taxes, subsidies, by imposts and other means: how great a receiver soever
thou be, the grave must one day receive thee: all must dye, givers and
receivers too.

Therefore let us so live the short time we have to tarry here, that whenever
death comes, the Angels may receive our souls, and carry them up into Abraham's
bosom.

On the other side, Melchizedec, and Christ live for ever: he Secundum
historiam; Christ Secundum veritatem. Our King, our High Priest lives
continually. In respect of his humanity he dyed, and gave up the Ghost on the
Cross: but in respect of his deity he lives for ever: of his life and kingdom
there is no end. Which may be a singular comfort to all that belong to him.

Our friends dye, our fathers and mothers dye: our Ministers and Preachers dye:
our Magistrates and Governors dye: but Christ Jesus the Protector of the
Church never dies. He lives for ever, and will provide for those that
appertain to him. Though we hear of the death of never so many good men, yet
let us not be cast down with grief, Christ our Savior lives for ever.

VERSE 9.
THe second argument whereby the Apostle proves that Melchizedec is greater
than the Levites: the Levites paid tithes to him, ergo he is greater than they:
therefore Melchizedec must needs be a great man.

Because this might seem to be too acute, more subtle than solid, the
Apostle mollifies it, If I may so speak, if I may use so light a reason (as it
may seem) in so weighty a matter.

The reason is pregnant, and needs no excuse: therefore translate it, and to
say as the thing is.

The tithe-taker, was a tithe-giver.

Which was wont to receive tithes. A participle of the present tense imports an
use and custom, as Matthew. 17.24.25.

(...) may be put for (...): yet here it has his force: by Abraham, as a
mean between them both, as one, that came between them.

Here we see, we may do many things before we are borne.

All we sinned in Adam. When he eat of the forbidden Tree, we eat of it:
when he was banished out of Paradise, we were banished: when he pulled the
wrath of GOD upon him by his disobedience, we pulled the wrath of God on us:
when he gave place to the suggestions of the Devil, we gave place to them:
when he rebelled against God, we rebelled against him, because he was not to
be considered as a private man, but as the root and fountain of all
mankind. When Adam was created in righteousness and true holiness, after the
Image of God; we were then created as glorious Creatures as he. When Adams
body was framed out of the dust of the earth, our bodies were taken out of the
earth: when Adam received a dominion over the beasts of the field, the birds of
the air, the fishes of the Sea; we received a Lordship over all creatures:
when Abraham paid tithes, the tribe of Levi paid tithes.

So we that be Christians may be affirmed to have done many things in Christ;
when he did undergo the burden of his fathers wrath, we sustained it: when
he fulfilled the law, we fulfilled it: when he was crucified on the Cross,
we were crucified to sin: when he dyed, we dyed: his death was a token of
our dying to sin.

When he rose again and ascended into heaven, we his members rose again and
ascended into heaven. When he paid the debt of sin, we paid it, namely by
him, as by our surety.

Let us not then think much of the punishments inflicted on us for sin: that
we have sicknesses and diseases, yea that even poor tender infants of a week
old are sick -- Besides our own sins wherein we were conceived, wherein
we grow up continually, we all sinned in Adam, and when the sentence of death
was pronounced against him, it was pronounced against us all: we were all
guilty of damnation, save that God in mercy has saved many by his Son Christ
Jesus.

CHRIST 's doings are our doings; his obedience, is our obedience; his
satisfaction, is ours; his merits are ours, his righteousness is ours:
therefore though we be poor in our selves, yet we are rich in him; though we
have nothing of our selves, yet in him we possess all things.

VERSE 10.
Here the Apostle shows how Levi paid tithes to Melchizedec, lest it might
seem a paradoxe: he paid tithes to Melchizedec, not in his own person
exclusive, but inclusively in Abraham: he was in his loins potentialiter and
originarie, as the Schoolmen speak: as all creatures were in materia prima.

Levi was in the loins of Abraham secundum concupiscentiam carnalem: Christus
autem secundum solam substantiam corporalem. Aug. lib. 10. de Genesi ad
literam. c. 20. Thom. part. 3. q. 31. art. 8. in semine est visibilis
corpulentia, and invisibilis ratio: in respect of the former, Christ was in the
loins of Abraham: but not in respect of the latter.

But the soundest answer is: Christ in this Antithesis is comprehended under
Melchizedec, which was a type of him, not under Abraham: therefore Christ is
here considered as a taker of tithes in Melchizedec, not as a payer of tithes
in Abraham.

The scope of all is to prove the excellency of Christ's Priesthood, above the
Leviticall Priesthood, whereof the Jews so greatly gloried: the Levits
themselves paid tithes to Christ in Melchizedec; therefore Christ's Priesthood
is by many degrees more excellent then theirs.

There was a worthy and glorious Priesthood in time of the law: there was an
High Priest in goodly apparel, clothed with a white linen Ephod, that had a
Miter on his head, a fair breast plate on his breast, on which was written the
names of the twelve tribes of Israel: he went into the Sanctum Sanctorum once a
year, and offered up the prayers of the people. Besides him there were a great
number of Priests and Levites, throughout all the towns and cities of Israel:
they offered the sacrifices of the people, and made atonement for them before
the Lord: they taught the people and instructed them in the ways of the Lord.

Yet all these are nothing to our Savior Christ: he excells them as much as
the Sun does the Stars, or the body the shadow. They were all but shadows
of him: he is the true High Priest, which is a Priest for ever after the order
of Melchizedec. They were but men, he is God and man: they sinful, he
without sin: they mortal, he immortal: their sacrifices were but figures of
his sacrifice: the blood of Goats Lambs offered by them took away no sin;
his blood purges us from all sin: they received tithes of their brethren;
but they themselves paid tithes to Christ: they prayed for the people in the
Temple; Christ prays for us in heaven. A most glorious High Priest, worthy to
be honored of us all! Let us subject our selves to this High Priest, which
has made us Kings and Priests to God his father, that we may reign with him
our Priest and King in the life to come.

Now if Melchizedec were so great a man, how great is our Savior Christ? does
it you good to look on the Kings picture? then what delight would you take in
the view of the King himself? Melchizedec is but the picture, Christ is the
King and Priest indeed: therefore let us all lift up our minds to him.

Not Abraham alone, not the Priests and Levites alone, but all Kings and
Princes, yea all the Angels in heaven must stoop to Christ. Therefore let us
all meditate in his greatness, which may be a singular comfort to us, that we
have such a great King and Priest as Christ is, who is greater than all
creatures in the world.

Now he comes to Christ prefigured by Melchizedec.

In whom there is to be considered. 1. His calling to the office of the
Priesthood. c. 7. and 8.2. His exequution of that office. c. 9. and 10.

In his calling, 1. The person called, c. 7.2. The function whereunto he was
called, cap. 8.

In the person called, 1. The occasion, why he was called to this excellent
Priesthood ab 11. to 26. 2. A magnificent description of him, that was called
to it a 26. ad finem.

The occasion of his calling was the imperfection of the Leviticall
Priesthood. Above the which the Priesthood of Christ is advanced by four
arguments.

1. From the change of the one, and the firmness of the other, Verse 11.12,
13, 14.

2. From the power and utility of the one, and the weakness and inutility of
the other, Verse 15.16, 17, 18, 19.

3. From the manner of the institution of them both: the one by an oath, the
other without an oath, Verse 20.21, 22.

The 4th. from a difference between the Priests of them both: they were many,
he but one: they dyed, he lives for ever; which is amplified by an effect,
Verse 23.24, 25.

Then follows the description of this our High Priest. Where there is a
commendation of his person, Verse 26.27. and of his Ministry, Verse 28.

VERSE 11.
THe first argument from the change is illustrated by the cause, and the manner
thereof. The cause was, because perfection could not be obtained by it. If we
had been justified, sanctified, delivered from sin and damnation, and brought
to heaven by the Priesthood of the Levites, then why did it not remain still,
why was another Priesthood substituted in the room of it?

For the manner of the change; the Priesthood went not away alone, but the
fall of it was the fall of the law too: and when I speak of the Priesthood, I
speak of the law too: for under it the people received the law.

Some translate the preposition (...) unto: for unto it; namely to put us in
mind of perfection, that was to comeby the Priesthood of CHRIST. The law was
established to the people: but that is further fetched: and the preposition
(...) does signify under, as (...). The law, that is the ceremonial law,
touching sacrifices, washing, observations of times and meats, etc. the law was
given together with the Priesthood, it was an appendix to the Priesthood:
therefore as perfection comes not by the one, no more does it by the other.

The people were lawified, tied and bound with the fetters of the ceremonial
law.

If perfection had been by them, what needed there a further supply? but there
came another Priesthood, and an other law too: therefore the former were
imperfect.

1. For the Priesthood; there arose another Priest of another order, then the
Leviticall Priests were: they were of the order of Aaron, this of Melchizedec.

Rise: not by haphazard, but by Gods own constitution.

Deus and natura nihil faciunt frustra: the wise and omnipotent GOD does
nothing that is needless and unnecessary. If it had not been needful that
another Priest should arise after the order of Melchizedec, the Priesthood of
Aaron might have remained still. If preaching had not been necessary, GOD
would never have instituted preaching. If the Sacraments had not been
necessary helps for the strengthening of our faith, God would never have
ordained the Sacraments: if we could have been justified and made righteous
by our own fulfilling of the law, God would never have sent his Son into the
world, made of a woman and under the law for our sakes: but God sent Christ
into the world to fulfill the law for us; therefore all our righteousness is not
worth a straw. This is the Logic of the Holy Ghost, and all wrangling
Sophisters in the Church of Rome must yield unto it. If Aarons Priesthood
could have perfected us, Christ's Priesthood should never have risen up in the
room thereof.

Wherein we may behold the supereminent dignity of Christ his Priesthood
above the Aaronicall and Leviticall Priesthood. It cannot be denied, but that
Aarons Priesthood was most glorious. As the Psalmist speaks of the Church;
so may we of it: many glorious things are spoken of thee, thou City of God:
many glorious things are recorded of the Leviticall Priesthood. There was a
costly tabernacle, a sumptuous Temple, the wonder of the whole world, there was
an admirable Altar, many oblations and sacrifices, there were sundry Sabbaths
and new Moons, diverse festival days, the feast of unleavened bread, of the
blowing of Trumpets, of Tabernacles, of Dedication, etc. which were kept with
wonderful solemnity, there were many washings and purgings for the clensing of
the people. Vid. Supra.

Therefore let us magnify GOD for this our high Priest by whom we have an
entrance into the kingdom of heaven. The High Priest went into the Holy of
Holies himself, but he carried none of the people with him, they stood
without: our High Priest is not only gone into heaven himself, but he has
also brought us thither: that High Priest offered Bulls, Calves, Lambs for the
sins of the people; this High Priest offered himself for us all. Therefore
let us honor and reverence this our High Priest, let us subject our selves to
him in all things. He that would not obey the High Priest in the time of the
Law, was cut off.

And do ye think we may lawfully contemn our High Priest in the time of the
Gospel? Let us say to him, as the people did to Joshua, whatsoever thou
command us, that will we do -- He has made us all Priests to GOD his
Father, that we should offer up our selves, our souls and bodies, as an holy
and acceptable sacrifice to him: therefore let us show our selves to be
Priests, let us sacrifice the filthy Beast of uncleanness, the ugly and
deformed beast of drunkenness, the insatiable Wolf of covetousness, the
crooked Serpent of Craft and divellish policy, the swelling Toade of pride and
loftiness, the consuming beasts of envy, hatred and malice: let us offer up
the sacrifice of praise to this our High Priest all the days of our life in
this present world, that we may sing praises to him with Saints and Angels for
ever in the world to come. As we say Christ is our Priest, so let us make use
of it to our selves.

VERSE 12.
Upon the change, of the Priesthood necessarily follows the change of the
law too. The Jews were stubborn defenders of the Ceremonial law above all
things: they could not abide to hear of any change of it. Some might reply and
say; though the Priesthood be gone, yet the law may continue still. Nay,
says the Apostle, these stand and fall together: they were instituted
together, chickens of one hatching; therefore they live and dye together. The
Leviticall Priesthood and the Ceremonial law are relatives, se mutuo ponunt
and auferunt.

He does not openly say; if the Priest hood be abolished, then the law is
abolished: the Jews being zealous of the law could not as yet endure that.
Therefore he mollifies his speech, using a more soft and gentle term: if the
Priesthood be changed. Yet in effect it is all one: they changed, as Festus
and Felix did. Felix went out of the country, and Festus came in his room: So
the Leviticall Priesthood went away, gave place to Christ's Priesthood, which
is come in the room thereof, transposed, put out of place, altered.

He does not say; then by all probability, there must be a change of the law:
but of necessity, it cannot be avoided.

The moral law remains still, but the ceremonial law vanishes away with the
Priesthood. As Christ is come into Aarons room, so likewise into Moses room:
he is our Lawgiver, as well as our Priest.

The Pope in his Decretalls applies this to himself: but it is proper to our
Savior Christ. He may as well conclude from hence, that he is a Priest after
the order of Melchizedec, as that he has power to make laws as Moses had.

In this world there is nothing but changing. The world is like the Moon, that
is ever changing: like the Sea, that is ebbing and flowing: sometimes calm,
sometimes boisterous, it never stands at one stay. So the Priesthood is
changed: instead of the Leviticall Priesthood is established the Ministry of
the Gospel. Kingdoms and nations change. The four mighty Monarchies of the
world are changed. The famous Churches of Assia, to the which Christ writes,
that once embraced the Gospel of Christ, are now changed, they now receive
Mahomet for their God and Savior. England which was once rude and barbarous,
is now become civil and religious.

The time was, when Churchmen were the greatest men in this kingdom; now the
Lawyers carry all away: but that nail of the Cart wheel, which is now aloft
may hereafter be in the dirt. Daily experience teaches us, what changes there
be in towns and cities. A town that had many wise and grave governors in
it, has now scarce any that will look to the government of the town.

A town which a while ago was wealthy, a great number of rich men in it, in
the turning of an hand becomes poor and beggarlie.

Men themselves change, sometimes they love, sometimes hate; sometimes they are
whole, sometimes sick: one while in their thousands as Job was; shortly after
scant worth a Groat. Here is nothing but changing. The Leviticall Priesthood
was changed, and there shall be a change of the Ministry of the Gospel too:
the time shall come, when as there shall be no Churches to go to, no
Scriptures to read over, no Ministers to preach to us, and show us the way to
heaven: for when we be in the celestial Jerusalem, what need shall we have of
the Ships and Charrets that carry us thither? when we be in heaven, we shall
not need the ladder of the Ministry, to climb up into heaven. Nay, there
shall be a change of the world it self: the earth whereon we tread shall be
changed: this earth shall be burnt with all the works thereof: the Sun, the
Moon, the Stars, the goodly firmament over our heads shall be changed: they
all wax old as does a garment, and as a vesture shall thou change them: yet
here is nothing but laboring for these changeable things; these reeds,
feathers, weather-cockes, these fading flowers, are the chiefest things we
seek after; there is moyling and toyling for these, men are at daggers drawing
for them; all our striving and contending is about them: as for the favor of
God in CHRIST, the blessed hope of our election and salvation in the kingdom
of heaven, few strive for them. Peradventure we wish to be in heaven, as
Balaam did; but we strive not for it as we ought to do: all that we hunt after
is silver and gold, houses and lands, the trash of this transitory world; but
we seek not for that which is unchangeable and lasts for ever. In other
things we cannot away with change: we would not willingly take a piece of
Cloth, which we know will change the color.

We all know that this miserable world will change color, the glory thereof
will fade away, yet we are most greedy of it. Who will buy an house that he
knows will change and that speedily? that stands to day, and is ready to fall
to morrow? Such an house is this world: yet there is nothing but beating our
brains about it: all things in this world are changeable, therefore let us
love them and use them, as if we loved and used them not. Let us especially
long after that change, when Christ shall change our vile bodies, and make them
like his glorious body, where we shall remain with him without change for
ever and ever.

VERSE 13.
THe law being taken away with the Priesthood, he comes again to prove the
change of the Priesthood, a pari.

The Tribe is changed: therefore the Priesthood. The Leviticall Priests were
all of the Tribe of Levi: this is not of that Tribe, but of another.

To whom these things are referred, as to their scope and mark

Spoken in the Psalm, that is the promised Messiah: for the Jews themselves
confess that the Psalmist speaks this of him, Matthew. 22. ver. 46.

Is partaker of another Tribe.

As the Levites did.

None of that Tribe did: therefore he could not.

Did so much as draw near to the Altar: gave themselves to the Altar, meddled
with the Altar, Temple or Ceremonies.

All the Priests in the time of the law were of the Tribe of Levi: Our Savior
Christ is a Priest, as the Scripture testifies of him: thou art a Priest for
ever after the order of Melchizedec; yet he is not of the Tribe of Levi:
therefore that Priesthood is abolished, and Christ's Priesthood is to
continue: another Priest is risen up that is not of the order of Aaron. Christ
pertains to another tribe, whereof none served at the Altar.

The Altar being a principal part of the Leviticall service is put for the
whole.

All the lawful Ministers of the Old Testament were of the Tribe of Levi: this
is an axiom in this place. Sundry of the Pharisees which were interpreters of
the Law, were not of the Tribe of Levi. Saint Paul was a Pharisee, yet of the
tribe of Benjamin: notwithstanding our Savior wills the people to hear them:
therefore though Ministers are not such sometime as were to be wished, yet so
long as they preach sound doctrine, they are to be heard: that by the way.

What though he appertain to another Tribe? yet he may be a Priest after the
order of Aaron? nay, for none of this tribe served at the Altar.

Every one in the Commonwealth of Israel might not be a Priest: though the
Messiah came of the Tribe of Judah, yet none of that Tribe might serve at the
Altar. In an army every one must keep his station: the common Soldier must
not be a Captain, unless he be called thereunto: a Bow-man must not be a
Bill-man, unles he be appointed thereunto: So is it in a well ordered estate;
every man must not presume to expound Scripture, to Minister the Sacraments, to
be a Preacher, unless he be called, as Aaron was.

2 Samuel 6.7.
Vzzah put his hand to the Arc, when it was in danger of falling, but he was
stricken with sudden death. Vzziah being a King presumed to offer incense, 2 Chronicles. 26.
but he was a Leaper for it all the days of his life. Then what malepart
boldness is it for a private man to step up into the Pulpit, and to take upon
him without warrant to be as GOD's mouth to the people? Yet some in a jolly
humor have done it: whom God has punished one way or other. None of the Tribe
of Judah served at the Altar. Let every man abide in that calling wherein God
has set him. Let us serve in those places which GOD in wisdom has allotted
to us. But though they served not at the Altar, yet they served in other
functions: none, of what Tribe so ever, of what condition soever, must be
idle: we must all serve God in some place or other. Some serve as Kings: it is
a service to be a King. The Philosopher calls a King Servum publicum: and the
Lord himself calls David, his servant, when he was a King. Nebuchadnezar that
mighty Monarch was Gods servant. Some serve as Counselors to the King for
the good of the commonwealth: some serve as Judges, some as Lawyers, some as
Merchants, Clothiers, Weavers, Husbandmen, etc. We must all serve God, and one
another in love, in some calling or other. The eye serves one way for the
benefit of the body: the ear another way: the hand another way, and the foot
the lowest part of the body serves too; the service whereof is so necessary, as
that the body cannot be without it. We may serve God to his glory and our own
comfort in the meanest calling that is: and let us all so serve him in our
several places in this world, that we may reign with him in the world to
come.

The Apostle does not say, whereof no man ruled at the Altar. It cannot be
denied, but that Ministers in some sort are rulers of the people: Acts 23.5.
Hebr. 13.17.
obey them that have the oversight of you in the Lord: yet our office must not
puff us up with pride; we must remember it is a service, yea a painful and
an honorable service. He that desires the office of a Bishop, desires a
worthy work, on us rather than honos, prodesse rather than praesse, 2 Cor.
4.5. Our selves your servants for CHRIST 's sake. Yet it is not a base service,
as some imagine, and in reproach they will say of a Minister, he serves at such
a town. We grant we are servants: yet in an high and honorable place: we
serve in the Church, the house of God, as stewards do in a Noble man's house: we
dispense to you the food of life. Therefore as all the household honors the
steward: so ought all the parish to honor the Minister.

VERSE 14.
TO put it out of all doubt, he shows to what Tribe this Priest
appertains: he proves it by the common voice and testimony of all: it is a
clear case, all confess it.

Of whom it is said; the Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand, etc.

As the Sun dispelling the clouds and darkness of the night, rises in the
morning and scatters his beams over all the world: So the Son of
righteousness rose, dispelling the foggie mists of the ceremonial law, and
spreading the light of the Gospel over all the world.

Judah: both on his supposed fathers side, Luke 2.4. and on his mothers side,
Luke 1.27.

It seems that Christ pertained to the Tribe of Levi too.

1. Elizabeth was Mary's Couzin: she was Wife to Zachary, which was of the
Tribe of Levi: now they were to marry in their own Tribes.

Sol: They of the Tribe of Levi might take Wives out of other Tribes, so as the
inheritance were not transported out of the Tribe, as 2 Chronicles. 22.11. yet the
men, not the women, gave the denomination of the Tribe, and the child was not
said to be of that Tribe whereof his mother was, but whereof his father was.

2. Nathan was of the Tribe of Levi: yet Christ came of him, Luke 3.31.

It was not Nathan the Prophet, but one of David's sons of that name, 2 Samuel
5.14.

It is manifest, Christ was of the Tribe of Judah, the Son of David,
concerning which -- Moses Gods Scribe and Penman of that, that was deputed to
the Priest hood.

The Tribe is changed: ergo, the Priesthood.

It pleased CHRIST to come of the Tribe of Judah, not for any holiness that
was in Judah above the rest of the twelve Patriarchs. Judah himself committed
incest with his daughter, though unknown to him; at the least he took her to
be an Whore, and lay with her: but our Savior made choice of this Tribe, of
his own gracious goodness.

Though CHRIST descended of the Tribe of Judah, yet all of that Tribe were not
said. There are sealed as many thousands of all other Tribes as of that: and of
that Tribe, as Kings and others, are noted to be wicked men. Therefore we must
not flatter our selves in any outward prerogatives, as the Papists do. They
have a part of the coat, wherein Christ went to be crucified, some of the
nails wherewith he was fastened to the Cross: they make pilgrimages to the
Sepulcher of Christ, etc. All these are nothing to salvation.

Though thou could derive thy generation from Christ according to the flesh:
though thou had been one of Christ's brethren, if possible, lien in the
same womb, yet that makes thee not the nearer to the kingdom of heaven. Lay
hold on Christ with a lively faith, labor to say with Paul, I live, and yet
not I, but the Son of God lives in me; then thou shall be eternally saved.

Our LORD CHRIST is often honored in Scripture with this title: it may
worthily be adscribed to him. He created us of nothing, preserves and
upholdeth us being created, he bought us with his precious blood, when we were
worse than nothing: therefore justly is he our Lord. This we confess in our
Creed. And in Jesus Christ our Lord, this we profess in our prayers, which
end thus, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Yet we use him not as our Lord: ye
call me Master and Lord, and ye do well; but then ye ought to behave your
selves as dutiful and obedient servants to me. Servants go and come at the
commandment of their Lord. I have servants under me, says the Centurion; I
say to one, go, and he goes, do this, and he does it. Do we deal so with
Christ our Lord? he says come not at the Alehouse, there to sit quaffing and
swilling till reason be buried in you: yet we will be as drunken as Apes, as
we use to speak. Our Lord says, your bodies are mine, they be my members,
and the temples of the Holy Ghost; do not prostitute them to Whores and
Harlots: yet we will do it. Our Lord says, one thing is necessary: prefer
the hearing of my Word before all worldly businesses: yet if there be a Sermon
in the Town, and a paltry fair a little from the Town, we will prefer the
fair before the Sermon, Christ shall speak to the walls for all us. Our Lord
says, use my name reverently in all your talk; yet we will make it as common
as a Tennis ball, and swear by God and Christ at every word. Is this to call
Christ Lord? Christ has the name of our Lord, and the Devil has our service;
what a monstrous thing is this? As in word we call Christ Lord, so let our
deeds show us to be his servants: we are bought with a price, we are not our
own, but Jesus Christ's: therefore let us glorify him in our Spirits and
bodies, which be his.

VERSE 15.
THe second Argument is taken from the discrepant creation of Priests: he that
is made a Priest after an heavenly and Spiritual manner, is greater then they
that are made after an earthly and carnal manner; our Savior Christ is made
after an heavenly and Spiritual manner, they after an earthly and carnal
manner; therefore he is greater then they.

He makes an entrance into it by the cleerenesse and evidencie of the case.
More abundantly evident: that the Leviticall Priesthood is gone, and the
Priesthood of Christ is come into the room of it.

If after: but (...) is put for (...), is evident, because he is created after
an other manner.

Before he said, (...), Verse 11. now (...).

Some of the Jesuits being notable fishers have found a deep mystery in this
pond, the alteration of the word.

And wherein I pray you consists this similitude? It must needs be in this,
and nothing but this.

That as Melchizedec offered bread and wine, as a sacrifice of praise to God,
after Abraham's victory: So our Savior Christ offered his body and blood under
the shape of bread and wine in the Supper: for this cause, and for this cause
alone, or chiefly and principally he is a Priest after the order of
Melchizedec: and in the end having the stream of all the fathers running with
them, they desire Christ to confound us that strive against it.

But cannot Christ be a Priest after the similitude of Melchizedec, unless it
be in this? Surely then he is not a Priest at all after the similitude of
Melchizedec: for Melchizedec offered no bread and wine. The Hebrew is Hotziah,
protulit, non obtulit, Genesis 14.18.
as their own vulgar Interpreter does translate it, and the Septuaginta
expound it (...): that is a confirmation of Melchizedec's kingdom, not of his
Priesthood: as a King, of his Prince-like liberality he brought forth out of
his storehouse plenty of bread and wine, to refresh Abraham and his men after
the battle: he brought them forth, not to offer them to God, but to comfort
Abraham and his wearied Soldiers withal. Therefore concerning the forged
sacrifice of the Mass, Christ can be no Priest after the similitude of
Melchizedec.

1. Melchizedec offered no bread nor wine at all.

2. If he did, he offered the substance of bread and wine, not the shows
alone, as the Papists do: therefore in this he cannot be a Priest after the
similitude of Melchizedec: for Melchizedec did never any thing like to this.

But in sundry other respects he is a Priest after the similitude of
Melchizedec.

1. As Melchizedec being a Priest of the most high God, blessed Abraham and
prayed to God for him: So Christ blesses and prays for his Church, Verse 25.

2. As Melchizedec is said to live for ever, because there is no mention of his
death in the Scripture: So Christ lives for ever, and of his Priesthood there
is no end.

3. As Melchizedec was a Priest, yet not made after the manner of other
Priests, but had an extraordinary calling from God: so CHRIST is made a Priest,
not after the manner of the Leviticall Priesthood, but after a more excellent
sort, as Melchizedec was.

4. As Melchizedec was a King and a Priest too: So was our SAVIOR CHRIST: in
these senses He is a Priest after the similitude of Melchizedec, not in that
sense which the Papists imagine.

The man of GOD, and dispenser of the Word that is appointed to teach the
people, whether he does it by word of mouth or writing, must make things
clear and evident unto them. It was evident by that which he said in the
former Verse; that the Priesthood is changed, because the tribe consecrated to
the Priesthood is changed: yet not contenting himself with that, he makes it
a great deal more evident in these Verses. A mystery of Religion cannot be
too evident to the people: A Preacher must be as plain as possible he can,
as plain as a pike-staffe, as we use to speak.

Hence it is that Preachers are compared to Nurses: a Nurse though she have a
fine, flowing and eloquent tongue, yet she will speak plainly to the Child:
So must we to those Children whom God has put to us to nurse, when we deliver
the sincere milk of the Word to them. Who has more learning then God, the
fountain of all Wisdom? yet the Scripture which is his Word, is the plainest
writing in the world: he is the best Preacher, and draws nearest to God
Almighty, that speaks most plainly to the capacity of the people. Neh. 8.8.
They in Ezra gave the sense, and made the people to understand it: as for
those that affect obscurity, that love to speak in the clouds, that desire
rather to be admired for an opinion of learning, then to profit and benefit the
people, they can have no comfort of their labor. Heraclitus that was surnamed
(...), is reproved by the rest of the Philosophers. Heretical teachers have
been dark: but the true teachers have been perspicuous. St. Hierome had more
ado to understand Iovinian, then to confute him. Arrius was obscure in setting
down his heresy: whereas St. Aug. had rather speak false Latin, to say
Ossum for os, then he would not be comprehended by the people. Our Apostle
here strives to make the alteration of the Priesthood more and more evident.
Indeed the Papists holding it the best policy to keep the people in ignorance,
are of purpose obscure in their writings and sayings. The Rhemes Testament of
late years set forth in English is so dark, such inck-horne terms, so many
Latin words unenglished, as that the common people cannot understand it: even
as good as Aristotle's physickes, that were (...) and (...): but as for us, that
be sincere Preachers of the Word, which seek Gods glory and the profit of the
people more than our own credit and estimation; let us labor to make that
evident which we speak.

VERSE 16.
NOw he shows how this is more evident, by the manner of creation of this
Priest, far different from the creation of Priests in the law.

Not of the Law of a Carnal Commandment: not after the rite and manner of the
ceremonial Law, as Aaron and his Sons were.

The ceremonial Law is termed the carnal Commandment, because it did consist
in carnal and outward observations, that were not to continue long, Hebr.
9.10. Ephesians. 2.15.

At the consecration of Aaron and his Sons, very costly and glorious apparel
was provided, which were put on their backs: an Ephod, a breast plate, a
miter, Exodus 28.1. two Rams and a young Calfe without blemish, Exodus 29. were
offered up to God for them, and a box of holy oil was powered on their heads.
CHRIST being a Priest after the order of Melchizedec, had no such outward
solemnity, but was anointed with the oil of the spirit above his fellows,
and clothed with the white robe of unspotted innocence, that was to be found
in no Priest in the time of the law: therefore his Priesthood is more
excellent then theirs.

But after the power of an endless life, that is, after that powerful manner
which it pleased God to show in the Gospel, that brings with it an endless
life.

If he had made a direct opposition, it should have been thus, but after the
Law of the Spiritual Commandment: yet he speaks more emphatically. Instead
of Law he uses the word power, because both our Savior Christ and the Gospel
is the power of God to salvation, To. 1. Instead of ( Commandment) he uses the
word ( life) describing the Gospel by the effect thereof: because it is a
living word, and brings men to life everlasting.

Instead of ( Carnal) he says ( endless.) Carnal things have end, wherein
the Leviticall Priesthood stood: but the Gospel entreats of endless joys
in heaven, which we have by it.

The law was carnal, and had an end: but the Gospel is spiritual, and gives
an endless life. As for this life, though we spend it in never so great
wealth, health, ease, honor and prosperity: yet it must have an end: the end
of all flesh is come before me -- the end of all things is at hand: though as
strong as Samson, as wise as Solomon, as beautiful as Absalom, though thou
farest deliciously every day, and art clothed in fine linen and purple, though
thou could live almost a thousand years, as Methusalem did, and thy head,
if possible, not ache all the while; yet thy life must have an end: therefore
let us all thirst after the endless life, the which, for so much as the
Gospel brings with it, let it be reverently and greedily embraced by us all:
let us come to Church with all cheerfulness, hear prayers and Sermons with
all diligence, practice that which we hear with all conscience, that when this
short life, which is but a span long shall be ended, we may have an endless
life in all joy and happiness in the world to come.

CHRIST was created after a more glorious manner than the Priests of the Law:
therefore his Priesthood is greater than theirs.

VERSE 17.
THis he confirms, first by a divine testimony.

He, that is, GOD the Father by the mouth of David.

Thou art a Priest, not for a time, as they were, but for ever.

Not after the order of Aaron, as they were: but after the order of Melchizedec.

Both the parts of Christ's Priesthood are everlasting: his sacrifice and his
intercession.

In his sacrifice is to be considered the act of oblation, the fruit and
efficacy of it. As for the act of oblation, it passed away on the Cross: he
was but once offered, and that by himself: no mortal man can offer Christ;
yet the fruit and efficacy of his sacrifice is perpetual: which is the taking
away of all the sins of all the faithful in the world.

As for his intercession, the Scripture is clear in that, Romans 8.34. still he
makes intercession in heaven for us: therefore he is a Priest for ever, after
the order of Melchizedec. Earthly Priests dye, but this our Priest never dies:
who as he lives for ever in the Temple of heaven; so he will one day assume
us to himself, and we shall live there for ever with him.

VERSE 18.
2. HE proves that Christ was created after a more glorious manner then the
Priests of the Law, by the qualities of these two: the one is temporal, the
other perpetual.

There is an abrogation, a putting out of place: it is put out of the Saddle.

Of the Commandment, that is, of the ceremonial law, that went before, after
the which they were made Priests: that commandment is abolished, it is no
longer of any force.

Here the Jesuits again show themselves very acute: their wit mounteth above
the Moon.

The old Mandate is gone: and the new Mandate is come in the room thereof. The
old Mandate is the Leviticall Priesthood, with the sacrifices thereof: the new
Mandate is the Gospel, with the sacrifice thereof, which is the Mass. The old
Mandate is disannulled: and the new Mandate of the Mass is instituted instead
thereof, whereof Maundy Thursday has his name, quasi, Mandat Thursday; because
then the old Mandate of the Paschall Lamb was abolished, and the new Mandate
of the sacrifice of the Mass was ordained in the Supper.

It was once called Sheare-Thursday: because the Priests did sheare their hair
and shave their Crowns on that day: afterward it had the name of Maundy
Thursday, in our English tongue, not of the Latin word mandatum, (that is
far fetched) but rather of the English word, Maund or basket, because the
people brought their provision for feasting on that day in Maunds or baskets.

Or if they will needs derive it from the Latin, it may be called Mandy
Thursday of Mando, because CHRIST did eat both the Passover and the Supper
with his Disciples on that day. But as for this new Etymology from Mandatum,
it has no sense in it. Love one another, is called the new Mandate; but the
Supper has never that name: but I think the Jesuits make this note, rather to
show their wit than their Divinity.

The abrogation of the Leviticall law and Priesthood stands on good ground:
it was weak and unprofitable; therefore no reason it should continue.

It had no strength to purify the soul, to make clean the conscience, to
carry men into the kingdom of heaven, to purge them from sin, to make them
righteous before God: it was weak and unprofitable for these things: therefore
worthy to be abolished, Hebr. 9.9.

He does not say it was abolished, because it was naught: the law was good for
the end why it was appointed, to shadow out Christ, and our redemption
purchased by him; but weak and unprofitable to work our redemption: it was
strong and profitable ad figurandum, but not ad praestandum: it could not
perform that which was signified by it.

(...): because of its own weakness: Gal. 4 9.
The moral law was weak in regard of us, Romans 8.3. but the ceremonial law was
weak in it self: men might do that which was enjoined by it; but the doing of
it could not justify and sanctify them.

The Law was before the Gospel, yet the Gospel is more worthy than it:
darkness went before the light; the night before the day: yet the day is more
glorious than the night. All creatures were made before man: yet man excels
them all. John Baptist went before Christ: yet he was not worthy to unloose
the latchet of Christ's shoe: the Sword Bearer goes before the Mayor; yet he
is not greater than the Mayor. All things are not to be esteemed by their
precedence and priority in the world: there comes one after me, said John,
yet in honor and dignity he is before me: So the Gospel comes after the
Law, yet it is more excellent than the Law.

If the comparison be made between God and creatures, then this is a firm
Axiom: that which went before is best. God went before all creatures:
therefore he is above all creatures. Christ is the first begotten of every
creature, that is, which was begotten of the eternal essence of the Father
before all creatures, therefore to be preferred before them all. But if that
comparison be between creatures, then that Axiom is of no force.

A thing may be said to be unprofitable,

1. Simply, then comparatively: Simply and in it self sin is unprofitable,
whereupon it is called the unfruitful works of darkness: there is no fruit,
no commodity in them. Swearing is an unprofitable thing, Adultery is an
unprofitable thing, it pulls Gods vengeance on men, Whoremongers and
Adulterers God will judge. Lying is an unprofitable thing: men may gain by it:
but what advantageth it a man to win the whole world and loose his own
soul? these are unprofitable simply in themselves.

But the ceremonial Law is unprofitable in respect of the Gospel: that could
only shadow out heavenly things: but it could not give us heavenly things. The
washings that were in the law could signify our washing in the blood of
Christ, but they could not purge us from sin, as the blood of Christ does:
the sacrificing of Sheep, Oxen, Rams, could tell them there was a Lamb to come
that should be offered on the Altar of the Cross for the sins of the world,
but they could not take away sin: in this respect the law was weak and
unprofitable.

On the contrary side, the Gospel is a strong and profitable thing: profitable
to illuminate us in the mystery of our redemption; to justify us, and cloth
us with the righteousness of Christ, that we may appear unblameable in the
sight of God; to sanctify us and make us new Creatures in Christ Jesus; to
assure us of the remission of all our sins, and to carry us up into the
kingdom of heaven. Godliness is profitable for all things, says Paul: So the
Gospel is profitable for all things: It is profitable for the things of this
world: GOD blessed the house of Obed Edom where the Arc was: and God blesses
those Towns and Cities where the Gospel is sincerely and truly practiced:
but especially it is profitable to bring us to the joys of heaven in the world
to come.

An argument from profit is very forcible. This was Hamans coozenage. It is not
for the Kings profit to suffer them; and it prevailed much. Nothing so
profitable as the Gospel; therefore let us all be greedy of it. Why are men so
desirous of Sheep? because they are profitable creatures: Why do men give so
much money for an office? because it is profitable, and brings great gains
with it: Why do men strive to make their Sons Lawyers? because the Lawyers go
away with all the profit. The Gospel of all things is most profitable:
profitable for this life, to procure us the peace of conscience in this world,
and to save us in the world to come. Therefore let us embrace the Gospel with
both arms. When the Merchant heard of a Pearl that surpassed all others, he
sold all and bought it: the Gospel is the Pearl of Pearls, above thousands
of gold and silver: therefore let us redeem it, though it be with the loss of
all our worldly goods: the Gospel is profitable for all things; therefore make
much of it.

The reason of the abrogation of the law is to be observed by us: it was
d^sannulled, because of the weakness and unprofitablenesse thereof: whereby
we may gather, that all weak and unprofitable things, that are not availeable
to the kingdom of heaven, shall be abolished: such is the wit, the wisdom,
the learning, the eloquence of the world; they be fine things, of great price
with worldly men: yet because they are unprofitable for heavenly things, they
are and shall be abolished. Where is the Scribe and the disputer of this world?
their place is no where to be found.

We our selves are weak and unprofitable touching spiritual and heavenly
matters: when we have done all that we can, we must say, we are unprofitable
servants.

We are all weak and unprofitable for heavenly matters: therefore we our
selves also must be abolished, and Christ Jesus must be all and in all.

VERSE 19.
THe weakness and unprofitablenesse of the ceremonial law is proved by the
inability thereof.

Nothing, that is, no man, Ioh. 6.37. the neuter gender is fittest ad
universitatem designandam. Theophyl.

This is illustrated by the contrary effect in the Gospel.

Some refer both branches to the Law: but was an introduction of a better
hope; as Porphyrius Isagoge to Aristotle's praedicaments: as the Apostle says,
the Law was our Schoolmasters to bring us to Christ, Gal. 3.24.

But, 1. It is not (...), but (...): not an induction, but a superinduction:
that is, the Gospel superinduced upon the abrogation of the law.

2. Then he would have said, (...), to a better hope, not of a better hope.

It is rather to be referred to the Gospel opposed to the Law, and the verb
in the Text to be repeated, not a new verb supplied out of the Text: but the
Gospel bringing in a better hope makes perfect, through JESUS CHRIST the
author and object of the Gospel.

We could not hope for salvation by the ceremonial Law: but we may be bold to
hope for it by the Gospel.

By the introduction of which hope we draw near to God. The people in the time
of the ceremonial law, stood without, when the Priest was offering within, as
Luke 1.10. and at the delivery of the moral law, they might not come near the
mount, where God was: but in regard of the good news, that the Gospel
brings, our reconciliation being made by Christ, we may boldly come near,
as Priest, to offer our prayers to him in the name of Christ, and to beg any
thing at His hands, Hebr. 4.16. yea by him we may draw near to God in heaven.

The Tabernacle, Temple, the purifications and washings, the observation of new
Moons and Sabbaths, the oblation of Rams, Sheep, Bulls, Oxen, in the time of
the Law, these did lead them by the hand to Christ, in whom they should have
all perfection: but these did not perfect the people. On the contrary side,
the bringing in of a better hope by Jesus Christ, the Author and subject of the
Gospel, that does perfect us.

What better hope is this? had not the Fathers in the time of the Law as good
an hope as we? Yes verily. Though some fondly collect from hence, that they had
hope only of temporal things, we of eternal; that is crooked and broken
Divinity. The fathers did eat of the same spiritual meat, and drank of the
same spiritual drink that we do. Abraham saw the day of Christ, and was
glad, as we be: they had the same hope of everlasting happiness by Jesus
Christ, that we have: here is the only difference; they had that hope by
faith in the promised Messiah, not by the observation of the Law. The
opposition is here made, not between the persons that lived in the time of the
Law, and those that live in the time of the Gospel; but between the Law and
Christ: or, between the Law and the Gospel.

The Law could not put us in good hope of everlasting happiness, or the favor
of God; but the Gospel did: that has brought in a better hope.

One sweet and comfortable fruit of that hope is this: that by it we draw nigh
to God. By nature we are Gods enemies, and run away from God, as Adam did,
when he had sinned: but by grace in Jesus Christ, being justified by faith in
him, we have peace with God, and a comfortable access to his Majesty.
Ahasuerus held out his golden Scepter to Hester, and she drew near to him: So
God being reconciled to us by CHRIST holds forth the golden Scepter of his
favor to us, and we draw near to him. What a prerogative is this, that we
may draw near to the high and mighty God, which in himself is a consuming
fire? We think it a great favor to draw near to an earthly King, to kiss
his hand, to speak our mind freely to him: that noble man is greatly honored
that can in such sort draw near to the King. We have all free access by Jesus
Christ to the King of Kings, we may boldly draw near to him, and prefer our
supplications to him: we need not stand aloof off, and go to God by the
Virgin Mary and the Saints triumphing in heaven; by the Meditation of Christ
alone we may draw near to God Himself, and say Our father, as Christ ^eacheth
us: he bears such a love to us as that Christ Himself protests in the
Gospel; I say not that I will pray to the Father for you, Ioh. 16.27.
the Father Himself loves you. Therefore let us with a Christian confidence
draw near to him. This may be an unspeakeable comfort to us in all calamities,
in sickness, in poverty; when we have crosses in our souls, in bodies,
goods or name, when any thing grieveth us, let us draw near to our heavenly
father, and power forth our griefs into his bosom: he tenders us as the Apple
of his own eye, and will not deny us any thing that is good.

2. As we draw near to him in all our troubles by hearty prayer in this life;
so by Christ our blessed Savior we shall draw near to him in his own
kingdom in the life to come, where we shall eat of the hidden Manna, and of
the tree of life in the Paradise of God for ever.

Behold then what a singular blessing we have by CHRIST, such as the Law could
never have given to us: therefore let us be thankful to God for it, let us
love the Lord Jesus Christ by whom we draw near to God: let the love of Christ
constrain us to forsake our sins, which banished us out of Gods kingdom: let
us glorify Christ by whom we have this access to God in this present world,
that we may be partakers of his eternal glory in the world to come.

VERSE 20.
THe third argument is taken from the manner of the institution of both
Priest-hoods. He that is made a Priest with an oath, is greater than they that
are made without an oath. Christ was made a Priest with an oath: the Levites
without an oath. Ergo.

The consequence of the proposition is evident: it must needs be a great thing,
and of singular weight and importance, which God Almighty ratifieth with an
oath. God Almighty swore at the consecration of our High Priest; so did he not
at the consecration of Aaron and his Sons: therefore he is greater than they.

Both the parts of the assumption are expressed in the Text: and the conclusion
is emphatically inferred, Verse 22.

For so much as Christ was not made a Priest without an oath, whereas those in
the time of the Law were.

The word of the high and eternal God, which is truth it self, in whom there
is not a shadow of turning, is sufficient to procure credit and authority to
that which he speaks. By the word of a King, as we use to say: nothing can
be more sure. Shall not then the word of the King of Kings be believed? but
when an oath is annexed to it, we ought the rather to be confirmed in it.

Now there be three principal things which God swears in Scripture.

The first, is the eternity and perpetuity of Christ's Priesthood: he has not
only said, but sworn, thou art a Priest for ever -- Which is a singular
comfort to us all: we may be bold to believe Gods oath. Our Priest that makes
intercession for us, lives for ever.

The second thing, is the destruction of the wicked, of stubborn and
disobedient persons, that by Gods voice in the Ministry of the word will not
be reclaimed from their sins. I have sworn in my wrath, that such shall never
enter into my rest. God swear that none of those that came out of Egypt, save
Caleb and Joshua should enter into the land of Canaan. It came so to pass, all
their Carhasses fell in the wilderness. God has sworn, that such as have the
Trumpet of the word continually sounding in their ears, and yet will lie
snorting in their sins, shall perish eternally. Therefore let us tremble at it
and believe it.

The third thing that God has sworn unto in the Scripture is the salvation of
the faithful, Hebr. 6.18.
that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie, we
might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the
hope set before us. Have thou a true and lively faith in CHRIST, which is
fruitful in all good works, as Dorcas was? and can say with Saint Paul, I
live; yet not I, but CHRIST in me, etc. GOD has sworn that thou shall be
saved: therefore doubt not of it. Though the Devil walk about as a roaring
Lion seeking to devour us: though he labor to win now us as Wheat, though
through the corruption of our nature we fall into many sins, as the holiest
of all does sometimes fall, though we be visited with grievous sicknesses,
though brought to poverty, though death is before our eyes; yet let us not
stagger about our salvation, we have Gods Word and oath for it: therefore
undoubtedly we shall be saved. Howsoever we be here tossed in the Waves of
this miserable world, yet at length we shall arrive at the haven of eternal
rest. Shall God swear a thing, and not perform that which he has sworn?

VERSE 21.
WE never read of an oath, when the Priests under the Law were set apart to
the Priesthood.

On the other side this our high Priest was made with an oath.

Where, 1. The substance of the oath: 2. The immutabilitie of it.

There is a compound verb in the Greek: not (...), but (...), of (...) and
(...), of (...), or (...), with the swearing of an oath: which is more
emphaticall then to say simply, with an oath. God did swear an oath when he
appointed him to be High Priest.

By him, that is God the father, that said to him.

He introduces the words of the Psalm, tu. It is put discretive, thou and no
other.

He will admit of no after-thought to amend the former.

Men repent oftentimes of their words and oaths too: but God will never repent
of this oath: that which he has sworn in this oath is immutable.

Object. Genesis 6.6. 1 Samuel 15.11.

Sol: It is a figurative speech: for properly to speak, God cannot repent,
Number. 23.19. Men repent of a thing, either for want of knowledge and foresight
into the thing, or by reason of the mutability and inconstancy of their
affections: neither of these are incident to God: he knows all things before
they come to pass; so do not we: therefore we repent and say, if I had known
this, I would never have done it. GOD knows all things aforehand: therefore
he cannot repent.

2. We repent because we are mutable, like the Weather-Cocke, and like little
Children, that are won with an Apple, and lost with a Nutt, that makes us
repent of many things. Every new Tale carries us away. It is not so with GOD:
he yesterday and to day the same for ever: therefore he cannot repent. When
he is said in Scripture to repent, it is spoken for our capacity* for the
which cause the Scripture brings him in angry and chiding as men are wont to
do: and yet no anger in GOD: as we if we have entertained a man into our
service and he proves not according to our mind, then we repent that ever we
took him into our service: so the Scripture applying Gods doings to our
capacity introduces God repenting. Man that was created after mine own image
is become brutish in his manners, more disobedient to me then any other
creature: therefore it repents me that I made man. Saul proves a bad King:
therefore it repents me that I made him King: this is spoken for our
capacity; otherwise God repents not: man changes, but he is the same still.

Men may repent, being lighter than vanity it self, moveable and variable,
weather-Cockes, reeds turned about with every mind. We may be of one mind to
day, of another to morrow. Amnons hot love is turned into deadly hatred: the
people that would make Christ a King, cry out against him, crucify him, we
have no King but Caesar. The Lycaonians that would have worshipped Paul, and
done sacrifice to him as a God, stoned Paul. Yea good men oftentimes are
changed and altered, they repent of the goodness that they have done. David
upon a flattering tale repented of the favor he showed to Mephibosheth, and
gave away his lands to Zibah. Often times an honest man of the Parish, a true
dealing man, a pitiful and merciful man, that for a world would not any way
offer the least wrong to any, by the ungodly persuasion of some politic
Achitophel and churlish Nabal becomes an hard dealing man: no constancy in men.
Yea Kings and Princes, many times change and withdraw their affections from
their favorites: but God never repents of his love. Romans 11.29.
Whom he once loves, he loves to the end, and the gifts and calling of God is
without repentance. God may take away riches, beauty, strength, wit, learning
from a man: but he never takes away faith, and his sanctifying spirit from the
faithful. As God here swear, and would not repent; so God has sworn to bring
us to the kingdom of heaven, and he will never repent of it: therefore let us
rest confident in Gods Word and oath, there is no repentance in God.

VERSE 22.
Upon the former premises follows the conclusion.

In as much as he was made with an oath, they without an oath; by so much, etc.

He does not say, he is made a better Priest: but that which serves more for
our consolation, he was made a surety of a better Testament.

Of a better covenant. Sureties are in covenants, not in Testaments.

(...), in manibus. At the making of covenants pledges were put in hand, and
sureties were provided which did undertake for the performance of the things
covenanted: even so in the covenant made between God and us, our Savior
CHRIST is the surety, that undertakes for both parts: on the behalf of God the
Father, he does undertake to satisfy his wrath; for us on our behalf, he
does undertake to reconcile us to God and to make him our friend.

A singular comfort to us. We have sinned; we are indebted to God many
thousands sins, and because we cannot satisfy for them, we must go to the
prison of Hell: then CHRIST steps forth saying, nay, I will be their surety, I
will pay the debt for them: therefore they shall not go to hell: unspeakeable
comfort! o loving surety! he pays the debt with no less price than his own
blood.

How are we beholden to this surety? All the Priests in the time of the law
could not do so much for the people: therefore Christ is better than they.

The new Testament is better than the old, not in regard of the substance, but
of diverse circumstances: the substance of both is one, which is Christ Jesus.

1. The Old Testament did but shadow out things to come: the new Testament
makes a gift and an exhibition of them, Col. 2.17. and as the body is better
than the shadow; so is the New Testament then the Old.

2. The Old Testament was dark and obscure; this is plain and perspicuous: that
did darkely speak of Christ; this plainly.

This has fewer, more lively and easy Sacraments.

That was temporal, and therefore not ratified with an oath: this is eternal
and lasts for ever. For the which cause it was confirmed with an oath: So was
not that.

5. The Mediator of surety of that was Moses; the surety of this is CHRIST:
therefore many degrees greater and better than that.

It is a weighty thing that makes GOD swear: as Hebr. 3.11.6, 17. here he
swears that CHRIST is a Priest for ever: therefore we are not to call into
question the eternity of his Priesthood.

The Pope and his skamblings would feign wind themselves into the society of
this Priesthood. Christ is a Priest for ever: ergo, the Pope and his Clergy
are Priests for ever.

I but this is proper to Christ: this Priest that is for ever, sits at the
right hand of God, Psalm. 110.1. So do not the Pope and his Clergy, therefore
it makes nothing for them.

We in the time of the Gospel have all things better than they had in the time
of the Law: we have a better Priest, a better sacrifice, a better Testament:
therefore in reason we should be better than they. A King deals better with
such a man then with many thousands of his subjects; therefore he should be
more dutiful to him. The King of Kings has dealt more bountifully with us,
then with them in the time of the Law: therefore we should be more religious,
more careful to serve him, then they were. Yet it is to be feared we are
worse than they. Drunkenness, abominable swearing, covetousness, loathing of
the sweet and heavenly Manna of the Word of God, hard-hearted dealing one with
another, all kind of vices flow with a more full stream among us, then among
them. Having all things better, we our selves should be better: yet we are
worse, and therefore have the more fearful account to make at the latter day.

VERSE 23.
THe fourth argument is taken from a diverse quality of both Priest-hoods. The
Priesthood which is everlasting and abides for ever, is more excellent than
that which is momentany, and continues but for a time. Christ's Priesthood is
eternal; the Leviticall Priesthood lasted but for a time: ergo.

This Argument has two branches: the comparison between them, 23.24, and an
effect, 25. the comparison is in the number, and continuance.

That the Priesthood of the Levites was temporary is evinced by the
relatives. If the Priests continued but a time, then the Priesthood: but they
continued but for a time: which is illustrated by the number of them, and the
reason of the number.

And they verily being many were made Priests.

And why were they many? because they were forbidden by death to endure.

Death would not suffer them to continue long; therefore it was necessary, that
there should be many of them, one to supply the room of the other.

There were not only many inferior Priests, but many high Priests: not at one
and the same time, but successively. After Aaron came Eleazar: after him
Phinees, etc. for the same cause there be many Kings, one King succeeds
another: because death will not suffer them to live, death forbids them to
abide.

He brings an inhibition against their continuance. I command thee here to
stay, and to go no further: and all Kings, Priests, Lawyers, Physicians must
obey him.

A paucity is a greater argument of perfection, then a multitude.

The kingdom is better governed that has one King, then that which has many:
that house is better ruled that has one Master, then many: the world is better
with one Sun, then if there were many: the Phaenix is the most famous of all
birds, because there is but one of them at a time. God being but one is far
more glorious then man being many. So is it between the Priests of the Law and
CHRIST: they were many; but CHRIST is but one, which remains always:
therefore his Priesthood is more excellent than theirs.

But why were they many? because they were not suffered to continue by reason
of death. As it is here said of the Levites: So it may be said of us all. A man
walking in London streets, or in a corporation is on the sudden arrested by a
Sergeant and commanded to stay: so as we are walking in our race in the world,
comes death as the LORDS Sergeant and bids us stay: here yield up thy life, I
will not suffer thee to tarry any longer. Adam was the ancientest man that ever
was, the first that breathed on the earth: yet he was not suffered to endure
by reason of death. Methusalem was the longest lived man that ever was, he
lived almost a thousand years, yet dyed. Sampson a mighty strong man, with the
jaw bone of an Ass he slew a thousand Philistims, he carried away the great
Gates of the City on his Shoulders: yet he was arrested by death. Saul a
goodly tall man, higher than any of the people; Absalom a fair beautiful man,
not a blemish in him from the Crown of his head to the soale of his foot.
Solomon the wisest man that ever was. Saint Paul a learned man, he spoke with
tongues more than they all, a profound divine, taken up into the third heaven,
a painful and powerful Preacher, he converted a great part of the world to
Christ: yet they were not suffered to continue by reason of death. This is the
condition of us all, high and low, rich and poor, learned and unlearned, none
of us all can be suffered to endure long by reason of death. Death is a
cooling Card in all our mirth and jollity, that comes at length with his Axe
and cuts all down. Kings are not suffered to endure by reason of death: there
is a succession of Kings as well as of other men, Dukes, Earls, Lords,
Knights, Gentlemen are not suffered -- rich Merchants, Lawyers, Divines,
Physicians are not suffered to continue by reason of death. The Physician that
has saved the life of many, in the end surrenders his life into Deaths hands:
none of us can endure here long by reason of death. The Priests of the Law
dyed, and the Ministers of the Gospel must dye: none but CHRIST endures for
ever: therefore seeing Death will not suffer us long to tarry here, let us so
live the little and uncertain time we have in this world, that we may live
eternally with Christ our everlasting Priest and Savior in the world to come.

VERSE 24.
HEre in the Priesthood of Christ there is but one Priest: and why? because
he is not mortal and taken away by Death, as they were; but immortal and
endures for ever.

Indeed in respect of his humanity he dyed: but he continued not long in that
death, not past three days and three nights. After he rose again, sits now
at the right hand of God, and lives for ever, whole Christ, both God and man,
Romans 6.9. whereas the Priests in the Law shall not live again for ever in
their bodies till the day of judgment. And our Savior Christ in respect of
his deity endures for ever continually: and therefore he has an everlasting
Priesthood, intransibile, which passes not by succession from one to another,
as the Leviticall Priesthood did, but continues for ever in the person of one
man. Chrysostom. expounds it, (...), he has not a succeeding Priesthood.

In the time of the Law there were many sacrificing Priests: but now in the
time of the Gospel, there is but one sacrificing Priest, and that is our
SAVIOR CHRIST, which offered one sacrifice once for the sins of the world.
This cut^eth off the whole rabble of the massemonging Priests. Indeed
spiritually we are all Priests, Apoc. 1.6. to offer spiritual sacrifices to
God: but there is no Priest to offer an external sacrifice for sin, but
Christ. The Jesuits chafe at us for this collection, yet it is firm.

VERSE 25.
THe eternity of Christ's Priesthood is illustrated by an effect that ensues
thereupon.

As he is willing, so he is able.

Also: which necessarily is inferred on the other.

To save all that belong to him. Thence he has his name Jesus, because he
saves, Matthew. 1.21. This is amplified.

1. By the manner how he saves us. 2. By the description of them, whom he
saves. 3. By the cause, why he is able to do it.
For the manner: wholly, omnino: leaving no part of our salvation to be
accomplished by others, Acts 4. Verse 12. he needs not the help of the Virgin
Mary, of Thomas, etc. he can save us wholly of himself.

They, that are saved, are such as come to God by him: not by the Virgin, by
any Saints or Angel in heaven.

The reason why: because he ever lives to make intercession for us: he
discharges the office of a Priest for us still in heaven.

Romans 8.26. it is said, that the Holy Ghost makes intercession for us: yet
the HOLY GHOST is not our Mediator: he does not in our nature pray for us as
Christ does, but he teaches us to pray: he does not in his own person make
intercession with sighs and groans: for the Holy Ghost cannot sigh and
groan, but he stirs up to it.

The Papists say that Christ is intercessor immediatus: but the Saints be
mediatores mediat^. But we must go to God by Christ alone: there is one
Mediator and no other. As there is but one God: So but one Mediator.

They might as well say, there is but one immediate God, and many mediate Gods:
as to say, there is one immediate intercessor, and many mediate. When thou
go to a King, says St. Ambrose, thou must make a friend with some about
him: but ad deum non opus est suffr^g^tore, sed mente devota. Christ is our
eye, by whom we see the Father: our mouth whereby we speak to the Father.
Non^ loves us so dearly as Christ, none is in greater favor with the Father
than the only Son that lies in his bosom: therefore let us go to God by him,
and him alone.

We must not imagine that Christ makes intercession for us now in heaven after
the same manner he did, when he was on the earth: either by bowing of the
knee, by falling down on his face by praying with sighs and groans, as he
did at the death of Lazarus; or with strong cries and tears, as he did in the
Garden; being glorified in heaven he does it not after such a carnal manner:
but Christ is said now to make intercession for us two kind of ways.

1. Non voce, sed miseratione: not by uttering any voice, by making prayers to
his father, as he did on the earth; but by having pity and compassion on us.
We have not a High Priest which cannot be touched with our infirmities, but a
merciful high Priest; that was tempted as we are, and can succor us in our
temptations.

2. He makes intercession for us, by presenting himself before the Father for
us, Hebr. 9.34. the exhibition of his glorious body in heaven: the force and
efficacy of his passion: the recordation of his obedience: these intercede with
the Father for us.

Whereupon it is well said of Gregory, l. 21. moral. cap. 13. Vnigenito filio
Deum pro homine interpellare est apud coaeternum Patrem seipsum hominem
demonstrare.

The consideration of Christ's perpetual intercession in heaven for us may be a
singular comfort to all Christians. We count him happy, that has a friend in
the Court: then how happy are we that have such a friend as Christ in the
Court of heaven? If the Kings Son make a request and that earnestly to the
King for us, shall we not be in great hope to speed? Christ Jesus the Son
of God makes request to God for us, and shall we not assure our selves, that
whatsoever we ask in his name according to his will, he hears us? In
sickness, poverty, disgrace, in the assaults and temptations of Satan, yea, in
death it self. Let us fly to this our Intercessour in heaven. Say on my
mother, said Solomon to Bathshebah, I will not say thee nay: so says God the
Father to Christ, say on my Son, make intercession for thy members: I will
not say thee nay. Blessed are we that have such an Intercessour: only let us
not grieve him with our sins, let us glorify him by an holy life, let us bring
forth fruits worthy of the faith we have in him: then we may boldly commence
our suits to him, and he will prefer them to his Father, to the everlasting joy
and comfort of us all.

VERSE 26.
HItherto the Priesthood of our Savior has been advanced above the
Leviticall Priesthood by four strong and infallible arguments.

Now there remains an high and magnificent description of the Priest himself.

Wherein, 1. The substance of the description, ver. 26, 27.

2. A reason for the confirmation of it. In the substance of the description,
1. The person of our High Priest. 2. His Ministry.

Became. Not as if we were worthy of him: as we say, the best Preacher in
England becomes the King. It is better translated, as Stephen does, conveniebat
nobis, was requisite and convenient for us: it behooved us to have such an
High Priest. Our redemption could not have been accomplished without such a one.

What manner of one?

1. Holy, in himself and in his own nature: not only in respect of his deity,
but of his humanity also, Luke 1.35. Act. 2.27. The Devils acknowledge this;
we know who thou art, that holy one of God. Dan. 9.24. Chodesh, Chodashim. Some
Priests, Prophets and others have been holy men, but none so holy as Christ:
not a spot or blemish of unholinesse in him: therefore fit to discharge the
office of an High Priest, and to reconcile us to his Father.

2. In respect of others: doing no harm, but all good to all: not
circumventing any by fraud or deceit, nor offering open wrong and injury to
any.

In regard whereof he is compared to a sheep, which of all creatures is most
harmless, nay profitable for his flesh and wool too: So was Christ: so far
from doing any harm, that he did good to his very enemies: a simple man, no
craft in him.

3. As he was harmless himself, so he took no harm from nothing: 1.
Actively. 2. Passively.

1. Undefiled of all things. The Priests in the time of the Law above others
were to be circumspect, that they were defiled with nothing, especially in the
time of the exequution of their office: all that while they might not keep
company with their Wives, they were to abstain from wine, not to touch a dead
body, or any unclean thing. Christ was more undefiled than any of them all:
they might keep their bodies from being outwardly defiled, yet they were
stained with sin in soul and body too; Christ had no defilement any kind of
way.

2. He was undefiled of any person.

He conversed with sinners for the reclaiming of them, as the Physician keeps
company with sick persons for the curing of them: but he neither gave
allowance to their sins, nor received any contagion from them.

Then his ministry is set forth to us. Where, 1. The place, where he does
Minister, in the Sanctuary of heaven.

Some expound it thus: that is, a most high and excellent man.

But it is rather to be referred to the place, where he ministers: he is
exalted above all those adspectable heavens, Ep. 4.10. he is made higher than
them, and exequutes the office of an High Priest for us in the highest heavens,
where he makes continual intercession for us.

Is our high Priest holy, and shall we be unholy, that belong to him? Is the
head holy, and shall the members be unholy? Is the husband pure, and shall the
wife be an impure strumpet? Nay we must labor in some acceptable measure to
express the holiness, that is in him: whereupon he says, be ye holy as I am
holy. Indeed we cannot be so holy as he is, and as certain Heretics
dreamed, that were called (...), pure and holy men: yet let us strive in some
sort to attain to that holiness which is in him. Thou can not be so rich as
such a man is: will thou therefore labor for no riches at all? A Scholar
cannot write so well as his sample, shall he not therefore endeavor to come as
near his sample as he can? So we cannot attain that holiness that is in
CHRIST, shall we therefore not imitate it? Yes, we must be an holy nation, a
royal Priesthood, a people zealous of good works. Learn of me, said
CHRIST, for I am humble and meek: So learn to be holy as he is holy. As the
oil powered on Aarons head stayed not there, but ran down to his beard, yea
to the very skirts of his clothing: So the heavenly oil of holiness powered on
Christ our High Priest must be conveyed to all, yea to the lowest, that be in
the Church.

Thou art none of Christ's if thou be not holy, as he is. But alas, for the
most part, we are unholy, yea even we that profess ourselves to be the members
of Christ. A great number, that would seem to belong to Christ, that have
Christ and his Gospel in their mouths, but are impure, unholy and profane in
their lives: beastly drunkards that stincke of drink wheresoever they become:
filthy adulterers, like fed horses, neighing after their neighbors wives:
covetous misers. mere mucke worms, that scarce believe there is any heaven
but in this world. We should be Saints in some measure, as Christ the Saint of
Saints is: but, a lamentable case! we are Devils in our conversations: we
should be Eagles mounting up into heaven, where Christ our High Priest and
Savior is; but we are Swine wallowing in the puddle of all iniquity. As Christ
is holy; Hebr. 12.14. Apoc. 21.2.
so let us endeavor to be in some poor measure, else we shall never set
foot into the kingdom of heaven. It is called the holy Jerusalem: no dogs,
enchanters, Whoremongers, unclean persons, that be not sanctified by the Holy
Ghost shall come into it: therefore let us be holy, as Christ our High Priest
is, that being partakers of his holiness, we may be partakers of his glory in
the life to come.

Christ was a simple man: all the treasures of wisdom were hid in him: he was
wiser than Solomon, then any politic Achitophel, then any Matchiavel
whatsoever: yet a simple man. He would not employ his wits and wisdom about
such things as might be hurtful to any. So Jacob was a plain man, and
Nathaneel a true Israelite, in whom there was no guile. Such must all
Christians be: though GOD have given them never so sharp a wit, so reaching a
head, never so great wisdom, experience and learning; yet they must not use
it to the hurt of any, but to the good of all, so near as they can. We must
be harmless as Christ: wise as Serpents; yet as innocent as Doves. Yet a
number there be that have the Serpentine wisdom, and want the Dove-like
simplicity: they think they cannot be wise men unless they be crafty and
hurtful men: they are more like the Devil then Christ: (...). The Devil has
a plaguie wit, a subtle pate of his own: but he never does any good with it,
but all the mischief he can: so do those that are the Devils brood; they
have wit and wisdom enough: the children of this world are wiser, etc. but
what good do they with it? Nay, what hurt? how dangerous be they in a town or
a Country? we must so live, that we be harmless as Christ was.

Yet a pitiful thing it is! we are altogether set upon hurt: we are harmefull
and not harmless persons, as CHRIST was. There be two kinds of harmefull men
in the Church, covered with the Cloak of Christianity: the one open, the other
close and secret; and yet not so close, but that God can disclose them, and
make their treacheries known to all the world: the one are Foxes, the other
are Wolves: the one Serpents, the other Bears and Lions. Some there be that
blush not to offer open harm and violence to their neighbors. Such a one as
Iesabel was, that slew Naboth, and took away his Vineyard: all the world might
see the injury.

Such are they that grind the faces of the poor, that wring house and land
from them, and as Zidkiah, smite their brother on the face, that all may see
the blow: these be impudent wretches; yet few of these Owls dare appear in
the glorious Sun shine of the Gospel. Now, men are waxen not more religious,
but more cunning: they will be no hurtful persons, they do no harm to any:
not openly perhaps, yet secretly: not above hand, but under hand. As he said, I
will kill Ismael, Ier. 40.15.
and no man shall see it. We will undermine the Preacher, supplant our
neighbors, do hurt and mischief in a town, and no man shall see it. These
are worse than the other: those dogs are worst that will bite before they
bark: and the Serpent that lies in the green grass destroys more than
those that be in high ways: a man may epsy the one sooner than the other.
These are like Judas, that would kiss Christ at the same instant when he
betrayed him: these will speak fair to a man's face, and yet by secret
persuasions, by politic devices, by alienating the affections of others, cut
his throat behind his back. A vile generation of Vipers! yet all their
plotting, consulting; their devising of mischief is known to him that knows
all secrets, who will one day reveal them to their open shame before God and
his Angels, unless they repent, fie upon this dealing: let us labor to be
harmless as our Savior Christ is. It is an easy matter to be harmefull, if
we will sell our selves to the Devil. Let us strive to do good to all, but
harm none, neither openly, nor secretly, by word nor deed, by our selves not
by others. We that be Christians must be good men, as Barnabas was; full of
good works, as Dorcus was: but not bad men, hurtful men, full of evil
works. Let us all so carry our selves in the Town and Country, where we
dwell, that it may be affirmed of us, we are harmless, as Christ was. Yet as
we read of one that was famous for nothing, but for burning Diana's Temple: so
some are famous for nothing but for the hurt they have done and do daily: they
do not only no good themselves, but dissuade others from doing of good.

As Christ is undefiled; so must we be. These are they that have not defiled
their garments, Apo. 3.4, 14.4
that have not defiled themselves with women. Though we live in a filthy and
defiled world: yet we must not be defiled with it. Like the Sun that shines
on a dunghill, yet is not polluted with the dunghill: so though we live in the
dunghill of the world, yet we must not be defiled with it: we must be
undefiled from covetousness, drunkenness, pride, malice, envy, and other sins
that reign amongst us. But alas, we have no care of it: we defile our selves
innumerable kind of ways. A dainty Lady, or Gentlewoman would be loath to
file her fingers with a little dirt: we all loath outward defilements, but we
give entertainment to sin, which is the greatest pollution of all.

Nay we are like hogs, that had rather be in foul water, then in clean,
wallowing in the puddle of sin, then bathing our selves in the bath of virtue.

As Christ separated Himself from sinners: So must we do: how? we must not
shut up our selves in Cloisters, in Nunneries, and Monasteries, as some did in
a blind zeal in the time of Popery, thinking that they were then separated
from sinners, when they were many of the most beastly sinners themselves.

Neither must we be brethren of separation, as the Brownists most unbrotherly
name themselves; we must not, Hebr. 10.25. forsake the assembling of our selves
together. We must not separate our selves from the spouse of Christ, because
of some pretended wrinkles in her face: neither must we altogether abandon the
society of men, 1 Cor. 5.10. but we must separate our selves from the pollution
of sinners. Though we be in Sodom, as Lot was, yet we must not be Sodomites:
though we come into the company of drunkards, yet we must not be drunken as
they are: though among adulterers, bawdy talkers and livers, yet we must not
draw with them in the same yoke of sin: we must be like to the fishes that
dwell in the salt water, and yet themselves are fresh: so though our dwelling
be in a profane town; yet we must separate our selves from the profaneness
that is in the Town.

This is hard for us to do, though Christ could do it. It is a difficult
matter to touch pitch, and not to be defiled with it: to be in a fire, and not
to be burnt. Barnabas keeping company with dissemblers, was brought to
dissemble with them: Gal. 2.13.
and St. Peter that stout champion of Christ, being in the high Priests hall
was brought to the denial of Christ. Therefore the best course we can take is
to refrain their company, as Joseph: if not, but that we fall into it, then
to pray to God to separate us from the wickedness that is in that company.

The High Priest in time of the Law was in a Sanctuary on the earth: but our
High Priest is in the Temple and Sanctuary of heaven, where he appears
always in the sight of God for us: and let not our affections be here on the
earth, but let our conversation be in heaven; let us seek the things that be
above, where Christ our High Priest and Savior is.

VERSE 27.
THe second thing in his Ministry is his sacrifice, which surpasses the
sacrifices of the Priests in the time of the Law: in regard of the time when,
of the persons for whom, and the kind of sacrifice offered by him.

1. For the time: he had no necessity to offer daily, as they did, Number. 28.3, 4.

It was necessary for them to offer daily.

1. Because both they and the people sinned daily.

2. Because their sacrifices were imperfect, and were daily to be iterated.
There was no such necessity for Christ to offer daily: because he had no sin,
and by one sacrifice perfected us for ever.

2. They did offer for their own sins and the peoples too; and that every
day: and so did not Christ. He had no sin of his own to offer for: and as
for the sins of the people, he took them all away by one sacrifice.

First: for he must be holy himself before he could make the people holy.
Aaron sinned grievously in the calfe.

3. For the kind of sacrifice: they offered things without themselves, as
Sheep, Goats, Oxen, etc. Christ offered himself: he was Sacerdos and
victima, Hebr. 9.14.

We are all sinners, Ministers and people: we must all say, yea even arietes
gregis, the Lords prayer: forgive us our trespasses. Therefore let us not swell
in pride one against another: but fly all to the mercy of God in Christ.

Therefore let the best Preacher in the world knock on his breast with the
poor Publican and say; Oh God be merciful to me a sinner.

The order is here worthy to be observed: he offered first for his own sins. A
Minister in killing of sin must begin with himself. Si vis alios flere,
flendum tibi prius: first weep bitterly for thine own sins, as Saint Peter
did, and then make the people to weep for their sins. I beat down mine own
body, says Saint Paul, least while I preach to others, my self should be a
reprobate. The like method must be practiced by all Christians.

First cast the beam out of thine own eye: let us first repress sin in our
selves. Then in others. As the Priest in the time of the Law first offered for
his own sins: so let us all being Priests by Jesus Christ, first offer up our
selves to God. We count him a fool that will have more care of his neighbors
Sheep, then of his own: and shall we have more care of our neighbors soul,
then of our own? Let us first begin with our selves.

There is but one sacrifice of the New Testament, whereby the daily sacrifice
of the mass is quite overthrown. This is a knife to cut the throat of the
mass among the Papists: the Priests offer up Christ daily, they do more than
needs: there is no necessity of that: for Christ offered up Himself once for
all. There be many pregnant places for it in this epistle, as Hebr. 10.11, 12.

I, say the Papists, there is but one bloody sacrifice, which was once offered
on the Cross, 1 Pet. 3.18. yet there is an unbloudy sacrifice which Christ
instituted at his last Supper, where the body and blood of Christ are offered
under the similitudes of bread and wine: which is a commemoration and an
application of his sacrifice on the cross to us: for Christ said to his
Disciples hoc facite, that is Sacrificate, as the Poet says: cum faciam vitula
pro frugibus ipse venito: and the Hebrew word ( Gnasah) does often signify
sacrificare. After the words of consecration be said; this is my body, that is
given for you, i. that is offered to God the Father for you: this is the blood
of the New Testament, that is shed for many: it was then shed and powered out
for a sacrifice to God.

I, but where do they read in any Author, that hoc facite with an accusative
case does signify to sacrifice? The Poet does not say, facere vitulam.

2. The Evangelists wrote in Greek, not in Hebrew or Latin.

He then ordained no propitiatory (that is my meaning) sacrifice, which was to
be offered every day; he instituted a Sacrament, not such a sacrifice.

1. In every sacrifice there is sensible quiddam, as Bellar. confesses, and
they also say, it is an external thing, and they call it visible sacrificium.

In this imaginary sacrifice there is no sensible outward thing, that may be
discerned by the senses. They say, that the body and blood of Christ are there
invisible under the shape of bread and wine: therefore by their own position
it is no sacrifice.

2. They confess it to be an unbloudy sacrifice: and then not propitiatory,
for the quick and the dead, as they will have it: for Hebr. 9.22. Without
shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. There is no blood shed:
therefore no remission of sins: and then a mass not worth a fig: thou can
not have the remission of sins by it: but it is a fantastical dream of their
own. Let us magnify the Lord Jesus for his own sacrifice which he offered
for us, and lay hold on it by a true and a lively faith.

What did Christ offer for us? not silver and gold, not a Bull, a Sheep, or a
Goat: not the hair of his head, the paring of his nails, or his little toe,
not one of his Disciples, but himself. Oh blessed SAVIOR that spared not
himself for our sakes! So let us give our selves to him: he, that will be my
Disciple, let him deny himself and follow me. We must not only sacrifice our
sins for Christ his sake, which we will hardly do: but, if occasion require,
offer up our selves for him: we must say with Paul, my life is not dear to me,
etc. I am ready not only to be bound, but to dye at Jerusalem for the name of
the Lord Jesus.

But alas we are wanting in love and thankfulness to Christ: he offered
himself for us. We will not offer up our pleasures for him. He laid down his
own life for us: we will not lay down our sins for him. We will not forgo
our lusts, our covetousness, pride, drunkenness for Christ's sake: how then
shall we offer up our selves for him, as he did for us?

VERSE 28.
THe reason is taken from the excellency of this our High Priest: he, that is
the Son of God, void of all infirmity, sanctified for ever, is able by one
sacrifice to satisfy for the sins of the Church: but Christ is the Son of
God, void of all infirmity, sanctified for ever. ergo.

This is illustrated by a famous antithesis, between the Priests of the Law
and him: whereof there be four branches.

1. The ceremonial Law made men Priests: the Gospel made God a Priest.

For this our High Priest, as he was the Son of man, so the Son of God
too: and therefore God.

2. The Law made servants Priests, as Heb. 3.5. The Gospel the Son: which is
more honorable than any servant.

3. The Law made them that had infirmities, namely of sin and corruption:
otherwise CHRIST took on him all our natural infirmities.

4. The Law made those that were mortal, and endured not long by reason of
death: the Gospel has made him that is consecrated for evermore.

By the word of the oath may be meant the Gospel, as Luke 1.73. because it was
ratified by Gods oath. But rather by it is meant the promise made to Christ,
which God confirmed in the Psalm with an oath.

If we respect the substance of the oath, it was from all eternity. CHRIST was
ordained an everlasting Priest in the eternal decree of his Father.

1 Pet. 1.20. but it is said to be after the Law, because it was written,
published and exhibited after the giving of the Law.

The word of this oath coming after the Law did put the Law out of place,
though, Gal. 3.17. because the promise was of greater force and efficacy then
the Law: but as the last Will disannulls all the former wills; so the word of
the oath coming after the Law, did abrogate the Law, Which is sanctified for
evermore, or perfected: and therefore is able perfectly to fulfill the office
of an High Priest.

There was no Priest, no Prophet in the time of the Law: there is no Minister,
no Preacher, no Christian whatsoever, but has some infirmity or other. Noah a
Preacher of righteousness was overtaken with wine, and lay uncovered in his
Tent. Abraham a Prophet, so the Lord himself terms him to Abimelech, had his
infirmities, when he dissembled, for the saving of his life. David a man after
Gods own heart had his gross faults, when he was carried into Adultery and
murder, using one as a Cloak to cover the other withal. Saint Peter had his
infirmity, when he did Iudaizare cum Iudaeis -- applied himself to all
companies. Saint Paul and St. Barnabas had their infirmities, when they were at
an open jarre, and public defiance one with another about St. Mark, and
departed in a chafe one from another. Show me the garden that has not one
weed in it: and show me the man, either Preacher or other, that has not some
infirmity. Let not us cast off men because of infirmities: much less let us
be ready, as some are, to hurl away the word, because of the infirmities, that
be in the Preachers of the word. If we will have a man without infirmities, we
must go to heaven for one: for there be the Spirits of just and perfect men.
Hebr. 12.23.
There is none perfect in this world: we are all full of infirmities* the Lord
be merciful to us: only Christ Jesus our High Priest is void of infirmities,
he is consecrated for evermore, and holds to consecrate all that belong to
him. Let us serve this our High Priest in holiness and righteousness in this
life, that we may triumph with him, and offer the sacrifice of praise to God
with him, his Saints and Angels in the life to come.

CHAP. 8.
IN the Priesthood of Christ there be two things. 1. His calling to that
office: cap. 7. and 8. 2. The exequution of it. cap. 9. and 10.

In his calling. 1. The Party called, which is set forth at large in the former
Chapter. 2. The thing whereunto he is called, in this Chapter, which is, to
Minister for the good and salvation of his Church.

This Ministration of his is advanced above the Leviticall ministration by
four arguments.

1. From his empire, rule and authority: by reason whereof he Ministers after
a more magnificent manner, then the Levites did, Verse 1.

2. From the place where he Ministers.

3. From the Sacrifice wherewith he Ministers, ver. 3.4, 5.

4. From the subject whereabout he is occupied.

In the first argument, 1. An entrance into it. 2. A description of his power
and authority.

Having cast up the account, this is the sum, that arises of it: (...), or,
upon the things spoken this is the chief of all: it is (...), not (...).

This is to stir us up to attention. The sums of things are welcome to us.
Who is not desirous to have the sum of the Bible? The sum of the Law
contained in so many volumes? a sum of Physic? etc. The Orators in the end
of their Orations deliver the sum of that which they have spoken: so does St.
Paul here, he delivers to us the total sum of the things which he had
spoken before: and it is good for Preachers to draw their matter into a sum.

We have such a worthy High Priest as all the Highpriests in the Law were not
worthy to be named with him the same day.

Then he comes to show his magnificence.

He does not say, stands: as a Lord, Earl, Duke may stand by a King
bare-headed, but sits. Indeed Act. 7.5 6. he is said to be standing on the
right hand of God: but then he is seen standing as ready to pull Stephen out
of the jaws of his enemies.

He does not sit at his footstool, but at his hand: not at his left hand, but
on the right hand. God the Father as Prince and Potentate sits on his
throne: and Christ sits by him.

Of that Majesty which excels the Majesty of all the Kings in the world:
either Majesty is put for Majesticall Prince, to whom is due Majesty, Jude 25.
or, it may be an Hebraisme, the throne of the Majesty, for a majesticall throne.

Not in earth, but in heaven. In the heavens where there be many mansions: and
in them he prepares a place for us. The Highpriests in the time of the Law
sat in Moses chair here upon the earth: but our High Priest sits in Gods
chair in heaven, and thinks it no robbery to be equal with God. In this
respect he is not only higher than all the Priests in the Law, but higher than
the Angels.

Here he sits as a ruler, for the welfare of his Church.

From hence it cannot be gathered that Christ's body is every where, because
Gods right hand is every where: for this his sitting is restrained to a place,
namely to heaven. Stephen saw him in heaven, Acts 7.55. Love is an excellent
virtue, because it is an (...) of the whole Law. The Lords prayer carries away
the bell from all prayers, because that is the sum of all the prayers, that
can be made by all men in the world. Here we have the sum of this large and
famous epistle. Therefore let it be reverently regarded, and diligently marked
by us all.

This may be a singular comfort to us, that we have such a mighty
High Priest, as has all power in heaven and earth. The Highpriests here on
the earth were controlled by Kings and Princes. Solomon deposed Abiathar, and
Saul put Abimelech to death: but this our High Priest is above all the Kings
and Princes in the world: they must all cast down their Scepters at his feet:
he can take the breath out of their nostrils, when he pleases. In what an
happy ease are we, that have such a LORD protector of the Church? He may
suffer us to be tried as gold in the furnace of affliction: but he will not
suffer us to perish, at the length he will deliver us out of the hands of all
our enemies: only let us have a care, so near as we can, not to displease this
our High Priest. As the people were obedient to the High Priest in the time of
the Law: So let us be to our High Priest in the time of the Gospel: kiss the
Son, least he be angry, and ye perish from the way. All Papists kiss the
Popes feet, yea Kings, Princes and Emperors. But let us all from the highest
to the lowest, in meekness and humility, kiss this our High Priest that
sits at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, and he
will defend us from all enemies whatsoever.

VERSE 2.
THe second argument. Those Highpriests were Ministers of an earthly
Sanctuary: this of an heavenly: Ergo, more glorious than they.

Of the Sanctuary. The Greek is Ambiguous; of the masculine or neuter gender.
Some interpret it, Minister of the Saints. So indeed he is: not the Angels
alone, but Christ Himself is our Minister. O unspeakable honor!

Rather, as the word is taken in this Epistle, of the Holies, that is of the
Sanctuary, the Holy of Holies, Hebr. 9.12. and 24.

The place, where he Ministers, is Heaven: there he appears in the sight of
God for us.

(...) of (...), publicus, and (...): qui facit opus publicum. So are the
Angels, Hebr. 1.14. the Magistrate, Romans 13.4.

The third argument: he that has the more worthy Sacrifice, is the more
worthy Priest. Christ's sacrifice is more worthy. Ergo.

This sacrifice is set forth to us. 1. Figuratively. 2. Properly.

Figuratively it is resembled to a Tabernacle.

Some by Tabernacle understand heaven too, as well as the Sanctuary: but rather
by it is meant, the body of our Savior Christ.

1. It is not like, that in so few words he would use a tautology. 2. The
Tabernacle was for the Priests, not for the Highpriests. 3. The reason
following, Verse 3. does evince, that by the Tabernacle is signified the body
of Christ, wherewith he did sacrifice.
It is an usual thing to resemble the body to a Tabernacle, 2 Cor. 5.1, 2. 2
Pet. 1.13, 14. As a man dwells in an house or Tabernacle: So does the soul
in the body. And as God dwelt in the Tabernacle among the Jews: so does the
deity dwell in the humanity of Christ: therefore it has the name of a
Tabernacle.

This similitude is fitly introduced by the Apostle. As the High Priest by the
Tabernacle went into the Sanctum Sanctorum: so Christ by his body offered on
the Cross went into heaven: Hebr. 9.11. Hence it is that Christ's body is
compared to a Temple, Ioh. 2.21. to a veil, Heb. 10.20.

This Tabernacle is illustrated by an adjunct, and the efficient cause.

The other was but a counterfeit to this True is not opposed to false: that was
not a forged Tabernacle: it was of Gods institution, and made by his direction.
But it is called the true Tabernacle, as Christ may be called the true David,
Solomon, Melchizedec, the true Manna that came from heaven, John 6.32. And as
the picture of a man is nothing to the man himself: So that Tabernacle was but
a picture of this: this is the true Tabernacle indeed. The shadow of the Sun in
the water is not the Sun: that is the true Sun that is in the firmament: so
that was but a shadow of this Tabernacle; this is the true Tabernacle.

2. It is illustrated by the efficient cause. Moses, Aholiab, Bezaleel and
other artificers pight that Tabernacle, which were mortal men, though they did
it by Gods appointment: this Tabernacle was framed immediately by God Himself:
the body of our Savior Christ, was conceived by the Holy Ghost.

Romans 15.8.
The name of a Minister is no base name; seeing Christ being now in heaven does
not think scorn of it. He was a Minister of the circumcision, when he lived
on the earth: and he is a Minister of the Sanctuary now in heaven. Therefore
let none have a base opinion of the name and office of the Ministers. Christ is
the head Minister, and we inferior Ministers under him: therefore let us be
reverently regarded for his sake.

There by presenting of his own sacred body before the Father, and by the
efficacy of his passion he still makes intercession for us; this is the
Ministry which he performs in this heavenly Sanctuary.

The High Priest in the time of the Law went into the Sanctum Sanctorum
himself alone, he could carry none of the people with him: but our
High Priest, which is a Minister of the celestial Sanctuary, shall one day
take us up into that Sanctuary to himself: he is gone thither to prepare a
place for us: at the latter day we shall meet him in the air, and be
translated into this Sanctuary with him, and remain with him for ever. Let
this be as honey to sweeten sickness, poverty, contempt, and all the crosses
of this life: they all shall have an end: and we shall reign with this our
High Priest in the Sanctuary of heaven for ever.

As Christ's body was a Tabernacle, so is ours: for he was like to us in all
things, sin only excepted. Here is the difference: his body was a pure and
undefiled tabernacle, not a spot or blemish of sin in it; ours are impure and
unclean Tabernacles, infected with the Leprosy and contagion of sin.

2. His body was a Tabernacle framed immediately by God, the Holy Ghost, the
third person in the Trinity: we have our Tabernacles mediately from God, by the
means and seed of our Parents.

3. His body is resembled to the holy Tabernacle, wherein God was served in the
time of the Law; ours may be compared to those Tabernacles, wherein the
Patriarcks dwelt, before they were seated in the land of Canaan.

Yet they may have the name of Tabernacles, and so they are called in the
Scripture.

Now Tabernacles were different things from houses: they were of more slight
and slender stuff, soon set up, and soon pulled down: So our bodies are not
houses, fair and magnificent buildings, strong towers and stately palaces:
they be but brittle Tabernacles, nay houses of clay, whose foundation is in the
dust: therefore there is no cause why we should be proud of them. The body of
strong Samson, that carried the Gates of the Cities on his shoulders, was but
a Tabernacle, that was quickly crushed in pieces: the body of Saul, that was
higher then any of the people, was but a Tabernacle: the body of fat Eglon and
of great Goliath, were but frail Tabernacles: the body of Absalom that had not
a blemish from the crown of the head to the soale of the foot, was but a
weak Tabernacle: the body of the fairest Lady and the most comely Gentlewoman
on the face of the earth, is but a Tabernacle; up to day, and down to morrow.
Therefore let us glorify God with these our Tabernacles in this world, that
we may receive them glorious and everlasting in the world to come.

VERSE 3.
THat which he spoke obscurely, he now explaineth, showing by an argument a
pari, that it was requisite he should have a sacrifice to offer up.

A Priest and a sacrifice are relatives.

As they had their sacrifices: So it is necessary our High Priest should have
his sacrifice, which was the Tabernacle of his body.

The Rhemists collect from hence that Christ, being now in heaven, must needs
have an external sacrifice still, and that must be the mass: yet the Holy
Ghost does only reason, that it was needful CHRIST should have a sacrifice,
which he offered once on the Cross, and not a sacrifice to offer daily:
therefore he uses a verb of the time past, in the first Aorist with the
Grecians, (...), not (...).

This somewhat is his own self, Hebr. 7.27. in his own body on the tree, 1
Pet. 2.24. he laid down his life for us: and so let us do for him, if we be
called thereunto.

All Priests, high and low, have their sacrifices: we that be Christians, are
Priests, Apoc. 1.6. therefore we must have our sacrifices.

Phil. 4.18. Hebr. 13.16. we must offer up the calves of our lips, the
sacrifice of thankesgiving for all his rich and plenteous mercies; offer up the
incense of prayer, that may ascend into heaven. We offer the sacrifice of
alms and Christian liberality in feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, in
showing our kindness to CHRIST his Ambassadors, and we must offer up our
bodies as a lively sacrifice to God. If we have no sacrifice, we are no
Priests: yet a number of Christians there be that profess themselves to be
spiritual Priests, and yet have no spiritual sacrifice to show. These are as
Stars without light, clouds without water, and trees without fruit. Every
Priest is ordained to offer sacrifices: if we be Priests, let us show our
sacrifices.

Now that it is requisite he should offer the sacrifice of his own body, he
shows by an evident absurdity that must needs ensue, if it were otherwise:
and that is a nullitie of CHRIST 's Priesthood. Therefore we must needs
affirm, that either he is no Priest at all, which is to make God a liar, who
has said, thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedec: or that
he is a different Priest from them, and has another manner of sacrifice then
they had.

Then he returns to the other clause in the second Verse, that CHRIST is a
Priest in heaven, a Minister of the heavenly Sanctuary. Either he is a Priest
in heaven, or in earth: not in earth: which he proves ab absurdo; if he be
Priest on earth, then he is no Priest: but ye cannot deny him to be a Priest:
for the Scripture says, thou art a Priest after the order of Melchizedec.

The consequent of the proposition is proved by an argument from the contraries.

If he were a Priest on earth, then he should be a superfluous Priest: for
there be Priests enough on the earth, able to offer external sacrifices.

There being Priests, which according to the constitution of the Law offer
gifts: the Law had sufficient Priests already on the earth to offer Bulls,
Calves, Sheep, Goats; therefore if Christ were a Priest on the earth, he were
no Priest different from the Leviticall Priests, or more excellent than they,
for they were able to offer up all external sacrifices.

The earthly Priests and he cannot stand together: so long as they are in
force, CHRIST cannot exequute his office. Therefore he is a Priest in heaven,
not in earth.

Till they have done, Christ cannot begin: till his sacrifice was offered on
the cross, they were in request: but after that, their date was out, and our
High Priest is a Minister of the Sanctuary in heaven.

VERSE 5.
Upon that occasion he descends to the description of their office: this he
does illustrate by the scope, and end of the Priesthood in the time of the Law.

1. For the manner of their service.

2. Then of the matter or thing which they served.

They were to shadow out our Savior Christ: ergo, these shadows must vanish
when the body is come: and Christ could not perform the office of a Priest,
till those Priests had played their parts, and were off the stage: therefore he
must needs be a Priest in heaven, not in the earth.

(...) perform divine Service, or which serve with great reverence: of (...),
a particle that increases the signification in composition, and (...) tremo:
much more should we serve in the Gospel, 1 Cor. 2.3.

To the pattern or sampler: or (...) being understood, which serve in the
pattern. (...) is subostensio, obscura repraesentatio. (...), Col. 2.17. which
was but a type or shadow of heavenly things. All that was in the ceremonial
Law, were types of our Savior Christ, and of the kingdom of heaven. The
Sanctuary a shadow of heaven, the Tabernacle of Christ's body, the Highpriests
of Christ: their sacrifices types of his, the brazen Serpent a figure of him:
they had the shadow, and we the substance.

This he proves by the testimony of God Himself.

Divinitus admonitus. Moses did not make it of his own head, but by Gods
appointment and direction.

When he was about the making and finishing of the Tabernacle: for it was
begun, that it might be finished. Syriac. dum conderet tabernaculum.

Supply (...) is not in the Hebrew Text: yet it may be derived out of Exodus
25.9.

The Lord in a vision showed heaven, our Savior Christ, and all things
appertaining to him, to Moses. Now according to that pattern were the
Tabernacle and Temple to be framed, that might praefigurate and shadow out
those heavenly things to the Jews.

In earthly buildings, the pattern of the house is not so glorious as the
house: the pattern is drawn in paper in dark lineaments, but this pattern
far exceeded the whole beauty of the ceremonial Law: it might draw a little
near to it, but it could not express it to the full.

The Ministers of the New Testament are more glorious, than the Priests of the
Old Testament. In this we agree: we are both servants, the servants of God
and of the Church; but here is the difference; they served the pattern, we the
thing patterned: they served the shadow; we the truth and substance shadowed
by them: they shadowed CHRIST to come to the people; we preach Christ already
come. John Baptist was greater than all the Prophets; but we (in a one sense)
are greater than John Baptist: the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater
than he. In this respect our Ministry should be more highly esteemed of: the
which notwithstanding is little regarded by many. The Devil in the maid spoke
honorably of Paul and Silas: some of us will speak contemptibly of Christ's
Ambassadors. They were the moon light; we are the Sunnelight: we serve to
show you the way to heaven plainly and perspicuously: therefore honor our
service and Ministry.

Where had they this pattern? from Moses, and he from GOD.

Moses might not swerue from his pattern. All things must be squared
according to that pattern which God has left to us in his word.

The Magistrate must rule the commonwealth according to the pattern that God
has set down in his word. The Governors of the Church must order it
according to the pattern, that God has appointed: the disposers of the
Mysteries of God must preach according to the pattern of Christ and his
Apostles: not in the entising words of man's wisdom, but in the plain
evidence of the spirit and with power. The father must so govern his Children,
the Master his servants, the Husband his Wife, according to the pattern
prescribed by God. This pattern of the most wise God must be observed by us
all. If we follow the devices of our own brain, and leave this pattern of
God Almighty, we justly incur his wrath and displeasure. Vriah the Priest
must make the Altar in all points like the fashion that King Ahaz sent from
Damascus, 2 Reg. 16.11. A Carpenter and Mason must make the house according to
the pattern received from him that is the Author of the house: he must frame
the house to the will of him, that sets him on work, and not after his own
will. A Sempster must sow according to the Sampler: A Scholar must write
according to his Copy. We are angry with a Barber, if he do not trim us as
we would have him: and displeased with a Tailor, if he make not the Coat, as
we wished him: and must not the high and eternal God be justly incensed
against us, if we follow our own pattern and forsake his? therefore let that
pattern so near as we can, be carefully observed by us all.

Neither must we follow it in one or two things alone, but in all. See that
thou make all things according, etc. In some things peradventure, which like us
well, we can be contented to be directed by Gods pattern, but in all things
we will not. In some things we will be carried by our own will and
affection. Herod did many things that John Baptist bade him, he followed the
pattern in some things: but he would not do all. Let John preach his heart
out, he will keep his sweet sin of incest still. Saul followed Gods pattern
awhile in his government, but at length he departed from it. As Zachary and
Elizabeth walked in all Gods Commandments: so we must observe Gods pattern
in all things: he that keeps the whole Law, and offends in one point, is
guilty of all: and if ye break Gods pattern but in one thing, especially,
wittingly and willingly, he will require it at your hands. A Scholar must not
write two or three letters according to his coppie, but all: if he make one
awry, his Master will be offended with him. Therefore in all things, so far,
as it is possible, let us follow the pattern, that God has set before our
eyes, that yielding not a lame and halting, but a full and complete obedience
to him, we may have a full weight of eternal glory in the life to come.

But what and if we have not all things according to this pattern, shall we
in a pelting chafe hurl all away? God forbid. If thy garment be not made in
all points according to thy mind, will thou cast it away, and not rather have
that amended, which is defective? If thine house, be not in all respects built
as thou desire, will thou pull all down? Though there should be some men in
the Church and commonwealth, that draw not so near the celestial pattern,
as were to be wished: yet let us not in a rage fling out of hose Churches and
commonwealths. Such is the infirmity of man, and the malice and subtilty of
the Devil, that no Church in the world can be found, wherein there are not
some imperfections coming short of the pattern delivered to us: yet let us
not separate our selves, but hold the unity of faith in the bond of love.

VERSE 6.
THe fourth argument to prove the advancement of Christ's ministration above
the Leviticall is taken from the subject whereabout He Ministers: he has
obtained a more excellent ministry.

He that is a Mediator of a better covenant, is a more excellent Priest: Our
Savior Christ is a Mediator of a more excellent covenant: ergo, he is a more
excellent Priest.

In all covenants there be some, that interpose themselves between the
parties for the ratifying of the covenant. The only Mediator between God and
us in this New Covenant, is our Savior and High Priest, CHRIST JESUS: he
undertakes for the Fathers part to make satisfaction to him for our sins,
though we be not able to do it: and for our comfort and security, to
reconcile the Father to us.

Aaron and the rest of the Priests were mediators in the time of the Law
between God and the people: and the Law it self was given by the hand of
Moses, as of a Mediator.

But the only Mediator of this New Testament, or covenant is Christ Jesus.
Neither the Virgin Mary, nor any of the Apostles and Saints join with him in
it: he discharges this office alone.

Now that he is a Mediator of a better Testament, he proves by the material
cause of a testament or covenant. That testament, which has the better
promises, is the better testament: for a testament or covenant consists of
promises. But this testament whereof CHRIST is the mediator, has better
promises: ergo.

Which was established. He speaks more emphatically: by order of Law: on
better promises, which are the pillars for it to lean upon.

What, has the New Testament better promises than the Old? was not Christ
promised to them in the time of the Law, as well as to us in the time of the
Gospel? did not God say to Adam, the seed of the woman shall break the
Serpents head? to Abraham, In thy seed shall all nations be blessed? how then
are our promises better than theirs, when as Christ and the kingdom of heaven
were promised to them as well as to us?

In the promises there are these two things: the matter and the manner: as for
matter and substance, the promises were all one in the Old and New Testament,
that is CHRIST, and eternal salvation by him. But ours in respect of the
manner are better and excel theirs.

1. Their promises were included within the narrow compass of Judea, our
promises are blazed all the world over.

2. Their promises were published by men, by the Patriarcks, Prophets, which
were but servants: ours by Christ the Son of God.

3. They according to Gods promise had the graces of the spirit as we have: yet
not in such abundant measure, as they be now powered out in the time of the
Gospel.

4. Their promises were dark and obscure, covered under the veil of many
ceremonies, and shadowed out by temporal things: our promises are more clear
and evident.

5. Theirs were at the delivery of the Law with a condition: do this and live.
Cursed be he that continues not in all things, etc. Ours, believe and live.

6. The Sacraments, whereby the promises were confirmed unto them, were more
hard and difficult: the cutting off the foreskin, the preparing of a Lamb for
every house: ours are more easy and familiar: the sprinkling of a little
water, or the dipping in the water, the procuring of bread and wine.

7* Their promises were of things to come: there should come a Lamb that should
take away the sins of the world: ours are of things already come and exhibited.
This Lamb is come, and has offered up himself on the Altar of the Cross for
us.

Therefore the promises being better, the covenant is better: and we are to
praise God for this Mediator of a better covenant.

Has God in mercy vouchsafed us greater promises, and does he not look, think
ye, for greater obedience at our hands? To whom much is given, much is
required. A father is more kind to one Son, than to another, and has made a
more ample promise to him: ought not that Son to be more dutiful to his
Father? Our heavenly father has been more benign and loving to us, then to
them in the time of the Law: therefore our gratitude and obedience should
exceed theirs: we should excel them in all virtues, and be more careful to
keep Gods Commandments, then they: yet we are behind them in virtue, and all
vices flow with a fuller stream among us. For all the excellent promises that
we have, where shall we find a man so strong in faith as Abraham was? So
meek and courteous as Moses was? So chaste as Joseph was? So zealous as Phinees
was? So sincere, and heavenly minded man as David was? So patient and merciful
as Job, whom the very loins of the poor blessed? When did abominable
swearing, contempt of the word, pride, malice, covetousness abound more than
at this day? we have more gracious promises then they to allure us to
goodness, yet we are worse than they. A fearful thing! Our condemnation
will be the greater, if we do not repent. Let us set these promises before our
eyes, that they may be as whet-stones to sharpen us to all good duties. God
has promised better things to us: therefore we will be better in our lives and
conversations then they*

VERSE 7.
THis better and more worthy Testament is illustrated two kind of ways.

1. By the necessity of it. 2. By the introduction of it. The necessity was a
fault or imperfection in the old.

That there was a fault and imperfection in it, he proves by the bringing in
of another. If there had been no want in the Old Testament, another had not
been brought in: but another was brought in: ergo, there was a want in the Old
Testament. But what? was there a fault in that Testament? why, God was the
Author of it, and God I hope makes no faults?

In the matter and substance of the covenant there was no fault: but in the
circumstance, and that in respect of us, not of it. It was weak in regard of
the flesh, Romans 8.3. a condition of that covenant was, that we should serve
God, and obey his Laws: we were not able to do it, Hebr. 7.19.
therefore that covenant was weak and could not carry us to heaven: if it
could, there should have been no place for another.

Such, as no complaint could be made any way of it.

The Old Testament was faulty: there is no fault in the New: because
whatsoever is wanting on our part, is abundantly supplied by our SAVIOR
CHRIST, the Mediator of the New Testament: therefore this is to be had in
great price and estimation with us all.

VERSE 8.
NOw that another was introduced in the room of it blaming the other; he
proves by the words of the Prophet himself: Where, 1. An allegation of the
testimony.

2. A collection deduced out of it, Verse 13. Complaining of them that they had
not kept the former covenant; there was the fault, it could not be performed,
whereupon another was inferred. Graec. it is, reprooving he said to them, that
is, reproving the imbecillitie of the Old Testament, and showing the defects of
it, he said to them.

The days come -- namely at Christ's coming in the flesh, and at the
revelation of the Gospel.

I will make: when I will perfect or consummate: whereas it is in the Hebrew
(Caratti,) pangam.

A new covenant. This is more effectual; that was but an imperfect covenant:
this shall be a perfect, and a full one.

With the house of Israel: upon the house of Israel: this shall rest upon them,
whereas the other passed from them.

And the house of Judah. These two houses be now rent one from another: but by
this covenant I will unite and conjoyne them.

Some by the house of Israel understand the Gentiles: by the house of Judah the
Jews.

The New covenant is more sweet and comfortable, than the Old.

As God promised; so he performed: He is not as man that He should lie; nor as
the Son of man, that He should repent. Men say and unsay: they promise
mountains, and scant perform molehills: but God will ever be as good as his
word: as he promised to make this New Testament; so indeed he did.

VERSE 9.
THe New Covenant is described two kind of ways.

1. What it is not. 2. What it is. It is not like the Old Testament: where
there is a threefold dissimilitude between them.
1. In respect of the Persons: that was made with their fathers in the time of
the Law; this shall be made with their posterity in the time of the Gospel.

2. In respect of the time: that was made at their delivery out of Egypt, when
the Law was given by Moses; this at their delivery out of the spiritual Egypt
by Christ.

This was not the same day they came out of Egypt: for the Law was not given
till so many days after: but day is put for time.

That deliverance is amplified by the Author and the manner how.

The Author was God: the manner was kind, loving and careful: as a father
takes his Child by the hand, least he should fall, or, miscarry by the way.

3. By an effect, that ensued on the imbecility of the covenant: it was broken
because of the hardness of it.

In the Hebrew it is, which they brake. St. Paul follows the Septuagint: the
sense is all one.

One condition of the covenant was, that they should continue in obedience to
me; but they did not: therefore that covenant being broken, it was time for a
new to come: let us pray to God for grace to continue in that, which we
promised in baptism.

And I regarded them not: whereupon he was even with them; they cast off Him,
and he cast off them.

The Greek here is much different from the Hebrew: but if the Hebrew words be
read with an interrogation, the sense of the Greek agrees well with them. And
should I be still as an Husband to them? they have played the Harlot and
broken the covenant on their part, and shall I stand to the covenant: shall I
be as an Husband to them, when as they are no Wife to me? Nay, I will set them
as light as they do me. I regard them not: I cast off the care of them. Though
the words differ, the sense is all one: therefore that must be no stone for us
to stumble at.

Hebrew. Et ego dominabar in eis. I showed my self to be their Lord and master
in punishing them; which is the right of Masters to do.

Properly to speak, God has no hand to take us by: but this is spoken
metaphorically for our comfort. As if the child be fallen into a ditch, the
father in kindness takes him by the hand, and pulls him out: so deals our
heavenly father with us, who is far more merciful than earthly parents can
be to their Children. The incomprehensible love of God toward us is set forth
by diverse similitudes in Scripture. Sometimes he is compared to an Eagle, that
fluttereth over her birds, and preserves them from all dangers: sometimes to
an Hen, gathering us as Chickens under his wing. Sometimes to a father, as in
this place, and many others. In all calamities he takes us by the hand and
leads us out. He has not only committed us to the Angels hands, as Psalm. 91.
and the Angel took Lot by the hand, and brought him out of Sodom: but he
gives us his own hand. If the King should take us by the hand, when we are in
any distress; it would greatly cheer us. The King of Kings whose power none
can resist, takes us by the hand in all our miseries. Let that be a staff of
comfort for us to lean upon. As he took the Israelites by the hand, and lead
them out of Egypt: So, though we cannot see it with our bodily eyes, he
takes us by the hand in all miseries.

If men should be in prison for righteousness sake, as Joseph was, till the
iron entered into his soul; God at the length takes us by the hand and pulls us
out. If we be in poverty ready to starve, as Elias was under the Juniper tree,
God takes us by the hand of his mercy, by some means or other and helps us
out. If we be in banishment, as the Israelites in Babylon, and as many of our
Country men were in Queen Mary's days; God takes us by the hand and brings us
out. If we be in some terrible and dangerous sickness, as Hezekiah was, even
at the point of death; God takes us by the hand, and pulls us out of it. If we
be on the Sea ready to be drowned, as the Disciples were; God takes us by the
hand and delivers us out of the raging tempest. O singular comfort, that we
have such a friend as God Almighty is! He takes us by the hand in all
calamities. Let him have our hand and heart too. Let us be careful to please
him all the days of our life.

He does not say, they never begun to keep my Testament: but they continued not
in my covenant. It is like they made many fair beginnings, were very forward
at the first: but they shrunk in the wetting and continued not: Therefore God
shook them off. Ye are they that continued with me in my temptations. Be
faithful to the end, etc. I will run the way of thy Commandments to the
end, said David. Let us not run apace for a while, but let us hold out running
to the end, else we shall miss of the gold of eternal life. Remember Lots
Wife: she went out of Sodom, but because she looked back, she was turned into
a pillar of Salt. Let us not turn out of the way of Gods Commandments, but
continue in his covenant: else he will cast us off. Now of our selves, we have
no power to continue, no more than we had to begin. Let us entreat him that
has begun a good work in us, to finish it to the day of Christ.

Many flatter themselves in Gods mercies: o God is merciful; though we sin, he
will not punish us: he will wink at our iniquities, therefore we need not be so
shie of sin. Though we live in drunkenness, uncleanness, pride,
covetousness, yet we may be in the favor of God. Indeed God is of
wonderful mercy: he is called the father of mercies in the plural number,
not of Justices. There is a whole Psalm of his mercy: and so not of his
justice. Yet we must not imagine, that his mercy can put his justice out of
place. To penitent sinners as the Publican was, as Mary Magdalen was, that
watered Christ's feet with her tears, he is merciful: but to them that
continue in their sins, he will show himself to be just, and power down the
vials of his wrath on them: he cast off the Israelites his own chosen people
for their abominable sins: and do you think that we shall escape, which are
but wild Olives, and adopted Children in comparison of them? There is no
dallying with God; if we continue not in his covenant, he will reject us.

VERSE 10.
YE have seen what it is not: now consider what it is; which has three
branches.

1. A renovation of their hearts to keep his laws, Verse 10.

2. An illumination of their understanding to know his will, Verse 11.

3. The remission of all their sins against his Law, and so consequently
eternal happiness, Verse 12.

He points out this New Testament, much discrepant from the other; which I will
dispose: As we say, I ordain this my last will and Testament in manner
following: So this is the Testament which I ordain: the Testament which I
testate.

With the house of Israel: under the which the house of Judah is comprehended,
that is the whole Church.

In those days: when Christ the Son of righteousness shall clearly shine
in the preaching of the Gospel, says the LORD, which is not as man that he
should repent, nor the Son of man that he should lie.

I will put my Laws. In the Hebrew it is the singular number; in the Greek,
the plural. All my Laws, appertaining to the first and second table, I will
leave none of them out.

Into their mind, the discoursing faculty of the mind: whereby they shall
conclude within themselves, that it is the best course they can take, to serve
me; That they may understand it. Into their hearts, that they may love, embrace
and keep it. Hebrew, into the midst of them.

Not in Tables of stone, as at the first, but in the fleshie tables of their
heart. This is the difference between the Law and the Gospel, 2 Cor. 3.3. and
6. God will not only put his Laws into our eyes, ears, tongues, hands, feet.
In these parts the wicked may have the Law of God; they may look on the
Scriptures, talk of them, hear Sermons, etc. but he will put them into our
hearts, and the heart shall set all the members of the body on work. He will
write them there; engrave them, that they shall never be rased out: nothing
shall blot out that writing.

Then follows the conditions of the covenant on both parts: as it is in all
covenants. On Gods behalf; he will be our God, he will protect and defend us,
provide all good things for us, for this life and the life to come: no enemy
shall hurt us, he will give us all things, that be good. On our part; we must
be his people, that is worship him, depend on him by a lively faith, live in
obedience to him, serve him and no other. Happy is the people that have God for
their Lord. God is a good God to us, but we are an ungracious and unthankefull
people to him.

VERSE 11.
THe second branch of the covenant: there shall be then more plentiful
knowledge, then was in the time of the Law: which is declared negatively and
affirmatively.

The lesson taught by them is this, know the Lord: this shall not need then:
earthly Schoolemasters may be removed, and put up their pipes: we shall all
have an heavenly Schoolmaster, which is the Holy Ghost, Ioh. 6.45. Ioh. 14.26.
1 Ioh. 2.27.

But what? shall not one neighbor instruct an other in the time of the
Gospel? yes verily: exhort one another: edify one another in your most holy
faith. Priscilla and Aquila taught Apollos. Augustine and others think that
this is spoken of the Saints in heaven, but the text will not suffer it.

Sol. 1. Then there shall not be so many particular ceremonies, the
signification whereof one should teach another, as there were in the time of
the Law.

2. This is spoken not simply but comparatively. The Holy Ghost shall be
powered down in such plentiful measure upon all: the light of the Gospel,
that was hidden under dark shadows in the time of the Law, shall now shine so
brightly to all, as that the teaching by friends and neighbors shall in a
manner be superfluous: yet for all that this neighbour-like instruction one of
another shall remain still: but there shall not be so great necessity of it,
as there was before.

The affirmative part. If all shall know the Lord, then there shall be no need
to teach one another, who the Lord is: but all shall know the Lord, ergo.

Which is confirmed by a distribution, great and small shall know him: ergo,
all shall know him.

He does not mean the least in age, for little infants and children are not
now capable of the knowledge of God, no more then theirs in the time of the
Law: but from the meanest in estate and condition to the highest. Not Scholars
alone and book-learned men shall know the Lord, but even artificers, Plowmen,
they that be least in the reputation of the world.

All: all estates and conditions of men.

Or, as much as lies in me that am the teacher, all shall know me. A Preacher
teaches in the Pulpit, and all that be in the Church may learn of him if
they will. The Sun shines in the firmament, and all may be comforted by it;
yet the bleared eyes are not. It is their fault, if all know me not.

Ob. 2. If all shall know the Lord, then the Scriptures shall be unnecessary:
we shall all be taught by the Holy Ghost; therefore we need not the dead
letter of the Scripture, such a dumb Schoolmaster as the Scripture is.

Sol. Yes verily: for the Holy Ghost teaches us by the Scripture, he unfoldeth
to us the meaning of the Scripture: he instructed the Eunuch by the Scripture.
They might as well reason; an excellent learned man shall teach in such a
town, therefore the Scholars taught by him shall need no books. The
Scripture is the book, whereby God teaches us: therefore that still must be
turned over by us. Our Savior sends us to the Scriptures, Ioh. 5.39. Romans
15.4. 2 Pet. 1.19. 1 Timothy 4.13.

Object. 3. If all shall know God, then away with Schools of learning and
Universities to train up men to the ministry in: yea, away with the ministry
it self: what need we any Ministers and Preachers in every town to instruct
us in the knowledge of the Lord?

Sol. Yes: they are Gods mouths, by whom he speaks to us, by whom he
reveals the knowledge of his Majesty to us. Christ knew there should be
plenty of knowledge at his coming, yet he bade his Apostles go and teach all
nations. The Lord opened the heart of Lydia, yet it was by Saint Paul's
preaching: the Lord catechized the Eunuch; yet it was by Saint Philip: the Lord
added three thousand souls to the Church; yet it was by Saint Peter. How can
they hear without a Preacher?

These be the Schoolmasters by whom God teaches us to the end of the world.
The head Master of a School does not take away the Vshers. Saint Augustine
tract 3. in 1. Iohann. Si unctio docet de omnibus, nos sine causa laboramus?
Let us put you all over to the anointing: then they might reply, why do
thou write this Epistle to us? why do thou teach us? nos extrinsecus
admonemus: magister intus est, qui docet, Matthew. 23.8. Nos abusive magistri
appellamur. Neither does he send down the HOLY GHOST on them in the
similitude of cloven tongues, as he did on the Apostles at the beginning: they
must be brought up in Schools and Universities to attain to the knowledge of
the tongues, and the right interpretation of the Scripture. Paul mentions it as
a blessing, that he was brought up at the feet of Gamaleel: he disputed in
the School of Tyrannus; but he never wished the School of Tyrannus to be
pulled down.

This does declare to us the wonderful abundance of knowledge that shall be
in the time of the Gospel, above that which was in the time of the Law: yet
there be a number of ignorant persons in the lap of the Church, Act. 19.
like them that knew not whether there was an Holy Ghost or no; They have a
confused knowledge of God, but they do not know him so distinctly in CHRIST as
they ought to do: they have the more to answer for, that living in so great
light, are still overwhelmed with darkness: like to Tantalus, up to the chin
in water, and yet dry: like careless and negligent Scholars, that have been
long at School and learned nothing: the fault is not in God, who gives them
the means, but in themselves that neglect the means.

2. As we have greater knowledge: so greater obedience is required of us. The
servant that knows his masters will and does it not, shall be beaten with
many stripes. We know much and practice little: therefore our condemnation
shall be the greater at the latter day.

VERSE 12.
THe third branch of the new covenant, is remission of sins. In sense it
agrees with the Hebrew: only the Apostle following the seventie has for our
further comfort enlarged it by the addition of one clause, which is not in the
Hebrew. The first part of Verse is not in the Hebrew.

In my Son CHRIST JESUS, I will be merciful to their unjust and unrighteous
dealings, to all the injuries they have offered me.

(...), faults in manners, when as we swarve from the mark of the Law of God:
(...), in general signifies all transgressions of the Law. He uses many words
to signify to us, that all our sins, by what names soever they be called,
are forgiven us. In acquittances we use to put in words enough, for the
declaration of a full discharge: So does the Lord, when he acquitteth us of all
our sins: whether they be unrighteousness, slips, or violations of the Law,
they be all forgiven: he professes he will remember them no more: he will
cast them behind his back, raze them out of the book of his remembrance. If
we mind to be revenged of a man, we say, well, I will remember thee, I will
one day pay thee home for it: but God will not so much as remember our sins.
Oh blessed thing! The just man falls seven times a day: yet GOD will not
remember his falls.

1 Samuel 15.2.
He remembered the sin of Amalek: and of some he says, their sins shall be
written with a pen of a diamond, and sealed up in a bag: but he will keep
no register of our sins, they shall be quite forgotten.

He does not say; because they by their works of penance have made
satisfaction to my justice for their sins, therefore I will remit them, I
will do it of my sole mercy and goodness: for my own sake, etc.

Object. Was he not merciful to the sins of the people in the time of the
Law?

Sol. The forgiveness of sins is now more clearly manifested to us. To them
it was shadowed out by sacrifices and washings: but now the Lamb is come,
offered on the Cross, whose blood purges us from all sin.

This is a comfortable covenant, the heavenly triacle and honey of the soul.
Our sins are innumerable: besides our blasphemies, besides the abominable
drunkenness, and whoredom that is amongst us, our greedy scraping in the
dunghill of the earth, seldom or never lifting up our hearts to heaven, we
sin daily in our best actions: we sin in preaching of the Word: for who
preaches with such wisdom, sincerity and zeal as he ought to do? we sin in
hearing, our minds oftentimes are on wooll-gathering: our bodies in the
Church, our hearts on our Sheep and Oxen: we hear more like Judges to censure
Gods Ambassador, than as Scholars to learn of him: we sin in praying, no
sighs, no groans, no fervency in our prayers, no Amen at the end of them: we
sin in giving of our alms; we give rather for vain glory, then for Gods
glory: we sin in our daily talk and conferences one with another, in them we
seek the ostentation of our own wit and learning, not the edification one of
another. Who can clear himself of pride? we are proud of our wit, wealth,
beauty, learning, yea some are proud of nothing. Good Lord! then if God should
call us into the counting house for our sins, alas what shall we do? we cannot
answer him one for a thousand: and the least sin deserves eternal death.
Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy thought: if one evil thought
remain unforgiven, we are in a miserable case. Against all these let us hold
up the buckler of this new covenant, of the remission of our sins. (...),
sins are bitter accusers. In what a pitiful case was Caine, who said, my
sin is greater than can be forgiven? what a howling kept Judas, O I have
sinned in betraying innocent blood? what makes men to hang themselves, as
Achitophel did, to drown themselves; to lay violent hands on themselves; save
that they cannot be persuaded of the forgiveness of their sins? Therefore let
us bless God for this covenant: and let us entreat him to seal in our hearts
a comfortable persuasion of the remission of our sins daily more and more.

VERSE 13.
HEre follows a collection inferred on the former testimony; which he
gathers out of the word (new:) it has his force from the contraries. New and
Old cannot stand together. God Himself has prophesied of a new covenant:
therefore the old must vanish away.

Antiquavit: vetus fecit, seu vetus esse declaravit: in respect of the age and
antiquity of it.

Now that, which is abrogated, by the appointment of GOD Himself: And waxes
old, that is in regard of the weakness and imbecility of it: which is like
to an old man that leanes on his staff, and has one foot already in the
grave.

It is near vanishing, that is, out of sight, never to be seen again. He
says ( near,) because it was with honor to be buried by little and little.

From hence he deduceth the abrogation of the Old Testament, which is a matter
of great weight: and that the Apostle gathers out of one word: every word in
holy Scripture is diligently to be observed of us: a deep mystery may lie
hid in a word.

The introduction of a new thing demonstrates the abrogation of the old.

A new husband argues the death of the old: a new statute, repealing that which
went before, makes the old statute of no force: a new house cannot be set up,
unless the old be pulled down: a new Will overthrows the old Will. God
speaking of a New Testament, did prognosticate the abrogation of the old.

The Jews were wonderfully wedded to the Ceremonial Law and Leviticall
Priesthood: they thought that should last for ever: Circumcision, Genesis 17.13.
the Passover, Exodus 12.14. but ( Gnolam) does sometimes signify longum, sed
determinatum tempus: as Deuteronomy. 15.17. either to the year of Iubilee, or to the
end of his life.

The whole ceremonial Law was in time to vanish away: and so was the old
covenant, that God made with the people at the delivery of the moral Law: and
the new covenant of the Gospel most sweet and comfortable was to succeed in
the room thereof. And farewell that old one, that was terrible to them all:
let this new one be welcome to us, that is full of heavenly comfort.

CHAP. 9.
IN the Priesthood of our Savior Christ there be two things. 1. His calling
to the sacred office, cap. 7.8. 2. The exequution of his office. cap. 9.10.

To shut up our selves within the compass of this Chapter, it may be divided
into two parts.

1. A narration of the type, about the which the Priests did minister in the
time of the Law. a 1. ad 11.

2. Is an application of it to our Savior Christ prefigured by it: where, 1.
There is an application of the Tabernacle with the service thereof, ab. 11. ad
21. then of the rites belonging to the Tabernacle; a 21. to the end.

The Tabernacle is applied to Christ. 1. As he is a Priest reconciling us to
God. ab 11. to 15. 2. As he is a Testator making a gracious Will and testament
for us, a 15. to 21.

In the type there are four points or circumstances.

1. The things typical, in the five former Verses. 2. The typical actions.
6.7. 3. The signification of them. 8.9. 4. The subject whereabout they be
occupied. 10.
VERSE 1.
THe things were of two sorts. 1. Certain external rites and ceremonies.

2. An holy and magnificent place to use them in. The things are set down
generally, Verse 1. Then particularly.

Ye have heard that there be two testaments; the first and the second:
therefore to return again to the first, I will tell you what it had: that
first, that waxes old, and is ready to vanish away.

It had many excellent things.

It did not only consist of bare and naked words, but it had certain
ceremonies to adorn it withal.

Had: not (...): for the date of it is out.

(...), of service: wherewith GOD was served and worshipped.

Iustifications. The ceremonies are so called, not because they did justify,
but because they shadowed out our Justification by CHRIST.

Some distinguish the two first, ordinances, religions or worshippings: yet in
all Greek coppies they be conjoined.

An holy place: (Mikdash) where these ordinances were put in exequution, Exodus
25.8. It was a token of Gods dwelling among them: it was removed from place to
place: and God continually went with them.

Yet this holy place has an epithete to abase it withal, to pull down the
glory of it, least the Jews should have too high an opinion of it. Some
interpret it, whereinto the people and all nations of the world might enter:
as if he spoke of that place which was appointed to the people to meet in: but
that is quite dissonant from the scope of the Text: for this worldly Sanctuary
he divides afterward but into two parts, not into three: he meddles only with
that, which was a type of Christ's Priesthood, pretermitting that which
belonged to the people.

He calls it a worldly one.

1. Because it was made after the manner of the world: for as God stretched the
firmament as a veil and curtain to separate the things above from them
beneath; so the Sanctuary had a veil, that made a separation between the
first and second Tabernacle.

2. Because it was made of worldly matter, as of hair, silk, etc.

3. Because it was not eternal, as our Sanctuary of heaven is, where our
High Priest appears for us before God: but a frail, brittle and mortal
Sanctuary, as the world is.

1. As the Old Testament had many ordinances of Religion; so has the New
Testament: that had her rites; and this has rites belonging to it. 1. Theirs
were many. 2. They did signify Christ to come: ours are few, and demonstrate
him come. We have new Sacraments, new constitutions; baptism instead of
circumcision; the Supper of the LORD instead of the Passover. Sundry religious
ordinances are appointed in the New Testament: that there should be every LORDS
day a collection for the poor: that the man being after a more excellent
manner the Image of God should pray bare-headed, not being ashamed to show his
head, but having a kind of head-ship over the woman; and the woman should
cover her head, when she prays: that an order should be kept in
prophesying, etc. no Christian Church can consist without some external rites
and ceremonies, which if they be not repugnant to the Word of God, are to be
observed by us, as these ordinances of religion were by the Jews.

All true Christian Churches agree in the substance of Religion: but all
disagree in ceremonies. Socrat. Zozom. Theodoret. in their Ecclesiastical
histories show, that some Churches pray to the East, some to the West; some
eat fish, some fowls in the time of Lent; some abstain from both: yet all
accord in CHRIST the head. Even so at this present day the French Church have
one kind of ceremonies, the Dutch another, the English different from them
both. In the Church of Geneva they receive the Communion with Wafer-cakes. In
some Churches they sit, in the Church of England we kneel at the celebration
of the Supper. In these indifferent things which in their own nature are
neither good, nor evil, we must not contend, breaking the peace and unity of
the Church: but we must do, as Saint Augustine did, submit our selves to the
authority of the Christian Magistrate, not only for fear, but for conscience
sake: if he command any thing we are sure is repugnant to the Word of God, then
obey God rather than man: but if it be a thing indifferent, then obey both God
and man. Beza himself says of the Cross in baptism, that is used in the
Church of England; utantur liberate sua: for these things all Churches have
their liberty, and let them use it in the fear of God. The Old Testament had
her ordinances: the New Testament has hers: one Church has this ceremony;
another that. For the peace of Sion, let us not contend about these things, but
be thankful to God for the pearl of the Gospel continuing among us.

And as they had a Sanctuary, to the which they resorted unto the public
worship of God: so have we our Churches and places of holy meetings, which are
carefully to be frequented by us. O how love I the place of thy habitation,
says David, and that where thy honor dwells? but we love our own houses;
our burling parkes, loomes, shops, barnes and stables above the place of Gods
worship.

2. We have here a cooling epithete. Whatsoever things are worldly, we ought
not to be too much in love with them. The Jews Sanctuary how sumptuous soever
it was, the glorious Temple at Jerusalem the wonder of the whole earth, was
but a worldly thing. The great Cathedral Churches, that be in this land so
stately and magnificent: all inferior Churches and Chappells where we serve
God, yea even the kings Chapel (if you look at the fabric of them) are
worldly things: all fair and costly buildings: the Royal Exchange, the new
Burse, all Lord-like and regal palaces are but worldly things: silver and
gold which we all hunt after, silks and velvets, all fine and gallant
apparel: a table richly furnished with all kind of delicates, large lands and
ample revenews, a great troop of serving men following us at our heels, all
these are but worldly things, vain, fickle, transitory; they vanish away like
the smoke.

We our selves are but worldly things; out of the earth we were taken, to the
earth we must return: therefore let us not be enflamed too much with the love
of these worldly things: the glory of this world fades away like a flower;
therefore let us use it, as if we used it not; let not this world be our
Paradise: let us remember it is but a strange Country, by the which we pass as
travelers.

They be the wicked, that are the men of this world; let us be men of another
world, and have our conversation in heaven.

VERSE 2.
HE begins with the tabernacle, which he tells us was divided into two parts:
for the tabernacle was disposed of after this manner: so the word, Verse 6.

The first verily wherein, etc.

It is described, 1. By the things it had in it. 2. By the name of it.


It had three things in it.

The Candlestick: which was so framed, that it had seven lights on it: three
on either side; one aloft. Some read it (...), in the plural number: but it
comes all to a reckoning, Exodus 25.31.

This did signify that the Ministers should be full of light, Matthew. 5. You
are the light of the world. The shaft that sustained the branches whereon stood
the Lamps, was a figure of Christ, which sustaineth those lights that be in
the Church: without him the light of the ministry would be extinguished and
fall to the ground.

2. The Table on the which stood the show bread.

Here it is (...): for (...); an hypallage: they were so called, because they
were apposed or set upon the Table by the Priests, Matthew. 12.4. Exodus 25.30.
Lechem panim. Hebr. panis facierum: because they were set face to face one over
against another; and because they were set on the table before the face of the
Lord.

It is called Panis jugis, Number. 4.7. because it was to be continual and holy
bread, 1 Samuel 21.5.

The Table did signify Christ, which is as a rich Table well furnished for us
all. The Shewbread set upon it did signify the preaching of the Gospel, the
subject whereof is Christ: or it did signify the Church: as bread nourishing
the body, so that the soul.

1 The shewbread might never be wanting: no more must the preaching of the
Gospel: where prophecy fails, etc.

2 As Matthew. 12.4. So we must be made spiritual Priests, before we can truly
feed upon the Gospel.

In the Old Testament there was one Table: in the New we have two Tables: the
one is a Sacramentall-table in this life, 1 Cor. 10.21. We call it the
Communion Table, but we might call it the Lords Table, the Table of the Lord
Jesus, whose Ghests we are at his Table. Upon that Table stood the Shewbread:
upon this Table stands Christ Jesus the Bread of Life, to be eaten of us all
after a spiritual manner: the other is an heavenly Table in the life to come,
Luke 13.29. Let us behave our selves well at this Table in this life, coming
to it with all reverence, and feeding on Christ, to the comfort of our souls,
that we may be partakers of that celestial Table, where we shall eat of the
hidden Manna for evermore.

Not (...) in the singular number, holy: but (...) in the plural, as the other
(...), Verse 3. how thou my God walk in the Sanctuary.

VERSE 3.
FOr there were two vailes: the one in the entry of the first tabernacle,
which separated it from the place where the people were; the other at the end
of the first tabernacle, which separated it from the Holy of Holies, Exodus
26.33. and 36.40.27.

The Holy of Holies: deus Deorum: the song of songs: that is, the most holy
place.

This Tabernacle is described by the situation, the name, the things contained
in it.

VERSE 4.
ANd that had two things in it.

The golden censer: it may be in David's or Salomons time, a golden censer was
put into the Sanctum Sanctorum.

The word does signify either a censer to hold incense; or an Altar to burn
incense: now neither of the significations seem to agree to the place.

1. We read not in Moses of any censer that was laid up in the Holy of Holies:
if there had been one, he specifying less matters then that, would not have
buried it in silence.

2. As for the Altar of incense, that stood in the first Tabernacle, not in the
second, Exodus 40.26. in the same Tabernacle where the Table was, Verse 24.

Iunius is of opinion, that the Holy of Holies had two parts: the one a Porch
or entrance into it; the other the magnificent place it self. Now in the
entrance stood the Altar of the incense, Exodus 30.6. the Holy or Holies had
(...) and (...), Hebr. 6.19. In that which was (...) was the Altar placed: now
into this Porch of the Holy of Holies the High Priest might come every day:
Exodus 30.7. whereas into the house it self, he might enter but once a year.

Others, that the Holy of Holies is said to have this Altar, not because it was
within it; but it had it as a servant to minister to it. As a King may be said
to have his guard, though they be not in the same Chamber where the King is.

But why might not this be the golden censer, which Aaron took with him, when
he went into the Holy of Holies? the which he filled before with burning
coals from the Altar, that stood in the first Tabernacle, as he entered into
the second, Levit. 16.12.

The second thing which the most holy place had, was the Arc of the Testament:
which was so called, because the Law or Testament was put into it.

Object. 1 Reg. 8.9. 2 Chronicles. 5.10. Exodus 40.20. no commandment to put the
other there. As for the Pot of Manna, it was commanded to be set before the
Lord, and it was laid up before the testimony, Exodus 16.33.34. but not in the
testimony. And Aarons rod was laid up before the testimony, not in it, Number.
17.10.

Sol. The greatest part of interpreters will have (...) to be referred not to
(...) the nearest, but to (...), Verse 3. as Verse 2. (...) is referred not to
(...), but to (...), which is remotior.

In which Tabernacle. And then there is no question to be made: they were all
in the Tabernacle: the Pot and the Rod before the Arc, and the Tables within
the Arc.

But it seems by the construction of the Apostle, that it cannot be so:
(...), and Verse 5. (...) must needs be referred to (...), the Arc, not the
Tabernacle.

2. Therefore to answer to that, 1 Reg. 8.9.

In Solomon's time none but the Tables were in the Arc: yet after the Captivity
in Babylon for the better preservation of them, these likewise were put into
the Arc: but where read we that? or what warrant had they to put them in?

2. The adversative particle (...), which the seventie use, is not in the
Hebrew. I, but that, which is aequivalent, is: and not in the Arc (Sub.
anything) only the two Tables of stone.

3. It may be a Synecdoche. Nothing worthy the speaking of in comparison of
them: I have none in heaven or earth but thee, that is in comparison of thee,
but that can hardly stand.

4. When the Tabernacle was made, they were all put into the Arc; after the
Temple was erected being more spacious, the Pot and the Rod were disposed of in
another place, and the Tables only left in the Arc: for he seems to speak
of that as of a new thing.

From hence the Jesuits collect the reservation and adoration of the relickes
of the Saints. Why may not we reserve the Cross, some pieces of CHRIST 's
Coat, of the bones and garments of holy men, as the Israelites did the pot of
manna, and Aarons rod, and why may we not believe the continuance of them, as
well as of these?

The reason is apparent: because they had Gods express commandment for their
warrant, which we want.

2. Though they were kept; yet they were not adored or worshipped, as their
relickes be, to the great dishonor of God, and robbing of his Majesty.

3. All things might not be reserved according to their own will and
inventions: they passed through the red Sea; yet we read of no sand, which they
kept as a memorial of it. The three Children came out of the fire unburnt: yet
we never read that the garments, wherewith they were in the fire, were reserved
as holy relikes. We must not keep things on our own brain, but by Gods
appointment and direction: if we do, they may stincke and rot, as Manna did,
when it was kept longer then God would have it.

4. These were of miraculous and extraordinary things: but of every thing they
make a relicke!

5. These we know to be true: the most of theirs, (I believe) are false, and
counterfeit.

They are called the tables of the Testament, because they contained Gods Will
and Testament.

See what cost was bestowed on the Tabernacle. They were not of Judas his
mind: he said of the box of ointment; wherefore served this waste? they said
not so of the Tabernacle: to what purpose is this waste? they contributed to it
with joyful and cheerful hearts: in so much as Moses was feign by public
Proclamation to restrain them: the people brought too much. Where is this
zeal now in the time of the Gospel? we grudge almost at all things that are
bestowed on the house of God. In many places an homely Communion Table, we
would be ashamed to have such a one in our own houses: no decent Carpet to
cover the Table withal: their vessels were of Gold; we cannot get silver Cups
for the Table of the Lord Jesus. We have not so much love to the Gospel, as
they to the Law. They were more careful in adorning the shadow, than we are
of the body. Our own houses shall be glorious; it makes no matter how
inglorious the Lords house be.

Manna was a singular benefit which God bestowed on the Israelites: God sent it
them in the barren wilderness, when they were ready to faint: it came not from
the earth, but from heaven: our fathers did eat Manna from heaven: it was
Angels food: it was a type and figure of our Savior Christ. I am the true
bread that came from heaven: therefore God would have a pot full of it reserved
to all posterity, that so great a benefit might not slip out of remembrance.

We are to keep a register of all Gods mercies: but especially of them, that
be rare and extraordinary. In memorial of the passage of the Arc, and of the
Priests and people over Jordan, twelve stones were set up, according to the
number of the twelve tribes of Israel. God will not have their departure out of
Egypt, that was so miraculous, to be forgotten: therefore he puts it in the
forefront of the decalogue, I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of
the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

The Jews, Hest. 9.17. kept that as a festival day, wherein they were
delivered from the cruel plot of Haman. Let the like be practiced by us: let
not the year eighty eight be rased out of our memories, wherein we had such
an unexpected victory over the Spaniards, that were ready to swallow us up. The
time was when there was great scarcity of bread in these quarters, and then God
sent plenty of small fishes, which were instead of bread and meat to the
poor. Let that be reserved in our memories. Of late a most divellish and never
heard of treason was contrived by some Iesuited Papists to blow up the whole
realm: the which that it might never be forgotten in England, a perpetual
holy day is inacted, by act of Parliament, wherein public thanks is given to
God for it. One way or other such extraordinary mercies are to be imprinted in
our memories. A reservation of some external relicke is not always necessary;
there may be danger in that: if some part of the Gunpowder, or some of the
barrels, which they had laid in the vault, had been kept, it would not have
been so good, as a solemn day every year for the recordation of it. But alas,
we are all exceeding forgetful of Gods mercies: his judgments are soon
forgot: the terrible pestilence which at the beginning of the Kings reign swept
away so many thousands, is not remembered: much less will we remember the
favors and blessings of the Lord: beneficia nemo ponit in calendario: that is
good of our own benefits: but we must all put the benefits of God Almighty in
the calender of our minds for ever.

2. And Aarons rod that budded. The occasion was this. Whereas Corah Dathan and
Abiram with all that belonged to them were destroyed for their malepart dealing
against Moses and Aaron: the Israelites began to mutter at it, came to Moses
and Aaron saying, ye have killed the people of the Lord, Number. 16.41. whereupon
a great number of them were slain. Now to the intent that this murmuring
against the Priesthood might be stayed, Number. 17.1.
the Lord by a lively token would make manifest to all posterity, unto what an
high chair of honor he advanced it: he commanded 12. rods to be taken
according to the number of the 12. tribes: that tribe should have the
pre-eminence in the sanctuary, whose rod budded: now Aarons budded, and no
other: therefore he and the Tribe of Levi were to be acknowledged in
spiritual matters above the rest for ever.

This does signify to us what a care the Lord has of his sacred ministry,
which through the malice of Satan is ready to be contemned in the world. Hos.
4.4.
My people are as they that rebuke the Priest. A contemptuous rebuking of Gods
Ministers is a sin of sins, q. d. they cannot commit a greater offense then
this: they have no good success that resist Gods Ministers. Corah and his
accomplices were swallowed up by the earth alive. Ieroboams hand was dried up,
which he stretched out against the Prophet. Iesabel was eaten up with dogs,
that set her self against the servants of the Lord. Vzziah was smitten with a
Leprosy, for his contempt of the Priests. Ananias and Sapphira, that went
about to play mocke-holy day with Saint Peter, were smitten with sudden death.

Therefore let us take heed how we oppose our selves to the Ministers: how we
murmr against their authority, think or speak contemptibly of them. The
world may seek to depresse Aarons rod, but it shall bud and flourish in
despite of them all. Therefore let us have a reverent opinion of the Ministers:
let us esteem them as GOD 's stewards, as his Ambassadors, such as are over
us in the Lord. Let us submit our selves unto them, and receive them with fear
and trembling, as the Corinthians did Titus: when his Ministry is despised,
God is despised, and he will not put it up at our hands.

The third thing reserved were the Tables of the covenant. The Arc is a
representation of the Church, which above all other things must have the Law of
God in it. This golden Candlestick must hold up the Candle of the Word of God.
Hence it is that she is called the ground and pillar of truth: 1 Timothy 3.15.
not as if she were to determine what is truth, but as a pillar upholds the
house, so the Church the truth. Then what a Church is that Church of Rome, that
banishes the Law, that burns up the Bible, that seeks to suffocate the Truth?
She is no Arc, but a prison of the faithful.

This does declare to us, that the Law is to be had in perpetual remembrance.
Let us, that be Christians, not only have it in our bibles. Let us not only
talk of it with our tongues, but let us lay it up in the Arc and closet of
our hearts for ever. I have hid thy Law in my heart, says David. As the two
Tables of stone were laid up in the material Arc: so let us entreat the Lord
to write the tables of his Law in the fleshie tables of our heart: that it may
be our guide and comfort all the days of our life.

VERSE 5.
WE have heard what was in the Arc. Now let us see what was over it: the
Cherubims of glory: which are so termed, because the glorious God between them
did make answer. Cirbi, tanquam puer. Carab. they were certain images like to
little Children with fair and beautiful faces, and they had wings: by those
were signified the Angels, which are the Guardians and keepers of the Church:
figured by the Arc, Genesis 3.24. Psalm. 91.11.

Capphoreth, of Caphar: that signifies to cover, and to reconcile or pacify:
the covering of the Arc, Exodus 25.17.
where GOD by the High Priest was pacified with the people and obtained mercy
for them.

Therefore it is called the Mercy-seate: and Christ, Romans 3.25. is called
(...): from this Mercy-seate did God speak, Numb. 7.89. Psalm. 80.1.

Of the Cherubims vid. Exodus 25.18.

The Mercy-seat or covering of the Arc was a type of our Savior Christ, who
covers the Church with his righteousness, which is a propitiation for our sins.

The Cherubims are the Angels, that minister to Christ and his Church, Mat.
4.11. and an Angel comforted him in the Garden. As they ministered to him when
he was on the earth: so they be ministering Spirits for our salvation to the
worlds end.

As GOD spoke to Moses by the mercy seat: so does he to us by Christ.

2. At the Mercy-seate God showed himself to be favorable to the people: so
is he to us by Jesus Christ.

See in what an excellent estate the true members of the Church are: they have
many to protect them.

1. God as an Eagle does shadow us: Deuteronomy. 32.11.

2. CHRIST as a Hen does shadow us: the Holy Ghost also is a father to us. I
will not leave you Orphans: the Angels, they shadow us, they are ministering
spirits for our salvation: Ioh. 14.18.
they pitch their Tents about us, and hold us in their hands. The King of Tyrus
is called the anointed Cherub. Ezekiel. 28.14. and 16. the covering Cherub:
covering his people under the wing of his protection.

Sundry uses may be made of this.

1. We that be Christians may be more courageous then any other: we are better
guarded then any other: the wicked are guarded with the Devil and his Angels;
we with the holy and mighty Angels: they have the black guard; we the white:
an army of ten or twenty thousand men may be with them; but an army of an
hundred thousand thousand Angels is with us. Wheresoever we be, let us be as
bold as Lions, Neh. 6.11.

No King so guarded as we are.

2. Having such holy attendants as the Angels be, let us do nothing that may
grieve them, and make them weary of their service. Let the women be covered, 1
Cor. 11.10.
because of the Angels: so let not us that be Christians sit quaffing and
swilling, because of the Angels. Let us not be together by the ears, because
of the Angels. Let us not commit filthiness with Whores and harlots in secret
corners, because of the Angels: as our keepers be holy, so let us be holy.

3. Let us be thankful to God Almighty, that has given us his Angels to
overshadow us. Let us live in the fear of the living God in this world, that
we may sing praise to him with his Angels in the world to come.

Sundry other things there were about the tabernacle, the narration whereof
might have delighted the reader. But Saint Paul here jogs himself by the
elbow, and is a Moderatour to himself: you are desirous to hear more, but it
is expedient to cut them off. Wherein he may be a president to all teachers.
Though the discussing of curious and intricate questions would more delight the
auditory, yet we must not feed their humor that way. Let us give them but a
taste of them, and a whole mouthfull of sound and wholesome food. The Child
would take pleasure in a knife with a golden haft, but it shall be the
wisdom of the nurse to keep it from the Child: so the people as wayward
Children are much carried away with the golden show of witty conceits: but let
us that be their nurses, give them that milk which is most requisite for
them. Some peradventure in this place would have said; O Paul, why do thou
so slightly handle the things belonging to the tabernacle? repeat I pray thee
every particular to us; it does us good to hear of them: yet he does not
satisfy their itching ears in that. I but St. Paul has more necessary
matter. Let us especially be desirous to hear of Christ our High Priest and
Bishop of our souls, of repentance, of faith in him, of making our calling
sure by good works, of the true Sanctuary of heaven, then of those earthly
things; these are more profitable for us. Some at this day would have us to
discuss these questions in the pulpit: tell us on what day Adam fell; on what
day the Angels were created; what diversity there is among them: how original
sin is conveyed to us: speak of the diversity of glory in the life to come: as
for Christ, faith, good works, these be stale things. But we must not
satisfy them therein: curious matters must not be stood upon, when more
weighty and proffitable things are to be propounded. The Spirit of God passes
over sundry other things about the Tabernacle, because he had more
substantial points in hand tending to our salvation by Christ.

VERSE 6.
THe typical actions were either common to all the Priests, Verse 7. or proper
to the High Priests, Ver. 8.

Now when these things were thus ordained, that is all the parts of the
Tabernacle being framed, and all instruments set in their place.

In the actions belonging to all the Priests there are these circumstances.

1. The place where they did minister: to that they were tied and might go no
further.

2. The time when they did minister, (...), at every time, when it came to
their courses. Some or other were always to be employed in the first Tabernacle.

3. The manner of their ministry: they accomplished the services of Religion
and of divine worship, which the Lord had appointed to them: they trimmed the
lights, looked to the Table and show bread, that was on it, offered up
sacrifices and prayers for the people: for there was a morning and an evening
sacrifice every day.

All these things did the Priests in the first Tabernacle: and they did them
not by halves, but finished and accomplished them.

As they did their duties: so must we that be the Ministers of the Gospel,
do ours. We must give our selves to the Word of God and prayer: we must be
instant in season and out of season, feeding the flock committed to our charge:
we must administer the Sacraments for the strengthening of the faith of the
people, that when the great Shepherd shall appear, we may appear with him in
glory.

The killing of the beasts, the preparing of the wood, the kindling of the
fire, the offering up of the sacrifices to the Lord, the sprinckling of the
people, the instructing of them in the Law of God, this was the service of God
in the Old Testament. Now the public prayers of the Church, the reading of
Scripture in the congregation, the administration of the Sacraments, the
Preaching of the Word, these are the service of God in the New Testament. And
will you be sitting in the Church yard, when Gods service is exercised in the
Church, do ye make no more account of the service of God? It is a singular
honor to be Gods servant. Nebuchadnezar my servant. It is no disparagement to
the greatest Prince in the world to be Gods servant. The Angels glory in this,
that they are Gods servants. I am thy fellow servant.

Christ Himself took on him the form of a servant: he came into the world to
serve. There is no fishing to the Sea: no service to the King. Let us serve the
King of Kings with all cheerfulness in this world, that we may reign with
him in the world to come.

VERSE 7.
THe second part of the typical service, was performed by the common Priest:
the other typical action or service is peculiar to the High Priest: wherein
we have these circumstances.

1. The place where he served: it was the Holy of Holies.

2. How he served there: he had none of the inferior Priests with him, nor any
of his men to attend on him; neither Wife, Child, servant, nor friend might
go with him: he went into it alone: wherein he was a famous figure of our
SAVIOR CHRIST: who himself alone, without the Virgin Mary his mother, Peter,
Thomas, or any of the Apostles, made a propitiation for our sins.

As the High Priest did offer up blood alone for the sin of the people in the
second Tabernacle: So CHRIST alone has satisfied for our sins, 1 Pet. 2.24.
When he went to the Cross to be offered up for our sins, all his Disciples
left him: he was feign to be crucified Himself alone for us: therefore we are
beholden to him alone for the wonderful work of our redemption.

3. The time when he went: not once a day, but once a year. A straight charge
was given concerning it, Levit. 16.2.

Why did he go into it but once a year?

1. That this sacrifice offered once a year by the High Priest might be more
solemn, and the better regarded by the people: those things that are done
daily, are less esteemed: that which comes seldom is more reverenced.

2. To signify that CHRIST once entered into heaven for us with his own blood,
Verse 12. his one sacrifice once offered was sufficient: this was called the
feast of expiation: and it was on the tenth of September only.

4. With what he went.

The blood of a young bullock which he offered for himself, Levi. 16.11. the
blood of a goat for the people, Verse 15.

That is illustrated by the end, why the blood was offered.

1. For the expiation of his own sins, Verse 17.

2. For the sins of the people, Verse 16.

Here it is ( ignorances.) 1. A Metonymie for the sins committed in ignorance.

2. It may be a Synecdoche, one particular sin being put for all: for all kind
of sins are reckoned up, Levit. 16.16.

Not one ignorance, but many.

Ignorance is one chief and capital sin; being put for all: because it is the
mother in some sort of all sin. For in all sins we commit, though we be endowed
with singular knowledge, our understanding for the time is blinded by Satan and
our own corruption.

Here we may see that ignorance is a sin. Some Papists make a virtue of it: she
is the mother of devotion: whereas in truth she is the mother of destruction:
ye err, not knowing the Scriptures. For the better explication of it; there
is a double ignorance, the one negative, the other privative. As for that which
is by negation, when God in wisdom has denied to us the knowledge of some
things, it is no sin to be ignorant of them: this ignorance was in Christ,
which knew no sin, he was ignorant of the day of judgment: but privative
ignorance is a sin; for us to be deprived by the fall of Adam of that
excellent light wherein we were created, this is a sin, and may justly be
required of us.

There was a sacrifice for sins of ignorance: Hab. 3.1.
a prayer for ignorances. 2 These. 1.8.
Christ shall come in flaming fire rendering vengeance to them that know him not.
Therefore let us not sooth up our selves in our ignorances: let us read the
Scriptures, hear Sermons, confer with learned men, pray to God to illuminate
the eyes of our understanding, that we may be plucked out of the pit of
ignorance daily more and more.

2. Here we learn, that there is ignorance in the best of us all: the
High Priest himself had ignorance in him: and so has the Pope by his leave,
which challenges to himself the title of the highest Priest in the time of
the Gospel. It may be an axiom with them, that he cannot err in Cathedra
docentis: yet he has filled the world with his errors.

Not the most profound Divine, nor learned Preacher in the world, but has his
ignorance. Ezra was a perfect Scribe in the Law of the God of heaven, yet he
had his ignorance. Apollos an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures, had
his ignorance, he was feign to be put to School to tent-makers, to learn of
them. The Apostles themselves, though in writing and preaching they could not
err, yet they had their ignorances: even after Christ his Ascension into
heaven, and the pouring down of the Holy Ghost on them. St. Peter as yet was
ignorant of the conversion of the Gentiles, and it seemed a while as a Paradox
to him. All the learned men of this age, as of precedent ages, have their
ignorances: there be many places of Scripture, which our best commentators
profess they understand not. Therefore let none be proud of their knowledge;
but let us all be humbled with the cogitation of our ignorance, and mourn for
it, to our dying day. Let us desire to be in that place, where we shall see,
not any longer in a glass, as now we do, but face to face, and have the full
knowldge of God Almighty.

There is no man that sins not. Noah a Preacher of righteousness, yet he
sinned. Ezra the Priest of the High God of heaven, yet he sinned: all the
Priests of the Old Testament had their sins and infirmities; they offered for
themselves as well as for the people. The Ministers of the New Testament have
their sins too. Paul and Barnabas worthy Preachers, were sinners, they were at
variance one with another. St. Peter that famous Champion of Christ, had his
sin. So have we all, Ministers and people; therefore we must offer up the
sacrifice of fervent prayer, for our selves and for the people too. It is
Christ's prerogative to be separate from sinners; all we have our sins.

He does not say, for the Idolatry of the people, for the blasphemies of the
people: for the murders, thefts, adulteries of the people: but for the
ignorances of the people. Ignorance is a grievous sin. Remember not how
ignorant I have been of thy truth. As ignorance is a great sin in all, so
chiefly in them that have the means. For them to be ignorant that are nusled
up in places where the Scriptures are locked up in an unknown tongue, is no
great wonder: for them in England to be ignorant, where a Sermon once a
quarter, is not much to be admired: but to live in a Town where the word has
been plentifully preached many years together, line upon line, Sermon on
Sermon, catechizing, etc. this is wonderful, and they shall be inexcusable at
the day of judgment. Woe to thee Corazin, etc. woe to thee, o England, o
Suffolk, o Barfold, if the preaching and prayers had been in Constantinople
that has been in thee, they would have brought forth better fruits than thou.
Shall a man that has eyes, live in the open light of the Sun, and see
nothing? Shall a Child go to School five or six years and learn nothing?
will you not grieve at it? Some have been in Christ's School ten, twenty
years, and yet they are ignorant of the principles of Religion. We read of
some that could not tell whether there were any Holy Ghost or not: Acts 19.2.
and there be some, it is to be feared, in this town, that cannot tell what
Christ is, what is his person, which are his offices, what faith is, etc. A
lamentable thing! It shall be easier for Sodom then for Capernaum: easier for
them that live among Turks, and Indians, then for us, that sit in the lap of
the Church, and yet are ignorant. Let us make much of the means, come to
Sermons cheerfully, hear attentively, look on the text, mark the notes how
they are derived out of it, call them to remembrance when ye come home, write
them in the Tables of your hearts, that ye may know God in Christ, to the
comfort of you all.

VERSE 8.
NOw follows the signification of the typical actions.

1. General. 2. Special.

Not Moses, not I of mine own brain, but the Holy Ghost and celestial
Spirit, by whom the Scriptures were written: therefore ye may be bold to give
credit to it.

Where there is, 1. The Author. 2. The thing signified.

In the Greek it is but of the Holies: yet that is put for the Holy of Holies:
even as it is termed (Hakodesh) Levit. 16.2.

Lo, say some, heaven was not opened in the time of the Law, till the passion
of our Savior Christ: therefore the Patriarchs and others that dyed then, went
not to heaven, but were in place of rest distinct from heaven: this is their
limbus patrum which they have forged.

But quickly to stop their mouths: it is not (...), but (...): a Gate in the
Kings Palace may be opened, though not known. The way to the Holiest of all,
that is to heaven, prefigured by their Sanctum Sanctorum, was not yet
manifested, it was obscured under Types and figures, darkely revealed to them.

Not all the people, but one man entered into the Holy of Holies, a type of
heaven: and he but once a year. The way to heaven was not so clearly
manifested then, as it is now, when Christ Jesus our forerunner is gone into
it before us and for us. The faithful then knew the way to heaven, and
immediately after death went to heaven; but they had not such a clear
knowledge of it as we have. This is probable.

The first Tabernacle as yet having his standing: whereby he does not mean the
first part of the Tabernacle, as he did before; but the whole Tabernacle: for
indeed it was but one, though divided into two parts; while the Tabernacle of
the Jews with all the rites and ceremonies belonging to it, was yet standing.

It is called the first in respect of Christ's body, which was the second
Tabernacle. It is the Holy Ghost that speaks in the Scripture, 2 Pet. 1. ult.
2 Timothy 3.16. Jacob said of Bethel, the Lord is in this place, and I was not
aware of it. So the Holy Ghost is in the Scripture, and we are not aware of it.
The Holy Ghost speaks in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, in the Psalms, in the
Prophets: he speaks in the Gospels, in the Epistles of St. Paul and St. Peter;
therefore when the Scripture is read, let us hear with all reverence, because
God Almighty speaks in them. No place of holy Scripture is idle, no not the
framing of the Tabernacle; the Holy Ghost thereby does signify to us many holy
mysteries in it: therefore let no portion of Scripture be lightly regarded by
us.

We know the way to heaven better than they did: therefore we should walk
more carefully and conscionably in it, then they did: our Lord and Savior, our
Head and Husband Christ Jesus is gone into heaven to prepare a place for us:
blessed are the eyes that see which we see. Therefore if we tread not in this
way, but rather take the way to hell, our condemnation shall be the greater at
the latter day. As God in mercy has opened the way to heaven more clearly to
us then to them: So let us be careful to take this way to the everlasting joy
and comfort of us all.

VERSE 9.
THis signification he does further prosecute. 1. Showing the use of that
Tabernacle. 2. The inabilitie of the service of it.

For the use, it was a figure, a parable. Which signifies both a dark speech,
Mat. 13.10. and a figurative speech, a similitude or likeness. Mark. 13.28.
Take a similitude from the fig tree: that tabernacle was a similitude of a
more excellent tabernacle to come, namely of the body of Christ V. 11. that is
illustrated by the time and the manner. It was to be a similitude but for the
time present, during the ceremonial Law: till the fulness of time came, that
Christ should come and be made of a woman.

The manner how it did prefigurate Christ; by certain gifts and sacrifices,
that were then offered.

Which were only figurativa, not exhibitiva: they did only figure out Christ by
whom we are made holy and perfect; but they could not make us holy. Concerning
the flesh and the outward man, they might purify them; but they could not
purify the soul and conscience.

(...), for (...). In the which time.

Are offered. Peradventure that Temple stood, when he wrote this Epistle;
therefore he uses the present tense: or he speaks according to the custom
of the time, when they were used.

Make holy, or perfect: the word signifies both.

Him that worshipped God by them: that by them performed divine service to God,
Hebr. 7.19.

These did only point at Christ, by whom we are made holy and perfect,
justified and sanctified by him, so as our consciences be at peace with God,
Hebr. 10.2. by the mere offering up of a Calfe, a Lamb, etc. Their consciences
could not be freed from the guilt and punishment of sin; our consciences are
pacified only by the sacrifice of Christ on the Cross, applied to us by faith,
which was prefigured by those sacrificers, Romans 5.1.

Conscience is a register, that keeperh a note of all our sins. Some times he
may be a sleep and say nothing: but at one time or other he will awake and
bring all our sins to our remembrance: then what shall we do, whither shall we
fly? Where shall we find comfort? As the sacrifices in the time of the Law
could not pacify the conscience: So it is not the hearing of a thousand
masses, the going in Pilgrimage to the holy land, it is not the building of
Churches, the giving of alms, (though these be excellent things, if they flow
from a true faith) it is not the cogitation of our works simply in themselves
without Christ Jesus that can quiet our consciences. Saint Paul in this sense
disclaimed his works. I desire to be found in him, not having mine own
righteousness which is of the Law; Phil. 3.9.
but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of
God by faith. It is only Christ Jesus, and the application of his sacrifice to
us by a lively faith, that can secure our consciences, and stay the rage of
them: being justified by faith we have peace with God: the blood of Christ
purges us from all sin. Therefore let us entreat the Lord to assure our
consciences upon good grounds that Christ is ours, that he has dyed for all
our sins, and that his righteousness is ours: then shall we have comfort of
conscience in all calamities, yea in death it self in this present life, and
shall triumph with Christ in the life to come.

VERSE 10.
THat they could not purge the Conscience, he evinceth by the nature and
quality of them.

No carnal, fleshly, or outward thing can cleanse the heart or conscience:
these are only Carnal rites and outward ceremonies: a carnal commandment
Hebr. 7.16. consisting of meats, drinks, etc. therefore they cannot pacify
the conscience: that is only the blood of Christ that purges us from all sin.

These are illustrated by the time of their continuance.

Imposed: as an heavy load and importable burden, Act. 15.10. whereof we are
now eased by Christ.

There is some question about the grammatical construction: because the
participle is of the accusative case plural, and cannot agree with any thing
that went before.

Some say it is an enallage of case, the accusative put for the dative.

Some will have it to agree with (...) in the first Verse: and all the rest to
be included within a parenthesis, as Iunius: but that should be a wonderful
long parenthesis.

Rather, something must be supplied, as it is usual: (...), that is, (...).

Of correction. Not as if any thing were amiss, simply evil in the
ceremonial Law. A reformation, properly to speak, is of abuses: there was no
fault, no abuses in the Law it self, it was a good and an holy thing for the
time; but it is said to be reformed by Christ, because he did perfect that,
which was wanting in the ceremonial Law: he actually introduced the
justification and sanctification of the faithful, which the ceremonial Law
could not effect of and by it self.

And it may be termed the time of reformation, because Christ abolished those
old Ceremonies and sacrifices, and brought better in their room: namely the
sacrifice of his own body once offered, which was a thousand times more
effectual for the redemption of mankind, then all the sacrifices in the Law.
This is that blessed reformation which the Gospel brings.

All things have their time. The Ceremonial Law had her time: and the Gospel
has his time. We our selves have but our time, some threescore years and
ten, and then we are gone. Let us use our time well here, that we may live
with Christ time out of time.

The Gospel is a time of reformation. Christ then reformed the Law for our
sakes, and all things that were in the Old Testament; old things are passed
away, and shall we our selves remain unreformed? As Christ has reformed the
Law for our salvation: so let us suffer him to reform us. Let all things now
be reformed among Christians. Let us reform our drunkenness, uncleanness,
pride, malice, contentions, our negligent coming to Sermons, and all other
vices that be among us: that when the great time of reformation comes at the
day of judgment, we being thus reformed may enter into the holy Jerusalem,
and remain with Christ for ever.

There is a formation, a deformation, and a reformation.

The formation was at the first Creation of the world: then God put all things
into a good form and order: he beheld all that he had made, and lo it was
good, yea exceeding good: after that came a deformation by the fall of man, and
that put all out of order again: upon that a reformation was made. 1. By a
general deluge that purged all the earth. 2. By the Patriarcks after the
flood. 3. By Moses, when the Law was published in writing. 4. By our Savior
Christ: and that is double; the one at his first coming; the other at the
second. The spirit of God here entreats of the first. So that the time of the
Gospel is the time of reformation. Now especially ought Christians to
endeavor a reformation. Every one will take on him to reform the Church:
Weavers and Tailors will enterprise that. The Church is out of order; let that
be reformed. I but true reformation must begin at our selves: there is a
ruinated house to be repaired and reformed, where will ye begin? at the top,
or at the bottom? will ye go to the tiling of it, before ye look to the
ground selling of it? if ye do so, you may quickly bring an old house on your
heads. He that will repair an house, must begin at the foundation: so if ye
will have a reformation, reform your selves first: and in the reformation of
your selves begin with the heart: cast out the unclean lusts, the pride, envy,
malice, covetousness, that lie lurking in the corners of your hearts;
afterward reform your eyes, tongues, hands, and all the members of your body:
first wash the inside of the Cup and platter, then the outside; else ye will
be but whited tombs and painted Sepulchers, as the Pharisees were: this is the
best order in reforming. First let every man strive to reform himself, the
vices whereunto himself is given. In the next place let him reform his
family: after that, let every one in his place labor to reform the Town,
wherein he dwells, to rid it of drunkards, of idle persons, to establish good
orders in it, for the credit of the Gospel professed by us. This is the time
of reformation, let us all in the fear of God reform our selves: there shall
not be a hair amiss in our head, but we will reform it: if we have a spotted
Coat or garment, we will reform it: and shall we our selves remain
unreformed? while the time of reformation lasts, let us reform our selves:
death may seize on us ere we be aware, and then it will be too late to
reform.

Let us reform our selves here, that we may be Citizens of the heavenly
Jerusalem hereafter.

Now follows the application of the type with all the particular branches of
the same. Wherein all of them are applied to our Savior Christ: he is the
mark at the which they all aimed, the scope, whereunto all must be referred:
he is the true High Priest prefigured by him in the time of the Law: his body
is the true Tabernacle, by the which he enters into the Holy of Holies: the
Sanctuary or holiest of all is heaven: his blood is the true blood shadowed out
by the blood of all the sacrifices in the time of the Law. Thus Christ is the
end of the whole ceremonial Law: it was but as a Schoolmaster to send us to
him.

But in this application to observe some order, that might be a light to us
all: in it two points are propounded to us.

1. An application of the Tabernacle, a Verse 11. to 21.

2. Of the rites belonging to it, a 21. ad finem. The Tabernacle is applied to
Christ.

1. As he is a Priest reconciling us to God, ab 11. to 15.

2. As he is a testator making a gracious Will and Testament for us, a 15. to
21.

1. The dignity of his Priesthood.

2. A confirmation of it, Verse 13. the dignity is set forth by the object,
Tabernacle, Sacrifice.

In the application of the Tabernacle as he is a Priest, there be three points.

1. The verity and truth of the Tabernacle. 2. The service of it. 3. The use
and end of it.
VERSE 11.
BBeing come, far excelling all the Highpriests in the time of the Law. To
us, in the flesh, manifesting himself to the world: he was an High Priest in
Gods eternal counsel from the beginning; but now at his first coming into
the world he showed himself in all his Spiritual pontificalibus to be an
High Priest.

Of what? not of things present and before their eyes, as they were, Verse 9.
but of things to come shadowed out by them, Hebr. 10.1. of Justification,
Sanctification, and eternal Glorification in the life to come: of these good
things to come were the ceremonies of the Law shadows. Not of bad things: he
is no High Priest of evil things, as Annas and Caiphas were; but of good
things, that is of most excellent things; the positive being put for the
superlative. A good work, that is a worthy work: he that finds a Wife,
finds a good thing, that is, an excellent thing.

Some think that by the first Tabernacle was signified the militant Church; as
by the second the Church triumphant. Christ by the Church militant gathered by
God, not by man entered into heaven: all went into heaven by the Church
militant. Some more special thing is here avouched of Christ. Some again by
it understand Heaven: but that cannot be; for then by Heaven he should enter
into heaven, for V. 24. the Holy of Holies is expounded to be heaven.

But rather by this tabernacle was signified the body of Christ. As the
High Priest came into the first Tabernacle, and by it passed into the Holy
place: So the deity of our SAVIOR CHRIST came into his sacred humanity, and by
it entered into heaven. Thus is CHRIST's body compared unto a Temple, Ioh. 2.
and to the veil, Heb. 10.20. As God dwelt in that Tabernacle of the Jews* so
the deity dwelt in Christ's humanity bodily.

This Tabernacle is illustrated by the adjuncts and the efficient cause: the
adjuncts are two. 1. A greater: not in quantity, but in quality; as the King is
greater than any in the Realm, that is, more worthy. Christ was greater than
Solomon, not in stature or bigness of body, but in excellency: the greatest of
these is love, that is, the chiefest. So Christ's body was a greater, that is a
far more excellent Tabernacle.

That was perfect in his kind, being finished according to GODS direction; but
this is more perfect: that could perfect nothing touching our salvation, but
only shadowed out things to come; by and in this Tabernacle was perfected the
work of our redemption, consummatum est.

The efficient cause is set down negatively, whereby the affirmative part may
be easily collected.

Of men: not of the like structure and fabric that the other Tabernacle was:
that Tabernacle was made by the hands of Aholia^ and Bezaleel; this Tabernacle
of Christ's body was made by the hands of the Holy Ghost, Hebr. 8.2. that
Tabernacle was made of Wood, Gold, Silver, hair, etc. this Tabernacle of
Christ's body was made of the flesh of the Virgin, not by the copulation of a
man, but by the shadowing of the Holy Ghost: a Tabernacle far more glorious
than that was.

There ye have the truth of the Tabernacle.

A thing come is better than that, which is to come. A child come into the
world is more acceptable then one to come: a feast, come, then one to come.
CHRIST was to come in the time of the Law: now he is come. Let us receive him
with joy, as old father Simeon did.

He is not a laick, but a Priest; not an inferior, but an High Priest.

All were subject to the High Priest in the time of the Law: and let us submit
our selves to Christ our High Priest, in the time of the Gospel.

Here we may see what they be, that in truth deserve the name and title of good
things. Not silver and gold, houses and lands, Sheep, and Oxen, fair houses,
large lands and ample possessions. CHRIST at his coming brought none of these,
yet he brought good things with him: namely, remission of sins, the glorious
robe of his own righteousness to cover us withal, faith and other graces of
the spirit, and habitation in his own kingdom in the life to come: these
indeed are worthy the name of good things. Projicimus nomen boni; Seneca: when
we adscribe it to these inferior things. Why call thou me good, says
Christ to the young man? So why do we call these earthly and transitory things
good? The only good things are the spiritual blessings that Christ brings.
The greatest sort crave worldly goods: but let us entreat the Lord to fill our
storehouse with these good things. The Philosophers made three kinds of good
things: bona animi, as wit and wisdom, learning: bona corporis, as beauty,
strength: bona fortunae, as riches, honors, etc. to speak the truth, none of
them all are good things: they be good things that can make the parties good
that have them: these do not. Esau had a good wit, could readily descant on
Jacobs name: yet he was no good man. Julian the Apostata had great variety of
learning, yet a vile man. Haman had great honor, his throne exalted above all,
yet he a wicked man. Og King of Bashan had strength, Ahsalom beauty, yet evil
men.

Health is a good thing. A man may come to Church, hear service and Sermons,
which he cannot when he is sick. Wealth is good. A man may be liberal to all
good uses, laying up a good foundation against the time to come: but these are
not worthy to be named with those, which we have in Christ.

Therefore let us desire those good things that can make us good, to engraft us
into Christ, in this life, and make us heirs of his kingdom in the life to
come.

For So Much as our Priest brings such excellent things with him, let him be
most welcome to us. David said of Ahimaaz, he is a good man, and brings good
tidings: much more let us say of Christ our High Priest, he is a good man, he
brings good tidings, that by the blood of his Cross he has reconciled us to
God the Father, has obtained a general pardon for all our sins, he has
prepared a place for us in his own kingdom: therefore let us receive him with
all joy. The High Priest in the time of the Law could bring no such good news,
he only came with the blood of a Goat, Bullock, etc. That was a
representation of the blood of CHRIST. The Pope that challenges to himself
the title of an High Priest in the time of the Gospel, sends forth his
pardons, and indulgences: but they are little worth, they cannot free us from
one sin: it is Christ alone, that is the messenger and author of all good
things to us: therefore let us skip for joy at his coming, and embrace him
with both arms.

As Christ's body is a Tabernacle: So is ours, 2 Pet. 1.14. 2 Cor. 5.1.

1. The name of a tent or Tabernacle imports a warfare: Soldiers have their
tents. Abraham, Isaac dwelt in tents: the Jews had the feast of Tabernacles.
We fight against Satan and his instruments in the tents of our bodies.

2. There is a difference between a Tabernacle, and an house: for an house is
made of solid matter, Wood, Stone, etc. A Tent is made of old clothes patched
together, so our bodies are not made of the Sun, of the Stars, of the
firmament, but of the earth which is a brittle thing.

3. A Tent is weak, easily pierced through; so our body: a knife, a pin may
prick it, a fly may choke it.

A Tent is quickly up, and quickly down: So is our body: we come suddenly,
and we are gone again in the turning of an hand: though it be the body of a
Wise Solomon, (...) a strong Sampson, a fair Absalom, yet remember, it is but
a tent or Tabernacle: the time is at hand, says Saint Peter, when I must lay
down this Tabernacle.

We know not how soon our bodies may be laid in the dust: therefore let us
not be too much in love with them.

Now as the Tabernacle in the time of the Law was kept neat, clean, and
handsome, it might not be polluted with any thing: So let us keep our bodies
from all pollutions. Let us not defile these our Tabernacles with drunkenness,
fornication, adultery, pride, covetousness; but let us reserve them as holy
and undefiled for the Lord.

VERSE 12.
NOw to the service, which is likewise applied to our Savior Christ: where,

1. What it is. 2. Where offered. 3. The efficacy of it.

There the High Priest by the blood of Goats and Calves went into the holy
place: here our High Priest goes into heaven by his own blood: therefore this
service excels that.

When the High Priest went into the Holy of Holies, he was to offer up a
bullock for his own sins, and a Goat for the sins of the people: here he
uses the plural number, because they were iterated every year.

The High Priest went in by other blood, Christ by his own blood. It was an
easy matter for him to take the blood of a young bullock and of a Goat, it
cost him no great pain: but our High Priest was feign to shed his own blood,
before he could enter into heaven.

He went once every year into the Holy of Holies: CHRIST went once for all
into heaven, and there he remains till the day of judgment.

Where we have a notable argument against his carnal presence in the last
supper. If Christ in respect of his body were here present, so often as the
supper is celebrated, then he should come and go into heaven often: but he
went once into heaven; and there must be, till all things be restored, Act. 3.
Therefore he is not here on the earth bodily: so often as the supper is ministered.

The third thing in the Tabernacle was the use of the service, that was in it:
that was only to shadow out our redemption to be accomplished by Christ: but
this our High Priest being gone into heaven by the Tabernacle of his own body,
and by his own blood, has indeed wrought the work of our redemption.

With much sweat and labor: our redemption cost him dear. In the Greek
having found out: a rare pearl and invaluable Jewel not found before: yet it
does also signify acquirere, idque labor nostro.

(...) Satan, hell: in whose bondage and slavery we were.

Not a temporal redemption, as a man may be rescued from his enemies and fall
into their hands again; but an eternal one: so as we are delivered from them
for ever.

These words ( for us) are not in the Greek: yet they are well supplied: for
Christ obtained no redemption for himself: he was never in bondage to sin and
Satan: therefore he could not be redeemed. Though Bellarmine defend, that Christ
merited the glory of his body, and the exaltation of his name for himself: yet
no redemption.

Our SAVIOR CHRIST by the one sacrifice of his own blood has obtained
eternal redemption for us: therefore there needs no more sacrifice for our
redemption. Then away with the sacrifice of the mass, which is propitiatory
for the quick and the dead. For the Papists held it in time past, but being
forced to it by the light of Scripture, they let go that hold, and affirm
that it is only repraesentativum, commemorativum and applicativum of that
sacrifice on the Cross.

Bellarmine defends it to be a propitiatory sacrifice, and so does the
council of Trent. The Jesuits say, it is not that redeeming sacrifice for the
sins of the whole world, yet it may avail for the remission of some
particular sins, with a relation to that redeeming sacrifice on the Cross.
They say it is the same with that on the Cross: it differs only modo: that is,
a bloody sacrifice; this an unbloudy.

I but all the legal sacrifices instituted by God must cease after the
oblation of this sacrifice, whereby eternal redemption is obtained for us:
then this new forged sacrifice of the mass being a bird of their own hatching
must cease.

And howsoever they minse it, affirming that it is but a commemoration and an
application: yet they hold still that it is propitiatory for sin, as if a full
propitiation was not made by Christ's sacrifice on the Cross.

Their opinion is this: that it is not that redeeming sacrifice on the Cross:
that could not be often done, because Christ could not dye often; yet by being
a commemoration of that sacrifice, and an application of it to us, it does
obtain remission of sins, and is a propitiation for sin, it is propitiatorium
and impetratorium still.

Propitiatory for the sins of them that be present, and of them that be
absent, alive and dead: impetratory, because it obtains not only spiritual
benefits, but also temporal. So that this is the issue. The Sacrifice of the
mass is not that general redeeming sacrifice that was offered on the Cross,
yet being a commemoration and an application of it, it is propitiatory for the
sins which we daily commit. So says the Counsel of Trent.

1. Under the genus all the species are comprehended: if that was a general
redeeming sacrifice taking away the sins of the world, then it left no sin
untaken away. They speak contraries. If by that we have a general pardon of
all sins, then there is no special pardon for sins in the sacrifice of the
Mass, Col. 1.20.

2. Was that sufficient to propitiate for sins, or insufficient? Surely they
will say sufficient: therefore there is no need of any help from the sacrifice
of the mass.

Again it is not propitiatory. 1 Pet. 2.24. makes much against this
propitiatory sacrifice.

1. Not by a Priest, but by himself. 2. In his own body: not in the
commemorative or applicatory sacrifice of his body. 3. He left none hereafter
to be taken away. 4. All our sins. Where? on the Cross; not on any Altar,
where a commemoration should be made of his sacrifice on the Cross, but on
the Cross it self.
The Idolaters offered the blood of their Sons and Daughters to their Idols,
but they would not offer their own: Christ has entered into the holy place
with his own blood, by his own stripes we are healed: in his own body he
bare our sins, by his own blood he made a way into heaven for us: he gave not
the blood of any of his servants, but his own blood. Oh how are we beholden
to CHRIST, that spared not his own blood for us? The love of Christ should
constrain us. 1 Pet. 2.18.
We are redeemed, says Peter, not with corruptible things, as silver and gold,
but with the precious blood of CHRIST, as of a Lamb undefiled: we are bought
with a price, and that a dear price, even the blood of the Son of GOD. Our
swearing, drunkenness, etc. these cost the blood of the Son of GOD: we are
washed from them in the blood of Christ; and shall we wallow in them? 2 Samuel
23.17.
is not this the water, said David, for the which three worthy men ventured
their lives? he would not drink of it, though very thirsty. So when we are
provoked to sin, to drunkenness, covetousness, adultery; let us reason with
our selves. Indeed the water of these sins is sweet, but did it not cost the
blood of CHRIST? therefore away with it: we think sin to be nothing; yet all the
Martyrs on the earth, all the Angels in heaven could not have freed us from
sin. 1 Cor. 6. ult.
The Son of God must shed his blood for it: therefore let the consideration
hereof be a perpetual bridle to restrain us from sin.

CHRIST 's blood is the price of our redemption: he sweat drops of blood, when
he was in his agony in the garden: at the commandment of Pilat he was
extremely whipped, so that the blood came exceedingly out of his holy body: he
had a Crown of thorns platted on his head, that made the blood run about
his ears: being nailed hand and foot to the Cross, the blood came out in
great measure: a Soldier thrust him through with a spear, and out of his side
came water and blood: So that this our High Priest redeemed us not with the
blood of beasts, but with his own blood.

How then are we to love CHRIST JESUS, that spared not his heart blood for us?
There was no blood almost left in this immaculate Lamb, he spent all for our
sake. We will love them that give their money for us: and shall we not love
CHRIST that gave his blood for us? yet the love of Christ is not so deeply
fixed in us as it ought to be. We love the trash of the world, the pleasures
of the flesh above Christ. This love of Christ should constrain us to forsake
our sins. Will thou make much of the knife that cut the throat of thy friend
or father? Sin was the knife that cut CHRIST 's throat: therefore let us
hurl it away: but this blood of CHRIST, by the which we are washed from our
sins, is little regarded: for all that, we wallow in the mire of our sins
forgetting the LORD that bought us, as Saint Peter speaks. We are redeemed
from our drunkenness, covetousness, pride, etc. by the blood of CHRIST:
therefore let us have no fellowship with these sins.

2. Heaven is an holy place: there dwells the holy God: there be the holy
Angels and holy Saints: they that remain unholy shall never enter into it:
dogs enchanters, etc. are without. By nature we are all unholy, borne in sin,
conceived in iniquity, Isai. 5.18.
pulling sin to us with Cartropes, and iniquity with Cords of vanity: but we
are made holy by the spirit of Sanctification. Such were some of you,
drunkards, etc. but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are
justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God, 1 Cor.
6.11. They that continue in sin without repentance, shall never set a foot
into the kingdom of heaven. Noah was once overtaken with Wine: but he forsook
that sin. David fell into adultery, but he washed it away with his tears.
Peter denied Christ: but he wept bitterly for it. Manasseh left his idolatry,
Paul his persecuting of the Church of God, Mary Magdalen her uncleanness: even
so, if through the corruption of our nature we have been carried into any
sin; let us by repentance rise up out of it again. Let us strive to be holy in
this world, holy in heart, in conversation, that we may enter into the holy
Jerusalem in the world to come. Hebr. 12.14.
Follow peace and holiness, without which none can see God. The wicked mock
at them, that be holy; I but except ye likewise be holy, ye shall never reign
with Christ in the Holy Jerusalem.

3. By CHRIST we have a plenary redemption of soul and body out of the claws
of Satan. As the Bird is in the fowlers net: so were we in the Devils snare:
but we may say with them in the Psalm, the net is broken, and we are
delivered: yea, we are delivered eternally, we shall never fall into that
bondage again. The afflictions, whereunto we are incident in this life, are
temporal; but the redemption is eternal: sickness, poverty, malevolent
tongues, imprisonment, death it self is temporal: our joy is eternal. Let
that comfort us in all the calamities of this life. A burning agew, the
toothache, the stone lasts not always: but my joy in heaven shall be eternal:
here I may be in grief for a time, but there I shall reign with Christ for
ever.

We love them, that obtain a temporal redemption for us. If a young man be
bound Prentise to an hard master for ten or twelve years, and if one should
buy out his apprentiseship and set him free; would he not take himself much
beholding to him? We were bound Prentises to Satan: he kept us in his snare
at his will and pleasure; being his bond men we should have remained in hell
fire world without end. Now Christ Jesus has redeemed us, and made us the free
men of God, Citizens of heaven; how are we indebted to him?

If thou were a Gallislave under the Turk, and one should rid thee out of it;
were thou not much obliged to him? Christ has brought us out of the gally of
sin and damnation: therefore let us sound forth his praises all the days of
our life.

Let us say with them in the Revelation: worthy is the Lamb that was killed,
Apoc. 5.12.
and has obtained eternal redemption for us: to receive all honor, and
glory, and blessing for ever and ever.

VERSE 13.
THat Christ by the shedding of his own blood has obtained an eternal
redemption for us, is confirmed by an argument a pari and a minore: from the
sacrifices of the Law, to the sacrifice of Christ.

1. What they were. 2. What was the fruit and effect of them.
If the blood of Bulls, and goats, etc. being an outward thing could sanctify
the flesh, that was an outward thing: then the blood of Christ being a
spiritual thing, in force and power everlasting must needs sanctify the
conscience, which is a spiritual and internal thing: yea this rather than
that, for many respects, as we shall see: but the one: ergo the other.

The Protasis is in this 13. Verse.

Because he would enwrap the whole Ceremonial Law, he reckons up other
sacrifices and rites, then those which the High Priest used; when he went into
the Holy of Holies, 1 Chronicles. 29. Verse 21.

Among the rest he makes mention of one solemn ceremony whereunto the Jews
adscribed much, Number. 19.1. A Red Cow was commanded to be taken, which was
without spot, and never accustomed to the yoke: she was to be burnt to ashes:
of that ashes a certain water was to be made, which being sprinkled on them
that were unclean, by the touching of a dead body, etc. it did sanctify them,
and made them capable of the Tabernacle; being purified by that water, they
might go with the rest of the people into the place of Gods worship.

This Cow was a type of Christ.

1. As she was Red: So was he dyed red in his own blood. 2. As she was
without spot, or scab, or any disease: So Christ was without the spot of sin.
3. As she was never used to the yoke: no more was Christ to the yoke and
servitude of sin. 4. As she dyed, so Christ. Therefore if the water made of her
ashes was precious: much more the blood of Christ sprinkled on our
consciences.
In the proof of this he does not insist, because it was confessed by the
Jews.

So I think holy water may sanctify touching the purity of the flesh.

If a man have dirt on his face, when he is about to enter into the Church,
their holy water may take it away: but it cannot help for any spiritual
thing, to scare away Devils, or to put away venial sins.

VERSE 14.
THerefore he proceeds to the Apodosis. Where, 1. The sacrifice of Christ. 2.
The end of it.

Not equally, but much more.

Then the blood of a beast.

The which he illustrateth by diverse circumstances.

1. By the Person that offered this blood: he was Sacerdos and victima.

2. By the Party or power by the which he offered it.

Some by the eternal Spirit understand the Holy Ghost: as by him he was
conceived in the Virgins womb, by him lead into the wilderness to be
tempted, Mat. 4.1. So through his assistance he offered up himself: but by the
eternal Spirit is rather meant, the eternal deity of our Savior Christ, 1
Pet. 3.18, 19. As he was man consisting of flesh and blood: So he was also
God, an eternal and incomprehensible spirit.

From this his infinite and unspeakeable deity the blood of CHRIST received a
power to make satisfaction for our sins. Whereupon it is called the blood of
God, Acts 20.28. The blood of none that was a mere man could do it: if CHRIST
's blood had not been offered up by his eternal spirit, it could not have
purchased our redemption. The blood of Martyrs was offered up by the assistance
of the HOLY GHOST: yet it was not meritorious: it was not that, but the power
of the deity, that made Christ's blood meritorious.

3. By the thing offered: not any brute Creature, not a man, an Angel, but
Himself.

4. By the quality of the thing offered: even in respect of his humanity: and
for that cause his blood was more forcible.

5. To whom: to God. As a full satisfaction for the sins of the world.

Then he comes to the efficacy of the blood of Christ, deduced out of the
former: the blood of Goats and Bulls did purge the flesh and outward man: this
the conscience and inward man.

In some Greek copies it is (...), our consciences: All stand in need of
purging.

We have a double benefit by the blood of Christ: justification and
sanctification from dead works, that is, sins. Now from these dead works that
lay as an heavy load on our consciences, the blood of Christ purges us.

Sins are called dead works.

1. Because they come from dead men, 1 Timothy 5. Verse 6. Ephesians. 2. Verse 1. 2.
Because they engender death, Romans 6. ult.
The blood of CHRIST purges our consciences from all sins: so as our
consciences cannot accuse and condemn us for sin, because it is washed away
in the blood of CHRIST, Hebr. 10.2. Romans 8.1.

The second fruit issuing from the former is our sanctification: that being
thus justified, we may be sanctified in soul and body to serve the living
God, Luke 1.74.

He is styled the living God.

1. Because he lives of himself, and that for ever. 2. Because he makes us by
his spirit to live a spiritual life in this world. 3. Because he will raise
us up from a corporal death at the latter day, and cause us to live with him
for ever in the world to come.
1. Grievous is the sting of Conscience. This chest worm gnaweth sore: this
made Judas to cry out, I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. This made
Joseph's brethren to condemn themselves, when no man laid any thing to their
charge: verily we have sinned, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, Genesis
42.21.
when he besought us, and we would not hear. This made those John 8. that
seemed holy men to the eye of the world, to depart out of the Temple one by
one, being convicted of their own consciences. This was truly said to be mill
testes. Now how shall we stop the mouth of these thousand witnesses? We are
all miserable sinners, our consciences accuse us of innumerable sins: but
here is our comfort, the blood of Christ sprinkled on our consciences, purges
us from all sin: being justified by faith we have peace with God. Who shall
lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? it is CHRIST that has dyed, yea
rather that is risen again, that with his own blood has entered into the holy
place, and has made an eternal expiation of our sins. Let us all entreat
the Lord to apply the force of this blood to our consciences daily more and
more.

2. There be living works, a reverent using of the name of GOD, a cheerful
and reverent hearing of his word; temperance, chastity, sobriety, liberality,
etc. these come from us, when we live by faith in the Son of GOD: there be
also dead works, blasphemy, swearing, lying, covetousness, pride,
oppression, envy, hatred, malice; and these are to be abhorred of us all.

1. Dead things stincke. If we meet with a dead carcass by the way, we hold
our noses: even so sins, blasphemy, prophanations, pride, envy, hatred,
malice, covetousness; these stincke in the nostrills of God Almighty:
therefore let them be detested by us.

2. Dead men are forgotten. I am as a dead man out of mind. So let not our
minds run on these dead works, on the profits of the world, the pleasures of
the flesh: let these dead things be no more remembered.

3. That which is dead must be buried: give me a place to bury my dead out of
my sight, as Abraham said to the sons of Heth, Genesis 23.4. Idolatry, blasphemy,
all sins, are dead things, therefore let them be buried.

4. Dead things are abhorred of us. We shun dead things by the way, we will not
come near them: so let these dead works be abhorred of us. We decline those
things that be deadly: we will drink no poison, because it will kill us; we
will not go where the plague is, least we dye. All sins are deadly: they will
bring us to everlasting death: therefore beware of them. If we meet with a
dead body by the way, we decline it: yet the savor that comes from it can but
kill our bodies: the filthy stincke that issues out of these dead carcasses of
sin will kill both body and soul: therefore let them be detested by us.

These dead works of sin will poison us all: therefore have nothing to do
with them, as we love our life, which is most dear to us all: skin for skin,
and all that a man has will he give for his life: so let us avoid these dead
works that deprive us of eternal life in the world to come.

5. Dead things are heavy: a dead man. So these lie heavy on our consciences.
Caine, Judas: they were not able to bear that intolerable burden.

Sins may very well be termed dead works.

1. Laedunt vitam naturae: they make our natural life more unpleasant to us:
in the end they cut the thread of it; for the wages of sin is death: if we
had never sinned against God, we should never have dyed.

2. Carent vita gratiae: So long as we are dead in our sins, we are out of the
favor of God.

3. Auferunt vitam gloriae: they deprive us of the kingdom of heaven in the
life to come: therefore they are worthily termed dead works.

Thirdly, the end of our redemption is to serve God: we are redeemed from our
old conversation, not to our old conversation: we are bought with the blood of
Christ, not to serve the Devil, our selves, the flesh, the world: we have
served them too much already: but from henceforth we must serve God.

And how must we serve him?

1. Integraliter, in soul and body: not in body alone, as hypocrites do, that
draw near to GOD with their lips, but their hearts are far from him: nor
in soul alone, as some fearful Christians do, which say they have a good
heart to Godward, and yet give their bodies to the service of the Devil. As
God by Jesus Christ has redeemed both soul and body: so we must glorify him
with them both.

2. We must serve God peculiariter: him and him alone. I am a jealous God.
Thou shall have no other Gods besides me. We must not make our belly our God,
as Epicures do: our money our God, as covetous misers do: but we must serve
God alone: he must have all our service, Matthew. 4.10.

3. Perseveranter. not a while, but continually, to our lives end: be
faithful to the end, and I will give thee the Crown of life. If we persevere
not in his service to our dying day, we shall loose our reward.

4. Totaliter: all the time of our whole life. We must serve him, not only
when we be old, dry and withered; but in our fresh and flourishing years:
we must bear the yoke of the LORD, when we are young: he must have the
first fruits of our service.

But alas! though we profess that we are redeemed by CHRIST: yet we serve
our own lusts and affections: we serve not the living GOD, as we ought to
do. Let us have a care to serve the living GOD in this short and transitory
world, that we may live eternally with this everliving GOD in the world to come.

There is no fishing to the Sea: no service to the Kings: nor no service to the
King of Kings.

1. Some Masters are poor, and cannot reward their servants: our master is
rich, heaven and earth are his. Hester though a poor maid: yet because she
served him, he made her a Queen.

2. Some masters are churlish; and will not reward their servants, as Nabal
was: we have a kind and loving master: not the least service we do, if we
give but a cup of cold water in his name, but he will reward it.

3. Earthly Masters give but earthly rewards: they may give good wages, while
ye be with them, and peradventure bestow a farm on you: but our master will
give us a kingdom.

4. Earthly masters dye. Gentlemen, Knights, Noblemen dye: yea Kings themselves
dye: and then their servants seek abroad: but our master lives for ever.
Therefore let us serve him with all cheerfulness: let us serve him in this
life, and we shall enter into the joy of our Master. Will the Son of Iesse give
you all Vineyards? 1 Samuel 22.7.
Our Master will give us all a kingdom. We are servants here: we shall be
Kings there, have palms in our hands, and Crowns on our heads, and reign
with him for ever.

VERSE 15.
SEcondly the truth and substance of the Tabernacle is applied to Christ, as to
a testatour. Analysis.


Where, 1. The constitution of the Testament, Verse 15.

2. A confirmation of it.

In the constitution of it there be four circumstances.

1. The legatour. 2. The death of the testatour, that strengthens the
Testament. 3. The legatarie, every believer. 4. The legacy, an eternal
inheritance. The isntrumental cause, whereby we attain to our legacy, was
the death of Christ: which has a double use.

1. To purchase redemption for us as a Priest: we are redeemed by the blood of
Christ from the bonds of sins, wherewith we were tied by virtue of the former
Testament. 2. To ratify the covenant and Testament to us, as a Testatour: he
is a Priest in regard of God, making an atonement for us with his blood: he
is a Testatour in respect of us, bequeathing that to us, which he has bought
with his blood.

It is ratified by the death of the Testatour. Which is confirmed by two
arguments.

1. Iure humano, Verses 16.17.

2. Iure legali. Where, 1. A general assertion, Ver. 18. 2. A particular
explication of it, Verse 19.20.

Here may seem to be some contradictions.

1. There it is said, when Moses had read the book: here it is said, when he
had spoken every precept, that is appertaining to the book of the covenant. So
that there is no jarre, but a sweet harmony.

2. There is mention only of the blood of Beeves: here of Calves and Goats:
they are by a Synecdoche comprehended in the other.

3. There is nothing said of water, wool, and hysop: Number. 19.6.
but there he speaks of sprinkling, and these were used in all sprincklings.

4. It is not said that the book was sprinkled: but that may well be
collected, Verse 6. for having made an Altar, and set the book of the covenant
on it, with half of the blood he sprinkled the Altar and the book,
afterward he sprinkled the people too.

5. There it is said, this is the blood of the Testament, which God has made
with you: Here, which GOD commanded to be brought to you.

This in sense is all one: it was made according to the book, and being made
was brought to them comprised in the book, Exodus 24.9.

The force of the argument is this: the former Testament was confirmed with
blood, by the death of Calves, Goats, etc. therefore it was requisite, that the
latter Testament should be ratified with blood, namely by the death of Christ
the Testatour.

Because by his own blood he has purged our consciences: which the blood of
beasts could not do in the Law.

He, by whose means and mediation the New Testament is made.

There is no Mediator besides him: Mediator, quasi medius dator.

Of the New Testament: which is far different from the Old Covenant or
Testament, for it consists on better promises, Hebrews 8. ver. 6.

By the means of death: that death being, or coming between: for the
redeeming of us from the punishments due to the transgressions, and the price
wherewith he redeemed us from them, was his own blood.

If CHRIST his death does redeem us from all transgressions, then there needs
no sacrifices for sin after his death? Yes, say the Jesuits, one to be a
representation of that on the Cross. I but you say, that the sacrifice of the
Mass, and that on the Cross are all one in substance, differing only in the
form and manner. Now if Christ be really present in the Mass, how can the
Mass be a representation of him?

And that manner is opposite to the Scriptures: for the Scripture says, he is
only offered up with blood. Your unbloudy sacrifice is no sacrifice.

In the former covenant, whereas we for our part were not able to perform
that, which belonged to us; GOD performed his part, but we could not do ours.

It is unseasonable here to dispute, whether CHRIST delivered them that lived
in the time of the Law, for by the Old Testament is meant the Old Covenant, not
the time of the Old Testament. Therefore it is opposed to the New Testament. In
the Greek it is (...) not (...): as if it were, for the sins of them that were
under the Old Testament.

That they which are called; namely, effectually, as well internally by the
spirit, as externally by the word, 1 Cor. 1.2, 24. Romans 8.30.

Not only hear it, but receive it, namely by faith.

The promise. The full fruition whereof they should receive hereafter: in the
mean season the Holy Ghost is as a Seal and earnest penny of it, Ephesians. 1.13.
2 Cor. 1.22.

It is not a thing merited by our works: but a gracious inheritance promised
to us. CHRIST is the right and principal heir, Hebr. 1.2. we are secondary
heirs with him and by him, Romans 8.17.

Not a fading inheritance, as these be: but that lasts for ever.

CHRIST is the sole Mediator, 1 Timothy 2.5. Ioh. 16.23. Apoc. 8.3. Let us not
cry with those Idolaters, o Baal, hear us: but ask the Father in his Sons
name, and say, o CHRIST hear us. Who prevails more with the King, then the
Kings Son? Let us not leave the Son, and go to servants.

There is a double calling: the one external alone by the outward sound of the
word: the other external and internal too, not by the Trumpet of the Word
alone ringing in the ear, but by the voice of the Spirit also persuading the
heart and moving us to go to Christ.

Of this calling spoke our SAVIOR CHRIST; no man comes to me, except the
Father draw him, namely, by his spirit as well as by his word. Judas was
called: he was not a professor alone, but a Preacher of the Gospel. Simon
Magus was called: he believed and was baptized. Herod was called; Luke 8.13.
Hebr. 6.5.
he heard John Baptist sweetly, and did many things that he willed him. Sundry
at this day come to Church, hear Sermons, talk of Religion, that do not
answer Gods call. Therefore let us entreat the Lord to call us effectually by
his blessed Spirit, out of our sins, to holiness and newness of life.

If we be thus called, we shall receive the eternal inheritance, which CHRIST
has purchased for us. Let us be suitors to God, that he would make us
partakers of this calling, that makes an alteration of us, 1 Cor. 6.9, 11. If
we were Idolaters, as Manasseh; to call us out of our superstition and
idolatry: if persecutors, as Paul; to call us out of our persecuting: if we
are Adulterers, as David; to call us out of our uncleanness: if drunkards, out
of our drunkenness: if covetous oppressors, as Zacheus was; to call us out of
our oppression, and make us new Creatures in Christ Jesus.

It is not a purchase bought with the money of our own merits: but an
inheritance bequeathed to us by the last Will and Testament of our Savior
Christ, Luke 22.29. and I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my father has
appointed unto me.

The inheritances, that be in the world, seem fair and glorious: it is a
goodly thing to have the inheritance of a great Gentleman, of a Knight, Lord,
Earl, Duke; but a Kings inheritance surpasses all: yet these are but strawes
to this inheritance.

These inheritances may be taken from us, while we be here. Mephibosheth's
lands were given away to Tsibah, and Naboth lost his Vineyard, though it was
the inheritance of his fathers.

When Death comes, then we must forgo all, houses and lands, all that our
fathers left us: But this inheritance is eternal, we can never be deprived of
it, we shall enjoy it world without end. Therefore let us seek to have an
assurance of this inheritance in our hearts and consciences. If a man be sure
to be a Lords heir, though he is in misery, yet he will endure it: we are
sure to have an eternal inheritance by Christ; let us therefore abide
patiently the miseries of this short life.

VERSE 16.
THere must needs be carried, as a true and an infallible report: it must be
sure and certain, that the Testatour is dead. Where, 1. The axiom. 2. The
proof or illustration of it, Verse 17.


Here we see it was necessary CHRIST should dye. Ought not CHRIST to suffer
these things, and to enter into his glory, Luke 24 26. why? not because the
Devil would have it to be so: not that the rage and fury of the Pharisees
should be satisfied: not because Judas would: but because God the Father in
singular love to mankind had so ordained in his eternal counsel, and because
Christ was willing to dye for us. Can mankind be saved no otherwise but by my
death? then here am I, take me, I will dye for them: o the wonderful love of
Christ!

Here the Testatour would live still, if he might, and then the legataries
should never have their legacies: our testatour might have lived still, if he
would; being the Lord of life: yet that we might have our legacy, he would
dye! o unspeakable love! Let it be imprinted on our hearts, that it may
constrain us to leave all sins.

VERSE 17.
NOw follows the proof or illustration of the axiom.

A Testament is thus defined by Vlpianus: Est declaratio voluntatis nostrae de
eo, quod fieri volumus post mortem.

Is of force. Is firm.

After the Testatour is dead: both because he may alter it at his pleasure;
and the goods remain all still in the Testatours hands: it is testamentum
ambulatorium usque ad mortem.

The Testament of our SAVIOR CHRIST is a good Testament.

It is partly nuncupativum, as it was pronounced by himself, when he was
alive: Luke 22.29.
partly Scriptum, as it was after committed to writing by his Apostles.

The Testatour is Christ: the thing bequeathed is an inheritance: the
legataries are the faithful: the witnesses to it, are his Apostles, Act. 1.8.
The seals are the Sacraments: the exequutor is the HOLY GHOST, Ioh. 14.16.
which is CHRIST 's Vicar on the earth, a faithful exequutor, that will give us
our legacies to the full, and deprive us of nothing.

Our SAVIOR is dead: therefore his Testament is of force.

Object. If CHRIST 's Testament was of no force till his death, then how could
they in the time of the Law have remission of sins, and eternal life?

Sol. In seeing the day of Christ by the eye of faith, as Abraham did, it was
not in force complemento, till Christ dyed; acceptatione it was.

This eternal inheritance could not have come to us without the death of our
Savior Christ. If he had not dyed, we could never have had possession of
this inheritance: therefore how are we to love the Lord Jesus that has
ratified this inheritance to us by his blood? 2 Cor. 5.15.
Let the consideration of the death of Christ work a death to sin in us all:
that as he has dyed for us to procure this inheritance, so we may dye to sin
daily more and more.

Seeing the Testatour is dead, we may assure our selves of this inheritance
bequeathed to us by his will. It is a rule in Law, debts must be paid before
legacies: and oft-times under the color of paying debts, the legataries go
long without their legacies. It cannot be so here: our Savior Christ left no
debts to pay: he ought nothing: he departed clear with all men: therefore we
may be sure of our legacy. All the devils in the world cannot keep us from it.

VERSE 18.
DEdicated to God by certain Solemn rites and ceremonies. Hinc (...) the
feast of dedication, Ioh. 10.22.

Much less should the latter be ordained without blood.

VERSE 19.
TO the Law: as God required, Exodus 24.8.

Every precept being spoken by Moses.

Some think that all the people are said to be sprinkled, because the twelve
pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel were sprinkled.

Others think, that some few of the elders were sprinkled instead of all the
rest. Or ( all) may be put for a great part. In a manner all of them were
sprinkled.

VERSE 20.
YEt it was the blood of heifers or of Goats: but it is called the blood of
the testament, because by it was signified Christ his blood, which is the maker
of the Testament: to this did our Savior allude, Matthew. 26.28. this is the
blood of the New Testament which was shed for you.

Beza translates it, that God has commanded to you, as if it were (...), but
rather expound it, which God has commanded, subaudi, to be carried to you.

The blood of Calves and goats sprinkled on the people in the time of the
Law, 1 Pet. 2.1.
was a figure of Christ's blood sprinkled on our consciences.

Object. Here we may learn, say the Rhemists, that the Scripture contains
not all necessary truths; when neither the place, to the which the Apostle
alludeth, nor any other, does mention half these ceremonies: but he had them
by tradition.

Sol. I but all these are contained in the Scripture. The book was sprinkled
on the Altar, or at least with the respersion, that was cast on the people.

For the purple, wool and hysop, Levit. 14.51. there is the water too.

Ribera says, all these are necessarily collected: for there could be no
sprinckling without them.

Under the peace offerings, Exodus 24.5 are comprehended Goats, appointed to
peace offerings, as we may see, Levit. 3.12.

The meaning of these words is nothing else, but this is a significant token of
the blood of the New Testament, that is to be shed for your sins.

This blood sprinkled on the people was a significant type and figure of the
blood of our Savior Christ; whereby the New Testament is confirmed to us.

That was the blood of Goats and Heifers; this of Christ the immaculate Lamb
of God.

2. Moses was the sprinckler of that blood: the Holy Ghost is the sprinckler of
this.

3. That was sprinkled on the face or garments of the people: this on our
hearts and consciences.

4. The aspertorium, the sprinckling stick there was made of purple wool and
hysop: the aspertorium here is faith. With that does the Spirit or God
sprinckle on us the blood of Christ.

5. That sprinckling did but sanctify the outward man: this the hid man of the
heart.

6. The force and power of that sprinckling lasted but a while: the efficacy of
this sprinckling continues for ever.

Therefore let us all be desirous of this sprinckling.

As the Woman of Samaria said, Lord give me of that water: So let us say, LORD
sprinckle us with the blood of CHRIST continually. It is a comfortable thing
for a man to be sprinkled with sweet water: it is a sweet smell and refreshes
him: but nothing so sweet as the blood of CHRIST sprinkled on our souls and
consciences by faith. Let us desire the Lord to sprinckle this blood on us
daily more and more, that being washed with it we may be made fit for the
Holy Jerusalem, and remain with Christ for ever and ever.

Hebrews 9.21.
NOw follows an application of the rites and ceremonies belonging to the
Tabernacle. Analysis


1. A narration of them, Verse 21.22. 2. An accommodation of them. The rites
are two.

1. The rite of consecration or sanctification, Lev. 16.14, 16. 8, 15, 18.
Verse 21.22.


2. The rite of purification: some by fire, some by water, Number. 31.23. In all
things are comprehended also all persons.

An accommodation is made of these rites by the way of an antithesis or
opposition: whereof there be four members.

1. An application of the things, Verse 23. 2. Of the place, Verse 24. 3. Of
the actions, Verse 25.26. 4. Of the use, Verse 27.28.
The things are applied by way of opposition.

It was necessary, 23.
that the types of heavenly things should be purified with such external
things, for the purification of the flesh or outward man.

But, etc. The sacrifice of Christ is termed sacrifices in the plural number,
and yet is but one; because the fruit and efficacy of it is derived unto many:
So the wisdom of Christ is set forth by seven eyes: his power by seven
horns, Apoc. 5.6. The Holy Ghost being but one spirit, it is called seven
spirits, Apoc. 1.4.

The place is applied by way of opposition. 24.
1. In respect of the nature that was made with hands; this without.

2. Of the use or end: there the High Priest did appear before the Arc and
Mercy-seate, which were figures of Gods presence: here our High Priest appears
before GOD immediately without figures, for us.

The third is an application of the action or service: 25.
the dissimilitude whereof consists in three things.

1. There the High Priest went often into the holy place: here our High Priest
went into heaven but once.

2. He went with other blood: ours, with his own blood.

Analysis.
And that he should go but once with his own blood, he proves, ab
impossibili. If he should often have offered himself, he should often have
suffered: but he cannot dye or suffer often: therefore he cannot often offer
up himself.

3. There the High Priest by his sacrifice did signify the expiation of sins,
that was to be accomplished: our High Priest has appeared to put away sin:
which is amplified by the time when, and the instrument whereby.

27.
The 4th. is the application of the use. The use of the Leviticall Priesthood
was to shadow out our redemption to be wrought by Christ: the use of Christ's
Priesthood is, to procure to us eternal happiness.

Which is set forth by an antithesis between the common estate and condition
of men, and the grace we have by Christ.

The common estate of men consists in two things.

1. In death: then in judgment. These happen to all, and cannot be avoided.

28.
Both members are applied to Christ. 1. Death. 2. The judgment: where Christ's
second coming is described.

To man's once dying is opposed Christ's once dying; amplified by the final
cause. To the fearful judgment to come is opposed the second coming or
appearing of our Savior Christ: amplified. 1. By the persons to whom he shall
appear, with comfort. 2. By the manner how he shall appear, without sin: not
only in himself but in his members, in his body the Church; neither head nor
body shall then have any sin in them. 3. By the end.

VERSE 21.
Explication
THe consecration of the Tabernacle was with blood. Where, 1. The sprinckler. 2.
The things sprinkled. 3. Wherewith.

The sprinckler was Moses, which was Gods deputy: the things sprinkled were
the Tabernacle and the vessels of ministration, that is, wherewith they did
publicly serve and minister: that wherewith they were sprinkled was blood.

At the first dedication of the Tabernacle, it was anointed with oil: but
afterward, Levit. 8. it was sprinkled with blood. The Altar and all other
ministering vessels: Aaron and his sons themselves were sprinkled with blood.

All Christians are Gods Tabernacle, he dwells in us as in a Tabernacle and
Temple: we are likewise Gods ministering vessels to serve him. Therefore we
must be sprinkled with the blood of Christ Jesus, or else we cannot be
consecrated as an holy people to the Lord.

Likewise: as well as he did the people and the book.

VERSE 22.
THe second rite: no purgation could be made without blood. Almost:) 1. A
qualification. 2. An asseveration.

Saint Chrysostom and Theophylact refer it to the verb: all things are by
the Law almost purged with blood. Not wholly, but in part, almost: because the
blood of the beasts did but purge the flesh, not the heart and conscience. As
Agrippa said to Paul, almost thou perswadest me to be a Christian.

But by the grammatical construction it is rather to be referred to the noune
(...). Almost all things: for there were some things purged by water, some by
fire, Number. 31.23.

But howsoever some things might be purified without blood; yet there is no
remission, namely of sins, without blood.

Where then is the unbloudy sacrifice of the Mass? If there be no shedding of
blood in it (as they affirm, the bloody sacrifice was on the Cross, this of
the Mass is unbloudy) then it cannot be propitiatory for sins, as they contend.

Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa. c. 27. has three answers, or rather three cavills
against this place.

1. The Apostle here speaks de sacrificijs veteris legis.

But, 1. Then he would have used a verb of the time past, rather than of the
time present: he would have said (...), not (...).

2. He cannot speak of the sacrifices of the Old Law, but he must needs have
reference to CHRIST 's sacrifice prefigured by them.

Secondly, says Bellarmine, this is not to be understood, as if without
actual shedding of blood there could be no remission, but absque virtute,
without the power of shedding of blood there can be no remission. Now the power
of Christ's sacrifice on the Cross is applied to us in the Mass, and so by it
we have remission of sins.

I but, First, the sacrifice of the Mass does rather abolish the power of
Christ's Sacrifice on the Cross, then apply it to us: for if that were a full
and perfect sacrifice for sin; then there needs no other: the sacrifice of
the Mass is a blasphemous sacrifice robbing Christ of his honor.

2. Here it is said; without blood shedding, no remission: not, without the
power of blood shedding.

Bellar. saw he should be driven to this: therefore he has a third refuge.
In the Mass there is shedding blood. 1. Mystically, by a mystical
signification. 2. Really: for as the body of Christ is broken subspecie panis;
so under the form of Wine is his blood shed.

But if CHRIST 's blood be really shed so often as a Mass is said or sung,
then CHRIST suffers often. Certainly a man suffers, when his blood is shed:
but Verse 26. therefore in the Mass no shedding of blood, and for that cause
no remission of sins for the same.

2. Under the Vizzard ( sub specie) they may cover any thing.

In the Mass there is no propitiatory sacrifice offered up, that is most
certain.

That does plainly signify to us, that if CHRIST 's blood had not been shed
for us, we could never have had remission of sins. Then how are we beholden to
the Lord Jesus? There is a base fellow in the land that has committed high
treason; he must needs dye unless the Kings Son shed his blood for him. We
were vile wretches, dust and ashes, Traitors and rebels against God. If the Son
of God had not powered forth his blood for us, we should have been tormented in
hell for ever. CHRIST has bought us with his own blood! O the wonderful love
of CHRIST! remember, says Saint Peter, ye are redeemed from your old
conversation, not with silver and gold: but with the precious blood of Christ.
O that the consideration of this dear price were deeply imprinted in our
hearts! Being washed from sin in the blood of CHRIST, shall we tumble in the
mire of sin? Thou art washed from thy covetousness, pride, uncleanness,
drunkenness with the blood of CHRIST: and yet will thou wallow still in them?
We are bought with a price, we are not our own, we are CHRIST 's, he has
dearly paid for us: therefore let us glorify him in our spirits and bodies,
which be his.

VERSE 23.
IT was therefore necessary. 1. because God commanded it to be so. 2. Because
it was meet they should by these ceremonies be consecrated to God. 3. That
they might the better signify the things that were to come.

Patterns: such as did lively set before their eyes as by certain examples,
the things to come.

Of things in the heavens, that is, of the Church in the time of the Gospel:
that is called heaven, because the head of it is in heaven: and their
conversation is in heaven: the Church which is termed the kingdom of heaven,
should be purified with these, that is, with earthly things like to themselves.
They were earthly, and they ought to be purified with earthly things, the
ashes of an Heifer, the blood of Calves, Goats, etc.

But the heavenly things themselves, that be under the Gospel, which is a Gate
and entrance into the kingdom of heaven, the Church in the time of the
Gospel, the true Tabernacle and faithful Citizens of heaven, it was necessary
that these should be purified with better sacrifices above these: namely with
the sacrifice of Christ himself; else we could never have had any right to the
kingdom of heaven.

Christ's one sacrifice is here called by the name of many; because it is
compared with the many sacrifices in the Law, and opposed to them.

Not because there be many Mass- Sacrifices to represent this one sacrifice.

Here we see how we are advanced above them in the time of the Law: they had
the patterns, we the things patterned: they painted flowers; we the flowers
themselves: they the shadows; we the body: they the picture; we the man: they
the lineaments of the house; we the house it self. How are we beholden to God?
happy are the eyes that see what we see! O that we could walk worthy of them!

Better.) No comparison between them: no more than between the creatures and
the Creator. What are Bulls, Goats, Calves to the Son of God, that has
offered himself for us?

VERSE 24.
THe Holy of Holies was a type of heaven.

Not made with the hands of Aholiab and Bezaleel.

Which were antitypes: as it were pictures in wax, to represent this: a stamp
of this.

Into heaven it self, whereof that was a type, Act. 1.11.

Manifestly and openly.

Not for a little while, to go out again, as the High Priest did, when he had
prayed and sacrificed for the people: but now and continually.

Not for himself, but for us. By the demonstration of his own sacred body,
wherein he has suffered for us, to make intercession for us.

So long as Christ appears in heaven for us, our sins cannot appear in the
sight of God. Of themselves they cry up to heaven for vengeance: but Christ our
Advocate and High Priest is in heaven to answer for us. Indeed father they are
grievous sinners: but here am I, which in my own body have borne the burden of
their sins.

In the Courts here on earth men have Advocates and Proctours that appear for
them. Christ our Advocate appears in heaven for us: therefore we need not to
fear. Who shall lay any thing to the charge of GODS elect? It is CHRIST that
appears in heaven for us.

2. As he is gone into heaven: so we shall one day be in heaven with him. In
the time of the Law, the High Priest went into the Sanctum Sanctorum: but he
could carry none of the people with him.

Our High Priest will bring us all into the true Holy of Holies, the kingdom
of heaven. Father, Ioh. 17.24.
I will that they also whom thou have given me, be with me where I am. The
forerunner is gone before us, and we shall follow after: he himself has
told us that in his Fathers house there be many mansions: Ioh. 14.2.
and he is gone to prepare a place for us. What a dignity is this, that dust
and ashes should sit in the heavenly place with CHRIST? Let this comfort us
against all the crosses and calamities of this life. What though we be sick
many weeks together? What though we be pinched with poverty for a time in
this world and with soars, as Lazarus? etc. all these one day shall have an
end, and we shall be in heaven with Christ: have Palms in our hands, Crowns
on our heads, where all tears shall be wiped from our eyes for ever.

VERSE 25.
HHimselfe, Hebr. 1.3.

Often: as the High Priest offered often.

Every year: whereas Christ but once.

Other blood: of Goats, Calves, etc.

Let us remember that which St. Peter tells us: we are redeemed from our old
conversation -- we are washed from our sins by the blood of Christ: therefore
let us not wallow like swine in the dunghill of sin again.

VERSE 26.
BEcause there were sins in all ages of the world to be done away.

CHRIST 's death was prefigured from the beginning of the world: by the death
of Abel, by the oblation of Isaac, by the sacrifice of many beasts in the time
of the Law: yet he suffered but once.

Now: not in the precedent or future time: but now, in the fullness of time,
Gal. 4.4.

End of the world, 1 Cor. 10.11. 1 Ioh. 2.18. Hora. Though 1600 years and more
are passed since: yet a thousand years are but as a day with the Lord.

Has he been manifested, 1 Timothy 3.16. appeared in the nature of man truly,
like to us in all things, sin only excepted.

To the abolishing, so as hereafter it shall be of no force to accuse and
condemn us, or to shut us out of heaven. There is sin still remaining in us,
but the guilt and punishment thereof is put away: how? not by the sacrifice of
a Lamb, Goat, Calfe, etc. but by the sacrifice of himself.

Why did not GOD send CHRIST at the beginning of the world?

1. He would have sick man for a time to be humbled with the sight and
feeling of his disease: that the Physician might be more welcome, when he came.

2. He would have the prophesies concerning Christ to be fulfilled, before he
came.

A sharp and evident knife to cut the throat of the Mass withal.

If CHRIST be offered up in the sacrifice of the Mass, then he suffers at
every Mass: for there can be no offering of Christ without suffering: but he
suffers not, even in the judgment of the Papists: neither Bellarmine nor any
of them all can, though full of shifts, tell handsomely how to elude this
argument: for here their unbloudy sacrifice has a deadly wound. There can be
no oblation of Christ without the suffering of Christ.

The world then is not eternal, as some Philosophers dreamed: it had a
beginning, and it shall have an end: only GOD is without beginning and ending:
for the Angels themselves had a beginning.

If the end of the world was in the time of CHRIST and of his Apostles, then
now it must needs be at an end: now it lies a gasping, and is ready to yield
up her breath, that day is at hand, when the world shall pass away with a
noise -- Therefore why do we dote so much on the world? will thou sit
feasting and banqueting in a rotten house that is ready to fall on thy head?
Such an house is the world: therefore rather hasten to be out of it. The
wicked are called the men of this world: we that be the faithful are men of
another world: ye are not of the world, says our SAVIOR CHRIST: Ioh. 15.19.
yet for all that we are mere worldlings, following the pleasures and profits
of the world, seldom or never thinking of the joys of the world to come. Who
will serve a Master that is ready to dye? Such a one as cannot prefer thee?
the world has one foot already in the grave: therefore let us serve him no
longer.

CHRIST has not redeemed us by the blood of a Calfe, Ram, Sheep, etc. not
with the sacrifice of an Angel, of his mother, or any Saint; but by the
sacrifice of Himself: no other sacrifice could save us. Now as Christ in
wonderful love has sacrificed Himself for us: so let us offer up our selves
as an holy sacrifice to him.

VERSE 27.
Analysis.
THe application of the use is set forth by an elegant antithesis between the
cursed condition of men by nature, and the blessed condition of men by grace,
through CHRIST JESUS.

The lamentable condition of men by nature is double.

1. They must all dye: then, there remains a Judgment for them.

28.
Unto the common death of men is opposed the death of our Savior Christ, that
takes away the sins of the world. In regard whereof death cannot hurt the
faithful.

Unto the fearful judgment to come is opposed Christ's second coming,
amplified by the persons to whom he shall come, by the manner how, and the end
of his coming.

Explication
Laid up in Gods secret Counsel.

27.
Why? for sin: at what time so ever thou eatest, thou shall dye the death.

To all men. It, an indefinite proposition, is equivalent to an universal: Man
that is borne of a woman is but of a short time, etc. that is, every man.

Object. 1 Cor. 15.51.

Sol. That change shall be instar mortis.

Object. 2. Lazarus dyed twice.

That was extraordinary: ordinarily men dye but once.

But after this the judgment: immediately, without delay.

1. The particular: then the general.

Then there is no Purgatory: We have two purgatories in this life; the fire of
affliction, and the blood of Christ: then we need fear no purgatory after
this life.

Here we see an appointment, a decree, a sentence: wherein four circumstances
are to be observed.

1. By whom this appointment is made: namely by God Almighty: in whom there is
not a shadow of turning, and which is able to bring that to pass, which he
has appointed. What I have written, I have written, said Pilat, and would not
alter his writing: so what God has appointed, he has appointed, and he will
accomplish it. Men are mutable; they appoint and disappoint: it is not so with
God; has he said it, and shall he not do it? Therefore as sure as God is in
heaven, this appointment shall stand. Who at any time has resisted his will?
who can break his appointment?

2. What it is that is appointed? once to dye. What is death? properly to
speak, it is a separation of the soul from the body. Man was made with two
parts: the body of the dust of the ground; the soul breathed into him by God.
Life is a conjunction of these two: death is a separation of them. There is an
improper death, which is a change of these two conjoined still together, which
shall happen to them that be alive at the day of judgment: but the Apostle here
speaks of the proper death.

2. There is an extraordinary dying, and an ordinary. Some have dyed twice, as
Lazarus, and those that rose with Christ at his resurrection: but ordinarily it
is appointed to all men once to dye. It is not appointed to all to be rich,
wise, learned, but to dye.

3. Why was this appointment made? because of sin, Romans 5.12. at what time thou
eatest, thou shall dye the death. Sin is the cause of death. Then why should
we be in love with sin? We shun poison, because it will kill us,
drunkenness, adultery, swearing and other sins brought death into the world:
therefore let them be hated by us. Why are we afraid of the plague? because it
will kill us. Sin will kill both soul and body: therefore let us all be
afraid to sin.

4. The persons to whom this appointment is made, to men: to all men.

There is no man living but shall see death: it is appointed to Kings to dye:
to Dukes, Earls, Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, Merchants, Clothiers, Husbandmen,
to high and low, rich and poor, learned and unlearned. It is appointed to the
Ministers to dye, and to the people: to the Master, and servant: to the
Husband, and to the Wife. We read of a Woman that had seven Husbands, they all
dyed, and in the end the Woman dyed also. None can avoid the stroke of death:
the Physicians that cure others, at the length dye: contra vim mortis non est
medicamen in hortis: the godly dye; good Women bring forth with sorrow as well
as bad: so good men and women dye, as well as bad: as the faithful are sick
as well as the unfaithful; so also they dye as well as others.

Oh that this were carefully remembered by us, and that we would lay it close
to our hearts! We see our neighbors, Townsmen, one or other almost everyday
carried to the earth; yet we lay it not to heart: it works not in us a death
to sin: we follow the world with such earnestness, as if we should never leave
the world. Let us so live that we may dye in the LORD JESUS, rise again and
live with him for ever. When or where we shall dye, we cannot tell, that is in
Gods hands: but this is most certain, we shall dye, quocunque te verteris,
incerta omnia; sola mors certa. In all other things we may use a forte: forte
eris Dives, forte habebis liberos: but when we speak of death, we may put
forte under our girdles, and say, certe morieris.

If any should ask a reason why the godly should dye, seeing CHRIST has dyed
for them? the answer is easy: because CHRIST dyed to free them from death
eternal, not from the corporal death, which is imposed upon all, because all
have sinned: Christ has taken away the curse of the corporal death, but not
death it self: cogitur non obesse, sed non abesse: we are all sinners,
therefore we must all dye. Let us be careful to fear God while we be
alive, that we may not greatly fear death, whenever he shall come.

Death is a bitter cup: all of us in some sort fear to drink of it. CHRIST
feared it: and non est fortior miles quam Imperator: we fear it, as it is a
dissolution of nature: but let us not fear it after a slavish manner. Take
this sugar to sweeten this bitter Cup withal.

1. CHRIST has taken away the sting of it, 1 Cor. 18.57. thanks be to God
which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Death is a great Goliath, yet stripped of his armor: as a roaring Lion, yet
without jaws or paws* as an hissing Serpent, yet without a sting: the sting
of death is sin. Christ has taken away the sins of the world. In his own
body upon the tree he has borne the sins of us all: therefore let us not
fear death.

2. It is but a sleep. Lord, if he sleep, then shall he do well enough.

Men are refreshed after sleep: so we after death.

Apoc. 3.14, 13. There be two benefits which we shall receive by death.

Genesis 8.9.
1. We shall rest from our labors. Here we are like Noah's Dove, we can find
no rest either day or night: we shall rest from the works of our calling. Now
indeed, we are early up in the morning, sit up late at night, and eat the
bread of carfulness, all the day long, but then we shall rest from that
toiling and moiling: we shall rest from the works of piety and Religion. All
that we shall do then, will be to sing Hallelujahs to our blessed redeemer.
We shall rest from sin: we shall no longer cry out like tired Porters: Romans
7.24.
Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death? We
shall rest from all miseries and sicknesses, cry out no more, my head, my head,
nor complain of troubles in our selves, Wives, Children or servants.

We shall rest from weaknesses and infirmities. Now we eat, drink, sleep,
etc. but then we shall eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the
Paradise of God, and never hunger or thirst any more.

2. Their works follow them: our labor is not in vain in the Lord. The alms
of Cornelius, the garments of Dorcas, the Centurions Synagogue, a Cup of cold
water given in CHRIST 's name shall be rewarded: so that we may sing like a
Swanne before our death, as St. Paul did, 2 Timothy 4.8. henceforth there is laid
up for me a Crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall
give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto them also that love his
appearing.

4. Comfort against death is a glorious resurrection, Job 19.25, 26.27. Phil.
3. ult. Our vile bodies shall be changed, and made like unto Christ's glorious
body. Our bodies putrify in the earth: yet there is not an end of them. We
have praeludia in the Old and New Testament: the Widow of Sareptas Son raised
up by Elias, the Son of the Shunamitish Woman by Elisha. In the New Testament
Christ raised up three; the one in domo, Iairus daughter: the other in feretro,
on the Bear, the Widows Son of Naim; the third in Sepulchro, that was
Lazarus which had lain four days and began to stincke; all which are pledges
of our resurrection. The same God, that raised them up, will raise us up at the
last day.

Death goes not alone, there is one that follows her, and that is judgment.

Judgment: either of absolution for the godly: come ye blessed of my Father;
or of condemnation for the wicked, go ye cursed into, etc.

If there were no judgment after death, the godly of all others were most
miserable: and if no judgment, the ungodly were the happiest men.

But let us know that after death comes a judgment, one way or other,
salvation or damnation. 2 Cor. 5.10.
We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, etc. The drunkard
must give an account of his drunkenness: the covetous man how he has employed
his riches: we must give an account of our oppressions, thefts secret or open:
of our negligent coming to Church and contempt of the Word of God. Let this
cause us with a narrow eye to look into our lives, let us judge our selves in
this world, that we be not condemned hereafter. Yet there be a number in the
Church that think it a scare Crow, and make a mock at this judgment, as the
Athenians did at the resurrection, Acts 17.32. they will believe the Assizes at
Bury and in other places, but count this a tale of a tub. Felix though a wicked
man, trembled at it. Let us all tremble at the naming of this judgment. Let it
be a means to pull us from sin, and to make our peace with God in this world,
that we may stand without trembling before the Son of man.

Judgment follows upon the neck of death: either come thou blessed, or go
thou cursed. The good thief the same day he dyed, was with Christ in Paradise;
that was his judgment, the rich man, the same day he dyed, was in hell in
torments, that was his judgment.

Wherefore, whilst we have time, let us repent; while God gives us a
breathing time on the face of the earth: for when death comes, it is too
late: then there is no mercy, but judgment to be expected. While we be alive,
Christ knocks at the door of our hearts with the hammer of his Word: if we
will open to him, he will sup with us, and we shall sup with him in the
kingdom of glory: but if now we shut him out, and will not suffer him to
enter, he will shut us out, and though we cry Lord, Lord, with the foolish
Virgins, he will not open to us.

VERSE 28.
AT the which offering he dyed.

To take away; not existentiam peccati: but reatum, dominium, and paenam.

Of many, Matthew. 26.28. he dyed for all sufficienter.

What is CHRIST dead and gone? then we shall never see him again?

Yes: he shall appear in the heavens with his mighty Angels.

Without sin. Why, the first time he appeared without sin? for He knew no
sin.

I but then he came with his frail body to offer up for sin, Verse 26.

Now he shall appear with no more sacrifice for sin. Then he came as a Lamb
to be slain for sin: now as a King and a Lion. Then he came as a Priest with a
sacrifice to offer: now as a Judge to sit on the Throne.

To the salvation of the godly, but to the damnation of wicked and reprobate
men.

Here is another argument against the Mass. Men may as well dye often,
ordinarily, as Christ be offered up often. As this is an unmovable truth, that
a man ordinarily dies but once: So this is a firm position in Divinity, that
CHRIST can be but once offered properly.

But to whom shall the day of Judgment be comfortable? to them that are weary
of the load of sin, and look for their deliverer, Iud. 5.28.
Phil. 3.20. Tit. 2.13. 2 Pet. 3.12. The mother of Sisera looked out at a
window for the coming of her Son: So we, the spiritual mother, brethren and
sisters of Christ, must look out at the window of our hearts for him.

A Woman looks for her Husband: and we look to our money, our Sheep and Oxen,
but we look not for Christ. It is to be feared, if he were a coming, we would
entreat him to tarry still and say with the devils, why art thou come to
torment us before the time? he is our deliverer, let us look for him, as
faithful servants for their masters, and say; come LORD JESUS, come quickly.

The second coming of CHRIST is here notably described.

1. He shall come potenter, because it is said, he shall appear. 2.
Innocenter, without sin. 3. Finaliter, to them that look for him. 4.
Vtiliter, to salvation.
He shall appear to all, yea even to them, that look not for him: they that
have pierced him, shall see him: he shall appear to Judas, that for thirty
pieces betrayed him: to the Pharisees that burned in hatred against him to the
death, and would not be satisfied but with his blood, crying out with full
mouth and would have no nay, crucify him: to the Soldier that thrust him
through with a spear: he shall appear to abominable murderers, to beastly
drunkards, to impure adulterers and adulteresses, that have grieved him with
their sins, and dyed in them without repentance: but it shall be to damnation,
go ye cursed into everlasting fire. So that as soon as they begin to peep
out of their graves, they shall howl and cry, o ye hills and rocks fall on
us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the
wrath of the Lamb.

But to them that look for him, that love his appearing, that say in their
hearts with them in the Revelation, Come Lord Jesus, come quickly, he shall
appear to salvation: So that they shall lift up their heads, because their
salvation is at hand: he that comes is their friend, elder brother, Husband,
Head, Savior, therefore they need not to fear his coming: they shall meet
Christ in the air, be translated with him into the kingdom of glory, and
remain with him in unspeakable happiness for evermore. Wherefore let us all
be in the number of them that look for his coming: be ye like to servants,
says Christ, that wait for their Master. As the daughter of Iepthe looked for
her fathers coming, went forth with Timbrels and daunces to meet him: so let
us joyfully look for Christ's coming, the father that has created us, the
SAVIOR that has redeemed us. Shall not the Wife look for the coming of her
Husband, if he be gone into Spain or a far Country? Shall not one brother
look for the coming of another? Jesus Christ is our Husband, our elder
brother: therefore let us look for him. The Saints in St. Paul's time looked
for his coming: and shall not we now? all the signs of his coming are past,
which may be as warning pieces to us: the Gospel has been preached over all
the world, rumors of wars, therefore why should we not look for his coming?

Especially his coming to our particular death may be looked for every moment
of an hour. I am now old, said Isaac, yet know I not the day of my death. So
may every one of us say. Absalom was a young man: yet hanged by the hair of
his head, and shot to death by Ioab. Nabal a rich man, over night merry with
wine, in the morning as dead as a stone. Valentinian the Emperor, when sitting
in his Consistory, he rayled on the Sarmatians, an issue of blood burst out of
his body, and he dyed immediately. We are now strong, healthful, and lusty,
God be praised for it; yet the axe of death may cut us off ere we be aware.
Wherefore let us look for Christ's coming general or particular, that
whenever he shall come, we may enter with him into the wedding chamber of
the kingdom of heaven, there to remain with him for evermore.

CHAP. 10.
Analysis.
BEfore, we had a dissimilitude between the two High Priests: now he
prosequutes the difference between the Law and CHRIST.

1. A consummation of the Priesthood of Christ, to Verse 19.

2. An exhortation to constancy, inferred thereupon.

In the consummation, 1. An antithesis between the legal sacrifices and
Christ's, in the ten former Verses.

2. An opposition between the Priests of the Law and our Savior Christ, ab
11. to 19.

The Antithesis between the legal sacrifices and Christ's has two branches:
1. Is the weakness of the legal sacrifices, in the four first Verses. 2. The
power and efficacy of Christ's sacrifice, a 5. to 11.


The weakness of the legal sacrifices is set down in this

1. From the nature of the Law: that, which was but a shadow of the remission
of sins and other good things to be procured by CHRIST, could not take away
sin: the Law was but a shadow, etc. Ergo.

2. From the often repetition of them. If the legal sacrifices ergo.

From the use of them. They that can only put men in remembrance ergo.

From the vility and baseness of them: there Bulls, and ergo, they were not
able to do it.

The power of Christ's sacrifice is confirmed by a testimony Verse 8. 2. An
explication of it, Verses 8.9, 10.

In the testimony alleged there be two things.

1. CHRIST 's calling to the offering up of this sacrifice, Verse 5.6.

2. His promptness and readiness to exequute that calling Verse 7.

In his calling two circumstances. 1. The time when 2. The reason why: the time
was at his coming into the world, Gal. 4.4. The reason is taken from the
rejection of the legal sacrifices.

Which is amplified by a repetition of those rejected sacrifices.

His readiness to execute his calling appears by the offering of his service
to God the Father: which is illustrated by the manner of

The manner, lo I come: the impulsive cause was the fulfilling of the
Scripture, which had written of him before: the end, to do thy will.

The interpretation contains two things.

1. The collection of an argument out of it, Ver. 8. and 9. that has two
branches.

1. The abolishing of the legal sacrifices. 2. The establishing of Christ's.

2. A comfortable consequent ensuing thereupon, Verse 10.

The collection of the argument is taken from the order used by the Psalmist,
who upon the insufficiency of the legal sacrifices, concludes the necessity
of Christ his sacrifice.

These being premised, and God professing that he takes no pleasure in them,
then comes our Savior with an offering of the sacrifice of his own body.

Then follows the consequent. Analysis.


The second Antithesis is between the Priests of the Law and Christ.

Where, 1. The opposition, to Verse 15.

2. A confirmation of it, to the 19.

The opposition has two members.

1. The order and manner of the Priests of the Law.

2. The order and manner of our Priest in the time of the Gospel.

1. For number, they were many for their office, they stood ministering every
day. 3. For the sacrifices, they offered always the same, and that often. 4.
For the inability or insufficiency of them, they could not take away sin.

The manner of our Priest.

1. He is but one, whereas they were many. 2. His sacrifice was but one, and
that once offered, Verse 10. 3. His was propitiatory for sins, whereas theirs
were not. 4. He sits as Lord, he stands not as a servant, as they did: and
he sits not on an altar on earth, but at the right hand of God in heaven.
The which glorious sitting of his, is first amplified by an effect an
expectation of his friends to come to him, for whom he dyed,

Then it is ratified by a reason, taken from the power and virtue of his
sacrifice. If by that one offering, which he made on earth, before his
Ascension into heaven, he has perfected his for ever, then he may well
continue in heaven still at the right hand of GOD: but, etc. Ergo.

Jeremy.

Where, 1. An allegation of it.

2. A ratiocination or reasoning thereupon.

In the allegation. 1. The Author.



Christ's Priesthood and sacrifice.

If remission of sins be fully procured and obtained by the one sacrifice of
Christ in the New Testament once offered, then there is no more oblation for
sin: but, etc. as appears by the testimony before cited: ergo, the latter.

An exhortation to holiness of life is deduced upon the former doctrine.

The former part of the Epistle has been doctrinall, delivering many
excellent points of doctrine concerning the person and offices of our Savior
Christ.

In his Priesthood he has been more ample, because greatest controversies
were moved about it. The latter part of the Epistle is moral, showing what use
we are to make of the former doctrine, to Verse. 20. cap. 13.

In this exhortation. 1. A general proposition comprehending summarily in it
all things belonging to a Christian, a 19. to 32. 2. A particular unfolding of
it.

In the general proposition. 1. The substance of the exhortation, to 26. 2.
The necessity of it, a 26. to 32.

In the substance, 1. The foundation, whereupon it is built, 19.20, 21.

2. The matter, whereunto we are exhorted. The foundation, whereupon it is
built, is the consideration of many singular benefits, which we reap by
CHRIST: they are in number three.

key, whereby it is opened, the blood of Jesus. 2. By the manner of entering
into it, not with fear and trembling, quaking and shaking, but with boldness.

2. By the way that leads to that Sanctuary, the sacred body Savior Christ:
wherein he made satisfaction to the wrath of God for our sins.

Which is described.

1. By a similitude. 2. By the author and consecrator of that way. 3. By the
qualities of the way.
3. It is illustrated by the guide and leader to conduct us in that way, which
is set forth by his office, by his greatness, by his superiority and authority.

The matter of the exhortation, which is a general drawing near to God,
amplified by the manner of it, not so much with the heart: not with a false,
but with a true heart.

2. The particular duties or virtues wherewith we must draw near to him, which
are four.

1. Faith. 2. Hope. 3. Love. 4. Christian exercises for the preservation of
love.

Of these he entreats afterward. Of Faith, Chap. 11. Of Hope, Chap. 12. Of
Love with the exercises thereof, Chap. 13.

Faith is illustrated.

1. By the propriety thereof, which is a full assurance.

2. By an effect, which it engenders, which is the comfort of a good
conscience: as they in the time of the Law were sprinkled with the blood of
beasts, Exodus 24.8. So being justified by faith, our hearts are sprinkled with
the blood of Christ, whereby being purged from all our sins, we are delivered
from an evil accusing conscience, and have peace with God.

The second virtue is hope: the profession whereof is stoutly to

1. Amplified by the efficient cause thereof, which is the washing of us with
the pure water of the Spirit, whereby we are made fit to make and hold this
profession.

2. By the manner, how it is to be kept: without wavering.

3. By a reason to excite us to the keeping of it, taken from the nature of
God, the pillar, on whom our hope leans. If God be faithful, that has
promised eternal life to us, which we hope for, then let us keep the
profession of it: but God is faithful, that has promised eternal life to us,
which we hope for: ergo, let us keep the profession of it.

The third is love: whereunto we are to provoke one another.

1. Love is commended to us. 2. A breake-necke of love is removed, V. 25. The
virtue of love is amplified. 1. By an antecedent, that must go before it, the
considering one of another: and by a consequent, that necessarily follows
love, which is good works.

The exercises for the preservation of love are two.

1. A reverend estimation of Christian assemblies, a notable

And from that he dissuadeth us by the example of some in his time, which is to
be avoided by us.

2. A mutual exhorting one of another: whereunto he spurreth us by a
consideration of the neerenesse of the day of judgment: confirmed by their own
testimony.

If the day of Judgment be at hand, wherein we must give account, how we
have behaved our selves in this present life; what souls we have won by our
diligent exhorting one of anothor, and what we have lost by the neglect of that
duty; then let us carefully exhort one another. But the first is true, as you
all see: therefore let the latter be practiced by us.

Gods vengeance; then it behooveth us all to regard it: but they, etc. Ergo.

In this we have two things.

1. A demonstration of their lamentable end, Ver. 26.27. 2. A confirmation of
it.
In the demonstration of their lamentable end. 1. Their sin: then their
punishment. Their sin is set forth. 1. By the nature of it: it is a willing
sinning. 2. By the time when it is committed, after the receipt of the
knowledge of the truth.

Their punishment is described, 1. By a substraction of the remedy against sin,
there remains no more sacrifice for it.

a fearful expectation, of two things: of judgment, as of the antecedent; of
fire, as of the consequent; described by the quality of it, and by an effect of
devouring: whom? the adversaries of Christ, for they are the fuel of this
fire.



1. A Minori; if they that despise Moses Law, dye without mercy; much more
they that despise Christ's Law: but the one: ergo, the other.

Where, 1. The protasis of the comparison, showing what befell to the former.

2. The apodosis, what shall befall the latter.

In the protasis, 1. The fault. 2. The punishment.

The fault is a despising; not every transgressing of Moses Law.

The punishment is death: amplified by the severity of it, without mercy: and
the equity of it, because the party is condemned by two or three witnesses.

In the apodosis there is an inversion of these two.

Christ is greater than Moses, the Lord and master of the house, then a servant
in the house.

2. The haynousnes of the sin, in respect of two most glorious and worthy
persons contemned by them; God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.

In the Son there be two special things; the mystery of his incarnation;
for that they tread under foot the Son of God, which was God manifested in the
flesh, 1 Timothy 3.16. the Savior and redeemer of the world.

The mystery of his passion; for that they count the blood of the Testament an
unholy thing. Which ingratitude is amplified by a benefit bestowed on them:
though they had been sanctified by that blood.

For the Holy Ghost is the instructor and comforter of the Church; that
reveals the will of God to men. They despise the spirit of grace: therefore
they are worthy of sore punishment.

VERSE 1.
THe ceremonial Law, not the moral: that contains substantial duties: that
shows sin to us, but is no shadow of any thing in Christ to come.

A dark, an obscure delineation

Of Jesus Christ, and all his benefits, of justification, sanctification and
redemption purchased by him: bonagratiae and gloriae.

A lively picture of them, as we have in the time of the Gospel, wherein
Christ is painted out and crucified before our eyes.

A shadow is a resemblance of a body: utrumque repraesentat: umbra in communi,
imago in particulari. When ye see a shadow, ye may truly say, there is a
body, yet it is but a general resemblance of a body. 1. A shadow cannot fight.
2. Not eat. 3. Not speak. 4. Not walk, but accidentally. Ye cannot perceive
in a shadow the distinct parts and members of a body, the eyes, the face,
hands, arms, feet, etc. only the shadow tells you there is a body: but an
image has the whole lineaments and proportion of the body in it. In it ye may
behold the several parts and dimensions of the body: So in the Law they had a
sight of Christ, yet it was darkely in a shadow. We have the very express
form and image of Christ with all his benefits: they had Christ in an obscure
picture drawn at the first in dark lines: we have him as in a lively picture
graced with most lightsome and excellent colors. Abraham saw the day of
Christ, and was glad: yet he saw him a far off, and at a little crevis: we
see the sun of righteousness clearly shining before our eyes: they saw him
as in a winter day: we see him in a bright summers day. Luke 23.24.
Blessed are the eyes that see, that which we see: for Kings and Prophets have
desired to see those things which we see, and have not seen them.

The Law did shadow out Christ; by whom we are justified and redeemed from our
sins: it did not justify and redeem us.

The same specie, though not numero: the same in substance, as Goats, Sheep,
Heifers, etc. and offered up always with the same rites and ceremonies: they
offered them up regulariter; the same according to the Law, frequenter,
indesinenter, yet inefficaciter.

Never: though they be iterated ten thousand times, etc. no hope of salvation
by the sacrifices of the Law.

They: the Priests immediately, and all the people mediately by the hands of
the Priest.

Yearly: he seems to allude especially to that sacrifice which the
High Priest offered yearly for all Israel, when he went into the Sanctum
Sanctorum: that of all others was most solemn, for himself, his household,
and the whole land, Levit. 16.

Sanctify: the heart or conscience. Though they might give them an outward
kind of sanctification. Or perfect, (...): the Word, Sacraments, prayer,
cannot perfect: no perfection till we come to heaven.

That came to it. As Scholars to the Master, to be taught and directed by it.

Whereas all that come to CHRIST by faith, obtain true Sanctification,
Hebrews 7.25. salvation is not by the Law, but by Jesus Christ.

But herein is condemnation, says Christ, light is come into the world, but
men love darkness more than light. We live in wonderful light: yet the
works of darkness are too rise among us: drunkenness, envy, strife,
emulations, etc. A great number of us are in the Pharisees case: are we also
blind? Christ said to them: if ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye
say, we see: therefore your sin remains. We see much, yet we practice
little: therefore our sins multiplied by us in this great light, shall testify
against us at the latter day.

I fear me this sentence may be inverted: the godly in time of the Law had the
substance, and we have the shadow: there is almost nothing but shadows among
us. A shadow of knowledge, of zeal, love, holiness; we have a form of
godliness, but deny the power thereof. Therefore as we live in greater light,
so let our light shine before men, that they seeing our good works -- we and
they may glorify our Father in this life, and be glorified of him in the life
to come.

Our Sacraments may sanctify us instrumentally: they may be as instruments
whereby God conveyeth Sanctification to us. In respect whereof Baptism is
called the washing of the new birth: they may sanctify us significantly, as
signs of our sanctification, nay as seals of it; but they cannot sanctify us
as principal efficient causes of our Sanctification. Now it is CHRIST alone,
that thus sanctifies us, and cleanses us from all our sins: for this cause
sanctify I my self. Ioh. 17.19.
He is the only fountain of our sanctification: neither the sacrifices in
the Law, nor our Sacraments in the time of the Gospel can (in this sense)
procure to us the sanctification of our souls, that we may be fit for the
heavenly Jerusalem.

VERSE 2.
SOme coppies have (...) -- make it an interrogation: yet it is better to read
it affirmatively: otherwise they should have ceased to have been offered.

Once purged: from the guilt and punishment of sin.

Should no more be pricked in conscience for their sins, their consciences
accusing them, and drawing them before the tribunal of Gods justice for their
sins. If a medicine have once thoroughly cured a man, it needs not again be
ministered to the man. So if the ceremonial Law with her sacrifices had healed
the people of their sins, those sacrifices might have ceased to be offered:
but they were offered every year: therefore they did not purge them from their
sins.

The often iteration of those sacrifices showed their inability to take away
sin.

If the sacrifice of Christ once offered on the Cross have purged us from all
sin, then Christ must be no more offered: but the sacrifice of Christ once
offered on the Cross has purged us from all sin, which the Papists deny
not. Therefore Christ is no more to be offered, as they say he is, in the
sacrifice of the Mass.

The Jesuits affirm that the Apostle here strikes at the legal sacrifices:
but not at the sacrifice of holy Church. I but with one stroke he wounds
them both. The repetition of a sacrifice argues the weakness and debility of
it: for if it have once abolished sin, it needs not be repeated again.
CHRIST by his sacrifice on the Cross has taken away the sins of the world:
therefore Christ is not to be offered up any kind of way, neither bloudily,
nor unbloudily to expiate sin.

There is a conscience in every man, that keeps a register of all his sins.
It is scientia cum alia scientia. There is a general knowledge of the Law
written in the hearts of us all, and conscience is a particular application of
it to our selves. As for example, the Law of God says, Whoremongers and
Adulterers God will judge.

My conscience says to me, if I be guilty of that sin, thou art an
Adulterer, thou have had thy Queanes in many corners: therefore God will judge
thee: this is conscience which sets our sins in order before us.

For the better unfolding of it, we know that there be sundry kinds of
consciences.

1. There is an erring conscience, a blind conscience: as was in them that
thought they did God good service, Ioh. 16.2.
when they killed the Children of God. Such a conscience was in Paul before his
conversion, for the which he was grieved afterward: when the eyes of their
mind come but once to be opened, then their conscience will accuse them for
it.

2. There is a sleeping conscience. A man knows the will of God, yet his
conscience being a sleep for a time, 2 Samuel 24.8.
he lies snorting in the bed of sin. So did David in his sin of numbering the
people: but his conscience awoke at the length, and his heart smote him for it.
A man may lie sleeping in covetousness, drunkenness, adultery, and God at the
length awaken him out of that sleep, which is good for him.

3. There is a seared conscience: such as was in them, 1 Timothy 4.2. when men are
past feeling and hardened in their sins. Custom becomes another nature. They
are so accustomed to drinking, whoring, oppressing, and deceiving of their
neighbors, as that they think those to be no sins. Their consciences never
check them for them. These are in the ready way to Hell.

4. There is an accusing conscience, which is as a scolding queen in the house
of a man's heart, and will never suffer him to be quiet day nor night. They are
like the raging Sea, continually foaming. In that case were they, that went out
of the Temple one by one, being convicted of their own consciences. Ioh. 8.9.
Such a conscience had Judas, when he cried, I have sinned in betraying
innocent blood. This may prove a tragedy both in the end, and in the beginning
too, as it did in him, and it may end with a comedy in Gods Children. It may
lead some to hell, and for others, it may be the way to heaven. Mordeat nunc,
ut moriatur -- It is better for us that this Worm gnaw on us here to the
vexation of our hearts for a while, then gnaw on us eternally hereafter.

This accusing conscience more or less we shall have in this world at one
time or other: they that fall into gross sins and yet never feel a hell in
their consciences in this life, shall never find an heaven in the life to
come. Therefore it was well said of one being demanded which was the way to
heaven: hell, says he. For if thou go not by hell, thou will never get to
heaven.

3. There is an excusing and clearing conscience. When the books are cleared
between GOD and us. A debtor is cleared when the book of his Creditour is
crossed: so our consciences are quiet, when our sins are out of Gods book,
then we shall have no more conscience of sin. This could not be effected by the
sacrifices in the time of the Law: neither can it be obtained by any thing
that we can do in the time of the Gospel. It is neither our coming to
Church, nor hearing of Sermons, (though these be good things) not our prayers,
fastings, alms deeds, receiving of Communions: noe, though we should give our
bodies to be burnt. These are excellent duties; yet these cannot acquit our
consciences of sin: for when we have done all, we are unprofitable servants,
and we sin in our best actions. The only way to come to a quiet, and excusing
conscience, is the application of Christ's merits to our selves: Romans 5.1.
being justified by faith we have peace with God.

If we have laid hold on CHRIST by a lively faith, we may take up that song:
death, where is thy sting? etc. Therefore let us repent, and then entreat the
Lord to assure our consciences that CHRIST has dyed for all our sins, and
then we shall have no more conscience of sins. So we shall sing for joy, when
we lie on our death beds, and shall stand without trembling before God in the
life to come.

VERSE 3.
But the offerers of them have still conscience of sin.

(...) is put for (...).

Not only of their present sins, but of their sins past too. All of them do
lie as a load still on their consciences, whereof the yearly sacrifice by the
High Priest puts them in mind, Levit. 16.21.

As they in the time of the Law had many sacrifices to put them in remembrance
of sin: so we in the time of the Gospel have many remembrancers of sin.
Sundry Monitours to admonish us that we be sinners. The Rainbow may be a
remembrance of sin to us, that the world was once drowned for sin, and that
it might be so still, but for the goodness and mercy of God. Baptism daily
ministered in the Church puts us in mind of sin: for if we were not
sinners, we needed not to be baptized. The Lords Supper puts us in mind of
sin: do this in remembrance of me, that my body was broken for you and my
blood shed for you on the Cross. The immoderate showers that come often in
harvest, and deprive us of the fruits of the earth, may put us in mind of sin:
for they be our sins that keep good things from us. Our moyling and toyling
for the sustentation of our selves with much care and wearisome labor: for if
we had not sinned, it should not have bin so. The sicknesses and diseases that
be among us, terrible agewes that bring men to deaths door, and continue with
them many weeks together: the plague and pestilence that has raged among us,
swept many, thousands away, and in a manner consumed some Towns, etc. the
death of so many of our brethren and sisters continually before our eyes, etc.
may put us in mind of sin, for if we had not sinned, we should not have dyed.
There be a number of things to put us in mind of sin: but there is nothing
that can take away sin, but Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God that takes away
the sins of the world. All these should humble us, and make us to knock on our
breasts with the poor Publican, and say, o God be merciful to us sinners.
Therefore let us all fly to this heavenly Physician for the curing of us.

VERSE 4.
HE does not say, it is an unlikely thing, hard or difficult, but unpossible.

1. God that is offended by sin, and to be reconciled to us, is a Spirit: Bulls
and Goats are fleshly things, Psalm. 50.13.

2. God is most holy, just and righteous: there is no holiness in Bulls and
Goats.

3. Man is a far more glorious creature, then Bulls and Goats: created after
Gods own Image, endewed with reason and understanding, yet the blood of the
wisest and holiest men in the world could not make satisfaction for sin, much
less can the blood of Bulls and Goats.

Ye are more worth than many Sparrowes: so we are more worth than many Bulls
and Goats.

4. The Angels in heaven cannot take away sin: much less Bulls and Goats.

5. As man had sinned: so the blood of man must be powered out for the sin of
man: yea, the blood of such a man as knew no sin. A sinner cannot satisfy for
sinners: therefore it became us to have such a High Priest, as was separated
from sinners. Neither was he to be a mere man, but God and man: the power of
man is finite, the power of God is infinite. Therefore he that delivered us
from sin, offered up himself by his eternal Deity. So that it is not the
blood of Bulls and Goats that can take away sin, but we are purchased with
the blood of God. Hebr. 9.24. Act. 20.28.


Object. Levit. 16.30. That is spoken sacramentally, because that was a token
and a signification of their clensing.

Object. Rhemists. The sacrifices of the Law before Christ could not take away
sin: but the sacrifice of the New Testament, since CHRIST 's death, being an
Application of it, can take away sin.

Sol. I but no creature can do it, neither before, nor since CHRIST 's
passion. CHRIST yesterday and to day the same for ever.

Oh that this were effectually considered of us all. We are redeemed from our
old conversation by the precious blood of CHRIST. Our sins cost the blood of
the LORD JESUS. Therefore let us take no pleasure in them. David said of the
water, for the which three of his worthies ventured their lives, 2 Samuel 23.17.
this is the blood of them, etc. Therefore he would not drink of it, but
powered it on the ground. So as often as we are entised to sin, to
drunkenness, uncleanness, covetousness, etc. Let us say, these cost the
blood of the Son of God; therefore though never so sweet, let us not drink
of that water, but hurl it away. The love of CHRIST should constrain us to
it. Will any nourish a Serpent, that has killed his dear friend? Sin is the
Serpent, that killed CHRIST, the friend of friends: therefore let us not
harbor him, but hurl him out of doors. Yet this blood wherewith we are
bought, is little considered; for all that we wallow in sin still. But they
that belong to Christ, will lay it to heart, that it may be as a bridle to
restrain them from sin. As we are washed from our sins in the blood of Christ
(no other blood could do it) so let us cast away sin, keep our selves undefiled
in this world, that we may reign with Christ in the world to come.

VERSE 5.
1. THe promised Messiah, of whom David prophesies in that Psalm: for there
be sundry things that are peculiar to Christ, and cannot be communicated to
David. 1. God required sacrifices of David: but of this man he requires none,
Psalm. 40.6. 2. This man was to supply the defect of the legal sacrifices, and
to fulfill the will of GOD perfectly for mankind: this could not David do.
Therefore this is a prophecy which David makes of our Savior Christ.

Taking our nature on him. In respect of his deity he was in the world before;
but now he is in it too in respect of his humanity. Ioh. 3.13. Ephesians. 4.9. yet he
brought not his body with him from heaven, 1 Cor. 15.47. Namely, to God the
Father.

Cruenta, that were slain, and incruenta. Caphatsta: thou take no pleasure
in.

He would have those sacrifices in the time of the Law, as demonstrations of
their obedience, and monuments of thankfulness, as Noah: but now in the time
of the Gospel he will not have them. 2. He would have them, as types and
figures for a time, to represent the sacrifice of Christ to come: but he will
not have them, as propitiatory for sin. The only propitiatory sacrifice for the
sins of the world is the sacrifice of Christ's body, which is opposed to the
others.

Have thou fitted in all respects for me.

Here seems to be an apparent jarre between St. Paul and David. In the Hebrew
it is, aoznaijm Carithali: boared.

Some think that the Seventy whom St. Paul follows, did at the first
interpret it, (...), according to the Hebrew: and afterward by the fault of
the Printers came in (...). But there is no likelihood the Apostle would cite a
corrupt gloss, instead of the true interpretation.

In substance there is no difference between the Hebrew and the Greek. If God
the Father prepared ears for Christ, then a body. For there cannot be ears
without a body: so that both may stand very well: save that the Seventy no
doubt directed by the Spirit of God does make the Prophets meaning more plain,
which St. Paul lays hold of, because it fitteth his purpose: to make an
opposition between the sacrifice of Christ's body, and the sacrifices of the
Law.

The servant, that would dwell with his master, had his ear bored through with
an awle: Exodus 21.5. So because Christ offered himself as a servant to God the
Father for our sakes, it is said, that he boared his ears in token of that his
voluntary service. But he could not have his ears prepared for the doing of
the will of his Father, unless he had a body. Therefore the Seventie to make
it more clear, says, a body have thou prepared for me, wherein I should do
thee service, and suffer for mankind.

And because all the Sacrifices in the Law could not take away sin, therefore
was this body of Christ prepared by the Lord, that should be sacrificed for the
sins of the world. No other sacrifice was able to make satisfaction to Gods
justice for the sins of men, Verse 10.

Ioh. 16.21.
There is joy, when any man child comes into the world: but much more have we
all cause to skip for joy at Christ's coming into the world. Unto us a child
is given, to us a Son is borne: behold I bring you tidings of great joy,
Isai. 9.6.
said the Angel to the Shepherds, when Christ came into the world. The Angels
sung at his coming, which needed not to be redeemed by him: and shall not we
men sing for his coming, for whose redemption he came into the world? it had
been better for us, we had never set a foot into the world, if he had not come
into the world. Therefore let us praise God all the days of our life for his
coming into the world.

When he comes into the world, that was the maker of the world. For by him
all things were made -- nay, that which is more, when he comes into the
world that was the Savior and redeemer of the world, that reconciled the world
to God: and yet found no kind entertainment in the world, he was rayled at,
spitted on, buffetted, whipped crucified: he came into the world, but the world
received him not. And shall we that be Christians imagine to find any kindness in
the world? it hated the Head, and will it love the members? no, we must look to
have a stepmother of the world, as Christ had: we must look for crosses and
afflictions in the world, as he had.

As Christ came into the world: so in the time appointed by the Father, he went
out of the world again: and so must we. There is a time to be borne, and a time
to dye: as we came into the world, so we must go out of the world. Where we
came we may know: but where we shall go out, we cannot tell. Let us glorify
Christ, while we be here, that at our departure out of the world, we may live
with him in eternal glory.

He says: not so soon as he came into the world, when he lay in the cratch:
but he said, in the time of his humiliation in the world.

And how came he into the world? after a base and ignominious manner: borne of
a poor woman, affianced to a Carpenter, that was brought to bed in a stable in
the Inn, where he was laid in a Manger, wrapped up in mean swaddling clouts.
This was the manner of his first coming: contemptible in the eyes of the
world. But his second coming shall be most glorious, when he shall come in the
clouds with all his holy Angels attending on him.

Now he came as a Lamb to be killed, therefore he came meanly: then he shall
come as a Lion and a King to reign for ever. Therefore that shall be a glorious
coming: it shall be terrible to the wicked, but most comfortable to us that be
the wife of the Lord Jesus.

A true body, made of a Woman, the fruit of her Womb, as ours is: not an aerie
or fantastical body, as some Heretics dreamed. A body in all substantial
things like to ours: differing only in one accidental thing, and that is
sin: him that knew no sin did God make sin for us --

God ordained him a soul too. The deity did not supply the office of his
soul, as Apollinaris did imagine: he had a true soul too, as we have, wherein
he suffered for our sakes: my soul is heavy to the death. But because the body
is conspicuous, so is not the soul; and because he was to dye in his body, he
could not dye in respect of his soul: therefore the spirit of God names that.

God has ordained a body for every man: but a more special and excellent body
for our Savior Christ: a body conceived, not by the conjunction of a man and a
woman, but extraordinarily by the Holy Ghost, that being a most pure and sacred
body, not infected with the least spot and contagion of sin, it might be a
propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of the world. Ours are most wretched and
sinful bodies, that because they are poisoned with sin, must one day see
corruption, and be consumed to dust and ashes. Lazarus body did stincke, when
it lay four days in the earth. Ours in regard of sin are stinking bodies:
but Christ's was a most glorious body, and for that cause saw no corruption.
Absalom had a beautiful body, yet a wretched body: Saul had a comely body: yet
a miserable body. The body of the fairest Lady on earth is a vile body, only
Christ's was a glorious body.

The Martyrs bodies, that were burnt for the profession of the Gospel, were in
some respect to be honored, because they were the Temples of the Holy Ghost,
and sealed up the truth of the Gospel with their blood: yet all their bodies
joined together, nor the bodies of all the holy men in the world could make
satisfaction for one sin: therefore God ordained Christ a body for this
purpose, to be offered up for the sins of us all.

As for our bodies, let us labor to offer them up as a lively sacrifice to God
in all obedience to him in this life; that Christ may change them, and make
them like his glorious body in the life to come.

VERSE 6.
THe reason why thou have prepared this body for me is, because in burnt
offerings and sin offerings thou had no pleasure. These would not content
thee, therefore I come with my body into the world. Supply (...). Here he
reckons up two other sacrifices used in the Law, which God likewise rejected.
Loa shealta, (...). The sense is all one.

VERSE 7.
FReely, of mine own accord, as 1 Reg. 22.21. Isai. 6.8. as an obedient child
says to his father, lo I come, father: if it be to preferment, a man will
say, lo I come: but if it be to the Gallows for another, who will say, lo I
come?

Why? because in the beginning of thy book -- that moved him to it, that the
things written of him might be performed.

Hebr. Bimgillath, in volumine, in the scrowle. For the Bible with the Jews
(as it is at this day) was wrapped up in a scrowle, not printed, as it is among
us. Megillath, of Galal, volvere. The Seventie (...): which has bred diversity
of interpretations. Some refer it to the beginning of the Psalms, Psalm.
1.2. whereas that is spoken of all the godly: others to the first verse in all
the Bible. In the beginning. 1. In Christ, which was from all beginning. In
principio, that is in filio -- but that is impertinent. The Seventie have
interpreted the Hebrew word aright: for (...) (as Suidas records) does
signify (...), involucrum, because when the book is rolled up in a Scrowle,
it comes to a kind of head. In the Scrowle of the Book, that has the form
of an head.

The Scripture is called one book, because, though it contain diverse books,
yet it agrees as if it were but one: no dissonance in this book. There is
never a book in all the Bible, but testifies of CHRIST. It is written of him,
Genesis 3. The seed of the woman. It is written of him in all the books of
Moses, in the Historical books, in the Psalms, and in all the Prophets:
therefore to fulfill these writings, CHRIST came in the flesh, Matthew. 26.54.
he would not escape death, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.

To do thy will. CHRIST came not only to do the general will of God
comprised in the Law: but to do his particular will also, as the Mediator of
mankind: to dye for man, Luke 22.42. Ioh. 4.34.6, 38. he offers himself to
death, Ioh. 18.5. he comes as a Lamb to dye for us: he offers himself to the
butchers.

Oh the unspeakeable love of Christ! If it be to ascend to honor and
preferment, then we will say, lo I come. If any say, here is a 1000l for thee,
we answer readily, Lo I come: but if it be to go to the Gallows, there to
be hanged for another man, who will say, lo I come?

CHRIST was now going to the Cross, there to be hanged between two thieves
for us, that were no better than thieves, robbing God of his glory: yet he
says, lo I come, I am here, Father, to do thy will, and to dye for sinful
men.

Who can sufficiently express this love? It may be one durst dye for a good
man: but who will dye for bad men, for those that be his enemies, as we were
CHRIST 's? o admirable love! the love of CHRIST should constrain us, and cause
us to say, lo we come in the like case. Lord Jesus, would thou have me to
go to prison for thy sake? Lo I come. Would thou have me to loose all my
goods for thee and thy Gospel? would thou have me to be banished out of
my Country, nay to be burnt, to dye an ignominious death for thy sake? lo I
come. I am ready, says Paul, Acts 21.13.
not only to be bound, but to dye at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
Oh that the like affection were in us! If any call us to go to the Alehouse,
we are ready to say, lo I come, I will be with you out of hand. If any call
us to a foolish and wanton interlude, lo I come, we fly speedily: but if it
be to do the will of GOD, especially to suffer any thing for the name of
CHRIST, then we draw back: we have married a Wife, we are wedded to our
pleasures, we cannot come.

But let us in some measure go as cheerfully, about Christ's businesses, as
he did about ours, when He went to dye for us, and said, lo I come.

Our Savior Christ is only to be found in the Scripture, he is the
principal object, and scope of the Scripture, the Scripture is a glass
wherein we behold Christ, Ioh. 5.39. to him bear all the Prophets witness.
Ought not all things to be fulfilled, Luke 24.44.
that are written of me in the book of the Psalms.

In Plutarch it is written of all the famous men among the Grecians and
Romans. In Xenophon it is written of Cyrus. In Caesar's Commentaries, of
Caesar. In Herodotus of Darius. In Ambrose of Theodotius and Valentinian. In
Eusebius of Constantine that religious Emperor.

But in the Scripture it is written of CHRIST, the author and finisher of our
salvation: without whom we can have no comfort in any thing whatsoever. This
should inflame us with the love of the Scripture: this book should be our
delight day and night. Yet a wonder it is, to see the perverseness of our
nature! We had rather almost be reading of any book, be it never so
ridiculous, of any fabulous History whatsoever, of Robbin-hood, etc. then the
Scripture: Yet here we may find Christ, to the everlasting comfort of our
souls. All the books in the world are not worthy to be named the same day
with this book. Timothy learned the holy Scriptures from a child: so let us
all do, that we may learn Christ without whom all learning is not worth a
straw.

VERSE 8.
IN the former place of the testimony above cited.

When the Messiah said.

He reckons up all, to show the debility of them all.

Not because they were offered by wicked men, in which respect they are
sometime rejected by God, as Isai. 1.13. but because there was no power in them
to take away sin.

No, though they were offered by the constitution of the Law.

VERSE 9.
THen: when those sacrifices would not serve the turn.

Jesus Christ.

Which those sacrifices cannot do.

Whereupon the Apostle concludes, that the first being taken away, the latter
is established. The legal sacrifices being removed, CHRIST 's sacrifice alone
remains, as forcible to the putting away of sin.

Here we see it is not enough to read and allege Scriptures, but we must
deduce arguments out of them, for the confutation of errors, and the
establishing of the truth. The Apostle here by this testimony out of the Psalm
overthrowes the doting opinion of the Jews, which sought justification in
circumcision and in the sacrifices of the Law. And by the same he confirms
this truth, that we are saved by the only oblation of our Savior Christ. The
like must be practiced by us: we must not slightly read the Scriptures, but
make an holy and profitable use of them. An argument derived out of the
Scripture, is of more weight then all the authorities of men.

VERSE 10.
BY the which will, that he came to do: by the exequution of which will.

Sanctified, that is made pure from all our sins, the holiness of Christ being
imputed to us.

He shows in particular what will he means: that special will of God, that
the body of his Son should be offered up for us.

And that not often, as the sacrifices were in the Law: but once.

That one oblation was sufficient for all: by this we obtain remission of
sins, justification, sanctification in this life, and eternal glorification in
the life to come.

Christ was but once offered, and that bloudily: the unbloudy sacrifice of the
Mass has no Scripture to lean upon.

Not by the offering up of the body of an heyfer, a Goatea, Sheep, etc. which
were offered up often in the time of the Law: but by the offering of Christ's
body once made.

By this alone we are sanctified, and by it alone we stand as holy and
unblameable before Gods Tribunal seat. We are sanctified by baptism
instrumentally, Ephesians. 5.26. we are sanctified by the Holy Ghost as the worker
of sanctification: but we are sanctified by the offering up of the body of
Christ, as the meritorious cause of our sanctification.

The bodies of the Saints are holy things, being the members of the Holy Ghost.

The bodies of the Martyrs are precious things, whereby the truth of the
Gospel was sealed: yet by these we cannot be sanctified in the sight of God,
because there was sin in them. Hearing of Sermons, prayers, and alms deeds,
are all of them testimonies of our sanctification, and by them we make our
calling and election sure. We have an inherent, sanctification in us, after we
be regenerate, but that is lame and imperfect: there is nothing that can
perfectly sanctify us, that we may appear without blame before God, save the
offering up of the body of the Lord Jesus. He is made to us wisdom,
righteousness, sanctification -- Therefore let us entreat the Lord, to give us
a true and lively faith, whereby we may apply Christ and his merits to our
selves, that being sanctified by him, and made clean through his blood, we may
enter into the holy Jerusalem in the life to come.

VERSE 11.
FOr there were many of them: of what sort and condition so ever.

Stands: as a Servitour at the Altar.

For some thing or other was done every day: there was the morning and evening
sacrifice.

For the public good of the people, being the Minister of them all.

One time would not serve the turn, as it does with Christ.

The sacrifices in special, were Bulls, Goats, Sheep, etc. yet often
iterated.

Never: no hope of it.

(...): fully and utterly, as they ought to be, so as they never trouble the
consciences of men again: they were a recordation of sin, but no a motion of
sin.

No Priest was exempted from service. In the Church of Rome peradventure the
inferior Priests, the Parish Priests take some pains among the people. But
the Pope, the High Priest, the Cardinals, and those that are called Majores
sacerdotes, live at ease: some of them, they are minstred unto; but we must
all minister in those places, wherein God has set us, that we may enter into
the joy of our Master in the life to come.

The Angels are ministering spirits, and shall we think scorn to minister?

2. We must no day be idle, but daily serve God in our several functions
whether we be Ministers or people: pass the days of your dwelling here in
fear. As we ask our daily bread at Gods hands: so we must daily perform
service to God. Daniel prayed three times a day. Anna served God in prayers day
and night. The Bereans turned over the Bible daily: every day let us do
something whereby God may be glorified.

3. As the Priests in the time of the Law offered up the same sacrifices: So
let us the same sacrifice of prayer, of preaching, of praise and thankesgiving,
of alms deeds and the works of mercy. So long as we tarry in the world, let
us always be offering up these spiritual sacrifices: though they be the
same, yet they are acceptable to God.

No more can any thing that we can do now. CHRIST JESUS alone is the Lamb of
God that takes away the sins of the world.

VERSE 12.
But He, that is Jesus Christ our Priest: he being but one is opposed to them
that were many. He could do more than all they, put together.

Not many, as they did: one specie and numero too.

For the expiation of sins: which those sacrifices could not take away.

There be four things that commend this sacrifice.

1. Sufficientia, quoad precium. 2. Efficacia, contra peccatum. 3. Gloria,
quoad praemium. 4. Victoria, quoad adversarium.
He does not stand as they did. Stare est famulorum: sedere dominorum.

Not at the Altar here on earth: but at the right hand of God in heaven.

Not for a time, as those Priests continued their time, and then went away, but
for ever.

Some join (...), to that which goes before: after he had offered one
sacrifice for sins for ever, the virtue whereof lasts for ever.

God has no right hand nor left: but as Kings cause them that be nearest, and
dearest unto them to sit at their right hand; so Christ -- He is in equal
Majesty with his father. After the offering up of this one sacrifice, he offers
no more as a Priest: but reigns as a King for ever.

There must be no iteration of this sacrifice. The Papists allege, that the
sacrifice of the Mass is the same with that on the Cross. Suppose it were,
yet it must be but once offered. Those in the Law were often offered: but this
must be but once offered: otherwise the whole disputation of the HOLY GHOST in
this Epistle is overthrown.

What does he now? he does not now play the Carpenter: he takes no more pains
in preaching, in suffering as he did here: but he sits quietly in all joy and
happiness at the right hand of God.

Acts 7.55. Christ appeared to Stephen standing: but that was for the
strengthening and encouraging of him against the rage of his enemies. He stood
up ready to take him out of their claws into the kingdom of heaven:
otherwise, for the most part the Scripture, introduces Christ sitting, as it
were in his regal throne at the right hand of God, next in glory, power and
Majesty to God the Father, yea equal with him in all things.

1. This may be a comfort to us against all our adversaries. The King and
Protector of the Church sits at the right hand of God in heaven. The
Universities choose them to be their Chancellours, which are in greatest favor
with the King, and most gracious in the Court: so do incorporations choose the
like to be their high stewards, that may stand them instead in the time of
need: He that has the protection of us is a great man in the Court of heaven:
He sits at the right hand of God, he has all power in heaven and earth.
Therefore let not us fear, that are under his wings: he will not suffer us to
want the thing that is good.

2. As CHRIST now sits in heaven, after all the miseries, crosses and
afflictions, which he sustained on the earth: so when this wretched life is
ended, we shall be in heaven with Christ, Ep. 2.6. Let this encourage us to a
patient suffering of all calamities in this world. We may have a tragedy here,
but a comedy hereafter: worme-wood here, and honey there. Blessed are the dead
which dye in the Lord, they rest from their labors, and shall remain in
heaven with Christ for ever.

VERSE 13.
IT might be interpreted: and expects the remnant. As he himself the head of
the Church is in heaven: so he expects the coming of his members to him.

Or, from henceforth waits, that is, the accomplishment of the number of his
elect, which God the Father has given to him.

He comes down no more into the earth, to offer any sacrifice for sin* but
remaining in heaven still, he patiently abides. Then let us wait.

The footstool of his feet.

Donec imports a continuation of time.

Sin, the Devil and his instruments, death it self.

If Christ tarrieth for us, shall not we tarry for him? Luke 12.36. 2 Pet.
3.12. The souls of the Saints that lay under the Altar, cried, how long Lord?
-- but this answer was returned to them, that they should rest for a little
season, until their fellow servants and brethren were fulfilled, Apoc. 6.10,
11. The patient abiding of the poor shall not perish for ever. Let us by
patience and long suffering pass through the sea of afflictions in this world,
that we may be with Christ in the haven of eternal happiness in the world to
come. Let us tarry for him, till the breath be out of our bodies, and let our
flesh rest in hope till the day of judgment.

2. This phrase does signify the greatest and basest part of subjection, that
can be. Joshua made the men of War to set their feet on the necks of the
Kings that fought against them, Ios. 10.24. Adonibezeck made them, whom he
subdued, to gather crumbes under his table, Iud. 1.7. The Psalmist says of the
enemies of Christ, they shall lick the dust under his feet, and Romans 16.20.
The God of peace shall tread Satan under our feet. I will lay thee at my
foot, we are wont to say. Now as they shall be Christ's footstool: so our
footstool too. We shall be conquerours, yea more than Conquerours by him that
loved us: but this full and complete victory shall not be till the day of
judgment, when death the last enemy of all, shall be subdued. In the mean
season, while we be here, we must look to have our enemies on our top, to spit
on our face, to smite us as they did Christ, to make long furrows on our
backs, to offer us the greatest indignity that can be: but let us be of good
comfort, the time shall come, when they shall be our footstool to their
everlasting shame; and we shall be as Kings with crowns on our heads and
palms in our hands for ever and ever.

VERSE 14.
THere is great reason he should sit still at the right hand of God in heaven:
because with one offering he has perfected, that is, has gigiven them all
things that were requisite, reconciliation, remission of sins, sanctification,
redemption. Not for a time, but for ever.

Not all the world in general, but those that are sanctified: they that
remain dogs and swine still, have no benefit by this sacrifice; but those that
are sanctified, Ephesians. 1.4. 1 Cor. 6.11.

All have not benefit by the sacrifice of our Savior Christ: only they that
are sanctified, Acts. 20.32. This is the will of God, even your sanctification.
If we be not sanctified, we shall never set a foot into the kingdom of
heaven: Dogs, Enchanters, Whoremongers are without. Follow peace and
holiness, without which no man shall see GOD. Hebr. 12.14.
Except a man be borne of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God, Ioh. 3.5. Such were some of you, but ye are sanctified, etc.
1 Cor. 6.11. This is little considered of us. We falsely imagine, that we may
wallow like swine in the mire of our sins, and yet go to heaven, when we
dye. That cannot be. None are perfected by the offering of CHRIST, but they
that are sanctified. If thou remainest a covetous miser still, and be not
sanctified from thy covetousness; if thou continuest a drunkard, still, and
art not sanctified from thy drunkenness, if thou dwell in thy fornication
and adultery still, and be not sanctified from these sins; If thou be a
proud man still, and art not sanctified from thy pride, to have a lowly opinion
of thy self, thou shall never have any comfort by the oblation of CHRIST. We
must be Saints in some measure while we are here on the earth, or else we
shall never be Saints in heaven hereafter. Paul writes to them that are
sanctified, 1 Cor. 1.1. Therefore let us entreat the Lord to sanctify us in
soul, spirit and body throughout, that we may enter into the holy Jerusalem
in the life to come.

VERSE 15.
FOr the HOLY GHOST testifies this also to us, 2 Pet. 1.21.

For after he had said before: these are the words of the Apostle, making a
collection out of the Prophet.

He does not say, for Jeremy bears us witness: 2 Timothy 3.16.
but the Holy Ghost -- The whole Scripture was given by inspiration from God:
it was inspired by the Holy Ghost, 2 Pet. 1.21.

The HOLY GHOST speaks in the books of Moses, in the Psalms and in the
Prophets: in the writings of the Evangelists, in the Epistles of the Apostles
-- and in all the rest. In other writings men speak, but in the Scripture GOD
Almighty speaks: therefore how reverently are they to be read and heard of
us? we that be the Preachers speak, yet it is not we, but the Spirit of GOD
that speaks in us: the HOLY GHOST speaks by the mouth of all his servants:
therefore let us take heed how we resist the Holy Ghost.

VERSE 16.
AFter he had promised a New Covenant instead of the Old.

After those days: namely, of the old Testament: those being expired.

Then says the Lord, concerning the New Covenant that was promised.

Two things: Renovation, and Remission of sins, Verse 17.

God does not promise to put his laws in our eyes, that we might look on
them; in our mouths, that we might talk of them; or on the fringes of our
garments, as the Pharisees had the Law of God: but if we fear Him, He will
put his laws into our hearts, that the heart, being possessed with the Law of
God, it may set the tongue and all the members of the body on work.

VERSE 17.
NEither the guilt, nor punishment of them.

This testimony was cited Chapter 8. to prove that there was a New Covenant to
abolish the Old. Here it is alleged to prove that remission of sins is
effected by the sacrifice of Christ in the New Testament, which was only
figured out by the sacrifices of the Old Testament: So that one and the same
Scripture may be applied to diverse purposes.

The foundation, whereupon the remission of sins promised by God was built, was
the sacrifice of Christ in the New Testament: otherwise this testimony should
not be alleged to purpose.

That which we mind to punish we will remember. I remember Amalek, said the
Lord. A master being displeased with his servant says, 1 Samuel 15.2.
I will remember you anon: but God will not remember our sins, he will raze
them out of the book of his remembrance. An happy turn for us! for if he
should remember but one sin against us, it were sufficient to cast us into
hell. As God remembers not our sins: So let not us remember the injuries, done
to us. Joseph would not revenge himself on his brethren, for the injury, they
intended against him, and practiced, but remitted: so Christ forgot the cruelty
that his persecutors used toward him, Mat. 18.3. All good turns let us
remember: but as for all wrongs, let them be forgotten for ever.

Why will he not remember our sins any more? Surely because his Son Christ
Jesus has dyed for our sins, and offered himself for them: him that knew no
sin he made to be sin, for us; therefore he will remember our sins no more. To
that purpose is this testimony alleged in this place.

VERSE 18.
WHereupon he infers this conclusion.

Of these things, that is of sins and iniquities is.

There may be spiritual oblations and sacrifices of prayer, thankesgiving,
and alms deeds, Hebr. 13.17. but there remains no more offering for the
expiation of sins.

If all sins be forgiven for the one oblation, that Christ has offered,
there needs no more offering for sin: but for the worthiness of that one
oblation all sins are forgiven us: Ergo, there needs no more offering for sin.

Object. There is no more sacrifice for sin than that of Christ's. As for the
Mass, it is the same sacrifice that Christ offered on the Cross, therefore
that may still remain as propitiatory for sin.

Sol. 1. It is not the same: for Christ's body is in heaven, there he tarryes
still: Verse 13. and Act. 3.21. therefore it is not in the sacrifice of the
Mass here on earth, for that cause it is not the same sacrifice, that was on
the cross.

2. Here it is (...), not (...). That was bloody: this unbloudy. Which differ
as much as light and darkness, death and life: and if unbloudy, then no
remission of sins in it, Hebr. 9.22.

3. If Christ be offered in the Mass, then he must suffer there, Hebr. 9.26.
but he does not suffer there, ergo.

4. If CHRIST be there offered, then he is there consumed: for sacrificabile
must be destructibile, as Bellarmine confesses; and in all sacrifices there is
a consumption of the thing sacrificed, the Goat, the Sheep, the Heyfer was
consumed: and Christ was consumed or destroyed on the Cross: he is not
destroyed in the Mass: ergo, he is not in the sacrifice of the Mass.

Yes, says Bellarmine, he is destroyed sacramentally, because he is eaten by
the Priest, though not physically and really.

I but in a sacrifice there must be a physical and real destruction of the
thing sacrificed, otherwise no sacrifice.

Again, a repetition of the same sacrifice is here excluded. If CHRIST must
be offered up often, then that one offering on the Cross was insufficient for
the taking away of sin, but the Apostle proves that CHRIST was to be offered
but once. If he be offered up often, it is an indignity to him: for so were the
sacrifices in the Law. The Mass I conclude still is no propitiatory sacrifice.

Here we have a most sweet and comfortable doctrine: by the offering of our
SAVIOR CHRIST we obtain remission of sins: his blood purges us from all sin.
In sin we are warmed in our Mothers belly, in sin we were conceived and borne.
We suck sin as milk from our mothers breasts: before we be regenerate,
we do nothing but sin, draw sin with Cartropes, and iniquity with the
cords of vanity. After we are regenerate, In many things we sin all.

The just man falls seven times a day. If God should enter into judgment
with us for our sins, we were not able to answer one for a thousand. We sin in
preaching, praying, hearing, our best sort of actions are defiled with sin. But
here is our comfort, by the oblation of Jesus Christ on the Cross once made
we have remission of all our sins. In so much as we may say, death where is
thy sting? Let us desire the Lord to apply this oblation of Christ to us by a
true and lively faith.

And as by CHRIST alone we have the forgiveness of our sins, which all the
sacrifices in the Law could not purchase, nor any thing that we can do under
the Gospel: so let the love of Christ in dying for our sins cause us to dye to
sin daily more and more: and as he in wonderful love offered up himself as
a sacrifice for the putting away of our sins: so let us offer up our selves,
our souls and bodies, as a holy, living and acceptable sacrifice to him all
the days of our lives; that the power of Christ's passion appearing in us in
this world; we may reign with him in the world to come.

Analysis.
Now he makes an application of that discourse he had of Christ.



The doctrine has three branches.

1. Our entrance into heaven. 2. The way whereby we enter, Verse 20. 3. Our
guide and leader in the way, Verse 21.
In our entrance, 1. The manner of it.

2. The place whereinto we enter.

3. The means whereby.



1. For his office, he is a Priest.

great.

3. For his dominion, over the house of God.

The use is threefold.

1. An appropinquation to God, Verse 22. 2. A profession of God. 23. 3. A
declaration of it: by provoking one another. 24.
Ex part subjecti. 2. Ex part formae. 3. Ex part medij. Internal, external.

Our profession must be held fast.

Where, 1. How. 2. Why.

In the provocation. 1. How it must be done, with consideration. To what we
must provoke.

VERSE 19.
1. WE must make a profitable use of all doctrines propounded to us.
Explication.


The High Priest in the time of the Law could not enter into the Sanctum
Sanctorum, without blood, Hebr. 9.7. no more can we into heaven: he entered
by the blood of a Goat and an Heyfer: we by the blood of Jesus, Act. 20.28.

We have boldness of entrance into the holy places.

How? Thieves enter into an house: so do sacrilegious persons into a Church,
but it is with quaking and trembling, least they should be apprehended, because
they have no right of entering: we enter boldly into the sanctuary of heaven,
because we have a right to it by Jesus Christ.

Not to see it afar off on an hill, as Moses did the land of Ca^an: but to
enter into it.

Into what? Into the holy places, which is expounded to be heaven, Hebr. 9.24.

In the time of the Law none but the High Priest went into the Holy of Holies,
and that but once a year: here all, both Ministers and people, Magistrates and
subjects, high and low, rich and poor, all that believe in Christ, have
entrance into heaven. We may be bold by prayer to enter into it in this life:
Hebr. 4.16.
and in soul and body we shall have a comfortable entrance into it in the life
to come.

None but Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber may enter into the King: we may all
go to the King of Kings, and that boldly, because we are reconciled to him by
Jesus Christ.

What a singular prerogative is this, that we which are but dust and ashes,
should have an entrance, yea a bold entrance into heaven? None, that wore
sackcloth might enter into Ahasuerus palace: Hest. 4.2.
though we be never so poorly attyred, so as we believe in Christ, we may
enter into the palace of heaven. Every one may not enter into the Kings Privy
Chamber; none but great states and those admitted by the Grooms and Gentlemen
of the Chamber: all of us that are engraffed into CHRIST, may go boldly into
the Privy Chamber of the King of Kings. David said of the kingdom of Judea;
what am I, and what is my fathers house, that he has brought me hitherto? So
we may say, what are we, or what were our fathers, that we should come into the
holy place of heaven?

By prayer we may be bold to enter into it in this life: and if we send up any
prayers to heaven, let us do it boldly in the name and mediation of Jesus
Christ. At our dying day our souls may boldly enter into heaven: there will be
none to stay them. If one offer but to go into the Chamber of presence, some
of the guard will be ready to put us back: but here the Angels, Gods guard in
heaven will be ready to receive us, and to carry us into heaven, as they did
Lazarus. At the day of judgment we may be bold to enter in soul and body,
because CHRIST will meet us in the air, and translate us into it with
himself. Therefore let us magnify God for this our sweet and comfortable
entrance, and that with boldness into the holy place of heaven.

2. By whom, or by what means have we an entrance into heaven?

Not by the blood of Thomas, of Peter, of all the Martyrs in the world put
together, not by any inherent righteousness, that is in our souls, not by the
merit and dignity, of our prayers, fastings, alms deeds, and other works, but
by the blood of Jesus alone. If CHRIST had not shed his blood for us, we could
never have entered into heaven. O the wonderful love of the Lord Jesus! Let
this constrain us to love him again, to count nothing too dear for him, no
not our own blood, if he will have it, for the confirmation of his truth and
Gospel.

3. Here we see that Heaven is an holy place: they that be unholy cannot
enter into it: dogs, enchanters, etc. are without. We are all by nature
unholy, such were some of you, 1 Cor. 6. etc. Therefore let us entreat the LORD
to make us holy in some measure in this life, that we may enter into this holy
Jerusalem in the life to come.

VERSE 20.
SOme might say, thou speak of our entrance into heaven, but which is the
way that leads to it? He that goes to London, must go by a way: and there
must be a way to carry us to heaven. That he points out with the finger:
this way is the sacred and undefiled flesh of our Savior Christ, wherein he
paid the price of our redemption.

Which is here resembled to a veil. His flesh is called a veil, says
Gorrhan, quia sub velamine specierum sumitur in viaticum. The High Priest went
into the Holy of Holies by a veil, and so by the flesh of CHRIST we go to
heaven. As the veil covered the mysteries, that were in the Holy of Holies,
and hid them from the people: so the flesh and humanity of our Savior Christ
covered his deity: in that his deity was hid and concealed from the world,
though it was manifested by his works, speeches, and actions.

This was for the qualities.

1. A new way. (...), or of (...) and (...) occido: that which is newly killed.
It fittly agrees to the flesh or body of our SAVIOR CHRIST, that was lately
killed for our sins. But it is put for any new thing whatsoever, as (...), a
new opinion.

It is not called a new way, because it was now newly found out, never heard of
or known before: for Abraham saw this way a great while ago, and went into
heaven by it. So did all the faithful in the time of the Law.

But it is called a new way, because it was now newly manifested to the world
being before obscured under types and figures. 2. New things retain their
vigor and strength, whereas old things wither away. This is always a fresh
and a new way: the power thereof shall never be dried up. 3. New things are
acceptable to men: a new Preacher shall be heard more attentively then an old:
this is a new way, therefore let it be welcome to us all. 4. It may be termed a
new way, because none but they, that be new men, new creatures in Christ Jesus,
can tread in this way.

A living way. It is improperly adscribed to a way: yet it is emphaticall.

1. So called, because it is opposed to the dead way in the time of the Law.
There the High Priest went into the Holy of Holies by the blood of beasts, that
were dead, when they were sacrificed: our Savior Christ was sacrificed alive.
2. This way is ever living and remaining for men to enter into heaven by. Some
ways dye and cannot be seen: this way lives to be seen of all the faithful
to the worlds end. 3. It leads to life: therefore it may be termed a living
way. 4. They that take this way shall live for ever.

So Christ is called living water, Ioh. 4.

This way has Christ dedicated for us: he has gone it in his own person,
that we may be bold to follow him in it, Ioh. 14.2. All Antisthenes Scholars
had new books, pens, writing tables: and here is a new way for all Christ's
Disciples.

He has renewed it again: that is the force of the word. It was in the time
of the Law, and the Fathers trod in it: but it was renewed by Christ at his
death.

The Jesuits gather from hence, that none went this way before Christ. But
when the Temple was dedicated, it was before: So this way now dedicated by our
Savior Christ, was before, though not so conspicuous, as it is now.

CHRIST alone is the way to heaven. I am the way, the truth, and the life: no
man comes to the Father but by me. Then in what a woeful case are they that
be out of this way? Turks, Jews, and all that profess the name of Christ,
but blaspheme it? Surely they must needs be in the high way to Hell. Yea and
also a number besides that will have Christ to be but the half way to heaven?
He is one part of the way, and their works are the other part. A way is for
men to walk in: so in Christ and by Christ we must walk to the heavenly
Jerusalem. Let us keep this way with all diligence, that we may get to heaven.

VERSE 21.
I But this is a thorny and rugged way, full of many dangers, how shall we
pass through it? Christ himself will be our leader in it. As he is both the
sacrifice, and the Priest: so he is the way, and the guide the way.

He does not say, an High Priest, but simply a Priest, because there is no
other sacrificing Priest, save CHRIST, in the New Testament.

Not a small one, but a great one: great in person, being God and man: great in
power, for heaven and earth are his: great in goodness and mercy, that will
have compassion on our weakness, and if we happen to faint, he will support us
by the way.

For his superiority and pre-eminence, over the house of God, that is, the
Church, 1 Timothy 3.15. Heb. 3.6. Moses was over the house of God, yet as a
servant, Hebr. 3.5. Christ as the Lord and King, the commander in the house: he
over a part of Gods house in Judea; Christ over the whole house dispersed over
all the earth.

Matthew. 24.45.
All Ministers in some sort are over the house of God: Who is a faithful
servant, that his Lord may make rule over his house? that be over you in the
Lord, 1 These. 5.12. So Moses was over the house. Yet a great difference
between them and Christ. A noble man is over his house: and his steward is
over his house. Christ as the Lord and owner of the house: we as his stewards,
to give you your meat in due season.

A singular comfort to all that be of this house, that such a one as Christ is
over it! Some houses have tyrannical governors, which scrape all to
themselves and have no care of them in the house. Christ is not such a one: he
has a loving and fatherly care of all in the house. Some householders would
provide for their house and cannot, they want ability: Christ Jesus, that is
over this house, is both able and willing to provide all things necessary for
us. Therefore let us be of good comfort, we shall not want the thing that is
good.

The Church is God's house. All England is the Kings dominion: White Hall is
his Chapel: so all the world is Gods empire, but the Church is his house:
therefore let us behave our selves wisely and religiously in the house of God.
Will any make the Kings house and Alehouse to quaffe and swill in? A
brothel-house to commit adultery in? and shall we, that be in the Church, the
house of God, be drunkards, adulterers, wicked and lascivious livers? As we
be in Gods house, so let us demean our selves accordingly.

VERSE 22.
HAving such a wise, loving and mighty Priest, let us come unto (...), namely;
to God by him, Heb. 4.16.
by the invocation of his name, asking boldly all things necessary for this
life, and the life to come: as also let us draw near to him by an holy life
and blameless conversation. They that make an outward profession, and deny him
in their lives, are far from him: the others are near, and walk with God,
as Enoch.

Some interpret it, Let us draw near to that heavenly Sanctuary, which is
opened to us, whereunto we draw near with a true heart.

But especially this is to be understood of prayer.

This drawing near is not so much with the feet of our bodies, as with the
feet of our souls. The way whereunto, is chalked out to us, and wherein our
High Priest directs us: for it must have relation to all that went before.
Now we draw near to heaven by prayer and an holy life.

A true heart] void of hypocrisy and dissimulation: for God hears not
hypocrites, though they make never so goodly a show, and have never so glorious
words.

2. An assured faith: which purifieth our hearts, Act. 15.9. there must be no
doubting in faith, Iac* 1.6.

Though thou be as tall a man as Saul, yet thou art not the nearer to
heaven: but if thou sendest many prayers to heaven, and have thy conversation
in heaven, then thou drawest near to heaven.

Being sprinkled, (...), according to our hearts, from an evil conscience.
There was a sprinckling water in the time of the Law, made of the ashes of the
red Cow, wherewith the people were sprinkled, Number. 19.9. their bodies were
sprinkled with that; but our souls must be sprinkled with the blood of
Christ.

From an accusing conscience, that our sins are washed away in the blood of
Christ. We should have no more conscience of sin, Heb. 10.2. our consciences
should no longer prick us for sin: because being justified by faith we have
peace with God, and there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
This afterward breeds sanctification, 1 Pet. 1.2.

There be many false-hearted wretches in the world, such as Judas was, that
kissed Christ, and betrayed him at the same time: there be many that pretend
love to religion, and yet have none in them, such were those, Ezekiel. 14.1. Such
were the Pharisees, whited tombs and painted Sepulchers, such were the
Sadduces, that came with a notable gloss to our Savior Christ: and there is a
number of Hypocrites at this day, that mask under the Vizard of Religion. He
that made the heart, knows the heart, and will one day discover them to their
shame.

Therefore if we draw near to God, let it be with a true heart, least he say
to us, as to them, this people draws near to me with their lips, but
their hearts are far from me. If we be falsehearted men, though we carry
never so glorious a show, God cannot abide us: but if we be true-hearted men,
though there be many weaknesses and infirmities in us, he will accept us in
Christ Jesus. Behold a true Israelite, said Christ of Nathaneel. There be true
Israelites, and false; false clothes, glasses, clockes, etc.

Faith is like the Moon, sometimes at the full, sometimes in the wane. But
seeing Christ has merited our salvation: God has promised for Christ's sake
to bestow a kingdom on us: therefore let us not doubt of it. That is to doubt
of the sufficiency of Christ's merit, and of the Word of God.

How shall we come to this full assurance? If our hearts be sprinkled from an
evil conscience, by the blood of Christ. By nature have we all bad
consciences, accusing us for sin. In many things we sin all. All those
sins lie as an heavy load on our consciences, and make us to cry out, o my
sins! they will not suffer me to be quiet day nor night: but being
sprinkled in our hearts, with the blood of CHRIST, we shall no more be vexed
with the sting of an evil conscience, because Christ has dyed for all our
sins. Happy are they that be thus sprinkled.

Our hearts being sprinkled from an evil conscience, our bodies must be
washed with pure water. It is not enough to have a good soul to God-wards,
though that is the chief, but our bodies also must be washed with the pure
water of the HOLY GHOST. Our eyes must be washed from unchaste looks: our ears
from rash receiving of reports one against another: our hands from
covetousness, theft and rapine: our feet from going to unlawful places: our
tongues from reviling, lying, backe-biting, slandering. St. Peter at the first
refused to have his feet washed by CHRIST; but when he understood the mystery
of it, he cried, Lord, not my feet alone, but my hands and my head, Ioh.
13.9. So let us entreat Christ to wash all the faculties of our souls, and all
the members of our body with this pure water, that so we may reign with him
for ever.

VERSE 23.
STill he alludeth to the rites and ceremonies of the Law, Hebr. 9.10.

And washed according to the body.

We must be washed in soul, before we can be washed in body; but he makes a
special mention of the washing of the body, because it was more conspicuous,
and because he now comes to an outward profession of the name of GOD, which
must be declared by our bodies.

Some interpret this of baptism, which is the washing of the new birth, Tit.
3. but they were baptized already, and admitted into the Church, and fellowship
of the faithful, which some relinquished, Verse 25. Therefore he need not bid
them draw near by baptism.

Rather it is to be understood of the HOLY GHOST, who is often in Scripture
signified by water, Ezekiel. 36.25. Ioh. 3.5. This is pure water indeed,
proceeding from a pure and holy spirit: this surpasses all the waters in the
Law, whereof they were figures.

Let us keep it with all our strength, tooth and nail. Let neither Satan, nor
any of his instruments, let no boisterous winds of stormy persequutions drive
us from it. It is not (...), but (...). Keep it, so as we loose it not: he
does not simply say, hope, but the confession of it. Let us be ready to make
an open profession of the hope, we have by Christ, before all men whatsoever.

Not inclining one while this way, another while that way, but keeping always
one and perpetual tenor, Matthew 10. verse 32. Romans 10.10.

Not leaning on our own wit, wisdom or strength: but upon the fidelity of
God. He that has promised to us eternal salvation by Christ, will accomplish
it: therefore let us hold fast the profession of the hope which we have in him.

If we had the word of a man only, we might be wavering: but we have the
Word of God: he does not directly say God, but he describes him by his
attribute.

Many are washed with the water of baptism, that are not washed with this
water: as Simon Magus, of whom it is said, font quidem lotus, sed non in
pectore mundus: except a man be borne of this water, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God. Therefore let us entreat the Lord to wash us with this water:
Let us say with the woman of Samaria, yet more sensibly than she did: Lord,
ever give us of this water: then shall we be clean and fit for the Holy
Jerusalem.

It is not enough to have hope as a precious jewel locked up in the Chest of
our hearts, but we must also make a profession of it before the world, Romans
10.10. 1 Pet. 3.15. We must profess before all men, that we look for
salvation by CHRIST, and by no other. Whatsoever come of it we must keep this
our profession. What went ye out into the wilderness to see? a reed shaken
with the wind? we must not be wavering Reeds, but Stones built on the Rock
CHRIST JESUS: we must not be as meteors hanging in the air between heaven and
earth: we must not halt between two religions: we must not be wavering which
way to take; whether to be Papists, Familists, Schismatickes, or of no
religion: but we must hold fast the profession of true religion to the end.
When many of Christ's Disciples departed from him, he said to the twelve, will
ye also go away? to whom should we go, says, St. Peter? Let us stick to
CHRIST, and go to none but him.

There be two things that hinder it: fear and shame.

Of the former we have an evident example, Ioh. 12.42. Many of the chief
rulers believed in Christ: but because of the Pharisees they did not confess
him, least they should be put out of the Synagogue. Men in times of
persequution are afraid to loose their goods, honor, liberty, life: it is good
sleeping in an whole skin. This terrifies them from any open profession of
the name of CHRIST. But let such remember, that the fearful are the first,
that have their portion in the lake -- Apoc. 21.8. Let nothing drive us from
the profession of CHRIST our SAVIOR: let us not fear them that can kill the
body, but Him, that can cast body and soul into hell fire. This caveat is
needful in some places and time.

The other is shame. CHRIST is poor in this world, the Gospel is sometimes
naked, destitute of wealth and honor, many afflictions attend on it, the
professors of it sometimes thrust to the walls. In Iulians time none of the
Christians were Captains, or had any office: this makes many ashamed of it. If
the father be a poor man, many a son is ashamed of him, ashamed to own him
for his father: so because the profession of CHRIST in some places has nothing
to grace it withal, sundry are ashamed of it: but Saint Paul says, I am not
ashamed of the Gospel of CHRIST. Men will hold fast their purses: and shall
they not hold fast their profession of CHRIST? Let us not be ashamed of
CHRIST, how contemptible so ever he seem to be, lest he be ashamed of us,
before his father and his glorious Angels.

Why, what should move us to it?

The Papists will have two pillars for hope to lean upon; gratia Dei, and
merita praecedentia: sine meritis sperare aliquid non spes, sed praesumptio
est. I but the grace and mercy of GOD is a sufficient pillar alone by it self:
the Apostle says not, keep the profession of your hope; ye have many merits;
ye shall never fall; but keep it, let no persequution remove you from it: for
he is faithful that has promised. You are weak, you stand to day, and fall
to morrow; your enemies are many and mighty, and there is no strength in you to
resist them: yet hold fast your hope; for God is faithful. In him there is not
so much as a shadow of turning. We are unfaithful, we promise and unpromise.
It is not so with him. I know whom I have believed. I have fought a good fight:
from henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of righteousness. In all assaults
and temptations, let us not look to our own weakness, for then we may
stagger, but to the promise of God, and then we may be sure: for as he has
promised us a kingdom, so he will perform it. Therefore let us hold the
profession of our hope.

VERSE 24.
LEt us set our minds one on another. Consider what their growth is in Christ,
what progress they have made in Christianity.

Not to envy them that be adorned with better gifts then we, nor to contemn
them that have lesser: to check them by their wants and infirmities, to pry
into them with a curious eye: but to the whetting and sharpening one of
another: to be as spurs and whetstones one to another.

To love, the badge of Christians, Gal. 5.6.

And to good works. It is no love that has no good works, 1 Ioh. 3.18.

This stirring up of our brethren must not be done rashly or unadvisedly, but
with due advice and wise consideration: therefore says he, consider one
another. First we must consider,then provoke: we must diligently consider when
we come to the performance of this duty.

We must consider in what case our brother is touching his soul, whether he
lie in ignorance or not? Whether he go forward or backward, whether he be
cold in his profession or not? As we find his wants, so we must make supply by
a godly provoking of him. We will consider one another wealth, how many fair
houses he has, how much land he purchases, how many clothes he makes: and
if he be before us in the world, we envy him. We will consider one another
to do our neighbor a mischief, if we can, to sit on his skirts at one time
or another: as Saul had an eye to David, and the Pharisees watched our Savior
Christ. But we will not consider one another, to further them toward the
kingdom of heaven.

The end of our consideration must be to provoke to goodness. First to love,
as the fountain, then to good works, as the streams flowing from it: Faith
that works by love: no love, no faith. Gal. 5.6.
If ye be my Disciples, love one another: he that hates is a manslayer. We
must say, you are members of the same body whereof Christ is the head:
therefore love you one another.

Abraham said to Lot, I pray thee, let there be no strife between us, for we
be brethren. So let one neighbor say to another, let no strife be among us,
for we are brethren in the LORD JESUS. We have one faith, baptism SAVIOR, one
inheritance, one Father: therefore let us love one another. If this were
practiced by us, there would not be such heart burning between neighbor and
neighbor, such uncharitable suspicions, such brawlings and contentions, even
about trifling matters, as there be. Many are so far from provoking to love,
as that they kindle the fire of contention, and sow the seed of discord and
variance where they dwell.

Iac. 2.16.
Now love is not without good works. No good works, no love, 1 Ioh. 3.18. Let
us not love in word, neither in tongue only, but in deed and in truth. We must
provoke one another to be pitiful to the poor, to be liberal to all good
uses, to adorn the Gospel by good works. The woman of Samaria said to her
townsmen, come go with me, and I will show you the Messiah: So must we go
to our neighbors and say; come let us go to Church and hear Divine Service
and Sermon. Let us carry our servants with us. Let us go together about the
town. Let us see in what estate the poor be, who wants bread, meat,
clothes, lodging, etc. Let us go to the Alehouses and other suspected places,
and see what disorders there be there. Let us reproove drunkenness, let us
compel them that be idle to fall to work, and to get their bread with the
sweat of their brows. Let us see harlots and adulterers punished, that are a
disgrace to the town. Come, let us not be so glewed to our money, let us give
cheerfully to the preaching of the word, and to all good uses. Oh that this
were practiced by us, that we had some sounding bells and trumpets in the parish
to toll on one another to the kingdom of heaven! especially if the chief men
and women in a town, which are the bell-weathers of the flock, if they would
show themselves to be good fore-horses, what a number might they draw after
them? Monica Augustins mother said, volemus in coelos. o that we were like
her! Pro. 27.17.
iron sharpeneth iron, so does man sharpen the face of his friend: Let us
sharpen one another to good works; that we may say at the day of judgment,
here am I, and the neighbors thou have given me.

But I would to God there were not some, that draw backwards, that pull their
neighbors from love and good works. Will thou give to the Preacher, will thou
be so forward in town matters? thou shall get nothing by it. These are
wretched men, and are to answer for the spoiling of themselves and others at
the day of judgment. Strengthen thy brethren, said Christ to St. Peter, Luke
22.32. So we must comfort and exhort our brethren, Romans 16.3. They were no
Ministers, yet St. Paul calls them his fellow helpers, because they did help
on their brethren, they helped on Apollos, Act. 18.26. The thief on the Cross
would have provoked his fellow to love and good works. Fear thou not God?
and shall we be worse than he? Let us stir up one another: have thou no fear
of God, no love to religion? They that convert many, shall shine as the Sun
in the kingdom of heaven: not minister only, but all others, that are the
means of the conversion of any. It belongs to all to save souls, Iac. 5. ult.
We are not borne for our selves alone, as the heathen could say: it was the
bad speech of wicked Cain, am I my brothers keeper? I verily, thou art thy
brothers keeper, and if he perish through thy default, thou shall answer for
him at the latter day. Therefore let us provoke one another to all good duties
in this present world, that we may al one with another, live with CHRIST our
blessed Savior in the world to come.

VERSE 25.
THe gathering together unto, that is, to Jesus Christ, 2 These. 2.1

We must not shut up selves in Cloisters with monks, nor with Diogenes in a
tun. We must love the company of the Saints. All our delight must be in
them. Especially we must beware how we forsake the public assemblies, where
is the word and Sacraments, with the joint prayers of the Church.

Some did it in the Primitive Church for fear of the enemies, loath to join
with them for fear of loosing their goods, honors, life, liberty.

And now some forsake them in pride and in an high conceit of themselves depart
from us, we are holyer than you.

As it is some men's custom. A bad custom: yet he names them not.

Call one to another.

And by so much the rather, as ye see that day drawing near.

We have not a long time to exhort in: therefore let us exhort.

That day, which in Scripture is called the day of the Lord: when we shall be
rewarded for our well doing, and they punished, that contemn our exhortations,
Luke 21.34.

Ye see with your own eyes by plain and evident tokens, it is near at hand.

The meetings of Christians are private or public: Political, or
Ecclesiastical. Even civil meetings about the affairs of the town, where
God has set us, are with care and conscience to be kept: as also the meetings
at the houses one of another for the increase of love: have ye not houses to
eat and drink in? 1 Cor. 11.22
He likes it well that we should meet in our houses, he gives us a license
for that: nay, he forbids us not to go to the house of an infidel: 1 Cor.
10.27.
and ye will go -- Surely they that live wholly to themselves, that will not
come at their neighbors house, nor bid any to theirs, that will neither be
feastmakers, nor feast-takers; they are guilty of the breach of good
fellowship. Either they be cynicall Diogenes's: or greedy and miserable Nabals,
that love to make feasts for none but for themselves. We must not be Epicures,
ever feasting, faring deliciously every day, with the rich Glutton; neither
must we be (...) haters of all good fellowship and humane society.

If there be any meetings of neighbors about the towns good, we must not
draw in a yoke alone, but associate our selves with them. If the whole town be
on fire, what shall become of thine house? art not thou a part of the town, a
member of it? and do thou not care what become of the body? God said to the
Israelites concerning Babel, in the peace of it shall be thy peace. They were
to seek the good of Babel, and shall not we of Sion? should not every bird
have a care of her own nest? The town is the nest, wherein thou sleep, and
do thou not care, though it go to ruin? does not the safety of every
passenger consist in the ship? If water come into the Ship, ought not all to
prevent it to their power? The town is the Ship, wherein thou saylest, and
do not thou care though it be drowned? in those things that concern the
civil good of the town, let us not forsake the fellowship we have among our
selves. God will require it at our hands.

But especially let us beware how we forsake Ecclesiastical meetings, where
we have the preaching of the Word, the ordinary ladder, that leads to
heaven, the comfortable use of the Sacraments for confirmation of our faith,
and where we have the prayers of so many holy ones to join with us. These
meetings above all others ought highly to be esteemed of us, and the curse of
God will light on them that forsake them. We are commanded to go out of
Babylon, but we are never commanded to forsake the spouse of the Lord Jesus for
some spots that be in her. The corn does not skip out of the barn, because
chafe is with it. Christ did not pull down the Temple, but purged it. The V.
Mary was an heavenly and a singular woman, yet she would not be apart by her
self, she would join with the Church of God. Woe to them that forsake her,
that be the brethren of the separation, as they term themselves. Fie on such a
brotherhood, Gods vengeance does apparently follow them, wanting the light of
the true preaching of the Word, they become Atheists in the end. Let us make
much of fellowship we have in the public assemblies of the Church, let our
hearts skip for joy to see them, as David's did. It does him good to see the
tribes going to the house of God, Psalm. 122.1.
and he went himself with them. Psalm. 27.4.
One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I may dwell in the house of the
Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to visit
his Temple. This one thing is more to be esteemed of, then all others things in
the world.

There are sundry motives to stir us up to the embracing of the fellowship of
the Saints. 1. Let us make much of all kind of Christian meetings propter
mutuam supportationem. Vae soli. If he fall, who shall lift him up? but if we
be among the faithful, one brother may help another up.

2. Propter participationem suffragiorum. The prayer of one righteous man is
available, if it be fervent: how much more of many righteous together? If the
heart of a Father will be pierced with the cry of one of his children, how much
more with the cry of many? Let this make us desirous of their company, that we
may be helped to heaven by their prayers.

3. Propter terrorem daemonum, Cant. 6.9. If an army be scattered, some here,
some there, it is the sooner exposed as a prey to the enemy: so if Satan that
roaring Lion that walks about seeking whom he may devour, if he find any of
CHRIST 's Sheep straggling from the rest, he will sooner catch them in his
claws: he took Eve when she was alone, from her Husband.

But if he see us in an army united and coupled together, the General
whereof is Christ Jesus, he will be afraid of us.

4. Let us delight in the fellowship of the Saints, propter divinum consortium:
where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst
among them. Therefore let us be in the company of the faithful, that Christ
Jesus may be in our company.

Let none on pride, vain glory, singularity, or any other sinister respect
rent themselves from the fellowship of their brethren; but let us rejoice in
the society one of another. There is a fellowship among drunkards, thieves,
adulterers, swearers, swaggerers: and shall there be no fellowship among good
Christians?

There should be the greatest good fellowship among them. The Communion of
Saints is an Article of our Creed: we say we believe it, but we do not
practice it. All my delight is on the faithful, that are upon earth. Let us
take pleasure in the fellowship of the faithful in this world, that we may
have the fellowship of Christ, his Saints, and Angels in the world to come.

Love the brotherhood. 1 Pet. 2.17.
The forsaking of that is a step to the sin against the Holy Ghost. Christians
are brethren.

It might be objected: why, some forsake the fellowship: why may not we do the
like? quia vivitur legibus, non exemplis. Some travellours go out of the way,
will thou do so too! Some fall into a water and drown themselves, shall we
do so too? Some are so mad, as to leap into a fire and burn themselves,
and shall we do so? Though others take the way to hell fire, yet let not us
do it. It is the manner of some to sit quaffing at the Alehouse all the day
long: let not us do so. It is the manner of some, for supposed corruptions
that be in the Church to forsake the Church quite: but let them go alone, let
not us follow them: we have no such custom, nor the Church of God. Let us
follow them that follow Christ; and forsake them that follow the Devil, let
them go alone for all us.

Some imagine they are safe, if they have example to allege. Such and such
do so.

That is a crooked rule: ye shall meet with bad examples every where, but let
us not be seduced by them.

To this he induces us by a forcible reason.

Ye may see it with your own eyes. Almost all the signs are passed already,
they be blind that cannot see this.

Here then it is clear, that there is a day of judgment, and that day draws
near. If it were near in the Apostles time, how near is it now, a thousand
and odd years being passed since? Let not us be like them that put far
from them the evil day: not like that servant which says, my Master defers
his coming, and falls a beating of his fellow servants: not like those
mockers, that say, where is the promise of his coming? but let us make a just
reckoning, that this day is drawing near indeed, that CHRIST is ready to open
the heavens, and to descend in the clouds, and to assemble all nations before
him. Behold, I come quickly, said he, in the Revelation: he comes, and he comes
quickly; therefore let us so live in a careful discharge of all duties to God
and man, that our account may be joyful at that day, that then we may meet
Christ in the air, and be translated with him into the kingdom of glory.

If the Assizes at Bury draw near, will not they that have nisiprius to try,
provide their Lawyers, and have all things ready? the general Assizes of the
world is near; therefore let as consider how we shall answer then.

VERSE 26.
WE had need to make much of the fellowship we have among our selves, and
provoke to love and good works: for the danger is great, if we do not.

If we. It is good for all to look to it.

He does not simply say, if we sin; for then it were woe with us all, because
in many things we sin all.

Neither does he say, if we sin contrary to our knowledge, or if we sin
upon weakness and infirmity, as the dearest children of God may do. David
sinned against his knowledge, when he committed adultery and murder. So did
Peter, when he denied Christ.

But, if we sin willingly. (...) quasi (...): yielding our selves
voluntarily to Satan, maliciously opposing our selves to Christ and his
Gospel, and rending our selves from the society of his Church and members,
suffocating and choking the knowledge of the Lord Jesus revealed to us, as
appears by the next words.

There is a great difference between (...) and (...) volens and voluntary.

A man may sin willing, his will consenting to it, yet upon a sudden
passion of the mind, drawn to it in some sort against his will. But he that
sins willingly, does it upon a mature deliberation, with a resolute purpose
to do it, come on it what will: which indeed is rather a wilfulness, than a
willingness.

Such as do wilfully and maliciously resist Christ and his Gospel, that fall
utterly away.

Not, being blind and ignorant, but when we have received of Gods gracious
goodness, and as it were with both hands taking some delight in it at the
beginning, having a taste of the good Word of God, Hebr. 6.

What? the acknowledging of the truth: not (...), but (...), acknowledging it
to be the truth of God, it being sealed up to them in their hearts and
consciences by the HOLY GHOST. Their own consciences did tell them, that it was
the truth of God, yet they sinned willingly and oppugned it.

That Christ is our only King, Priest and Prophet: that he by the sacrifice of
his own body has purchased to us remission of sins, and the kingdom of
heaven.

That there is no way to be saved, but by him: yet this blessed truth they
afterward condemn, and resist it by might and maine.

Their estate is lamentable.

For the expiation of their sins, this sacrifice being rejected by them,
wherewith alone the sins of the world are taken away, there can be no
sacrifice for the abolishing of their sins: they can have no remission of
sins, and therefore no place in the kingdom of heaven. Their sins are sealed
up in a bag. This is it which he said before, Heb. 6. It is impossible they
should be renewed to repentance: and that which Christ said, Matthew. 12. This
sin cannot be forgiven, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.

For the better explication of this place, errors are to be avoided.

The Novatians have egregiously abused this place, sucking this poysonfull
doctrine out of this sweet flower; that whosoever sins after baptism, is
damned: no hope of forgiveness of sin for them. In baptism we have remission
of our sins: therefore if any sin after this general pardon, there remaineeh
no remission of sins for them. In baptism we receive the HOLY GHOST:
therefore to sin after baptism is to sin against the HOLY GHOST, and there is
no expiation of that sin.

Who then shall be saved? Alas then we are all in a woeful case, and none
should set a foot into the kingdom of heaven.

Peter sinned after baptism and after the receipt of the HOLY GHOST, yet he
wept bitterly for his sin, and was received into mercy. The incestuous man in
the Church of Corinth, that lay with his fathers wife, sinned fowly after
baptism: yet Saint Paul would not have him to be swallowed up with grief, 2
Cor. 2.7.
but admitted into the Church again.

The Church of Ephesus had fallen after she was baptized, yet CHRIST raises
her from that fall again. Apoc. 2.5.
Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first
works. At what time soever a sinner repents him of his sins, though it be
twenty times after he be baptized, I will put his sin out of my remembrance.

We are to know, that not all sins after knowledge are the sins against the
Holy Ghost. Aaron knew the Commandment, Thou shall not make to thy self any
graven Image, yet he made the Israelites a golden Calfe; for all that, he
obtained mercy at the hands of God. David knew adultery and murder to be
grievous sins: yet he fell into them. St. Peter contrary to his knowledge
denied CHRIST, he said, I know not the man: yet he knew him well enough: he
denied him not once, but thrice; he added an oath, a curse, an execration to
his denial, yet he sinned not against the HOLY GHOST.

It is a dangerous thing to sin against our knowledge: for he that knows
his Masters will and does it not, shall be beaten with many stripes. 2 Pet. 2.
It had bin better for them they had not known the way of truth, etc. yet not
every sin against knowledge, is the sin against the Holy Ghost.

But this may be a fruitful caveat to all, whom God has enriched with
knowledge. They are the most subject to the sin against the Holy Ghost. 2
These. 1.8.
Ignorant persons may be condemned: for the Lord Jesus shall come in flaming
fire rendering vengeance unto them that do not know God. But ignorant persons
cannot commit the sin against the Holy Ghost: they must be men of knowledge,
that fall into this sin: therefore the more knowledge we have, the more
careful we should be, that we be not carried by little and little into this
sin. Knowledge puffs up: knowledge breeds pride: and pride may tumble us
into hell, before we be aware. The Devil at the first, and so he is still,
was of wonderful knowledge, he saw what was in heaven: yet he was carried into
the sin against the Holy Ghost, he sinned maliciously against the knowledge
which he had received. The Pharisees were men of singular knowledge sitting in
Moses chair, reading Divinity lectures to the people, most skillful in the Law
of God: these fell into this horrible sin, many of them, as is apparent in
the Gospel. Therefore let them that have knowledge look to themselves. Let us
not think highly of our selves for our knowledge, least we fall into the
condemnation of the Devil. To whom much is given, of them much is required.
Therefore the more knowledge GOD has given us, the more often let us be in
prayer, that we may employ it to the glory of the giver. The more we know, the
more humble let us be, and crave the gracious assistance of God's Spirit to
guide our knowledge to his glory, the good and benefit of our brethren. As we
have science, so let us have conscience; and as we abound in knowledge, so let
us abound in practice, and be plentiful in the fruits of righteousness by
Jesus Christ.

3. Every sin that is done willingly, is not the sin against the Holy Ghost.
David lay with Bathshebah willingly: and for the most part we sin willingly,
with joy and delight: but this sin has malice annexed to it, as we shall see
afterward.

They fall toti, a toto, in totum: scienter, volenter, malitiose,
irrevocabiliter.

It is as clear as the noone day, that the sin against the Holy Ghost cannot
be forgiven: it is peccatum irremissibile.

This is so clear in Scripture, as that the Papists cannot deny it, yet they
will smooth it with the oil of distinction: it is called irremissibile:
ordinary, non absolute, as Bellarmine speaks: because ordinarily it cannot
be forgiven, not because forgiveness is absolutely denied unto it: aegre and
difficulter, it can be forgiven, yet with much ado, and seldom it is
forgiven.

But Christ says, it can never be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the
world to come: Matthew. 12.23.
not, it can hardly be forgiven, but never. Saint John calls it a sin to
death, not a sin near death: that cannot be forgiven without great
difficulty, 1 Ioh. 5.16.
but such a sin as strikes the party with the dart of death without recovery.
Every sin is to death without the mercy of GOD in CHRIST: but this is a sin
to death without a remedy. The death of CHRIST cannot cure this sin. Without
Repentance, none can be forgiven. Hebr. 6.6.
These men cannot repent: Ergo, it cannot be forgiven. There remains no
sacrifice for this sin: the sacrifice of CHRIST cannot abolish this sin,
because it is contemned by them, and was never ordained for them. A lamentable
sin! Let us entreat the Lord, above all sins to keep us from this.

There is a sacrifice for Idolatry, for common swearing, for profaneness, for
theft, treason, adultery* murder; these be horrible sins, and the Lord
preserve us from them; yet these may be washed away in the blood of Christ,
sacrificed on the Cross for us: but there is no sacrifice for these sinners.
Lord keep me, says David, from presumptuous sins. But much more let us
pray, Lord keep us from this sin of sins, the sin against the HOLY
GHOST: and undoubtedly he will keep all his from it: for they that are borne
of God, cannot sin unto death.

VERSE 27.
But on the contrary side:

He does not say, the present judgment of GOD shall light on them, but that
which is a mervailous torture to their conscience, a fearful and continual
expectation of it, being assured it will one day come upon them: as a condemned
man looks every hour to dye.

The godly stand in a joyful expectation of CHRIST his coming, and wish for
it. Come Lord Jesus, come quickly: but the expectation of his coming strikes a
continual terror to the wicked, which is as a rack to them in the mean
season. The devils believe there is a God, and tremble: so these apostats
believe there is a day of judgment, and quake at the recordation of it.

And the Zeal or fervency of fire: go ye cursed into everlasting fire.

Fire is terrible: therefore the pains of hell are described by it.

Fire is devouring: it devoures an whole town. This is a devouring fire, it
shall always be a devouring of them, and yet never fully devour them: they
shall ever be burning, and never burned.

Whom? them that are opposite to Christ, that wage battle against him: open and
professed enemies, set on the other side against Christ; yet under a kind of
pretext and color, as (...) does import, inverting to themselves some
colorable reason, why they should do so.

This is that which he said, Heb. 6. They are a reprobate earth, whose end is
to be burned.

Here it is evident to us all, that there is a day of judgment. There is a
lake burning with fire and brimstone. The wicked would not look for that which
is not: they look, and that with fear and horror, for the judgment to come.
Felix trembled: therefore there is a judgment. The thieves would not be afraid
of the Assizes, if there were no judgment. The very devils, and all the wicked
know there is a judgment to come. Why art thou come to torment us before the
time? they knew there was a time when they should be tormented: but they
complained, that CHRIST with his holy presence tormented them before the time.
Therefore let us all after a godly manner fear this judgment. As for them
that think there is no judgment, they are worse than the Devil, 2 These. 1.8.
There is a violent fire that shall devour the adversaries: an unquenchable
fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. Do not imagine, that ignis
gehennae is ignis fatuus. It is said of the Sodomites, that they suffer the
vengeance of eternal fire. God has appointed a day wherein he will judge the
world in righteousness: and we must all appear before the judgment seat of
CHRIST. Therefore let us often think upon it, and let it be as a bridle to
restrain us from sin. Whether I eat or drink, said Jerome, me thinks the
trumpet sounds in my ears, surgite mortui, venite ad judicium. Even now, when
we are eating and drinking, making merry at the Nativitie of our Blessed
SAVIOR, even now, when we are in the midst of all our mirth and Christmasse
games, let us remember there is a judgment: and let us live here, that we may
stand without trembling before the Son of man at the latter day.

The very conscience of a man does tell him at one time or other, whether he
will or no, that there is a day of judgment. Why are men vexed in their souls
when they have sinned, when they have committed such sins as the Law cannot
take hold off, as oppression and wrongs offered to their brethren, secret
adulteries, etc. Why are they grieved for these, and can find no rest in them,
if there were not a judgment to come?

VERSE 28.
Vid. Act. 6.11.21.28.
HEre is the equity of it.

He that abrogates it, that pulls it out of place, that violates it, elata
manu, Number. 15.30. Not he that in a small offense transgresses the Law, but
that breaks it in some monstrous and notorious manner: either by blasphemy,
by contemptuous profaning, by contumacy against father and mother: and he
that does transgress these laws in a despite and contempt of them, he must
needs be put to death: there is no remedy.

No mercy is to be showed in it: the Law must have his course, without respect
of persons: whether he be high or low, rich or poor, he must dye for it. No
bribe may save his life, Deuteronomy. 19.21.13, 8.

Yet good advice must be had in putting him to death: there must be an orderly
proceeding against him; his fault must be convinced by sufficient witnesses.

All Moses laws were not written with blood, as Draco's were: but only great
and capital crimes. Such were to dye without mercy.

Mercy is an excellent virtue, a divine virtue: draws near to the nature of
God, which is the Father of mercies: be ye merciful, as your heavenly father
is merciful. Yet for all that, mercy in some actions is to be shut out of
doors. We must sing of judgment, as well as of Mercy, as David did. Mercy is
not so to be embraced as that Justice should be forgotten: they that have
transgressed the Law, especially in contempt of the Law, are to dye without
mercy: the Lord often touches upon this string.

We must not be more merciful then God will have us. Saul spared Agag: but it
cost him his kingdom. Some will say of a thief, a murderer condemned to dye,
is it not pity such a proper man as he should dye? no verily: foolish pity
marrs the City. If such a one be permitted to live, he may do much hurt in
the commonwealth: therefore no pity is to be showed to him: mercy must be
stretched no further, than God has appointed.

But how must he dye? orderly, being convicted by the due course and order of
Law. The fact must be sufficiently proved, before sentence of death pass
against him: and how must it be proved? either by his own confession: or by
the testimony of others. Now one man may be partial, or he may speak on
spleen and malice: therefore two witnesses at least must be produced. Iesabel
procured two witnesses, against Nabal. Two witnesses were brought in against
our SAVIOR CHRIST. 1 Timothy 5.19.
Timothy must not receive an accusation against an Elder, but under two, or
three witnesses. There was thought no probability, that two would conspire in
an untruth: the one at the length would bewray the juggling of the other.
Therefore, if there were two, then he dyed: but now the world is grown to such
an height of impiety, as that it is as easy a matter to suborne two false
witnesses, to get two knaves to swear an untruth, as to take the pot and
drink. A most vile age wherein we live; but from the beginning it was not so.

VERSE 29.
THe interrogation is more forcible, then if it had been a plain affirmation:
they dyed the death of the body: but these are worthy of the death, where soul
and body shall dye for ever.

Be you Judges in the matter. I dare appeal to your own selves.

Then he sets forth the greatness of their sin: which arises by three steps
or degrees. 1. They in the Law despised Moses, which was but a man: these
Christ, which is the Son of God: therefore they are worthy of a sharper
punishment: they broke but one particular Law: these renounce the whole Gospel
of CHRIST the Son of God.

They have not Christ actually to tread upon, he is in heaven at the right hand
of God, but metonymically, in treading his truth under their feet, which they
make no reckoning of, in conculcating the benefits of CHRIST offered to them,
they tread CHRIST Himself, or, they carry such a spiteful mind against him,
as if possible, they would pull him out of heaven, and tread him under their
feet. They did it not actu, but affectu. This is the vilest indignity, that
can be offered to any, to make him as dirt to tread on. The Soldiers crucified
CHRIST, but they did not tread him under their feet. For Traitors to tread
the King under their feet, is a monstrous thing: yet these as arrant Traitors
did tread Christ the King of Kings under their feet. Horrible wretches!

In this they opposed themselves to his kingdom.

In the next to his Priesthood.

Christ by his last Will and Testament gave us a Legacy of the kingdom of
heaven Luke 22.29. the which Testament was confirmed by the blood and death of
the Testatour, Matthew. 26.28. Now this holy, precious and pure blood, wherewith
we are washed from our sins, these impure wretches account an unholy, a
common, a polluted thing, Mark. 7.2. Acts 10.15. They make no more account of
the blood of Christ, then of the blood of a thief, nay of a dog or swine,
yet they had some benefit by this blood.

Last of all, they opposed themselves to the prophecy of Christ.

It is not (...), but (...): they abuse him with some notable reproach and
contumely.

Which is the fountain and bestower of all graces.

He had given them many graces, of knowledge, of some faith, hope, love and
zeal: yet they contumeliously reproach this spirit, revile him: terming him a
spirit of error, that had deluded them all this while: For this cause they
have sinned against the Holy Ghost.

In these respects they are worthy of most severe punishment: no sacrifice for
this sin.

Is any pity to be showed to them, that -- In this world there is Mercy, but
none to be expected in the world to come. Then judgment merciless. Now
CHRIST stands with open arms, venite ad me omnes: but then he shall say, ite
maledicti: no mercy to be found for the wicked at the day of judgment. God show
mercy to the house of Onesiphorus at that day: there is mercy for the godly
that be in Christ: but none for the wicked that be out of Christ.

And who be they that shall be so severely punished?

From hence may be collected a true definition of the sin against the Holy
Ghost. It is a malicious oppugning of the truth of the Gospel sealed up in
their hearts by the HOLY GHOST: they were enlightened in the mystery of
redemption purchased by Christ: that he is the only Priest, which by the
sacrifice of his own body has made satisfaction for our sins, and has
reconciled us to God the Father, that by his blood alone we have an entrance
into the holy place: this truth was revealed to them by the Holy Ghost: this
they once acknowledged and professed before all men; but afterward maliciously
they oppugn this truth by blasphemous speeches, railing and reviling books,
and by all the force they can, go about to suppress it by fire and faggot,
treading under foot the Son of GOD, and counting the blood of the Testament
as an unholy thing. Paul was a blasphemer, and a persecutor of the Lord Jesus:
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? yet he sinned not against the HOLY
GHOST, because he did it on ignorance. Peter sinned against his own
knowledge, when he denied and forswore CHRIST: yet he sinned not against the
Holy Ghost; because he did it on weakness, for the preservation of his life.
Malicious impugning of every truth of the Gospel, is of the essence of the
sin against the Holy Ghost. To malice a member of Christ, a Preacher, an
Ambassador of Christ, as Ahab did Mich^aiah, is a grievous sin, a step to
the sin against the Holy Ghost: yet not the sin against the Holy Ghost.

That is a malicious oppugning of the truth it self. 2 Timothy 4.15.
As Saint Paul says of Alexander the Copper-smith, that he resisted, not his
person, but his preaching, and that (...), with all his might. Such a one was
Julian the Apostata, that had been a Christian, baptized into the name of
Christ, in outward show a zealous professor of the Gospel, a public reader
in the Church of Nicomedia: he and his brother Gallus together built a Temple
to Mammas the Martyr. This simulata Sanctitas proved duplex iniquitas.
Afterward in contempt of Christ and Christian religion he washed away his
baptism with blood: he was a scoffer and derider of Christ, a cunning
persequutor of the Gospel; not by fire and sword, but by sleights and devices:
because he thought open persequution would make Christianity more glorious. In
despite of the true God revealed to him in Scripture, he worshipped the Gods
of the heathen. To the last gasp he spewed out malice against our Savior
Christ. When the arrow was in his side, that gave him his deadly wound, he took
some of his own blood into his hand, threw it into the air, and said, Vicisti
Galilaee, etc. and so dyed miserably. Bellarmine says, l. 2. de poen. c. 15.
there be some among us, that knowing the Scriptures and the Fathers, yet sin
against their own knowledge, and that of malice to the truth. But as for us,
we will not judge them.

An horrible sin! Let us all take heed of it. The damned commit not this sin:
for men may be damned for less sins. If thou continuest in adultery,
unrepented, thou may be damned: nay, the least sin without repentance may
throw us into hell: but questionless they are damned that sin against the HOLY
GHOST. A sore punishment is reserved for them. Therefore let us all beware of
this sin. Let us be thankful to GOD for the Truth of the Gospel revealed
to us, let us make much of it. Let us not quench the light of the spirit, but
nourish it in our hearts. Let not the least thought against the truth find any
entertainment in us: Let us never open our mouths against it, but bless God
for it, and defend it by all possible means. Let us say with that worthy
Apostle, we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth: yea, let us
be content, if God shall see it good, even to lay down our lives for the Truth.
Let us take heed, how upon pride, vaineglory, or singularity we maintain any
opinion against the truth; how upon malice we set our selves against the truth.
For by these degrees, the Devil at the length may carry us into this fearful
sin against the HOLY GHOST. Let us not grieve the good Spirit of God any
kind of way, but let us suffer our selves to be guided by him all the days of
our lives, that we never fall into this horrible sin, nor be partakers of the
punishment due to it, but that we may be preserved from it and all other
sins, and reign with CHRIST our blessed SAVIOR in the life to come.

There is an outward and an inward sanctification: he is not a Jew which is
one outward; but he is a Jew which is one within. Judas seemed to be a Saint:
yet he was a Devil.

Let us entreat the Lord to sanctify our hearts as well as our hands, our
souls and consciences, as well as our tongues. That is true sanctification
that begins at the heart, and from thence flows to all the parts and
members of the body.

What should we do with a fair and beautiful Apple, if the core be rotten? A
straw for an outward glorious profession, and if there be no truth in the
inward parts. Therefore let us desire God to sanctify us in soul, spirit and
body throughout.

VERSE 30.
The second argument is taken from a divine testimony, containing in it the
nature of God. Where, 1. The allegation of the testimony. 2. The Application of
it.


In the allegation.

1. The manner, how.

2. The matter of the testimony alleged: which has two branches; the one out
of Verse 35. the other out of Verse 36.

If GOD be a just judge, and a severe revenger of all impiety, even among his
own people, then those vile wretches must not think to escape, that tread
under foot the Son of God -- But God is such a one. Ergo.

Quam verax and potens sit. They that be Christians must be acquainted with
God, they must know him, of what nature and disposition he is: ye err, not
knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, Heb. 9.11. If sitting in the
lap of the Church, we know not God, our condemnation shall be the greater.

Where has he said it? In the Scripture. Moses was the penman of that book,
out of the which this testimony is desumed: yet it is God that speaks in that
book. God spoke by the mouth of David, by the mouth of all his Prophets. Art
thou desirous to hear God speak? Luke 1.70.
as who would not be glad to hear the King speak? but art thou desirous to
hear the King of Kings speak? come to the Scriptures, and there thou shall
hear him speaking.

Which ought to inflame us with a love of the Scriptures, and cause us to read
and hear them with all reverence, because not man, out God speaks in them.

What says he? he thunders with a vehement voice.

Vengeance and retribution are mine.

What, may none revenge but GOD? Surely no, by his own authority.

The Magistrate may revenge: Romans 13.4.
for he carries not the sword in vain.

But his throne is Gods throne, his sword Gods sword, his vengeance Gods
vengeance: no private man may revenge. The King says, White Hall is mine, the
Scepter and Crown of England is mine; and shall any go about to wring them
out of his hands? The King of Kings says, vengeance is mine, and will thou
wrest Gods sword out of his hand? Take heed how thou do it, lest thou be
found a fighter against God. Say not, such a one has angered me, I will be
even with him: o saucy Merchant! will thou intrude thy self into Gods office?

The second branch of the testimony.

The greatest part of Interpreters are of opinion, that the Apostle alleges
this to his purpose indirectly, by the way of consequent. If God will be
avenged on the enemies of his people, much more on the enemies of his Son.

They think that to judge his people, is, to judge the enemies of his people
for his peoples sake.

But this is alleged directly: and to judge is put for to punish. Ezekiel. 7.3.
The Lord shall judge his own people, even so many of them as revolt from him,
the living God, to dumb and dead idols. That is the scope of the whole Chapter,
as ye may see from Verse 15 to this place: and Saint Paul cites, Verse 21.
Romans 10. to prove the rejection of the Jews. Though they be his own people,
whom he has honored with the Word and Sacraments, that have given up their
names to him, and taken upon them the profession of his holy truth: yet if they
fall from him, he will severely punish them.

Therefore those men that have been enlightened with the Spirit of grace, that
have had CHRIST JESUS revealed to them, and yet contumeliously despise that
spirit; count the blood of the Testament a profane thing, and tread the Son
of God under their feet, undoubtedly they shall drink deeply of the cup of
Gods vengeance: for vengeance is Gods, and he will power it in full measure on
them.

It cannot be denied but that God is exceeding merciful: his mercy reaches
to the clouds, is higher than the heavens: his mercy is over all his works.
There is not half a Psalm of Justice: but an whole Psalm of his Mercy. The
foot of that song is this, for his mercy endures for ever: yea he is the
Father of mercies, of a great number of mercies: yet for all that, he is just
too. As mercy is his, so vengeance is his: he is a Judge as well as a Father.
As he is wonderful, kind and beneficial to his people, when they serve him:
so he will judge his people, when they depart from him David said concerning
the government of his house and kingdom, I will sing of Mercy, and Judgment.
We sing of Mercy, but we let Judgment go; like bad Musitions we leave out
one part of the song: we harp much on the string of Mercy, but we never
meddle with the string of Justice.

Though we swear, be drunken, commit adultery, steal secretly from our
neighbors, though we make small reckoning of his word, rail on it and the
Preachers too: yet God is merciful, ready to forgive our sins.

I but remember likewise that vengeance is his, and he will judge, even his
own people: especially, if with an high hand they sin against him: he will
wound the hairie scalpe of them, that go on in their sins. The Scripture
records examples of Gods vengeance, as well as of Gods Mercy. He threw the
Angels out of heaven, when they sinned: he drowned the whole world for sin:
he rained fire and brimstone on Sodom; he made Iesabel a filthy adulteress,
though a Queen, to be cast out of a window and eaten up with dogs. If we know
the truth, and make no conscience to live according to the truth: if we cause
his Gospel to be blasphemed by our wicked lives: especially, if we choke the
truth revealed to us, set our selves against it, and maliciously despise the
spirit of grace, whereby we were in some measure sanctified, then the
vengeance of GOD will light heavy on us. Therefore let us think as well on
Gods Justice, as on his Mercy.

VERSE 31.
OVt of this divine testimony the Apostle infers a fruitful conclusion,
showing what use we are to make of this doctrine: it must cause us to fear God
Almighty.

An horrible thing! to fall suddenly, when we little think of it, and deeply
too, into the wine press of Gods wrath: so much the word does import. Into
what? into the hands of the living GOD. Why, God has no hands: therefore we
need not fear falling into them? True indeed, God has no part or member of a
body, as we have, for he is a spirit: yet for our capacity, it is adscribed to
him. By the hands of God in this place is meant, the wrath, power and anger of
God Almighty. As a master says to his servant, take heed how you come into my
hands again: so it is a fearful thing to fall into Gods hands.

What is this God? A living God, that lives for ever, not a dead and dumb
Idol: therefore there is no escaping out of his hands, if we fall into them.

For the better explication of it, know, that GOD has two hands. The one is
Manus protegens, into thy hands I commend my spirit. It is a comfortable thing
to fall into these hands. The other is manus puniens, and that is double; the
one as he is Pater castigans, so David chose to fall into the hands of God: the
other, 2 Samuel 24.14.
as he is Iudex vindicans; and so it is a fearful thing to fall into his
hands. The wrath of a King, says Solomon, is as the roaring of a Lion: what is
the wrath of the King of Kings? An earthly King may be appeased with rewards
and requests: but his wrath, if he be once angry as a Judge, cannot be
appeased. Some by violence may snatch thee out of a Kings hand, which is
stronger than he: none can deliver thee out of Gods hands: if thou be his
prisoner once, look for no Jail delivery. Thou may run out of a Kings
kingdom, Deuteronomy. 32.39.
but there is no running from GOD: whither shall I fly from thy presence? in
any corner of the earth he will find thee out: yea though thou had wings
to mount up into the heavens, he can fetch thee down. An earthly King lives
but for a time; at the length he dies: but GOD lives for ever. Therefore it is
a fearful thing to fall into his hands.

Yet men little consider this: they imagine it is nothing to fall into Gods
hands. A servant had rather fall into Gods hands by making a lie, then into the
hands of his master by speaking a truth. A number of desperate persons had
rather fall into Gods hands by swearing and forswearing, then into the hands of
an earthly judge. We make no account of Gods hands: tush God sees it not, or if
he regard it, he is a kind God, it makes no matter for falling into his hands:
yet it is a fearful thing: for though he bear long with thee in wonderful
patience and long suffering, yet he will make thee bear in the end. Therefore
let us not wittingly and willingly fall into Gods hands, especially let us take
heed how we do maliciously impugn the truth sealed up in our hearts and
consciences by the Holy Ghost: let us beware, how we wage battle against
CHRIST and despise him the Savior of the world: if by such a sin we fall
into the hands of the Almighty GOD, there is no getting out of his hands again.

VERSE 32.
SO much of the exhortation in general. Now follows the ripping up of the
particular branches of it. Wherein, 1. A preface to the explication of it. 2.
The explication it self.


A preparation is made to it.

1. By calling to remembrance their valiant behavior in time past. 2. By
confirming them in their profession, Verse 35.
We must not remember old injuries: there must be an (...) of them, they must
be raced out of our remembrance: yet there ^re three things which we must
remember.

1. Beneficia accepta, we must never suffer Gods benefits to slip out of our
mind, we must keep a perpetual catalogue of them.

2. Mala commissa. I remember my faults this day, said Pharaohs Butler. We must
call our sins to remembrance, and weep for them.

3. Exemplaria bona praeterita, both of other men and of our selves too. The
Apostle here would have them call to their remembrance, what manner of men they
had been in times past, how forward, how zealous of religion; what afflictions
they endured for it, and to continue the same men still; rather to increase,
then to decrease. Remember from whence thou art fallen, says Christ to the
Church of Ephesus, which had forsaken her first love.

Many are hot in the beginning, that wax key cold in the end: therefore let us
remember the days of old, that our latter days may be as good, if not
better, than our former days. Grow in grace.

1. What, they must remember: a notable exploit of theirs.

2. The time when it was done.

After ye were enlightened with the knowledge of the truth, and had given up
your names to Christ.

Ye did not fall under the burden, but very manfully stood under it.

He does not simply say, afflictions; but, a fight: not a little one, but a
great one: Ye wrastled with many afflictions.

So soon as we become Christians, we must look for afflictions. All that will
live godly in CHRIST JESUS, shall suffer persecution. These were no sooner
enlightened, but they had a great fight of afflictions. He that will be my
Disciple, let him take up his Cross and follow me. If thou will be a
Christian, thou must have the Cross. So soon as CHRIST our Captain was
baptized, he was led into the wilderness to be tempted of the Devil: and so
soon as we in baptism profess our selves to be his Soldiers, we must
expect a great fight of afflictions, Apoc. 7.14. We need not to fight one with
another, Ephraim to eat up Manasseh, and Manasseh Ephraim: we shall have
enemies besides to fight withal: the Devil and his instruments, sickness,
malevolent tongues, poverty, loss of goods and life too. Therefore let us all
prepare our selves for this fight. We cannot have an heaven here and an heaven
hereafter too: we must look for pains here with Lazarus, if we will have
joys hereafter with him.

VERSE 33.
THis fight is illustrated by a distribution of the afflictions, which they
sustained either in themselves, or with others. In the afflictions which they
endured in their own persons is to be considered, the manner, and the matter of
them.

For the manner, they were set on a theater, 1 Cor. 4.9. exposed on a stage to
the laughter of the whole world: for the matter of their afflictions, they
concerned their good name, or their goods and life. For good name, they had
many reproaches laid on them, called Heretics, Galileans, maintainers of the
sect of the Nazarites, foolish Asses, that would believe in a crucified God --
besides that, they had such afflictions, as touched goods and life.

Neither did they suffer in their own persons alone, but in the persons of
others: or, that were conversant in the like afflictions. If the toe be full
of pain, the whole body suffers with it: If one Christian be in affliction, we
must have a fellow-feeling of it. I John, even your brother and companion in
tribulation, Apoc. 1.9. In being companions with them, we are companions with
Christ. When I was in prison, ye visited me. We will be companions with
drunkards, with adulterers: and shall we not be companions with them that are
afflicted for the name of Christ? Let us be companions of their misery,
weeping, praying, and relieving them in this life, that we may be companions
with them of felicity in the life to come.

VERSE 34.
BOth these are confirmed. For the former, they sorrowed -- Where? whether at
Jerusalem, Rome, or any other place, is not expressed: but the Apostles bonds
were as their own bonds, Hebr. 13.3.

For the latter: they suffered the snatching of goods: the persequutors played
the harpies, violently taking away their goods, Silver, Gold, household,
Sheep, Oxen, etc. yet they suffered it: how? not contentedly alone, but with
joy: they rejoiced to be spoiled of their goods for Christ's sake: they were,
not only not grieved, but glad of it: why? they were on a sure ground, not only
guessing or conjecturing, but -- That ye have: where? in your selves, fide and
spe, Ioh. 3.36. What? A better substance: ratified by the place and quality of
it: for place, it is not in earth, where thieves break and steal: but in
heaven, as in a strong castle, where it is safe. But say some: what tell you
me of goods in heaven? Let me have my goods on earth. A bird in the hand is
better than two in a bush.

For the quality, not a fading, but an enduring substance.

These were excellent professors, that suffered joyfully the spoiling of their
good for Christ's sake. Men had as leave loose their lives as their goods.

Whereupon the Grecians comprehend them both in one word, (...). Yet if we were
right Christians indeed, we will be content, and that with joy, to part with
all we have in the world, for CHRIST, and his Gospel. He that loves father and
mother more than me, is not worthy of me: much less is he worthy of Christ,
that loves his goods more than him. 1. God gave us all: why shall he not have
all, if he require it? can they be bestowed better than on him that gave them?
2. We shall have better in the room: those goods tarry but a while, we may
loose them by casualties in this life; at least, when death comes, we must
forsake all: these endure for ever. Who will not change for the better? give me
a better house and take mine, a better horse -- we love the better. If we loose
these goods for Christ's sake, we shall find better; therefore let it not
grieve us to part with them.

But this is an hard thing: this made the young man go sorrowful away. Now in
the time of prosperity we will not bestow any of our goods on the poor, on the
Church, on the maintenance of the Word of God, unless it be extorted by Law?
then how will we suffer with joy the loss of all in the time of adversity? Let
us not be so glewed to our riches: let us use them now, as if we used them not,
that if the time of trial should come, we may joyfully forgo Christ's sake.

VERSE 35.
NOw he prepares them to persist with boldness in it: by confirming and
strengthening of them in the profession of the Gospel.

1. He commends to them an heavenly courage and invincible boldness: then he
points out two props or pillars for it to lean upon.

1. The admonition. 2. The reason of it.

Cast not away: as faint hearted Soldiers are wont to do their weapons: cast
it not away, but keep it still, Ephesians. 6.13. he bade us (...), our spiritual
armor. Here he would not have us (...). We are wont to cast away those
things, that be hurtful and cumbersome to us. This heavenly weapon of
confidence and boldness is very necessary and commodious for us: therefore let
us not cast it away. Will a traveller cast away his staff, whereon he leans
and sustaines himself in his journey? The confidence we have in God by Jesus
Christ, is the staff, whereon we lean: therefore let us not cast, it away;
for so much as ye know ye have within your selves, a better enduring
substance in heaven, although ye loose all these earthly goods. Therefore cast
not away that confidence. Let it cause you courageously to pass through all
afflictions whatsoever.

The word does import not only an inward boldness, but an open profession of it
before all the world. (...), quasi (...): when men are not afraid to speak all
and deliver their whole mind. As ye have begun to fight valiantly under
Christ's banner, even to the spoiling of all your goods: so let nothing quayle
your courage, continue fighting to the end.

Why? what shall they get by it? this your bold and confident fighting shall be
rewarded, and that greatly too: therefore persist in it.

He does not say, it shall have: but, it has already: namely, fide and spe:
not a small, but a great recompense of reward. We shall not only have a reward,
but a great reward, Psalm. 19.11. Matthew. 5.12. It is great in many respects.

1. For earthly goods which we loose, we shall have treasures in heaven that
abide for ever: and is not that a great reward? for chips to have gold.

2. For our afflictions, that are finite, we shall have infinite and eternal
happiness. Here we suffer for a time: there we shall reign forever. What a
great reward is this? Barzillai said to David, why will the King recompense it
with such a reward? much more may we say: why will the King of Kings
recompense our afflictions with such a great reward as this is?

Let the consideration of this reward put life and courage into us all. It
would grieve a Soldier to fight, when he shall get nothing, but blows: but if
he be sure of a rich spoil, when the battle is ended, that will make him
fight courageously: we shall be amply rewarded, therefore let us fight.

Our labor is not in vain in the Lord, 1 Cor. 15. ult. all our good works
shall be rewarded: yet thereupon it does not follow, that they are
meritorious. Wheresoever the Papists find fire in the Scripture, that is the
fire of purgatory: and where they find a reward, thereupon they conclude a
merit. Indeed opus and merces are relatives: but not merces and meritum. A
reward does presuppose a work, but not a merit. All that labored in the
Vineyard were rewarded, but not according to their merits: for then they that
labored but one hour, should not have been equal with them, that bore the
heat and burden of the day: but they were rewarded according to the promise of
the Lord of the Vineyard: so shall we be. Therefore it is said Verse 36. that
we shall receive the promise.

But this is most certain, that all our works whatsoever issuing from faith
shall be rewarded. Our coming to Church, our hearing of Sermons, if with fear
and conscience; our feeding of the hungerie, clothing of the naked, our
prayers, alms deeds, etc. yea a cup of cold water, given with a sincere heart,
shall not loose his reward. Moses looked to the recompense of the reward: so
let us do with the eye of faith. It is not in vain to serve God, as the
wicked complain in Malachie: we shall have great recompense of reward for our
service. Let this encourage us all in the profession of the Gospel.

VERSE 36.
THe first pillar is patience. Where, 1. The necessity of patience. 2. A remedy
against impatiencie.

1. The necessity of patience is intimated. 2. Urged by a forcible reason.
He does not say, it were well ye had patience* it were a convenient thing
that ye had patience, ye cannot be without it. A Soldier has need of
weapons; a man of meat and drink; and ye of patience.

Why? the reason is taken from the necessary use of it: without patience ye
cannot have heaven promised to you: therefore ye have need of it.

That after ye have done the will of God, that is suffered according to his
will. It is Gods will we should pass to heaven through afflictions, 1 Pet. 4.
ult. in that respect let us bear them patiently, and let us say with Paul,
Act. 21.13. I am ready not to be bound only, but to dye for the name of the
Lord Jesus.

The promise, that is rem promissam. Multa cadunt inter promissum, and rem
promissam. Patience is a noble virtue: nobile vincendi genus est patientia.

1. Sapientem demonstrat. David showed himself a wise man when he bore
patiently the railing of Shimei. So did Hezekias, when he answered not
Rabshakeh. The world counts them fools, that put up reviling speeches, yet
they be the true wise men.

Pro. 16.32.
2. Fortitudinem superat, aerek Aphaijm. Septuag. (...). It is counted
cowardlinesse not to resist: yet it is the best valor in the world.

3. Sine ictu de host triumphat. We give our enemy never a blow, and yet we
overcome him; not feriendo, but ferendo, we triumph over them all. It is a
victory gotten, not only without bloodshed, but without the stryking of a
stroke.

4. In morte vitam conservat. As the Salamander lives in the fire: so patience
makes us to live in the fire of afflictions.

5. De regno securitatem praestat, Matthew. 5.10. Blessed are they that suffer
persecution for righteousness sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven:
therefore let this excellent virtue be embraced by us all. In patience possese
your souls. We can have no quiet possession of our souls without patience.
We have need of patience at all times and seasons, in adversity and
prosperity too. Though we be not thrust out of our houses, spoiled of our
goods, banished the Country, clapped up into prison, carried to the stake for the
profession of the Gospel: yet if we belong to CHRIST, we shall always have
our Crosses. All that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer
persequution. If any will be my Disciple, let him take up his Cross. God will
exercise us one way or other: either he will send us sickness, or stir up
some railing Shimeis against us: he will evermore be trying of our faith.
Therefore we have need of patience. It is as needful as our meat and drink.
Patience is the food and nourishment of the soul. Therefore the Lord in mercy
give patience to us all.

From hence some conclude, Lib. 4. de just. cap. 7. p. 1198.
that good works are necessary to salvation. Patience is a good work. The
Apostle avouches, that it is necessary, not only ratione praesentiae; being
good works they cannot be separated from faith: sed ratione relationis ad
salutem; for here he does not simply say, that patience is necessary; but with
a reference to eternal life, that ye might receive the promise.

We grant good works are necessary to salvation: none can be saved without
them: but how? not as meritorious causes of salvation, that is CHRIST alone,
which has purchased heaven for us with his own blood: but necessary, as fruit
for a tree: and the way for a passenger to go by to his house and Country.
Good works are the way to heaven, and so necessary for us all to walk in. In
that respect we have need of patience, of virtues and good works.

VERSE 37.
HEre is a remedy against impatiencie taken from the shortness of the time
wherein we are to suffer. Thou call for patience: thou would have us to
be patient in our afflictions: but how long shall we continue in them? To that
he answers parvum quam quam: the ingemination of the word, augmenteth the
signification of it: as Toboth, Toboth. Raagnoth, Raagnoth, (...).

He, that is, the Lord Jesus Christ, Ier. 24.3
and deliver you out of all your miseries.

I: he will come, but it may be long first? Nay, he will make no tarrying.

If we be in any kind of affliction, we think the time long, though it be
never so short. As the Saints in the Apoc. 6.10. cry, how long, Lord? So if we
be sick, we say, how long Lord? how long will it be ere this sickness be
removed from me? how long shall we endure the taunts of the wicked? how long
shall Christians in some Countries suffer banishment, imprisonment, loss of
goods? how long shall the Devil and his instruments tyrannize over them? but a
very little while, even the turning of an hand, the twinkling of an eye, in
respect of eternity? What is ten or twenty years calamity, if it should be
so long? What is thirty eight or forty years, as Ioh. 5. a man was so long
diseased in his feet? what is this to life everlasting? who would not fight a
while, that he might have the victory? who would not take physike a while, 2
Cor. 4.17.
that he might be whole? our light affliction, which is but for a moment,
causes unto us a far most excellent and an eternal weight of glory.
Therefore let the shortness of our suffering comfort us: he that should come,
will come in his due and convenient time.

GOD comes to deliver us three kind of ways.

1. By plucking us out of the temptations in this world: as he did Saint Paul
out of the mouth of the Lion, the Emperor of Rome.

2. By our particular death: he takes us out of the world by death, and then
there is an end of all our sorrow.

3. By his coming at the general judgment: that is not long: behold, I come
quickly. Then shall we both in our bodies and souls in heaven: where all
tears shall be wiped from our eyes for ever. Let us be of good comfort: yet a
very little while, and the Lord will come graciously to us one way or other.

VERSE 38.
THe second pillar, for sustaining them in afflictions; is Faith. Where, 1. The
excellency of Faith.

2. The application of it, Verse 39.

The excellency is,

1. Set down, then illustrated.

Beemunatho. Every man must live by his own faith: he cannot live by the faith
of another. In the Sept. (...), by my faith, that is by faith in me: which is
all one.

Here we see, whereby a Christian lives: not by the air, as Camelions do; not
by love, as we use to say: not simply by his meat and drink: by that indeed
through Gods blessing the body lives: 1 Timothy 5.6.
but the soul lives by faith, Gal. 2.20. and they that want faith are dead,
even while they live, as Saint Paul speaks of the widow. A just, holy, and
righteous man lives by faith. I know whom I have believed. We know what joy is
laid up for us in heaven: therefore we bear patiently all the afflictions of
this present life.

We do not only live by faith at our first conversion, and justification, as
Saint Paul disputes in his Epistle to the Romans, but all the days of our
life we live by faith. Therefore let us entreat the Lord to increase our faith,
that in all calamities we may live by it in this world, and live without it in
his kingdom in the world to come.

This is illustrated by the contrary: but if any withdraw himself, my soul
shall have no pleasure in him. So the Seventy have it. The Hebrew in words is
much different from it: yet in sense they are all one. Gnuphlah: he makes
himself a tower, whose heart is not upright in him. He trusts to himself, not
to God, that is, he withdraws himself from the Lord: and if his heart be
not upright in him, then God has no pleasure in him. But we need not busy
our selves in the reconciling of these places: for Saint Paul does not of
purpose allege it as the Prophets testimony; but only uses the words of the
Scripture in them to commend faith to them.

If any withdraw himself by infidelity, and think it a better course to
sleep in an whole skin, then to suffer any thing for Christ and his Gospel
-- My soul. Either it may be spoken in the person of the Apostle: or in the
person of GOD: neither any good Christian, nor GOD Himself will take any
pleasure in such a one; but he is rather detested of God and man: therefore
let us live by faith, and not withdraw our selves by infidelity.

VERSE 39.
THen follows an application of it to the Hebrews* which is partly negative,
partly affirmative.

Though I have spoken of some unfaithful persons, that withdraw themselves or
depart from the living God: yet I would not have you imagine, that I mean you,
that I put you into that black bill: nay you, are of another stamp, you are
birds of another feather: yea he includes himself in their number, that they
might conceive the better of it, to be coupled in the same yoke with him.

1. He tells them what they are not.

We are not of the withdrawing. Either the preposition (...) must be supplied,
after the manner of the Grecians; or the noune (...), according to the custom
of the Hebrews: we are not the Children of the withdrawing, to the destruction
of our souls: but we are the Children of faith, to the conservation of our
souls in this Sea of miseries, wherein we are tossed.

1. Here we learn, that when the Preacher has occasion to terrify the
wicked, he must comfort the godly, least they take it to themselves and be
discouraged. So Hebr. 6.9. 1 These. 5.4. 2 These. 2.13. Many weak consciences
are soon cast down, and ready to apply that to them, which the Preacher never
meant of them: therefore we must use this wise and heavenly discretion, that
the Apostle does.

2. Here we see, that good Christians must be no withdrawers of themselves. We
must withdraw our selves from the wicked: Apoc. ^8.4.
come out, come out my people from the midst of them. We must not withdraw
our selves from the Church of God, because of some pretended spots in her, as
the sectaries do, but we must withdraw our selves from Gods enemies. There is
a time also, when we must withdraw our selves from the company of our friends
into our secret chambers, and pray to God, as Daniel did. But in the time of
persecution we must not withdraw our selves through infidelity, and run out of
the field, wherein God has set us. We may read of some withdrawers, Ioh. 6.66.
Demas was a withdrawer: so was Julian the Apostata: but let not us be such. Let
us say with them, Ioh. 6.68. to whom shall we go? thou have the words of
eternal life. Joshua would be no withdrawer: choose ye whom you will serve;
but I and my house will serve the Lord, Ios. 24.15. Saint Peter would be no
withdrawer: though all forsake thee, yet will not I: he did deny him for a time
and withdrew himself: but he wept bitterly for it, and stood better to his
tackling. If the storm and tempest of persequution should arise, let us not
withdraw our selves and refuse to suffer for CHRIST: but let us stick to him
all the days of our life. Ye are they, that have continued with me in my
temptations. CHRIST loves continuers. Be faithful to the end, and I will give
thee the Crown of life. Let nothing make us to withdraw our selves from
CHRIST, but let us cleave steadfastly to him in this world, that we may reign
and triumph with him in the world to come.

CHAP. XI.
IN the substance of that exhortation derived out of the doctrine of CHRIST 's
Priesthood three several virtues were commended to us: the first, faith; the
second, hope: the third, love. Now follows a particular explication of all
these. Faith is painted out to us in this Chapter, Hope in the twelfth: Love
with the fruits thereof, in the thirteenth.

This Chapter has two principal parts: a definition of faith, and an
illustration of it.

1. By Example. 2. By instance, Verse 3.
It is defined Verse 1. Where the nature of it is expressed.

It makes them existent, not only in intellectu, but also in cord and
voluntate. It is a full persuasion that we shall have these things which we
hope for: nay, it puts us into a real possession of them.

VERSE 1.
FAith is the evidence of things which are not seen.] The holy and celestial
Jerusalem where there is no Sun, but is enlightened with the glory of the
Lamb continually: where there is no night, crying or weeping, where all tears
shall be wiped from our eyes for ever, cannot be seen with mortal eye: yet
faith makes it evident to us, even in this life. The blessed and glorious
Trinity, GOD the Father, Son and HOLY GHOST, cannot be seen: no man has
seen GOD at any time: yet faith makes GOD visible to us, standing by us in all
afflictions. Our SAVIOR CHRIST the King of the Church and mediator of
mankind, clothed with our nature, sitting at the right hand of GOD in all
glory and Majesty cannot now be seen of us: Stephen saw him, when he was on
earth; but that was extraordinary: now we cannot see CHRIST in his glory, yet
by faith we see him, and know that so soon as we are dissolved we shall be
with him. The holy and celestial Angels that are our gua^dians, that hold us
in their hands, that sing praises to God continually in heaven, cannot now be
seen of us: yet by faith, we see them, and are assured that they will take our
souls at our dying day, and carry them into heaven. The spirits of just and
perfect men, of Adam, Eve, Isaak, Moses, David, of the Patriarchs and Prophets,
of the blessed Virgin Mary, Saint Paul, Saint Peter, of the Apostles and
Martyrs cannot as yet be seen of us: but by faith we know they are in heaven,
and we our selves one day shall be with them. We cannot now see or apprehend
the joys of heaven, no ear has heard them, no eye has seen them, they
cannot enter into the heart of man: yet by faith they are evident to us. The
resurrection of the body cannot now be seen: we see many carried to the
Church and Churchyard to be buried; but we see none rise again; yet by faith
it is evident to us: so that we can say with Job, our Redeemer lives, and with
these eyes shall we see him, and no other for us.

Faith is an excellent eye. The eye of the Eagle is very sharp and piercing:
she can see from heaven to earth, she can epsy her prey a far of: she and
her birds can look on the Sun: but the eye of faith is far more piercing,
that sees Christ, the Sun of righteousness; and by it we look into the
Sanctuary of heaven, and behold what is there. Some write of one Lynceus, that
he could see an hundred thirty thousand paces off: but we by the eye of faith
can see further: this one eye is better than all Argos his eyes. Howsoever the
eyes of our bodies wax dim, let us entreat the Lord to preserve this eye, to
make it brighter and brighter every day.

Faith is the evidence of things not seen. Let us make much of this evidence.
If we have an evidence whereby we hold our lands, we will show it to some
Lawyer to see of what validity it is, we will keep it safe under lock and
key. Let us examine this our evidence of faith; if there be a crack in it,
let us seek to have it amended, and let us take up that prayer of the
Apostles, Lord increase our faith, Lord strengthen the eye of our faith, that
even on earth we may see heaven.

VERSE 2.
HEre is an illustration of it. 1. Ab exemplis. 1. In general, If for this
faith our fathers were well reported of, then this is the true faith: but our
fathers were well reported of for this faith. Ergo.

Elders: whom we are to reverence: which went before us, and lived longer than
we.

Reported of: adorned by the testimony of God and man: the testimony of the
Lord is pure. As the Father testified of Christ, this is my beloved Son: So
also of Noah, that he was a just and upright man, and one that walked with God:
Abraham, the friend of God: Moses the meekest man upon the earth: David a man
after Gods own heart: have thou not considered my servant Job, how none is
like him in the earth? an upright and just man, one that fears God and
escheweth evil? Of Nathaneel Christ said, behold, indeed an Israelite in whom
there is no guile.

This also got them a goodreport among men: all their famous exploits were done
by faith, Verse 29.

A good name is above Gold and silver: it is greatly desired of all; but all
take not the right course of getting it. Some think to get them a name by
building, as they that set up the tower of Babel: they imagine to be famous by
sumptuous buildings: some by hunting, as Nimrod: some by drinking, as F^cidius:
some by whoring, as Hercules: some strive to get them a name by their courteous
behavior, as Absalom did, by a counterfeit kind of kindness toward all: some
by liberality and house keeping, and I would there were more of them: some by
their great variety of learning: but all these miss the mark, they begin at a
wrong end. The best foundation for a good name is faith: she will leave a
sweet savor behind her: wheresoever she become, she will procure us favor
with God and man: when the name, that the wicked have gotten shall rot, the
faithful shall be had in perpetual remembrance: therefore let us all beg
faith at the hands of God, that we may be renowned in this world, and eternally
famous in the world to come.

VERSE 3.
SEcondly, it is illustrated by an instance in one particular which is famous:
by this we understand the world was made of things not seen: therefore faith
is the evidence of them.

Ages or times. The world mas made in time, has continued in time, and shall
end in time.

Omnibus numeris absolutus, no commodity, no pleasure wanting.

To this end: that we might all understand, etc.

We believe the Scriptures, as Agrippa did: they tell us, that the world was
made by GOD. In principio creavit Deus -- therefore we believe the creation of
the world. Aristotle held, that the world was eternal: Plato, that GOD made
the heavens and Angels, but the Angels made the bodies of men and beasts: but
we by faith understand, that God made the world: yea that all creatures were of
his making, and that without him nothing was made: he made the high and
celestial Angels, the Sun, Moon, and the whole host of heaven: birds of the
air, fishes of the Sea: all trees, men and beasts on the earth: and all these,
did he make by his own bare word: he commanded, and they were created: let
there be a firmament, and there was one: let there be a Sea, birds; and it was
so: only he paused and deliberated at the making of one creature, which was
man, because he was to be his vicegerent, and a King over all creatures. By his
omnipotent word all were made.

And of what was the world made: what timber, what stones had God to make this
building withal? Surely nothing, yet he made it. Not so much as any atoms:
even materia prima was made of him: he found it not in the world before.

O mighty and puissant God! Let us all fear him that made heaven and earth. O
how wonderfully am I made, said David of himself! much more of the whole
world, how wonderfully was the world made of nothing! The world came not by
chance or fortune: it was framed by no earthly artificers. Aholiab and Bezaleel
made the Tabernacle, Hyram the Temple; God the world: and this did he make
principally for sinful man. All creatures were made for us, the Sun, Moon,
Birds, Fishes, etc. that we might freely eat of all: yea the Angels were in a
sort made for us, that they might be ministering spirits for our salvation.
Therefore let us praise God all the days of our lives, that made the glorious
palace of the world for us.

Now as the world was made, so it must have an end, 2 Pet. 3. therefore
notwithstanding all the pleasure and wealth of this world, let us use it as if
we used it not: for the glory thereof fades away: they wax old as does a
garment. Therefore let us lay up our treasures in a better world. From hence,
the Jesuits make this collection, we must believe the world was made out of
nothing, though we do not see it: so we must believe that the body of CHRIST
is corporally in the Lords Supper, though we cannot see it.

But, they might see there is a different reason. We believe the world was
made of nothing, though we see it not, because the Word of God has avouched
it: God's Word never teaches us, that the body of CHRIST is in the Sacrament
corporally, but in heaven: therefore there is no cause why we should believe it.

VERSE 4.
NOw he returns to the examples. 1. At large: then summarily, Verse 32.
before the flood and after: before the entrance into Canaan, and after.

1. A commendation of Abels fact. 2. An approbation of it. In the former,

1. What it was that gave a relish to his sacrifice. 2. To whom it was offered.
3. The eminency of it.

Caine had the more worthy name: Caine, acquisitio, as if she had gotten the
Messiah. Abel, vanity, or weeping. 2. He had the worthyest trade: bread is the
staff of life. 3. He was the first borne. 4. He built a City. Yet Abel is
preferred before him.

A fuller sacrifice: (...): kissed. Caines sacrifice was void of faith,
therefore empty. Cain took absque delectu. Abel chose. 2. Corn was not so
lively to represent CHRIST, as Sheep and Lambs. 3. His more sparing: Abels
more plentiful: rather, better for his faith.

By the which faith, not sacrifice: as Verse 2. and in the end of this Verse.

The second thing, is the approbation. 1. In his life. 2. After his death. In
life, internal in his own heart and conscience, that he was righteous,
believing in the Messiah: external, either by word, Genesis 4:4. or by action, as
Levit. 9.24. 1 Reg. 18.38. 1 Chronicles. 21.26. 2 Chronicles. 7.1.

Some have been of opinion, that Adam was damned, because he is left out of
the catalogue of the faithful: but if none should be saved, save those that be
in this calender, few should be saved.

The salvation of Adam and Eve, may be concluded by probable reasons rendered
by Irenaeus, Epiphan. Chrysostom. Aug.

1. It is not like that GOD would cast away the first man that he made: the
first borne is greatly beloved. Seldom does any father disinherit his first
borne. Adam was the first that God made, and that immediately with his own
hands.

2. Satan the enemy of mankind did now but begin to peep out of the window,
he was not as yet known. Adam had no experience of him: therefore it is like
that GOD would be merciful to him, that was first circumvented by him. Iren.
l. 3. c. 34.35.

3. God cursed not Adam, but the earth, Genesis 3.17. he is none of those cursed
ones, to whom CHRIST shall say at the latter day, ite maledicti, etc.

4. When Adam and Eve had sinned, they covered themselves with fig leaves,
which are sharp and pricking, thereby declaring their true repentance, as
Chrysostom observes.

5. As God made them a promise of CHRIST to come, the seed of the woman, etc.
So it is most likely that they laid hold on that promise by the hand of Faith:
for they brought up their children in the exercises of Religion; to offer
sacrifice, as a figure of the true Lamb, that was to be sacrificed on the
Cross for the sins of the world.

External sacrifices of Religion have been practiced by all in the lap and
bosom of the Church from the beginning of the world. Cain did not refuse to
sacrifice, he offered a sacrifice, as his brother did: they therefore that
contemn the exercises of Religion, that will not come to church, offer up the
sacrifice of praise and prayer with the rest of their brethren, are worse than
Caine.

2. Here we see, that opus operatum is not sufficient. It is not enough to do
a good work, which GOD requires at our hands, but we must perform it in
such a manner, as the Lord requires: we must not only do bonum, but bono.

The Pharisee prayed in the Temple, and the Publican prayed: the prayer of the
one was acceptable, of the other abominable. The Pharisees heard CHRIST preach,
and many of the common people heard him preach: to the one it was the savor of
life to life; to the other of death unto death. Simon Magus was baptized and
gave up his name to CHRIST, and Lydia was baptized: the one sincerely, the
other in Hypocrisy. Peter received the Passover, and Judas received it: to
the one it was honey, to the other poison. The Pharisees gave alms, and
Cornelius. The one went up into remembrance before God: the other did not. So
Cain sacrificed, and Abel sacrificed: yet GOD had respect to the one, not to
the other.

Therefore we had need to beware with what mind and affection we do good
things. It is not enough to come to Church, to profess CHRIST, to hear
Sermons, to receive the Holy Communion, to offer up the sacrifice of
thankesgiving with the congregation: but we must do these things with a
sincere heart: da mihi cor: not for fashion sake to be well thought of among
men, to be counted devout and religious persons, but we must do them in faith,
to glorify God withal.

Again here it is apparent to us all, that God has a care of his Children;
even when they be dead: he will revenge their blood, and the injuries offered
to them, when they be gone. 1 Samuel 15.2.
He remembered what Amaleck had done to Israel many years after: the dogs
licked up Iesabels blood a good while after Naboth was slain, Jerusalem that
killed the Prophets, and stoned them that were sent unto her, does now drink
deep of the cup of Gods vengeance. Abel was dead, his body raked up in the
earth, yet his blood spoke, and God heard it, he set a brand of his indignation
on Cain for it: therefore let us take heed how we offer any wrong to God's
Saints; especially how we imbrew our fingers in their blood. Though they be
dead, and no man living will follow the Law against us, yet God will proceed
as a just Judge against us. This should encourage us to serve such a loving and
careful Master, as GOD is: sleeping and waking, living and dying, he takes us
under the wing of his protection.

VERSE 5.
1. A Narration of Enoch his translation, with all the circumstances belonging
to it.

2. A confirmation of it, Verse 6.

That Abel was made famous by faith, he has showed in the Verse going before.
Now he comes to Enoch, who also by virtue of faith is renowned in all ages.
None can please God, but by faith Enoch pleased God, and in token thereof he
was translated into heaven. Therefore Enoch was justified by faith.

In his translation there are these branches.

1. The cause of it, which was faith. 2. The end of it, that he should not see
death. 3. An effect of it; he was no more found. 4. The author of it, which was
God. 5. The reason, why, because he pleased God.
Enoch was adorned with many rare and excellent virtues: he walked not after
the course of the world in the broad way that leads to destruction; but in
the straight path of Gods Commandments: he was full of prayers, of alms
deeds, of fastings; yet his translation is adscribed to his faith. The just man
lives by faith. Faith is the wing whereby we must all fly into the kingdom
of heaven.

He was taken from one place, and put into another; from earth, and placed in
heaven.

The end. There is a time to be borne, and a time to dye. It is appointed to
all men once to dye. Enoch was a man, yet he dyed not: he had a birth day,
but no dying day. Death is a separation of the soul from the body. Enoch in
soul and body was taken up together into heaven: this was his privilege: he
escaped the axe of death, that cuts of all our heads.

For a proof of it: he was not found in any place here upon the earth. It is
like, that as some sought for Elias, when in a fiery charret he was taken up
into heaven, so some sought for Enoch; but he was no where to be found: a writ
of non inventus was returned.

Who took him away? not the Devil; that (as some write) took away some of
the Popes, but GOD Himself took him away. Why? For he pleased GOD: for it is
twice said of him, Genesis 5.22, 24. that he walked with God: he was no man
pleaser, but God pleaser.

The translation of Enoch is an intricate question, that has exercised the
heads of many Divines. Some are of opinion, that he was turned of a man into an
Angel: but God makes no such metamorphoses. In the kingdom of heaven we shall
be like Angels, but not Angels. The greatest part of the Hebrew Rabbis do
peremptorily avouch, that Enoch dyed. The Hebrew phrases imply death. Enoch was
taken away: and they that dye are taken away, Psalm. 39. ult. Job 32. ult. Ezekiel.
24. God has taken away such a neighbor of ours. 2. Aenenu: he was not: so
Genesis 42.36.

I but here the Spirit of GOD avoucheth in express words, making a Commentary
of that in Genesis; that he did not see death: and if he had dyed as other men,
Moses would have shut up his life with the same clause, that he did the rest.
Enoch lived so long, and he dyed: therefore certainly he dyed not. Some
maintain this assertion, that Enoch is still alive together with Elias, they
are kept by the providence of GOD in paradise: where either they eat of the
fruits of the Garden, or live without meat miraculously, as Moses, Elias, and
CHRIST did forty days together: then toward the end of the world these two
witnesses shall come forth, show themselves openly to all, encounter with
Antichrist, convert the Jews, and in the end shall be put to death. But I
proceed:

Saint Paul says, 1 Cor. 15.51. So Enoch did not dye, yet he was changed, in
soul and body, extraordinarily assumed in coelestem patriam, as Calvin
speaks; yet not in coelestem gloriam: freed from the miseries of this life,
yet not fully glorified. Some glory now they have, yet their full glory is now
deferred; till we all meet together in a perfect man in Christ Jesus.

It is here registered as a singular honor, that God vouchsafed to Enoch, to
take him away. They are sometimes deepest in GODS books, that are soonest
taken out of this world, being fitted for it by GOD Almighty. We read of two,
Trophenius and Agamedes, that having built a Temple to Apollos, required of the
GOD such a reward, as he thought to be best for men: he granted it, and within
three days they were found dead. The best we read of in Scripture tarryed not
long here. Josias was taken away in the flower of his age: our Savior CHRIST
lived not past thirty four years: because Enoch pleased GOD, he took him
away: Saint Peter being in the Mount said, it is good for us to be here: let us
here make our Tabernacles. So we say of the Mountain of this world, it is
good for us to be here, oh that we might make our Tabernacles here! whereas
indeed, it were best for us to be taken out of this wretched and sinful world,
as Enoch was. Here we are with wicked and deceitful men: there we shall be
with Holy Angels: here we sin continually; there we shall cease sinning: here
we are subject to innumerable calamities; there all tears shall be wiped from
our eyes. Let us desire God to prepare us for death, and then to take us away,
when it shall seem best to his heavenly will.

Pope Siricius out of these words Romans 8.8. framed this Argument: they that be
in the flesh cannot please God. Married persons are in the flesh: ergo. Enoch
was a married man, he begat Sons and Daughters, yet he pleased God. Abraham was
a Married man, he had two Wives, and many Children, yet he pleased God; in so
much as heaven is called the bosom of Abraham. Zachary and Elizabeth were
Married folks: yet they pleased God, and walked in all his Commandments
without reproof. Spiridion Bishop of Cyprus a Married person, yet he protested,
(...), yet never a whit the worse for divine duties. Let us not be drowned in
the pleasure of Marriage, as he in the Gospel. I have married a Wife, etc. Let
us keep the marriage bed undefiled, bring up our children in the fear and
nurture of the Lord, instruct our households in the ways of God, and out of
Marriage we may fly to heaven, as also out of a single life.

VERSE 6.
IT is confirmed by an axiom in Divinity: none can please God without faith:
he pleased God: Ergo.

Whereupon he sets down two properties of faith; (...) and (...) must be
supplied.

He does not say, it is hard or difficult: but impossible.

Not, to offer oblations to God: that did Cain: but to please God. The works
of the unregenerate do not completely please God. The Justice of Aristides,
the gravity of Cato, the chastity of Lucretia, the liberality of Caesar, were
not simply good works, quoad formam or finem, neither did they please God
perfectly, in as much as they wanted faith. Fides est matter and radix bonorum
operum: they did them not in faith, to Gods glory, therefore his soul took
not that pleasure in them which otherwise he would have done.

He does not say, without policy; Jacob a plain man, yet he pleased God:
not, without learning, honor, riches; Lazarus a poor man; yet pleased God:
not, without beauty; Ebedmelech a blackmore, yet he pleased God: but not
without faith. Therefore let us all be suitors to God, to give and increase
faith in us, that we may please him in this life, and be glorified with him
in the world to come.

I but all flatter themselves that they have faith: we have all faith. Have
ye so? Saint Paul says, all men have not faith, 2 These. 3.2. Examine it by
that touchstone, Gal. 5.6. 1 Ioh. 4.20. do thou boil in hatred against any
of thy brethren? do thou say with Achab, there is one Michaiah, but I hate
him? one neighbor, but I hate him? then thou have not true faith: for faith
and love go hand in hand together.

Where there is no love, there is no true faith.

Then he sets down the two properties of faith.

That comes, that is, that believes: pedibus fidei, John 6. Verse 44.

That He is: the Maker and Governor of all: that sees all and judges all.

The fool has said in his heart there is no God. There be too many of these
fools, it is to be feared, in the lap of the Church, Tit. 1. ult. they
profess they know God, but by their works they deny them. We go masked under
the vizzard of Religion, yet in our hearts we say, there is no God. We speak
fair, and mean foul: pretend love, and intend mischief. We lie, coozen,
dissemble, circumvent, and defraud one another: as if there were not a God that
sees all our juglings.

A rewarder. In this life, Genesis 24.35. The Lord blessed Abraham wonderfully, so
that he became great: he gave him Sheep and Beeves, Silver and Gold, men
servants and maid servants, and Camels and Asses: he rewarded Joseph with
honor, Hester with a kingdom, Dorcas with life again.

In the life to come, Apoc. 22.12. And behold I come shortly, and my reward is
with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. We shall be
rewarded for our service: yet not of merit, but of mercy, Luke 12.32. 2 Timothy
4.8. If we come diligently to Church, as Hannah, hear Sermons with a reverent
attention, as Lydia, lay them up in our hearts and practice them in our lives,
as the blessed Virgin Mary: if we come to the Holy Communion with sincere
affections, to have our faith strengthened, and to become new men: if we give
with cheerfulness to GOD 's Minister, that feeds our souls, to the poor
members of JESUS CHRIST; God sees it, and will reward it with joy of conscience
in this life, and with eternal happiness in the world to come. We serve not a
churlish Nabal, but a liberal master that will reward us for our service: yea,
a cup of cold water shall not be unrewarded.

Saul in seeking of his fathers Asses lighted on a kingdom. Let us seek GOD
as we ought to do, by prayer, hearing of Sermons, receiving of the
Sacraments, by tendering our service to him in the exequution of his Laws, and
he will reward us with an everlasting kingdom.

But how must we seek him?

1. Only: Aut Caesar, aut nullus: him only shall thou serve. We must not
swear by GOD and Malchum: we must not with Ahaziah seek to Baal zebub the God
of Ekron: but to Jehovah, the God of Israel.

2. We must seek him diligently: as Saul did his fathers Asses, the woman her
lost Groat: There must be no stone unrol led: as the Ninevites, who cried with
all their might.

3. At all times. In health, in wealth, in honor, Hos. 5. ult. In their
affliction they will seek me diligently: in health as well as in sickness. If
we have any losses by fire or water, let us seek unto God. We will seek to a
man so long as we need him: we need God at all times, therefore at all times
let us seek unto him.

4. In time: as Gal. 6.10. While we have time, let us do good unto all men,
but especially unto them that are of the household of faith: not as the five
foolish Virgins, who sought too late, and could have no admittance into the
marriage feast.

VERSE 7.
THe third is Noah, which was both before and after the flood. Whereupon some
paint him like Ianus with two faces: the one looking backward to the old world,
the other forward to the new world: the last Patriarcke of the old world, and
the first of the new.

In him consider,

1. A fact for the demonstration of his faith.

2. A commendation of his faith. His fact was the making of the Arc,
illustrated by the procreant cause and end thereof. The procreant or impulsive
cause is partly external, Gods warning: partly internal, a reverence he had
of it. The end proper: accidental, the condemning of the world.

Then the commendation of his faith: by it he was made an heir of the
righteousness of Christ, and so of the kingdom of heaven.

Noah: of Nuach, or Nacham, quietem or consolationem: his father imponit and
exponit nomen, Genesis 5.29. he was a type of CHRIST that brings the true
peace and comfort to the world. Come unto me all ye that labor, and I will
give you rest, Ezekiel. 14.14. Isai. 54.9.

The first motive cause that set him on work, was a warning given of GOD:
divino oraculo admonitus: which is amplified by the object thereof, namely, of
the destruction of the world by water, and his own preservation in the Arc.
These could not yet be seen, because they came not of an hundred years after,
Genesis 6.13. these things he believed, though he could not see them by his eyes,
and addressed himself to the exequution of them: so the coming of CHRIST, and
the destruction of the world by fire is not yet seen, yet because God has
given us warning of it in the Scripture, we must believe it: there was no
likelihood at this time that the world should be drowned, yet he believed it.

1. It is a property of faith to believe the word of God; though sense and
reason cannot comprehend it.

Noah had not a foresight and knowledge of the flood by Judicial astrology,
as Berosus affirmed, by the influence of stars and conjunction of planets: he
had it immediately from God.

2. God gives warning of his judgments.

The other mooving cause was internal: he did not count this a tale of a tub,
some old wives fable, but he had a reverent regard of it: o this is a fearful
punishment, which GOD will inflict on mankind, yet undoubtedly it shall come
to pass: has he said it, and shall he not do it? Thus with a reverent fear
he went to the making of the Arc.

We fear neither God nor man.

As a goodly vessel appointed by God.

Arca ab arcendo: because it kept away the waters from coming to them.

There were three principal things commanded by GOD to be made: the
Tabernacle by Moses, the Temple by Solomon, the Arc by Noah. The Arc in
sundry respects may be preferred before the other. 1. It was a making an
hundred years: none of them so long: this is probable, Genesis 5. ult. 7.11. Noah
was five hundred years old before: then six hundred.

2. It was the preservation of all the world. 3. All creatures came into it of
their own accord, by the secret instigation of God Almighty. 4. Though they
were of diverse kinds, some of a more fierce, some of a more mild disposition,
yet they continued quietly in the Arc an whole year together: Lions, Bears,
Lambs, Hawks, Doves, Vultures, etc. 5. It was guided not by any art or
industry of man, but by God Himself: there was no Pilot to sit at the Stern,
no Mast, no Sails, no Rudders, but God by His unspeakable providence, kept it
from the violence of the waters.

The proper end is taken from the deluge to come, Genesis 7.1. some of them were
wicked men, yet they had that temporal salvation, for the faith of Noah.

The word (Arc) is nearer. 2. The Antithesis requires it. As he and his
household were saved by the Arc: So the world was condemned by it: he
condemned it by his preaching, for 2 Pet. 2.5. and by his practice in making
the Arc before the eyes of them all, which might have brought them to
repentance.

The commendation of his faith is by the fruit of it.

He was not a purchaser of this righteousness, but an heir of it: he had it
by an inheritance from the mere love and mercy of God.

Not, which is by works, but by faith: he had many excellent works, he
sequestered himself from the world, he walked with God, he built the Arc,
when the whole world laughed at him for his labor: yet the building of the
Arc, nor any work of his did make him righteous, these showed him to be a
righteous man: but it was his faith alone that made him a righteous man: yet
this faith must have works: as ye see in all these examples. They are all
celebrated for some famous work or other. That faith which brings forth the
fruit of good works makes us righteous.

Who made the Arc? here it is said that Noah prepared it, and Genesis 6.14.
the conjunction is given to him alone. Some think it was made by him and his
three sons alone: but there is no likelihood of that. It is very probable,
that he got himself skillful artificers to make it: who though they derided
the prophecy of the drowning of the world, yet for money they were content to
be employed in that work. Some Carpenters, Masons, Plummers, Glaziers may
work in the building of a Church for the enriching of themselves, though they
care not a half penny for a Church, and the service of God in it.

Some made Noah's Arc, that were not saved in it: and many Ministers may
prepare others for heaven, and never come thither themselves.

When was the flood? Most Authors think, in May.

1. Because it might wholly be adscribed to the power of God, not any way to
the course of nature, as it might, if it had been in winter.

2. That the wicked of the world being drowned in the pleasures of the earth
might at that time of the year be deprived of them, when the earth was most
pleasant.

3. Because the flood began to dry up in the spring, Genesis 8.11.

4. Genesis 19.23. as it was a fair sun shine morning, when fire and brimstone
fell from heaven on Sodom: so the flood might come in the fairest time of the
year.

Whether were they all damned that perished in the flood? Some writers exempt
infants: they had something answering to baptism that saved them. The question
is about adulti, whether all they were damned? Epiphan. Ambrose, Beda affirm
that they went all to hell: yet when Christ came and preached in hell, they
were delivered: but in hell there is no Jail delivery.

Cajetan and Lyra say, that some of them went to hell: yet not ad locum
damnatorum, but ad limbum patrum, out of which Christ fetched them, when he
went to harrow hell, 1 Pet. 3.19.

For mine own opinion.

It is not like they were all damned: yet that reason of Saint Ieromes is not
convincing, Nahum. 1.9. following the Seventie he translates it, non vindicabit
Deus bis in idipsum: whereas in the Hebrew it is, it shall crush them at the
first time, there shall be no need of a second blow: God may justly punish,
both in this life and in the life to come, one and the same fault, that has
not been washed away with repentance.

But three reasons may induce us so to think.

1. Genesis 7.22. the flood was a prevailing forty days and forty nights. Some
that were hardened before, at the sight of the waters, running up into some high
mountains, might repent of their folly, and their souls might be saved: inter
pontem and fontem est misericordia.

2. Who dares avouch that they were all damned, that were destroyed in the
wilderness? that all went to hell, whom the earth swallowed up in the
conspiracy of Corah, Dathan and Abiram? and why should we affirm them to be
al damned that were drowned in the flood? we must judge more charitably of
them, that are swept away in temporal plagues and calamities.

3. Let us judge our selves, which is the strongest. As they were not all saved
that were in the Arc: Cham was a cursed wretch: so were they not all damned
that were carried away with the waters.

By his framing of the Arc before the eyes of them all, and his preaching to
them of the flood, the LORD might have sufficient matter by virtue thereof to
proceed to the just condemnation of them all.

Or the word (world) is here taken for the wicked of the world, as often in
Scripture, Ioh. 17. I pray not for the world: he brought in the flood upon the
world of the ungodly, 2 Pet. 2.5.

This warning was not for Noe alone, but for all the world, that seeing the
Arc a making they might repent. This is the goodness of God Almighty, he
gives warning of his judgments before they come: he shoots off a warning
piece: not like austere masters, who strike before they speak; but herein he
is like the Lion, that roares before he goes to his prey.

He gave a warning to Adam and Eve, that at what time they did eat of that
fruit, they should die: he gave warning of the destruction of Sodom; Lots
sons had warning to go their way, if they would have lystened to it: he gave
the Israelites warning of the captivity in Babylon; Jerusalem had warning of
her overthrow: Christ wept over it, and said; O if thou had known, Luke
19.42.
at the least in this thy day those things which belong unto thy peace! but now
are they hid from thine eyes. God gave the Ninevites warning, of their
destruction, that it was at hand. The old world had a fair warning of the
flood: they were warned of it an hundred years together. This is Gods mercy,
he does nothing but he reveals it to his Prophets, that they might open it to
the people. At this day, God gives us many warnings, by his Word and creatures:
by earthquakes, thundering and lightning, by blazing stars and fiery comets:
as we have had a fearful one of late years, continuing in some places of
the land a month together, portending wars, etc. Let us not stand in a slavish
fear of them, God is above them all: yet let them be as trumpets to waken us
out of sin. God has warned us by his Ambassadors and Preachers of the Word:
we have had warning, that if we loath the heavenly Manna of the Word, God will
take it from us; if we receive it not with all gladness when it is put into
our mouths, we shall go from East to West and not find it; yet this warning
does us little good; for all that, we are not diligent and cheerful in
hearing of Sermons and in the participation of other holy rites: we have had
warning of Adultery, Theft, oppression, cruelty, of coozning one another, that
there is a God that sees all, and will revenge all, yet these sins are ryfe
among us. As the old world had warning of the destruction of it by water, so we
have been warned of the destruction of it by fire: almost all the signs of
the day of Judgment are already past; yet we fear not that day, neither
prepare for it. All these warnings, because we have not profited by them, shall
be so many witnesses against us at the latter day. Praemonitus praemunitus:
but our hearts are so hardened, as that all the warnings in the world will do
us no good. We are angry with our servants, if they will take no warning; did
not I warn thee of such a thing: and then we think we have just cause to be
on his jacket: how many thousand warnings has God given us? and yet we, like
bad servants will take no warning? the Lord soften our hearts, that they may
enter into us, for the reformation of our lives.

Of what was he warned? In themselves they could not be seen: yet Noah saw
them by the eye of faith. The incarnation and passion of our SAVIOR CHRIST
could not be seen in the days of Abraham, because CHRIST was not then borne:
yet Abraham saw it by faith and was glad. Neither Heaven nor Hell can be seen
of us: yet by faith we see them, and believe them both. That terrible day, when
the world shall pass away with a noise -- cannot yet be seen: yet being
warned by God of it, we behold it, and know assuredly it shall be.

The resurrection is not yet seen, we do not see the dead rise out of their
graves: yet because GOD has said it, we believe it. The proper object of faith
are invisibilia; as for those things which we see, properly to speak, we do
not believe: when we shall see CHRIST our blessed SAVIOR in the kingdom of
heaven, then faith is turned into fruition: but there is singular use of it in
this world: and let us entreat the Lord to make bright the eye of our faith
daily more and more, that with Noah we may see the things that are not yet
seen.

What entertainment did Noah give to this warning? did he contemn it or set
light by it in his heart? no verily: he reverenced it. We must reverence the
judgments of GOD. When Daniel pondered in himself the fearful fall of
Nebucadnezar, that such a fair and beautiful tree which reached to heaven
should be cut down, he held his peace by the space of one hour, and his
thoughts troubled him. Dan. 4.16.
When the Angels were to blow their trumpets, there was silence in heaven,
Apoc. 8.1.
they were stricken with a kind of astonishment and could not speak. When the
book of the Law was read before Josiah, his heart melted at it, he reverenced
the judgment denounced in it. When this proclamation was made in Nineveh, yet
forty days, and Nineveh shall be destroyed: they all reverenced it, from the
King to the beggar, etc. they put on sackcloth, fasted, and prayed to GOD. Noah
hearing of a flood to come, fears it after a godly manner, and provides
against the coming of it. But some there be that are no more moved with them
then the stones in the Church-wall, Ier. 36.24. yet were not they afraid, etc.
When Paul preached of the resurrection and of the day of judgment, some in
Athens mocked at it: and Lots sons laughed at the destruction of Sodom that
was at hand. Let the Preacher thunder out GODS judgments against abominable
swearing, lying, flattering and dissembling, and other sins that reign among
the people; some laugh at it in their sleeves: tell them of the day of
judgment, when as all nations shall appear before the son of man; they set
not a straw by it, they are worse then Felix; he trembled when Saint Paul
discoursed of righteousness and the judgment to come: they are worse than the
Devils, for they believe that there is a GOD, and tremble at it. There is
great difference between trembling and reverencing. The wicked that have no
portion in CHRIST tremble, Apoc. 6.16.
they cry to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, etc. but the holiest men of
all must fear and reverence the judgments of God, and we must prepare our
selves for the avoiding of them, as Noah did. Does the Lion roar, and shall
not the beasts of the forest quake? Does GOD Almighty roar, does he threaten,
and shall we be moved with no reverence? as Noah reverenced the coming of the
flood, so let us reverence all the plagues that are denounced by God.

What does Noe in this his fear? he is not as a man amazed and besides
himself, but as GOD had commanded him, he prepares the Arc: he does not
reason with flesh and blood; surely this may be but a scarecrow, there is no
such inundation to come, God will not be so unmercifull as to destroy all that
he has made: as for the Arc, it must be very large to be a receptacle of all
kind of creatures, an hard and difficult thing to make such a Vessel; when it
is made, how shall I and my family be preserved in it? a thousand to one but
we shall be drowned: he admits no such consultation. But knowing from GODS
own mouth there was a flood to come, he prepares an Arc, for the saving of
him and his. Faith must leap over all difficulties, all stumbling blocks that
lie in the way: if God have said a thing, let us believe it, though all the
world seem to be against it. GOD has said, there is a Judgment to come, let
us all prepare for it, as Noah did for the flood. The old world prepared, and
Noah prepared: they prepared by building of houses, planting of Vinyards: So we
prepare for the world, but not to meet GOD by repentance. Noah prepared an
Arc for the saving of himself, and let us prepare the Arc of a good
conscience, for the saving of our selves at that day.

When it is said, he prepared the Arc, it is not to be imagined, that he
wrought it with his own hands: he was a Preacher, and it is not like he could
play the Carpenter, or shipwright. They may be like the Bell in the Steeple
that calls others to the Sermon, but has no benefit of it itself: they may
build up others, yet be unbuilt themselves. Therefore it shall be good for us
to preach to our selves, as well as to the people: lest while we preach to
others, we our selves be reprobates.

He provided all things for it: Wood, Pitch, Nails, made it after the form
God had prescribed, with many several Rooms in it.

This Arc in the judgment of all interpreters, was a type of the Church.

1. The Arc was made after Gods appointment, not after Noah's. So the Church
must be framed by GOD 's Will, and not by man's.

2. All were drowned that were not in the Arc: so all (regularly) are damned,
that are not in the Catholic Church.

3. The Arc was near drowning, yet never drowned; it was miraculously
preserved by God: So the Church may be brought to a low ebb, yet it shall
continue still.

4. There was in the Arc good and bad, clean and unclean: so we must never
dream to have all holy and sanctified persons that be in the Church.

5. In the Arc there were diverse mansions, and rooms; some for men, some for
beasts: so in the Church, Ioh. 14.2. In my Fathers house there are many
dwelling places.

6. The Arc had but a few in it, eight persons, yet there was the Church.

Universality is no necessary note of a Church. Christ's flock is but a
little flock.

Here we see what a privilege it is to be of the household of a godly man,
that may be as a Sanctuary to thee from temporal plagues and judgments. All
that were in the ship were saved for Saint Paul's sake, God gave him the souls
of them all. Noah's family was preserved for his sake: because cursed Cham was
of this household, he was saved. Potiphars house was blessed for Joseph's sake,
Genesis 39.5. Strive to be of the household of a man that fears God, that
shall be a shelter to thee from earthly punishments, thou shall fare the better
in the world for that. There is much contending, much suit made to be in the
house of a rich man, etc. If they be godly and religious men too, as many are,
it is well: but thou had better be in the house of a godly poor man, who
is deep in Gods books, then in the house of a wealthy and wicked Nabal. Labor
to be one of Noah's household.

Noe and his family were saved in the Arc; yet with much a do: they endured
much, they were in continual danger: they passed through many difficulties,
the smell of beasts, the Arc ready to rush on rocks and mountains. So the
Children of God shall be saved, yet through many tribulations, Apoc. 7.14. We
must look to be tossed with the waves of many afflictions before we come to
the kingdom of heaven: but let us be of good comfort in the midst of them
all. The Arc was hoysed, but not drowned: so though we be afflicted, yet we
shall not perish. God kept the Arc by the hand of his providence: and so will
he us too. He that has loved us will love us to the end, and will keep us to
his everlasting kingdom: the gates of hell may avail, but shall never
prevail against the Church. GOD in all extremities prepares for his Children,
Genesis 19.30. he prepared a place in Egypt for his Church in the time of famine:
he prepared Pharaohs daughter, and drew her to the river, to save Moses from
drowning: he prepared a Whale to receive Jonah, as soon as he was cast out of
the ship, and caused him within three days to set him safe on the dry land:
he prepared Pella for the Jews unto which they fled and escaped the fury of
the Romans: Eusebius.
he prepared an Arc by the hands of Noah, for the saving of him and his
household. Let us be thankful unto him, and depend on him.

There be many things that condemn a thief. The Judge condemns him, he
gives sentence against him: the evidence condemns him, and the witnesses
condemn him; but the chiefest of all is his own sin, the theft which he
has committed. So many concur in the condemnation of a wicked man. God
condemns him as a just Judge: his conscience brings in evidence against him
and condemns him: the holy and righteous men that have shined as Stars among
them, condemn them: but the greatest of all is their own sin. The Queen of
the South shall condemn the Israelites. She came from the uttermost parts of
the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. They had Solomon at home, and
regarded not the hearing of him. The Ninevites shall condemn them: they
repented at the preaching of one Jonah. The Jews repented not at the preaching
of many Ionahs. The Scripture shall condemn us: there is one that judges you,
Ioh. 5.45, 12.48.
even Moses in whom ye trust. The plentiful preaching of the Gospel, and the
small reckoning that is made of it shall condemn us. Noah condemned the world:
and our Noah's shall condemn us, if we regard them not. We for our parts had
rather save you then condemn you. Therefore receive with meekness the
engraffed Word, that by it ye may be saved in the life to come.

The good actions of godly men that were as real Sermons to preach to the
wicked, shall condemn them at the latter day. The holy and unspotted life of
Lot that vexed his righteous soul in Sodom shall condemn the Sodomites. The
Synagogue set up by the Centurion shall condemn those miserable wretches that
will give nothing to good uses: the continual praying of Annah, them that
never pray: The garments that Dorcas made for poor widows, them, that except
Law compel them, will give nothing to the poor: the diligence of a good
Scholar, shall condemn all the loytering Scholars in the School.

Therefore let us profit by these examples: let them be as spurs to prick us
forward to the practice of those good things which we see in them, especially
in the Preachers of the word, such as Noah was. If we contemn their preaching,
it shall rise up in condemnation against us in the world to come.

Faith, as ye see makes us heirs, not of silver and gold, houses and lands,
mannours and Lordships, but of the righteousness of Christ, by whom we have a
right to all things, 1 Cor. 3.22. We think highly of one that is heir to a
great Gentleman, a Knight, a Lord, etc. There comes such a Noblemans heir. I
but poor Lazarus that believes in Christ is in better estate than he, if he
want faith. Therefore let us pray to God for faith, that may assure us of the
inheritance of the kingdom of heaven, which surpasses all the inheritances in
the world.

And what manner of faith is it that makes us heirs of this kingdom? not a
verbal faith, that has nothing but fair words, and a glorious profession,
like the fig tree; but a working faith, such a faith as works by love, that
is full of good works, as Dorcas was. All these that be in this Catalogue had
works for the expression of their faith. Abel had his sacrifice. Enoch walked
with God. Noah had the building of the Arc, Abraham the offering of his Son,
Moses the leaving of Egypt, Rahab the preservation of the spies. None of them
but had works. Therefore if we say we have faith, and have not works, we
deceive our selves. Let us show our faith by our works, make up our calling
and election sure by them; then we are heirs of the blessed inheritance
reserved for the Saints in the life to come.

VERSE 8.
WE have had the faithful before the flood. Now, to them after the flood,
before the possession of the land of Canaan, and after.

The first is Abraham, who because he was the Father of the faithful,
entreating of faith he is more plentiful in him.

Here are three things for the celebration of his faith: concerning himself,
his Wife and his Son.

1. His obedience to GOD calling him out of his own Country.

2. His patient abode in a strange Country, whereunto he was called. Or, 1.
His egresse out of a Country, which he knew. 2. His progress to a Country
which he knew not.


The vulgar translation has it, he that is called Abraham, which before was
Abram. At the first he was called Ab -- ram, Pater excelsus: now Abraham, Ab
rab gnam, the Father of many Nations.

That dreadful name of GOD, Jehovah, has two Hehs in it. GOD, say some, gave
Abraham a letter of his own name, because GOD was to come of his loins: for
our SAVIOR CHRIST, who is GOD above all, blessed for ever, was of the seed of
Abraham: that is somewhat too curious. The change of his name did signify that
he was a great man, highly esteemed of GOD, and worthy to be honored of men.
The Jews boasted of him as of their Father: therefore above all others he
propounds him as an example of faith, that they his Children might tread in
his steps. He was of great fame among the heathen, as Josephus writes, many
ancient Historiographers make an honorable mention of him. Berosus,
Damascenus, etc.

He went not of his own head upon an idle and fantastical brain, he had a
calling so to do, whereof, Genesis 12.1. that was his warrant, his passeport and
license to travel withal. If all travellours had this calling, they might be
secure in their journeys.

Some go into strange countries in a male contended mind, because many things
cross them at home. Some, because they cannot live at home, some to see
fashions, for the satisfying of a carnal delight: these cannot so well look
for Gods protection. If thou go upon Gods calling, behold he will support
thee in thy going.

Every word in this calling might be as a dagger to the heart of Abraham. Out
of thy Country, kindred, etc. yet Abraham did not draw the neck out of the
collar, he obeyed God.

This obedience is illustrated by the place from whence he went: from his own
Country: and by the place to the which he went.

He went, tam animo, quam corpore.

But at this time when he was called, he had no inheritance in it.

2. As a blind man, that cannot tell where he goes.

God told him he would show it him: but as yet he had not showed him: when GOD
called him, he knew neither the name of the place, nor the Situation of it.

This was a mervailous exercise of his faith.

1. A man's native country is sweet and pleasant to all: nescio qua natale solum
dulcedine cunctos ducit, and immemores non sinit esse sui. Ulysses was very
desirous to see the smoke of his country. Shall I leave my Country, that has
been as a mother to bring me into the world and to nourish me in it? A man
in conscience, by the Law of nature is bound to his own country.

2. Here I am among my kinsfolk and acquaintance: there I shall be among
strangers, as an Owl among birds, to be wondered at.

3. Here I have plenty of all things: I know not what I shall find there. A
bird in the hand is better then two in the bush.

4. This Country I know: that I know not, God has not revealed to me so much
as the name of it: and shall I go to it? nay, soft a while, it is good
tarrying in mine own rest.

5. Here I may go up and down quietly: In my traveling I shall meet with
many dangers. Therefore it is good sleeping in an whole skin. Shall I obey
this vision? I will not do it.

Abraham admits of none of these consultations: but obeys God calling him. I am
sure my God is able to keep me in what corner of the world soever I am: for
all the world is his: and I am sure he will keep me; for he loves me, as the
apple of his own eye. Therefore come on it what will, I will obey Gods calling.
O admirable faith! without faith he could never have done it. Let us leave all,
if God calls us to it. It is not simply unlawful to travel. GOD commands no
unlawful thing. He commanded Abraham to travel. It is not necessary a man
should be like a Snayle, always carrying his house on his back: that becomes
a woman rather than a man. There is a time, when a man may leave his own
Country, and travel into strange Countries; yet great circumspection is to be
had in it.

1. A man must be called to it: we must do nothing without a calling.

Not as if every one should expect such a calling, as Abraham had, by Gods
immediate voice. We have our callings, but mediate. If a man be employed in an
Ambassadge to a foreign Prince, he has a calling to leave his Country for a
time. If a man cannot live in his own Country, and can more conveniently
maintain himself and his charge in another, he may go to it, so as he make
not shipwreck of Religion. If a man abound in wealth, and be desirous of
tongues, arts and sciences in another Country: he has a calling to it. Et sic
in reliquis.

2. We must take heed, that our families in the mean season be not
neglected: he that cares not for them of his house, is worse than an infidel.
A man under pretext of traveling, may not run away from his Wife and
Children.

3. We must have no sinister respect in it. Dinahs gadding abroad lost her her
Virginity. We must not make traveling a cloak to cover theft, murder,
adultery, and other gross and notorious vices. God can find us out in all
places: for whither shall we fly from his presence?

4. We must not imagine our traveling to be meritorious, as pilgrimages were
in former times: they should merit heaven by going to the holy land, by
visiting the Sepulcher at Jerusalem, etc. whereas when we have gone all the
world over, we are unprofitable servants.

5. Let us take heed in traveling, that we travel not away faith and good
conscience: wheresoever we become, let us keep our selves undefiled of the
superstitions and corruptions that be in other countries. Let us keep our
religion safe and sound, that the least crack be not found in it. We make a
fair traveling, if we travel in the Devils cloakes. A great sort of young
Gentlemen rashly and unadvisedly, by traveling are like the Scribes and
Pharisees: they compassed Sea and land, to make a proselyte; and when they had
made him, they made him threefold more the child of the Devil: so they by
their traveling make themselves threefold more the Children of the Devil,
greater swearers and blasphemers, fornicators and adulterers, then they were
before. They went out Protestants, and come home Papists: they went out
religious, and return Atheists. Traveling is a dangerous thing. Let us not
take it on us, unless we be some way or other called to it, as Abraham was.

He went not alone: he carried his old father, his nephew Lot, and it is like,
sundry others, whose names particularly are not expressed. No doubt, for the
world, he was exceeding well in Chaldea: it is very like he had a convenient
house to dwell in, sweet Gardens, and pleasant Orchards, droves of Cattle and
flocks of Sheep, great store of pastures and arable grounds about his house,
fair household stuff, etc. Would it not grieve a man to part with all these,
and to go he knew not whither? yet Abraham leaves all at GODS appointment: so
must we all do. We must tread in the steps of our father Abraham. We in
England, God be thanked, are well seated; by report of travelers it is one of
the fattest ylands on the earth: here we live quietly under the reign of a
religious King, we have all things fit and convenient about us: yet if God
should call us out of our own Country, let us be content to forsake all, as
Abraham did. We are tenants at will, ad voluntatem domini: all that we have is
at Gods disposition, and let him dispose of us where it pleases him. If we
leave all at Gods appointment, we are no loosers by it: we shall have an
hundred fold, even in this world: and in the world to come life everlasting.
Abraham was a great gainer by his going out of his Country, God made him a
great man afterward: he was able with his own household servants to wage
battle with five Kings, and conquered them. God blessed him with abundance of
Gold and Silver, Sheep, Camels, Oxen, etc. Hesters banishment was an occasion
of a kingdom to her: and some have lived better in exile, then in their own
country, as Themistocles. Howsoever God deals with us in this world, we
shall have an abundant recompense in the life to come: therefore let us go
whithersoever G^d shall call us, as Abraham did: he that forsakes not father
and mother, houses and lands, nay, he that hates them not for Gods sake, is
not worthy of him.

VERSE 9.
1. THe manner of his abode. 2. The cause of it.

1. Factum, the fact.

2. Motivum the motive that stirred him to it.

The land of promise: which was so called, because it was promised to him by
God, and that often.

He went not back again in a discontented mind: but though he found few
outward encouragements to tarry, yet he stays by it.

The manner of his abode is set forth, 1. By the quality of the place. 2. By
the form of his habitation.


How did he abide in this land? not as a Lord and master in it, but as a
stranger: it was a strange Country to him, he had no house, no land in it, no
not the breadth of a foot: he was feign to buy a piece of ground to bury his
Wife in. It was inhabited by a strong and mighty nation, that were mere
strangers to him. This might have shaken his faith. Is this the Country that I
and my seed shall have? what likelihood is there of it? yet by faith he abode
in it, waiting for the accomplishment of Gods promise.

2. What was the manner of his dwelling in it? he dwelt not in a stately and
magnificent City, in a strong and defenced Castle, in a costly and sumptuous
house: not in a Tower, the height whereof reached to heaven, as the Tower of
Babell did: not in one tent, but in many: remooving his tent hither and
thither. He dwelt in tents, that were soon set up, and soon pulled down
again: partly because he might be at Gods call, ready to remove when he would
have him: as indeed Abraham was a continual flitter: partly also, because he
knew his seed should go into Egypt, and the time was not yet come, when he
should have a full possession of the land of Canaan. Therefore in the mean
season he contented himself with Tents. In commemoration whereof they had the
feast of Tents or Tabernacles.

Yet he kept great hospitality in his Tent: a poor house, yet a rich house
keeper, Genesis 18.1.
he sat of purpose daily at his Tent door, as a bell to toll strangers and
passengers to him. It was wont to be said, golden Chalices and wooden Priests!
so now a days it may be said, golden houses, wooden house keepers; a great
house, a large house, yet little meat in it. It may be sufficient for
themselves: strangers, nay neighbors seldom drink of their cup: a great sort
of brave chimneys, but little smoke in them: many a Noble man's house, scant
smoakes once in a year. Cornelius a Captain had no stately house, yet his
alms were great. Gaius had no glorious house: yet an host to the whole
Church: wheresoever we dwell, though in a Tent or booth, yet let us do good
with that which we have, as Abraham did; our house shall be the better blessed
for it.

Abraham dwelt in a Tent, yet GOD protected him from all enemies and dangers.
We never read that thieves brake into his Tent and spoiled him, of that which
he had. In a tempest, thundering, and lightning, the Tent was not set on fire.
It is better to be in a poor cottage under Gods wing, than in a magnificent
Palace without his favor. Ahaziah dwelt in a sumptuous building, yet he got
a fall that cost him his life. Michah had a strong house: yet the Danites came
and took all in his house.

Lot had an house in Sodom; Abraham had but a Tent: yet Abraham was safer in
his Tent, then Lot in his house. GOD kept Daniel in the Lions den, the three
Children in the fiery furnace, Jonah in the Whales belly: he preserved Abraham
in his Tent: and he will for ever keep his Children in the meanest Cottage in
the world.

The manner of his dwelling in the land of promise is illustrated by his
companions: not he alone, but Isaac and Jacob. Whether he and they dwelt
together in Tents at the same time, cannot be defined. If we respect Abraham's
age, they might: for he lived after Isaac was borne seventy five years, and
after Jacob was borne fifteen years; yet whether that be the meaning of the
Holy Ghost or not, I dare not affirm: they in their time dwelt in Tents, as
Abraham did in his time, because the promise was made to them all: to Abraham
and his feed. They were intailed in the promised land with their father.

The Canaanites had Cities and beautiful houses to dwell in. Abraham Isaac and
Jacob dwelt in Tents: the wicked may have fairer dwellings in this world, then
the godly.

Now we have sumptuous and magnificent buildings: immediately after the flood
they erected a Tower, the height whereof reached to heaven. The Canaanites had
towns and Cities that were walled up to heaven. Ahab had his Ivory palace,
Nebuchadnezar his stately Babel. There are many gay buildings in all places:
but as CHRIST said of marriage, from the beginning it was not so. What manner
of house did Adam and Eve dwell in? Abraham, Isaac and Jacob? these worthy and
renowned Patriarcks dwelt in Tents: and incommemoration hereof there was
instituted among the Jews a feast of Tents and Tabernacles, which was kept
with great solemnity; by the space of seven days, they sat in Boothes. Let us
not be too careful, nor too curious about our dwellings. Neh. 8.17.
Our Savior Christ the Lord of all, had not an house to hide his head in: at
his dying day he commended his mother to Saint John, who took her home to his
house. There is as free a passage to heaven out of a poor beggarly Cottage, as
out of a Kings Palace. Let us not spend too much cost about our earthly
houses, but labor to build up our selves as houses to God in this life, that
when we must remove out of these buildings, be they greater or lesser, we may
be received up into that house that is made without hands, in the life to come.

GOD does not immediately perform his promises: he will exercise our faith
and patience in the expectation of them. This land was Abraham's now by promise,
yet his seed had not the possession of it many hundred years after: yet
Abraham by faith waited for it: he that believes will not make have. We must
not be too hasty, but tarry Gods leisure. So the heavenly Canaan the kingdom
of heaven, is ours by promise: fear not little flock, it is your Fathers
pleasure to give you the kingdom: yet we must pass through many tribulations
into this kingdom. Let us with patience bear them all, and at the length,
though it be at a long run first, we shall be sure to be partakers of it:
for heaven and earth shall pass, but not one title of Gods Word shall fall to
the ground.

VERSE 10.
WHat moved him to content himself with so mean a dwelling? they made not so
much reckoning of their habitation in this world, as of that in the world to
come: therefore they did not greatly care how they dwelt here. As for the land
of Canaan, though it were a pleasant Country flowing with milk and honey, yet
they knew they were not to continue in it long: this made them to look up to
the heavenly Canaan, whereof the earthly was but a type and figure.

Erecto capite: his eye was also to that, quasi accepturus.

Here he had a Tent, but there he looked for a City: (...), for that City
which alone deserves the name of a City: it excells all earthly Cities in two
respects. In regard of the foundation, and the founder thereof.

The Tents wherein they dwelt, had no foundation, they were fastened with nails
to posts and stakes set in the ground: but this City has a foundation: earthly
houses have but one foundation, and subject to earthquakes, storms, tempests,
inundations, and other casualities; this has many foundations, Apoc. 21.14.
and nothing can shake those foundations. The Tower of Siloam, it is like, had a
good foundation, yet it fell: the Abbeys and Monasteries had sure foundations;
yet they are fallen: the palaces of Kings, Noblemen, and Gentlemen have strong
foundations, yet they shall all fall; but the heavenly Jerusalem shall never
fall.

Aholiab and Bezaleel made the Tabernacle, Hyram the Temple: Carpenters and
Masons set up these Cities: but God Himself is the maker and builder of this
City. These Cities may be overthrown by waters: the Sea may come in tumbling
and sweep them away: these Towns and Cities may be consumed with fire, there
be burnings almost every day: these may be sacked with the enemy, and made
even with the ground, as Jerusalem and the Temple are, which were the wonder
of the world: we may be driven by famine and pestilence out of those towns
and Cities: howsoever they stand a while and we in them; the time shall come,
when the earth with all the goodly buildings that be on it shall be burnt with
fire. Therefore let us use these Cities as we used them not: let our hearts
and affections be in this City, whose maker and builder is God. We have not
here an abiding City. London is no abiding City, York, Norwich, no Town is an
abiding Town: Death will give us a remove out of all Towns: but in this City
we shall abide for ever, and reign with CHRIST for evermore: therefore let us
all long for it.

He does not say, that he believed there was such a City, but he looked for
it, Iud. 5.28. We look out of our windows on sights in the streets, Gardens,
Orchards, etc. but not out of the windows of our hearts for this City. He
that looks shortly for a new Coat, will not be much in love with his old:
for a fair house, will not care for a cottage. We look after our wool and
cloth, houses and lands, etc. Let us look daily for CHRIST 's coming, that
will put us in possession of this City. As Saint Peter said unadvisedly of the
Mount, let us say likewise of this City, it is good for us to be here.

VERSE 11.
WE have had the things which he did severally by himself: now of him jointly
with his Wife: because he touches a thing which he could not do without his
Wife. Of whom he entreats.

1. Severally by herself, then jointly together with others.

Also:] together with her Husband. The Faith of them both concurred in this.
Lyra shows himself delirantem senem, in avouching that Sarah had no faith in
this: he interprets it thus, through faith, that is of Abraham, Sarah also
received power: but by it is meant her own faith.

1. Certain facts of hers, which she did by faith.

2. The event that issued on them.

1. A narration of facts. 2. An illustration of them by the cause thereof.

The facts are two, Conception and Procreation.

1. She received strength to conceive seed: to receive and retain the seed
that came from Abraham. It might be translated, to the emission of seed, to
the dejection of seed. For the child is framed of the seed of them both:
though Aristotle be of another opinion: matter a materia, quia ministrat
materiam procreandae proli, as the father does.

Whereupon Christ is termed the fruit of the Virgins womb. She was now by the
course of nature past conceiving of seed, being ninety years old: a woman, as
Pliny observes, for the most part is past child bearing at fifty, then how
could a woman conceive ^t ninety? not by nature, but by the grace and power of
God: therefore it is said, through faith she received strength to do it.

2. She brought forth a Child, when there were two obstacles in the way;
barrenness and old age. Genesis 16.2.
The one is to be repeated out of Genesis. God had shut up her womb: the other
is here expressed. Besides the season of age, it was now no seasonable time for
a woman of ninety years to have a child: yet by faith she had one.

And why? what was the cause of it? because she judged him faithful, etc. this
Lyra referres to Abraham, Genesis 18.12.
because he judged -- as for Sarah, she laughed at it, and Abraham thought it
an incredible thing: yet it may be adscribed to Sarah her self: as for
Abraham, he is not mentioned at all in this verse.

Some affirm that that laughter of Sarahs did issue ab admiratione, non a
dubitatione, as Abraham's did. Abraham laughed, admiring, not doubting of Gods
promise; so did Sarah: Genesis 17.17.
yet the laughter of Sarahs must needs be condemned. 1. She opposes two
impediments to the promise: which Abraham does not. 2. She is reproved by God
for laughing, Genesis 18.12.13.14.15.
who tells her that it issued from infidelity. 3. She her self covers it with
a lie: which she would not have done, if it had not been an evil laughter.

How then is it true, that She judged him faithful who had promised? At the
first she doubted and derided it: but afterward being reprehended by GOD,
better instructed by her husband and pondering in her mind, that it was GOD
Almighty which had spoken it, she believed it, and judged him faithful.

He that has promised me a child is able to fulfill his promise: faithful to
perform that, which he has promised: therefore though I be barren and old too,
I shall have a child, Genesis 21.6, 7.

1. Women, as ye see, may have faith: they may believe in Christ, be members
of his body and heirs of the kingdom of heaven. The woman was the first in the
transgression; yet she shall be saved, though it be a kind of purgatory, by
the bearing of Children.

2. God is pleased with married folk: he that lives in the flesh cannot
please God, that is as Pope Siricius expounds it, in marriage. Romans 8.8.
Abraham and Sarah were married folk, yet they pleased God. Let not Virgins
think to carry away all the praise. As CHRIST was borne of a Virgin, so of a
Wife too: fear not to take to thee, Mary thy Wife. Marriage serves more for
the propagation of the Church, then Virginity does. God is glorified by married
folk, as by Virgins: as in Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebeccah, Zachary and
Elizabeth, with sundry others.

Psalm. 127.3.
3. Children are the inheritance of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is his
reward. When Sarah was a young woman, in the flower of her age, the mirror of
beauty, a passing fair and beautiful woman, full of blood, then she had no
Child: when she is old and past childbearing, then she has a Child: these be
the Children, said Jacob to Esau, Genesis 33.5.
which God of his grace has given me. We adscribe the fruits of trees to God,
and shall we not adscribe the fruits of our bodies to him? whenever we have
Children in our young age, or old age, let us praise God for them.

VERSE 12.
THe event: which is amplified by the naughtiness of the root, and the
innumerable branches that sprang from it.

In regard of her faith and her Husbands together.

Of one sprang many: of one Abraham; for it is of the masculine gender, Isai.
51.3.
by his copulation with Sarah. Gorr. ab uno, that is, utero. (...).

And what was that one? a dead one too. Why, he was now but an hundred years
old? Methusalem begat Lamech, when he was one hundred eighty seven years
old. But they were of greater strength before the flood then after.

2. Abraham sundry years after this begat Children: then why should this be
counted a wonder? he was lively afterward, and was he dead now? those he
begat of Keturah which was a young woman. 2. Even the power to beget them was
of God too, not of nature: in himself he was a dead stock.

The multitude of the branches is set forth by two similitudes. Abraham had two
kinds of Children: the one after the flesh, the other after the spirit. By the
stars, as some will have it, are meant the godly, whose conversation is in
heaven, as the Stars be in heaven; and they shine by their virtues like
stars. Under the sand of the Sea is comprehended the carnal progeny of
Abraham: propter instabilitatem, numerositatem, ponderositatem,
infructuositatem: they are light and inconstant as the sand is. But that is too
nise. Generally the similitude is to be extended to the whole race of Abraham:
his seed is compared to them both for number.

Some Mathematicians have taken on them to set down the just number of the
stars: they are but one thousand and twelve in all. They are beyond their
books, too presumptuous to go beyond their limits. God can number them all,
and call them by their name, but to us they are innumerable, as the sand of the
Sea is: and so were they that came of Abraham. By the lip of the Sea: the
shore is as the lip of the Sea, the extremity of the Sea, as the lip is of
the mouth: and as the lip keeps things within the mouth; so does the shore
keep in the Sea.

Multitude of Children, a populous posterity is the blessing of God.

2 Samuel 19.17. Iud. 12.9. Psalm. 128.3. Children are compared to arrows:
blessed is the man, that has his quiver full of them. A full quiver of these
shafts is the gift of God. Let us not take too much thought for providing for
them: he that feeds the young Ravens, will feed our Children, if we trust in
him. Philip asked, where shall we have meat for so great a multitude? Let not
us say so: he that sends mouths will send meat, if by faith we depend on
him.

2. We must not tie God to the course of nature. Of Abraham and Sarah that were
dead, came as many as the stars and the sand. Ezekiel. 37.10.
Of a company of dead bones stood up an exceeding great army. When GOD had
foretold of a plenty, there was a Prince which took exception against it: 2
Reg. 7.2.
if God would make windows in heaven, could this come to pass? he was trodden
under men's feet for it. Let us not object against Gods power, Let us not call
Gods power into question, pinion his arms, shut him into prison. Let us not
say, God can do this or that: he does whatsoever he will, in heaven, etc.
LORD if thou will, thou can make me clean. He cannot do those things that
imply a weakness, a contrariety to himself; for that were to deny himself:
but whatsoever imports a power, and is agreeable to his blessed will, that he
can do. Shall any thing be impossible with GOD? it was not possible by the
course of nature, that Abraham and Sarah at this age should have a Child; yet
they had one, and of that one Child came a great people. There is no
possibility in nature, that the dead should rise again: yet God can effect it.
Let us keep no Sophismes or Problems against Gods power; but in all things,
though it seem impossible to the world, let us depend on him by a true and
lively faith.

Now to the things recorded of Abraham after he had a Child.

The one is common to others together with him: the other proper to himself
alone. That which was common, is his perseverance in faith to the end.

That, which is proper to him, is the offering of his Son.

In the former, 1. A narration of their perseverance, Verse 13.

2. A confirmation of it.

The narration is first set down; then amplified.

VERSE 13.
HE does not speak it of Abraham alone, he dyed in the faith: then he should
have made an iteration of it in all the rest: wherefore for the avoiding of it,
he affirms it generally of them all.

Viz. Abraham, Isack, Jacob, Sarah mentioned before, and all the godly too that
sprung of them before the possession of the land of Canaan.

He does not say, these lived in faith a great while, but dyed in faith: they
carried their faith with them to the grave.

According to faith, that is, that faith whereby they had committed themselves
wholly to God, and by virtue whereof they depended on him: or (...) for (...).

This is amplified by certain effects: negative; affirmative: internal,
eternal.

1. They had not the promises, yet believed them.

They received with gladness the promises made to them: they had the
pronuntiation, the delivery of the promises, but they had not received the
accomplishment of them.

The promises, that is, res promissas. Not the earthly things promised to them:
but they received the kingdom of heaven: he uses the plural number, because
one and the same thing was often promised to them.

Gorrhan expounds it. They received them not plene and perfect; because though
they had requiem in limbo; yet, as yet they had not gloriam in coelo: but that
is a devise not easily to be made good.

The land of Canaan was promised to them: yet they had not received it.

CHRIST the Savior of the world was promised to them, that he should come of
Abraham's seed: but as yet he was not come, the kingdom of heaven whereof the
land of Canaan was a type, was promised to them: but as yet, they received it
not: yet they believed certainly that they should have them, and dyed in that
faith.

Faith is an evidence of things that are not seen. The victory over sin,
death and the Devil is promised to us; we shall be more than conquerors; yet
sin gives us many a fall, the Devil assaults and tempts us, death seaseth on
us and takes us away: yet let us believe Gods promise. As yet we have not
received the resurrection, yet believe it; nor the kingdom of heaven, yet
believe it, and dye in that belief: though thou kill me, I will believe in
thee.

The affirmative.

2. Though they received them not, yet they saw them: not near hand, but far
off: not with the eye of the body, but of the soul, which is faith. Abraham in
the birth of Isaac saw CHRIST. In thy seed, that is, in CHRIST, shall all
nations be blessed. Isaac was borne of a woman, which by the course of nature
was never like to have Children: so was CHRIST of a Virgin, that never knew
man. In the oblation of Isaac he saw the oblation of Christ on the Cross. When
Isaac bore the wood wherewith he should be burnt, he saw Christ bearing his
own Cross: when he saw Isaac bound on the Altar, he saw Christ fastened to
the Cross.

So the Israelites afterward saw CHRIST afar off in the Paschall Lamb, and
the rest of the sacrifices: but blessed are our eyes -- we as yet see the
kingdom of heaven, but afar off; but one day we shall see God face to face.

3. They were persuaded they should have them, and dyed in that persuasion,
they saluted them: as Marrinors espying the shore afar off, skip for joy,
hoping shortly to be at it; so these seeing the celestial Canaan afar off,
rejoiced at it, and embraced it with the arms of faith. So we must rejoice at
the sight of death, as Simeon and Paul.

4. They confessed themselves strangers here. Genesis 23.4, 47, 9.
Whereby it is apparent they looked for a Country in heaven, and dyed in faith,
expecting that Country.

(...) is opposed to (...): Citizens, that have a r^ght and interest in the
City may go up and down boldly; strangers are fearful, standing at the
courtesy of others. (...), that come as wanderers from another people.

(...) without house and home.

They confessed it.

1. By deeds: by their dwelling in tents.

2. In words, before all men.

It is not to be extended to the Patriarcks before the flood: for some of them,
as Enoch, dyed not. It is to be restreyned to them after the flood. He does
not say, all these were rare and excellent men beautified with singular graces
of GODS spirit, deep in his books: therefore they were exempted from death:
there is none that has that privilege. Death is a Cup whereof all must
drink* there is no man living, but shall see death. Wise Solomon, godly David
that was a man after Gods own heart, is dead: strong Samson, fair Absalom,
wealthy Nabal is dead. Lazarus dyed, and the rich man also dyed, and was
buried. Beggars dye, and Kings dye. Have I not said, ye are Gods? yet ye
shall dye as men. It is well observed by Saint Augustine that it fell out by
the providence of GOD, that the verb morior should not be declined after the
same manner, that other verbs of that kind be: orior ortus est: morior mortuus
est, to declare that death signified by it, cannot be declined.

Mors non cogitur abesse, sed cogitur non obesse. Death cannot hurt the godly,
it is rather a benefit to them: yet they dye. This we can all say, nothing so
certain as Death; yet we make no use of it: for all that, we bathe our selves
in the pleasures of sin, we are set on the merry pin, we follow the world so
earnestly, so greedily, as if we should live for ever.

We are like the fishes that are skipping and leaping in the water, and yet by
and by are taken in the Net. We know that the Net of Death is continually
spread for us all: yet we are as jocund, as if no net were laid for us.

It is said Eccles. 7.4. That the living shall lay it to heart. We talk of
Death, we carry Death about with us, we see it daily in other men. Almost
every week a buryall in many Towns: yet we live as if we should never dye.
Damocles the Parasite was set in Dionysius chair, he had all the honor and
pleasure that could be devised, but when he considered the sword hanging by a
slender horsehayre over his head, he took delight in nothing. Death as Gods
sword hangs over our head continually, it is senibus prae foribus, and
adolescentibus in insidiis. The staff of death stands before the door of old
folks, and it may steal on young men ere they be aware, yet we regard it
not. It causes us not to have our conversation in heaven: but we are as great
earth worms, as if we should never dye.

All these dyed: but how did they dye? in the faith. All dye, but all dye not
in the faith, 1 These. 4.16. some dye in CHRIST, and some live to the world, and
dye in the world. Achitophel dyed, but it was not in faith: he dyed a
malecontent, in a proud conceit of his wit and wisdom, that his counsel
should not be followed, which was wont to be reputed, as an oracle from
heaven. Judas dyed, but it was in desperation, in infidelity, not in faith, he
could not be persuaded that his sins were washed away in the blood of CHRIST*
and therefore took a rope and hanged himself. Cain dyed, but not in faith:
for he cried, my sin is greater than can be forgiven.

Happy are they that dye in faith. The Scripture does not simply say, blessed
are the dead: but, that dye in the Lord.

Job dyed in the faith. I am sure my Redeemer lives -- Old Father Simeon dyed
in the faith, with CHRIST in his arms. LORD, now let thou thy servant --
Saint Paul dyed in the faith: the time of my departure is at hand. From
henceforth -- A sweet thing to dye in the faith. All that dye quietly to the
eye of the world, dye not in the faith. The Psalmist says of the wicked, there
are no bands in their death. Good men may have sore temptations, when they lie
on their death beds, Psalm. 7 3.4.
through the distemperature of the brain, and the vehement pain of the body,
they may deliver some fearful and impatient speeches, savouring of
infidelity: as Job did in his pangs, and yet for all that dye in the faith.
Live in the faith, be plentiful in the fruits of faith, and thou shall be
sure to dye in the faith.

It is the greatest commendation that can be given of any, that they dyed in
the faith. While we live, we are in the field and battle, we may receive many
a wound from sin and the Devil: but being dead we are conquerors, have Crowns
on our heads and palms in our hands, as it is in the Revelation. Does such a
man live in the faith, as Cornelius did: when his prayers and alms deeds
proceeding from faith went up into remembrance before God? that is a thing to
be rejoiced in: yet such a man may have many a fall, as David and Peter had. Is
it reported truly of any, that he dyed in the faith, such a man made a godly
end? that is the height of all commendation. We cannot well praise a fair day
before night, because many storms may be in it: neither can we give a man his
full and perfect commendations till he be dead. Therefore this is registered of
these fathers, tanquam fastigium laudis, the very top and crest of their
praise, that they dyed in the faith.

All good men have the like confession, 1 Chronicles. 29.15. 2 Cor. 5.6. Genesis 23.4.
Abraham was a mighty rich man, Genesis 24. Yet but a stranger and pilgrim. David
was a King: yet but a stranger. Have thou fair houses, large lands, and ample
possessions? art thou a rich Clothyer, a wealthy Merchant, a Gentleman, a
Knight, a Lord? yet acknowledge thy self to be but a stranger: there is a time
when thou must part with all, yea with a kingdom if thou have it. The very
heathen confessed this. The orator could say, natura dedit nobis non habitandi
locum, sed commorandi divorsorium: this world is but an Inn, it is no dwelling
house.

Now if we be strangers on the earth, as we must all confess our selves to
be, then let us carry our selves as strangers.

1. A stranger is no medler in the Country wherein he is: he takes that, which
is requisite for him: he looks to his own business; but he does not
interpose himself in the affairs of the commonwealth, he leaves them to those
that be of the Country. A stranger must be (...), as the heathen said. Even so
being strangers in the world, let us meddle no more with the world then needs
must But we are drowned in the world, our minds are on the world all the
week, all the year long: we meddle little with the Scripture, with prayer,
heavenly meditations: we are altogether in and about the world.

2. Strangers must not think to bear sway in the Town and Country where they
dwell: the natural inhabitants will not digest that, Genesis 19.9. the Sodomites
could not endure that Lot should be a King among them. So we being strangers
in the world must not make account to domineere in it, to have all men at our
control: we must be content to be underlings here, that we may be aloft
hereafter, the faithful are often put to the wall, and the wicked are Lords
over them. This we must take patiently, because we are strangers.

3. Strangers and Pilgrims are wont to be abstemious, 1 Pet. 2.11. a stranger,
a Travellour, if he be a wise man, does not set his mind on feasting and
banqueting, he takes a morsel, and so away. So being strangers here, we must
lead a sober life, take no more of the world then will serve us for our
journey, we must reserve our feasting till we come to that place, where we
shall eat bread with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

4. Strangers must look for no great love: for the most part they are hated in
the Country where they be, and they are wished to be out of it: even so the
world loves her own: we are not of the world, we are men of another world;
therefore mervaile not though we find little friend-ship in the world. Dogs
will faune on them that be of the house: but they will bark at strangers, fly
in their faces, and be ready to pull them down: so because we are strangers to
the wicked, no marvel though they bark at us and bite us now and then.

5. Strangers have a longing desire to be at home. If an English man be in
Spain, Turkey, India, he thinks every day two till he be in England: oh that
I were with my Wife and Children, with my friends and neighbors at home! So
being strangers in this world, let us not make too great account of it: let us
desire to be at home in our heavenly Jerusalem: let us say with Saint Paul, I
desire to be dissolved, and to be with CHRIST, which is best of all. But a
number of us say in our hearts of the world, as St. Peter of the Mount: we are
well here, I would to God I might never go from hence.

6. Strangers do not heartily love that Country wherein they be, they may love it
in some sort, but nothing to their own Country; so being viatores we may take
viaticum, but let us not love the world; let us use it, as if we used it not.
This world must be as wormwood to us in respect of the joys of heaven: we may
use silver and gold, houses and lands, but let us not love them. Let the
heavenly Canaan our native Country have all our love.

7. If a stranger come to an Inn, he looks about him and says: this is a
fair Inn, here I have a goodly Chamber, I fare well for my money; but this is
no place for me to tarry in: so we should think and say of the world; I have
a convenient dwelling, meat and drink enough; I thank God, I want nothing: but
this is not my place of abode, I am but a stranger here, all these things I
must forgo.

I would to God that this were deeply engraven in the hearts of us all, that
we did effectually consider we were strangers on the earth. We say we are
strangers, but we live as Lords: We say with that rich man, Luke 12. Soul,
eat, drink, and be merry, thou have goods laid up for many years. Our lives
and deeds bewray that we think nothing less, than that we be strangers. A
strange thing that strangers should be so bewitched with a strange Country, as
we are with the earth.

VERSE 14.
HE insisteth in the proof of the latter effect; they seek a Country out of
the world: therefore they are strangers.

Where, 1. What manner of City it was, which they sought. 2. The reward for
seeking of it.

The confirmation of it is by a collection deduced out of their own confession.

They that confess themselves to be strangers on the earth, do give notice to
all the world, that they look for a permanent Country in heaven, and so dyed in
that faith: but these confess themselves, etc. Ergo.

Such base, such contemptible things of this world: manifest it to all.

With a fervent desire, not (...). Where they shall abide for ever.

This world then is not our Country. Socrates is highly commended for his
answer, being demanded what Country man he was, he answered (...) mundanus. The
whole world is my Country: all Countries are alike to me. Yet in truth we have
no Country in the world. England is not our Country: Heaven, properly to
speak, is our Country: as Christ says, call no man father here on earth; so
call no Country your Country on the earth.

Now heaven is our Country; so we must seek it; it is worth the seeking, and
we cannot have it without seeking: seek the kingdom of God -- We must seek it
by prayer, reading of Scripture, hearing of Sermons, by godly and fervent
desire of the heart, by heavenly meditations -- Our whole life ought to be a
continual seeking of heaven: but alas we seek for silver and gold, Sheep, and
Oxen, houses and lands, and let heaven go; we are like Aesops dog, that
snatched at the shadow, and lost the substance. We seek more for shadows,
then for the substance: all the week long we are seeking of the world, and
scant on the Lords Day, no day in the week do we seek heaven.

VERSE 15.
THis is illustrated. 1. By a declaration of the Country, which they sought.

2. By the fruit and reward of their seeking.

Object. They professed themselves strangers, because they were out of their
soil, the land of Chaldea.

Sol. That cannot be the Country which they had longed after: for if their
mind had run on that, they had opportunity and time enough to return in: they
had leisure, but they would not take it.

1. He shows what Country it was not which they sought.

VERSE 16.
2. WHat it was: which is first, described comparatively: then plainly pointed
out with the finger.

The reward.

1. A favor or prerogative in this life.

2. In eternal happiness in the life to come.

Exodus 3.15. he is the God of the whole world in general: he is the God of the
wicked, for temporal blessings; of the faithful, for spiritual and eternal.
Matthew. 22.32.


He that is the God of the whole world, is now the God of three men. Chrysostom.

It is a glory to servants to have a denomination from their Lords and Masters,
I am servant to such a Noble man; but it is no honor for a Lord to say, I am
the master of such a poor man, such a beggarly fellow is my servant: yet God
glories of us, that he is our God, Master and Father. He makes this a piece
of his style: as if a puissant Prince would be called the King of Pigmies.

He has prepared -- Hebr. 13.14. Ioh. 14.2.

They do not merit it: GOD in mercy prepares it for them, When? Vide Matthew.
25.34.

God prepares many excellent things for us in this world: but none comparable
to this. He prepared the world, as an house furnished for man at the first.

We can but prepare temporal houses for our Children.

Some by this City understand the Church, which though it be on the earth, is
called heavenly, because her chiefest part, Christ her head is in heaven, and
her conversation is in heaven. Hyperius.

But they were in the lap of the Church already, within the walls of that City,
they needed not to seek that which they had.

Heaven then is better than earth: it is better by many degrees. Men choose that
which they think to be best: we choose earth rather than heaven* therefore in
our opinion that is the better. What fools, what dolts be we? men are ready to
change for the better: who would not change a beggars cottage for a Kings
Palace, a patcht Cloak for a Princes robe? We say heaven is the better, yet we
are loath to change our dwelling on earth for it: by our good wills, we would
tarry here still. We say, heaven is a better country then this: but we would
feign continue in the earth still.

Many a Child is ashamed of his Father, when he comes to great honor. We were
base and ignominious wretches, yet God was not ashamed of us. If a great man
have a kinswoman, that is poor, yet if a fair and beautiful woman, happily he
will not be ashamed of her. We are all foul and black by reason of sin: yet
God is not ashamed of us: and shall we, one of another? A King is not ashamed
of a beggar: and shall one beggar be ashamed of another? Shall one earthen Pot,
though it be a little guilt and tipped with silver, be ashamed of another earthen
Pot? Though thou be a rich man, and have more silver and gold than thy
brother; yet be not ashamed of him: thou art earth as well as he: ye are Pots
of one Potter. Constantine was not ashamed of the Bishops: the Angels are not
ashamed of us, they acknowledge themselves to be our fellows and brethren: and
shall we be ashamed one of another? Though he be never so poor a man; if he
believe in Christ, be not ashamed of him.

2. As God is not ashamed of us, so let us not be ashamed of him: though Christ
be afflicted here on earth, yet let us not be ashamed of him and his Gospel:
for if we be, he will be ashamed of us, when he comes with his holy Angels.

How does it appear he is not ashamed of us? because he disdaineth not to be
called our God.

He does not say; to be called their Lord and Master, but God. I thank my God:
that we read often. This comprehends all good things for this life, and that
to come: happy are the people that be in such a case, blessed are the people,
whose God is the Lord. The Lions shall be hungerbit, but they that have God for
their Lord, shall want nothing that is good. This may strengthen us against
poverty, sickness, and all calamities, against sin, Satan and death it self.
Will any child fear want, that has a rich and loving father? our God, our
Father, is rich, heaven and earth are his: he is most loving, he tenders us as
the apple of his eye: therefore we can want nothing that is good. The Lord is
our God, our shield, Protector, and defender: therefore let us fear nothing.
If God be on our side, who can be against us? Nay, Matthew. 22.32.
this may comfort us against death it self. From this one word our Savior
proves the resurrection: he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for
all live to him. Though we dye, God is our God, he will raise us up again at
the latter day, and translate us into his kingdom. This may be a pillar of
comfort for us to lean upon, that God is our God.

By what token does he show himself to be our God? because he has prepared a
City. God is an excellent preparer. He prepared the world, as an house well
furnished, against the coming of man into it: he prepared a Table for the
Israelites in the wilderness; he gave them water out of a stony rock, and
Manna from heaven: he prepared a kingdom for Hester, when she was a poor
banished maid: he prepared a Whale for Jonah, when he was cast into the Sea:
insomuch as the Psalmist exclameth; how great is thy goodness o Lord, which thou
even then preparedst for the sons of men! He prepares for us, the fowls of
heaven, fishes of the Sea, beasts of the field, to be our nourishment: but of
all preparations this is the greatest, he prepared for us a City, a most
glorious City. All the Cities in the world are not worthy to be named the same
day with this: thieves may break into these Cities; so cannot they into that.
These may be sacked by enemies; so cannot that. These Cities shall be burnt at
the day of Judgment; this abides ever: these need the Sun by day, and Moon by
night, this needs none of them, for it is enlightened with the glory of the
Lamb. In these there is good and bad; there none but good, the spirits of just
and perfect men. In these there is sometimes dancing, sometimes weeping; there
is no weeping at all, but continual singing to GOD Almighty: these Cities may
be famished; so cannot that: we shall eat of the hidden Manna and of the tree
of life in the Paradise of God for ever. Here our fellow Citizens are men and
sinful men, there we shall be Citizens with the Angels: here Citizens have
their Gowns whereby they are known, which at length are moath eaten and come
to nothing; there we shall be clothed with the white robe of immortality,
that lasts for ever. In these Cities, some are rulers, some ruled; there we
shall all be Kings and reign with CHRIST for ever. These Cities are made by
Carpenters and Masons: this by God. O admirable City! Let our (...) be in it
in this life: that we may be taken up into it, and remain in it for ever in
the life to come. Yet this City is little regarded. If York, Norwich, London
were ours, we would think our selves happy men: yet we count the preparation
of this City nothing. Ye talk of a City to come. I would I were Lord of one
Town here, take thou that City. Many a profane Esau is ready to say so: but
let us be thankful to God for this City.

Hebrews 11.17.18, 19.
WE have here a Catalogue of famous Christians in the Old Testament: whereof
some were before the flood; others after: as Abraham, with whom having begun,
now he adds and concludes of him in these Verses. Wherein we have a tragedy
and a comedy: a tragedy, in a fathers oblation of his Son; a comedy in the
unexpected restitution of his Son to him. 19. a sorrowful tragedy in his
going; a joyful comedy in his teturning.

Touching the former, 1. An admirable work performed by Abraham.

2. The motive that set him on work, his steadfast faith in the resurrection,
Verse 19. In the work the author of it, and the exquutioner of it.

VERSE 17.
THe author of it was God that tried him.

Man tryes, the Devil tries, and God tries: homo tentat ut cognoseat, man
tries, to know what is in another. Tentare a teneo: we try, that we may quasi
manu tenere, hold as it were with the hand, and have a certain knowledge of
him whom we try. As the Queen of Shebah hearing of the fame of Solomon went to
try him with hard questions, 1 Reg. 10.1. Diabolus tentat, ut decipiat, to
coozen us and to destroy us. So the Serpent tempted our great Grandmother Eve,
and beguiled her.

Deus tentat, ut quis sit homo hominibus innotescat, that what is in man may be
made manifest unto men: he tried Abraham, (...). St. Chrysostom. not to learn
more than he knew before, but to demonstrate the excellent graces that were in
Abraham, the world; how he preferred God before all things, even before his
only Son. Thus CHRIST tempted Philip about the loaves, Ioh. 6.6. God knew
what was in Abraham: but he tried him, to make others know: whereas, Genesis
22.12. he speaks it after the manner of men. When a man has tried the
fidelity of his friend, he says, now I know thou love me: so God applying
himself to our capacity, having tried Abraham, says, now I know; yet no
access of knowledge to GOD: he knew what was in him before.

An admirable trial! a wind that might shake the strongest Cedar in Lebanon:
ye may take a view of it, Genesis 22.2. Every word is very emphaticall.

1. He does not say, send him by another, but take him thy self: carry this
innocent Lamb to the slaughter house thy self.

2. Not five or six years hence: but now, presently without delay.

3. Not thy servant, but thy Son. Tully took heavily the death of his
servant: how might Abraham take the death of his Son?

4. Not one of many, but thine only Son: though thou have no more but he,
take him, kill him.

5. He names him. I do not mean Ismael, though thou art loath to part with
him, but Isaac.

6. Whom thou love, so dearly, so tenderly: all thy love is contracted into
him: thou have no other to love.

7. To the land of Moriah, which is a great way off, three days journey. Oh
what thoughts did trouble him all that while?

8. When he comes there, he does not say, hang him on a tree, drown him, which
had been intolerable for a father to do; but burn him, which is the
sharpest death of all: offer him up for a burnt offering to me.

9. Consider the conference that was between him and Isaac in the way, which
might strike Abraham to the heart: Father, here is fire and the wood, but where
is the Lamb for the burnt offering? alas my Son, said Abraham in his heart,
though he spoke it not with his tongue, thou must be the burnt offering: no
doubt but the tears went trickling down his cheeks.

Oh how wonderfully was he tried? all these were as so many daggers held at his
heart.

10. Besides all these, the Hebrews report that the Devil appeared to him in
the shape of a good Angel, and dissuaded him from the offering of his Son,
telling him it was a most monstrous and unnatural fact, greatly displeasing to
GOD Almighty. No doubt, but the Devil was busy with him to withdraw him from
Obedience to GOD: but that of his apparition is a feyned fable.

That we see, how this holy man was tried: he was tried indeed to the utmost: a
wonder he did proceed to the action.

Thus it pleases God to try his Children. A Goldsmiths tries his gold by
casting it into the fire: and Saint Peter calls it the fiery trial. A Captain
tryes his Soldiers before he brings them into the field. One friend tryes
another, and God in love and wisdom tries us all, how we are affected to him:
he sent false Prophets and dreamers of dreams to try the Israelites, whether
they would cleave to him with all their hearts and souls, or not, Deuteronomy. 13.3.
he tried David by Shimei that rayled on him, and hurled stones at him, being a
King. A great indignity for a King to bear! he tried Joseph with sore
imprisonment, till iron entered into his soul: he tried Job with the loss of
seven thousand Sheep, three thousand Camels, five hundred yoke of Oxen, and
she Asses: he tried him with the death of seven Sons and three daughters at a
clap, after a fearful manner: the house fell on them as they were
banqueting, and they were crushed in pieces: he tried him with boyles in his
body, from the Crown of his head to the sole of his foot. The arrows of the
Almighty stuck in his soul: he tried him to the full. Others have had their
several trials: but Job had all trials: yet he stood immovable in them all:
he tried Lazarus with extreme poverty: he desired crumbs, and could not get
them: he tryes some women with churlish Husbands, as he did Abigail: he tryes
some with froward Wives, as he did Job: he tryes some with stubborn and
disobedient Children, that make them weary of their lives, as he did Isaac and
Rebeccah with Esau: he tryes some by taking away their Children one after
another, on whom their greatest delight was fixed: he tryes by taking away our
goods by fire, water, thievs -- gatherings for fire almost every week: he
tryes some by tedious sicknesses, and diseases that continue long together: a
wearisome trial! he tryes us by malevolent tongues that cast aspersions upon
our names. He corrects every Child: So he tryes every Child. GOD has many
ways to try us: that the trial of our faith being more pure than gold, may be
more illustrious in this world, and we made more fit for the celestial
Jerusalem in the world to come. Let us entreat him to strengthen us by his
holy Spirit in all trials. As he seems to cast us down with one hand, so
let us be suitors to him to uphold us with the other, that we may stand
steadfast and immovable in all trials and temptations, to his glory and the
salvation of us all.

Let that suffice for the author of the work. Now to the exequution of it.
Where,

1. A bare narration of the work: then an amplification of it.

Offered up Isaac.] Nay, bate me an ace of that.

Offerre caepit, or offerre voluit. Voluntate he did it, though non re:
intentionaliter, though non actualiter. He pretermitted nothing on his part for
the offering of him up: therefore God accepted of it, as if it had been done,
Genesis 22.16. he extolls it to the skies. There be Martyrs desiderio and facto.
Origin was a Martyr in desire, when he was a Child. If his mother had not kept
away his Clothes, he had gone to be burnt with his father. So Abraham Conatu
and desiderio offered up Isaac.

David built the Temple, in will and desire: he made a great preparation for
it, three thousand Talents of gold, seven thousand Talents of fine silver -- 1 Chronicles. 29.4. So Abraham made all ready for the offering of his Son.

The wood was ready, the fire was ready, the Altar was ready, the knife in his
hand was ready to cut his throat, which he would have done, if GOD by his
voice from heaven had not stayed him: therefore he might well be said to offer
him up.

There is an amplification of it, ex part patris, on the Fathers behalf, and
ex part pueri, on the Child's behalf.

Not only he that begat Isaac, but that had received the promises concerning
Isaac, that in him all the Nations of the earth should he blessed, he had not
only heard of these promises, but received them into his breast and bosom,
locked them up as precious Jewels in the closet of his heart, there keeping and
nourishing them: yet he that had received the promises must kill him, that was
the foundation of the promises; a great shaking of his faith!

2. Ex part pueri: not a servant, but a Son.

Not an adopted Son, but begotten of him: the fruit of his body, and his own
bowels.

Not one of many, but all that he had: begotten in lawful Matrimony, and to
whom alone the promises were tied. Ishmael was his begotten Son too: but he
was begotten, of his maid. Isaac was his only begotten Son of his Wife in
lawful marriage. 2. He was his only begotten Son, ratione promissi; the
promise was made to Isaac, and to no other: quantum ad istam conditionem, he
was anigenitus. Lyra.

VERSE 18.
THat which he said of the promises, he confirms by Scripture.

To the which Abraham his father it was said of him, Genesis 21.12.

This he heard not from others, but with his own ears, and that from the
mouth of God, that cannot lie. The promised Messiah shall come of Isaac: yet
he must be offered up. Then what shall become of his seed and the salvation
of the world?

God here seems to be at variance with himself: (...); faith wars with
faith, one Commandment wars with another: and the Commandment wars with
the promise, as Saint Chrysostom well observes. That promise was, that in
Isaac should his seed be called, and that the Savior of the world should come
of Isaac: yet now Isaac must be slain, before he had any seed. A strange
trial!

Again, the Law of nature written in Abraham's heart, said; love thy Child,
preserve thy Child, especially such a rare Son as this is, rarely borne, and
endewed with rare qualities. This Commandment crosses that, and says, kill
the Child. What a contrariety was this? how did this perplex Abraham and cast
him into the briars? but faith did reconcile all: and all these obstacles set
aside he offered him up.

A most worthy and unmatchable example! The like is not to be found again in
the whole world. As Joel says of the Grassehoppers and Caterpillars in his
time: hearken o ye elders, hear all ye inhabitants of the land, whether has
such a thing been done in your days, or in the days of your fathers? so may
we say of this; hearken all ye that live on the face of the earth, though ye
be as old as Methusalem, whether has such a thing as this been done in your
days, for a Father to offer up his only Son, at the commandment of GOD?

Manasses caused his Sons and his Daughters to pass through the fire to his
Idols; so did other Idolaters: but they offered them up to devils, not to God,
contrary to the will of God, in a blind superstition, at the instigation of the
Devil, that was a murderer from the beginning, and delights in blood; but
Abraham did it in a pure devotion, to testify his obedience and love to God,
at the commandment and provocation of God, to glorify him withal. Those
Idolaters it may be were not present at the offering of their Children; or at
least, they offered them by others. Abraham with his own hands offered him
himself. We read of a Woman in the Maccabees, 2 Maccab. 7.
that saw seven of her sons cruelly tormented before her eyes, because they
would not eat swines flesh: yet she was not the tormentour of them herself.
Mauritius that good, yet unfortunate Emperor saw all his sons slain before
his face by usurping Phocas, and at the death of every one, he uttered these
religious words, justus es domine, and justum judicium tuum: but he did not
kill them himself. In profane histories, sundry are recorded to have offered
their Children: as Agamemnon did Iphigenia, though she were carried away by
Diana. So did diverse others among the heathen: but these offered them to
devils, not to God, and they did it not with such a divine resolution as
Abraham did.

I but what say ye to Iephte? he offered up his only daughter: unless a
Son, be valued at an higher rate than a daughter. So that he comes not behind
Abraham.

Yes many degrees. 1. Some collect out of the Hebrew words, that he did not
offer her up: but let it be granted; yet it is not worthy to be compared with
this of Abraham; for he did it not with his own hands: and if he did, it was
in a rash and preposterous zeal: and his vow like Herod's oath had better been
broken then kept; he had not Gods warrant for it, as Abraham had.

2. In her the promises were not made, as here in Isaac. There only nature was
tried, here faith was tried and nature too. An example that cannot be
pattern'd! Job lost seven sons and three daughters at a clap: Abraham but one:
that was as much as Abraham's, if not more. Nothing near.

1. Jobs eye saw it not, neither was he charged to kill them with his own
hands,

2. In none of them were the promises made: this was the principal shaker of
Abraham's faith.

In what a perplexity think ye was Abraham, when he took this journey about
such a sorrowful business as this was? how might Sarah take on, when she
missed her Son five or six days, and could not tell what was become of him,
nor her husband? If Zipporah cried, bloody husband, to Moses, for circumcising
the foreskin of her Sons flesh; how might Sarah have cried, o bloody, o
cruel Husband, that killest thine own Son, and mine too? In what a pitiful
case was Abraham, when he built the Altar, couched the wood on it, bound Isaac
to it, put to the fire, and was stretching out of his hand to cut his throat?
If David kept such an howling for Absalom an ungracious child, o my Son
Absalom, my Son Absalom, when he saw him not; he was a wicked son, a rebel, a
Traitor, one that went about to put his father besides the saddle, and to
justle him out of his throne; yet how lamented he for him? how might Abraham be
pierced in this time and cry, o my Son Isaac, my Son Isaac, my sweet Child,
the only staff of mine old age, my loving, my dutiful, and obedient Son,
beautified with so many glittering virtues, the joy of the world, to whom the
promises are tied, must thou be killed, and that by thine own father too? must
I be the butcher, and kill thee? this touched him to the quick.

If the bowels of the harlot yerned within her, when her child was to be
divided by Solomon's sword: how did Abraham's bowels yerne within him, when with
his own sword, he was to take away the life of his own Son, yea of his only
Son?

This might wring tears from the eyes of us all. Chrysostom, hom. 3. in 2
Cor. reports, that when he preached of this story, the people fell a weeping.
Gregory Nissen seeing a lively picture of this history, could not pass by it,
without tears, and in truth it may worthily affect us all: and let us make it
our own case, it will cause us all to weep. Oh what a lamentable sight was
this, to see Abraham about the killing of his only Son? that a father should
be put to this extremity, to be the butcher of his Son, his only Son, upon
whom depended the salvation of all the world? you that be fathers, though ye
have many children, are you willing to kill any of them your selves? Surly no,
unles ye be unnatural fathers. Upon a turbulent sedition in Thessalonica,
Theodosius in an anger took order that seven thousand should be put to death.
A Merchant in the City that had two Sons there put into the Calender of those
that should be executed: Sozom. l. 7. c. 28.
their good old father put up a supplication for his two sons: the Soldiers
pitying him, told him, they could not save both, for then the Emperors number
would not be fulfilled; but they said, they would spare one, choose which he
would. The poor father looking rufully on both, could not tell which to choose:
while he delayed, both were slain. If God take away but one or two of our
children, we are in Rachels case, we will admit no comfort. God took all that
Abraham had.

Abraham had but one Son, whom he loved dearly, a virtuous, a Religious
Son, of whose loins should descend the Messiah and SAVIOR of the world: yet
he offers him up, because it is GODS Will, as a burnt offering to the LORD.
Where is this faith, this love now a days to be found? There are many
Naboths, few Abraham's. GOD may take up that complaint against us, which he does
against Eli. We honor our Children above God. Though they lie, swear, and
blaspheme the name of God, etc. we cannot abide they should have any correction
for it. I had rather God should be dishonored, than my Child corrected. If we
will not sacrifice them spiritually, how corporally, as Abraham did? Will we
not correct them, and will we kill them at Gods commandment? He that loves
father or mother, wife or children, more than me, is not worthy of me. God gave
us them, and he can take them away at his pleasure, and shall we be more
wedded to them then to God? My life, says Paul, is not dear to me, so I may
fulfill my course with joy: and shall any Child be so dear to us, as to pull
us from God and heaven too? our lives and own souls must not be dear to us,
so as we may glorify God, much less our Children. As the Christians said,
when with weeping eyes they could not hold Paul from Jerusalem; why then say
they, the will of the Lord be done: so let us in all things. Will God have our
goods, our children, our lives? the will of this blessed God be done, The Lord
gave, etc. blessed be his name.

We have had the admirable act performed by Abraham. Now to the motive of it
which was a certain persuasion which he had of the resurrection.

His accounts being cast up, after many consultations to and fro, this was the
total sum, the final conclusion wherein he would rest. Though I offer up my
Son as a burnt offering to God, yet he is able to raise him up again from the
dead. Of the ashes of one Phoenix, arises another Phoenix: and of the ashes of
one Isaac shall rise another, yea the same Isaac in substance that was before,
In whom all the nations of the earth shall be blessed: therefore I will do it,
come on it what will.

O the magnanimous spirit of a right heroical man! resurrectio mortuorum
fiducia Christianorum. It is the principal pillar that Christians have to
lean upon: if we had hope only in this life, of all others we were most
miserable. Therefore let our faith be firmly grounded in the resurrection, as
was the faith of Abraham the Father of the faithful.

We have strong inducements thereunto.

1. Is, potentia dei: idoneus est reficere, qui fecit: he that made our bodies
of nothing at the beginning, can remake them when they are consumed to nothing.

2. Is bonitas dei. I am the GOD of Abraham, of Isaac and Jacob: that was
spoken after they were dead: though they were dead, yet he was their God, the
God, not of their souls only, but of bodies too. Absit, ut Deus, manuum suarum
operam, Tertul.
ingenii sui curam, afflatus sui vaginam, liberalitatis suae haeredem,
testimonii sui militem, Christi sui sororem, Spiritus sancti templum in
aeternum destituat exitium. Be it far from God to forsake the work of his
own hands, the care of his own wit and invention, let us make man after our
Image: the bladder or sheath, whereinto he breathed the breath of life, they
heir of his liberality, the Soldier of his testimony, that has fought for
him, as well as the soul: the sister and member of Christ: the Temple of the
Holy Ghost. Be it far from God, that he should leave this in eternal
destruction. As the soul and body have been consorts in labors in this life,
so shall they be in rewards in the life to come.

3. Exempla resurgentium, the examples of them that have risen from the dead,
in the Old and New Testament. Christ raised up three: the one in domo, which
was the daughter of Iairus; the other in feretro, on the beer, the widows
Son of Naim: the third in Sepulchro, in the grave, which was Lazarus, when he
began to stincke. These are praeludia nostrae resurrectionis, forerunners or
pledges of our resurrection.

4. Dulcis titulus mortis, a sweet description of death. It is but a sleep. I
would not have you ignorant concerning them that are fallen asleep. 1 These.
4.13, 14. Ioh. 11.12.
Those that sleep in JESUS will GOD bring with him. LORD, said they of
Lazarus, if he sleep, he shall do well enough. The dead are but asleep,
they shall do well enough. Philip slept securely, while Antipater was awake:
and the dead sleep safely, while God is awake, the keeper of Israel that
neither slumbers nor sleeps. Therefore let us be firmly persuaded of the
Resurrection, as Abraham was: he believed that God was able to raise up Isaac
from the dead, and let us believe that GOD can raise us all from the dead.

Romans 4.19.
Abraham was a good considerer. At the first when God promised Isaac, he
considered not his own body that was dead. Now when he is to loose Isaac, he
considers that God was able to raise him up. O heavenly consideration! in all
extremities let us consider the power of God, as Abraham did. Art thou
grievously sick, yea even to death, is there but a step between thee and
death? yet consider, that God, if it be his pleasure, can set thee on thy
legs again. Art thou fallen to poverty, of a mighty rich man art thou become
an exceeding poor man, as Job was? yet consider that God is able to raise thee
up again. Is thy Son or thy daughter dead? is thy Wife, or thy Husband dead?
is thy friend dead, that was as thine own soul? Weep not over much, consider
that God is able to raise them up from the dead: they be not amissi, but
praemissi: they are gone into heaven before, and we shall follow after. Do
thou thy self dye, is thy body laid in the grave, does it there putrify to
dust and ashes? yet consider that God is able to raise thee up again. Say with
that holy man, I am sure my Redeemer lives -- The consideration of Gods power
must comfort us in all calamities.

We have had the Tragedy: now to the Comedy.

Hereupon followed a joyful event: he did not receive him in a parable, but
truly and indeed: he received him from the dead, that is, from the state of the
dead, in a parable: he was not deceived in his expectation.

In a parable, that is, (...), in a figure, says Chrysostom, in a dark and
obscure figure: or as he unfolds it more plainly afterward, (...), in an
example; in similitudine quadam, as Henry Stephen expounds it: quodam modo, as
Beza, after a sort, as it was in the translation before this. In a parable, in
a similitude, for all parables are similitudes. Neerenesse to death is a lively
type and figure of death, whereupon it has the name of death, 2 Cor. 1.10.
blessed be God, that has delivered us from so great a death. Yet Saint Paul
did not dye then. So the neerenesse of death wherein Isaac was, was a
similitude of Death: the Altar was built, the wood laid on the Altar, Isaac
bound on the wood, the fire was ready, the knife was coming to his throat to
kill him. Therefore Abraham received him from the dead in a similitude.

Old Father Jacob received his Son Joseph as it were from the dead: he verily
thought he had been torn in pieces by wild beasts; yet at that time he was
alive and ruler of the land of Egypt. Genesis 37.33.
Hezekiah received his life in a similitude, from the dead: for sentence of
death was pronounced against him by Gods own mouth. The Jews in the provinces
of Ahasuerus received their lives in a similitude, from the dead. The Kings
letters were sent by Posts into all quarters, to root them out, kill and
destroy them all, even Men, Women and Children in one day. S. Paul and all that
were in the Ship with him, received their lives in a similitude from the dead.
For all hope that they should be saved was taken away, Act. 27.20. The King
and Queen, and Prince that then was, the Lords spiritual and temporal: the
Gentlemen of the lower house: in them we Protestants in England received our
lives in a similitude, from the dead -- at the powder treason.

Thirty seven barrels of Gunpowder were cunningly couched under the vault of
the Parliament house: Vaux the same morning had his match in his hand to set
them on fire: we were in the mouth of death: in a manner as near as Isaac: but
by Gods miraculous providence, through the quick apprehension of the wise and
learned King we were delivered, as Isaac was: which deliverance requires
hearty thankesgiving to God.

Gods trials begin with a tragedy, and end with a Comedy. The Psalmist says
of the faithful, Psalm. 126. ult. they went out weeping and carried precious
seed, but they shall return with joy, and bring their sheaves with them: So
Abraham poor desolate Father, went out weeping with his precious Son Isaac
to be offered up, but he returns rejoicing, and brings home the sheaves of
heavenly comfort with him. Gods dealing with his Children is contrary to
Ezekiels scrowle, it was sweet in his mouth, and bitter in his belly. God
begins bitterly, but ends sweetly, as he did with Abraham. Ye remember the
patience of Job, and what end the Lord made: So remember the trial of Abraham,
and what end the Lord made. The beginning was sorrow, the end was joy. Let us
bear with patience the bitter beginning, that we may be partakers of the
sweet ending.

He that will save his life, shall loose it, but he that loses it for my
sake shall find it: he that will save his goods by the denial of Christ,
shall loose them: he that will save his Children by dishonouring of God shall
loose them, as Eli did: he cockered his Children and lost them, they were both
slain in a day. Abraham is content to loose his Child for God's sake, and he
finds his Child: there is nothing lost by obeying God, we shall be gainers by
it. Contemn divitias, and eris locuples: contemn gloriam, and eris gloriosus:
contemn filium, and habebis filium. We shall have fathers and mothers,
Children as it were in this world, and in the world to come life everlasting.
Let this encourage us to submit our selves in all obedience to God in all
things, as Abraham did.

VERSE 20.
WE have had the Chapter of death: here follows that of faith: wherein we have
an Ilias of examples.

1. Of the Grandfather, then of the Son, lastly of the Grandchild.

Isaac was in a manner dead, yet he lives still many a year; and at his going
out of the world blesses his two Sons: which was a demonstration of his
faith: he lived and dyed in faith, as Abraham had done.

But it seems the Holy Ghost might have made choice of other works of
Isaacs, serving better for the expressing of his faith then this: Genesis 24.63.
he was a devout and religious man, much given to prayer and heavenly
meditation, he went into the field to pray or meditate: he continued praying
twenty years together for a Child, Genesis 25.21.
and would not give over: he was obedient to God, and followed him from place
to place: why does not the Apostle make mention of these, but of his blessing?

1. These were common to others together with him.

2. This blessing did most of all argue, that he had lively faith in the
promises of God made to him and Abraham, when as he does bestow the things
promised, with as great assurance, as if they were accomplished already. This
blessing is a fulfilling of all the promises: therefore most fit to declare his
faith, and to publish it to all the world.

In this blessing there are three things.

1. The isntrumental cause whereby it was done. 2. The persons blessed. 3. The
things whereabout they were blessed.
For the instrument, it was by faith. Was it so? he was coozened in it by
Rebeccah and Jacob: and he was induced to it against his will and purpose; for
he was determined to have blessed Esau.

1. Distinguish between the action, and the infirmities in it. Nature lead him
one way, and grace another: yet for all that, all things were governed by GODS
providence, as Exodus 1.20. and this blessing was an execution of Gods will,
decree and counsel, and in some fort issued from faith in him. Some
infirmities of a man cannot mar the action of God: as a sick man is a man;
so a weak faith is a faith.

2. His constant resolution after the blessing was ended, does show it came
from faith. Genesis 27.33.
I have blessed thy brother already, and he shall be blessed.

The voice of faith.

For the persons, Jacob is set first, because the birthright was his, his
brother having sold it to him, and he was the man whom God loved, and in whom
the promises were continued. Esau was a profane person, yet he had some
blessings: Therefore both are included in the blessing, though diversely.

Concerning what did he bless them? not things present, but to come:
temporal and eternal, in this life and that to come: which was an evident
declaration of his faith. For faith is a ground of things hoped for: he
pronounced of things to come, as certainly, as if they were already: and they
fell out as he had said.

Neither were the things to come temporal blessings alone, but especially
spiritual, shadowed out by earthly things. In the blessing he said to Jacob,
Genesis 27.29. Be thou thy brothers Lord: yet Jacob was feign to crouch to
Esau, he was his Lord: but this was accomplished in CHRIST, that should come
of Jacob. All Nations were subject to him. In this blessing Jacob saw CHRIST,
though it were afar off: therefore no mervaile though it be adscribed to
faith.

The blessing of Parents is highly to be regarded. Praerogativa parentum
disciplina filiorum. Ambr.
Though there be a difference between our blessing of our Children and of the
Patriarchs: Our benedictio is but bona dictio, or bona precatio: theirs was an
actual and a real bestowing of things on them: yet the curse or blessing of
Parents in all ages is to be respected: whom they curse justly, God curses,
and whom they bless God blesses.

Therefore let Children so behave themselves, that they may have their Parents
blessing, especially at their departure out of the world.

These temporal blessings are blessings. Wealth, health, honor, prosperity:
these GOD bestows on the reprobate: these had Ismael and Esau: he was a
jolly hunter, and abounded in pleasure, he flourished in worldly prosperity
more than Jacob. So may the wicked do, Psalm. 73.4. Dives -- But let us be
content rather to lie with Lazarus then to frye with Dives: to be plain and
simple men, as Jacob was, then to have their felicity here, and misery
hereafter, 2 Samuel 19.30.

Faith sees things to come. Isaac now was blind, yet he saw things to come.

The eye of faith is the best eye. Let us entreat the Lord to make the eye of
our faith brighter and brighter to our dying day.

VERSE 21.
TOuching Jacob there be two facts to be considered: which are illustrated by
the isntrumental cause, and the circumstance of time, when they were performed.

The facts are the blessing of Joseph's two Sons, and his worshipping of GOD
described by the manner, how: the isntrumental cause, faith: the time when,
when he was a dying.

By faith: for without the eye of faith he could not see the things that
should happen to his Childrens Children, contained in the blessing.

Which was more than the blessing of his own Sons, all fathers will do
that: when he was about to dye, when death did approach.

1. He adopted them into his family, that they might be members of the Church:
as well as his own Sons.

2. He preferred the younger before the elder. Ephraim is put for the ten
tribes, Hos. 5. they were both Children: Ephraim had no more in him then
Manasseh.

3. Being a stranger in Egypt he gave them portions in the land of Canaan, as
if he had been present at the distribution of it, Genesis 48.22. Shechem a
portion: or the name of a City called Sichem, which fell to the tribe of
Ephraim, Ios. 13. The seventie translate it, (...), that select and famous
Sichem.

Iishtaku Gnal Rosh Hammittah: an open jarre: the latter being a staff to
beat the former out of doors.

How agrees this with the Hebrew? it is one and the same word, with a little
alteration: the diversity may arise on the affinity of the vowels: Mittah a
bed? Matteh, a rod: and both may be true. He worshipped upon the beds head,
and he worshipped on the top of his staff too. Inclining upon his pillow
toward the bed head, being weak and aged, he held his staff in his hand too,
and leaning on it he worshipped God.

He did worship toward the bed head; because being bed-red he could no other,
than lie on his pillow. Upon, which way soever it stood, on the beds head, or
on the top of his staff, both may stand together.

2. This was before the other, Genesis 47. ult. the blessing, Genesis 48. It is very
like he leaned often on his staff, and worshipped God: not only after Joseph's
promise, but also when he had blessed all his Sons, when he plucked up his
feet into the bed, he might lean on his staff and worship. Or it may be an
(...), which is frequent in the Bible.

Worshipped] He praised God for this and all other his mercies: he prayed for
their speedy deliverance out of Egypt, that they might be planted in the
promised land.

(...): because he blessed them with a singular blessing; Ephraim with one,
Manasseh with another: Super utrumque proprium benedictionem fudit, posuit
minorem ante majorem. Haymo.

(...) for (...), or (...).

As the Apostle leaves the Hebrew, and follows the seventie: So the Papists
may leave the Hebrew and the Greek, and follow the vulgar translation.

1. That is not of as great authority as the Seventy.

2. When the Seventie differ in sense from the Hebrew, the Apostles follow it
not.

The Jesuits: he worshipped the end of his staff, that is, the top of Joseph's
Scepter, reverencing the authority he had in Egypt: So that was fulfilled, the
Sun, the Moon, eleven Stars did obeisance to Joseph. Hyperius adds: that
in Joseph a type of Christ, he worshipped Christ.

1. Joseph was most loved of them all. 2. He was stripped of his Coat. 3. Sold
into Egypt. 4. Cast into Prison. 5. Advanced to great honor. So was CHRIST.
1. Joseph being but Viceroy had no Scepter, Genesis 41.40.

2. He should rather have reverenced his Sons authority at his first
coming, then at his last departure out of the world.

3. Rather publicly, than in a private house.

4. That had been no great testimony of faith: for even unbeleevers honor the
Magistracy.

5. The preposition (...) will not admit that interpretation: he worshipped
upon the top of his rod, not the top of his rod.

6. This makes nothing for religious worshipping of Images, or God, at or
before the crucifix and Images.

The occasion of blessing them was ministered by Joseph's bringing of them to
him, Genesis 48. ver. 1. he having intelligence of his Fathers sickness
repaires presently to him with his two Sons, that they might be partakers of
their Grandfathers blessing: they were borne of the daughter of Potipherah
Prince of On, a woman that was a stranger from the commonwealth of Israel, and
not in the Calendar of GODS people: they had been nourished in Egypt, where
the worship of the true God was in a manner abolished. Therefore he is
desirous, that Jacob a famous Patriarch, a man deep in GODS books, might
bless them ere he dyed: for his blessing was GODS blessing. Joseph being
ruler of the land of Egypt, no doubt had purchased great lands and Lord-ships
for them: he was like to leave them money enough, that they should want no
earthly blessing; yet because all these were not worth a straw without the
blessing of God, he is most careful to procure this to them, which they were
to receive from the mouth and hands of Jacob. Fathers are careful enough to
provide outward things for their Children, to lay up bags of Gold and Silver
for them, to leave them houses and lands, Sheep and Oxen and such like: but as
for GODS blessing, that is the least thing they take thought for. This is to
build without a foundation: for the blessing of God is all in all. Therefore
above all things, procure that to your Children.

Why does not the Holy Ghost rather say, by faith he blessed his own Sons?

1. Because this is greater. By the eye of faith he did not only foresee,
what should happen to his own Children: but also to the Children of his Child.

2. They being his own immediate seed, were engraffed into Israel already.
There might be some question of Joseph's Sons, because they were the seed of a
strange woman: therefore it is said, that Jacob by faith blessed them, and by
virtue of this blessing inserted them into the stock of Israel.

2. Here we learn, that honor and preferments come neither from the East, nor
from the West, but from GOD. He sets up one, and pulls down another. Ephraim
was the younger, yet here in Jacobs blessing, as it were by Gods own hand, he
is advanced above Manasseh.

Joseph himself was one of the youngest of all his brethren, hated of them,
cast into a pit, sold to the Madianites, thrown into prison, where he lay
till the iron entered into his soul: who would have thought that this abject,
this poor prisoner should be ruler of all Egypt? yet so it came to pass.
Saul seeking his Fathers Asses lighted on a kingdom, which he never sought
for. David was taken from following the sheep great with young, and made ruler
of Israel. Hester a poor banished maid, fatherless and motherlesse became a
Queen: this is the Lords doing, and it ought to be mervailous in our eyes. It
has a double use.

1. It must pull down the Peacocks feathers of all them that be mounted aloft,
not to be proud of those high places whereunto they are exalted. It was not
chance and fortune, that set them in the throne of dignity, it was not simply
their own wit and wisdom, their great variety of learning, their policy
and forecast, pains and diligence, the favor of their friends that promoted
them, but the good will and pleasure of GOD Almighty. What have thou, be
thou never so great, which thou have not received? Therefore swell not in pride
in respect of the gift, but thank the giver of it.

2. This must repress the envy of inferiors. Is another man aloft, and art
thou beneath? digitus Dei est. Is thy younger brother in a more worshipful and
honorable place then thou, as Ephraim got the start of Manasseh? is one that
is thy junior, thy inferior, lifted up in wealth, honor, and dignity above
thee? grudge not at it: it is Gods doing; be contented with it.

3. Here we have a pattern in old father Jacob, how to behave our selves at
the time of death: when we see and hear death knocking at our doors, then
especially we must be occupied in heavenly duties; we must not be cursing, but
blessing, as Jacob was: then above all other times we must be worshipping of
God, praying to him, praising and magnifying him for his mercies, as Jacob was,
upon our beds, and upon our staves. Though we be weak and impotent, we must
be glorifying of God: when Hezekiah received that message, set thine house in
order, for thou must dye; then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed
earnestly to the Lord. Luke 24.51.
When our Savior was going out of the world, he was blessing his Disciples:
and here Jacob is blessing and praising to his dying day: so must we be. We
must not then be swearing, cursing, and banning, quaffing and swilling as many
be, like the Epicures; let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall dye.
Then we must be preparing of our selves for a better life, where we shall
remain for ever. The nearer the time approaches, that a tenant must go out of
his farm, the more careful he will be to improve it to his best commodity:
the lesser time that a man is to enjoy money lent to him, the greater advantage
he will make of it, if he can; even so when we perceive we must depart out of
the farm of this world, let us use it most to Gods glory: and seeing God has
lent us our life, as a sum of money to be paid to him praestituto die; the
nearer the day of payment comes, the more conscionably and diligently let us be
in the use of it, to the honor of God and our own profit. When the steward in
the Gospel saw that he was to go out of his office, he makes the best of it,
he can: so let us do of our life, when we are to part with it. They that be
actours in a Comedy or Tragedy, will have a special eye to the last act, that
they may have a joyful plaudite of the people.

So this life being as a stage whereon we play our part, let us chiefly look
to the last act at our departure out of the world, that it may be joyful to
our selves and all those that be round about us: our whole life should be a
continual glorifying of GOD, but especially the closing up of our life with
death, that we may leave a testimony behind us of that lively faith, which we
have in the Lord Jesus. Let us be praying, meditating, blessing, talking of
heavenly matters, to the last gasp.

VERSE 22.
IN Joseph there be two things. 1. A memorandum given to the Israelites.

2. A Charge for the removing of his bones: which were both lively
demonstrations of his faith.

He presaged his death, Genesis 50.24. either by the nature or quality of his
disease, or by divine revelation.

(...), drawing to his end.

Memoriae prodit, brought to memory.

Out of Egypt; often promised by God, which he had received from his fathers:
he makes a certain prediction of it.

He bound them with an oath, Genesis 50.25.

Not so much for fear of Idolatry, lest the Egyptians should worship him,
when he was dead, as Chrysostom. in Genesin. and August. de mirabilibus Sacrae
Script. l. 1. c. 15. they had opportunity to do it, before his bones were
removed: but to confirm the faith he had in the promises of God: he was so
sure that they should have the land of Canaan, as that he would have his bones
carried away beforehand.

2. Because the land of Canaan was a type of heaven, he would be there buried.

3. Because in life and in death he would be with the godly.

Rhemists: the translation of relics or Saints bodies, and the due regard and
honor we ought to have to the same, are proved hereby.

Bell. l. 2. de reliquiis Sanct. c. 3. upon this example concludes: non ergo
superstitiosum neque novum est transfer ossa Sanctorum.

1. The Israelites were bound by oath to translate his bones: not so they.

2. They kept not those bones to show to the people, or to carry them about on
festival days: but they buried them, Ios. 24.32.

3. Those were translated into the land of Canaan, because it was a type of
heaven: So is no special Country now. Therefore that is no president.

Joseph a great man, the ruler of Egypt; yet dies: death overrules us all.
The rich man dyed, as well as poor Lazarus. It is appointed to all, once to
dye.

He rubbed their memories, put them in remembrance of their departure out of
Egypt: whereupon the book of Exodus has his name, containing the departure
of the Children of Israel. You are well seated here in the land of Egypt, you
are planted in Goshen the fattest of the land: It is like for my sake ye shall
find favor for a time, yet set not up your staff here, but remember ye must
depart hence, the land of Canaan is your Country, promised to Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob: let your minds run on that land. As for this world, it is a kind of
Egypt flowing with all pleasures and profits: yet let us know, that this is no
place of abode for us; we must depart from hence. The time of my departure is
now at hand, says St. Paul, 2 Timothy 4.6. Luke 9.31. If he had need of such a
Memorandum, much more we: for this end Philip had his Usher, who daily said to
him: memento Philippe, te esse mortalem. The Israelites were too much wedded in
their affections to Egypt; they desired to be again with their Onyons, and
such like fare, as they had in Egypt. We are all too much in love with this
wretched world: it likes us as well as the Mount did St. Peter. Many wish, that
they might make Tabernacles here for ever: yet let us all know that this is no
abiding place, we must all depart: eximus e vita, tanquam e theatro: Farmers
from their farms; Gentlemen, Knights, Lords from their beautiful houses; yea
Kings must depart out of their Palaces. A voice came from heaven to
Nebuchadnezar; Oh King, thy kingdom is departed from thee. Let us seriously
think of this departure of ours. When a Travellour comes to his Inn, he
looks about him and says; here is a fair Inn; here I have a brave Chamber,
and I have plenty of all things for my money; yet this is not my home, I must
not tarry here, I must depart: even so, though we have the world at will, and
all things as heart can wish, beautiful houses, large lands, ample
possessions; yet here is no place to abide in, we must depart, leave all, go
away with a Coffin and a winding sheet.

Let us use this world as if we used it not: let our hearts be on a better
world, that in the end we may depart in peace, with Simeon, and reign with
CHRIST for ever in the world to come.

Joseph had been a brave Courtyer, trained up and bearing sway in Pharaohs
Court many years together, abounding in all wealth, honor, pleasure and
prosperity: yet all this while he forgets not God: he lived well, and dyed
well: he is heavenly minded at his departure out of the world: he is not now
talking of his honors, as Haman was the day before he dyed, not talking of the
injuries which his Mistress offered to him in casting him into prison, and
taking order for the revenge of it: he is not now conferring with his brethren
about the solemnizing of his funeral, with what pomp they should carry him to
the grave: but now he is talking of matters belonging to the kingdom of
heaven. Though we live in never so profane a place, as irreligious as Egypt,
as full of carnal entisements as Pharaohs Court; yet let us keep our
integrity, as Joseph did: let not the pleasures of the earth pull us from the
joys of heaven. Obadiah kept his zeal and sincerity in Achabs Court, Daniel
in Nebuchadnezars Palace, Nehemiah in the Kings buttery, and at his table: and
there were rare and excellent Christians in Neroes house: most of all, they of
Caesar's household, they were more mindful of the poor Saints of Philippi
then others. Let us not condemn them that be in heathenish and irreligious
places. GOD can preserve his pearls even in dunghills, his roses among
thorns: he will have a Rahab in Jericho, a Lot in Sodom, a Joseph in Egypt:
wheresoever we be, let us keep our selves unpolluted of the world.

2. Here we are taught, what must be the object of our talk, of what matters
we must be talking, when death approaches: not of worldly matters, but of
heavenly, as Joseph was. Elias was talking with Elisha about profitable
matters, 2 Reg. ^.
when he was taken from him into heaven: as they were walking and talking, the
fiery Chariot took him away. Our Savior was talking with his Disciples about
matters belonging to the kingdom of GOD, till the cloud took him away: and
Joseph here dying is speaking not of those things appertaining to the earthly
Court, but to the Court of heaven. Navita de ventis, de tauris narrat arator:
every man for the most part, both in his life time, and in the time of death is
speaking of those things which he most minds: the things that be most in the
heart, are most in the tongue. A covetous miser is talking of his gold and
silver, houses and lands, of the trash of the world, even when he lies on his
death bed. A drunkard will then be talking of drink, an adulterer of fair
and beautiful women: but a godly man will be talking of Gods matters, as
Joseph was.

It is very like that Joseph ere this time had made his will, and set his
outward estate at a stay: therefore that does not trouble him now: his mind
runs about better matters: it is not good to defer the making of our wills,
till we see no other way but death: the last thing we talk of should be
celestial, not terrestrial things.

3. We must not be too scrupulous about the place of our buryall.

Now no land is a type of heaven, as the land of Canaan was before the coming
of CHRIST. Out of any Country on the earth, yea out of the bottom of the Sea,
out of the Lions mouths, out of the fire, wherein we are burnt to ashes for
the name of Christ, we shall have a comfortable passage into the kingdom of
heaven: yea, our buryall with the wicked shall not prejudice our entrance into
heaven. Saint Peter sitting at the same table with Judas when he was alive, was
not hurt by him, much less should he have been hindered out of heaven, if he
had lien in the same grave with Judas.

Though we be buried among Thieves, Traitors, Idolaters, Drunkards,
Murderers, Adulterers, etc. If our lives have been good, that cannot keep us
out of heaven. Yet if conveniently it may be, superstition being avoided, as we
lived with the godly, so let us be buried with them: as we were companions with
them in their life, so let us be in death, if it seem good to the providence
of God. Ruth says to Naomi, where thou art buried, I will be buried: and
Joseph would have his bones to lie with the bones of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
So we shall give notice to the world how dear the Saints were to us, when
they were alive. Yet let not the place of our buryall trouble us at our dying
day (as some take too much thought for that:) wheresoever we be buried, God
will send his Angels at the latter day to gather our bodies from all the ends
of the world, and to carry them up into heaven.

He gave no commandment touching his flesh: he knew that would be consumed
before. Then why should we pamper this flesh so much, that is so soon brought
to dust and ashes? caro mea inimica mea: onus meum, laqueus meus: paramus escam
vermibus. Let us subdue our bodies, D. Tailor.
lest like horses they overthrow their Riders. His bones were durable:
therefore he gives a charge of them.

If he had not looked for the Resurrection of those bones, he would not have
been so careful for the translating of them into the land of Canaan, Psalm.
34.20. Ezekiel. 37.1. The bones of a dead man are scattered hither and thither,
tumbled out of one grave into another: yet these shall rise, and come to their
place again. Bucers bones were burnt in Queen Mary's days, yet the same
bones shall rise again, and be a witness against the enemies of the truth.
Not our bones alone, but our flesh, every part and member of our bodies shall
be restored to us again: with these my eyes shall I see him: the very palms
of Iezebels hands that were eaten up with dogs shall rise again. Let us not
sing the Epicures song, let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall dye: Let
us not give our selves wholly to pampering of our flesh, and the fatting of our
bones: but let us employ all our members to GODS service in this life, that we
may be partakers in soul and body of his eternal glory in the life to come.

VERSE 23.
BEfore of the Patriarcks: now of the Lawgiver. Where we have, 1. The
commendation of his Parents faith. 2. The commendation of his own faith.


The faith of his Parents is commended by a worthy act of theirs, the
preservation of their Child: which is amplified,

1. By an attractive cause, that drew them to it, the beauty of the Child.

2. By a retractive or disswasive cause, that might have withdrawn them from
it. 1. The Kings commandment, which in an heroical magnanimity they feared
not.

Moses, Exodus 2.10.

(...) is put for (...), Catachrestice: he uses this word, because his mother
only is mentioned, Exodus 2.2. she did it with the consent of her husband.

Not (...): because his Grandfather was alive then, and had an hand in the
business: their names we have, Exodus 6.20. Amram, and Iochabed.

Brought up in the City: who go not much abroad to be scorched of the Sun,
Act. 7.20. divinitus venustus: by the disposition of God. Nineveh a City
Gedolah laelohim, 2 Cor. 10.4.

But are they so highly to be extolled for that? is it a work of faith to
respect beauty? A natural man might have done that.

His beauty was one motive, but not all: faith was the greatest: He was by the
gift of God of extraordinary beauty. In the which by faith they saw an express
Image of God, that he was like to prove some rare and notable instrument:
Hyperius affirms, that as Simeon, Luke 2. by the revelation of the spirit
knew CHRIST to be the Messiah: so his Parents by his beauty, that he should be
the deliverer of the people: but there is no certainty of that: they did not
stick in the outward baauty: that was as Gods hand to lead them to higher
matters: they did it not in a natural affection. Others loved their Children,
and had fair Children: Simiae suum pulchrum: but by faith.

Decree, or ordinance. The King ordained on pain of death. The King had given
a straight charge, that the Male Children should be drowned, but they looked to
the King of Kings, that was able to preserve them from his fury.

Though it were the hazard, not of their goods alone, but lives too, they
looked to Gods promises: that they should multiply, that out of Israel should
come a deliverer, and the Messiah too: therefore they will not drown their
Male-child.

They did not so fear it, as that it should hold them from the preservation of
their Child.

Three months:] not three days, or three weeks: yet at three months end
they commit him to the water: then their faith began to stagger.

Some think they did it in faith too, being assured that God would deliver
him, Exodus 2.4. If he had been in danger, they would have taken him home
again.

They were the first, and all that we read of, that kept their Children
against the Kings decree.

That they hid him three months was commendable. All that while they were in
fear, and hazarded their lives: but that at the three months end they expose
their Child to the wide world, that argues a weakness in them: yet this weak
action, this weak faith of theirs is registered, to their commendation, God
allows and commends a weak faith: he does not quench the smoking flax,
nor bruise the broken reed: he chides Peter for his weak faith, o thou of
little faith! but he does not cast him away for it.

Though a Child be weak, yet the Father loves it: so does our heavenly Father
us, though he find weaknesses in our best actions. There was a weakness in
the Mid-Wives, when they preserved the Children with a lie: there was a
weakness in Abraham, when he thought he could not be safe unless he
dissembled: there was weakness in the Parents of Moses, in thrusting their
Child at length out of doors: there is weakness in our praying, hearing of
Sermons, in our giving to the poor, and maintenance of the word preached, in
our preserving of our Children in dangers and calamities: yet if these things
be done in sincerity, though there be weaknesses in them, they are accepted
at the hands of God in Christ. Let that encourage us in all good actions,
though they be stained with some imbecillities.

2. Beauty is a precious pearl, a picture of the heavenly Appelles, a singular
ornament, wherewith God has graced his Children. Joseph was a fair person and
well favored, Genesis 39.6. David, 1 Samuel 16.12. Daniel and his fellows. The
base fare they had could not impair their beauty. This the LORD in wisdom
has used for the preservation and advancement of his Children. Moses beauty
was a lodestone to draw the favor of Pharaohs daughter to him. It was as a
stirrope for Hester to mount up to a Kingdom: yet for all that, let us not
dote too much upon external beauty.

1. Though some of GODS Children have it, yet all have it not: it is not
proprium quarto modo. Ebedmeleck, the blacke-more was no fair man: neither be
they all the Children of GOD that have it. Absalom was a beautiful man, not a
blemish in his whole body, yet a wicked man, who by all probability never set a
foot into the kingdom of heaven: and many a filthy strumpet is fayrer than an
honest woman.

2. It is a transitory gift: here to day, gone to morrow: beauty is a goodly
flower, yet there be many worms to consume it: sickness, grief, old age,
etc. Let us chiefly desire that beauty that lasts for ever.

3. Let us consider, there is a double beauty; the one outward, the other
inward: the one proper to Gods elect, the other common to the reprobate
together with them. The Kings daughter is glorious within, Psalm. 45.13.

It is the inward beauty of the heart, that is acceptable to God. Let us all
pray to God for that, to bestow it on us: that is better then the beauty of all
Ladies in the world: this is the true beauty, Prove. 31.30.

3. It is spoken comparatively, not simply: they did not so fear the Kings
commandment, that they should banish the commandment of the King of Kings,
out of their mind. The King said, drown the child: God said, save the child
from drowning.

What, are not Kings to be feared? have I not said, ye are Gods? a King is a
certain God on the earth: therefore to be feared and reverenced: he carries
not the sword in vain, says the Apostle. Balaams Ass feared, when he saw the
Angels sword: and shall not we fear that glittering sword of authority in the
hand of Kings and Princes? they are rather to be condemned, then commended for
not fearing the Kings Commandment.

The answer is easy. We must distinguish between the authority, and the
commandment of a King. There is no power, but it is of God: but there may be a
commandment which is not of God. Fear the power, the throne, the dignity, the
authority of a King, the office of a King; but fear not every commandment of
a King; if we be sure they are against plain Scripture. In doubtful things,
we must believe that our Governors are wiser than our selves.

VERSE 24.
BEfore, we have spoken of his Parents faith: now let us speak of his own
faith. In Moses there are three notable things, which are as shrill trumpets to
sound forth his faith, 1. A voluntary cross undertaken by him. 24.25, 26. 2. A
necessary cross imposed on him. 27. 3. An institution of a perpetual
Sacrament among the Jews. 28.

In the voluntary Cross, 1. A fact committed by him. 2. The causes of it,
which are three; election, 25. judgment, 26. faith.

The fact was a refusal of honor, and so consequently an embracing

The honor refused by him was the title and appellation of Pharaohs daughters
Son: the time when he refused it, was, when he was of mature age.

Being great] not in credit and estimation; (though that be true, for Moses
was in great repute with all) but in years: that is the native signification
of the Hebrew word.

Act. 7.23.
Gadal] and Saint Stephen being a good commenter expounds it, when he was
full forty years of age.

This the Holy Ghost mentions, least this his refusal should be adscribed
temeritati or imprudentiae. Young men want knowledge and experience: often
times they do they cannot tell what: if they had had more years on their
backs, they would have been wiser: and many times they do that rashly upon
weakness and impotency of affection, which they repent them of afterward: many
a young man in a proud conceit of himself refuses a living, which he would
gladly have afterward, and cannot. Moses did not so make this refusal. He
was great in years, of a ripe and mature age, wise, circumspect, considerate
enough; yet he refused, etc.

He denied: disclaimed that title: horruit, aversatus est, (...), as Chrysostom.
expounds it. Whether he did deny it in words is not expressed in Scripture:
peradventure he did. The Egyptians saluted him gladly by that name: here comes
our young Prince, the Kings daughters Son, he disclaimed and said, I am not
the Son of Pharaohs daughter, Exodus 6.20.
I am such a woman's Son, which is an Hebrew, I am an Israelite, I am no
Egyptian. I had rather be accounted the Son of a mean woman of the
Israelites, then the Son of the greatest Lady in Pharaohs Court.

If he did it not in words, at the least in deeds: he is declared by his deeds,
Exodus 2.11.
in the visiting the Israelites, in taking their part, in revenging their
wrongs, to be an Israelite, not an Egyptian.

Pharaohs daughter had done much for him: she saved him from drowning, she
paid for the nursing of him, she brought him up at her own proper cost and
charges, she put him to School, trained him up in all the learning of the
Egyptians, she adopted him to be her Son, and now does he think scorn to be
called her Son?

No doubt but he was thankful to her for all the kindnesses she had showed
him, and behaved himself reverently and dutifully to her: honor thy father
and mother. She had been as a mother to him, and out of all question he
honored her: yet he would not honor her above God: he was appointed by God
to be the deliverer of the Israelites out of Egypt. Israel was the Church of
God, to them the promises were made; the Egyptians were a profane company,
strangers from the covenants: therefore though he might have gained a kingdom
by it, he would not be in their Calendar, he professed plainly he was an
Israelite, one of Gods chosen people, he was none of Pharaohs daughters Son:
he was the Son of GOD by faith in the promised Messiah. Hester concealed her
people, when she stood on a kingdom: yet Moses for a kingdom will not
conceal his: the time was now come, when he was to open himself to the world,
what he was: he set not a straw by that magnificent title, in comparison of
the affinity and consanguinity he had with Gods people.

Together with this title, he refused all the appendices that belonged to it:
the crown of Egypt; all the honors, riches, profits and pleasures, that were
appertaining to the Crown. A strange and admirable refusal! being with
Pharaohs daughter he might live in all ease, rest and quietness, none durst
give him a foul word, much less offer him any wrong in deed. He flourished in
the pomp and honor of the world, all the Court reverenced him, capped and
bowed to him: by reason hereof he was in some probability of the Crown
hereafter, for Josephus writes, she had no natural Sons of her own, but
intended to make him her heir: yet this regal title with all the golden
appurtenances he refuses. Quis nisi mentis inops oblatum respuit aurum? much
more, quis respuit oblatum regnum? men will do any thing for a kingdom: yet
he desires to be counted one of Gods people, how meanly soever he lived in the
world. An admirable faith!

This he did, not when he was under age, in his minority, but when he was of
full age and capable of a kingdom, if it had descended to him. Josephus
records, that when he was a Child, Pharaohs daughter glorying exceedingly in
his beauty and towardlines, presented him to the King her Father, who to please
his daughter withal, set the Crown on Moses head, the which he suffering to
slip off and fall on the ground, stamped it under his feet, which the
South-sayers of Egypt presaged to be ominous to the kingdom. That he did
when he was a boy, if it be true: but now being a man of complete age, he
contemns, as it were, the crown of Egypt, he sets not a straw by it, because
God had called him to another kingdom.

It is not a thing unlawful to appertain to the Court of earthly Princes, or
to be reputed in the number of their Sons. When David was urged by Saul's
servants to take Michal, the Kings daughter; he said to them, seems it to you
a light thing to be a Kings Son in Law? but he did not say, do ye not know
that it is an ungodly thing to be a Kings Son in Law? Jonathan was Saul's
Son, Solomon David's, Hezekiah the Son of Achaz, Josiah of Ammon. CHRIST
said, no man can serve God and Mammon: but he never said, no man can serve God
and Caesar, or all ye that will be saved come out of Kings Courts and
Palaces. Sundry of the dear Children of God have been advanced to great
honor and dignity in them. Joseph was Ruler of all the land of Egypt. David
was Lord Keeper to Achish King of the Philistims. Nehemiah was butler to
Artaxerxes. Daniel was the second man in the kingdom of Babylon. Hester was
Wife to Ahasuerus a ruler of one hundred twenty seven provinces: and Moses
himself, who now refused to be called the Son of Pharaohs daughter, was
afterward Son to Iethro Prince of Midian.

Riches are excellent things, honor and promotion is a glorious thing. God
oftentimes bestows them as tokens of love on his Children: he made Abraham
rich: and he gave David a name like the name of the great men on the earth: but
if either GOD or they must be forsaken, away with all the riches, all the
kingdoms of the world. The Devil offered Christ all the kingdoms of the
earth: but he would none of them. When the Virgin Mary took more on her, then
became her, Christ said to her; woman, what have I to do with thee? so if
honor or promotion, riches or pleasure draw us from God, let us shake them
off, as St. Paul did the Viper, and say, what have I to do with you? my God
must be dearer to me, then you all. Because the kingdom of Egypt and Gods
glory could not stand together, Moses refused a kingdom: then let us be
content to forsake a Lord-ship, a small quantity of ground, a simple house, a
little silver and gold for the Lord: whatsoever we have, be it more or less,
let us count all as dongue for Christ's sake.

In the time of prosperity let us weane our selves from the pleasures and
commodities of this life, that in the time of trial and persecution we may
not be glewed to them, as the young man to his riches, but may be willing to
forsake all for Christ's sake: and so much the rather, because we know not how
nigh trial is, how soon the wind of affliction may rise, and make a
difference between them that love Christ and his Gospel sincerely, and
between them that love this present world, as Demas did. If we have but a
little house and land, one hundred or two hundred, and should be loath to
leave it for CHRIST'S sake: how would we leave a kingdom for him, as Moses
did? It must be Gods work, not our own.

Therefore it is said, that Moses did it by faith, he did it not by any
natural strength or power, by virtue of education, though he had famous
Schoolemasters, and was trained up in all the learning of the Egyptians: he
did it not by the advice of any witty or politic Achitophel: he did it by
faith. Faith in the promised Messiah moved him to it. As Abraham saw the day
of Christ, and was glad: so Moses saw Christ and the kingdom of heaven by the
eye of faith: this made him not to set a rush by the kingdom of Egypt. I
shall be heir of a far more glorious kingdom, then a straw for Egypt. The
kingdom of Egypt lasts but a while, death one day will remove me from it: but
I shall have a kingdom that cannot be shaken, that endures for ever and ever.
Therefore let Egypt go. If we have a true and lively faith in the promises
of God, a sight of the joys reserved for the faithful in the life to come, it
will withdraw our minds off from these earthly things. A worldly man can never
do it, he will say, it is good sleeping in an whole skin; a bird in the hand
is better than two in the bush; I know, what I have here, I cannot tell what I
shall have afterward: but faith is an evidence of things that are not seen.
This caused the Martyrs in Queen Mary's days, some to leave their
Bishoprics, as Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley: some their lands and great revenewes,
as the Duchess of Suffolk, some their liberty, some their Country for the
Gospel: and if we have a true and lively faith indeed, it will make us to
leave all for a good cause: therefore let us make this prayer, Lord increase
our faith: let it be so strong, as that neither riches, honor, nor any thing
else may separate us from thee.

When? not when he was a Child, for then it might have been deemed to be want
of wit and discretion, as Children refuse gold, and take Apples: but when he
was great, of a good and convenient stature, about forty years of age: when
he knew well enough what he did: he did it not puerili temeritate, sed judicio
virili, when he was in the prime and flower of his years. Young men about
forty are most fit for honor and promotion. This may be an admonition to
young men to consecrate their best years to the Lord. Wherewithal shall a
young man cleanse his ways? I write to you young men, says St. John. Timothy
was exercised in the Scriptures from his Childhood. We read of a young man in
the Gospel, that said he had kept all the Commandments from his youth: he was
no swearer, blasphemer, rayler, fighter, quarreller, stealer, cutter,
whoremonger: but our young men cannot abide to hear of godliness; tell them
of forsaking of pleasures, and honor as Moses did, they cannot abide to hear
on that ear. As the Devil said to Christ, why come thou to torment me
before the time?

So this is a torment to them. When they be old they will think of Religion;
in the mean season they will be swash-bucklers, as Lamech; haters, as Esau;
Ruffians, with Absalom; they will follow their lusts, with Amnon. It seems a
paradoxe, for a young man to be a Martyr, to leave the Court, the honors and
pleasures of this world, as Moses did.

VERSE 25.
WHy did he refuse to be called the Son of Pharaohs daughter? did she refuse
him, or was he in hope of a better kingdom in the world? no verily: it was put
to his own choice, he was not compelled to it: neither the King nor his
daughter gave him over, but he gave them over.

How did he choose it? not half against his will; but rather, he had rather a
great deal have this than that.

Which is amplified by the thing elected and rejected.

What did he choose? to suffer adversity rather than to reign in glory.

Electio ex duobus ad minimum: here two things were propounded to Moses choice,
pleasure and pain: the one is welcome to all by nature, the other abhorred of
all by nature: yet Moses chooses pain, and refuses pleasure.

To Hercules appeared virtu^ and voluptas: the one horrid, promising labor and
sorrow, yet he chose it. A travellour sees two ways, the one fair, that
leads him quite another way: the other foul, that carries him to his
journeys end: he chooses rather the foul way, because it is most commodious
for him. Pharaohs Court was a fine and delicate way; the afflictions of the
Israelites a foul way: yet because that lead to hell, this to heaven, Moses
rather chose it: this was not the work of nature, but of faith.

He chose to be afflicted, to be evilly entreated, malis premi. As if a man
should refuse honey, and take worme-wood: before, he lived in honor and
dignity, now he chose to live in contempt and disgrace: before, he was at a
table every day furnished with all delicates; now he comes to his leekes and
onyons with the Israelites: before, he was in all jollity, now in all
affliction.

The affliction is illustrated by the companions, with whom he was afflicted:
and they were the people of God.

Affliction simply is not to be chosen: but affliction with the people of GOD,
that is the sugar that sweetens afflictions. To be afflicted with thieves for
theft, with Traitors for treason, with Idolaters for Idolatry, has no comfort
in it: but to be afflicted with Gods people, is full of comfort, for Gods
cause: he had rather be afflicted with Gods people, then to live with the
Egyptian Courtyers in Pharaohs Court, which were none of the people of God.

Then to have the temporary fruition of sin. But the word importing such a
fruition, as is joined with delight and pleasure, the English, may be well
retained. (...) is put for (...), and (...) for deditus voluptati. The Papists
following the vulgar translate it, then to have the fruition of a temporal
sin: and Ribera is a greater patron of the Latin, then of the Greek: he
says, the Greek might be (...): and so the vulgar has done well: but
Cajetan is more ingenious, saying, that temporarii, is put for temporarium.

Of ease and quietness, safety and security, delicate fare, honor and dignity
in Pharaohs Court.

These he might have there enjoyed, yet he rejected them all.

VERSE 27.
THese pleasures are amplified by two adjuncts: they be temporary, and sinful:
though he had enjoyed them, he could have had no long lease of them, he must
one day have forgone them all.

2. They were sinful pleasures. Some say, so called, because without sin he
could not have disclaimed his own people: rather, because they are the
occasions of sin, the instruments of sin, and can hardly be enjoyed without
sin. In it self it is no sin to be in the Court of Princes, but through
our corruption it sometime becomes sin. Or in a particular manner, they had
been sin to him, if for them he had disclaimed the people of God.

David had an hard choice, that might justly put him to a stand: 2 Samuel 24.13.
a man would think that Moses had an easy choice, whether he would live in
prosperity or in adversity: this required no great deliberation. Who would not
rather embrace prosperity? yet he rather chose adversity.

A Physician says to a sick man, here is a box of Iuncats, and a box of
Pills: the Iuncats will overlay thy stomach, the Pills will purge thee and make
thee whole: he rather chooses the Pills then the Iuncates: so the pleasures in
Pharaohs Court would have overcharged Moses soul; adversity with Gods people
would be a means for the saving of his soul: therefore he rather chose that.
Let us not be too much bewitched with prosperity: it may be as a cradle to
rock us asleep in sin: adversity may be as a Charret, which though it jogge
us and make us sick for the time, yet at length it will carry us to heaven.

Therefore if it be the will and pleasure of GOD, let us rather choose that, as
Moses did: it is better to have Lazarus his pains, and to go to heaven, then
all Dives his pleasures, and go to hell.

Pleasures are Sirens, that deceive us all: we are all too greedy of pleasure:
yet here be two sour sawces, that may make us loath the sweetmeate of pleasure.

1. For the most part they be sinful: the pitch and tar of sin cleaves to
these earthly pleasures. Riches seem pleasant things to us, yet they be
thorns to prick us, and snares to entangle us: meat and drink, Corn and
Wine are pleasant things; yet they often breed surfeiting and drunkenness:
Silver and Gold are pleasant things; it does a man good to look on them; yet
they are as thieves to steal away our hearts from God, and as plummets of lead
to drown us in perdition, if we look not well about us. Hardly can we use
these pleasures, but we shall defile our selves with sin, and banish our selves
out of the kingdom of heaven: therefore let us be wise and circumspect in the
use of them.

2. We can enjoy them but a season. Have thou fair houses, large lands, ample
possessions? Can thou dispend one thousand, three thousand per annum? thou
can hold them but a season, peradventure this night thy soul shall be taken
from thee, and then whose shall all these be? Art thou a wealthy Merchant, a
rich Clothyer, a Gentleman, Knight, Lord? thou can enjoy thy place but a
season: it may be Seventie years: and what is that to eternity? who would be
a King for an hour, and a miserable beggar all the days of his life after?
and who would live in all jollity here for an hour, and frye in hell world
without end? Therefore let us not be besotted with these transitory pleasures,
but desire the joys that abide for ever.

The reasons that induced him to it are, 1. A reverent estimation of the
miserable estate of Gods Children in this life. 2. An heavenly contemplation of
their happy estate in the life to come.


VERSE 26.
THis choice was built on judgment. Accounting: in his account it was the
greater, being lead to it by the direction of Gods spirit, his judgment being
enlightened, and directed by the Spirit of God.

Not thinking, or supposing, conjecturing, but esteeming. He does not say,
heaven to be greater riches, but the rebuke of Christ.

The Papists translate it, improperium Christi, the nicke name of Christ.

The Hebrews being in a strange Country, in great servitude and bondage were
obnoxious to many opprobrious and contumelious speeches and usages: therefore
he says, the rebuke of Christ: and that is put generally for all afflictions.

But how was that the rebuke of Christ? Christ was not borne then, he could not
then be mocked.

He was agnus occisus ab origin mundi: Christ has been afflicted from the
beginning of the world, as he was after his Ascension into heaven. Saul, Saul,
why persecutest thou me? The afflictions of the Church are called the rebuke of
Christ, the shame and ignomie of Christ: not actively, but passively; that
shame and rebuke whereunto Christ is exposed in this world. When we are rebuked
and persecuted, Christ is persecuted.

When Ishmael mocked Isaac, he mocked Christ: when the Egyptians oppressed
the Israelites, they oppressed Christ: when the body is afflicted, the head is
afflicted; when the Wife is afflicted, the Husband is afflicted. So when we are
sick, hungry, or naked, Christ is. Gal. 6.17. Col. 1.24.

As Abraham saw Christ by the eye of faith: So did Moses, and he esteemed
highly the rebuke of Christ.

What estimation had he of it?

1. He did not esteem it to be poverty, though indeed the Israelites were
very poor, but riches.

Not rich in the positive, but in the comparative degree: not great riches, but
greater than all the riches in Egypt.

Not, then the Sheep and Oxen, but the treasures: nay, than all the treasures
in it: not only then all the treasures in the Court, but in all Egypt: they
had many treasuries, abundance of Gold and Silver, yet in Moses judgment the
rebuke of Christ, was a greater treasure.

Greater, not de praesenti, but de futuro. There is the Son and heir of a
Nobleman, that shall have great lands and possessions: yet in the mean season
he is kept under, he fares hard, he is under a severe Schoolmaster: yet a wise
man will say, I esteem his estate better than the condition of a riotous
person that presently lives in jollity. So Moses knew, howsoever they were
afflicted here, yet the riches of heaven should one day be theirs: therefore
he accounts the rebuke of Christ greater riches, than the Treasures of Egypt,
greater in glory and perpetuity.

The reason is rendered.

He did not look on their present, but future estate, Genesis 15. Verse 1.

They should be greatly rewarded in the life to come: therefore he would be one
of them.

Mockes and taunts, banishment, imprisonment, loss of goods, burning at the
stake for the name of Christ, these are greater riches than all the treasures
in the world, without Christ, and so let them be esteemed of us al: after
these follows heaven, and at the tail of them comes hell: in that respect it
is the greater, 2 Cor. 4.17. for this light affliction, which is but for a
moment, causes unto us an eternal weight of glory.

The council of Trent, Bellar. Stapleton and our English Jesuits in their
annotations on this place do falsely father this assertion on us, that we
teach it to be unlawful been operari intuitu mercedis: whereas we hold no
such opinion. It is a mere slander of theirs. We confess there is a reward
laid up for the godly, and we may lawfully look up to it: yet in that our
looking two things are to be observed.

1. We must not respect that Solum, nor praecipue: it must neither be the only
thing, nor the chief thing that sets us on work. The principal motives to
good works, must be Gods glory and the love of Christ. GOD has created all
for his own glory: our light must so shine before men, that they seeing our
good works may glorify our Father in heaven. I will abstain from sin,
because it dishonours GOD.

I will adorn the Gospel with good works, because they glorify God.

2. The love of Christ must constrain us thereunto. As he has dyed for my
sins, so I will dye to sin.

3 The consideration of our own duty must press us to it. All that we can
do is a debt, which we owe unto our GOD: Luke 17.10.
therefore we must always be paying our debt to our lives end.

The 4th. is, that rich, and ample reward reserved for us, which is as a bell
to toll us to good works: this we may respect, but it is not the chiefest
thing propounded to us in well doing. The Philosophers could say, that nuda
virtus is to be desired: so God is to be loved and served for himself alone,
without any other by-consideration. They that do good works only for the
reward, are mercenary: as a labourer will not do a days work, unless he
may have a shilling: and they that have no respect to the reward, that regard
it not at all are unthankefull to God, who has prepared a reward for us. Let
us look to the reward, by the which he allures us, as a father does his
Children, to well doing: but let that neither be the sole nor principal mark
we aim at, but the glorifying of our heavenly father, for whose glory we were
created and redeemed.

2. Let us expect a reward for our well doing: yet not upon merit, but upon
promise. Paul being ready to dye looked at the reward: from henceforth there is
laid up for me a Crown of righteousness. 2 Timothy 4.8.
But what Crown? not which he had merited, but which GOD had promised, and
for his promise sake would give to him. This is the surmise of some Papists,
that merces and meritum be relatives: though promissum and merces are
relatives, yet merces and meritum are not. We look for a reward, because God
has promised it: not because we have merited it: for when we have done all
that we can, we are unprofitable servants. Otherwise let us be bold to cast up
our eyes to the reward. Christ himself had respect to the recompense of the
reward, Hebr. 12.2. and we that be Christians may imitate him in that.

Though a child have a poor man to his Father, that is not able to leave him a
Groate, yet he is bound to honor him: but much more, if he be a rich man and
willing to leave him a fair inheritance. Our father is rich, he will reward
us with a kingdom: therefore let us the rather serve and honor him: great is
your reward in heaven: behold I come, and my reward is with me. Here we meet
with many crosses in our minds, bodies, goods, name, in our Wives, Children,
Cattle: here are many occasions of weeping: but let us cheerfully endure them
all: One day we shall be taken up into that place; where all tears shall be
wiped away from our eyes for ever. Let us look to this recompense of reward.

VERSE 27.
THe second notable thing in Moses, is a necessary cross imposed on him: which
is amplified by a corrumpent and a conservant cause of it. The corrumpent was
the fierceness of the King, which he feared not: the conservant was the sight
of God standing by him.

The greatest part of Interpreters expound it of Moses departing out of Aeyypt,
when he carried the people with him: then and in the dispatchall of his
message and office, he feared not the fierceness of the King, but contemned it.

That is true: yet it seems not to be the proper meaning of the place.

1. Then the Apostle should invert the order, which hitherto he has not done,
nor hereafter does in this Chapter, he should set the departure out of Egypt
before the Institution of the Passover.

2. This departure out of Egypt is included, Verse 29. it should be now
unseasonable to speak of it.

3. Then Moses did not forsake Egypt, but he went as a Conqueror out of
Egypt. They that forsake a Country, leave it for some cause; in regard whereof
they cannot safely tarry in the Country. Therefore it is rather to be referred
to the flight of Moses, when after the killing of the Egyptian, he left
Egypt, and fled into the land of Midian. This might seem to have proceeded
from infidelity, yet the power of faith is to be seen in it.

Moses perceiving that now, the King being incensed against him, and the
Israelites as yet not acknowledging him for their deliverer, there was no
convenient time to prosecute his office: therefore he flies for a season,
committing himself to the providence of GOD, and expecting a better
opportunity for the delivering of the Israelites: in the mean season, by faith
he forsakes Egypt for a time.

There is one only thing that opposes itself to this Interpretation.

Here it is said, that he feared not the fierceness of the King, yet Exodus
2.14. it is as clear as the noone day, that he feared it, and fled upon it.

1. The participle may be rendered in the praeterpluperfect-tense, as Verse 31.
by faith Moses forsook Egypt, having not feared the fierceness of the King,
namely, in killing the Egyptian, according to his commission received from
God: not, that he feared it not afterward.

2. Though he feared a little at the first, yet that fear was allayed
afterward: in a courageous magnanimity he forsook Egypt, and feared not the
fierceness of the King in pursuing after him. It may be this fierce Lion will
sent messengers after me to catch me, but the King of Kings is with me, I
fear him not, I will rest under the wings of Gods protection.

Chrysostom. answers, that he did not so fear, as that he should never return
again.

Why? for he endured, with a strong and a valiant mind: nothing could
overthrow him.

As seeing him, that is invisible. God in himself is invisible, and cannot be
seen. Yet Moses by the eye of faith saw him as a Giant on his side; which made
him to contemn Pharaoh and all enemies whatsoever: he saw him in the bush,
Exodus 3. but rather, by the eye of faith.

The Rhemists translate it, him that is invisible: he sustained, as if he had
seen him: how can a man sustain God? they have quite lost the force of the
Greek word; which governes no case, but is absolute of it self.

All flight is not to be condemned. Moses fled out of Egypt, yet it was in
faith. St. Paul fled out of Damascus, yet in faith. Tertullian has an
excellent treatise to this purpose. There is a time to burn, and a time to
fly. If they persecute you in one City, fly to another. If our flight come
from faith, not from fear and infidelity, we may have comfort in it.

It had been (...) for him (...). Chrysostom. cast thy self down, said the
Devil to Christ: so Moses should have cast himself into danger, if he had not
fled.

There be two wings wherewithal we must fly, when we fly out of any
Country, being pursued by our enemies: the wing of faith, and of
righteousness. Whatsoever we do, must be done in faith, else it is sin in
the sight of God: if we stick by it in the time of persecution, it must not be
in presumption, presuming in our own strength, but in faith relying on GOD. If
we fly, it must not be in infidelity, as if GOD were not able to keep us in
security, and being unwilling to suffer any thing for the name of Christ; but
it must be in faith to reserve ourselves for better opportunities, and to fight
more manfully afterward under Christ his banner. By faith Moses forsook
Egypt.

The second wing wherewith we must fly is, the wing of righteousness.

If we fly not sin, as well as the Country, if we carry our sins,
adultery, covetousness, pride, etc. with us in our flight: they will make hue
and cry after us, and pursue us to the terror of our conscience, whithersoever
we go; these things being observed, let us be bold to fly. Christ himself
fled, and he gave his Apostles license to fly.

2 We cannot see the essence of GOD, yet we may see the goodness, mercy, and
power of GOD. The essence of the wind cannot be seen: yet the effects of it
may. When David was hunted by Saul as a Partridge, he saw GOD preserving him
from his claws. The three children saw GOD in the fiery furnace, Daniel in the
Lions den, Jonah in the belly of the Whale, S. Peter in prison. The faithful
in all calamities see GOD: in poverty, in disgrace, exile, sickness, yea, in
death it self, they see the Lord Jesus ready to receive their spirits: and
they have such joy at this spiritual sight of GOD, as that it makes them in a
manner to forget all sorrow. This makes them to endure all crosses, as Moses
did. Let us desire the LORD to sharpen the eye of our faith, that we may see
him which is invisible, to the comfort of our souls in this life, and may see
him face to face in the life to come.

The reason why we faint in calamities, why we give place to the fury of men
is, because we see not GOD on our sides by the eye of faith: for if we did, we
would not fear men. Will the Soldier fear, if he see his Captain with him,
especially if he be a most wise Ulysses, and valiant Ajax, that can protect
him from his enemies? Will a child fear, that has his Father by him which is
able to defend him? If Gehazi had seen the Chariots and Horsemen of fire round
about him and his Master, he would never have delivered that pitiful speech,
alas Master, what shall we do?

VERSE 28.
THE former were proper to Moses. Now follow two other, which are common to the
Israelites together with him: the celebration of the Passover, and their
passage through the red sea.

In the celebration of the Passover: 1. the act: then the causes of it, which
are three; the isntrumental, formal, and final.

Made the Passover: which does signify both to ordain, and to keep and
celebrate, Matthew. 26.18. Moses did not only ordain it at GODS appointment,
but together with the Israelites did keep and celebrate it, as a confirmation
of their faith in the deliverance that was to come.

Here by Passover, of necessity must be understood, the Paschall Lamb, which
was a sign and token to them of the Passover. The Passover was the passing
of the Angel by the house of the Israelites, when he slew the firstborn
among the Egyptians. Moses did neither institute nor celebrate that: but that
was instituted and performed by GOD. They did take and eat the Paschall Lamb,
which was a significant token to them of that Passover: therefore it is no new
thing, by a Sacramental metonymie, to give the signs the name of the thing
signified. This is the LORD's Passover, Exodus 12.11. that is, A sign of the
Lords Passover: this is my covenant, says GOD of Circumcision, Genesis 17.10.
that is, as it is expounded, Verse. 11. A sign of my Covenant: The Rock was
Christ; that is, a type and figure, a lively signification of Christ. Therefore
we are not to seek a knot in these rushes. He shows what this Passover is;
affusion of blood: not (...), but (...): an affusion, namely to the lintell and
door cheeks, with a sponge of hysope. The Lamb was killed, the blood effused
into a Basin, the sponge of hysope dipped in the blood, whereby it was
sprinkled on the door cheeks. This Moses ordained and celebrated, that the
Angel seeing this blood on the doors of the Israelites, might pass by their
houses, and kill none there.

That is, the Angel appointed to it by GOD: yet no Angel is mentioned.

The first borne: both of man and beast among the Egyptians.

Touch them, that is kill them, Genesis 26.11. A (...): not so much as touch them
with his finger, or the top of his sword.

The celebration of this Sacrament by Moses and the Israelites, was a lively
demonstration of their faith. Achaz would have no sign. They did not reject
this sign. To what purpose should blood be sprinkled on our doors? Cannot the
Angel discern the house of an Israelite from the house of an Egyptian without
such a mark? or can a few drops of the blood of a Lamb be as a buckler to us
against the wrath of God? They chopped no such Logic with the Lord, but in faith
submitted themselves to his ordinance: so must we with the hand of faith
embrace the Sacraments of the New Testament. Some Atheist might object against
them: to what end is a little water laid on the forehead of the child? as
Naaman said, Are not Abana and Pharpar, Rivers of Damascus better than all the
waters of Israel? So say they, is not the water in the pomp, as good as the
water in the Font? Wherefore do we receive a little Bread and Wine so
solemnly in the Church, at the celebration of the Lords Supper? May we not
have as good in every Tavern? I but if we have faith, we receive them as
pledges of the body and blood of Christ, with hearty thanksgiving to GOD, yea,
as exhibiting the same.

The blood of the Lamb on the doors of their houses, did assure them of their
deliverance from the plague and judgment of God: that though never so many
were slain among the Egyptians, yet none of their firstborn should lose
their lives: so the water in Baptism, must assure us of the washing away of
our sins in the blood of Christ. The Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper must
assure us of the Body and Blood of Christ: that as we eat and drink the one
with our mouth, so we eat and drink the other with our hearts; in so much, as
CHRIST is one with us, and we with him. Our reverent use of the Sacraments in
the fear of God, is a token of faith: they that contemn the Sacraments, that
regard them not, that care not though they come not at the Communion once in a
year, nay, in five or ten years, they feel no want of it, these declare to
the world that they have no faith. Moses keeping of the Passover was a
Touchstone of his faith: and our usage of the Sacraments will bewray our faith.

The Paschall Lamb was a type of Christ: whereupon he is called our Passover,
1 Cor. 5.7. He was the Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world.
Not a bone of the Paschall Lamb might be broken, Exodus 12.46. So, Not a bone
of Christ could be broken, John 19.36. This Passover was an adumbration of
Christ.

And the Effusion of the blood of the Lamb was a figure of the effusion of the
blood of Christ, Heb. 12.24. As the blood of the Lamb sprinkled on the doors
of the Israelites, kept away the Destroyer from them: So the blood of Christ
sprinkled on our consciences, 1 Pet. 1.2. keeps away the Devil from us. Where
this blood is sprinkled by the sponge of faith, there the Devil can have no
entrance nor possession. This no doubt they likewise saw by the eye of faith:
and let us desire to be sprinkled with this blood more and more.

Whether it were a good or evil Angel, is a question more curious than
commodious: for the most part, Executioners among us are bad men, the scum and
offscouring of the Country, such as have no piety nor religion in them: yet
sometimes a good man may be a Kings executioner, as Benaiah was to Solomon, 1
Reg. 2. Punire malum, non est malum, sed facere malum, malum est.

So it may please the High and Eternal GOD, to use good Angels in the
execution of his wrath. They are as ready to be instruments of his justice, as
of his mercy. It might be a good Angel that slew 70000. with the Pestilence,
in three days space; 2 Samuel 24*
that slew an hundred fourscore and five thousand in Senacheribs Camp in one
night: and it was a good Angel for ought we know, 2 Reg. 19.
that destroyed the firstborn in Egypt: it was an evil Angel that deceived
Achab, it was the Devil that afflicted Job, but it may be a good Angel that
destroyed the firstborn of the Egyptians.

Whether it were or no, it makes no great matter, it does not much concern us.
If we fear God and serve him, we need fear no Angels: they be Traitors, not
loyal Subjects, that fear the Kings Guard. Fear not the rod, but him that
strikes with the rod. The rod cannot smart, nay, it cannot move without the
striker. Let us fear Almighty GOD, that uses creatures as his rods, at his
will and pleasure, and then we shall not need to fear any creature whatsoever.

Whom did the Angel destroy? The firstborn, which of all the children are
dearest to the parents. Men glory most of the first Apple the tree bears: lo
this is the first Apple that my tree bore: So the first fruit of our body is
most joyful and welcome to us. Now the Lord being displeased with the
Egyptians a stubborn and rebellious people, he takes away their firstborn,
and this was the last arrow which he shot against them, Exodus 11.6.
as the deadliest and heaviest of all. If we love our children, let us love
GOD: if we desire to keep them, let us keep in with GOD; he gave, and he can
take away at his pleasure: if we provoke him by our sins, whom we ought to love
most, he will bereave us of that which we love most. If we have one child
deerer to us than another, by one means or other he will deprive us of it: the
best way to keep our children is to serve him who gave us our children.

The Lord will preserve his, though the wicked be destroyed, 2 Pet. 2.9. Psalm.
104.15.
Touch not mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harm. A thousand shall fall
on thy right hand, etc. but it shall not come near thee. No doubt thousands
fell in Egypt being a populous Country, yet the Israelites are not touched. It
cannot be denied, but that sometimes the godly are involved in the same
temporal plague with the ungodly. Good Josiah was slain in the battle:
behold he, whom thou love is sick. A good man may be sick, yea, sick of the
plague, yea, dye of the plague too. Job was a singular good man, yet his seven
sons and three daughters were all touched: the house fell on them altogether,
they were all slain at one stroke. Nevertheless, sometimes it pleases GOD to
make a difference: there was howling and crying among the Egyptians, my son is
dead, but not one dyed among the Israelites. Ezekiel. 9. Apoc. 7.
God sets a mark on his children, that the Destroyer seeing it, may not touch
them. If God for the sins of England should send a destroyer into England:
though there should be an intended massacre of Protestants, by the Devilish
and bloud-sucking Papists, yet if God see it good, he shall not touch any of
his servants. If he do, (for in these outward things we must refer our
selves to God) yet the bloody instruments of death shall prove golden keys, to
open to us the doors of the kingdom of heaven.

VERSE 29.
HEre 1. The miraculous preservation of Gods people. 2.The fearful
destruction of their enemies.

Their preservation is illustrated by the isntrumental cause, the place where,
and the manner how they were preserved.

They: men, women, and children: both Moses and all the Israelites. It is like
that Moses went in first, they followed after, as Josephus writes: he as the
Captain, they as Soldiers conducted by him.

Not by the wit, devise and policy of their own, by the observation of the
course of the Moon, the constellation of stars, or conjuction of planets,
but by faith.

Not they passed over by swimming, by sailing, by taking Ship, etc. but above
art and nature they passed through.

They went not in a little way, but passed through it.

Not a little shallow river, but the great and deep Sea.

Which by the color might also strike a terror into them being red: as the
fire terrifies men by the redness of it. It was a corner of the Sea, that
parts Arabia and Egypt, called red, because the sand there was redder than
in other places.

How? not being somewhat wet, at the least their feet and ancles, but as if
they had bin on the dry and firm land, Exodus 14.22.

This is adscribed to their faith.

At the beginning their faith was weak: they cried out like desperate persons
without hope, Exodus 14.11. but when they heard the promise of the Lord, that he
had said it, when they saw the pillar of a cloud as a token of Gods presence
with them, when they beheld the waters driven back by the rod of Moses, then
committing themselves wholly to the Lord, they enter boldly into the red Sea.
This was a lively manifestation of their faith.

A weak faith at the first, may prove a strong faith at the last, 1 Samuel 27.1.
Peter on the Sea.

There be three especial things that commend their faith in it.

1. That at Gods Word they would believe it: he said they should go through
the Sea, they give credit to it: Has God spoken it? Let us rest quietly in his
word.

2. The waters were on both sides, on the right hand and on the left; they
might be in a continual fear, least they should fall on them and overwhelme
them: yet through faith they go on and fear nothing.

3. The Egyptians followed them into the red Sea, even there they were at
their heels: this might have scared them. Though we be not drowned in the Sea;
yet the Egyptians may cut our throats and kill us in the Sea: but through
faith they likewise overcome that.

This was a supernatural work: if, they had not had faith, they could never
have done it.

Faith is the best weapon to fight withal in all dangers, the best bridge to
pass over any river, yea the Sea it self; a coat of Maile in all battles.

All of them had not faith, no doubt there were some unbelievers among them,
which went over for company and fashion sake, for the saving of their lives,
they would venture with the rest, but they had not a true and sound faith in the
promise of God, 1 Cor. 10.5. yet the fact has the denomination of the better
part. There were many that believed, therefore it is attributed to faith: for
the faithfuls, sake the unfaithful were kept from drowning. The wicked in
temporal blessings fare the better for the godly. Every man must live eternally
by his own faith: but the unfaithful in temporal blessings may fare the
better for the faithful. The LORD blessed Potiphar for Joseph's sake. It is
like some bad ones were in the Ship, some profane Mariners, wherein St. Paul
sailed to Rome: yet they were all preserved for Paul's sake.

So here the unbelieving Israelites were saved from drowning, for the
believers: the world hates the godly, and cannot abide to be in their company;
yet they escape many dangers for their sake. This should cause them to make
more of them than they do.

Through faith the people went over Jordan, the three Children walked in the
midst of the fire, Daniel continued safe in the Lions den, Jonah came out of
the Whales belly. The nature of faith, it leapeth over difficulties and
follows God. Through faith David said, by the power of God I will leap over a
wall. If a man have the Kings passe-port, he may pass all England over: but if
a man have faith, he may pass all the world over, through fire and water,
thick and thin.

Here we see, that all creatures are servants to Gods Children, all work for
them. The Sun stood for Joshua. The Stars fought for the Israelites against
Sisera. Judge. 5.20.
The fire durst not touch the three Children: and here the water of the Sea is
as a wall on both sides of the Israelites, till they be over. If God be with
us, who can be against us? If the Lord of the house be on our side, will not
all the serving men? yea, all creatures shall be on our side.

In the Israelites the Sea forgets her nature: in the Egyptians she exercised
her nature. 1. The cause of their destruction. 2. The destruction it self.

Whereof the Egyptians taking trial: why may not we pass through the Sea, as
well as they? Why should it not give place to us as well as to them?

The Lord had hardened their hearts, and they likewise went into the Sea, Exodus
14.5.

Exo. 14.28.
But what was the issue of it? They were swallowed up by the Sea. The waters
turned back on them, they were all drowned, not one escaped: Joseph.
ut ne nuncius cladis domum reverteretur. When the breath was out of their
bodies, the Sea cast up their carcasses again, and the Israelites saw them on
the shore: whereby they might be the better persuaded they were dead, and
should trouble them no more. Josephus adds, that there fell rai^^ from
heaven, thundering and lightning.

The enemies of the Church may insult over it for a time, as the Egyptians
made the Israelites their slaves, and kept them in cruel bondage: but at the
lenght they shall drink of the Cup of Gods wrath. Iesabel was cast out of a
window and eaten up with Dogs. Herod was eaten up with worms. Sennacherib was
slain by his own Sons. The Egyptians were overwhelmed in the red Sea. Most
of the Persecutors in Q. Maryes days (as Mr Fox reports) came to a wretched
and lamentable end: Some ran mad, some stuncke above the ground, while they
were alive. The rod may be aloft, but it shall be hurled down, and cast into
the fire. Let this be our comfort, we shall one day be conquerors over them all.

The Lord does not only meet with them, but oftentimes in justice he serves
them with the same sauce. Iezabel spilt Naboths blood: in the end her blood was
licked up with Dogs. As Adonibezech had done unto 70. Kings, so God rewarded
him. Iud. 1.7. The Egyptians drowned the Children of Israel; now they are
drowned. Some of the traitors that thought to have blown us up with
gunpowder, were destroyed with gunpowder themselves. Plutarke writes of
Hercules and Theseus, that whom they sacrificed, had sacrificed: whom they
hurled into the Sea, had hurled into the Sea: whom they thrust through with the
Sword, had thrust through with the Sword.

Let them take heed what tortures they put the godly unto, the LORD will repay
them with the like. In this he will be a Pythagorean, he will use jus talionis,
and mete the same measure to them, that they have meted to others.

The same Sea that gave way to the Israelites drowned the Egyptians: the same
fire that had no power over the three Children, slew those men that cast them
into the hot fiery furnace: the same Lions that touched not Daniel, devoured
his enemies: the same Angel that smote the Sodomites, preserved Lot: the same
earth that swallowed up the rebellious route of Core, Dathan and Abiram, bore
those that were loyal and obedient to God. As all work for the best to them
that love Gad: so all things work for the worst to them that hate God.

Here is a strange and wonderful miracle, a glass wherein we may behold the
power and goodness of God. This was the sole finger of God Almighty. Yet there
have been some Atheists that have gone about to extenuate the glory of it:
this was nothing (say they) but the cunning of Moses to delude the world
withal: he being trained up in all the learning of the Egyptians had great
skill in Astronomy, he was well acquainted with the course of the Moon, with
the ebbing and flowing of the Sea: immediately after the tide was gone, he
found a shallow place, where the sand was dry, there he carried the people
over, and makes us believe that they went through the Sea: and the Egyptians
having not that wit, but leaping into the Red Sea were drowned.

This is plainly confuted by the Scripture.

1. Moses did it by faith, not by art or cunning.

2. The waters were not gone away, as they be at an ebb: they were still
remaining, as a wall on both sides of the people.

3. The Egyptians were as skillful Astronomers as Moses, and knew every hole
in the Sea as well as he: therefore there is no probability of this fabulous
devise: it was the Lords doing, and it ought to be mervailous in our eyes: let
us admire it, not carp at it.

4. They passed through the Sea on dry land. Now though the tide be gone, yet
the land is not dry, the sand still is moist: but God by his omnipotent power
divided the waters of the Sea, and made a dry path in the midst for them to
go over, Exodus 14.29. Baij abashah, in arido. The note of similitude is left
out.

5. Moses did this on the sudden: he had no leisure to make choice either of
time or place, but when God had dried up the Sea, then he went into it with
the Israelites. God made a way for them where there was no way. Let us admire
it, not go about to smeere it with the mire of man's invention.

This their passage through the Red Sea was a figure of baptism, 1 Cor. 10.2.
They were baptized unto Moses, that is, to obedience to the doctrine of Moses;
in the Red Sea.

1. The Israelites had no way out of Egypt into the land of Canaan, but by the
red Sea.

They must pass through it into the land of promise. So we ordinarily, (as the
Fathers teach,) have no way to heaven, but by baptism: We must pass through
baptism, into the kingdom of heaven.

2. The waters being as a wall on both sides, they passed through the Sea as
through a deep grave and ditch: so baptism must be the grave and buryall of
sin.

3. They came out of the Sea: So we in baptism must rise out of the grave of
sin.

4. As they in the Sea had the waters on both sides: so we that are baptized
must expect the waves and surges of temptations on all sides.

5. In the Sea the Aegytians were drowned, which were enemies to the
Israelites: so in baptism, sin, Satan, Hell, damnation, all the enemies of
our salvation have their overthrow.

6. By the Sea the Israelites were saved, and by baptism we are saved, as St.
Peter speaks, it is the salvation of Gods elect.

Therefore this passage of the Red Sea is not lightly to be passed over, we
must dwell in the meditation of it: the Lord does often harp upon this string
in the Scriptures, because it does afford us sweet music.

VERSE 30.
HItherto of those at their departure out of Egypt; now to them at their
entrance into the land of Canaan. Before they were settled in it, and after.

Before, we have two examples: the one general of Joshua and the people
together; the other special, of Rahab, a peculiar Citizen.

The faith of Joshua and the Israelites shows forth it self by their
vanquishing and subduing of Jericho: wherein consider, 1. The fall of Jericho.
2. The means whereby it was effected.


Not by any strength or policy of theirs.

It is not like it had many walls. In the Hebrew there is a noune of the
singular number: and here the Apostle uses a Synecdoche. It was environed with
a strong wall, by virtue whereof they thought themselves safe, as in a Castle:
yet the wall fell, it fell down to the ground; not one piece of the wall, but
the whole wall, on every part and side of the City, in so much as it lay all
open, and the Israelites entered in on all sides at their pleasure.

How? what wind blew them down? so many as were prefixed by the Lord.

The manner of the compassing was this. Seven Priests went before the Arc
with seven trumpets of Rams horns: before and after the Arc went the people
armed.

The first six days they compassed the City but once: on the seventh day they
compassed it seven times: at the length the Priests sounded with the trumpets,
at the hearing whereof they gave a great shoute, and then on the sudden the
walls fell down.

The Israelites enter into the City, spoil it, and put them all to the Sword.
This the Apostle adscribeth to faith, and indeed it was wholly the work of
faith.

1 What was the blast of trumpets of Rams horns, to hurl down a City
withal?

2 The compassing of it so many days together might seem childish and
ridiculous: once compassing to man's judgment had been as good.

3 All this while they make no noise, they might not speak a word: Joshua 6.10.
which was an exercise of their faith, especially if there were any women in
their company.

4 Every day they went in danger of their lives, when they went about the walls.
Some might have cast down Milstones upon them, and have brained a great number
of them, as a Woman served Abimelech: or when they were in their procession
about the City, they of Ierico might have made an irruption, and set upon them:
but for so much as GOD had said, within seven days Ierico shall be yours, they
believe the promise of GOD, despising all things, that might oppose themselves
to it: this was an act of faith.

But why does the Holy Ghost insist in this? why does he not rather say, by
faith Joshua made the Sun to stand? that was greater then the fall of Jericho.

Some answer, because in the overthrow of Jericho, Joshua was a type of our
Savior Christ. Jericho has her name of Iareach, the Moon. Now the Moon in
Scripture represents the world. As Joshua made Jericho to fall by trumpets of
Rams horns: So Christ our spiritual Joshua subdued the world by twelve men,
as by twelve trumpets: but that is far fetched, even beyond the Moon.

The Apostle makes choice of this, because Jericho stood in the entrance of
the Land of Canaan: now we may ex ungue leonem. As their first victory came of
faith, so did all the rest: by faith at the length they conquered the whole
Land of Canaan. Here we have many instructions.

1 Faith is the best weapon to go to war withal: not Bills, Bows and Guns,
Swords and Daggers, Muskets, Pistols, Cannons and Demi-Cannons, strong Iron
Engines to undermine and scall walls withal. As Christ said of Mint, Cummin and
Annis, these ought ye to have done, but not to leave the weightier matters of
the Law undone.

So these external weapons are to be provided, but the greatest of all is
faith. All these without faith can do little good: faith without all these can
do much good. By faith Gideon with three thousand men overcame the Midianites:
by faith little David and unarmed too slew great Goliath that was well armed: by
faith Iehosaphat put three Nations to flight, an exceeding great multitude that
came against him: by faith Jonathan and his Armour^bearer discomfited the
Philistims: and by faith the walls of Jericho fell down. 1 Samuel 14.15.
What got us the victory in the year 88. when the invincible Navy of the
Spaniards were on the Sea? Their ships were as mountains to our Molehils, they
in number exceeding us. Surely, it was the faith of diverse, that made us so
gloriously to triumph over them. By faith one shall chase a thousand, and an
hundred put ten thousand to flight. Therefore it were to be wished, that when
we are to fight in battle, choice might be made of honest Soldiers. When a
muster is made, we choose stout and valiant men, expert Soldiers, such as can
handle a Sword or a Gunne well: they be good; but Soldiers endued with faith,
are the best warriers. As the heathen man said, he had rather have one Ulysses,
then ten Aiaces: so it were better for us to have one faithful honest godly
man in a Camp, then ten Soldiers that can quaffe and swill, swear and
swagger, yea though they be lusty men of body. Why was Elias called the
Charets and horsemen of Israel? for his faith and prayers that he made for
Israel: not in regard of any bodily strength. If we will be conquerers over
our enemies, let us pray to God for faith: this will cast down walls, subvert
Cities, overthrow towers, and make us famous conquerers.

2 How mean soever the means be, let us by faith depend on GOD. What were
Rams horns to blow down the walls of Jericho withal? what were pitchers and
three hundred men, to vanquish the Midianites? what was a stone in it self
against a great mighty Giant, Judge. 7.16.
that was armed from top to toe? what was clay and spittle, to open a blind
man's eyes withal? The power of God is seen in weakness. Though the
instruments be weak, He is strong, that works by them. What is Preaching,
if we look on it with a carnal eye, to cast down the holds of sin, to
overthrow Satan, to bring men to the kingdom of Heaven? yea the foolishness
of preaching too, as the Apostle calls it. If our Preachers were flaunting
orators, if their Sermons were such eloquent orations as Demosthenes's and
Tullies, it were something: but shall a rude kind of speaking accompanied with
the power of GODS Spirit, save souls? I verily, because GOD has appointed it,
and it pleases him to work by it. The breath of CHRIST'S mouth overthrowes
Antichrist: and we, though silly weak men, shall overcome immortal Devils:
we shall be more then Conquerers, through Him that loved us.

3 Walls, as ye see, are no strong munitions. An horse, says the Psalmist, is
a vain thing; so an high and mighty wall is a vain thing, unless GOD be the
keeper of the wall. The towns of the Canaanites were walled up to the Heavens:
yet they were made even with the earth. The tower of Siloam fell. Jerusalem, as
Josephus writes, was compassed about with three walls. A threefold thread is
not easily broken: much more a threefold wall. Yet all these three walls were
rased to the ground, the City taken, and the Jews miserably slain. There be
some that make gold their hope, and the wedge of gold their confidence: and
there be some that make walls their hope; but they be weak pillars to lean
upon. There be two walls which we may be bold to trust unto: a good
conscience, and God Almighty: hic murus aheneus esto, nil conscire sibi: They
whose consciences do not prick them for sin, may be bold in the midst of
all dangers, even as bold as Lions, as Solomon speaks, and they that have bad
consciences, shall be afraid of their own shadows.

The other wall is God Almighty. I will be unto thee, says He to Jeremiah, as
a brazen wall against all thine enemies: and the Lord, as it is in Zechary,
will be as a wall of fire round about Jerusalem. Let us not provoke GOD by our
sins, Zach 2.5.
and we shall be safe within paper walls. Let us exasperate him by our
sins, and walls of stone, nay walls of Iron shall not defend us from our
enemies. The proverb is, that hunger breaks through a stone wall: but I am
sure, sin will break through any wall. As the moth eats the garment: So sin
will eat through the strongest wall that is, and call in our enemies after it.
Therefore if we will be secure, in our houses, Towns, Cities and Castles, let
us be at peace with GOD, and serve Him in holiness and righteousness all the
days of our lives.

It is said, that Jericho was compassed about seven days: Now one of those
seven must be the Sabbath; therefore some works might be done on their Sabbath
day, and so on the Lords day now. Here we are to distinguish: some are our own
works, and some Gods works; our own works are the works of our calling, and
the works of our Nature, which are sins; both these must cease on the
Sabbath day; we may not go to plow and Cart on that day, much less may we
kill, steal, commit adultery, be drunken on that day.

But as for GODS works, they may be done on that day: and they are either
extraordinary and immediately commanded by GODS own voice, as this was, the
compassing of Jericho on the seventh day; or mediately and ordinarily
prescribed and set down in the Word, and they be the works of mercy. Christ
healed on the Jews Sabbath day: He defended His Disciples for rubbing the
ears of Corn on that Sabbath day: An Ox or an Ass might be plucked out of a
ditch on the Sabbath day: We may visit the sick, make gatherings for the
poor, we may quench a fire, we may fight with our enemies, if we be urged and
there be necessity: for in all these and the like cases, that rule must take
place, I will have mercy, not sacrifice.

VERSE 31.
THe second example of them before the full possession of the Land of Canaan,
is the harlot Rahab, who by faith was preserved from the common destruction of
the whole City: whose preservation is amplified. 1. By the isntrumental
cause, 2. By the estate of the party preserved, 3. By the goodness of God
extended to her, 4. By the motive of her preservation.

Not by any strength or prwes of her own, for she was a woman, and by force
could not have wrastled out of this danger.

Her faith shines clearly, as in a Crystal glass, Ios. 2.9.

1 By faith she was persuaded that GOD had given them the Land, although as yet
they were not firmly settled in it.

2 She reckons up the wonderful works, which God Almighty had done for them.

3 She shows, how the fear of GOD had fallen upon them all.

4 She acknowledges the supreme power and the authority of their God.

5 She requires no better security and assurance for her delivery, then a
sacred oath in the name of God.

All these are lively demonstrations of her faith.

Though she did speak nothing of the promised Messiah, the true and proper
object of faith: yet it may be, she had some glimmerings of that heavenly
mystery, specially before the spies departed out of her house; they perceiving
good affections in her already might Catechize her further in the principles of
religion: certain it is, that she had faith.

Where first it may be demanded, how she came by faith? Romans 10.14. faith comes
by hearing of the Word: there were no Preachers in Jericho: the trumpet of the
Word Preached did not sound in that City. It pleased God to bring her to faith
by the report of Gods wonderful works, which he had done for his chosen
people. The Preaching of the Word is the ordinary means whereby we come to
faith: but God is not tied to that: he may work faith in men and women by
extraordinary means.

2 In all Countries and Nations, God has His faithful and elect, though they
be not known to the World. In Vz he had Job, in Syria Naaman, in Ethiopia a
worthy Eunuch.

For her former condition of life, she had been an harlot.

Some of the Rabbis supposing it to be a blot of ignominy to their Nation,
that any of them should be reputed harlots, they will have the word to be
derived from another root, of [ Zun] and translate it an Hostess or Inkeeper.
Rahab that Vitler or Inkeeper, but harlot she was none.

But, 1. the most native signification of the word is an harlot: neither is it
otherwise taken, or by probability can be in the Old Testament. Let all the
places be examined where it is used.

2 The 70. translate it (...): so does the Author of this Epistle, and the
Apostle James: now (...) does import nothing, save an Harlot, that sels her
chastity and makes a gain of her body. It does never signify an Inkeeper:
therefore undoubtedly before her conversion she was an Harlot, yea, a famous
and notorious strumpet: Hazzenah. Ios. 6.23.
Here (...), the Harlot, which was publicly known all the City over.

1 Let none take occasion from hence to set light by preaching, where it is.
God can save me without preaching, therefore a fly for it: what need I go to
Church and be such a diligent hearer there? As if a man being at a Table
furnished with all kind of dishes should say, wherefore should I eat? GOD can
preserve me without meat: as if a sick man having learned and expert Physicians
about him, should say, Why should I take Physic? God can restore me to my
health without it: as if a man should say, God can give me light without the
Sun, therefore I will close up my eyes when the Sun shines: or as if a man
being on the top of a Pinnacle as Christ was, should say, wherefore should I
go down by the stayres? though I cast down my self headlong, God can keep
me. If God vouchsafe thee the preaching of the word, beware how thou contemnest
that Ladder. Let us say with the Prophet David, Lord how love I thy Law? It is
deerer to me than thousands of gold and silver.

2 Therefore let none say of any Country, as Nathaneel did of Galilee, Can any
good come out of Turkey, Muscovie, Indie? I surely, God is not the God of the
Jews only, but of Spain, Ireland, England, of France, Italy, etc. Of all
Tribes some were sealed, and of all Nations some shall be saved: They shall
come from the East, West, North, South, into the Kingdom of Heaven.

3. Even among Publicans he had a Zacheus, among persecutors he had a Paul,
an Abraham among idolaters: among them that were possessed of devils, he had a
Mary Magdalen; among the Pharisees, a Nicodemus, among Harlots, he had a Rahab.
Therefore let us peremptorily condemn none. Let us not shoot our fools bolt
rashly with the Barbarians, doubtless this man or this woman is a reprobate,
there is no hope of salvation for such an one: the mercy of God is wonderful!
As the wind blows where it will, so the Spirit breaths where it pleases
him: notorious sinners may be called, when glorious hypocrites shall be
condemned. Whereupon Christ said, that the Publicans and harlots enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven before the conceited Scribes and holy Pharisees, as they
seemed. Many may be written in Gods book, whose names we would scorn to set
down in our books. Let us examine our selves, whether Christ be in us.

4 Though we be egregious sinners, have led a loose life, and defiled our
selves with many sins, yet let us not suffer our selves by the malice of Satan,
to be plunged in the pit of desperation. I have been an Harlot, an Adulterer,
therefore I can have no place in Heaven. Indeed the Scripture says,
Whoremongers and adulterers, God will judge: he will judge them, though they
be his own children, with temporal plagues in this life, for their own
instruction, and the terror of others, as he did David; The child borne in
adultery dyed, all his fasting and crying would not serve the turn: he lay
with Vriahs Wife. GOD stirred up his own Son to lie with his wives. David lay
with Bathshebah in secret. Absalom lay with his wives, in the open sight of all
Israel. Thus God judged him for it. Yet David escaped eternal judgment. There
is no sin, but the sponge of repentance will wipe it away. If they that have
sinned against the Holy Ghost, could repent, they might have been saved. It is
impossible for them to be renewed to repentance; therefore they are damned: but
at what time soever a sinner repents, etc. Let drunkards, thieves,
murderers, harlots, repent, and GOD will receive them into the lap of his
mercy. But what is repentance? not a knock on the breast, a sigh, a sob, a
tear only, but a changing of the mind, a forsaking of sin, and an embracing
of virtue: declinare a malo, and facere bonum, that is repentance. He has not
repented of his drunkenness that is sorry for it to day, and goes to it again
to morrow: he has not repented of his uncleanness, that grieves for it a
time, and returns with the Swine to the wallowing in the mire. Prove. 28.13.
He that forsakes his sin, shall have mercy. Rahab had been an Harlot before
her conversion, but she was none afterward: if she had continued an impure
Harlot still, the Holy Ghost would not have honored her so highly, as to put
her in the Catalogue of them, of whom our Savior descended. 1 Cor. 6.9.11.
Such were some of you, says S. Paul, but ye are washed, etc. I was a
persecutor, I was a blasphemer, says S. Paul, but now I am none. So a good
Christian must say, I was a ruffianly swearer, but now I am none. I use the
Name of God with reverence in all my speeches. I was a Thief secret and open
too, but I thank God I am none now; I would not defraud a man of a penny to my
knowledge, though I might get a world by it; I was a covetous Miser, glued to
my wealth, it went to my heart to part with a penny to any good use; but now I
can honor God willingly with my riches. I was an adulterer, I thought my self
in heaven when I was with Whores and Harlots; but now I think it to be another
hell. Happy are they that have been harlots, and now are none, as Rahab was.

What became of this Harlot? She perished not, neither temporally, nor
eternally, with the rest of Jericho, which are branded with a mark of
disobedience. They would not obey God, they stood out with him at the staves
end, and would not yield themselves to the Israelites, as God had appointed.
Therefore they were all put to the sword. 2 Pet. 2.9. Ezekiel. 9.4.
Rahab in faith obeyed the will of God, submitted her self to him, therefore she
perished not in the common destruction of the City: the Lord knows how to
deliver the righteous, and to reserve the wicked to the day of wrath. The world
was drowned, but Noah was saved; the Sodomites were destroyed, but Lot was
preserved: all Jericho went to the pot, but Rahab perished not with them. Thus
graciously dealt the Lord with his children.

But was Rahab alone preserved? No verily, Ios. 6.23.
but all that were in the house with her: her father, kinsfolk, etc. What, had
they all faith, as well as she, that they perished not? That cannot be
collected out of the Scripture. Rahabs faith is commended; not a word of
theirs, yet they were exempted from the temporal calamity for her sake, The
justmust live eternally by his own faith: yet for outward and external
blessings they may fare the better for the faithfuls sake. Cursed Cham was
saved from drowning for Noah's sake. God blessed the house of the Egyptian, for
Joseph's sake. All that were in the Ship, though some profane Mariners were in
it, were saved for S. Paul's sake. Behold then what a blessed thing it is to be
in the families of good Men and Women. You may escape many fearful calamities
for their sakes. GOD will not only extend his mercy to them, but to all that be
in their household: whereas it is dangerous being with the wicked and
irreligious. S. John would not go into the Bath where Cerinthius was.

But why did they not put her to the sword, as well as others? what induced
them to spare her? Surely their own Promise which they had given her, ratified
with an oath. Joshua had a special care of that, Josh. 6.22.

Which may be a fruitful caveat to us all, to make conscience of our words and
promises. Promise is a debt, and every honest man will have a care to pay his
debts. Though that be counted a ceremony now a days; yet the Israelites
according to promise, took Rahab, set her safe out of the City, before they
slew the rest. Regulus a Heathen man kept his word with his enemies, though it
cost him his life: but we that be Christians, will not keep our words with our
friends.

Especially if our promise be bound with an oath, as theirs was: let not a
world make us to break it. Iuramentum est res sacra. Let not that be violated.
But must all oaths be kept? because Herod swore to give the Damsel
whatsoever she asked, did he well for his oaths sake to give her John Baptists
head? No verily. There be two that may be hindered by our keeping of our oaths,
God, and our selves. If we have sworn, though it be to our own hindrance, let
us keep it: Psalm. 15.4.
but if it be to GODS hinderance, to the dishonor of God, let us not keep
them. Have thou sworn in an anger, never to come at such a Man's house? be
sorry for it. Have thou sworn in a fury to kill a man? grieve for it, and break
that oath. But is it a lawful thing which thou have sworn, tending to GOD's
glory, and the good of thy brethren? Thou art now in an holy bond, the breach
whereof God will revenge. Therefore look to it: let nothing cause thee to
infringe thine oath.

Yet now adays oaths are nothing: men are become mere Atheists: they think
there is no God: they may swear, for swear, abuse his Name at their pleasure;
tush, God sees it not. A monstrous height of impiety, whereunto we are grown!
Words, writings, bonds, oaths are nothing, if there be no law to compel us to
the keeping of them.

Have thou sworn, and that before a Judge, which is a certain god on the
earth, to say the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, So God
save thee by Jesus Christ? discharge that oath with fear and reverence. Have
we in England taken the oath of allegiance, to be true to the Kings Majesty,
his Crown and Dignity, not to conspire with the Pope or any foreign Power,
against the flowrishing State of the Realm? Let us keep this oath, not for
fear, but for conscience sake. An oath is an edge-toole, dally not with it.
GOD was revenged on the house of Saul, because of the oath broken with the
Gibeonites: therefore the Israelites would not break their oath to Rahab: they
did not here pretend the Papists rule, Fides non est servanda cum haeretico.
Rahab is a Cananite, therefore let us not keep our oath with her.

The cause of her preservation was the peaceable entertaining of the Spies:
which was a lively demonstration of her faith: she knew them to be their
enemies, yet she shuts not the doors against them; hence ye villains, ye
come to epsy the weakness of our City, ye shall not set a foot into my
house; but readily and willingly she takes them in: there she hides them from
the cruelty of the King: she conducts them safely away again. This was
specimen fidei: if she had not believed GOD and his promises; she would never
have done it. All this while she hazarded her own life: if her house had been
searched, and the Spies found with her, it had cost her her head, she had been
drawn, hanged, and quartered for a traitor; yet knowing they were Gods people,
and that God had delivered the City into their hands, though it were with
danger of life, they should be her ghests, and she would keep them: this was
actus fidei, it could be no other. My life, said S. Paul, is not dear to me,
so as I may fulfill my course with joy. So said Rahab, My life is not dear to
me, so as I may fulfill the will of God. They that have a true faith indeed,
will venture even their lives in Gods causes.

It is like, as she was an harlot, so she was an Inkeeper too. Peradventure
some sign hung at her door, which made the Spies to take that house: but
undoubtedly, God by the secret finger of his providence directed them to this
Harlots house, for the saving of her body and soul too. When she has once
taken the charge of them, she discharges the duty of a good Inkeeper, no hurt
shall come to her Ghests: yet in some Innes in England many a one have had
their throats cut, even with the consent of the Host and Hostess. Vile beasts,
far unlike to Rahab!

But is this such a worthy act, such a notable work, to be so highly extolled
by the pen of the Holy Ghost? It was stained with two foul blots, with treason
and a lie. 1. Jericho was her native City, the mother in whose lap she had
sitten quietly many years together, and does she now betray it into the hands
of the enemy? now fie upon her Traitor! It is a bad bird that defiles her own
nest: it is an ungracious bird, that destroys her own nest. But the answer is
easy. In this Rahab showed her self faithful to God, rather than unfaithful
to her Country. All the Countries in the world are his. The Devil said, All
these are mine, but he lied: God may truly say of all the Kingdoms of the
Earth, All these are Mine, and I give them to whom I will. Now Rahab knew, that
God had given Jericho to the Israelites. Therefore she joins with God in
introducing them into the Land. Where did God ever say, that he has given
England into the Popes hand? Therefore some of our English Jesuits are most
unnatural and divelish to go about to betray it into his hands. Rahab shall
be rejoicing in heaven, when they without repentance are howling in hell. The
other blot wherewith this fact was stained, was a lie. That is apparent, it
cannot be denied, it cannot be colored: she said, they were gone, and wished
them to pursue after them, when they were on the roof of her house, covered
with the stalks of flax. Origin said, we may used a lie, Tanquam medicamento
and condimento. But this we will not defend, we will seek no cloak for it.
We will not say it was a profitable lie; therefore warantable: for we may not
do ill, that good may come of it. Yet we will distinguish between the fact,
and the blemish of the fact. It may be a good Horse, Job 13.7.
though he stumble now and then: it may be a good garden, though there be some
weeds in it: she may be a fair Woman, though she have a wart, and that in her
face too: so it may be a good work, though it be defiled with the spot of some
weakness and infirmities. This is enough to prove that Rahab was not justified
in the sight of GOD by this work, because some pitch of impiety did cleave
unto it: yet for all that the work was good, and well pleasing to GOD. If God
should accept of none of his childrens works because they be imperfect, he
might worthily reject all. In many things we sin all. Perfect Saints are in
heaven, Heb. 12.23. Imperfect here on earth: yet we do not affirm that the
works of the faithful are Merae Sordes and inquinamenta. Though there is
filthiness in them, yet they be not filthy. There may be a spot of ink, or a
little dirt on the face of a beautiful Absalom, yet he is no foul man: there
is difference between staring and stark mad.

But who were they that perished? They that obeyed not, that would not be
persuaded to yield themselves to GOD: and who were they? look Ios. 6.21. Men
women and children. As for the men and women, there might be some reason,
because they were stubborn and resisted God: but why were the children put to
death? As David cried in the pestilence, I have sinned, but as for these sheep,
what have they done? So it might be said, as for them of the elder sort, it
made no matter for them, but as for the children, those little Lambs, what had
they done? 1. We are not to dispute with God. Iusta judicia Dei, licet occulta.
2. They were the brood of rebellious parents, conceived and borne in sin,
therefore they might justly perish with their parents, Liberi parts parentum:
a young Serpent may be killed, because he may poison, though actually he cannot
poison, as the old does. When a Nobleman is condemned of treason, his wife and
children smart for it: and why may not their children be destroyed that are
Traitors to God, Psalm. 137. ult,
as the Canaanites were?

The faithful say of the Edomites, happy shall they be, that dash her children
against the stones. The children of Daniels accusers were thrown into the
Lions den: the children of the faithful are holy, because they are within
the covenant: and the children of the wicked are unholy, because they be out of
the Covenant. Therefore let us not mervaile, though they drink of the Cup of
GODS wrath together with their parents. But God will be merciful to our
children, because he is our God, and the God of our seed: he will hide them
under the shadow of his wings; if not from temporal plagues (for in that we
must refer our selves to his will) yet at the least from the plague of plagues,
from hell fire, in the life to come.

VERSE 32.
NOw follow those examples that are shut up in a short Epitome and compendium,
1. An enumeration of their persons. 32. 2. A narration of the power and
efficacy of their faith. 1. In actions, verse 33, 34. 2. In passions to 39.
which are amplified by the event, 39, 40.

In the enumeration, 1. A preface prefixed before it. 2. The substance of the
enumeration it self. The preface has two parts; an interrogation, and an
affirmation.

I am entered into so large a field, as that I know not how to get out. I am at
a non^plus, I know not what to say. If should run on still in this vein, I
should run my self out of breath; I should weary both you and me.

Why? I should want time: the time would fail me telling of Gideon etc. The
time allotted to me to write in would be too little, if I should insist
particularly in all the faithful men and women, that are in the history of the
Bible. Wherein the Apostle shows himself a singular Rhetorician. Tempus prius
deficeret, quam oration. I have other weighty matters in hand, Preaching,
Reading, Conferring, comforting of distressed souls. I cannot spend my whole
time in writing: therefore I must needs abrupt my course, and contract them in
a narrow room.

There be three kind of persons in this short enumeration, Judges, Kings, and
Prophets. The Judges are four.

He does not here observe ordinem temporis, but as it seems, dignitatis.
Barac was not so worthy a man as Gideon, nor Iephte as Samson: therefore they
have the latter place, though they were before in time.

There are 2. especial things, that commend the faith of Gideon, the overthrow
of superstition, and the vanquishing of the enemies of Israel.

1 In the night he pulled down the Altar of Baal, and cut down his grove:
whereupon he was called Ierubbaal: and for that, he was like to have been
torn in pieces by the people.

2 By him the Midianites were put to flight, which cruelly oppressed Israel:
they were as grassehoppers in multitude, without number, they were as the sand
on the Sea shore. Judge. 7.12. Yet Gideon with three hundred men, having no
weapons, but Trumpets in one hand, and lamps in an other, overcame them all:
this he could never have done without faith.

In this Gideon there are 2. principal things worthy the observation.

1 He was a man of no great account in the eye of the world, a poor man, by
his own confession. Judge. 6.15. and he was a threshing, when the Angel
appeared to him: yet the Lord made him a thresher of the Midianites, and a
Judge of Israel. 1 Samuel 2.8.
The Lord, raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the beggar from
the dunghill, to set them among Princes, and to make them inherit the seat of
glory. He raised poor Joseph from the Prison, and made him ruler of Egypt:
and he advanced poor Hester to be Queen in Vasti her room. Let not poor
folks be discouraged, but depend upon GOD, which can extol them, if it seem
good to him, even in this world: if not, yet if they believe in Christ, He
will make them heirs of His Kingdom, in the world to come.

2 Though he be here extolled for his faith, yet his faith at the first was
mavelous weak and staggering. GODS bare word will not serve the turn, he
must have three signs for the confirmation of him. Neither were they
sufficient; he must have a certainty of the victory the night before, from the
mouth of the enemies themselves. Thus at the length with much ado, he sets on
them being haled to it: yet this faith of his is not only allowed, but
commended too. Even our weak works, so as they be sincere, are acceptable to
God.

The second is Barac; His faith likewise was not very strong: he would not
enter upon the work without a woman, he would not set a foot out of the
doors without Deborah: therefore the honor of the victory redounded upon
Iael. Judge. 4.8.
Yet in confidence of Gods protection he went forth, encountered with Sisera's
Army, and overthrew it. This was the work of faith. As also that afterward
he took no praise to himself, but adscribed the glory of the victory to God
alone: whereupon a song of thanksgiving to God was made by Him and Deborah.

Samson: Sundry things are remarkable in him.

1 His birth was extraordinary, his mother being barren, and it was foretold by
God; with an Argument, that he should be some rare and singular man. 2. By
Gods special providence, he was an avenger of the Israelites on the
Philistims. 3. His works were wonderful, surpassing the strength of Nature,
and were done by the hand of God Himself. In all of them it is said, the
Spirit of the Lord came on him, then he did this or that. He rent a Lion in
pieces, having nothing in his hand: with the Iaw bone of an Ass he slew a
thousand Philistims: he brake the cords asunder, as if they had been threads:
he carried away the gates and bars of the City Azzah, on his shoulders.
Achilles Hebraeorum. 4. He was a Nazarite, in special manner dedicated to God,
and in many things he was a type of our Savior Christ.

There is one only Sponge which may seem to wipe him out of the Catalogue of
the faithful: he killed his own self: yet even that also proceeded from
faith, as Saint August. well defends it, de civit. dei. lib. 1. cap. 21.
cont. secundam epist. Gaudentii. cap. 23. As Abraham's killing of Isaac was
obedientia, because GOD commanded it: So it had been dementia, if that
Commandment had been wanting. The like may be affirmed of this: Samson had
been a mad man, if he had done it without a warrant from God: but because he
had a commission from God to do it, therefore it was of faith: Spiritus
latenter hoc jusserat. as Aug. speaks.

1 He does it not rashly, but with prayer: that prayer came from faith: and
God heard it. 2. God Himself did strengthen him to that business. Judge. 16.28.
3. He did it in the execution of his calling; he was ordained of God to
avenge Israel on the Philistims. At this time he was a Prisoner, and could not
go abroad to do it: therefore by the instinct and motion of Gods Spirit he
does it within the house: he pulls down the house upon himself, and upon them
all, being willing to lay down his life for the people of GOD: as if a
Soldier for the safety of his Country should dye in the midst of his
enemies. A worthy and valiant man! but this must be no president for us.

Iephte. It may seem strange that he should come into this famous Calender of
most holy and renowned men, which sacrificed his only daughter. The most
ancient Rabbis, the Chalde paraphraste, Josephus, Saint Ambr. Saint August.
Saint Jerome, are of this opinion, and it is generally received of all: be it
that he did so in a blind zeal; yet the Holy Ghost here commends his faith,
not every action that he did.

Nevertheless, it may be collected by probable arguments out of the word of
God, that he did not sacrifice his daughter: which is also the opinion of some
late writers, and by name of Vatablus and Tremellius, besides some Rabbis, and
some Schoolmen.

1 It is not like that a man enlightened with the knowledge of God, and endued
with a lively faith should commit so gross, so unnatural a fact, as nature it
self abhors.

2 The conjunction ( Vau) is not only a copulative, but often times a
disjunctive, with the Hebrews. The thing that first meets me when I come
home, shall be the Lords: or, I will offer it for a burnt offering, that is, if
it be a thing which I may lawfully offer. Judge. 11.31 Vehagnalithihu.

3 His daughter did lament her Virginity alone, after she heard of it: whereas
if she should have been put to death, she would have lamented her life above
that.

4. At her return, it is not said, that her Father sacrificed her, but did to
her according to his vow, Verse 39. which is there expounded, he consecrated
her as a perpetual Virgin to the Lord, that she never knew man.

5. It is said, Verse 40. that the daughters of Israel went year by year, not
to lament her, but as the Hebrew signifies, to talk with the daughter of
Iephte. Therefore she was still alive.

It can hardly be imagined, that so excellent a man, so highly extolled by the
Holy Ghost, should for his vow sake do such an abominable fact: yet for all
that, he is not wholly to be excused. It was rashly done of him to vow the
first thing, that met him, as an holy thing to the Lord. What if a dog which is
a fauning creature, had first met him? he might not have consecrated that to
the Lord.

This Iephte was an Harlots Son, Iud. 11.1.
loathed and disdained of his brethren, thrust out of the house, and compelled
to live as a banished man, yet he has faith. The name of a bastard is
contemptible, and that justly. God has set many brands of infamy upon them:
they might bear no office in Israel for many generations. Deuteronomy. 23.2.
Sometimes God bereaves them of their wits and senses: they sustain many
reproaches in the world: yet for all that they may be in the number of Gods
Elect, and Heirs of his Kingdom in the world to come.

From Judges he proceeds to Kings; where he names but one, yet such a one as
may be instar omnium, a famous and worthy King as ever was. Saul was the first
King of Israel, but David was the best King in Israel, the first godly King, a
man after Gods owns heart: his faith was wonderfully tried by many strong and
fearful temptations without, and within too; before he came to the crown,
and after.

He was hunted up and down by Saul, as a partridge on the mountains: he
could never be quiet for him, he went continually in danger of his life, and
could never get the peace of him. After he came to the Crown, he was molested
by the house of Saul sundry years together: his own son had like to have
justled him out of his kingdom: the pestilence in his time was sore in Israel:
many inward conflicts had he in his soul, as appears by his Psalms: Why art
thou disquieted in me, O my Soul? has God forgotten to be merciful? He
fought with hell and damnation: yet by faith he was a glorious Conqueror over
them all: therefore no marvel though he be in the catalogue of faithful men.

The last that is named is Samuel. He was both a judge and a Prophet: therefore
he is put between them both. Shamang ael, audivit Deus. His mother cried for
him: he was dedicated to God before he was borne; an upright, wise and
religious Judge: 1 Samuel 12.3.
he challenged all the people for the execution of his office: whose Ass have
I taken? to whom have I done wrong? they all gave him their approbation and
cleared him before the Lords anointed. Last of all, in general, he names the
Prophets, Luke 13.28. Elias, Elisha, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the rest: all these
were famous for their faith: nec in caeteris contrarium est videre: which is
wont to be the conclusion of all inductions. Therefore all are justified, and
go to heaven by faith, none flies thither, but by the wing of faith.

All these that be here cited, had their blemishes: never a one of these Roses
but had their Pricks. Gideon besides many Wives, had a Concubine: Iud. 8.31.
he made an Ephod, that was an occasion of Idolatry, and made Israel to sin.
Barac was a faint hearted Soldier. Samson defiled himself with many
strumpets. Iephte was very rash and inconsiderate. David was tainted with two
horrible sins. 1 Samuel 8.3.
Samuel, as it seems, was somewhat negligent in looking to his Children: no
Prophet but had some weakness, being all (as St. James speaks of Elias)
subject to the same infirmities that we are: yet they were faithful men,
greatly honored by God Almighty. There is not the best man or woman on the
face of the earth, but it is an easy matter to spy an hole in their coat.
Show me a Garden without weeds, and a man or woman without imperfections. If
ye will have perfect men, ye must go to heaven for them: there be the spirits
of just and perfect men: there be none to be found on the earth. St. Peter, St.
Paul, Saint Thomas, all the Apostles had their imperfections. Yet some profane
wretches there be like Cham, if they find never so small a slip in a godly man,
as Noah was, they are ready to laugh at it: scatent ipsi vulneribus, obijciunt
illis cicatrices. They themselves are common drunkards, beastly adulterers, the
footesteps of whose unclean life may be traced in every corner: yet if they
hear of never so small a thing in a Noah and a David, that is their table
talk, meat and drink to them: whereas in many things we slip all, and there
is not the best man but treads his shoe awry: we should rather weep, than
rejoice at it.

VERSE 33.
NOw to the efficacy of their faith. 1. Of men, then of women: which is
declared, 1. By their actions; some are general in all, as the three former:
some special, in some.

1. The good things they did by faith, they subdued kingdoms, wrought
righteousness, obtained the promises. 2. The evils they overcame by faith. 1.
From unreasonable creatures, as wild beasts. 2. From insensible, as the
elements. 3. From corruptions in themselves. 4. From reasonable men. 5. From
death it self.

1. Yet not without fighting and wrestling: they met with many Antagonists to
encounter withal: by it Joshua subdued the thirty one kingdoms of the
Canaanites, Ios. 12. ver. 24. by it David subdued the Syrians, Moabites and
Amorites: by it, Gideon the Madianites. If we had faith, we should subdue the
Turk, the Pope and all the enemies of the Gospel: but undoubtedly by faith
we shall subdue the kingdom of Satan, which is stronger than all earthly
kingdoms, 1 Ioh. 5.4.

Not by their martial skill and prowess, by weapons and engines of war, though
they used them too: the principal means to subdue them was faith.

2 There is a civil and moral kind of righteousness, doing no wrong, but
good to all, defending the innocent, punishing the nocent, etc. 1 Samuel 12.3.
and 15.33. 1 Reg. 3.27. Acts 10.35. Mark 10.20. There is also a Christian
righteousness to glorify GOD. Unregenerate men may do the former, as
Aristides, Cato, etc. and Luke 18.4. in them it may be called a moral good
work: but no Christian good work, unless it come from faith.

This is a property of faith, to work righteousness. Righteousness cannot
be separated from faith. A faithful man is always a Righteous man, a true
dealing man. So some as Zacheus had faith, he wrought righteousness: the one
half of his goods he gave to the poor, and restored four fold, where he had
done wrong: but now men make profession of faith, but have no righteousness.
The first table has eaten up the second. Men will not swear, not commit
adultery, in some sort they will keep the Lords day, they will come to Church,
hear Sermons, talk of religion: but come to the duties of the second table,
they make no conscience of them, they will lie, cozen, flatter, dissemble,
oppress the fatherless, deal unkindly and unmercifully with widows, grind
the faces of the poor, wring from their nearest and dearest by hook and
crook: a manifest argument they have no faith. Luke 1.6. for a faithful man
is always a righteous man: and he that loves God, will love his brethren: else
he is a liar, and all his religion is in vain. The very Turks and heathen
that never heard of Christ, are more full of the works of righteousness then
we: There is more upright and merciful dealing among them, then among
Christians: therefore they shall rise up in judgment against us at the latter
day: wherefore let us ad virtue to our faith; that as we are faithful, so we
may be righteous in our dealings.

3 They obtained the promises, that is, some particular promises made to them.
As the Israelites had the possesion of the Land of Canaan promised to them,
Caleb had a special portion in it: Ios. 14.13. David obtained the Kingdom
promised to him. Abraham a Son, when he was an hundred years old: but that
general promise concerning Christ, and eternal happiness in soul and body
in heaven together they obtained not: yet they were feign to wait a long time
for these promises, and endured much in the mean season. There is a Kingdom
promised to us, Luke 12.32. By faith we shall obtain this promise, if we can
be content, by many tribulations, as God has appointed, to enter into it.

4. They stopped the mouths of Lions. Samson, Judge. 14.6. not with his cloak,
but by faith: David, 1 Samuel 17.36. Benaiah. 2 Samuel 23.20. Dan. 6.23. we also by
faith shall stop the mouth of that roaring Lion.

VERSE 34.
THe violence of fire, that is, the force or power. Dan. 3.27. If we have
faith, no creature shall hurt us. The mouths of the Swords. Swords have
mouths: as the mouth devoureth, so does the edge of the Sword. The Sword
devoureth one, as well as another, said David.

The Israelites escaped the swords of the Egyptians, that were at their heels
ready to thrust them through, if the red Sea had not made a passage for them.
David often declined the Spear of Saul, wherewith he was purposed to fasten
him to the wall: Elias escaped the sword of Iesabel, who had threatened to take
away his life: we escaped the swords of the Spaniards in eighty eight. If they
had landed, there had been no mercy with them, they would have put all to the
sword.

For God put valor into them: they were made strong for their weakness, Isa.
38.9. Psalm. 38.3. and 10. Was it not valiantly done of Abraham, with the
servants of his own house to encounter with five Kings? was it not valiantly
done of little David, a young stripling, never acquainted with war, to fight
with that huge Giant Goliath, that had been a man of war from his youth up?
did not our English men fight valiantly with their little ships, against the
huge ships of the Spaniards; ours being but molehils to their mountains? This
valor was of GOD, who taught their fingers, to fight, and hands to war.

Weakness is twofold: in body, and soul: Hezekiah was brought to great
weakness, when lying on his death bed, as he thought, he turned his face to
the wall and wept, taking his leave of the world; yet God made him strong
again. David was weak in soul and faint hearted, when he brake forth into
this lamentable speech, one day shall I perish by the hand of Saul: but God
made him strong again. Let us entreat him to strengthen the weakness of us
all.

When we are sick, what do we? some (which is monstrouse to speak) send to
the Devil for help, to witches, sorcerers, etc. but to speak the fairest,
then their is posting to the physician; pills, potions, all kind of medicines
must be received. That is not amiss; so as they come in the second place, and
we trust not in the Physicians, as Ala did. The Physician we should seek to
in the time of weakness and sickness should be God Almighty: with the eye of
faith we should look up to him. When all earthly Physicians have given us
over, he can set us on our legs again. Faith is the best medicine for the
recovery of health and strength.

Tents. It is a metonymie, put for armies.

As Gideon with his three hundred men vanquished the Midianites. As Jonathan,
David, Asa, Iehosaphat, etc. did their enemies: they were not able to stand
before them.

When there be rumors of wars, mustering, preparing of Horses, etc. Let not
our hearts be troubled; faith is the best weapon: if you have a strong and
valiant faith, one shall chase a thousand, and ten shall put ten thousands to
flight. Let us entreat the Lord to make our faith stronger to our dying day.

As the Psalmist speaks of the Church, Wonderful things are spoken of thee,
thou City of GOD! So wonderful things are recorded of faith. By that men
remove mountains, cast out devils, subdue kingdoms; nothing is too hard for
him that believes. All of us by faith shall subdue the kingdom of Satan,
which is stronger than all earthly kingdoms. By faith we shall tread the
devil under our feet: therefore GOD strengthen the faith of us all.

Before, we had their actions; now follow their Passions. 1. An enumeration of
them. 2. An amplification. The enumeration is first general, then special:
general; some concern, name, body, Verse. 36. life, 37. The special is their
flight. An amplification. 1. By a commendation of the men. 38. 2. By a
commemoration of the events of their faith. 1. Affirmative, 39. Negative, as
the reason, Verse. 40.

VERSE 35.
WOmen received their dead.

1 Reg, 17.18.23. 2 Reg. 4.18.36.

Their passions are of three sorts. 1. the suffering of those things that go
before death, and might provoke us to a defection from God, 35.36.

2 The kinds of death which they suffered. 3. A miserable flying and hiding of
themselves.

The miseries going before death are greater; as racking: lesser; some
appertain to the name, some to the body.

The first going before death, is racking: as many were under Antiochus in the
time of the Maccabees. Timpanum was an Instrument like our Rack, whereunto the
parties were straight tied, the nerves of their hands and feet stretched out:
their bodies also cruelly beaten, even to death; thus was Eleazar tormented, 2
Mac. 6.30.

The which is amplified by their Constancy: not receiving deliverance offered
to them, if they would have transgressed Gods Commandment.

Which is illustrated by the end. Some interpret it, the better Resurrection;
not that worser of the reprobate, that shall rise again, but to everlasting
woe, but that better resurrection of the godly to eternal glory.

Others: A better, that is, a more glorious resurrection, as martyrs, not that
common one of all the faithful, 1 Cor. 15.41.

Yet by the opposition, this is the meaning of it. If they would have denied
God, and broken his Commandments, they might have had a kind of resurrection,
from the sentence of death pronounced against them, and have lived longer in
the world: yet they refused that for a far better resurrection in the world to
come, when they shall rise again with comfort, and enter into GOD's Kingdom:
a better resurrection than they that were raised up by Elias and Elisha: they
rose to a temporal life.

So we by faith shall receive our Fathers and mothers, brethren and sisters,
our sons and daughters alive again: by faith we shall receive our own bodies
again, after the worms have eaten our flesh: with the same eyes in substance
that we now have, shall we see GOD, meet CHRIST JESUS in the air, and be
translated into the kingdom of glory. Unspeakable is the force of faith! the
LORD strengthen the faith of us all.

If Eleazar would but have dissembled that he had eaten Swines flesh, he might
have been delivered. If the three children would have fallen down and
worshipped Nebuchadnezzars golden Image, they might have been delivered: if
Daniel would have prayed to King Darius, he might have been delivered from the
Lions.

Master, favor thy self, said S. Peter to Christ, when he went to Jerusalem
to be crucified: and many Sirens sang this sweet song to the Martyrs, O favor
your selves, do not wilfully cast away your selves, have a care of your
selves, your wives and children. Who would not be intised with this Music?
yet it could not prevail with them.

And why? That they might receive a better resurrection. If for the
preservation of this short life which is but a span long, they had revolted
from Christ and his truth, they should have had a miserable resurrection, they
should have risen with a sting of conscience, with a worm continually gnawing
on them: they choose rather to suffer death, that they might rise with a
cheerful and joyful conscience to eternal life.

All shall rise again, good and bad. Cain shall rise with the same hand
wherewith he slew his brother: Iesabel with the same body that was eaten up by
the Dogs: Rabsekeh with the same tongue, wherewith he railed on the God of
Israel: Judas, with the same lips, wherewith he traitorously betrayed our
Savior Christ: Turnecoats, like Ecebolius, shall rise; but they shall rise
with horror of conscience. The godly that have stuck to Christ, that have
fought valiantly under his banner to the very death, they shall rise with
comfortable consciences, meet Christ joyfully in the air, be translated into
the kingdom of glory, and remain with him forever. Therefore let us all have
an eye to this resurrection.

VERSE 36.
THE lesser belong to the Name, or to the body.

Some did incutere pudorem, some dolorem, some horrorem.

Were tried by mockings, as Elisha, 2 Reg. 2.23. Jeremiah, Cap. 20.7. Psalm.
38.13. etc. They received the trial of mockings, and scourgings: Yet it is not
like they used wyre whips, as some now in other parts do. By bonds and
imprisonments: As Micajah and Jeremiah.

The drunkards made songs of David, Jeremiah, Job. Our Savior was mocked on
the cross. The Scribes, the Pharisees, the Elders, and all the common people
mocked him. The Martyrs were mocked in the Primitive Church. This is a trial
we have daily, even in the peace and light of the Gospel. There be Atheists,
Drunkards, Adulterers, Profane persons, that daily mock the children of God.
This is an horrible sin.

1 Saint Paul calls it persecution, Gal. 4.29. and all mockers are persecutors.
See thou a jesting fellow that is always scoffing at good men? Thou may
well say, there goes a persecutor.

2 The seat of the scornful is the highest step of sin. Psalm. 1.1.

3 God is a special avenger of it: he made Bears come out of a Wood and
devour two and forty little children that mocked Elisha. Then let those men
look to themselves that mock the Prophets of GOD, the Lord will meet with them
one way or other.

4 Mocks touch the good name. A thief is a lesser sinner than a mocker. A good
name is above gold, Prove. 22.1.

Therefore let us all take heed of this vice, which is frequent among us. The
Apostle would not have (...), which is; when as men presuming on their wit,
think to turn a thing whither they will: Ephesians. 5.4.
he would not have this to be named among us, much less to be practiced by
us. Elias scoffed at Baals Priests, in an holy zeal being directed to it by
the Spirit of God.

Such Ironies proceed from an extraordinary motion of Gods spirit: but let us
beware how we scoff at Gods works, how we make our selves merry with his
Word, how we mock his Ministers, and other his servants. It is a vice too rife
among us. Some had rather lose their friend than their jest; nay, some had
rather lose the friendship of God, than their jest. It is a great sin to grieve
any of Gods children: will thou grieve him, says S. Paul, for whom Christ
died? he had rather eat no flesh so long as he lived, than he would offend his
brother: and let not us jest so long as we live, if we cannot do it without
the offense of our brethren. Mockings are trials: woe to the tryers; but
blessed are they that with meekness and patience endure these trials.

And scourgings: which must needs be painful to the body.

By bonds and prisonments: which are uncomfortable to all. Though a Bird want
nothing in a Cage, have bread and water enough; yet she had rather an hundred
times be abroad. Liberty is sweet, bondage sour, though it be accompanied
with some delights and pleasures. But I warrant you their imprisonment was hard
enough, they were fed with the bread of affliction, and the water of
affliction, as Micaiah was: and some (as the Story says) in Queen Mary's
days, were feign to drink their own water instead of drink; they had a
miserable imprisonment: which they notwithstanding endured cheerfully, for the
Lord's sake.

VERSE 37.
THey were stoned: as Zecharias the son of Iehojadah, 2 Chro. 24.21. S. Stephen
and S. Paul were stoned. They were hewne asunder; as Jerome reports, by the
common consent of the Jews, Isaiah was. Origin says, he was sawne in pieces,
with a wooden saw at the commandment of Manasseh, because he affirmed he saw
the Lord of Hosts.

Tempted. This is left out altogether by Chrysostom and Theophylact. Some read
(...), they were burnt, as some were under Antiochus. That might be entertained
with some applause, because here special kinds of deaths are mentioned: yet
alterations are dangerous. The word [ Tempted] may be retained. They were
tempted, with many fair promises, of wealth, ease, honor and preferment, to
forsake their religion, yet they persisted valiantly to death.

Achab and Iesabel put many to the sword: so did Manasseh, that made Jerusalem
swim with blood. Saul did so, 1 Samuel 22.18. eighty five persons he slew at once.

Their flight and banishment. 1. Among Men: then among Beasts, 28.

From one Town to another, being persecuted by the adversary.

Not in silks and velvets, like brave Gentlemen, wheresoever they become.

But in Sheep skins and Goats skins: either for necessity, because they could
get no better; or in policy, because they would not be known and descried by
the enemy.

This their flight was accompanied with many miseries.

Destitute, of things necessary, meat, drink, money, lodging.

Afflicted, in soul and body.

Evilly entreated, many kind of ways.

In the Primitive Church some were stoned, as Saint Stephen: put to the sword,
as S. James, Acts 12.2. Crucified, as it is reported of S. Peter, with his head
downward. Some broyled on hot Grydirons, some cast to wild beasts, some
drowned, some buried even alive, some burnt in the fire to ashes. Men must
prepare themselves for all kinds of death, for the name of Christ: and he,
that in his providence sends them, will in his goodness enable us to bear
them, to his own glory and our endless comfort.

1. A wandering life is very uncomfortable: It is a great benefit to live
quietly at home, without wandering, to sit under our vines and fig trees. Let
us be thankful to God for it.

2. If we must needs wander, let it not be in a foolish humor, to see strange
Countries and new fashions: let it not be in an idle vain, to decline
working, as our rogues and vagabonds wander: but let it be for the keeping of a
good conscience: as in Queen Mary's days some wandered to Franckford, Embden,
etc.

VERSE 38.
WHy did they wander? because they were so bad, that they durst be seen no
where, nor show their heads? no: the world was not worthy of these holy men.
Therefore God did sequester them from the world.

The wicked counted them the dung and offscouring of the earth, not worthy to
breath, or to tread on the ground: but indeed, they were excellent men,
angelical men, of whose company the world was unworthy.

The godly being compared to Christ are unworthy men; unworthy, with John
Baptist, to unloose the latchet of his shoe: but compared with the wicked,
Phil. 2.15. worthy men, too good indeed for the world, how basely so ever they
think of them. The old world was unworthy of Enoch: therefore God took him
away. Sodom was unworthy of Lot; therefore God pulled him out of it. Achab and
Iesabel with the unthankful Israelites, were unworthy of Elias: therefore God
took him into heaven in a fiery Charret. The world was unworthy of these men:
therefore God sent them into Caves and deserts.

The Town wherein we dwell, was unworthy of many religious Townsmen, which
we enjoyed: therefore GOD has taken them away.

We must learn how to esteem of the worthiness of men: not by their beauty,
strength, gay Coats, etc. But we esteem it by their wealth, by the high
places they have in this world: we are like them, Iac. 2. If a man had come
with a gold ring, they said, sit thou here; if he were a poor man, though a
godly man, they set him at their foote-stoole: but we weigh the worth of men
in a wrong balance. These were worthy men, such as the world was not worthy
of, that wandered in wildernesses.

One godly man, though never so poor, is a more worthy man than ten thousand
wicked men, then a world of wicked men, be they never so wealthy and
honorable. Virtuous men are the worthy men: therefore let us make much of them.

In wildernesses, as Elias, 1 Reg 19.4. and dens and caves of the earth, 1 Reg.
18.13. They were safe among beasts that could not be safe among men: the very
beasts were more favorable to them then men. The Ravens fed Elias, the Lions
were kind to Daniel, the dogs to Lazarus, the Whale to Jonah, being as an host
to him, and his belly as an Inn.

Though we should be compelled to walk in wildernesses, let us not be afraid:
he is God of the wildernesses, as well as of Towns and Cities; and he can
keep us there: his rod and his staff comfort us, wheresoever we become.

It is a misery, not any felicity, to be an eremite: it is an affliction, no
set profession. Saint John Baptist was no eremite, as the Papists imagine; it
was an inhabited wilderness, though less populous where he kept.

VERSE 39.
WIth God and men. Their actions and passions are amplified by an event, which
has two parts: the one affirmative, the other negative.

Yet not. They received Christ promised to them by faith: they saw his day by
the eye of faith, and were glad, as Abraham did: they received likewise the
fruit of their faith, that is, the salvation of their souls at their dying
day. This makes nothing for limbus patrum.

But they received not (...), that promise of Christ's real exihibition in the
flesh, because the fullness of time was not yet come.

Neither did they receive the promise of full and complete happiness in soul
and body together: they and we shall be partakers of that at the latter day.

VERSE 40.
A Reason is used, taken from the gracious providence of God.

Who had respect to us, as well as to them. If Christ had been exhibited in
their days, the end of the world had been come: for he came in the last
days, Hebr. 1.1.

Then what should have become of us? but God knowing he had other sheep to
call throughout the wide compass of the whole world, deferred the exhibition
of Christ, for the accomplishing of the just number of his elect, that so both
they in the old Testament, and we in the new might be perfected together, and
one day meet in heaven together with Christ our head, as a perfect man. God
has a care of all his Children, he will not have one to be perfect without
another.

A better thing: not in substance, but in circumstance. We have Christ, and so
have they. God has provided heaven for us, and so he has for them. How then
are we better provided for* Yes, in respect of many circumstances. They saw
Christ afar off; we near hand: they saw Christ to come; we already come:
they saw him in the Paschall Lamb; our Passover is already offered: Col. 2.^7.
they had the shadow; we the body: their Sacraments to confirm their faith in
Christ were many, and those hard and difficult; ours are few and easy: they
had a little light, we a great light: they had Moon light; we the Sun light.
Luke 10.23.
Blessed are the eyes that see, etc. Some of us are ready to say in our hearts,
o that I had been in the days of Abraham, of David, of the Prophets! I but,
we are in more happy days, if we had eyes to see them, and hearts to make use
of them.

Now God having provided better things for us, we should be the better. Those
Children should be more dutiful, for whom their father provides best. Our
heavenly father has provided best for us: therefore let us live more
obediently to him. But we are worse than they. In the last days shall come
perilous times: sin most abounds in these last days; wherein God has been
more bountiful to us, then to them in times past. The grace of God has
abounded; and sin does super abound. What unkind wretches are we? as God in
mercy has provided better for us, so let our lives be better, that we may
be in some measure answerable to the goodness of the Lord.

CHAP. XII.
IN the former Chapter we had a Catalogue of faithful men and women: now
follows the use we are to make of it, they must be as spurs to prick us
forward to the like.

The scope of this Chapter is, that in hope of eternal happiness reserved for
us in the heavens, we should patiently bear the afflictions of this life, and
persevere in the profession of Christianity to the end.

It has two parts.

1. That we our selves should courageously run the race set before us, and
fight manfully under Christ's banner, to Ver. 14.

2. That we should be as trumpets to waken and stir up others thereunto.

In the former, 1. A propounding of the admonition, Ver. 1

2. A pressing and an enforcing of it.

In the propounding of it.

1. The foundation whereupon it is built.

2. The propounding of the admonition.

3. The strengthening of it.

The foundation is double. 1. Ponit currendi incitamentum: which is, the
examples of the faithful in the former Chapter.

2. removet impedimentum, the casting away of all impediments, that hinder them
in the race.

VERSE 1.
WHerefore:) to make use of the examples, which we have had, and not to suffer
them to pass from us without some profit.

We also:) as well as they. Let us draw in the same yoke with them.

Not you, exempting himself, but us, including himself in the number.

Having:) So great a cloud of witnesses set about us.

1. A cloud is above us: so these holy men are above us in faith, patience and
other virtues: yet we must labor to come as near them as we can.

2. A cloud is thick, and has a great deal of rain in it: so these are many,
a world of witnesses, a cloud of witnesses.

3. A cloud is dark: so these were darkened with afflictions, though they gave
light by their virtues.

4. A cloud compasses a Town, City, or Country: so we are compassed about
with these witnesses on every side; wheresoever we turn us, we shall see some
to imitate.

5. And it may be he alludeth to the cloud which was a direction to the
Israelites for their journeys, Exodus 13.21. So these examples must be our
direction.

With so great:) of men and women, before the flood and after, in Egypt and in
the promised land.

Witnesses. 1. Ministers are witnesses, Act. 1.8. 2. Martyrs. 3. All
Christians: these by their sufferings have witnessed that they look for an
eternal rest, so must you do.

Seeing so many have run this race before us, broken the ice for us, that have
witnessed to us the power and efficacy of faith; let us not think much to
follow them: though it be a rugged path; yet it is a beaten path: therefore let
us go in it.

All examples are written for our learning. It is a true speech that Saint
Ambrose has; amplius proficitur exemplo, quam admonitione: he renders three
reasons of it.

1. Non potest putari difficile quod jam factum est, it is a greater motive to
hear that a thing is done, then that it ought to be done.

2. Probatum est: therefore we may safely do it. This is an approved
medicine, such and such have taken it, and it has done them good: this will
encourage any to receive it.

3. Religiosum est: that has been transmitted to us jure hareditario, from so
many of our godly ancestors; therefore we are to make a profitable use of the
examples of holy men, that have gone before us: 1 Cor. 10.11.
these are for us, as Saint Paul speaks. This cloud of witnesses is for our
imitation.

It would grieve a man to walk in a way alone. I only am left, said Elias. If
we were alone in this race, 1 Reg. 19.10.
we might be loath to run it: but we are not alone, we have a cloud of
witnesses, a great number that have broken the ice before us, and that run with
us at this present day: we are compassed about with one cloud of witnesses in
the Old Testament, with an other in the New. The blessed Virgin Mary, all the
Apostles, and many excellent men and women: with a third cloud of witnesses in
the Primitive Church: Many worthy Martyrs, that have gone through many
tribulations into the kingdom of Heaven: Therefore having so many fellow
runners, let us cheerfully run the race set before us. If we were all alone,
it might be some discomfort: we are not alone, we have great company, and
good company too. If a man have good company to London, though the way be
foul, it will encourage him to go. We have good company to the celestial
Jerusalem, a cloud of witnesses to go with us. Therefore though the way be
somewhat unpleasant to flesh and blood, yet let us take it: though we fare hard
by the way, yet we with all our company shall have good cheer at our
journeyes end, we shall eat of the hidden Mannah, and of the tree of life,
that grows in the midst of the Paradise of God.

The impediments to be removed are two: the one without, the other within. He
does not say, let us lessen it, get company to help us to bear it; but, let
us cast it quite away. (...), Omnem molem, every weight: not some part, but the
whole burden. They that run, will have nothing to trouble them, so near as
they can: they will cast off all, even their very clothes oftentimes, to their
very shirts. So in this our spiritual race, we must be as light as may be:
therefore we must cast away every thing that presses down, etc.

They may be reduced to these three Heads: honor, riches, pleasure.

Daniel ran with honor, Dan. 2.48. David with a kingdom: but if honor hinder
us, if it be a burden, that we cannot travel with it to the heavenly
Jerusalem, away with it.

Moses refused the kingdom of Egypt; CHRIST refused to be made a King, because
it was a clog to him, and would hinder him in his Office. Latimer cast away a
Bishopric.

The second thing that presses down, is riches. In themselves they are not
weights, but wings. Abraham was a rich man, yet ran: yet many times, howsoever
we are desirous to load our selves with them, they press us down, and hinder
us exceedingly in our race. The Young man was so laden with his wealth, that he
could not follow Christ. Can a Bird fly when she is in a snare? can a Man go
when he is fettered? Riches are snares, yea the devils snares, which is a
strong and cunning Fowler: therefore beware how ye are entangled in them. Ye
may have riches: and yet not be had of riches: if they be weights and
encumbrances, Martha thou art cumbred about many things, then away with them:
these Camels hardly go to heaven. It had been better for the Young Man to have
parted with his riches, than with CHRIST. Many a rich Man is so pressed down
with his wealth, with the cares of the world, about Sheep and Oxen, Silver and
Gold, as that he cannot go to Church, he can find no time to pray, to read
Scripture, to occupy himself in heavenly meditations.

How can he run the race that leads to heaven? If thy eye offend thee, cut it
out: much more, if thy riches offend thee, if they clog thee in this race, away
with them: it is better to go a poor man to heaven, than a rich man to hell.
If a man be pressed to death, though it be with gold, what gets he by it? And
if thou be pressed to eternal death, though it be by thy golden riches, what
does it advantage thee? The Mariners, Ion. 1.5. for the saving of their lives,
cast away their goods, and with their own hands hurled them into the sea: and
for the saving of our souls, shall we not cast away our goods? shall we suffer
them to drown us, and that in everlasting perdition? whatsoever presses thee
down, cast it away. If an Executorship, Stewardship, Lordship, multitude of
Farms, press thee down, and make thee to have an ill conscience before God
and Man too, cast it away. But we love our burdens too well: we had rather
lose heaven, than them.

The third thing that presses down is pleasure, Luke 21.34. Surfeiting and
drunkenness are great pressers. We may run with drink and wine, but not with
drunkenness. When a man's belly is full, he is unfit to run in a bodily race,
much more in the spiritual race. Fasting and prayer are good for this race:
fornication and adultery are Heavy burdens to press us down, Hos. 4.11.
they take away the heart: no heart to run, 1 Timothy 5.6. The voluptuous person is
dead while he lives. That man in the Gospel said, I have married a wife,
therefore I cannot come: how much more will an adulterer say, I have gotten a
whore, I must solace my self with her; therefore I cannot come? Let them run
that will, I cannot run the race of Christianity.

Therefore let us cast away every thing that presses down, be it never so
near or dear to us.

2 Reg. 5.18.
This universal particle is worthy to be observed: every thing. Some flatter
themselves in one thing or other. In this the Lord be merciful unto me, as
Naaman said. Herod cast away many things, but his sweet sin of Incest he would
not cast away. A drunkard will cast away any thing, save his drunkenness; in
this, the Lord be merciful unto me, that I may take a cup of Nimis now and
then. A covetous miser will cast away any thing, save his love of money: In
this, the Lord be merciful unto me, that I may keep my purse. I will come to
the Church, but I will give nothing, so near as I can. I but we must cast away
everything that presses down, lest we miss the gold of eternal glory. My
life says S. Paul, is not dear unto me, so as I may fulfill my course with
joy; and shall our pleasures and profits be so dear to us, that they shall
keep us from fulfilling our course? Let us cast every thing away, rather than
perish eternally.

But there is one thing which above all others we must strive to cast away.i.
the sin: this is ready to give us a fall at every turn: it is inclusus hostis.
The Snaile carries his house with him: but we carry our enemy with us. The
Snake of Original sin is in our bosom, wheresoever we become.

That does so easily compass us about. As a pair of Compasses that compass
the whole Circle: so does this the whole man. It compasses about our souls and
bodies, our eyes, ears, hands, feet, and is ready always to molest and stop
us in our race: therefore away with it.

There be two compassers; the one is Satan, he compasses the earth to and fro;
the other is our own corruption, that compasses all men on the earth. We
cannot utterly cast it off so long as we live: we cannot cast off the being of
it, but we may the dominion of it. Though it be in us, let it not reign in
us: though we cannot ejicere, let us dejicere. Gods grace is sufficient for
us, 2 Cor. ^2.
as he said to S. Paul. Let us pray to him for his grace, that by little and
little we may cast it off.

The foundation being laid, he comes to the building it self, and sets the
admonition on it. The race that we must run is illustrated by the efficient
cause, and the manner of our running.

He does not say, run you, and I will sit still; but let us run. All must run.
Ministers and People, Magistrates and Subjects.

We must not go, but run: not creep like Snailes, but run like Roes. Our
life is not compared to a sitting, but to a walking or running: yet we must not
be like foolish runners, that run themselves out of breath at the first. Fair
and softly goes far. We must not come in such a rash and heady zeal, as
that we run quite out of the Church, as some do. Let us run, but wisely and
discreetly.

What race? not that which is set before us by the devil, the race of pride,
envy, hatred, malice, contention: the race of drunkenness, uncleanness, etc.
but the race that is set before us by God, the race of Christianity, cleaving
steadfastly to Christ and his Gospel, 1 Cor. 9.24.

By God Almighty. He has appointed to every one his race; some a longer, some
a shorter. Some have many crosses, some fewer: all have some. Yet, let us all
run this race.

3 How long must we run? not for a while, but to the end. Not run while we be
young men, till our juvenilis ardor be a little over, as many do: but though
we be old Mnasons, we must run still: never cease running, till we cease
breathing. I have finished my course, says S. Paul. We must never leave
running, till our course be finished.

4 How must we run? with patience. This must be the staff, Heb. 10.36. Apoc.
14.12.
that we must walk withal, and the principal leg that we run withal. In
patience possess your souls. The best man that is, shall have one thing or
other to exercise his patience withal. Though David be a King, he shall have a
railing Shimei; we must all make account of malevolent tongues; yea, and
sometimes those that should be Bees, will prove Waspes: they that should have
the best tongues, have the worst. Therefore we have need of patience while we
are a running in this race; our house may be burnt, our goods stolen, our
children may dye, our cattle may be taken from us, we may be attached with a
grievous sickness, driven out of our Country, in danger of our lives; if we
have no other crosses, we may be sure of malevolent tongues: therefore let us
have patience in this our race; and at length we shall be crowned by God
Almighty, and reign with him for ever.

VERSE 2.
THis admonition is pressed by three arguments.

1 From the pattern and president of our Savior Christ, Verse 2.3. 2 From a
defect in their former afflictions, Verse. 4. 3 From the profitable use of
afflictions, wherewith they shall meet in this race. In the pattern of our
Savior Christ. 1. The delivering of it, Verse. 2. Then the applying of it,
Verse. 3.
In Christ we are to consider. 1. What he is. 2. What he did. 3. The reward of
his doing. Quis imitandus: in quo imitandus: quare imitandus.

Looking: exactly, accurately, considerately, as they that cast account, their
eye and mind shall never be off it. So let us look wishly to Jesus Christ;
not as the Whirry-man, that looks one way, and rows another: but let our
heart and feet go with our eyes. Let us look steadfastly to Christ, as Elisha
did, 2 Reg. 8.11.

(...): looking from, that is, from the afflictions we meet with in this race,
to Christ, that has obtained the gold, and tarrieth for us.

Our Savior Christ is here described; 1. by his name. 2. By his benefits.

Of our faith: whereby we lay hold on Christ, and eternal life. If Christ be
both the Author, beginner, (...), Archduke, Leader, and Finisher of our
salvation, what is left to us? just nothing. Therefore the whole praise must be
ascribed to him alone, Ioh. 15.3. Phil. 1.6.

It is not enough to begin a house or a garment, but they must be finished:
neither is it enough for Christians to begin the race that is set before them,
but they must finish their course: in Christianis non quaeruntur initia, sed
finis.

The Ministers must fulfill their ministry, 1 These. 3.10.

Not only all the faithful in the Old Testament have run this race before us,
but Christ Jesus our blessed Savior, whom we must all be content to follow.

First, the motive that set him on work. 2. The acts performed by him.

Some interpret it, instead of the joy which he might have had, if he would;
rather for the joy: having an eye to that joy, setting it before his eyes, as
Hebr. 11.26. Ioh. 17.5.

The thing that he did is amplified by the end or impulsive cause.

So we have joy set before us, Romans 8.18. 2 Cor. 4.17. Act. 5.41. This joy was
the everlasting glory he should have in his own person, and in his body the
Church, which by his sufferings should be assumed into heaven to him.

Endured the Cross. Though it were a cruel death. 1. It was long, he was many
hours a dying on the Cross. 2. It was ignominious, between two Thieves. 3.
It was cursed, Gal. 3.13.

Christ suffered four kinds of ways. 1. Libenter, for the joy. 2. Graviter,
the Cross. 3. Turpiter, shame. 4. Vtiliter, sits at the right hand of the
Throne of God.

And despised the shame. To endure was much: but this was much greater. Shame
goes to the heart of many. Christ despised it: he regarded it not.

The Shame of our Savior was wonderful great: being Lord of all, he took on
him the form of a servant. Is it not a shame for a King to be in a beggars
weed? his supposed Father was a Carpenter, his Mother a poor woman, brought
to bed in a stable, he had not an hole to hide his head in, he was spit on,
blindfolded, buffeted, mocked by Herod and his Soldiers, pitifully whipped.
Lo here is the man! derided in a manner of all, when he hung on the Cross.
Yet Christ counted all this nothing in regard of the joy. Christ will not be
ashamed of us, when he comes in glory with his holy Angels.

What fruit has he by it? what is his reward? he sits at the right hand of
the Throne of God, Hebr. 1.3.8, 1.

If a man have an excellent runner, before him; the sight of him, will make him
to run more courageously: why should not I run on as well as he? Alexander
would run, if he might have Kings to run withal. Therefore here he propounds a
notable example to us.

We may look to the Patriarckes before and after the flood: to Enoch, Noah,
Abraham, Isaac, etc. to David and all the Prophets, to the blessed Virgin Mary
and the Holy Apostles: but especially we must look to Christ: he is exemplar
exemplarium: he ran without sin, all others with sin: he ran and never took
a fall, all the rest fell at one time or another. Therefore let our eye be
chiefly on him. To whom should the servant look, rather than to his Lord and
Master? The Soldier rather than to his Captain? The Wife, rather than to her
Husband? Christ is our Captain, Head and Husband, Hebr. 6.20. Iud. 9.38.
our forerunner into heaven: therefore let us in this race look to him. As
Abimelech said to his followers, as ye see me do, make have and do the
like: so says Christ to us, as ye see me run, so run ye. I have run through
thick and thin, prosperity and adversity, good report and evil, death and
life: so do ye.

How did CHRIST run?

Who was so handled as Christ was? yet for the joy set before him he endured
all, Romans 8.18.
and ran on to the very end. So let us do. Our crosses may be great: but our
joy shall be far greater. The afflictions of this life are not worthy of the
glory which shall be showed to us: they are but a flea biting in respect of the
joys we shall have. 2 Cor. 4.17.
Our light affliction which is but for a moment causes unto us a far more
excellent, and an eternal weight of glory. This is it which bred such courage
and constancy in the holy Martyrs, for the joy that was set before them: they
were sawen in pieces, stoned, racked, put to the sword, broyled alive on hot
Grydyrons. The consideration of this honey did sweeten all their afflictions.
This made Bishop Ridley to say to Latimer, come my brother, though we have an
hard breakefast, yet we shall have a comfortable dinner. So let this joy
hearten us all. A Merchant and Marrinour endures many storms and tempests for
the haven that is set before them: a Soldier endures the heat of the battle
for the spoil: a sick man endures better pills and potions, yea cutting, for
the health set before him: and let us endure all calamities, sickness,
poverty, banishment, imprisonment, death of friends and Children, loss of
goods and of life, for the unspeakeable joy set before us: Such joys, as
neither eye has seen, nor ear heard, neither ever entered into the heart of
man to conceive.

Here our Savior walked from town to town, preaching and working miracles:
he sat weary on the well of Samaria; but now he sits at the right hand of God.
Which is a sign of rest, and of his Majesty. Judges sit, Kings sit.

And we shall one day sit in heaven with him; that where I am, they also may
be, Ioh. 17.24. We shall be in the same palace of heaven with him, though not
at the right hand of God with him. The Noble men and Courtiers are in the
Court, though they be not so near the King, as the Kings Son is: we shall be
with the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, having palms in our hands, and Crowns
on our heads, etc. Christ endured much sorrow, but now he has much glory: so
shall it be with us: ye heard of the patience of Job, and what end the Lord
made. Affliction is sour, but the end is sweet: we have a tragedy in this
world, but we shall have a Comedy in the world to come. Therefore let us run
with patience and joy -- There be two races, the Devils and Gods: as there be
two ways, the broad and narrow: if we run the devils race, in pride,
covetousness, drunkenness, uncleanness, the end of it will be woeful, we
shall be tormented with the Devil and his Angels for ever: but if we run the
race of God, looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; the end
shall be glorious and comfortable. Therefore let us all run this race.

VERSE 3.
NOw follows the applying of the example. Where, 1. What we are to consider in
Christ. 2. To what end: the matter of the consideration, and the end.


The thing to be considered in Christ, is his patient bearing of evil
tongues. Where, 1. His fortitude in bearing. 2. What it was. 3. How great. 4.
Of whom. 5. Against whom.


Consider him: I need not name him, he has been pointed out to you with the
finger already.

He might have called for fire from heaven to consume them: he might have had
many legions of Angels to destroy them: he might have made their tongues to
rot or swell in their heads, while they were a speaking, yet he endured them,
and went away.

Such. Yours is nothing to it, such an unmatchable contradiction, the like is
not to be found in the world again.

Such contradiction: in word and deed too, Luke 2.34. Acts 28.22.

(...). Against himself.

The end: least ye be wearyed, as travellours in their journey. And faint --
and loosed in your minds, as they be whose joints are loosed and so fall down.

Never was there any so ill spoken of, so much spoken against, that so little
deserved it, as our Savior Christ. Such as never was heard of, neither can
enter into the heart of man; no grief is like to my grief, says the Church,
Lam. 1.12. So no contradiction is like to Christ's contradiction.

1. If we respect the opprobrious speeches wherewith they laded him: all that
could be devised: they upbraided him with his Father a Carpenter: by his
brethren and sisters: by his Country, a Galilean, no good thing can come out of
it: never a good bird in that nest. That was one of the least: they cast
aspersions on his life, a bibber of wine, a friend of Publicans and sinners, a
Samaritane; one that had a Devil, a Magitian, that wrought by the Devil, a
coosener, a deceiver, Matthew. 27.63. a seditious man, a perverter of the people,
a rebel, that denied to pay tribute to Caesar, a mad man, Mark. 3.21. a
Sabbath breaker, because he healed on the Sabbath day, a blasphemer, that
entitled himself the Son of God. All that could be imagined, Luke 2.34.

2. If we respect the manner how they reviled him: with mockes, taunts,
nodding of the head, spitting on him. They blindfolded him, they smote him, and
then they said, prophecy o Christ, who it is that smites thee. The manner was
most ignominious.

3. If we respect the generality of the persons, that spoke against him. All of
all degrees did whet their tongues against him. Herod, Pilat, the Pharisees,
the Sadduces, the rulers of the Church, his kinsemen, Ioh. 7.3. The Thieves
that were crucified with him, both at the first, though one repented; the
Soldiers, the skumme of the Country. The whole people cried with one voice,
away with him: no King but Caesar.

4. What was he against whom they threw the dirt of these vile and malignant
speeches? Separate from sinners: in whom the most sharp sighted Eagle of them
all could not find one spot of sin. Which of you can rebuke me of sin?
He did good to the whole Country, healed all diseases for nothing, he
preached the glad tidings of the Gospel; yet thus they rewarded him. He is the
Butt at which they shoot their poysonfull arrows.

Consider him. David is worthy the considering, how patiently did he beat
Shimei? he showed himself more valiant in that, says St. Chrysostom, then
in cutting off Goliahs Head. But that is nothing to this: he bore one Shimei;
Christ bore many Shimeis. David was a sinner; Christ was none: yet he endured
the speaking against of sinners. Let us consider him. Let him be in the minds
and memories of us all: when we are ill spoken of, let us consider Christ.

It was hard to be endured, yet he endured it. Neither was it patience
perforce; he might have curbed them, if he had listed: he might have caused
their tongues to have been eaten up with worms, as Nestorius was.

He might have made them to drop out of their heads: he might have called for
a thunderbolt from heaven to strike them stark dead: he could have made the
earth to have opened her mouth and swallowed them up quick, as he did Core,
that spoke against Moses: yet he would not: he endured all.

We think much to be ill spoken of: and I pray you what are we, in comparison
of Christ? Was the Creator ill spoken of, and shall the Creatures stomach it?
did the Potter endure ill speeches, and shall not the Pots? did he that knew
no sin, and shall not we that are full of sin? did the LORD and Master, and
shall not we the servants? What? are we greater than Christ? my Lord Ioab,
said Vriah, lies abroad in the field, and shall I go to my house? So the Lord
Christ passed the pikes of ill tongues, 2 Samuel 12.
and shall we think to be freed from them?

There be three things, that may comfort us against evil tongues.

1. The consideration of Gods providence in all things. God carries a stroke
in it: It is the Lord, said Eli, let him do what seems him good. It may be
God has bidden him to curse David, said that regal Prophet; that stayed his
hand: their tongues move against us, but it may be God moves us, or suffers it
so to be; either to try us withal, or to humble us for one thing or other.

2 The Testimony of thine own conscience: if that accuse thee, weep: if that
excuse thee, laugh: that which they speak, is either true or false: if in be
true, mourn for it, and amend it; if it be false, rejoice in it, Matthew. 5.11.

3 Christ's example must be never out of mind. An ancient Father professes of
himself, that when he remembered that prayer of Christ's, he could not find in
his heart to be revenged of any. It was as a bridle to restrain him from
revenge: So, as often as we think on these words, consider him, that endured
such speaking against of sinners; let them be a Bull-warke to us against evil
tongues. Did he that was no sinner endure? and shall not we that be sinners
endure ill speeches? There is none that can challenge a privilege from ill
tongues. Kings themselves are feign to swallow up many an ill word.

The persecution of the tongue, Gal. 4.29.
is a grievous persecution to tender hearts, more grievous than that of the
hand. Mocks and taunts go to the heart of men, and discourage many. In all
these let us consider our Savior Christ, that endured such contradiction of
sinners: he had a load of contumelious speeches laid on him; yet he endured
them. Let Christ's enduring make us to endure, and let them not hinder us in the
race of Christianity.

Let us take heed we be not accessory to his persecution. Some there be, that
are never well, but when they be speaking ill of others. Their mouths are like
Mils that cannot grind without foul water. A dangerous Plurisy! it were well
that they were let blood of that vain.

Come, say they, Let us smite Jeremy with the tongue. Let us keep our hands
off, but let us lay on load with our tongues. This they think they may
lawfully do. Our tongues are our own, Psalm. 12.4.
who shall control us? Nay, they be not your own, 1 Cor. 6.19. Of every idle
word ye must give an account: much more of every railing and back-byting word.
The tongue is an unruly evil: but labor to rule it. As we sit at Table, by
the Chimney side, let us not speak ill, but sound forth the praises of GOD, for
CHRIST's coming into the world. S. James sets two brands on him, 1. He is a
Coosener; whom does he deceive? not another, but himself. Iam. 1.26.
2. His religion is vain; he may think highly of himself; yet he is a vain
man.

Some take a liberty to themselves to speak ill of those that be not as they
are, so holy, so religious as they: thou should rather pray for them, than
speak ill of them. Acts 26.29. S. Paul wished that Agryppa, and all that were
then present, were he was: but he did not rail on them; no more must we. If
defects be in any, pray for the supply of them, but speak not ill of them
behind their backs. Let us remember, that in sinning against the brethren, we
sin against Christ: let not one member persecute another: let Ismael do it,
but let not Isaac do it.

Let us all arm our selves against malevolent tongues: let us never dream to
live without ill words. Luke 6.26.
Nay, S. Luke says, Woe be to you, when all men speak well of you. Let us
always remember this Item of the Holy Ghost, Consider him that endured such
speaking against of sinners: that his example may be as Aqua-vitae, to keep us
from fainting.

VERSE 4.
NOw follows the second argument, which is taken from a defect in their former
affliction. We have endured many things already. Heb. 10.32. Why do thou
speak to us of enduring more? I but ye have not come to the last stroke: ye
have lost your goods, but not your lives for Christ and his Gospel as many
have done, and you peradventure may do hereafter. As Christ has shed his
blood for you: so must you be content to do the like for him, if he call you
to it, Matthew. 23.35.

Unto blood; that is, unto death. Such a one seeks my blood; that is, my life:
Bloud-sucker. His blood be on as and our children; that is, let us be
answerable for his death. It is so called, because in a violent death there is
an effusion of blood.

We must never think we have resisted enough, to our dying-day, Phil. 3.13.
Striving against sin. Some interpret it, against the sin of the persequutors,
laboring by threatenings and promises to draw you from Christ.

Rather against sin in yourselves, which is as Cable-rope to pull afflictions
on you. Though God impose them on you, or suffer them to befall you for his
Gospel.

There be Cutters sad Hacksters, desperate Ruffians, that will resist to blood:
they will challenge one another into the field, and it may be, see the
heart-bloud one of another: but this is in the Devils cause, not in Christ's
cause. Let us resist in the defense of Christ and his Gospel, to the blood.
Christ has shed his blood for us, and shall not we shed ours for him? Many of
the Heathen have given their blood for their Country, and shall not we give
it for Christ and the Church, for the confirmation of it in the faith of
Christ? Though we have stood out a long time in Christ's quarrel, resisting the
enemies of the Gospel, yet let us not set down our staff. Let us never think
we have resisted enough, till we have resisted to blood.

Christ gave us our blood: Christ redeemed our blood: Christ has prepared
heaven for us that be flesh and blood: therefore it cannot be spent better than
in his service.

But as for us, we yield our selves Captives to sin: we throw down the
bucklers, and suffer him to over-master us, there is no striving against sin.
We strive one with another; every Town is full or unneighbourly strifes, and
unbrotherly contentions. We strive not against sin. Sin is the greatest enemy
that we have: it will cut the throat of our soul, and banish us out of heaven;
therefore let us strive against it. Leave striving one with another, and let us
all strive against sin. We shall never be Martyrs if we do it not: for they
that will not lay down their sins for Christ, will never lay down their lives
for Christ.

How must we strive against sin?

1 By prayer, 2 Cor. 12.8. For this thing, I be sought the Lord thrice, that it
might depart from me. Let us pray against anger, pride, uncleanness,
covetousness, continually. M^t 4.10.


2 By Scripture. If we be enticed to idolatry, let us fight against it with the
sword of the Spirit, as Christ did, saying, Thou shall worship the Lord thy
God, and him only shall thou serve. If we be provoked to adultery, let us say:
Whoremongers and Adulterers GOD will judge.

3 By the substracting of the nourishment of that sin. Let us strive against
lust and uncleanness, by a sober and temperate life. The very Heathen could
say, Sine cerere and Baccho friget Venus. Eat and drink sparingly, and the
fire of lust will be quenched. Let us strive against drunkenness, by not
coming at Alehouses, by not looking on the Wine, when it smileth in the
glass.

4 By embracing the contrary virtue. Instead of Pride, let us embrace Humility;
instead of Covetousness, Liberality; of Uncleanness, Chastity, etc.

VERSE 5.
THE profitable use of afflictions is grounded on a testimony of sacred
Scripture. Where, 1. An allegation of the testimony, Verse 5.6. 2. An
application of it. In the allegation, 1. The manner how it is alleged. 2. The
matter of the testimony alleged. The Physicians prescript, and the reason of
it, Verse 6.

It seems that it should rather be an Interrogation, which is more forcible
and frequent in the writings of the Apostle. Have ye forgotten? Have ye
suffered such a sweet sentence to slip out of your minds?

Some interpret it, exhortation: but the word consolation is comfortable, and
suitable to the place, as the word children does import.

What consolation? not that which is dumb, but speaks, by the way of a
kind, reasoning and loving disputation.

Not only to them of the Old Testament; but to you also of the New.

And how does it speak? not, as to servants, but as to children.

1 We are ready to forget good things, those that be most joyful and
comfortable to us: our memories are as Iron Chests for bad things, they will
keep them fast enough. We will remember injuries seven years after: we will
remember that which we have heard at a Play and interlude many years together,
and talk of it. If we have read a thing in a wanton and lascivious Book, we
will remember it:

But as for the sacred Scriptures, the pastures of our souls, we quickly
forget them: yea, even those things that serve most for our comfort. Though we
forget spurs, yet me thinks we should not forget comfits; though we forget
those Scriptures that spur us on to goodness, yet we should not forget them
that may comfort us in our calamities. Yet, says he, ye have forgotten the
consolation. Little children will hardly forget sweet things, plums, sugar,
etc. yet we forget the sweetest junkates that be in GOD's Apothecaries shop.
Let us rub our memories and call them to mind, to the everlasting comfort of
us all.

2 The Papists will not be judged by the Scripture, because it is mute and
cannot speak. Iudex est lex loquens. The Scripture cannot speak, therefore
unfit to be a Judge. Yet here ye see the Scripture speaks. So John
5.39.7.42.19.37. and not that alone, but God speaks by it. Heb. 3.7. Luke
1.70. Therefore it may well be Judge of all Controversies.

3 The Scriptures speak generally unto all: not to them alone that were alive
at the first writing and publishing of it, but it speaks to al posterities to
the end of the world, Romans 15.4. Mark 13.37. The Laws appertain to the whole
Nation: so do the Scriptures to the whole Church. Therefore let us not say of
any place in the Old or New Testament, this belongs not to me.

4 It speaks to the wicked, as to servants: they shall quake at it, whether
they will or no: as Foelix trembled at S. Paul's speech: but it speaks to the
godly, as to children: therefore we should reverently attend to the voice of
our Father, etc. speaking in it.

Then comes the testimony it self; which has two branches: an exhortation,
and a reason of it.

In the exhortation, a double counsel is prescribed to us. 1. That we should
not despise GOD's corrections. 2. That we should not be discouraged by them.
He speaks to us, as a Father. Not my servant, but my Son. Despise not:
according to the Hebrew, cast it not away: according to the Greek, set not
light: which is all one. For that which we care not for, we hurl away.

The fatherly chastening: as a father chastises his children.

For he it is that chasteneth us, whatsoever the rod or instrument be, which he
uses. Sometimes he chasteneth us by the Devil, as he did Job: sometimes by
creatures, fire and water, by men of our own mold, yet always the LORD
chasteneth us. The Philistims had killed Eli his two sons, and taken away the
Arc: yet Eli said, it is the Lord: The Sabeans and Chaldeans took away Job's
cattle: yet Job says, the Lord has taken away.

Afflictions come not by chance or fortune, 1 Samuel 6.9. but by the providence
of God. Therefore let us not despise, but accept with meekness Gods
chastenings.

2 We must not faint under the burden of afflictions, imposed on us by GOD.
How ready are we to break forth into passionate and desperate speeches? Never
was any so tormented as I am. If GOD loved me, he would not thus afflict me. Oh
this is greater than I can bear!

We have much Aquavitae to keep us from fainting. 1. The inward comfort of the
Spirit, which in all afflictions cries in our hearts, Abba, Father. 2. The
consolation of Scripture, GODS Apothecary shop, from whence we may have
medicines against all griefs whatsoever. 3. The reco^dation of the mercy of
God, that will not suffer us to be tempted above that which we are able to
bear.

4 The cogitation of that heavenly company that draws in he yoke of
afflictions with us. If we did bear the burden alone, we might faint: but we
have many to bear it with us.

5 The sweet end afflictions. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and what
end the Lord made. Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, causes
unto us an eternal weight of glory; therefore faint not.

VERSE 6.
THE reason is double; 1. These chastisements are a token of GOD's love:
therefore let us not despise them.

2 They are a token of our salvation, which is an effect of the love of GOD: he
receives; that is, into his Kingdom.

May we certainly conclude, that God loves all he chastens? I surely. He may
punish the wicked, as a Judge does Malefactors: but chastises only his
children whom he loves. (...). He punished Pharaoh and the Egyptians, with
frogs, Chrysostom.
lice, and other plagues: but he chastises only those whom he loves. A bad
man may have his house burnt; so may a good man. The one the Lord punishes, the
other he chastens. A bad man may be grievously sick; so may a good man; the one
God punishes, the other he chastens.

How may we discern between punishments and chastisements?

1 The one is inflicted in mercy: the other in fury. Correct me, O Lord, yet
not in thy fury.

2 The one wax worse, they fret and fume, blaspheme, fight against God,
continue still in their sins, and obstinately resist God to the end, as Cain
and others did.

3 The one are crushed by their afflictions; they are as Gods hammers to crush
them in pieces: the other are amended by their afflictions. They say with
David, It is good for me that I have been afflicted. Their afflictions makes
them hurl away their sins; Psalm. 119.71.
drunkenness, pride, covetousness, uncleanness, etc. The one are better, the
other worse after their afflictions. Whom he loves: he whom thou love is
sick, said Martha to our Savior, meaning Lazarus. And scourges: if a rod will
not serve the turn, he takes a whip, Mark 5.29. That woman had a whip. If a
lesser affliction will not draw us to him, and pull us out of our sins, he
sends a greater.

Whom he receives: into his love and favor in this life, and into his
kingdom, in the life to come. Afflictions are as Gods tools, that make us fit
stones for the heavenly Jerusalem.

We have had a text of Scripture out of the Old Testament, which spoke to us
lovingly, as to children. Now S. Paul makes a Commentary of it, inducing us to
a patient suffering of Gods corrections by three forcible arguments. 1 From the
necessity of correction. 2. From the excellency of the person that corrects
us, Verse. 9.10. Set forth by a comparison. 1. What these Fathers be to us. 2.
What they do to us. 3. From the fruit of correction. V. 11. 1. What it is for
the present. 2. What it will be in the time to come.

VERSE 7.
THE necessity of correction is set forth, 1. Affirmatively, then Negatively:
affirmatively, showing what commodity we shall reap, if we receive correction;
negatively, declaring the in commodity of not receiving it, 8.

Not only if ye take it, but endure it, so long as your heavenly Father shall
strike. A child must not limit his Father; so many stripes shall thou give me,
and no more: he must refer himself to the wisdom and discretion of his
Father: so must we endure whatsoever our Heavenly Father shall impose on us:
though it be a sharp and a long chastening, we must endure it. We read of a
woman that had an issue of blood twelve years, and had spent all on the
Physicians. Luke 13.11. John 5.5.
We read of another woman, that was bound by Satan eighteen years: and of
a man diseased in his feet thirty eight years: yet they endured it: so must we
do, though it be hard for flesh and blood. If we have an ague a week, a
month, a quarter, a whole year, we must endure it. If it continue three,
six, ten years, we must endure it. Job lost seven thousand Sheep, three
thousand Camels, five hundred yoke of Oxen, yet he endured it; he was deprived
of seven Sons, and three Daughters at a clap: yet he endured it: his own body
was full of boyles, from the Crown of his head, to the soales of his feet, he
sat scraping himself in ashes, yet he endured it; his wife provoked him to
shorten his pain, to curse GOD and dye, yet he would not, he still endured it.
Thou speak like a foolish woman, etc. He was an Adamant against all
afflictions; so must we be, we must endure all.

There be two reasons to excite us to it, both set down by S. Paul, 1 Cor
10.13. 1. No temptation happens to us, but that which is incident to men. Other
men have endured as much as we. The Patriarchs, the Prophets, the Apostles,
yea, Christ himself. We are not alone: there are many thousands that draw with
us in the yoke. Yea, Christ himself suffers with us. Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me? therefore let us endure it.

2 God is faithful, and will not suffer us to be tempted above that which we
are able: he knows whereof we be made: he is as loath to afflict us as we are
to be afflicted: Lam. 3.33.
he does not willingly punish the children of men. It goes to the heart of a
tender Father to beat his child: the water stands in his eyes, it grieves him
to do it. So is it with our Heavenly Father: he is full of pity and
compassion: therefore let us endure his chastening, how bitter soever it seems
to be.

If we do, then God offers himself to us as unto sons: you are my sons, I will
acknowledge you for mine: now ye are my sons: now I will be your Father.

No son but will deserve it at one time or another, though he be never so good
a child. For children will forget themselves: and our blood is soon stirred:
even so the best of Gods children will deserve it. In many things we sin all:
the just falls seven times a day: and God in justice must strike, though not
in fury as we do.

Which he proves by a common custom among men: if they be not carried more by
affection, than judgment, they will do it: Oftentimes good fathers forget
themselves in it, and become fools: but ordinarily, what son is there whom the
Father chasteneth not? No son but the Father chasteneth him: so no good man or
woman, 1 Reg. 1.6.
but must be chastened by GOD.

VERSE. 8.
2 THE necessity of correction is set forth negatively: which is amplified by
the generality of it.

All. Before the Law, under the Law, after the Law.

Are partakers. Some one way, some another; some in one measure, some in
another: some in soul, some in body, name, goods. Some have a long sickness,
some a short.

Is there any that never had Febriculam?

Bastards: spurius, (...) semen: nothus, quasi, ignotus. Iud. 11.1. It is an
ignominious thing to be a bastard. Bastards are despised by all: many brands of
infamy are set on them by the Law.

1 A Bastard properly is not a son. Abraham was Pater, when he had Ishmael: but
not filii Pater, till he had Isaac. Amb. de Abr. pat. l. 1. c. 4.
So that he cannot inherit his Fathers lands, unless he be made legitimate by
act of Parliament.

2 A bastard may be advanced to no Office in Church or Commonwealth, without
special license, favor and dispensation.

If we be without correction, we are bastards. See thou a man that has no
cross in himself, wife, children, cattle, his little finger does never so
much as ache? thou may safely say, yonder goes a bastard: he is none of Gods
child, Job 21.9. Psalm. 73.4.

Here we see the lot of all Gods children; not one is exempted. The Grammarians
say, From this general rule are excepted these that follow. Here we have a
rule in Divinity, that admits no exception. All are partakers of correction:
all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer persecution. There is not
any one that can claim a privilege. This is Christ's cup, and we must all
drink of it: he has begun in it, and we must all pledge him. If thou be
Gods child, thou must be corrected. Whatsoever thy place be in the world,
whether thou be Magistrate, or Subject, Minister, or people, high or low,
rich, or poor: yea Kings themselves have their afflictions.

Marriage is a sweet state: the best Wine that ever was, was at a Marriage, even
Wine of CHRIST's own making: yet married folks must look for their
afflictions. This Rose has many pricking thorns about it: bona vincula:
nuptiarum, says S. Ambrose, de Virg. l. 3. sed tamen vincula: bonum conjugium;
sed tamen a jugo tractum: nubit and plorat: parturit and agrotat, de Virg. l.
1. Such (says S. Paul) shall have troubles in the flesh. 1 Cor. 7.28.
Sometimes the wife has a churlish Husband, as Abigail had of Nabal. Sometimes
the Husband has a cross Wife, as Job had of his. Sometimes they have both
untoward children, as Isaac and Rebekah had, that made them weary of their
lives. We must look for our afflictions in all conditions. If we be not
Bastards, but Sons, we cannot be without correction. Let us entreat the LORD
to give us faith, wisdom and patience, religiously to bear all his fatherly
chastisements, in this life, that we may have the inheritance of children in
his eternal kingdom in the life to come.

Now follow two other arguments. 1. From the less to the greater, 9, 10. 2.
From the event and end of afflictions, Verse 11.

The first argument is, 1. Propounded. 2. Enforced, Verse 10. it is propounded.
1. Quoad terrestrem. 2. Quoad coelestem patrem.

1. If we have quietly endured the chastisements of our earthly Fathers, then
much more should we endure the castigations of our heavenly Father.

But we have quietly endured the chastisements of our earthly Fathers, Ergo.

The assumption is set down, Verse 9.

Then the force of the consequence is urged, Verse 10.

VERSE 9.
FVrthermore. Besides the consolation out of the Scripture, even reason may
move us to it.

Of our flesh: the flesh is put for the body, because it chiefly consists of
flesh, 1 Cor. 5.5. flesh and spirit are opposite.

Which corrected us: when we were Children (...). Prove. 13.24.

And we did not only take it patiently at their hands, but we reverenced them,
stood in awe of them, were more loath to displease them: revereri est cum
timore honorem impendere.

Commonly those Parents are most reverenced of their Children, that have wisely
and orderly corrected them: they that have laid the reins on their necks and
suffered them to go without correction, are most despised and contemned of
their Children afterward. Adonijah whom David would not displease, displeased
David afterward.

He does not say, the mothers of our bodies: they for the most part cocker
their Children, seldom or never correct them in wisdom and discretion: but,
Fathers. The Fathers are the greater correctours. Shall we not much rather
subject our selves quietly to his castigations?

Father of Spirits: From whom we have the more principal part, which is the
soul or spirit.

We have our bodies also from him: Thou have fashioned me beneath, in my
mothers belly. Yet these mediately by the seed of our Parents: our spirits we
have immediately from God, Number. 16.22.27, 16. Zac. 12.1. Arist. l. 2. de gener.
animal. c. 3. says, that the soul comes (...) extrinsecus (...): one God did
not make the soul, and another the body, as the Manichees said.

He is the Father of our spirits, ratione adoptionis, regenerationis,
salvationis: but here ratione creationis.

There is no comparison between these two Fathers:

1. These are Fathers of one family: of him is named the whole family, Ephesians.
3.15.

2. The name of earthly fathers are drowned in him, Matthew. 23.9.

Children have no wit, wisdom, or experience: therefore they submit themselves
to their Fathers: no more have we, but from our heavenly Father. Therefore let
us subject our selves unto him. Children are subject to many inordinate
affections, which makes them the more quietly to yield to the ordering of their
Parents: so are we.

This is amplified by the benefit we reap by it, and live. Namely in his
eternal kingdom, being fitted for it by afflictions.

Though we submit our selves to the chastisements of our earthly Fathers, we
cannot but live a while in this miserable world: if we bear his
chastisements, we shall live for ever: therefore let us do it.

Souls are not a parcel of the Substance of God, but created of God, not
traduced by the seed of our Parents, Eccles. 12. Verse 7. Genesis 2.7. and 23.
As the first man's soul came: so do all others.

2. If they proceed from mortal seed, they must be mortal and perish with
the body Saint Augustine has four excellent books of it, to Barnabas, Petrus
proselyt. to Vincentius, Victor.

3. It comes either of the body of our Parents, or of their soul: if from the
body, it is mortal, as that is; if from the soul, then either the Father
conveieth his soul to his Son, and has none left himself, or a part of his
soul: then the soul should be partible, which a spirit is not.

Object. Genesis 46.26. Exodus 1.5.

There, souls is put for persons.

Object. Hebr. 7.9. Levi was in Abraham's loins in respect of his body and
soul too. Christ only in respect of his body.

But Christ in this place is comprehended under Melchizedec, not under Abraham.
Levi was there, in respect of father and mother too: Christ only in respect of
his mother.

Object. Then GOD should work with fornicators and adulterers.

Sol. In the act of generation, which is natural: not in the sin and violation
of his Law. A man steals seed, and sowes his ground with it; God sends him a
good harvest: yet God works not with his stealing.

When it is infused, and how, is scrupulous.

The soul is good, when it is infused by God: it is infected by the
conjunction of it with the body: As good wine put into a bad vessel: A clean
man is infected, if he come among Leapers.

VERSE 10.
HEre he shows the equity of the consequent, by three dissimilitudes between
our earthly and heavenly Father.

1. They chastened us for a few days, while we were Children, during the time
of our nonage: when we come to man's estate, they leave us to our selves, they
carry no longer such a strict hand over us, as before: Whereas the father of
spirits has a continual care over us, and holds us under his fatherly rod all
the days of our lives. Therefore we must never exempt our selves from his
Chastisements.

2. They do it according to their own pleasure, which oftentimes is corrupt,
they err in judgment and affection too. Sometimes they correct for that they
should not, and leave that uncorrected, which deserves correction: oftentimes
they correct in anger and fury, doing that they repent of afterward: but Gods
pleasure is always good: he is most wise, and knows how to correct: he is
not passionate and affectionate, as these fathers are.

3. They in chastening us, oftentimes respect their own ease and quietness,
their own credit, and commodity more than ours: or if they correct us for our
profit, yet it is but for a temporal profit, that we run not into outrages
in the world, that we may lead a civil honest life among men: that is the
mark most Parents aim at: Whereas the Father of spirits chasteneth us for our
profit, he himself stands not in need of us: not only to make us civil
men, secundum moralem quandam honestatem, but that we might be partakers of his
holiness: that we might be holy in soul and body in this life, and Citizens
of the holy Jerusalem in the life to come.

Peace, ease, health, wealth, worldly prosperity through the corruption of our
nature and the malice of Satan, makes us unholy. Noah continued an holy man all
the time of the flood, when he was shut up in the Arc and tossed with the
waters: he no sooner came to the dry ground and planted a vineyard, but in some
sort became unholy, being overtaken with wine. We read of no filthiness that
David committed, while he was persecuted by Saul: when he came to his kingdom,
and had peace from all his enemies, then he fell into adultery. When a man has
his health, and when he is of a strong and lusty constitution of body, he runs
at random, seldom or never thinks on God, not with such zeal and sincerity,
as he ought to do: on the other side, it is adversity that through Gods
goodness makes us holy men. Hezekiah, was better in his sickness, than in his
health. Manasses chains were a means to rid him of the chains of sin: when
he was the King of Babels prisoner, he became the Lords free man. David's long
and tedious sickness, there being no rest in his bones because of his sin, did
him much good: it made him to say, it is good for me, that I was afflicted. The
sickness of the body engenders the health of the soul: perijssemus, nisi
perijssemus, said Themistocles to his Wife and Children, when they were
banished, and found extraordinary favor at the hands of strangers. So we may
say; if our outward man had not perished by sickness, our inner man had
perished. In the time of health, we are Martha's, carried away too much with
the world. Sickness makes us Mary's, to meditate more upon heavenly matters:
that causes us to pray, and that with tears, to turn our faces to the wall,
and take a farewell of the world, as Hezekiah did: to call our sins to
remembrance, as 1 Reg. 17.18.

Therefore let us bear the chastisements of our wise and loving Father, that
we may be partakers of his holiness in this life, and of the holy Jerusalem
in the life to come.

VERSE 11.
THe event and issue of afflictions is amplified by a comparison of the times.

1. He shows the present asperity of afflictions: then the future utility.

No Child takes pleasure in correction: for the time it is irksome and
unpleasant: but when he comes to years of discretion, he praises God for it,
that he was not permitted to live as he listed, but was kept within the bounds
of piety. So Gods chastisements are not joyous for the time, Act. 5.41.
to the flesh, though the spirit then rejoices, as some have clapped their hands
for joy in the flames of fire: yet to the flesh no affliction is comfortable:
sickness, imprisonment, banishment, death is not joyous. Children cry out, o
good Master! good Father! So we cry out for pain, Oh my head, my back, etc.
Oh good Jesus -- Afterward, when the pain is removed, the heart purged, and
they feel the comforts of the spirit, It yields the peaceable fruit of
righteousness: Of an holy and righteous life lead in the fear of God: it
breeds quietness of conscience, the peace that passes all understanding.

It procures eternal rest and quietness in heaven, where we shall be free
from all calamities, 2 Cor. 4. pen.

The time of affliction is the seeds time, the harvest comes afterward: as he
said of virtue, amara radix, dulcis fructus, may most truly be said of
afflictions: the beginning is as bitter as gall or worme-wood; but the end
shall be sweeter than honey. A sick man will drink bitter potions for health:
a Merchant will endure storms and tempests for wealth. Ioh. 16.21.
A woman endures great pain and sore travel, for the joy of a man Child.

A Husbandman will sow in winter, that he may reap in harvest: so let us be
willing to sow in tears in this life of affliction: that we may reap in joy
in the life of rest and quietness.

This fruit is amplified by a description of the persons to whom it brings this
fruit: non castigatis, sed exercitatis: by them we are exercised to all
goodness.

God rewards us opportune, afterward: abunde, fruit: integre, of
righteousness: just, to them that be exercised.

One action makes not an exercise: he is not a Soldier that has fought once:
a wrastler, that has wrastled once; a Marrinour, that has sailed once:
habitus acquiritur crebris actionibus. So he is not exercised with
afflictions, that has been once afflicted. We must be exercised by many
chastisements: through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of
God. God will exercise us daily. The body that wants exercise is corrupt, and
if we be not exercised with afflictions, we shall grow naught.

There are two exercises for the faithful: the Scripture, Hebr. 3.14. and
affliction. (...), says Saint Chrysostom. (...): exercise makes a man valiant
and invincible. He that is not used to running, cannot run well: use makes
perfectnes.

This might mitigate the pain of affliction: it is but an exercise that God
uses for our good.

In all afflictions, let us not look so much on the time present, as on the
time to come. All our comfort is in this word afterward.

The cutting and lanching of a man; the putting of long tents into the soar of
a man is not joyous for the present: but when the dead flesh is taken out, the
soar cured -- the health that comes afterward brings joy: eadem est ratio
disciplinae, qua medicinae.

No apprentiseship for the time is very joyous: many of them work hard and fare
hard, they have many a heavy blow, are weary of their lives, think every year
two till they be out of their Apprentiseship. The joy comes afterward, when
they be free men, when they set up for themselves: by Gods blessing, some prove
Mayors, Aldermen, or the chief men in the town where they have served.

No childbirth is joyous for the present: when a woman travaileth she has
sorrow; but when she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the
anguish, for joy that a man is borne into the world. The seed time for the most
part is not very joyous: the husbandman endures much cold and rain, and his
seed for the present seems to be lost: when harvest comes, then comes the joy.
So the seed of righteousness is sown in affliction in this life, the great
joy shall be at the general harvest, in the life to come: Luke 16.25.
then all weeping and wayling shall be cast out: then we shall not know what
sickness means: then shall we have joys that neither eye has seen, nor
ear heard, neither entered into the heart of man to conceive. Let this be as
sugar to sweeten afflictions to us, 2 Cor. 4. ult.

Now follows the conclusion of this point: wherein he exhorts them to
courage, Ver. 12. to constancy, Ver. 13.

VERSE 12.
WHerefore: seeing the profit of affliction is so great, lift up the hands.
Manus sunt organa, organorum: they that be faint and of a feeble courage, hang
down their hands and have weak knees. The knees sustain the weight of the
body: Exodus 17.11.
he would have them to take heart to them, to lift up their hands, and to
strengthen their knees, that they may run the race set before them. Runners
stretch out their hands, legs and knees too. So must we in this spiritual
race.

VERSE 13.
STagger not, but go firmly like stout men: make straight steps: go not
awry: rectos gressus facimus, recte credendo, confitendo, patiendo.

Now ye halt, but ye are in the way; if ye look not to it, ye may be carried
quite out of the way.

There is triplex obliquitas: In intellectu, affectu, action.

The people in Elias time halted between two opinions, 1 Reg. 18.2.

So some of the Hebrews began to halt between two Religions, Iudaisme and
Christianisme. The false Apostles and persecuting Jews made them as it were to
halt. The ceremonial law, the Temple are of Gods institution: shall we forsake
them, and believe in Christ crucified: they that be Christians are hated of
all the world, spoiled of their goods and lives too.

We will pause a little on the matter, we will consider with our selves,
whether it were best for us to be Christians or not. This halting he would
have removed, and wishes them to make straight steps, to go on manfully in the
profession of the Gospel, that no afflictions make them to halt.

As for us, GOD be thanked for it, we live not in the time of persecution, as
the Hebrews did: we are not spoiled of our goods, cast into prison,
constrained to fly our native Country, carried to the stake to be burnt for
the name of CHRIST: we have a Virtuous and Religious King, that is a nursing
Father to the Church: yet the chastisements of the Lord are ryfe among us,
because we are not bastards; but Sons. When the first borne were destroyed
in Egypt, Exodus 12.30.
there was not one house of the Egyptians, but one dead in it. There is scant
one house among us, but there is one sick or afflicted in it. A man can
travel almost into no Country, but he shall find a number sick: sometimes
the man and Wife, Children and servants down at once. Neither are they of the
worser sort, drunkards, adulterers, atheists, etc. but many of the better sort;
good professors, sober, godly and religious men that are thus visited. Our
heavenly father sees something amiss among us, which causes him to send forth
his rods into so many places. The Church of Corinth was an excellent Church,
yet St. Paul says; for this cause, namely a negligent and disorderly receiving
of the Lords Supper, many are weak, sick, and sleep among you. The Lord sees
us to be rocked asleep, in security, to be negligent in prayer, reading of
Scripture, coming to Church: he sees the heavenly Manna of his Word, the food
of our souls to be loathed in all places, men wax too nise and dainty in
hearing: he sees the Sacraments not to be regarded, men make small reckoning of
these seals of faith.

For these causes many are weak and sick among us: yet let us not faint under
these afflictions. Let us lift up our hands that hang down, etc. Let us
consider who it is that strikes us: it is the LORD, said Eli, etc.

It is not an unlucky conjunction of Planets, they be not the dog days which
are the cause of these diseases: they are not simply to be imputed to the
weather, or the time of the year. It is the Lord, that smites us, and let him
do what seems him good. He is our loving and merciful Father in Christ
Jesus, he will lay no more on us then he will enable us to bear, to our
everlasting comfort in the end. We are chastned by the Lord, that we should
not be condemned with the world. He suffers the wicked oftentimes to live in
jollity: the rod of God is not upon them; they are not in trouble, as other
men: but he Schools his own Children, they shall seldom be without some
affliction or other, least they should be drowned in the pleasures of the
world. Therefore let us bear the chastisements of the LORD patiently for a
short time, in this life, which is but a spanne long, that we may live with
our heavenly Father in the life to come.

Hitherto he has given a precept touching our selves: how we our selves are
with patience to run the race set before us: quietly enduring such
chastisements, as our father imposes. Now he does further enjoyne us to be
as trumpets to waken others to it: that they may run together with us in the
race of Christianity.

Where, 1. An admonition.

2. A reason for the enforcing of it, Verse 18.

In the admonition, 1. A general propounding of it, Verse 14. 2. A particular
unfolding of it.


In the general propounding of it, 1. The virtues commended to us; peace and
holiness. Then the reason for the enforcing of them: of the latter especially.

VERSE 14.
HE does not say, embrace peace when it comes to you, and offers her self to
you: but though she run away, follow her; lay hold on her, and bring her
whether she will or no. We must seek peace instanter, follow it: generaliter,
with all: prudenter, in holiness.

Not, with some, but all; not with your friends alone, but with your enemies
too: not only with them of the same Religion, but with those that be of another
Religion. Be at peace with their persons, though not with their vices, be at
peace with all, what in thee lies: especially holiness, that is of absolute
necessity: be not so greedy of peace, that ye should forget holiness:
holiness of soul and body, 1 These. 4.3. 2 Cor. 7.1.

Hereunto he inviteth us, by the danger of the want of it: without which no
man: be he never so wise, learned, honorable: though he be a King, he cannot
be saved without holiness: shall see the Lord, in his blessed and glorious
kingdom, in the life to come: as a Citizen of the same kingdom.

Our Savior was at peace with the Pharisees: he went to many of their houses
to dinner: he was at peace with Caesar, though he were a persecutor of the
Church, and paid tribute to him: and we may be at peace with all men
throughout the wide compass of the world: with Atheists, drunkards,
adulterers, etc. 1 Cor. 5.10.

Yet here two cautions are to be observed.

1. We must distinguish between peace, and familiarity: we may be at a
general peace, even with the enemies of God: but we must not be familiar
with them. There is danger in that. All our delight must be on the Saints, that
be on the earth: they must be our familiars.

2. We may be at peace with the persons of all: but with the vices of none.

Be at peace with a drunkard, but not with his drunkenness: reprove that,
show thy dislike of that.

But we are so far from being at peace with all, as that we are not at peace
with our neighbors, with them that dwell in the same town, and profess the
same Religion with us: there is heart burning, envy and malice, strifes and
contentions even among us: nay, some are so far from being at peace with all
men, as that they are at peace with no man: like Ishmael, whose hand was
against every man.

We are so far from following of peace, that we will not accept of it, when
it is offered. They seek peace, and we refuse it. Such is our folly, we had
rather be following the Lawyers to our cost and smart, then to follow peace
home to prevent Law.

Let us all be followers of peace: let us follow it, let us seek it by all
means possible. The hunter follows the dear, though it run away: so let us
do peace, and lay hold on her whether she will or no.

Peace is a singular thing. God is styled the God of peace: he is not called
the God of faith, Romans 16.20.
etc. 2. Mat. 5.9. he does not say, blessed are they that can talk gloriously
of religion, but blessed are the peace makers: Why? for they shall be called
the Children of God. They that be at peace are Gods Children: they that live in
strifes and contention, are the Devils Children. The envious man sowed tares:
he it is that sows the tares of discord and dissension. 3. We are members
one of another: and shall we be at war? Joseph would not have his brethren to
fall out by the way: We are brethren, and have one elder brother, which is
Jesus Christ, shall we fall out one with another, and that upon every trifling
occasion? It is a wonder to see what jarres there are between the professors
of the Gospel, between neighbor and neighbor: scant two in a town that
love heartily and sincerely.

There be two especial things that hinder peace: pride and covetousness,
Prove. 13.10. Pride is the Nurse of contention. There is I proud, and Thou
proud: I stout, and Thou stout: none will bend, none will yield, as Abraham
did, though he were better than us every kind of way.

The second is Covetousness. We are so much wedded to the world, the valor of
an half penny will make us to contend. Why rather suffer ye not wrong? If
every man were content to put up a little wrong, what peace would there be in
the Town? how should it flourish, to the credit of the Gospel, and comfort of
us all?

The second virtue is holiness. It might be objected: if we follow peace with
all men, then we must bid holiness adieu. For some will not be at peace with
us, if we be holy. I, but if peace cannot be joined with holiness, away with
it: do not so follow peace, as that ye should let holiness go. Above all
things, lay hold on holiness.

Apoc. 1.7. They shall see him when he comes to judgment: but they shall not
see him in his kingdom. Or if they see him, it shall be afar off, as the rich
man in hell saw Lazarus: they shall not be partakers of his joy and glory.

Without learning, without variety of tongues, without riches, honor, beauty,
men may see the Lord: but without holiness none shall see him. By nature we
are all unholy, coming of unholy parents: borne and conceived in sin: but we
must be holy before we can go to Heaven. 1 Cor. 6.9. Be ye holy as I am holy.
The kingdom of heaven is called the holy Jerusalem. No unclean or unholy
thing can enter into it. The Angels for their unholinesse were cast out of
Heaven: and shall we think that GOD will take unholy men into heaven?

A great number scoff at holiness: O, yonder goes an holy man. Indeed if he
be a whited Tomb and a painted Sepulcher; whose holiness for the most part
consists in the laying open the unholinesse of others, he is worthy to be
despised.

But except we be all holy, we shall never see heaven. Let us be holy first in
heart, then in our eyes, tongues, hands, feet, and all the members of our body:
being truly holy, we shall see the Lord, to our eternal comfort. Perfectly
holy we cannot be in this world: there will always be some dross cleaving to
the best golden Candlestick: but let us be sincerely holy: and we shall
triumph with Christ for ever.

VERSE 15.
THese two are particularly unfolded: 1. Peace, then holiness, Verse 16. For
the preservation of peace, they must take heed there be no Apostats nor
backsliders among them. Apostasy from true religion will break the bond of
Christian peace.

1 A Caveat for the performing of it. 2. A means for the fulfilling of it.
Watching one over another: playing the Bishops and Overseers one of another,
Not 1 Pet. 4.15. busybodies in other men's matters.

Not only that your selves fall not away; but as much as lies in you, that
there be not one Apostata in the whole Church. It is a metaphor from
Travellours that lagge behind. (...), Saint Chrysostom.

By the grace of God in this place is not meant the everlasting love and favor
of GOD, but the Doctrine of the Gospel, which he of his grace and goodness
offers to us, 2 Cor. 6.1. Let none revolt from the truth of the Gospel, but
Continue in the grace of GOD.

As a remedy for the effecting of it, let no root of bitterness, etc. Deuteronomy.
29.18. Any bitter root of Heresy, of false and erroneous Doctrine (as
appears in Deuteronomy.) Besides that, any bitter roots of malice and envy, pride
and ambition, covetousness, etc. All these will breed strifes and quarrels
among you: therefore let them not spring up; beat them down so soon as they
arise.

He persuades them to keep them from springing up, by two pernicious effects:
the one has relation to themselves; the other, to others.

Trouble you: as a multitude running upon you.

And by this means many shall be defiled: for whose perdition you must answer.
One scabbed Sheep infects an whole flock. 2 Timothy 2.17. 1 Cor. 5.6. Judas
having fallen away from Christ, came howling to the Pharisees, and said, I have
sinned in betraying innocent blood. What is that to us, say they, look thou to
that. So though some round about us fall from the Gospel, to Popery, Atheism,
Brownisme, it never touches us, we are ready to say, What is that to us, am I
my brothers keeper? I verily, according to our place and ability.

Let every one of us in that place wherein God has set us, take heed, that no
man fall away from the grace of God. Let us all as much as lies in us, keep
them from falling: especially, let Pastors look to their sheep, and
Householders to them of their own houses.

If a fair and beautiful Apple fall from thy Tree, thou art somewhat grieved
at it: and shall it not grieve us to see Trees fall out of Gods Orchard?

Sin, as ye see, is a bitter thing.

Sweet in the committing: bitter afterward. It stingeth us after the
committing of it, and makes us to weep bitterly.

1 It is bitter in the conscience: when we come to a feeling of it, then our
hearts smite us for it, as David's did: then it sets us on the rack.

2 It is bitter in Gods judgments in this life. Adultery is bitter when the
pox comes, and other loathsome diseases.

3 It is bitter in the life to come, if not repented, when tormented in the
lake burning with fire and brimstone. Therefore let it be detested by us all.
Let a man offer us wormwood: so soon as we taste of it, we will spit it out
of our mouths. Sin is more bitter than wormwood: therefore away with it. Let
us give no entertainment to it.

It is a point of wisdom, Obstare principiis, and venienti occurrere morbo. We
must nip sin in the head at the beginning. Though we cannot keep it from
being, yet let us keep it from springing up: so soon as weeds grow in the
Garden, a good Gardener plucks them up: so soon as diseases begin to grow on
us, we send to the Physician. So soon as there is an hole in the house, we
mend it; even so, let us suffer no root of bitterness, in the Spring, Summer,
Autumn, Winter, to spring up among us; let us cut it down immediately. Let
not Popery spring up, Atheism, Epicureisme, any Sect or Schism among us: so
soon as they put out their heads, let us chop them off: but such is our
careless negligence and security; we suffer sin to grow so far, as that
the weeds are higher than the corn among us. This will be required at our
hands.

A wonder it is to see, how the branches of sin will spread themselves: their
word is a Canker, Arianisme quickly inverted the whole world, totus mundus
ingemuit se subito factum esse Arrianum. A little leaven leaveneth the whole
lump: One scabbed Sheep: -- If there be one Sectary, it will make many
Sectaries: one Drunkard, many Drunkards. Therefore let us prevent it betimes.
We are loath that one man that has the plague should come into the Town, left
it run over the whole Town. Sin is a dangerous plague sore, it will infect
many: yet we have no care to stop it; we suffer it to run on: but the souls of
those many that through our negligence are defiled with it, shall be required
at our hands. Therefore let us look to it.

VERSE. 16.
THE other branch which is holiness, is set forth by the contrary.

Holiness is in the body, or in the mind: one for the second Table; another
for the first. For the former: let there be no fornicatour; but possess your
Vessels in holiness and honor, Ephesians. 5.3. We must not suffer others to be
fornicators. Prophanus; procul a phano; one that is far from the Temple and
Seat of GOD: that cares not for God, for religion, for the things promised by
GOD. He prefers the trash of this world before the kingdom of heaven.

S. Chrysostom. expounds it, (...).

(...), the threshold of an house: (...), over the threshold of whose soul any
bad thing may enter.

He does illustrate it by one example, which may be instar omnium; whom he
brings on the stage as a Glass, for all to look in.

In whom consider, 1. His profane fact. 2. The punishment of it, Verse. 17. He
made sale of it, alienated it from himself.

1 What he sold. 2. For what he sold it.

The birthright was a spiritual thing: therefore Jacob committed symony in
buying of it.

So: non emit, he did not buy that which was none of his before, sed redemit,
having a right to it already by the decree of God: ab injusto possessore
redemit, says Aquinas.

Birthrights, with all the appurtenances belonging to it, which were many and
excellent. It is called birthrights, because it had many rights and
privileges as appurtenances.

1 It carried with it honor and dignity, Genesis 49.3. 2 Chronicles 21.3.

2 A double portion was tied to it, Deuteronomy. 21.7.

3 The firstborn were consecrated to the LORD: they were his.

4 Which was the principal, it was a pledge of the love and covenant of the
Lord: and the first borne was a type of Christ, the first begotten among many
brethren. Unto the birthright was annexed the kingdom of heaven.

Yet profane Esau sold it away, Genesis 25.32.

For what? What had he for it? Not a peck of gold, or a bushel of silver: but
a mess of pottage.

For one morsel of meat. If he had had many dainty dishes for it, it had
been somewhat. For one dish, and that a base one too, he sold that which was
better worth than all the meat in the world besides.

A profane person is a belly-god: he loves his belly above his soul: earth
above heaven, Phil. 3.19. whereas Mat. 6.33. Heaven should beloved above all
the treasures of the earth.

Fornication was esteemed by the Heathen a light sin, Acts 15.29.
or no sin at all. In so much as the Apostles in the Convocation held at
Jerusalem, were feign to make a Canon against it. Saint Paul has a large
discourse against it, 1 Cor. 6.9. The Scripture is vehement against it; it
excludes fornicators out of the Kingdom of Heaven: Whoremongers GOD will
judge: not Adulterers alone, but any kind of Whoremongers. It is a sweet
sin: but GOD has provided sour sauce for it: therefore let it be avoided
by us all.

1 It is peccatum maxim inexcusabile. A Thief may say, I had nothing to live
upon, I was constrained to steal. A Fornicator cannot say; lust was great in
me, I must needs have a whore for avoiding of fornication, 1 Cor. 7.2.

2 It is peccatum maxim erubescibile; Genesis 38.23.

3 It is maxim detrimentosum: aufert omnia bona. Fortunae: Prove. 29.3. An
example we have in the Prodigal Son. Bona naturae, it consumes the body.
Fornicatio quasi formae necatio. Bona gratiae, Hos. 4.11. A man that has his
heart on a Harlot, cannot have it on GOD. If he said, I have married a wife, I
cannot come; much more will an adulterer say, I have an whore, I cannot come:
he cannot pray, read Scriptures, hear Sermons, to the profit and comfort of
his soul: it does also take away from us the Kingdom of Heaven, 1 Corinthians.
6.9. Wherefore let it be avoided by us all.

If we will have no fornicatours among us, let there be no drunkards among us:
for drunkenness will pull on fornication. Seldom shall ye have a common
drunkard, but he is a common fornicatour too. If we will expel fornication
out of the Town, let us expel drunkenness out of the Town. This is one
effect of drinking wine: then the eyes look on strange women, Prove. 23.33. it
is a dangerous sin. David the holiest man, Solomon the wisest, Sampson the
strongest was overcome with it. Therefore let us all stand on our watch and
ward.

The wicked are never mentioned in Scripture, but to their disgrace. Let there
be no Traitor among you, as Judas: no gross and open Idolater, as Jeroboam,
that made Israel to sin: no Strumpet, as Iesabel, whose adulteries were in
great number: no worldling is Demas: no drunkard, as Falcidius, qui superavit
totam Asiam bibendo. If their names be registered to posterity, it is with a
perpetual blot of infamy.

His profaneness does appear by a Sale that he made. The Gardarens were
profane persons, Luke 8.37. Luc. 16.14.
which had rather forgo Christ then their Hogs. The Pharisees were profane
persons, that laughed at Christ when he preached against covetousness. That
Judge was a profane person, that neither feared GOD, nor reverenced man. Those
Philosophers that mocked at the resurrection: and those Epicures were profane
persons, that said, Let us eat and drink, to morrow we shall dye. They that
sit quaffing and swilling in Tavernes and Alehouses in Sermon time: they know
there is a Sermon in the Church, yet wittingly and willingly they continue in
the Alehouse still. What are these but profane persons? For a little drink,
they loose the sincere milk of the Word, whereby they might grow to
everlasting life. All covetous Misers, that are glued to their wealth, that had
rather lose the Kingdom of Heaven, than their riches, are profane persons;
the pottage of this world is sweeter to them than the joys of Heaven. Let me
live merrily while I am here, let me have the world at will, and let them take
Heaven that can get it. O miserable wretches! Far unlike Moses, that
preferred the rebuke of CHRIST, before the treasures of Egypt.

They count Heaven but a Tale of a Tub: whereas we ought to Count all as
Dongue, that we may win CHRIST. Let there be no such profane persons among
us: where the sound of the Word ringeth daily in our ears, let us have holy
and heavenly minds.

Yet are there not profane persons among us, that count all preaching prating,
that no credit is to be given to the Scripture, full of contradictions, shall
we believe them? They have gotten such a savor in drinking, and whoring, that
the very Scriptures seem bitter to them.

VERSE 17.
THE second thing considerable in Esau, is the punishment of his fact.

Where, 1. A desire to have it again. 2. A denial of it. He would have had it
again, but could not: his repentance was too late.

Ratified by their own testimony: for ye know how that afterward, being
exercised in the Scriptures.

The blessing: which depended on the birthright. Then he would have had it
with all his heart, but could not get it: he begged it earnestly at his Fathers
hand, but could not get it.

Shall a man seek repentance and not find it? At what time soever a sinner
repents of his sins from the bottom of his heart, etc.

Esau sought not repentance: but was grieved for the punishment, not for the
sin: he grieved, non quia vendiderat; sedquia perdiderat primogenita, as one
speaks.

Nevertheless this is not referred to Esau his repentance, but to Isaac. His
Father Isaac would by no means repent of that which he had done, Jacob he
had blessed, and he should be blessed. Esau could not move him to reverse the
blessing, do what he could.

(...): he sought it earnestly with tears; Genesis 27.34.
with howling and crying too. There is no necessity in the Greek to supply the
word [ blessing.]

The pronoune may be referred to the word [repentance] immediately going
before: he found no place of repentance; that is, of his fathers repentance,
though he sought it with tears. All his crying would not make his father
repent. Jacob had the blessing, and he should enjoy it. Esau had a kind of
blessing too, concerning temporal things, but not like that of Jacobs.

For ye know: I speak to such as are acquainted with the word of God. The
Sadduces did err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God: but all
good Christians must know the Scriptures, they must have their senses exercised
in them, they must search them daily, as the Bereans did: that when the
Preacher speaks of any History in the Bible, he may speak as to men of
knowledge. But now a days, a number even in the Country are better Lawyers,
than Divines, more skill in the Statutes and Laws to wrangle with their
neighbors, than in the Law of God.

This is the foolish nature of man. There be many rich and excellent blessings,
which we make no reckoning of, when we have them, which afterward we would
willingly have, and cannot get them. When David had free liberty to come to
Gods house, he was not so much inflamed with the love of it: but in exile he
longed after it; then the Sparrowes and Swallows, that build their nests by
GOD's Altar, were in better case than he. Psalm. 84.3.
When the prodigal Son was at home in his fathers house, where he had
abundance of all things, he set light by it; but when he was keeping Swine,
ready to starve for hunger, than he would be as one of his fathers hired
servants; his fathers Table could not content him before, now he would be
glad to sit at the servants Table. While Esau had the birthright and the
blessing too, he regarded it not: now he howles for it, and cannot get it. Let
us make much of good things while we have them. So it is with us: we live now
in peace and prosperity, there is no leading into captivity, nor complaining in
our streets: we may come to Church without any fear of the enemy: sickness
does not keep us at home, as it does many. Yet these benefits are now scarce
worth a good mercy. What care we? we will not set a foot over the threshold to
go to Church now. But I pray God that the time come not, that we shall not
only wish, but howl and cry for them, and not get them. Let us use with all
thankfulness the gracious mercies of GOD, while we have them, least afterward
we seek for them, when it is too late. While we have the light, let us walk
worthy of the light: while ye have the word, make much of the word: while ye
have health, use your health to Gods glory, and the salvation of your souls.

3 Esau found no place to repentance: All that he could do or say, could not
make his father to repent. If we have done a thing that is agreeable to the
will of God, we must never repent of it, Psalm. 15.4. Jacob had laid his
righthand on the head of Ephraim. Joseph would have removed it: but he could
not. Isaac had blessed Jacob, he would not reverse the blessing. Pilat had
written, The King of the Jews, the Scribes and Pharisees could not move him to
alter it: What I have written, I have written. If it be a bad thing, let us
repent quickly of it. Let us not persist in an evil thing, for that is
stubbornness and wilfulness: but in a good thing let us persevere to the end:
in that let us be rocks, not reeds or weather-cocks. As Jesus Christ yesterday
and to day, the same for ever: so in all holy and upright things let us be like
Socrates, semper idem, the same yesterday and to day continually.

Could he not make him repent? Why? what did he for the effecting of it? he
used as strong arguments as he could. Tears are forcible, and oftentimes move
flinty hearts. When Pharaohs Daughter saw Moses cry, she pitied him. Esau
cries for the blessing, yet God will not move Isaac to give it him. This is
strange. Seek and ye shall find: Esau sought, and that with tears too; yet
he found not.

All tears are not acceptable to GOD: there be lachrymae compunctionis, such
as Mary Magdalens were, being pricked with sorrow for sin; she wept
abundantly, and watered CHRIST's feet with her tears. These be good tears,
which the Angels in Heaven rejoice at.

There be lachrymae compassionis; such as Christ's were, when he wept over
Jerusalem. There are lachrymae devotionis: such as the Jews tears were, that
wept because the second Temple was not so glorious as the first, Esra 3.12.
There are lachrymae desperationis: such are the tears of the damned in hell.

There be lachrymae simulationis: as Ier 41.6. Such are Crocodiles tears, and
as they say, some Women's tears, that have them at command.

There are lachrymae rancoris and indignationis: such were the tears of Esau;
he wept more upon stomach, being vexed in his mind, that he should be thus
defrauded by his brother, than for any grief for sin: more for the loss, than
the fault. It seems he never wept because he had displeased God in selling
away his birthright, but because he saw into what misery he had plunged
himself. Therefore God regarded not his tears, neither would he have Isaac to
be moved with them. Otherwise, if they be holy and religious tears, flowing
from the Fountain of a true sorrowful heart for sin, God esteems highly of
them: he puts them into his bottle, and of his mercy will reward them in the
life to come. Therefore let us weep bitterly for our sins in this life, that
GOD may assume us into that place where all tears shall be wiped from our
eyes, in the life to come.

The argument for the enforcing of the exhortation is taken from the bounty of
GOD toward us, in the time of the Gospel, above them that lived in the time
of the Law.

If God have dealt more kindly and mercifully with us, then he did with them;
then our holiness must exceed theirs: but God has dealt more kindly and
mercifully with us then he did with them: Ergo, we must be more holy than they
were.

The comparison is, 1. Propounded, to Verse 25. Then applied.

It has two members.

1. A narration of their condition in the time of the Law. 2. Of ours, in the
time of the Gospel.
The narration has two parts.

1. A description of their estate. 2. An amplification of it, Verse 20. Theirs
was status terror is: ours amoris.
VERSE 18.
THeir estate is described. 1. By the place where the Law was given: it was a
material mount, that might be touched with the hands and fingers of men; ours
is spiritual and immateriall. In respect of Gods charge, Exodus 19.22.
it might not be touched; but in it self it was touchable: so is not ours.

2. By the accidents that fell out in the place. Exodus 19.18.


That burned with fire: which strikes a terror into the beholders. Nothing
more terrible then fire: it makes men afraid to look upon it.

Blackness: which are uncomfortable: therefore hell is resembled to outer
darkness.

And tempest: that came with a force and power: it may be it did bear down
trees before it: the Law as a Schoolmaster, came with rods.

VERSE 19.
3. BY the manner of Gods teaching and instructing of them at the delivery of
the Law.

It was by the sound of a Trumpet to prepare them to attention. The Trumpet
that sounds to a battle is terrible, Exodus 19.16.19.
so shall the Trumpet be at the day of judgment. And by Gods immediate voice
speaking to them, which the people could not endure, Exodus 20.19.
but requested that God would not speak to them any more.

VERSE 20.
A Reason is rendered from their inability: for they could not endure -- Here
we may behold the necessity of the word preached by men like to our selves. We
are not able to bear Gods own voice. Therefore in mercy he speaks to us by
his Ambassadors. He spoke to them in the Old Testament by Moses and the
Prophets: to us by Christ and his Apostles, by learned and godly Preachers sent
to us in all ages. Though they be men subject to the same passions that we are
(as Saint James speaks of Elias) yet their voice is Gods voice: he that
hears them, hears Christ. Therefore let us not despise them, because they
be men; but honor them, as the men of God: receive them as Angels from
heaven, yea as Christ himself.

Preachers were appointed in regard of our weakness: therefore let us praise
God for them, and hear them with all reverence.

This fearful spectacle is amplified. 1. By the strictness of the charge. If
a beast: beasts grase here and there in the valleys and Mountains too: they
be unreasonable creatures, and understood not the charge given by God.

Yet if a beast touched the Mountain, etc. So severe was the delivery of the
Law.

VERSE 21.
2. BY the affection of Moses, who was a principal man among them, by whose
hand the Law was delivered, yet he feared, and quaked: (...) mente; (...)
corpore.

I exceedingly fear and quake: These words are not expressed in the Old
Testament, yet we are to believe them: as the names of the sorcerers Iannes and
Iambres supplied by Saint Paul.

Nevertheless they may be collected out of Exodus. Moses, said, I fear and
quake. God answered, comforting him, Exodus 19.19 dixit facto, etsi non verbo.

Moses was a rare and singular man, greatly honored by God Almighty: he
divided the Red Sea and brought the people over. God talked familiarly with
him, as one friend uses to do with another: when he was dead, God vouchsafed
to bury him himself, yet Moses shook like an Aspenleafe. He was not only
afraid, but he trembled too.

Such is the Majesty of God: that it makes the holiest men in the world to
quake because of sin in them. When God spoke to Adam after the fall, he was
afraid, and hid himself among the trees. Manoah cried out, we have seen God,
therefore we shall dye. Moses at the delivery of the Law did quake and tremble:
then how shall the wicked shake, when Christ shall come at the latter day; to
take an account of the fulfilling of the Law? Felix trembled, when he heard of
the day of judgment: what shall they do when they see it? they shall cry out
with them in the Apocalypse, the great day of his wrath is come, etc. If Moses
quake, how shall Ahab quake? if St. Peter, how shall Judas? Let us labor
before hand to be reconciled to GOD by JESUS CHRIST, that we may stand
without trembling before the Son of man.

Ye see their condition in the time of the Law: there was blackness and
darkness, all things were then obscure. We have the clear light and bright
Sun shine of the Gospel. All things were terrible to them: all things are
comfortable to us. God the Father speaks to us sweetly from heaven, this is my
beloved Son, hear him. They could not abide the voice of God, it sounded
with such terror in heir ears. GOD the Son speaks amiably to us, come to
me all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest:
therefore f much holiness were required of them, how much more of us? At the
delivery of the Law, they were to sanctify themselves from the highest to the
lowest, they were to wash their garments, they might not come at their Wives
all the while: then how holy ought we to be, with whom GOD deals so lovingly
in the time of the Gospel?

If a servant that has a sower Master, that looks fiercely on him, and
speaks angerly, must obey: how much more obedient ought he to be that has a
kind and loving Master, that looks on him always with a cheerful
countenance, and speaks friendly to him? God in the time of the Law was
terrible master: he is most kind to us now in Christ Jesus. Therefore let us
serve him with all cheerfulness.

We have had a view of the terrible estate of the Church in the time of the
Law. Now let us see the comfortable estate of the Church, whereunto we are come
in the time of the Gospel.

What Saint Basil speaks of the Scripture in general, may be avouched of this
in special, Hexam. Hom. 6. (...).

VERSE 22.
THe estate of the Church in the time of the Gospel is set forth, 1. By a
narration of the places to the which we are come. 2. By an enumeration of the
persons to whom we are come. The places are two: one a Mountain, the other a
City.


Every word is to be observed. We must not pretermit the adversative (...),
but. Ye have heard how it was with them: they were in a pitiful case,
nothing but fear and terror, it is otherwise with you; the case, is altered
with you. You are in a more blessed condition: illi procul stabant, they stood
afar of, they might not touch the bottom of the Mount: if a beast touched
it, he dyed for it. Vos prope est is, you are come near.

Not to Mount Sinai, full of smoke, blackness, darkness and tempest: but to
Mount Sion, a sweet and amiable Mount.

Sion, speculatio dei, as Gregory does interpret it. Moral. l. 33. c. 1. GOD is
to be seen by manifest tokens in the Church, and contemplatio Dei nos fortes
reddit. The contemplation of God in Christ Jesus infuseth courage into us all:
it makes us more strong and valiant. Thus God has been more gracious to you,
if ye can make a good use of it.

The Church is resembled to a Mountain not to a valley.

1. Propter altitudinem, for the height of it: a Mountain is higher than the
ordinary earth: the Church is high, it is (...), above, Gal. 4.26. and they
that be of the Church must carry high and regal minds: they must not be
(...), but (...), 1 Cor. 10. not Crows that hover below on the earth; but
Eagles that Mount up into heaven. Whereupon Saint Hierome Epist. 17. has a
witty observation of the blessed Virgin Mary.

When she saw her womb to be domum Dei, the house of the Son of God, relictis
campestribus ad montana perrexit, leaving the low Champion Countries, she went
up into the hill Country: Luke 1.39. So after we begin to bear Christ in the
womb of our souls by faith, we must leave earth, and mount up in our
affections into heaven: we must seek the things that be above, where Christ
sits at the right hand of God.

2. The Church is compared to a Mountain, propter securitatem: for the
security of it. A City seated on an high Mountain, furnished with munition and
victuals within it self, strongly fenced against blustering winds and stormy
tempests, cannot easily be overcome: no more can the Church: the gates of hell
may (...), but cannot (...): valere, avayle for a time; but they cannot
praevalere.

Matthew. 16.18.
3. Propter ascendendi difficultatem, for the difficulty of ascending to it. A
man may not go up an high hill, but it must cost him pains, sweat and labor:
so it is a laborious thing to get to heaven. Labor for the meat that endures
to life everlasting: Ioh. 6.27. Luke 13.24.
strive to enter in at the strait gate: if by any means, says S. Paul, Phil.
3.11.
I may attain to the resurrection of the just.

4 Propter immobilitatem, for the immobility of it: mons a movendo, by
Antiphrasis, quia minime movet. The Church is as Mount Sion that stands fast
for ever, and cannot be removed. Happy are they that be of the Church. When S.
Peter was on Mount Tabor, where he saw but a glimmering of the joys of heaven,
he was so ravished with it, that he cried out, Master it is good for us to be
here, let us here make our Tabernacles. That was unadvisedly said of him. But
let us all be earnest suitors to GOD Almighty, that we may make our
Tabernacles in Mount Sion for ever and ever.

The second place unto which we are come, in the time of the Gospel is a
City. The Church in the time of the Law was in the wilderness: now it is a
City, and that a most worthy and famous City. Where is to be considered, 1.
Cujus sit civitas, whose City it is. 2. Quae, qualisue sit, what City it is.
It is the City not of a Man, but of God. Rome was Romulus's City. Philippi
was Philips City. Alexandria was Alexanders City. Constantinople was
Constantin's City: but this is GOD's City. Not the City of a dead and forged
God, of Jupiter, Apollo, Mars, Mercury, but the City of the living God.
Therefore as he never dies, but lives for ever: so that City shall abide for
ever.

And if ye will needs know what City it is, not to hold you in suspense, it is
Jerusalem: Visio pacis, the vision of peace. Here is all peace, no war in
this City. Not earthly Jerusalem, which was a renowned City in her time: but
Heavenly Jerusalem, the Mother of us all.

Theodosius the Emperor was wont to say, Theod. l 5. c. 1^
Solus Ambrosius dignus Episcopi nomine. Only Ambrose is worthy of the name of
a Bishop. We may better say, Solum Coelum dignum civitatis nomine: only Heaven
is worthy the name of a City. These Cities may be overturned by earthquakes.
Simeon a little before the earthquake in Phaenicia, whipped the pillars in the
marketplace, saying, (...): stand, ye must dance shortly. Euag. l. 4. c. 34
They may be overflowne by inundations of waters, as Rome was by the River
Tyber: insomuch as they were feign to row with boats in the streets, Plat. in
vit. Nichol. prim.
many Churches and houses were overthrown: they may be sacked by the enemies:
we may meet with many crosses and calamities in them that may make us weary of
our lives: our houses even in our lives time may go to our enemies. S.
Chrysostom professes he could name some, to whom it has happened. When death
comes, that thrusts us out of these Cities. If they remain till the day of
judgment, then the world with all the magnificent buildings shall be burnt
with fire. If a Man were sure the City would fall the next year, who would
build in it? The world may fall this year for ought we know: therefore let us
not fix our solace, nor repose out confidence in these transitory Cities: let
us look up with the eye of faith to this permanent and abiding City, whose
maker and builder is God: where we shall have joys, that eye has not seen,
ear heard, nor yet can enter into the heart of man.

But are we come to it already? Not by many a mile. Saint John came to it by a
vision, Apoc. 21. S. Peter, S. James, and S. John, came to a glimmering of it,
by the sight of Christ's transfiguration in the Mount: but how are we come to it?

Credendo venisti, sed nondum pervenisti; adhuc in via sumus: venimus, sed
nondum pervenimus. Aug. de verb. Apost. Sermon. 12.

We have this City already. 1. Per virtutem promissionis: godliness has the
promises of this life, and that which is to come. He has promised it, that
cannot lie, nor deny himself. In him there is no shadow of turning.

2 Per Dei donationem, Luc. 12.32. It is your Fathers pleasure to give you the
Kingdom.

3 Per ejus haereditarium, it is an inheritance.

4 Per fidei apprehensionem, John 3. ult. Faith is the evidence of things not
seen. Abraham saw the day of Christ by faith: so do we the heavenly Jerusalem.

5 Per spei expectationem. Ye are saved by hope; and this Anchor is cast
upwards into the heavenly Sanctuary.

6 We shall have it one day Per plenariam fruitionem and possessionem. One
Busices a Noble Man of Persia seeing one Ananias an old man go trembling to
death, said, (...): shut thine eyes a while, be bold, and thou shall see the
light of God. Soz. l. 2. c. 11. Through many tribulations we must enter into
the kingdom of God; by sickness, poverty, malevolent tongues; by death: yet
we shall have it. The light affliction which is but for a moment, procures an
eternal weight of glory. So let us shut up the carnal eyes of our body, let
us have the eyes of faith open: undoubtedly we shall one day enjoy the glorious
light of this heavenly Jerusalem.

Now let us proceed to the persons to whom we are come: they are in number
five. The first are the guardians of the Church: the second is the Church it
self: the third is the Founder and preserver of the Church: the fourth is
certain special members of the Church: the fifth, is our Savior Christ, the
Head and Mediator of the Church.

The guardians of the Church are the Angels, the Soldiers that keep the
City. Nomen spiritus, nomen essentiae, the name of Spirit is the name of
essence. If we respect their nature, they be Spirits: nomen Angeli, nomen
officii. An Angel is a Messenger. Ye are come to innumerable messengers, sent
from God, ministering spirits for the salvation of elect men. In whom these
points are briefly to be discussed.

1 Their Number* 2. Their Order. 3. Their Wisdom. 4. Their Power. 5. Their
Office. 6. Whether every one of Gods elect have a particular Angel, or not?

1. For their number. We need spend no time about that, because it is here
said, that they be innumerable: (...), to Myriads of Angels. One Myriad is ten
thousand thousands: to many 10000s. of Angels. Thousands ministered to him, and
ten thousand thousands stood before him, Dan. 7.10. Such a multitude of them,
Aug. Contr. Max. Arr. l. 1.
that our Savior compares all mankind to one sheep in comparison of them,
Luke 15.4.

They are innumerable to us, not to GOD. There be many things that we cannot
number, but GOD can. We cannot number our sins, the hairs of our heads, the
sand of the Sea shore, the Stars in the firmament; but God can. So we cannot
number the Angels: but God can. The set number is not defined in the Scripture,
only it is said to be a great company of them, for the comfort and
strengthening of us all.

2. Touching their order. Where some curious brains put all out of order.
Nicephorus reports many strange things of Dionysius Areopagita. Lib. 2. cap. 20.


1. That Saint Paul baptized him with his own hands: 1 Cor. 1.16
yet it is more than Saint Paul himself remembers.

2. That he constituted him Bishop of Athens: but where or when he cannot tell.

3. Which is the strangest of all, that Saint Paul revealed to him and one
Hierotheus the secrets he saw in the third heaven, among the which was the
hierarchy of the Angels, which he afterward committed to writing. De
praescript. adv. haeret.
Nevertheless Tertullian arms us against such fantastical conceits: if any
says he, shall pretend the knowledge of the secrets which Saint Paul saw in
Paradise, Paulus secreti proditor reus est: either Saint Paul is guilty of high
Treason in disclosing the secrets of the King of Kings, or another was taken up
into Paradise, to whom it was lawful to utter that, which St. Paul might not:
neither of them both can be, because they were (...), ineffable words.
Therefore no credit is to be given to them. 2 Cor. 12.4.


Yet for all that, Peter Lombard, the master of the sentences, Lib. 2. did. 9.
whom all the School men follow, building principally on the authority of
Dionysius Areopagita takes on him to determine, that there be nine orders of
Angels: and those nine are divided into three ternaries, for the signification
of the Trinity.

The superior is Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones: the middle is Dominations,
Principalities and Powers: the inferior, Virtues, Archangels, and Angels.

A strange thing, that Archangels should be set so low. An Archbishop is
above all the Bishops in his province: and one would think an Arch-Angell
should be above all Angels.

Saint Augustine is of a more modest spirit: quomodo se habeat beatissima illa
ac superna civitas? Enchyr. ad Laurent. c. 58.
how it is in that blessed and supreme city, whether there be any difference of
Angels, they being all called by the general name of Angels, whether there be
Archangels or not, and how these four words differ, and quid inter se distent
4 Illa vocabula, whether they be thrones, dominations, Principalities or
powers. Dicant qui possunt, si tamen possunt probare quod dicant: let them
speak that can speak, yet so as they prove that which they speak. Ego me
istaec ignorare confiteor, I confess I am ignorant of these things. 1 Cor. 4
6..
Let the like humility be imitated of us all. Let no man presume to understand
above that which is written. Iud. 9.
The Scripture makes mention of Archangels. Michael the Archangel disputed
with the Devil about the body of Moses. An Arch-Angell shall sound a Trumpet
at the last day, 1 These. 4.16. Some interpret it of a created Angel, that has
the title and office of an Arch-Angell only for a time, for the accomplishment
of some weighty and extraordinary work: no perpetual superiority above the
rest. Cornelius a lapide says, it is Gabriel: who as he did foretell CHRIST
's first coming to the Virgin; so he shall publish his second coming to the
world. Saint Ambrose and Aquinas are of that opinion.

Yet that Arch-Angell rather is CHRIST, who is termed Michael, our Prince,
Daniel 10. ult. The name is suitable to him, and to no other. Micha, ael. Who is
like to God Almighty? none so like him as his Son, the engraven form and
character of the Father.

3. For their wisdom and knowledge, it is admirable. The devils know much,
(...) quasi (...): much more do the good Angels: De Genesi ad lit.
they have matutinam and vespertinam scientiam, as Augustine speaks, their
morning and evening knowledge: their morning knowledge they have by creation
and a continual contemplation of GOD; their evening knowledge they have, by
observation from the creatures, Ephesians. 3.10.
and a diligent inspection into the Church. They be no fools: they be wise
guides that have the custody of us.

4. For their power, it is wonderful, surpassing the power of evil Angels:
for it is very probable, that as the rest of their gifts, so their power is
weakened since their fall.

Hebr. 1. ult.
5. For their office: it is to serve God and the Lambs wife the Church: they
perform many fruitful offices to us. As Soldiers, they pitch their Tents
about us, defending us from the devil and his Angels, Isai. 5. I have hedged
in my Vineyard, that is, Custodia Angelorum. Gainas sent a great multitude in
the night to burn the Emperors Palace at Constantinople: Socr. l. 6. c. 6.
a multitude of Angels met them in the form of armed men, of a great stature;
they supposing them to be magnum and strenuum exercitum, ran away. As
nurses, they hold us in their arms, Psalm. 91.12. that we dash not our foot
against a stone. Some interpret it to be Christ, the stone of offense: but it
is to be extended to all dangers whatsoever. They comfort us in our griefs,
sorrows, and calamities, though we be not able to discern it. An Angel was
sent to comfort our Savior Christ, when he was in his agony in the Garden,
Luke 22.43. There was one Theodorus a young man that was cast into a scalding
lead: an Angel in the similitude of a man stood by him with a napkin in his
hand, that wiped the drops of sweat that trickled down his body: insomuch as
it seemed to him (...), a pleasure rather than a conflict; as he himself after
reported to Ruffinus. Socr. l. 3. c. 19.
They observe our doings and behavior, 1 Cor. 11.10. they grieve if we do
ill, and rejoice in our well-doing. Luc. 15.10. They make us rhetorical, nitor
eloquii per bonos Angelos ministratur, Bern.
the glory and brightness of eloquence is conveyed unto us by the good
Angels. They keep us carefully while we be alive; and at our dying-day, they
take our souls and carry them up into Abrahams-bosome, as they did the soul
of Lazarus: and Greg. in his Dialogues, names many holy men, whose souls were
seen after a visible manner to be carried by the Angels into heaven. The
Angels sung at the funeral of the Virgin Mary. Nicephor. lib. 15. cap. 14.
They be apparitores Dei, as Lactant. calls them, Gods Apparitors: for Mat.
24.31. They gather the elect together from the winds, and bring them to God at
the last day.

I but you bring us into a fools Paradise. We see none of these things
performed by the Angels. What then? we must walk by faith, not by sight. Thou
see not GOD, yet thou beleevest there is a God; thou see not thine own
soul: yet beleevest thou have a soul. So though we see not the Angels
ministering to us, yet let us believe it. It is divinely and elegantly set forth
by Bernard. Quid si non videmus obsequium, cum experiamur auxilium? what though
we see not their service, when we have experience of their aid? quid si non
mereamur aspectum, cum sentiamus effectum?

What though we behold not their ministration with our eyes, when we feel the
fruit and effect of it in our lives? This is the Lords doing, and it ought to
be mavelous in our eyes. What am I, O Lord, said David, and what is my
fathers house, that thou have brought me hitherto? What are we miserable
sinners, wormes-meat, dust, and ashes, that the high and holy Angels should
wait on us? This is Gods unspeakable goodness; his Name be blessed and
magnified for it.

The last question remains: whether every one of GOD's elect have a
particular Angel or not. The greatest part of the Fathers affirm, that we
have. Among the Greek, Basil, Pet. Lomb. l. 2. did. 11.
Naz. Theod. Chrysostom. Theoph. Among the Latin, Origin, Jerome, Aug. Greg. Yet
there is some discrepance between them. Greg. says that we have two: a good
one ad nostri custodiam, for our preservation; an evil one, ad nostri
exercitium, for the exercising of us. Yet the greater sort contend but for one:
and there is a controversy about that one, whether he be assigned to us a
nativitate, or a baptismo; Tom. 2 in Mat. tr. 5. p. 66
from our birth, or from our baptism. Origin disputes it in utramque partem.
Zanchius a late Divine, thinks that both may well be conjoined together.
Extraordinarily as the Lord sees it meet and expedient, we have many Angels for
our protection: yet ordinarily, every one of Gods elect has a particular
Angel appointed to him from his cradle to his grave. The principal places
whereon they build are these.

1. Genesis 48.16. The Angel which has delivered me from all evil, bless the
children. In the Hebrew it is not [ Maloac] but, ham maloac.] (...), ille
Angelus, that Angel (...), Christ Jesus the Prince of Angels, which oftentimes
appeared to Jacob and delivered him, and especially at Bethel; insomuch as he
styles him self, The God of Bethel, Genesis 31.11.13. This Angel is expressly
called GOD, Verse. 15. The God that has fed me all my life long to this day,
bless thee: he that fed him, says Chrysostom. and he that delivered him, is all
one.

2. Mat. 18.10. Cajetan the Cardinal has a remarkable annotation on that
place: been nota, note it well. Non dixit, singuli Angeli eorum, sed Angeli
eorum: not their particular Angels, but their Angels: neque enim ex hoc textu
colligi potest singulos credentes singulos habere Angelos: it cannot be
collected out of this Text, that every believer has a particular Angel: for
Christ uses the plural number, their Angels, not the singular; every ones
Angel. Take heed ye despise not one of these little ones, for I say to you,
that in heaven their Angels do always behold the face of my Father which is
in heaven.

There seems to be a greater validity in the third place, Acts 12.15. When S.
Peter stood knocking at the door, the maid perceiving by the voice that it
was S. Peter, for joy opened not, but ran in to tell them: thou art mad, said
they: it is not he, it is his Angel. Peradventure they might understand it of
a created Angel, yet not of one that was appointed to him from his first
entrance into the world; but of one that God sent to him to comfort him while
he was in prison, to deliver him, Verse. 11.

Yet for all that, it can hardly sink into my head, that they should be so
fond as to imagine that an Angel would stand knocking at the door. Therefore
it might be translated, a Messenger: as Luke 7.24. When the messengers of John
were departed, (...): so here, it is not he, it is the Messenger, that uses to
come to us now and then, and with whose voice thou and we are well acquainted.
If Lazarus had a special Angel, me thinks that should have carried his soul
to heaven: yet not one, but many Angels did it. Nevertheless for mine own
part, I will not be contentious. I see no inconvenience in Zanchies opinion,
but much comfort rather, if it had pregnant proof out of the written word: but
let us sapere ad sobrietatem, be wise to sobriety. Calvin himself in his
instit. leaves it doubtful. Let it be sufficient for us, that we are come to
an inumerable company of Angels, that have the charge aad protection of us by
the appointment of God Almighty. Shall such a man as I flee, said Nehemiah?
Shall we fear, that have God and his Angels to protect us? Neh. 6.11.
There be a great company of devils: but these holy Angels, and Christ our
Captain will defend us from them all.

VERSE 23.
THE next person to whom we are come, is the Church it self. Where three
points are offered to us. 1. Vniversalitas, the Universality of it. 2.
Dignitas, the Dignity of it. 3. Stabilitas, the Stabilitie of it.

For the Universality: we are come to the general assembly: (...) of (...),
omnes congrego: when as an whole Nation is gathered together, as it was in
Greece at the games of Olympus, and other solemnities. In honor whereof,
Isocrates wrote his panegyricall Oration. The Archdeacons Visitation is called
a general, but it might better be termed a special. This is a right general
assembly.

The Church is Catholic and Universal: which Saint Augustine very wittily
deduces out of the name of Adam, In Evang. Ioh. tract. 9. p. 87.
of whom came all Nations. In the Greek, it has four letters, which point
out the four parts of the world. (...). Many shall come from the East, and
West, North and South: and eat bread with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the
Kingdom of Heaven. Jerome de 42. mansionibus man's. 16. Compares the Church to
a pomegranate, for the multitude that is in it, tom. 2. The Church a long time
was shut up in Judea: which was in length scarce an 160. miles. Hier. Dardano.
We are come to the general assembly. i. to the whole number of the elect in
general. Ribera restraines this to Angels. The vulgar translation joins (...)
to the former clause, to the assembly of innumerable Angels. The Greek Copies
are repugnant to it.

This is a most excellent assembly.

1. These are particular assemblies. At an assizes all the County does not
meet: at a Parliament, there is the representative body of the Realm, not the
positive; never do all nations meet together: here shall be the elect in all
Nations. Joel 3.2. Matt. 25.32.

2. These assemblies are only of them that be now alive, and present in the
world: this shall be of all gods chosen, that have been from the beginning of
the world, and shall be to the end of it.

3. These are mixed assemblies, of good and bad: among eight there was a Cham:
among twelve there was a Judas: among seven there was a Nicolas: there shall be
none but good.

4. In these assemblies there be jarres and contentions. Act. 23. The one part
was Pharisees, the other Sadduces. At Ephesus there was a great hurly burly,
the town Clerk had much a do to pacify them: there shall be all peace and
quietness.

5. These assemblies are broken up, Ios. antiq. l. 14. c. 27.
and the place may be overthrown, as the banqueting chamber was, wherein
Herod feasted his Nobles: yet without the hurt of any. But the house fell on
Jobs children, and crushed them to pieces. This assembly shall continue for
ever and ever, and the place too. Let us all pray to GOD, that none of us all
be exempted from this general assembly, but that we may be annexed to it.

The second point is the dignity of the Church: they are the first borne.

Illyricus interprets this of the Fathers in the Old Testament, that were the
first borne, in respect of us in the New Testament.

Aquinas by the first borne understands the Apostles, that had received the
first fruits of the spirit: and they are said to be written in heaven: as the
Senators were called Patres Conscripti, Ad Ecclesiam Primitivorum, Vulg.
transl. i. to the Apostles that were in the Primitive Church. Gorr. Qui fuerunt
primi fundatores Ecclesiae post Christum. Lyra. But by the first borne
understand all the Saints, whose names are written in heaven, Luc. 10.20.
Oecum. Theoph.

Christ by a kind of excellency was the first borne: he was the only
Primogenitus, because he did primo aperire Virgineum uterum; so did no other.
Epiph. contr. haer. l. 3. tom. 2.

He is Primogenitus omnis creaturae. Col. 1.15. Primogenitus inter multos
fratres, Romans 8.29. and Primogenitus Mariae; and Vnigenitus too: for none was
borne of her but he. p. 342. init.

We also by him, and through him are the first borne, elder brothers.

Many were the dignities of the first borne.

1. He had the antecedencie. He that first opened the womb, and came first
into the universitie of the world, was senior to them all.

2. He was his Fathers strength, Genesis 49.3.

3. Naturally he was best beloved. Isaak would not divert the streams of his
love from Esau.

4. He was most precious, Mich. 6.7.

5. He had a double portion of goods, and the inheritance was wholly his.

6. He was the Lords, Exodus 13.1. Consecrated to God.

Tradunt Hebraei primogenitos functos officio Sacerdotum, and habuisse
vestimentum Sacerdotale: quo induti victimas offerebant, antequam Aaron in
Sacerdotium eligeretur. Hier. trad. Hebr. in Genesin. So must we in special
manner be consecrated to the Lord, and as so many Nazarites, serve him in
holiness and righteousness all the days of our life. Israel is my first
borne, though all the world be mine. All the world is Gods, yet we are his
first borne. What an honor is this? A noble man has many sons: the younger
may go a begging, the elder has all the land. Among us there is never a
younger brother: all elder brethren, and shall all have the inheritance of the
Kingdom of Heaven. Let us be thankful to GOD for it. Israel was his: even so
we, being Gods first borne are his, not our own: we are bought with a price,
and must glorify God in our spirits and bodies, which are his.

The third point is the Stabilitie of the Church: which are written in Heaven.
Not mentioned with the tongue, which soon vanishes; but written: Littera
scripta manet: he has written us on the palms of his hands, we are ever in
his sight. GOD needs no pen, paper, writing tables, for help of memory: but
this is spoken for our capacity. The Senators of Rome were called Patres
Conscripti, because a Register was taken of their names. A Captain sets down
the names of his soldiers in a book. So GOD Almighty to show what account he
makes of us, has our names written. Where? not in water, not in loose papers,
not in the earth, where peradventure they may be blotted out; but in heaven,
whither none of our enemies can have access to race out our names.

In what Book are our names written? not of death, but of life. Whose? the
lambs book of life. We are not in the hands of an Angel; but of CHRIST
himself. To what end? A King takes the name of one of his own subjects, to
prefer him, to make him a Lord, etc God takes our names, to prefer us to a
Kingdom.

How shall we know whether our names be written in heaven?

A posteriori, not a priori. 2 Timothy 2.19. First the Elect know Christ, Ioh.
17.3. 2. They believe in Christ, Gal. 3.26. They are plentiful in the fruits
of righteousness by Jesus Christ: they add virtue to Faith. This is (...), as
Chrysostom. terms it, 1 Cor. hom. 3. to conclude by works. I have works,
therefore I have Faith: I have Faith, therefore I have Christ: I have Christ,
therefore I have heaven. Tam certus esse debes de requie, de foelicitate, si
mandata ejus custodieris, quam certus es de perditione, si ea contempseris.
Aug. in ps. 94.


Ob. 1. Works may be hypocritical, 2. uncertain, 3. imperfect.

But being sincere, they may assure us of our salvation. A ring may be
imperfect, not fully perfected by the skill of the Artificer; it may have a
crack in it: yet it assures us of the love of him that gave it: so imperfect
works may assure us of Gods love, and of the Kingdom of Heaven too, issuing
from the root of unfeigned Faith. Therefore unfaithful doubting is excluded.
Let us make our calling and election sure by good works; then an entrance
shall be ministered unto us abundantly into the everlasting Kingdom of our
Lord and Savior JESUS CHRIST, Psalm. 37.24.

Yet we must not dormire in utramque aurem. I care not how I live, I shall be
saved. There may be a Christian assurance: but no unchristian security:
nusquam securitas, says S. Bern, in Psalm. 15. Nec in coelo, nec in paradiso,
nec in mundo. In coelo cecidit Angelus sub praesentia Divinitatis; in paradiso
cecidit Adam, in loco voluptatis: in mundo cecidit Judas, in schola Salvatoris.
Let us never be high minded, but fear, with a reverent fear all the days of
our lives. I fear all my ways, said that holy man. If you abuse this
comfortable doctrine, setting all at six and sevens, then thou art most unsure.
As ye believe in Christ, so be plentiful in the fruits of righteousness by
Jesus Christ: and as your names are in heaven, and ye look for a place in
heaven; so live as Citizens of heaven, live not as earthwormes, always
grovelling on the earth; but live as men of another world, by having your
conversation in heaven.

1 Here it is as clear as the noonday, that the Catholic Church consists
only of the elect. Notwithstanding, it is an axiom with Bellarmine, De Eccl.
mil. cap. 7.
Non solum praedestinati, sed etiam reprobi ad ecclesiam pertinent. A strange
position! indeed as Augustine distinguishes excellently well; the wicked are
Paleae inter frumentum. In domo Dei, sed non domus Dei. de bapt. cont. Donat.
l. 7. c. 12.

Cant. 4.12. CHRIST's Spouse is a Garden enclosed, a Spring shut up, and a
Fountain sealed up. Haec intelligere non audeo, nisi in sanctis and justis, de
bapt. cont. Donat. lib. 6. cap. 27. It a munitur, says Greg. ut nullus
reprobus ingrediatur. In Cant. c. 4.
Ecclesia est Templum aedificatum ex diis, quos facit, non factus Deus. Aug.
Tom. 3. Enchyr. ad Laur. c. 6. p. 172. A. Our blessed Savior affirms of the
Church, Ioh. 10.3. for it is the Church of the firstborn, whose names are
written in Heaven.

2 It is evident that the elect cannot perish; Non perit filius promissionis,
sed filius perditionis, August. De corr. and great. l. 2. cap. 9.

The third person to whom we are come, is the founder and defender of the
Church. Who is described by his nature and office. For his nature, he is God:
for his office, a Judge. The Lord chief Justice of all the world.

God is a consuming fire, Heb. 12. ult. and dare we be so bold as to come to
him? He is ignis consumens to the wicked, ignis muniens to the godly. Zach.
2.5. I, a wall of fire round about Jerusalem, to protect her from all her
enemies.

All are come to God secundum praesentiam. Whither shall I go from thy face?
Secundum potentiam: his power is over all, none can avoid it: but we are come
to him Secundum bonitatem. Happy is the people that be in such a case; blessed
are the people whose God is the Lord. He is Dominus omnium, more peculiarly he
is Deus fideliu^. The Philistims said, God is come into the Host; woe be to us;
but we are come to God, and joy with us.

Not, only to God, as he is a Father, but as he is a Judge too, yea, the Judge
of all. High and low, rich and poor; just and unjust; good and bad. Iren. l.
1. c. 9. writes of some called Gnostici, who had their name of knowledge: which
affirmed they were incomprehensibilis judicii. The Judge could not catch them
at the latter day. But he will find them out. A Writ shall be returned,
reperti sunt in baliva nostra. We must all appear either ad judicium
discretionis or damnationis, as S. August. speaks: of Absolution, being
severed from the Goats; or of condemnation.

This Judge is rather the Father, than the Son: for of him he entreats in the
next Verse. Though Christ be the sole Judge secundum executionem, John 5.22.
yet judiciaria potestas is in the whole Trinity, chiefly in the Father.

There was an unrighteous Judge, Luke 18. but this is the righteous Judge, of
the whole world, Genesis 18. These Judges are wise and learned, it is meet they
should be so. Lactantius writes of a Judge that was very learned, and set forth
diverse books: but they are all fools to him the only wise God. These Judges
are subject to partiality: for that cause the Judges of Mars street were wont
to sit in judgment in the night, that they might not be moved with the
contemplation of the party. This Judge is (...) day and night. These are
mutable: there is not a shadow of turning in him. These Judges dye: this
remains for ever and ever: this is He to whom we are come.

The name, especially the sight of a Judge, is terrible, especially to a
malefactor. The Great Men, the Kings of the Earth cry out, Apoc. 6. O ye hills,
fall on us, hide us from him that sits on the Throne. When Ahasuerus held
forth his golden Scepter, Q. Hester went boldly to him. The King of Kings has
held forth the Scepter of his favor to us, by his Son CHRIST JESUS.
Therefore we may come with all cheerfulness to him: because this Judge now
is become our Father, 1 Pet. 1.17. When Foelix did but hear Saint Paul preach
of the judgment to come, he trembled. We shall stand without trembling before
the Judge himself.

It is Gods office to judge. There is one Lawgiver, and one Judge. There be
Judges under God and the King for civil matters, and we must all judge and
try the spirits, whether they be of God or not. Of apert and manifest things we
may judge. We may call a spade a spade, a knave a knave, a drunkard a
drunkard, etc. but of secret things we may not judge. The heart is a secret
thing, judge not rashly of that: the number of GOD's elect is secret; judge not
then who shall be saved and who damned: true sanctification is a secret thing:
many may be holy without, that are not within, as the Pharisees; some holy
within, as the Kings daughter is all glorious within. If a man or woman follow
not the bent of thy bow, if he make not as great an outward show as thou, shall
he by and by be an unsanctified person? This is too great rashness. Who art
thou that judge another man's servant? Shall one fellow servants judge another?
Let us refer that to the Judge of all. Let us judge our selves thoroughly, and
we will not be such severe judges of others.

The next persons to whom we are come, are certain special members of the
Church, the Saints triumphing in heaven. These quoad essentiam are spirits; as
yet they have no bodies: quoad qualitates, they are just and perfect.

To the spirits of just men. Not to the pulling spirits in purgatory, for there
be none such. Purgatorium says Erasmus, est tertius locus, quem ignorant
catholica ecclesia. Nor to walking spirits in Church or Churchyard: they be
figmenta or ludibria: either the devises of politic Priests, or the delusions
of the devil, that lying Spirit: nor to the damned spirits in hell; they be
the spirits in heaven. Not to the Angels of whom he spoke before, but to the
souls of the godly assumed into heaven, to the spirit of Adam, Abel,
Patriarcks, Prophets, Apostles, of all that have departed in the faith of Jesus.

1 They are just: clothed, not foliis ficulneis, but with the robe of Christ's
justice and righteousness, while they were here, and now covered with the
white robe of immortality for ever. They have primam stolam, the first robe for
their souls: and they shall have the second for their bodies, in the
resurrection.

2 They are perfect. We are a perfecting; they are perfected: the body of sin
is wholly abolished, and the graces of the spirit perfected in them: perfect in
knowledge, affection, and life, without spot and wrinckle.

We must not imagine to find absolute perfection in this life. Diogenes came
with a Candle at noonday to seek for a Man: neither by Sun-light nor
Moone-light shall we find a perfect Man. Absoloms body was without blemish: so
is no Man's soul in this life. In many things we sin all. The just man falls
seven times a day. I do not utterly dislike that commendation that is so
frequent among us, Iac. 3.2.
if it were not to the disgrace of another: indeed he is a good man, a good
woman, but they have these blemishes, these imperfections: In Iul. orat. 1.
as Nazianzen observes of them that were famous among the Heathen. Solonis
(...), covetousness. Socratis (...), loving of boys: Platonis (...) gulosity:
Diogenis (...), scurrility. So may we of all Christians, they have one blemish
or other. Noah had a stain of drinking: Abraham of dissembling, David of
adultery and murder. S. Peter of denial of Christ; S. Paul and S. Barnabas of
contention. As the Psalmist says, there is none good, no not one; so there is
none perfect, no not one. If ye will have perfect men and women, ye must go to
heaven for them, there be none on the face of the earth. Nostra siqua est
humilis justitia, recta forsitan, sed non pura. The virtue that is in a just
Man, hactenus perfecta nominatur, ut ad ejus perfectionem pertineat etiam
ipsius imperfectionis and in veritate agnitio, and in humilitate confessio. S.
Aug. cont. duaes Epist. Pelag. l. 3. c. 7. Our perfection is an unfeigned
acknowledgement of our imperfection, and an humble confession of the same.

Indeed Hezekiah lying on his deathbed, as he thought, was bold to put God in
remembrance, that he had walked before him in truth, and with a perfect heart,
2 Reg. 20.3. The Seventy translate it, (...), yet in the Hebrew it is Lebab
shalom, with a peaceable heart, because there was no hypocrisy in him, but a
sincere desire to please God. Yet he came short of that perfection, which the
Law requires. There may be (...), but not (...), plenitudo, but not perfectio,
Apoc. 3.2. (...). A Weaver may fill his cloth, yet there may be defects in it.
Zachary and Elizabeth walked in all the Commandments of God without reproof.
A wonderful commendation! 1. They did not go, but walked on without ceasing.
2. Not in their own fantasies, but in Gods Commandments; not in some, but in
all, and so as they could not be reproved for it. They walked in all; yet in
all imperfectly. There is perfectio partium, and graduum. An infant has all
the parts of a man: but not the breadth and stature of a man. So they walked in
all: yet not perfectly in all: and they were (...), Quaest. ad Orthod.
unreproveable before men; but not (...), without sin before God, as Justin
Martyr fitly answers it.

S. Paul, says, Let us that be perfect- Phil. 3.15. yet Verse. 12. he professed
he was not already perfect. It is spoken, not (...), but (...), not simply and
absolutely, but comparatively. An old beaten soldier, may be said to be a
perfect warrior, in comparison of a fresh water Soldier. Or we may be said to
be perfect in voto and conatu, in desire and endeavor, tanquam viatores and
cursores, non assequutione, tanquam comprehensores. As they that run still in
the race with all cheerfulness, but have not yet attained to the gold.
Comparate, non absolute. Alas, we know in part, we believe in part: like
Grammarschollers, that learn their part every day. Epist. 132.
There was a Noble Matrone called Florentina, that wrote to Aug. to be resolved
of her doubts, presuming that he could teach her any thing. That holy man was
angry with her for it, and in the winding up of the Epistle concludes, Haec
scripsi, non ut Doctor perfectus, sed cum docendis perficiendus, not as a
perfect Doctor, as it pleases you to term me, but as one that is to be
perfected with them, that are to be taught. Let the like humility be in us all.

Hierome to Eustochium, Epist. 27. says, Hebraeam linguam ab adolescentia
summo cum sudore and labor ex part didici. She counted him a great Hebrician:
yet he says, he learned it with great sweat and labor only in part. We are
but Hebricians in part, Grecians, Latinists in part: Philosophers,
Rhetoricians, Logicians, Divines, but in part. Therefore let us be proud of
nothing. Yet a wonder it is to consider how some have passed their bounds and
limits. There was one Rontigernus Elguensis a bastard, that said he was equal
in chastity with the Virgin Mary; that is not so much to be admired. The
Gnostici avouched that they were Apostolis, and ipso Christo sapientiores,
Iren. l. 2. c. 54. The Valentinians, that they were Deo meliores. Aetius, that
he knew more of God, than he himself did, as Epiphan. reports of him.

Some of the Papists say, they can perfectly fulfill the Law of God: yea, they
can do more than the Law commands, they can do works of supererogation.
Therefore they may challenge not only a perfection, but superperfection to
themselves. This does argue that they be too highly concetied of themselves.
Plut. de profect. sens. in virt.
The young Students at their first coming to the University at Athens, seemed
to themselves to be (...), wise men: after a while, when they looked better
into themselves, (...), lovers of wisdom. In process of time, they became a
peglower (...), but verbal Rhetoricians, no soundness in them. In fine, that
they were (...), mere fools and idiots. So would it be with us in Christ's
School, if we had a true sight of our selves and our imperfections. Alas, all
that we have is imperfect, we know but in part, we love but in part, our
learning in humane sciences, in the Scriptures is but in part. Semper hic Deus
doceat, says Hierome, semper hic homo discat. This must be as a hammer to
crush in pieces the pride of us all. We may think highly of our selves for our
good actions: but the bright eye of GOD's justice beholds many blemishes in our
best actions. We are like to imperfect buildings, something is wanting. The
holiest of all are like the picture of Venus begun by Apelles, but not
perfected: like coats half made, and half unmade. Therefore there is no cause
why we should be proud of our selves. When we have done the best work of all,
let us knock on our breasts with the publican and say, o God be merciful to me
a sinner: forgive the manifold imperfections thou find in my belt actions,
and bury them in the grave of the obedience of CHRIST JESUS. Pythagoras his
friends did so admire him, that they said, (...), all the words of GOD! Laert.
(...), divinely carried by GOD, so as none can come near him. These and such
like commendations are to be abandoned. These may suffice: (...), well, wisely,
truly. Plut. de a^dit. We cannot be perfect, till we come to heaven: when we
dye, then we shall be perfected, and not before. Luke 13.32.

We are come to their spirits: but where be their bodies then?

They sleep in their graves, as in beds: but shall be wakened at the day of
judgment: then those that sleep in JESUS will GOD bring with him, and then we
shall meet with them too. Hier. de locis Hebraicis says, 1 These. 4.14.
that the footsteps of CHRIST ascending into Heaven in the Mount of Olives,
were still to be seen in his days, to signify, that as CHRIST'S body is in
Heaven, so ours also shall be there. Solus Christus intravit coelu; sed totus
Christus intrabit coelum. Bern. p. 378. B. Securi estote, caro and sanguis,
says Tertul. Vsurpastis enim coelum in Christo. The Head is in heaven, the
body shall be there: the Vine is in heaven, the branches shall be there: the
first fruits are in heaven, the second shall be there: the husband is in
heaven, the wife shall be there too. Let us provide, that our spirits first go
to heaven, where be the spirits of these just and perfect ones; and
questionless our bodies shall follow after.

VERSE 24.
THE last person to whom we are come, yet not the least, is our SAVIOR CHRIST,
by whom we have access to all the rest. Where, 1 there is nomen, his Name. 2.
Officium, his office. 3. Fructus officij, the fruit of his office.

His Name is JESUS: dulce nomen Jesus, says Bern. in Cant. Ser. 15. Mel in
ore, melos in aure, jubilus in cord: honey in the mouth, melody in the ear,
joy and exultation in the heart: Melius est mihi non esse, says August. medit.
ca. 39. quam sine Jesus esse: melius est non vivere, quam vivere sine vita. I
had rather be in hell with Jesus, then in heaven without Jesus, if it were
possible. Let us labor to have our part in Jesus.

2 For His office, he is the Mediator: there is an old covenant and a new: they
be both graphically described, Ierem. 31.31. The old covenant was this, hoc
fac, and vive, do this and live. Gal. 3.10. cursed is he that continues not
in all things written in the book of the law, to do them. This was a sour
Covenant. The new Covenant is, Creed in me, and vive, Ioh. 3.18. this is a
sweet Covenant. Moses was the Mediator of the law, Gal. 3.19. Epiphan. and
the Greek Scholiast interpret it of him: by his hands the two Tables of the
law were transmitted to the people. I have been ample in this text heretofore.
I will now bury it in silence. But Christ is the Mediator of the Gospel, the
which he has established with his own blood.

The Heretics called Melchisideciani made Melchizedec our Mediator. Epiphan.
contr. haeret. l. 2. tom. 1. Some Papists will have all the Angels and Saints
in heaven to be our Mediators together with Christ. Aquin. p. 3. q. 26. art.
1. He freely confesses that Christ is our Mediator, simpliciter and
perfective: yet the Angels and Saints also must be our Mediators dispositive
and ministerialiter. They are much beholden to this distinction of principal
and ministerial, some unskilful physicians, give one drink or one medicine
for all diseases: so these men apply this distinction of principal and
ministerial to salve up all soars among them. Christ is the Chief Head of
the Church: the Pope is a ministerial head under him. So Christ is the
principal Mediator, Angels and Saints are ministerial. Yet if a woman should
hear, she had a Chief husband, and a ministerial husband, she could hardly
endure it.

1 Timothy 2.5. One God: one Mediator. they might as well say; there is one
Principal God, but many ministerial Gods under him; as to say, there is one
Chief Mediator, and many ministerial; and he tells us, who it is: not (...),
but (...); not (...), but (...): not (...), as it is of the feminine gender,
(...); but (...). He alone, and no other. (...), The Mediator between God
and man, must be both God and man: he must have aliquid simile Deo, aliquid
simile hominibus; says Saint Aug. confess. l. 10. c. 42. That he may mediate
between them both. If he were only man, he could not go to GOD: if he were
only GOD, he could not go to man.

As for Angels, they be neither God nor men: therefore they cannot be our
Mediators. As for the Saints in heaven, they be half men; they have souls,
but as yet they have no bodies, and they are not God; therefore they cannot be
our Mediators. Nay properly to speak, the Holy Ghost, the third Person in the
glorious Trinity, cannot be our Mediator: for though he be God, yet he is
not man: much less can the Angels and Saints be our Mediators. There is but
one Mediator of the new Covenant, and that is Christ Jesus, who being GOD
above all, blessed for ever, vouchsafed likewise for our sakes to become man.

The Mediator of the new Covenant has established the Covenant with his
blood. It is Christ alone, that by the blood of hit Cross has set at peace
all things in heaven and in earth, Col. 1. Therefore he is the only Mediator
of the New Testament. No Testament is of force without the death of the
Testatour. Let them prove that any dyed for us besides Christ, and then we
will acknowledge other Mediators. As he trod the wine press alone; so he
is Mediator alone: it is sacrilege to adjoyne others to him. Therefore as he
took the pains alone, so let him have the honor alone.

Heaven indeed is opened by Christ; but we are sinners, we shall not be
admitted into it. Yes: for our sins are washed away in the blood of Christ.
Where.

1. Sanguinis larga effusio. 2. Effusi excellens utilitas.

The blood that speaks, better then that of Abel. Oecum.

1. In the Greek it is (...). Erasmus reads it (...): so does Oecum. refer
it to Abel, not to his blood. 2 Hebr. 11.4. he is said, Yet to speak. It
comes all to one reckoning.

Saint Chrysostom. reads it (...), melius: but it is (...), in the plural number.

The blood of Abel spoke well in his kind, it is meet that sin should be
avenged: but this speaks better in his kind, to the joy and comfort of us all.

1. Abel spoke on earth: this in heaven.

2. That spoke against Cain, and Elias made request against Israel, Romans 11.2.
This speaks for us all.

3. That was the blood of a mere man: this is the blood of him that was both
God and man.

4. That cried, murder, murder, my brother has murdered me: this cries, I
have been murdered and killed for my brethren.

5. That did Tsagmah, (...), clamare, send forth an hideous cry: this does
(...), speak sweetly to us: that did cry after a terrible manner; this does
speak after a more joyful manner. (...): more splendid, more significant,
more sweet and comfortable. A cry is fearful and lamentable: so is not a
voice.

6. Abels blood had no power of cleansing, this has: it washes us from our
sins. This Saint Ambrose paints out in most lively colors.

Ille vindictam clamavit, hic indulgentiam. Ille peccatum fratris accusat: hic
peccatum mundi remisit. Ille prodidit crimen, hic texit: as it is written,
Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata. Ambr. de fuga saeculi, c. 5. Blessed are they,
that are come to the sprinkling of his blood.

(...). The vulgar reads it, as if it were (...), adsanguinis aspersionem,
Hebr. 10.22. v. 19. Hebr. 9.13. Exodus 12.22. As the blood of the lamb was
sprinkled with a bunch of hysop on the door posts of the Israelites, and they
escaped the destroying Angel: so Christ's blood sprinkled on our consciences;
the devil, that Abaddon, has nothing to do with us.

Let the Papists glory of the blood of Saint Thomas: By the blood of Saint
Thomas, which he for thee did spend; grant we may go whither Thomas did
ascend. Let them magnify the blood of Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint James.
Nay, Let them magnify the blood of their Pseudomartyrs: yet we will rejoice
only in the blood of Jesus, wherewith we are washed from our sins, By which
we have an entrance into the most holy place.

O sweet Jesus that would dye for us! The Master for the servant, the Creator
for the creature; he that knew no sin, for miserable sinners! O the unmatchable
love of Jesus, that sheddest thy blood for thine enemies! Many and grievous are
our sins: more in number than the hayres of our head, as red as crimson and
skarlet: but Lord Jesus, wash them away in the blood of thy sprinkling, and
then I shall be found whiter than the snow; that I may stand without trembling
before thee at the dreadful day of judgment.

Generosus animus magis ducitur quam trahitur: a good nature will sooner be
moved with loving persuasions, than drawn with threatenings. GOD has been
more gracious to us than to them. They had the tart vinegar of Gods judgments;
we have the sweet oil of his mercy: they came to Moses that terrified them
with the curse and malediction of the Law; we are come to Jesus that comforts
us with the promises of the Gospel. Therefore our righteousness should exceed
theirs. I beseech you by the mercies of God, says S. Paul, not by the terrors
of GOD. Gods mercies have been wonderful, therefore let us serve him more
cheerfully than they have done: the love of Christ ought to constrain us. Romans
12.1.
As he has died for our sins, and shed his blood for them: so let us dye to
them continually. Let us serve him in holiness and righteousness all the
days of our life, that when this life is ended, we may reign with Christ for
ever.

They had short winter days, that were full of shadows; we have summer days:
the Son of righteousness shines forth brightly to us; they had the blood of
Goats, Lambs, Calves, Oxen, as a representation of the blood of Christ: we
have Christ's blood actually shed on the Cross for us; they saw Christ afar
off: Your Father Abraham saw my day, and was glad: we see him already offered
on the Altar of the Cross for our sins, and crucified before our eyes in the
preaching of the Gospel. Happy are the eyes that see that which we see. Many
Kings and Prophets desired to see them, and could not. Let us walk worthy of
this kindness of the Lord.

Now follows the use we are to make of it, which is double: the one negative,
that we despise not our Savior Christ, the Mediator of the New Testament; the
other affirmative, that we serve and honor him, Verse. 28.

He disswades us from despising him, by two arguments: the one from the
worthiness of the person, 25. the other from the dignity of the Gospel, the
thing it self.

VERSE 25.
FOr the caveat: he does not simply say, despise him not, but with a
watchword, look to it, the danger is great if ye do.

Christ is despised two kind of ways; openly and secretly: openly, by
refusing to hear him at all, as they in the Gospel, we will not have this
man to reign over us: How often would I have gathered you together, and ye
would not? some will not come to Church to hear CHRIST, they had rather hear
a Fiddler than hear a Preacher.

2 When as men hear, yet contemptuously: as the Pharisees did, Luke 16.14.
these are open despisers of Christ's speaking.

The other are close and secret despisers. They do not peremptorily say, they
will not come, but they make excuses for not coming: I have bought a yoke of
Oxen, says one: a Farm, says another: I have burling in hand, spinning in
hand: I have a journey to take on that day, I cannot come. This is a despising
of Christ speaking, as the word imports.

The other secret despisers are careless and negligent hearers: we will give
him the hearing, but if we were out of the Church, we would not think of it
again. They look themselves in the glass of the Word: see many spots, but
have no care to wipe them away. This is a kind of despising the voice of
Christ, and it shall be required at our hands: despise not him that speaks
any kind of way, but hear him with all reverence: He is worth the hearing.

1 He speaks vera, nothing but the truth; for he is the Truth it self.

2 Suavia, that which is sweet and comfortable to us all, sweeter than the
honey or the honey comb. Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden,
I will give you rest.

3 Vtilia, that which is profitable: he tells us of a Kingdom prepared for us.

4 Manifesta: he speaks plainly, evidenter, that any may understand him:
there be no aenigmata, no riddles in his speech.

5 Efficacia: he speaks efficaciter, powerfully, with authority: never did any
man speak, as he does.

6 Sublimia; heavenly things: therefore despise not him that speaks, but
receive the honey drops of his speeches, to the joy and comfort of you all.

Why? what though we despise him? the matter is not great? yes: there is great
danger in it. If they escaped not, who refused him, that spoke on earth, namely
Moses, yet tanquam ex divino Oraculo, which revealed the Oracles of God to them
on the earth.

They that rejected him were severely punished. The man that with an high hand
gathered sticks on the Sabbath Day contrary to the Law of Moses, was stoned.
Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, that murmured against him were swallowed up by the
earth: they that took their parts were destroyed, Number. 16.49.

Some vengeance or other will light on us, if we turn him away, and refuse him
that speaks from Heaven.

But how does Christ now speak from heaven? Surely, by the mouths of his
Ambassadors: he that hears you, hears me. Luc. 1.70. 2 Cor. 13.3.
Will ye have an experiment of Christ speaking in me? When a learned Ezra
stands up in the Pulpit to speak to the people, Christ speaks. The wicked
will reply on Christ at the day of judgment, and say, Lord when saw we thee
hungry, and gave thee no meat? So some will say, O if we might hear Christ
speaking from heaven, we will sit with reverence and hear attentively. When
any of his Stewards and Ministers speak, He speaks; therefore beware how ye
despise him that speaks. They escaped not that despised Moses's ministry,
and shall they escape that despise Christ's ministry? Many heavy judgments
will light upon the contemners of Gods Word. Manasseh though a King, was
carried into captivity for it. 2 Chronicles. 33.10. Ezekiel. 11.13.
Pelatiah died; Jerusalem that would not hear Christ when he clocked to her as
a loving Hen, heard the cry of the Romans to their destruction. If we at this
day turn away our ears from hearing Christ speaking to us from heaven, the
sword of the enemy, famine, pestilence, tedious Agewes not heard of before,
some plague or other will fall on us. If they escaped not that despised Moses,
shall they escape that despise Christ speaking from heaven?

VERSE. 26.
THE second reason is taken from the dignity of the Gospel.

Then, at the delivery of the Law, The voice of God did but shake the earth,
Exodus 19.18. Now, at the exhibition of the Gospel, It shook earth and heaven
too. The which he proves out of Hagge: where we have, 1. an Allegation of the
Text; then a Commentary on the Text.

The people mourned that the second Temple was not so glorious as the first:
GOD comforts them, promising to make it more glorious; not in sumptuous
building, but by the coming of the Messiah into it.

Before, he did shake but the earth, when the Law was given: now he will shake
heaven and earth: heaven and earth was moved with the coming of Christ when he
was borne, Herod, and all Jerusalem was shaken. Wisemen directed by a Star,
came out of the East to worship him. At the Passion of Christ, the earth
shook, the graves opened; many dead Saints came out and appeared. Heaven also
was shaken at his coming, the Angels in great multitudes came from heaven and
sung for joy at his coming: the voice of the Father was heard from heaven at
his Baptism, This is my beloved Son, etc. At the passion of Christ, the Sun in
the heaven was darkened, and drew in her face. At the Feast of Pentecost after
Christ's asscention, the Holy Ghost came from heaven: the Apostles on the sudden
spoke all languages on the earth; all Nations were shaken with the preaching of
the Gospel, which as a Trumpet from Heaven sounded in the ears of them all.

Thus the Gospel, whereof Christ is the Minister, is far more glorious than
the Law, whereof Moses was the Minister. Therefore let us take heed how we
despise him that speaks now to us from heaven.

VERSE 27.
HAving alleged the Text, he makes a Commentary of it.

Shaken: like ships tossed on the Sea. As of things that are made, as the
Tabernacle and Temple were.

Which cannot be shaken: the precious Jewels of the Gospel may remain for
ever. The ceremonial Law, with all the Rites belonging to it, is shaken: the
Gospel continues to the worlds end.

They that despised the Law were punished, though it were to continue for a
time: how much more shall they that despise the Gospel, which abides for ever?

Here the Apostle speaks of a spiritual shaking. There is one material
shaking yet behind: when as the pillars of Heaven shall be shaken, the world
shall pass away with a noise, the earth, with the works thereof, shall be
burnt up; that is a terrible shaking. We fear now to see a few trees shake;
but then Heaven and Earth shall shake. Let us shake now before CHRIST speaking
to us in the ministry of the Gospel, that we may stand without shaking before
him at the latter day.

Here we see that the Scriptures are not carelessly and negligently to be read
of us. Grandia mysteria, lie often hid in one word, but of one word in the Old
Testament Christ deriveth the resurrection. God of the living, not of the dead.
Out of the Cloud, S. Paul fetches Baptism: out of the Rock, Christ. The
Apostle here out of one word in the prophecy of Hagge, concludes the
abrogation of the Law, and the corroboration of the Gospel. Therefore let us
be circumspect in reading of the Scriptures: there is nothing idle in it, no
not (...), as S. Basil speaks: one word may be a foundation to set a goodly
building on. Therefore mark with diligence every word of the sacred Scriptures.

VERSE 28.
HEre we have the affirmative use, that we should honor him: whereunto he
exciteth us by two arguments: the one a praemio; the other a poena. 29.

Receiving a Kingdom: by expectation in this life, and possession in the life
to come.

Not a Lordship, but a Kingdom: which our Savior Christ (speaking better
things than Abel) has purchased for us with his blood.

He does not say, seeing we merit a kingdom; we are not merritors, but
receivers of it: Christ puts it into our hands, and we receive it.

What manner of Kingdom? not an earthly that may be shaken, but an heavenly:
The winds may blow down these kingdoms, the earth may shake and hurl them
down; fire may consume them; the sea devour them. God may use the men of one
kingdom, as knives, to cut the throat of another kingdom. But this is a
kingdom that cannot be shaken.

This we receive from Christ our Savior: he rewards our poor service with a
kingdom; therefore let us serve him.

Which is amplified by the efficient cause, and the formal.

The efficient is the grace of God; without the which we cannot serve him.
(...) for (...). Let us hold the grace given to us in the Gospel, that it may
be as a whet-stone to sharpen us to his service.

Then for the manner of it; it must be pleasingly; so as he may be pleased with
our service. Some serve God, and yet please him not. They give to the poor and
to the Preachers of the Word; but it is grudgingly: whereas God loves a
cheerful giver. We must so serve him, as that we may please Him.

Whereunto two things are required: shamefastness, in respect of our selves;
and reverence in regard of him.

When we look to our selves, considering what vile wretches we be, polluted
with sin in soul and body, wormes-meat, dust and ashes, then we must hang
down our heads in our bosoms for shame: we are unworthy to serve such a
Master as Christ is.

2 In respect of him, we must have reverence, because he is the high and
eternal God. We must love Christ, and reverence him too: love him as a
Savior, reverence him as a Lord and Master. Though a servant have a poor man
to his Master, yet he must reverence him: our Master is rich, Heaven and Earth
are his: therefore reverence him. Though we have a weak man to our Master, yet
we must reverence him. Christ is most strong, able to crush us in pieces with a
rod of Iron. Though he be a wicked man, yet reverence him. Christ is most holy,
no iniquity dwells in him: therefore reverence Him.

VERSE 29.
WHY? he is our kind, loving and merciful GOD: but as He is a GOD of mercy,
so of vengeance too.

GOD is ignis communiens, consumens and purgans, Mat. 3.11.
He is a preserving fire to them that serve Him aright, Zach. 2.5. He is a
consuming fire to them that rebel against him, that cast His Commandments
behind their backs. He was a consuming fire to the Israelites, when he sent
fiery Serpents among them to kill them: to the Sodomites, when He sent fire and
brimstone to destroy them: to the two Captains that went for Elias, when He
sent fire from Heaven to spoil them: He consumes, with Consumptions and
diseases, with the Pestilence, inundations of waters, with fires in many Towns.

There be two fires: the one temporal, the other eternal: He will be a
consuming fire to all impenitent sinners, 2 These. 1.8.
when they shall be with the rich Glutton in the lake, burning with fire and
brimstone for ever. Therefore let us fear this God: Kiss the Son, least, if
His wrath be kindled but a little, ye perish from the way.

We flatter our selves too much in the mercies of God. God is merciful. As a
Father pittyeth his children, etc. His mercy reaches to the heavens. Though
we be adulterers, drunkards, proud, malicious: yet God is merciful. I but as
He is demulcens Pater, so he is animadvertens judex: with an axe ready to cut
our heads. Because God does not always show Himself in the likeness of fire,
a terrible God, pouring down the coals of his wrath upon us, because he
bears with us, and does not by and by punish us for our sins; we think we
may contemn him, we may serve him as we list, any service will content him. I
but remember likewise, that our God is a consuming fire. It is long
peradventure before a fire breaks forth, it may lie lurking a great while and
not be seen: but if it begin to flame, to set upon a Town; without great
prevention it will burn up the whole Town. So God is patient, His wrath is
long a kindling: but if we provoke him too much, He will break forth as a
fire and consume us all. He is a fearful God with whom we have to deal:
therefore let us serve Him with fear and reverence, in holiness and
righteousness all our days: that we may not only avoyde this fire, but
enjoy the light of the heavenly Jerusalem for ever.

CHAP. XIII.
IN the 11th Chapter, we had a Treatise of Faith: in the 12th a Treatise of
Hope: now in this we have a Tractate of Love.

1 The delivery of certain precepts. 2. The conclusion of the Epistle.

The precepts concern the members of the Church, and the Rulers, verse 17.

For the members. 1. He persuades to that which is good. 2. He disswades from
that which is evil: verse 4. For the performance of that which is good, he
commends love to them. 1. quoad affectum: 2. quoad effectum. verse 2.3.

VERSE 1.
NOt (...), but (...), the love of the brethren or brotherhood. Of them that be
brethren in CHRIST: which have one Father, which is God, one mother, the
Church: that suck one milk out of the two dugs of the Word of God: that have
one Faith, one Savior, one Baptism, one H. Supper, one inheritance, the
kingdom of heaven. Let the love of these brethren continue. We must love all
men, as they are the glorious workmanship of God, created after Gods image:
but those especially that are His workmanship in CHRIST JESUS, renewed after
the image of the LORD JESUS. Owe nothing to any man, save love. Love a Turk, a
Jew, but especially love a Christian that embraces CHRIST truly as thou
do. There ought to be brotherly love amongst them, that as brethren
profess one Faith, one CHRIST, and one Gospel.

1 Love is the body of a Christian.

2 Love is the Seal of our election. 1 John 3.14. If thou have no love, thou
have no assurance of eternal life.

3 Love is the sauce that seasons all virtues. 1 Cor. 13. Though thou come
to Church and hear Sermons, receivest the Communion, offerest up the
sacrifice of prayer and praise, talkest never so gloriously of Religion; yet
without love, thou art but as sounding brass, etc. therefore let brotherly
love continue.

4 It is a sweet thing: therefore it is compared to the oil, powered on the
head of Aaron: it is a profitable thing, resembled to the dew of Henmon:
therefore let it continue. Psalm. 133.


Yet for all that, love is a rare bird among us; she is much in our tongue,
little in our hands: we talk of her, but we walk not according to the rule of
love. Love envyeth not. What envy is among the professors of the Gospel? If
our Neighbor be in better estate then we, we grieve at it. Love disdaineth
not. What contemning is there one of another? Love seeks not her own. Among
us every man is for himself, none regards the good of an other. Love thinks
not evil, it speaks not evil. What cursed speaking, backbiting, railing and
slandering is there among us? Love is not only cold, but in a manner dead
among us: there is more love among Turks and infidels then among Christians.
Drunkards love, there is good fellowship among them: Thieves love, they have
one purse: Adulterers love: The Devils love: A legion of Devils were in one
man: only we that profess our selves brethren in Christ, which ought
chiefly to abound in love, and be lights to others, we want love. What a
pitiful thing is this?

He does not say, let it be, let it find a footing among you, but let it abide
and continue: 1 John 4.16.
he that dwells in love, dwells in GOD; not he that has love. He does not
say, let love be as a guest among you, which tarries for a night or two, but
let him be a continuer: let him never discontinue from you.

The Scripture says, let not the Sun go down on thy wrath. We must not
keep anger with us an whole night: but we must keep love with us day and
night, continually.

Love has many enemies that seek to thrust her out of doors. Therefore we
had need to hold her, and to labor for the continuance after.

1 There is the Devil that cannot abide her. Iud. 9.23. According to his name,
he is an enemy, that sets himself against love. If he see love in a Town, he
will expel her if he can, by one means or an other.

2 He has his factors and agents in all places, that labor to break the
neck of love. Now a days they be especially two; talebearers, and wrangling
Lawyers. God took order in the law, that none should go about with tales: yet
they are too frequent in every Town, sowing the seed of dissension, and
nipping love in the head. Therefore if ye will have love continue, stop up
your ears against Talebearers: And as the North wind drives away rain; So
with an angry countenance do ye the Talebearer.

As for Lawyers, they be necessary in the Common wealth, as well as Physicians:
but as he is a bad Physician that will make work for himself; So he is a bad
Lawyer that will set men together by the ears, for the enriching of himself.
Let us take heed of all that go about to pull love from us: and let her be
continued among us.

3 There be weaknesses in our selves: we are too supercilious, too credulous,
ready on a small occasion to cast away love.

4 There are many infirmities in them whom we love: yea even in the best of
all. Now when love sees an infirmity, she must cover it, or amend it, and not
cast off a friend for an infirmity.

The Holy Ghost not without great cause made choice of this word, [ continue:]
for he knew there were many ropes to pull us from love; many that would seek
her discontinuance.

We desire the continuance of all other good things: we would be glad, that
wealth, honor, health, ease, prosperity might continue, and shall we not
seek the continuance of love, that sweetens them all to us?

Do not only love for a time, but continually. But alas, love is of little
continuance: Many have been friends, that prove enemies. Herod and Pilat were
friends, but afterward fell out: Love is fine drink, but it grows soon
sower. Some there be with Amnon, that hate more then ever they loved before. In
other things we cannot away with the Praeterperfect tense, as to say, I had
health, I had house and land, I had wealth: yet we content our selves to say,
I had love. Indeed, the time was when we loved: but now one neighbor cares
not for an other. That is a miserable alteration. Let brotherly love continue.
Let her tarry with us, so long as we our selves tarry. Let her dwell with us in
this world, that she may dwell with us, and we with her in the world to come.

VERSE 2.
THE Branches of Love are three. The first, concerns our neighbors. 2.3.
verse; the second our selves. 4.5.6. verse, the third our rulers.

Having spoken of Love in general, he shows the nature of Love, and gives us
some touchstones for the trial of it.

Yes, with all our hearts: God forbid, but that we that be Christians, should
love one an other.

I but if ye have love, let it appear by your fruits, 1 Ioh. 3.18. As Saint
James says, Show me thy faith by thy works: so show me thy love by thy
works.

1. Hospitality. He does not say, be hospital, but let the love of
hospitality continue. We are ready to forget that which as we think, is
against our profit, or is an empairing of our wealth. Now many imagine
hospitality to be so. Therefore we invent many shifts and excuses. I am
decayed in my estate, I am not so rich as I have been. I have wife and
children to provide for. I cannot give that I have to strangers. My house is
but little; my fare mean: strangers will not like of it. I but for all this,
be hospital: forget it not. These Hebr. 10.34. were spoiled of their goods:
yet he would not have them to forget hospitality.

Why? it is an honorable and commodious office: thereby some by being
hospital. He names them not, because he spoke to them that were exercised in
the Scripture. The people should be so acquainted with the Scripture, as that
the Preacher should not need to name the good men, when he speaks of their
virtues. Abraham and Lot.

(...), latuerunt, whereupon some Schoolmen have it placuerunt, whereas the
Greek can import no such thing.

Others translate it, latuerunt. Some have lien lurking, receiving strangers
into their houses. They restrain it to Lot: the plural put for the singular.
He lay lurking quietly in his house, protected from the rage of the Sodomites,
because he entertained Angels: but this is ridiculous.

(...) for (...), or (...): latebat illos: they knew them not to be Angels:
they took them to be mere men, as they themselves were; yet they received
them.

1. How were they Angels, when as one of them is called Jehovah, and the Judge
of the world? One of the three was GOD, the other two were Angels.

2. If they thought them to be men, not Angels; why then did they worship them?
It was but a civil adoration or reverence, such as Jacob gave to Esau, and
Abraham to the Shechemits.

They did not dream that they were Angels: they were persuaded that they were
but men, yet they entertained them. Which amplifies their fact. If a great Lord
come to thine house, like a Lord, and thou take him into thine house, it is no
mervaile: but if he come in a beggars weed, and yet thou receive him, that is
laudable. These were Angels, Lords of Gods privy Council: yet they came like
men; for all that Abraham and Lot entertained them, and were glad of them. See
how GOD honored their hospitality. Let us do the like, that God may bless
and honor us.

In hospitality these things are required. 1. That we do it frequenter. One
swallow makes not a spring. The receiving of a stranger once makes not an
hospital man. We must make a daily use and occupation of it. It was the
continual practice of Lot and Abraham, as may appear by their behavior.

2. It must be celeriter: we must not tarry till strangers offer themselves:
we must pull them in, as Abraham and Lot did. We must constrain them, as
Lydia did S. Paul and Silas.

3. Hilariter: without grudging, 1 Pet. 4.9. we must not repine at it, speak
hardly of them when they be gone.

Luc. 1.43.
4. Humiliter: not receive them after a stately and Lordlike manner, but after a
meek manner: as if we wear rather beholden to them, then they to us. They be
the brethren of Christ, the sons of GOD: we are not worthy of such guests.

5. Abundanter: according to that ability wherewith God has blessed us. If
we have but a little, let them have a little, as the widow of Sarepta dealt
with Elias. If we have a great portion of Gods blessings, let them taste of them.

6. We must do it perseveranter: be not weary of well doing. Hospitality is
a good thing, be not weary of it. Let thy house be open to good men all the
days of thy life. But alas, this is an hard doctrine, who can abide it? we
are too much wedded to the world: yea, they that make a great show of
Christianity, are ready to say with Nabal, shall I take my bread and my water,
and my flesh, 1 Samuel 25.11.
and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be? O forget not this duty.
Here he means such strangers especially, as are compelled to forsake their
country for the Gospels sake: but it is to be extended to all.

It is an excellent duty: and we have many spurs to prick us to it.

1. God requires it. Isai. 58.7.

2. We have many examples for it.

3. We our selves may be strangers: therefore do as ye would be done to.

4. The want of it has been grievously punished: it was the overthrow of an
whole tribe. Iud. 20.

5. In receiving men that be strangers, we may receive Angels: Preachers which
be Gods Angels, nay, Christ himself: Matt. 25.6.

6. It is gainefull for this life, and that which is to come. Abraham had a
Son straight after the entertainment of his strangers. Lot was delivered
from the destruction of Sodom. God blessed the house of Obed Edom: and he will
bless those houses that receive strangers. Therefore be not forgetful to
lodge strangers, receive them into your houses in this life, that CHRIST may
receive you into the house made without hands in the life to come.

That may suffice for the entertainment of forrainers: now follows our usage
of them that be at home with us: they are either in bondage, or at liberty.

Out of sight, out of mind. These were enclosed in the prison walls: therefore
he says, remember. Though they be a good way from you, yet remember them.

There be 2. kinds of bondmen: Vincti Jesus Christi, and diaboli: Some are in
bonds for righteousness sake; some for unrighteousness: some for the Gospel,
some for theft, murder, treason, Act. 28.20. Gal. 6.10.
gross and notorious vices. For the hope of Israel, says Saint Paul, Am I
bound with this chain. Some are in bonds for Popery, Anabapt. for sects and
schisms. All are to be remembered, as occasion serves: though they be in bonds
for evil causes, yet let us in some sort remember them. Let us go to them, if
opportunity serve, and give them good counsel. Let us labor to bring them
to a sight of their sins, and so make them Christ's freemen: that is a
worthy work. A thief was converted at the gallows: therefore there is hope
of doing them good in the prison. A blessed thing to save such a soul.

But especially if any are in bonds for the Gospel, let us be mindful of
them: Let us repair to them personally, if we can, and not be ashamed of
them, if that be not permitted, as it is not by the Papists, who are more
cruel then Nero himself: for under him Saint Paul, when he was at Rome, had
all his acquaintance to come to him, and were not forbidden. Yet if we cannot
do that, let us send relief to them, as Onesiphorus did to S. Paul. Let us
speak for them, 2 Timothy 1.16. Mat. 27.19. Acts 23.25.
as Pilats wife did for Christ. Let us write for them, as Lysias did for Paul.
If none of these lie in our power, at the least let us pray for them. All the
Tyrants in the world cannot hold us from that, at the least in heart to commend
them to the LORD. When S. Peter was in prison, Acts 12.5.
Earnest prayer was made of the Church for him. Let us pray earnestly for them
that be in prison, for the profession of the Gospel. Though there be none in
England in these happy days of prosperity; yet there be Christians in bonds in
Turkey, in the unholy-house of Rome, and such like places. Let us remember them
to the GOD of Heaven. If we were in prison, we would be glad to be remembered;
so let us remember others. But alas, we hear often the lamentable cry of poor
prisoners, and it pierces us not: like Pharaoh's Butler, we forget the
affliction and imprisonment of Joseph.

And them that are evilly entreated: namely, in the body, as appears by that
which follows: whether they are afflicted with poverty, with want of meat,
drink, cloth, and other comforts, or with sickness that puts them to much
pain; let us remember them, as being our selves also in the body: that may
well be supplied. Some supply the word afflicted. Others interpret it of the
Mystical Body, as being of the same body that they are of. Some understand
(...): but that is boldness.

The words may be taken as they be, 2 Cor. 5.6. Being in the body, subject to
like calamities that they be. They are poor, so we may be. They are sick, so
may we be. The nail in the wheel that a while ago was aloft, is now below in
the mire and dirt: so we that are now at liberty, and enjoy prosperity, may on
the turning of an hand be evilly entreated.

This is the reason why we are so little affected with the miseries of our
brethren; because we post light by it: What is that to us, said the Chief
Priests and Elders to Judas?

So when one tells us, such an one in the Town wants bread for him and his
children, What is that to us? Such a family is grievously visited, the man,
wife, and children, are all down at once: I am well, a fly for it. Thou have
no charter of thy health: what a shame is this? Who is weak, says S. Paul,
and I am not weak? So we should say, who is poor? who is sick in all the
Town, and I am not sick? If the gout be in the feet, shall the head say, what
is that to me? if the head ache, shall the foot say, what is that to me? The
affliction of our brethren, should be our affliction. Let us in pity remember
one another, that GOD in mercy may remember us all.

VERSE 4.
IN the former Verses the Apostle has commended three virtues to us: charity,
hospitality, pity, and compassion over the afflicted. In this Verse he comes
to the fourth, which is chastity: showing the means whereby we may keep our
selves chaste, and the judgment of God against all unchaste persons.

So that this Verse divides it self into two parts: 1. A commendation of
marriage. 2. A condemnation of all unclean persons, that neglect or violate
marriage. In the former, first the estate is commended, secondly the bed is
defended. The commendation of the estate is in these words, marriage is
honorable in all: where three points are to be considered. 1. The subject, what
marriage is: 2. The attribute, why it is called honorable. 3. The persons among
whom it is Honorable. Marriage has three names in the Latin Tongue: Nuptiae a
nubendo; because at the solemnization of the marriage the married parties, in
token of modesty, were wont to be covered; Conjugium a conjungendo, of the
joining of them together: matrimonium, quod a matre nomen accepit; either quasi
matris munium, the office of the mother, because the mother is most occupied
about the children when they be young: or quasi matrem muniens; marriage is a
defense to the woman, she gets a husband that is a veil to her eyes; or quasi
matrem monens, putting the woman in mind of her duty to her husband and
children.

It may be thus defined. Marriage is a copulation of one man and woman together,
for GOD's glory and the comfort of them both.

The first man that had two wives, was a wicked man. The Patriarks Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob; sundry holy Kings, as David, and Solomon had many wives. That was
ex dispensatione, non ex institutione: howsoever, it was winked at by God, yet
it was an aberration from the first institution, ab initio non fuit sic: and if
ever there was any necessity of many wives, it was at the foundation of the
world for propagation, etc.

God might dispense with a man to have many wives: but he cannot dispense with
a woman to have many husbands, says Bellarmine, l. 1. de Sacr. Mat. c. 11. No
though there were but one woman in all the world. This is strange: may the Pope
dispense with all the ten Commandments; and shall Gods hands be tied up from
dispensing? but in very truth, by Gods appointment marriage is only between
two. There may come no more into this yoke, save two at once. God gave but one
wife to Adam, yet there were plures costae in Adamo (as Tert.) and
indefatigabiles manus in Deo: there were many ribs in Adam, and power in God to
make more wives, if it had pleased him. Mal. 2.15.


The first marriage being of GOD's own making, must be a president to us all.
Among the Turks it is lawful for a man to have as many wives as he can keep:
yet he must have but one at once with him in his house. Christians do abhor
it: we have a sharp, yet a wholesome statute against it of late in England.

Marriage then is the conjunction of a Man and Woman together after a comely and
religious manner in the public face of the congregation, that the Church for
avoiding of offense may take notice of it, and that all things may be done in
order as the Apostle speaks, this here is termed honorable.

He does not say, marriage is lawful, good: it is a convenient thing: but
honorable. Virtue is laudable, said the Philosopher: but felicity only is
honorable. This is the highest title of all: it is to be had in great price,
honor and estimation: it is honorable before God, his Saints and Angels. Some
honor it too much, as the Papists, that make a Sacrament of it. Sacramentum
hoc magnum est, Ephesians. 5. Yet the Greek word is (...): and if every Mystery
should be a Sacrament, there should not be seven, but seventy Sacraments, and
more: neither does he speak of marriage, but of the conjunction of Christ and
his Church, in that place.

We will fight against them with their own weapons. 1. As the covenant is
common; so ought all Sacraments, the Seals of the Covenant, to be common. If
marriage be a Sacrament, why is it not common to all Christians? Why do they
deny Ministers to marry? 2. Every Sacrament must be celebrated by a Minister:
Go teach all Nations, baptising them, etc. A Minister (as Bell. contendeth) is
not necessary in the celebration of marriage: the parties contracting are
sufficient. Therefore (to speak properly) it is no Sacrament: Though the
Council of Trent of late has taken some further order in it. We may not
honor marriage so far as to make a direct Sacrament of it: yet it is
honorable.

A number there be, that have exceedingly dishonored and disgraced it. Marcion
(as Epiphan. records of him) called matrimony, inventionem Diaboli, and
mulierem, ipsum opus Diaboli. Saturnius and Basilides (as Iren. lib. 1. cap.
22. writes of them) blushed not to affirm, that Nubere and generare were a
Satana. Hier. treading in Tertullian's steps, wrests some sentences of Saint
Paul to the disgrace of marriage. Saint Paul says, Melius est nubere quam uri.
A goodly commendation! As if a man should say, it is better to have a lame leg,
than none at all. Melius semper comparationem deterioris respicit. That is not
so: it is better to take Physic, than to live in pain: is it therefore evil
to take physic? So it is better to marry than to burn; is it therefore evil
to marry? Let them all say what they will, marriage is honorable, and to be
honored by us all.

1 It was instituted by the most honorable person, that ever was, namely, by
GOD Almighty: he saw it was not good for man to be alone: therefore He
provided an helper for him: He cast him into a deep sleep, took a rib out
of his side, of it he made a woman, and brought her to the Man.

2 It was ordained in the most honorable place that ever was on the face of the
earth, namely, in Paradise, the Garden of the Lord.

3 It was appointed in the most honorable time that ever was, in the time of
innocence. Then a woman was needful for a man, much more now in the time of
corruption.

4 It was preserved in the most dangerous time that ever was: in the great
deluge that overflowed the whole World. Noah and his wife, his sons and their
wives were saved in the Arc. An argument, that GOD made a precious and
honorable account of marriage.

5 It was honored with the presence of our Savior Christ, and graced with the
first miracle that he wrought.

6 By the judgment and practice of all Nations, it is ratified to be an
honorable estate. For they that be married, in all places have the upper hand:
they have the higher room in all meetings, in the Church, and at the Table:
which argues that honorable estimation which all have of it in their hearts.

7 It has honorable effects: by it, the number of Gods elect is accomplished,
the kingdom of Heaven replenished, the Church is furnished with worthy
Preachers, that are as Gods arm to pluck up men into the Kingdom of Heaven.
The Commonwealth is provided of wise Governors, of stout Soldiers, of all
kind of estates and conditions: marriage is the pillar that upholds the world,
the seminary of Church and Commonwealth. Therefore it must needs be confessed,
to be a glorious and an honorable estate. Let none open their mouths against
it.

8 Because it is an excellent means to keep our vessels in holiness and
honor, as we are commanded, 1 These. 4.4.

And now seeing marriage is an honorable estate; let us be bold as occasion
serves, to fly to it. If thou have deflowred a virgin, that is none of thine,
as Amnon did Thamar, though it have been in thy secret chamber, the doors
fast locked up, be ashamed of it. If thou art an impure strumpet, as Iesabel
was, tyring thy head, and painting thy face to allure lovers withal, be
ashamed of it: for if thou persistest in that sin without repentance, Christ
will be ashamed of thee, when he comes in his glory with his holy Angels. In
regard thereof thou may be ashamed: but be not ashamed of marriage. This is
no sin in it self: nay, it is an honorable thing, thou need not to be
ashamed of it. When Mordecai was carried through the City with the royal
apparel on his back, with a crown set upon his head, with this Proclamation,
so shall it be done with the Man whom the King will honor, was there any cause
why he should blush at it? No, because it was an honor appointed to him by the
King. If the Lord have given unto thee a godly wife, being a man; or a wise
husband, being a woman, thou need not be ashamed of this crown which the
King of Kings has set upon thy head. We may be bold as occasion serves, to
fly to this honorable Sanctuary.

Yet let us not rush rashly and unadvisedly into this honorable estate. When
S. Peter being in the Mount, saw the external glory of his Lord, and Master,
that his face shined like to the Sun, by and by he is enamoured, in a love of
that place, and says, Master, it is good for us to be here: but the Text
witnesses, that he wist not what he said: even so a great number of rash and
heady young men, set their love upon a maid, before they have learned to love
GOD. When they are carried up, as it were, into the Mount, where the glory of
marriage is showed unto them, and by by they say in their hearts, It is good for
us to be here. But if they were rightly examined of the things appertaining to
marriage, they might take up that speech of S. Peter's, and say, We speak we
cannot tell what. Though it is a most worthy estate, yet it is not without a
godly premeditation to be undertaken: we must take a diligent view of those
spurs that put us forward to marriage. It must not be the bare satisfying of our
greedy lusts and raging affections; though a respect may be had unto them: but
the glory, that we may procure to God by it, our mighty Creator, and Merciful
Redeemer. The good that we may purchase unto the Church and Commonwealth in
that estate, must be set before our eyes. A wise choice must be made, with
great advice and deliberation of that yoke fellow which we propound to our
selves. We must not only fix our eye upon the external beauty of the body,
as Shechem did upon Dinah, because she was fair. Beauty indeed is the good
gift of God, and many godly women have had it, as Sarah, Rebeccah, Rachel,
Hester, and such like: neither is it to be contemned unless it be alone, not
accompanied with the internal beauty of Gods spirit. As it is said of the
Church, the Spouse of Christ, The Kings Daughter is all glorious within: so may
it be affirmed of a good wife, that is fit for a Christian indeed, see that she
be glorious within; see that she be of a sound and incorrupt religion, else she
may steal away thy heart from God, though thou be as wise as Solomon, and
as strong as Sampson. See that she be a wise Abigail, for the carrying of her
self; that she be a sober and modest Hester: see that she may be an other
Elizabeth, to walk with thee in all the Commandments of God without reproof.
Then when beauty shall fade away like a flower corrupted by sickness, thought,
cares, age, and such like* when riches shall decay, that are subject to a
thousand casualties, of thieves, fire, water, etc. A wise, godly, and loving
wife, shall be a perpetual comfort unto thee, and as it were a continual
feast. The Lord grant, that as he has given marriage unto us as a singular
blessing, so by our own sins it prove not a curse to any of us.

As God has made it honorable: so let not us dishonor it: neither by
disorders abroad, nor ill-government at home. What a shame is it for a
maried-man to sit at the Alehouse all the week long, that has wife and
children to provide for? It is a disgrace to a Batchelour, much more to a
maried-man. Shall a maried-man have a Queen in a corner, that has a Rebekah
of his own: For a maried-man to be a gamester, to spend all at cards and
dice? Shall a married man be absent from Church? be a swearer and a prophaner:
he gives bad example to them of his family: vul nerat non tam facto, quam
exemplo. A married man had need to be more circumspect over his ways then an
other.

2 Not by ill government at home. If the children and servants be out of
order, who shall bear the blame of it, but the householder? every man is as a
petty king in his own house: if we cannot restrain them, we may remoove
them. If they will not be brought into GODS house, send them packing out of
thine house. A deceitful person shall not dwell in my house: Psalm. 101.7. So
let us resolve, and say, a swearer, a theife, an alehouse hunter shall not
tarry in my house: especially let us not dishonor it by unnatural strifes and
contentions one with an other.

There be two things that may make marriage honorable to us. The one before
marriage: the other after. The things before, are prayer and Christian choice
of our yoke fellow. When Abraham's servant went to seek a Wife for his Masters
Son, he begun with God, LORD GOD, send me good speed this day. We ought to
enterprise nothing without prayer: much less so weighty a thing as Marriage,
which is not of a day, but for a term of life.

GOD at the first brought Eve to Adam: and He by the secret hand of His
providence brings Men and Women together at this day. If thou Marriest without
GOD, thou shall live without GOD: and that is a miserable life. Yet a number
are carried by their own affections, and never consult with God.

The other thing before Marriage is a Christian choice. There be two
loadstones for the most part that draw us to Marriage: beauty, and riches.
Beauty indeed is the gift of GOD, a precious pearl, a comely ornament, yet
this must not be a sole motive to marry. There be many worms to eat up this
goodly flower of beauty, care, sickness, the pox, old age, etc. If a man love
for beauty alone, beauty vanishing, his love vanishes. Remember what the wise
man says, Pro. 31.30. Favor is deceitful, etc.

But now a days riches is all in all. Though she be a beautiful woman adorned
with many virtues, yet she may be long enough without an husband, unless
she be penny white, as well as Nature white: unless she have the red angels
as well as ruddy cheeks. Now the question is, what has she? not, what is she?
what dowry, not what endowments of GODS Spirit? what portion, not what piety?
Judas question is too ryfe among us; we say to the Parents, quid dabis? what
will ye give with your daughter? nay the trash of the world makes men like
where they have no liking. A woeful thing! The world is not wholly to be
neglected, while men are in the world: yet the world must not be the chief or
only tyer of the knot of Marriage: then it may be soon untyed. GOD has many
bellows to blow away riches withal. A rich man over night, a fire comes on
the sudden, a poor man in the morning: when wealth is gone, that made the
Marriage, where is the love of married folks? Again, this night may thy soul
be taken from thee: then whose shall all these be that thou have gathered
together?

The things that may make this estate honorable to us after Marriage, are
likewise two. The first is the bearing of one another burden. There is no man
or woman on the earth, but have their infirmities: Saints we may be, but Angels
we are not. If ye will have perfect men and women, ye must go to heaven for
them: there are the Spirits of just and perfect men. Hebr. 12.23. The husband
must bear with the wife, the wife with the husband: else we shall dishonor
this honorable estate. The woman, they say, was borne to bear: true indeed,
to bear Children: by bearing of Children ye shall be saved: that is the
purgatory whereby she must go to heaven. But the man in some respect was made
especially to bear, vir a virtute. Man of manhood, he is of greater strength
and power: mulier quasi mollior, therefore to be borne withal.

2 Being married we must arm our selves against the crosses of Marriage. 1
Cor. 7.28.
It is (...), a sweet bitter thing. Saint Paul has read the destiny of married
folks: Such shall have trouble in the flesh. Sometimes the man is troubled with
an unkind wife, as Job was: curse God, and dye. She could be content to be rid
of him. Sometimes the woman is troubled with a churlish husband, as Abigail was
with Nabal: sometimes both are troubled with their Children, as Isaac and
Rebeccah was. I am weary of my life, for the daughters of Heth, etc. Sometimes
they are troubled with their servants. As the Psalmist says, many are the
troubles of the righteous; so may it be said in special: many are the
troubles even of righteous married folks: crosses in themselves, their goods,
and in those that belong to them.

If we have not Christian patience in some measure to bear them, we shall
dishonor this honorable estate. In stead of honorable we shall make it
onerable, burdensome to our selves and others. As God has pronounced it to be
honorable: So let us honor it with our Godly lives in this present world,
that God may honor us in the world to come.

3 As Marriage is honorable: so it is for this life alone. In the Kingdom of
Heaven there shall be nec foeminae, nec nuptiae: we shall neither marry, nor
be married, but we shall be like the Angels of heaven for ever. A wife is but
for this life, which God has made as a span long. As there is a time when we
go to the Church to be married: so there is a time when we shall be carried to
the Church or Churchyard to be buried. Though a wife be as fair as Sarah, as
virtuous as Hester, as religious as Hannah, as chaste as Susanna, though she be
never so sweet a companion; yet she is for this life alone. Therefore let us
so live together in this world, that we may live with our Husband CHRIST JESUS
in the world to come.

Now to the persons among whom it is honorable: among all: high and low, rich
and poor, Magistrate and Subjects, Ministers and people.

Among all.]

Because the adjective in the original Text may indifferently be applied
either to the masculine or neuter gender, there has been great controversy,
what substantive should be supplied. Some interpret it, Marriage is honorable
in all times, other in all ages: in all things belonging to it: in the
copulation of husband with wife, in the procreation of Children, etc. Yet
rather it is to be referred to the persons, then to the things.

1 In such an Ellipsis that is most usually understood, Romans 1.16. Heb. 12.14.

2 The circumstance of the place does require it: that as fornication and
adultery is to be avoided of all, because God will judge it: So Marriage
should be granted to all, for the eschewing of those sins which pull upon men
the Judgment of God.

So does Saint Chrysostom interpret it.

Ob. It cannot be understood of the persons: for if it be honorable among all,
then between Brother and Sister. Bellar. l. de clericis, cap. 3.

So. A very Cavil among all, that is, to whom God has allowed it in his Word.
Not amongst children, Eunuchs, etc. as, 1 Timothy 2.4. God will have all men to
be saved. Yet not wicked men persisting in their sins. All, that is, of all
conditions. So here marriage is honorable among all. 1 Cor. 7.2.
Yet not among those degrees which God has inhibited, but among all estates.

I what condition soever they be, high or low, rich or poor, Magistrate or
Subject, Minister or people, Marriage is honorable among them all: no estate,
no trade, no degree is excluded from it.

The Priests in the time of the Law were married.

The Ministers in the time of the Gospel were Married, and so continued a long
time, about four hundred years after Christ's ascension. The first that
inhibited marriage, was Siricius, four hundred years after CHRIST, as Gratian
one of the Popes chief Champions does confess. Afterward a single life with
great severity has been imposed on them. Sozom. lib. cap. 23. calls it
(...): which the Nicene Council was about to consult upon, that ministers
should not lie with their wives, which they had before their ordination. The
last Council of Trent, pronounces them to be accursed, which dare affirm
that Priests adopted already into holy orders may marry.

They confess that there is no jar between Matrimony and holy orders in
respect of the essence of marriage: Sess. 24. can. 9.
but in respect of the act of copulation, which makes a man altogether
carnal, and unfit for the execution of holy duties. But if that had been
sufficient to debar the Ministers of the Gospel of marriage, why was it
permi^ted to the Priests in the Law, which were every day in a manner to be
occupied about the Temple?

Some said of old age, avocat a rebus gerendis: So it cannot be said of
marriage, no not in ministers, avocat a Sacris gerendis. Spiridion B. of Cyprus
says, (...). Socr. l. 1 c. 11. I have a wife and children, and yet am never a
whit the worse for Divine duties. So may any Minister, I doubt not, affirm, to
whom God has given a good wife.

Thomas affirms, 2 a. 2 ae. q. 8. art. 11. that the vow of Continency annexed
to holy Orders, has no other pillar to lean upon, but the Churches decree;
and for that cause may be dispensed withal.

Durandus in a Book he made of the manner how to celebrate a Council,
contendeth by many reasons, that it were good for the ancient liberty of
marriage to be granted again, by a general Council unto the Clergy.

Lindanus thinks it were more holy and righteous.

Cardinal Cajetane affirms, that properly to speak, it cannot be prooved
neither by reason, nor authority; that a Priest should sin, if he did marry.
Platina in the lives of the Popes reports, that Pius the second himself said,
there were some reasons why marriage was taken from the Priests, but there are
more and better reasons, why it should be restored unto them. Bellarm. in his
Book that he writes of the Clergy says, that the vow of Continency
annexed to Orders, is not a mere Divine decree, yet an Apostolical decree. A
distinction without a difference: as if the Apostles being the holy men of GOD
carried by the Holy Ghost, did set down any thing, which was not Divine: and
he calls it Apostolical, not because it can be found in the writings of the
Apostles, but because it was a long time kept in the Church, since the time of
the Apostles.

Ye see then on what weak grounds it stands, even our Adversaries being
judges. But because it is not good to stand to their courtesy, we will prove
by unanswerable Arguments out of Gods Word, that Marriage is also honorable
amongst the Ministers of the Word, and that they may challenge it as well as
others.

1. That is a general license extending it self unto all. 1 Cor. 7.2. They of
the Clergy are subject to be entangled with the sweet bait of concupiscence,
as they of the Laity, unless GOD sustain them with the hand of his Spirit.
The Roman Clergy ministers to us too many examples. One John a Cardinal
sent from the Pope to ratify the condemnation of Priests marriages, the very
next night was taken in bed with an whore. So was D. Weston the Prelate in Q.
Mary's days, and sundry others: had it not been better for them to have
married?

2. If the having of a wife, the wise government of her, his children and
family be a note, whereby a Minister must be tried; then it is lawful for him
to have one.

But this is one special note, 1 Timothy 3.4. and 5. Tit. 1.6.

Ob. 1. Calixtus expounds it thus, The husband of one wife.i. of one Church.

Resp. Why then have some of them ten, twelve, or twenty Churches? A
ridiculous Allegory. For the Apostle speaks of a natural wife, of whom he
begets children; not a spiritual wife, as the Church is.

Ob. 2. Saint Jerome expounds it in the Praeterperfect tense, which was the
husband of one wife, not which is.

So. So we may say of the rest, such a one must be chosen, which was sober,
which was modest, which was apt to teach.

2. Tit. 1.6. The Verb of the Present tense is plainly expressed.

Ob. 3. Bell. Soul, that Saint Paul does not make a law, that a Bishop should
have a wife: but that he forbids him to have more wives then one.

So. But if it had not been his meaning to permit a Bishop a wife, why does
he make mention of his wisdom in the education of his children? unless he
should have children without a wife, as the Pope and his Clergy sometime have
had, if their own Authors say true.

3. If it be lawful for a Minister to demand maintenance at the charges of
the Church, for the keeping a wife, then may he lawfully have a wife.

But it is lawful: as Saint Paul disputes by many reasons. 1 Cor. 9.4.
Who goes a warfare at his own charges? what shepherd does not live of his
flock? why should not the spiritual Shepherd of the soul be maintained,
himself, his wife, and children, by the sheep whom he feeds?

Ob. This is to be referred to those women which served the Apostles of
necessaries, as certain wealthy women following Christ, ministering unto him of
their own substance, Luc. 8.3.

So. 1. It cannot be understood of them.

They were wealthy, more able to give then to receive: but it is the drift of
Saint Paul in that place to prove, that he might lead about such a woman, as
should be maintained by the Church.

2. Having put the name of Sister in the first place (for so the words are to
be translated according to the Greek, not as it is in our English Bibles.) He
adds the name of Wife in the next place, to show what manner of sister he
meant: not any common woman, but a wife. It were ridiculous, thus to translate
it: Have we not power to lead about a sister, a woman? as if there were a
sister, that were not a woman.

3. Those women were wont to follow the Apostles of their own accords: they
were not carried. The Greek word imports that right, which the husband has
over the wife to carry her about with him.

4. Clemens Alexandr. as Eusebius. reports, l. 3. c. 35. does interpret this
place, of the Apostles wives.

4. All the Apostles were married. All save two at the most, Saint Paul, and
Saint John. Saint Philip also the Evangelist was married, for he had four
daughters, that were Prophetesses, Act. 21.9.

Sundry might be alleged in the Ecclesiastical histories.

Gratian and Platina both reckon up many Popes, whose Fathers were married
Priests, as Boniface the first. Felix 3. Gelasius the 5. and others: yet he
says, they were not borne in fornication, but in lawful marriage. One
exception they have, that they were married before they had taken Orders, not
since, and that afterward they lay not with their wives.

But how prove they that? The Apostles indeed forsook all, and followed
Christ: but it is like, they left their wives no more then they did their
goods: rather affectu then effectu, as one speaks: for Matthew retained his
house still, and made Christ a great feast in it. Luc. 5.39. John 19.27. it is
not like they would keep their houses, and not their wives.

2. Saint Paul affirms, 1 Cor. 9.4. That the brethren of the Lord, and Peter
did then lead about their wives, when they had long since taken holy Orders:
and he prooveth, that he himself being then in holy Orders has authority to
do the like.

3. If the High Priest in the time of the law after he was anointed with the
holy oil might marry: then Ministers now after they be in Orders may marry:
for greater sanctity was required in the High Priest being a type of CHRIST,
then the Ministers of the Gospel: but he after he was consecrated might
marry. Levit. 21.10. and 13. A virgin he might marry, but not a widow.
Wherefore let the Ministers of the Word as just occasion is ministered unto
them, take upon them this estate, which the Lord pronounces to be honorable
among all* and let us heartily give thanks to GOD for this happy reign of our
gracious Sovereigne, wherein we may safely enjoy the liberty which GOD has
left unto us in his Word.

Here a Question may be demanded, whether it be honorable among them that
marry the second, third, or fourth time, etc.

As for the first marriage all confess, except it be the Tatians, Eustathians,
Eucratitae, that this is lawful. The Papists do not condemn second
marriages, yet they count them not so honorable as the first, for they
subtract benediction, and blessing from them. Tertullian writing to his wife,
persuades her not to marry again the second time: but in his Book de
monogamia he shows himself plainly in his colors, and is very bitter
against second marriages: his principal reasons are as weak as water.

1. Vnum matrimonium novimus, sicut unum Deum.

A strange reason? God lives ever: therefore there needs but one God: a wife
lives not ever, but dies; therefore there is no necessity of one wife: when
one is dead, in the fear of God we may take an other.

2. It is not good for man to be alone: Faciamus ei adjutorium: adjutores
dixisset, si eum pluribus uxoribus destinasset.

There was but one man then in all the world: therefore one helper would
suffice him. 2. This is spoken of a wife in general, not of the first wife
alone: every woman successively is an helper: the second, third, or fourth, is
an helper. God provided but one helper at once; yet successively he may have
many helpers.

3. They that be of Faith are Abraham's children. Now when Abraham believed God,
and it was imputed to him for righteousness, he was monogamus and
praepatiatus: therefore they that be Abraham's children, must be Monogami.
Recipe digamiam, admit and Circumcisionem.

1. Abraham believed God, after he was married to Keturah his second wife, as
well as he did, when he had Sarah his first wife: therefore digami may be
Abraham's children, as well as monogami. 2. Circumcision and a second wife are
not relatives: for Abraham was circumcised, when he had his first wife. Then
they that have but one wife must also be circumcised.

4. Joseph had but one wife: and hoc nomine audeo dicere patre meliorem. Aaron
and Joshua had but one wife: Anna one husband. Saint Peter one wife.

We may oppose many holy men to them that have had two wives.

5. Christ supped at the first marriage: not at a second.

Whether it was the first or second, is not expressed. All the acts that CHRIST
did, are not recorded, he might afford his presence to a second marriage.

6. This was the Institution of Matrimony, they twain shall be one flesh: A
second wife is aliena Caro: and a second marriage is adultery.

The first twain are one flesh: so are the second twain, and the third twain.

7. We must be as innocent as doves. A dove has but one mate.

He speaks there of a woman, 1 Cor. 7.39.
whose first husband was an heathen, he would not have her to marry a heathen
again: if she married a Christian, he should be as her first husband,
because the former being an infidel was as no husband.

8. 1 Timothy 3.2. A Bishop must be blameless, the husband of one wife, etc.

This ties all Christians, as the other, to rule the house well, to be no
strikers, no evil speakers, not to be given to wine: to be the husband of one
wife at once: for Polygamie began at that time to be frequent in Asia.

Howsoever some have unadvisedly declamed against them, the Scripture allows
second marriages, 1 Cor. 7.39. Loquitur indefinite, says Saint Augustine, de
bono viduit. ca. 12. he does not say, if her first husband, but husband,
whether first, second or third, etc. 1 Timothy 5.11.14. Younger widows S. Paul
would not have to be admitted to office in the Church, because they might
marry: and he wishes them to marry and bear children. Our Savior CHRIST,
John 4.18. reprooveth the woman of Samaria for keeping a paramour instead of an
husband, but he does not check her for having had five husbands. Hierome de
monogamia, makes mention of a man that had buried twenty wives, and of a woman
that had two and twenty husbands. No question, but all marriages are lawful:
yet as Saint Paul says, all things are lawful, but all things are not
expedient. There is more inconveniency in regard of diversity of children, of
the diverse disposition of sundry wives and husbands, etc. in the second
marriages, then in the first: therefore greater care, wisdom, circumspection,
is to be used in them. Yet as God has ordained marriage for all, so all may
fly to it. Notwithstanding, because the time is short (as the Apostle
speaks) contracted into a more narrow room than it was before; Let them that
have wives be as if they had none. Let us use this world, as if we used it not:
for the glory and pleasure thereof fades away.

So much of the estate. Now let us come to the bed, and use of marriage. The
estate peradventure is honorable; but the bed is dishonorable: nay, says the
Holy Ghost. Bell. l. 1. de Sac. Bapt. c. 5. says, there is turpitudo and
immundities in the act of marriage, abusing that place, Apoc. 14.4. Where it is
apparent the Spirit of God metaphorically calls all the Elect Virgins, that
shall triumph with the Lamb in the life to come. Otherwise no married persons
should be in Heaven. Men may be defiled with women that be Harlots: but not
with an holy and religious use of their wives.

And the bed undefiled.]

Either the Verb substantive may be supplied in the midst of the sentence,
and then the sense runs thus, And the bed is undefiled, meaning the marriage
bed: it is no polluted bed, as the bed of adulterers and fornicators is: it is
no polluted thing: or else the beginning of the Verse must be repeated, and bed
undefiled is honorable: whereunto I do rather lean, because such repetitions
are usual.

It is a profitable caveat to married folks, instructing them how to behave
themselves in the bed of marriage.

They are so at all times and in all places to carry themselves, as that no
dishonesty be admitted into that honorable estate: nothing that is repugnant
to the Law of nature, or Christian modesty is to be committed.

No doubt, but that a great liberty is permitted to them that be married: they
may have their lawful sports and honest recreations one with another. Isaac
sported with Rebeccah, neither did he incur any just reprehension for it. Genesis
26.8.
If he had thought he had been in the sight of Abimelech, he would not then
have showed such familiar tokens of love: yet wheresoever they be, they must
do nothing, but that which may be warrantable by the Law of Nature, and the
Word written.

As the Psalmist speaks, Whither shall I go from thy presence? If I climb
up into heaven, thou art there, etc. So all married persons may say within
themselves, in the midst of all their delights: Whither shall I go from thy
presence? If I walk abroad with my wife into the fields and pleasant pastures,
thou art there: if I sit with her at the Table, or by the fire side, thou art
there: if I be with her in my chamber and bed, thou art there: therefore I will
do nothing in this estate which may be displeasing in thy sight. This is the
bed undefiled, that is honorable and well-pleasing unto the Lord. God grant it
may be so among us all.

The bed it self is undefiled. As they be put together in the Church: so they
may meet together in the bed, for the procreation of children, that may be
mutual comforts to them both, and may be as Olive branches round about their
Table: which may be profitable members both in Church and Commonwealth, and
Citizens of Heaven. Yet let them take heed they be not drowned in the pleasures
of marriage. Let them not say with him in the Gospel, I have married a wife,
therefore I cannot come. I cannot pray, hear sermons, read the Scriptures,
etc. A wife is appointed as an helper to further thee to Heaven, not as an
hinderer to keep thee out of Heaven.

That may suffice for the commendation of marriage: now to the condemnation of
all unclean persons, that neglect or violate marriage.

Whoremongers.]

Graec. fornicators: when either the one or both parties be unmaried; then it
is either simple or joint fornication.

The Greek word is derived of the verb (...), which signifies, to sell: such
as sell their bodies, as victuallers do their meat: so do fornicators.

They make a sail of their bodies from Christ, unto whom it is due, unto an
harlot that has no interest in it.

Adulterers.]

The filthiness committed between married persons, which is more detestable.

GOD.]

Which is the Lord of Hosts, having all creatures in Heaven and Earth to be his
executioners, whenever it pleases him. Though the Magistrate be negligent in
punishing of them: yet GOD will judge them.

Judge.]

That is, metonymically, he will punish; the cause being put for the effect.

There is a [but] against them. Justice is good: but unjust dealing is naught.
So marriage is honorable, but fornication and adultery is abominable.

What need I have a wife of mine own, when I may borrow of another man? I but
Whoremongers and Adulterers GOD will judge.

GOD judges them sundry kind of ways, in this life, and in the life to come.
In this life, 1. His judgment is on their souls, which are translated from
GOD to the Devil: Wine and adultery take away the heart: Hos. 4.11.
the heart of an adulterer is more on his Harlot, than on God: and that is a
fearful judgment. A covetous man makes his money his God: and an adulterer
makes his queen his God.

2 His judgment is on their bodies: fornicatio quasi formae necatio: many
loathsome diseases are on them, as the French Pox, consumptions, etc. Men are
afraid to drink of their cups, and their bodies many times wast and consume
away.

Prove. 29.3.
3 On their goods: the sin of Adultery has brought many a rich man to
beggary. The prodigal Child quickly wasted his goods on harlots: they be as
sponges to drink up a man's wealth: their riches melt as wax.

4 On their good names: they be odious to all men. Yea, one Adulterer will
speak ill of another, and upbraid one another by this sin: Genesis 34. ult. Deuteronomy.
23.18.
one principal thing that the Orator cast in Catelins dish was, his beastly
and incestuous life, Cane pejus and angue.

5 On their children. Sometimes they be fools and idiots; sometimes lame in
their hands, in their feet. In ancient times they might bear no office in
Church or Commonwealth. Sometimes they are taken away by an untimely death, as
David's child was, which he begat of Vriahs wife; they cannot inherit the Lands
of their Fathers. One way or other the brand of Gods wrath is on their
posterity.

So that the truth of this sentence may be apparent to us all. GOD will judge.
Yea, though there be never so great men in the world, against whom the sword
of man's authority cannot easily be drawn forth: yet GOD will be sure to meet
with them. Amnon was a Kings Son; yet because he defiled his sister, GOD slew
him, and he was slain at a banquet, when his heart was merry with wine, and
did not so much as dream of death: when he had little time to repent him of
his wicked life. Absalom was heir apparent to the Crown; nay for the time he
was King, having put down his father: yet because he had played the incestuous
beast, the Lord in justice caused him to be hanged by his own hair, and so he
dyed miserably. Iesabel was a Queen, yet because her adulteries were in great
number, she was cast out of a window and eaten with dogs. Whole Cities have
been destroyed for it: as Sodom and Gomorah with those adjoining to it. All
the males in Shechem were put to the sword for ravishng one maid. The wrong
offered to one woman was almost the utter overthrow of the whole Tribe of
Benjamin. Therefore let us tremble at this sentence. Though men judge them not,
yet God will judge them: though the Judge of the Assizes will not punish them:
though for a little money they may escape in the Courts; yet the Judge of the
World will punish them severely. If for some causes best known to himself,
they escape his fingers in this world: yet they shall feel the heavy hand of
his indignation in the world to come. This ye know: all that be in the School
of Christ know this, Ephesians. 5.5.
that no whoremonger, wanton, buggerer, shall inherit the kingdom of GOD.
Without the gates of heavenly Jerusalem, are Dogs, Enchanters, Whoremongers,
Liars. A terrible sin, that excludes us out of Heaven. Therefore let us all
beware of it. It is a sweet sin to the flesh, but God has provided sour
sauce for it: therefore let it be detested by us all. If we feel the fire of
lust burning in us, let us not sit at the wine, go to an whore or harlot; that
will but increase the fire, and make us fit matter for the fire of hell. But
let us fast and pray, or let us fly to marriage for the quenching of it: for
the avoiding of fornication, let every man have his wife, -- Marriage is
honorable among all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers
God will judge.

Demosthenes went to Lais the strumpet for a nights-lodging: she asked ten
thousand drachmes: nay soft, says Demosthenes, nolo tanti emere poenitere. So
if an harlot say to us, as Potiphars wife to Joseph, Come lie with me, etc. Let
us abhor it and say, I will not buy repentance so dear. We shall one day
repent us for it; either to our grief or amendment in this life, or to our
condemnation in the life to come.

The Sodomites burned in Lust one toward another: now they burn in hell fire:
They suffer the vengeance of eternal fire, as S. Jude speaks. A full sin
that banishes us out of Heaven. Plutarch makes mention of a certain King named
Lysimachus, that being exceeding dry, sold his Kingdom for a draught of water:
after he cries out, (...); heu, pro quam exigua voluptate regnum perdidi; so
may the adulterer say, for what a little pleasure have I lost the Kingdom of
Heaven!

VERSE 5.
1 AN admonition; 2. The reason: the admonition consists of a dehortation from
covetousness: and the prescription of a remedy against it.

He does not say, be ye without covetousness, but let your conversation, all
your manners, behavior, and actions, be void of covetousness.

Without the love of silver, a part put for the whole.

Whatsoever some men do, it smells of covetousness; their buying and selling,
all the bargains they make, all the journeyes they take, all the words that
issue out of their mouths: the clothes on their backs, the meat they put in
their belly, all savours of covetousness. Any commodity they have, they will
sell dear; they will buy cheap: they will watch poor men, whom necessity
constraines to sell, and they will have it of them for little or nothing. They
will go meanly, fare hardly: all that they do has a sent of covetousness.
Therefore says he, so converse among your neighbors, that all may see, that
the world is not the principal mark ye aim at: buy and sell without
covetousness. Let your house keeping be without covetousness. Let your talk
and speeches be without covetousness. Pay the Minister his due, without
covetousness. Let covetousness be banished from all your actions.

1 It is the root of all evil: ye cannot abide bitter roots, in your Gardens:
no root is so bitter as covetousness: and it will draw all evil after it. A
covetous man will lie, swear, steal, kill for money: therefore root it out of
the garden of your hearts.

2 It excludes men by name out of the Kingdom of Heaven 1 Cor. 6.10. That is
provided for liberal men, that cloth the naked, feed the hungry, relieve the
oppressed, etc. Not for greedy covetous misers, that do no good with their
wealth.

Ephesians. 53.
3 It ought not once to be named among us. When we speak of filthy and uncomely
things, we do it with a preface, saving your reverence, etc. So when thou
speak of Nabal say, there is such an one, saving your reverence, a covetous
man: it should not be named, much less practiced by us that be Christians.

Jude 18.24.
4 Covetousness is idolatry. A covetous man makes an Idol of his money. If the
Idolaters Idol be gone, all is gone: What have I m^re, said Michah? So if his
money be gone, his god is gone. An Idolater makes a strong Chapel to put his
Idol in: a covetous man makes a strong Chest to put his money in. O spare my
Idol, says Idolater. O spare my money, says the covetous man, my back and
belly shall be pinched ere I will lay out my money, an Idol is the Idolaters
Master. Baal of Bagnal, dominari: so money is the covetous man's master:
therefore let covetousness be abhorred by us all. We are in the world: but
we are not of the world: we are men of another world, Citizens of heaven;
therefore let us not be drowned in the world. But alas, covetousnes spreads her
self far and wide: the world eats up the Word: we are all for this world,
nothing in a manner for the world to come. Our whole conversation is stained
with covetousness.

A remedy against it, is a contented mind; And be content with such things as
you have; with those things that be present. As for that which is past, it
cannot be recovered; it is a folly to grieve for it: as for that which is to
come, it is uncertain: uncertain whether we shall get it, how long we shall
keep it: therefore be content with that, etc.

The cause of covetousness is a discontented mind. None is content with that
which he has: If he have an hundred pounds, he would have two: If two
hundred; then five hundred: If five hundred; then a thousand: If a thousand,
then ten thousand, etc. and so ininfinitum: there is no hoe, no stay. If a man
have one house, he would have another: If two or three, then an whole Town: If
one Town, then many: Nay an whole Country. If he be a Gentleman, he would be
a Knight, a Lord, etc. Nay if he have one kingdom, he must have many: If he
have the whole world, he will dig for more, as Alexander did. No man is content
with his estate. Hence arises covetousness in us all. How mean soever our
condition be, let us be content with it. We are worthy of nothing: not of a
drop of drink, of a morsel of bread, or of a ragge to cover us withal. If we
have never so little, let us be thankful to GOD for it. What if thou had
never so much? thou can carry nothing away with thee, but a winding sheer, or
a coffin: therefore let us rest contented with that portion GOD allotteth to
us. Esau could say, Genesis 33.9.
I have enough: none of us can say so: we are worse then Esau. Let us praise
GOD for the meanest estate, and refer our selves to His wisdom and
goodness, Acts 2.46.

The reasons are two: the one taken from Gods part: the other from our part.

Ipse dixit, the Lord; the high and eternal God: Ipse dixit was a sufficient
proof with the Pythagoreans: and shall it not be with Christians? If God has
said it, let us require no more.

This was spoken to Joshua: but in him to us all. Josh. 1.3.
That which was spoken to the Captain of the people, was spoken to the whole
people, and so consequently to the whole Church in all ages. Whatsoever things
are written, are for our learning. God did not forsake Joshua, He always
ministered to all his necessities, He stood by him in all battles, He protected
him from all enemies. So He will not forsake us. What makes a man covetous,
greedy of the world, but a fear that God will not provide for him. Why? He
has said, He will not forsake us: therefore let us believe Him. Though all
friends fail, fathers and mothers forsake us: yet then God will take us up.
Let Him be our pillar for us to lean upon: He will feed us with food
convenient, and of the hidden Manna, etc.

He gave Joshua not only things necessary, but many glorious and honorable
victories: and shall he not give us that which is requisite? He can do it: the
earth is His, and the fulness thereof. He will do it: we are as the apple of
his eye. Will that child macerate himself with care, that has a rich and
loving father to provide for him? God pittieth us more than any father can do
his child: therefore let us not distrust: God yesterday, and to day, the same
for ever. If he provided for Joshua, he will also provide for us.

God may withdraw himself for a season: Hose. 5.15.
yet he will never forsake us. The Sun may be hid under a cloud, yet the Sun is
still: so God may hide himself from us for a time, yet he has a care of us
and will never forsake us. He seemed to have forsaken the widow of Sarepta,
when having but a little meal in a barrel, she was going out for a few sticks
to kindle a fire, to make a cake for her son and herself, and so to dye; yet,
he did not forsake her: the meal held out all the time of the famine.

He seemed to have forsaken Elias, when he sat under a tree fainting, yet he
did not forsake him: He commanded an Angel to feed him. He seemed to have
forsaken Lazarus, when he could not get crumbes; yet he did not utterly forsake
him, he took him into heaven to himself; and the Anqels carried his soul
thither. God may suffer us to be brought to a low ebb: yet he will not
forsake us: He will stir up one or other to relieve us: if men will not do
it, He will cause beasts and unreasonable creatures to do it. At the lest he
will take us into that place, where we shall never hunger nor thirst any more.
I never saw the righteous forsaken. We may see the righteous left for a time,
but never forsaken, of the LORD: therefore let us not be covetously minded, but
depend upon God.

VERSE 6.
1 THe foundation, whereon our faith is built. 2. A courageous speech for the
demonstration of our faith. Having GODS promise we may be bold to build upon
it. So that we may boldly say, with the Prophet David, I will not fear what
man can do unto me. No, nor the Devil that envious man.

Mat. 13.28.
We are too much afraid of men. Isa. 51.12. when Gehazi saw the Host of the
Aramites, he cried, alas, what shall we do? When King Herod frowned on them
of Tyrus and Sidon, they quaked and sought his favor. Acts 12.20.
Achaz. Isa. 7.2. At this day, if there be a great man in the Country, that
sets himself against us, that threatens to break our backs, we are in a
woeful case, we know not what to do. If a rich man in the Town be our
enemy, that has threatened to fit on our skirts, and to drive us out of the
Town: we are mightily afraid, there is no heart in us. Against this fleshly
and ungodly fear, let us oppose this buckler: the Lord is my helper -- Such a
one has threatened to beggar me, to make me not worth a groate: fear him not:
God sends a cursed Cow short horns; He has a thousand ways to curb him.

If God be on our side, who can be against us? What comparison between God and
man? God can take the breath out of his nostrils in the twinkling of an eye:
He can overcome him by flies, as He did Pharaoh: He choked Pope Adrian with
a fly: He can send worms to eat him up, as He did to Herod. All the men of
the world are to him as a fly to an Elephant. He can suddenly crush them. He
confounded the Counsel of Achitophel, overthrew Goliath with a stone. Therefore
let this victorious song be always in our hearts and mouths: The Lord is my
help, and I will not fear what man can do unto me: nay, I will not fear,
what all the Devils in hell can do unto me.

God is a spirit: man is flesh. God is strong: man is weak. God is the
Creator: man is the creature. God is the Lord: man is the servant. Therefore if
God be our helper, what need we to fear a man?

We in England have many enemies: enemies without the Realm, and within. The
Jesuits are always busy, ever working some mischief against us: they are
plotting continually: they have always some mischief or other a forging in
the shop of their cruel brain: they would feign make a general riddance of
us all. Yet let us say, the Lord is our helper, we will not fear what man, no
not what those bloody men can do against us.

VERSE 7.
BEfore, he gave moral precepts: now follow precepts of doctrine and Religion.

1 An exhortation to perseverance in true Doctrine. 2. A dehortation from false.
He exhorts to perseverance in the truth, by two Arguments. 1. From the
example of their spiritual guides and Captains, that have gone before them.
2. From the unity of the Doctrine of Christ, verse 8.

Touching their guides and rulers, there be two things 1. A remembrance of
them. 2. An intimation of them.

Suffer them not to slip out of your remembrance: though they be dead, yet let
not their memory dye.

He stirs them up to a remembrance of them, by a lively description of them.

They are described, 1. By the authority of their place. 2. By the sincerity of
their preaching.

The worthy Preachers and Martyrs that be gone, must not be banished out of our
memories: we must often think upon them, that the recordation of their virtues
may be as a whetstone to sharpen us to the like. The name of the wicked shall
rot: but the righteous shall be had in perpetual remembrance. If I forget thee
o Jerusalem, say they in the Psalm. Let not us forget the holy men, that dyed in
the Faith of CHRIST. I am as a dead man out of mind: Dead men are soon
forgotten. Let us remember Isaiah, that was sawen in pieces for the truth:
remember Saint Peter, Saint Paul, the Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, that have
laid down their lives for the truth. A notorious thief, an infamous drunkard,
like Falcidius, qui superavit totam Asiam bibendo, an egregious whoremaster, as
Hercules, shall be remembered: we will speak of them with a kind of jollity.
But good men, zealous and sober Christians shall soon be forgotten: we
seldom remember them, and talk of the good things, of the excellent graces,
wherewith GOD adorned them. It may be we will remember some Preachers that be
dead, and talk of them to the disgrace of some that be alive, to cast them
into the dish of the living, to upbraid them withal: but we do not remember
them for our own benefit, comfort and instruction, that they may be as bells to
toll us to the like good things that were in them.

Remember Lots wife, said Christ: but that was to avoyde the backsliding that
was in her. Remember your rulers, to embrace the virtues that were in them.

But how must we remember them? by following of their Faith. Whereunto he
inviteth us by a contemplation of their conversation, from the beginning to the
end: how sincere, how constant, they have been in the whole course of their
lives. Nothing could make them to starte, or to shrink from Christ and his
Gospel, but they continued manfully to the end. Follow them in this.

Here we may see how we are to honor the Saints departed.

He does not say, Erect Churches for the memorial of them: appoint holy days
to remember them by: worship their relics: Saint Paul his napkins, Saint
Peter's cross, the stone that hit Stephen on the elbowe, their bones etc. pray
to them, visit their tombs and sepulchers, go in pilgrimage to them: no, no,
but follow their faith: as they have been faithful to the end, not regarding
their own lives: so be you. This is the best honoring of the Saints departed.

If there have been any slips and infirmities in them, as all of them have had
some: let us not follow them in those, as Platoes Scholars followed him in his
crooked back, in going, stooping, as he did, and as Alexanders parasites
followed him in his defect of seeing. Let us not follow Noah in his drinking,
Abraham and Isaak in dissembling, Lot in his incest, the Midwives and Rachel in
lying, David in his adultery, Peter in his denial, Paul and Barnabas in
contention: but let us follow their Faith, their hope, zeal, continency,
their frequent and fervent praying, their enduring of all crosses for the Name
of Christ, and their constancy in the profession of the truth to the last
gasp. Neither famine, cold, nor nakedness, imprisonment, banishment, sword,
fire, faggot, could draw them from Christ. Let us follow them in these things,
that we together with them may follow the Lamb in the life to come.

VERSE 8.
WHy? they might have one Christ, and we an other: they one doctrine, and we
an other. That cannot be: Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for
ever; in the time of the law, now in the time of the Gospel, and so to the end
of the world.

In former ages, in this age, in future ages.

The same in Essence without change.

In his promises, never failing.

In his doctrine, Christ is put for the doctrine of Christ, 2 Cor. 3.14. Act.
15.21. Homer is often used for poetry: Mars for war: Apollo for wisdom:
Bacchus for wine.

He was declared after one manner in the law, in types, figures, sacrifices:
after an other manner now: but always the same Christ, the head and foundation
of the Church. 1 Cor. 3.11. Agnus occisus ab origin mundi.

There is but one truth and doctrine of Christ professed by the godly in all
ages: therefore let us embrace that, and persist in it to the end. They
embraced Christ: so let us do. There is one Christ, one Faith, one Baptism,
one Church: none other foundation can any lay, then Jesus Christ. He was the
foundation of the Church in Adams time, in Abraham's time, in Isaiahs time, in
Paul's time, in the law, in the Gospel; and shall be to the end of the world.
Abraham saw the day of Christ, and was glad. All that ever have been saved,
were saved by Christ, one GOD, and one Mediator between GOD and man. There is
no other under heaven whereby we must be saved. Therefore let us continue in
this one doctrine of Christ, which yesterday and to day is the same for ever.
Do not think that the Apostles had one Christ, and we an other: they one
doctrine, and we an other. The doctrine of Christ has been, is, and ever
shall be the same. Socrates among the heathen was semper idem: but Christ is
our semper idem: always the same, therefore let us cleave to him.

VERSE 9.
HEre follows the dehortation; which has two parts: the one negative, which
we must not do; the other affirmative, what we must do.

Be not carried about: as chafe, feathers, etc.

With diverse: by this understand the legal rites and ceremonies which were
diverse; that are of diverse sorts. Falsum multiplex: verum simplex. And
strange doctrine: which the Scripture does not acknowledge. Strange birds;
strangers out of an other Country, not bred and borne in the Scripture.

Worshipping of Images, a carnal eating of Christ's flesh by
transubstantiation, etc. are strange doctrines.

Now, the heart cannot be established with erroneous doctrine, about meats,
etc. but with the true doctrine of the grace and mercy of God toward us in
Christ: being justified by Faith, we have peace with God: there is no
condemnation to them that be in Christ. This does establish the conscience,
that the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us.

Let our hearts be established with this grace.

Not with meats..i. with unnecessary questions, about the ceremonial law. A
part, is put for the whole.

There was a time when distinction of meats was strictly to be observed: some
had rather be cruelly tormented even to death, then to eat swines flesh: but
now the difference is abrogated. God has said to Peter, and in him to us all,
arise, kill, and eat: no creature now is unclean, all are sanctified by the
Word of God and Prayer.

The several Observations enjoined us in the Ceremonial Law, cannot make us
acceptable to God; these cannot strengthen the heart: but the grace of God
toward us in Christ, that his blood has purged us from all sin; this is the
true Cordial that strengthens the heart: Therefore stick to that, and be not
carried away with other doctrines.

What went ye out into the wilderness to see, said Christ of John Baptist? A
reed shaken with the wind? We that be Christians, must be as stones
firmly built on Christ the rock, not as reeds. If the East wind blows, the
reed goes with that: If the West wind arise, it goes with that. Christians
must not be weather Cocks, that turn with the wind: we must be like the
steeple it self, that stands firmly; not like the weather Cock on the
steeple: not like Ecebolius, that changed his Religion always as the Emperors
changed: In the time of Constantine and Constantius, he was a Christian: In
the Reign of Julian, a Gentile, offering to their gods. When Julian was dead,
a Christian again, lying at the Church door, and saying to the people:
Calcate mesalem insipidum.

Thus, some now a days, are carried about; there is no stay in them: one while
Protestants, an other while Papists; one while Brownists, an other while
Anabaptists. Thus they are carried hither and thither. Ephesians. 4.14.
Be not as children, etc. Children are easily carried, won with an apple, lost
with a nut; of one mind to day, of an other to morrow: ye may make them say
and unsay: ye may make them call a man good or naught with the turning of an
hand. We must not be like them, we must be as men well advised what to do.
Ye may carry a cow up and down in the field with a lock of hay: ye may carry
some horses whither ye will with a horse loaf. So the profits and commodities
of the world carry many to any Religion. So as I may enjoy my goods, lands and
living, I care not of what Religion I be. Let us carry other men to Christ, but
let us not be carried by any from Christ. In the way of kindness, any friend
may carry us: but let neither friend nor foe carry us from Christ. When
certain of Christ's Disciples went away, Christ asked the twelve, Will ye also
go away? but says Saint Peter in the name of the rest, Whither shall we go?
so let us be as resolute: though there be never so many turne-coates, let us
say, Whither shall we go? to Popery, Anabapt. to Brownisme? no, We know whom
we have believed, we will never depart from the truth, and Word of God,
established amongst us.

Since the reformation of Religion in England, God wonderfully blessed this
land: how did he miraculously preserve it in Q. Elizabeth's days! how many
treacheries have been discovered? how was the invincible Navy of the Spaniards
foiled? How prosperously without the shedding of one drop of blood came King
James to the Crown, to the great joy of us al? How graciously has God
protected him and his Realm since? There has been treason on treason: but
God has broken the nets of them all.

Among them all, the powder treason, that should have been effected by a
match, is most unmatchable: hell it self cannot devise such another. Fight
neither against more nor less, said the King of Aram to his soldiers, save
against the King of Israel only. So the Papists heretofore cried, away with
Queen Elizabeth, fight against her: that is enough. Now not the King alone,
but the Queen, Prince, and all their royal Issue, the Nobility, and Clergy,
the Judges, the Knights, and Gentlemen, all the Parliament should have been
blown up at once: if this had gone forward, where had we been? Here a leg,
there an arm: here the head of such a Noble man should have been carried
about with gunpowder: but GOD be thanked, we all remain still, and pure
Religion, in despite of all, is continued among us. Therefore let us not be
carried about with diverse and strange doctrines. As God has upheld religion
among us strangely and miraculously: so let us hold it fast, and persevere in
it to the end. Though an Angel from heaven, much more though a Priest or
Jesuit from Rome, though a Papist, an Anabaptist, a Sectuary preach to us any
other Gospel, let us be carried by none of them all. Let us carry to Christ,
let us not be carried from Christ. Let us say with Ruth, we will live and dye
with thee; and with S. Peter, Thou have the words of eternal life: we will not
depart from thee, but continue in thy truth for ever, and not fall into error.

VERSE 10.
2 Reason,
IT is taken from a contrariety between the Ceremonial Law and Christ. If they
that will be justified by the observation of meats and other parts of the
Ceremonial Law, cannot be partakers of Christ; then that is to be abandoned:
but they that will be justified by the observation of meats, etc.

Ergo.

Where first the Doctrine, 10, 11, 12. secondly, the Use.

The Doctrine is first propounded, then confirmed.

An Altar, that is, a Sacrifice upon an Altar, which is JESUS CHRIST.

So the word is used, 1 Cor. 9.13.. 2 The word [ eating] does require it: we
eat that which is on the Altar: the Altar it self we cannot eat. Therefore it
is a figurative speech.

Which serve the Tabernacle: that be servants unto it.

The direct meaning of the place is this: we have a Sacrifice on an Altar.
Jesus Christ that was sacrificed on the Altar of the Cross for us, whereof
they have no authority to eat, that are still wedded to the Tabernacle, and
the rites of the Ceremonial Law. The Tabernacle and Christ cannot stand
together. If ye will needs retain the shadow still: ye have no right to the
Body. If in this clear light of the Gospel, when Christ the end of the Law
has appeared, ye will keep the Law still; then ye have no interest to Christ,
no benefit by him, Gal 5.4. Therefore away with the Ceremonies of the Law. The
like may be affirmed of the observation of any thing with Christ, for the
obtaining of eternal life: either have Christ alone, or have him not at all.

VERSE 11.
THE confirmation of this proposition. Where, first the type, secondly, the
thing signified by it. They that served at the Altar, could not eat that which
was burnt. The bodies of the beasts representing Christ, were burnt without the
host; therefore they could not eat of them: Lev. 16.27.
no more can they, that now cleave to the Tabernacle, eat Christ.

VERSE. 12.
THE thing signified is Christ.

Whereof the blood of the beasts was but a type.

Not within the City of Jerusalem, but without in the place called dead men's
skuls: as malefactors at this day for the most part suffer without the Town
and City: the Gallows stand without.

They that think to be sanctified by any other thing than by Christ, cannot
have the benefit of his passion.

Jesus,] the Savior of the world, the Son of the High and eternal God.

Which otherwise could not be sanctified. The blood of Goats would not serve
the turn. It must be his own blood.

After a most base and ignominious manner, he was crucified between two
thieves: He humbled himself to the death, yea, the death of the cross.

O the wonderful love of Christ! Christ's love should constrain us, that as he
has dyed for our sins: so we should dye to them. We are redeemed from our old
conversation, not with silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Jesus, 2 Samuel 23.17.
the Son of God. Let this constrain us to forsake our sins. David would not
drink of the water, for the which the Worthies ventred their lives: and shall
we drink of the water of sin, which cost Christ his life? Christ shed his
blood for our drunkenness and uncleanness, pride, malice, etc. And yet shall
we wallow in them? We lay not to heart the price of our redemption. We forget
the Lord that has bought us. -- We are bought with the blood of God, Acts
20.28. Therefore let us not serve the devil, but him that has bought us. We
are Christ's, not our own, he has paid dearly for us, even his own blood;
therefore let us serve him.

VERSE 13.
THE Use is double. 1. A departure out of the world.

Without the Camp of this miserable world, where we have so many enemies.
This is enforced, 1. By the example of Christ.

When Christ went out of the Camp, he bore reproach: he bore his own cross a
while, till he could no longer for faintness: he was nailed to the cross,
shamefully reproached many ways. A Crown of thorns in derision, was set on
his head, because he said he was a King. All that went by mocked him. --

We go out of the world two ways: actu, at our dying day, affectu, in our
lifetime. We are in the world, but we are not of the world. We are Citizens of
the heavenly Jerusalem: therefore our conversation must be in Heaven. Let us
go out of our fair houses, sweet gardens, pleasant pastures. Let us go out
from our sheep, and Oxen, gold and silver, wives and children. Let us so use
them, as if we were ready to depart from them. The time must come when I must
leave you all. Therefore in the mean season, let us go out of them. Let us
set our hearts on nothing in the world, but on God alone. Let us use this
world, as if we used it not, for the glory thereof fades away. Yet for all
that, we are loath to go out, nay we dwell in the world continually: we are in
the world all the week long; yea, even on the Lord's Day too. We are like them,
Phil. 3. Whose belly is their God, which mind earthly things: the world, the
world, nothing but the world. Let Heaven go whither it will: If it were
possible, we would make our Tabernacles here, as S. Peter would have done in
the Mount. Go out of the world, that is an hard saying, who can abide it? Let
us follow Moses in refusing a Kingdom. Monica, whose song was, volemus in
coelum.

How must we go out of the Camp of the world? not dreaming to live in a
paradise here, but preparing our selves for afflictions, being content to be
reproached as Christ was. We must not think to go to Heaven in a feather-bed,
to sail always with a fair wind: through many tribulations we must pass
thither, and be tossed with the wind of many reproaches by the way. Christ was
reproached, and shall we imagine to go to heaven without reproaches? Let us
arm our selves for the bearing of reproaches, and let us in a manner glory of
them. I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. Gal. 6.17.
It is better to have Christ's marks, than a purple gown on our backs, or a
triple Crown on our heads, as the Pope has: and let this be a comfort to us:
our reproach, if it be for Christ's sake, is Christ's reproach. If men mock us,
they mock Christ: if they imprison us, or kill us for his Gospel, they kill
Christ; and let us suffer with him, that we may be glorified with him.

VERSE 14.
2 IT is enforced by an argument taken from our estate and condition in the
world. If we have no time of continuance here, then let us be content to go
out. If a Tenant know that his lease is expired, he must be willing to go out.
We have not so much as a lease, no not for a year, month, week, day, nor
hour: therefore let us be willing to go out.

But why should we go out of the Camp of the world? The world is a warm
nest, and we have a long time to continue in it. Nay, we are deceived, the
Cities themselves are of no continuance: the winds blow them down, the enemy
may sack them, and make them even with the ground, waters may overflow them,
fire consume them; many goodly Cities have been burnt.

At the furthest, they shall all down at the day of judgment: then the earth
with the works thereof shall be burnt with fire. We our selves have no time of
continuance in them. The Major of a City dies, the Aldermen dye, the Citizens
dye: there is dying of one or other every day. London, York, etc. are no
Cities to continue in. Many are taken away daily, and GOD knows when our turn
shall be. We must out of our Houses, Towns, Cities, we cannot continue here
long: therefore let us go out before in affection, that when death comes, we
may willingly go from all. Yet a wonder it is to see how men dream of a
contiuance here, and lay up goods for many years, as that rich man did: and
yet this night thy soul may be taken from thee. O consider ye have no
continuing here. Many Townes-men, many of thy neighbors, be gone, and thou
must go too, thou know not how quickly: therefore think upon that City
which continues for ever.

Here we have none, but seek one: it will not be gotten without seeking. Seek
the kingdom of God: seek the things that be above. Seek it by prayer,
fasting, reading of Scriptures, heavenly meditations, etc. We are like Esops
dog, that snapt at the shadow in the water, and let the shoulder of mutton go,
that was in his mouth: we look for shadows, silver and gold, sheep and
oxen, and let the kingdom of heaven go, which is the substance of all. It
does not appear by us, that we seek for any City to come: we seek to seat
our selves, to establish our dwellings here, we care not in a manner for the
life to come.

VERSE 15.
THE second Use is the Oblation of Sacrifices. 1. of praise. 2. of beneficence.
1. the Precept. 2. the Exposition of it.

In the Precept these Circumstances; by whom: what: when: to whom we must
offer.

By Christ. Ioh. 16.23. 1 Pet. 2.5. Apoc. 8.3.

The Sacrifice.i. Spiritual. 1 Pet. 2.5. of praise, in it is included petition
too.

The fruit: alluding to the first fruits in the law.

The Rhemists interpret it, the host of praise.i. the Body of Christ in the
Eucharist, which the Fathers call the Sacrifice of praise.

But then every Christian should be a Priest: for all must offer this Sacrifice
of praise.

This (say they) is the fruit of the Priests lips: because by virtue of those
words, that come out of his lips, the host is made.

When must we offer? continually: In adversity, in sickness, in death, in
prison, as Paul and Silas did.

To whom? God is the Fountain of all good things. Iac. 1.17. Therefore he
alone is to be praised. To his Name.i. to the Glory of his Name. Bellar.
confesses that a Sacrifice belongs only to God.

Infinite be the occasions that may induce us to the offering of this
Sacrifice. Let us praise God for our Creation after his own Image, in making
us Lords over all his creatures: for the goodly house and furniture of the
world, which in mercy, he has provided for us; the Sun, Moon and Stars,
birds of the air, fishes of the sea, beasts of the field, all are for us. Let
us praise him for our food and sustenance. How many creatures dye for us, and
yet we are more worthy to dye then they? Let us praise him especially for his
holy Word, the silver trumpet to call us to Heaven: for our Sanctification by
his Spirit.

Chiefly for our Redemption by Jesus Christ. If he had not been borne, and
dyed for us, it had been better for us we had never been borne. Therefore
let us praise God continually for him. Let us praise him for our peace, that
there be no wars in England, no leading into captivity, no complaining in
our streets. Let us praise him for our health. What a number be sick, and we
are whole* nay, let us praise him for his fatherly castigations, in correcting
us in this world, that we should not be condemned in the world to come. Thus
did Job: Blessed be the Name of the Lord. We can never want matter of
praising of God: yet this Sacrifice, that ought always to be offered, is
seldom offered. It may be we will praise God, when we come to Church with the
Congregation: but little enough at other times. Praise ye him Sun and Moon,
says the Psalmist, Frost and snow, etc. The very insensible creatures praise
God in their kind, and we that are endewed with sense, knowledge and
understanding praise him not. The birds of the air are chirping betimes in the
Summer mornings, singing cheerfully to their Creator, when we lie drowsing
on our beds. Act. 16.25.
Paul and Silas when they were in prison, at midnight sang and gave thanks:
and shall not we that have our liberty? Let us stir up our selves more and
more to this duty. As his mercies never cease: so let us never cease praising
of him. Worthy is the Lord, from whom we receive all good things for Soul and
body, for this life, and that which is to come, to receive all Honor and
Glory, etc.

VERSE 16.
1. THE Precept: then the Reason.

Do good [to all: chiefly to them of the household of Faith. Gal. 6.10. and to
communicate:] we are not to keep all to ourselves.

And forget not: we are ready to forget that.

With such as these be, and with these too. Phil. 4.18.

Is well pleased: Promeretur. Melius est ut nos reprehendant Grammatici, quam
non intelligant populi: says Bellar. I but Divines will reprehend them: nay,
GOD will reprehend them: they break Priscians head, and Paul's too.

That is all one, say the Jesuits. If GOD be pleased with good works; then
they be meritorious. I? GOD is pleased with the Saints in Heaven: yet they do
not merit: for when they have all joys, there remains nothing for them to
merit.

A number there be that labor to gather goods: but they do no good with
them. Many a man of small ability does more good in a Town, then some men of
great wealth in the Town. We have not our goods for our selves alone: Romans
14.7.
no man lives to himself, nor dies to himself. Yet now men are good for
none but for themselves. Thou gatherest for thy wife and children, so do the
heathen: so do bruit beasts. The birds build nests for their young ones; and an
hen scrapeth for her chickens. If thou be a Christian, thou must do more
good then so. As thou art full of goods: so thou must be full of good works,
as Dorcas was: cloth the naked, feed the hungry, comfort the comfortles, be a
father to the fatherles, an husband to the widows: give to the Schools of
learning, for the continuance of the ministry, and preaching of the Word: do
good one way or other in the Town and Country where thou dwell. If thou
can not do good with thy purse, do good with thy tongue, by exhorting
others, provoking them to love and good works: every way let us do good,
especially with the goods that GOD has lent us. Let us show our selves good
stewards of them. It is a more blessed thing to give then to take: yet we are
all of the taking hand, none of the giving. Acts 20.35.


Make ye friends of this unrighteous mammon. If ye keep all to your selves,
and do no good with it, you make your riches your enemies: they will condemn
you at the latter day. If ye do good with them, you make them your friends,
and these good works of yours, will follow you at your dying day. Yet some are
so far from doing of good, that they do hurt by secret counsel and
persuasion. Many are like rotten trees, that do no good till they dye: they
yield nor fruit while they stand; when they be cut down, they make a good
fire to warm many withal. So it may be, there is good cheer at a rich man's
buryall, a dole then to refresh the poor withal, that did little good while
he was alive. Let us remember this Lesson, to do good, and to distribute.

God is well pleased with such Sacrifices: he is so well pleased with them,
that he will give us a Kingdom for them in the life to come. Come ye blessed
of my Father, inherit the Kingdom, Mat. 25.34.
etc. when I was hungry, etc. Therefore inherit the Kingdom prepared for you.

VERSE 17.
AS they must do good to all; so especially to the Ministers, that have the
spiritual rule and government of them.

1. How they must behave themselves to all in general. 2. what they must do
for him in special.

In the former the duties prescribed: and certain reasons for the enforcing of
them. The duties are Obedience and Submission.

It cannot be denied, but that all of what condition soever must submit
themselves to the ministry of the word, yea Kings, Princes, and Emperors;
because it is Gods Ordinance; and in so doing they submit themselves to GOD,
which is no disparagement to the greatest of them all.

Yet touching matters of external polity in the Church and Commonwealth, all
on the other side must be subject to Kings and Princes: they may prescribe
constitutions, even of Religion, agreeable to the Law of GOD, to Ministers, and
they must obey them. Let every Soul be subject to the Higher Powers. Yet in
the Essential points of the ministry, all must subject themselves to the
Rulers of the Church.

For a more full unfolding of the matter, the duties we owe to these Spiritual
Fathers are four:

1. Reverence in regard of their Office. Alexander reverenced Iaddus. Herod,
John the Baptist. Obadiah called Elias Lord. My father, said Iohash to Elisha.
If we reverence them not, the Word will not have so free a passage among us.
They that use their Pastors unreverently, sin against God.

Math. 5.13.
2. Love: Have them in exceeding love for their works sake. It is the best
work in the world; the Saving of your Souls: therefore love them for it. You
love the Fathers of your bodies, that brought you into the world, and will ye
not love them that beget you with the Word of truth, 1 Timothy 4. ult.
and bring you to a Kingdom? Obad. ult.

Mar. 6.20.
3. Obedience, to their doctrine, exhortations and admonitions. Herod observed
John Baptist, and did many things. You will obey the prescript of the Physician
for the health of your bodies; though it be a bitter potion, you take it well
at his hands: and will you not obey them that give you counsel for your
souls? though their reproves be bitter, their rebukes sharp, Tit. 1.13. as
the quality of the sin requires; yet accept of it, if they tell you, and that
in love, of your covetousness, drunkenness, pride, malice, obey them in the
reformation of those vices.

4. Is Maintenance. All Rulers must be maintained. The King has maintenance
due from the people, and so must the Minister. You receive spiritual things
from them, and is it much, if ye give them carnal? They that served at the
Altar, lived on the Altar: and shall not they that preach the Gospel, live on
the Gospel? If the Preachers would preach to us, and take nothing, we would
like them well: but we grudge at their maintenance: an Argument that we feel
not the sweetness of the Word of GOD. The Galathians would have plucked out
their eyes to do Paul good withal: We think much to pull money out of our
purses to do him good withal. In the fear of GOD, if ye be good and
religious people, discharge the duties, that GOD requires, to them that have
the Spiritual government and oversight of you.

Why? there be two reasons to excite us to it: the one taken from the matter
of their work; the other from the manner of their working. They are your
watchmen: therefore submit your selves to them, love them, regard them.

Not over your goods and bodies, as the Magistrate is: but over your Souls,
which are more precious: not as the fowler watches for the bird to catch it
and kill it, but they watch for the preservation and eternal Salvation of your
souls: therefore submit your selves to them.

All Ministers have Curam Animarum: none can be a Minister without that charge.

Your Souls are subject to many enemies: there be innumerable devils that
seek to carry away your Souls. As the hen watches for the chickens against
the kite: so do they for you against the devil. There be sundry Heretics,
that go about to infect your Souls with the poison of false doctrine, Papists,
Anabaptists, Schismatiques, Priests and Jesuits, Arrians, Nestorians, etc. The
Ministers watch for you against them. There be sectaries, that for small
matters would draw you from the Church: there be many dangerous sins, that
are ready to cut the throat of your Souls, covetousness, pride, ignorance,
etc. they keep a watch over you, and labor to bring you out of those sins.
Therefore esteem highly of them, make much of these watchmen.

This is illustrated by a spur, that pricks them to this watching: they know
they must be countable for your Souls; therefore they watch over them. Jacob
gave account to Laban of every sheep he had; if any were lost or torn by the
wild beasts, he required it at his hands, he made it good: so we must give
an account to JESUS CHRIST, the great Shepherd, of every sheep in our fold.
This makes us to watch carefully over your Souls. Some are to give a single
account. We must all give account of our Stewardship, as private persons for
themselves alone: some a double account, as Magistrates, Masters, Fathers,
Ministers: therefore we had need to look to it, to cast over our Books
betimes in this life, that our accounts may be joyful in the life to come.

That we may say, Here am I, and the children that thou have given me: Here
am I Lord JESUS, and the sheep that thou have given me.

Suffer us to meddle with you, to reprehend that which is amiss in you: for we
must give an account for you. Therefore we cannot let you alone, we cannot,
nay, we must not permit you to sleep in your sins: we must lift up our
voices as trumpets to waken you, because we are to give account for you.

The second Reason is taken from the manner of their working: they would gladly
do their work with joy: they would watch over you with joy: which they cannot
do, if you be peevish, perverse and froward: therefore submit your selves to
them. What though we grieve them? what care we? will such a thing grieve him?
he shall be sure to have it then: we will do it for the nonce. Some are at
this pass. But you shall have no benefit by that: you hurt your selves more
then them.

Unprofitable: 1. in this life: and that two kind of ways. 1. being grieved
they cannot discharge their ministry so well to your edification: they cannot
study so well, preach so well, as otherwise they might do: and that makes
against your profit. The worse they preach, the worse it is for you. They
cannot till the ground of your hearts so cheerfully: they cannot build you up
as an house to GOD so comfortably, as it were meet. Thus you gain nothing by
grieving of them, but loose by it. Grief overthrowes any work: a clothyer
cannot labor in his calling well, that is grieved. Grief hinders any man:
much more a Preacher. It deprives him of his sleep, and makes him unfit for
any thing.

2. The Preacher and Pastor being grieved must needs power out his grief into
the bosom of GOD Almighty, whose workman he is: he cannot but complain to
God of it. Lord what untoward people be these? and do ye not think God will
take his cause into his hand, look upon the grief of his steward, and by one
means or other, by the pestilence, sword, famine, plague the people for it,
that are the Authors of his grief? therefore grieve them not. You shall find
it very unprofitable for you in the end.

2. It shall be unprofitable you in the life to come, if ye repent not of it.
CHRIST will say to all them that have opposed themselves to his Ministers,
come, you are they, that have vexed my servants, depart from me, I know you
not. Therefore so behave yourselves, that they may perform their Office with
joy, not with grief.

In grieving of them, you grieve the Holy Ghost, and Christ too. It is not we
that speak, but the Spirit of Father, that speaks in us. If we be grieved,
he is grieved: and as Christ said to Saul, Why persequutest thou me? So he
says to all peevish persons, that set themselves to grieve his Ministers, Why
grieve ye me? Ye shall find the incommoditie of it in the end. Therefore
grieve them not: give them all the encouragement you can, that they may do
their duty with joy, to the Salvation of you all.

In the former verse, he enjoined Obedience to their Spiritual Governors:
now he requires their prayers for them.

1. He requests their prayers: 2. he affords them his prayers, verse 20.

In the former, 1. the suit is propounded. 2. prosequuted, verse 19.

In the propounding, 1. what they are to do. 2. why they are to do it.

VERSE 18.
BY all probability it was Paul, and the rest of the Ministers that were with
him, that put up this grace, to be prayed for.

1. We will pray for them whom we love most. We are not commanded in the
Word of GOD, to love any so dearly as the faithful Preachers. Have them in
exceeding love, says the Spirit of GOD. 1 Thessalonians. 5.13.
Excess is dangerous in all things, yet we must exceed in our love to the
Ministers. Paul has exceeded in the choice of his Word, and we must exceed
in our Love: (...), abundantly had been enough, yet he abounds above that;
he puts an (...) to it, then an (...): he could not go higher. Above all
abundance in love. We love them best that do most for us. The Preachers do
more for us then any in the world, under GOD. Our Fathers give us our bodies,
but not our Souls: they make both Soul and body new creatures in Christ
Jesus. Our Fathers bring us into the light of this world, which we must one
day loose again: they bring us to the light of the heavenly Jerusalem, which
we shall enjoy for ever: these then are most to be loved: therefore most to
be prayed for. If that heathen King, and mighty Emperor did think himself
more beholden to his Schoolmasters, then to Philip his Father, because from
the one he had his Esse; from the other, his been esse: Truly we are more to
praise GOD for the Preachers, by whom we are made new creatures in Christ
Jesus, and Citizens of Heaven, then for our earthly Fathers, by whom we are
made Citizens of the earth.

2 We pray for you: we sequester ourselves from worldly businesses, that we
may give our selves to the word of God and prayer. Acts 6. there is never a day
but we pray for you: we count it sin with Samuel to cease praying for you:
therefore pray you for us. Vnum orare pro multis, is a great matter and
requires much boldness and confidence, says Chrysostom. But multos orare pro uno,
nihil est onerosi. When one man prays for many, oration fit unius virtutis
intuitu: when many pray for one, oration fit multitudinis and concordiae
intuitu, qua Deus ubique potissimum placatur. Multi animi dum unanimes
congregantur, fiunt magni: therefore you being many may more boldly pray for
us, then we for you.

3 There is singular use of the Preachers, Acts 16.17. we are GODS
Torch-bearers, that carry the flaming Torch of the Word of God before your
eyes, to show you the way to the Kingdom of Heaven. They are the Charets and
horsemen of Israel. Without us ordinarily you cannot be saved: how can they
hear without a Preacher? Saint Peter saved three thousand Souls at a Sermon.
Saint Paul saved Sergius Paulus the Proconsul, Dionysius a Judge of Mars
street, Damaris a noble Gentlewoman, and sundry others: and ordinarily not one
man or woman can go to heaven, unless a Preacher carry him on his shoulders:
not one sheafe can get into the barn, unless a harvest man do carry it: and
thou can not be carried as a sheafe into the barn of the Kingdom of
heaven, unless some of CHRIST's harvest men carry thee thither: therefore pray
for them.

4 If we do well, the profit is yours: postulamus quidem, ut pro nobis oretis:
totum autem fit pro vobis, in vos istae divitiae redunda bunt. Chrysostom. If a
Nurse have a full dugge, it is the better for the Infant. If the householder
have refertam villam, they shall fare the better, that be in the house. If our
gifts of wisdom, knowledge, discretion, of love, zeal, etc. increase, the
commodity shall be yours.

Then pray for us, and that heartily, in the Church and in your houses: that
the Word of God may run, may have free passage, may have nothing to stay the
running, that it may be glorified throughout all England, to the joy and
comfort of us all. Pray for the Reverend fathers of the Church, that they may
use the Sword of authority, which God has put into their hands to the cutting
down of all pernicious weeds, of Anabaptisme, Brownisme, Popery, in this
garden of the LORD JESUS. Pray for all, faithful Preachers and Ministers
whatsoever, that all the people from the highest to the lowest may know CHRIST,
and live obediently to the Gospel. One principal reason why there be so many
disorders in the Church is this, because the people have no care of their
Ministers, seldom or never commend them in their prayers to the God of heaven.

Earnest prayer was made by the Church for Saint Peter: and the Ephesians
prayed for Saint Paul, till they wept again: but there is no praying for our
Paul's and Peter's. If it had been said, prate of us, the people would readily
have put that in practice: they make the Preachers their table talk, they
speak evil of the Rulers of the people in all places. If it had been said,
prey upon us, we should have had a number of preyers. That which the Papists
gave to the Ministers, they that be called Protestants, take from the
Ministers. Pharaoh would not have the lands of the Priests touched in the time
of a famine and scarcity. We in the time of a plenty take away their lands.
Heretofore the lean kine devoured the fat, and were more ill favored: now
the fat devour the lean and are never satisfied. Heretofore the people gave
their very earrings to the Priests: now they are ready to pull the coat over
the Priests ears. Every one in the parish will prey upon him: but scarce one
will pray for him.

If it had been said, pry into us, we would have done it with a narrow eye:
the foot of a Preacher shall not slip, but he shall be taken tripping by and
by: a moate shall be made a beam, a molehill a mountain. But he does not say,
prey upon us, prate of us, pry into us, but pray for us: and as ye love the
glory of GOD, the beauty of Sion, the peace of Jerusalem, the salvation of your
own souls, pray for us.

Some there be that will pray for the Ministers, but it is because they are
bound to pray for their enemies. There is one, Michaiah, said Achab, but I hate
him. So some will say, indeed we have a Minister, but he is ever rubbing on my
soars, therefore I hate him. Yet because CHRIST says, pray for them that hate
you, I will pray for him. I but thou must pray for him, as for the greatest
friend in the world, that thy soars being lanched with the sword of the
Spirit, which is the Word of GOD, they may be suppled with the oil of GODS
mercy in CHRIST, and thou saved at the day of Judgment.

Here we may see the wonderful humility of Saint Paul: he was a
master builder of the Church, had seen CHRIST, he was adorned with singular
gifts of learning, and of piety, he spoke with tongues more then al: he was
taken up into the third heaven, etc. He was a man deep in GODS books, in
prayers often, in fastings often; he had traveled all the world over in the
propagation of the Gospel of CHRIST. A man would have thought that his own
prayers had been sufficient, he needed not the prayers of others. Indeed the
prayers of Prophets, of Preachers are of great force with God. Genesis 20.7.
The LORD told Abimelech, that Abraham was a Prophet, he should pray for him.
Yet the prayers of common Christians are also to be desired. Vis unita fortior.
The prayers of the people and Ministers joined together will the sooner
prevail with the Lord. The King may adscribe much, to the request of one of
his privy Counsel: yet he rejects not the petition of the meanest Subject.
The Preachers are of Gods privy Counsel: He reveals his secrets to them: yet
the prayer of a righteous man is avayleable, if it be servent. Cornelius was
no Minister: yet his prayer went up into remembrance before God. The head
needs the aid of the foot: the King needs the prayers of the Subjects, the
Minister of the people. Therefore let us all require the prayers one of an
other.

But why should we pray for you? you are bad men: God will not hear our
prayers for you. It is not so: for we trust we have, etc. Some take it to be
an argument, a pari. We have discharged a good conscience toward you in all
things, delivering unto you all things necessary to salvation: therefore
discharge you a good conscience again in praying for us. But it is rather a
procreant cause of their prayers. We are holy men, such as fear God, as labor
to keep a good conscience, and to live honestly: therefore pray for us. You
are to pray for all, chiefly for them that be of the household of faith. We
are of that household, and bring forth the fruits of faith, therefore pray for
us. Ungodly men that have no good conscience had most need to be prayed for:
yet we may pray more boldly for the godly: God will sooner hear us for them.

These words (...), may either be understood of the persons or of the things:
they are indifferent in the Greek. Some connexe them with the words following,
and refer them to the persons thus: We are assured that we have a good
conscience, there they make a Comma, amongst all men desiring to live honestly.
The matter is of no importance. Yet I see no reason why our English translation
may not be retained. It agrees with that protestation of Saint Paul, I have
walked with all good conscience to this day. As here he says, (...): so there
(...). Acts 23.1.


See how confident he is in this point: he does not say, we hope, we think,
we have some probable conjecture or light persuasion, but we are assured, this
with boldness and confidence we are able to protest: not to our commendation
and glory, but to the praise and glory of God: that we have a good conscience
in all things.

Whereby we are given to understand, that it behooveth all Christians,
especially Ministers, to be assured of a good conscience in all their doings.
Nothing is more terrible then an ill conscience. It is the only hell, as
Luther calls it. If the Devil had not an ill conscience, he were in heaven in
comparison. As on the contrary side, nihil in hac vita securius, nihil
jucundius possidetur bona conscientia, says an ancient Father. Premat corpus,
trahat mundus, terreat diabolus: illa tamen semper erit secura.

Wherefore let us first search out what a good conscience is: then what be the
things wherein a Minister must keep a good conscience. First for the
conscience in general. It is called conscientia, says Bern. quasi cordis
scientia: that etymology is not to be rejected, if it be taken with his
meaning. Scientia, says he, is when the heart knows other things;
conscientia, quando cor novit se. Yet as any may see according to the nature of
the word, conscience is a knowledge with an other. The Hebrews have no fit
name for it: in all the old Testament the word conscience is not to be found.
Yet the old translation has foisted it into the Text, Genesis 43.22. Non est in
nostra conscientia quis posuerit eam in marsupijs nostris: as also, Prove.
12.18. It is in the book of Wisdom and Ecclesiastic. but they were written
in Greek. But the Hebr. put [ leb] the heart, for it. David's heart smote him,
that is, his conscience. Give not thine ear to every word that men speak of
thee, for thy heart knows that thou also have cursed others, that is, thy
conscience. Eccles. 7.14.
In Greek it is (...), in Latin conscientia, a joint knowledge or a knowledge
with an other: either cum alio, that is with the high and eternal God; for
none besides God and a man's own self has an immediate knowledge of himself:
or rather scientia cum alia scientia, there is a knowledge whereby we know that
we know, and that is conscience: but the nature thereof shall better be
manifested by a definition. I might propound sundry to you.

Damascen defines it thus: it is lex nostri intellectus.

Origin. est correptor and paedagogus animae.

Saint Bernard. est inseparabilis gloria vel confusio uniuscujusque. The
Schoolmen say, it is applicatio Scientiae ad factum, seu faciendum.

The best of the new writers, est practicus Syllogismus hominem excusans aut
accusans.

In my poor judgment, it may be thus defined, conscience is a function of
the understanding, whereby we apply the general knowledge that is in us, to
our particular thoughts, words, and actions.

1 It is not a part of the will, but of the understanding: not of that which
we call theoricall, but of that which is termed practical. Therefore it is in
work and action. As a dead man is no man, but (...): So a dead conscience is
no conscience, but nomine tenus. A seared conscience that is past feeling and
does nothing. Whereupon the Schoolmen contend, that it is neither habitus, nor
potentia, but actus. His whole work is to apply the general knowledge
engraven in us by the pen of nature, to our particular thoughts, words and
actions. There be generales notitiae, or maxims written in our hearts: as, it
is an horrible thing to commit murder, a beastly thing to commit adultery, a
foul vice to lie and dissemble, to have an heart and an heart; whereas God
has given thee but one heart. This the law written in our hearts teaches us.
Now comes conscience and does her duty. Thou have committed murder, thou art an
adulterer, a liar, a dissembler: therefore thou art abominable in the sight of
God. The knowledge that is in us gives us the major: Conscience infers the
minor, and the conclusion necessarily follows of it self.

This is conscience in general; whereby it is easy to see what a good
conscience is. One defines a good conscience thus. Quae habet in cord
puritatem, in ore veritatem, in action rectitudinem: and it is not amiss; yet
it expresses not the power of a good conscience.

A good conscience is a comfortable applying of the knowledge that is in us, to
the joy of our hearts: whereupon arises boldness and confidence, so that a
man thinks himself as it were in heaven. I will give you an example of it in
a minister. Knowledge gives Saint Paul the major: every minister of CHRIST that
has walked faithfully in his calling, shall have a crown of righteousness: a
good conscience in Saint Paul makes the minor, and brings in the conclusion. I
have fought a good fight, kept the faith: therefore for me is reserved a crown
of righteousness: This is a good conscience, 2 Timothy 4.7.
which ought in some measure to be in us all. That we may the better be
assured, that we have a good conscience, as Saint Paul had, let us examine our
consciences in these things. First for our entrance into the ministry, then
for the execution of our ministry being entered.

First, let us examine our conscience about our entrance into this high and
magnificent calling: wherein two especial points are to be observed; namely
the gifts passive and active.

1 Let us call our selves to account what passive gifts we have received from
GOD Almighty. A Bishop, says Nazianz. is not (...), a vain and empty name, he
must be well furnished in some measure with gifts fit for the office. A Scribe
says CHRIST, that is taught to the Kingdom of Heaven, must be as a rich
householder, that is able (...) to tumble out of his treasury (...), such are
all Ministers of GODS sending. Ezra was a perfect scribe in the law of God.
Ezra. 7.12.
So Artashastes does entitle him in the beginning of his letter. To Ezra the
perfect Scribe of the law of the Gods of heaven. Apollos was (...), and mighty
in the Scriptures. Saint Paul boasted of himself after an heavenly manner, I
thank my GOD, I speak with tongues more then they all: But a number there
be, that thank GOD they speak but with one tongue, namely their mother
tongue. Indeed the man of GOD ought chiefly to be seen in GODS book, and
though he have never so great skill in Logic, Rhetorique, Philosophy,
History, etc. he must dissimulare eloquij venustatem, when he speaks to the
people, as Saint Ierom. says: yet for all that, he must not be a rudesby, a
mere stranger in them. Moses that man of GOD was brought up (...), in all, no
art excepted: and this Saint Stephen records, to his singular commendation.
Saint Paul was not to seek in Aratus, Epimenides, and others. Meletus Bishop
of Alexandria, whom alluding to his name, they called mel Atticae, he was
(...) in all acts, as Eusebius. testifies of him. Didymus used rhetorique, poetry,
philosophy. Philo Iudaeus was an excellent divine in his age; for his learning
in these external arts, he was called an other Plato. Origin was wonderful in
them, in so much as Porphyrie his enemy was compelled to admire him for it. The
Papists at this day, many of them, give them their due, are very learned men.
Oh that GOD would turn the edge of learning the right way!

And shall the Ministers of our Church be unlearned? will thou leap into
Moses Chair, or rather into Christ's Chair, and have no gifts in any
comparable measure to teach the people out of it? The King in the Gospel said
to the man that came to the marriage without the wedding garment, Friend, how
came thou hither? So will he say to all saucy and insufficient Ministers,
Friend, how came you hither? who made you the dressers of my vineyard, that
have no skill to dress it? who made you dividers of my word, that mangle it,
and cannot cut aright? who made you builders of my house, that know not how to
square a stone, or frame a piece of timber for my house? Dancers have their
School, says Nazianz. Fiddlers and Musicians are trained up to it: and is the
ministry, (...)? Is it such a light thing, that whosoever will, as it was in
Ieroboams time, whether he be a Weaver, a Tapster, a Tailor, may be a
Minister? it is (...). Sometimes he must be taught, sometimes confuted,
comforted, reprooved: and Who is sufficient for these things? None fully. The
great Doctors in Divinity, must be Scholars all the days of their life:
yet if thy conscience tell thee, that thou have no gifts in any acceptable
measure, how can thou say with Saint Paul, I am assured I have a good
conscience in all things, when not in the first thing, in the gate and porch to
the ministry?

The best furniture of all is a sincere and upright heart. As God gave Saul an
other heart, when he advanced him to the kingdom: So the Lord gives a good
heart to all good Ministers. Learning and knowledge is as water in the well: a
good heart is as the bucket to draw it out for the watering of Christ's Garden:
if this be wanting, even a learned man will do little good in the ministry.
Therefore examine with what heart thou came hither: to feed thy self; or
the lambs of Christ? to enrich thy self, or to make them rich in Faith?

2. Let us come to active gifts. When we have the Testimony of a good
Conscience, that the Lord in some measure has given us gifts from Heaven: Let
us consider what gifts we give on earth, whether Lady Pecunia be the janitrix
that lets us into the Church or not? whether we come in by Simon Magus, or
Simon Peter? Qui vendunt vel emunt praebenda Ecclesiarum, dicuntur tales a
Simone, Simoniales. Simonie is well defined by Brulifer, to whom the rest of
the Schoolmen agree: Est studiosa voluntas emendi, vel vendendi aliquod
spirituale, seu spirituali annexum. Pactum, is not only Simonie, a compact or
agreement between the Patron, and a Minister, or any other for them: but
Simonie is peccatum voluntatis; as the heart commits adultery, if thou lustest
after a woman; as the heart commits murder; if thou hate thy brother, thou
art a murderer. So not the hand only, but the heart commits Simonie, if thou
have a lustful desire after a benefice in an unlawful way: In their judgment
thou art a Simonist. And this they prove by the Father of Simonists: There was
no pactum between Simon Magus, and the Apostles, but only voluntas. (...):
he made an offer of money to them; and that was condemned. If thou have a
desire in thine heart to get a benefice by any sinister means, thou art a
Simonist: then almost in this age, who can say he is assured to have a good
conscience in this thing?

Yet further to lay it open, let us come to the branches of Simonie. It is
committed four kind of ways.

The first and the greatest per pecuniam: which no man will deny: Saint
Ambrose reports as a monstrous thing in his days: I heard a Minister say,
Centum solidos dedi, ut Episcopalem gratiam ass equerer. But how would he have
wondered, if he had lived in our time, when we may hear that some have given
centum minas for a benefice? when solidi are turned into minae, what does this
but minari, the vengeance of God to the Ministry?

The second way is per adulationem: when as a Minister which is the Doctor of
the truth, has no truth in him, but will lie, flatter, cosen and dissemble,
do any thing for a Benefice. This is Venenum mellis dulcedine palliatum,
poison wrapped in honey: yet as many Popes came to the Popedom by poison; so
many Ministers (so woeful is our time) come to a benefice by this poison. They
cannot be assured with Saint Paul, that they have a good conscience in it.

The third way is Per importunas preces ambientium, by the importunate suit of
Ministers, either by themselves, or by their great friends for a benefice.

Est orare Ducum species violenta jubendi: The request of great men in high
places is a violent kind of commanding: he that comes thus to a living, in
their opinion, cannot avouche, that he came to it with a good conscience.

The fourth is, Sordidum obsequium, a base kind of service performed by a
Minister. As the devil confessed in the maid, he is the Servant of the high
God, the Ambassador of Christ, as it were Christ in the Church. Ye received
me, says Saint Paul, as an Angel of Christ, yea, as Christ himself: and it
is a shame for Christ, for Christ's deputy or vicegerent, that susteines his
person, to be too servile to any. To them may be replied, that Sentence of the
Apostle, If I labor to please men, I cannot be the Servant of Christ: and have
we not many, that by this base ladder climb up to the livings in the Church?
Heretofore Cornelius threw down himself at Saint Peter's feet; but now a
Peter, yet in truth a Pseudo-peter, throws himself down at the feet of a
mean Gentleman for a Benefice. This is a kind of Simonie, as the very
Schoolmen have affirmed, an horrible vice: he that is tainted with it,
cannot protest with Saint Paul, I have a good conscience in all things.

Saint Ambrose does excellently paint out this sin, I would to GOD all
Ministers would have his words engraven in their hearts. If thou come in by
Simonie, Caro suscepit dignitatem, anima perdidit honestatem: Caro dominatur
populis, anima servit daemonibus: Caro Sacerdotium comparavit, anima
detrimentum paravit: and what shall it avail a Minister to win the whole
world, and loose his own Soul? O it is a comfortable thing for a Minister, if
he may truly protest with the Prophet, I have not thrust in my self to be a
Pastor over this people, neither have I desired the day of misery, Lord thou
know; to be set over a people, to have the charge of many Souls, for the
which we must answer at the day of Judgment; if a man will faithfully
discharge his Office, it is rather a misery then a felicity: he shall have
many difficulties to wrestle withal. Every drunkard, fornicatour, adulterer,
etc. if his vices be ripped up, will be against him. Wherefore if thou have
thrust thy self into this misery, GOD will leave thee to defend thy self: if
thou have been thrust in by him, he will defend thee.

But as for this vice of Simonie, I will shut it up with those verses, which
were not amiss to be imprinted in the hearts of us all.

Haec duo damna feres, si tu sis Simonis haeres,
Mortuus ardebis, and vivus semper egebis.
These two losses shall thou bear, if thou be Simons heir,
A beggar live shall thou here, and after burn in hell feere.
Of the one, that for the most part they be beggars, all the world sees it: as
for the other, we shall feel it to our woe, if we do not repent.

So much for the good conscience which we must have from our entrance into our
places. Now let us come to the exequution of our calling being entered. Wherein
we must examine our consciences about two things, our preaching, and our life.
In our preaching must be observed the matter of our preaching, and the manner.

1. For the matter, let us with a watchful and circumspect eye see what we
deliver; what food we minister to CHRIST'S Lambs, what bread we break to
the people. Let there be nothing in our Sermons at any time, that is contrary
(...), as Saint Paul speaks, to sound, sincere, and upright doctrine. As
there was not a blemish, nor a soar by all probability in Absaloms body, from
the crown of his head to the soale of his foot: so let there be no blemish,
so far as is possible, no sore of corrupt doctrine, from the beginning of our
Sermons to the end. Let all be consonant to the Analogy of Faith, as the
Apostle speaks. Let us have never a drop of doctrine, but we are sure it
flows from the fountain of GODS Word. A lamentable thing it is to consider,
how many Preachers in the light of the Gospel, partly for the ostentation of
their own wit and learning, partly on an unstayed affection and unsettled
judgment deliver dangerous points, that make much hurly burly among the
people. Inter curas maxima cura est refraenare curiosos: they are to be
avoided, etiamsi nescio qua umbra honestatis and liberalium Studiorum nomine
velatae atque palliatae sint. O res indignas vigilijs, and lucubrationibus
Episcoporum, Aug. Epist. 56.

Deliver those things rather that may pierce the hearts of the people to
Salvation, then that which may tickle the ears of the people with a carnal
delight, and to damnation in the end. (...), as Nazianz. (...). As in a
Country Village, where be many Farmers to inveigh against Lords and
Landlords, in the ears of the people, to declaime against the vices of
Ministers in the Church, to lay open the blemishes of the state and
government: o this is as honey to them. A famous Preacher, a courageous
Preacher, I warrant you he cares for none.

Alas, what profit have the people by this? apply every plaster to every
soar. Speak that which may be most fit for the edification of that auditorie,
to whom thou speak. Labor to beat down Popery, Brownisme, which
sprouteth too fast: bring whom ye can to the Church, but scare none from the
Church, give no occasion by your preaching to run out of the gates of Sion.

Above all things in your Sermons have a Christian regard to the peace of the
Church wherein ye live, which as a loving mother reaches out to you the dugs
of the Word of GOD, which you may suck to your comfort. Pray for the peace of
Jerusalem, says the Psalm. and if we must pray for it, we must preach for
it. Therefore say I, preach for the peace of Jerusalem wherein ye live, that
we may see the peace of it, if it be the will of GOD, all the days of our
life. Of this preaching we shall have great comfort to our consciences.

2. Let us have an eye to the manner of our preaching. In it let us seek the
glory of our master, not our own glory. A great number of Preachers have more
respect to their words, then to the matter; to the sound of a syllable in the
ears of the people, then to the sounding of the trumpet of the Gospel in
their hearts. I will not deny, but that the man of GOD may be eloquent: the
Holy Ghost himself is most eloquent in the Scripture. He that has but half
an eye, may see that. Sedeloquentia, as Aug. speaks, Lib. 4. de doct. Chr. c.
13.
tanto terribilior, quanto purior: tanto vehementior, quanto solidior: it must
be senilis, not puerilis: Divinae, not humana. It is the foolishness of
preaching, as the world accounts it, that must save us, if any thing save us.
Crucifixi virtus in Paulo, says Chrysostom. fuit Poetis, Rhetoribus, Philosophis
potentior. Let there be a maternall eloquence in Preachers, such as becomes
the gravitie of the Word of God. As Hester that had beauty enough of her own,
required nothing of the Kings Eunuch, but went in to him as she was, and yet
she was better accepted of then they all: So the Word of God is beautiful
enough of it self, it needs no colors of over-affected eloquence and
Rhetorical painting to set it out withal: this goes but to the ear, it never
enters in the heart, where on the seed of the word shall fall: for the most
part it makes the Auditors to laugh and to smile in their sleeves: but, as
Saint Jerome admonishes us, lachrymae Auditorum lauds tuae sunto, it is a
greater commendation for a Preacher, to make the people weep being pricked in
their hearts for their sins, then to moove them to laughter? Let us all
strive to have a good conscience, even in the manner of our preaching: that
when the Sermon is ended, our consciences may bear us witness we sought Gods
Glory, not our own. Saint Chrysostom. cries out upon it, (...)! Vix ullus est
Sacerdos, qui ad eum non allidit: etiam hodie animus meus ab inani gloria
capitur. Let us all strive against it with might and maine.

For our preaching in the exequution of our office, that shall suffice: now let
us come to our life; which is either general, as common to all Christians; or
special, as peculiar to our selves. As all Christians are bound in conscience
to add to their faith, virtue, temperance, etc. to eschew all vices, that may
be a disgrace to the Gospel, and to embrace all virtues that may be an honor
to it; so especially the Preachers of the Word: Magistrum vitae in vita
offendere is a grievous thing, as the heathen himself could say, the offense
of a Minister is a double offense: quia peccat and facto and exemplo. Abimelech
said to his soldiers, As ye have seen me do, so make haste, and do the
like. If a Minister do evil, he need not say so to the people: they will
make haste to do the like fast enough. Nulli jam illicitum esse videtur quod
ab Episcopo tanquam licitum perpetratur. Ambr. de dign. Sacerd. c. 6.
Id homines credunt esse laudabile, quod Episcopus habuerit delectabile. If the
Minister be a drunkard, a frequenter of Tavernes, and Alehouses, etc. the
people take license thereby to commit the like sins. If covetousness were a
sin, would our Minister be covetous? etc. Thus he does not only sin
himself, but he makes others to sin. Therefore for conscience sake we had
need all to have an eye to it: tanquam in coelo peccat, Hom. dixit Petrus ad
Iesum.
says Saint Bern. Qui in Clero iniqua facit, sicut Angelorum judicium fuit
inexorabilius, quam hominum: ita Ministrorum gravius erit, quam Laicorum.
Therefore let us be types and examples of all goodness to our flocks: and as
we are called the light of the world; so let us be lights indeed. Let our
light so shine before men, that seeing our good works, they may glorify our
Father which is in Heaven.

Yet more particularly we must examine our conversation in that special
calling, wherein we be set. The weaver labors in the loome; the Merchant on
the sea, the husbandman is seldom from the plough: and our plough must in a
manner be always going, ever looking to GODS husbandry, that is committed to
us. Many there be that live honestly among their neighbors, and are good
housekeepers, but they neglect their Cure. I but innocens absque sermon
conversatio, quantum exemplo prodest, tantum silentio nocet, says Saint
Jerome. Episcopus est nomen operis. Saint Ambrose compares him to a Be, Lib.
6. de Sacer.
that is ever gathering honey out of the flowers of the Scriptures, Id
componens art oris sui, and delivers it to the people. Saint Chrysostom. is bold to
say: Necesse est Episcopum in singulos dies sementem facere, ut ipsa saltem
assuetudine doctrinae auditorum animi sermonem retinere possint. Be instant,
says Saint Paul, in season and out of season, so often as we can, for gifts of
mind and body. So often as the people can conveniently assemble together, let
the Ministers of the Lord cast forth the net of the Gospel, and be drawing of
some fishes to the shore of eternal life. Blessed is the servant whom his
Lord when he comes shall find so doing. To him He will say, come thou good
and faithful servant, enter into the joy of thy Master. O what an excellent
thing is it for a minister thus to affirm with Saint Paul, that he has kept a
good conscience in all things, in his entrance into the ministry, and in a
faithful, wise, diligent, and religious exequution of his office, to Gods
glory and the benefit of the people! such a one may sing for joy with the Swan,
when he is ready to depart out of the world. I have fought a good fight, from
henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the righteous
Judge will give me at that day.

It will play Ioab with us, it will say nothing while the fact is a doing: but
when it is done, it will cry alarm against us, he himself will be most
against us, as the man that left Absalom hanging, said of Ioab. Therefore as
Saint Augustine counsels us, let us obturare ei os in hoc mundo, ne clamet
contra nos in futuro: let us do nothing so near as we can, that may wound our
consciences in this life, that we may make a comfortable account in the life
to come.

Take heed of the thousand witnesses: nay, of the thousand armies, as Luther
calls it: If thou be arraigned of felony, murder, treason, at the bar of
an earthly judge, and but two witnesses come against thee, Lord have mercy on
thee, thou art gone: and how shall thou quake before the bar of GODS
tribunal seat, when a thousand witnesses shall step out against thee? then
there is nothing to be expected, but that fearful voice, go thou cursed, etc.

We of the Ministry are much subject to the tongues of men: we are set on an
hill, and the eyes of all are converted upon us. If there be but a little spot
in the face, it is quickly espied, and a great matter is made of it: yea, let
us walk as warily as we can, give no offense to any, yet men will take
offense; and the best Ministers, though living under the protection of a
gracious Prince, we may escape the claws of men, yet certainly not the best
of us all can escape the jaws of men: and let not that trouble us; for if all
could not give CHRIST a good word, some said he was a good man, others, nay,
but he deceives the people: then let not us think that be sinful wretches,
to have every man's good word. In all speeches and obloquies, let us have
recourse to our consciences, and hear what they say of us. If all the world
commend us, and our consciences condemn us, we can have no comfort. On the
contrary side, if all the world speak evil of us, and our consciences speak
good to us, we need not to care for any of them all. Let us remember that
worthy speech of a worthy Father, nec malam conscientiam sanat praeconium
laudantis, nec bonam vulnerat opprobrium criminantis. We are wont to say, if I
have GOD and the King on my side, I care for no man in England. So may we say,
if I have GOD and a clear conscience on my side, I care for no man in all the
world. The Papists say, it is unlawful for a Minister to marry. Some
Protestants say, it is inconvenient for Ministers to marry: and indeed their
maintenance being so small, it is so: yet for all that I say, it is both
lawful and convenient, nay necessary for all Ministers to marry; for all
without exception. But wot ye to what wife? namely to a good conscience. If
thou be married to her, if thou have her at home to comfort thee in the
house of thine heart, though thy living be never so small, thou shall live
marveilously well; yea, more at hearts ease then King Richard the third did in
his Kingdom: but if thou be a minister, and have a Xantippe at home, the
worm of conscience gnawing on thee, for they bad coming to thy Benefice, for
thy bad living in the same, si inde te eijcit fumus malae conscientiae, alas
poor man, whither shall thou go? will thou run away from thy self? whither
soever thou go, thou carryest thy conscience with thee, and that will keep
a yelling against thee, in domo, in foro, in mensa, in lecto, and in all
places. Wherefore let us all be assured, that we are at peace with our
conscience, that we have this loving Wife to cheer us up wheresoever we be:
what is our rejoicing, says Saint Paul, save the testimony of a good
conscience?

Let a man be lying on his death bed, let some say to him, remember man what
fair and beautiful houses thou have, what goodly Lordships, what lands and
possessions, what bags of silver and gold: remember in what credit, honor and
reputation thou have lived on the face of the earth: will this comfort him
think you? truly but a little. But if his conscience say to him, as Hezekiahs
did to him, remember that thou have walked before the Lord with an upright
heart, this will comfort him and make his heart to skip for joy in his belly:
recta vita esca conscientiae, a good life is the meat of the conscience. Live
well in thy calling, this is meat and drink to thy conscience: this shall
comfort thee at the hour of death.

When CHRIST had exhorted His Disciples to watching and prayer, because the day
of Judgment was uncertain: in the conclusion of His speech He turns Him to
the people and says, and the things I say to you, I say to all, watch. Even so
in the shutting up of this exhortation, that which I have said unto my brethren
in the Ministry, I say to you all, be all assured that ye have a good
conscience in all things. Let the Magistrate be assured, that he has a good
conscience: that he has winked at no sin for favor, nor punished any for
wrath, malice and displeasure: but as the Judgment is Gods, so he has
executed it with all good conscience. Let the father keep a good conscience in
a religious education of his Children, not suffer them to run at random, as
Heli did: but bring them up in the fear and nurture of the Lord. Let the
Master keep a good conscience in the usage of his servants, knowing that he
also has a Master in heaven. Let them that have the oversight of the Clergy
committed to them keep a good conscience in that office, looking always to the
maine point, the feeding of the flock of CHRIST. Let them use the Ministers as
Christ's Ambassadors, reverently, at least in regard of that heavenly person
Christ Jesus, whose person they sustain. Let the Proctors, Advocates, all
officers in the court be assured they have a good conscience in all things. Let
them not pill and pole, but be content with honest gains for their pains:
let them not make work for the enriching of the Court, when there need none.
Francis Spira an Italian, who himself once had been an advocate in such
Courts, complains of it, and his Conscience made an outcry against him for
it, when he dyed in desperation. Let all Christians in their places be
assured they have a good conscience in all things.

But the world, the love of money makes all to make shipwreck of a good
conscience. The Devil offered Christ all the Kingdoms of the world, to
worship him: but if he offer us but a groate or six pence, we are ready to
worship him. Money makes all, in Church and Common wealths to smother the
check, of conscience, to nip them in the head, and not to regard them: but
though we can put conscience to silence in this life, he will open his mouth
against us in the life to come. When we dye, as a father observes, we must
leave all books behind us. Saint August. works, Saint Basils works, the
book of the Court, yea and the Bible, the Book of books: but the book of
our consciences we must carry with us: and that when it is opened, shall either
accuse us or excuse us at that day: therefore let us look well to this book
here, let us examine it, as the Father wills us, let us confer it with the
book of life, let us put out all the blots that be in it, that it may speak
for us, not against us, at the dreadful day of judgment.

VERSE 19.
HIS suite is in this verse renewed: Abundans cautela nonnocet.

Restored: set at liberty, being now in bonds at Room.

Which shall be for your good.

Sooner: If it be Gods will, out of hand: not in respect of Gods purpose, but
in regard of outward impediments.

Saint Paul at this time was in Prison at Room, as the subscription of the
Epistle does intimate: His imprisonment was an hinderance to the Gospel;
therefore he earnestly requests their prayers for his restitution to his former
liberty. Saint Peter was in prison and irons between four quaternions of
Soldiers: earnest prayer was made by the Church for him. God sent His Angel,
and brought him forth. Pray earnestly for me; and I trust I shall be
delivered by your prayers. Let us pray for the Preachers, that the Word of God
may run and be glorified in all places.

VERSE 20.
IN the former part of the Chapter he commended to them many excellent duties,
of brotherly love, hospitality, constancy in the truth, obedience to spiritual
Governors: now because Saint Paul may plant, Apollos water, but it must be
GOD that gives the increase; he prays to GOD for them, to work all these
graces in them.

In this prayer. 1. The person to whom he prays. 2 The matter of it. verse
21. The person is described by a Title, and an effect: his Title is this, dator
and amator pacis. 2 Cor. 13.11. 1 Cor. 14.33.

Peace is an union of the hearts of men: men will never be at peace, if they
be not of one heart and one mind, as they were in the Primitive Church. Acts
4.32.
Now God alone rules in the hearts of men: therefore he only can make peace.

There is a double peace; the one between GOD and us, Romans 5.1. Luke
2.14.29. GOD is the giver of that: the other is a peace between our selves. 1
These. 5.13. wherewith God is greatly delighted: They be both herbs that grow
in his Garden, He is the God of them both.

We must be at peace one with an other.

1 We have a peaceable Prince, Isai. 9.6. therefore let us that be his Subjects
and Soldiers, be peaceable.

2 There is no one string in all the Scripture harped so much on, as this.

3 Without this we cannot see GOD. Hebrews 12.14. Blessed are the peace
makers, for they shall be called the Children of GOD.

4 Romans 12.18. It is to be embraced with all, much more with them that profess
the same Gospel with us. Owe nothing to any man, save love. Let us look to
discharge this debt unto all.

5 The Devil according to his name is a maker of debate. Satan signifies an
enemy: The enemy came and sowed tares. He is that enemy that sowes the tares of
dissension in the world. The Devil dwells in contention, as the Salamander in
the fire. Contentious persons are like the Devil, who sowes the seed of
contention between man and man: they that be of a wrangling disposition, that
are never well but when they have their hand in contention, are like Ishmael,
whose hand was against every man, and every man's against him.

They are not of God, but of the Devil: we have a peaceable GOD, let us be
like Him. My peace I leave with you, Ioh. 14.27.
says CHRIST. If we be right Christians, we will be at peace one with an other.

6 Peace is a credit to the Gospel, as contention is a discredit. Genesis 34.21.
So must we be peaceable. Pursue peace, and follow after it. Yet some run away
from peace: Let them be sent for to make peace, they will not come: they will
profess so much: a fearful thing! We have one Father, one Mother, one Elder
Brother, believe in one Savior, hope for one Kingdom: therefore let us be at
peace, let no jarres be among us. In the building of the Temple, the noise of
an hammer or tool was not heard: and let there be no knocking with the hammer
of contention among Christians, which are Gods house and Temple. Remember that
our God is a God of peace: let us be peaceable.

We have had the Title, now to the effect: the raising up of Christ from the
dead: elementia in collatione pacis; potentia in suscitatione filij.

The party raised is set forth, 1. By his Sovereignty. 2. By his Name. 3. By
his Office.

For his Sovereignty, He is our Lord. Ye call me Master and Lord. Not every one
that says to me, Lord, etc. He created us, He redeemed us, He has married us
to Himself: therefore we are to call Him Lord, as Sarah did Abraham.

For His Name, it is JESUS: the only SAVIOR of the world. There is no other
name whereby we can be saved, Acts 4.12.
but by the Name of JESUS. Moses was the giver of the Law: yet not he, but
Iosuah brought the people into Canaan: So they be not the works of the Law,
but Christ alone, that carries us into heaven, the celestial Canaan.

For His Office, He is the Shepherd of the sheep. Cyrus my Shepherd. (...).
Where observe, 1. What manner of Shepherd he is. 2. How he comes to be our
Shepherd.

If ye will know what manner of Shepherd he is, he is a great one. There be
little Shepherds, as the Rectours, Curates of every Congregation: but He is
the great Shepherd. 1. Great in the extent of the flock, the universal
Shepherd of the whole Church throughout the world, the Shepherd of Jews and
Gentiles: so is none but he.

2 Great in authority. The sheep are His, He ownes them. Simon, feed my
sheep, feed my lambs. Peter, as other Pastors feed them: but the sheep are
Christ's. Job had 7000. sheep: he had many Shepherds that kept them; yet the
sheep were Jobs. So Christ has many thousands of sheep in Christendom, in
the world. Sundry Shepherds he places over them: yet the sheep are Christ's,
not ours.

3 Great in the charge which he has taken on him: he is the Shepherd of
soul and body too: the great Shepherd of our souls. 1 Pet. 2. ult. He has
care of body and soul too.

4 Great in humility: the King of Kings; yet he abased himself to be a
Shepherd.

5 Great in knowledge. John 10.3.

6 Great in love and kindness: He gave Himself for the sheep.

7 Great in power: none can take them out of his hands. All the Devils in
hell, all the wicked men on the earth cannot cozen him of one sheep.

Be thankful to God for this great Shepherd.

Of whom? of the sheep, that is, the righteous.

They are most fitly resembled to sheep.

1 Sheep are humble. Learn of Me, I am humble and meek.

2 Sheep are harmless: be as innocent as Doves, as harmless as sheep.

3 Sheep are profitable, for back and belly.

4 They are ruled by their Shepherd: So whatsoever thou command us, we will
do.

5 Sheep are lead into pastures and folds.

6 They are obnoxious to many dangers: to Wolves, Briers, Theives, Psalm. 34.9.
Dogs. So many are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord delivers them
out of all. Happy are the sheep that have such a Shepherd.

But how came He to be Shepherd? Said the chief Captain, with a great sum
of money obtained I this burgeship. Acts 22.28.
But it cost Christ a greater sum, even His blood, whereby the everlasting
covenant is confirmed. Acts 20.28. The wine in the Lords Supper is a lively
representation of this blood. The wine is red; So was the blood of CHRIST: the
wine is powered out into the cup; So the blood of CHRIST was powered forth for
our sins. The grapes are pressed before there is any wine: So was CHRIST.
Wine comforts a man: he has given him wine to make him a glad heart. So the
consideration of the blood of Christ, that was shed for the remission of our
sins, is a singular comfort to the souls of Christians.

By this blood He came to be the Shepherd of the Church: and this is that
blood that ratifies GODS everlasting Covenant. The Covenant, I am thy GOD, and
the GOD of thy seed, is an everlasting Covenant. Such as the man is, such is
his bond and word. It is good dealing with honest men. A man may be bold to
build on their word. And such as GOD is, such is His Covenant: an everlasting
GOD, and an everlasting Covenant: of His Kingdom there shall be no end: and
of His Covenant there shall be no end. As He is our GOD now; So he will be for
ever. Let this stay us up when we are ready to faint, in all distresses.

This is that great Shepherd of the sheep, which GOD has brought again from
the dead. But was he not able to bring himself from the dead? Yes verily: He
raised up this Temple Himself, He presented Himself alive, Acts 1.3. Yet in
respect of His humanity, GOD is said to have brought Him from the dead: which
He did after a glorious manner; the Angels waiting on the Sepulcher, the earth
trembling, the graves opening, sundry of the Saints rising with Him and
appearing to many. Our Savior truly dyed on the Cross, (...). All the breath
went out of His body: it was wrapped up in linen clothes, laid in the
Sepulcher, there it continued three days and nights; yet God brought Him
again from the dead: He was seen of His Apostles and others; forty days
together; they beheld the print of the nails in His hands and feet, they eat
and drank with Him, and looked on Him, when He went into Heaven. Even so the
same God shall bring us again from the dead. The Head is risen; therefore the
members shall rise: the first fruits are in the barn of Heaven, therefore we
that are the second fruits shall be gathered thither. The husband is in Heaven;
therefore the wife shall be in Heaven. Where I am, they also that believe in
me shall be there: He brought CHRIST from the dead the third day; there was
an extraordinary reason in that; because His Sacred body might see no
corruption. Our bodies corrupted with sin must lie putrefying in the earth,
till the day of Judgment.

Adventus Domini clavis resurrectionis: then we shall meet CHRIST in the
air, and be translated with Him into His Kingdom of glory. Christ's
resurrection is a pledge of ours.

VERSE 21.
WE have heard of the person to whom he prays: now to the thing for which he
prays: It is perfection in all good works: the which is first set down: then
amplified.

It is comprised in these words: make you perfect, etc. He does not say, in
faith, but in works: works are a demonstration of faith: show me thy faith by
thy works. Except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the
Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of heaven. Their
righteousness was to say, not to do. Matthew. 23.3. ours must be, to say and
do too: else we shall not set a foot into the Kingdom of heaven. Not every
one that says unto me, Lord, Lord, etc. Therefore let us annexe works to
our faith. The Lord makes us perfect in works, that our election may be sure.

He does not pray to GOD to make them perfect in some good works, but in all.
As he said, homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto: So let us say,
Christianus sum, nullum Christianum opus a me alienum puto. Herod did many
things, but because he did not all, he was not saved. Here some trees bring
forth Pears, some Plumbes, some Apples, some Almonds: There is no tree that
brings forth all fruit. But every Christian must be as a tree planted by the
rivers of waters, that brings forth all fruit. We must be ready for every
good work: we must have prayers, and alms, deeds, zeal, meekness,
humility, patience, we must abound in every good work.

3 He does not say, the Lord cause you to begin in every good work, but God
perfect you, etc. We must labor to aspire to perfection daily more and more,
as Iac. 1.4. So let zeal, patience, etc. Let every grace have his perfect
work. Vsus promptos facit, use makes perfectness: scribendo disces scribere;
use thy self to writing, and in the end thou shall write well: use legs and
have legs; so use thy self to good works, and be perfect in good works. Milo
by using to carry a Calfe when it was young, did bear it when it was old: So
let us exercise ourselves in good works, from our youth, as the young man
says, at the length it will be easy to attain such a perfection as is
acceptable to God. Let us use our selves to pray, as Daniel did, morning and
evening. Let us use our selves to reading of the Scripture as the Bereans; to
Preaching, as Christ; to fasting, as Anna; to give to the poor and needy, as
Dorcas and Cornelius. At length we shall attain to some perfection in them,
etc.

This is amplified, 1. By the rule whereby our works must be framed, that is
the will of God. Christ said, not my will, but thine be done. So must every
Christian say, our will is to live at ease, to wallow in pleasures, Amos 6.
to take the Tabret and Harp, to eat the Calves out of the midst of the
stall, to rejoice with the instruments of Music. Our will is never to taste
of any misery, to have no losses, crosses, sickness: if possible, not to have
our finger ache. But let us entreat the Lord, that we may do His will, to say
with them. Acts 21.14. The will of the Lord be done. 1 These. 4. The will of God
is your sanctification. The Lord so perfect us to every good work, that we may
possess our vessels in holiness and honor, that we may serve Him in
holiness and righteousness all the days of our life.

2 It is amplified by the manner of our working.

That which is well pleasing in his sight: not for any worthiness of ours, but
through Jesus Christ, in whom God is well pleased with us: for without him we
can please God in nothing. Cain and Abel both offered Sacrifices, yet God was
pleased with Abel, not with Cain. The Pharisee and Publican, both prayed in the
Temple, yet the one was heard, and the other was not. Why? because one was in
Christ, not the other. Let us desire the Lord to accept of our poor and
imperfect works, for the worthiness of Christ, in whose name they are
presented to him.

He concludes with a doxologie, a song of praise and thankesgiving to Christ
the great Shepherd, which is God above all, blessed for ever, to him be glory
for ever and ever: He it is in whom we were chosen before the foundation of
the world, in whom is our life breath and being: He it is that in unspeakable
love came down from the palace of heaven into the dunghill of the earth for
our sakes, that vouchsafed to take flesh of a woman for us, to be borne in a
Stable, laid in a cratch, to endure the speaking against of sinners, to be
called Beelzebub, a bibber of wine, a friend of Publicanes and sinners, to be
blindfolded, buffetted, spit upon, cruelly whipped, to be pitifully nailed,
hand and foot to the Cross, to sustain the wrath of his Father, to dye, to
be buried, to rise again, to ascend into heaven, there making intercession for
us: therefore to him be praise for ever and ever.

He it is, that though he be absent in body, yet has not left us Orphans,
poor fatherless children: he has given us his spirit, to be a father to us,
to guide us into all truth, an heavenly Comforter, to comfort us in all
distresses, to seal us up to the kingdom of heaven: He has left us His Word,
the food of our souls, the sword of the Spirit to defend us from all enemies
of our salvation: He has given us the Sacrament of His blessed Supper as a
perpetual memory of him, wherein we may daily see him: the bread and wine are
as pledges of his body and blood, that we may eat him spiritually, be one with
him, and he with us. He it is that has given us his Angels to pitch their
tents about us, to take our souls at our dying day, and to carry them into the
kingdom of heaven. Therefore let us say with cheerful hearts, to him be
praise: worthy is the Lord Jesus the great Shepherd of the sheep, to receive
all honor and glory, praise, power and might, now and for ever, Amen.

VERSE 22.
1 AN admonition: Suffer the word of exhortation. 2. The reason: which is taken
from the brevity. In admonitions I have been brief: he spent but three
Chapters in them: therefore take them the more patiently.

Such is the pride and perverseness of our nature, we cannot abide to be told
of our faults: like gauled horses, we are ready to winch and kick at it.
Therefore this caveat is very needful: Suffer your selves meekely and quietly,
to be reprooved for your sins: Suffer the Preacher to tell you of your
covetousness, your pride, malice, etc. of your drunkenness, fornication and
adultery, of your negligence in coming to Church: of the little care that is
had for the good of the Town; every man is for himself, none for the Town.
Suffer your selves to be admonished of these things, it is good for you. Ye
suffer fools gladly, says Saint Paul: ye suffer stage players to tell you of
your faults, and ye laugh at it; and will ye not suffer Preachers? ye suffer
the Physician to give you sour potions, ye send for him and reward him for
it: and will ye not suffer the Physician of your souls to be sharp with you
for your salvation?

Ye suffer Chirurgions to cut you: and will ye not suffer us to lanch the
soars of your sins, that the corrupt matter may issue out? Suffer the words of
exhortation, and magnify God for them. Blessed be thou, and blessed be thy
counsel, said David to Abigail: So when the Preacher tells us of that which is
amiss, and exhorts us to goodness; let us not fret at it, carry a spite
against the Preacher: but let us say, blessed be thou, o man of God, and
blessed be thy Counsel, blessed be God that sent thee to us, etc. Thus we
should suffer even with thankesgiving the word of exhortation.

The reason is, because he has been brief in it. I have not been long
rubbing of your soars. I have told you of it in a word. Therefore suffer it
rather. Yet now adays some unwise hearers commend longitude: he stood upon it
long, again and again; he was an hour, two, three hours: peradventure he
might have spoken as much in a quarter of an hour. A wise and pithy brevity
should be more welcome to us, if we were judicious hearers. Suffer them that
wisely in a few words in the spirit of love and meekness, exhort you to that
which is good.

VERSE 23.
GOod news! He is set at liberty, that is, loosed.

Timothy: which by the mother is an Hebrew, Acts 16.1. he was in bonds
somewhere, though it be not expressed in (...) Scripture, for the which they
sorrowed: therefore he signifies (...) to them.

With whom if he come shortly, I will see you.

Why? he was in bonds at this time, Heb. 10.34. 1. He might (...) there bonds
past, not present. 2. This may be spoken with a ^^cret condition, understood,
though not expressed: If I be de^^vered too.

When we hear of the deliverance of our brethren out of any ^anger, we should
be glad of it. If the foot be delivered of a ^orne that was in it, the head
rejoices at it. We are members (...) of an other, let us rejoice at the
deliverance one of another. Do (...) hear that any was greivously sick and
is delivered? let it do (...) hearts good. Do we hear of the delivery of any
Christians (...) of the hands of the Turks, Papists, and other enemies of the
^ospell? let it be joyful and acceptable to us. To this end would (...) have
them to take knowledge of Timothies deliverance: and so ^ould we do.

VERSE 24.
WHom they should salute. 2. From whom they should receive salutations.

1 Their Spiritual Rulers and Governors: then (...) whole body of the Church.
Not only they in Rome, but in all ^ie, that profess the Gospel of CHRIST.
Salutations are (...) of love: now the Ministers and Preachers of the Word are
be love above common Christians: we should have them in sin^^r love for their
work sake: therefore they are to be saluted (...) others. If ye send
Commendations to a Town, especially member the Minister. Salute all, unless
they be professed ene^^es to CHRIST, and the Gospel; bid them not then God
speed. ^therwise salute all, but chiefly them that have the oversight of
(...) people: they must have the first place in our salutations.

VERSE 25.
HE concludes with a blessing. The grace of our LORD JESUS CHRIST: that is,
the love and favor o^ Christ, be with you all. Amen.

Even so in the shutting up of this Epistle do I take my leav^ of you. Many
excellent points of Doctrine, many necessary an^ profitable exhortations have
been delivered to you out of it: it (...) even the body and marrow of
religion. Now the Grace of GO^ be with you. GOD give you grace from His
Spirit, to think on them, to practice them, to His glory in this life; that ye
man be partakers of His everlasting glory in the life to come. Amen.

A COMMENTARY UPON The second Epistle of St. JOHN.
VERSE. 1.
THat these two Epistles be S. John's, as well as the former, the similitude of
style and of affection does evince: the style is S. John's, and they be written
with S. John's affection.

The three Epistles differ thus. In the first he entreats of the love of God,
and our neighbor jointly together. In the second of that to God more specially
by it self. In the third of our love to our neighbor more particularly.

The first was written to all Christians in genreall: the second to a woman:
the third to a man.

The parts of this Epistle are these. 1. The inscription of it. 2. The contents
of it, verse 4. The inscription conteines a description, in the 2 former
verses, a precation in the third. In the description. 1. He describes himself
which is the writer. 2. The persons, to whom he writes: he describes himself
by his office, The Elder: the persons, to whom he writes, are the mother and
the children. He describes the mother severally. 1. By her inward estate,
elect. 2. By her outward, a Lady. He describes them both jointly together by
his entire love to them: which is first averred, in regard of himself. 2.
Enlarged, in regard of others: in this verse. 3. Illustrated by the procreant
cause of it in both, verse 2.

[ THE ELDER]

THere was another called Johannes presbyter, John the elder, to whom some
ascribed both these Epistles. So writes Hieronymus de viris illust: yet he
himself is not of that opinion. Nay citing a testimony out of these Epistles,
he does in plain terms attribute them to S. John the Evangelist. Epist. 85.
Clangat tuba Evangelica, filius tonitrui, quem Jesus amavit plurimum, qui e
pectore salvatoris doctrinarum fluente potavit. Let the Evangelicall trumpet
sound, the Son of thunder, who from the breast of our Savior drunk in
abundantly as it were rivers of heavenly doctrine.

He does not entitle himself an Apostle, but an Elder. 1. Because he speaks
not with authority, like an Apostle, but talks with her familiarly, Ambros.
Cathar.
as a father with his daughter. 2. Because he was known throughout all Asia,
after a kind of excellency by the name of Elder.

He has the title of an Elder, 1. for his age, in outliving all the Apostles.
2. for his Wisdom, that commonly accompanies old age: the Senate was termed
(...), an assembly of ancient men. 3. for his grave and discreet carriage. 4.
and chiefly for his office in the Church: Ministers are usually called elders.
St. Paul left Titus in Creta to ordain Elders in every City. The Elders that
rule well, Tit. 1.5. 1 Timothy 5.17.
are worthy of double honor, (...) a young plant, may not be made a minister;
but (...) a young man may. Though he be a young Timothy, yet he is an Elder,
and to be honored for his office: much more the reverend Prelates of the
Church. Joseph. antiq. lib. 11. cap. ult.
Alexander the mighty Monarch did great honor to Iaddus the high Priest.
Constantine the religious Emperor esteemed highly of the Bishops at the
Council of Nice, he made them his (...) and (...), Eusebius. de vita Constable. lib.
1.
he would have them sit down by him, and placed them at his own table;
Valentine the Elder called Ambrose his father. Ambr. de vita valent. Valentine
the younger, though an Arrian, rose up to him in token of reverence, when he
came into the consistory. No doubt, but this Laay honored John with her heart:
so ought we to do the Elders of the Church: If they be contemned, the word at
length will be contemned.

That for the writer: now to the persons to whom he writes, the mother and her
children.

Origin speaks somewhat contemptibly of women. When Christ came into the
coasts of Tyrus and Sidon, Behold a woman, Mat. 15.22. In Mat.
Mira res, Evangelista, a strange thing, O Evangelist! Behold a woman, that is,
the author of transgression: the mother of sin: the weapon of the Devil:
the cause of our expulsion out of Paradise. I but Christ honored women, in
lying in the womb of a woman: he appeared first to women after his
resurrection, Mat. 28.7.
and made them Apostolos apostolorum, Apostles to preach his resurrection to
the Apostles.

Paul preached to women. There have been women of special note. Sarah the
Mother of the faithful. Act. 16.13.
Hester the nurse and preserver of the faithful; women that ministered to
Christ of their own substance: among whom was Ioanna the wife of Chuza, Luc.
8.3. Clem. Alex. strom lib. 1. Laert.
Herod's steward. Theano Crotoniatis was a Philosopher and a Poet too.
Pythagoras learned his natural Philosophy of his sister Themistocleas.

Ignatius wrote to two women; the blessed Virgin Mary, and Maria Cassabolita.
Cyrillus, Alexandrinus, Basil, Chrystome, Ambrose, Augustine, Fulgentius:
Bernard wrote to women: Hierome wrote to many, to Salvina, to Faria, to
Agoruchia, to Celantia, Asella, Marcellina: most of his works he dedicated to
Eustochiam a noble and worthy Virgin. S. Paul wrote to Apphia, Philem. 2.
and S. John here to a woman.

The mother is first severally, by her self described, then both of them
jointly together, by his singular love to them all. She is set forth, 1. By
her internal and spiritual estate, she was elect. 2. By her external and
worldly estate, she was a Lady.

Some of the Popish interpreters will have her name to be elect, to the Lady
Elect. 1. That is a saucie transposing of the Greek words, it is not (...) to
the Lady Elect, but (...), to the Elect Lady. 2. As S. John does not set down
his own name, no more does he hers. 3. The same title is given to her sister,
verse ult. and no likelihood that two sisters should have one and the same
name; there was not so great a penury of names. Elect is nomen appellativum,
non proprium, a noune appellative, not a proper name.

First she was a Lady, a Widow by all probability, else S. John would have
made some mention of her husband. She was magna and nobilis domina, a great and
a Noble Lady, says Lyra, she had an ample family, she was an entertainer of
the Preachers and professors of the Christian faith. Catharinus supposes she
had a Jurisdiction, she was a Lady of some Towns, Mannours and Lordships.

The unlearned Anabaptists use that place as an hammer to beat down all the
seats of superiority. In Christ neither bond, Gal. 3.28.
nor free, Jew nor Grecian, Male nor female: we are all one in Christ Jesus.
True indeed we are all one in Christo, but not in Mundo, as S Augustine does
well distinguish, in Christ there is no difference: but in the world there is.

Men and women are to be respected according to those places of honor,
whereunto God has advanced them in the world, whether they be Kings or
Queens, Lords or Ladies. Christ makes an honorable mention of the Queen of
Shebah. S. Luke dedicates his Gospel and the history of the Acts to Noble
Theophilus. To the most noble governor Felix, says Claudius Lysias. Most
Noble Festus, Act. 23.26. Act 26.25.
says, S. Paul; here S. John gives the virtuous woman the title of a Lady,
whom God has honored, let us honor too. It is he that sets up and pulls
down, according to his heavenly pleasure, otherwise we shall be (...),
fighters against God, as G^maleel speaks. Yea though the persons be bad:
Act. 5.39.
yet the places are to be respected: and they in regard of their places.

But this was a good, an holy and religious Lady; an elect Lady, most interpret
a select Lady, egregia, an egregious Lady, a grege segregata: separated from
the common sort; a famous and illustrious Lady. But I see no reason why it may
not be expounded according to the native signification of the word, it is well
translated in the English, The elect Lady, Elect in Gods eternal Counsel, as
S. Peter called the strangers, dispersed through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, 1
Pet. 1 1 and 2.
Bythinia, Asia, Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father. S.
Paul salutes Rufus, that was elect and chosen of the Lord, Romans 16.13. He
speaks of Clement and other his fellow laborers that their names were written
in the book of life, Philip. 4.3.

She had learned Christ, as the truth is in Jesus, she had a lively faith in
Christ, she had a demonstration of her faith by good works, by them she made
her calling and election sure; therefore he pronounces her to be one of Gods
elect, we must judge of the salvation of others, by their love and charity. It
becomes us, says S. Paul, Phil. 1.7:
so to judge of you all; he was far more charitable than they that judge none
shall be saved, unless they be of their own stamp, and go to such a Lecture
and Sermons as they do.

Now he writes not to her alone, but to her children too, To the Elect Lady and
her Children, by nature and by grace too, as Aquinas speaks, children, both
men and women, but the women were Virgins, says Lorinus; because they were at
home with her: so were the men-children too.

As he made great account of the mother, so of the children too, the proverb
is, love me, and love my dog: much more love me, and my children, we will
pray for the Kings life, and for his sons, Ezra 6.10:
say they. So S. John here salutes the mother and the children too.

Upon this he makes a testification of his love to them, which is first averred
in respect of himself. 2. amplified in regard of others. 3. Illustrated by the
procreant cause of love in them all verse 2.

Touching himself he pronounces with an ardent affection, whom I love, in the
Greek it is (...), the which men or women I love: how? in truth, for in the
Greek it is not (...), with an article, in the truth, but (...) in truth, that
is, truly, unfeignedly. Let love be without dissimulation. Romans 12.9.
There is too much dissembled love in the world. Love one another, says Saint
Peter, with a pure heart unfeignedly. 1 Pet. 1.22.
A kiss is a token of love: For the which cause, it was an use in the
Primitive Church for Christians to kiss at the celebration of the Supper,
says Saint Chrysostom. But, De companct. cordis. lib 1.
as he complains many does it with the lips only, ac si in scenares
ageretur, as if they were on a stage. Valentine being an Arrian kissed Ambrose,
Ambr. Epist. 27.
but he reproved him for it, Quid oscularis eum, quem non agnoveris? Why do
thou kiss him, whom thou carest not for? Greet one another with an holy
kiss. Love not in word and tongue only, but indeed and truth. Romans 16.16. 1
Ioh. 3.18.
Ioabs health, and Judas kiss are too frequent. Let us love truly as Saint
John did.

Having averred it for his own part, he does amplify it on the behalf of
others. Not I only. It might joy her, that he loved her, being the disciple
whom Jesus loved; but it must needs be a greater joy to her, that all did love
her: Yet it is with a restraint, all that have known the truth revealed in the
Word, for thy Word is truth, says Christ. All that have known it, Ioh. 17.17.
he speaks De notitia approbationis, as Aquinas does well interpret it, of the
knowledge, not of speculation, but of approbation, that approve, love, and
embrace the truth; for indeed they that be of the household of faith, are lead
by one and the same Spirit; therefore where one loves, all love.

But is this so great a matter to be loved of all? Woe be to you, when all men
speak well of you, true; when all tag and rag, Luke 6.26.
good and bad speak well of us: For then we should be happier than Christ
himself was, he could not have every man's good word. Some said he was a good
man, others nay, but he deceives the people, All did not love him, but all the
godly, ^ohn 7.12.
all that loved the truth, and where they love, God himself loves, therefore
we are to rejoice in the love of the faithful.

VERSE 2.
THe last is the procreant cause of this love. Where first there is the
Loadstone, that drew this love. 2. The permanencie of this love, in regard of
the foundation whereupon it is built, for the truths sake, truth lasts for
ever, so shall this love do. They did not love her, because she was an
honorable Lady, a beautiful Lady, etc. but because of the truth of the
Gospel, that had taken firm root in her heart.

Some love for pleasure, Isaac loved Esau, because Venison was his meat that
was his delight. An adulterer loves an harlot, Genesis 25.28.
for the satisfying of his filthy lust. Some love for profit, they love their
friends as they do their cowes, horses, and grounds, for the benefit they
reap by them. Genesis 34.2.
Some love for beauty; so Shechem loved Dinah. Some love for honor and
promotion, in hope to be preferred by such a great man. All these stand upon a
tickle ground, pleasure vanishes, and that quickly too; then love vanishes
together with it. 2 Samuel 13.15.
When Amnon had gotten his pleasure of Tamar, he hated her more, than before he
loved her. Riches betake themselves to their wings, as Solomon speaks, and
fly away, then love flies away too. If a rich man become a poor man, we set
not much by him. Honor is mutable; the nail that is now aloft, is in the
dirt, as it fell out with Haman, then he is little regarded of any of his
followers. Beauty fades away like a flower, then love fades away too; love for
the truths sake, for Christ's sake, for the Gospels sake, and that will be a
permanent love.

But what is this truth? Is not that changeable? No verily. For (as Aquinas
does well distinguish) though fides, In hunc locum.
qua creditur, cease when we be in heaven: yet fides quae creditur, shall be
in heaven, though justifying faith cease, for we shall not need to believe
in Christ any longer, when we shall see him face to face. Yet the doctrine of
faith which we believe touching eternal happiness purchased by Christ, shall
remain when we be in heaven, the truth shall be with us for ever.

VERSE 3.
THat shall suffice for the description: now to the precation; Where 1. There
is the blessing prayed for. 2. the persons frow whom. 3. An addition made to
those blessings. The blessings prayed for, are three, grace, mercy, peace;
these be with you. In the Greek it is (...), shall be with you, but the future
is put for the imperative, (...), for (...), be with you, and abide with you
forever. Aquinas does thus distinguish them, Gratia culpam delens, Grace wiping
away the guilt of Sin, Misericordiam poenam indulgens, mercy remitting the
punishment of sin; Pax Deo reconcilians; peace reconciling us to God: rather,
Grace is the root, the undeserved love and favor of God, by which we are all
that we are. 1 Cor. 15.10.
By the grace of God, I am that I am: Without him we are nothing, the other are
the branches budding from it. Mercy, which has reference to our manifold
miseries. Peace, arising of our reconciliation to God by Christ, Being
justified by faith we have peace with God. Romans 5.1.


The persons from whom. First, from God the Father, as the Author of all
goodness; Every good gift comes from above, form the Father of lights, etc.
Then from Christ the Son of God, Iam. 1 17.
and the Mediator of mankind, who is, 1. The Lord, the Lord and King of the
Church. 2. Jesus, a sweet Savior, that has saved us from our sins. 3.
Christ, the anointed King, Priest, and Prophet of the Church, the Son of the
Father. Therefore God as well as the Father; Where then is the holy Ghost?
Saint Augustine, will have him to be comprehended in the gifts; for we can have
no gift but by the holy Ghost, In Romans 1.
the destributer of them. Or as Aquinas says, the holy Ghost is understood in
the other two persons, being nexus utriusque, he sacred bond that unites them
together. 1 Cor. 12.4.


The blessings annexed and added, are truth and love. Caietan with some others
refer them to Christ, the Son of the Father in truth and love, that is, his
true and beloved Son, they be rather to be adjoined to the former, and (...)
is put for (...), with truth, i. the virtue of truth and love to God and man,
these make a demonstration of the former to the world.

VERSE. 4.
NOw let us enter into the bowels of the Epistle.

The matter of it is a gratulation, and an exhortation verse 5. First he
praises her for the time past, then he does incite her for the time to come,
the gratulation is expressed by a joy, wherewith he was ravished, where. 1.
There is the greatness of his joy. 2, the object of his joy. 3. the rule for
the ordering of it.

I rejoiced, Christians may be joyful, Rejoice in the Lord always, again I
say rejoice. At that time, Jesus rejoiced in his Spirit, Philip. 4.4. Luc.
10.21.
(...), he danced as it were for joy, as here Saint John rejoices in his
Spirit, and not a little but greatly too. As the wise men rejoiced with an
exceeding great joy, Mat. 2.10.
when they found Christ. So he rejoiced with a great joy, that he found of her
children walking in the truth of Christ, there is the object of his joy.

That I found, by diligent observation, when I was at thy house, and by the
constant relation of others since.

Of thy Children, not all, but some of them, seldom are all good; Adam, had a
Cain: Noah had a Cham: Abraham had an Ishmael: Isaac had an Esau. This
collection do some make, but this is not necessary, he might find them all
good in external carriage and behavior, he goes no further; but how did he
find them? not sitting still, but walking, in what? not in falsehood, but in
truth, that is, in the truth of the Gospel, embraced, professed, honored by
them, in framing their lives too according to the truth.

This does argue the great care of this worthy Lady, in the virtuous education
of her children, which is to be imitated by all fathers and mothers. If we
have a piece of ground, we will bestow cost and pains in the manuring,
tilling, and sowing of it. If we have a young horse, we will be at charge to
bring him to a good pace; and shall we neglect our children? Children are the
inheritance of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is his reward* and shall
we reward the giver so unkindly, Psalm. 127.3
as not to give them education? Which consists in three things: religion,
learning, manners and behavior: touching the former, David and Bathsheba
joining together in seasoning the tender years of Solomon, with the sweet
liquor of celestial piety, by the means of Hannah Samuel came presently a
mamma corporali, Prove. 3.3.4. Chrysostom. hom. 2. de fide Anna 2 Timothy 3.15.
ad mammam spiritualem, from the corporal to the spiritual dugge. Eunice
taught Timothy the holy Scripture from his childhood.

Hierom would have Laeta to teach her daughter Paula the Canonical Scriptures,
ad Laetam.
beginning with the Psalms, and ending with the Canticles, the Psalms as the
easiest and sweetest: the Canticles as the hardest.

To this end chatechizing is very requisite; Clemens Alexandrinus was a
chatechist, Luc. 1. Psalm. 34.11. Heb. 6.1. Hebr. 5.13.
Theophilus was Catechized.

David chatechiseth children.

There is a form of catechizing, and some principalls of religion specified,
and that has the appellation of milk, which is fit for children: There were
catechumenoy in the primitive Church, which must say their Catechism before
they were admitted into the Church. The Church of England has a compendious
and faithful catechism in the book of Common Prayer, which if it were
diligently taught, and effectually learned, both young and old should be better
acquainted with the principles of religion, and being wisely done, would be
more profitable than preaching without chatechizing, for want whereof many that
run to Sermons, have been found to be very ignorant of the maine principles
of religion.

For education in learning, Pharaohs daughter trained up her adopted son in
all the learning of the Egyptians: Act. 7.22. Clem strom l. 4. Hier. ad Laetam.
Aristippus that famous Philosopher was (...), taught by his mother, the
eloquent tongue of Cornelia was a great means of the eloquence of the Gracchi
her two sons. Hortensius his eloquence grew up inter paternos sinus, in the
bosom of his father and mother.

If we cannot, nor have leisure to learn them our selves, let us put them
forth to learning, provide fit teachers for them. Iehonathan and Iehiel men of
understanding were with the Kings Sons 1 Paral. 27.32.

Iehoiadah taught King Ioash, Saint Paul had Gamaleel to his Tutour, 2 Reg.
12.2.
a Doctor of the Law: Philip procured two Schoolmasters for his son
Alexander, Plut.
Aristotle for his teacher, Leonides for his directer and informer. Constantine
he procured three several Tutors, for his three several sons, one for
Divinity: the other for the Civil Law: Eusebius l. 1 de vita Constable.
the third for military discipline.

Concerning manners and behavior we must bring up our children (...) in
instruction and information, that may formare mores, frame their manners, and
put a good mind into them, as the word imports. When Diogenes looked upon an
unmannerly boy, that eat his meat rudely, he gave his master a box of the
ear, because the fault was (...), Plut. virtus ducetur. Dial. l. 4. cap. 18.
not in the Scholar, but in the master. Gregory writes of a man well known,
but names him not, who had a son to whom he was too indulgent, when any
thing crossed him he was wont to curse and blaspheme, his father never
corrected him for it. It fell out that he dyed blaspheming in his fathers
arms, and the Devil was seen to carry him away, we are to have a diligent
circumspection over the behavior of our children, when they be young: to
keep them from swearing, lying, pilfering, and other vices, least they grow up
with them, when they be old: they be flexible in their young years, prove
inflexible afterward: While the wax is soft, ye may set a good impression on
it, as well as a bad, the print of a Dove as well as of a vulture: when it is
hard, ye cannot, ye may safely bend a young plant: so can ye not an old tree:
let us have a care of them while they be young, least they and we repent
afterward when it is too late. Naboth would not give the inheritance of his
fathers to Achab: 1 Reg. 21.3.
children are inheritances given us of God, and shall we through our negligence
give them to the Devil? let us tread in the steps of this renowned Lady, give
our children the best education we can every kind of way.

We have had the greatness of his joy, together with the object of it, then
comes the rule for the squaring of their walking, wherein he rejoiced.

Not according to our own brains, or after the traditions of men, but as we
have received a Commandment from the Father in holy Scriptures: This is his
Commandment, that we believe in his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another.
1 John 3.23.


Thy word is a light to my feet, and a Lantern to my steps, this is the light
after which we must walk. Psa. 119.105 Ephesians. 2.10 Mat. 5.16. Ephs. 5.8.
God has ordained good works, that we should walk in them. Let your light so
shine before men, that seeing your good works, they may glorify your father
which is in heaven: walk as children of the light. It is not a Council, which
we may follow if we will, it is a Commandment that must be obeyed, not from a
master, but from a father, and all children must obey their fathers
Cammandement.

VERSE. 5.
THe other branch of the matter of the Epistle is an exhortation or an
admonition, where 1. he does exhort to love in special. 2 to constancy in the
truth in general, v. 6. in the exhortation, 1 there is the manner how it is
introduced 2. the delivery of it being introduced. It is introduced after a
most kind and lovely manner: as Saint Paul had authority to command Philemon:
so Saint John had authority to command the Lady: Philem. 8.
yet they do both rather beseech: we might come with a rod, yet we had rather
come in love, 1 Cor. 4.21.
and in the spirit of meekness, as Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did
beseech you through us, we pray you in Christ's steed that ye be reconciled to
God, 2 Cor. 5.20.
if we can prevail any way with you we are glad.

Having made a way for it, he delivers it, where 1, there is a commendation of
the virtue, whereunto he does exhort. 2. a nomination of it. 3. an explication
of it, in the former clause of the 7 verse.

It is commended 1. by a negation of the newness of it. 2. by an affirmation
of the oldnesse of it. New things are suspicious, and not readily entertained:
Marc. 1.27.
What new doctrine is this, say they of our Savior: the Philosophers at Athens
came flocking about Saint Paul, Act. 17.19.
saying, May we not know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speak is?
Tertullian calls Marcion hesternum, a bird of yesterdayes hatching: so is not
this: It is no new commandment.

John 13.34.
Yet Christ calls it a new one. A new Commandment give I unto you, that ye love
another. It is both new and old, old ratione substantiae; Aquin.
new ratione circumstantiae: old in regard of the substance; new in regard of
the circumstance. 1. because being corrupted by the glosses of the Pharisees,
Mat. 5.43.
it was purged and made new as it were by Christ; as a rustie sword, if it be
scowred is a new sword. 2. because it is pressed by a new example, the example
of all examples, John. 13.34.
the example of Christ himself: Even as I have loved you. 3. Because it should
never wax old, but be always fresh and new in memory and practice. 4.
Because then it lay hid in the dark and obscure mint of the old Testament; now
it comes out of the fresh mint of the new testament. It is now delivered, and
made known to the world, more apertly and plainly, than before, a picture
done over with new colors is a new picture.

The newness of it has been disclaimed, now the oldnesse of it is
proclaimed, that which we had from the beginning of the creation, of the
promulgation of the law, or from the beginning of our conversion and calling to
Christ, howsoever it is old, written in codice cordis, in the book of our
heart, by the pen of nature: and in codice legis, in the book of the law
published to the world.

To put us out of doubt he names it, That we love one another. 1. Love is eum
complementum legis, the fulfilling of the law. It is (...), a recapitulation of
the whole Law. Romans 13.9, 10
He that has love, keeps the Law: He that wants love is a continual breaker
of the Law. 2. Love is indicium Christianorum, the badge of Christians. Hereby
shall all men know, that ye be my disciples, if ye love one another. No love,
no disciple of Christ. John 13^35.
3. It is condimentum omnium virtutum and actionum; the sauce that seasons all
virtues and actions, without that they be all unsavory. If I speak with the
tongue of men and angels, if I had all knowledge, all faith, 1 Cor. 13 1.
that I could remove mountains, if I fed the poor with all my goods, gave my
body to be burnt, yet if I have not love, I am nothing. Though we come to
Church never so diligently, hear Sermons never so frequently, receive the
Sacraments never so devoutly, discourse of Religion never so eloquently, yet if
we have not love, we are nothing. Let them be Baptized in the name of Christ,
says Augustine, De doct. Christ. l. 3. c. 10.
let them sign themselves with the sign of the Cross, let them answer Amen,
sing Halleluja in the Congregation, let them go to Church, yea, let them make
Churches, yet if they have not love, they are not the Sons of God, but the
sons of the devil. What an admirable thing is love? If we have that, all
things are well had, if that be wanting, it is in vain to have all things.
Quanta est Charitas? quae si desiit frustra habentur caetera: Si adsit recte
habentur omnia, Aug. in pirmam Eppst. Joan. 4. Love is vinculum perfectionis,
the bond of perfection; this ties us together; We are as shaves scattered, Col.
3.14.
without love. 5. It is Sigillum electionis, a seal of our election; 1 John
3.14.
Hereby we know, that we are translated from death to life, because we love the
brethren; He that loves not his brother abides in death. No assurance of
salvation without love. 6. God is love, 1 John 4.16.
says Saint John; a golden sentence. Saint Paul in his whole Chapter of love,
1 Cor. 13. Spoke not so much in the commendation of love, Aug in Epist. Joan.
as Saint John does in this one short and pithy sentence; The devil is hatred.
Of that he has his name Satan, an hater; and all spiteful and malicious
persons are of the devil, all loving men and women are of God.

Many allurements to make us in love with love; yet sincere love is as a
stranger among us; Rara avis in terris, a black Swan upon the earth. Where is
there a Damon and a Pithias? Scant two neighbors in a Town, that entirely
love one another; yet never a page almost in the Bible, but one way or other
harpeth on this string. When Saint John was so old, that he was feign to be
lead to the Pulpit, he went up spoke, these words sundry times, Hierom. in 6.
cap. ad Gal.
My little children, love one another, and so came down, as if that were the
most necessary thing to be inculcated to the people, and so it is indeed.

VERSE 6.
IN the winding of it up he gives us a touchstone for the trial of love. John
14.15.
This is love, that we walk after his commandments. Whereof this is a maine
and principal, to love one another, according to that of our blessed Savior:
If you love me keep my Commandments. If the subject love his Prince, he will
observe his Statutes as near as he can: If a friend love his friend, he will
do what he requests him, if he may lawfully do it; and it be in his power. If
a child love his Parents, he will obey his Parents in the Lord. How can we say
we love Christ, when we cast his commandments behind our backs?

Now there follows the other branch of the exhortation to constancy in the
truth, which is 1. propounded, then corroborated and urged, verse 7.

Deuteronomy. 18.18. Mat. 17.5.
This is the Commandment (...), that commandment (...), after a kind of
excellency. I will raise you up a Prophet like to me, him shall ye hear. This
is my beloved Son, hear him.

This commandment he does illustrate by the antiquity of it, as ye have heard
from the beginning. How? the Rhemists say, by tradition from the Apostles,
which is come to us from man to man, from Bishop to Bishop. Heresies may go
from man to man, from Bishop to Bishop, 1 Cor. 4.6.
as Arianisme did, and in a short time overspread all the world. It is a
manifest argument of infidelity, and a sure token of pride says Basil, (...),
to reject that which is written, and to bring in that which is unwritten.

This is the commandment, that as ye have heard from the beginning, by God
himself, The seed of the Woman shall break the head of the Serpent: Genesis 3.
Ephesians. 2.20.
Which is explained at large in the Writings of the Prophets and Apostles,
whereon the Church is built. That having set our hand to Christ's Plough, we
should never look back, but continue with him to the end. That this is the
native meaning of it, is apparent by the words following, wherein he
corroborateth his exhortation. For many deceivers are come into the world,
which will supplant you if they may, therefore walk on steadfastly in the truth.

VERSE 7.
1. HE warnes them of false teachers. 2. He arms them against them. verse 8.

In the warning: 1. There is a signification, that they become. 2. A mark,
whereby to know them being come. 3. An application of that mark: For the
former. 1. There is the quality of them that be come; they be (...), planing,
subtle, cheating, deceitful fellows, they will deceive you with fine words,
and nise distinctions. 2. Here is the quantity of them: They be not a few, but
many: Many Bears, many Lions, many Foxes. If they were but Waspes, and Bees,
yet being many, they might scare us, and make us circumspect; much more these.
3. They be not to enter, but are already entered. 4. Into this wicked world,
which is a receptacle of good and bad.

I will give you a mark, whereby ye shall discern them. They confess not,
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, and so subvert the very foundation of
Christianity.

There be diverse kinds of them. Some deny that Christ is come in the flesh at
all, as the obstinate Jews, whose eyes the god of this world has blinded.

Some confess him to be come in a kind of flesh, De Carne Christi, and
advers. Marcionem lib. 3.
yet not in true, but in fantastical flesh, as Marcion; whom Tertullian
eloquently confuteth. 1. The Angels appeared in true and solid flesh. Abraham
washed their feet; they took Lot, his wife, and two daughters by the hand,
and lead them out of the city; and do ye think, that the Son of God, would
dissemble, and deceive the world with fantastical flesh? 2. He was borne of a
woman, he did not pass through a woman as water through a channel. Gal. 4.4.
He came not out of her womb transmeatorio, Adver* Valentinianos. Luke 1. Aug.
in Joan. c. 2.
but genitorio more, not as one, that passed through her, but as one that was
begotten of her. The fruit of her womb, ut homines nascerentur ex Deo, primo
ex ipsis natus est Deus. That men might be borne of God; God was first borne of
men. We are commonly borne of a man and a woman. He was singularly borne of a
woman without a man. 3. If his birth were fantastical, then his death was
fantastical, then they are not to be blamed that killed him. 4. If his
humanity was fantastical, then we may justly imagine that his Deity was
fantastical too. Tertul.
Quomodo verax habebitur in occulto, qui fallax repertus est in aperto? How
shall we believe him in that which is secret, when he was deceitful in that
which is open.

Again. Some confess him to have a true body, but no soul: Mat. 26.38. Luke
23.46.
as Apollinaris. His Deity supplied that, whereas he says, My soul is heavy
even to the death. Father into thy hands J commend my Spirit.

But let us acknowledge with thanksgiving to his Majesty, that he is come in
the flesh. God manifested in the flesh, seen of Angels, 1 Timothy 3.16.
believed on in the world, ascended into glory. Worthy then is the lamb, Apoc.
5.
that was borne and killed for us, to receive all honor and glory, praise,
power and might for ever. Aug. in Evan. Joan. tract. 31.
Magna misericordia Domini nostri Jesus Christi. Great is the mercy of our Lord
Jesus Christ. Factum esse eum propter nos in tempore, per quem facta sunt
tempora, that he which made time, would be made for us in time: that he which
made man, would be made man, least that should have perished, which he made.

Then he applies the mark to them before mentioned, This is a deceiver and an
Antichrist.

But why does he change the number? Why does he not say, these be the
deceivers, and Antichrists? Catharinus supposes he does it to point out the
devil, qui est verus, primus and maximus Antichristus, who is the true first
and chief Antichrist, that needs not, the alteration of number is frequent
in all Authors.

There were many Antichrists in the Apostles days; as forerunners of that
great Antichrist in time to be revealed. That shall sit in the Temple of God,
and exalt himself above all that is called God. 2 Thessalonians. 2.


VERSE 8.
HItherto he has warned them of false teachers: now he arms them against
them. 1. He wishes them vitare errorem, to eschew their errors. 2. Fugere
communionem, to fly their communion and society. verse 10, 11. In the former,
1. The Caveat, then the reasons, the caveat, look to your selves, and look
narrowly too, with both eyes, with all the circumspection you can: Romans 14.7.
We must look to others too, For no man lives to himself; none must say with
Cain, Am I my brothers keeper. We must look to our brethren too, Romans 14.12.
yet first and principally to our selves; because every one of us must give an
account of himself to God. A traveller must look to him that travells with
him, but chiefly to himself; we must rather be (...), then (...), 1 Pet. 4.15.
Bishops over ourselves, then over others: that is condemned by S. Peter; yet
some there be that spend more time in other men's Diocesses than in their own,
in looking to others, Beda.
than to themselves, Multi multo sciunt, and scipsos nesciunt, alios
inspiciunt, and seipsos negligunt: Many know much, and know not themselves,
they look upon others, and neglect themselves.

This caveat he does enforce by 4. Reasons. 1. A damno, from the loss. 2. A
praemio, from the reward, in this v. 3. Ab incommodo, from the disco^moditie.
4. A commodo, from the commodity, in the next.

He does not say [ ye] but we, including himself in the number: the best of
us all have need to be vigilant, that we lose not the things for which we have
wrought; namely the joys of heaven, for the which we have wrought by prayer
and fasting, by reading of Scriptures, by hearing of Sermons and divine
Service, by a patient suffering of diverse afflictions, and shall we now
through negligence lose them? We must work for the meat that endures to life
everlasting. We must not be idle, not unfruitful in the excellent knowledge of
Jesus Christ. John 6.27.
We must work for heaven, 2 Pet 1.8.
not to purchase it, that has Christ done with his own precious blood, but to
confirm it to our selves. Go work in my Vineyard: Work out your salvation
with fear and trembling. Mat. 20.6*
But let us so work, that we loose not our working. be faithful to the end,
and I will give thee, the crown of life: Ye are they that have continued with
me in my temptations, Apocal. 2.10.
therefore I appoint to you a Kingdom. Without continuance, Luc. 22.28.
no Kingdom: A traveller loses his labor, though he have gone 40 or 50 mile,
if he go not on to the end of his journey. Mariners lose that which they have
wrought, unless they work till they come into the haven. Runners lose the
gold, unless they run to the end of the race: So run that ye may obtain:
hold that which thou have, that another take not thy crown: 1 Cor. 9. Apoc. 3*
11. Epist. 254.
Ibi tu christian fige cursus tui meta^, ubi christus posuit suam, says Ber.
There O christian, set down thy staff, Phil. 2.8.
where Christ set down his factus est obediens usque ad mortem, he was obedient
to the death: so be thou, Luc 17.32.
remember Lots wife, she turned back and was turned into a pillar of salt, ut
nos omnes condiret, that she might be as a salting tub, to season us all. In
Jacobs ladder the Angels were ascending and descending: none were standing.
They that traveile by a wood full of thieves, had need to look to themselves,
least they lose their purses, we are among many spiritual thieves, that will
rob us if they can of the precious pearl of celestial doctrine, therefore let
us look to our selves, that we lose not the things which we have wrought.

The second argument a praemio, from the reward: Let us look to our selves,
not only that we be no losers, but that we may be gainers too; that we may
receive a full reward. Why then, they that begin well and continue not, shall
have some reward, half a one, though not a full one? Mat. 6.2.
Resp. 1. They may have a reward among men in this world for a season, the
praise of men: but they shall miss of that eternal reward in the world to
come. 2. the particle ( full) has reference, not to the workers, but to the
reward, it is a complete, a full reward, fullness of glory in soul and body,
At his right hand is fullness of joy for ever; the rewards we have here are
Semiplena, half full, this is plenum, wholly full: Psalm. 16.11.
Hic jugulantur haeretici, says Catharinus, qui mercedem bonorum operum
negent: here the heretics throat is cut, which deny the reward of good
works, he fights with his own shadow, he seeks a knife, where there is no
throat to cut, for we that be Protestants, acknowledge a reward for good
works, and we embrace that Axiom of Bellermines. It is lawful to do good
works intuitu mercedis aeternae, de ^ustif. lib 5 c. 8.
with an eye to an eternal reward reposed for them. Moses chose rather to
suffer adversity with the children of God, Heb. 11.25.26.
than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, why? because he had respect
to the recompense of the reward, (...), he looked from the aflictions to the
reward. Our Savior for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross,
Heb. 12.2.
and despised the shame, so may the members of Christ do, yet not tantum and
praecipue, yet not only for that, nor chiefly for that, but that God may be
glorified by our works: in Evang. Io. t^act 1.
Nolo ad praemium diligere Deum, says Saint Augustine, do not love God only,
so far as thou may be rewarded, and no further. Ipse sit praemium tuum,
Gen 15.1.
let him be thy reward. I am thy exceeding great reward. de justif. lib. 5.1, 2.
Nevertheless we disclaim that Axiom of Bellermines, that merces and meritum
are relatives. Merces and opus be relatives, a reward and a work, but not
merces and meritum, a reward and a merit. God rewards our works, yet not for
any merit in them, Luc. 17.10.
but for his own mercy: For when we have done all that we can, we are
unprofitable servants, for we have done no more than we ought to do, a debt
can be no merit, all that we do is a debt: Thou have entered into a bond, to
pay an hundred pound, thou payest it, do thou merit by it? An Apprentise
serves his master well, during his Apprentiship; does he merit by it? he was
bound by obligation to do it.

2. No free gift is a merit, eternal life (...), the free gift of God: Romans 6.
ult. Luc. 12.32.
fear not little Flock, it is your Fathers pleasure to give you a Kingdom;
it is given, we do not merit it, let every one of us say with Berniard,
meritum meum misericordia tua, my merit is thy mercy.

But there is a reward even from our lame, weak, and imperfect works, Psalm.
19.11.
in keeping of them there is great reward, not only a reward, but a great
reward too: wherein God deals with us as a kind father with his children,
he allures us with rewards, and that makes the work more easy, as Basil
speaks (...), as the consideration of the end of his journey, refreshes the
travellour, the expectation of gain, that encourages the merchant, and the
spoil the soldier. Let us look up with the eye of faith to this reward, and
it will be a Noah to comfort us in all our labors in this veil of miseries.

VERSE 9.
THe third argument, ab incommodo, from the great discommodity that ensues
upon it: Whosoever of what quality and condition soever,

Transgresses that holy commandment of persevering in the truth which we have
received from the Father, This is my beloved Son, hear him, and none but him:

Act. 4.12.
And abides not, firmly and unmoveably

In the doctrine of Christ, the sole Savior of the world, For there is
Salvation in no other, John 5.29.
and this doctrine is contained in the Scripture. Search the Scriptures, they
they be that testify of me.

Has not God, that, is his favor in this life, nor shall he partake of his
glory in the life to come, he has not God: and so consequently he has the
devil, therefore is in a most lamentable case.

The fourth from the commodity.

He that abides constantly to the end, in the doctrine of Christ, revealed in
the Word, he has both the Father and the Son, John 14.9.
for they are inseparable, they go together, he that sees the one, sees the
other: and he that has the one, has the other, neither is the holy Ghost
excluded, for the Father and the Son dwell in us by him, therefore it
stands us all in hand to shut up our ears against false and erroneous
teachers, and to persist in the doctrine of Christ delivered unto us, Be no
more children, wavering and carried about with every wind of doctrine, Ephesians.
4.14.
by the deceit and craftiness of men. What went ye out into the Wilderness to
see? a reed? Luc. 7.23. 1 Pet. 2.5.
we must be stones, not reeds, and ye as living stones, says Saint Peter.

There be 4 principal pulbackes from the Doctrine of Christ, the, 1. is the
glosing tongues of heretics, by their fair speeches and flattering they
deceive the hearts of the simple. Romans 16.18.


The second is ease, master, pity thy self, it is good sleeping in a whole
skin: now thou go whether thou will, Mat. 16.22.
if thou embrace Christ and his Gospel, thou shall be shut up in prison; now
thou eatest and drinkest of the best: and farest deliciously every day, then
thou shall be fed with bread and water, now thou lie soft, in fine bedding,
but then thou shall endure more hardness, for thou shall lie in straw, or on
the bare boards which is worse. I but look into the 12 of the Acts of the
Apostles, and the 6 verse, and there you shall see how Saint Peter being bound
with two chains, between two soldiers, slept more soundly, than many do on
their beds of down. And again, in the 16 chapter of the Acts and the 25
verse. And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sung praises unto God: they
sung more merrily in prison, Eusebius. hist. Eccles. lib. 8. cap. 9.
than many Kings can do in their Palaces. There were diverse Martyrs Noble
men borne, and exceeding rich, that had no pity of themselves, nor their wives
and children neither, but exposed them to all torments for Christ's sake. A good
conscience is a continual feast, no joy to that, 2 Cor. 1.12.
what is our rejoicing save the testimony of a good conscience.

The third is honor and preferment; Number. 24.13.
but in that let us not be worse than Balaam, Balack offered him great
promotion: but, says he, If the King would give me his house full of silver
and gold, I cannot pass the Commandment of the Lord. The devil offered
Christ all the Kingdoms of the world, Mat. 4.
and the glory of them, yet he refuses them: What advantageth it a man to
win the whole world, and lose his own soul? Let us not lose Christ's
everlasting Kingdom for these transitory good things.

The fourth is persecution, confiscation of goods, bonds, imprisonments, Act.
21.13.
death, against all these, let us pluck up Saint Paul's courage. I am ready not
only to be bound, but to dye for the Name of the Lord Jesus. Ignatius went
joyfully to the Lions: Policarpus to the fire: Laurentius to the gridyron:
admirable was the boldness of Basil, the governor threatened to strip him of
his goods, as for that says he, I have nothing but (...) a torn gown and a
few books: I will put thee to death, death, says he, shall be (...) a
benefactor unto me, it shall send me to endless joys; well, said the
governor, thou art very stubborn, consider better of the matter, and give me
thy answer to morrow; says he, (...), I to day and to morrow am the same man.
Let us all be of his magnanimous resolution, let not our lives be dear to us,
so as we may fulfill our course with joy. Christ said to the twelve, Will ye
also go away? To whom should we go? says Saint Peter, in the name of the
rest, thou have the words of eternal life.

Let us love Christ as dearly as Ruth did Naomi, Entreat me not to depart
from thee, Ruth 1 17.
I will live and dye with thee, instead of a life of a span long, we shall have
a life that endures for ever.

VERSE. 10.
HItherto he has wished her to avoid their errors; now he does advise her to
eschew their company. 1. Non participando in facto, not participating with
them in deeds. 2. Non participando in verbo, not participating with them in
words verse 11.

If any come unto you they be shameless fellows, they will not tarry till
they be sent for, they will come of their own accord, and intrude themselves.

What any without exception? nay, and bring not this doctrine, namely of
Christ, but the contrary rather.

Receive him not into your house, why? this seems too great incivility, they
might receive him, and when they perceived that by him, turn him out again: I
but, Turpius eiicitur, quam non admittitur hospes, ye shall have more ado to
eject him, than to keep him out at the first, shut up the doors of your house
against him. It seems, that as Gajus was the Churches Host: so this Lady was
the Churches Hostess, her house was open to the Preachers and Professors of
the Gospel, but he warns her not to receive corrupt teachers. 1. It is a
thing displeasing to God, to give entertainment to his enemies. Iehu the seer
reproved King Iehoshaphat for joining with Achab: Would thou help the
wicked, and love them that hate the Lord? 2 Paral. 19.2.
God gave us our houses, they must be for his friends and not for his enemies.

2. The godly will be grieved at it, and shall we grieve them, 1 These. 5.22.
for whom especially Christ died? 3. It may bring a bad report of our selves,
that we like of them, and approve them, whereas we ought to abstain from all
appearance of evil, and provide things honest before God and men. 4. It may
endanger our own souls. 2 Cor. 8.21. 2. Tim. 2.17.
For their word fretteth as a canker, It may overrun us and infect us, ere we
be aware. 5. It may encourage them in their wickedness. 6. It may pull Gods
wrath on us and our houses; God blessed the house of Potiphar for Joseph's sake,
Genesis 39.5. 2 Reg. 4 17.
and the house of the Shunamitish woman for Elishaes sake. His curse will light
on those houses where the adversaries of his Gospel are harbored. When Saint
John heard, that Cerinthus the Heretic was in the bathe, says he, (...). Let
us fly least the Bathe fall on our heads? Yet what a number be there, Eusebius
E^cles. Hist. l. 4. c. 14.
whose houses are receptacles for Seminaries, Priests, and Jesuits, and other
Sectaries? Ahabs house was for Baals Priests: But Constantines Palace was for
godly Bishops and Ministers, Eusebius. de vita Constant. l. 4.
and he thought their prayers to be the pillars of his house, and indeed they
were.

Then for participation in words. Where 1. The prohibition. 2. The reason of
it, verse 11. Neither bid him God speed. Be so far in showing him any
kindness in deeds, as vouchsafe him not a kind word or greeting. The Grecians
used two words in their salutations. (...) and (...). Rejoice and do well,
celse gaudere, and been rem gerere, Albin^vano, as the Poet said.

Here is (...). Wish him no joy, no comfort, vouchsafe him not a good word, or
familiar speech, show no token of familiarity to him.

VERSE 11.
HE renders a reason of it. For he that bids him God speed, is partaker of
his evil deeds. Apocal. 18.4.
And if we be partakers of their sins, we shall be partakers of their
plagues.

Salutation is a sign of love. We may not love them. Therefore not so much as
salute them. Marcion asked Saint John, if he knew him. Yes says he, agnosco te
primogenitum Satanae. Eusebius. l. 4. c. 14* Eusebius. l. 7. c. 3.
I know thee to be the first borne of the devil. They are the devils brood.
Therefore salute them not.

Dyonisius Bishop of Alexandria, would not vouchsafe (...) to Samosatenus the
Heretic.

Some more nise than wise, more rigid than solid, will not bid any God speed in
the high way side, least they be partakers of their evil deeds, not knowing
where about they go.

1. In doubtful matters, it is the property of love to interpret the best:
for love is not suspicious; it thinks not evil. 2. We may bid the man God
speed, though not that where about he goes, unless we certainly know that
he goes about some mischief.

These are not much unlike them, that except against the Letanie, in the book
of Common prayer, because we pray for all women laboring of child, all that
travel by land or water; then we pray for Harlots, for Pirates, for Thieves.
Touching harlots, we pray for the seed, not for the sin. The son of an
harlot may prove a good man, Judge. 11.1.
and a great man, as Iephthah did; as for Pirates and Thieves, we pray not that
God would prosper them in their Pyracie and theeving, but that God would give
them repentance for their sins.

But Saint John's meaning is that we should not salute them familiarly, as we
use to do the Saints of God, and the brethren in Christ, but rather show a
detestation of them and their doctrine, as they be our enemies, we ought to
love them, and may salute them; but as they be Gods enemies, we must hate them;
Do not I bate them, Psalm. 129. 21.
O Lord, that hate thee? yes, I hate them with a perfect hatred. Aug.
Yet we must always distinguish, inter creaturam Dei, and creaturam diaboli:
inter id quod Deus fecit, and quod diabolus fecit. Romans 13.
Owe nothing to any man save love. We must love the nature which God made, hate
the evil which the devil made.

VERSE 12.
THe conclusion, consisting of an excuse and a salutation, 13. he excuses the
brevity of his writing. 1. A multitudine rerum scribendarum, from the multitude
of things to be written. 2. A modo scribendi, from the manner of writing. 3. A
spe veniendi, from an hope of his coming.

I have many things to write to you; Many weighty things, which if I should go
about to co^prise in a letter, it would grow to too great a volume; there is a
time to speak, and a time to hold our peace; a time to write; and a time to
cease from writing; a time to preach, and a time to leave preaching; est modus
in rebus, there is a measure in all things. Some can find no measure, neither
in writing, speaking, nor preaching.

I would not write with paper and ink; they be corruptible things, they
quickly wear away. Letters may miscarry, they may fall into the hands of our
enemies; they may be misconstrued, and no present apology can be made.
Questions and doubts may better be discussed by voice, Eccles. 12.12.
than by writing. There is no end of making books; and much reading is a
weariness to the flesh. This has been an excess in all ages. Basil. Epist*
74 Laer^
Apollinarius filled the world with books; Chryfippus wrote 71. books* Origin
wrote 6000. books, as Epiphanius records: Few of them are now remaining; yet
many delight to write with Paper and Ink, the Presses are oppressed, this is a
scribbling age wherein we live. Scribimus indocti doctique Poemata passim, All
love to write: learned and unlearned too.

The third excuse for his short writing, is an hope of his presence and
colloquie, face to face. Where 1. There is the pillar, whereupon his coming
leans. 2. The end of his coming. The pillar whereupon his coming leaned,
was a trust he had in God. I trust to come to you. When? Some say in his
Visitation, when he went to visit the Churches, as Paul and Barnabas did. Act.
15.36.
Then he would take her house in his way, yet it may be he would make a set
journey to her. Howsoever he does not peremptorily say, I will come to you
shortly: but I trust to come unto you, Women, they say, have many lets; but I
am sure men and women too may have many lets in journying. We would have come
to you, 1 Thessalonians. 2.18.
I Paul at least once or twice: but Satan hindered us. The devil may lay
blocks in our ways. Let not him that girdeth his harness, 1 Reg 20 11.
boast as he that puts it of; Multa cadunt inter calicem supremaque labra.
Many things happen between the cup and the lip. So do many things between
our setting forth and our coming home; a wall may fall upon us, as it did upon
27000 Aramites; 1 Reg. 20.30.
sickness may apprehend us by the way, as it did the young man of Egypt; we
may fall into the hands of thieves, as he did; Death may arrest us by the way,
as it did Rachel. Whereupon Saint James wittily taunteth them, that say, To day
or to morrow we will go to such a city, buy, sell, 1 Samuel 30.13. Luke 10 30.
Genesis 35.18. James 4.13.
and get gain; whereas ye cannot tell, what shall be to morrow; therefore the
godly speak with a limitation; if God permit, if God will, and if we live, I
trust, says John.

What then when he is come? Not to write my mind with paper and ink, but to
speak face to face. Mouth to mouth, 1 Cor 16.17^ James 4.15
my mouth to thy mouth, and both our mouths ad obstruendu^ os haereticorum, to
stop the mouths of Heretics, that set themselves against Christ. Writing is
vox mortua, a dead voice, speaking, is vox vivida, a lively voice; habet quid
latentis energiae, says Hierom, Ad Paulinum.
and de ore loquentis fortius sonat, it has a kind of hidden power and
efficacy in it, and a stronger sound out of the mouth of the speaker.

If the officers had seen some of Christ's writings, they would have been
ravished with them: but much more with his voice, the voice is a shrill trumpet
to waken one another. As iron sharpencth iron, so does man sharpen the face of
his friend. John 7.46. Prove. 27.17.
When the voice of Mary sounded in the ears of Elizabeth; the babe sprang in
her belly for joy. So when we hear the voice of our friend, it infuseth a kind
of joy into us. A man writing, is like one that plays at tennice alone,
mutual speaking one with another, is as two playing together, they toss the
ball more cheerfully one from another. Writing may breed doubtings, but
speaking resolves doubts. It is a sweet thing to speak one with another.

The end of his coming was, that their joy might be full: Not with quaffing
and swilling, but by a Christian talking one with another. In writing, there is
but a half joy; in mutual speaking there is a full joy: Sermo est index
animi, the speech is a glass, wherein we may behold the mind; by that we may
freely open our minds one to another, more freely than we can by writing.
Paul longed to see the Romans, Romans 1.12.
that he might be comforted together with them, through their mutual faith,
both theirs and his. So Saint John was desirous to come to the Lady, for the
reciprocal comfort of them both: That they might rejoice in the spiritual
growth one of another.

There is much joy in the meeting of friends, as there was when Moses and Aaron
met in the Mount, Exodus 4.27. Exodus 18.7.
for joy they kissed one another. So did he and Iethro, asking one another of
their welfare. There was great joy between Epaphroditus and the Philippians,
Phil. 2.
When they saw him that had been but as a dead man come to them again. There
was singular joy, when this Lady and St. John met together. Let us praise God,
that we live in peaceable days under the protection of a gracious and
religious King, that we may come joyfully one to another; yet the joy of these
meetings may be dashed sundry kind of ways; and though they be never so full
of joy, yet that and the meetings themselves have an end. Let us prepare for
that meeting, 1 These. 4.17.
when we shall meet Christ in the air, and abide with him for ever, never to
depart any more.

VERSE 13.
THe other part of the conclusion is a salutation sent to the Lady. The
children of thy elect sister greet thee.

Here Lorinus to avoid that absurdity, that two sisters should have one name,
insinuates that the (elect) here maybe cognomen, not nomen, Acts 1.23.
a surname not her proper name: as Joseph's surname was Iustus. I but there is
no surname set down without the name premised, therefore this is a mere
shift. Her sister is called elect in the same sense that she was, because of
faith and other graces of the Spirit that were in her as signs of her
election. Did not her sister send greeting to her as well as her children? It
may be her children were now with St. John, for their further instruction, so
was not the mother. They should have used a more reverent term, their duty or
service to be remembered to their Aunt. It is too familiar to send salutations.
Not only equals did salute, but inferiors too: Ruth 2.4.
the reapers of Boaz saluted him, but inferiors salute after a more submisse
manner, though it be not expressed. Touching salutations look the Epistle to
Philemon.

Amen. Between the former words and Amen, Aquinas interserts these: Gracia
tecum, Grace be with thee. Then Amen has indeed something to answer to; but
those, says Catharinus, are not in correctis libris: The old translation has
them not. Amen here may have reference to the meeting before mentioned. Amen.
So be it. God grant it may be so.

A COMMENTARY UPON The third Epistle of St. JOHN.
VERSE. 1.
THe parts of this Epistle are these. 1. An entrance into it. verse 1 and 2. 2
The matter contained in it verse 3. an entrance is made into it by an
inscription v. 1. by a precation v. 2.

The inscription points out the party writing, and the party to whom he
writes: the person writing is described, as before, by his office, An Elder, a
chief governor in the Church. For a more ample discussing of it, the reader
is to be referred to the former Epistle, verse 1. The person to whom he
writes, is set forth by his name: and by the special love Saint John bears
to him: Whereof there is first an expression, Welbeloved: then an explication
how he loves him, in truth.

His name is Gajus, some collect out of the seventh verse. that he was a Jew;
as if he were opposed to the Gentiles that be there mentioned, yet not he, but
they that came from him, whom he entertained, are apposed to the Gentiles. By
his name he should rather be a Roman; for Gajus or Cajus is a Roman name, G
and C are commutable letters.

To let all conjectures pass, there be three of this name in Scripture. Gajus
of Macedonia, Act. 19.29. Gajus of Derbe, Act. 20.4. Gajus of Corinth, 1 Cor.
1.14. Whom Paul baptized, whom he terms his Host, the Host of the whole
Church, Romans 16.23. By all probability this was he, who continued his
hospitality to Saint John's days. Christ says of the woman that powered
ointment upon his head; Wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached throughout
all the world, Math. 26.13
there shall also this that she has done be spoken of, for a memorial of her:
The memorial of the just shall be blessed, Prove. 10.7.
but the name of the wicked shall rot. Origin by dedicating most of his books
to Ambrose a wealthy Noble man, which was his Patron: and Hierome by doing the
like to Estochium a renowned Virgin, and bountiful to good uses, continue the
remembrance of them to all ages, and the fame of Gajus shall last, so long as
the Epistle of Saint John lasts, this should be a spur to others to the
like.

This Gajus was deep in Saint John's books, and in his heart too, he calls him
his Welbeloved, he gave not this title to the Lady to whom he wrote; some say
to avoyde suspicion of familiarity with her, Romans 16.12.
being a woman, a frivilous excuse: for Saint Paul calls Persis and Apphia
beloved, Philem. 2.
without any fear of that.

Others suppose because it was too familiar, and did not agree to the dignity
of a Lady, what needs all this? he gave her a more magnificent title, when he
styled her Elect, this was a singular comfort and honor too to Gajus, that he
was beloved of such a worthy man as Saint John, The Disciple whom Jesus loved.

Then he makes an explication of his love, whom I love in the truth, that is,
truly and unfeinedly: See more. 2 John 1.

VERSE. 2.
THe other part of the entrance is a precation or wish: where 1. an inculcation
or repetition of his beloved, that he might have the greater assurance of it;
and because there might seem to be some defect in the former sentence, here
he makes a supply of it, I wish unto thee.

2. An enumeration of the blessings wished, prosperity and health which are
illustrated, 1. by the priority, or eminency of them above all things. 2. by
an argument a pari, of the like in his soul.

The vulgar translation renders it, I pray, which all Popish interpreters
follow, we will not stick with them for that, praying is a kind of wishing:
and wishing is a kind of praying.

Above all things in the Greek it is (...), of all things, but (...) is put
for (...), before all things: therefore says Catharinus, for mine own part I
would have translated it prae omnibus, or ante omnia: before or above all
things: of such importance they be.

But let us take a view of them. 1. that thou may prosper, (...), that thou
may take a good way, go well, a metaphor from travelers, Romans 1.10.
S. Paul prays (...), the same word that here is used: that he may have a
prosperous journey to the Romans, from thence it is translated to all
prosperity whatsoever:

So Saint Paul uses the word. Every first day, let every man put aside, as God
has prospered him, (...), 1 Cor. 16.2.
and we use to say in our common speech, How does such a one go on? that is,
how does he prosper?

I wish that thou may prosper, in thy children, in thy servants, in thy
sheep, in thy cattle, in thy corn, in thy wine, in all things appertaining to
thee. Worldly prosperity is a singular blessing of God, which he often
bestows on his children. It is said of the godly man, Psalm.112, 2.
riches and treasures shall be in his house: the Lord blessed Abraham
wonderfully, Genesis 24* 35.
that he became great, he gave him sheep and beeves, silver and gold, Camels
and Asses, men servants and maid servants, Genesis 13.14.
he had 318 in his house that were able to encounter with the enemy. Isaac
waxed mighty in a strange country, increased and was exceeding great, he had
flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, Genesis 26.13.
and a great household; even so much as the Philistines had envy at him. Jacob
with a staff passed over Iordane, Gen 32.10.
but returned with great substance.

God gave to Solomon that which he asked not, 1 Reg. 3.13.
riches and honors, 1 Reg. 10.26.27.
so as among Kings there was none like him in all his days, he had 1400
charrets, and 12000 horsemen; he gave silver in Jerusalem as stones, and
Ceders as wild figtrees. Job had 7000 sheep, 3000 Camels, 500 yoke of Oxen,
Job. 1.3.
500 she Asses, insomuch as he was the greatest man in all the East-Country.
Hester of a poor banished maid, fatherless and motherlesse became a Queen.
Daniel was made the third man in the Kingdom: he plucked Joseph out of
prison, and made him ruler of Egypt, he took David from the sheepe-coates,
and sent the Scepter of Israel into his hand.

All that the just man takes in hand shall prosper: Psalm. 1.3.
here S. John wishes that Gajus may prosper: so we are, if it stand with Gods
good liking to wish to all our friends, for then they have greatest opportunity
to honor God, and to do good to others.

Indeed prosperity sometimes proves hurtful: Prove. 1.32.
Ease slays the foolish, and the prosperity of fools destroys them. Psalm.
91.7.
It is said a thousand shall fall at thy side; and ten thousand at thy right
hand, that is, as Saint Bernard interprets it, a thousand fall in adversity,
which is as the left had: but ten thousand in prosperity, which is the right
hand, and as Galen observed, plures occidit gula, quam gladius, surfeiting and
drunkenness, has killed more than the sword. In adversity we are humble: in
prosperity we are proud: in adversity we pray: in prosperity we play: in
adversity we seek God, in prosperity we forget God. All the while that David
was in persecution and in wars, he was a chaste man: when he came to take his
ease, and to walk idly on the roof of his palace, 2 Samuel 11.2.
then he was caught in the snare of adultery. Solomon was drowned in the Ocean
of his prosperity. Solus in divitiis fuit: Hier. ad Estoch
and solus egregie corruit, None swim in such a Sea of riches and honor as
he did: and none suncke more egregiously than he did, they stand upon slippery
places, and they slip ere they be aware, therefore we had need be suitors to
God, especially to keep us in prosperity.

Yet if it hurt, the fault is not in it, nor in God that sent it, but in our
selves that abuse it, as if a friend should give a man, a brave and excellent
sword, and he should kill himself.

As for his estate he wishes that he might prosper: so for his body he wishes
that he may be in health, which in it self is an invaluable jewel. Sed
carendo magis quam fruendo, we know not how to prize it, but when we want it.
1. When a man is sick, he can do nothing so well as in his health, we cannot
pray so well, pain draws us away, we cannot read, we cannot go to Church,
we cannot follow the works of our calling so conveniently, we cannot visit
our friends, Luc 1.
as the Virgin Mary did Elizabeth. 2. Sin pulls sickness upon us, because all
have sinned, all are sick at one time or other, in some measure or other:
Behold he whom thou love is sick. John 11.
S. Augustine, malleus haereticorum, the hammer of heretics, was so bruised
with the hammer of sickness, that he could neither walk, stand, nor sit. But
God in mercy has provided remedies for it, learned and expert Physicians, the
virtue of sundry herbs and simples, to restore us to health again. 3. A
sick man is a prisoner, confined to his bed or house, a man that has his
health is at liberty to go where he will, 1 Cor. 7.
yet in the Lord. 4. What is wealth without health? Nec domus, Horat.
aut fundus, non aeris acervus and auri: Aegroto domini deducunt corpore
febres: though thou had the riches of Croesus, yet they could not rid thee of
an Ague: so displeasing is sickness, so pleasing is health: therefore if it
be the will of God, let us wish it to our selves, and to our friends too.

This is illustated a pari, from the like in his soul, thy soul prospers
well, that grows up in the graces of the spirit: so prosper thou in thy
estate, and in health of body, here is a lively description of a happy man in
this life, a good outward estate: and men's sana in corpore sano, a sound mind
in a sound body.

The soul is the principal: animus cuiusque est quisque, the soul is the
man, the soul is the workman, the body the tool wherewith he works: the
soul is a spirit, the body a lump of flesh: the body is from the earth; the
soul from heaven: the body we have by mediate generation of our parents, the
soul by immediate infusion from God: they are the fathers of our bodies; but
he is the Father of spirits: Hebr. 12.9.
the body is mortal and dies: the soul immortal and lives for ever: the
body when we be dead, lies by the walls as a thing of no reckoning, is put into
the grave among worms: the soul is taken up by the Angels, and carried into
Abraham's bosom, yet generally we are all for the body, nothing for the soul;
that shall be well clothed, that shall fare daintily, lie softly. We have no
care to clothe our souls with the fine linen of the Saints, which is Christ's
righteousness: to feed it with the bread of life that came from heaven; to
lay it one the soft bed of a sweet and excusing conscience. If the body be
sick there is sending for the Physician: the soul may be sick of the dropsy
of covetousness, of the swelling tumor of pride, of the consumption of envy;
no seeking to the heavenly Physician for the curing of it.

The body, says Chrysostom. is not wholly to be neglected, De Carnis concupisc.
that thou may have a good wagon for thy soul, a good governor for thy ship;
a good soldier to fight for thee: but thy soul is far more to be respected:
Otherwise thou art like a man, that sets forth his maid bravely, and suffers
his wife to go basely. What discretion is it to give all to the body, nothing
to the soul? Chrysostom* ad pop. Antioch. hom. 42. Bern. ad Guli. Abbatem.
What pity is it, ancilliam reficere, ac dominam interficere? To fat the body,
and to kill the soul? This is no charity but iniquity; no mercy, but cruelty;
no discretion, but confusion: above all, let us care that our souls may
prosper, as did Gajus his soul.

VERSE 3.
WE have had the entrance. Now to the matter of the Epistle. Where 1 there is
the substance of it. 2.The conclusion of it. The substance has two branches, a
Commendation; an Admonition, v. 9. He commends him for two virtues that
glistered in him: the one is Sincerity, v. 3, 4. the other is Hospitality. 5.
his Sincerity is set forth by the joy wherewith Saint John was ravished in
regard of it. The joy is first specified, v. 3. then amplified, v. 4. In the
specifying of this joy, there is, 1. The greatness of it. 2. The ground of it.

He did not envy it as Iosuah did the prophesying of Eldad and Medad, but he
joyed in it not a little, but greatly, vehemently, as the Wise men rejoiced
with an exceeding great joy, when they saw the star again. There is, gaudium
in carne, in the flesh: that is, Mat. 2.10.
the adulterers joy; gaudium in vindicta, in revenge, that is, the malicious
man's joy: gaudium in mundo, that is the worldlings joy: gaudium in Christo,
that is, the Christian man's joy. We must rejoice at the good things that be in
others.

The ground of his rejoicing was a report that came to him of Gajus, when the
brethren came. Preachers and common Christians that were with Gajus, and
testified to the truth: boar witness of the truth that is in thee. 1. Of thy
sincere dealing and liberality to all. The good things that be in others must
not be smoothered, or buried in silence, our tongues must be as trumpets to
sound them abroad; that, which the woman did to Christ, in pouring a box of
precious ointment on his head, must be spoken of throughout the world, the
faith of Abraham, the zeal of Phineas, the patience of Job, the Centurions
Synagogues, Cornelius alms, and the bountifulness of Gajus shall be
propagated to all posterity.

Fame is like a ship that receives all passengers, like a wagon, that
entertaines all, good and bad. Bad things go abroad, and good things go
abroad, but here is the difference;

1. Bad things go speedily, good slowly; the one flies like Eagles; the other
creek like Snailes. David's adultery went further then his sweet and heavenly
songs.

2. The one are enlarged, the other diminished; the one half of Salomons
wisdom, 1 Reg. 10.7.
came not to the ears of the Queen of Shebah.

3. The one all hears of: but a few of the other. Thousands hear of a false
report: as that Saint Paul preached against the Law and Moses: Acts 21.20.
hundreds do not hear of the other.

4. Bad things go without ceasing; men are like flies that are ever insisting
upon soars: the report of good things is like an hue and cry, that quickly
falls down in the Country.

5. The one we tell of with delight: we take little pleasure in talking of the
other; the one shall be at ordinaries, the other shall find never an ordinary,
yet we ought rather to testify of the one rather than of the other. God and
his Angels take delight in the one: the devil in the other. Let us witness of
the virtues wherewith God has adorned any. It shall redound to his glory, and
it shall be a spur to prick on others to the like.

This is illustrated a pari. Even as thou walk in the truth. 1. In the truth
of the Gospel, which thou do adorn by thy good works: Thou do not content
thy self to begin in the truth, but thou walk in it, like a good
traveller, till thou come to the end of thy journey to the Celestial Canaan.

VERSE 4.
THen this joy is amplified by a comparison. Some read (...), greater grace.
But most Greek Coppies have (...), joy.

In the Greek (...). Greater joy than these. Some refer it to the brethren
mentioned before, then in these men that relate this of thee. Some Greek
Coppies have (...), greater joy than this. So the question were at an end: Yet
the plural for the better exagarating of it may be put for the singular, as if
all joys were comprehended in this. 1 Cor. 4.15.
What is that? Then to hear that my children walk in the truth.

Why? Saint John was a perpetual Virgin; He had no children acording to the
flesh; but he had spiritual children, among whom Gajus was one, because he
preached the Word of truth to him. Preachers are fathers, mothers, and nurses
too. Fathers; Though ye have ten thousand instructors in christ, yet not many
fathers, Gal. 4.19.
I have begotten you through the Gospel. Mothers; My little children, 1 These.
2.7.
of whom I travel in birth again, till Christ be formed in you. Nurses, We
were gentle among you, as a nurse cherishes her children. Therefore we are to
be loved and honored of the people.

Some rejoice to see their children flourish in wealth and honors of the
world, then in the graces of the Spirit. It is more joy to them to see them
Gentlemen, Knights, Lords, etc. than to see them upright and constant
Christians. It was not so with St. John, no more must it be with us. We may joy
to see them great men in the world, but no joy to this to see them great in
Christ.

VERSE. 5.
THe second virtue commended in him is his hospitality, and charity: Whereof
there is, 1. A relation of it in this, and part of the 6. ver. 2. The
prosecution of it, 6. and 7. 3. The necessity of it: Not in him alone, but in
all christians, ver. 8.

In the relation. 1. The manner how he did it. 2. The persons to whom it was
extended. Touching the manner: Thou do faithfully, whatsoever thou do. In
the Greek not (...), but (...): thou do a faithful deed, making a
faithful demonstration of thy faith by thy works, as it becomes every
faithful man to do: Show me thy faith by thy works. We must not only do
bonum, James 2.
but do it been, not only that which is good, but we must do it with a good
intention; for God is not so much pleased with Nounes, as with Adverbs.

This Gregory sets down excellently well.

1. We must not do them superbe, proudly; with a proud opinion of our selves,
thinking highly of our selves, because we have done them, as the Pharisee did,
which spread the Peacocks feathers of his works before God in the Temple. In
knowing of them, we must not know them, though they be recta, good things; yet
we must account them minima, little in our own eyes; acknowledging, when we
have done all that we can, we are unprofitable servants. God may find many
blemishes in our best works. Luke 17 10.


2. We must not do them ambitiose, with an ambitious mind, to get glory to
our selves, as the Pharisees did; who had a trumpet sounded at their gates, for
the publishing of their alms. Vaineglory is a secret thief, that accompanies
us privily in all our best actions, to cut the throat of the soul, when we
have done them.

3. We must not do them mundano, for wordly lucre and commodity, Ioh. 12.5.
hoping to enrich our selves by it as Judas did by the box of ointment, he
pretended the benefit of the poor; but he intended his own benefit. If we do
them for these sinister ends, we lose our reward. The only scope we aim at,
must be Gods glory. Let your light so shine before men, Mat. 5 16:
that they seeing your good works they may glorify your father which is in
heaven: so we shall do all faithfully as Gajus did.

The persons to whom his well doing extended, were the brethren and strangers.
Some interpret brethren, the faithful: And indeed they were honored with
that title in the Primitive Church. Strangers, those that be not yet called,
but are strangers from the common wealth of Israel. Rather by brethren are
meant Jews: Romans 9.3.
For my brethren the Jews. By strangers, Gentiles converted to Christ, as
appears by the opposition. verse 7.

Hospitality is in special manner commended to us in the Scripture. Deuteronomy.
10.19.
Love ye the strangers, for ye your selves were once strangers. We in England
were strangers in Queen Mary's days: Some feign to flee into France; some into
Germany; some to Frankford; some to Emden. Therefore let us have pity on
strangers. Be given to hospital^ty; Rom 12* 13.
(...), pursuing it as the hunters do the Dear; we must not invite them
summis labijs, says Hierom, coldly for fashion sake: Ad rusticum.
but toto mentis ardore, with a fervent affection and desire to have them; Genesis
18.
We must pull them to our houses as Abraham did.

Origin observes of Lot. We read of no good works of his that are registered
in Genesis, In Genesis hom. 5.
save only hospitality, for this alone, evadit incendia, Genesis 19.
he escapes burning, when all Sodom was burnt, hospitalem domum ingressi sunt
Angeli; The Angels entered into the house of hospitality; Clausas hospitibus
domus ignis ingressus est; the fire entered those houses that were shut up
against hospitality; Audite hoc, qui hospitem velut hostem vitatis: Hear ye
this, O ye covetous misers, that shun a stranger, as ye would do an enemy;
whereas indeed ye should make your selves friends of this unrighteous Mammon.
Julian writing to the high Priest of Galatia, excites all to hospitality by a
saying out of Homer, (...). All strangers and poor folk are sent to us by God
himself; peradventure to try us with all. Let us be courteous, even to
strangers, as Gajus was: In entertaining of them, we entertain Christ, and he
will reward us at the latter day, Mat. 25.

VERSE 6.
I But how know thou, John, that I am so full of charity? Many have related
it to me.

Who? both brethren and strangers, they have borne witness of thy charity,
coming from thee to me. It was religiously and gratefully done of them: For we
must all acknowledge our benefactours: Of what charity did they bear
witness? Non habitus, sed actus, says Aquinas, non affectus, sed effectus:
Not of the habit of the charity which can not be seen: but of the act of
charity, which all the world might see: not that thou had a good affection
to do good, but of the fruits and effects of thy charity: that is poor
charity, go in peace, warm your selves, fill your bellies, Iac. 2.16.
and give them not a crumme to fill them withal: Christ showed no such charity
to the people in the wilderness, he fed them with loaves and fishes. Mat.
14.19.
Dorcas did not say to the widows warm your selves, but she made them coats
to warm them withal. Act. 9.39.
Such was Gajus his charity: he lodged them in his house, they sat at his
fire, he fed them at his table: Such must be the charity of us all, we are
full of excuses to keep us from charitable works, which S. Basil most pithily
meets with all, 1. I have not to give, no, says he, Cent. ditescent.
look upon the rings that be upon thy fingers, tell thy tongue that thou
lie; if thou can not give Zacheus gift, give the widows gift. Diversa
dederunt, sed ad unum pervenerunt, quoniam non diversa amaverunt, they gave
diverse gifts; Aug. de Ovibus.
yet they came both to one and the same Kingdom, because they both loved one
and the same thing, which was God. It is not the Coffer but the heart which God
respects. Habet semper unde det, Aug in Ps. 36.
cui plenum est pectus charitatis, he that has a heart full of love to Christ
and his members, shall ever have something to give, that fountain will never
be dried up. Coronat Deus voluntatem, Aug. in Psalm. 103.
ubi non invenit facultatem: God crowns the will where he finds inability of
doing.

2. I have children to provide for.

1. Says S. Basil, did thou say when thou prayedst for children, Give me
children that might keep me from the Kingdom of heaven?

2. As thou have children on earth, so thou have a brother in heaven, which is
Christ, reckon him among thy children, He that loves Father or mother, wife or
children more than me, Mat. 10 37.
is not worthy of me.

3. How know thou whether thy children shall live or no, death may sweep
them all away, and that with one beesome too, as it did Jobs.

4. If they live, art thou sure thy goods shall come to thy children? strangers
may eat them up, they may come to thine enemies, as Saul's Kingdom did to
David.

5. Take not too much thought for thy children, he that feeds the young
ravens, will feed thy young children the rather, if thou honor him with
thy goods, and let him to have a portion among thy children.

The third excuse; I will give by will after my death: to that S. Basil
answers.

1. Thy breath may be stopped on the sudden, that thou shall have no time to
make a will, as Valentinian the Emperor was.

2. If thou do, a dash with a pen may invert thy meaning, and overthrow thy
will.

3. Then we may thank death for the good thou do, if thou could have
lived ever, thou would never have done good, like a rotten tree that does no
good, till it be cut down.

4. Were it not better for thee to have the praise of a liberal man, when thou
walk on the ground, than when thou art put into the ground?

5. No dead creature was brought to the Altar: God requires a living sacrifice.

Luc. 16.25.
6. Thy life is the time of working, not death: Remember that thou in thy life
time receivedst thy goods, we must do good with them in our life, not in our
death.

7. Will thou commit thy good works to Ink and Paper, rather than to the
disposing of thine own hands?

8. If thou did receive a Noble man into thy house, would thou set the
relics of thy table before him? and will thou serve God with the relics of
thy life? while we have time let us do good to all. Ga^. 6.10.


We are fallen into those days, whereof our Savior Prophesied, The love of
many shall wax cold, now not the charity of many, but in a manner of all, is
not only cold, but stark dead, few or none can witness of our charity, we
are more wedded to our wealth than to our wives, many a one can be content to
part more readily with his wife, then with his money to good uses; yet they be
called (...) non ut servemus, Chrysostom. in Evang. Io. hom. 18.
sed ut utamur, not to lay them up till they rust, but to use them to the glory
of the giver, especially to bestow them on Christ and his members: many things
are worse for using, Aug. de Ver. dom. Sermon. 35
these are better. Si amaveris divitias peribis cum illis, perde, ne pereas
dona, ut acquiras, semina ut metas. If thou love thy riches so well, as to
do no good with them, thou shall perish together with thy goods: part with
them when God will have thee, that thou perish not with them: give, that thou
may take: sow, that thou may reap. Sow in earth cheerfully, and thou
shall reap in heaven plentifully.

Where did they bear witness of his charity? not in secreto, but in publico;
not secretly but openly, not in the house, but in the Church. Some of them
being preachers did speak openly of it in the Pulpitin the audience of all the
people.

The best and the next way to be famous, is to be full of charitable works:
they after the flood sought to get them a name by setting up a tower, Genesis 11 4.
the height whereof should reach to heaven, but the works of charity,
proceeding from a true faith, shall bring us to heaven indeed, they will make
us to be spoken of, both in this life, and in the life to come. The Centurions
Synagogues shall make him volitare per ora virum, to fly through the mouths
of men, more than Ahabs yvorie Palace shall do him.

Emanuel College Wr I sometime lived, founded by Sir Gualter Mildmay that
learned Knight, and lover of learning, shall make all posterity to speak of
him, and to praise God for him. Suttons hospital shall continue his name, more
than all his houses and lands, gold and silver could have done. The name of
Gajus shall remain in the Church to the worlds end, The righteous shall be had
in everlasting remembrance. If we be desirous of a name, Psalm. 112.6.
no speedier way then by the works of charity, the godly will speak of us in
this life, and Christ will set them on a stage at the day of judgment in the
life to come.

Now he stirs, him up to a proseqution of his charity, not only to
entertain them kindly, while they be with him: but to stretch forth his
kindness to them at their departure, where there is. 1. The enjoying of it.
2. The pressing of it, verse 7.

In the enjoying. 1. the fact. 2. the manner how it is to be done. 3. a
commendation of it, being done.

The fact is this: To bring them forward on their journey, when they go to
other places (...), send them on before, with competent provision.

It seems to be a kindness performed to all strangers at their departure.
Abraham went With the Angels on their way, but chiefly to preachers of the
word. Paul and Barnabas were conveyed by the Church toward Jerusalem, Genesis
18.16.
the Elders of Ephesus accompanied Paul to the ship: Act. 15.3.
all that were at Tyrus accompanied Paul with their wives and children, he
presumed to be brought on by the Saints at Rome in his journey toward Spain,
Act. 20. ult.
Act. 21.5*
he charged the Corinthians to convey Timothy in peace to him; Romans 15.24.
he willed Titus to bring Zenas the expounder of the Law and Apollos on their
journey diligently that they lacked nothing: there is a Court courtesy usual
among us, 1 Cor. 16.11.
if a man of account come to our house we will go a little way with him: Tit.
3.13.
It has some similitude with this: but it is not the same: it comes short of
it by many degrees.

Then he tells him how he should do it, after a godly sort (...) worthy of
God, (...), let your conversation be worthy of the Gospel of Christ, walk
worthy of God, Phil. 1.17.
as it beseems Legates and Ambassadors sent from God, 1 These. 2.12.
as ye would do to God himself: (...): digni deo. i. as Lorinus expounds it,
not much amiss, divine, regie, largiter: divinely, princely, largely:
divinely, as sent from God, princely, because they come from the Prince of
Princes, not sparingly, but largely too.

Porus being asked of Alexander, how he should use him, answers in one word,
(...), regie, regally: how else? Plut. in apot^. graec.
says Alexander, nay in that, says he, all manner of royal usage is
comprehended. So Saint John here wishes Gajus to bring them on worthy of God:
he could say no more. We must receive a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, as a
man of God, Mat. 10.41.
sent from God himself: little respect now a days is given to Prophets. When
a Legate came from the Pope into England, how royally was he entertained, many
Lords would meet him as far as Dover: and convey him honorably to the Court.
Gods Legates among us shall not have a quarter of that honor; no, not they that
be in most eminent places. In honoring of them we honor God: in dishonouring
of them, we dishonor God, yet it is little regarded.

There follows the commendation of it, Thou shall do well, exceeding well,
the positive for the comparative, excellently well. God will reward thee for it
in this life, for he is not unrighteous to forget our work, and labor of our
love which we have showed toward his name, Hebr. 6.10.
in ministering to his Saints: In the life to come, then Christ will applaud us,
and say: Euge serve bone: Well done thou good and faithful servant, enter into
the joy of thy master.

VERSE. 7.
HE presses it by a forcible reason, deduced from the piety of those
preachers, which is set forth; 1. By the end of their journey. 2. by the small
fruit of it.

Because for his names sake, that is, for the propagation of the Name of God by
the preaching of the Gospel.

They went forth, out of their native Country; There be diverse kinds of
travelers. Some travel upon curiosity, to fit their eyes, ears, and tongues,
that they may see and be seen, hear strange things and relate them, when they
come home; and it were better for us to believe them, then to go and try.

Some leave their Country for debt, that carries many into Ireland and other
places: some because of some notorious offenses committed by them, which makes
them to fly the Country. Some do it impiously to suck in the dregs of
Popery, and to make proselytes of their own religion, as the Pharisaical
Jesuits do, and in fine they make them threefold more the children of hell,
than they were before, few travel for the name of Christ, for the spreading of
the Gospel, as these did.

Touching the fruit of their travel it was fruitless, taking nothing of the
Gentiles, to whom they preached, he does not say, asking nothing, but taking
nothing though it were offered to them.

Object.
I, these were good preachers indeed, if ours would do so, they should be
welcome?

Answ.
They took nothing, not because it was unlawful for them to take, but because
it was inexpedient. It is a maxim written in us by the pen of nature, the
labourer is worthy of his hyre: we pay our Weavers, Burlers, Spinners, our
thrashers: They that thrash out the corn of the Word of God to us, we are
loath to pay. Our own harvest-men we will recompense: Gods harvest-men by our
good will shall have nothing. Saint Paul bestows an whole Chapter, in
pleading for the Ministers allowance. 1 Cor. 9.
Who goes a warfare at his own cost? Who planteth a Vineyard, and eats not
of the fruit thereof? Yet our Paul's and Apolloes are worthy of nothing for
their planting and watering. They that served at the Altar, lived on the Altar,
and they that preach the Gospel, ought to live on the Gospel.

Extraordinary examples must make no ordinary rule. These took nothing, Saint
Paul took nothing; therefore now we ought to take nothing. The poor receive
the Gospel. The Gentiles were poor; therefore in commiseration they would take
nothing; neither are we rigid exactors of the poor.

I, but Paul took nothing of the Corinthians; yet they were rich: Not because
he might not, but because he would not, to pull down the arrogancy of the
false apostles, which exalted themselves, and went about to depresse St. Paul.
There was one thing wherein all the world knew he excelled them, that he
preached the Gospel freely among them: Whereas those greedy dogs could never
be satisfied. They devoured them, 2 Cor. 11 20.
they took away the^r goods, yet they were had in high estimation among them.
This advantage he would by no means lose. It were better for him to die than
that any should make this rejoicing of his vain. 1 Cor. 9.15.
These be unlearned cavils; Saint Paul wrought for his living: his hands
ministered to his necessities: therefore now Preachers must work for their
living?

1. Saint Paul wrought not every where: 2 Cor. 11.8.
of some Churches he took nothing, of others he did; In so much as he
upbraideth the Corinthians with it, that he was feign to rob other Churches, to
take wages of them to do them service.

2. Saint Paul was furnished with the extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghost,
with all kind of tongues, which must cost us infinite labor to attain to:
his understanding was opened to understand the Scriptures without help of
Commentaries.

For Christ at his Ascension into heaven, Luke 24 45.
opened the understanding of all the Apostles. So he did his when he revealed
himself to him. Saint Paul was able to preach without study, without books,
so are not we. The people call on us to preach; they have never Sermons enough,
though none be practiced, yet they would have us to preach for nothing; We must
be painful Bees flying up and down from book to book, as from flower, to
flower, to gather honey for them, yet we must be as Camelions to live by air.
David professed, 2 Samuel 24.24*
he would not offer a burnt offering to the Lord his God of that which cost him
nothing: Yet some would have us to offer them up by the preaching of the Word
for nothing: They be such as feel no sweetness in the Word of God, for if
they did, Gal. 4 15.
they would be content to pluck their eyes out of their heads for us, if it
were possible, much more the money out of their purses. They, that build upon
this place: They went forth taking nothing of the Gentiles; by a kind of
Alchimistrie which they have, go about to make a great matter of nothing.

VERSE 8.
HE concludes this point by a necessity of it imposed upon all. We. Not thou
alone, but I too: All that love the truth. I am a poor man in respect of
worldly wealth, in comparison of others, yet I am willing to put my helping
hand to it.

He does not say, we may if we list; but we ought. It is a debt that we owe:
Whose debtors are they, says Saint Paul of the Gentiles, Romans 15.27.
namely, to the poor Jews to contribute to them; for if they be partakers, of
their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal
things.

What to do? To receive such; Such worthy laborers in Christ his harvest, as
these be.

(...), to take them from their tedious journeyes into our houses, and to give
them the best relief we can.

Why? That we might be fellow helpers to the truth; (...), fellow workers for
the truth, together with them.

We are fellow helpers to the truth sundry kind of ways:

1. Amice alloquondo, by speaking friendly to the Preachers of the truth. 1
Paralip. 30.22.
Hezekiah spoke comfortably to the Levites, which was a cheering of their
hearts, as the word imports.

2. Instruendo alios, by a private instructing of others: as Priscilla and
Aquila did Apollos. Act 18 26.
Householders that catechize their families are great fellow helpers to the
truth.

3. Pro eis loquendo, as they that made apollogies for them.

4. E^periculis eruendo; by pulling them out of dangers. So they that let down
Paul in a basket through the wall of Damascus were fellow helpers to the truth,
2 Cor. 11.32.
that Paul preached. So were they that conveyed Athanasius away in a ship, from
the fury of Julian.

5. By helping them to their maintenance. So did Hezekiah, by commanding the
people to pay their tithes and offerings to the Priests and Levites, 2 Chronicles.
31 4
whereby they were encouraged in the Law of the Lord. As they discourage them,
that withold their right from them, as a number do, they think they may
pinch on the Parsons side: so doing, they give a secret maime to the truth.

6. Temporalia ministrando, by ministering temporal things to them, by
receiving the Preachers of the truth into our houses, by releiving of their
necessities, by affording them all the comfort we can, by sending to them if
they be in distress. This is the direct scope of the place: So the Shunamitish
women of great estimation was an helper to the truth, in preparing a chamber, a
stool, a candlestick; 2 Reg. 4.8.
all necessary provision for Elisha. So was Iohanna the wife of Chuza Herod's
steward, with other holy women that ministered to Christ of their substance.
Luke 8.3.
Constantine was an helper to the truth, in entertaining the Bishops in his
own Palace, and admitting them to his own table.

Let us all according to our ability receive such, that we may be helpers to
the truth.

The second part of the substance of the Epistle, is a fruitful admonition
given to Gajus. 1. Concerning a bad man. 2. Concerning a good man ver. 12. In
the bad man: 1. There is a description of him. 2. A caveat to avoid him, ver.
11. He is described by a combat between him and Saint John. Where there is.
1. His resisting of John. 2. John's resisting of him ver. 10. He gave the
assault. John is only se defendere, a defender of himself.

VERSE 9.
IN his resisting of Saint John, is to be considered. 1. What he did resist. 2.
Who resisted. 3. The manner of his resistance.

That which he withstood was a letter written by Saint John: I wrote to the
Churches; that is to the company of the faithful in thy city, which may well
be Corinth, for it was a factious city, full of Sects and Schisms. The vulgar
translateth it, Scripsi forsitan; peradventure I had written. But Erasmus
guesseth shrewdly, and truly. The word [ Forsitan] was foisted by some
unlearned Clarke into the text.

I wrote, says Saint John, to the Church: And he speaks it by the way of a
Prolepsis. Gajus must reply: Why? Did thou not write to us all this while
about the entertaining of these men?

I wrote, says Saint John: but my writing was not regarded. This Epistle of
Saint John's is not now extant, Ioh. 20.31.
no more peradventure are some which Saint Peter and Saint Paul wrote. But we
have so much Scripture by divine providence as is sufficient to salvation: we
need not fly to unwritten verities.

Now let us take a view of the party resisting. He is described by his name,
and by his peevish quality. His name was Diotrephes. Some read Dietrepe; Quasi
(...) overturning God; then it fits him well, for he was an overtwharter of God
and all godliness; but it is Diotrephes, (...), nourished by God. And Homer
calls Kings (...), Jupiters nurse children: and indeed God has a special care
of Kings. This man had a glorious name. Convenient rebus nomina saep^ suis.
Sometimes men have suitable names: The Name of Jesus agreed wonderful well to
our blessed Savior, for he saves us from our sins, and there is no Savior
besides him. Timotheus and Philotimus were both answerable to their names, both
pure worshippers of God. But some times men's names are different from their
doings. Judah is a good name, of Judah, a praiser of God, yet he that betrayed
Christ, had that name. Simon is a good name; Shamaang, Obedience: yet Simon
Magus was disobedient, the fountain of all heresies. So this Diotrephes had a
good name; but he himself was a bad man. Good names may be means to make men
good, but they do not make them good without the blessing of God Almighty.

2. He is described by a vicious quality that was in him, he loved to have
the preeminence among them. He does not say, (...), that has the preeminence,
but (...), that loves preeminence. (...), riches are good: but (...), the love
of riches is naught. Wine is good, but the love of wine is naught. He that
loves wine shall not be rich. Prove. 21.17.
Love it we may moderately, but not immoderately. The world is good and all
things that be in it, as they be the creatures of God: but the love of the
world is evil. The upmost places in the Synagogues were good; but the
Pharisees were evil to love them. Eminency in the Church is good, but we
must not love it, desire it, affect it with a proud mind, and ambitious heart,
as Diotrephes did.

Hier. advers. Helvid.
A paritie in the Ministry is dangerous. It is the mother of Sects and
Schisms. Ex aequo super omnes Ecclesiae fortitudo solidatur: Sed Petrus caput
constituitur ut Schismatis tollatur occasio. The solliditie of the Church is
equally founded upon the doctrine of all the Apostles: yet Saint Peter was made
the head of the Church for the avoiding of Schism. Nevertheless there is not
one Oecumenicall Bishop over the whole world, or over all Christendom. Major
est authoritas orbis, quam urbis, says the same learned Father. Hier. ad Evag.
The authority of the world, is greater than the authority of one city.
Vbicunque fuerit Episcopus, Wheresoever a Bishop is, whether at Rome, at
Eugubium, at Constantinople, Hieron.
at Rhegium, at Alexandria, or at Tais, ejusdem est meriti, ejusdem sacerdotij,
he is of the same desert, and the Priesthood is the same: yet there must be
Bishops to have authority over others, to preserve the peace of the Church; to
see that all do their duties in their several places, and to be as a wall of
defense for them that be under them. If there were not some in high places, in
favor with Kings and Princes, the rest of the Clergy would soon be trodden
under foot; as the little rivers submit themselves to the greater, so (...),
says St. Basil, it is necessary, it is profitable for the inferior Ministers
to subject themselves to the superior, as were Aaron and his sons, so says
S. Hierom, are Bishops, Priests or Elders. Aaron was above his sons, and
Bishops are above them, ad Nepotian.
yet both under God and the King; let not them, that be above (...) contemn
them beneath in the vallyes: let not them, that be below, carry themselves
insolently toward them above. Bishops and Priests, says Ignatius, sunt
tanquam chordae in Cithara colligatae: ad Ephesians.
as strings tied together in an harp; if they jarre, there will be unpleasant
music. Preeminence is laudable: the affectation of it is damnable, to be
called a Bishop is commendable. Sed velle vocari, to will it, to have an
irresistible will to it, is discommendable: Origin. in Mat. 23.
they that will be rich fall into diverse snares and temptations: so they that
will be in high places, whether God will or no, 1 Timothy 6.9.
ensnare themselves ere they be aware.

There be many retinacula, pulbackes to hold us from that.

1. It is devill-like, he was high enough at the first, he would needs be
higher, therefore he was cast low into the bottomless pit of hell: and all
proud aspiring persons fall into the condemnation of the devil. 1 Timothy 3.6.


2. It is not Christ-like, he was called to it, he intruded not himself; he
invites us to humility by precept; Learn of me, Mat. 11.29.
I am humble and meek, by practice, he washed his Disciples feet, John 13.
though he were Lord of all, yet he became a servant to all, he respects it
in his followers, when they stood upon greatness, Mat. 18.1.
he sends them to a little child to learn to be little, he that is greatest
among you, let him be your servant. Mat. 23.11.


3. It is the joy and glory of all good ministers that they have been no
intruders. I have not thrust in my self to be a Prophet to this people, Lord
thou know: the Lord of the harvest must thrust laborers into the harvest,
none must thrust in himself.

4. It is a weighty charge, an heavy burden, he that desires the office of a
Bishop desires a worthy work: Hieron.
Opus non dignitas: labor, non deliciae: opus, per quod humilitate decrescat,
non fasti gio intumescat. It is a work, not a dignity: a labor, not a
delicacie: a work, I say, that should make a man decrease by humility, not
increase and swell in pride; a work for the which a fearful account is to be
made, they watch over your souls, as they that must give an account: if God
call us to that work, Heb. 13.17.
let us entreat him to give us strength in some measure to discharge it: let
us not inordinately love it, nor ambitiously affect it. o ambitio, says S.
Bernard, O blind and execrable ambition, ambientium crux; the very cross of
ambitious persons, Ad Eugen. Pap. lib. 3.
quomodo omnes torquens omnibus places? how in displeasing and vexing of all
do thou please all? Nil acerbius cruceat, nil molestius inquietat; nothing
does more bitterly torment, more trouble and disquiet men: Nil tamen apud
miseros mortales celebrius: yet for all that, nothing is in greater request
with wretched men, than it: let there be John's among us in preeminence: but
let there be no Diotrepheses among us, that love preeminence.

What did this Diotrephes? how did he behave himself toward John? he
received him not. Lorinus affirms, he received neither his Epistle, nor
Gospel, but the direct meaning is, he received not his council, his authority,
his admonition in entertaining strangers: contrariwise he rejected it, he set
slight by it, he spurned it: intolerable insolency; Christ received him:
Diotrephes repelled him, he was the Disciple whom Jesus loved: Diotrephes hated
him: Christ took him into his bosom: he will not take him into his book, he
makes no reckoning of him. Christ commended his Mother to him: he will not
receive Christ's brethren upon his commendation, had there been nothing in him
save his gray hayres without, he should have reverenced him. The Galatians
received Saint Paul as an Angel from heaven: S. John was an Angel of the
Church, a principal Angel, yet Diotrephes regards him not, this is the haughty
spirit of ambitious persons, they contemn all in respect of themselves, they
care for no body; and indeed no body cares for them. In not receiving of him,
he received not Christ, and Christ will not receive him into his Kingdom at
the latter day. As he resisted John: so Saint John will resist him, where. 1.
there is a promise, or threatening to do it. 2. the motives that urged him to
it.

VERSE 10.
PRopterea (...) for this cause, for this his malepart dealing. I will remember
his deeds which he does, the vulgar has admoneam, breaking Priscians head.
But the Rhemists put admoneb^ in the Margent as a plaster to heal it withal.
I will admonish, that does not express the efficacy of the Greek word (...).
I will call them to remembrance, I will rub his memory with them to his shame,
not in a corner, but before the whole Church. Catharinus thinks he will
inflict some temporal punishment on him, sudden death, as Saint Peter did on
Ananias and Sapphyra: Act. 5. Act. 13.
or blindness as Saint Paul did upon Elymas the sorcerer, but I think Saint
John's zeal was not so hot. I will remember it, when he thinks I have
forgotten it.

But when? If I come, which is not spoken doubtfully, but with a secret
confidence in the goodness of God, that he shall come. If I come, as I trust
in God I shall come;

I will remember his deeds, that is, as Aquinas does well interpret it, in
omnium oculos manifestius arguendo deducam. I will set them by a manifest
reproof before the eyes of all he has sinned openly and I will rebuke him
openly, which was Saint Paul's rule.

(...), the works that he has done by his tongue or any other way, I will
make them to be remembered, when he thinks they be forgotten. They that oppose
themselves to God and his Church, are with might and maine to be opposed by us.
Iannes and Iambres withstood Moses, he likewise withstood them, 2 Timothy 3.8.
made them to confess their sorceries, digitus Dei est, It is the finger of
God.

We see God is greater than the devil. Zidkiah smote Micajah one the face,
saying, When went the Spirit of the Lord from me, that it should speak to thee?
Thou shall see, says he, in that day, 1 Reg. 22.21.
when thou shall go from chamber to chamber to hide thee, and be ashamed of thy
doings. Hananiah the false prophet, brake the yoke on Ieremiahs neck, which
signified the captivity of the Israelites; affirming that God would so break
the yoke of the King of Babel. But Jeremiah went to him, told him to his face,
thou have broke the yoke of wood, Ierem. 28.17.
but God will put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, and the necks of all the
people: And because he had spoken rebelliously against the Lord, Hananiah died
the same year. Amaziah bade Amos prophecy no more at Bethel, for it is the
Kings Chapel; he accused him in a letter to the King of high treason, that
he had conspired against him, and the land was not able to bear his words.
Amos spared him not a whit: Thy wife shall be an harlot in the City, Amos
7.17.
thy sons and daughters shall fall by the sword, thou shall die in a polluted
land, and Israel shall surely go into captivity. Elias resisted Ahab; our
blessed Savior, the Pharisees. Saint John Baptist, Herod: Saint Paul, Elymas
the Sorcerer: O full of all subtilty, and all mischief, thou child of the
devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, will thou not cease to pervert the
right ways of the Lord. Acts 13.10,
Saint Athanasius withstood Arrius: Liberius spoke his mind freely to Valens
the Emperor: Saint Basil resisted Eunomius: De verbis Esa. hom. 5.
Saint Augustine was malleus omnium haereticorum: an hammer to crush all
heretics in pieces.

Here Saint John sets us a flagge of defiance against Diotrephes. We must all
pluck up the like courage against the adversaries of the truth.

Saint Chrysostom commends Azariah the high Priest for going into the temple
to King Vzziah, and telling him plainly, it is not lawful for thee to burn
incense to the Lord. He compares him to a courageous dog, that drew him out
of his masters house: 2 Timothy 2.24.
The man of God must be gentle toward all men, apt to teach, patient; In
meekness, instructing those that oppose themselves. So he must be cursed
against some men, as the cause requires. To give wild horses the reine too
much is to spoil them and their riders too: To loose the cords of the ship,
is to drown the ship. To be too remiss in the Church is to overthrow the
Church. Lenitives will serve for little soars; but great soars must hove
drawing plasters, otherwise we do not curare, Lib. 2. Epist.
but occidere, not cure but kill. It is the worthy saying of Saint Cyprian; our
blessed Savior commends the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, that he could not
bear them that were evil. We must bear our own enemies; but our backs
must not be so broad, as to bear Gods enemies.

Then he makes an enumeration of his deeds; they be in number 4. like four
stayrs in a ladder, one higher than another: the lowest staire of all is his
prating; the next to that is his not receiving of the brethren; the third is
his forbidding of others to do it; the last and greatest of all is his casting
of them out of the Church. We will take them in order.

Prating against us: (...): a metaphor taken from over-seething pots, that send
forth a foam, or from overcharged stomachs that must needs belch. Solomon
says of the fool, eructat stultitiam: Prove. 15.2.
he belches out foolishness. Belchers, ye know are odious to all; so be all
pratlers. With what? With malicious words; As they said of Moses and Aaron; Ye
take too much upon you: Numb. 16.3.
So Diotrephes said of Saint John: he took too much upon him, as if none
should rule in the Church but he. He prated that he did exhaust the treasury
of the Church; that he overburthened them with a multitude of strangers sent
to them: It may be that he breathed out some points of erroneus doctrine too:
He prated against him, he could not tell what; inaniter, ac irrationabiliter,
says Lyra, vainly, and without all reason. Zenophanes was (...), a spur to
Homer, and Diotrephes (...), a spur of Saint John, of whom he was not worthy
to be named the same day.

A common sin, yet a grievous sin, more grievous than we are aware of, to
be prattling in corners of other men.

1. Therein they sin against God, who gave them their tongues, to be as
trumpets to sound forth his praises, and bells to toll their brethren to God;
not as coals of Juniper to burn withal, nor as sharp rasors to cut withal.

2. In this they imitate the devil, (...), says Saint Basil, Epist. 7 5.
they have their character and denomination from the devil; he is (...), the
accuser and slanderer of the brethren: so are they: He is the old devil, and
they are the young devils.

3. The object, where about they be occupied, is the good name of men: now a
good name is above silver and gold. He does not a man so great wrong that
robs him of his silver and gold, as he that robs him of his good name.

4. He is a manslayer; and no manslayer has eternal life, he kills three
men at once with the sword of his tongue: himself, the hearers, and the man
whom he trusts through with the spear of his malevolent speeches: Bern. in
Cant. Sermon. 24.
vnus est qui loquitur: unum verbum profert, he is one that speaks, he
brings but one word out of his mouth, yet in uno momento multas aures
inficit, multas animas interficit, in one moment he infects many ears, and
kills many souls.

5. He banisheth himself out of the Kingdom of heaven, 1 Cor. 6.10.
raylers by name are excluded, therefore let us leave this prattling, least
hereafter we chatter and burn in hellfire. Major est machaera linguae quam
ferri, says Saint Augustine, the sword of the tongue makes a deeper wound,
than the sword of iron. In ep. Io. tract. 10.
It goes to the heart of many.

Saint Chrysostom professes he knew some, Quos verba magis affecerunt, quam
vulnera, ad pop. Antioch hom 31.
whom words have more affected then blows, and no marveile, says he, the body
receives the one, the soul the other.

But let us not be so faint hearted, words are but wind, as we use to speak,
let them pass away like the wind, especially being undeserved.

1. What be those pratlers? they be not lupi rapaces, sed pulices mordaces, Not
ravening wolves, but backbiting fleas: Bern. ad Gu^^. Abbatem.
they be but as a company of whelps that follow us wapping at our heels.

2. We draw in the same yoke with Christ and all the Saints. Some kept a
prattling against Christ, that he was a perverter of the people, that he denied
to pay tribute to Caesar. Luc. 32.1.
Tertullus the orator made a declamation against Paul, We have found this man
a turbulent fellow, Act. 24.5.
a mover of sedition throughout the world. What a number of false accusations
were commensed against Athanasius? that he embeaseled the Kings treasure, that
he had killed Arsenius his own deacon. In this we have a cloud of witnesses,
many companions in this affliction. We may happily keep out of the claws of
men: but we shall never keep out of the jaws of men; The servant is not
above his master; Daemonium habet, he has a devil: audit Dominus and patitur:
audit servus and indignatur, Aug. in Ep. Ioh. tract. 10.
this hears the master and puts it up quietly: this hears the servant and
storms at it impatiently.

3. Men speak against us: but God speaks for us. It is Origens observation,
Nunquam tantas lauds dixit Deus de Mose, In numer. hom. 7.
ac postquam Miriam and Aaron ei maledixerunt. God never spoke so much in the
commendation of Moses, as when Miriam and Aaron discommended and spoke evil of
him. Were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, even against Moses? They
disprayse: Number. 12.8.
God praises, what need we to regard them?

4. What is our rejoicing save the testimony of a good conscience? there is joy
within, why should there be sorrow without. 2 Cor. 1.12.
Those prattling tongues croake in our ears like Ravens: an excusing conscience
sings like a Nightingal in our hearts, let this inward music countervaile the
outward jarring, for a good conscience is a continual feast.

Heb. 12.3.
5. Consider him that endured such speaking against of sinners, he that knew no
sin, boar the contumelious speeches of sinners; shall not we that be
sinners, bear the reviling speeches of sinners?

6. We are no losers but gainers by it, Blessed are ye, when men hate you, Luc.
6.22.23.
when they separate you and revile you, putting out your name as evil, for the
Son of man's sake, rejoice and be glad, behold your reward is great in heaven.

Hereunto accords that worthy speech of S. August. Quisquis volens detrahit
famae meae, Contra lit. Pilet. lib. 3.
nolens addit mercedi meae: Whosoever willingly detracts from my good name,
does unwillingly add to my reward in the Kingdom of heaven: therefore let us
be so far from vexing at them, as rather let us rejoice in them.

This is the least though it be foul enough, there follow greater, from words
he goes to actions. 1. He receives not the brethren himself. 2. He forbids
them that would. 3. He casts them out of the Church.

Yet he does not simply say, he receives not the brethren, but not content with
his malicious prating, still he goes on from one degree of sin to another.

There is a kind of (...) of covetousness in sinning, a covetous man is not
content with that which he has, though he have the riches of Craesus, yet
still he would have more. So he that has begun to drink of the water of
sin, must needs drink more and more. Hest. 3.6.
Haman was not content to put Mordicay to death that refused to bow to him, but
he must needs have the lives of all the Jews in the provinces of Ahasuerus.
Act. 12.
Herod was not content to kill James the brother of John with the sword, but he
clapped up Peter into prison, intending to serve him with the like sauce. The
Jews at Thessalonica, could not be content to have persecuted Paul in their
own City, Act 17.13.
but they must pursue him to Berea likewise. One witchcraft, one adultery
would not content Iesabel: her witchcrafts and adulteries were in great number.
A man that sins, is like one that is tumbled down from a steep hill, he
cannot stay till he come to the bottom, unless there be an extraordinary stop
by the way; there is no stay in sinning unless God stay us by the hand of his
spirit.

Not content therewith, neither does he himself receive the brethren, which
notwithstanding he ought to do, for in receiving of them he receives Christ:
Mat. 25.35.
When I was a stranger ye lodged me.

Yet not content with that, he forbids them that would, like the dog in the
maunger, that would neither eat provender himself, nor suffer the horse to
eat it: like the Pharisees that shut up the Kingdom of heaven before men,
Mat. 23.13.
neither go in themselves, nor suffer others to enter in: these be vile
wretches, neither give to good uses themselves, nor suffer others, dissuade
others, these are guilty of their own damnation, and of the damnation of
others too, like those that be infected with the plague, and desire to infect
others too.

The height of his insolency was, he casts them out of the Church, (...) he
throws them out with spite and indignation: Whom? Et suscipientes and
susceptos, both the receivers and the strangers received. Aquinas supposes he
did cast them e loco publici conventus, out of the place of public assembly,
non e consortio fidelium, not out of the company of the faithful, it is like
he intended both, he excommunicated them.

Excommunicatio est ejectio e communione fidelium, an ejection out of the
company of the faithful: first in public, then in private, the public is
either an exclusion from the Sacraments alone: which is called minor, the
lesser excommunication, or from the public prayers of the Church too, and
that is major, the greater excommunication, to use the school terms a fructu
and suffragio, from the fruit they might have by the Sacraments: and from the
prayers and suffrages of the Church.

Touching private, we must withdraw our selves from them; we must not eat
with them familiarly, 2 Thessalonians 3.6. 1 Cor. 5.11. 2 Thessalonians. 3.14.
that so they may be ashamed of themselves, repent and be received into the lap
of the Church again. The persons to be excommunicated, and thrown out of the
Church, are gross, open, notorious offenders, by whom the name of God is
blasphemed, the Church grieved and offended, as adolaters, blasphemers,
heretics sowing the seed of damnable doctrine, adulterers, drunkards, 1 Cor.
5.11.
egregious covetous persons, wide mouthed railers, Jude 8.
and despisers of authority and government. If we be thrown out of the Church
for these and such like vices, our case is to be deplored, we are to grieve
and lament for it. Within the Church Christ rules: without the Church the
devil rules: the incestuous person in the Church of Corinth was delivered to
Satan: 1 Cor. 5.5. 1 Timothy 1.20.
so was Hymeneus and Alexander.

1. A fearful condition to be in the jurisdiction of the devil.

2. They that be in the Church are blessed, they that be out of it are cursed.

3 They that be rebellious against the Church are as heathen and publicans, and
they are odious to all. Mat. 18.17.


4. They that be cast out of the Church militant, are likewise for the time, so
long as they remain obdurate in their sins, cast out of the Church
triumphant; For whosoever the Church binds upon earth, is bound in heaven
too, Mat. 16.19.
therefore let us fear just excommunications.

But if we be cast out of the Church by them, that are usurpers in the Church,
as Diotrephes was, or if we be cast out not for ill doing, but for well
doing, as these were, not because we be heretics indeed, But because after
the way that they call heresy, so Worspip we the God of our fathers: for
adoring of Christ, Act. 24.14:
and refusing to adore the Pope.

Let not that grieve us, but let us rejoice in it. The Pharisees cast out the
blind man: John 9.35.
but Christ took him in. Our Savior armeth us against such thunderbolts, not
to be scared with them: they shall excommunicate you, but be not daunted with
that; for they excommunicated me before you: John 16.2.
futurum erat, says Saint Augustine, ut for as emitterentur cum illo, ab eis,
qui esse nollent in illo, qui non possent esse sine illo. In Io. tract. 93*
It shall come to pass, that they should be cast out with him, by them that
would not be in him, nay by them that could not be without him.

VERSE. 11.
WE have had a description of him, now a caveat for the avoiding of him, where
1. the precept. 2. the reason, the precept is partly negative, partly
affirmative. Follow not that which is evil, no not in Diotrephes, though he be
a man of credit and estimation with some.

Evil is soon imitated, especially in great persons, they are a countenance
to it, their actions seem to be laws. Such a great man swears profanely: Why
may not I swear too? no: Follow not that which is evil in any, no not in good
men, follow not Lots incest, David his adultery, Peter's denial, but especial
decline that which is evil in bad men, though they be never so great in
Church or Common wealth.

1. Evil is agreeable to our nature, it is soon followed, a little persuading
will serve the turn, therefore we had need to beware of it.

2. There be many instigators to that which is evil, the devil and his
instruments to thrust us forward.

3. Evil is common, a weed that grows every where, goodness is a flower
that grows in few gardens. Mat. 7.13.14.
Broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there be that find it:
Narrow is the way that leads to life, and few that walk in it. many
Sodomites but one Lot.

4. Evil since the fall is of greatest antiquity: there was a Cain before an
Abel: an Ismael before an Isaac: an Esau before a Jacob, therefore we had need
to watch over our selves, else we shall follow evil ere we be aware.

5. Whether does evil lead us? even to hell, to the bottomless pit of
eternal damnation, follow her not, let her go alone for all us, yet she has
too many followers, even in the light of the Gospel.

We are compassed about with evil men, before and behind, on the right hand,
and on the left, yet let us be among them, but let us not follow them, let us
be like to fishes, they live in salt water: yet they themselves are fresh. Noah
lived in the corrupt world; yet he himself remained incorrupt. Chrysostom. in Genesis
hom. 22.
(...), as if he had been clothed with another nature, Job, says the same
Father, was as a Dove among Hawks, a Lamb among Wolves, a Star among
Clouds, a Lilly among Thorns, De patient. Job. hom. 2.
yet he persevered in his uprightness. We shall meet with evil, wheresoever
we be, yet let us keep our selves undefiled of evil.

What must we know then? That which is good; which is commanded in the Law of
God, the rule of all goodness for the squaring of our actions, yea, in the
very Heathen. The Sun is ours wheresoever it shines, though it be upon a
dunghill; good is ours wheresoever it be, though among the Heathen. Follow the
patience of Socrates, the chastity of Lucretia, the temporance of Zeno, the
just dealing of Aristides, the contempt of money that was in Lucullus,
Fabritius; but especially follow it in the godly the members of Christ. Follow
the faith of Abraham, the zeal of Phineas, the sincerity of Nathaniel, the
liberality of Zacheus, and Cornelius; listen to the admonition of Saint Paul.
Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, Philip. 4* 8.
whatsoever things are just, are pure, appertaining to love, whatever things
are of good report, if there be any verture, if there be any praise, think on
these things.

But let us come to Saint John's Reason. 1. For goodness. He that does good,
is of God, not by propagation, but by imitation, he is full of goodness; be
you so too in some measure, Be you merciful, as your heavenly father is
merciful, be ye bountiful, as he is bountiful, be ye loving, as he is
loving: He does good to his very enemies, so do you.

2. He does that, which is acceptable to God, he is of his family, he serves
and obeyes him, therefore God will reward him for it: on the other side; He
that does evil has not seen God. Why? then none has seen him; for all do
evil: the meaning is, that does accustom himself to do evil. The godly man
does evil, but it is upon weakness* the wicked do it upon wilfulness; the
one accidentally, the other properly and naturally.

Such a one has not seen God: No more has the holiest man in the world. No
man has seen God at any time; That is spoken of the essence of God, and of a
perfect seeing of him. Ioh. 1.18.
But here he entreates of an experimental seeing of God. Taste and see how
good the Lord is; he has not seen the power, the wisdom, the justice, the
mercy of God. He knows not God. Psalm. 34.8.
He has no acquaintance at all with God; like to them that never saw him: he
is a stranger from God, and so consequently from all happiness. If they knew
God aright, they would not take such evil courses, as they do. He that
walks in the dark cannot see: wicked men walk in the darkness of sin
and ignorance; they lie wallowing in the works of darkness; therefore they
can not see God. Therefore let us abhor that which is evil; It will blind
our eyes, and keep us from seeing of God.

VERSE 12.
WE have had the bad man to be eschewed. Now to the good man, that is to be
followed: That is, Demetrius.

We read of a Demetrius the father of Antiochus that once reigned in Israel,
in the books of the Maccabes: There are but two mentioned in the new
Testament: The Silver-smith, that made shrines for Diana, and raised a tumult
in Ephesus: and Demetrius here spoken of: Act. 16.24.
Who he was cannot certainly be defined: By all probability he was one of the
Preachers before mentioned: who at this time was with Saint John; and as some
think, was the carrier of this Epistle. Whatsoever he was, he was a good man,
opposed to Diotrephes; he was a proud man; this an humble man: he an hard
hearted man, that shut up the bowels of compassion against poor strangers:
this is a merciful man to his ability, ready to entertain strangers: he
himself against Saint John: this was a lover and a reverencer of Saint John.
God will not have us to be utterly dejected by the examples of wicked men: Ver.
7.
he stirs up some good men, that may countervaile them. As the Jews had a
Haman to pull them down; so they had a Mordecai to lift them up: As Christ had
many enemies among the Pharisees: so he had some friends among them, Nicodemus
and Joseph of Arimathea. As Saint Paul had a Smith against him in Ephesus: so
he had the Towne-Clerke of Ephesus; by Gods providence to pacify the tumult,
as Gajus might grieve for Diotrephes, so he might rejoice in Demetrius.

This Demetrius had an excellent report. 1. Of all men in general. 2. Of the
truth itself. 3. Of Saint John in special.

To Demetrius is witnessed of all men; all have witness to him to be a good
man, neither is it a lying, but a true witness: the truth it self does
testify it, his deeds being answerable to the general report that goes of
him.

Yea, and I too do justify the same. He shall have my pen, my hand to
testify the same.

I but thy testimony is of no great weight, for that I appeal to your own
knowledge. John 21.24.
Ye know, having had so long experience of me, that my record is true. Christ
knew it, the faithful ever since have verified it: and you your selves know it
to be true; he is very earnest in the commendation of Demetrius. But is this
such a praise to Demetrius to have the good report of all men: Our Savior
seems to be of another judgment. O be to you, when all men speak well of
you; for after this manner did their fathers to the false prophets. Luke 6.26.


1. That is spoken of men-pleasers, which accommodate themselves to all men's
humors, sooth up all in their sins, that they may get the good will, and
good word of all, as appears by the example of the false prophets alleged:
Demetrius was none of that rank.

2 Here by all men is meant all good and godly men, although a good man
sometimes may in some things so carry himself, that the very wicked shall be
compelled to speak well of him.

3 As Demetrius had the testimony of men, so he had the testimony of the truth
it self; the truth did bear witness of him, as well as men.

There be two things which we ought all to procure, bona conscientia, a good
conscience in respect of God, and bona fama, and a good name, a good report in
regard of men.

1 A good name is sweet and comfortable, it is preferred before the most
precious things that men have in greatest estimation, A good name is to be
chosen above great riches: Prove. 22.1.
and loving favor is above silver and gold.

2 It is profitable, A good name makes the bones fat, an ill name makes a man
lean, a good name makes a man fat, he eats, Pro. 15.30.
he drinks, he sleeps the better for it.

3 It secures a man, while he is alive, they that have a bad report for their
injurious dealing, are shooted at, and maligned; they go in some sort in
danger of their lives; they that have a good report walk cheerfully and
safely.

4 It is a consolation to a man, even on his death bed, he has the less then
to vex and trouble his mind.

5 It leaves a sweet savor after us, When we be dead it is an odoriferous
ointment, the house will smell of it a good while after. Therefore let us so
live, that we may be well reported of, so far as it is possible of all men. I
say, so far as it is possible. For in truth it is impossible, 2 Cor. 6.8.
the best of us all must make account to pass through good report and ill
report into the kingdom of heaven.

Our Savior himself had not the good word of all: Some said he was a good
man, others said nay to it, but he deceives the people. Ioh. 7.12. 1 Samuel 2.24.
It is no good report, that I hear of you, said Eli to his sons, that lay
with the women assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the Congregation:
Let us not be justly ill reported of for our gross Idolatry, abominable
swearing, lying, killing, whoring, for our execrable covetousness and
oppression, that will make us stincke in the (...) of God and men. But if they
speak all manner of ill of us, lying, let us rejoice in it. Mat. 5.11.


VER. 13, 14.
THe conclusion of the Epistle: Consisting of an excusation for his short
writing; of a Christian farewell; and of loving and mutual salutations: The
excuse is altogether the same with the former, in the 12. of the 2 Epistle. The
Christian farewell is in these words: Peace be to thee. It was the manner of
hte Hebrews, at their meeting and parting, to say, peace be to thee. So our
Savior being ready to go out of the world, says to his Disciples. Ioh. 14.27.
Peace I leave with you, my peace give I unto you.

There is pax externa, all outward prosperity, pax fraterna, a brotherly peace:
Psalm. 133.
Behold how good and comely a thing it is for brethren to live together in
unity: Pax interna, the peace of conscience that passes all understanding; pax
eterna, the eternal peace that is in heaven, Saint John wishes them all to
Gajus.

The salutations are mutual,

1 From the Christians with John, Our friends salute thee, the name of friend
is taken stricte strictly, for a faithful friend indeed; A friend is nearer
than a brother. Pro. 18. ult.


2 Late, largely, for any common and seeming friend, The rich have many
friends, Pro. 14.20.
many fawning friends.

Mat. 5.43.
3 Latissime, most largely, for any man, our neighbor, thou shall love thy
neighbor, and hate thine enemy; now every man is our neighbor.

4 Ironice, Ironically, even of an enemy: Christ says to Judas, Friend, Mat.
26.50.
wherefore art thou come.

Tit. 3.15.
5 Pie and religiose, piously, and religiously, Our friends salute thee, that
is, fideles, the faithful that be with me. Our friends in the Lord Jesus, they
that love us in the faith, those are the best friends of all.

The other salutations are to the Christians with Gajus.

Greet the friends by name, not in gross, but nominatim particularly, which
argues his singular love to them. Christ calls all his sheep by name, Ioh.
10.3.
he takes a special notice of them all.

For Salutations, I remit the Reader to the former Epistle, and to the Epistle
to Philemon.
