THE DEVIL coniured.



LONDON Printed by Adam Islip for William Mats, dwelling in Fleetstreet at the
sign of the Hand and Plough. Anno 1596.

TO THE RIGHT HOnorable and learned sir John Fortescue, knight, Chancellor of
the Exchecker, Master of the Wardrope, and one of her Majesty's right Honorable
privy Counsel.
RIght Honorable, allured by your Wisdom, and animated by your authority, the
one expressed by your general and matchless knowledge in the purer toungs,
and the perfect use and felicity of your readings; the other in your execution
in affairs; policy, in counsel; place in judgment; and credit with her most
Royal Majesty: I have (more audacious then wise) presumed to submit this weak
labor of mine, to your judgment to determine on, and authority to countenance:
for what your judgment shall wink at, the world will applaud, and what your
authority shall countenance, ignorant detraction dare not misconster; so then
shadowed under the strong shield of your favor, I netther suspect my cause, nor
fear mine enemies; wax afraid of the curious, or abashed at the envious:
accept therefore most Noble Lord this poor wreck of my wit, that has no hope
of eternity but by your grace, nor defense from misreports but your name;
neither any more felicity then your allowance, and think of the writer as of
him that gives, what his rich will can for those favors which his weak power
may never requite. Thus wishing your honor that place in heaven which your
charity and piety to all the learned justly deserves on earth, I humbly take
my leave, this fifteenth of April. 1596.

Your Honors most bounden Orator. T. L.

To the Reader whatsoever, T. L. sends greeting.
COurteous, since you have long time drawn the weeds of my wit, and fed your
selves with the cockle of my conceits, I have at last made you gleaners of my
harvest and partakers of my experience. Here shall you find that which
Aristotle requires in every science, probability in argument, and
demonstration and truth in the end: here shall you find the style varieng
according to the matter, the matter suitable to the style, and all of these
aimed to profit: The reading hereof requires, Tota hominem, and non
distractum, for there is as much lost in slighting over, as won by perusing
warelie; if the title make you suspect, compare it with the matter, it will
answer you: if the matter, apply it with the censures of the learned, they will
countenance the same; if the handling, I repent me not, for I had rather you
should now condemn me for default in Rethoricke, then as in times past, commend
my style, and lament my judgment: neither let it seem displeasant, that
herein I affect not vain flourish, for that I am experienced in this point of
the law, that the mind is mightier then the words; beside, this is a certain
principle, Vbi men's est certa, de verbis non curatur: The Poet saw this, when
he song thus: Ornari res, ipsa negat contenta doceri.


Thus resolved both of the matter, and satisfied in my method, I leave the
whole to your judgments, which if they be not depraved with envy, will be
bettered in knowledge, and if not carried away with opinion, will receive much
profit. For as the Apothicary uses his drugs, so do I my delights, I make no
protestation or show of the purest and best simples, but for those conceits are
shrunk in the wetting, spoild by the have, and are corrupted by irregard,
those wanting matter to sol themselves, had need of good words to suit them:
play you therefore the wise merchants, buy not that only which delights the
eye, and touches the ear, but buy that which perfecteth the judgment and
enricheth the memory. The thought that is light, tempts the mind and
vanishes, but those principles that hasten our experience, perfect our
memories. These considered, read, judge, and use me as best pleases you; for
to beshort, my scope is your profit, and my good Genius, your praise and
encouragement.

Yours in all profitable delights. T. L.

The Devil coniured.
AMidst the inhospitable mountains of Egypt (during the reign of Constantine
the renowned and religious Roman Emperor) there lived a virtuous and solitary
Hermit called Anthony, who forsaking his possessions, which were great, and
renouncing the world as vain, made the poor rich by his liberality, and his
soul happy by his charity, his bodily desires, he suppressed by fast, his
souls perturbations, by constant resist, his sollace, was solitude, his
pleasure, prayer: his law, godly fear, his hope heaven, his dinner time, the
sun set: his nights rest, watchful meditation: if he slept, it was standing,
to mortify his flesh; if he praid, it was kneeling, to show his humility: his
meat, bread; his sauce, salt; his drink, water; his profession was ignorance,
but in heavenly things; and his knowledge perfect wisdom, (not expressed in
vanity of words, but in virtue and practice of good deeds.) To this holy
Hermit resorted many, some presuming on their own wits, other suspecting their
own infirmities; this to receive council in his discontent, that to gather
comfort from his ghostly preachings, (for they commonly are most apt to
reform others, who have maistered their affections and mortified their
passions.) Among the rest as one of greatest mark, but of weakest mind, came
Metrodorus the Tirian, who better skild in Plato, Empedocles, Democritus; than
in true wisedeme, humility, and meditation: came to visit Anthony, rather of
purpose to carpe, then resolution to conceive. The next was Asterius of
Tapadocia, who for practice in Magic, and consulting with devils, was
banished Rome, and sent into Egypt. The last Frumentarius the Indian, who
earnestly desirous to see the man who was renowned for so many miracles, had
forsaken his country, entered the deserts, met with these companions, and at
last found out Anthony: and where should virtue be found, if not in solitude?
Where (as the Philosopher thinks) men rather intend their conscience, then
their fame, and where (according to the opinion of Nicephorus) nothing is
studied, but purity of mind, nothing more affected, then severity in life, and
felicity in meditation: But where found they thee O holy Anthony? What office
becoming thy happy spirit? What exercise were thou accustomed in? Truly (as
Gregory says) slaying, and sacrificing thy will; by obedience, pouring out,
and offering thy soul in prayer; testifying thy contrition, by thy trickling
tears: thus in thy earthly body did thou practice an immortal work, and
with the immoued eye of thy mind, did thou behold God in faith. Till a
stonished at the sudden approach of these worldly men, thou were saluted by
them and cut off (by this friendly discourse) from thine earnest and happy
contemplations: Father Anthony, in regard of thy reverend years, I am come to
salute thee: and in respect of thy desolate and solitary life, to reprove
thee, for my experience (teaching me to judge things) has enlightened my reason
to censure follies: What life is this thou leadest? Where all things that
should nourish nature are contemned, and each thing that may hasten death is
sought after? Nature has given thee a body to maintain it, not to mortify
it: fortune has given thee riches not to despise them, but to prise them: thou
art borne to honor, why seek thou then obscurity? to thy country, why
forsakest thou it? If it be felicity thou desire, study thy health, (for
according to the Epicure) not to be touched with sickness is the interest of
pleasure: labor to be mighty, that thy authority may help thy friend, and
suppress thy foe: endeavor to be rich, for affluence makes our life happy,
and our posterity fortunate: strive to be wedded, that thou may have
children, to be fortunate, that thou may be famous, to be beloved in the
world, that thou may command the world. To be obscure, is to be miserable:
and the greatest infelicitie in life, is to be despised: look into the works
of nature and condemn thy self, flowers in the bud have no air till they be
blossomed, stones in the mine, are obscure till they be polished, fruit on the
tree, is sower, till it be ripened. It begins in a twig, that grows to a
tree, and by course of kind all things are made to increase, and by increase to
profit: why then defraudest thou thy self of natures benefits? She made thee
fair to be beloved, beautiful to be known, fortunat to be beautiful, of a
child she made thee man to become strong, thy strength she employed to increase
thy courage, thy courage she imparted, to express thy fortitude: lastly, she
gave thee fortitude to serve thy country: He is a devil amongst men that
profits no man, and who lives only to himself, seems to be borne in
spite of society. Solitudes are for beasts, cities for men, and he rightly is
held a thief in society, that robs his country of his service: if thou
wonder who tells thee this, know it is Metrodorus (not the corrupt usurer of
Athens, but the great Philosopher of Tire) who am come both to school thee by
Philosophy, and confound thee in arguments. Anthony that had heard him speak
with much patience, and examined his arguments as he uttered them, by this
reply, drove him into melancholy, and the rest into admiration. Metrodorus,
sit down and let these thy associats actompanie thee, for in thwarting thy
corrupt reasons by good proofs, I shall make thee ashamed of thine obstinacy,
and these men fearful of the like folly: Thou reproouest my life, because
solitary; not considering this, that a good man is never less alone then when
alone (as Themistocles said:) and the senses commonly wanting their objects of
offense, are less subject to fall: a desolate life, exempteth us from
dissolute desires, and where there are less baits of sin, the soul is least
of all soiled. Oh Philosopher thou art blind, not in thy bodily eyes, but in
the eyes of thine understanding? Sensuality seeks ease, devotion
chastisement, Thou cuttest down the thorns that let the way when thou
iourniest, thou forsakest the path that is muddie and mirie, thou fliest the
climes that are cold and uninhabited, what then should let thee to mortify thy
flesh, to quicken thy spirit, to subtue thy body, to lighten thy soul: and to
forsake the path of this world, to walk directly to celestial Paradise: it is
a law among your sects, for eloquence, to follow Cicero, for excellence,
Demosthenes, for Philosophy, Plato and Aristotle, for the Mathematics,
Euclide: What then lets me (O Metrodorus) to imitate Christ? whose life is a
law to mine, and whose abstinence a lesson to instruct me? O that thou knew
the thing thou despisest, and were as expert in practice, as malepert in
reproof: the solitary man (I tell thee) living on the earth, forsakes the
same, and mortified in the flesh is planted in heaven by the spirit: he burns
in the love of God, to banish the love of this world, he weepeth transitory
tears, to receive eternal consolation: he fasteth in body, to be fed in soul:
he depresseth himself to be lifted up to heaven: he watches and thirsts, to
be refreshed in Paradise: he labors in this worle, to have rest in another,
finally flying the works of all uncleanness, he not only deploreth the
misery of his thoughts, if they taste the world, but lamenteth likewise the
default of his actions, if they do but stumble on the world: O happy
contemplative men (says a father) whose tribulation is their sollace: whose
contumely, is their glory: whose want, their abundance (worldly as thou art)
how wicked are thy counsels? Thou persuadest me to the world, that in nothing
is more noted then impugning God: Christ wills poverty, the world contemns
it: Christ blesses the sorrowful, the world flies the haunt of the unhappy:
Christ commands mortificatio^, the world to cherish the body: and (to
conclude) Christ teaches us to be obedient, the world to be ambitious: in the
world we find nothing but inticements of offense, the relics of vanity, the
treasons of flattery, the fruits of presumption: in the world example
perucrteth us, custom depraueth us, and counsel distracteth us, for (as
Lecosme says) men are too apt to imitate, and whose virtues they cannot
attain, their vices they speedely practice. Look into natural effects, fire
kindles fire, like begets like, earth fatneth earth, and then conclude that
pride engenders pride; wrath, displeasure; blasphemy, blasphemy; and what
men see commonly, they hold lawful in themselves: what shall I think of this
world, but that it is a rock whereon all mortal men make shipwreck; a desert,
wherein men are soon lost; a sea, wherein we are quickly suncke, full of
perils, full of snares: In it desires inform, vanities assault, lucre
flattereth, rebels terrify, detractions afflict, and commendations pervert: we
are betrayed by the world in the amplitude of riches, betrayed by the weakness
of poverty, betrayed by the loftiness of pride, betrayed by opinions of
vanity: health tempts us, infirmity tempts us, the one yielding us matter
of negligence, the other cause of sin. There is a snare in security, a snare
in fear, neither is there much difference whether the earthly mind be
possessed of ioies, or cares, whereas the sickness is one, either to rejoice
under vain delights, or to labor under grievous perturbations. For riches,
they are instruments of temptations, snares of the devil, norishers of vain
desires, fruits of our perdition: it is very rare says Gregory for him that
possesses gold to enjoy rest, and impossible for them that wholly haunt after
riches in this life, to hope for the ioies of the other life: who hastes to be
rich, can hardly be innocent: and who studieth to increase his goods,
neglects to lament his sins: who desire to be heirs of this world, loose
their immortal inheritance: what profits it a man to gather all that which
is without himself, if he damn that only which is himself? It then worldly
wealth be so cursed in getting: what miseric inforceth it not in the use and
possession: Believe me, believe me, riches extinguish the study of virtue,
mortify the thought of celestial things, disturb the memory, divert the
love, and convert all sanctity to sensuality: who so is greedy to get, is
ready to do wrong, purchase breeds much fruit, usury more hate,
merchandise much fear, all manner of gain al manner of trouble: Poverty is the
parent of virtue, Wealth the stepdame; and who contemns secular ioies,
deploreth sempiternall: Hierome so thought and so writ, That virtues and riches
could not agree in one breast, using in this cause, the example of Crates the
rich Theban, who going to Athens to study Philosophy, cast away a great sum
of money, thinking it impossible for riches and virtues to agree in one
possession: Blessed is he (says a father) who has not followed those things,
which being possessed, burden man; and beloved, defile him: and lost, crucify
him. Besides all this, the misery and danger in getting, the sorrow and harm
in use and possessing, consider the infinity, and affinity, of vices that
follow lewd increasing: The memory of death, martireth the rich: Temporal
abundance, breeds forgetfulness of eternal: briefly, as weed has his
worm, so the worm of wealth is his pride: What is a rich man, but a living
dead man? Or what can he challenge to be his, who has his wealth Lord of
himself, his mind subject to his wealth, and all estranged from God? how shall
I call riches but the chains of sin, where pride is coupeled with lust, and lust
is mounted in this chariot: The four wheels that draw it, are four vices;
the abuse of surfeit, the delicacie of attire, the abundance of sleep and
idleness, and lastly, the heat of filthy lust: the horses of this chariot are
backed by these two guides, The dullness of sloth, and the blindness of
security: and of purpose are these coachmen without spurs, because in ye
kingdom of pleasure, there should be nothing that might induce sadness, or
produce remorse: only dissimulation and improuidence bear the canapie, to
shadow man's eye from repentance, until he fall into the snare of his own
damnation. Thou blamest me for not being ambitious, not considering this, that
ambition is a subtle evil, a secret poison, a hidden plague, a srautfull
workman, the mother of hypocrisy, the parent of hate, the fountain of sin:
the bait of offense, the rust of virtue, the moth of holiness, the blinder of
hearts, creating diseases of remedies, and begetting griefs of medicines: Thou
willest me to cherish and to norify my body, but virtue to chasten it: for the
flesh by every light motion is subject to commotion, and he that will sit
surely on an unbridled colt, must cunningly break him. Pithagoras seeing one
of his followers pampering his flesh, and affecting belly cheer, why (says he)
art thou about to build a prison for thy self? And Plato understanding what
wounds the mind received by the wicked inticements of the body, purposelie
chose out an unhealthful Academy in Athens, that by such means he might
correct the good disposition of the fare. Thus in their blindness perceived
these Philosophers that contemplation has no enemy more capital then our
proud and frail flesh. O Metrodorus, I hate not my body, but the corruptions
thereof, and I only in this love my self, in that I chastise my self:
worthily said Leo in a certain sermon So much more every man loves himself
by how much he hates himself for Gods love. Thou persuadest me to wed, to
increase the world, and I say the world had more need of weeding then wedding.
Thou say that marriage is a blessing, but I know it to be the sourse of
miseries, for children being borne, make their parents careful: and unborn,
miserable: living, unfortunate: and dead desolate. To this man the multitude of
children breeds a joy to possess the^, but this joy is extinct if he want to
relieve them: to that man the want of an heir is noisome, who has toild away
life to get great possessions, and wants a son to increase his posterity: so
that the ones good fortune, is the others calamity, and each of them desires
that success wherewith he sees his neighbor to be excruciat. This man has
lost a sweet boy by death, that lamentetha lewd son in life, and both of these
worthy commiseration, for the one greeueth at his boys death, the other at
his sons life. O scope of man's vanity, where all things that are desired grow
tedious, and the greatest benefits that are possessed, wax troublesome. O
Metrodorus, accuse me not for flying the world, for it deceives all men, the
king by security, the prince by ambition, the magistrate by corruption, the
merchant by misfortunes, all men, by being the world. He that dwells in
Sodom cannot escape the shower of fire? he that loves Egypt must live in
servitude, and who will be of the world must not be without temptations: since
therefore God is my portion, suffer him to be mine only pleasure, since the
world is so wicked, learn thou to forsake it: Leave thy sandy foundations of
this earth to build on the sure rock Christ, honor poverty, for it mortifieth
worldly cares, and trauaileth to God without let: It is the end of grief, the
ground of peace, the cleannes of life, that delivers us from the cares of
this transitory world and tieth us to the laws of eternal righteousness:
study obedience, for it is better then sacrifice: Learn humility, for it
norisheth the soul, being pure Manna to feed the devout mind, and Elebony to
purge the ambitious: Finally proud Philosopher learn to correct thine own
life, before thou condemn others, for he soonest misdoeth, that vainlie
misthinketh. No sooner had Anthony ended this discourse, but Metrodorus quite
confounded, sat eying the ground, Asterius amassed beheld the heavens. Whilst
weeping Frementarius broke out into this discourse: (Solitary and sacred)
behold the fruits of thy wisdom, thou have put obstinacy to silence, drawn
curiosity to admiration, whetted ignorance to contemplation. Now therefore
what thou have wrought by word, win by examples: for as Tully says, examples
if they savor of antiquity, yield great authority in their proof, and
pleasure when they are heard: My son (quoth Anthony) if obstinacy wax
silent, there is hope he will hear, if curiosity admire, he begins to affect:
and since thou in ignorance do contemplate, thy zeal bursteth out into
tears, which both express thy remorse (in respect of thy deserts) and thy
desire to increase in virtue: to seal them therefore to God whom he has
gently sommoned, I will report a true history, as full of admiration as of
certainty, and in event so certain as they are impudent that impugn it.
Amidst those lusty mountains of Italy that divide the indestious Sabins from
the warlike Marsians, there lived a reverend and respective father, called
Menas, who forsaking the sollace of the world, took his only delight in
solitary meditation: of whose life there are as many famous witnesses, as
Samnia has fortunate warriors: This holy Hermit forsaking the resorts of men,
consorted only with God; growing one with him in charity, who was and is the
only fountain of all charity: never rose the sun but prevented by his
prayers: never shut the evening, but out worn by his meditations: never was he
pensive, but beholding the presumptions: never more pleasant, then in
confirming a Conuertite: his riches was a hiue yielding him honey, and the honey
of his persuations suckled, and fed the weak minds: Whilst thus he lived and
thus perfited; It for tuned that certian straglers that had left the Army of
the Lumbards, to intend and follow pillage, ignorant in the ways of Italy,
lost their direct way, and by good hap fell into this desert: where traveling
long without either pleasure or profit, and in a desert disinhabited, where no
victuals might be had, to assuage hunger: they at last hit on Menas cave, where
they found him slacking his hunger with herbs, quenching his thirst with
water, and rather feeding to continue life, then to pamper nature. Where
showing themselves by their inciuilitie, they not only robbed him of his meat,
spoiled and took away his hiue, but beyond all reason beat him cruelly: The
good old man that had no help but from heaven, nor weapon in his hand to
defend him, but his tongue, praying earnestly whilst he was persecuted, at
last brake out into this persuasion. What outrage is this you soldiers?
whereas you neither respect age, nor regard devotion, neither fear God, nor
regard the laws? wild beasts assail not unprovoked, Serpents sting not vntrod
on, the harmless bird is no Harpies prey; shall then a Hermit in devotion; an
old man in years, a poor man in fortune, be subject to your tirannies? In the
law of kind you are cursed: for by it you are to endure no more to be done to
others, then you can quietly admit in your own causes: then since none of you
can easily suffer injury, beware to be over earnest in offering it to other
men: In the law written, all theft is forbidden: then what are you but law
breakers that use violence? The law of grace condemns you, for it enioineth
you to give of your own to other men, but you drive other men from their own.
O what impiety is this, to defraud nature, to abuse God, to despise grace, and
afflict man? In the Roman laws (as Cato witnesses) thieves were punished by
the double, and taxed to restore twice that thing in value, which they had
taken away by villainy: in Gods law thieues are excluded from Gods kingdom: Oh
earthly men consider what you loose by winning so wickedlie, you loose your
living souls, to norish your deadly sins: you loose heaven to purchase hell:
You loose honor to win infamy, briefly the poor curse you, the rich hate
you, the Prince condemns you, the Magistrate plagueth you: what miseries then
work you for your self, when on earth you are estranged from all society, in
heaven forsaken for your impiety, in hell everlastingly plauged for your
security? Oh repent you presently, or too lately, is too lamentably: who
deferreth his repentance, hasteneth his plague; where time is swift, the world
but a shadow, man's life but a moment, his death imminent, how vain is his
delay in repentance, where revenge outstrippeth time, terrifieth the world,
shortneth the shortness of life, and whets on death and damnation? Further,
would this holy father have discoursed, and more earnestly would he have
urged his arguments: But that a miscreant wretch (who had never God in his
lips, but to blaspheme him, nor remorse in his heart where blood was to be
shead, seeing the rest of his fellows some what amazed at these his
persuasions) drew out his sword and purposelie ran at him to pierce his breast:
when lo after a terrible and hideous cry, the heaven ouercast, the earth
opened, and from the lowest hell a fiend appeared in shape, ouglie; in threats,
dreadful, who seazing the sinful wretch, first flong him up into the air,
then threw him on the ground, sometime turning his lims from their natural
places, other whiles thundering out oracles of the wretches condemnation, till
Menas moved by compassion, and his companions terrified by example, humbly
kneeling dispossessed him by prayer whom the Devil had possessed for his sin*
finally the catiue reconciled, his soultiers scholed, and Menas recompensed,
they returned to their army reporting his fame, whilst he resorted to his
meditations to yield thanks for their reconcilements. Neither was Gods power so
tied to defend him from men, but that he likewise protected him from savage
beasts, so that being earnest in their prey, he subdued them by prayer: making
them fear at his presence, who otherwise caused all men to run from their
pursuit: His study likewise was to have nothing in this world, and having
nothing, to contemn all things: his charity was to embrace all that visited
him, and to convert all that heard him: free was he in reproouing the proud,
and reconciling the penitent; To be short, his solitude made him beloved of
God, defended from men, preserved from beasts, and lastly a Citizen of heaven:
Metrodorus that had left his solitary thoughts to listen to his holy
history, hearing so many miracles, at first grew amazed, but subdued by self
opinion (which quickly peruerteth our faith,) he brake out into this reply,
which be wrated his infirmity. Though thy life old Hermit be the example of
modesty, yet thy words are so wonderful as they deserve no credit, miracles
are for more then men, and those are our best objects that are subject to our
senses: bring therefore better authority to confirm our belief, or for my
part I shall think the story is rather an Hiperbole, then a history.
Metrodorus (quoth Anthony) this proves thee to be carnal, because thou
comprehendest nothing that is eternal: and therefore worldly wits (as Gregory
says) believe not spiritual things, because they behold not that in
experiment, which they hear by report: the reasons whereof I will express
thee, because I am willing to confirm thee: Look as a child borne in prison,
and nourished in obscurity, bearing nothing but the solitary cries of his
mother, and seeing nothing but the desolation of all delight, seems holy
assured in the (...) of his senses and suspicious in all other approved
certainties, so that if his mother tell of the sun, he believes nothing but
obseuritie: if she talk of (...) Moon and Stars, he trusts nothing to be,
in that he sees not their being: so carnal men having all things by hearsay,
believe nothing but in experience, living in the obscurities of the world, they
admit nothing that exceeds their conceits, and having the mark of sin in
their bodies, norish not the light of contemplation in their souls: With Adam
their father they are taxed to labors, but with Adam their father they
conceive not their fall, for the memory of his former pleasures remains in
him, but the remisconceit and worldly blindness choketh the^: he remembering
his former happiness, vert: they nourished in their worldly frailties,
delight therein; and wanting faith to assist the report of heavenly things,
they want power to conceive ought but earthly things: men choked by the
world, are drowned in the world; the obscure man holds his country a Paradise,
because he knows no other, and Mopsa with her bleared eye is as dear to
Nisus, as Phillis with her fair face to Amyntas: world lie men's delight is
tied to their knowledge, and what they see, they commend, and what they hear,
they suspect: They only that know the world truly, trust it not in well
knowing it, by faith they apprehend things unseen, and by the spirit are
assured of their uncertainties: Christ by becoming man, proves that nothing
is impossible to God; by partaking infirmity, nourishes our saiths: and we
that know his sufferance exceeds our senses, must conclude, that only faith
must apprehend his Deity. To them that believe, he makes all things possible;
the holy Ghost helps them, who breeds charity; their charity inflameth
them, which norisheth faith; their faith assures them being grounded in
charity. To them that believe not, that which they see not, he gives over to
trust in that which they should not: in blindness they live, in obstinacy they
continue, and desperate they die. O Metrodorus, believe antiquity, for as by
many discents, our progenies are maintained, so by memorable reports, the truth
retains his perfection: To believe only that which we have seen, is to
condemn all that which our fathers have observed: and to tie all things to our
senses, is to confess we have no living and reasonable souls. Thus far
prosecuted old Anthony his persuasions, and so fruitfully listened Metrodorus
to his sound reasons, that the one reioiced to see the others conformity, and
the other applauded the Hermits zeal and industry. Thus he that came to
object, was taught to learn: and he that presumed too much on his own power,
was learnt to know his weakness: Mean while Asterius inflamed with the self
same fire, and willing to disconer his wound, to the end he might recover
medicine, Thus kindly saluted Anthony, who as willingly listened: Father (quoth.
he) since desperate cures, assure the Physicians cunning, and fruitful
persuasion, shows the orators forcible eloquence, I will cast off fear, and
become forward: knowing thy perfection by experience, and disclose the
infirmities of my mind, that they may be healed: with the happy cordials of
thy counsels: Do so my son said Anthony, and let me hear thee that I may
know thee. Asterius thus encouraged (after a deep sigh) began this solemn
discourse: Those that have heard of Asterius (O Hermit) have either named him
with fear or followed him with admiration: for that Magitian am I, who by my
charms have tied the clouds, restrained showers, enchanted trees, made barren
women; tired the fish in the sea, bound the birds in the air: forcing nature
to submit to my art, and all science to be subject to my incantations: in Rome,
the learned favored me, the Senators winckt at me, the commons presented me,
the maidens visited me, none durst provoke me: For which causes waxing proud,
and by pride foolish obstinate, it chanced that some strise grew betwixt me and
Sixtus then Bishop of Rome, whom the Romans honored for his holiness, and I
hated for his virtues; His contention with me was to dissuade from magic, my
arguments against him were fatal exorcismes, his purpose to reclaim me from
sin, My practice to desraud him of life: Thus (his zeal working one way, my
envy another way,) at last we met in an appointed place, where he falling to
prayers, and I to practice: if I troubled the air with clouds, he cleared the
sky with orisons: briefly, coniuring up a Devil, under purpose that
violently he should drive him away, Sixtus by his prayers bound him, on his
authority exiled me: My banishment confirmed by Senate, allowed by the people,
and desired by the godly, I came into Egypt, purposing to find thee out, that
by some debate of learning I might know the dignities of magic: for so
delightful is the emperie over nature, the knowledge of the stars, the
commanding of spirits, the manner of exorcisme, that in steed of forsaking
them, men rather earnestly affect them: if therefore thou hold it piety (O
Anthony) and these gentlemen esteem it won time, that bewraieth truths; let
us sit and confer first of the nature of devils, then consequently of the
inclination of the stars, the works of Astrology, and the power of Magic:
That I may be either bettered in my knowledge, or no more bewitched with these
calamities: What (quoth Frumentarius the Indian) is it possible there should be
devils, where neither Aristotle the master, nor the Peripateticks his scholars
ever knew them? for they ascribe to the planets that which we attribute to the
seinds, to the celestial bodies, what you to the infernal spirits, to causes
natural, what you to miraculous. It Is true my friend (quoth Anthony) that
philosophers thought so, but since we know there are effects above nature, (as
to recite verses, site authority, and repeat latin, in a ignorant demoniaque)
it follows that their allegations are found, and our foundations sound,
neither was the Stragerite only more ignorant in this point, but some
Christians have showed less judgment, for confessing there are devils, they
yet differ in this, that not taking devils as we mean, they suppose them to be
the souls of men: to whom it may be answered (according to corrected doctrine)
that the soul being a bodilesse substance, cannot be translated into the
substance of the devil being incorporeate: other errors there be rather to be
wincked at, then be written, suffered by divine policy to take head, first to
extinguish mane presumption, next to confirm truths authority. Upon what
conclusion then shall our faith rest said Frumentarius, where authorities are
so different, reasons so dissident? Upon truth quoth Anthony, which being it
self, is never deceived: What proves more there are devils then the
prohibition to sacrifice to them, Leuit. 17? What shows their sacrifice to be
more impious, the^ the impiety urged against the Israelites in that practice?
Deuteronomy. 32. Hieroboam sacrificed to Devils, in Job, in Tobie, in the Evangelists,
the proofs are manifest in that cause, that therefore which is manifest by
demonstration, needs no proof: blind Philosophy confirms them, and shall
we suspect them? Oracles approve them, shall we deny them? That there are
devils (O Hermit) said Metrodorus, no man suspecteth it, but respect of the
authority of their names, and the prescript of their power, therein lies our
question: And I shall resolve thee, Metrodoius (quoth. Anthony) in these
difficulties: The Devil has diverse denominations, according to his diverse
workings, he is called Diabolos of Dia, which is Duo and Bolos, which is
Morcellus as he that desires to swallow two morcels, the body and soul. The
Hebrews term him Diabolus quasi deorsum sluens, The Greeks a calumner or
accuser, the Latins, Angelus malus, for his bad tidings: He is likewise called
Satan, because an adversary: and Demon, because experienced in many things,
and Belial, because yoakles; and an Apostata: Leuiathan, because the complement
of all this, devouring soul and body, affecting and seeking obscurity;
accusing and calumniating the just, bringing message of mischief: assailing us
by his craft, beguiling us by his experience, seduring us by his Apostacy, and
planting in us the excess of all impiety. Briefly devils, as a father says,
are desirous to hurt, deuoid of Justice, swelling in pride, swallowed with
envy, crafty in deceit, who dwell in this air, and being cast from the
height of the superior heaven, are ordained and destinated to the prison of
obscurity, in regard of their pride, and restraint of their power: Their power
is tied, not in such sort as they may not tempt, but as they may not tempt as
they desire: by nature and permission, they may do things in semblance true,
and seeming to the fantasy: as ye Magitians (rods in respect of Moises) by
permission, as spoiling Job and his flocks: yet both these acts are held
miraculous not in respect of nature, but in respect of senses debilitie: Over
good men the devils have power to prove, not to destroy: over bad to destroy,
except repentant: Their prison, is the darkesome air, till the time of the
Judgment, their hell the retreat of horror, from whence the issue is
remediless. In man's envy they tempt and impugn: in his pride usurp and
confound: They assail men by objects, because they know the senses most
flexible; they assail by passion, assured that the soul is subject to
perturbations: they assail by fantasy, because as Aristotle says, the brain
and heart are most subject to unpression and fantasies: They seduce by
persuasion, or inciting passion, and that in two sorts, as Damascene
witnesses, where he says, Omnem malitiam and immund as passiones a daemonibus
fuisse excogitatas and inuentas: Those in the air, are till the judgment
enclosed for our exercise, to impugn, tempt, and assault us; not beyond our
power. Some already in hell which as now only afflict the soul, but after
judgment shall torment both body and soul. But is it true (grave father,
quoth Metrodorus) that the malignant spirit appears to man on his death bed?
Too true Metrodorus (said Anthony,) and that by common course, for if it be
certain that a good angel is assistant to relieve and succor us, it is
necessary that an evil angel should be pressed to tempt us: for as the one is
to help, the other is to destroy: and further as a Father says, as in the
issue of a conquest men show greatest value, so the nearer we approach to our
end, the busier is the feind to seduce us: as appeared by Martin the Bishop who
seeing satan assistant at his death bed said thus: Quid hic astas cruenta
bestia? In what manner, quoth Frumentarius (my good father Anthony) appear
they? for as spiritual, they cannot be seen, because there ought to be
proportion betwixt the object and the power. I tell thee myson (answered
Anthony) they either appear imaginatiuely by moving humors and blood (and
thereby form certain apparitions) or they appear in assumpted bodies,
appropriat to their intents: and if suppositiuelie, or according to
imagination, they appear to none but to those to whom the vision appertains:
but if in an assumed body, it is by their power, and in that sort are subject
to many men's sights: Besides in temptations they aim at five things, first to
corrupt faith by error: next to keep man in superstition: thirdly, to induce
vice: fourthlie, to produce tediousness, and we arinesse in affliction:
Lastly to confirm men in their iniquities, that by that means they may be
finally condemned and eternally perish. Besides, they continually tempt in
desire, not in power: in desire, because they are envious; in power because
they fear to be subdued, and suspect their own weakness, and to the end
they might make the just secure from temptations. That there are workings then,
we are sure by devils, because they be: that they hate we perceive, because
they seduce: that they are proud, we are resolved, in that they rebeld: that
they are self lovers, we know, for it was their sin, all this thine
arguments infer, or thy reasons approve: but for Magic, we doubt, and in
Magic we would be resolved: discourse therefore good Anthony of that secret.
What should he discourse said Frumentarius, where Pliny condemns it as false,
scorns it as vain, and denies it for any thing? One instance (quoth
Anthony) in Logic destroies not an universal proposition, neither is private
reproof a general conviction. That it is, it appears, because forbidden:
that it is forcible, it is manifest, because taxed and condemned by law: The
name imports effects above nature, which though received for art is but mere
folly. They define Magic to be the worker of many effects, the reasons whereof
are neither comprehended by sense, nor by any reason may be subject to the mind
or understanding. The schoolmen likewise divide it as being of two sorts, the
one natural, conuersing only in secret, and ending in natural virtues: which
though unknown to most men, is only admirable for obscurity, not effect;
(for those effects are unrightly admirable which are incident to nature:) the
other diabolical, condemned by God, laws, and customs. Touching the natural,
it may be wrought without the concomitance or assistance of any spiritual
body: and those are rightly called Magi, who are expert in those sciences, and
practiced in those works: for example, consider these wondrous effects which
resemble preposterous and diabolical actions, yet in effect are merely
natural: as is the stone Molaris, which is found in Tigris (which as Aristotle
in his book De animalibus witnesses) being carried about a man defends him
from the incursions of wild beasts: and the herb Dictamnum, which being
devoured by goats drives out those arrows wherewith they are wounded (as
Pliny and other testify:) And touching the effects of the loadstone, if it
were generally unknown to man, he that first should either show it or use it,
should be held a Magician: for he should meerlie work miracles, and seem both
the author and agent of incredible matters: diverse fathers there be that have
diversely written of these secrets, one of an iron ring fastened to a
loadstone, which by the virtue of the attractiue mineral, drew linck by linck
many other to the first, till it seemed an absolute and united chain. Another
registreth the history of a wonderful fountain, in which torches were
extinguished; and extinct, were lighted again: Architas Dove, Dedalus
Laborinth, both but the Proiects of wit, were held Magical and admirable: John
of Mountroyall the Almaigne (so memorable in Ramus, in his book of
Mathematical observation) made an eagle, which before the Emperor mounted into
the air, and afterward duly stooping, followed him to his gate. His fly,
likewise of iron, who beholding it would not rather have held him for a
diabolical Artist, then an excellent Naturalist? So then it may be concluded
rightly, that Natural Magic is a part of the most vnserched, and hidden
Philophie, which were it come to knowledge of the ignorant, and practice of the
learned, it should quickly leave the name of Magic, and loose no title
amongst all other confirmed sciences: when therefore our eyes behold, or our
senses be affected with any such extraordinary conclusions, we are not
straightwaies to condemn them as erroneous, but to learn to know and censure
them, the better to increase our judgments: Touching the Diabolical (which
consists on no natural causes or forces, but is effected by some
immateriall, and seperable virtue and power:) It is approved to be by these
reasons. First because certain actions thereof are, neither subject to
natural causes, nor may be referred to celestial bodies: as for example, the
oracles and answers of Magitians, either for finding treasure, discovering
hidden things, or declosing thefts: next because there were some statues of
Magitians which gave answer to diverse questions; thirdly it is apparent that
by personal assist, or murmuring of exorcisme, certain locks have been
opened, (and other such like kind of works) which being neither subject to the
power of nature, nor disposed by celestial influence: we must needlie confess
that such sort of Magic is relying only on virtue immateriall, and not on
causes natural. If Diabolical Magic then in his wonders be so manifold, why
does God (intending the salvation of man) permit and suffer it to seduce him?
or if there be wonders wrought thereby, whether is it by true effects, or
illusion of the eyes and senses (said Frumentarius). I will answer thee briefly
(my friend) to thy present demands (said Anthony) first God permits
Magic, to the end that men weakened in faith, should be proved: and those who
are depraved in manners, and credulous in lies, should be seduced by their own
desires: next touching the effects and works thereof, I say the most is done by
illusion and deceit of the senses: being both false and fained in themselves,
and done by the vanity and error of wicked men: The proof whereof, and the
confirmation of the premises, though it be apparent in the transformation of
Circes and Medea (so famous and memorable in Poets, and others) as also in
Diomedes men transformed into birds, Ulysses companions into beasts, and such
like: yet rely I on this conclusion, That whereas of all arts whatsoever,
there remains some token, work, or method worthy memory; (as statues,
Images, goodly buildings and such like) yet of Magic there is neither any
Image, ring to be heard of, principles to be read of, only the most is written
of Zoroastes, the inuenter (as Aristotle writes) and is, that he drew many
thousand verses, but how true he speaks not; so that in truth it seems to
be a fained thing for the most part, building more on illusion then truth,
although in truth unlawful Magic has his actual working. How prove you
that quoth Metrodorus? By scripture answered Anthony, where it appears that
Pharoahs Magitians converted their rods into Serpents, Exodus 7. Not (as
Rauclinus and Rabanus think) by prestigious and deceitful illusion: but (as
both schoolmen, and fathers anow) by true, and vntained conversion. Resolve us
yet in this conclusion (quoth Asterius) whether all works of Magic, be
meerlie natural without relation, or dependence on separate substances? And
decide us that opinion of the Peripatetiques, and Trismegistus, who strongly
maintain, that all works of Magic, are done either by natural virtue, or
celestial influence; neither that any argument of seperable substances should
be taken from their workings. I confess (said Anthony) that some magical
works are meerlie natural, because I have heretofore confessed there is a
Magic natural, knowing it an assured principle in Philosophy, that there
cannot be a cause without his effects. Besides if I should deny it, it is
confirmed; For to effect these wonderful works, the Magicians commonly use
unknown herbs, which contain present and forcible remedies against all
diseases, (as it appears in the herbs Corisesia and Calicia, which as Plyny
in his second book 17 chapter confesses, does freese water,) and in Meniades,
whose Juice heals the biting of Serpents: many other he alleges, which they
use to enforce and expel sicknesses, which because they are unknown and of
swift operation, they are for that cause esteemed miraculous of all men. And
these magitians may know the virtues of these herbs above named, either by
the tradition of the most famed and renowned Physicians, Pithagoras,
Democritus, Empedocles, and others; or by revelation of the devils: which once
discovered unto them, and in secret delivered to their posterity, they may use
them naturally without concourse or assistance of any good or evil spirit.
There are likewise other works of magitians, which are brought to pass by some
one Immateriall and separated virtue, and the reason is, because there are
certain operations of art Magic, which (as it is said before,) are effected by
some immateriall and separated virtue and power: for whereas these kind of
works exceed natural faculty, and cannot (as it shall be made manifest,) be
referred to good spirits, it must necessarily follow, that they must have
relation to wicked: this sentence is confirmed by the fathers, concluded by the
schoolmen, and made positive by the laws. How then shall the said work be
understood to be done by the virtue of the devils (quoth Metrodorus.) If works
be done exceeding natural faculty, they are magical, if otherwise,
Diabolical (says Anthony:) again those works that are done by ministry of
unknown words, or certain characters, or by such words as are both
impertinent and immateriall, in respect of the operation which is sought or
expected; they may truly be concluded by the Devil: Again, if there be any
rites, or peculiar and determinate obseruances, (as certain hours, a certain
site of stars, or such things as are done by a certain number of crosses or
candles) although the words be sacred, and the manner ceremonious, yet is the
work to be esteemed both magical, and devilish: Again, if in their actions or
works they use any thing dissident from their effects, their works are not of
God, but of the devil: Superstitious suffumigations by hair, absurd sacrifice
by nails, all these in expelling devils, are impious, and in inuocating them,
magical: For if such ceremonies were good, Christ and his Apostles had used
them, if they were effectual, Devils could not be expulsed but by them:
because they submit to betray, and are soly commanded to deceive. Should I
suffer you to urge questions, they would grow to infinite; and, he thus said,
and thus he answered, do quickly wax tedious: I will therefore prevent your
doubts by my knowledge, and satisfy you by reason, in more then you inspect:
There grows a doubt (because self like works are wrought by Magic, as by
the gifts of especial grace) whether God or good angels, he the authors of the
same, or the Devil, and his erorcists the fautors and furtherers? For Apostles
have cast out devils, and so have Apostatas, Moses turned his rod into a
serpent, and so did the magirtans of Pharau; Peter healed, so did the
unbelieving, in Christ's name: the Sinode of the Saints speak in unknown
toungs, and su do the possessed: this doubt is weighty, and thus in two
conclusions resolved: Some works are done by magistans, which are not done by
grace, some other accomplished by grace, which exceed the power of Magic: and
the reason is, because magitians work many enchantments which are altogether
opposite to their course, that work by infused grace: I mean grace not
deservedly gotten, but gratias gratis datas, (gratefully infused:)
contrariwise, prophecy is received amongst the graces, which magicians by no
means can attain unto, (as magitians:) for if devils (according to their own
defects) cannot know things subsequent (which is proper to prophecy) magitians
cannot attain that mystery, who are but Magickes and their ministers: Again
magicians, work nothing by Divine, or Angelical power, for then both Gods law
were faulty in reproouing them for bad, and humane policy should be condemned,
that wholly disanuls them, and their industries: for evil angels invented
sorceries; where God does nothing, neither angels endeavor any thing, but for
pity, goodness and grace; where the devils work nothing but by subtle art,
foolish discipline, and crafty policy. You may like wise ask me if there be
any lawful and godly Magic, patronized by angels, and furthered by them?
And this difficulty may both have reason to defend it, and authority to
countenance it: you may ask me how, and thus I must resolve you: Good angels
(you know) have no less power, if not more, then the evil, but the evil
communicate their power with evil men, why therefore should not good angels be
as forward in furthering the good: The conclusion of this argument is conceived
in these few words which if they be marked as they be meant, may doubtless give
light to the industrious. Good angels communicate to good men for charity:
devils to bad men for worship, and ostentation: the one that God may have the
praise only; the other, that they may deceive wholly. The difference then of
good and evil works twirt good and evil angels, is this, that the one works
in charity, the other in hatred: consequently no magic can be termed holy,
because good angels are not provoked thereby, but work all things in charity:
Again this is a certain proof, in the angels working, that often times and
orderly they work obscurely, and very sildome visibly, the reason thereof is,
because they would not be adored: For men do very easily arrogate Divinity
unto them, whom they perceive efficacious in any kind of wonder: for example,
when Paul (at Listra in Licaonia) had healed lame men in the name of Jesus, the
people would have sacrificed unto him as to a God. And this mistaking is more
dangerous in respect of angels, because they most approximate God in dignity,
and exceed man in purity: and for this cause are angels heedfull to give
occasion to men of Idolatry, because they know their presence is a ready
object of wonder. For this cause (in the nineteenth of the Apocalips) when John
had seen the angel, and fallen down and worshipped him, Beware (says the
angel) least thou do it, (inducing this reason) Conseruus enim tuus sum, and
fratru^ tuorum. Hereupon like wise it may be concluded, that since the angels
are holy, and of the number of the blessed, perhaps they never meddle with
terrene and humane affairs, except by Gods special commandment, and therefore
all those benefits which man receives immediately from God, or by the
ministry of the angels, (seeming to exceed his hope, and surpass our
natural faculty) must be peculiarly and properly ascribed to God, as the
only author. Another doubt may arise, To what cause we should attribute the
sascination and charming of children, by witches, or infants, by inchanters,
which may be thus resolved: that either the witches soul infected with
malice, corrupts the air by her sight, and by yt means infecteth young
infants (especially such who have tender bodies capable of impression:) or
otherwise, such fascination ought to be attributed to the malice of devils,
with whom the foresaid witches are confederat, which comes to pass either by
hidden fate, or Gods permission: For devils cannot delude men, except God
suffers them. Furthermore, whereas the conservation of bodies after death
from corruption, the increase of hair, beard, and nails, in the dead: the
fresh bleeding of a slaughtered body at the presence of the murderer, seem
matters of wonder, and are doubtful whether they are to be ascribed to divine
miracle, or to natures power, or to devils working (and the rather because the
debate thereof, according to many wise men's opinions, has sorted to different
conclusion) I will explain the same in these following propositions: All
miraculous works and apparitions in their kind, ought to be ascribed to these
four: To God, to angels, to Devils, and to holy men, or to their spirits.
Sometimes likewise such wonders may be done by men possessed by the devil, or
by Magitians, or otherwhiles by man's fallacious subsiltie: That such admirable
things may be wrought by the subtlety of the devil, and illusion of wicked
men, it appears in the example of that Demoniack, who when he would, could
counterfeit to be dead, feign blindness, seem lame, or resemble a man
troubled with the dropsy. Miracles likewise may be reduced to natural causes
(which are done about the bodies of the dead) as for example, the preservation
of dead bodies from putrefaction, which (according to some learning) may either
be reduced to the virtue of the place, the nature of the ointment, or some
other corporal thing wherein the body is enclosed; by whose virtues the dead
body is preserved from corruption and inciueration. There may a natural
reason likewise be given of the growth of nails, and increase of hairs, in
the dead, drawn either from the complexion of the dead body, in which some
unperfect vegetative form may be induced; or to the effects of nature, which
dilateth and extends all thing when she begins to suffer any violence.
Sometimes likewise the preservation to dead bodies may be ascribed to divine
miracles, and the reason is, because God sometimes conserueth the dead bodies of
the saints incorruptible, to express their singular sanctity, true innocence,
and integrity of mind, which they insoled in life. Some bodies likewise are
maintained and continued incorruptible for vengeance sake, (as that of Charles
king of Hungary, the excommunicate:) sometimes the bodies of bad men are kept
without corruption by the subtlety of the devil, to the end that this miracle
might be ascribed to their merit in life, and men who detested their
conversation, should admire and wonder at their conservation. As for the
bubling of blood, from the wound of the murdered at the presence of the blood
sucker, this solie is to be ascribed to Gods miracle, enforced to breed horror
of that crime, and detestation of such like impieties: But here may you say
lies there a deep question, because I impose the name of miracle, both to the
works of God, and the prestigious illusion of the devil, confounding them in
name which are different in nature: To which I answer (not without authority)
that the devils actions are improperly miracles; Gods truly: the one done by
preparation, the other suddenly; the one to delude, the other to confirm; the
one to hinder, the other to profit man: Those then that work by the devil, do
miracles improperly, and herein are the true confounded with the false in
denomination, because we cannot distinguish of the sodainnes in performance, or
the speediness in execution. Some suppose and define a miracle to be an
unaccustomed action wrought above the power of nature; wherein there are two
things to be considered: one, that it exceed the ability of nature, the other
that it surpass common custom: Where upon it follows that the creation of a
humane soul is not properly a miracle, for although the creation thereof
exceed the power of nature, yet since it is a thing accustomed, and God
creates souls daily, it may not rightly be called a miracle. Again, a child
borne with seven fingers, a man with two heads, a woman with sour arms, (and
such like) cannot in right be held miraculous, for although such creations are
unaccustomed, yet exceed they not the power of nature, because from natural
causes there may follow such like effects: to conclude therefore positiuelie of
miracles and their natures, I assure you, that things done suddenly by
assistance of Divine virtue for confirmation of truth, and demonstration of
Gods power and wisdom, for erudition of the faithful, and conversion of the
reprobat, are rightly miracles; but matters wrought with intention of deceit,
fruits of subtle insinuation, these are the improper miracles of magicians,
who contended with Moises and Aaron before Pharao, done secundum rem, as the
schoolmen say, but not secundum modum. There is a question likewise, what
magicians do in performing their miracles? namely whether they prepare the
matter only, or induce the form likewise; to which may be answered, that they
prepare the matter only, and have no power to inform: for as fathers are not
held the creators of their children, nor husbandme^ the makers of their fruit
(though in creating of these, gods power inwardly works by admission and
sufferace of their exterior motions:) so neither is it lawful to think that
good or evil angels create, or magicians (the ministers of them) inform; but
to him only may creation be ascribed, by whose power and word, allthinges were
created. Again, (in working things miraculous) this is to be noted, that the
impious only works by permission, the vertuons by impression, and assistance:
the good are enabled by God to perform, the bad induced by the devil to
deceive. God only likewise is said to do miracles by authority, angels and
holy men dispositiuely, bad men and magicians permissiuely: neither is it to be
wondered that magicians raise storms, choke an increase, procure abortion,
(and such like things which the blessed do not) because this power is
restrained in the saints, for fear least weakened by pernicious error, they
should be deceived, supposing there were greater gifts in such like effects,
then in the works of Justice, whereby the soul is enlightened, and eternal life
gained. And therefore Christ said to his Disciples, Luke 10. Rejoice not in
this because spirits are subject unto you, but rejoice because your names are
written in heaven. There is likewise a controversy among the learned, debated
by many arguments, whether magicians by the power of the devil may locally
change, or speedily transfer the bodies of men or beasts, and the rather
because it has been delivered by tradition, and confirmed by the mistaken,
that old women has been transported by spirits from place to place, magicia^s
from country to country, and scholars from Paris to Rome; and on these
grounds there are many opinions, some ascribing these works to the illusion of
the senses, other utterly denieng any such abilities: notwithstanding the
reformed opinions are, that both Devils and Magicians their Ministers may
remove and transfer the bodies of men from place to place: because it is
manifest in Jobs children, where evil spirits overthrow the house on their
heads: again, having power to adhibit corporal seeds to produce some certain
effects, it follows, they have power to remove bodies, because rightly
effects cannot be produced except local motion be made and admitted. There is
likewise a question why women are soonest troubled, and more oftentimes
deceived by the Devil then men be? To which the answer is (for two causes)
First, by reason of their credulity, next because of their frailty and
infirmity: Their credultie appears in that they were first and soonest
tempted; their fragility, in that they are more prone to lust: and therefore
Peter called women the weaker vessels, because they are soonest wrought. And
because carnal desire is the aim of Magicians, and women by nature are more
flexible, it commonly falls out, that there are more women witches tha^ men.
Beside, for their credulities sake, Paul permits them not to teach, least
being themselves deceived, they should pervert others: and therefore a father
said, Quia semel mulier virum and edocuit, cuncta peruertit, idcuco nequaqua^
haec habeat velum, docendi de caeteris potestatem* Father (quoth Frumentarius)
it is happy that women are absent, for should they hear what you speak, you
might perhaps feel more then you wish. You deceive your self quoth Anthony,
for should they hear their infirmity, they would take little cause to presume
so much on their excellency. This is beside the te^^ (said Asterius) Let us
return to our purpose, and resolve us good Hermit, whether Devils or
inchanters may alterate bodies in respect of their qualities, procure
sickness, inflict infirmities, and restore health. By their own virtue
(answered Anthony) neither can Devils or Magicians either in natural, or
material things, immeadiatly induce any form, either by procuring health, or
inducing sickness, by urging heat, or increasing cold: and the reason is,
because if they could induce one form, they might induce all, and by that
means both nature, and the whole world should be subject unto them: but since
it is manifest that God has not subjected the whole world to the good, and
blessed angels; It follows that by no means or reason it may be thought,
that the matter of these visible things in the world and of the world, should
be subject to the beck and service of the transgressiue and accursed angels:
Another conclusion is, that magicians can miraculously change both the matter
and natures of bodies, applying the seeds of things, and ioining active with
passive; and the reason is, that even as art (which imitateth nature) can
effect diverse things, which nature it self cannot; so devils can do many
things which are beyond man's reach, above al art, and besides the accustomed
course of nature, as likewise because celestial influence is very auailable
and active in natural effects:) hence, in planting and husbanding, in physic
and curing, and such like, the observation and consideration of the motion and
course of both Sun and Moon are very necessary, and Devils because they are
expert and cunning Astrologers can better judge and make choice of their hours
to work in: and this perhap is one especial cause why magicians in their
invocation of Devils observe the face of heaven and the site of the stars. The
last conclusion is, that Devils, except restrained by Gods power or prevented
by good angels, can afflict mortal men with grievous calamities, as appears
in Lot whom Satan struck: hereon a schooleman says. Tho. 3. p. q. 29. Art.
1. ad 3. Clementissimus deus non permittit eos vti sua (quam naturaliter
habent) potestati and ab bonis angelis, presertim quibus orbis, and hominum
custodia commissa est impediantur: Our merciful God (says he) suffers them
not to use their natural power, which they have, and they are especially let
by good angels, who have the world and men in their custody. A decideable
subject may likewise be raised on this, whether Devils can cure all diseases,
and draw the line of our life to the extent and utterance of many years? For by
proof we know, and experience find, that many by touch of hand, many by
repetition of words, many by use and bearing of characters, have been healed
being sickly, refreshed being old, and recured in desperate estate. To this I
answer, that in many cures (above the use of arts) the Devils have power, but
in all they have not: the reason is, because their power extends no further
then the application of natural canses, and natural supplements; whereas some
exceed the power of nature being fatal, other the benefits and causes of
nature, as age. Neither can they peculiarly procrastinate and lengthen man's
life (as to a thousand or five hundred years, as in the infancy of the world
men inioied) and the reason is, that man's intemperance and mere ignorance,
has made nature so corrupt and sickly, that neither her sufficient
supplements, whatsoever, may restore man's former integrity: neither are the
heavenly influences so propitious, neither retain the earthly aliments their
former and effectual valor: For God by his Divine providence has so
disposed, that informer times, the natural constellations were more healthy,
the meats more available, the medicines more working, the air more temperate,
the other elements more affectuall, in protracting and continuing life, then
now they be. Many more questions there are, and as subtle as many: induced by
the Devil (of whom we argue) and furthered by his ministers, who^ we impugn.
What a folly is this for man to hope (on his own strength, without the Devils
assistance, to attain the art to form a true humane body, by the only virtue
of natural forces? As it appears in Virgill, subtillie deceived by the
Devil:) where he is not able to make either gold or silver, a homogenicall
body by any color or force of art? Nay what a mischief is in man to trust so
much to a relaps, as he loses the mercy of a releeuer? It is a common fault
likewise in this science, or rather sin, for men to suppose that by some art
or extraordinary means, or man's cunning, Devils may be circumscribed and shut
in determinate and certain places, (as Christals, vials, or such like) or that
they may be tied there by exorcismes, commanded to yield answers; or expelled
upon mislikes: For except Gods help do immediately further angels, or holy
men do immediately command, Devils by no means may be enforced and compelled.
That God may command Devils, it is evident, in that he had authority to make,
power to glorify, and justice to condemn them (as where Christ suffered the^
to enter the Heard of Swine. Luk 12. 72. Gave power to his Apostles to expel
them, briefly limited the^, as in the Apocalips.) That angels may command them,
it must be confessed, because as superiors by natural power they may: that holy
men can, God has showed by miracles: angels likewise as superiors may compel,
because by law of order and course of concord, inferior should not resist
superiors. Besides as in all pollices in governing Cities, in constituting
Commonweales, magistrates are set to repress multitudes, and judges to correct
disorders: so God in the policy of celestial and infernal Hierarchies, has
set angels in love, to corred angels in hate, and by their order without
contrariety to reform the confusion of the Devils perverted monarchy.
Briefly, as to superior motions, inferior are subject; as to the planets, our
bodies are dispositiuely subiugated, so by Divine ordinance good command bad,
to prevent corruption, and are restrained by good, to correct their malice, and
insolence. There are many likewise that suppose the Devil is enclosed in a
ring, ready to give them answer, taxed to submit to their curiosities, always
subject to their commands: wherein they express their folly and their miscrie.
Their folly in supposing him tied, that willingly answers, and appears to
deceive: Their misery, who think they hold the Devil tied in fetters, where
be keeps them fettered in follies. Tell me O Asterius, if man by his own
natural forces, can restrain or imprison a Devil? If thou say yea, thou
errest, for the weaker is subject to the stronger. If thou confess No, then
either ascribe the power to God that truly works it, or say the Devil has
deceived thee, that submits to be thy superior: briefly, think him never well
tied unto thee, except restrained by God, least he deceive thee. I pray thee
tell me (quoth Metrodorus) whether magicians may compel the Devil? Not by
himself I told him, and so assure thee Metrodorus, quoth Anthony: examine thy
self, apply herbs outwardly, speak incantations orderly, and tell me truly
(thy faith being strong) if they can move thee? If thou say they cannot, then
boldly auow they cannot move the Devil, who is thy superior in power, and
seducer by kind: Only that power which magicians have over spirits, is this,
by covenant and league, not by authority and command, They may draw the prince
of Devils to charge his inferior: and without such contract they can no way
enforce the^. I pray you what command is this, where failing in any right,
wanting one ceremony, mistaking due hours, we neither may entreat nor
forwardly command them? Princes in Commonweales, are tied to perform covenants
by bonds, and may break them by prerogatives, or may disannull them by
convictions, or frustate them by displeasures: So in this worlds kingdom the
Devil is condicionate by permission, not force: and sufferance, not power.
Whence then was the art invented (said Frumentarius) to restrain Devils? from
themselves it cannot be, since they affect superiority, and from men it cannot
be, because they deceive them. That Art (said Anthony) which Asterius taught to
shut spirits in vials, and include them in Christals, is not properly an art,
but a conuention, or secret, or public contract, between fraudfull feinds,
and bewitched men), the one affecting singularity, the other Divine honor, to
which if men shall adhibit trust, and suppose them able to help, or mighty to
harm, and under such trust make any image of man, or creature, and consecrate
the same with such figures, charactors, words, suffumigations, and actions, as
are by them thought requisite; then doubtless such consecration ended, some
spirit shall enter the image and give answers, such as will deceive, not such as
can comfort; such as shall eternally destroy, and not relieve: briefly, such
as shall flatter, an Apostata like Julian, to deceive him with Julian. To
conclude, art Magic is the invention and tradition of evil angels, who
therefore (O Asterius) feign themselsues to be taken by thee, that they may take
thee; bound by thee, that they may bewitch thee; subject to thine emperie, yt
they may subdue thee; enclosed by thee, that they may confound thee eternally:
and seem to be tied to thy mirror or crystal, to the end that fastened in
the chains of thy sin, they may bear thee to the prison of eternal
obscurities. There is likewise a prestigious deceit in Devils, whereby they
feign to dispossess bodies possessed, either by force of Music, power of
herb, virtue of stone (or any other sensible thing whatsoever) for such means
as these being subject and passive, the other superior and agent, it is
impossible that any such sensible thing should enforce them: for herbs,
stones, and such other are bodies sensible, but Devils whatsoever, are spirits
separate: so that except some supernatural help from God assist these
creatures, it is against reason, they should enforce the Devils: where then
Satan faineth to yield to incantations, or to be expelled by music, as in
Saul, or driven back by the liver of fish, (as in Tobie) his expulsion is to
be ascribed not to the harmony of the Harp, but Gods power and David's prayer:
neither the other to the smoke of the liver, but to Tobies earnest
intercession. By your leave sir (said Metrodorus) it is not lawful to make use
of the Devils help without sin? It is possible and permissible (quoth
Anthony) by Gods authority: For in the primative church, excommunicants have
been delivered to the power of the devil: and by Paul's example it is
sufferable, since he delivered an incestious man to the hand of Satan to be
punished, ad interitum carnis (as the gloss says.) But on our own
authority, we neither may nor should not, as appears. Leuit. 20. Where it is
said, vir sieve mulier in quibus phyonicus vel diuinationis fuerit spiritus,
morte moriatur; and in the nineteenth, Follow not magicians, neither ask
council of Southsayers: So that hereby it appears, that they sin mortally,
who either for things lost, either for treasure hidden, or such like vanities,
require the advice of coniurers, or search out the assistance of Astrologers.
Three only questions remain holy Anthony, which thoroughly decided, I am fully
satisfied. What are they Asterius. quoth Anthony? The first is, whether witches
or inchanters ministering remedies either for harms done by themselves, or
practiced by others, do offend; The second is, whether it be lawful to use the
help of a magitian in any thing; The last is, whether it be permissible in
good sooth to practice any adiurations or incantations whatsoever? I will answer
these questions (said Anthony) as succinctly as I may, and as truly as I ought:
For the first, they not only sin grievously, that hurt by Magic, but such
also as seek by it to cure their own defaults, or the infirmities in other:
And the reason is, because that they which so work, although they profit their
harmed neighbor, Yet as Saint Paul says, Non sunt facienda mala, vt vnde
eueniant bona: Evils are not to be done that good consequences may follow of
them: and whereas it is a most pernicious thing to invoke the Devil, or to
make any express, or private contract with him: so likewise the remedies
induced thereby are most wicked and pernicious: For what is evil of it self,
is not bettered by any good circumstance: Neither can any good intention
reform that which is naturally evil. So the^ although it be a thing of much
goodness to prevent our neighbors incommodities, yet must it be held unlawful
to extinguish their harms by practice of devilish sorceries. Yet least you hold
me precise, I must moderat this conclusion: for my opinion in this is not so
peremptory, but that I admit any lawful defraudatio^ of Magic, as breaking an
instrument, burning an exorcisme, and pulling out a needle out of a picture of
wax, all which actions (wanting the due circumstances of ceremonies, and
devilish observations:) are rather passible in all men then reproouable in any.
Touching the second, the difficulty is of no small moment, yet as ambiguous,
is shortly decided: Look as (says Augustine) it is lawful for me to use the
oath of an infidel (although I know he swears by those false Gods, whom he
worshippeth) for mine own profit; or as (says the schoolmen) I may use the
Sacrament from a sinful ministers hand: so may I take profit of another man's
perverseness to mine own commodity: you are silent hearing this, holding it
vere dixit, because ipse dixit: but least I should deceive those* whom I wish
should conceit, I will thus explain this difficulty in a certain conclusion.
How (may you say)? What will you induce? Nothing but truth; and because truth,
certain; and being certain, irreproouable: In a word therefore, all works and
co^uersing with witches is wicked, their counsels reprobate, and their works
damned: and the reason is, that since the inchanter (seeking to make frustrate
another man's increase by Diabolical means) does himself grievously sin. It
is impossible likewise, but that he who demands the same question, should in
like sort be faulty. For he that requires a man to do that which without sin
he cannot do, is grievously guilty. For by that demand, he consents to
another man's iniquity, and besides his own sin induces him to offense, and
even as like pain, so like guiltiness binds both the agent, and the
consenter: so Paul testified. Romans 10. where he says: They are worthy of
death, not only who do such things, but they also, who consent to the deed, or
the doer: the demander likewise was the approximate and next cause of sin,
for although the inchanter were ready and prepared to the sin, yet had he not
wrought the peculiar enchantments, had it not been demanded at his hands.
Touching the example also of the infidel, and the curate, they are altogether
unfit and impertinent to the cause we handle: for what so is demanded in these
foresaid examples, are not evil in themselves, whereas those that are to do
them, if they list may rightfully finish them; and if they misdoe them, it is
not by reason of the error in the thing it self, but the default of the agent,
(who having power to finish the affair in good sort, would notwithstanding
misdoe the same:) For he that requires an oath from an infidel, will not that he
swear by false Gods, for then he should sin: but he only requires him to
swear, and if the choice were in him, he rather would have him swear by the
true God, then draw the false to testimony: In like sort also may it be
answered of the curat, for without sin may he minister, if he repent himself
before the administration. Touching your third question, I hold it wholly
unlawful for this cause and reason, induced by Augustine upon Genesis: because
the Devil (as it oftentimes falls out in such like superstitious rites and
ceremonies,) insinuates himself into men's actions contrary to their
knowledge, and oftentimes against their will: for men (and fond women
especially) use these rites, words, and remedies, in cure of infirmities, and
doubtless the Devils are assistant in their working, to the end they may
deceive, and persuade them to trust in vain and superstitious things* and this
is that faedus tacitum, or secret league, which is said to be had with Devils.
Thus briefly have I resolved thee, Asterius, setting little by my labor, so I
may profit thee greatly: Thou see now the vanity, scope, and issue, of this
body of curiosity, here is nothing in it but deceit; nothing, but blasphemy;
no means, but wicked: fly it therefore, and be rather glad that thou know
how bad it is, then sorry, to have forsaken that which is prejudicial to thy
soul. Thou mouest me Anthony (quoth Asterius) for whom authority and reason
cannot move, his sickness is desperate and judgment perverted, and I begin to
loath Magic, only the delights of Astrology and secrets of Astronomy; (if
they in thy judgments be permissible) are the marks I shoot at, and the
studies I would be exercised in. Astronomy and Astrology quoth Metrodorus? Why
these are but customs of antiquity, and apparances of Idolatry, fruits of
presumption, instructions of vaineglorie, supererogating deceits, and the
bugbeares of the simple: For the professors hereof are waxt so peremptory, as
they ascribe more to the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, and plannets, and their
own astronomicall calculations, then either to the blessed angels, or to Gods
majesty. That is true said Frumentarius, for they feign to pull God from his
kingdom, defraud him of his Majesty, and make him more bound to the stars,
then ever were creatures to man. For they will be Gods privy counsailers,
dispose of his doomes, determine his works, and by their corrupt wits (and
course of the planets) presume more then man should practice. They say that all
sickness or health, riches, or poverty, good, or bad, wisdom or folly,
wholly depend on celestial influences. They ascribe fair weather, or soul, to
the reuolutions of the heavens, and presume so much on their foreknowledge,
that no dissolution of Commonweal, no mortality of sickness, no tyranny of
war, can fall out, but by their wits, and the celestial bodies. For as they
say, the bodies above, rule all things hear beneath: Thus make they by their
own imaginations, God more thrall and subject then any Prince in his
sovereignty: For a king in his authority has power of a page to make a
Prince, of a poor man a Lord, without leave of the plannets: Again, if a man
trespass against him, and be convict of treason, he has power to attach him,
authority to judge him, and means to execute him, he can deprive his heirs of
their heritage, and from their prosperities condemn them to poverty. This
power and freedom has a King, wheresoever the planets be, or in what sign
aspect or constellation, without either leave of the planets, or license of
Astronomers: much more then the King of heaven (that made the Sun, the Moon,
and all things of naught, rules and guides them by his will, and rewards and
punishes every creature after his deserving) may peremptorily do what he
list, without either assistance of planet, or council of Astronomy. That is
true said Anthony, and I delight to hear it: your reasons Frumentarius, show
your reading; Metrodorus allegations, his judgment, now therefore that
Asterius may make one with us in this resolution, I will thus briefly
prosecute this subject. We find in Genesis, 10. At the beginning of the world,
when God made all things of naught, the fourth day he made the Sun, the Moon
and stars, and set them in the firmament to give light to creatures here
beneath: Ordaining the Sun principally to illumine the day, the moon and stars
the night, ordering them to distinguish the one from the other, and to be as
tokens oftimes, days, and years: He likewise placed them as marks and tokens,
how to divide years from months, months from days, and days from hours;
aduising man when to sleep, and when to wake, when to rest, and when to
travel, when to plant, and when to sow, where to ear, and when to reap, and
therefore (saw Solomon) that all things have their times, and all things pass
away under heaven, by the pace, and space of time: and so God made the
firmament above (with those bright bodies that are therein) to serve mankind
and all creatures, in their kind; and of light and time; of light, as a
lantern which may not be quenched; of time, as a clock that may never fail:
he made them likewise for man, and not man to serve them: he gave them also not
to govern man, but he gave man and woman wit, and discretion to govern
themselves, by that light and knowledge of time, which he has of the bodies
above, that by their light they may see to work, and by their stirring and
their course, they may know what time it is wherein they ought to labor: and
therefore says the law, 2. q. v. Non licet in gloss. That the bodies above are
tokens, and not causes of things here beneath: and as a lamp or clock are
necessary for scholars, by night to rule, raise, and guide them in their
studies: so do the bodies above, serve men on earth, that they may be
enlightened by them, and by their moving know their times to serve God according
to their degrees and his dignities: and as the lamp or clock in the college,
rules not the scholar, but the scholars rule and order themselves by the
clock and candle, the one aduising them when to rise the other freely lighting
them to read: even so man and woman, beast, and bied, and al living creatures,
rule them by the bodies above, and yet the celestial and superior bodies rule
them not: they should not therefore be called governors of this world, because
they govern not the world, but serve only as instruments of Gods power and
governance: For it fares by God and the celestial bodies above, as it does by
the smith and his grindstone, the carpenter and his ax, the clockmaker and his
clock. Good Anthony quoth Asterius, explain me these comparisons. Thou see
apparantlie (quoth Anthony) that when the smith grindeth a knife or a sword on
his grindstone, the stone keeps and continues in one course, and whirling
circularlie about, does so grind any thing, as the smith that sits above,
orders and disposes it; if he will grind sharp, it shall be sharp; if
blunt, it grindeth blunt; if square, it grindeth square; so as the manner
depends not on the stone in turning, but on his hand in governing. If he take
away the sword or ax, the stone grindeth not, although it turn, and if the
smith apply not some instrument, it works nothing: Why even so fares it
with God, and the bodies above. For the planets are celestial spears, observe
one circuler course, not in their own direction, but as from the beginning God
ordered them: and as God will, so they work: If he will they grind sharp, and
cause plagues, sickness, tempests, wars, and such like, they do so: and if his
pleasure be, that they produce plenty, work increase, stir calmes, and yield
peace, they effect it: So God may do with the planets what he will, and without
the planets what he list, yet are they so tied to him, that they only work by
his ordinance. Since God then (says Asterius) does with the celestial bodies
what he will, and disposes them when he will; and since he is free in his
doing, and unconstrained by the planets, how should man know his secret doomes,
by celestial influence? or determine of his works by yt ordinarierourse of the
planets? Asterius (quoth Anthony) since thou can not know by the axe when
the carpenter will work, nor judge by the clock, when the clarke will set it,
nor guess by the grindstone when or how the smith will grind: so neither by
celestial bodies or influence of planets, can thou censure the proceedings
of God, or judge what he will ordain of man, or how dispose of kingdoms, or
when dispeople countries: For the planets are Gods instruments, and to them is
prefixed one certain and determinate motion, from which they may not vary,
and which they cannot change: For free election have they none, in their
doings, but God is the sovereign judge most rightful, and most merciful;
most free, and most able, to punish, to spare, to correct, and forbear: For
his might exceeds man's reach, and nothing may withstand him, and for that
cause his works and wisdom is not limited by the planets, but as men change
their living, so God disposes his loving, as they fly from their follies, so
pours he down his graces: For example, we have Niniuie, which for sin was
threatened with destruction within forty days: and for repentance, dismissed
from the hand of displeasure: yet in this breach of determination, the planets
altered not their course, neither was there any prescience of Gods purpose by
influence of celestial bodies. We read also in the fourth of the Kings: That
God sent Esaias the Prophet to Ezechias the King, because he had sinned,
commanding him to make his testament, because he should die; We find also
written, that he trembled at his summons, repented him sore, wept bitterly,
and asked mercy: and consequently it appears (by the Prophet Esaias, Gods
messenger) to the king, that he had received his repentance, and heard his
prayers, and that he should not die, but live fifteen years further: Now in
this exchange of Gods wrath to mercy, what can Astrology say, either of Gods
purpose changed, or the planets courses altered? But that it is apparent (quoth
Asterius) that suddenly the Sun hereon changed his course, turned again to the
East, and renewed the day again. Oh sir (quoth Anthony) the turning again of
the Sun was not the cause of the mercy of God, neither a testimony of his
judgment changed, for he altered his doom before the Sun turned again: So
that the turning of the Sun was naught else but a token of mercy to the king.
For right as the Sun changed his course upon the repentance of Ezechias, so God
alters his sentence so soon as man repents him of his sin, and therefore
the law says, (...) deus mutare sententiam, si tu noueris emendare delictum
God alters the peril as soon as he knows that thou art repentant for thy
trespass. It was also a token to the king, that Gods behest should be
fulfilled: Now sir, all the Astronomers that ever were, could not foretell that
wonderful return of the sun: because it exceeds the course of nature, and
the law of kind, and therefore that token proves sufficiently that God is not
ruled by the course of the planets, but that the planets are ruled by him:
Neither that his judgments are tied to them, but their motion directed and
ordered by him. S. Paul considering this, cries out, Quis congnouit sensu^
domini, aut quis consiliarius eius fuit? Who (says he) knows the judgment
of God, or who was his counselor? Forsooth not vain Astronomers, fantastic
Astrologers, cursed inchanters, and such like: For they are lighter (as the
French man says,) by ten degrees and grains of wit, then Triboulet the king
fool, and thrust furthest from Gods counsel, as men whom he most hates:
and therefore Paul says, The judgments of God are incomprehensible, and no
man may know them, Neither may any man tract his ways, or try his-secrets.
For they be so meddled with mercy, and mixed with righteousness, that they
pass man's wit, and all humane capacity: Vniuersa vire domini, veritas and
vita, Iudicia domini abissus multa: The Judgments of God be of a great depth,
and the ways of our Lord are mercy and truth, yea so deep are they, as no
man's wit may sound them: so dark, as weak consideration cannot attain them:
and therefore such Astronomers and Astrologers, that so much intermeddle with
Gods works, and so deeply insinuate themselves into his secrets, are fond in
their divination, devilish in their intention, and condemned in their
enterprise. You are too strict (quoth Asterius, old Hermit) in reproouing
Astronomy, and enforce more against Astrology the^ you have reason, for they
are not so peremptory as you judge, but conclude nothing for certain and
determinate; only this they say, That they can measure inclinations of men,
and dispositions of creatures, by the motion of the heavens, yet so as by
virtue they conclude that both man and woman may over come the planets,
alleging in this the authority of Ptolemey, their arch master, who with the
Poet says, Sapiens domina bitur astris: They concord likewise that by
Astronomy they may know when men or women are inclined to war or peace, and
when by common course of kind, tempest should arise, famine increase, wars
take head, yet so restrain they themselves, yt they confess that both prayer may
prevent such evil mishaps, and by course likewise it happens, yt though the
constellations take no effect in one country, yet in another they may be
forcible. Well said Anthony. since they can tell me nothing that shall happen,
but ambiguouslie and doubtfully, since their demonstrations are fallible, and
their positions uncertain, It is inconvenient either to trust them, or to put
affiance in their follies, for so may every fool tell what he will, and excuse
his error: Their manner of speech then is but a coppie and coulor of subtlety
and untruth: a net to catch men's souls, a sinful excusation of sin, and a
chain to draw men from God, and to tie them to fantasies: wise they would be
thought, and are proved ignorant; secret and skillful, but they are known
deceivers; and feign would they be thought of Gods counsel, but neither wot
they how, neither can they, because they are so false: For the better proof
whereof you shall understand, that there is but one sun, one moon, and other
five stars, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Uenus, and Mercury, which with other stars
whirle about the earth with the firmament every day natural, passing over all
climats, and countries, water and air, in four and twenty hours, which is
called a day natural from midday to midday: and make no more abode over one
then over another, how should they then more incline in one land then in
another? Dispose one person more to vice or virtue, then another? or threaten
one country more with war or peace then another? Because (quoth Metrodorus,
to help Asterius, some what amassed) some constellation, or some conjunction,
some aspect, or some influence in their swift passage and motion, falls upon
one land more then another, and as men are born under diverse constellations,
conjunctions, aspects, and signs, so are they inclined in diuors manners,
having their affections more appropriate to vice, or virtue, war or peace. That
is false (quoth Anthony) and thus I prove it: when the kings son is born at
one instant with the bondmans soune, the time is one, the constellations, the
sun, the aspects, sighs, and planets alike: yet have they not one
inclination and disposition, for the kings son is disposed by inheritance to
be a king after his father, and the bondmands son is disposed by his birth,
to be a bondsman all his life time: as his father was a hundredth years before
his creation; no planet then could avoid this bondage, or deprive the kings
son of his right and inheritance: In the same time, with the same aspects,
under the same planets, when one child is brought forth, many other are borne;
yet have they not all one inclination, neither are they subject to one
dispositions For some of them are inclined to goodness, and some to
wickedness: some to sickness, and some to health: some to be wrathful, some
to be merciful: some to be wise, some to be fools: some foul, some fair,
some rich, some poor, some long living, some soon dying: Esau and Jacob had
both one mother and one father (Isaac and Rebecca) and both were begotten at
once, and yet were they diffident in manners, for Jacob was a good man, and
Esau a bad: Jacob beloved of God, Esau hated for his wickedness: Jacob was
smooth of body, Esaias full of hair: Jacob was a true simple man, Esau a proud,
and malicious son: so then it appears that such diverse inclinations of men
and women, depend neither on the planets, or the time of their births. What
then are the causes of the diversities said Frumentarius? Forsooth (quoth
Anthony) Adams original sin, wherein we are conceived, and being so
conceived, are to sin inclined, and therefore God says, that man's heart and
thought is prone to evil, even from his youth, Sensus and cogitatio cordis
generis humani in malum prona sunt ab adolescentia sua: no man therefore may
say of himself, my heart is clean, as who should say I am pure and clean
without sin. Some likewise are disposed to sickness, some more, and some
less, and that for diverse causes: Sometimes for wicked sufferance, because
children are not chastised in their youth: For as Solomon says, the child that
is suffered to have his will, shameth his mother and his kinsfolk: Some for
wicked company they be in, and wicked example of their elders, and
misinformation: For as Solomon says, A man in his old age, hardly forsakes
the depraved customs of his youth. And yet it is a proverb (quoth. Metrodorus)
Young saint, old devil. It is a sinful proverb (said Anthony) to draw men
from science to sin, from virtue to vice, and from God, to the Devil: for
Scripture says, Bonum est homini cum portauerit iugum suum ab adolescentia
sua, Happy is the man says he, that has borne the yoke of our Lord from his
youth. And as the Poet says, Quod noua testa capit, inueterata sapit.


Such as the vessel takes when it is new, such it sauoureth when it is old:
and therefore Saint John Baptist, Tobie, Jeremy, Sampson, and Samuel, (with
many others) are praised in sacred Scripture for their holiness in youth, For
commonly they that are good in their young years, in their reretired age make
a happy end: according to the Proverb, Qualis vita finis ita: And although
for a time they be subject to sin, and vanity, God suffers them to fall
therein, least they should be proud of their own goodness, and take disdain at
others sinful wretchedness: Some also is more inclined to sin then another,
because he was gotten and conceived in sin more then another, although they
were both borne in wedlock: For husband and wife may sin greeuouslie
together in misuse of their bodies, or in distemperance, if they either exceed
measure, or manner, or default in time, as in sickness, or otherwise: The
sin notwithstanding is in the asker, net in the giver: They may like wise
sin by wicked intention, or fulfilling the iusts of the flesh, not to the
intent to the wicked fornication, nor to yield the debt of their bodies, nor to
bring forth children to the worship of God, but only to their own lust: men
also are inclined to sin by their excess meats and drinks, and by the
misgouernance of their five senses: and for these causes one is inclined to
sickness more then another: For sin oftentimes is a cause of bodily
sickness, and by misdiet of the mother when she is with child, or by
indisposition of the father or mother, or both, when the child is gotten: and
by miskeeping of the child in youth, many sicknesses are fallen into: for
children in youth, are apt to have all things, and by that means do oftentimes
receive that inwardly, which alters their complexions and peruerteth their
natures. God likewise smites them sometime with sicknesses, and mischief, for
that their fathers and mothers sin in too unseemly cockering, and affection:
Knowing their parents corrupt desires to be so great, that to instruct their
sons they will hazard their souls. Sometime also he smites with sickness,
to show his might, and power, as he did in him that was borne blind, that the
power of God might be shown in him in restoring his sight: many other causes
likewise there be which pass man's wit, and are not subject to our reasons. For
we may not always know Gods will, neither are his secrets to be censured by
our senses; yet are not these assigned reasons always general: For sometimes
a good man has a wicked son, and a wicked man a worthy heir, for should
children always follow their fathers and mothers in goodness or wickedness,
then should all the right of their reformation and virtue, be ascribed to the
parents, and not to God, and the one should have cause to be proud, the other
yield matter to be forgotten: and therefore God so medleth one with another,
and moderateth his judgments by his wisdom, that the good children should not
presume on themselves, nor be proud, neither the ill should be ever sorrowful
and desperate, but should only trust in God, that of the wicked, makes good,
and of the reprobate righteous. It is said quoth Frumentarius, that as children
be borne under diverse signs, so are they likewise inclined to diverse trades,
and estates, so that under some sign, one should be a fisher, and under some
other a goldsmith, and under some other a scholar: It is said, is well said
(quoth Anthony) but it is true, is better: Many countries know us coiners, and
many though they know them, yet have no use of them: in a great realm of six
hundredth miles in length, and two hundredth in breadth, there are no coiners, but
in a place assigned them by the king, not by signs or celestial bodies, but
by his seal and patent; and there are they planted to print money, not by
Jupiter, Mars, or Mercury, but by the ordinance of his majesty: and if any man
coin, but those the King has admitted, he shall be punished like a traitor,
neither can the signs or planets save his life. They likewise that are borne
near the sea, or nigh some great water, do themselves follow fishing, and
instruct their children in that faculty, not by reason of the signs where
under they are borne, but for their better opportunity and increase of living.
They that are borne from the sea, some follow tillage, some clothing, the one
by reason of vpland, the other through abundance of wool; some be shepherds,
some southsaiers, and so of other crafts and trades, as the country requires,
not according to the disposition of the signs and planetarie circles, but
according to their natures, countries, and manners. A man likewise that has
many children, binds them prentice, not as the constellations direct him, but
as his ability serves him: So then you may well perceive, that such
diversity in livings, and change in trades and occupations, depends on the
childrens friends that ordain so for them, and not on signs and planets which
are neither propitions to the one, nor partial to the other. If then the
planets have no power in these things, What say you to distenie and her power
(quoth Metrodorus) for Seneca says, Regitur fatis mortale genus: and Lucan,
Regit omnia fatum: it seems then that all things befortune man and woman by
desteny. Fond men speak fondly, and therefore trust them not (said Anthony)
for as Gregory writes, Absit a cordibus fidelium vt aliquid esse fatam
dicatur: God forbid (says he) that any Christian man should believe that there
were any fate, or destenie. For God that made and fashioned man if naught,
rules, governs, and orders his life according to his deserts; and his
righteousness and mercy: and to be short, man was not made for the stars, but
the stars for him. Yet is the Gospel against you (said Asterius) for we find
that as soon as Christ was borne of his blessed mother, his star appeared in
the East, giving hereby an assured token and proof, that each man is borne
under a certain star, and constellation, which is called his destiny: for all
his after living is governed thereby, as both Astronomers and Astrologers
confess unfeignedly. It seems well, that to maintain folly (O Asterius)
foolish men deceive by folly: using untruths to persuade, which neither can
abide the taste of truth, or their trial: For the star that appeared at Christ's
birth had no mastery over him, but the blessed child was Master and Lord of
the star: The star governed not the child, but the child governed the star: The
star did worship and service to Christ, and therefore was it called the child's
star, because the child was Lord of that star as he was of all others: For he
was and is Lord of son, Moon and stars, and all things whatsoever: They may
not therefore confirm their follies and false judgments, with an Astronomicall
judicial of the star; for as Augustine and other doctors confirm, it was no
star or planet of the firmament, but a preordinate light sent by God, al which
may be proved both by art, and unfeigned authority. For as artsmen confess,
Minima stella fixa, mayor est tota terra, The least star in the firmament is
bigger then the whole earth: every planet like wise is greater then the earth,
except the Moon and Mercury, (which in that they be somewhat lesser then the
earth, do sometime loose that light they receive from the sun, by the
interposition and shadow of the same) as when the earth falls betwixt the
sun and them: and if that be true then, if that star had been so great as
another star, it should have overwhelmed all the earth: for it nearly
approached the earth in conducting the kings on their way: The stars also of the
firmament follow the course of the firmament, and in every day natural arise
in the East, and set again in the West: but that star did far otherwise, for
first it shined both night and day without observation of the course of the
firmament, and next only directed the right way whereby the Magi were to travel
to Bethleem, conducting them to the son of justice which rose out of the
clear sky, the Maiden Marie. Thee stars likewise in the firmament shine by
night, but that star appeared in the Horizon both day and night. The stars like
wise of the firmament shine both to rich and poor, to young and old, to
skillful, and unskillful, but that star appeared only to the Kings and their
attendants. The stars in the firmament are perpetual and everlasting, since as
the Philosopher thinks, Sola sublunaria sunt caduca, but that star had but
nine months continuance at the most, and if some clarks err not, continued but
forty days. The^ what manner of star was it (quoth Metrodorus) resolve us in
this difficulty? Some schoolmen say it was but the likeness of a star (said
Anthony) for the Kings had no knowledge of angels, but only intended the stars:
Some say it was the same child that lay in the oxes stall, which appeared to
the Kings, and led them to Bethleem in likeness of a star, and therefore the
hymn says, Iacet in praesepio, and fulgebat in caelo, But the common sentence
of the learned is, that it was a star newly ordained by God, to show the
birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, and as soon as it had executed the office that
it was ordained for, it turned again to that matter which it came from. How
could they know by the star that such a child was borne said Asterius? For
neither could the star speak to the^, neither instruct them in such matters.
Uery true (quoth Anthony) and therefore Augustine says openly in a Sermon,
that the star wrought naught else by his appearance but astonishment, study, and
amase in them, to discern what it might intend; and when they were at their
wits end, and knew their cunning served them not, then God showed unto them by
inspiration inwardly, or by an angel openly what it betokened, and bad them
follow that star. And so says Chrysostom on Matthew. They knew also by Balaams
prophecy that such a child should be borne, but they knew it not by the secret
of Astronomy: Neither might they know the time of his birth, nor the place, as
the Gospel testifies. Why then says Augustine and other fathers, that the
science of judicial Astronomy and knowledge of childrens birth was lawful
until the coming of Christ? Since by their science they could not comprehend
his birth. But as they say before it was lawful, but not after his birth:
Saint Augustine (quoth Anthony) says not that the study was lawful or
granted to be done, neither that it was permissible to trust therein, (for it
was always false and reproved both by God and by Philosophers, by authorities
and by reasons:) but he says that the science and cunning was granted by God,
and held lawful, not the practicke of the science. Man may like wise reprove
the knowledge, and learners thereof, and show by their own principles and
grounds, that it is a fained and uncertain study: finally that the science is
properly no science, but an open folly as it well appears in Christ's birth:
and because in his birth it was so apparently disproued, therefore after his
birth it is neither lawful to know it, reasonable to use it, but only
wisdom to reprove the folly of them that practice it. Astrology likewise as
the schoolmen say, was both unlawful before Christ's birth and after, but the
knowledge was suffered both before and after, to reprove man in his folly, and
the folly of menthat practice it. Where find you that God defended and forbad
judicial Astronomy before, and after Christ's birth, quoth Metrodorus? In the
first precept of the first table (said Anthony) where he forbids that men
should make them any likeness of that which is in heaven; but Astronomers (as
much as in them lies) make themselves like to God in heaven, by reason they
ascribe to themselves that which belongs to God: and therefore God reproves
them and says unto them, Nuntiate quae ventura sunt in futurum and sciemur
quod dij estis vos, Esaias: 18. Tell us the things that be to come after this,
and then shall we know that you be Gods: and therefore says the law 26. q. 4.
Igitur, that they call themselves divines; as if they knew Gods counsels, and
by their deceits and falsehoods, tell the people things that are to come, as if
they were full of godhead, and Gods fellows: and in this sort they and such
other offend most grievously against the first commandment, for they make
themselves like unto God in heaven, and that worship which only belongs to
God, they take to themselves: and for such presumption and pride, angels kind
was destroyed, and mankind also: For as we read Esai 11, Lucifer said in his
heart that he would ascend the highest heaven, and plant his seat above the
stars, and sit in the mount of the testaments, and that he would mount up above
the heart of the skies, exceed all angels, and be like him that is highest: But
suddenly he fell into hell, and so shall all false Astronomers and Astrologers
do, except they amend them, for they fix their wits, firm their studies, and
plant their faith so much on the stars, that they pass the stars, and be like
to God in their considerations, who is most highest: They will likewise sit in
the mount of the testament, for they will be against Gods laws, and prefer
their judgments before Gods prohibitions: and therefore if their science were
true, the testament of Gods law should be fruitless: besides, if their study
stand with religion, Gods law is void, Ecclesiastical vain, laws of countries,
judgment, and reason should wholly be vnnessarie: For no man is worthy to be
punished for his sin, nor can be deservedly rewarded for his good deeds, if
he be fatally tied unto them: But he that does well, and may do amiss, is
therefore worthy great reward: and for that he does evil, when he might do
well, and might leave his misdeeds, and will not, he is worthy of punishment:
but if he were moved by the bodies above, either to virtue or vices he were
worthy neither of pleasure nor plague: and therefore this pride and
presumption lost Adam, Eve, and all mankind: for when the feind told them they
should be as Gods, knowing good and evil, they consented to him, and eat of
the apple, contrary to Gods command; for they would be as Gods, and like to
Gods in knowing things that were to come: as we find that when God led the
children of Israel into the land of promise, he forbad them judicial
Astronomse and all other manner of witchcrafts, commanding them that they should
not ask counsel of any such diuinors or witches, For I shall destroy (says
he) the nations before you, because they have used such abominations, and if
you use them also, I shall also destroy you: we find likewise that God reproved
the people of Babylon for their witchcrafts, and the children for their
Astronomy they trusted in, for of al nations they were most addicted thereto in
those days, and to them he spoke in this wise, Widowhood and barrennes shall
come upon you in one day by reason of the multitude of thy witches, and the
hardiness of thy charms; and because thou have trusted in such malice, thy
cunning and science has deceived thee: disease and woe shall fall on thee, and
thou shall not know from whence it comes, Sudden mischief shall fall on
thee, which thou may not escape; stand (says he) with thy charms and with
the multitude of thy witches, in which thou have travailed from thy young age,
look now if they have power to strengthen thee against thine enemy, Thou have
failed, and thou shall fall in the multitude of thy counsel that thou have
taken from such men: let now thy diuinors (says he) of heaven stand and
succor if they can, they that stare so against the stars, and look after the
planets, and call and cast years, months, and days, to tell things that are
to come, they shall not help thee: For as Paul says, their counsel is
nothing. This science of Astronomy likewise is reproved by Solomon, where he
reprehendeth those that say that the sun, the Moon and stars were Gods and
governors of the world, whereas governance does only and truly belong to witty
and reasonable things, as to God who is sovereign wisdom; To angels as the
wisest of his creation; to men as illuminated by his spirits: But unreasonable
bodies above are only instruments of Gods governance, and therefore cannot but
indirectly be called guides and disposers: Such judicial Astronomy also is
comdemned by the law. 26. q. 6. Igitur, and in many other places of scripture
also: S. Paul likewise misliketh such practicke in Aronomy, where he says,
You keep holy days, and years, as heathen people do, I am therefore afraid
(quoth he) that I have travailed about you in vain to convert you all: and on
the same place the gloss reprehendeth the craft of Astronomy very earnestly:
Such sciences likewise are reproved in Paul's Epistle to the Corin. 10. I shall
(says God) destroy the wise man, and the slight of the subtle, and of them
that trust so much in their cunning: Where also Saint Paul says, Where is now
the wise man that sets so much by his own wit? Where is now the man of law,
with all his slights? Where is now the searcher of nature, and the course of
kind? God (says he) has turned the wisdom of the world into folly. I count
(said Metrodorus) that this deuining of things to come which only depend on
the will of God and man's industries, are mere and great follies: For no
Astronomer by his cunning can tell me my thoughts, nor resolve me in succeeding
purposes, nor how I shall lead my life: they know not my counsels, although
they see and speak with me, how should they then know Gods will, since they
neither see him, nor speak with him? Themselves cannot foretell or beware of
their own mischiefs, and how may he rightly know a star so far often, that
cannot warely escape a pit hard at hand: so that as far as I see, the more they
work by their craft, the worser they speed. Now trust me (said Anthony) I like
thy present reasons, and to show their further arrogance, I will thus prosecute
my purpose, whereby you shall espy their wondrous folly, and find that the more
they trust in their secrets, the less they trust in God: There will no wiseman
as you know write his hid secrets and yearly business in the roof of his hal,
nor about the walls thereof, least al men might read them and know them, no more
will God write what he thinks to do in the firmament, that therein all
fools might discern his secrets, and forepointments. For Christ hid many
things from his apostles, and said to them, Non est vestra nosce tempora vel
momenta, quae pater posui in sua potestate: It longs not to you to know the
times and moments which the father of heaven has received into his power; and
by the Prophet Esaias he said, Secreta meu^ mihi, secretum meum mihi: I keep my
secrets to my self; and since he keeps such counsails from his friends, much
more obscureth he his secrets from his enemies. They say that by the secrets of
Astronomy, they may lawfully tell and deuiue of fair, and dry wether, of
rain and of tempests, for they fall by common course of nature (quoth
Asterius) and therefore they may be foreknowne and foretold. Asterius (answered
Anthony) as I have said before, the course and kind of planets depends on
Gods will only, and are merely at his own disposition, as the instrument
stands on the workemans hand, and in his will to do there with what he will.
So that Astronomers by their cunning cannot certainly foretell either drought,
rain, or succeeding tempest, neither censure the same by stars, (as the
material causes of the same) but by the celestial bodies as by tokens they
may know the success of frost, hail, snow, wet, drought, and such other
things, and that knowledge has the shepherd in the field, the shipman on the
sea, the bird in the air, the fish in the water, and the beasts in the wood,
far better then all the Astronomers in the world. How then may bodies above be
tokens of things, and not causes said Asterius? The falling of soot quoth
Anthony, in the chimney, is a token of succeeding rain, but not the cause of
rain, but the rain rather is cause of the soot falling: For when the air
wareth moist, then does the soot through the moisture thereof, wax heavy, and
so falls down, and in so falling is a token of the moisture of the air: So
swetting of water out of the stone, is a token of rain, yet is it no cause
thereof, but the rain and moisture of the air is cause of the swetting of the
same: The melting also of salt, when it turns to water, is a token of rain,
but not the cause: Smoke in the house when it passes not out readily, is a
token of rain, and the blew glowing of fire a token of frost, but none of both
causes of either: The Halo likewise about the Moon a token of wind, but no
cause; al such tokens showing the disposition of the air, but not the cause:
and in like manner superior constellations by their light and manner of
shining, are tokens of wet, and drought, and such like: And as the light of the
Sun shows the disposition of glass, when it shines upon it, whether it be
white, or black, red or green, and yet is not the cense of the same colors:
and the Moon in one lunacion, and in the same time shows in one country
great tokens of rain, and 20 miles off, shows great tokens of drought, and
so it falls out: yet it is the same Moon, and the same lunacion: and
therefore the same cause in diversity is not in the Moon but in the air. In
one country shows wind and tempests, in another far otherwise, some is made
whote by the reuerberation of the sun, in another country not so, but far
different: In one day also it gloweth, in another it freezeth: The sun
shows his light one time of the day, another time it does not: which
diversities stand not on the sun, but on the air, and other causes. For the
sun of it self as Philosophers say, is always of one certainty, and shines
ever alike. It is not whoter one time, then it is at another time: But such
diversity falls by the diversity of the air, and other means and causes
surpassing man's capacity. Sometimes such adventures of hunger, pestilence,
tempests, drought, and inundacions fall out by the ordinance of God for man's
sin, and to express his might and power: Sometime without mean only at his
will: Sometime by the working of good or evil angels at Gods bidding: Sometime
by the working of the supernatural bodies at his bidding: For as I first said,
he may do with the planets what he will, and he may do without them what he
list: And therefore by the course of the planets we may know such adventures
and casualties, not as being causes thereof, but only as being tokens; for God
made them for tokens to man and beast, bird, and fish, and all other creatures
whatsoever: and therefore we ought to observe them as tokens, not as causes:
and divine by them as means, not material agents: for we neither know when
they be causes of such changes, or when they be not. What say you to this
Anthony quoth Asterius? The Moon according to Philosophy, is the causes both
of the ebbings and floatings of the sea, and as Aristotle writes, it follows
the course of the Moon: It may be (said Anthony) that the sea keeps his
time of ebbing and floating by the course and time of the Moon, in one country
sooner, in another later: yet fares not every sea in the same sort, but one
part of the West sea about Britain and Ireland, and in some other neering
lands, else where, where approximation and neerenesse causes currents: But in
other far countries, and in the Greek sea, neither such ebs or floats, are ever
found, and so it seems there be other causes of the floating and ebbing of
the seas, and not the Moon alone: But true it is, that man, beast, bird, and
fish, ye sea, the air, the trees, and flowers, and all other creatures observe
those orders in time, kind, and working, which God has appointed the^: which
time they know by the Sun, Moon, and stars: For as Solomon says, each thing
has his time ordained by God by law of nature, which time they know, and keep
by the course of the bodies celestial, which are to them as tokens what they
should do, and rules of kind that they be ordained to: and therefore God says
by the Prophet Jeremy, The puttocke in the air knows his Time, the Turtle
and the Swallow keep their time, but my people knows not the time of our
Lord God: For in these days men regard not Gods judgments, but tie themselves
to Astronomers, and planetarie aspects, yet notwithstanding all the rules of
Astrology, each kind is ordained by Gods ordinance, what Time each thing shall
be done, or follow his kind: which time they both feel and know by the bodies
celestial. For as the Philosopher says, The bodies above measure all things
here beneath by prescript of time. And therefore says David that at night when
the Sun is down, then in the darkness begin beasts to seek their prey, to
wake and walk in deserts, and when the sun rises, they return to their
dens, and hide them, and then go men out and work till it be night, not the
Sun and Moon causes them to do so, but only the law of kind ordained by
God, teaches them so to do: and tieth them to observe their kindly times. In
the dawning and springing of the day birds begin to sing, and those flowers
sweetly spread, that in the night time were softly closed; Man, bird, and
beasts, beholding the light, reioiceth at that time, because their kindly
course of working is renewed again by the lovely presence of the shining Sun,
which warmeth them with his beams, and encourages them with his light. The
Sun like wise ruieth them not (to speak properly) but kind rules them in
time, by the course of the sun, and other superior constellations: We read in
holy Scripture, that on Gods command and word earth produced trees, brought
forth flowers, and was clothed with grass, each yielding his fruit in his
degree, and his flower in his kind: The third day before God made either sun,
moon, or stars, he gave them virtue, and nature to bring forth trees, fruit and
grass of many sundry kinds, but to the Sun he gave not it nature, neither
to the Moon, nor to the stars, but he made them to shine and to be tokens of
time, to all creatures here beneath: And God himself gave to trees, grass and
herbs diverse virtues, and wonderful natures to bud, blosiome, to bring forth
fair and green leaves of diverse fashions and qualities: so that no man by
wisdom can equal the least, or cease to admire at the smalest: Some be
ordained for Summer, some for Winter, some in one season to loose their
beauties and fair colors, some in another to recover that they lost: some to
be continually green, as the laurel: Such many diversities God has ordained
in kind in all creatures whatsoever, assigning to each their due time natural,
either to sade or flourish, to spring or wither, to prosper, or decay. In one
landfalleth hunger, in another land plenty, some countries yield wine, others
abound with wool; in one province is plenty of gold, Silver, and Minerals, in
another, barrenness void of all abundance. There is also sometime a general
plague, other sometime a sickness restrained in some climate: some die in
their youth, other some in age, some with long sickness, some by sudden death:
how should men know these changes by the influence of the planets, or assign
causes thereof (and many such other innumerable,) by the defined number of
constellations? Dispute not Asterius (quoth Frumentarius) but submit, for it
passes maus wit to decide these things, and is only known to God who made al
things. For which cause I hold it fally in men to intermeddle with such secrets
and hidden mysteries, and namely with things yet to come. Well Frumentarius,
said Asterius, let your opinion stand, yet cannot I give over questioning till
I be resolved, if in the wonders that fall against kind, the celestial bodies
be tokens or signs of any adventures to come? I will satisfy thee (said
Anthony) for such as doubt, show they would learn. That which falls out above
the course of kind, betokens that there is some what exceeding above the
course of kind, be it weal, or woe, prosperity or adversity: But commonly
such adventures happen rather against bad then good betiding: as comets, stars,
and burning castles in the air, eclipses of the Sun and Moon against kind,
armed men in the air, or rainebowes turned vpside down, mishappen monsters in
their birth, and against kind. These and such like that fall out against common
course of nature be tokens that the people, where they do appear, are
ungracious in their lives, and monsterous in their actions: foretelling that
the Lord of all nature is offended to see them so disobedient and unnatural.
It may well be as thou say (quoth Metrodorus) for many such have appeared
within few years, and never so many think I in so little while, and much
sorrow and woe has followed after them, as the countries have seen and felt
also: I pray thee therefore tell me what these obortions mean, these commets
portend, and monsters signify, which of late days have happened in this
peaceable country? They are manifest tokens of great offense against God
(quoth Anthony) they are testimonies of our countries sins, and the plagues
that are coming, except we amend us: for greater falsehood and treason, greater
perjury and mispresion, greater covetousness and injustice, greater heresy
and blasphemy, greater lust and ambition was never in country ouerlookt by
the Sun; we are not ashamed to sin, but do sin openly, and (to the great
slander of Christendom) the infidel shows Christ in his life, where we only
(and that fildome) celebrate him with our tongues: and because we neither
repent, nor amend our lives, (but as the Prophet says, tie sins together
with cartropes, and rather hunt after new, then repent the old) therefore these
tokens of misery appear successively betokening that God smites not all at
once, but warns us by leisure to repentance. Wherein if we use dalliance,
after long forbearance, God will use mere force, and the plague will be so
heavy, we shall not be able either to hear the report thereof, or endure the
mortal persecution. Thy words are both true and manifest (quoth Frumentarius)
for every estate and degree in this land is given to sin, men rather covet to
be rich, then to be righteous, to do wrong, then to do right: and to conclude,
the wounds of this world are so fatal, as they cannot be healed either by thy
counsel, or our complaints: In leaving therefore these terms of
expostulation, and commiseration, let me entreat thee to discover the opinion
of the learned touching such comets and stars appearing contrary to the course
of kind. Frumentarius (quoth Anthony) Philosophers say, that comets are hot
exhalations, carried up above the middle region of the air, and there become
new stars, denouncing future misfortunes: And of these Metiors and impressions,
there are three sorts, in three regions of the air: the one are of the matter
of fire, the other of water, and the last periticipates both of the one and the
other. The comets are of the first cannuk or magnitude, and it is said, that
every comet is an exhalation hot, and dry, terrestrial thick and weighty,
which by the virtue of the stars is attracted upward by little and little into
the most heighest region of the air, where by reason of the affinity of the
fire, and the cominance and agreement of his matter, it is gathered, and
inflamed by the motion of the celestial bodies; then increases it, becoming
round by his own proper motion, and conformable to that star, under which it
was first gathered, or rather it goes by the motion of some other celestial
body, from East to West, or remains in one place (as the fixed stars.) After
the apparitions of these fiery bodies, droughts, plagues, and other tragical
misfortunes happen. And it is therefore called a comet by reason of his hairie
figure. Of these there are two sorts, the one called Crinita, the other
Barbata: for so Aristotle terms and distinguishes them: Pliny in his
second book sets down diverse kinds and dependances of them, gathered as it
seems rather from tradition, then certain truth: they commonly appear by
night in the North part, whence it may be thought the Proverb arises, Omne
malum ab Septentrione, Of their effects I will propose some examples to thy
satisfaction; partly such as Garcaeus Peucer and Licosthenes have touched,
partly such as have escaped their diligence. In the year 681 about the 16
Sinode held at Constantinople, and during the reign of Constantine the fourth
then Emperor, There appeared a comet according to the Greeks, by the Latins
held Crinita, which appearing above the Horizo^ three months, portended great
mischiefs, both to Rome and Italy: For after it, insued a great plague, and
after that a worse famine, and besides, the heavens so conspired against man,
that many were consumed by lightning: in the year 954 like wise, (during the
empire of Otto the first) besides stones of huge bigness falling from heaven,
bitter winds, bearing down great towers, and bloody crosses, falling from
heaven, there appeared a comet of mighty magnitude, followed by a famine so
forcible, as many millions of men, women, and children, died either by the
force thereof, or the fury of injurious wars. In the year 1265 for three
months space a mighty comet appeared in the East, extending her beams to the
mid heaven Westward, which then arose when Pope Viban the fourth see sickned,
and then vanished when his life finished: during the reign of Wenceslaus the
third king of Bobeme, another comet appeared, after which followed a great
persecution of the Christians, and after that such an earthquake as overthrew
many cities and castles: in the last year of Lodowie the fourth then Emperor,
there appeared a Crinite comet for two months space, seconded by great famine:
in the year 1352 a comet appeared in the North in the month of December which
was no sooner extinct, but that great winds followed, fiery beams fell from
heaven, and Pope Innocent the 6 died. In the year 1482 two comets appeared,
the one about the beginning of January fiery in coulor, sparkling in beams,
and fearful to behold, which bending toward the West, at first took
beginning in the entrance of Libra, and after passed so far Northward, that
it passed beyond the Zodiake, and after 16 days continuance was extinguished:
and no sooner was this dissolved, but another appeared very fiery and bloody,
extending toward the East, after which such greiuous plagues, famines, and war,
persecuted the Christian clunes, as nature suffered not the like ruins in many
years: Thus then it appears that comets are tokens and warnings of ensuing
death or plagues sent by God to fore warn men that his vengeance is at hand. To
conclude, all signs in heaven are but as tokens, not causes; governed and
directed by God, not governing, and materially enforcing man: and they likewise
that either repose their trust in them, or trifle away their studies in their
natures, they that judge thereby as inforcers of casualties, and hang their
wisdom on iusensible creatures, are both condemned by God, and held foolish by
the wise. Be not therefore deceived Asterius, build not upon appearance, think
not all gold that glutereth, but fly Magic as devilish, despise Astrology
as uncertain, and travel in the study which may lighten thy mind, and not
corrupt thy understanding. First ad example to thy persuasion (said Metrodorus)
for those that are wrought by reason, are won and wounded by example: I will
satisfy thee quoth Anthony, for I defire both his, and thy safety. There
lived sometime in France a young and toward scholar called Gilbert, who borne
of obscure Parents, yet carried a high mind, fixing his study on Philosophy,
and delighting in nothing more then the secrets of nature, but wanting the
supplies of wealth (and seeing too few men live by wit) he took upon him the
Habit of a Monck in the Monastery of Floriarenee, within the diocese of
Aureliana, not for devotion or religions sake only, but rather to fly
constraint then assen contemplation: There living long time, and profiting not
a little, in steed of holy mysteries, he studied Magic, in steed of Moses,
Ptolomey; so that by this means becoming worldly, and by that means wicked,
he for sooke his cowle, left his cloister, and fled to Hispalis a city of
Spain there to profess his long affected Philosophy: No sooner was he
arirued in that city, but contrary to all expectation his fame began to
increase, his studies to be more vehement, his ambition more earnest, so that
he finally promised the Devil if he would raise him to the dignity of
Papacy, he would be his both body and soul: This condition ratified between
them, by these steps he presently ascended. First became he tutor to Otto the
emperor, and afterward to Robert of France; making by this means diverse
famous scholars, and attaining thereby many mighty friends. At last wearied
with teaching, (which is a great and busy trouble) he exchanged his Academy
into Archbishopric, his rod into a crosier, his cap into a miter, attaining
the Archbishopricks of Rhemes and Rauenna by bribes, and by Simony, and not
content with these, but aspiring prowdlie to a higher place: at last by many
insinuations with the Devil, and promises to be his body and soul after
death, he attained the Papacy, not crowned by the Emperor as a holy divine,
and Philosopher, but like a most execrable and damned Magician. Installed thus
in the sovereignty, he poisoned those whom he hated, perverted those whom he
loved, persecuted the professors of the truth: hiding so much mischief under
the shadow of holiness, as the world no sooner espied it, but they began to
detest him. And because where honor is attaind, it cannot be lost without
discontent, very curious of continuance of his life, and desirous to escape
death, by magical incantations he so wrought the devil, that at last he gave
him this answer of his fortune, Thou shall live so long (says he to Pope
Siluester, for the name of Gilbert he gave over at his coronatio^) til thou
enter Jerusalem. The vain man proud of this reply, fearing never in Rome to
meet with Jerusalem, and supposing the Prophecy extended to the city in
Paltestine, where it only had relation to a Minster in Rome, he followed
banqueting, took his delight and pleasure, leaving nothing un sought that
might further his vanity and security: at last in the fourth year of his
reign and the tenth day of the first month, whilst he sacrificed and said
mass in Rome in the Cathedral church of the holy cross in Jerusalem, on a
sudden he was warned he should die, and at last he perceived how vainly he
was deceived, where upon moved with repentance, and publicly confessing his
sins to the people, and exhorting to fly the baits of preposterous ambition,
and eschew the deceipts and magical illusions of the Dwell, he prepared
himself to the death which suddenly followed: charging his ministers amidst
the pangs thereof, that after his death they should cut his body into pieces,
and so scattered, should lay it on a chariot, not suffering him to be buried in
any place, but where they willingly rested: At last he dead, and his will
effected, both to show Gods providence, and to examplefie his mercy, upon
unfeigned repentance, he was laid in a chariot, so mangled and cut peecemeale;
and was conducted by the horses to the Cathedral church of Lateran, where
willingly staying, he was worthily burried, she wing in his life the vanities
of magic, and in his death the effectual fruits of repentance. Thus have
thou heard, O Asterius, a true and certain example, Which if thou follow, the
world will rejoice in thy conversion, and thy soul shall have comfort in my
counsel. Thou have won me holy hermit (quoth Asterius, not without sheading
of tears) and I long to be instructed in a better kind of study, my former
delights are tedious to mine ears, and my present state, dangerous by my sins.
O Asterius said Anthony, as thou have lived ill so learn to live well, and
take the benofite of Gods forbearance, least thou be overtaken with his
justice. Thou see a good matron will rather die then betray her husband, a
stout captain perish ere he leave his soldiers, so play thou by Christ, as
thy master observe him, as thy guide follow him, as thy iusticer fear him, as
thy redeemer love him: and learn to die for him who suffered death for thy
follies: duly bethink thee now on the greeuousnesse of sin, hourly fly thou
the occasions of offense, learn in the beginning to resist temptations,
mortify thy flesh, that has beguiled thy spirit, keep thy tongue from talking
of vanities, restrain thy heart from being entangled with the inordinate love
of visible delights, seek solitude, fly idleness, think God always present,
and suspect sin always egging, and come and learn what the desert is, and
love to live with Anthony. Great is my desire said Asterius, and forward my
zeal, but I have a father to love, a mother to content, their presence is mine
only comfort, their absence my misery. Ah Asterius quoth Anthome, this as
Hierome says, is the Ram and battering Cannon of all piety, that knitteth us
so much to earthly love, as we despise heavenly: Hark what Climachus says, It
is better quoth he, to grieve our parents the^ to discontent Jesus, for he
created and saved us, they only loose us by loving us; Gods love must
extinguish eternal love, and he that will be his, must be wholly his: Let not
thy parents tears draw thee from him, least thou increasest eternal tears to
thy own soul, when thy Parents inuiron thee like bees, and brey about thee
like waspes, complaining and lamenting, propose thou thy sins to thy self,
that thou may overcome grief with grief. Thou are bound to forsake thy
father for Gods sake, neither do thou hate thy father by coming to Christ,
but thou make him happy by producing thee, who art sealed to Christ: shall
the celestial trumpet of Christ draw thee to battle with the world, says
Augustine Epist. 38. ad Laet. and shall thy mother retain thee? She
counsaileth thee perhaps says Barnard, to fly solitude, and by this means is
contrarious to thy health and her own; choose therefore of both which thou will,
either to satissie ones foolish will, or to loose boths salvation. But if thou
love her truly, forsake her rather, least forsaking Christ to remain with
her, she likewise perish for thy cause: perhaps thou will say, thou are not
sure of thy vocation, because thou art called publicly: But hear what Barnard
says in 107 Epistle to Thomas, Vox haec non sonat in soro, nec auditur in
publico, secretum consilium secretum quaerit auditum: auditui tuo gaodium pro
certo dabit, and laetitiam si sobria aure perceperis: Thou may say that
solitude wants the^ delights of this life, but I tell the with the wiseman,
Proverb 15, better to be called, Ad oleum cum caritate quam ad vitulum
saginatum cum odio. Thou will say the solitary life is subject to temptations
and I tell thee that those who are tempted are beloved, and who abide the
assault, are worthy of the laurel: perhaps thou suspectest the necessaries of
life, but hear Augustine what he says, lib de Eleemos. Think thou that
earthly necessaries shall fail thee, where heavenly and divine are given thee?
Thou fear perhaps that austerity of life will hasten thy death, but I tell
thee, holy abstinence maintains life: Then Arsenius, who more abstinent? Yet
saw he a 120 years: who more studied fasting then Jerome: Yet lived he twice
fifty: It is not austeritie that hasteneth death, but superfluity that
shorteneth life. Thou fear perhaps that thou can not cast off thine evil
customs: but I assure thee that Gods graces are stronger then man's frailties:
and spiritually tied unto him, thou shall say as Augustine did of himself, how
suddenly wared it sweet to me to want the sweetness of trifles: and those
toies which I feared to loose, I forsook with rejoice. Thou fear least thou
shall not continue thy resolution, but whilst thou heedfully foreseest
uncertain evils, thou retchelesly art restrained in the bond of thy sins. If
thou give ear with Augustine thou shall hear this happy voice, Proijce te in
eu^, nolimetuere, no^ te subtrahet vt cadas, proijce te securus excipiet te,
and sanabit: Cast thy self on him, and fear not, he will not suffer thee to
fall: cast thy self securely and freely on him, he will both receive thee and
heal thee: perhaps thou desire to defer thy time of contemplation, and
would be a worldling during youth, to serve God in age: Then when the world
casts thee off, it seems thou would cast thy self on God; for shame for
shame give him the fattest sacrifice, for if thou come in youth to him, Anselme
will compare thee to an angel, Hark how Jerome cries, Epist. 103. ad Pauli.
vol. 30. ^oestina quaeso te and herenti in salo nauiculae funem magis precide
quam solue: Thou dispisest perhaps the poverty of my estate, but thou have
cause to love it, for where hunger is, all things are taken with delight; and
where humility, with thanks: Thou fear the facility of religious
discipline, but I tell thee that as the fether except steeped in water, is
easily lifted up into the air with the least puff of wind, so man's spirit
(except soiled with vices, and detained by worldly infirmities) is still
mounting up to heaven, as being a portion of the same. To conclude all doubts
therefore, and draw thee to God (Asterius) know that the true delight of the
mind is no ways but in God, and that all other are but as blemishes to the
eye, spots in purple, and knots in timber; This Aristotle perceived, who after
he had very long and learnedly disputed of felicity, at last (after he had
decided the delights thereof) concluded that the whole fullness thereof
depended on the contemplation of God: That is the true and only delight (says
Barnard, Epist. 114) which is not received by the creature, but the creator,
and which when thou inioiest, no man may take from thee; in comparison of
which, all other sollace is sadness, all sweetness grief, each blessing
bitter, all beauty filthy, finally whatsoever other thing may move delight,
troublesome. Besides there is in no created thing, any degree of goodness, any
spark of beauty, any appearance of pleasure, which is not more freely, more
effectually, and perfectly in God: first, because his nature is infinite: and if
any thing should be defective in him, he could not be infinite: Again,
whatsoever earthly things they have, they have them from God, and no man can
give that to another, which he has not himself: and therefore well said
Barnard, Thou admirest (says he) in the sun brightness, in the flowers
beauty, in bread sanor, in earth fecundity, but all these things are of God,
neither is it to be doubted, but that he has reserved far sweeter for himself
then that which he has given to his creatures: which being so, it must
necessarily follow, that he who possesses God, possesses al things with him,
and receineth the same or greater delectation then he could take from all other
wordly delights, were they united together: For as he who enioieth gold,
enioieth the price of much silver, and has more easy carriage of the one then
of the other, so he that is united with God, has all the suck and marrow of
true goodness, and with the possession thereof, an alienation from all other
earthly frailties and infirmities, which are incident to frail, fickle, and
finite nature: Speak thou thus therefore with Augustine to God, 10. Confess. b.
What love I, when I love thee? Not the beauty, form, or favor of the body,
not the ornament of time, not the brightness of light, befriendring mine eyes,
not the sweet melody of delightful songs, not the oderiferous smell of
flowers, spices, and ointments, not Manna, not honey, not soft pleasing members,
fit for fleshly embraces: I love not these, when I love my God, and yet I love
a certain light, and a certain voice, and a certain smell, and a certain
meat, and a certain embrace when I love my God: the light, the voice, the
odor, the food, the embrace of my inferior man: where that shines to my
mind, the place comprehends not; and where that sounds, which time carries
not away; and where that smells which breath disperseth not; and where yt
sauoureth, which eating diminishes not; and where that sticks which sacietie
pulls not away. This is that which I love when I love my God: Come away from
this world Asterius, for like a thief it will betray thee, like a net it will
catch thee, like a Serpent it will sting thee, like a syrren it will inchant
thee, like a Crocodile weep over thee: Briefly come and dwell with me, that
thou may dwell with God. As soon as Anthony had finished this discourse, and
his auditorie considered on his oration, both Metrodorus and Asterius, the one
forsaking his curiosity, the other renouncing both Astronomy and Magic, cast
away their vain vainness of Philosophy, and humbly submitted them to Anthony,
and ever after, from worldly minded men, became zealous and contemplative
fathers; only Frumentarius that had yet vndisclosed his cause of discontents,
after he had applauded these conuersions, at last thus expresied his purposes.
Though I have cause to rejoice O Anthony, to behold these conuerts, and a
desire in my self to be partaker of their profession, yet because a
commonweal depends on my hands, I am restrained from that I would, and wholly
tied to my country: Why have thou sought me out quoth the Hermit. To be
advised by thee said Frumentarius, in choice of my counsel, in that I am
Prince; in disposition of my wars, because I fear to be invaded; and in
execution of justice, what is to be followed. Thou shall not depart unsatisfied
quoth. Anthony, (though the world be not my science) and I will become a mortal
man, to help an honest mind: First therefore for counsel, thou ought to
require it from almighty God, next from thy self, thirdly from others: in God
thou ought to be wise and devout, in thy self provident, and in others
careful, and wary in examining counsels, discreet in avoiding severe
mistaking, learned in retaining, and constant in observing: That thou ought
to take counsel, and request it at Gods hand, James teaches thee, where he
says, If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask it of God, Jacob, 10. and
Paul in his Epistle to the Colossians says; Whatsoever you do either in word
or deed, do it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God the
father: For as James says, Every best gift, and every perfect gift is from
above, descending from the father of lights, with whom is no transmutation, nor
shadowing of alteration: in demanding counsel therefore at Gods hands, thou
must both be devout and provident; to the end thou may desire nothing at his
hands, but yt which shall stand with justice, and be correspondent to honesty:
and if so thou do, doubtless whatsoever thou will, thou shall obtain: For
Christ faith, whatsoever you shall ask of my father in my name, he shall give
it you, which thou may thus understand if thou be just, and demand justly:
otherwise, if thou desire unlawful things, the judgment shall light on thy
self, and the perverse counsel destroy thine own soul: for as Jesus the
son of Sirac says, he that works ungodly counsels, they shall return
and over whelme himself, neither shall he know from whence they happen unto
him: For if in the law of common freindship, it be held both injustice and
injury, either to request dishonest things, or accomplish them being demanded;
much more in Gods cause, who is our perfect friend, and only keeper of our
souls, ought we to be respective: and therefore as Cato says: Quod iustum
estpetito, vel quod videatur honestum,
Nam stultum est petere, quod possit iure negari.


Since therefore man's counsel without Gods help, is both weak and
fruitless, (by reason that without him, we may not do any thing) let us first
of all seek from him our counsel and his justice, and all other goods shall
be annexed and tied unto us. Next of all, thou must ask counsel, and
examine it in thy self, namely, whether thy will pervert not thy reason; thy
superstition, thy devotion; thy self love, thy judgment; briefly, thou must
chiefest of all, so draw counsel from thy self, that thy moderation be not
perverted by rage, nor thy discretion by light belief: First take heed, that
neither thou thy self be irefull, nor thy counselor be wrothfull, and that
for many reasons: First, because the ireful man thinks his ability to exceed
his power, and by that means he overcomes his own ability: for it is a true
law, that he who thineketh he can more then his nature ministers; in exceeding
his own power, thinks himself to be imbaced: secondly, because the
wrothfull man speaks not according as justice directs him, but as the spleen
peruerteth him: Thirdly, because wroth hinders the mind, whereupon the Poet
says: Wroth lets the mind for fear it spy the truth.


In counsels therefore, and in other things, thou must restrain the
disturbed motions of thy soul, and make thy desires obedient to the rules of
love and reason: for so Tullie counsaileth, when he says, Govern thy wrath,
because when it has power, nothing may either be done rightly, or
consideratly: for those things which are wrought with any perturbation, can
neither be done with constancy, nor approved by those that are absent: wroth
has no mean, neither does interrupted fury admit any moderation. For the
irefull man accounts al counsel inconsiderat: he that overcomes his
wroth, overcomes a great enemy, and he can never be considerat, that is
sildome moderat: in counsel likewise thou must avoid pleasure or cupidity,
least either ye one or other, overcome the sense and judgment of either thee,
or thy chosen counsel. First because desire and covetousness is the root of
all evils, Paul ad Cor. Secondly, because the voluptuousnes of the heart
extinguisheth the light of the mind, and contains in it self all kind of
inconvenience: For Tully in his book de Senectute says, That nature has not
given man more capital or fatal enemies then the desires and pleasures of the
body, for from it spring rash and vnrefrained lusts, inciting and perverting
the mind, and (after many enormities reckoned up) he concludes, that there is
no place for virtue in the kingdom of pleasure. For which cause there is
nothing so detestable or pestilerous as to follow pleasure, for where it takes
most head and root, there is all the light of the soul extinguished. And
truly pleasure is so bad, that it never springs except grief forego it: for
as Alphonsus says, no man is delighted with drinking, except he be foregreeued
with thirst, neither takes any man pleasure in eating, except he has been
plagued with hunger: neither affects any man rest, except he has been
agreeued, and agrauated by labor: beside, (this is to be noted) that in every
and the least danger, there is some imminent peril, whereupon the Philosopher
said thus, Whosoever is voluptuous, cannot want vice. Thirdly, in thy
counsels and other things thou must avoid and remove covetous desire, quia
parat peccatum, and generat mortem, as James says: Fourthly, thou must avoid
desire both in thy self and thy counsailers; because all desires are the gates
of hell, by which we have recourse unto death: Fifthly in thine actions and
counsels whatsoever, thou must expel desire, because it loves nothing else,
but that which is vnlawsul: and therefore Seneca says, Ferocissima cupiditas
pestis est, quis solet egenos facere quos capit, quia finemquerendi, non
inuenit, alia enim cupiditas, ex fine alterius nascitur, Desire (quoth he) is a
fierce plague, which not only makes thee poor when it surpriseth, because it
finds no end in seeking: for one desire is begotten by the issue and end of
another, and therefore in another place (he says) he is stronger that
overcomes his desire, then he which mastereth his enemy. Sixthly, desire in
all affairs and actions, is to be both removed and reproved, especial to the
end that infirmities may be avoided: for if (as it is proved) desire has no
end, it deserves (and that worthily) to be despised; whereupon (a father
says) follow not infinite things, for where is no end, there can be no rest,
and where there is no rest, there can be no peace, and where there is no peace,
God cannot dwell: for as David says, His place is in peace, and his habitation
in Sion. In counsels likewise thou must avoid all have and rashness, for as
in judgment celerilie is condemned, (whereupon it is wont to be said, that he
is the best judge that quickly apprehends and slowly judges; and again, he
hastes to repent him that swiftly censureth) so is it written of counsel, in
thy counsels the longer thou have deliberated, think thou have the righter
done: for the swiftest counsails, are soonest repented: Thou must not therefore
either give or take counsel hastily, or suddenly, but with advised
deliberation, and competent delay: for as Seneca says, Lib de For. honest.
vit. Let nothing be sudden unto thee, but in all things foresee; for he who is
provident, says not, I had not thought it should have come to pass; for he
doubts not, but expects, neither suspecteth he but takes heed: For which
cause in temporal deliberations a competent delay is not to be reproved, for
to deliberate on things profitable, is a most provident delay. A Philosopher
likewise says, That all delay is odious, but yet it makes a wise man: These
conditions thus foreknowne and well debated of, thou must likewise take heed
and provide, that thou conceal thy counsel to thy self, neither demand
counsel of another, if by other men's counsel thou know thy estate may
not be amended. For as Jesus the son of Sirach says, Show not thy thought to
thy friend or enemy, and if it be thy fault discover it not, for he shall
hear thee, and regard thee, and defending thy sin laugh at thee: and another
wise man says, Think scarcely that one man can keep thy secrets: and
Alphonsus says, Thy counsel or secret being hidden, is as it were shut in
thy prison, but being revealed, holds thee prisoner in his prison: another
says, He that keeps his counsel in his heart, is Master of himself, for
it is better for a man to hold his peace, then to desire any other man to keep
close his secrets: for as Seneca says, If thou have not governed thy self in
silence, how can thou seek secrecy from another? But if thou think to
better thine estate by another man's counsel then deliberate with thy self,
and diligently provide in thy self, to whom thou will open thy secrets, and to
whom thou will impart thy counsels: In steed of vnaproued friends, furnish
thy self a thousand times rather with enemies then friends, because by good
hap thine enemy may be made thy friend, and so by that means he may the more
lightly procure thy indomagement: Provide also, that thou discover not thy
resolution, to those counsailers whom thou meanest to employ, for men for the
most part are flatterers, and rather respect the looks of a mighty man then
the truth, and that which they think will please, then that which is requisite;
so that respecting rather their will then their conscience, they deceive thee
in thy counsel, and condemn their own indiscretions. When then thou have
asked counsel of thy self, provide thee of thy counsailers, and know from
whom thou ought to expect council, for in asking advice, carefully observe
this caution, to discern thy good friends from thine evil enemies. To be
short, counsel is to be expected from good, wise, expert, and approved friends,
who have both authority by age, and are known trusty by experience. And
therefore Solomon says, There is nothing may be compared with a faithful
feind, neither may the weight of gold and silver outprise his faith and
goodness: and in another place, The heart is delighted in ointments and diverse
odors, and the heart is reioiced with the counsails of a good friend: There is
nothing sweeter (says he) the^ to have a friend, with who thou may
communicate thy secrets: For as the body is without a soul, such is a man
without a friend: choose thy friend likewise that he may be wise, and thereby
verify the old Proverb: Non de ponte cadit, qui cum sapientia vadit.


Choose thy counsalle like wise of thy approved friends, because many are
thought wise, but too few faithful, many are circumspect, but malicious, many
have smooth forheads, and false hearts, You must not therefore trust all men,
but make trial of only faithful men: For as John says, Beloved, believe not
every spirit, but prove the spirits if they be of God: and the wise man says,
who quickly believes, is light and unstaid in heart, and shall be deceived:
for a mind easily misled, is quickly induced to folly, a Poet like wise that
has more of sense, then eloquence says: Ne lauds amicum donec probaueris
illum.


And Solomon says, if thou possess a friend, possess him in temptation, for
a friend is according to his times, and therefore till miseries try them,
think no man trusty to thee. Have care like wise that thou make choice of old
men, for in the aged is wisdom, and in gray hairs experience, and (as
Cassiodorus says) they are always held most wise, who by the conuersacions of
many men, have been approved learned: And Tully in his book de Senectute,
has this sentence: Great things are not managed by the velocitie, force, and
celerity of the body; but by counsel, authority, and science, of which old
age is only not deprived, but also furnished: in asking therefore counsel of
the above specified, observe this rule, That first you make trial of one or
two, before the whole body of your counsel: for as Solomon says, Many are
pleasing unto thee, and speak thee fair, but choose one counsailor amongst a
thousand: and consult thou not with them at one time only, but at many times
also: for where there is no heed (says the wise) the policy runs to ruin:
But there is health where are counsels: and generally the cogitations are
scattered where there is no advice, but where there are many counsailors, their
judgments are conformed. Now since thou know of whom thou art to demand
counsel, let us like wise consider whose counsel thou should avoid: for
there is as great policy in shunning a danger, as intertaining a good
fortune. First therefore I advise thee in any sort to fly the counsels of
fools, for fond men delight in fond things; and aim al their counsels,
according to their conceits. For as a father says, It is the property of
folly to be searching into others escapes, and forgetful of his own. The
wisemans heart (says Solomon) is on his right side, but the heart of a fool
on his left: If thou bray a fool in a mortar (quoth the wise man) thou shall
not drive him from his folly. Briefly, if a wise man contend with a fool,
whether he smile or sorrow, he shall find no rest. The counsel of flatterers
in like sort is to be avoided; and not only in adversity, but in prosperity,
the advice of friends, and faithful men is to be used: In prosperity like
wise, we have greatest use of friendship, least we should be seduced by
flattery, or deceived by dissimulation: For we oftentimes suppose our selves
such as we are praised for; wherethrough we grow into mighty sins, and being
puffed up by men's opinions, are shamefully derided, and more cursedly misled:
For which cause, think there is no greater plague in friendship, then pleasing
and smooth colored flattery. And although flattery be pernicious, yet can it
hurt no man but him that receives and delights in the same, so that if he
open his ears to those flatterers, he greatly delights both him that
flattereth, and himself most of all: Where upon Cato says, If any praise
thee, remember to be thine own judge, and rather trust others men's judgments
of thy self, then believe thy self by thy self: whereupon Seneca in his
Epistles writes, Consider thy self inwardly, and believe not other what thou
art; it more concerns thee to know what thou seem to thy self, then what
thou art esteemed by others: For it is a wise man's part, rather to judge
himself than his neighbor. And touching acceptance in taking counsel in
time of prosperity, thus says Seneca in his book de formula honestas vitas.
Then when thou art in prosperity ask counsel, as if in danger, and rather
fear fair speech, then bitter good counsels. For an evil man that speaks
fair, is the net of the innocent, and there are none so secret treasons, as
those that are colored with the office of dissimulation, or under the name of
friendship: It is therefore better to receive the stripes of a friend, then the
kisses of a flatterer. Be not therefore moved with the fair, sweet, and choice
words of a flatterer, but regard thine own affairs, and examine their
discourses: A wise man respects the matter, not the oratorie, for he that
speaks truth, his speech is plain and unpolished. And although thou think
thy self a wise man, yet trust not thine own purpose, but with deliberate
judgment seek wisdom from another man: For Cassiodorus councelleth to seek
wisdom in another man in whom is greatness of science, for to doubt and to
ask council of the wise, is neither unprofitable nor immodest. The counsel
likewise of those men is to be eschewed, who in times past were thine enemies,
and are afterward reconciled: for no man safely returns into favor with his
enemy, For which cause Esope said, neither trust, or discover your secrets to
those with whom you have been at debate and contention. Nulla fides hosti,
tibi sit qui talia noste,
Prorsus and hostilis tibi sit persuatio vilis.


For as where fire bath been long time, there never wants vapor; so where
ancient enmities have been continued, there cannot be true love, neither may
there ever be default of suspect: Thine enemy will weep in thy presence, and
when he spies his time, be imbrued with thy blood: associat thee not therefore
with thine enemies, when thou may find other friends, for the evils thou have
done them, they will not forget, and the favors thou offerest them, they will
suspect. Their counsel like wise is to be eschewed who not for love, but
fear show love and dilection: for they are not friends but odious enemies. For
Tully says (in his Offices) amongst all things there is nothing more apt to
maintain riches, and retain them being compassed, then love; neither any
thing more fond, then to be feared: For men deadly hate those whom they fear,
and whatsoever a man earnestly hates, he desires to see perished. And yt no
wealth may withstand many men's hate, though before it were unknown, yet now is
it manifest, doc not therefore think that either counsailor or friend may be
gotten by fear, for no man is faithful to him he fears, and therefore
Martial long: Inuitas vero nemo coactus amat.


And good counsel and friendship is not only not retained or attained by fear
and terror, but every kingdom likewise maintained by fear, does soon come to
perdition. For (as the Philosopher says) he ought to fear many, when many
fear; and as Seneca concludes, No terrible man can be secure in his
monarchy: The riotous man's counsel also must be eschewed, for how can he be
trusty in thy secrets, who is a traitor to his own body? They likewise that
pretend one thing privately, and protest another openly, are to be rejected,
for it is a certain kind of harm and injustice, to speak one thing secretly,
and make show of another thing openly: Fly likewise the council of the evil
and suspected, For he that is evil in himself, never delivers good
counsel from himself, and where the heart is fraught with impiety, the
tongue utters nothing but dissimulation and subtilty: young men in counsel
likewise are deeply to be suspected, for they have ripe wits, and young
desires, Woe says the wise man to that land, whose king is a child, and whose
Princes eat early. It follows now in what sort, and how thou ought to
examine counsel: For in it there needs great circumspection and discretion,
that both the beginning progress and end be very diligently examined. First
therefore in discerning counsel, both generally suppress in thy self, and
remove from thy counsailers, ire, pleasure, desire, and have, the arch enemies
of all deltheration; Secondly, respect the beginning of thy affairs, for the
law tieth a man to circumspection in nothing more then the entrance: and
therefore the Proverb says, He that has begun well, has half happily
finshed. For all examples have had their springs from good beginnings: and in all good things thou shall continually find a double evil: in the beginning
therefore thou ought to fear, because of the double evils which accompany
every thing: For if in good beginnings there is a doubt of double harm, much
more in things badly begun and improuidently disposed, is there danger, For
they sildom or never have good ends which have badly begun: The beginnings are
in our own powers, but the events in fortunes hands: wisely therefore, and
with great discretion examine thou thy counsels, for it is the property of a
prudent man to pry into every thing to avoid credulity, and to prevent
falsehood. In examining thy counsel likewise observe these circumstances, that
in every thing thou respect that which is true and sincere, what conuenience or
consequent, and whence matters take head, and what is the cause and reason of
every thing: Thou must therefore be respective to the truth, because truth is
only to be regarded, which only makes men like to God, because God in himself
is perfect truth, as appears by Christ's words, Ego sum via, veritas, and
vita: I am the way, the truth, and the life; and therefore require I sincerity
(as Tully did) in counsel, because pure and sincere verity is to be
respected, and mendacious and subtle lying, is earnestly to be avoided: For
(as the Philosopher says) verity is perfect, when it is not intermedled with
falsehood: and the wise man says, Rather is a thief to be believed, then an
assiduous and common lier to be heard. And where I annex a convenient regard in
affairs, it is for this cause, because in all thy counsels, thou must have
this regard, that they be convenient and agreeable with reason. Thou must
likewise respect who they be that consent to the affairs, will, and counsails,
and who contradict the same, that by this thou may know whether thy business
or determination will sort to good or no: Thou must likewise examine and
foresee, whether thy purpose consent or stand with possibility: and in all the
foresaid, be so provident in examining, yt thine appetite may agree with
reason, vtility, and possibility: Touching consequence also, have diligent care
in examining, whether thou shall obtain good or evil, hate, fear, or love, by
thy counsels; and whether either damage or utility, justice, or injury,
(and many such like, which have correspondence with the consequence, and may
not fitly be numbered in this place:) in all which, good is to be chosen and
profit to be taken; hate, fear, injury, and all such other evils generally
omitted and removed: Touching the circumstance, whence matters are derived,
thou must be very thoughtfull in examining every word of the counsel, and
careful to consider, whether they spring from virtue or vice, or from any
thing that deservedly ought to be avoided, or from which profit or commodity
may be drawn. Touching examination of the cause, thou must be very provident
in pondering the reasons thereof, and earnestly seeking out the grounds of
matters: For so Seneca counseled, when he said, search out the cause of every
action, and when thou have found out the beginning, bethink thee of the end,
not slightly, but iudicially: dispose thy mind into three parts; ordinat the
present; foresee the future; and remember that is past: for he rightly loses
his life, that bethinketh him not of yt which has past him; who never
premeditates on things to come, manageth all things improuidently: Propose
therefore in thy mind both the good and evil fortunes that may chance, that
thou may sustain the one, and moderat the other. Now since thou know how
counsel is to be examined, consider likewise how it is to be taken and
approved: For then is counsel chiefly to be taken and approved when it is
both examined, and found to be good and profitable. And although the counsel
seems good, it is not presently to be executed: but thou must diligently
look into it, how thou can effect the same. For he that comes to the
government of a Commonweal, and the management of affairs, must not only take
consideration, that the thing is honest, but he must likewise ponder with
himself if he have power to effect it: In which it is likewise to be
considered, that he despair not rashly for sloth sake, or grow less
considerate through desire and covetousness, so that in all affairs before
they be enterprised, thou must employ a diligent preparation: Consider
therefore that thou take not too much, for as the Proverb says, Qui nimis
capit, parum stringit: So that rightly thou ought to begin nothing but yt
which reasonably thou may bring to effect. Search not (quoth Seneca) things
above thy reach, only seek yt which may be found, learn that which may be
known, desire that which may be wished for: He that desires to fly before he
get him wings, is assured to fall before he expects it: for if thou should
only take respect to the goodness, profit, and honor of the affair only,
without the consideration of the facility, possibility, and conuenience of
the same, that would fall out which the poet says, Qui plus posse putat sua
quem natura ministrat
Posse suum superans seminus esse potest.


And if the counsel be doubtful in deed or word, thou must rather conceal
it, then execute it: leave it, then take it: For it becomes a wise man rather
to be silent by himself, then to speak against himself, because it is
apparent that many have been overtaken by their talk, but few men
circumuented by their silence: for words are like to arrows, which are easily
shot out, but hardly got in again. In doubtful matters therefore, silence is
requisite, and actions uncertain, are better left undone, then unfortunately
hazarded. To conclude (in all the forenamed) so be thou still instructed by thy
self and others; that all other contraries let slip, thou only build and make
choice of that which is good, true, profitable, just, and reasonable. Now since
thou know how counsel is to be taken, consider likewise how, and in what
sort it is to be retained, which is even then, when by proof and experience
it is known profitable. For prove all, says S. Paul, and keep only that
which is good, and that with great constancy: for so counsaileth Seneca, when
he says, Be thou moouable, not light: constant, but not obstinate. It now
remains that thou learn when thy counsels, or promises may be changed: the
alteration whereof is approved for many causes: for the first cause ceasing and
a new succeeding, counsel or promise may be changed: and that according to
Philosophy which says, that the causes ceasing, the effects likewise cease:
counsel also can and may be changed, it either by error or any other cause it
prove indecent: for as Seneca says, Certain things there be that seem good
and are not, and certain other which seem and are so: for very oftentimes
the truth bears show of a lie, and oftentimes a lie hides the hope of truth:
Counsel likewise is to be changed, if it depend on dishonest causes, or in it
self be unlawful: For according to the law, and generally all unlawful
pronuses are of no regard: Counsel likewise is to be altered if it be sinful,
or pertain thereto; for there is no counsel against God: and of no less
worth is a promise impossible, then an assumpsit unreasonable. A wise man lies
not when he changes his purpose for the better, and it is always held a rule
among the learned, that the counsel cannot be good which cannot be changed.
Good father Anthony quoth Frumentarius, I am resolved in all points touching
the course of counsel, I pray you therefore descend to the discourse of wars:
for the world being so much given to contention, there is nothing that should
be sooner learned. Frumentanus quoth Anthony, I will fit thee in this
likewise, The discourse of war requires a long Treatise, because it includes
great dangers, and that must advisedly be spoken of, which rashly followed, is
ruinous and fatal: War in one sort is the mother of inconvenience, for it
indangereth those too often that hope in it, and helps those too fondly, that
should fall by it: It is likewise an arm of justice, for were there not arms
to revenge justice, the authority of princedome would be too forward in
injuries: war likewise is an effect of vengeance, for God sends the that
are too secure in their peace, a mighty sword to confound them in their
security: By war the wicked war rich, and the poor fortunat, and the effects
thereof are such, as the hungry are filled with good things, and the rich are
sent empty away. To conclude, war is the Mistress of confusion, making
policy of confusions, and confusions policies. They that undertake it, must
serve the necessities thereof; and they that wish for it, are the discontented:
who in affecting innovation in hope to be bettered, do fall on the sword by
untimely death. Briefly, war is not to be wished for, for as Tully says, All
liberty is restrained therein, and those profits that proceed thereof, are as
well ruins, as raisings of a Commonweal. The conqueror, what wins he? Who
to relieve a few colonies that are invaded, loses many thousand subjects,
whose equals cannot be found out. Should I discourse at full of this subject,
define, divide, subdeuide, and examine particulars, it would rather require a
volume then a discourse, such as I can yield thee: I will therefore only touch
things necessary, and leave the rest to thine own reading, instructing thee
only in those things which are lawful, and prescribing thee certain rules
when it is lawful to enter fight, and admit contention, which may be referred
to these eight causes. Thou may lawfully fight, first of all for the
maintenance of thy faith; next for justice sake; Thirdly, to maintain peace;
Fourthly to conserve liberty; Fifthly to avoid dishonestie and turpitude;
Sixthly, to repel violence; Seventhly, for the defense of a man's own body;
Eighthly, for a necessary cause: First touching war to be undertaken for faith,
there is nothing more just, nothing more reasonable, neither any thing more
honest; for faith is our buckler, where under we guard all virtues, our seal of
inheritance, our linck of Christianity, our aliance with God, and rather is
death to be suffered, then religion to be forsaken: we ought likewise to fight
for Justice sake, even to the utterance of our lives, for except justice be
maintained, Commonweals are ruinated: for peace likewise, war is lawful;
because by peace, justice and communities are maintained: war likewise is
lawful for the maintenance of liberty and auoidance of servitude, for as Tully
says, When time and necessity require, man may fight, and a valiant death is
to be preferred before a servile and obscure life: for happily is he killed,
who ignominiously serves, Thou may also fight to avoid Turpitude, for no
death is so odious as the indurance of dishonestie. Thou may likewise fight
to repel violence, for all laws and rights permit this, to repel force by
force. In thine own defense likewise may thou war, for the law says, that
what man does in his own defense, is lawfully done. And law of nature likewise
teaches us to detest injuries, for it is better to withstand in time, then
revenge after wrongs: Resist thou therefore bouldly injustice, violence, and
injury done unto thee, for as greatly is he in fault (says Tully) that
resists not if he can, as he that being of ability leaves both his friends,
and his country. Thou may rightly war also upon a just cause, as being
sommoned by denuntiation and general proclamation: For assuredly that enemy
thinks himself strong, or in effect is rash and unadvised, that calls his
equal to combat, and makes open profession of displeasure. Again, touching
war, these few notes are to be considered, That God has therefore ordained and
commanded the law of the sword, to bring them in peace by the sword, that will
not otherwise obey the laws of right and charity. That war likewise is held
lawful, it appears, because God himself vouchsafes the name of the Lord of
hosts. To conclude, battle according to other, is only lawful in three
causes: First when the cause is rightful, Next the intention good: Thirdly, if
it be done by the authority of a lawful Prince. It is needful first of all
that the cause be rightful, and that men fight only for the right, and to
maintain right, and for the preservation of the communaltie, and those that
are guiltless and would have peace: for (as Augustine says) the end of
battle should be peace. Their intention also must be rightful, not that they
fight for ambition to get the authority, or for covetousness to get riches, or
for malice to be revenged of grutches, or for cruelty to murder men: For if
their intention be wicked, though their cause be just, they sin in
manslaughter, and for their wicked intention God suffers them to be overcome
in a rightful cause: it must likewise be executed by the authority of a
lawful Prince, not raised by injustice, but made by common custom, by
authority of law, by rightful election, for although a man gather a multitude
against his prince, and by the rebels his followers is made their head, yet is
he neither to command, neither ought they unjustly to obey, for both their
election in him is unlawful, and obedience toward him unjust: This suffices
(quoth Frumentarius) only good Anthony discourse of justice, and thou leauest
me well resolved: Frumentarius quoth Anthony, justice has best execucion,
where there foregoeth good election, for a prince that chooses good judges, is
sure his laws shall be well executed: First therefore in choice of thy judges,
out of many, choose few, out of few the wisest, out of the wisest the expertest,
out of the expertest, ye most prudent, of the most prudent, the most quietest,
and of the quietest, the eldest: for the true and worthy judge, without all
doubt, must be of a generous and noble blood, old in years, of life honest, of
little folly and much experience, in speech resolute, and in knowledge
profound. The true judge must not relent by prayers, nor be corrupted with
gifts, nor deceived with words, nor disturbed with threatenings, or misseled
with money, nor overcome with pity: The good judge must have always one hand
ready to sustain the good, and the other to punish the wicked: A good judge
is he that deals in truth, speaks truth, and is a friend of truth, and an
enemy to liers: A good judge must be wise in that he commands, just in his
judgments, and moderat in his executions: and (that which is more then all
that) in matters of justice, and the determination thereof, he show neither
passion, nor affection. No man in this world is so perfect, but there is in him
to be amended, neither any man so evil, that has not in him to be praised.
The history writers do note Homer of vain speech, task Alexander for fury,
Caesar for ambition, Pompey for pride, Demetrius for vices, Hanniball for
perjury, Vespatian for covetousness, Traian for a winebibber, Aurelius for
amorous: Amongst men so great, glorious, and famous as these, Judges may well
think to be noted of faults, and therefore ought to be very careful to direct
a circumspect and wary course in their lives: that they may avoid scandalizers
and slanderers. Judges likewise ought to be good Christians, and not weak in
patience, For there is no virtue more requisite in a Commonweal, then
patience: for the judge that is measured in that he speaks, and dissembleth
the injuries done unto him, he may not lightly fall. Those that govern people,
and determine causes, much more then other men ought to live warely, and be of
more sufferance, for as they judge, so are they regarded, measured, and
considered: There is nothing in this world more sure (as I have said before)
then that he which is feared of many ought also to fear many; and therefore it
comes to pass, that many times the judge is more damnified in his fame, then
the suitor in his goods: I mean this of judges who are proud and melancholy:
But such as are mild and gentle in suffering, the people examine not the lives
they lead, but they dissemble their other faults. He that has charge of the
Commonweal, it is requisite that he have a mild condition, in such wise that
when he see weakness, he make it strong, and where he sees courage, in
goodness, that he praise it; and where he sees dissolution, that he chastise:
and where he sees necessity, that he succor: and where he sees sedition, to
appease it; and where he sees conformity, to conserve it: and where he sees
heaviness to remedy it: and where he sees gladness, to temper it: For after
great pleasure and gladness, many times do follow no small distresses.
Again, it is requisite that judges be mild in conversation, and measured in
words, for in them of such authority the people do many times take more
grief with a word, then in others with the stroke of a sword. To conclude,
let thy judges deal with equal balance, to rich and poor, so shall they
please God, discharge their duties to thee, and get honor to their names in
executing justice without rigor or affection. For thy self take these rules in
thy government and justice, Do all things with love, and revenge nothing for
hatred, neither be held one of those that would pardon their enemies, and dare
not for their friends: Aware in thy kingdom, least the proud command the
humble; the Tirant, the just; the cruel, the pitiful; the dastard, the hardy;
the ignorant, the prudent; and the worst theefes, hang the innocent: Sell not
thy justice for riches, least thou live not to enjoy them, and grow defamed by
purchasing them: be not a covetous and wretched niggard, least thou seek out
carefulnes for thy self, envy for thy neighbors, spurs to thine enemies, a
prey for thieves, perrill for thy person, damnation for thy soul, curses for
thine heirs, and law for thy children. Be not wrothfull in justice, for it is
a short madness; nor on light displeasures, least thou be held a fool; nor
with a stronger then thy self, least thou repent; or with thy inferior, least
thou be held tyranous: Let not thy corruptions and customs draw on vain
delights, neither be thou held the maker of a law, to be the first breaker of
the same: beware least thy followers be found wicked, for where vice is
supported by authority, there subjects grow worse and worse: and where
punishment is restrained, there insolency commands the laws: be provident that
no merit pass thee without reward, or fault without punishment: carry this
always in thy mind, That good men bear more honor to the sepulchers of the
virtuous, then to the imbossed palaces of wicked Tirants. To conclude, to bear
thy fortune always equal, make thy counsails always honest, choose thy judges
upright and impartial, and thy self shall have honor, thy magistrates fame,
thy subjects peace, and thy country plenty. Anthony would have prosecuted this
argument further, and Asterius was ready to urge him to his history, when
suddenly the day ouercast, the sun hid him in the Ocean, the birds be took
them to rest, the winds to rise and rage, the heavens to weep and shower, so
that interrupted both by night and storms, perforced they were cut off from
their conference, and all of them entered Anthonies cave, where till the morrow
I leave them to their weak cheer and hard lodging. And if gentlemen I
perceive that this days discourse delight you, in the morning when they wake,
I shall entreat them to find out more matter and pleasure to content you, mean
while I commit you and commend you to the tuition of the Almighty, ending with
that of Ausonius: Nemosilens placuit, breuitate loquendi:
And that of Martials: Nonsunt longa quibus nihil est quod donere possis.


FINIS.
