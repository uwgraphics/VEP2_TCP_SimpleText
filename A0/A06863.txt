A BOOK OF NOTES and Common places, with their expositions, collected and
gathered out of the works of diverse singular Writers, and brought
Alphabetically into order.

A work both profitable and also necessary, to those that desire the true
understanding and meaning of holy Scripture BY JOHN MARBECK.

2. Tim. 3. 16.

All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable to doctrine,
to reprove to correction, to instruction, which is in righteousness, that the
man of God may be perfect, instructed unto all good works.

Imprinted at London, by Thomas East. 1581.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, AND HIS ESPECIAL good Lord, the Earl of Huntington,
Knight of the most noble order of the Garter, etc. John Marbeck wishes a most
happy and prosperous estate, with increase of virtue in the fear of GOD.
AS THE CHILdren of Israel had inestimable cause to praise the great goodness
of almighty God, and to render condign thanks unto him for his most merciful
deliverance out of their vile captivity and bondage, which they so long had
sustained under that proud resister of Gods omnipotent power, king Pharao;
Even so (Right honorable) are we no less bound, to honor, land, and praise
the same God with immortal thanks, which now of his entire love, pity, and
compassion (in this our last age of the world) has broken the yoke of our
miserable servitude, under that proud exalter of himself, the Romish
Antichrist, and of the bondmen and slaves of that tyrant, has made us free men
in his son Jesus Christ through the true knowledge of his eternal and
everlasting word. For as the people that dwell in the country called Cimmeria do
remain in continual darkness, by reason they want the clear light of the
Sun which is so far distant from them. So were we (poor souls) during the
time of our thraldo^e under the power of the Pope in like obscurity shut and
pend up (as prisoners) in the dark dungeon of his Antichristian jurisdiction,
and always constrained to feed on the scraps of his own unsavory and most
unfruitful traditions and devilish devices, for lack of the wholesome food of
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, whereof the least little spark could not be
permitted to put forth his light among us. But now (my good Lord) seeing that
all the sleights and grounds of the Popes inventions (which wholly consists in
false superstitious worshipping, filthy Idolatry, fained hypocrisy, foolish
scrupulositie, with other the like) be clearly sifted and boulted out, from the
boulting tub of his Cano^ laws by infinite godly and learned writers,
especialiye by such as be here expressed within this volume, it shall behoue
us to embrace and lay sure hold on the profound saiengs of those so godly
writers, or rather upon the truth uttered by their pens: that being weaponed
with such artillery, we may be able to resist and overthrow, whatsoever the
whole Popish army shall assay to assalt us with all. For what is the cause that
many at this present day, do fall a lusting after Romish religion, as did the
Israelits to feed on the flesh pots of Aegypts gain? But that they despise to
apparel themselves with the armor of Christ, esteeming much better their old
apparel of Popery, although it seem never so vile in the sight of God. Which
miserable and deceived sort (but yet truly most wilful and froward people)
that I might by the mercy of God in some measure persuade, if not wholly
convert to the truth, I have the rather employed my diligence in collecting
these common places (sincerely expounded by the authors themselves) that in the
reading and earnest study thereof, there may some spark of Gods true knowledge,
kindle aright understanding in them, which the Lord grant, that his only
praise and glory may therein be showed. And now, Right honorable, having as
yet no help for the publishing of my Concordance, which without special help
is like to lie not only helples, but also fruitless, enclosed in an huge
volume of mine own writing, wherein I have spent many years, in purpose thereby
to profit the studies of the godly affected, in the English tongue, so that I
am not able, as my meaning was, to exhibit the same unto you: I shall most
humbly beseech your honor to accept and take in good part, my simple travails
in this other work, which God of his goodness, in these mine old years, has
now brought forth in me: That I may not seem altogethers unfruitful to the
Church of God, nor unthankful unto you mine especial good Lord, but that at
the least a testification of my faithful heart to Gods people, and of my good
will to your honor, may somewhat therein appear. For whom as duty requires,
I will remain during life, a continual intercessour unto almighty God, that
his blessings may be multiplied upon you, and that abounding in all good gifts
both of body and mind, you may enjoy upon this earth a long, life, in perfect
health and honor, to his glory, and to the profit of others, and after the end
of your race, may be blessed for ever in the felicity of the faithful.

Amen.

AARON.
How long Aaron was before Christ.
AAron the son of Amram, nephew to Leuy, and brother to Moses, was borne
about the year before Christ's incarnation 1609. at what time as Amenophis was
king of Egypt. Lanquet.

How Aaron is a figure of Christ.
And he stood between the dead. Aaron is here a figure of Christ, which is
the mediator between God and the Church, Nu. 16. g. ver. 48.
which restrains the just vengeance of God for the sins of the world, which
helps the chosen when they be in misery. T. M.

A comparison between Aaron and Christ.
Aaron was in nature a perfect man, and so was Christ and more excellent in
property, being without sin. Aaron ministered not for the peoples sake, but
for his own also being a sinner: Christ for the people only, himself
needing nothing. Aaron offered Sacrifice, but other things none of his own:
Christ offered his Sacrifice, his own, and himself. etc. Deering.

What Aarons Bells signified.
As Aaron with his succession was a lively figure of our Savior Christ Jesus,
who is the high Priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedech, by whom they
had all a full and perfect salvation, that by him do come to God, living
always to this end, that he may appear in the sight of God for us. Exo. 28.
f. ver. 33.
So the golden Bells that he was commanded to have in the hem of his Tunicle did
signify the earnest and lively preaching of the Gospel, whereby Christ our
savior and his Apostles did waken the world out of the sleep of death, as all
good and faithful ministers of the Church following his example, and the
example of the Apostles, ought to do. So does Origin expound it saying: Let
also the high sovereign Priest, have bells about his garment, that when he
goes into the holy place he may give a sound, and not enter into it with
silence. And these Bells that ought always to ring, are put in the hem of his
Tunicle, which (as I believe) is done to this end, that thou should never
hold thy peace of the latter days, and of the end of the world, but thou
should always ring of it, according to that that is said: Remember the end,
and thou shall live. 1. Veron.

ABADDON.
How it is the right name both of Satan and of the Pope.
WHose name in Hebrew is Abaddon. Apoc. 9. b. ver. 11.
Abad in Hebrew signifies to destroy, whereof comes Abaddon, as ye would
say a destroier, or destroieng, and in Greek Apollyo^. For in Greek Apollyon
signifies the same y^ Abaddon does in Hebrew. The old translator in latin has
added, Habens nomen exterminans: that is to say in English, Having ye name of
destroier. For John wrote in Greek, and passed for no more, but to be
understood of them that knew the Greek. And yet it must not seem against
reason, that the ancient translator was desirous to have the latin men know
what Apollyon signifies, to the end that all men might beware of Antichrists
wiles. For this name agrees very fitly to Satan, and to Antichrist his
son. For like as Satan is a murderer from the beginning. John. 8. ver. 44.
and undid all mankind with his naughtiness: even so has Antichrist with ye
venime of his errors, led away an innumerable multitude of men into deadly,
yea and speedy destruction. In which respect Paul terms him the child of
perdition. 2. The. 2 a. ver. 3. And Christ says: A thief comes not but to
steal, and to murder, and to destroy. John. 10. b. ver. 10. Marl. upon the
Apo. fo. 134.

Abaddon, that is destroier: for Antichrist ye son of perdition, destroieth
men's souls with false doctrine, and the whole world with fire and sword.
Geneua.

ABOMINABLE.
Who be abominable.
ANd the Abominable. Apoc. 21. b ver. 8.
He terms them Abominable, who after the knowledge of ye truth, do not
only slide back from it, by Apostasy, but also become most deadly enemies
thereof, biting and blaspheming it with their currish chaps: and finally,
abhor the truth, and are likewise abhorred of God who is the truth. For
Abominable signifies any thing that the stomach loatheth or abhors.
Concerning such loathly and abominable creatures, look M. t. 12 d. ver. 45.
and Heb. 6. a. ver. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. and 2. Pet. 2. ver. 20. 21. 22. Therefore we
must regard, not what pleases the world, but what pleases God, least we
vouchsafe chief honor upon those, whom God does worthily abhor. For (says
M^rlarat) this saying of our Savior is well known: Luke. 16. ver. 15.
That which is highly in the favor of men, is abominable before God. Marl.
upon the Apoc. fol. 289.

Abominable, They which jest and mock at religion. Geneua.

ABOMINATION OF DESOL.
How this place of Daniel is understood.
THese words of Christ and Daniel are diversely applied. Mat. 24 b. ver. 15.
Origin in Mat. Tract. 29. says thus, Antichrist is ye abomination of
desolation. S. Chrysostom. in opere imperfecto. hom 44 says: Dan. 9. g. ver. 27.
This Antichrist is called the abomination of desolation, for y^ he shall
cause the souls of many Christians to be desolate and forsaken of God. Greg.
Nazianzenus says: Antichrist shall come in ye desolation of ye world, for he
is ye abomination of desolation. S Hierom in Mat. cap. 24. says: By the
abomination of desolation we may understand all perverse doctrine: he says
also, the abomination of desolation shall stand in the Church until the
consummation of the world, lewel. fol. 446.

This Abomination y^ Daniel speaks of, was ye wickedness and Idolatry of ye
Jews, wherewith almost all ye whole nation was infected. It is called
abomination (which is as much to say as lothlines) because God lothed it as a
most silthie thing, and it was termed ye Abomination and desolation for ye
punishment y^ ensued, which punishment was ye desolation and wast of al ye
Jewish people.

Meaning (by desolation) that Jerusalem and the sanctuary should be utterly
destroyed, for their rebellion against God and their Idolatry: or some read
that the plagues should be so great, that they should all be astonished at them.
Geneua.

ABIMELECH.
How Abimelech is put in steed of Achis.
IN the title of the. 34. Psalm, Psalm. 34.
it is said that David changed his countenance before Abimelech. And in the
first book of kings the. 21. Chapter the story says, he feigned himself
before Achis. Here, seems to be a great contrariety, and to make these two
places agree, many has taken Ahimelech for Abimelech, yet there is great
difference in these two names, for Ahimelech is as much to say in latin, as
Frater meus Rex, my brother the King, and Abimelech is as much to say in
latin, as Pater meus Rex, my Father the King. So that they cannot be all one
name. But admit it were so, yet it cannot be true: for though David did
dissemble his adversity and persecution before Abimelech the Priest, yet he
did not change his cheer nor countenance before him, but made good semblance,
as though all had been quiet between king Saul and him, and on the other side
David did entreat him friendly and very gently, and not roughly. But when
he came before Achis, he fained himself mad, as the story says. Therefore to
make this plain, ye shall understand that Abimelech, which is mentioned in the
title of the 34. Psalm. is the self same person that is called in the text
Achis the king of Geth. So that Achis and Abimelech, is all one person, and all
one king. For like as the Emperors of Rome, are called Caesar's, of Julius
Caesar, and the kings of Egypt generally called by the name of Pharao: so all
the kings of the Philistines, were generally called by the name Abimelech. And
so in the one place, he is called by his general name Abimelech, and in the
other by his proper name Achis. By. Turnar.

Whereas in steed of Achis, there is put Abimelech, it is a likelihood that
the latter name was commonly used among the Philistines, like as the
Egyptians called their kings Pharaoz, and like as the Roman Emperors have
borrowed the name of Caesar of Julius Caesar, who made himself ye first tyrant
among them. And we know that many hundred years before David was borne, the
kings that reigned in Gerar in the time of Abraham, were called by the name
Abimelech, wherefore it is no marvel that this name shall pass to their
successors from hand to hand, so as it should become common to all the kings of
Palestine. Calvin.

Of the vices of Abimelech the son of Ierobaal or Gedeon.
First he was very ambitious, he deceiptfullie and falsely accused his
brethren, uses the corruption of briberie to work treason, is a robber of
the common treasury, he wrought by open violence, and at the last committed
murder of his brethren, called Parricidium. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 157.

ABRAHAM.
How Abraham is the heir of the world.
THere is no where by express words had, any such promise made to Abraham:
howbeit, it is contained in the promises which we have in the Scripture. For
God said to him, that his seed should be multiplied, like the sand of the Sea,
Genesis 22. ver. 17.
and the stars of heaven, Wherefore herein consists the promise, This his
seed should fill the whole world. For they are not counted his seed which
have proceeded from him only as touching the flesh, but which imitate his
faith. And forasmuch as such are dispersed throughout the whole world, by them
has Abraham the inheritance of y^ whole world, which self thing, is very
expreslie spoken, Genesis 22. ver. 18.
when God made this promise to him: And in thy seed shall all nations of the
earth be blessed. Pet. Mar. upon the To. ^o. 88.

What is meant by Abraham's bosom.
Some by the bosom of Abraham, Luke. 16. ver. 20.
do understand the faith of Abraham. Other some also understand it of the
place, where the elect and chosen that follow the faith of Abraham do rest
after their death. Bosom.
But where that place is (because the Scripture does not expreslie determine
it) can we not tell. And therefore may no man be so bold, as to define it. W.
Tindale.

The ecclesiastical writers do understand by Abraham's bosom, either the
promise made to Abraham (In thy seed shall all nations be blessed) or Christ
himself which came of the bosom and seed of Abraham, or else the fellowship
of them, that died in the faith of Abraham. Sir. I. Cheek.

As the Fathers in the old law, were said to be gathered into the bosom of
Abraham, because they received the fruit of the same faith with him. So in the
new Testament, we say that the members of Christ are joined to their head, and
gathered unto him. The Bosom signifies y^ most blessed life, which they that
die in the faith y^ Abraham did, shall enioie after this world. Geneua.

How Abraham's lie to Abimelech is excused.
Abraham also is objected, who said that Sara was his sister, Genesis 20. ver. 2.
but herein (as Augustine teaches) he lied not, he told that which was true,
but yet he spoke not all the truth. And that is of no man required, to utter
all that is true which he knows. Lie.
He did not tell that she was his wife: yet because she was his kinswoman, he
might according to the manner of the Hebrews truly say, that she was his
sister: but he seems not to be utterly excused: for although he lied not in
calling her sister, yet it seems that therein he fell, because in not opening
that she was his wife, he put her in danger of leesing her chastity, for he
left her naked of that aid, whereby only she might have been defended from
coming into strange loves. Neither is it necessary y^ I should labor utterly
to defend Abraham: for he was a man and by over much fear he might easily
fall. Howbeit Augustine mentions, y^ Abraham was then in danger two manner of
ways: one, least he should be killed himself, the other was the adultery of
his wife. The first danger he might avoid, by calling her sister: but the
other, namely, least she should be defiled, he was not able to repel. For
although he had said, that he was her husband, that would not have served to
have delivered her from the filthy lusts of the Egyptians. Wherefore he
committed unto God, that which he himself could not turn from him. And in
that which he had in his own power, he would not tempt God. This seems to be
Augustines Judgment.

He said to Abimelech, she is not my wife, but she is my sister, which was
true, for she was his sister by his fathers side, but not by his mother, the
daughter of Aran his brother, and consequently of his father. Forasmuch as
Fil^^s fil^orum dicuntur etiam filij auorum. The sons sons and daughters,
are also called the sons and daughters of the grandfather. And so she was
Abraham's sister, because she was his brothers daughter.

How Abraham did eat Christ's body.
When this promise was established to Abraham, Genesis 26. ver. 4.
by the word of God, which said: In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth
be blessed, he believed, which was counted to him for righteousness, and did
both eat his body, Eat.
and drink the blood of Christ (through faith) believing verelie, that Christ
should take our nature, and spring out of his seed (as touching the flesh) and
also that he should suffer death to redeem us. And as Christ testifies, he
heartelie desired to see the day of Christ, who saw it, and reioiced, He saw
it in faith, Ioh. 8. ver. 56
and had the day of Christ, that is to say, all those things that should
chance him plainly revealed unto him, albeit he were dead many hundred years,
before it was actuallie fulfilled and revealed unto the world, and by that
faith was he saved, and yet never did eat his flesh with his teeth, nor never
believed y^ bread should be his body, and wine his blood. And therefore since he
was saved without that faith, and the same faith shall save us that saved him,
I think we shall also be saved, if we eat him spirituallie (as he did)
although we never believe, that the bread is his body. I. Frith upon the Lords
supper against Moore.

Look. My day.

Of the communication between Abraham and the glutton.
The communication that the glutton had with Abraham happened spirituallie,

How God tried Abraham's faith.
Take now thy son, etc. and offer him up there. Herein stood the chiefest
point of his temptation, seeing he was commanded to offer up him, in whom God
had promised to bless all the nations of the world. Geneua.

How Abraham is said to be a Prophet.
Deliver the man his wife again, for he is a Prophet. That is, one to whom God
reuealeth himself familiarlie. Geneua.

ABSOLVTION.
How no mortal man can absolve from sin.
THeir absolution also; justifies no man from sin, for with the heart do men
believe, to be justified with all faith. Saint Paul. Romans 10. ver. 10. that
is, through faith and believing the promises are we justified, as I have
sufficiently proved in other places with the scripture. Faith (says Saint
Paul in the same place) comes by hearing, that is to say by hearing the
preacher that is sent from God and preaches. Gods promises. Now when they
absolve in latin, the unlearned hears not, for how says Paul, 1. Cor. 14.
ver. 16. when thou blessest in an unknown tongue, shall the unlearned say
Amen unto thy thanks giving, for he wotteth not what thou say. So likewise
the lay man wotteth not whether thou loose or bind, or whether thou bless or
curse. In like manner it is, if the lay understand Latin, or though the
Priest absolve in English, for in his Absolution he rehearses no promise of
Christ, but speaks his own words, saying: I by the authority of Peter and
Paul, absolve and loose thee from all thy sins. Thou say so which art but
a lieng man, and never more then now verelie. Thou say, Io^. 1. ver. 29.
I forgive thee thy sin, and the scripture ( John the first,) that Christ
only forgiueth and takes away the sins of the world, and Paul and Peter
and all the Apostles preaches, that all is forgiven in Christ, and for Christ's
sake. Gods word only loses, and thou in preaching that, might loose also,
and else not. T^m^ fo. 149.

How absolution stands not in the will of the Priest.
Gratian says, Voluntas sacerdotis: etc. The will of the priest can neither
further nor hinder: but the merit of him that desires absolution. Jewel. fol.
138.

ABSTINENCE.
What the abstinence of a Christian man is.
THe abstinence of a Christian man is to withdraw himself from sin. To. 4.
ve. 6 1. These. 4.^ ver. 3.
As it is said in Toby, how that he taught his son from his youth up to fear
God, and to refrain from sin, And S. Paul exhorts the Thessalonians from
fornication and other sins. Tindale.

What difference is between fasting and Abstinence.
True fasting is a religious work, ordained to testify our humility, and to
make the flesh the more obedient unto the spirit, that we may be the quicker
to pray, and to all good works But Abstinence from this or that meat with
opinion of holiness, supersticious it may easily make a man, but holy it
cannot. S. Paul says: It is not meat that makes us acceptable unto God. 1.
Cor. 8. ver. 8. Again, It is good to confirm the heart with grace, and not
with meats, wherein they that have walked, have found no profit. Heb. 13. Ver.
9. The meat serves for the belly, and the belly for the meat, the Lord
will destroy them both. 1. Cor. 6. ver. 13. And again, The kingdom of God is
not meat and drink. Romans 14. ver. 17. Likewise Christ says: The thing that
enters into the mouth defiles not the man. Man. 1^ ver. (...). Here it is
easy to see, that fasting is one thing, and abstinence from flesh another. The
Nazaries in the Testament absteined not from flesh, and yet they fasted. Elias
(3. Reg. 17. ver. 6.) was fed with flesh: John the Baptist, eat y^ flesh of
loc^stes, yet they both fasted. Socrates Socra. li. 5. cap. 12.
says, that many Christians in y^ Lent season, did eat fish and birds: Many
ab^^ained until. 3. of the clock in the afternoon, and then received all kind
of meats, either fish or flesh, without difference. Likewise Epiphanius says,
some eat all kind of birds or foul, absteining only from the flesh of four
footed beasts. And yet they kept their lent truly, and fasted as well as any
others. Wherefore abstinence from any one certain kind of meat, is not of it
self a work of religion to please God, but only a mere positive policy. S.
Austine says, Non quaero, etc. I demand not what thou eatest, but wherein
thou have pleasure. And Saint Hierome says of the Maniches, Ieiunant illi,
etc. They fast in deed, but their fasting is worse, then if they filled their
bellies, Jewel. fol. 15.

ABUSES.
By whom they ought to be reformed.
THe abuses that he in the Church, Romans 13. 3
ought to be corrected by Princes. Let every soul (says Saint Paul) submit
himself to the higher powers.

Hezekia destroyed the brazen Serpent, 4. Reg. 18. 4.
when he saw the children of Israel abuse it.

Iosaphat sent abroad his commission, 2. Par. 17. 7.
to suppress and banish all Idolatry and superstition out of his land.

Iosia cleansed his land from Idolatry, 4. Reg. 13^^ 4.
witchcraft, sorceries, and all other abuses.

Ioas destroyed the house of Baal, brake down the Altars, 2. Par. 32. 17.
and corrected many other abuses within his dominions.

By whom they ought to be rebuked.
The ministers ought to preach against abuses. Mat. 14. 4
John Baptist rebuked king Herod, for keeping his brother Philips wife.

S. Paul rebuked the Corinthians for having of sects among them, for one held
of Paul, an other held of Apollo, 1. Cor. 1^ 11.
some held of Peter and some of Cephas.

For suffering a fornicator among them, even such one as kept his fathers wife.
1. Cor. 5. (...)
For because they accused one an other before unlawful Judges, 1. Cor. 6. 5.
and not rather set an unity between brother and brother among themselves.

For because they sat with the Gentiles in their Tables, and did eat with them
of their sacrifices. 1. Cor. 8. 1.


For praieng in a tongue that men understood not.

And also because they doubted in the resurrection. 1. Cor. 15. 8 All manner of
mere traditions are abuses: 1. Cor. 1^. 19.
In vain do ye worship me (says Christ) teaching the traditions and
precepts of men. Mat. 15. 8. Esaie. 29. 13. Tindale.

ACHAB.
Of Satan's deceiving of Achab, how it is understood.
WHo is it (says God) that shall beguile me Achab? Satan prevented not God in
this case: neither came he before hand to say, If thou will give me leave to
beguile Achab, I will do whatsoever thou will have me to do, but God begins,
saying: where shall I find a lieng spirit to go and deceive Achab? for I see
he will needs be deceived even to the bottom of hell. And wherefore is it
that God speaks so? Even because the case stood upon executing of just
vengeance upon an hypocrite, a despiser full of cruelty, and a mortal enemy
of all goodness. Achab was a man that had perverted all Gods service utterly,
and was wholly defiled with his own Idols: and therewithal also is full of
sturdinesse and malice against the Prophets, and would give no ear to any
admonition. When he was thus hardened in his sins, in such sort that a man
could gain nothing by seeking to bring him into the right way: after that God
had assaide all ways, and saw he was a man forlorn, when he held his
assizes, and demanded who was he that would deceive Achab, for it was Gods
will to execute the office of a Judge. We see then, that when God means to
punish wicked folk, and to execute his wrath upon them according to their
deserts, he tarrieth not till he be moved to it by Satan, but preuenteth him,
etc. Calvin upon Job. fol. 220

ACCIDENT.
What an Accident is.
AN Accident is a thing, that may be or not be, without corruption of that
wherein it is. As for example: One may take away the whiteness of a wall,
yet the substance does still remain. Erasmus.

How an Accident is not without his subject.
In the Sacrament of the Altar (says he) after the consecration, there is
not, John P^rua^e.
neither can be any Accident without the subject, but there verily remains
the same substance, and the very visible and incoruptible bread, and likewise
the very same wine, the which before the consecration were set upon the Altar
to be consecrated by the Priest: likewise as when a Pagan or Infidel is
baptized, he is spirituallie converted into a member of Christ through grace,
and yet remains the very same man which before he was, in his proper nature
and substance. This was the opinion of John Puruaie, in the days of king
Henry the fourth. In the book of Mar. fol. 649.

ADAM.
How he was the first man that God created.
ADam was the first man that God created here in earth, Genesis 1. 2^.
after he had made both heaven and it, with all the ornaments and things
belonging unto them both. The first year of the world, and the year before
Christ (after the supputation that is set out in the end of the Bible of
Geneua) 3974. he lived. 930. years.

Of certain notable things done by Adam and Seth.
Josephus writes, that Adam and Seth made two columns or pillars, one of
Brass, the other of stone (for they foreseeing an extermination of all things
to be, one by the power of fire, the other by the violence and greatness of
the waters) graued therein, those things which they had invented with the
prophesies, by the which the word of God might be preserved, so that they
should remain as a perpetual monument to their successors, to declare what
had been done. He writes furthermore, they divided the year into. xij.
months, and first observed and taught the course of the celestial bodies,
for it is impossible that man's wit could attain to the understanding of so
high and difficult things, except God had showed the knowledge thereof. Lanquet.

Of the comparison the Apostle does make between Adam and Christ.
They also object unto us, that the Apostle compared Adam with Christ, and said
unto ye Romans, Romans 5. 17.
ye even as in Adam we all die, so in Christ we are all quickened. Wherefore by
this means they say, ye the grace of Christ ought universally to be laid
forth unto all men But if they will so take this comparison, they shall be
compelled to grant, ye all shall by Christ be brought to felicity, as by Adam
all thrown headlong into sin, and into death^ But seeing that the thing it
self declares the contrary, they may easily perceive that this similitude
is not to be taken as touching all the parts thereof, especially when as none
fall of their own consent, into original sin: but these men will not have
grace to be received, but through a man's own consent. Wherefore if they admit
this difference, how dare they affirm that the matter is on each side a like?
The scope of the Apostle in this comparison, is to be considered and beside the
scope, nothing is to be inferred. And in that comparison, Paul meant nothing
else, but that Christ is to those which are regenerate, the beginning of life
and blessedness: as Adam is to them that are derived of him, the cause of
death and of sin. Now whosoever is afterward beside this scope gathered
touching the equality of multitude or of the manner, the same is Per accidens,
that is by chance, and pertains not unto the scope and substance of the
similitude. Pet. Mar. fol. 305.

How Adam did eat Christ's body, and drink his blood.
As soon as Adam had transgressed the Lords precepts, ^en. 3. 6.
and was fallen under condemnation, our most merciful Father of his gracious
goodness, gave him the promise of health and comfort, whereby as many as
believed were saved, from the thraldom of their transgression. The word and
promise was this: I shall put enmity between thy seed and her seed, that
seed shall tread thoe on the head, and thou shall tread if on the heel. In
this promise they had knowledge that Christ should destroy the devil with all
his power, and deliver his faithful from their sins. And where he said that
the devil should tread it on the heel, they understood right well, that the
devil should find the means, by his wiles and wicked ministers, to put
Christ to death. And they knew that God was true, and would fulfill his
promise unto them, and heartily longed for this seed, and so did both eat his
body and drink his blood. Acknowledging with infinite thanks, that Christ
should for their sins take the perfect nature of manhood upon him, and also
suffer the death. This promise was given to Adam, and saved as many as did
believe and were thankful to God for his kindness. I. Frith. fol. 109.

Of the first Adam earthly, and the second heavenly.
The first man was of earth earthly, 3. Cor. 15.
and the second man the Lord himself from heaven. As concerning Adam, it has
no darkness in it at all. It is known how he is of the earth, and is called
earthly. But where as Christ the second Adam is said to be from heaven, that
is perverted by heretics. The true meaning of it is, that Christ and Adam are
alleged by the Apostle, as the two heads in mankind, to this intent that he
might express by them, the condition of our mortality and glorification. As
many as be of Adam be earthly, and bearing the Image of their parent, subject
unto death and corruption. And this all we be universally. On the other side,
the elect which be borne not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the
will of man, but of God, they be called here heavenly, albeit in flesh they
be of Adam: and of them it is reported, that they shall be such in the
resurrection, as the heavenly Christ is also. If the Val^ntinians, The opinion
of the Valentinians and Euthichia^s, confounded.
and the Euthichians do gather of this, the one sort, that the flesh of Christ
comes not of our flesh, the other sort, that it did not hold the true nature
of man: it follows, that the flesh of the elect persons also is of the very
same condition. For the Apostle says here not only that the second man
Christ is of heaven heavenly, but he adds that also manifestly saying: And
such as is the heavenly, such be they also that be heavenly. And because you
shall not refer it to Angels, in knitting up the matter he does conclude:
Therefore, like as we have borne the image of the earthly, so we shall bear
also the image of the heavenly. Wherefore it appears that the Apostle does
attribute this unto the faithful, because they do express in them both the
Images of Adam and of Christ, one of corruption and mortality, the other of
incorruption and immortality: So that in the former they do express the
earthly Adam in that they do die and be corrupted: In the latter they do
express the heavenly Adam, that is Christ, when they shall rise in the end of
the world, to glorifieng, immortality, and incorruption. This is the true and
right meaning of the Apostle, which cannot stand, unless we do grant, that
the flesh of Christ was taken of our flesh without sin, carried into heaven
to the glory of immortality, through the conjunction of the word, and the
power of God. Otherwise we can have no hope, that after the Image of the
earthly man, we shall be like unto the heavenly. Musculus. fol. 138.

How Adam was not deceived, but Eve.
And Adam was not deceived but the woman. The woman was first deceived, 1. Tim.
2. 14.
and so became the instrument of Satan to deceive the man. And though
therefore God punish them with subjection and pain in their travail, yet if
they be faithful and godly in their vocation, they shall be saved. Geneua.

How the sect of the Adamites sprang up.
The Adamites were a sect of heretics, which took their beginning of a
Pickard, who came into the land of Boheme, and said that he was the son of
God, and named himself Adam. And he commanded all men and women to go naked,
Adamites.
and that whosoever desired to company carnally with any woman, should take
her by the hand, and bring her to him and say, he fervently desired her
company, and then would Adam say: Go together and increase and multiply.
This heresy was begun in the year of our Lord. 1412. in the time of
Sigismonde the Emperor. And men suppose that it endures yet, not only in
Bohemia, but in other places also.

ADD.
What it is to Add or take away from the word of God.
TO Add or take away from the word of God, is this: To think otherwise, or
teach otherwise of God, then he has in his word reveled. They takt from ye
word, that believe less then in his word is expressed. Those add to the word:
first, which teach or decree any thing, either in matters of faith or
ceremonies contrary to the word. Secondly, such as make any religion or
opinion of merits in any thing that they themselves have invented, beside the
word of God. Last of all, they do add to the word, which forbid that for a
thing of it self unlawful, which Gods word does not forbid: and to make that
sin, which Gods word does not make sin.

If any man shall add unto these things, etc. The effect is, Apoc. 22. 18.
that men must neither put any thing to, nor take any thing away from the
Scripture ^ according as it is said in an other place. All the saiengs of God
are as it were cleansed with fire, they are a shield to them that trust in
them, put not any thing to the words thereof, least he perchance do reprove
thee, and thou be found a liar. Pro. 30. 5. 6. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 317.

They (says Gasper Megander) be said to add to the Scripture, which
counterfeit it and mar it, and make a cloak of it for their leasings and
errors, of which sort be the heretics and deceivers, etc. Marl. upon the
Apoc. fol. 317.

ADOPTION.
How the Lawiers define adoption.
THE Lawiers, as it is had in the institutions, define Adoption to be a
legitimate an imitating nature, found out for their solace and comfort, which
have no children. Further, they make a distinction, between Adoption and
Arrogation. For Arrogation they say is, when he which is his own man, and at
liberty, is received in steed of a son. But Adoption is, when he which is
received, is under an other man's power. Howbeit, the laws forbid, that the
elder should be adopted of the younger: for it seems a thing monstrous, that
the son should erreed the father in years. And therefore Cicero oftentimes
vehemently inueigheth against that Adoption of Clodius. Now, God adopteth unto
himself his elect, not for that he had not an other son (for he had his
only begotten son Christ in whom he was well pleased) but for that in all
the nature of man, he had yet no children, for through Adam we were all made
strangers unto him. Wherefore God for this cause, sent his natural and
legitimate son into the world, that by him, he might adopt unto himself,
many children out of our kind, etc. Pet. Mar. fol. 205.

We have received the spirit of Adoption, says S. Paul. Adoption is the
inheritance promised by grace. Tindale.

So he means the holy Ghost of the effect, which he causes in us, Rom 8. 15.
when he proposes us salvation by the law, with an impossible condition, who
also does seal our salvation in our hearts by Christ's free adoption, that we
consider not God now as a rigorous Lord, but as a most merciful father. Gal.
4. 5. Geneua. Into ye Adoption of children. Whereas we were not ye natural
children, he received us by grace, and made us his children. Geneua. Ephe. 1. 5.


Men do call children adopted, those which be not natural children to them
which do choose and accept them for their children: but they are it only by
the love and favor of him which takes them for his children, and gives them
such right, as he might give to his natural children. The like is with us
toward God, seeing ye of nature we were ye children of wrath, it does then
follow we be not Gods natural children, but that he makes us his children,
and counts us for such, by his only grace, which he shows us, because of
the love wherewith he has loved us in his well-beloved son Jesus Christ,
without any of our deserts, but wholly the contrary. Viret.

The same spirit bears witness with our spirit. Romans 8. 16.
Whereas the Apostle says, bears witness together, he signifies after a
sort that there are two testimonies of this adoption. The one is our spirit,
and the other the spirit of God. For it is no small or light sign of this
Adoption, Two testimonies of our adoption.
that we have a quiet conscience, and that we do believe, that we are now
reconciled unto God: and do now feel, that we are refreshed and recreated
with many other good gifts. Although these things are not sufficient for our
incredulity and infirmity. For there is none of us which has his conscience
so quiet, as we ought to have: and which puts so much confidence in God, as
we ought to do. Wherefore seeing the testimony of our spirit is weak and
infirm, God would put to a confirmation of his spirit. For he it is which
testifies together with our spirit, that we are the sons of God. Pet. Mar.
upon the Romans fol. 208.

ADORATION.
Look. Worship.

ADVLTERIE.
What a damnable sin Adultery is before God.
Adultery is a damnable thing in the sight of God, and much mischief
follows thereof. David to save his honor was driven to commit grievous
murder also. It is unright in the sight of God and man, that thy child should
be at another man's cost, and be another man's heir. Neither can thou nor thy
mother have lightly a quiet conscience to God, or a merry heart, as long as it
is so. Moreover what greater shame can thou do to thy neighbor, or what
greater displeasure? What if it be never known, or come any child thereof?
The precioust gift that a man has in this world of God, is the true heart of
his wife, to abide by him in wealth and woe, and to bear all infirmities with
him. Of that have thou robbed him: for after she has once coupled her self
with thee, she shall not lightly love him any more so truly, but happily
hate him and procure his death. Moreover, thou have untaught her to fear God,
and have made her to sin against God. For unto God promised she, and not to
man only. For the law of matrimony is Gods ordinance. For it is written.
Genesis 29. when P^tiphars wife would have Joseph to lie with her, he answered,
how could I do this wickedness and sin against God: yea, verily it is
impossible to sin against man, except thou sin against God. Finally, read
chronicles and stories, and see what has followed adultery. Tindale. fol. 205.

God plagued both Pharao and Abimelech with all their housholdes, Genesis 12. 20.
for taking of Abraham's wife from him, although they never committed any evil
with her.

The Leuits wife was sore plagued, Gen 19.
for plaieng the whore with the Sodomites.

David for committing of adultery with Bethsabe the wife of Vrias, 2. Reg. 12.
was sore plagued with pestilence.

The two Judges that would have defiled Susanna, Dan. 13.
were both put to death.

Herod for keeping his brother Philips wife, Mat. 14.
was rebuk^d to John Baptist, and afterward (as stories says) sore punished of
God.

Adultery brings a man to deffamation, beggerie, Pro. 6.
and utter destruction.

How the adulterer repenting is forgiven.
It is sufficient for the same man that he was rebuked of many, etc. We must
beware that we do not use too much rigor in the ecclesiastical discipline.
For that should be to turn that most comfortable salve and wholesome physic
unto poison: we ought to excommunicate to this end, that the open sinner may
acknowledge his sin and repent. And so be reconciled again, and that by
times, least Satan do get his pray, and drive the poor miserable man thus
banished from the congregation, to utter dispairing. It is said that the Church
forgiueth, when either it does comfort them that are troubled in conscience, or
receives the repentaunt into favor again. Sir I. Cheek.

How this adulterer or fornicator, was first delivered to Satan.
Look Satan.

ADVOCATE.
How there is no mo advocates between God and man, but Jesus Christ.
In all the whole Bible is not this word Advocate found: but only in the
first Epistle to Saint John, the second Chapter, in the which place it is said,
that Christ is our advocate to the Father. Tindale.

Babes, if any man do sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous.

Saint Austine upon the place of Saint John, says: John drank the secrets of
hid mysteries, out of the Lords breast. He (for all he was such a man) says
not you have an advocate with the Father, but we have an advocate. He said not
you have me, nor you have Christ, but he put in Christ and not himself: and he
said, we have, and not you have. He rather put himself in the number of
sinners to have Christ his advocate, then put himself an advocate in Christ's
steed, and be found among the proud damned. Brethren, we have Jesus Christ the
righteous an advocate with the Father, he is the mercy seat of our sins. He
that has holden this, has done no heresy: he that has holden this, has
done no scisme nor sedition.

Christ is our only advocate and atonement, for the office of intercession
and redemption are joined together. Geneua.

Look more in Mediator.

AFFLICTION.
How and by whom our afflictions are measured unto us.
LIke as when a Physician gives his patient such quantity as he thinks
good, the patient must be feign to receive the drink in such portion as the
Physician shall have appointed: or like as a Father in cherishing his children,
cutteth every of them their pitaunce, and gives them to eat and drink after
his own pleasure: even so must God dispose of us, and have the authority over
us, to charge us, and to give us such portion of miseries, as he shall think
good, etc. Calvin upon Job. fol. 100.

The difference between the afflictions of the godly, and ungodly.
As many as I love I rebuke and chasten. Apoc. 3. 19
To chastise (says Gasper Megander) is to correct one to his behoose. And
therefore here is to be noted the difference between the afflictions of the
godly and the ungodly, for the godly are afflictted to their own profit,
namely, that they may be nurtured to patience, and hold fast in the fear of
the Lord, according as you may see in Job. 5. 17. lere. 31. 18. and. 47. 28.
Pro. 3. 11. Heb. 12. 6. But the correction of the ungodly is called a
consuming of them. Jeremy. 30. 23. 24. and 46. 10. And therefore the chosen
do amend at the Lords chatisement, as did David. 3. Reg. 12. 13. but the
reprobates are hardened the more by Gods scourge, as Pharao was. Exo. 9. 7. 35.
Marlo. upon the Apo. fol. 69.

Why the just be afflicted.
There are two principal causes, why God does yield the just men to be
punished of the ungodly and unjust. The one is for their exercise, the other
for a special example. For exercise, that they may thereby, be trained, in
faith, hope prayer, and praise of his name. Such a matter Paul expressed,
saying: We will not have you ignorant brethren of our trouble which betided us
in Asia, 2. Cor. 1. 8.
etc. The other is: the elect and godly persons be made examples of faith and
patience, when they do with constant faith and sufferaunce, bear the
struglings of their afflictions in this world, and so do shine as bright as
stars in the Church of the faithful, etc. Musculus fol. 511.

How our afflictions suffered for the truth, shall be witnesses against our
enemies.
And this shall turn to you for a testimonial. This shall be the end of your
troubles and afflictions. Luk 21. 1^
They shall be witness both before God and man, as well of the treacherous and
cruel dealing of your enemies, as also of your constancy: A notable saying,
that the afflictions of the godly and holy men, perteine to the witness of
the truth. Beza.

This their sufferance shall both be a great confirmation of the Gospel, and
also by their constancy, the tyranny of their enemies, shall at length be
manifest before God and man. Chapter. 12. 12. Matthew. 10. 19. Mark. 13. 11.
Geneua.

How afflictions are called light things.
For our light afflictions, which is but for a moment. Afflictions are not
called light, as though they were light of themselves, 2. Cor. 4. 17.
but because they pass away quickly, when as indeed our whole life is of no
great continuance. Beza.

Light afflictions, which is so called, in respect of the everlasting life.
Geneua.

How the rest of Christ's afflictions are fulfilled.
And fulfill the rest of Christ's afflictions, etc. Col. 1. 24.
The afflictions of the Church are said to be Christ's afflictions, by reason
of that fellowshippe and knitting together, that the body and the head have
the one with the other, not that there is any more need to have the Church
redeemed, but that Christ shows his power, in the daily weakness of his,
and that for the comfort of the whole body.

As Christ has once suffered in himself to redeem his Church, and to
sanctify it, so does he daily suffer in his members, as partakers of their
infirmities, and therefore a revenger of their injuries. Geneua.

Look passion.

AGAINST.
Who is against Christ, and who not.
Whosoever is not against us, Mar. 9. 40
is on our side. He that does not withstand the Gospel, nor let the preaching
of it, but rather does favor it, and wills it to be set forth, suffering
himself to be taught and rebuked by it, though that he do not follow Christ
in all things, yet ought we not to count him for an enemy, but much rather
for a friend. Christ says in the. 12. Chapter of Matthew. He that is not with
me, is against me, but that saying is nothing contrary to this, where he
says: He that is not against us, is with us. For in the twelfe of Matthew, he
speaks of open blasphemies and haters of the truth. Sir I. Cheek.

Although he show not himself to be mine, yet in that he bears reverence to
my name, it is enough for us. Geneua.

He that is not with me, is against me. Mat. 12. 30.
He declares to the Pharesies, that they were in two sorts his enemies, not
only because they did forsake him, but also make open war against him. Geneua.

AGONY.
Why Christ was in such an agony.
BUT being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly. Luke 22. 44.
This agony shows that Christ strove much, and was in great distress: for
Christ strove not only with the fear of death as other men use to do, for
so many martyrs might seem more constant then Christ, but with the fearful
judgment of his angry Father, which is the fearefullest thing in the world:
and the matter was, for that he took the burden of all our sins upon
himself. Beza.

The word signifies, the honor that Christ had received, not only for fear
of death, but of his Fathers judgment and wrath against sin. Geneua.

AGRIPPA.
For what cause Agrippa was so willing to hear Paul.
I Would also hear the man my self. Act. 25. 22
Agrippa will hear Paul, not for to learn the truth, whereof he was nothing
desirous, but that he might hear some new thing, being in this matter like
unto many which now a days go to sermons, not to learn how to amend their
lives, but to hear news. Sir I. Cheek.

Agrippa said unto Paul, somewhat thou perswadest me to be a Christian. Act.
26. 28
He saw a little light, but it was soon out, much like unto those that
hearing a Sermon, are for the time well minded, but after return to their old
trade. The Bible note.

ALABASTER.
What the property of Alabaster is.
Saving an Alabaster bore. Mat. 26. 7.
This was a very fine and delicate box, being made of Alabaster, which was a
kind of glass, very necessary to preserve ointment in: it was so called of
the Grecians, and of taking the primative A, because for the smoothness
thereof it could not be held. Pl^ie in his 36. book, and viij. Chapter, makes
mention of the Alabaster stone. For when he had spolien in the. 35. Chapter of
the Onix stone, he goes forward thus: Some men (says he) call this the
Alabaster stone, the which they make holowe to put in ointment: because it is
said to preserve the same very well. These things agree with that which Homere
writes, saying, the little Onir will draw unto it, a pipe of the Oil
Spiknard or Nardus ointment. Marl. upon Matthew. fol. 620.

ALBANENSES.
The opinions that these hereti^es held.
THis sect began about the year of our Lord. 1120. which held sundry
heresies. One was that the soul of man after his death, was put into an other
body. An other, that Baptism was of no efficacy. The third, that there were
two Gods, one good and an other evil. And that of the good God proceeded good
things, and of the evil God evil things. The fourth, that in hell were none
other pains, then be in this world. The fifth, that the general judgment is
past, and that there is none to come. The sixth, that it is not lawful for any
man to swear. The seventh, that a man has no freewil, called in latin,
Liberum arbitrium. The eight, that the matter whereof the world was made, was
not made of God, but is coeternall with God. The ninth, that there is no
original sin. Also that sin conuneth not of free will, but of the devil.
The tenth, they denied that the body should eftsoons arise at the day of
judgment. The eleventh, they abiected all the old Testament, as a vain
thing, and of no authority. Eliote.

ALBIGENSES.
The opinion of these heretics.
THese were heretics which began by Tolonce in France, the year of our Lord.
120. which held the heresies of the Albanenses, touching the soul of man,
that after death the soul was put into an other body. And that Baptism was
of none effect. And that there was two Gods, the one good, and the other evil.
And that the general judgment was past And beside that, they said it was not
lawful for a Christian man to eat flesh. Eliote.

ALLEGORY.
What the nature of an Allegory is.
AN Allegory is that which is, one in words, and an other in sentence and
meaning.

It is as much to say, as strange speaking or borrowed speech, as when we
say of a wanton child: This Sheep has maggattes in his tail, he must be
anointed with Byrchin salve, which speech I borrowe of the Shepherd, etc.
Tindale.

An Allegory is, when the words are not transferred from the proper
signification, but sound one thing, and covertly show forth an other thing:
as when it is said, that pearls are not to be given to Swine: here every
word keeps still his proper signification, and in them is taught that the
precious doctrine of God ought not to be set forth unto impudent and
obstinate men, etc. Pet. Mart. upon the Romans. fol. 327.

What the true use of an Allegory is.
First, Allegories prove nothing (And by Allegories understand examples or
similitudes borrowed of strange matters, and of an other thing, then that thou
intreatest off) And though circumcision be a figure of Baptism, yet thou can
not prove Baptism by circumcision. For this argument were feeble. The
Israelites were circumcised, therefore we must be baptized. And in like
manner, though the offering of Isaac were a figure or example of the
resurrection, yet is this argument naught: Abraham would have offered up Isaac,
but God delivered him from death, therefore we shall rise again, and so of
all other. But the very use of Allegories is, to declare and open a text, that
it may be the better perceived and understood. As when I have a clear text
of Christ and of his Apostles, that I must be baptized, then I may borrowe an
example of circumcision, to express the nature, power, and fruit, or effect
of Baptism. For as circumcision was unto them a common badge, signifieng, that
they were all soldiers of God to war his war, and seperating them from all
other nations disobedient unto God: Even so Baptism is our common badge, and
sure earnest, and perpetual memorial, that we perteine unto Christ, and are
separated from all that are not Christ's.

And as circumcision was a token, certefieng them that they were received unto
the favor of GOD, and their sins forgiven them: Even so Baptism certifieth
us that we are washed in the blood of Christ, and received to favor for his
sake. And as circumcision signified unto them the cutting away of their own
lusts, and slaieng of their freewill (as they call it) to follow the will of
God: even so Baptism signifies unto us repentance, and the mortification of
our unruly members and bodies of sin, to walk in a new life, and so
forth. Tindale. fol. 15.

Of two kind of Allegories.
There are two kinds of Allegories. For some are set forth unto us by holy
Scripture: as Christ is Jonas, who was in the heart of the earth three days,
as he was in the belly of the Whale. Again, that he is Solomon, or the
serpent hanged up in the desert, or the Lamb: And that the two sons of
Abraham, are two testaments. Those I say, for as much as they are found in the
holy Scriptures, may in no wise be rejected, but are firm places, whereby
when need requires may be proved doctrines. There are other allegories,
which men through their own judgment and reason find out, whom indeed we
confess, that they may follow their own fantasy, so that they beware of
two things. First that they devise nothing, that is repugnaunt to sound
doctrine: Secondly, that they obtrude not those their devises, as natural and
proper senses of the holy Scripture. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 345.

ALL.
How this word All is taken.
AND all the cattle of Aegipt died. This word all is not taken here for
every one, but a great number, Exo. 9. 6
or of all sorts of cattle some as. 1. Tim. 2. 1. T. M.

How this place (God will have all men saved) is understood.
God will have all men saved. 1. Tim 2. 4.
That is, will have the Gospel preached to all men, without exception, and
offer to all men repentance, and will have all men prayed for. Tindale.

The meaning of this foresaid text is, that God has chosen of every estate,
condition, order or degree of men, whom he will have to be saved, and to come
to the knowledge of the truth. Whereby we do learn, that God does as well
choose the king as the subject, and as well the subject as the king, as well
the rich as the poor, and as well the poor as the rich. And that there is no
estate or condition of life, out of the which he will not have some to be
saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. I. Veron.

Here we learn that God refuses no nation, whether they be Jews or Heathen.
Also that he refuses no estate, whether they be poor or rich, king or
subject, it is all one to him, he has no respect of persons, but will have his
Gospel to be preached unto al nations and estates, that such as be
preordinated unto life, may come to the knowledge of the truth. Sir. I. Cheek.

We take it to be spoken of all estates and kinds of men, namely that God
will have some of all kind of men to be saved, which interpretation agrees
excellently well with the purpose of the Apostle. He had commanded that
prayers and supplications should be made for all men, and especially for kings,
and those which have public authority, that under them we may live a quiet
life in all piety and chastity. And therefore to declare that no estate or
kind of men is excluded, he added, That God will have all men saved. As if he
should have said, no man is let by that vocation and degree wherein he is
placed, so that it be not repugnaunt to the word of God, but that he may come
to salvation, and therefore we ought to pray for all kind of men. But hereof
we cannot inserre that God endueth every man with grace, or predestinateth
every man to salvation: as in the time of the floude all living creatures are
said to have been saved in the Arc with Noe, for that only some of every
kind were gathered together in it. Or we may understand it thus, that God
will have all men to be saved, for that as many as are saved, are saved by his
will. As if a man should say of one that teaches Rhetoric in a city, that
he teaches all men. By which kind of speech is not signified, that all the
citizens are learners of Rhetoric, but as many as learn, are taught of him.
And this also is like. If a man pointing to the gate of an house should say,
that all men enter in this way, we must not thereby understand, that all men
enter into that house, but as many as do enter, do enter in by that gate
only. etc. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 306.

Objection.
If God (say they) would have all men saved, how can that stand firm and
steadfast, that he has chosen some only to save, and refused the rest.

Answer.
To this Saint Augustine says thus: which would have all men saved, not that
there should be no man, whom he would not have saved. Which would do no virtue
of miracles amongst them which he said would have done penance, if he had
done them, but we should understand by all men, all sorts of men, distributed
in certain differences, kings, private persons, noble and base, high and low,
etc. And a little after: for the Apostle commanded that they should pray for
all men, and specially he added for kings, and them that were in high estate,
which might have been thought to refrain from the baseness of the christian
faith, for a loftiness of courage, and a worldly pride. Therefore when he
said, This is good before God our savior, that is to say, that we should
pray also for such, he did add by and by to take away desperation, Which
would all men to be saved. In another place he says thus: But as that which is
said, All shall be restored to life in Christ, whereas for all that many are
condemned to eternal death, it is said therefore, because that all, as many
as do enioie everlasting life, do not enioie it but in Christ: so the same
that is spoken, God will have all men saved, whereas he wills not to have so
many saved, it is spoken therefore, because that they which be saved, are not
saved but as he wills. And in case these words of the Apostle may be any
otherwise understood, so that for all that they may not be contrary to this
most manifest truth, wherein we do see so many not saved, where as men
would, and God wills not. This says Augustine. Whereby we do see that the
words of the Apostle are not so to be taken, that of all men God has refused
none, but that he would have no sort of men shut out from his salvation and
knowledge of the truth, etc. Musculas. fol. 214.

The meaning of this place following
All things are yours. 1. Co. 3. 22
This place of S. Paul, Athanasius that ancient writer expounds on this
wise: All things are yours, only for that God has subject all things unto
you, and has ordained all things to serve your commodity and pleasure, you
are Christ's through your creation and servitude: Christ is Gods, because he was
before the world with the father, and was of the same essence and substance
that God the father was of, etc. I. P.

ALMS.
What alms signifies.
THis word Alms, imports as much as mercy. Now we see that among other
titles, God challenges this unto himself, that he is gentle and merciful.
Then can we not be his children, neither will he acknowledge us for such,
except we labor to follow his example in this behalf: namely to be moved to
pity when we see any poor folk in adversity, and to go about to provide
for them, every of us according to his ability. True it is, that we may give
all our substance, and yet our doing shall not be counted a virtue. For before
the hand be opened to give, it behooves the heart to be touched with
compassion: but if we have pity of those which are in adversity, it behou^th
us also to succor them to our power. For (as ^^^ames says) If I say to a
poor man, my friend God help thee, thereby I show that I have no love in me.
If I say, it is great pity of this man, and yet in the mean while labor not
to succor him whom I ought to relieve it is a mockery, and I am but an
hypocrite. That is to say, I see there how God shows me a pitiful case, and
it is as much, as if God gave me occasion to emploie my self, and thereby I
see that he calls me, and yet in the mean time, I make no countenance of it
at all. If there were but one drop of kindness in me, would I not endeavor to
help such a necessity for my part. So then we have to bear in mind in this
text, that the holy ghost exhorts us to alms deeds, and that the same
consists in two points, that is to say, in being pitiful toward our
neighbors when we see the^ in adversity,and also, when we have such pitiful
affection, as we seek the means to succor them, and every man straineth
himself to his power. True it is that we cannot stead all the necessities that
we see And therefore a christian man may well mourn in his heart, without
putting his hand to his pursse. For it is impossible (even for them that be
best minded) to help at all times. And therefore this pitifulnes shall suffice
them, and God accepts it for an Alms deed, as if the poor were norished,
and fed by them. And when they have this compassion upon a poor man, it is as
great a Sacrifice unto God, as if he had given and dealt dole out of a full
pursse, etc. Calvin upon Job. fol. 535.

Alms deeds properly is mercifulness, notwithstanding use and custom has
brought to pass that alms is called a gift, that of compassion and mercy is
given unto him that needs. But in that diversity, there lies no weight nor
force, whether thou read righteousness or alms, because it is manifest
enough, that by them both, the vice of ambition is reproved, which in doing
well, looks to have praise of men, as did the Scribes and Phariseies, of whom
Christ speaks thus: All that they do is to be seen of men. He forbids
not here to do well in the sight of men, but that we should not do it to
this end, to be commended of them. For otherwise it is lawful for us to give
our alms publikelie, so that our mind have respect unto God, and brotherly
love to men and the praise of men. Mar. fol. 112.

An exposition of this place following.
Give alms, Luke 11. 41.
and all things are clean unto you. These words may be expounded three manner
of ways. The first way is, to say that that kind of speech was any Ironie,
as if Christ should have said to the Phariseies: ye give alms, and ye think^
straight y^ all things are clean unto you, which is not so, for we ought first
to make clean those things which are within. An other way is, which Augustine
follows in his Enchiridion to Laurentius: certain had persuaded themselves,
that if they gave alms they should be saved, though they ceased not from
sinning, and their chiefest anchor hold, was these words of Christ. Augustine
answers, that those words of Christ, are to be understood of the true and
approved alms: of which it is written in Eccl^. the. 30. Chapter: Have
compassion of thy soul, and please God. Wherefore thou ought to begin true
alms at thine own self: that having compassion on thy self, thou may be
converted unto God, and cease of from sins, and afterward have compassion on
others. And the third way is this, which in my judgment more agrees unto the
purpose: Christ being at dinner with the Phariseies, he began to eat with
unwashed hands: for which thing when they were offended, Christ began to
reprove their ignorance, which would have their dishes, hands and all
outward things made clean and beautiful, but as touching that which they had
inward, that is, in their mind, they were nothing careful. Wherefore he first
exhorted them to purify the heart which is inwardly, which thing is done by
faith: for in the Acts it is written, By faith purifieng their hearts.
Afterward as touching outward things he adds: Give alms, and so all things
shall be clean unto you, etc. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans 383.

What thing we ought to take heed unto in giving our alms.
Take heed to your alms, Mat. 6. 1.
etc. That our alms may be acceptable unto God, three things are required:
First, that we give with a ioifull heart, for he loves him that gives
cheerefullie. Secondly, that we give liberally, 2. Cor 9^ 7
putting aside niggardship, for he that sows little shall reap little, and he
that sows plentifully shall reap plentiouslie. 2. Cor. 9. 6
Let every man do according as he is able. The poor woman that did offer but
two mites, Mar. 12. 42
did highly please God. Thirdly that we give without hypocrisy and
ostentation, not seeking the praise of men, nor our own glory. Cheek.

What profit comes by alms giving.
If we give alms, we shall provoke men, to give immortal thanks unto God, so
that by our alms, two profits shall ensue and follow. First, our poor
brethren shall be succored and helped: secondly, God the Author of all
goodness shall be (through the same liberality that he has stirred up in us)
be praised and lauded, which thing all Christians ought to seek. Read 2. Cor.
9. 12.

Of the alms sent to the Saints at Jerusalem.
It is not my mind, 1. Cor. 8. 13.
that other be set at ease, and ye brought into combrance, but that there be
equalness now at this time, etc. Liberality ought to be moderated, that they
which do give, be in no wise thereby, brought to extreme penury and poverty,
the other unto whom it is given in the mean season living at ease and in
idleness. This is the equalness that S. Paul speaks of here. The
Corinthians had riches, and the Saints of Jerusalem had wholesome doctrine
coupled with godliness (at that time there was great dearth in Jerusalem, and
in all Syria) This is then the meaning of the Apostle: I will that with your
riches (whereof ye have great plenty and abundance) ye succor their need, and
that they, with their godly doctrine, do supply that which is wanting in you.
Sir. I. Cheek.

The meaning of this place following.
Sell that ye have, and give alms. Luke 12. 33.
This is the figure Metonymia. For by this word Alms is meant that compassion
and friendlinesse of an heart, that tendereth the misery and poor estate of a
man, and shows forth it self by some gift, and has the name given it of the
Greek tongue, of mercy and compassion. And therefore he is said to give
Alms, who parts with some thing to another, and gives to the poor, showing
thereby, that he pitieth their poor estate. Beza.

Of the alms that Atticus Bishop of Constantinople sent.
Atticus Atticus.
unto Calliopius (Minister of Nice) sends greeting in the Lord. I am given to
understand, that there is an infinite number in your city ready to perish
with famine, and stand in need of the alms and charity of godly and well
disposed persons. Where I write an infinite number, I mean a great multitude,
the certain number whereof, I do not readelie know. Therefore seeing I have
received moneie of him which bestows abundance and plenty of riches upon
them which use it aright: seeing also daily experience teaches us that some
do want to the end, that such as be rich, wealthy, and minister not unto
them, may thoroughly be tried: my will is (well-beloved brother) that thou
receive of me these three hundred pieces of gold, and distribute them at thy
discretion among the poor people of thy parish, see thou deal the same, not
among such as respect only the belly and make a living or trade throughout
their life time of begging, but among such as are ashamed to beg. Neither
would I have thee herein to respect any opinion or sect whatsoever, neither
to prejudice them which practice in doctrine a contrary faith unto us, but
only to have consideration of this, that thou relieve them which hunger and
thirst, and have not wherewithal to help himself. Eusebius. fol. 391.

What manner of heretics they were.
THese men denied that the son of God was Logos, Here^ikes
which some do interpret in Latin Verbum, some Sermo. And therefore they

not his words. But that Cerinthus the heretic wrote the Revelation. Eliote.

ALMVTH LABEN.
What this word signifies.
IT signifies (as some think) a certain instrument of Music. Some say,
Psalm. 9.
that Almuth signifies of the death, which some understand by Laben Goliath or
some other Philistine. Some read the Title thus: A vehement and often made
exhortation of a secret or foolish son: they understood thereby, the
righteous, which by faith is the son of God, and the same is to the world
foolish, because he is continually in death and secrets, for his life is hid
in Christ till the hid things be showed. Again, in the judgment of God, then
shall it appear, that the death of this world is glory. Felix reads the
title thus, unto the victor or ouercommer of the death of a fool, which ye
may well understand of the death of foolish Antichrist, and of the ruin of
his kingdom: howbeit this title should seem more convenient, for the which
after the Hebrews is a distinct Psalm from this, whereas the Latinists make
this and the next both one.

ALTAR.
What an Altar is, and how they began.
AN Altar is nothing else, but a thing builded to offer Sacrifices on. Altar is
a Latin word, which is so named as the Gramarians do say, of Altitudo or
height. Not that an Altar is so great and high, but because the Romans before
the receiving of the true religion of Christ, they made Altars, in three
sundry places. Some they called Altaria, upon the which they did offer
Sacrifices unto the supernall Gods. Other Altars they had which were made
beneath upon the plain ground, upon the which they did Sacrifice unto the
Gods on the earth. And other Altars they made under the earth, (as were in
Poules,) upon the which they did offer Sacrifice, Dijs infernalibus, unto Gods
under the ground. And these two last kind were called Ara or A^e, but the high
Altars were properly called Altaria.

Thus much concerning the name of the Latin word Altar. In all the new
Testament where we read this Latin word Altar, as in the 5. of S. Matthew, the
first of S. Luke, 1. Cor. 9. and the 13. of the Hebrews. In all these places
in the Greek book is red (...). Which word is as much to say in English, as
a Sacrificing place, or a thing made to offer sacrifices on, which is more
plain then the Latin word Altar is So that an Altar is nothing else but a
sacrificing place, or a thing made to offer sacrifices on. When Noe was
preserved from the general Deluge, with his wife and his three sons and their
wives and restored again by the tender mercy of God to dry land, he made an
Altar unto the Lord, and offered all manner of clean beasts and fowls thereon
for a sacrifice, with whose doings the Lord was well pleased, because he did it
in the faith of Christ, which was figured by the Altar, and promised never to
drown the world any more for man's wickedness, etc. Upon the same faith did
Abraham, the father of all faithful believers, make an Altar unto the Lord,
what time as God promised unto him, that in his seed (which was Christ) should
all the nations of the earth be blessed. Likewise God commanded ^acob to build
an Altar at Bethel, in the remembrance that he had delivered him, from the
hands and cruelty of his brother Esau. Thus in the law of nature Altars
began. But chiefelie they did flourish, after the law of the ten commandments
were given by Moses. We read that God warned Moses to keep the people from
making of Gods of gold or of silver, and to keep them the better from it, thou
shall (said he) cause them to make an Altar not of gold nor silver, but make up
a little heap of earth, and thereupon do thou offer the burnt-offerings, and
the peace offerings. And if the people be desirous to build an Altar of stone,
thou shale not suffer it to be made of hewn stone, but of rough stone, after
the rudest fashion, that the people take not a superstitious conceit, reposing
a confidence in the Altar it self, and not in the thing that is signified by
the Altar, which is Christ. Yet all this while, there were no perfect form n^r
fashion of Altars, till the Tabernacle of the tastimonies was made. When that
was once made, then Altars grew^ to their perfection. For then God commanded to
make two Altars for the Tabernacle, the one was called the Altar of incense,
which Altar was made of Sethim wood, and above covered over with fine gold. The
other Altar was made also of Sethim wood, but above, it was covered over only
with Brass, and therefore sometimes it is called the brazen Altar.

This Altar was properly called the Altar of burnt-offerings, upon this Altar
was offered every day two Lambs, one in the morning, and the other at night,
beside an innumerable sort of other Leuiticall Sacrifices. Now mark, in these
two Altars, ye must consider, that it was a part of the Ceremonial Law of
Moses, all which Law was but a figure; and a shadow of Christ the true light
it self. As the Apostle says: The Ceremonial law was but a shadow of good
things, that were then to come, and given by Christ. But now h^er^ may be
thought: seeing that Altars were used from the beginning of the world: First in
the law of Nature, second in the law written, by commandment given by Moses
the man of God, thirdly frequented and used in Christ's Church, since the
beginning and used to this day in most places of Chris^endome, how is it then
that the Church of England has taken them away. To this I answer, that
wheresoever Altars be used, (whether in England or in any other places of
Christendom) they be an occasion of great Idolatry, and blaspheming of
Christ's blood, and merits of his bitter passion. For whereas by Christ's one
Sacrifice offered upon the Altar of the Cross, we are all made clean, and
inheritours of the kingdom of heaven: our Altars did teach us, that he was
offered up there a new every day for our redemption by the work of a
priest, which is most fal^e and untrue, and most blasphemous and injurious to
Christ's merits and sacrifice offered once for all. And to the end to pluck out
this blasphemous opinion out of the simple peoples heads, it ought to be judged
of all the Kings people, as good a deed of the King and his Counsel to beat
down and destroy the Altars in England, as that King Ezechias did, when he
brake and brent the brazen Serpent, that Moses by the commandment of God did
make, because the people did worship it, and so committed Idolatry. Though
that Altars were well accepted at the hands of Noe, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
also commanded during the time of Moses Law, yet ye must understand, that
that Law is now abrogated, and utterly repelled. The whole Law given by God
to Moses for the people of Israel, was divided into three fortes: laws moral,
which is the law of the ten commandments, laws Judicial or Civil laws,
which we in the realm of England call temporal laws: The third kind of
laws were Ceremonial laws. The law of the ten Commandments do stand in
their first strength. But the other two, the law Judicial, and the laws
ceremonial, are quite abolished and of no strength. Since that Christ has
suffered his passion for our redemption. And where as no nation under y^ Sun
were so laden with Ceremonies as the Jews were. God did it for two purposes.
One was to keep the people from the idolatricall inventions of their own
hands and of their own heads. The other was, with pretty figures and shadows
to induce the gross and stifnecked people, to inbrace and believe the mysteries
of Christ's incarnation, passion, and resurrection, which mystery was
principally figured and set out by their shadows and figures of the law.
So that there was not a ceremony, but it was a figure of Christ or his
Apostles, or else of his mystical body the Church: all which Ceremonies and
figures, after that Christ had once suffered, which was figured by them, they
were all banished away out of Christ's Church, because there was no use for
them. For like as when it is dark, the light of a candle is good, but when the
night is past, and the day is come, why should we occupy any longer a candle.
Even so, when Christ was come, and had suffered, which was the end of the law,
what should we do with the Ceremonies and figures of Christ, but utterly to
cast them away as a burden, not only necessary, but also as Saint Peter
says importable. And now being delivered from the severity of the Judicial
Laws. And multitude of the Ceremonial Laws, he that goes about to retain
any one or part of them, to him may well be spoken the words of Saint Paul:
If ye will needs be circumcised, Christ does profit you nothing. For he that
is circumcised is bound to keep the whole Law: so they that will have Altars
to stand by the force of Moses law, they must by the same reason, have all the
whole Tabernacle to stand, with the furniture thereof, which is a falling away
from Christ. Ric^ Tu^nar.

We have an Altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve in the
Tabernacle. Heb. 13. 10


Habemus Altar, We have an Altar, is as much to say, as Habemus Sacrifi^ium,
We have a Sacrifice, But not such a sarifice as the Jews had, for they of
their Altars did eat carnally, to the filling of their bellies, but we do
eat Christ spirituallie by faith. So that now when Saint Paul says, we have
an Altar, whereof it is not lawful for the Priests of Moses Law to eat, he
understands by the Altar, the Sacrifice that was offered upon the Altar, of
the which the Priests did eat, they did not eat of the very Altar, for then
they should have eaten stones and mortar, but they did eat the Sacrifice
offered upon the Altar. And as they had a sacrifice carnal, whereof they did
eat, so have we a spiritual Sacrifice which is Christ, whom we do eat by
faith spirituallie. And to the mystical eating of Christ and drinking his
blood, it skilled not whether the Table be of wood or stone. Ric. Turnar.

They that stick to the Ceremonies of the ^awe, can not be partakers of our
Altar which is thanksgiving, and liberality: which two Sacrifices or
offerings, are now only left to the Christians. Geneua.

How Christ is the true Altar.
They shall come up to be accepted upon mine Altar. Esa. 60. 7.
Because the Altar was a figure of Christ. Heb. 13. He shows, that nothing
can be acceptable to him, which is not offered unto him by this Altar, who was
both the offering and the Altar it self. Geneua.

What Saint Austen did understand by the Altar.
When Saint Austen and other holy Fathers did speak^ of the Altar, they
understood none other thing by it, but the Table or board that they used in
their Communion, which (I say) they called an Altar, alluding to the Altars of
the old Law, and having respect to the Sacrific^ of praise and thanksgiving,
that was offered by the Church in the Supper of the Lord. This was the state
of the Church concerning this matter in Saint Austines time, who was about
four hundred years after the Ascencion of our Savior Jesus Christ, at the
which time the Church began wonderfully to grow out of kind. I. Veron.

Saint Paul does compare the Jewish Leuits, and the Preachers of the Gospel
together, 1. Co. 9. 13
saying thus: Do you not know, that they which minister about holy things,
etc. Proving there^by, as the Jewish Levites served the Altars and lived of the
Altars, that is of such things as was offered thereon: even so the Preachers of
the Gospel ought likewise to live of the Gospel. S. Austen upon this word
Altar says: The Altar signifies the Altar of the Jews. So that by this
place, the Papists cannot stablish their Altars.

That part that was burnt, was devoured of the Altar: and the other was due
unto the Priests by the Law. Geneua.

If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, Mat. 5. 23
etc. He applies all this speech to the state of his time, when as there was
an Altar standing in Jerusalem. And therefore they are very foolish, that
gather heerevpon, that we must build Altars, and use sacrifices: but they are
more fools, which draw, that to Purgatory, which is spoken of peace making
and atonement one with another. Beza.

AMATIST.
The description of an Amatist, and what is betokened thereby.
THe twelfth an Amatist. Ap^. 21. 20
This ^^one is as red as a rose, and casts out certain little flames. And it
signifies that the blessed sort are crowned with an vnapparable and flaming
crown of everlasting life: which shall continue always as fresh and red as
a Rose, t^^e without end. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 300.

The Amatist^ is purple, violet, and rose colored: and this betokens them
that are seruent, meek and constant in the Lords truth, and that has been
always ready to shed their blo^d for it. Such were the seven brethren in
the Machabees, with their most faithful mother^ So was also James the more,
and Antipas the faithful witness: None can show a more token of love, then
he which gives up his life for his friend. This ^ort did Christ proclaim
altogether blessed, and said that the kingdom of Heaven was their own. Bale.

AMEN.
What this word signifies.
AMen is an Hebrew word, and signifies even so be it, Nu. 5. 22.
or be it fast and sure, approving and allowing the sentence going before: and
when it is double it augmenteth the confirmation, as in many Psalms. and
John. 5. and. 6. T. M.

Even so, Apoc. 1. 7.
Amen. Amen among the Hebrews betokens commonly an affirming or allowing of
a thing. Like as Etiam does among the Latins, and as yea, or sobeit does among
Englishmen. By which term they mean that they agree to the opinion of other
men, and subscribe their saiengs, and also that they with the same thing with
their heart, which some forespeaker has prayed in words set together for the
purpose. So is that term used in psalms and prayers, according as it is to be
seen in the ^. Cor. 14. 16. Howbeit among the Hebrews, their Amen imports
an assuring or oath, according as we see the same term used in the Gospel.
Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 15.

How shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen, (...)
at thy giving of thanks.

One only made the prayers, and the rest of the peop^^ followed in heart his
words, and when he had prayed, they all said, Amen. Signifieng, that they
believed assuredly, that God wou^^ grant their requests. Geneua.

AMORITES.
What an intolerable custom they had.
IT was the custom of the Amorites, that their Brides do set themselves
forth at the gates of the Cities by the space of seven days together, to be
abused in fornication. And by this means, Judah was deceived of Thamar his
daughter in law.

ANABAPTISTS.
How this sect began, and who was the Author thereof.
About the year of our Lord 1525. in Mulhausen a t^w^^ in Thuringe was a
Preacher named Monetarius which taught openly that he would reform the state
of the Church, and made aduaunt priuelie, that revelations were showed to him
by God, and that the sword of Gedeon was committed to him, to overthrow the
tyranny of the Impius. He led out great companies, commanding them to spoil
and rob Monasteries, and the palaces of great men. But while the unruly people
were scattered and disseuered without order, the Princes of Saxony suddenly
oppressed them, and took their Captain, whom they put to death.

This Monetarius was the first Author of the devilish sect of heresy, of the
Anabaptists which long time after vexed Germany, and is not yet altogether
extinguished.

The Anabaptists caused great trouble and rufling in the North parts of
Germany, and at the City Monstere, choosing to their King one John a lead (a
Coblar as says Sledane) exercised much cruelty, expelling other out of the
City that would not condescend unto their belief. This John a lead in token
that he had both heavenly and earthly power, gave to his Guard green and
blew, and had for his Arms the figure of the world, with a sword thrust
through it. He married himself fifteen wives, and ordained that other should
have as many as they listed, and all other things to be common among them.

The Bishop of Monstere by the aid of other Princes besieged the City against
the rebellious Anabaptists fifteen or sixteen months. In which time the
stubborn and froward people sustained so great scarsitie and hungar, that they
being alive were like dead corses, and did eat commonly dogs, cats, mice
with other wild beasts, and seething hides, leather, and old shoes, did
powne the same and make bread thereof. After long siege, the City was won,
spoiled and destroyed with great cruelty and slaughter of that wicked people.
Cooper.

ANANIAS.
How his dissembling was punished.
Brought a certain part, Act. 5. 2.
and laid it at the Apostles feet. By the casting of his moneie at the
Apostles feet, would he have been counted to be one of the Christian
Congregation, and that one of the chief. But in holding part back, he
declared utterly what he was, that is, subtle and an hypocrite, mistrusting
the Holy ghost, which thing because Peter would in no condition should be used
among that sort, therefore punished he it so earnestly. Tindale.

How he needed not to have sold his possession, if he had lust.
Was it not thine own, Act. 5. 4.
and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power, etc. By this place we
may evidently see, that in the Primitive Church, no man was compelled to make
his goods common, for Peter tells plainly, that it did lie in Ananias power,
whether he would sell his land or no, and when he had sold it the moneie was
his own, so that he might have kept it, if he had lusted.

ANATHEMA.
What Anathema is.
ANathema (says Chrysostom) are those things which being consecrated to God,
are laid up from other things, and which also no man dare either touch or use.
Pet. Mart.

ANDREW.
Of the death of Andrew the Apostle.
I Erome in his book De catologo Scriptorum Eccl. writes, how that Andrew the
Apostle and brother to Peter, which did preach to the Scitians, Sogdians,
Saxons and to the City Augustia, was crucified of Eneas the Governor of the
Edessians, and was buried in Patris a city of Achaia. Book of Mar. fol. 52.

Of an heretic called Andrew.
This man was an Italian, Heretic.
who went about the countreie, leading a blind read dog, and by telling
men's fortunes, he brought them into great misfortunes, by deceiving of them
with heriticall fables. Futrop. ab vsperg.

ANGEL.
What an Angel is.
Angel, is a Greek word, and signifies messenger, and all the Angels are
called messengers, because they are sent so often from God to man on message.
Even so, Prophets, Preachers, and the Prelates of the Church, are called
Angels, that is to say messengers, because their office is to bring the
message of God unto the people. The good Angels here in this book, are the
true Bishops and Preachers, and the evil Angels are the heretics and false
preachers, which ever falsify Gods word, with which the Church shall be thus
miserably plagued, unto the end of the world. Tindale.

This word Angel has undoubtedly sprung from the Greek word (...). Which in
Latin is as much to say as Nuncius, a Messenger. By the which it is plain
that Saint Augustine says: Angelus non nature, sed officij nomen est. As I am
a man naturally, but I am a priest, a preacher by office. So naturally an
Angel is a spirit, but when he is sent on message, then is he an Angel. Saint
Augustine defines an Angel on this wise: Angelus spiritus est, substantia in
corpora, inuisibilis, rationabilis, intellectualis, immortalis. An Angel is a
spirit, that word Spiritus is in the place of Genesis a spirit, that is a
substance bodilesse, or a substance without a body, invisible, endued with
reason, understanding and immortal. They eat not, they drink not, they
marry not, they sleep not, but live evermore in heavenly joy and fruition
of God, fulfilling his blessed will and pleasure, with all readiness, without
any weariness or slacknesse, and therefore we say in the Lords prayer: Fiat
voluntas tua, sicut in coelo and in terra. They serve God, not with crieng of
the mouth, for they have none, but with crieng of mind, and that they do
continually. And as Esaias the Prophet says, these be part of their holy
crieng, Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus, Dominus Deus Sabbath. As they are without
body, so they occupy no circumscriptiue place, that is to say, no bodily
place, no several nor quanticatiue place, and yet their intellectiue and
spiritual place is so, that when they be in Heaven they be not in earth. And
contrary when they be in earth they be not in Heaven. For there is no power
finite, that can be in two places at once. And if ye will know says Saint
Austen, how Angels do eat and drink, ye shall understand, that Angels
taking upon them the visible and tangible bodies of men, Edent habent
potestatem, sed non necessitatem. Rich. Turnar.

Wherefore Angels were made.
An Angel is the creature of God, in spiritual understanding, mighty, made
to serve God in the Church, from which end of their creation, some are fallen
and become enemies of the Church. Other that fell not, but continued in their
innocence, do serve to God and his Church.

How Angels ought not to be worshipped.
We ought (says Saint Austine) August de vere relig^ca. vlt.
to believe that the bountiful Angels, and the most excellent ministers of
God, will have us worship one God with them, by whose contemplation they are
all blessed. Neither do we build temples for them, for they will not be so
honored of us, because that they know that when we are godly, we are the
Temples of God. Therefore it is well and rightly written, that man was
forbidden of the Angel to worship him, but one God, under whom he was his
fellow-seruant.

How this place following is understood.
Which after his own imagination, Col. 2. 18.
walks in the humbleness and holiness of Angels. By religion of Angels,
says the old translation. Erasmus, By superstition of Angels. What S. Paul
means here I cannot well tell, Humbleness, holiness, religion, or
superstition of Angels.
except he mean that false Apostles phantasied some hie honor and worship, to
be given to holy Angels, if they keep y^ law given by the ministration of
holy Angels: and those to displease the Angels, y^ keep not the law given by
Angels: and holy Angels to honor them, that observe the law^ So they taught
y^ Angels of God, to venge their injury and displeasures in them y^ keep not
the law of Moses. So these Pseudo Apostles taught it to be a worshipping of
Angels, to observe y^ law and the works of the law, as necessary to
salvation, which thing S. Paul counts here, no honor nor worship of Angels,
but superstition of Angels, a pretense to honor Angels, and do dishonor them,
and most rebuke to Angels that can be done. Or else this place may be otherwise
expounded after this manner. That some Pseudo Apostles among the Coll^sians
studied to deceive them, saying: they were the Angels of God, sent from God
above, and that they had received certain visions of Angels, and of holy
spirits in some Oracles, wherein they were showed the will and pleasure of God,
and what God would have done of men in the earth, and that was that they must
needs keep the law of Moses and the works of it, or else they said they could
not be saved, which thing S. Paul reproves in all his Epistles, but most
plainly improued and condemned of y^ Apostles of Christ. Act. 15. Such Pseudo
Apostles was among us sometimes, that said holy Angels, holy spirits and
souls of men departed to have appeared unto them, that they should go this
pilgrimage to this Image or that Image, in such a place that they should cause
to be said or song, so many D^riges, so many Masses, found such a foundation
for Masses, for prescript prayers, purchase such Pardons and such Indulgenties,
and many like revelations has been showed to men, as Pseudo Apostles said, by
the which means they deceived many of a long time, but thanks be to God,
their deceit is known in a manner to all men, how vain and foolish it was,
and how ungodly and how perilous and contrary to man's salvation, and how it
came not of God but of the devil, and was invented of men, and maintained for
lucre sake. I. Ridley.

Of good and evil Angels.
Of good Angels that do ^erue God and his Church. Good Angel.
The Epistle to the Hebrews says thus: Are not all ministering spirits, and
sent to minister for their sakes which shall be heirs of salvation. Heb. 1. 14.

Of the evil Angel the Lord says: Evil Angel.
that Satan with his company is a liar and a murderer from the beginning. And
Saint Peter says: The devil goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he
may deu^ure. John. 8. 44 1. Pet. 5. 8.

How the Angels are not against the authority of Magistrates.
When the Angels which are greater both in power and might, 21. Pet. 2^ ^1.
give not railing judgment against them before God. Albeit the Angels condemn
the vice and iniquity of wicked magistrates, yet they blame not the authority
and power which is given them of God. Geneua.

Why the Angels be called powers, principalities, virtues, etc.
Although Angels be called powers, principalities and virtues, it is not for
that God has resigned his own office unto them, it is not for that he has
dispoiled himself of his own power, it is not for that he himself abides
idle in heaven: But it is for that the Angels are instruments of his power, to
the end it should be spread out over all, etc. Calvin upon Job. fol. 15.

How Angels be called the sons of the Gods.
Among the sons of the Gods. He calls the Angels the sons of the Gods,
Psalm. 89. 6.
because they neither have had their beginning of the earth, nor are clad with
corruptible bodies, but are heavenly spirits, endued with the glory of God.
Not y^ they be any part of gods being or substance as brainsick persons
dream: but because God utters his mighty power in them, therefore is their
nature distinguished from ours by this title. The effect thereof is that
although there shine forth a greater majesty is y^ Angels then in other
creatures, insomuch that they ravish us to wonder at them, yet come they
nothing near unto God, that they should dim him with their excellency, or
part stakes of souereigntie with him: which thing is to be marked advisedly,
because y^ although God do every where avouch y^ Angels to be but servants
and ready at his commandment, yet y^ world being not contented with the one
God, forgeth to it self many Gods. Calvin.

How Angels appearing in human bodies were not men.
Two things are diligently here to be weighed. One is, whether Angels when
they after this sort put on human bodies, may be called men: I think not.
For if we understand human flesh, which is formed and borne of a reasonable
soul, undoubtedly Angels after that manner cannot be said to have hamaine
flesh. What then will some men say? Were the senses deceived when men saw
them? Not so. For the senses judge only outward things, and such things as
appear. But what inwardly impelleth or moves these things which they see they
judge not. That longs to reason to seek and search out. This also is to be
added, that Angels did not continually retain these bodies, because they were
not joined to them, in one and the self same substance: so y^ an Angel and a
body were made one person. The holy Ghost also although he was a true Dove
where he descended, yet was not he together one substance with it, whe^fore the
Dove was not y^ holy Ghost, not y^ holy Ghost the Dove. Otherwise Angels may
(as we have before taught) enter indeed into a body before made, and which
before had his being, as it is read of y^ Angel which spoke in y^ Ass of
Bala^m, and of the devil, which by the Serpent talked with Eve. But at this
present we dispute not of that kind, but only say, that Angels working in
this manner in the bodies of creatures, are not joined unto them in one and the
self same substance. Wherefore, the ass could not be called an Angel,
neither was the Angel an Ass, even as the Serpent was not in very deed the
devil, neither was the devil the Serpent. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 211.

Whether Angels did in very deed eat and drink when they appeared.
Of the Schoolmen, some think that they did eat in very deed, and other
deny it. Scotus thinks that to eat is nothing else, then to chawe meat, and
to conueigh it down into the belly, and this thing did the Angels, wherefore
he gathers, that they did eat in very deed. Other do think, that to
eat, is not only to chawe the meat, and to conueigh it down into the
belly, but moreover to convert it into the substance of his body by
concoction through the power of vegitation. This for so much as the Angels did
not, therefore they did not eat in very deed. The book of Tobias is not in
the Canon of the Hebrews, but yet it might be applied to our purpose, but that
there is variance in the copies, for in that book which Munster set out in
Hebrews, in the twelfth Chapter. Raphel the Angel says: I seemed to you to
eat and to drink, but I did not eat neither drink, the common translation
has: I seemed to eat and to drink, but I use invisible meat and drink.
Neither text denies, but that the Angel after a certain manner did eat.
Pet. Mart. upon Iudic. fol. 212.

How Angels be by nature spirits, by office messengers.
The Scripture declares of the Angels, that they be by nature spirits, by
office Angels, that is to say, messengers. August. Psalm. 103. The spirits be
Angels, and when they be spirits, they be not Angels, when they be sent they be
Angels, for Angel is the name of the office, and not of nature. Respecting
that whereof he is, he is a spirit: and in respect of that which he does, he
is an Angel, Who makes (says the Apostle) Angels his spirits: y^ is to say,
he makes messengers of his spirits, and in the first Chapter of the Hebrews.
They be all serueable spirits sent for the health of the elect. Musculus. fol.
10.

How Angels be not borne, but created of God.
Scripture teaches us, that Angels be not gotten of God, as Christ the only
begotten of God, but that they be created of God, and made in like sort as the
rest of the creatures. That they be not gotten of God as Christ was. The
Apostle witnesses where he says: Heb. 1. 5.
To which of his Angels did he say at any time: I have begotten thee this
day: and again, I will be to him a Father, and he to me a son: but whereas
in Job, the Angels be called the sons of God, it is not to be understood, that
they be the natural sons of God as Christ was, but because they be the
sons of grace and adoption, as all the elect be. That they be created and
made, the Prophet David witnesses Psalm. 148. 2. But when and what time they
were made, there is no mention in any place of Scripture. A man may gather
that they were made at that time, when the foundation of the world was set, by
that we do read in Job. 38. read the place. But it appears not by that place
plainly and determinatelie, when they were created, as it is not in any place
declared, whereof and how they were made. Musculus. fol. 10.

How Angels are appointed to wait on the faithful.
Then said they, it is his Angel. Act. 12. 15.
There be many places in the Scriptures where we do plainly learn, that
Angels be appointed to wait on the faithful, even from their very birth. Ag.
18. 10. Heb. 1. 14. And in the Psalms: He has given commandment to his
Angels, that they keep thee in thy way. Such a thing is here meant by his
Disciples. Sir. I. Cheek.

For they did know by Gods word, that Angels were appointed to defend the
faithful. And also in those days, they were accus^omed to see such sights.
Geneua.

How we shall be like unto Angels.
But are as Angels of God in heaven. Mat. 12. 30.
Here we must note and mark, that Christ does not say, in the resurrection
they shall be Angels, but they shall be like unto Angels. For Angels have no
bodies at all, but we shall have our bodies both raised from death, and also
glorified. Sir. I. Cheek.

How Christ is greater then the Angels, proved by this place.
He makes his Angels spirits, and his ministers a flaming fire. The absolute
meaning of which words, we must learn of the Apostle himself, Heb. 1. 7.
in the (...) 4. ver. following, where according to this testimony, he has
defined their nature, and called them ministering spirits. Then in these words
he makes his Angels spirits, and his ministers a flaming fire, according to
the similitude in which their glory has been seen: as the Angels that were
with Elize^s, his servants saw them in Chariots of fire: The similitude of the
beasts which Ezechiel saw, were as coals of burning fire: and the Seraphins
have their names, because they be of fiery color. And these words spirits and
ministers, we must resolve thus, ministering spirits. Angels are ministering
spirits.
So out of this text his argument stands thus: Christ is called the son,
the first begotten son, whom the Angels worship: but the Angels are his
ministering spirits, therefore Christ is greater the^ ye Angels. Deer.

The opinion that every man has his good and bad Angel is false.
The opinion y^ particular men have of their particular Angel, A good and bad
Angel.
one good, an other bad, is an heresy (says M. Deering) not much unlike the
Maniches, who taught y^ every man was violently drawn to do good or evil,
by a good spirit or evil, which equality of themselves had rule in man, etc.
The first author of it (says he) was Empedocles the Philosopher, who as
Plutarch says, taught, t^^t every man had two Angels, one good, and an other
bad, etc. Plut. de Animi. Tranqu.

The degree of Angels falselie proved, answered.
The Prophet Ezechiel describing the glory of ye king of Tire, ^ze. 8. 13.
he names nine precious stones, which are in his garments: in which place, he
names the same king Cherub, comparing him with the Angels, therefore these
stones signified nine orders of Angels.

Answer.
Touching the argument of the nine precious stones of ye king of Tyrus, it is
nothing but folly: for what though he were compared to Angels in glory,
because his garment was full of precious stones, does it therefore follow, y^
as many kind of stones as were in his gown, so many orders there should be
of Angels? Nine orders of Angels.
If I saw a man clothed in rich colors, and many jewels about him, so that I
would say, he shines like the Sun: must it needs follow, y^ as many
colors as are about him, so many colors are in the Sun? But the thing is all
false, the king is not there compared to Angels, but because the Cherubins y^
covered the mercy seat were of beaten gold, and excellent workmanship, with
that, y^ king is compared and called the covering, and the anointed Cherub: so
that the nine precious stones, must be nine orders of Cherubins upon y^ mercy
seat, or nine orders of clothing. Deering.

What is understood by the four Angels.
By these four Angels Four Angels.
are understood noisome ministers, Apoc. 7. ^.
which go about to hinder both the life and doctrine of the gospel, and the
true faith. The Angel which ascended from the rising of the Sun, etc. is our
savior Christ, which always procures some to further the Gospel against
tyrants Antechrists. Sir. I. Cheek.

I saw four Angels (says S. John) etc. Apoc. 7. 1^
These are the hypocrites with their false doctrine: The Antechrists with their
pestilent degrees and traditions. The cruel princes with their tyrannous laws,
and the ungodly magistrates with their ignorance and blindness. These stand
upon y^ four corners of the earth, they reign in the four quarters of y^
world, with lies in hypocrisy: errors in superstition, with tyranny in
power, and cruelty in executing human laws. These withold ^he ^oure winds
of ye earth. The doctrine of the spirit which God has sent to be blown the
world over, they withstand, resist, stop, vex, and evermore persecute, least
it should blow upon y^ earth, which is y^ gardein of god, driving away from
thence all filth and corruption. Bale.

What is meant by the seven Angels.
And I saw the seven Angels, etc. These seven Angels, Apoc. 8. (...).
be many Antechristes, and those mighty that do harm to the faithful and
hinder y^ Gospel. But Jesus Christ stands at the Altar, with the oblacion of
his body, for y^ faithful. Sir. I. Cheek.

Who the Angel was.
And showed by his Angel. There be y^ think, y^ by this Angel, Apoc. 1. 1^
was meant Christ: but more rightly do other understand him to have been some
one of those heavenly spirits y^ are called ministering spirits, and are sent
abroad about service, for their sake y^ shall be heirs of salvation. He. 1.
14. for by this means Christ proved to be the Lord of Angels, as by whose
service in y^ wonderful administration of his kingdom, he both delivers the
godly out of the hands of the ungodly, and also punishes the wicked from time
to time. Beside this, we shall see the Angel, more then once refuse the
worship that John was about to yield unto him, in this present book. 19. 10.
and. 22. 9. which thing Christ would not have done, inasmuch as he is far more
excellent, not only then man, but also then all the Angels. Mar. upon the
Apoc. fol. 5.

Of the Angel that went down into the poole, where the sick lay.
For an Angel went down at a certain season into the poole, John. 5. 4.
etc. It is uncertain when or how often, the Angel came down to the water,
whether once in a year or oftener. Some think that he descended every
feastiuall day, and that then some one sick person or other was healed.
Other-some think y^ this was done upon the day of Pentecost. Notwithstanding
this is most certain that the benefit is to be ascribed unto God, who in
working has ever used the ministry of Angels, of men, of Elements. For that
which the Angel did here, he did it as a minister of God. For it is a work
proper unto God, to cure the sick. But as he has ever used the hand and work
of Angels, so he has committed these parts in charge to the Angels, for the
which cause the Angels are called powers or virtues, not because God resigning
his power unto them, sits himself idle in heaven: but because he working
mightelie in them, mightelie declares unto us his power. Therefore they do
very wickedlie which ascribe any thing to Angels, which is proper to God, or
which make them such mediators between God and us, that they obscure the
glory of God: when as we ought rather directly to come unto Christ, that by
his conducting aid and commandment, we may have the Angels helpers and
ministers of our salvation. Mar. upon John. fol. 146.

ANGER.
What Anger is, by Aristotle's definition.
Anger is nothing else (if we may believe Aristotle in his Rhetorikes) but a
desire of reuengement because of contempt. For they which perceive themselves
to be despised and contemned, do straight way think, how they may be
revenged, and they diligently meditate how by some punishment, they may
requite the injury or despite done unto them.

How Anger (in some respect) is no sin.
ANger is no sin, so that the original thereof, and the end whether it
extends be virtuous, and proceed with charity. Moses was angry and brake
the tables of God in his zealous and godly passion. He put the idolaters to
death, but the end was to destroy vice, and maintain virtue. So was David,
so was Saul, so was Christ, but it sprang of a love toward God, and extended
to a virtuous end, the punishment of vice, and commendation of virtue. Whooper.

Be angry and sin not. Ephe. 4. 34.
Christ was angry at the blindness of the Jews. Psalm 4. 5.
Mat. 23. and so was Moses at the idolatry of the Israelites. Exo. 32 and at
the sedition of Chore, Dathan, and Abiram, Number. 16. nevertheless this anger or
wrath was but a very zeal unto the law of God, as thou may see by Phinehes
in Nu. 25 and by Mathathias. 1. Mac. 2. As for malice and unlawful wrath, it
is utterly forbidden, as it follows in the same chapter, where he says: let
not the Sun go down upon your wrath. Tindale.

I have been through angry, 3. Reg. 19. 10.
for the Lord God of hoasts sake. Anger is not here taken for such as is
between enemies, but such as proceeds of seruent love, as when the Father is
angry with the son, not because he would him evil, but shows thereby that
he loves him better, for in correcting him he provides that he fall not into
worse. Such an anger, zeal, or jealousy, had Phinehes also. Nu. 25.

What Anger is forbidden.
Christ prohibiteth anger as the beginning of hatred, murder, and destruction.
For he said, he that is angry with his brother is worthy of judgment: for
anger and reuengement are separate one from an other, only as the root and
the fruit. For he that is angry with any man, if he hurt him not, that
chances, because either he cannot, or else fears the punishment of the
laws. He that hates his brother (says John) is a murderer. But among those
which are counted very angry, kings above other are numbered, when they
perceive that they are despised of their subjects. Wherefore Homere says:
Great is the anger of a kings displeasure. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 166.

How anger or wrath is in God.
God is said to be angry (kiss the son least the Lord be Psalm. 2. 12.
angry) when we break his commandments, despise his threatenings, set light
by his promise, and follow our own corrupt appetites. God is said to be angry
and changed but the change is in us and not in him, Augustine
for he is immutable, with whom says S. James, is no variableness, neither is
he changed. The Psalmist says. 101. He changes all things as a vesture, but
he himself is immutable, unchangeable. Lactantius in the book which he
writes of the anger of God, does not only attribute this unto God that he
seems to be angry, when he does chasten and punish sinners: but he does
expreslie give unto him a certain commotion also which we do call anger. And
I will not grudge to resite his words. These things says he, which be naught
must of necessity displease him that is good and just, and he that is
displeased with evil, is moved when he sees it done. We do rise to revenge,
not because we be hurt and anoied, but that discipline may be kept, men's
manners corrected, liberty refrained. This is a just anger, Just anger
which as it is necessary in man for the redress of naughtiness, so is it
also in God, from whom the example came unto man. For like as it behooves us
to chasten them which be subject unto our jurisdiction, so it beseems God, to
chasten the sins of all, and that he may do that he must needs be angry.
For it is natural for the good to be moved and stirred at the sin of an
other. Therefore they should have defined it thus, that anger is the motion of
the mind, meaning to chastise sin. For the definition of Cicero: Anger is a
desire to revenge, is not much different from that we said before. But the same
anger^ which we may call either fury or rage, Evil anger Good anger.
ought not to be in man, because it is altogether faulty. But that anger which
belongs to correction of vice, neither ought to be taken from man, neither
can be taken from God, because it is both profitable and necessary for me^.
This says Lactantius, by which words he does not take from God the commotion
and stir of anger, but that only which is joined with fault, and is
unseemly also for man. Musculus. fol. 438.

For some when they heard, Heb. 3. 16.
provoked him to anger. He is angry here, because they refused wisdom and
embraced folly, because they forsook y^ word of truth, and ^olowed vain
devices, because they would not enter into ye rest promised them, but had more
desire to return to y^ heavy labor and bondage of Aegipt. This madness of
y^ people the Lord is angry with, as a loving Father y^ had care over them. So
if we will have holy anger, Holy anger.
let it be free from all hatred and revenge, and arise only for the profit
and well doing of our neighbor. Thus we read our Savior Christ was angry,
when he saw y^ frowardness of the Jews, who by no admonitions would be made
wiser. Thus S. Paul provoke Timothy, when he says: Reprove and sharply
rebuke men, y^ they turn not away from y^ truth. So S. Jude bids us all if
we fall into company with froward men, to save them with fear, as if we would
sodeinlie pluck them out of the fire. Thus if we can have our affections moved,
we are holi^^e angry, for ye end of our doings, is y^ profit of our brother
Deering. By wrath Wrath.
is understood, not a disturbance or perturbatio^ of the mind, for these things
can have no place in God. But as Augustine has well interpreted in his book of
y^ Trinity: Wrath in God signifies a just vengeance. And God is said to be
angry, when he shows forth his effects of an angry man, which are to
punish and a^enge. So he is said to repent himself that he had made man:
because like a man that repents himself, he would overthrow his work. Pet
Mart. upon the Romans 107.

And the wrath of the Lord wared hot^e against Israel, etc. Whereas y^ wrath of
God wared hot against Israel, Iudic. 2. 14
is not so to be understood as though God had any affections, for that
pertains only unto men. But according to the common and received exposition
of these places, we feel y^ God is like unto men y^ are angry, after which
self same reason it is written, y^ he sometime repents, wherefore God either
to repent or to be angry, is nothing else, but that he does those things, which
men repenting or to be angry use to do, for the one do either alter or else
overthrow that which before they had done: and the other take vengeance or
injuries done unto them. Ambr^se in his book of Noe and the Arc, the 4.
Chapter, speaks otherwise of the anger of God: for neither does God (says he)
think as men do, as though some contrary sentence should come unto him,
neither he is angry, as though h^^ wore mutable, but therefore these things
are believed, to express the bitterness of our sins, which has deserved
the wrath o^ God, and to declare that the fault has so much and so far
increased, that even God also (which naturally is hot moved either by anger or
hatred, or any passion) seems to be provoked to wrath, etc. And aptly is
there mention made of the anger, before the punishment. For men use first to be
angry before they revenge. Pet Mar. upon Iudic. fol 70.

Of two kinds of Anger.
He was exceeding wrath, Mat. 5. 16.
etc. There are two kinds of anger, the one deserved the other undeserved. The
deserved anger is, with the which God is provoked against sinners, parents
against disobedient children, Magistrates against wicked subjects, and masters
against negligent scholars, and such like. He that gives occasion of such
anger offends and is in fault, because the party against whom the offense
is committed, is justly angry, but such was not the anger of Herod. The
undeserved anger is, when as they are let by some means or other from their
wicked intent and purpose. He that gives occasion to these, is not in fault.
With this kind of anger was Herod angry, therefore the fault was in himself
and not in the wise men. Marl. upon Math. fol. 24.

ANOINTING.
What is meant by the Anointing of the head.
But wheu thou fastest, Mat. 6. 17.
anoint thy head, etc. To anoint the head is meant, as turning the other
cheek, and of that the left hand should not know what the right did. That is,
that they should avoid all vain glory, and fast to God, and for the intent
that God ordained it for. And that with a merry heart and cheerful
countenance, thereby to seek the working of God, and to be sure of his
favor. Such is the meaning, and not to bind them that fast to anoint their
heads and wash their faces. And the manner and phrase of speaking comes of
an usage that was among the Jews, to anoint themselves with sweet and
odiferous ointmentes, when they were disposed to be merry and to make good
cheer. As ye see how Mary of Bethanie powered a box of precious ointments upon
Christ's head as he sat at supper. Tindale.

Of the anointing of the sick with Oil, what was meant thereby.
And they anointed many that were sick, Mat. 6. 13
with Oil. In healing the sick the Apostles did use oil, to signify
thereby, that they were healed by the virtue of ye holy Ghost, which in the
holy Scriptures many times is signified by outward unction. Sir. I. Cheek.

Look Oil.

ANTES.
The first inuenters of a common weal.
PLato says, that the first inuenters of a common weal were the Antes, for as
we see by experience, they live togethers, they travail togethers, and make
provision in the winter togethers. And in going and coming from their work,
they hurt not one an other, but each one reioiceth at others travail, and none
do give them to any private thing, but altogethers for the common wealth, and
they live by thousands together in one little hillock, where as two men only
in a common weal cannot live in peace and concord.

ANTICHRIST.
What Antichrist is.
ANtichrist is not the proper name of a person, 1. John. 2. 18.
but of an office. For as S. John in his first Epistle and second Chapter,
says, many are Antichrists.

Antichrist signifies not any particular man, 1. John. 4. 3
which (as the people dream) should come in the end of the world. For ye see
that in Saint John's time he was already come. But all that teach false
doctrine contrary to the word of God, are Antichrists. Tindale.

Mark this above all things, that Antichrist is not an outward thing, that is
to say, a man that should sodeinlie appear with wonders, as our Fathers
talked of him, no verily. For Antichrist is a spiritual thing, and is as much
to say, as against Christ, that is, one that preaches false doctrine
contrary to Christ. Antichrist was in the old Testament, Antichrist was in
the old Testament.
and fought with the Prophets. He was also in the time of Christ, and of the
Apostles, as thou read in the Epistles of Saint John, and of Paul to the
Corinthians and Galathians, and other Epistles. Antichrist is now, and shall (I
doubt not) endure unto the worlds end. But his nature is (when he is uttered
and overcome with the word of God) to go out of the place for a season, and
the^ to come in again with a new name, a new raiment. As thou see how Christ
rebuked y^ scribes and the pharesies in y^ gospel (which were very
Antichrists) saying: Woe be unto you Pharesies, for ye rob widows houses, ye
pray long prayers under a color, ye shut up ye kingdom of heaven, and suffer
the^ not y^ would to enter in, ye have taken away ye key a knowledge, ye make
me^ to break Gods commandments with your traditions, ye beguile y^ people with
hypocrisy, and such like, which things al our prelates do, but have yet got
the^ new names, and other garments, and are other wise disguised. There is
difference is y^ names between a Pope, a Cardinal, a Bishop, and so forth,
and to say a Scribe, a pharesie, a Seuiour, and so forth, but ye thing is al
one. Even so now, when we have uttered him, he will change himself once more,
and turn himself into an angel of light. 2. Cor. 11. read y^ place I exhort
thee, whatsoever thou art that read this and note it well. The Jews look for
Christ, and he is come. 1500. years ago, and they not aware: we also have
looked for Antichrist, and he has reigned as long, and we not ware, and that
because either or us looked carnally for him, and not in y^ place where we
ought to have sought. Christ, neither Antichrist, not a right looked for.
The Jews had found Christ verily, if they had sought him in y^ law and
Prophets, whither Christ se^deth the^ to seek. John. 5. We also had spied out
Antichrist long ago, if we had looked in y^ doctrine of Christ and his
Apostles, where, because ye beast sees himself now to be sought for, he
roareth and seeks new holes to hide himself in, and changes himself into a
thousand fashions, with all manner wilines, falsehood, subtlety, and craft,
because y^ his excommunications are come to light, he makes it treson unto the
king to be acquainted with Christ. If Christ and they may not live together,
one hope we have y^ Christ shall live for ever. The old Antichrist brought
Christ unto Pilate, saying, by our law he ought to die, and when Pilate had
them judge him after their law, they answered: It is not lawful for us to kill
any man, which they did to the intent y^ they which regarded not ye shame of
their false excommunications, should yet fear to confess Christ, because y^
the temporal sword had condemned him. They do all things of a good zeal say
they. They love you so well y^ they had rather burn you then y^ you should
have fellowship with Christ. They are zealous over you amiss, as says S.
Paul. Gal. 4. 17. They would divide you from Christ and his holy Testament,
and join you to the Pope to believe his Testament. Tindale. fol. 60

It is to be noted, that as often as any mention is made of Antichrist, it must
not be restrained unto any one man, but rather be extended to some whole
kingdom, which sets it self against Christ's kingdom. For there have been many
Antichrists from the beginning, according as John declares. 1. John. 2. 18.
namely, even as many as have gone about to lead Christ's Church away from the
pureness and singlenes of Gods word, by their untoward and noisome errors, etc.
Marl. upon the Apo. fol. 183

A prophecy of Antichrists birth.
While king Richard was yet in the land of Palestine, he sent to the I Will of
Calabria for Abbas Ioachim, of whose famous learning and wonderful prophesies
he had heard much. Among other demands, he asked him of Antichrist, what time
and in what place he should chiefly appear. Antichrist says he, is alredie
borne in the city of Rome, and will set himself yet higher in y^ seat
Apostolic. I thought says y^ king, that he should have been borne in Antioch or
in Babylon, and to have come to the stock of Dan. I reckoned also y^ he should
have reigned in the temple of God within Jerusalem, and only have travailed,
for y^ space of three years and a half whereas Christ travailed, to dispute
against ^noch and Helias. Not so (says Ioachim) but as the Apostle reports,
he is the only adversary which extolleth himself above al y^ is called God.
For whereas ye Lord is called but holy, he is called the most holy father.
This Antichrist shall be opened, and him shall God destroy with y^ spirit of his
mouth, and light of his coming, etc. Bale.

The time of Antichrists disclosing.
If ye will weigh Paul's words diligently, we shall also know the time wherein
Antichrist must be disclosed to the world. For writing to y^ Thessalonians y^
thought y^ Christ should shortly come to judgment, 2. These. 2. 3
and minding to bring them out of y^ opinion, says: y^ there shall a departing
come before the day of judgment, y^ is to say, y^ men must fall from y^
Emperor of Rome, as Hierom Anselme, Theophilact, Bid, Dionise, and almost all
y^ rest of y^ interpreters take it. True it is y^ Paul spoke this thing dark
lie, least he should offend men's minds. Therefore then (says Paul) y^ great
wicked body shall show forth himself, yea, and he shall not only succeed,
especially at Rome in his own strength, but also as Daniel writes he shall
bring to naught y^ rest of the horns and strength of y^ empire of Rome. So y^
we now see plainly enough y^ the people has not only shronke from the
obedience of the Empero^r of Rome: but also y^ the Emperors have no dominion
in Rome, more the^ these. 700. years. The Bishops have occupied this place in
the stead of y^ Emperors, by the which Bishops chiefly. The Emperors power
has been diminished, wherefore we must grant that they be right
Antichrists. B. Ochine. The Lord shall not come, 2. These. 2. 3
unless there come first a decaie, and that the sinful man be revealed, the
child of perdition, which shall be the adversary, and be advanced above
all that is called God or godly, etc. No man doubts but that he does speak
of Antichrist, and that he reports y^ he shall be revealed before the coming
of Christ, so that the revealing or opening of Antichrist, is the token of
these times, which do go before the coming of the Lord. And here we may
see what Barnard Barnard.
says upon the Psalm. Qui habitat. Sermo. 6. at the end. Now says he,
there is peace with pagans, peace with heretics, but we have not peace with
false children. Thou have multiplied people Lord Jesus, but thou have not
multiplied gladness: for there be many called and few chosen. All Christian
men, and well near all do seek things of their own, and not of Jesus
Christ. Yea, the very offices of ye dignities of the Church, are changed into
a filthy gain, and trafike of darkness, and there is not sought in them, the
salvation of men's souls, but the wast of riches: for this they be sworn, for
this they do haunt Churches, say Masses, sing Psalms, they do strive
shamefullie now a days for Bishopriks, for Abbotshippes, for Archdeaconries,
and other dignities, so that the rents of the Churches be wasted, in the use of
superfluity and vanity. There remains that the man of sin, the child of
perdition be revealed, the devil not only of the day, but of the noone
day, which is not only transfigured into an Angel of light, but is
advanced also over all that is called God, or that is worshipped. This says
Barnard, whereby it appears well enough unto who^ he thought that the words of
the Apostle should be referred, so that no man can charge us y^ we be the first
that have referred the same unto the head of the most corrupt Clergy, I mean
ye Simon of Rome. He gathered by y^ simonie, buieng and selling, covetousness
and excess of the Churchmen in his time, that the revelation of Antichrist was
at hand. Where we must mark by the way, that Barnard did not only
acknowledge the Antichrist should soon be revealed, but also that he was in
the Church, else he could not have been revealed, if that his coming had been
yet behind as it is surmised in the Popery. Musculus. fol. 451.

Proves that the Pope is Antichrist, and no heathen Prince.
First S. Paul. 2. These. 2. 1. Reason.
speaking purposelie of Antichrist says expreslie that he shall sit in the
Temple of God, which is the Church of Christ. And Christ says. Mat. 24. that
they must come in his name. But it is manifest, that the Heathen Emperors did
not ^it in this Temple of God, therefore Heathen Emperors be not this
Antichrist. And by ye same reason, Mahomet is not Antichrist, because he
sits without the Temple of God. And so Ottomanus. Now the Pope sits in
the mids of the Temple of God, and boasts himself to be God, chalenging unto
himself such authority as is proper only unto God, and usurping such honor
as in peculiar unto God. Therefore not in the heathen Emperors, but in the
Pope, is the Prophecy accomplished.

Again, 2. Reason.
it is manifest in scripture, that Antichrist should deceive the world with
false doctrine, under pretense and color of true religion: and therefore the
scriptures so oftentimes warns men that they be not seduced by him, which
were needless, if any open professed enemies of Christ, should be that
Antichrist. For there is no likelihood that any heathen man (a Jew or a
Turk) should deceive any multitude of true Christians, but he that under the
pretense of the name of Christ, seeks most of all to deface the honor of
Christ: he is a subtle adversary, and the very spirit of Antichrist. As
Saint John also, in his Epistle cap. 2. does testify.

It is clear therefore, that Antichrist is no Heathen Emperor, which was
never of the Church nor any false Prophet, that took upon him to teach in the
Church. The same may be said of Mahomet. But that the Pope is most evidently
Antichrist, upon the words of our Savior Christ, when he commanded that he
which had no sword should sell his coat, and buy one, signifieng the great
danger that was at hand, Lord said the Apostles here are two swords. These
words (says the Romish gloser) are the Civil and Ecclesiastical power, which
remained in Peter, and therefore his successors the Pope, has pre-eminence of
both. W. Fulke.

The marks to know Antichrist by.
Saint Gregory Gregory.
says: He is Antichrist that shall claim to be called the universal Bishop,
and shall have a guard of Priests Guard of Priests.
to tend upon him. Gregory. li. 4. Epist. 38. Sacer.

Again he says, Ego fidenter dico, etc. I speak it boldly: whosoever calls
himself the universal Priest, or desires to be so called (as does the Pope)
in the pride of his heart, he is the forerunner of Antichrist. Grego. li. 4.

Again in the same place he says: The king of pride (that is Antichrist) is
coming to us, and an army of Priests is prepared, which thing is wicked to be
spoken.

S. Barnard Barnard.
says thus: Bestia illa. etc. That beast that is spoken of in the book of
Revelation unto the which beast is given a mouth to speak blasphemy, and to
keep war against the Saints of God, is now gotten into Peter chair, as a
Lion prepared unto his pray. Bar. epis. 125. page 311.

Antichrist shall cause all religion, to be subject unto his power. Hierom.
Hierom aglasiani.

The greatest terror and fury of his Empire, Sibilla.
and the greatest woe that he shall work, shall be by the banks of Tiber.

The place of Antichrists reign.
Daniel the Prophet describes the four Monarchs of the world, 4. Monarchs.
under a similitude of four Beasts, that is to say the Empire of Babylon
which was of the Assirians. The Empire of the Persians, of the Grecians, and of
the Romans. And out of the fourth Beast (that is to say, out of the head of
y^ Monarch of Rome, sprang a little horn, that is to say, Antichrist himself)
who has so advanced his might and power, that he has broken the power, both
of the other horns, and also the Empire of Rome, and has prevailed against
the godly. The same thing Paul the Apostle confirms saying: Before
Antichrist be revealed, and appear very strong, there must be a daparting or
going away, that is to say, the people must fall away from the obedience of the
Emperor. Moreover John in his Apocalips setting forth the Church of Rome unto
us, to be, not the spouse of Christ but of Antichrist, says. That he saw a
certain whore the mother of all uncleanness and abomination of all the
world, holding a golden Cup in her hand, of whose mingled liquor, all the
dwellers of the earth should be made drunk, from the highest to the lowest.
And further, this whore shall be made drunk with the blood of Saints, and of
the Martirs of Christ, and upon her forhead she had written Babilonia. And
least any man should doubt, whether John speak of Rome or not, he says
plainly that the Whore sat upon seven hills, 7. Hills.
which thing is well known to be agreeable unto Rome, whereupon it is called
the City with seven hills, wherefore Antichrist seat must be at Rome, which
thing is evident both by holy scripture, and also by Hierom in an Epistle he
wrote to Fabiola against Iouinian, to Marcello and Aglasia, in the 47. Chapter
of his Commentaries upon Esaias, and in the second Chapter upon Ose. The same is
confirmed by authority of Tertulian, writing against the Jews and the
Gentiles, in a book of the resurrection of the body, and of Saint Austen also
in his book De ciuitate Dei. In the same opinion is Nicolaus de lyra, and many
other beside. Bar. Ochine.

Of Antichrists disciples.
Saint Paul foretells of Antichrists disciples. Hiero. i^ ^Ier. cap 7. li. 2.
1. Timo. 4. that they shall bear a great countenance of continent life, and
forbid marriage. And of such Saint Hierom says: Iactant pudicitiam suam
inpudenti facie: They make brag of their chastity, with whorish
countenance. Jewel.

Of Antichrists progeny.
Antichrist was the son of a certain wicked person called Sin, having to
his mother a certain woman called Perdition, who caused him to be brought up
of a corrupt nursse called dame Falsehood the daughter of Satan. The person of
this Antichrist, is not simple, but compounded of two natures, that is to say
diabolical and human, as Jesus Christ is compounded both of divine and
human. And as of God and man is made one Jesus Christ, so of the Devil and
of the Pope, is made one Antichrist. And as Jesus Christ is the head of the
believing Church, which is his body, so is Antichrist likewise, the head of
the malignaunt Church, which is his body, and does receive of him being her
head, all manner of corrupt humors running down into her. And because he is
borne into the world, only to be contrary to Jesus Christ, therefore all
his thoughts, all his will, all his works, all his doctrine, and briefly all
his life is repugnaunt to JESUS CHRIST, even to the drawing of his sword
against him. Albeit he would have the world believe, that he does all this,
for the better observing of Christian religion. F. N. B. the Italian.

Look more of Antichrist, in Rome. Pope.

ANTIPAS.
Of his faithful service to God.
ANtipas my faithful witness, Apoc. 2. 13
was put to death among you. It is a likelihood that this Antipas was some one
of the notable Ministers of the Church, whom the servants of Satan could the
less away with, because he taught Christ there, more earnestly and strongly
then other did, and stood more stoutly against the adversaries in defense of
the things which the true faith contains, and that is to be coniectured upon
this, that he calls him a faithful witness, such a one as Stephen was at
Jerusalem. And truly this name agreed very well unto him: for this word
Antipas is as much to say, as before or against all men. For nothing ought to
move a Christian heart, from the constancy of faith, and pure confession of
the truth, Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 44.

ANTROPOMORPHITAE.
What a kind of Heretics they were.
THese were Monks inhabiting the Deserts of Egypt, Heretics.
who affirmed that God had a body and members as a man had. And here upon it
rose says Socrates li. 6. cap. 7. that God ye father has been painted like an
old man in a graie beard. They were about the year of our Lord. 380.

The Antropomorphites persuaded themselves, that God might be known by the
senses, as men which did attribute unto God a humane body: but their opinion
is utterly rejected, for the holy scripture testifies that God is a spirit,
and it also puts a manifest difference between a spirit and a body, when
our Savior says: Feel and see, because a spirit has neither flesh nor
bones. And there is none which understands not, that a human body and his
members, cannot consist without flesh and bones. Further, their foolishness
hereby appears, because there is not a body found, which is every way pure
and simple: for let it be as equal as thou will, at the least way it has
parts whereof it is composed, and that all composition is against the nature of
God, even the Ethnicke Philosophers perceived, etc. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol.
118.

APPARICIONS OF SOVLES.

APELLES.
What his heresy was.
APelles was a Marcionite, Heretic.
he said that Prophecies were of a contrary spirit, he was guided by one
Philumena a woman. He thought it was not for men to reason of religion, but
every one to continue as he believed. Eusebius, li. 5. cap. 12.

How Tertulian confuteth his heresies.
Apelles the Heretic being in manner overcome with the foresaid reasons of
Tertulian, grants that Christ had indeed true flesh, but he denied that he
was borne, but brought from heaven: and he objected that the bodies which were
taken by Angels were true bodies, but they were not borne, such a body (says
he) had Christ. Tertulian answers hereunto: They, says he, which set forth
y^ flesh of Christ after the example of the Angels, saying that it was not
born, namely a fleshly substance, I would have them compare the causes also, as
well of Christ, as of the Angels, for which they came into the flesh. No Angel
did at any time therefore descend to be crucified, to suffer death, and to rise
again from death. If there were never any such cause why Angels should be
incorporate, then have thou a cause why they took flesh, and yet were not
borne. They came not to die, therefore they cannot be borne. But Christ being
sent to die, it was necessary that he should be borne, that he might die: for
none is wont to die, but he which is borne, etc. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol.
210.

APOLINARIS.
Of the heresies he fell into.
THis man was Bishop of Laodicia. Heretic.
Who notwithstanding he had written 30. books of our faith against Porphirius,
fell into heresy, saying that Christ received no flesh of the Uirgin Mary, but
that in the act of his incarnation^ some part of the word was converted into
flesh. He said that Christ's soul was not of that part that was rational, but
only of that part which kept the body living. And therefore in his incarnation
he took only the body and not the soul. Cooper.

APOSTLE.
What an Apostle is.
APostle, is an Ambassador, a Messenger, or one sent. And after this manner,
Christ is our Apostle sent of his Father. Tindale.

Who were Apostles.
Apostles are those chosen sort, which were sent by Christ himself to preach
the Gospel over all the world, confirming the same with miracles, and bearing
witness of Christ's resurrection: of which sort were the twelve. Mat. 10. 1.
into whose state Paul was called afterward. These being bound to no certain
abiding, went from country to country preaching Christ, and travailed as
ambassadors, to sundry nations, planting: Churches, and setting up Christ's
kingdom wheresoever they came. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 259.

How the Apostles were not called the heads of the Church.
Augustine in his third book, writing against the letters of Petulian denies
that the Apostle Paul, could be the head of the whom he had planted in the
faith of Christ, saying: O what a rashness and pride is this of man? Not heads
Why do thou not rather suffer, that Christ should always give faith, and
to make thee a Christian in the giving of it? Why do thou not suffer, that
Christ should be ever the beginning of the Christian man, and that the
Christian man should fasten his root in Christ, that Christ be the head of the
Christian man. For what time (...) the spiritual grace is bestowed unto the
believers, by the holy and faithful ministers, the Minister himself does not
justify, but he only of whom it is said, that he does justify the wicked.

For the Apostle Paul was not the head and beginning of them whom he planted,
nor Apollo the root of them whom he watered, but he which gave them increase,
as he himself says in the third chapter in the first Epistle to the
Corinthians: I have planted, Apollo has watered, but God has given increase.

So that not be which planteth is any thing, nor he which waters, but God
has given increase, nor he was not the root of them, but he rather which
said, I am the Uine, and you be the branches. And how could he be their head,
when he said, we being many are one body in Christ? And when he does report
most plainly in many places, that Christ himself is the head of the whole
body. This says Augustine. Musculus. fol. 261.

How the Apostles were equal with Peter.
Saint Cipriane Ciprian.
says. Non erant vtique and caeteri Apostoli, etc. The rest of the Apostles
were the same that Peter was all endewed with one fellowship both of honor and
of power. Yet the beginning is taken of one, to show that the Church is one.
Cipri. de simplicita. Prclatorum. Jewel. fol. 109.

Saint Hierom Hierom.
says: Dices super Petrum fundatur Ecclesia, etc. Ye will say the Church is
founded upon Peter. Notwithstanding in another place the same thing is done
upon all the Apostles: and all receive the keys of the kingdom of heaven:
and the strength of the Church is founded equally upon them all. Hierom,
aduers. Iouinia. li. 1. Jewel. fol. 107.

Origin Origen^
says: Quod si super vnum illu^ Petrum tantum, etc. If thou think the whole
Church was builded upon Peter, what will thou then say of John the son of
thunder, and of every of the Apostles. Origin in Math. tract. 1. Jewel. fol.
107.

S. Chrysostom Chrysostom.
of Peter says thus: Duplex crimen erat, etc. Peter was in double fault, both
for that he withstood Christ, and also for that he fell himself before the
rest. Chrisost. in Math. hom. 83.

S. Austen Augustin^
says: Inter se concorditer, etc. Peter and his fellows lived agreeable
together. August. Epist. 86.

Again he says: Christus sine personarum, etc. Christ without any choice of
persons, gave the same authority to Paul to minister among the Heathen, that
he gave to Peter among the Jews.

The ordinary gloss Glos.
says thus of Saint Paul: Non didici, etc. I learned not of ( Peter and)
others, as of my betters: but I had conference with them, as with equals and
friends. Glos. Gal. 2. Jewel. fol. 107.

Paul himself says: Gal. 2. 9.
James, Peter and John that seemed to be pillars, gave unto me and Barnabas the
right hands of the fellowship, which the gloss expounds thus: Societatis,
etc. O^ fellowship, that is, of equality. Jewel. fol. 107.

How the Apostles had wives.
Have we not power to lead about a wife being a sister, 1. Cor. 9. 5
as well as other Apostles, and as the Brethren of the Lord, and Ceyphas. This
text cleerelie proves, that Peter and other Apostles had wives, and wherefore
then should it be unlawful for Priests to marry, they are no better, nor no
holier then the Apostles were. But here will some say, that the Apostles had
wives before that Christ did choose them, but afterward they forsook their
wives, and followed Christ, which thing is not true, that they forsook their
wives, for that had been plainly against the doctrine of their master Christ,
which taught the^ not to forsake their wives, but in any wise to keep them,
saving only for fornication. And this place of S. Paul: Have we not power,
etc. does prove how S. Peter after his Apostleship, and also other disciples of
Christ, carried their wives about with them, when they went a preaching
wherefore it is a false lie that they had forsaken them. D. Barnes.

Eusebius in the third book of the Ecclesiastical story in the 27. chapter,
reports Clements Clement.
words thus: Clement whose words we have here marked, writing against them
which despise marriage says these words: Do they also disallow the Apostles,
for Peter and Philip had wives, and gave their daughters, to be married unto
men. And also Paul the Apostle is not ashamed to make mention in a certain
Epistle of his own make and companion, Phil. 4. 3.
and to greet her, whom he said that he led not about with him, that he might
be the more ready and comberlesse to preach the Gospel.

I do not backbite the other blessed men, which were coupled in matrimony,
Ignatius.
of whom I made mention now. For I wish, that being worthy of God, I may be
found in his kingdom at their feet as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: as Joseph,
Esaias, and other Prophets were. As Peter and Paul, and the other Apostles,
which were coupled in marriage, which had wives, not to fulfill the (...)s of
the flesh, but to have issue and posterity(...) Ignatius in Epist. ad Philadel.

Erasmus in his annotations upon the fourth Chapter of the Epistle to the
Philipians reports the witness of Ignatius on this wise: The holy Martyr
Ignatius in an Epistle to the Philedelphians does plainly grant, that not
only Peter but also Paul and other of the Apostles had wives. And that they
had them in no less reputation therefore, because Patriarchs and Prophets were
married, not for lusts sake, but for childrens sake. Chrysostom Chrisosto^^
grants that there were some which reckoned that Paul did speak unto his
wife, but dissenteth showing no cause of his dissension. But to whom it is more
right that we should stick to Clement and Ignatius, of which the one was Saint
Peter's companion, and the other was Saint Mark the Evangelists disciple, or
shall we better believe Chrysostom, which was so long a space after the
Apostles time. Thus far Erasmus.

Of four manner of Apostles.
Paul an Apostle not of men, Gal. 1. 1.
and. There be four manner of Apostles or Messengers. The first, which were
neither sent of men, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, as was Esaie the
Prophet and Paul himself. The second of God, but by man, as Joshua was
ordained of God, but by Moses which was a man, The third sort, are such as by
favor or money, to get y^ room of Ministers. The 4. are false Apostles, and
Apostles of whom S. Paul writes on this wise: such false Apostles do fashion
them selves, as though they were the Apostles of Christ, Iere. 14. 14
and dare say, This says the Lord, whereas the Lord has not sent them. Sir.
I. Cheek.

How we are warned to take heed of false Apostles.
Such as say they are Apostles and are not. Apoc. 2. 2.
That is to say, such as brag that they be sent of God: to the end they
may the eas^ier beguile the rechlesse and simple sort. And are not, that is to
wit, no true Apostles, but false teachers, sent of themselves and not of God,
according as the Lord complains of the false prophets by his Prophet ^eremie.
14. 14. Here we see how Satan is wont to take upon him the shape of an
Angel of light, according as Paul says 2. Cor. 11. 14. After y^ same manner
do his Ministers also, when they vaunt themselves of the name of Apostles, as
for example, Himmineus and Alexander. 1. Ti. 1. 20. And also Philogus and
Hermogenes. 2. Tim. 1. 15. and therefore does Paul the Apostle also commend the
^aith and constancy of the Ephesians, in that they gave no place, but rather
stoutly withstood the doctrine of ye false Apostles. Ephesians. 1. 15. Marl. upon
the Apoc. fol. 32.

AQ^AR II.
THese were heretics Heretics
which offered water in the Sacrament in steed of wine. August. li. de haerel.

ARCHBISHOP.
How this name is approved.
POlidore Virgil. li. 4. de m^entoribus rerum. cap. 12. says, that Clement in
his book entitled, Compendiarum christiana religionis, testifies y^ the
Apostle Peter did in every Province appoint one Archbishop, whom all other
Bishops of the same Prouencie should obey. He says also, that the same
Archbishop was called Primas Patriarcha, and Metropolitanus.

In those days (says Eusebius Eusebius.
) John the Apostle and Euangeli^^, whom y^ Lord loved, lived as yet in Asia,
which did govern the Churches there, after he was returned out of y^ I Will from
banishment, after the death of Domitian, and a little after he says y^ he went
being desired, Ad vicina Gentium loca, etc. Unto the places of the Gentiles
adioining, partly that he might appoint Bishops, partly that he might
establish whole Churches, partly that he might by lot choose such into the
charge, as the holy ghost should assign. So that whether he had the name of
Archbishop or no, certain it is that he had the government and direction of
the rest. I. W.

Cipriane, Cipri. li. 1.
speaking of the office of an Archbishop, says thus: Neque enim aliunde
haeroses abo^^e etc. Epist. ad 3. Cornelium
Neither have heresies or scismes risen of any other occasion, then of that
that the Priest of God is not obeyed neither one Priest for the time in the
Church, and one judge for the time in the steed of Christ thought upon, to
whom if the whole brotherhood, would be obedient according to Gods teaching, no
man would move any things against the College of Priests.

Cornelius being Bishop of Rome, and having excommunicated certain notorious
wicked men, and afterward being threatened and ill used at their hands:
Cipriane hearing thereof, wrote comfortablie unto him, and willed him in any
wise to proceed: showing further, what sects and schisms ensues in any
Province or Diocese, whereas the Bishops authority is despised. For in these
words he speaks not of the usurped authority of the Bishops of Rome over all
Churches, but against the insolency of some, which despising their
Metropolitan or Archbishop, did with their factiousnesse trouble the Church.
For he would have an Archbishop in every Province, which should bear the
chief rule over the rest of the Clergy, and so do the godliest and best
learned expound Cipriane. I. W. fol. 354.

Cipriane writing to one Florentius. Pupianus, speaking in his own behalf
being Bishop of Carthage, says on this sort: Vnde scismata, etc. From whence
has heresies and schisms sprung heretofore, and whereof spring they now, but
that the Bishop which is one, and governs the Church, by the presumptuous
disdain of certain is despised, and a man preferred by Gods allowaunce, is
examined and judged by unworthy men. For it is the chief and principal
office of an Archbishop, to keep unity in the Church, to confound
covetousness, to redress heresies, schisms, factions, to see that Bishops
and all other of the Clergy which is under him, to do their duties, etc. I.
Whitegift. fol. 155.

Calvin Calu. cap. ^ Sect. 54.
in his Institution says on this sort, that every Province had among their
Bishops an Archbishop, and that the Counsel of Nice did appoint Patriarchs,
which should be in order and dignity above Archbishops, it was for the
preservation of discipline: Therefore for this cause especially, were those
degrees appointed, that if any thing should happen in any particular Church,
which could not there be decided, it might be removed to a Provincial
Synod, from whence there was no Appeal, but unto a general Counsel.

This kind of government some called Hierarchiam, an improper name and not
used in the Scriptures: For the spirit of GOD will not have us to dream of
Dominion and rule in government of the Church. But if (omitting the name) we
shall consider the thing it self, we shall find that these old Bishops did not
frame any other kind of government in the Church, from that which the Lord
has prescribed in his word. Calvin here mistiketh this name Hierarchia, but
he allows the name and authority of Patriarchs and Archbishops, and thinks
the government of the church then used, not to differ from that, which God in
his word prescribes. I. W. fol. 417.

In the Ecclesiastical estate, we take not away the distinction of ordinary
degrees, such as by the Scripture be appointed, or by the Primative Church
allowed, as Patriarchs or Archbishops, Bishops, Ministers and Deacons, for of
these four, we especial read as chief: In which four degrees as we grant
diversity of office, so we admit the same also diversity of dignity: neither
denieng that which is due to each degree, neither yet mainteining the ambition
of any singular person, for as we give to the Minister place above the Deacon,
to the Bishop above the Minister, to the Archbishop above the Bishop, so we see
no cause of inequality why one Minister should be above another Minister: one
Bishop in his degree, above another Bishop to deal in his diocese: or an
Archbishop above another Archbishop. And this is to keep an order duly and
truly in the Church, according to the true nature and definition of order by
the authority of Augustine. lib. de ciui. Ordo est parium dispariumque rerum
sua cuique loca tribuens dispositio. M. Fox.

ARCHDEACON.
When the Archdeacons began.
THe Archdeacons began then to be created, when the plenty of the goods,
Epist. ad Nepo. Epis. 10. (...)
required a new and more exact manner of disposing them: albeit Hierom does
say, that it was even in hi^ age. In their charge was the sum of their
revenues, possessions and store, and the collection of the daily offerings.
Whereupon Gregory declares to the Archdeacon of Salon, that he should be
holden guilty, if any of the goods of the Church perished, either by his
fraud or negligence. But where as it was given to them to read the Gospel to
the people, and to exhort them to prayer, and whereas the power admitted to
deliver the Cup in the holy Supper, that was rather done to garnish their
office, that they should execute it with more reverence, when by such signs
they were admonished, that it was no profane Bailiwicke that they exercised,
but a spiritual function, and dedicate to God. Calvin. 4. li. cha. 4. Sect. 6.

Damasus calls Stephen, an Archdeacon. Hierom in his Epistle Ad Euagrium has
this name Archdeacon. Sextus in his decrees says that Laurence the Martyr was
an Archdeacon. Sozomenus. lib. 7. cap. 19. makes mention of an Archdeacon
reading the Scriptures, and these be his words: And this also is a strange
thing in the Church of Alexandria, whiles the Gospel are a reading, the Bishop
does not rise up, which I heard of others. This holy book, a Monk that is an
Archdeacon reads there, in other places Deacons, in many places, the Priests
only, but in principal Feasts Bishops. Socrates in the seventh book of his
Ecclesiastical history, speaks of one Timothy, an Archdeacon. I. W. Fol.

ARC.
What the Arc of covenant Arc of covenant.
was.
THis was a Cofer or Chest, made by Moses in the Desert, (five cubits in
length and three in breadth) wherein were put the Table of the old Law and
Rod of Moses, and part of Manna. It was made of strong wood and soote, and
covered as well within as without with fine gold. And on the top were two
Images of Angels, Cherubins. Cooper.

Tindale says it was a Cofer or Chest, as our Shrines, save it was flat. And
the example of ours was taken thereof. Tindale. fol. 11.

What is meant by the Arc of the Testament.
And the Arc of his Testament was seen. Apoc. 11. 19.
That is to say, Christ is now disclosed in the doctrine of his Gospel, and
in all the new Testament, in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
are bestowed. Col. 2. 3. Who has fulfilled the old Testament, and filled the
new. For Christ being man is the true Arc of the covenant, Arc of the
Testament.
because the whole fullness of the Godhead (lieng enclosed in him as in an Arc
or Chest) dwells in him bodelie. Col. 2. 9. At the beholding of whom, God is
become at one with us. For God the Father has set him forth to be the
atonement maker through faith, by the means of his blood. Romans 3. 25. In
respect whereof, he is also called the Atonement for our sins. 1. John. 2.
2. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 166.

Of the Ark of Noah.
The Ark of Noah, was a great Uessell, which God commanded Noe to make, that
he, his wife, his three sons, and their wives might be preferued from the
universal flood, the year of the world. 1652. And before the Incarnation.
2310. years. The Uessell contained in length. 300. Cubits Geometrical,
every Cubite containing as Saint Augustine says, six common cubits, which
is 9. foot. And so it was in length, two thousand seven hundred foot. And in
deepenesse from the upper deck to the bottom 30. Cubits, which was 270.
foot. And the roof over it was one Cubite, which was 9. foot. This Arc was
not by man's power brought into the Sea, but by the course of the waters rising
up, it was borne away: and rather by divine providence, then by man's policy,
it was governed from running to wrack. And Noe began to build this Arc, in
the 533. year of his age, and before the flood as Berosus says. 78. years.

ARMAGEDDON.
The interpretation of this word.
WHich in Hebrew is called Armageddon. In the Scriptures, places take their
names, Apo. 16. 16
either of some notable adventure, or by some notable mischaunce. As for
example, the Graves of lust in Nu. 11. 34. Meriboth, or the waters of strife.
Nu. 20. 24. And other like in the Scriptures. So also does Armageddon by
prevention in this place: which may be interpreted, the Army of wasting or
slaughter: representing even by the unlucky name of it, what shall be^all at
length to the army of Antichrist. Hierom (whom Aurigallus follows in his
Hebrew places) interprets Armageddon to be a certain Mountain where the
Israelites were wont to pitch their tents. Other think rather that Armageddon
should be called Gospel hill, or the Hill of glad tidings, or Apple hill, or
the Hill of choice fruits. And truly the Kings and Princes of the Earth, have
none other quarrel to fight against the godly, but only for Christ's
Gospel, whereunto all power ought to be subject. M^lorate upon the Apocalips.
fol. 233.

Armageddon. As if he would say, the craftiness of destruction, when as Kings
and Princes shall war against GOD, but by the craft of Satan are brought to
that place, where they shall be destroyed. Geneua.

ARM.
What is to be understood by the Arm of God.
THe Arm of God, Augustine.
signifies Christ, of whom Jeremy. 32. 21 writes thus: Thou have brought
the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt, with a mighty hand and
stretched out Arm.

By the Arm we understand the mighty power of GOD to save, for so Paul
defines the Gospel, that it is the power and might of GOD to salvation.
Neither is there any cause, but that also by the Arm of GOD, we may well
understand Christ: for as every man by the Arm does all things that he
does. So GOD by his word, creates, governs, and justifies, and therefore
his word, which is Jesus Christ, is called his Arm. Neither is this word Arm
applied only to a man, but also ye long snout of an Elephant, is called an
hand or an arm, for that by that instrument he works many things, etc. Pet.
Mar. fol. 325.

And his arm shall rule for him. Esa. 40. 10
His power shall be sufficient, without help of any other, and shall have all
means in himself to bring his will to pass. Geneua.

Where the Lord says, Esa. 52. 10
he has made bare his holy Arm, is as much to say, as he is ready to smite
his enemies, and to deliver his people. Geneua.

Therefore mine own Arm helped me. Esa. 63. 5.
God shows that he has no need of man's help, for the deliverance of his,
and though men refuse to do their duty through negligence and ingratitude,
yet he himself will deliver his Church, and punish the enemies. Read Chap. 59.
10. Geneua.

ARMINIANS.
Of their heretical and damnable opinions.
THese people were of the Countreie of Armenia, Heretics
and of late years christened, but now they be subject to the Turks.

They in some things erred from the Church of the Latins and Greeks. They
have one great Bishop, whom they call Catholicum. They celebrate much like unto
our fashion. They keep holy neither the Nativity of Christ, nor his Baptime:
saying, he needed not to be purged nor cleansed of sin. Also they took from all
sacraments the virtue to confer grace. They eftsoons baptize those that came
from the Church of the Latins to them, saying that we be not of the Catholic
faith, but they. They say, that no man may be christened, unless he receive
the Sacrament of the Altar: and that Infants need not to be baptized, affirming
that in them is no Original sin. That the holy Ghost proceeds of the
Father, and not of the Son. That the Sacrament of the Altar, may not be
consecrated of bread, clean without leaven. Also in the consecration, they put
no water into the wine. Moreover they say, that the receiving of the
Sacrament, profits only the body. That when Christ descended into Hell, he
led with him all that were there. That Matrimony is no Sacrament, and may be
dissolved at the will of the man or woman. That Christ did rise the Saterdaie
after good Friday. All these and other heresies are condemned by sundry
general counsels, and the consent of all Christendom. Eliote.

ARRIVS.
Of his heresy and lamentable end.
ARrius borne in Libia yet a Priest of Alexandria, hearing Alexander the Bishop
entreating curiously of y^ Trinity, thought verily that he maintained the
opinion of Sabellius, set himself against the Bishop, and said, that the son
of God had a beginning of essence, that there was a time when he was not, he
said that God was not always a Father, that the son was not from
everlasting, but had his beginning of nothing. Being called before the
Emperor, he would subscribe to the Nicene counsel and swear to. His deceit
was to carry in his bosom, his heretical opinion written in a piece of
paper, and when he came to the book, he would swear y^ he thought as he had
written, meaning in his bosom. His end was lamentable, for coming from the
Emperor after the oath he had taken, with great pomp through the street of
Constantinople, he was taken with sodeine fear, and withal he felt a laske,
immediately he asked of them where there was any house of office, thither he
went and voided his guts. As many as went by were wont to point at the place
with the finger, and say, in yonder Iakes died Arrius the heretic. Socrates.

the pure and sincere Christian faith. But shortly after, he fearing of the
power of Theodorich the king of the Ostrogothes, permitted the Arrians to turn
to their Churches.

About the year of our Lord. 591. Leonigildus king of Spain, slew his own
son Hermogile, because he would not consent to the heresy of Arrius. Cooper.

ARROWS.
What the Arrows of the Almighty are.
FOr the Arrows of the Almighty is in me, Job. 6. 4.
etc. The Arrows of the Almighty after some men's opinion, are the soreness
of his judgment, and his wrath: After some other they are the trouble which
the law moves in the hearts of men, while they thereby are stirred to hate
themselves, and so are healthfullie killed, as it is said Psalm. 38. 2. Some
again expound them to be the cross of misery and wretchedness, wherein God
had now wrapped him. For the Saints (say they) receive their cross of the
hand of God. The same will that this sentence be an increasing and amplifieng of
that which his adversary had fierslie laid against him. Eliphas in the
beginning of the fourth Chapter had said, that the plague was come upon him,
and had touched him. With this (say they) meteth he now. Behold, it not only
touches me, but wounds me with Arrows, and those venoumed with venom,
happily with the gall of Dragons, with which touching both my blood waxed wood,
and all my spirit is suppled up. Moreover, God has not only thrown these
darts upon me, but also his dreadful fears, that is, whatsoever he has
that is terrible lays he on me. T. M.

How Arrows, are sometimes taken ^or thunder and lightnings.
Then he sent his Arrows (that is to say, his lightninges) and scattered
them. Psalm. 18. 14.
Read Psalm. 77. 17. Geneua.

How they are sometimes taken for sickness.
For thine Arrows have light upon me. Psalm. 38. 2.
Thy sickness where with thou have visited me. Geneua.

ASIA.
What Asia is.
ASia is one of the three parts of the world, containing Asia the less, Lidia,
Caria, Bith^^^a, Galatia, Capadocia, Armenia, Cilicia, Sarmatia, Assiria,
Arabia, Persia, Hircania, Media, the two Indies, with many mo, as Ptolome
describes in his twelve Tables. Cooper.

Of whom Asia was first possessed.
Sem the first son of Noe, Prince of Asia, called also of some Melchisedech,
a just and peaceable King, a Priest of Almighty God, from whom Christ
liniallie descended, possessed Asia with his children. For of Elam came first
the Persians: of Assure the Assirians: of Arphaxat the Chaldeans: of Lud the
Lidians, and of Aram the Sirians. Grafton.

ASKING.
The manner of asking of God.
THis says David Kimhi, was the manner of asking of God. He which would
enquire concerning any public affair, or otherwise of any weighty matter,
came unto the Priest, and he putting on an Ephod, stood before the Ark of the Lord. In the Ephod or in the breast plate were. 12. precious stones, wherein
were written the name of the twelve Tribes, And there were also set the names
of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And in those stones were all the letters of the
Alphabet. The asker ought to turn his face unto the Priest, and to ask, not
in deed so apertlie that his voice should be heard, neither yet so softly,
that he should only think in mind the things which he^ desired, but in
such sort as we read that Hanna prayed in the first book of Samuel, where it
is said, that she moved her lips only, neither spoke she any thing that
could be heard. Then was the Oracle given on this manner unto the Priest. By
the power of the holy Ghost certain letters appeared above the other in the
breast plate, and that either in place or in brightness, wherein the Priest
read the Oracle and will of God. And these things are those Vrim and Thumim,
which the Priest bare in his breast lap. This is Kimhies opinion, unto whom,
what faith is to be given I cannot tell, for it might be that the spirit of
God, did without letters give Oracles, by the voice of the high Priest, whose
heart he inspired with prophecy, etc. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. 272

Of whom we ought to ask our petition.
Uerily verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye ask y^ father in my name, Ioh.
16. 23^
he will give it unto you. He says not whatsoever ye ask the Father in the
name of Saint Peter, Saint Paul, or other Saints, but in my name. Let us ask
therefore help in the name of him which is able to obtain for us of his
Father whatsoever we ask: least peradventure, hereafter in the end of the
world at the straight judgment, we shall hear: Hitherto in my name ye have
asked nothing. Bilney in the book of Mar. fol. 1139.

How Christ asked what men did say of him.
He asked of his Disciples saying: Mat. 16. 13.
whom do men say that I the son of man am. If any man (says Origin) be a
Bishop or a Magistrate, let him hardly ask this question: what do men say
of me: but this they must ask of them, that will tell the truth without
flattery. Cheek.

ASSVR.
How the people of Assiria took their name of him.
THe Assirians which is a part of Asia, came of Assure, the second son of Sem,
which Assure (as Lyra says) would not rebel against God, with Nemroth in the
building of the tower of Babylon, but fled out of the land of Senhar into a
another far country, where he first inhabited, by reason whereof the country
took his name, and was called Assiria. In the which country he builded a
city, that in process was called Niniue, which city was so great, that it
was three days journey to go through it. Lyra.

What is meant by Assure in this place following.
Assure also shall be slain with the sword, not with a man's sword. Isay. 31. 8
The Prophet should here seem to prophecy of the great destruction that
happened unto Sennacherib. 2. Par. 32. 21. And Esaie. 37. 36. which was done by
the sword of the Angel, not by the sword of man, as ye may there see.
Sennacherib was the king of Assiria, and therefore is the destruction of the
Assirians which happened under him, signified by this word Assure. Some (because
the Prophet a little before in the Text^ moves the people to forsake Idols)
expound it thus: not by our Idols, not by our strength, not by man's help
(which all may be called the sword of man) shall our spiritual enemy (which
is signified by Assure) perish: but by the power of God, and the invisible sword
that cannot be seen, with which the Angel slew, an hundred, four score and
five thousand in one night. T. M.

ASTHAROTH.
What manner of Idol it was.
THis Idol ( Astharoth) was so called, because it stood to be worshipped in
the form of a Sheep. For a sheep in Hebrew is called Aschtor. And as it
appears by the fourth book of kings. Cap. 23. 13. it was an Idol of the
Sidonians, whereunto Solomon by the instigation of his wives, builded sometime
a Cappell, etc. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 68.^

ASTROLOGY.
What Astrology is.
Astrology is the knowledge of the natural order and disposition that God
has set in the stars and planets, to judge of the office, property, and
virtue, and to bring all to their end and use. Calvin.

The Astrologer is he that knows the course and motions of the heavens, and
teaches the same which is a virtue, if it pass not his bonds, and he become
of an Astrologer an Astronomer. Who takes upon him to give judgment and
censure of those motions and course of the heavens, what they prognosticate and
destiny unto the creatures of the earth, man, beast and other, what shall be
the temperature of the air, the condition of the earth, the state and success
of such fruit as it brings forth. By this knowledge they forespeake of
pestilence, and other discases, and sees the death of great men to come, and
such commotions and wars as shall follow between the Princes of the world.
And thus they say they know, by the course of the heavens. Whereas they see
the conjunctions of many planets, of figures, and fatal disposition and
quality, concur: by reason of whose influence into these inferior parts,
all those calamities must happen. Here they abuse not only the name of God,
and the natural discourse of reason which has comprehended the motions and
course of heavens, but also heaven it self, and attribute unto the heavens,
the thing that only apperteineth to God: To say the health of man, the
sickness of man, the plenty of the earth, and scarcity of the same, the
regument of common, and the life and death of governors thereof. Their
knowledge and practice in those things is nothing at all. For almighty God
has not made the heavens to that end and purpose, that man should learn of
them good fortune or ill, as it is plain. Genesis 1. In the second day, God made
the Firmament and superior Stars, which the text calls Rakiah, to this end
that it should separate the waters that be under the Firmament, from those that
be above the Firmament, and God called the Firmament heaven. In the fourth day
GOD made the Sun, the Moon, and the Star^es. And shows to what purpose and
end he made them, the one to have dominion in the day, the other in the
night, and God put them in the Firmament of heaven, to give light unto the
earth. These rule in the day and night, and put difference between light and
darkness, to divide the year into his ports, the Spring, Summer, Autumn, and
Winter. They are in signs likewise says the Text. The which the Husbandman
that tilleth and sows the ground, observes without superstition, to sow and
reap his corn. He casts it into the ground in the Winter, and receives it
again in the Summer. So does the Mariner make the revolution of the Moon,
his decrease and increase, whereby he knows the tides, the ebbes and flow of
the same. And the latter Physicians, Auicene, and Auerrois has likewise
assigned their use in man's body, therefore they appoint diversity of days in
the practice of Physic, one to be more apt for letting of blood then other,
to purge and to bane then the other. If they may be observed without
superstition, it may be suffered. So that notwithstanding that such as observe
not these latter rules, may both minister and receive medicines, for the
heavens were made to serve us, and not to master us, were created for man, and
not man for them. Therefore it is a false superstition to say, good or bad,
plenty, or scarcity, sickness or health, war or peace, depends of the
influence of the heavens, etc, Whooper.

Authorities against the abuse of Astrology.
Where are now thy wise men, that they may tell thee, Esa. 19. 12
or may know what the Lord of hoasts has determined against Aegipt. And yet
there was no part of Astrology but it was there. The Prophet does as it were
speak in despite against all them that meddle with it, saying that it is not
their office, to know the things which come to pass as they make profession.
Calvin.

Thou art warned in the multitude of thy counsels, Esa. 47. 13.
let now the Astrologers, the Stargasers, and Pronosticatours stand up and save
thee from those things that shall come upon thee: behold they shall be as
stubble, the fire shall burn them, etc.

The Chaldeans were most renowned in Astrology that ever were any: so that all
they which have thrust themselves into this curiosity, did borrowe their name
from them. Wherefore we see how God reproves and condemns them: and
pronounces plainly, that men cannot learn of the star, the mutation and
falls of kingdoms. And that he will punish the pride of them, which have
thrust themselves in, to enterprise it, etc. Calvin.

This says the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not afraid
for the signs of heaven, Iere. 10. 2^
though the heathen be afraid of such. God forbids his people to give
credit or fear the constellations and coiunctions of stars and planets
which have no power of themselves, but are governed by him, and their secret
motions and influences are not known to man, and therefore there can be no
certain judgment thereof. Deuteronomy. 18. 9. Geneua.

I destroy the tokens of the Southsaiers, and make them that conjecture
fools, Esa. 44. 25
and turn the wise men backward, and make their knowledge foolishness. He
armeth them against the Sothsaiers of Babylon, which would have borne them in
hand, that they knew by the Stars that God would not deliver them, and that
Babylon should stand. Geneua.

It is not without cause (says Austen) Augustine.
that men supposes, that when the Astrologers do merua^lousie in their
answers declare many truths, the same is done by a secret instinct of wicked
spirits whose care is, to fasten and confirm in men's minds, these false and
hurtful opinions of starrie destinies, and not by any art or cunning of the
noting and beholding of the birth star, for there is no such art at all.
August of the City of God. li. 5. Chap. 7.

Look there be no deuiner, which does divine and foretell things, Deu. 18. 10
be found among you: nor obseruer of day, nor that has respect to birds nor
witch, nor coniurer which does conjure, nor any which does counsel or ask
counsel of familiar spirits, nor coniuring the dead: for all that so do, are
abomination unto God. Look more in Stars.

ASTRONOMY.
What Astronomy is.
THe true Astronomy that can be bidden by, by learning, is no more but a
coniecturall science, it is no demonstratiue science no more then Physic is.
And, yet both well used are very good. But to color witchraft, sorcerie, and
familiarity with the devil, with the name and color of Astronomy as some
do, is a devilish and a damnable practice, condemned by the word of God in a
thousand places, would have man wholly and only to trust in Gods promises,
and in his governance, and so to let the judicial Astronomer and palmisters
go like limbs of the devil which deny Gods providence. R. Turnar.

The first inuenter of Astronomy.
I find alleged by Berosus, that Noe had an other son, (beside Sem) borne
after the flood, who was named Ionithus, or Ionichus, which was a great
Astronomer, and was the first that atteined to the whole science of Astronomy,
and thereby did divine and show before what should after happen to the four
principal Monarchies of the world. He was also schoolmaster to Nemroth, who
began the building of the tower of Babylon, and at that time all the people of
the world spoke but one tongue. Graston in his Chro. fol. 13.

AVE MARIA.
A new Aue Maria of Pope Sextus making.
IN English thus: Hail Marie full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art
thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus Christ: and
blessed is Anna thy mother, of whom thy virgins flesh, has proceeded without
blot of original sin. Here is three things to be noted: First, how the Pope
turns improperly into a prayer, which properly was sent of God for a
message or tidings. Secondly, how the Pope adds to the words of Scripture,
contrary to the express precept of the Lord. Thirdly, how the Pope exempteth
Marie the blessed Uirgin, not only from the seed of Abraham, and Adam, but
also from the condition of a mortal creature. For if there be in her no
original sin, then she bears not the Image of Adam, neither does she
descend of that seed, of whose seed evil proceeds upon all men and women
to condemnation, as Paul does teach. Romans 5. 12. wherefore if she descended of
that seed, then the infection of original evil, must necessarily proceed
unto her. If she descended not thereof, then she comes not of the seed of
Abraham, nor of the seed of David, etc. Again, seeing that death is the
effect and stipend of sin, by the doctrine of Saint Paul, Romans 6. 23. Then
had her flesh injury by the law (as Christ himself had) to suffer the
malediction and punishment of death, and so should never have died, if
original sin had no place in her, etc. Book of Mar. fol. 925.

AVENGE.
How we ought not to avenge our selves.
Avenge not thy self. As a Father over his children is both Lord and judge,
forbidding one brother to avenge himself on an other, Romans 12. 19
but (if any cause of strife be between them) will have it brought to
himself, or his assigns, to be judged and correct: so God forbids all men
to avenge themselves, and takes the authori^^ and office of auenging unto
himself, saying: vengeance is mine, and I will reward. Deuteronomy. 32. 35. which
Text Paul alleges. Romans 12. 19. For it is impossible that a man should be a
righteous and equal, or an indifferent judge in his own cause, lusts and
appetites, so blind is our affections in us. Moreover, when thou auengest thy
self, thou make not peace, but stirs up more debate. God therefore has
given laws unto all Nations, and in all lands has heeput lungs and
governors, and rulers in his own stead, to rule the world through them, and
has commanded all causes to be brought before them, as thou read. Exo. 22.
Tindale.

AVIMS.
What this word does signify.
AVims was a kind of Gyaunts, and the word signifies, crooked, unright, or
weaked. Tindale, fol. 15.

AVRICVLAR CONFESSION.
Look Confession.

AXE.
What is meant by this Axe, that John speaks of here.
NOw also is the Axe put to the root of the tree. Mat. 3. 10.
The judgment of God is at hand, to destroy such, as are not meet for his
Church. Geneua.

Some do expound it thus: The Axe is the power of the Romans, which were the
iustruments of God to destroy utterly, the wicked and unfaithful generation
of the Jews. Sir I. Cheek.

BAAL.
What Baal was, and what the word signifies.
OF which never man bowed his knee to Baal. 3. Reg. 19. 18.
Baal was (as some think) a common name of all strange Gods, because it
commonly signifies Lord or Master, and thereof took the Gods of the
Gentiles their names, as Baal Phegor, or Phogor, or Baal Peor, that is, the
Lord or Master, or Phegor, etc. T. M.

Baal signifies as much as Master or patron, or one in whose power an other
is, which name the Idolaters at this day give their Idols, naming them
patrons and patronesses or Ladies.

Beza.
What Baal Berith was.
And made Baal Berith their God. Iudic. 9. 4.
In this place is particular mention made of Baal Berith, Baal berith
which a man may call Iouem faederis, or Iouem faederatum, him made they
(meaning the Israelites) a God over them, and worshipped him for their God. The
worshipping of him seems to be this, that they referred all the good things
which they had, as received of him, and they believed that he turned away from
them those evils which they were not troubled with. By reason of which faith,
they counted him for their God, and worshipped his outward Image. Pet. Mar.
upon. Iudic. fol. 155.

What Baal Peor was.
They joined themselves also to Baal Peor. Psalm. 106. 28.
Baal Peor Baal Peor
was the Idol of the Madianites, but why he was named so, it is not fully
agreed upon. Truly ( Bagual) imports as much as a a patron or advocate, and
because ( P haguar) signifies to open, some interpret it, the God of opening,
and they add, that the cause was, for that they destroyed their privy members
before him: which thing I dare not avouch for certeintie. And it may be, that
it is the name of some place, according as we know, that oftentimes the
heathen men gave their Idols the names of the Countries. Cal^^^e upon the Psalm.

BABEL.
What Babel signifies.
BAbel signifies confusion or mirture. It was the name of a Tower builded by
Nemroth, Genesis 11. 9.
before the incarnation. At the building hereof was the first confusion of
tongues. This was done in the land of Sennaar, in the Countreie of Chaldea,
Eliote.

For what intent the Tower of Babel was built.
The land was of one language, at the building of the Tower of Babel, which
Nemroth and his people began to build, intending that the top thereof
should have touched the Heaven, wherein they might have saved themselves, if
any Deluge should afterward have happened. But God seeing their pride and
rebellion, confused so their language, that every one spoke in such sundry
speeches, that one understood not an other, whereby of necessity, the work
was left unfinished. Lyra.

BABYLON.
What Babylon signifies.
Babylon the great City. Apoc. 14. 8
Babylon signifies Rome, for as much as the vices which were in Babylon, are
found in Rome, in great abundaunce: as persecution of the Church of God,
oppression and slanders, with destruction of the people of God, confusion,
superstition, idolatry, impiety. And as Babylon the first monarch was
destroyed, so shall the wicked kingdom of Antichrist have a miserable ruin,
though in be great and seems to extend throughout all Europe. Geneua.

Why Babylon is called an hill.
Behold I will come upon thee thou noisome hill. Iere. 51. 25
Babylon is called an hill, although it stood in a low place, and no hills
about it, for that her walls and buildings were so great, and hie as
mountains. The Bible note.

Not that Babylon stood on a hill or mountain, but because it was strong, and
seemed invincible. Geneua.

The description of Babylon, and how it was won.
In the land of Sennaar, that is in the land of the Chaldes, in a great plain
was Babylon builded in process of time, mightelie and strongly augmented with
rich pallaices, pleasant houses, strong walls and towers, called the head
City and Empire of all the world, so celebrated, and standing inuict, with
many glorious victories, by the space of. 1495. years, having the whole world
under their dominion. It was builded four in square, three thousand paces over
from wall to wall. The wall was. 200. foot high, and. 500. foot broad. And yet
was every foot longer by three fingers then ours. It was in circuit without
the outward walls. 480. furlonges. It was double walled with many high and
strong towers, and by a marvelous craft and labor, the flood Euphrates was
brought to run round about it, betwixt and without the walls, and through
many places of the city. It is so described of the ancient history writers,
as of Joseph, Pliny, Herodoto, Orosio, as no City else to be like it. But
this so mighty a City and golden head, when the king Balthazar with his
nobles were feasting and banketting in the night in most security, for that
they thought their City to be inexpugnable. Then came king Cyrus and laid
siege to Babylon. He dug up the banks of Euphrates, and turned the flood
clean from the City, so that without peril he might with his host enter
in, and then having the king of Babylon in such drunkenness and security, he
slew him and took the city. In that City yet (as it is left) there
remains the Temple of Jupiters Image called Bele, the finder of the Syderall
science, or else is there none other memorial or scant any vestigie thereof.

How Babylon is fallen three manner of ways.
She is fallen in wealth and riches, Her Abbeies, Monesteries, Nunries,
Frieries, Hospitals, Chauntreis, Churches, and Chappelles now overthrown, and
made even with the ground. All lands, Jewels, Ornaments, and great treasures
that belong to the same, are clean taken away from them. She is fallen in
power and authority: for the kings of the earth, which sometimes were subject
to that monsterous beast, yea, the most part of the ten horns, which were all
the kings and potestates of the earth, which gave over their power and
authority unto the same beast, that acknowledged the Pope for their sovereign
Lord, do now hate and abhor that harlot of Rome, and do withdraw their
subjects obedience from her. She is fallen (and that chiefly) in the credit
of her doctrine: For^ besides so many states of Christendom and Princes that
by public authority have received the Gospel, and utterly abolished all
Babilonicall doctrine, even in the midst of her bloody tyranny and
persecution, great multitudes are so lightened with the^hri^ht beams of the
Gospel, y^ for all inquisitions impris^nments, exquisite torments, and cruel
burnings that can be devised, they never a whitte diminish, but mightelie
increase, as God has promised, that the blood of the Martyrs should be the
seed of the Gospel. W. Fulke.

How Babylon is called the wast Sea.
This is the heavy burden of the wast Sea. Esaias. 21. 1.
By the wast sea is understood Babylon, it is so called because of the
exceeding great cruelnesse and tyranme, wherewith it exercised the Jews.
Hereof is there a proverb: Babylon is the Sea of evils, and even the wast of
the Sea, that is the most tempestious and desolate place, and that is least
possible to be sailed through. T. M.

How the destruction of Babylon was prophesied long before.
Thou shall bind a stone to it, lere. 51. 63
and cast it in the midst of Euphrates. Saint John in his Revelation alludeth
to this place, when he says: Apo. 18. 21
The Angel took a Millstone and cast it into the Sea, signifieng thereby the
destruction of Babylon. His words be these: Then a mighty Angel took up a
stone, like a great millstone, and cast it into the Sea, saying: With such
violence shall the great City of Babylon be cast, and shall be found no
more. That is, It shall not be like to other Cities which may be builded
again, but it shall be destroyed without mercy. Geneua.

Look more of Babylon in the word ( Rome.)

BACK PARTS OF GOD.
What is meant by the back parts of God.
ANd thou shall see my Backepartes: Exo. 33. 23
but my face shall not be seen. Shall see my backparts. That is: so much of my
glory, as in this mortal life thou art able to see. Geneua.

Death is the haven, that carries us to the place where we shall see GOD face
to face, which we shall never see so long as we be in this mortal life, but
must cover our faces with Moses and Helias, till the face or forepart of the
Lord be gone by. Now must we look on his Backepartes, beholding God in his
words, and in his creatures, and in the face of Jesus Christ our Mediator.
But when this body is dissolved by death, we shall see God face to face, and
know him as we are known. Luther.

BAPTIME.
The right signification and use of Baptime.
BAptime which is now come in the room of circumcision, signifies on the one
side, how that all that repent and believe are washed in Christ's blood: and on
the other side, how that the same must quench and drown the lusts of the flesh
to follow the steps of Christ. Tindale. fol. 6.

Baptime is a sign of repentance and of forgiveness of sins, whereby God
does testify, that he washes away or forgiueth the sins of them that
believe, and also whereby God does seal and admonish us of true repentance, all
the days of our life. Cheek.

All we which have been baptized into Jesus Christ, Romans 6. 3.
have been baptized into his death. That is, that sin through Christ's death
may be abolished and die in us, and that as we are made clean outwardly
with water in our Baptime, so inwardly our sins may be washed away, and
cleansed by the blood of Christ. The Bible note.

Baptime is an outward sign, representing in us the ^enuing of the spirit, and
mortifieng of our members in Jesus Christ, by the which we are buried in death
with him. Tind.

Baptime is a Sacrament by the which Jesus Christ does offer unto us the
remission of our sins, and our regeneration under the figure of the water, as
he does indeed communicate the same unto us, by his holy spirit. Also it
testifies unto us, that he receives us into his Church, as true members of
the same. And we for our part do testify that we acknowledge him, for such a
one, as he declares himself toward us, and that we believe that he makes us
partakers of all his great riches. Pet. Viret.

By Baptime wherewith we be washed out wardlie, is signified that we be washed
inwardly by the blood of Christ, the remembrance whereof, all the Apostles
endeavored to work in the minds of the faithful. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol.
11.

How we be washed by baptime.
Whereas Saint Paul says we be washed by Baptime, his meaning is, that GOD
does thereby both witness our washing, and therewithal perform the thing
that is figured. For except the truth or performaunce of the thing, went
jointly with the sign of it, it were an improper speech to say, that Baptime
is the washing of the soul. And by the way, we must beware that we put not
over that thing, either to the sign, or to the minister of the sign, which is
proper to God only, that is to say, that we think not the minister to be
the author of washing us clean, or the water to purge the filthiness of our
soul. Which to do belongs only unto Christ's blood. Again, we must take
heed that no piece of our trust do stick either to the water or to the man,
for as much as the only right use of the Sacrament is, to lead us
straightly by the hand unto Christ, and there to stay. For it is only the
holy Ghost that renueth and quickens us, and no creature or outward work is
able to bring that to pass. For if circumcision do nothing avail in Christ,
Gal. 5. 6. Surely neither avails it any man, to be but only dipped in
water, and to be admitted into the Church, except he have faith, that is
workefull by charity, which thing the pouring on of water perfourmeth not, for
then should all that be baptized be faithful: And therefore there is added,
Through the word. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 292.

How baptime brings no grace, examples follow
Baptime brings no grace with it, Act. 8. 21.
as does appear by Simon the Sorcerer. Tindale.

He has not put on Christ (says Saint Hierome) that has only received the
washing of the water, except also he receive the holy Ghost. Simon Magus
received water, but because he received not the holy Ghost, No grace.
therefore he put not on Christ Jesus. Paul here judges of Christians as a man
judges, but God does not measure and judge his faithful only by outward
signs, but by the inward thoughts and hearts. D. Heines.

Cornelius the Centurion, Act. 10. 44.
received the holy Ghost before he was baptized.

The gelded man of Queen Candace believed (and therefore had grace) before he
was baptized. Act. 8. 28.


Objection.
The Apostles being commanded to baptize in the name of the Father and of the
Son and of the holy Ghost: they notwithstanding baptized in the name of
Jesus Christ only.

Answer.
To baptize in the name of Christ, is to baptize according to the institution
and commandment of Christ, neither do these words in the name of Christ,
import that Baptime was ministered in the name of Christ only, and in none
other name beside, no more then these words, Paul the Servant of Jesus
Christ, do import, that Paul was the servant of Jesus Christ only, and so
not the servant of God the Father, nor of the Holy Ghost. Or these words that
Paul spoke unto the Keeper, Believe in the Lord Jesus, do discharge him from
believing in the other two persons of the holy Trinity.

Of the Baptime of Infants.
Note here, that the Fathers made a league with God, not only for
themselves, but also for their posterity, as God again for his part promised
them, that he would be the God, not only of them, but also of their seed and
post eritie, wherefore it was lawful for them to circumcise their children,
being yet Infants. And in like manner it is lawful for us to baptize our
little ones being yet Infants, forasmuch also, as they are comprehended in the
league. For they which have now the thing it self, there is nothing that can
let, but that they may receive the sign. It is manifestly written in the.
29. Deu. 29. 13.
Chapter of Deu. That the league was made not only with them which was
present, but also with them which was absent and not yet borne. Pet. Mar. upon
Iudic. fol. 75.

Concerning young children, because their faith is unknown to us, it is
requisite that they be partakers of y^ fruits of the sacraments, and it is not
very likely that they have faith because they have not the use of
understanding, except God do work in them extraordinarily, the which
appears not to vs^ nevertheless we cease not to communicate to them Baptime.
First, forasmuch as there is now the same cause in Baptime which was sometime
in Circumcision, which is called by Saint Paul, the seal of righteousness,
Romans 4. 1^
which is by faith, Ge. 17. 17.
and also by express commandment of God the male children were marked the
eight day. Secondly there is a special regard to be had to the Infants of
the faithful, For, although they have not faith in effect, such as those have
that be of age, yet so it is that they have the seed and the spring, in virtue
of the promise, which was received and apprehended by the Elders. For God
promises not us only to be our God, Ge. 17. 7.
if we believe in him: but also that he will be the God of our offspring and
seed, yea unto a thousand degrees, that is to the last end. Therefore said Saint
Paul that the children of the faithful be sanctified from their mothers womb.
By what right or title then do they refuse to give them the mark and
ratification of that thing which they have and possess already. And if they
allege yet further, that although they come of faithful Elders or parents, it
follows not y^ they be of ye number of the elect, and by consequent, and they
be sanctified, (For God has not chosen all the children of Abraham and Isaac.
Romans 9. 7.
) The answer is easy to be made, that it is true all those be not of the
kingdom of God, which be borne of faithful parents, but of good right we
leave this secret to GOD for to judge, which only knows it, yet,
notwithstanding we presume ^^stlie to be the children of God, all those which
be issued and descended from faithful parents according to the promise.
Forasmuch as it appears not to us the contrary. According to the same we
baptize the young children of the faithful, as they have used and done from the
Apostles time in the Church of God, and we doubt not but God by this mark
(joined with the prayers of the church which is their assistaunt) does seal
the adoption and election in those which he has predestmate eternally,
whether they die before they come to age of discretion, or whether they live to
bring forth the fruits of their faith in due time, and according to the
means which God has ordained. Beza.

The place alleged of the An^baptists is in the Acts, Act. 8. 37.
where the Eunuche was not permitted to be baptized, before confession made of
his faith. The answer is made thus, that that was done to the Eunuche, must
not be drawn to the Infants of Christians, rashly to keep them from Baptime,
which only is to be observed in stra^ngers to religion, and those that are of
full age, For we affirm that such as are strangers from the Church of Christ,
(as sometimes were the Jews and Gentiles, and as are at this day the Jews
and Turks, and other such like) ought not to be baptized until they have made
profession of their faith. But the reason of Infants borne of Christians, is of
a far other sort and case, for they are accounted among the children and
household of the Church, by reason of the law of Covenant. They be holy, and
Christ commands them to be brought unto him. It is manifest they please God,
because their Angels always, see the face of the father. And although our
capacity cannot conceive their state and condition, yet Christ testifies they
have faith, and that they have the Holy Ghost, the examples of John Baptist
and others teach us. Gualter. fol. 385.

How baptime is no baptime but to the child.
Christ bid the Church to baptize in the name of the Father, Mat. 28. 19
the Son and the holy Ghost: If a Priest say these words over the water,
and there be no child to be baptized, these words only pronounced do not
make Baptime. And again, Baptime is only Baptime to such as be baptized, and
not to any other standing by. As Baptime is no Baptime, but to the child that
is baptized, and not to the standers by: so the Sacrament of the body, is no
Sacrament, but to them that worthelie receive. Whereas Saint Austen says, that
Infants are baptized In Fide Susceptorum, in the faith of their Godfathers, yet
in so saying, he means of the faith of Christ, which the Godfathers do, or
ought to believe, and none otherwise. John Philpot in the book of Martirs.

Significations of baptime.
As the people of God (in the time of Joshua) were conveyed through the water of
Iordane into the Land of promise, Iosu. 3. 15.
following the Ark of God, which the Priest bare before them, even so are all
we that believe in Christ, conveyed out of the Kingdom of Satan, into the
Kingdom of God by Baptime, following our Arc Christ, which is gone before us.
The passing of Helias through the water of Iordane, and so lift up into
Heaven, does signify in a shadow to us, 4. Re. 2. 8.
that our passage into Heaven, should be made by Baptime.

The cleansing of Naaman the Sirian in the Water of Iordane, 4. Re. 5. 14
from the filthy Leprosy, at the commandment of Helias, does prefigure unto
us, the spiritual cleansing from sins to be made by Baptime, through the
inward working of the holy Spirit, That Baptime should be a figure of Christ's
death, burial and resurrection is proved by that he termed his passion by the
name of Baptime, when he answered the children of Zebedy on this wise: Can ye
be baptized with the Baptime that I am baptized withal. Hemmyng.

Considerations of baptime.
We must be fully resolved that our Baptime is a certain most free
ensealement and Sacrament of our atonement with God, and that this atonement
is made by the blood, death, and resurrection of Christ, and to put us in mind
of the mortifieng of the flesh, of the quickening of the spirit, and continual
repentance, and of the glorifieng that shall be hereafter by Christ. It must
also put us in mind, that the benefit of regeneration, is the gift and work
of the whole Trinity, in whose name we are baptized, to the intent we should
stick thereunto, and worship it all our life long. Hemmyng.

How baptime purifieth and cleanses.
Baptime has also his word and promise, which the Priest ought to teach the
people, and christen them in the English tongue, and not to play the
Popengaie, with Credo say ye, Volo say ye Baptismum say ye, for there ought
to be no mumming in such matter. The Priest before he baptiseth, asks,
saying: Beleeuest thou in God the Father Almighty, and in his son Jesus
Christ, and in the Holy Ghost, and that the Congregation of Christ is holy,
and they say, yea. Then the Priest upon this faith baptiseth the child, in
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy Ghost, for the
forgiveness of sins, as Peter says. Act. 2. The washing without the word
helps not, but through the word it purifieth and cleanses us. As thou
read. Ephe. 5. 26. Now Christ cleanses the Congregation in the Fountain of
water through the Word. The Word is the promise that God has made. Now as
Preachers in preaching the word of God saves the hearers that believe, Word.
so does the washing in that it preaches and represents unto us, the promise
that God has made unto us in Christ.

The washing preach unto us, that we are cleansed with Christ's bloudshedding,
Washing.
which was an offering and a satisfaction for the sin of all that repent and
believe, consenting and submitting themselves unto the will of God. Plunging
into the water.
The plunging into the water, signifies that we die and are buried with
Christ, as concerning the old life of sin, which is Adam. And the pulling
out again, signifies that we rise again with Christ in a new life, full of
the holy Ghost which shall rule us and guide us, and work the will of God in
us, as thou s^est. Romans 6. 4. Tindale. fol. 143.

To be baptized in Christ what it is.
To be baptized in Christ is nothing else, then according to his commandment
and institution, to be imitated. And by this form of speaking is signified
that we do pass into Christ, to the end we may be more straightly joined
together with him in faith, hope and charity. Christ's souldiars.
For even as Soldiers do swear to the name of obedience of their Captain,
and are so bound unto him, that afterward it is not lawful for them, to be
conversant in the Camp of their enemies, which thing if they do, should be
death unto them. So we in Baptime are bound unto Christ, and do swear that we
will never afterward fall away unto the Devil, etc. Pet. Mar. fol. 143.

To be baptized in Moses, what it is.
Whereas in the Epistle to the Corinthians, 1. Co. 10. 2
it is said, that the Fathers are baptized in Moses, the sense of that place
is, that the Israelites passed over the Sea, trusting to those promises which
were set forth of God by Moses. Pet. Mar.

Moses being their guide or minister, Moses.
or as some read, they were baptized unto Moses Law, other by Moses. Geneua.

To be baptized by the holy Ghost, what it is.
To be baptized by the holy Ghost, Act. 11. 16^ Holic Ghost.
is to receive the visible graces and gifts of the holy Ghost, or to be
endued with the graces of the holy Ghost. The Bible note. Geneua.

To be baptized over the dead, what it signifies.
Baptized over the dead. 1. Cor. 15. 29. Dead.
Some men say, that in token of the general resurrection, certain Christian
men were baptized over dead men's graves, signifieng that the same dead men,
should rise at the last day. Tindale.

That is as dead, and because they were but newly come to Christ, would be
baptized before they died. Except these things be true of Christ's kingdom and
his subjection, what shall become of them, whom the Church daily baptiseth,
for to destroy death in them, which is the end of Baptime, and so they to
rise again. Geneua.

Among the Corinthians, if any had deceased before he could be baptized, some
did take in hand to be baptized for them, thinking that the same should be
available unto the dead, against the resurrection. Tertulian, Theophilactus,
Ambrose. Though Saint Paul did not allow this superstition, yet thereby did he
take an occasion to confute them, which among the Corinthians denied the rising
again of the dead. I. Cheek.

What John's Baptime signifies.
Indeed I baptize you with water to amendment of life. Mat. 3. 11.
The outward sign puts us in mind of this, that we must ^haunge our lives
and become better, assuring us as by a seal, that we are ingraffed into
Christ, whereby our old man dies and the new man rises. up. Beza.

Of dipping in Baptime.
As touching the dipping down of the child that is to be baptized, Dipping.
I think (says Musculus) it is not so necessary, but that the Church is at
liberty to baptize, either by dipping in, or else by sprinkling. We may see in
Augustine, that this liberty was ^ept in the Churches: He that is (...)
baptized (says he) does confess his^ aith before the Priest, and does
answer as he is asked, (...). And after his aunswering he is either sprinkled
with water or dipped into it. And Cipriane does uphold the use of sprinkling in
Baptime, but yet so, that he says it is at men's liberty. Masculus. fol. 29^.

Of the Sacrament of Baptime.
The Sacrament of Baptime (says the Master of the Sentences) does consist in
two things, that is to say, in the Word, and in the Element, so that although
that the other things be away, which were instituted for the better
beautifieng of the Sacrament, Word and Element.
in case that the Word be there and the Element. For both in this, and in other
Sacraments also, there are accustomed to be done some things to the beauty,
comeliness, and some things which belong to the substance and cause of the
Sacrament. The Word and the Element be of the substance of the Sacrament, the
rest is applied to the solemnity of it. Thus says he. Of which (says
Musculus) I like well, that he does acknowledge that the wholenesse and
substance of Baptime does consist in two things, that is to wit, the Word and
the Element. And that the Sacrament is true and holy, if it have these two
things, though the rest be away. But whereas he does refer the rest, unto
beauty, comeliness, and solemnity, what follows thereof else, but that John
and the Apostles did baptize neither beautifullie, nor comely, nor Colemnlie:
for as much as they used none of these things. Musculus. fol. 291.

How Baptime is taken, in this place. following.
Baptime which now saves us. 1. Pe. 3. 21
By Baptime here do diverse learned Interpreters understand, the blood and
Passion for a figure, taking the sign for the thing signified thereby, for
this does baptime signify unto us, besides other things, that as we are there
washed with water, so are our sins washed away with the shedding of Christ's
blood. For Saint Peter shows, that we are saved by Baptime, not by washing
away of the filthy flesh, but by the examination of a good conscience in God.
Tindale.

BARCHOCHEBAS.
BArchochebas a Captain of the Jews, alluding unto his name, affirmed that he
was the Light or a Star come down from Heaven to comfort the Jews. He led
them to rebellion, so that (as Dion. Cass. in Adriano writes) there were slain
of them above fifty thousand. Eusebius. li. 4. cap. 6.

BARIESV.
Of the craft and subtlety of this false Sorcerer.
THey found in the City of Paphos a certain Sorcerer, Act. 13. 6
a false Prophet which was a Jew, named Bariosu. Bariesu, that is by
interpretation, Jesus son.

Even this name had this Sorcerer gotten to blind the world withal, as now
our Sorcerers and Coniorers, when they go to work, they fall to crossing, and
praieng with all holy words, to deceive the people withal, making them to
judge that they rather talked with God then with the Devil. And Elimas was his
name by interpretation says the Text, which (as Erasmus affirms in his
Paraphrasis) sounds as much in the Sirians language, as great and false
Prophet. Tindale.

This Jew being a false Prophet and a Sorcerer, went about to pervert and
turn from the faith, Sergius Paulus the Deputy. Paul the Apostlo reprehended
him, so that the Sorcerer was smi^^ten with blindness, and the Deputy
converted, of whom Paul^ borrowed his name. Act. 13. Beda.

BARREN.
What a reproach it was to women that were barren.
To take from me my rebuke among men. Luk 1. 25.
For it was a chief blessing of God to be fruitful in children. Genesis 7. 3.
Exo. 23. 26. Psalm. 127. 3. 128. 4. Because it was a multiplieng of the Lords
people, and fulfilling of Gods promises. Genesis 14. And therefore was taken among
the Jews, for a reproach to the Barren. The Bible note.

For the Barren women enioied not the promise which God made to them that were
married to have issue: but principally they were deprived of that promise,
which God made to Abraham that he would increase his seed. Geneua.

How barren mothers have brought forth excellent men.
And his name was Manoah, whose wife was Barren. When God decreed to send any
notable and excellent man, Iudi. 13. 2.
he very oftentimes stirred him up out of a Barren woman.

Which thing also we see come to pass in Sampson, likewise in Samuel and John
Baptist, and in very many other, that it might manifestly appear to be
altogether the work of God. Barrenness among the Hebrews, was a thing
ignominious: but God because he would declare, that of things most
contemptible, he can bring forth things excellent, has very oftentimes done
after this manner. And that fault of barrenness was in this place in the
woman, and not in the man. For sometime it may be in both: but the Scripture
here pronounces it of the woman, and not of the man, Pet. Mar. upon Iudic.
fol. 200.

The meaning of this place following.
Then the children, whom the Barren shall bring forth unto thee, shall say in
thine ear, this place is too narrow, etc.

Some read: Yet shall the children of thy barrenness say in thine ear, etc.
The meaning is, when thou art most Barren, and have fewest of y^ faithful in
thee (that is to say, the twelve Apostles and a few of their disciples Jews
borne) by and by shall thou hear a noise, that these are increased to such a
number, that they shall not find place sufficient to dwell in: At the first
sermon of Peter, were there increased three thousand. Act. 2. 41. T. M.

A Prophecy of the Church, and why it is called barren.
Rejoice thou Barren that did not bear, Esaias. 54.^
etc. After that he has declared the death of Christ, he speaks to the
Church, because it should feel the fruit of the same, and calls her Barren,
because that in the captivity she was as a widow, without hope to have any
children. Geneua.

BARTHELMEVV.
Of his death and martyrdom.
THis Apostle is said to preach to the Indians, Apostle.
and to have converted the Gospel of S. Matthew into their tongue, where he
continued a great space, doing many miracles. At last in Albania a City of
great Armenia, after diverse persecutions, he was beaten down with staves, and
after being excordiate, he was at length beheaded. In the book of Mar. fol.
52.

BASILIDES.
What his heresies were, and who confuted them.
EVsebius writes, that one Agrippa Castor, Heretic.
a stout champion, and a famous writer of those times, published a confutation
of Basilides, disclosing all his Satanicall iugling. He was about the year of
our Lord 110.
Having displaied his secrecy, he reports that Basilides wrote. 24. books
upon the Gospel, faining unto himself Prophets, whom he called Barcabus and
Barcoph, and certain others never heard of before: Inuenting those barbarous
names, to amaze the hearers with all: teaching that indifferently things
offered to Idols mais be eaten: that in time of persecution, the faith with
perjury may be renounced: commanding silence after the manner of Pythagoras,
for the space of 5. years. And such like heresies of Basilides, the said
writer has plainly confuted. Euse. li. 4. ca. 7.

BASTARD.
What child is called a Bastard.
A Bastard is he, which cannot tell who is his father. Or if he can tell one,
whom it is not lawful for him to have to his father, as it is written in the
Digestes, De statu personarum, in the Law Vulgo concepti.

How bastards are not admitted to the inheritance of their fathers.
Chrysostom upon the Epistle to the Romans, when he interprets these words
(Now is the hour for us to rise from sleep) he vehemently inueigheth against
whoremongers. Why do thou sow (says he) that which is not lawful for thee
to reap? Or if thou do gather it is ignomious unto thee: for infamy will
thereby come, both to him which shall be borne, and to thee also. For he as
long as he lives shall be full of ignomie, and thou, both when thou art living
and when thou art dead shall be noted of filthy lusts, etc. Wherefore it is
ordained by ye laws that Bastards should not be admitted to the inheritance of
their fathers. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 177.

A Bastard shall not enter into the Congregation of y^ Lord. This was to cause
them to live chastely, Deuteronomy. 23. 2
that their posterity might not be rejected. Geneua.

If therefore ye be without correction, etc. then are ye bastards and not
sons. He concludes that they which refuse the Cross deny to be of the
number of Gods children, Heb. 128
but are bastards. Geneua. Read. Eccl. 40. 15, and 41. 5. 6.

BATHES.
How bathes without God, are of no force or virtue.
IF the Bathes that be in Swicerland^ in Iuliers, in Sicilie, in Valeria, in
England, and diverse other countreies, do help those that are diseased, the
same is to be attrributed to the goodness of God. For there is no earthly
things which have in them any force or virtue to help men, except they be made
effectual by the power of him is y^ Omnipotent. Nevertheless those benefits
which are given to us by means, are not to be contemned, neither ought we to
abuse them. For all the gifts of God ought to be used to the glory of God, to
our souls health, and for the necessity of our body. But we must always
beware that we do not ascribe that to Creatures, which belongs only to
God. Marl. upon John. fol. 147.

Of Bath, a certain measure.
And it contained two thousand Bath, 3. Re. 7. 26
Bath and Epha seem to be both one measure. Every Bath contained ten pottels.
The Epha contained in dry things, that which Bath did in liquor. Read. Eze.
45. 10. Geneua.

BEELZABVB.
An Idol whom the Philistines worshipped.
Go and enquire of Beelzabub the God of Ekron. 4. Reg. 1. 2.
The Philistines which dwelt at Ekron worshipped this Idol, which signifies
the God of flies, thinking that he could preserve them from the biting of
flies. Or else he was so called because flies were engendered in great abundance
of the Sacrifices that were offered to that Idol. Geneua.

If they have called the master of the house Beelzabub.

It was the name of an Idol, Mat. 10. 23
which signified the God of Flies, and in despite thereof was attributed to the
Devil, and the wicked called Christ by this name. Geneua.

BEHEMOTH.
What beast this is thought to be.
THe word Behema signifies simply a Beast, Job. 40. 1^.
and under that name are Oxen and al other Beasts comprehended. Here it is
said in ye plural number: Look upon Behemoth, whom I created with them and
although y^ word. Behemoth be the plural number in the Hebrew, yet it is
spoken wit of one Beast and no more. Howbeit forasmuch as God meant to betoken
here one sort of beasts: that is the cause why he sets Behemoth in the
plural number. Nevertheless, it cannot be coniectured, what kind or beast it is
that he speaks, except it be an Elephant by reason of the hugeness of that
beasts body, etc. Calvin upon Job. fol. 730.

The Hebrews understand by Behemoth the greatest beast in the earth, that is an
Elephant. Other understand thereby, any earthly beast that is great: but unto
an Elephant do all the properties here recited right well agree, wherefore it
seems most agreeable to the truth, that by the word by signified in Elephant.

BELIEVE.
What it is to believe.
TO believe is not to doubt of the promises of God: but rather to be fully
persuaded of the promises of God, that as God has promised, so shall it
undoubtedly chance unto us. Basil.

To believe, is certainly to be persuaded and assured in mind through the
holy Ghost, that by the Lord Jesus we are purged from our sins, and made the
children of God, that by his man's nature we are made pertakers of his
Divinity: by his mortality, we have obtained immortality: by his curse,
everlasting blessing: by his death, life, briefly that by his descending into
the earth, we ascend into heaven. Traheron.

To believe in the name of Christ, is to receive him as the Son of God, and
the Savior of the whole world, which is done of us, when we depend wholly
upon him by a sincere faith and trust and commit our selves wholly as
disciples unto him, etc. Marl. upon John fol. 18.

To believe in God, is to be sure that all thou have, is of him, and all thou
need must come of him. Which if thou do, thou can not but continually
thank him for his benefits, which continually without ceasing receiuest of
his hand, and thereto ever cry for help, for thou art ever in need, and
can no where else be helped. And thy neighbor is in such necessity also:
wherefore if thou love him, it will compel the^ to pity him, and to cry to
God for him continuatlie, and to thank as well for him as thy self. Tindale.
fol. 238.

How it is prophesied, that few will believe Christ's words.
Who will believe our report, Esa. 53. 1.
and to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed. The Prophet shows that very
few shall receive this their preaching of Christ, and of their deliverance by
him. John. 12. 38. Romans 10. 16. And that none can believe, but whose hearts God
touches with the virtue of his holy spirit. Geneua.

Lord who has believed our report. Romans 10. 16
Meaning the Gospel, and the good tidings of salvation, which they preached.
Geneua.

How men are driven to believe through the works of God.
Then believed they his works. Psa. 106. 1^
The wonderful works of God, caused them to believe for a time, and praise
him. Geneua.

The meaning of this place following.
He that believes shall not make have. Esa. 28. 16
He shall be quiet, and seek none other means, but be content with Christ.
Geneua.

I believed, therefore did I speak. Psa. 116. 10

BEAM.
What this beam signifies.
O Hypocrite, Mat. 7. 5.
cast out first the Beam that is in thine own eye, etc. Thou understand
all Gods laws falselie, and therefore thou keep none of them truly: his
laws require mercy and not Sacrifice: moreover thou have a false intent in
all thy works that thou do, and therefore are they all damnable in the
sight of God. Hipocrite cast out the Beam that is in thine own eye: learn to
understand the law of God truly, and to do thy works aright, and for the
intent that God ordained them, and then thou shall see whether thy brother have
a mote in his eye or not: and if he have, how to pluck it out, or else not.
Tindale. fol. 237.

BENEDICT.
Why he is set among the Heretics.
THis man was the first founder of the order commonly called Saint Benedicts,
Heretic.
and died says Volateran. li. 21. in the year of our Lord. 518. He was the
first and the only deviser of a several trade of life, within y^ first. 600.
years after Christ, and because he presumed to invent a new way, which all
the godly Fathers before him never thought of: I (says the Author) laid him
here down for a Schismatike, and couched him in this Catalogue of Heretics.

BERILL.
The description of Berill, and what is betokened thereby.
THe eight a Berill. Apo. 21. 20
This stone glittereth like water, when the Sun shines upon it, and it is
said to heat the hand of him that holds it. It betokens men enlightened
with the grace of the holy Ghost, which bring other to the love of heavenly
things, by preaching and teaching the same grace. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 300.

The Berill is of a pale green color, betokening those faithful persons,
which of Christian compassion, has dolorouslie lamented the fall of their
brethren. Of this godly nature was Steven, which prayed for them that stoned
him to death.

So was before his time Samuel, which mourned for Saul, when he saw him cast
out of the Lords favor. Bale upon the Apoc. fol. 100.

Berillus the Bishop of a Town in Arabia named Bustra, taught that Christ
neither was before his carnal nativity, Reduced from his heresy.
nor had any proper divinity, but only the Deity of God the father
dwelling in him: whom Origin confounded, and brought again to the unity of
the Church. Eusebius. li. 6. Chap. 32.

BEAST.
Of the beast that came out of the bottomless pit.
THe Beast that came out of y^ bottomless pit shall make war. Apoc. 11. 7
This Beast (that is to say Antichrist) is said to come out of the bottomless
pit, because that being engendered of the Devil, and starting out of the
innermost dungeon of hell, he is mounted up so hie in pride, that like as the
Giaunts went about in old time to drive their Jupiter out of heaven as the
Fables report: even so seems he to be desirous to thrust Christ the King of
all Kings from his Kingdom, John. 8. 44.
following the footesteps of his father Satan, who has been a murderer from
the beginning, and abode not in the truth. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 154.

Of the beast that rose out of the Sea.
I saw a Beast rise out of the Sea, Apoc. 3. 1.
having 7. heads, etc. By the 7. heads he means Rome, because it was first
governed by seven Kings or Emperors after Nero, and also is compassed about
with seven Mountains. Geneua.

This Beast is the Kingdom of Rome: The Cat of the mountain is the errors
and blasphemous vices of the whole world gotten in battle: The Bears feet,
Tyranny: The mouth of the Lion, is spoilefull and greedy to devour: wounded
by insurrections and civil war, until Dominion and governance came in one
man's hand. This other Beast that comes out of the earth, is the pomp of the
Romish Bishop. He pretends to be a Lamb. This is the second Kingdom of
Rome. S. I. Cheek.

How the number of the beast, notes the Popes coming.
Count the number of the Beast, for it is the number of a man. Number of a man,
Apoc. 13. 18
that is such as may be understood by man's reason. For about 666. years after
this Revelation, the Pope or Antichrist began to be manifest in the world,
for these Char^cters (...) signfie 666. and this number is gathered of the
small number (...), which in the whole make 666. and signifies Latinus or
Latin, which notes the Pope or Antichrist, who uses in all things the Latin
tongue, and in respect thereof, he contemns the Hebrew and Greek, wherein
the word of God was first and best written: and because Italy in old time was
called Latinum, the Italians are called Latini, so that hereby, he notes of
what Country chiefly he should come^ Geneua.

Of the beast the woman sat on.
I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast, etc. The Beast signifies
the ancient Rome. Apo. 13. 3.
The Woman that sits thereon, new Rome, which is the Papistrie, whose
cruelty and bloudshedding is declared by Scarlet. Geneua.

Look. Woman.

Of the miraculous coming of the beasts into the Ark of Noah.
When Noe with his wife, Genesis 7. 9.
and three sons with their wives entered into the Arc, sodeinlie there came
together to him, beasts of all kinds, not brought thither by man, but even by
the miracle of God Neither did Noe take them, but suffered them as they came to
enter: neither came any more of unclean beasts then two, a male and a female.
And of clean beasts 7. four Males, and three females, of which one male was
reserved for Sacrifice after the flood, the residue were kept for generation.
Lanquet.

God compelled them to present themselves to Noe, as they did before to Adam.
Genesis 2. 19. when he gave them names. Geneua.

Of the beast called Booz.
The property of this Beast is, Booz.
when he is pursued with hunters and hounds, not to defend himself with his
horns: but having a long bag hanging down under his chinne, wherein is
gathered much water, he defends himself therewith. For in his running and
chasing, the water in the bag then wareth so scalding hot, that when he casts
it upon the hounds that follow him, it scaldeth and burns them so sore,
that they are forced to give over their suite. Policro. li. ^. fol. 26.

Of four sorts of beasts.
Whatsoever parts the hoof, ^eu. 11. 3.
etc. He notes four sorts of Beasts. Some chewe the Cud only, and some
only have the foot cloven. Other neither chewe the Cud, nor have the foot
cloven. The fourth both chewe the Cud, and have the hoof cloven. The last may
be eaten. Geneua.

BETHEL.
Of the situation of Bethel.
BEthel is a place famous both for praise and dispraise, vii^. miles from
Jerusalem, on the right hand as one iourneith from Jerusalem to Sichar, or
Naples, because of the golden Calfe, which king leroboam set up. 3. Reg. 12.
29. The Jews of contempt called it Bethauen, that is the house of an Idol,
whereas Jacob gave it the name of the house of God. Genesis 28. 17.

How Bethel is both the name of a city and of a mount
That goes out from Bethel to Luz. Iosu. 16. 2.
Luz is thought to be a city, at the end of mount Bethel, which is also named
Bethel. Genesis 28. 19. And so Bethel is both the name of a City and of a mount,
The Bible note.

How Bethel and Bethauen, are not both one.
Which is beside Bethauen, Iosu. 7. 2.
on the East side of Bethel. Here it appears that Bethel and Bethauen were
two places and not both one. Although Bethel were after turned into Bethauen,
when the right service of God was turned into luore and to Idolatry. 1. Reg.
13. 6. Ose. 5. 8.

Bethel, Hierome.
that before was called the house of God, after that Ieroboams calves were set
up in it, was called Bethauen, that is to say, a house unprofitable, and the
house of an Idol. Hierom. in Ose. li. 1. Cap. 4

How Bethel is taken in this place following.
And came up to Bethel. Iudi. 20. 1^
Bethel in^ this place is not the name of a city, but is taken for the house
of God: and signifies a place where the Arc of the covenant remained. Pet.
Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 269.

Of two Bethels.
The same is Bethel. Which was in the Tribe of Ephra i^, Iosu. 18. 13
an other Bethel was in the Tribe of Benjamin. Geneua.

Of the finding of Jacob in Bethel.
He found him in Bethel, Ose. 12. 4.
and there he spoke with us. He found Jacob as he lay sleeping in Bethel. Genesis
28. 12. and spoke with him there, that the fruit of that speech apperteined to
the whole body of the people whereof we are. Geneua.

Of the peoples worshipping at Bethel and other places.
Come to Bethel, Amos. 4. 4.
and transgress to Gilgal, etc. He speaks this in contempt of them which
resorted to these places, thinking that their great devotion and good
intention, had been sufficient to have bound God unto them. Geneua.

But seek not Bethel nor enter into Gilgal, Amos. 5. 5
etc. In these places they worshipped new Idols, of which before time served for
the true honor of God, therefore he says that these shall not save them.
Geneua.

Read Ieromie. 48. 13.

BETHLEEM.
How Bethleem was made famous by the birth of Christ.
AND thou Bethleem in the land of Judah, Mat. 2. 6.
art not the least. Though thou (meaning Bethleem) be a small town, yet shall
thou be very famous and noble through the birth of the Messiah, who shall be
borne in thee. Beza.

Understand, because Christ was borne there. Bethleem betokens the
Christentie, which in the eyes of the world is little and vile, but in the eyes
of God is great and precious. Tindale.

And thou Bethleem Ep^rathah art little to be among the thousands of Judah. Mat.
5. 2.
For so the Jews divided their country, that for every thousand, there was a
chief Captain. And because that Bethleem was not able to make a thousand, he
calls it little. But yet God will raise up his Captain and governor therein
And thus it is not the least by reason of this benefit. Geneua.

BETHPHAGE.
What manner of village it was.
AND were come to Bethphage. Mat. 21. 1.
Bethphage was a little village at the bottom or foot of the mount Oliuete,
which was near to the city of Jerusalem, being distant from the same not
above two miles, as we may read in the first Chapter of the Actes^ Marl. upon
Math. fol. 458.

BETHSEDA.
What this word signifies.
BEthseda or as some writes Bethesda. John. 5, 2^
is as much to say, as a spittle or an hospital, whereas poor folks has their
being, which place was by a poole, where the Sheep that were offered in the
temple were kept. And the sick remained there, looking for the moving of the
water. T.

If signifies the house of pouring out, because the water ran. outby
conduits. Geneua.

Of this name there are diverse interpretations and diverse translations also,
for according to the Hebrew word, it is sometime called Betzaida, sometime
Bethesda, and other, while Betheder: whereupon some interpret this word to
signify the house belonging to the flock, and other some the place of
fishing. But their opinion is more probable which expound the same to the place
of effusion. For so much does the Hebrew word Eshed sound: but the Evangelist
has pronounced the two last silables thus, Esda (as Beth-esda) according to
the Chaldes tongue, which at that time was much used. It is very likely that
the water was brought to this place by conduct pipes. Also this place or poole
was called in latin, Probatica piscma, that is to say, the pond where the
Priests did wash ye sheep that should be sacrificed, for the Greek word (...)
or probation signifies a Sheep. Marl. upon John. fol. 145.

BETRAIENG.
What it is to betraie.
TO Betraie seems in Latin to signify three things, namely to bewraie, to
deceive, and deliver up. Proditio therefore is an action, whereby by guile,
bewraieng or delivering up our neighbor or their goods are hurt, and that
especially of those, which ought rather to defend the same. Pet. Mar. upon
Iudic. fol. 37.

BIBLE.
In whose days it was translated into our vulgar tongue. Saint Bede says,
Bid.
that one Cedman an English Poet translated the book of Genesis and Exodus,
with diverse other stories of the Bible into English Rhyme.

Likewise king Adelstone about a nine hundred years past, Adelstone
caused the whole ^ Bible to be translated into English.

S. John Treuisa says, that Bid himself turned Saint John's Gospel into
English. Also he says, Alured.
that Al^red caused the Psalter to he turned into English. Therefore it is
untruly said, that this I Will has continued thirteen hundred years without
having the Scripture in English. John Treuisa. li. 5. Chap. 24. and li. 6.
Chap. 1

Theodoretus writes thus: Theodoretus.
Ye may commonly see (says he) that not only the teacher of the people and
rulers of the Churches, but also Taylers, Smiths, and Clothworkers, and other
artificers do understand the principles of our religion. And further, y^ not
only learned women if there be any such, but also such women as live by their
labor, and sewsters and maid servants, but also husbandmen and dichers, and
heard men, and graffers, can reason of the holy Trinity, and of the creation
of the world, and of the nature of mankind, a great deal more skilfuller then
either Plato or Aristotle were ever able to do.

In Policronicon it is showed, how when the Saxons did inhabit the land, the
king at that time which was a Saxon, did himself translate the Psalter into
the language that then was generally used. Yea, I have seen a book at
Crowland Abbeie, which is kept there for a relic. The book is called Saint
Cuthlakes. S. Cuthlake Psalter.
Psalter, and I wene verily it is a copy of the same that the king did
translate, for it is neither English, Latin, Greek^, Hebrew, nor Dutch, but
somewhat soundie to our English. And as I have perceived since the time I was
last there, being at Antwarpe, the Saxon tongue does sound likewise after
ours, and it is to ours partly agreeable. Lambert in the book of Mar. fol.
1273.

BILNEY.
Of the comfort he had of his friends, and they of him, the night before he
died.
THe Fridaie at night, which was before the day of his execution, being Saint
Magnus day and Saterdaie, Bilney had diverse of his friends resorting unto
him, into the guilde hall, where he was kept. Among whom one of the said
friends finding him eating of an Albrew, with such a cheereful heart and quiet
mind as he did, said that he was glad to see him at that time so shortly
before his heavy and painful departure, so heartelie refresh himself: Oh
said he, I follow the example of the husbandman of the country, who having a
ruinous house to dwell in, will yet bestow cost as long as they may hold it
up, and so do I now with this ruinous house of my body, and with Gods
creatures in thanks to him, refresh the same as ye see. Then sitting with his
said friends in godly talk to their edification, some put him in mind, that
though the fire which he should suffer the next day, should be of great heat
unto his body, yet the comfort of Gods spirit should cool it to his
everlasting refection. At that word the said Thomas Bilney putting his hand
toward the flame of the candle burning before them (as also he did diverse times
beside) and seeling the heat thereof, O said he, I feel by experience, and
have known it long by philosophy, the fire by Gods ordinance is made naturally
hot. But yet I am persuaded by Gods holy word, and by the experience of some,
spoken of in the same, that in the flame they felt no heat, and in the fire
they felt no consumption. And I constantly believe, that howsoever the stubble
of this my body shall be wasted by it, yet my soul and spirit shall be purged
thereby: A pain for a time, whereon nowithstanding follows joy unspeakable.
And he much entreated of this place of Scripture, Noli timere, etc. 1 say. 43. 1
Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, and called thee by name. Thou art mine
own, when thou go through the water I will be with thee, and the strong
flood shall not overthrow thee: when thou walk in the fire it shall not
burn thee, and the flame shall not kindle upon thee, for I am the Lord thy
God, the holy one of Israel. Which he did most comfortablie entreat off, as
well in respect of himself, as appling it to the particular use of his
friends there present. Of whom some took such sweet fruit therein, that they
caused the whole said sentence to be fair written in tables, and some in their
books, the comfort whereof (in diverse of them) was never taken from them to
their dieng day. In the book of Mar. fol, 1131.

His answer to a proud Papist.
BIlney being demanded in dirision by a proud Papist, when he went to his
death, why he wrought no Myra^les (being so holy a man as he was accounted)
answered, with mild voice and countenance. God only (said he) works
miracles and wonders, and he it is that has wrought this one wonder in your
eyes, that I being wro^gfullie accused, falsely belied, opprobriouslie and
spitefully handled, imprisonned, buffeted, and condmned to the fire: yet
hitherto have I not once opened my mouth with one ill word against any of you.
This passes the work of nature, and is therefore the manifest miracle of God,
who will by my suffering and death be glorified, and have his truth enhaunced.

Of the Bill of diuorcement.

Look Diuorcement.

BINDING AND LOOSING.
What is meant hereby.
TO bind and loose is to preach the law of God and the Gospel or promises, as
thou may see in the third chapter of the second epistle to the Corinthians,
where Paul calls the preaching of the law, the ministration of death and
damnation, and the preaching of the promises, the ministering of the spirit, and
of righteousness. For when the law is preached, al men are found sinners, and
therefore dampened: And when the Gospel of glad tidings are preached, then are
all that repent and believe found righteous in Christ, etc. Tindale. fol. 150.

Whatsoever ye bind on earth, Mat. 18. 18.
etc. That is, whatsoever ye condemn, by my word in earth, the same is
condemned in heaven. And that ye allow by my word in earth is allowed in
heaven. Tindale.

In the. 16. Chapter, verse. 19. he meant this of doctrine, and here of
Ecclesiastical discipline, which depends of the doctrine. Geneua.

To bind is to banish the stifnecked and unrepentant sinner, from the
congregation of the Saints: to loose is (when he repents and submits
himself) to receive him again into the fellowship of the elect and chosen
people of God. Sir. I. Chee.

God in promising men the forgiveness of their sins, gives charge and
commission to the ministers of his word to draw them from death, according as
it is expreslie said, that the keys of the kingdom of heaven are committed
so those which preach the gospel, to what end? To forgive sins, not of their
own authority, but to the intent, that the wretched man be the better
assured of their salvation, and not doubt, but God receives them to mercy.
Call. upon Job. fol. 592.

BISHOP.
What a Bishop and his office is.
IF a man covet the office of a Bishop, 1. Tim. 3. ^.
he desires a good work, etc. Bishop is as much to say, as seer to, or an
over seer. Which when he desires to feed Christ's flock with the food of
health, that is with his holy word, as the Bishops did in Paul's time,
desires a good work, and the very office of a Bishop. But he that desires
honor, gapeth for lucre, thirsts great rentes, seeks pre-eminence, pomp,
dominion, coueteth abundance of al things without want, rest and hearts ease,
castles, parkes, Lordships, Earledomes, etc. desires not a work, much less a
good work, and is nothing less then a Bishop, as Saint Paul here
understands a Bishop. Tind.

How Bishops were chosen.
In choosing of Bishops, the people had their liberty long preserved, that
none should be thrust in, that were not accepted of all. This therefore was
forbidden in the counsel at Antioch, that none should be thrust in to them
against their will, Which thing also Leo ye first does diligently confirm.
Heerevpon came these saiengs: Let him be chosen whom the Clergy and the
people, or ye greater number shall require. Again, let him that shall bear the
rule over all be chosen of all. For it must needs be, ye he that is made a
ruler being unknown and not examined, is thrust in by violence. Again, let
him be chosen by the Clarks, and desired by the people: and let him be
consecrate by them of that province with the judgment of the Metropolitan.
The holy Fathers took so great heed: that the liberty of the people should by
no means be diminished, that when the general Synod gathered together at
Constantinople did ordeine Nectarius, they would not do it without the
allowance of the whole Clergy and people: As they testified by three Epistles
to the Synod at Rome. Therefore when any Bishop did appoint a successor to
himselfe^ it was none otherwise stablished, unless y^ whole people did
confirm it. Whereof you have not only an example, but also y^ very form in
Augustine in ye naming of Gradius. And Theodor^te when he reheraseth that Peter
was named by Athanasius to be his successor, by and by adds y^ the elders of
Priests confirmed it, and the magistrate and nobility and the people approved
it with their allowing shoute. Calvin in his insti. 4. ^. Chap. 4. Sect. 11.

Of the ordination of Bishops and Ministers.
The ordination of Bishops has nothing proper or peculiar, besides fruits and
commodities that necessarily depend thereof, for it is the decree of the Lord,
that of them to whom they minister the secrets and mysteries of the heavenly
life, they receive the things that belong to the necessary uses and
maintenance of this life. As Saint Paul plainly proves to the Corinthians.
1. Chapter. 9. from the. 4. verse to the. 15. And the 1. to Timothy. 5. 17.
and 18. And to the Gal. 6. 6. which thing also Christ teaches. Mat. 10. 10.
Luke. 10. 17. So ye this is the just and right law of God, that the Bishops
or ministers are to be maintained of the Churches: and such a measure is to be
kept, ye they be neither pressed with over great need, nor run riot with too
much excess, for in either of them a regard is to be had to the calling of a
Bishop, whom Saint Paul wills to be both watching and sober, and also modest
and herberous, and in 1. Cor. 9. proves that it is lawful for him not only
to eat and drink at the Corinthians, costs and charges, as in the. 4. verse.
But also to enterteine a wife, as in the. 5. verse, and generelly to live well
and honestly as in the. 14. verse.

Of unpreaching Bishops and Pastors.
The world (says Gregory) is full of Priests, Gregory.
but yet in the harvest, there are seldom workmen found: because indeed we
take upon us the office of Priests, but we fulfill not the work of the office.
Again, because they have not the bowels of charity they will seem Lords.
They acknowledge not themselves to be Fathers. They change the place of
humility into the aduauncing of lordlinesse. Again: But what do we, O
Pastors, we receive the reward and are not workmen? We are fallen to outward
business, and we take in hand one thing and perform an other: we leave the
ministry of preaching: and to our punishment as I see, we are called Bishops,
and keep the name of honor, but not of virtue. Call. in his inst 4. b. Chap.
5. Sect. 12.

How Bishops are unlike they were in Paul's time.
A great pity it is to see, how far that office of a Bishop is ^egenera^^
from the origi^^^ in the Scripture. It was not so at the beginning when
Bishops were at the best. As the Epistle of Paul to Tit. testifies, that
willed him to ordeine in every City of Crete a Bishop. And in case there
were such love in them now as was then toward the people, they would say
themselves there were more to do for the best of them in one City, then he
could do. They know that the primative Church had no such Bishops as be
now a days, as examples testify, until the time of Syluester the first, a
little and a little riches crept so into the church, that men sought more her,
then the wealth of people, and so increased within few years, that Bishops
became Princes, and Princes were made servants. So that they have set them up
with their alms and liberality in so high honor, that they cannot pluck
them down again with all the force they have. Whooper.

What regard Bishops ought to have in feeding the poor.
Many godly Bishops and ministers after the Apostles were so studious for the
poor, Read Palinus Bishop of Nola.
that they spent not only upon them the goods of the church, but also their
own patrimony, and when that would not serve, they labored with their own
hands, that by this means they might supply that which lacked, according to
the example of Saint Paul.

They hired not men to keep the poor out of their gates, but appointed men to
stand before their gates, after the example of Abraham and Lot, to call the
poor into their houses.

The glory of a Bishop (says S. Hierome) is to provide for the poor, Hierome.
but the ignominy of all Priests, to look for their own ease and profit.
Hierome de vita clericorum.

The Popes law says: Did. 81. (...) Episcopus.
Hospitality is so necessary for Bishops, that if they be found to be no
mainteiners thereof, they may lawfully be deposed Again, a Bishop to the
uttermost of his power ought to minister unto the poor, and to the sick,
which through weakness are not able to labor with their own hands, meat,
drink, and cloth.

A Bishop ought to have a liberal hand, he should help them which are in
need, Did. 86. ca fratrem.
and think other men's necessity to be his own necessity, if he be not thus
affected and minded, he bears the name of a Bishop in vain.

Bishops build houses in bigness not unlike to Churches. Hugo de Clastio. li.
1. cap. 1.
They have a great delight to have their chambers painted and set out with most
goodly and precious colors, and hanged with rich and costly clothes: but the
poor man goes naked. I may truly say, the poor are many times spoiled and
robbed, that stones and stocks may be garnished. They garnish their halls,
with great and mighty pillars: They set lodges before their doors, but would
God they were made to receive, and not to deceive the poor.

S. Hierom Hierom.
says, Let other build Churches, hang walls, make great pillars, and gylde
the tops of them, and deck Altars with gold and precious stones. But be thou
of another mind, I mean to cloth Christ in the poor, to feed him in the
hungry, to visit him in the sick, to receive in, them that want lodging,
specially in them that are of the householde of faith.

Saint Barnard Barnard.
likewise says: O vanity passing all vanities, and yet no more vain then
mad. The Church shines in the walls, and lacks in the poor. It garnisheth
her stones with gold, and leaves her children naked. That which should be
spent upon the poor, is bestowed to please the eyes of the rich. Thus much
(for this matter) out of the works of Theodore Basil.

Of the equality of Bishops.
ERasmus expounding S. Hieroms words says thus: Hieronimus aequare videtur
omnes Episcopes, etc. Hierom seems to match all Bishops together, as if they
were all equally the Apostles successors, and he thinks not any Bishop to
be less then other, for that he is poorer, or greater then other, for that he
is richer. For he makes the Bishop of Eugubium, (a poor town) equal with
the Bishop of Rome. And farther, he thinks that a Bishop is no better then a
Priest, saving that the Bishop has authority to order Ministers. Jewel. fol.
109.

S. Cipriane Cipriane
says: Nemo nostrum, etc. None of us appoints himself Bishop of Bishops,
much less the Prince of all Pastors. In Cons. Cartha.

Again, he says: that the authority of the Bishops in Africa is as good, as
the authority of the Bishop of Rome. And calls them all lewd and desperate
persons that will say the contrary.

The words of the Counsel of Africa: Ad transmarina, etc. Whosoever shall
think he ought to appeal to the Judgments beyond the Seas, that is (to the
Bishop of Rome) let no man within Africa, receive him to Communion.

Sain Peter calls Christ the Prince of Pastors, (and not the Pope) saying
thus: 1. Pe. 5. 4.
That when Christ the Prince of Pastors shall appear, ye may receive the
incorruptible crown.

In the Counsel of Constantinople it was decreed that the Bishop there, should
have even and equal authority with the Bishop of Rome. Jewel. fol. 112.

What is meant by these two names, Bishops and Deacons.
With the Bishops and Deacons, Phil. 1. 1.
grace be with you. By the Bishops are meant both the Pastors, which have the
dispensation of the word, Bishops and Deacons.
and the Elders that govern. And by Deacons are meant those that were stewards
of the Treasury of the Church, and had to look unto the poor. Beza.

By Bishops here he means them that had charge of the word, and governing,
as Pastors Doctors, Elders. By Deacons, such as had charge of the distribution,
and of the poor and sick. Geneua.

The Bishops oath to the Pope.
^. N. elect Bishop of N. from this time forth will be faithful and obedient
to blessed Peter, and to the holy Apostolic Church of Rome, and to our Lord
N. the Pope, and to his successors entering canoniallie. The Counsel which
they shall commit unto me, by themselves, messengers, or by their letters to
their hinderaunce, I will not willingly disclose to any man. I will be an
helper unto them, to retain and defend against all men the Popedom of Rome,
and the roialtie of Saint Peter. I will do my endeavor, to keep defend,
increase, and enlarge ye rights, honors, privileges, and authority of ye
Church of Rome, of our Lord ye Pope, and of his foresaid successors. Neither
will I be in counsel, practice or treaty, wherein shall be imagined against our
Lord the Pope himself, or the same Church of Rome, any sinister or prejudicial
matter, to their persons, right, honor, state or power. And if I shall
vderstand such things to be imagined or procured by any, I will hinder the
same, as much as lies in me, and with as much speed as conveniently I may, I
will signify the same unto our said Lord, or to some other by whom it may come
to his knowledge. The rules of the holy Fathers, the decrees, ordinances,
sentences, dispositions, reseruations, provisions and commandments Apostolica
I will observe with my whole might, and cause them to be observed of other.
Heretics, scismatikes, and rebels against our Lord the Pope, I will persecute
and to my ability fight against. Here is not one word of the Gospel neither
yet of Christ. Bullinger.

How by means of this oath, certain Bishops rebelled here at home against
their own Prince.
About the year of Christ. 1102. Ranulph Ranulph
Bishop of Durham excited Robert Curt^eise Duke of Normandy to war upon his
brother Henry the first (who favored nothing the usurped power of the Bishop
of Rome) for the crown of England, who assembled a strong army and landed at
Portsmouth: But by meditation, peace was made on this condition, that Henry
should pay. 3000. marks yearlie to Duke Robert.

About the year of our Lord. 1106. Anselme Anselme.
the Bishop of Canterbury (by whose means the Priests of England were
constrained to forgo their wives) strove with Henry the first, for the
inuestitute of Bishops, and giving of benefices.

About the year of our Lord. 1164. Thomas Becket Thomas Becket.
Bishop of Canterbury, strove with king Henry the second, for the liberties
of the holy Church, as he called them.

About the year of our Lord. 1045. in the seventh year of king Henry the
fourth, sir Richard Scrupe Richard Srupe.
Archbishop of York, and diverse other of the house of the Lord Mumbrey, for
grudge they bare to king Henry, gathered to them a great power of Scots, and
Northumbers, intending to have deposed him from all kingly authority, but he
had knowledge thereof, and made against them in so speedy wise, that he came
upon them unawares, and taking the said Bishop with his Alies, commanded them
to be beheaded at York. Cooper.

BLASPHEMY.
What blasphemy is.
Blasphemy is to withstand the truth, which a man knows, as did the
Pharisees, attributing the works of Christ unto the devil. Tindale.

To blaspheme, signifies among the divines to speak wickedlie, and among the
more eloquent Grecians to slander. Beza upon Mat. 9. 3.

But for thy blasphemy. John. 10. 33
The name of blasphemy the which profane writers use generally for every
kind of reproach, the Scripture refers unto God, when his majesty and his
glory is defaced. And there are two sorts of blasphemy, as either when God
is robbed of his proper honor (as if so be a man should arrogate y^ unto
himself which is proper to God) or else when any thing is attributed and given
to him, which his nature will not bear. Therefore they call Christ a
sacrilegious and blasphemous person, because he being a mortal man, usurped
to himself divine honor. And this was a true definition of blasphemy, if so
be Christ had been nothing more then a man. Only they sin in this, that
they refuse to behold the divinity which was evident to be seen in his
miracles. Marl. upon John. fol. 389.

Blasphemy is, to attribute that thing unto a creature, which is proper or
peculiar to God, as to forgive sins is proper unto God, who says by the
Prophet Esaias: I am, I am he that wipeth away thine iniquities, Esa. 43. 25.
for mine own name sake, etc. Of this place the Scribes and Pharisees argued
that Christ was a blasphemer, because he took upon him to forgive sins: which
no doubt had been a true argument, if Christ had been like unto the Scribes,
that is to wit, if he had been mere man, and not God also, etc.

What blasphemy of the holy spirit is.
Blasphemy of the holy spirit is, when men see and know the open and
manifest truth of God and his word, their conscience being fully certified
thereof. And yet notwithstanding will rail upon it, and persecute it to the
uttermost of their power, saying it is of the devil, and not of God, which
sin shall never be forgiven. Tindale.

Look Sin against the holy Ghost.

BLESS.
What it is to bless, and who be blessed.
To bless God, is to give him praise and thanks for his benefits.

To bless a king or a Prince, is to thank him for his kindness, and to pray
to God that he may long reign to the laud of God, and wealth of his Commons.

To bless a man's neighbor, is to pray for him, and to do him good.

To bless my bread and meat, is to give God thanks for it.

To bless my self, is to give God thanks, for his great benefits that I have
received of him, and to pray to God of his infinite goodness he will increase
those gifts y^ he has given me, unto his laud and praise, and as touching
this flesh, to fulfill his will in it, and not to spare it but to scourge, cut
and burn it, only that it may be to his honor and glory. This is ye form
of blessing, and not to wagge two fingers over us. I. Frith.

To bless in the Hebrew manner of speech, is nothing else but to with an
happy success and to desire good things for him. As Symeon when he blessed
Christ and his parents, showed by his affection, Luke. 2. 34.
that he wished well to the kingdom of their new king. Hemmyng.

The word bless, Psalm. 5. 12.
when we talk of men, signifies among the Hebrews to with well: and when it
is referred to God, it betokens as much as to give a man good fortune (as
they term it) or to enrich him abundantly, with all good things. For in as
much as Gods favor is workfull, his blessing brings forth of it self
abundance of al good things. Call. in the. 5. Psalm. verse. 12

To bless is to speak well, profess well, live well. S. Augustine Augustine
says: I will bless the Lord in all times, always his praise shall be in my
mouth. Chrysostom Chrysostom.
says: when God is blessed, and thanks be given of men unto him, then more
plentious blessing is wont to be given of him for their sakes, by whom he is
blessed. For he that blesses makes him debtor of a greater blessing.
Calfehill. fol. 116.

By blessing understand not the wagging of the popes or Bishops hand over thy
head, but prayer, as when we say, GOD make thee a good man, Christ put his
spirit in thee, or give thee grace and power to walk in the truth, and to
follow his commaundeme^ts, Genesis 14. 60
and as Rebeccaes friends blessed her when she departed, saying. Thou art our
sister, grow into thousand thousands, and thy seed possess the gates of their
enemies. And as Isaac blessed Jacob, Genesis 27. 28
saying: God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth,
abundance of corn, wine, and oil. And Genesis 28. 3. Almighty God bless thee
and make thee grow and multiply thee, that thou may be a great multitude of
people, and give to thee and to thy seed after thee, the blessing of Abraham,
that thou may possess the land, wherein thou art a stranger, which he
promised to thy grandfather, and such like. Tindale fol. 145.

What Gods blessings are.
Gods blessings are his gifts: as in the first Chapter of Genesis: he blessed
them, saying, Grow and multiply and have dominion. And in the. 9. Chapter, he
blessed. Noe and his sons, and gave dominion over all beasts, and authority
to eat them. And God blessed Abraham, with cattle and other riches. And Jacob
desired Esau to receive the blessing which he brought him, that is the present
and gift. God blessed the. 7. day. That is, gave it a pre-eminence that men
should rest therein from bodily labor, and learn to know the will of God and
his laws, and how to work their works godly all the week after. God also
blessed all nations in Abraham's seed, that is, he turned his love and favor
unto them, and gives them his spirit, and knowledge of the true way, and lust
and power to walk therein, and all for Christ's sake Abraham's son. Tindale.
fol. 5.

Who is blessed and sanctified of God.
He is blessed which keeps himself, that which he is by new birth, Apoc. 20.
6
that is to wit, which continues in walking in newnes of life, according to
the which Christ says. Blessed are they which hear the word of God and keep
it. Luke. 11. 28. Also, Blessed is he to whom the Lord imputes no sin, and in
whose heart there is no guile. Psalm. 32. 1. 2. Romans 4. 8. Marl. upon the Apoc.
fol. 276.

Blessed is that man of the Lord, yea, holy, just, and perfect, may he be
reported also of all men which has portion convenient in y^ first resurrection
with David, Magdalene, Zacheus, and Peter. Happy are they which hearing ye word
of God, retains it in their living, for they being renewed with ye glad
tidings of life, are depured by the spirit of Christ, sanctified, and so made
the habitacles of the holy Ghost. Bale upon the Apoc. fol. 59.

Some peradventure will ask, who be they that be blessed, and sanctified of
God, truly all they whom Christ has sanctified in his blood, and washed
their sins in his blood, that has faith, and does believe their sins
only to be taken away by Christ and his bloodshed, for their remission of
sins, and which will believe surely till they die. These be they which be
truly hallowed and sanctified in God the father, and these be holy and
blessed, The Bishops fingers cannot bless.
whether men do bless them or curse them. Other there be that be sanctified,
as of men, and of the Pope, of the Cardinals, of Bishops or Abbots, but these
be not holy nor blessed, except that Christ has sanctified them in his blood,
and has remission of their sins by Jesus Christ, which thing they believe
surely, or else they be not sanctified of God nor blessed, be they never so
oftentimes blessed of the popes holy hand, and all his three crosses, with all
the miters of his Cardinals and Bishops. Bibliander in the exposition of Jude.

Of the sacramental blessing.
Jesus took bread, Mar. 14. 22
blessed, etc. To bless is not to make a cross, but rather to give thanks as
he himself does express by and by, when he speaks of the cup. Again, where
Mark uses this word blessed, Matthew, Luke, and Paul do say, he gave thanks
both in Greek, and in the Latin. Sir I. Cheek.

And when he had blessed. Mat. 26. 26
Mark says, had given thanks: and therefore blessing is not a consecrating,
with a coniuring of murmuring and force of words: and yet the bread and the
wine are changed, not in nature but in quality, for they become undoubted
tokens of the body and blood of Christ, not of their own nature and force of
words, but by Christ his institution, which must be recited and laid forth,
that faith may find what to lay hold on, both in the word and the element.
Beza.

The cup of blessing which we bless, 1. Cor. 10. 16.
etc. When I spoke (says Chrysostom) of blessing, I spoke of thanksgiving:
and speaking of thanksgiving, I open all the treasure of the goodness of God,
and rehearse those great gifts of his. For with the cup we add the
unspeakable benefits of God, and whatsoever we have obtained. So we come unto
him, we communicate with him, thanking him that he has delivered mankind from
error, that when we had no hope, and were wicked persons, he admitted us
brothers and companions to himself: with those and such other rendrings of
thanks, we come unto him. Here ye see, what Chrysostom took blessing to be.
Calfehil. fol. 106.

What it is to bless the Lords name.
Blessed be the name of the Lord. Job. 1. 21.
We may not only pick out the words, but also consider of what mind they
proceed, and that they be spoken truly and unfeignedly, for how is it
possible that we should bless the name of God, if we do not first acknowledge
him to be righteous? But he that grudgeth against God, as though he were cruel
and unkind, cursseth God, because that as much as in him lies, he lifts
himself up against him. He that acknowledges not God to be his father, and
himself to be Gods child, ne yields record of his goodness, blesses not
God. And why so? For they which taste not of the mercy and grace that God
shows unto men, when he afflicts them, must needs grind their teeth at
him, and cast up, and vomit out some poison against him. Therefore to bless
the Lords name imports as much as to persuade our selves, that he is just and
righteous of his own nature: and not only that, but also that he is good and
merciful. Lo^ here how we may bless Gods name after the example of Job, that
is by acknowledging his Justice and uprightness, and moreover also, his grace
and fatherly goodness toward us, etc. Calvin upon Job. fol. 32.

Hereby he confesses that God is just and good, although his hand be fore
upon him. Geneua.

He that shall bless in the earth, Esa. 65. 16
shall bless himself in the true God, and he that swears in the earth,
shall swear by the true God. By blessing, and by swearing, is meant the
praising of God for his benefits, and the true worshipping of him, which shall
not be only in Judea, but through all the world. Geneua.

How this place of the Psalm is expounded.
And he shall receive a blessing of the Lord. Psa. 24. 5.
When he speaks of blessing, he does us to wit that not all they which in
title only vaunt themselves for worshippers of God, shall be pertakers of the
promised blessedness: but they that are aunswerable to their calling from the
heart Howbeit, it is a very effectual encouragement to godliness to and good
life, when ye faithful hear, that they misspend not their labor in following
righteousness, because there is an assured blessing laid up for them with
God. Calvin.

BLIND.
Who be blind.
ANd blind. Apoc. 3. 17
That is to say, one whom Christ enlighteth not, which knows not God, nor
Jesus Christ, whom he has sent. Concerninn blindness, see John. 9. 41. Also
he is called blind, which sees not how miserable and needy himself is.
Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 68.

Why God is said to blind men.
The cause why God is said to blind men, is for that when he has bereft them
of right understanding of mind, and of the light of his holy spirit, he
gives them up to the Devil, to be carried away, into a wilful wicked mind.
Romans 1. 28. and sends them strong illusions. 2. These. 2. 11. And so executes
just vengeance upon them by the minister of his wrath. Marl. upon the Apoc.
fol. 92.

God is said to blind men's eyes, so often as he does revoke or take away the
contemned light of his truth and sincerity, leaving them that delight in
darkness still, for then the Lord permits his word to be preached to the
unthankful and ungodly receivers unto their judgment or condemnation. For so
verelie does the Evangelical and Apostolic doctrine teach us to think. This
says the Lord is condemnation, or, this is judgment, that the son of God,
the very true light came into the world, and the world loved darkness more
then light. And Paul said, If yet the Gospel be hid, it is hid in them that
perish in whom the God of this world has blinded the senses of their
understanding, etc. Pullinger in his Decades. fol. 492.

The meaning of this place following.
Except thou take away the blind and the lame, 2. Re. 5. 6.
thou shall not come in hither. The Iebusites spoke this in derision, being
persuaded that the^ strong hold was of such force y^ David could not overcome
it, although it were defended only by lame and blind men. Some write that
they spoke this of a confidence they had in their Idols, which the children of
God, esteemed as blind and lame. The Bible note.

The Children of God called Idols, blind and lame guides. Therefore the
Iebusites meant, that they should prove y^ their Gods were neither blind nor
lame. Geneua.

BLOOD.
What is meant by blood.
And blood went out of the wine fat unto the Horse bridles. Apo. 14. 20
By the name of blood, the Scripture is wont to betoken vengeance and
reuengement: and so meant John to describe the greatness of Gods wrath in this
place. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 218.

By this similitude he declares the horrible confusion of the Tyraunts and
Infidells, which delight in nothing but wars, slaughters, persecutions and
effusion of blood. Geneua.

How our cleansing is by Christ's blood.
And made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Apoc. 7. 14
That is to say, in faith and in following the sufferings of Christ. But how
can blood make them white will some man say? I answer after the same manner
that the Author of the Epistle to the Romans says: If the blood of Bulls and
Goats, and the ashes of a Bullock besprinkling them that are defiled, do
hallowe them as touching the cleansing of the flesh: how much more shall the
blood of Christ (who by the everlasting spirit has offered himself unspotted
unto GOD) cleanse your consciences from dead works, Heb. 9. 13.
to serve the living GOD. The Saints therefore and the faithful being cleansed
by the blood of the Lamb, both from original sin, and also from actual
sin committed, through human ignorance and weakness, and being preserved
that they should not give their assent to pestilent errors against y^ faith,
are said to have clear, (yea and also comely) garments. Marl. upon the Apoc.
fol. 111.

There is no purity nor cleanness, but by the blood of Christ only, which
purges our sins, and so makes them white. Geneua.

And sprinckling of the blood of Jesus Christ. 1. Pet. 1. 2.
Here S. Peter seems to have had respect unto the old Ceremony of blood
sprinckling: Blood sprinkling
for even as it was not enough then, that the Sacrifice should be offered and
the blood thereof shed, unless the people had been sprinkeled with the same,
so now at this present it shall profit us nothing, that Christ's blood is shed,
unless our conscience be cleansed and purified therewith, which thing is done
by the ministering of the holy Ghost, which does sprinkle our consciences with
Christ's blood to wash them withal. Sir. I. Cheek.

How the very flesh and blood of Christ is not in the Sacrament.
It was not lawful by Moses law, Deu. 12. 23
to eat nor drink the blood, Blood forbidden.
neither of man nor of beast. And the Apostles themselves, somewhat favoring
the infirmity of the Jews, did institute that men should abstain from blood.
Now if the Apostles had taught that in the sacrament the very flesh and blood
of Christ is eaten and dronken with the teeth and mouth, it had been a great
occasion to have excluded al y^ Jews at once from Christ: again the Apostles
would have been too scrupulous (if they had so grossly understood it) to have
dronken the very blood, seeing it was so plain against Moses Law. Read the
10. of the Acts, where as Peter had the cloth sent down. I. Frith.

Blood is the soul Deu. 12. 23
S. Augustine upon these words says thus: So is the Blood the Soul, even as
the Rock was Christ. And in the same Chapter, he ioineth these three sentences
together. The Blood Blood.
is the Soul, Soul.
the Rock was Christ, and This is my Body, as being all both of like meaning,
and also of like manner of vtteraunce.

Saint Ambrose expounding the same words says thus: When Moses in that place
called the Blood the Soul: doubtless he meant thereby, that the Blood is one
things and the Soul another.

For this is my blood in the new Testament. The wine signifies, that our
souls are refreshed and satisfied with the blood of Christ spirituallie
received, so that without him we have no nourishment. Geneua.

How the blood of Martirs is the seed of the Church.
And there fell a great fear upon those that saw them. Apo. 11. 11


That is to say, when the enemies of the truth saw they auailed nothing by
putting the Preachers of the word to death, they were sore afraid, like as at
this day many of the persecuters of the Gospel are constrained to say, that
they loose their labor utterly in persecuting those that be against the
Popish doctrine. For the more of them that be burned and put to death, the mo do
come away from ye untoward doctrine, to the doctrine of the Gospel, for the
blood of Martirs Blood of Martirs.
is the seed of the church^ Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 159.

BODY.
What a natural body is.
A Natural body is he that is led by his affections, 1. Cor. 2. 14
not understanding the things of the spirit of God. Tindale.

What a spiritual body is.
A spiritual body is he, Romans 8. 14
that is led by the spirit of God.

How the body of Christ is in one place.
Dardamus did write unto Saint Austen for the exposition of these words, Augu.
ad Dardamus
that Christ spoke unto the Thief saying: This day shall thou be with me in
Paradise: and wist not how to understand it, whether Christ meant, that the
Thief should be in Paradise with Christ's soul, or with his body, or with his
Godhead. Thereupon Saint Austen writes, that as touching Christ's body that
day it was in the Sepulcher, and says it was not in Paradise, although it was
in a garden that he was buried, for Christ (he says) meant of a place of joy,
and that was not (says S. Augustine) in his Sepulcher. And as for Christ's
soul it was that day in hell, and no man will say that Paradise is there,
wherefore (says S. Austen) the text must needs be understood that Christ
spoke it of his Godhead. Here S. Austen says plainly, that Christ's body as
touching his manhood was in the grave: and as touching his Soul it was in
Hell: so that while his body was in the grave, it was not in Paradise. For if
he had thought that Christ's body or soul might have been in diverse places at
once, he would not have said that the text must needs be understood of his
Divinity.

Again. As touching his Manhood he was in Earth, and not in Heaven (where he
now is) when he said, No man ascends into Heaven, but he that descended from
Heaven, the Son of man which is in Heaven.

Doubt not (says Austen again) but that Christ our Lord, the only begotten
son of God, equal with the Father and the same being the son of man,
wherein the Father is greater, is whole present in all places as touching his
Godhead, and dwells in the same Temple of God as God, and in some place of
heaven, for the cordicion of his very body. Here S. Austen says as touching
his Manhood, he is only in one certain place in heaven, and not in many
places at once.

The same one man is local (that is to say contained in one place) as
touching his manhood, Fulgen. ad Transmun. reg. li. 2.
which is also God unmeasurable from the father. The same one man as touching
the substance of his manhood, was absent from heaven when he was in earth, and
so forsaking the earth, when he ascended into Heaven: but as touching his
Godhead and unmeasurable substance, he neither forsook heaven, when he
descended from heaven, nor forsook the earth, when he ascended into heaven,
which may be known by the most sure word of the Lord, which to show his
humanity to be local (that is to say contained in one place only) did say
unto his Disciples: I ascend unto my father and your father, my God, and your
God. Of Lazarus also when he said: I am glad for your sakes (that you may
believe) for that I was not there. And again, showing the unmeasurableness of
his Godhead, and said unto his Disciples: I am with you unto the worlds end.
How did he ascend into heaven but because he is local and a very man, or how
is he present unto his faithful, but because he is unmeasurable and very God.

Now may Christ be called a stranger, Origin in Ma. ho. 33
is he departed into a strange country, seeing he is with us unto the worlds
end, and is among them, that be gathered in his name? Answer. Christ is both
God and man, having in him two natures. And as man he is not with us unto the
worlds end, nor is present with his faithful gathered together in his name.
But his divine power and spirit is ever with us. Paul (says he) was absent
from the Corinthiaris in body, but he was present with them in spirit. So is
Christ gone hence (says he) and absent in his humanity, which in his divine
nature is every where: and in these saiengs we reserve to both his natures
their properties.

A body must needs be in some place, Augu. ad Dardamus
if it be not within the compass of a place, it is no where, if it be no
where, it is not.

Doubt not but Jesus Christ as concerning the nature of his manhood is now
there, Aug. ad Da Ep^st. 17.
from whence he shall come. And we may not think that his man's nature is
every where, for we must beware, that we do not so stablish his divinity, to
take away the virtue of his body.

Christian people must believe that although Christ be absent from us
concerning his body, Ciril in John. l^. 6. ca. 4.
yet by his power he governs us and all things. For like as when he was
conversant here in earth as man, yet then he filled heaven. Even so being in
heaven with his flesh, yet fills the Earth, and is in them that love him.

S. Ambrose says: Ambr. in Luke. l^. 10. ca. 4.
We must not seek Christ upon earth, nor in earth, but in heaven where he
sits at the right hand of his Father.

To go to his father from us, Vige. cont. Eutichen. li. 1.
was to take from the world, the nature which he received of us. He is with us
and not with us. For touching the form of a servant (which he took away from
us into heaven) he is absent fro^m us, but by y^ form of God, he is present
with us. And nevertheless both present and absent, he is all one Christ.

If the word and flesh were both of one nature, seeing that the word is every
where, Vige. contr. Eutich. li. 4
why is not the flesh then every where. For when it was in Earth, then verelie
it was not in heaven. And when it is in heaven, it is not surely in earth. And
so sure that it is not in earth, that we look for him to come from heaven.

To be contained in a place, and to be every where, Vigelius.
be diverse and contrary, and one nature cannot receive in it self, two diverse
and contrary things.

He is created by nature of his flesh, Vigelius.
and not created by the nature of his Godhead. He is comprehended in a place by
the nature of his flesh, and not comprehended in a place by the nature of his
Godhead. Thus much (of this matter) gathered out of the works, of I. Frith.

BOOK.
What the book of life is.
ANd there was an other book opened, which is the Book of life. Apo. 20. 12
This is the book wherein the chosen are reported to be written before the
beginning of the world, by reason of the certainty of their Predestination,
whereof thou read thus: either forgive them this offense, or if thou will
not do it, wipe out of the book of life which thou have written. Exodus. 32.
32. Also be glad, for your names are written in heaven. Luke 10. 20 Also whose
name are in the book of life. Phil. 4. 3. Moreover it is a similitude borrowed
of the custom of men, who in taking musters are wont to write the choicer
sort, and to call them by name. So is God said to take view of his servant by
name, and to call them by name. Exo. 33. 12. and John. 10. 3. Mar. upon the
Apoc. fol. 281.

After this was an other book opened, of a far diverse nature from the other
books, for it was the sweet book of life, wherein were registered all that
were predestinate to be saved from the worlds beginning. And this book is, the
eternal predestination of God. Bale.

Who be written or wiped out of the book of life.
And I will not wipe him out of the book of life. Apoc. 3. 5.
To be wiped out of the book of life, is as much as not to be reckoned among
the living, blessed, and happy sort. For the book of life is nothing else, but
the register of the righteous which are fore ordained to life, according as
Moses says, Exo. 32. 32. And as it is written in Psalm. 69. 27. and in Dan. 12.
2. This regester, says ( Gasper Megander) does God reserve in his own
keeping: And therefore it is nothing else but his eternal dteermination fore
purposed in his breast. In like manner David says: let them be wiped out of ye
book of the living. Psalm. 69. 27. that is to say, let them not be reckoned
among Gods chosen, whom he allotteth to the possession of his church and
kingdom. In this book of life, that is to say, in this election or choice,
determination, purpose, knowledge or predestination of God, there is not
registered ante misbeleeuing Turk, any wicked Jew, any vn^epentant noughtie
pack, nor any stubborn hypocrite, unless they turn to the Lord, and
acknowledge Christ the only son of God. For none be written in it, but such
as believe aright in Christ. And that we may read this book, we need not to
climb up into heaven with the worldly wise men, to search out Gods secrets:
but must come to the plain Shepherd to the Dxe ^all where Christ lay. Luke.
2. 16. We must look upon Christ, who is become man, and was crucified and put
to death for us: and if we find our selves in Christ, then do we read our
name written in the book of life. For he that believes in the son of God,
has everlasting life. John. 3. 36. And he shall not come to damnation, but is
passed from death to life. John. 5. 24. And in this place Christ's meaning is,
that he which overcomes not, but like a weakling and coward shrinketh in this
encounter, by consenting to wicked error, shall be cast away with shame, and
have his name stricken out of the book of life. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 59.

And the Books were opened^ Apo. 20. 12
These books seem to be the consciences of all men be they good or bad, Book
of men's consciences.
which shall be then laid open, according as the Apostle witnesses. Romans 2.
15. 1. Cor. 4^5. by reason that Christ shall bring all the things to light
which were covered before. Other some take these books to be the old and new
Testaments, that forasmuch as there is showed in them, what God had commanded
it should appear also by them, what every man had done or not done. But the
first exposition is the truer. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 280.

Of what credit the books of Machabees be in the scripture.
Saint Austen received it for Canonical. But first of what sure credit did he
receive it? The Jews (says he) esteem not the writings of the Machabees, as
they do the Law, the Prophets and the Psalms, of which the Lord himself
has witnessed, as of his witnesses saying: It was necessary that all things
should be fulfilled that are written in the Law, Luke 24. 4^.
and the Psalms and Prophets concerning me. But it has been received of the
Church, not unprofitably, if it be sob^rlie read or heard. And Hierome
teaches without any doubting, that the Authority thereof is of no force to
the proving of Doctrines. And it evidently appears by that old book, Book
of Machabes
which is entitled under the name of Cipriane concerning the exposition of the
Creed, that it had no place at all in the old Church. But why do I here
strive without cause? as though the Author himself did not sufficiently
show, how much he is to be credited, when in the end he craves pardon, if he
have spoken any thing not well. Truly he that confesses his writing to
need pardon, says plainly that they are not the Oracles of the Holy Ghost.
Beside all that, the godliness of Judas is praised for none other cause, but
for that he had an assured hope of the last resurrection, when he sent an
offering for the dead to Jerusalem. Neither does the writer of that history
refer that which Judas did to be a price of redemption, but that they might
be partakers of the eternal life with the other faithful, that had died for
their Country and Religion. This doing was indeed not without superstition and
preposterous zeal, but they are more then fools, that draw a Sacrifice of
the Law so far as unto us: forasmuch as we know that things do cease by
the coming of Christ, that then were in use. Calvin in his institutions. 3.

BOSOM.
How it is diuer^lie taken.

Bosom after the manner of the Hebrews is taken for companieng with a woman.
And it is also taken for faith, as in Luke. 16. 23. of Lazarus. T. M.

In the Bosom of the father. John. 1. 1^.
This is a speech borrowed out of the custom of (...). For when we will
signify that we will commit our secret to any, we say we will admit him to
our Bosom. So the meaning is, that he (meaning Christ) is privy to all Gods
secrettes, and therefore can show us such heavenly mystery, as no man can
declare. And this exposition, Saint Austen follows. Cyrill thinks that in
the Bosom, is as much to say, as in the Father, and of the Father, and as you
using many words, in the inward part of the Father, for he is not a piece cut
off, and divided from the substance of the Father, as it fares in man's
begetting, but he so begotten, as he is still in the Father. Traheron^

BRAMBLE.

was Abimelech, who was a bastard, Iudic. 9. 15
and borne of an handmaide, so that he was not to be compared with his
brethren. And as he without any utility governed the Israelites, so is the
bramble wont to bring forth no fruit. The Bramble also pri^keth, even as
Abimelech very much huried the Israelites. Moreover some write, that the
boughs of Brambles are (...) (...) so vehemently shaken and moved with the
wind, that out of the^^ is fire kindeled, where with not only they
themselves brent, but the whole wood wherein they grow is burnt: which thing
Iothan now foretells to come to pass of Abimelech, wherefore the properties
do wonderfully well agree. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 160.

heart. Tind^le.

BRAVNCHES.
Who are the branches cut off.
Though some of the branches be broken of. (...). 1^. 17.
The branches that are broken off are the Jews, which are forsaken and cast
off. The wild Olive tree are the Gentiles. The right Olive tree is the
Covenant, or faith and vocation of ye Saint: The fatness thereof is the
grace of God and the glory of the elect. The Jews then being come of the
fathers, were as a man might say, naturally grafted in the covenant, but the
Heathen being come of Idolaters were as wild Olive trees grafted therein. Sir.
I. Cheek.

These broken branches were the unbelieving Jews, which for their unbelief
were cut off from the promise of God, in whose steed was the wild Olive, that
is, the Gentiles grafted through faith. The Bible note.

BREAD.
What Bread is in Scripture.
BRead in scripture, is taken for all that is necessary to this present life:
And I will fet a morsel of Bread to comfort your hearts withal: And as we
say in our Lords prayer, Give us this day our daily Bread. Tindale.

How Bread is called Christ's body.
Ireneus Irene^ co^t.
writing against the Valentinians Valen. li. 4 cap. 32. ca. 34. ca. 57.
in his fourth book, says that Christ confessed bread, which is a creature,
to be his body, and the Cup to be his blood: and in the same book he writes
thus also: The Bread wherein the thanks be given, is the body of the Lord.
And yet again in the same book he says, that Christ taking bread of the
same sort that our bread is off, confessed that it was his body: and that the
thing which was tempered in the Chalice was his blood. Lib. 5.
And in the fifth book he writes further, that of the Chalice^ (which is his
blood) a man is nourished, and does grow by the bread which is his body.
These words of Ireneus be most plain, that Christ taking very material bread,
a creature of God, and of such sort as other bread is, which we do use, called
that his body, when he said: This is my body, and the wine also which does
feed and nourish us, he calls his blood.

T^ertulian Tertu. aduers. Iudeos.
in his book written against the Jews, says, that Christ called bread his
body. And in his book against Marcion, he oftentimes repeateth the self same
words.

Saint Cipriane Cypriane ad Magn^ l^. 1. Epist, 6. lt. 2. Epist. 13.
in the first book of his Epistles says that Christ called such bread as is
made of many corns joined together, his body, and such wine he named his
blood, as is pressed out of many Grapes, and made into wine. And in his second
book he says these words: Water is not the blood of Christ, but wine. And
again in the same Epistle he says, that it was wine which Christ called his
blood, and that if wine be not in the Chalice, then we drink not of the fruit
of the Uine. And in the same Epistle he says, that meal alone or water alone,
is not the body of Christ, except they be both joined together, to make
thereof bread.

Epiphanius Epipha. in Ancorato
says that Christ speaking of a loaf which is round in fashion, and cannot
see nor feel, said of it, This is my body.

Saint Hierom writing ad Hedibiam, Hiero. ad Hedibiam
says these words: Let us mark, that the bread which the Lord brake and gave
to his Disciples, was the body of our Savior Christ, he said unto them, Take
and eat, this is my body.

Saint Augustine says, Augu. de tim. li. 3. ca. 4.
that although we may set forth Christ, by mouth, by writing, and by the
Sacrament of his body and blood, yet we call neither our tongue, nor words,
nor ink, letters nor paper, the body and blood of Christ, but that we call
the body and blood of Christ, which is taken of the fruit of the earth, and
consecrated by mystical prayer. Also he says: Dever.
Jesus called meat his body, and drink his blood.

Cyrill Cyril.
upon Saint John says, Apo. Se. 2.
that Christ gave to his disciples pieces of bread, saying, Take, eat, this is
my body. Cyrill in John, li. 4. ca. 14.

Theodoretus says, Theod. in Dialog. l.
When Christ gave the holy mysteries, he called bread his body, and the cup
mixed with wine and water, he called his blood.

By all these foresaid Authors, and places, with many more, it is plainly
proved, that when our Savior Christ gave bread unto his Disciples, saying:
Take and eat, this is my body, and likewise when he gave them the cup,
saying, Drink this among you, and drink you all of this, for this is my
blood, he called then the material bread his body, and the very wine his
blood. Thus much out of Cranmers book. fol. 118. 119.

How bread is a figure of Christ's body.
Christ himself (says Tertulian) Terrul. li. 1. cont.
did not reprove or discommend bread, which does represent his body. For the
understanding of this place, you must know that there was an Heretic called
Marcion, Martion.
which did reprove creatures, and said that all manner of creatures were
evil. This thing does Tertulian improve by the Sacrament and says: Christ
did not reprove or discommend bread, the which does represent his body. As
though he should say, If Christ had counted the bread evil, then would he
not have left it for a Sacrament, to represent his body, meaning that it is a
Sacrament, token, sign, and memorial of his body, and not the body it
self. And that this his meaning, does plainly appear in his sourth book as
follows.

Christ taking bread and distributing unto his Disciples, Tert. li. 4. co^t.
Mar.
made it his body, saying: This is my body. But this could not have been a
true figure of it, except Christ had had a true body: for a vain thing or
fantasy can take no figure.

For the understanding of this place, you must mark, that this Heretic
Marcion against whom this Author writes, did hold opinion, that Christ had
no natural body, but only a fantastical body, the which Tertulian
improueth by the Sacrament of the Altar, saying: The Sacrament is a figure of
his body, Ergo Christ had a true body, for a vain thing or fantasy can take
no figure.

After the mystical Easters Lamb fulfilled, Hierome sup. Mat.
and that Christ had eaten the Lambs flesh with the Apostles, he took bread
which comfort the heart man, and passes to the true Sacrament of the
Easters Lamb, that as Melchisedech brought forth Bread and Wine figuring him,
so might he likewise represent the truth of his body, etc.

Here does Saint Hierome speak after the manner of Tertulian before: That
Christ with his bread and wine did represent the truth of his body. For except
he had had a true body, he could not leave a figure of it, nor represent it
unto us: for a vain thing or fantasy can have no figure, nor cannot be
represented. As by example, how can a man make a figure of a Dream, Dream.
or represent it unto our memory. But CHRIST has left us a figure and
representation of his body in bread and wine. Therefore it follows that he
had a true body. This thing S. Bid does more copeouslie set forth, writing
upon S. Luke.

You shall not eat this body that you see, Augu. in perfa. psa. 98.
nor drink that blood which they that crucify me shall shed out. I have given
a certain Sacrament unto you, if it be spirituallie understood it quickens
you, but flesh profits nothing. This is plain enough spoken.

Thus much out of Frith. Look. Figure.

How bread remains after the consecration.
Theodoretus says, The mystical signs after the blessing (of the Priest)
depart not from their own nature. For they remain in their former substance,
figure, and form. Further he says, yet the same bread and wine remaining as
they were before, are understood and believed, and adored as y^ things that
they are believed.

The saying of Thomas Salisburiensis: Thomas Salisburi.
No man (says he) be he never so simple or never so wise, ought preciselie to
believe, that this is the body of our Lord, that ye Priest has consecrate,
but only under this condition, if all things concerning ye consecration be
done as apperteineth. For otherwise he shall avouch a creature to be the
creator, which were Idolatry.

Surely the Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ which we receive,
Gelasi in conci. To.
are a godly thing, and therefore through them are we made partakers of the
godly nature, and yet does it not cease to be the substance and nature of
bread and wine, but they continue in the properties of their own nature. And
surely the Image and similitude of the body and blood, are celebrated in the
act of the mysteries.

Look. Oil.

That which you see (says S. Austen) in the Altar is the bread and the cup,
Aug. in. sermon. ad infantes.
which also your eyes do show you, but faith shows further, that bread is
the body of Christ, and the cup his blood. Here he declares two things: That
in the Sacrament remains bread and wine which we may discern with our eyes,
and that the bread and wine be called the body and blood of Christ. Craumer.

He that called his natural body (says Theodoretus) Theod. in Dialog.
wheat and bread, and also called himself a Uine, the self same called bread
and wine his body and blood, and yet changed not their natures. And in his
second Dialogue he says more plainly. For (says he) as the bread and wine
after the consecration, loose not their proper nature, but kept their former
substance, form and figure, which they had before: even so the body of
Christ after his ascension, was changed into the godly substance.

Although ye make me to abide, Iudic. 13. 16.
yet I will not eat of your bread. This Hebrew word Lechem, signifies not
only bread, but sometime meat in universal, yea and sometime flesh also.
Hereof was invented the subtlety of the Papists: to whom when we say the
bread remains in the Eucharist, and prove it by that which Paul writes: The
bread which we break, is it not the communicating of the body of Christ: they
answer that the bread in that place may signify flesh, as it does
oftentimes in the holy Scriptures. But they ought to remember, that Paul
wrote these words in Greek, and not in Hebrew. But Arnos, that is bread in
Greek cannot signify as Lechem may in Hebrew. Farther in the holy Supper,
the flesh of Christ is not broken, but they are Symboles or Signs which are
broken. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 205.

How the sacramental bread ought not to be reserved.
Saint Cipriane Cipriane
says, this bread is received, and not shut up.

Clemens Clemens.
says: Let there be as many hoasts, or so much bread offered at the Altar, as
may be sufficient, for the people: if any thing remain, let it not be kept
until the morning.

Origin Origin.
or Cyrillus says: The bread that our Lord gave to his Disciples, he lengered
if not, nor bad it to be kept til the morning, whose reason is grounded upon
Christ's institution: for Christ said not take and keep, but take and eat.

Of the breaking of bread.
And brake bread in every house. This place ought not to be understood of the
Communion or Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, Act. 2. 46.
as the place before, but of the hospitality that was among them that
believed. Therefore they that by this place do take a boldness to use the
communion priuelie in their house, have no example at all of that thing in the
Scripture, and therefore they do naught, unless they be thereto driven by
sickness. Sir. ^^^eeke.

Being come togethor (...) to break bread. Act. 20. 7.
By this it is evident and plain, that in the administration of the
Sacraments, we are bound neither to time nor yet to place. For Paul did break
the bread, Augu ad. Iou. epi. 118
and did minister the Communion in the night time, and we do it in the day
time Again, he did both preach Christ, and minister the Lords supper in a
Parler, and these things are we not wont customablie to do in the Church.
Howbeit all things ought to be done in a due decent order. Sir. I. Cheek.

And when he had broken them. Ma. 14. 19
The breaking of bread was so common and usual with Christ, that by the same
he was known to his two Disciples, as they were going to Emaus. This manner
of broaking of bread was very fatherlike and commendable among the elders of
old time, as it is hitherto in many places, and after the same sort, best
beseeming and belonging unto Christ by whom we are all fed. Furthermore, this
breaking of bread has in it self a sign to divide, as appears by this
place of the Prophet: Break thy lofe to the hungry. For a lofe cannot refresh
many without it be broken and divided. And by this means it answers and is
agreeable to the mystery of the communicating the body of the Lord. The
Apostle saying: The bread which we break is it not the participation of the
body of the Lord? not that the body of Christ is therefore said to be broken,
because it has in it self some cut: but because it is made communicable, that
is, apt and meet to be participated and received of many. The Apostle Paul
says in an other place in the person of Christ. 1. Cor. 11.
This is my body which is broken for you, in steed of the which Saint Luke
has, Luke 22. 19
which is given for you, etc. Marlorate.

Of three kinds of Breads.
The Hebrews (as Lyra Lyra.
says) has three kinds of Breads, Panis propositionis sieve facierum, panis
oblationis, and panis laicos sieve co^munis. Holy show bread, set before the
face of the Lord upon the propiciatorie seat, Three Breads.
and this bread belonged only to Aaron and his sons, Hoc est soli
Sacerdotibus. The bread offered upon the oltar of Holocaust, and that was not
to be eaten but of the Leuits. And there was common bread, indifferent for
every man that list. Ric. Turnar.

BRETHREN OF CHRIST.
Who are called the bretheen of Christ.
THen came his mother and his brethren. Mar. 3. 31.
Here they are called Christ's brethren, which in deed were not his natural
brethren, but his cosins and kinsfolks, even as Lot is called Abraham's brother,
which was his brother. Arams son. Confer the sixth of Mark, and the. 13. of
Matthew with the 19. of John, and thou shall find the virgin Marie, had never
no more sons and daughters but Christ only. Sir I. Cheek.

Is not his Mother called Marie, Ma. 13. 55
and his brethren, James, and Ioses, and Simon, and Judas, etc. This place and
the first of the Acts, and Gal. the first, Helindius brings to prove that
Marie Christ's mother was no virgin.

Answer.
In the Scripture a man is said to be our brother, 4. manner of ways, that is
to say, by nature, by country, by kindred, and affection. By nature brethren
are, as Esau and Jacob, the twelve Patriarchs, Brethren 4. ways.
Andrew and Peter, James and John. By Country brethren are said to be, as the
Jews, which among themselves were called brethren, as in Deuteronomy. If thou buy thy
brother which is an Hebrew, he shall serve thee six years. And so S. Paul, I
have wished my self to be accursed from Christ for my brethren and kinsmen,
according to the flesh. By kindred they are said to be brethren which come of
one house, that is, when of one stock, a multitude do spring as in Genesis,
Abraham said to Lot. Let there be no contention between thee and me, and
between my Shepheardes and thy Shephearde because we are all brethren. And
again, Laban said to Jacob, because thou art my brother, thou shall not serve
me freely for nothing. Those that be brethren by affection are divided into
two sorts, into spiritual and common. They are spiritual brethren which are
Christians, as in the Psalm. 133.

Behold how joyful a thing it is, brethren to dwell together in unity.
Commonly we be called brethren, because we came all of one brother. By this
division it is, apparaunt that they were said to be the brethren of CHRIST, by
kindred not by nature, not by Countreie nor affection.

Therefore as Joseph was called the Father of Christ, even so were they said to
be his brethren, and that both in one respect. For Joseph was thought to be the
Father of Jesus, and so were James and Ioses and others, thought to be his
brethren. But none will contend about this, but such as be too curious. Mar.
fol. 20.

Look Christ.

BRIDE-GROME.
Who is the Bride-grome, and whereto the parable tends.
TO meet the Bride-grome. Mat. 25. 1.
It is very corruptly added of the old interpretour, in that he says, to
meet the Bridegroom and the Bride: seeing it is found in none of the Greek
books. And as for Chrisostom, Hilarious, and Theophilact, they make no mention
of the Bride. For Christ is ye Bridegroom: And the whole parable tends to
this end, that he coming we should go forth to meet him. No part of the
parable perteine to the Bride, naie, they which come to meet the Bridegroom in
good time, even they (I say) are the Bride. Saint Augustine expounding this
place (in a sermon which he made of the words of Christ, out of the 22. of
Matthew) neither reads nor makes any mention of this word Brid. Marl. fol.
592.

The pomp of Bridealls was wont for the most part, to be kept in the night
seasons, and that by Damsels. Bez^.

When the Bride-grome shall be taken from them. Mar. 2. 20
The Bride-grome is taken from us when evil affections, concupicense, and
lusts do drive Christ out of our hearts: Then ought we to use abstinence,
thereby to tame our wanton flesh, and to give our selves to earnest prayers,
that so the spirit of God may be renewed in us. Sir I. Cheek.

BROOK CEDRON.
Wherefore it was so called.
Over the Brook Cedron. Some think that this Brook was called the brook of
Ceders, because many Ceder trees grew about the same, but it is very like
notwithstanding that this name came up through error. For of the vallcie or
brook of Cedron, there is mention oftentimes made in the Scripture, where the
Hebrew word does not signify Ceder trees, but dimnesse or darkness.
Concerning the which brook, we read in the book of kings. This place was so
called because of the darkness, because it was a deep valle^e, and much
shadowed Marl. upon John. fol. 574.

Brook Cedron, was a deep valleie, through the which a stream ran after a
great rain. Geneua.

in as ample manner, as if our own person were present. Item we grant, that
if any being confessed die by the way, that he shall be free and discharged
from all their sins: And farthermore, we command the Angels of Paradise
(that his soul being fully delivered from Purgatory) they receive it into
Paradise. In an other Bull, he writes thus. We will not that any man be
formented in himself with the pain of hell: And also we grant to al those
that wear the cross, three or four souls at their pleasure, whom soever
they will, to deliver them out of Purgatory. Bale.

have labored now these three years with all, and yet notwithstanding for all
this your Bull, I cannot be restored to my right. The Pope hearing this,
commanded the poor Priest to be seourged, and after to be cast into prison,
what became of him afterward, the writer of the Story Henricus de Erphodia,
makes no mention. In the Book of Mar. fol. 487.

How Doctor Whittington was slain with a Bull.
There was a faithful woman that suffered martyrdom in a certain town
called Cheping Sadberie, in ye time of king Henry the seventh, condemned by
the Chauncelour called doctor Whittington. Whittington.
At whose death a great concourse of people there gathered together to behold
her end. Among the which the foresaid Chancellor was there present to see
execution done. The Sacrifice being ended, the people began to return
homeward, coming from the burning of this blessed martyr. It happened in the
mean time, that as the Catholic executioners were buisie in slaieng this
seely lamb at the town side, a certain Butcher in the town was as buisie
in slaieng of a Bull, which Bull he had fast bound in ropes, ready to knock
him on the head. But the Butcher (belike not so skillful in his art of killing
beasts, as the Papists be in murdering Christians) as he was lifting his Axe
to strike the Bull;, sailed in his stroke and smit a little too low, or else
how he smote I know not. This was certain that the Bull; although some what
grieved at the stroke, but yet not stricken down, put his strength to the
ropes, and brake loose from the Butcher into the street, the very same time
as the people were coming in great prease from the burning. Who seeing the
Bull coming toward them, and supposing him to be wild (as was no other like)
gave way for the beast, every man shifting for himself as well as he might.
Thus the people giving back, and making a lane for the Bull, he passed through
the throng of thein, touching neither man nor child, till he came where the
Chancellor was. Against whom the Bull, as pricked with a sodeine vehementie,
ran full but with his horns, and taking him upon the panch, gored him
through and through, and killed him immediately, carrieng his guts and
trailing them with his horns all the street over, to the great admiration and
wonder of all them that saw it. Book of Mar. fol. 919.

Whereunto the Bulls of Basan are compared.
The strong or fat Bulls of Basan, have compassed me in on every side.
Psalm. 2^. 12
A Bull is a beast, not only stout and strong, but also boisterous,
blockish, fierce and cruel: If his nimblenesse and quickness were to his
might, there were lightly no beast to be compared unto a Bull: Of these
natural properties, and specially of his hornewoode and mad fierceness,
when he is well baited and bitten with dogs, the cruel enemies and the
spiteful persecutours of our Savior Christ are very aptly and lively
called Tauri robusti. Boisterous Bulls, By Basan ye shall understand that it
was a plentiful land, full of woods and pastures, over the which, Og that great
fat hog was king. Which Og was a Gyaunt, whose bed was of iron, in length.
13. foot and a half, and in breadth 6. foot and an half. This country
Basan. ^. Pinguedo was a land of such fertiltie and plenty, that the Prophet
very aptly does translate and apply the same unto the persecutors of Christ,
which for their worldie wealth, their tyranny, and pride, are very properly
called fat Bulls of Basan. ^. men wallowing in wealth, in riches and plenty,
even as the Bulls of Basan do wallow in fat pastures. And if a man would now
narrowly draw and apply this place of the Prophet unto the manners of such
wicked men, which now a days do persecute Christ in his members, then by the
fat Bulls of Basan, ye may well and easily understand al such idle, rich, fat,
covetous worldly rich men, which in our time do so much gather togethers and
keep to them and to their hefres, that no poor man nor mean man, nor handie
crafts man, can have any competent living by the true labor of their hands.
Ric. Turnar.

He means (by the Bulls of Basan) that his enimie^ were so fat, proud, and
cruel, that they were rather beasts then men. Geneua.

BVRDEN.
What is meant by the word burden.
I will lay none other burden upon you. Apo^. 2. 24
Although there be some which in this place understand the word burden, to be
meant of the grief of mind and bitterness of heart, which the godly should
sustain, by reason of his error, which they should be feign to endure till
Christ come and deliver them by his visitation: yet is the place more rightly
understood of the burden of the law. For we know it was the property of
heretics and false Apostles to burden the Church with ceremonies, whereas
contrariwise Christ says, my yoke is sweet and my burden light. Mat. 11. 30.
etc.

Read, Act. 15. 10. Rom 8. 15. Gal. 5. 1. Marl. upon the Apocalips. fol: 53.

My mind is to yoke you with no other law, nor to burden you with any other
traditions then I have alredie given you, neither with ceremonies, rites, nor
ancient customs, in the observation of days, months, times, nor years, in
holy days, fastings, vigils, nor Sabotes, for they were but shadows of
things to come. Bale upon the Apoc. fol. 40.

The meaning of this place following.
What is the burden of the Lord. Iere. 23. 33
The Prophets called their threatenings, Gods burden, which the sinners were not
able to sustain: Therefore the wicked in deriding the word, would ask of the
Prophets, A Prophecy against false Prophets.
what was the burden, as though they would say, you seek nothing else but to
lay burdens upon our shoulders. And thus they rejected the word of God as a
burden. But because this word was brought to contempt and derision, he will
(says the Prophet) teach them another manner of speech, and will cause this
word burden to cease, and teach them to ask with reverence, what says the
Lord. For the thing that they mock and contemn, shall come upon them. Geneua.

The wicked men's hearts were so hardened against (...) truth, that they used
scornefullie to scosfe at Gods threatening prophestes in mocking, calling them
Gods fardle or burden. The Bible note.

Of the burden of Babel.
The burden of Babel which Esaie the son of Amos did see. Esaias. 13. 1
That is the great calamity which was prophesied to come on Babel as a most
grievous burden, which they were not able to bear. In these twelve Chapters
following, he speaks of the plague, wherewith God would smite those strange
nations (whom they knew) to declare that God chastened the Israelites as his
children, and these other as his enemies: And also that if God spared not these
that are ignorant, that they must not think strange if he punish them which
have knowledge of his law and keep it not. Geneua.

BVRIAL.
How Burial is a looking glass of resurrection.
Burial was brought in by God. It is no invention of man without good ground,
but it is Gods ordinance, to the end it should be a witness to us of the
resurrection and everlasting life. When men be buried, they are laid up in the
earth, as in a store house until they be raised up again at the last day,
and so our burial is unto us a loking glass of the resurrection. Calvin upon
Job. fol. 472.

The Pomp of burial forbidden.
But when thou do hear (says Chrysostom) that our Lord did rise again
naked, cease I pray thee from the mad expense of the burieng, what means
this superfluous and unprofitable expense, which unto them that make it
brings hurt, and no profit to the dead, but rather harm.

What the Greeks and Hebures do call their buring places.
The Greeks Greeks.
do call their burieng places, Cam^tereum, that is to say, a Dorter or
sleeping place, signifieng thereby that we ought to be as sure or rather more
sure, that they that be buried shall be raised again at the last day of the
general resurrection, then we are sure to rise again when we lay our selves
down to sleep, and that therefore we ought no more to (...), be w^ese, (...)
out friends, when we see any of them to be laid into the ground, then we
ought to be sori^ when we see them go to ^edde, and lay themselves down to
take their rest, being most assured by the undoubted and infallible word of
God, that we shall receive them again immortal and most gloriou^^: The
Hebrews Hebrews.

What (...) is to be buried with Christ.
(...) buried with Christ (...) Bap^^^e in to his death, Romans 6. 4.
that like as Christ was raised from the dead; by the glory of the Father, so
we also should walk in newness of life.

This partaking of death and life with Christ, is nothing else but the
mortifieng of our own flesh, the quickening of the spirit, in that the old
man is crucified, and we may walk in newness of life. Cal^ehill.

BVRNE.
What it is to Burn.
IT is is better to marry then to burn. 1. Cor. 7. 9.
To burn after Saint Ambrose: is when the will consents to the lust of the
flesh. Tindale.

Then to burn with the fire of concupisence, that is, when man's will so gives
place to the lust that tempts, that he cannot call upon God with a quiet
conscience. Geneua.

What these burning lights do signify.
And your lights burning. Luke 12. 35
These burning lights that Christ wills us to have in our hands, are a
lively faith, working through charity. The works of ye Christians ought to be
lively, fervent, and burning. Sir. I. Cheek.

Of burnt offerings, and peace offerings,
They offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Burnt offerings were they
which were all burnt: but of peace offerings, a certain part was offered, an
other part was given unto the Priest, an other part returned unto him which
offered it; to eat it with his friends in the sight of the Lord. Pet Mar. upon
Iudic. fol. 271.

Why it was called a whole burnt offering.
And offered a whole burnt offering^ It is called a whole burnt offering, Genesis
8. 20
because the whole sacrifice was consumed with fire, by the which is signified
that the person which did offer the same, should have his heart and mind
wholly upon God, as it is written: Love thy God, with all thy heart, and with
all thy soul, etc. The Bible note.

How the Christians do offer burnt (...).
Although that the burnt offering of (...), (...) Sheep, of Calves and Birds
(offered in the old law) be abolished by the glory of Christ, whose death
and passion they did ad^^brate, a^ S. Paul witnesses. Heb. 10. Shall we
think there^ fore that we now which be Christians, have not burnt (...)fice to
offer unto God, yes, m^ then they had. For so often as we do preach, or the
king or any other godly man, does cause or help Christ's Gospel to be
purelie and sincerely preached to the people, so often do we offer a burnt
sacrifice of sweet savor unto God, a sacrifice that pleases God, far above
the offering of a young fat calfe that has horns and houes^ This is that
sweet sacrifice whereof Malachie the Prophet does speak in the first Chapter,
saying: From the rising of the Sun, to the going down of the same, great is
my name among the Gentiles, and in every place shall sacrifice be made and
offering set up to my name. This sacrifice and burnt offering, is not the
sacrifice of ye wicked Mass, but it is ye sacrifice of the preaching of
Christ's death, and the meritas of hi^^sion^ We do also offer burnt sacrifices
unto the Lord, when we do offer our selves, our hearts our minds, and all
(...)dilie members to the true serving of God in perfect faith. Of the
spiritual sacrifice that the Christians do daily offer unto God. Look Romans
12. 1. Phi. 4. 18. 1. Pet. 2^5. Ric. Turnar.

CAINE.
How and by what means Caine was slain.
IN the beginning of the world, most people went naked, saving that they were
partly covered with skins of some beast, and at that time they had no
dwelling house to defend them, neither from the cold, neither yet from heat,
but after their own fantasies, they made with pretty boughs and twigs of
trees, such little pretty lodgings as we call Cabens or Boothes. And it so
chanced that Caine being very old and also weary, happened one day to
lay him down to rest in a bush that was enclosed with green boughs as
aforesaid. And Lamech one of y^ kindred of Caine in the fifth degree, who by
reason of his great age had lost his sight, and yet at a time was disposed to
go abroad to kill some wild beast. And taking his Bow and Arrows, he took
also a little boie to lead and direct him, where he might have a good shoot.
And when he drew somewhat near unto the bush where Caine lay, the little boie
espieng the bush to wagge, and seeing as it were a great thing in the midst
thereof, he imagined that there lay some wild beast, and the boy being
afraid thereof, gave knowledge to old Father Lamech, that in a bush standing
right before him, Genesis 4. 23.
and not far off, there lay a great and terrible beast. And Lamech upon the
report of the child, stretched out his arm, and drew a straight draught
toward the bush, where he slew his cousin Caine, that lay in the same after he
had lived. 730. years, as says Philo. Graftonan his Chro. fol. 7.

Lyra says, that when Lamech perceived he had slain Caine, (whom the Lord had
forbidden him in pain of great punishment) he fell upon his own servant, and
beat him so that he died.

Of a certain sect called Caini.
Caini were heretics Heretics
which honored Caine: and took him for their father. They highly esteemed of
Esau, Chore, Dathan, Abiram, with ye Sodomits. They called Judas ye traitor
their cousin, honoring him for betraieng of Christ, affirming y^ he foresawe
how great a benefit it would become unto ma^kinde. They read a certain
Gospel written as they say by Judas, they reviled the law and denied the
resurrection. Epiphani. haeres. 38. August de haeres.

CAIPHAS.
How he was the mouth of God, and the mouth of the devil all at one time.
HE was the mouth of God, Ioh. 11. 49.
in as much, as God made him to say, that his people could not be saved but
only by the death of his son Jesus Christ: but he was the mouth of the
devil according to his intent after the which he so spoke, for he did not
speak according to the meaning of the holy Ghost, but as a murderer, an
enemy of truth, pretending the death of Jesus Christ, because of the hatred
which he bare toward him.

God made him to speak, neither could his impiety let Gods purpose, who
caused this wicked man even as he did Balaam, to be an instrument of the holy
Ghost. Geneua.

The spirit of prophecy do many times speak by the mouth of an ungodly man,
for the ungodly are so excecated and blinded, that they do oftentimes speak
against theirown selves unwittingly, and that to their utter undoing and
destruction.^ Sir I. Cheek.

CALL.
What it is to call upon the name of the Lord.
IN that time began men to call upon the name of the Lord. Genesis 4. 26.
To call upon the name of the Lord, is to require all things of him and to
trust in him, giving him the honor and worship that belongs unto him, as in
Genesis 12. 8. T. M.

In these days God began to move the hearts of the godly to restore religion,
which a long time by the wicked had been suppressed. Geneua.

Of three mnner of callings.
Many are called, Ma. 22. 14
etc. Christ speaks of the external calling by the preaching of the Gospel,
of y^ which there are three degrees. All men are called, yea, even they which
hear not, these which are dumme and are deaf minded, are also called. The
second sort enter in, and promise that they will serve God, nevertheless their
consciences condemns them, because they have not the true root. As Simon
Magus, which did feign himself to believe of the faithful, being convicted in
his conscience by the truth of the Gospel professed the same, but he had no
root, as Peter casts him in the teeth. Such are they truly to whom the Lord
sends his holy spirit, and whom for a time he illuminateth, but at the
length by the just desert of their ingratitude he forsakes them, and strikes
them with great blindness. (...)
The third calling is special and of great efficacy, by the which God does
very much advance the elect and faithful only, when that by the inward
lightening of the spirit, he brings to pass, that the word preached abides
in their hearts. To these, testimony is given by the same spirit, that they
are the adopted sons of God. We cannot judge who are the elect and who are
the reprobate: for we ought to leave this judgment unto God. Notwithstanding
by signs there may be some conjecture had, but we must always beware of rash
judgment. Every man that is elected and chosen of God, is fully certified in
himself of his calling. The which thing we may daily behold. For many are
brought into the Church, which afterward fall away from the same, either
being terrified by persecution, or else being overcome with some other
temptation. Such truly are of ye number of them that are called, but are not
elected, for hereby our election is proved, if we persevere unto the last end.
Mar. fol. 51.

First, all men be generally called, even those that does not hear the word,
for unto them both heaven and earth, and and the creatures comprehended
therein, does not cease to preach the almighty power of God, and also his
goodness and mercy, so that all men (as the Apostle says) are inexcusable
before the majesty of God. And with them may be comprehended those that hear
the word, who (though they be called) be so deaf in their hearts and minds,
that they will neither give care nor heed to the calling. The second sort that
be called, do profess the Christian religion, and receive the word, but it
has no true root in them as Simon Magus being convinced in his heart, y^ the
gospel was true, did for a time profess, but because it had no root in him, he
did soon fall away from it. Such are them to whom y^ Lord does give his holy
spirit, illuminating the^ for a time, but after ward he does forsake them,
because of their ingratitude and unthankfulness, and does strike them with
great blindness. The third manner of calling is both particular and also most
effectual. For by it the Lord does only call his elect and chosen, and whom
he has ordained before unto life everlasting, working so in them by the inward
operation of his holy spirit, that the word preached to them does take root in
their hearts, and brings forth fruit unto life eternal. He does also by the
same spirit testify unto them, I mean unto their spirits, that they be the
children of God, and heirs of the kingdom of heaven. I. Veron.

Of two manner of callings.
There are two sorts of vocation, the one outward and the other inward. By the
outward vocation, I mean a common and general vocation, by the which God does
call by his outward preaching, all those to whom the Gospel is preached, be
they chosen or reprobates. And by the inward I understand, a vocation whereby
God does not only call men by the outward preaching of his word, but makes
them to feel the power and efficacy of the same by his holy spirit, in such
sort that they do not only hear it with their outward ears, but do also
receive it into their hearts by faith, whereby they are justified. Pet. Viret.

The calling of God, is of two sorts: the one is common, whereby men in deed
are after a sort stirred up, but they ^^^not bowed, for that those things which
are offered please them not: but the other is a convenient, apt, and mighty
calling, whereby the minds are touched, and truly changed. After this manner
was Jacob called, and not Esau. Therefore the one was beloved, and the other
hated, the one drawn, and the other forsaken. Calvin in his insti. fol. 257.

God does call men two ways, the one is a general calling, by the which God
with the outward preaching of (...) word does inuit al me^ unto him, yea,
those to whom his word is propounded for their dampnation. The other is a
special ^^ling, that is, a calling according to Gods purpose, by the wh^^^ he
works so through the inward lightening of the spirit (...) the word preached
is also grounded in our hearts, tru^ (...) stood and faithfully believed, Even
as we see y^ will of God (...) two sorts, the one preached and revealed in his
holy Scripture, whereby he wills that all men should be saved, albeit for
their iniquities few be saved: The other unsearchable and also unknown to us,
whereby he works his will, both in heaven and in earth. F. N. B. the Italian.

See more in these words. Election.

Predestination. Chosen.
Many are called and few be chosen. Ma. 20. 16
All nations and people, are by the outward preaching of the Gospel, called:
but only they that are ordained and chosen to life everlasting do believe
and give credit to the word. Sir. I. Cheek.

CALFE.
Of the Calfe that Aaron made.
ANd made of it a molten Calfe. Exe. 32. 4.
They smelled of their leven of Egypt, where they saw calves, oxen, and
serpents worshipped. Geneua.

The Hebrews when they compelled Aaron to make them a Calfe to worship, had not
that mind to fall from the true God, when they confessed that he brought them
out of Aegipt. This was only their intent, to worship him under some sign
or visible form, and they chose that form, whereby they had seen the
Aegiptians express their God by. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic.

CAMEL.
How the Latin word Camelum is taken two ways.
IT is easier for a Camel, Ma. 19. 24
etc. The latin text is: Facilius est Camelum acus transire. This word Camelum
a Camel, in y^ English translation, is expounded of some to signify in this
place the Cabell of a Ship: and truly that does better agree to the eye of a
nedle. And yet Pollux writing of y^ instruments perteining to a ship, makes
mention of this word Camelus, and Suidas only is found to understand this
word in that signification: yet understanding it so, as it is written with ( i)
and not with ( e) as Camilos, and not Camelos.

For though there be a little difference in the words, yet notwithstanding in
sense there is great contrariety, for the first signifies a beast called a
Camel, and the other signifies a Rope or Cable of a Ship. Other some do
rather agree to Hierom which follows Origin, which takes this word Camelum
being a Greek word (as we showed before) for the beast called a Camel. For
Christ would have it seem altogether as impossible for a rich man trusting in
his riches to enter into the kingdom of heaven, as for a Camel being a
monstrous beast to go through the eye of a needle. But and if this saying
seem to any man obscure, let them remember the man reprehended of the Lord,
which went to pluck y^ mote out of his brothers eye, and could not see the
beam in his own eye. What can be more absurd, then to say that a man carries
a beam in his eye? But this absurdity of his words, has a great Emphasis and
force. Marl. fol. 434.

CANDELS OR TAPERS.
Against the superstitions of Candels and Tapers in the Church.
ANd whereas they bring thither burning Candels, Hier. co^t. Vigilan.
and that at noone days, it must needs come from the superstition of the
Ethnikes. The old christian men used burning candels, but it was in the night
time, because they durst not assemble together in the day season, and it was
not very hansome to sit in the dark. Whereupon Hierom also says: We do not
light candels at broad day, as you do slander us without cause, but by this
comfort we do delaie the darkness of the night, and do watch by light, least
like blind folk, we should sleep in darkness, like as thou do. Musculus
fol. 291.

Lactantius inueighing the Heathenish or Popish superstition of Candels that
has been used, says: Accendimus lumina velut in tenebris, etc. They light
candels unto God, as it were in the dark. But if they will behold heavenly
light (they we call the sun) they may understand that their God lacks no
lights, that for the use of man, has given so clear a light. And yet, whereas
in so small a circle, which by reason of the distaunce, seems no bigger then
a man's head, there is so great a oli^^ering, that the engine of man's eye, is not
able to look directly upon it. And if for a while you fix your sight thereon,
di^^esse and darkness do follow your dazed eyes. What light, what clearenes,
may we think to be with God, with whom there is no night at all? Who has so
ordered this light of his, that neither by too much shining beams, nor over
parching heat, he should hurt^ the Cattle. And yet of both has departed so
much, as either the bodies of men may bear, or riping of the fruit require,
wherefore he concludes with these words saying: Is he to be thought to be in
his right wits, that to the Author and giver of light, offer up the light of
Candels and Tapers for a gift.

CANDELSTICKE.
Why the Church is likened to a candelsticke.
ANd the 7. Apo. 1. 20.
Candlestickes which thou saw, are the 7. churches. The Church is likened to
a Candelsticke, because the true light shines in it, whereof all the godly are
pertakers. And therefore Paul calls the Church, the pillar and groundworke
of truth. 1. Tim. 3. 15. Or else Christ's Church is called a candelstick, because
there are in it, Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers ( Ephesians.
4. 11.) to give light unto others, by the most wholesome doctrine of Christ
together with the holiness of their own life, thereby to guide them in their
travailing through the darkness of this life, unto the heavenly heritage, as
it is said. 2. Pet. 1. 19. The Church then is as a cresset, set up in an haven,
to show the haven a far off, to such as wander upon the deep sea in the
night season. Even so does our Savior say of John Baptist, that he was a
burning and blasing cresset. John. 5. 35. And unto his disciples, You are the
light of the world. Mat. 5. 14. Marl. upon the Apo. fo. 28.

Consider also the 7. golden candelstickes which thou saw about me, to be
the said 7. Congregations, upon whom I ought to shine, which am the light of
the world, in whose works I ought to appear, which am the cleerenesse of the
Gentiles. They are called here 7. golden Candelsticks, as most precious in
value, for so much as they are precious in the sight of God, and were also
redeemed and bought with a great price, even with the precious blood of the
undefiled Lamb Jesus Christ. Bale.

CAPTIVITY.
The meaning of this place following.
HE that leads into Captivity, Apo. 13. 10
goes into Captivity. This is said for the comfort of the godly, to the end,
they may know, that they shall be delivered from captivity: and
con^rariwise, that such as hold them captine shall be carried into captivity:
according to this text: He lead Captivity captive, Psa. 68. 18. Ephesians. 4. 8.
Wherwithall agrees this saying of y^ Prophet: Woe unto thee that spoilest, and
have not been spoiled, which do wrong and have had no wrong done unto thee.
For when thou have done spoiling, thou shall be spoiled thy self, and when
thou have made an end of doing wrong, thou shall have wrong done unto thee.
Esaias. 33. 1. Also, Behold the Lord comes with his thousand of Saints to do
judgment upon all men, and to reprove all such as are wicked, of all the deeds
which they have wrought wickedlie, and of all the hard things that the wicked
sinners have spoken against thee. Jude. verse. 14. 15. Also, It belongs to
Gods righteousness, to render affliction unto such as afflict you, and unto you
that are afflicted relief, etc. 2. The. 1. 6. Most foolish then are they, and
far from understanding the mind of the Holy Ghost, which impute the Turks
suceesse and victories to his religion and just dealing, and not rather to
their own sins. For they are like those, that fathered all the prosperity
of the Heathen, upon the serving of their Idols, and con^rariwise their own
misery, upon the neglecting of their Idol service, as it is written in Iere.
44. 18. Therefore such as lead men captine, from the faith and doctrine of the
Gospel (as Antichrist now does) shall be lead into captivity of endless
damnation except they repent. Marl. upon the Apo. fol. 194.

As God overcame the enemies of his Church, Psa. 68. 18
took them prisoners and made them tributaries: so Christ which is God
manifested in flesh, subdued Satan and sin under us, and gave unto his
Church, most liberal gifts of his spirit. Geneua.

The Messiah came down from heaven into the earth, Ephesians. 4. 8.
to triumph over Satan, Death and Sin, and lead them as prisoners and slaves,
which before were Conquerours and kept all in subjection: which victory he
gate, and also gave it, as a most precious gift to his Church. Geneua.

CARE.
What Care is forbidden.
BE not careful before hand, etc. Ma. 13. 11
We are not forbidden to think before hand: but pensive carfulness, whereby
men discourage themselves, which proceeds from distrust and want of
confidence and sure hope of Gods assistaunce: that carfulness we are
forbidden to beware of Mat. 6. 27. Beza.

All manner of Care is not forbidden, but that worldly and devilish care y^
springs of an inordinate love to worldly things and of mistrust in God. As
for an example: I covet inordinate more then sufficient, or but even that I
have need of. And it (because I mistrust God, and have no hope in him, and
therefore pray not to him) comes not, then I mourn, forrowe, and pine away,
and am whole unquiet in my heart. Or whether I have too much, or but
sufficient, and love it inordinatelie: then I care for the keeping. And because
I mistrust God, and not hope in him that he will help me, therefore, when I
have locked doors, chambers and cofers, I am never the nearer at rest, but care
still, and cast a thousand ways and perils, of which y^ most part were not in
my might to avoid, if I never slept, and where this care is, there can the
word of God have no resting place, but is choked up, as soon as it is sown.
Tindale. fol. 236.

Care not then for to morrow, etc. It is commanded us, in the sweat of our
faces to win our bread: but not to be careful what profit should come unto
us thereof, for that were to care for to morrow: we must commit that to God,
which to prosper our labors with his blessing, and that abundantly, so that
most shall we profit, when we are least careful. Tind.

God will provide for every day, that that shall be necessary, though we do
not increase the present grief, by the carfulness how to live in time to
come. Geneua.

What care we ought chiefly to care for.
Care day by day, and hour by hour, earnestly to keep the covenant of the
Lord thy God, and to record therein day and night, and to do thy part unto the
uttermost of thy power. And as for Gods part, let him care for it himself, and
believe thou his word steadfastly, and be sure that heaven and earth shall
sooner perish, then one jot bide behind of that he has promised,etc. Tindale.

CARPOCRATES.
Of his wicked opinions, and devilish illusions.
CArpocrates, Heretic.
as Ireneus. li. I. ca. 24. writes, lived in the time of Saturnius and
Basilides. He gloried of charmed love drinks, of devilish dreams, of associate
spirits. Euse. li. 4. cap. 7. Carpocrates patched his opinions out of Simon,
Menander, Nicholas, Saturnius, Basilides. Besides the wicked doctrine of these
Heretics which he maintained, he worshipped as Epiphanius says, the Images of
Jesus, of Paul, Pythagoras Plato, Aristotle, etc. He denied that the body
should be saved. Epipha. haeres. 27. Augu. li. de haeres.

Eliote, rehearses his opinions on this wise. He denied (says he) Christ to
be God, affirming that he was pure man. Affirmed also the world to be made by
Angels. He rejected the old Law, and denied the general resurrection. He
denied that Christ was borne of the virgin Mary, saying he was gotten of the
seed of Joseph. Also that his body suffered, and that his soul only was
received into heaven. He lived about the year of our Lord. 142.

CASTOR AND POLLVX.
What these two were, and how they were worshipped.
Whose badge was Castor and Pollux. These in old time were esteemed as Gods,
which if they appeared both together were counted favorable and luckie to
mariners and such as travailed the Seas. If one after another or but one alone,
unfortunate and cruel. The owner of the ship carried the badge of them, not
without great confidence therein, that these two Gods would prosper his voyage,
because he honored them with the carieng thereof. Tindale.

Those the Panims fained to be Jupiters children and Gods of the Sea. Geneua.

So they used to deck the forepart of their ships whereupon the ships were
called by such names. Beza.

CAVE OR DEN.
What difference is between a cave and a den.
MAde them dens in the mountains and caves. Iudic. 6. 2.
raelits to avoid the miseries made them caves. For so does this Hebrew word
Manaharoth signify and denies. It is in Hebrew writeten Mearoth. But what
difference there is between. these two words, as much as I can gather by the
Hebr^es. I will declare. Those first places were in banks of hills, and were
so called, because from the upper parts they had certain chinkes and holes,
which were like windows, so that through them, they had light sufficient
within. And y^ same places were very hansome for men to dwell in the^ R. Leui.
says, y^ through those holes and cliftes, which were like windows, spies,
when they saw the Madianites coming, did use either by kindeling of fires or
by some other token to give knowledge unto the Hebrews, whereby they might
gather their stuff, fruits and cattels into the dens, and lead them away
from the enemies which were coming by. For dens were not in mountains, but
places under the earth in the fields being dark and without light, wherein men
did not dwell, but they might after a sort, hide their things and goods. But
Caves in Latin are called Specus, a speciendo, which is to behold and look
upon, because out of them as out of high places, they which were there, used to
look through, etc. Pet. Mar. upon. Iudic. fol. 112.

CAUSE.
What the cause of unbelief is, and also of faith. Objection.
What is the cause that the one sort through unbelief do reject the Gospel
when it is offered them, and that the other receive it by faith.

Answer.
It is not to be meruailed at, when men by their unbelief and unkindness
reject the Gospel: but it is marvel that some are found that do receive it
by faith. For that all men being corrupted with sin, is of such perverse nature
and wickedness, that they cannot nor will not believe in God, nor follow his
word. And though that many of contrary nature be found, which not only
receive by faith the word of God and Jesus Christ our Lord, but are also ready
to lay down their life and to adandon the same for the confession of their
faith, understand they are not such of nature, but by the grace of God, by ye
which they are renewed and transformed into a new nature, and are new creatures.
For it is not flesh and blood that has revealed it to them, Ma. 16. 17
but the heavenly father. Pet. Viret.

How the cause of sin, is not to be laid unto God.
God compels no man to sin, but every man willingly sins, wherefore
the cause of sin, is not to be laid in him. Pet. Mar. upon ludic. fol. 163.

How the success makes not the cause either good or bad.
If the success be evil, the cause is not therefore straight way evil.
Neither if the success be good, is y^ cause therefore straight way good.
Nabuchodonozer destroyed Iewrie, and led away the Nations that were adioining,
captives into Babylon, and yet was not his cause therefore good: Gods cause
indeed was just, for he would by that means take vengeance of a rebellious
people. But Nabuchodonozer thought nothing else but to exercise his tyranny.
Joseph because he would avoid adultery, was cast into prison, and yet was not
his cause therefore ever a whit the worse. David was rejected of Absalom, and
yet was not Absaloms cause therefore any whit the better. In our time Princes
that are Protestants, have had evil success in war, and yet is therefore
not y^ cause of the Gospel to be thought y^ worse. The Beniamites now got the
victory more then once or twice, in a cause most wicked. The holy Martyrs in
our time are most miserarablie slain of Tyrants, and that with most cruel
kind of torments, and yet we nothing doubt, but their cause is most excellent.
England had of late, as touching the word of God and truth, a Church most
rightly instituted, which was afterward miseblie disiected and separated:
neither followed it thereby that the cause of Religion was evil. But now
thanks be given unto God that has restored it. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 271.

CENCHREA.
How Paul vesd himself at Cenchrea, and what Cenchrea as.
ANd he shore his head in Cenchrea, Act. 18. 18.
Cenchrea is an haven at Cormth, where Paul taking ship did sheare his head,
according to his vow. For according to the Law of Moses, they that vowed
themselves to God, were commanded to suffer their hair to grow, as long as
they would continue Nazarites, and afterward to sheare it, and to burn it.
This did Paul not forgetting what he had before decreed with y^ Apostles
touching the abolishing of y^ law. But lest the Jews which believed, should be
offended, he fained himself a Jew, to win y^ Jews. Tindale.

CERDON.
Of the wicked opinions of this man.
HE taught that Christ was never borne of a woman, Heretic.
and that he had no flesh, nor suffered any passion, but seemed only to
suffer. He affirmed that God which is declared in the Laws and Prophets to be
God, was not the father of our Savior Christ, for so much as he was known, the
other unknown. The one was just, the other was good. It was his doctrine also,
that some creatures of themselves were evil, and that they were not made of
the God that was the chief goodness, but of another God of all naughtiness,
whom he called the chief or principal mischief. He was about the year of
our Lord. 144. Eliot^. Eusebius. li. 4. cap. 10 11.

CEREMONIES.
What Paul means by Ceremonies,
Look. Rudiments.

When Ceremonies may be retained, when not.
SO long as it may be understood of all people what is meant by them, and so
long as they serve the people and preach one thing or other, they hurt not
greatly. Although the free servant of Christ ought not to be brought
violently into subjection under bondage of men's traditions. As S. Augustine
complains in his days, Aug. Epl. ^ 19.
how that the condition and state of the Jews was more easy then the
Christians under traditions, so sore had the tyranny of the Shepherds invaded
the flock alredie in those days, almost twelve hundred years passed.

How out of ceremonies, sprang the ignorance of the Scriptures.
Our grievous fall and horrible blindness wherein we were so deep and so
deadly brought a sleep, is to be imputed unto nothing else then to the
multitude of Ceremonies. For as soon as the ^ Prelates had set up a rabble of
ceremonier, they thought it superfluous to preach the plain text any longer,
and the Law of God, the faith of Christ, the love toward our neighbor, and
the order of our justifying and salvation, forasmuch as all such things were
played before the peoples faces daily in the Ceremonies: but got them to
Allegories, faining them every man after his own brain, without rule almost
on every ^illable, and from thence unto disputing and wasting their brains,
about words, not attending the significations, until at the last, the lay
people had lost the meaning of the Ceremonies, and looking on the holiness of
the deeds, to be justified by doing of them, they made them Image-seruice,
hateful to God, and rebuked of the Prophets, etc.

What Ceremonies or Traditions are to be refused.
I think all Ceremonies (or Traditions) are to be refused, which are against
the word of God, which are idle, vain and unprofitable, which are dishonest and
uncomely, which have but a show of superstition, which are grievous and
burdenous. Musculus.

Look. Traditions.

CESARE A PHILIPPI.
Of two cities, called Cesarea.
INto the parts of Cesarea Philippi. This Cesarea is at the river of Jordan,
and was called at the first, Panneas, but afterward it was called, Cesarea
Philppi, by Philip the son of Herod the great, and the brother of the
Tetrarch which beheaded John. The which Cesarea also after that for the honor
of Nero, Ma. 16. 13
was called by Agrippa, Neronia, as appears by Josephus, in his. 18. book of
the Antiquities of the Jews, and the 3. chapter. But the bound or borders of
this Cesarea Philippi, was the Region of the Jews, whereupon it was inhabited
both by the Syrians and Jews together. Of this city there is often mention
made in Luke in the Acts of the Apostles. There is also another Cesarea,
namely that ancient and noble Cesarea, which at the first was called the
Tower of Strato.

This City Herod the great builded between Dora and Ioppa, and for the love
of Augustus Caesar, he called it Cesarea. Of this first Cesarea our Evangelist
makes mention, and because he would make a difference, he called it Cesarea
Philippi. Marl. fol. 355.

There were two Cesareas, the one called Stratonis, upon the Sea Mediterranie,
which Herod built sumptuously in the honor of Octauius, Iosep. book. 15.
The other was Cesarea Philippi, which Herod the great Tetrarchs son by
Cleopatra, built in the honor of Tiberius, at the foot of Libanon. Joseph,
book. 15. Beza.

CHALCEDON.
Of the nature of this stone, and what is meant by it.
THe third a Chalcedon. Apo. 21. 19
This stone has the color of a dim candle. It shines abroad, and is dark
within doors. It will not be cut by any engrauing. It casts ^orth beams of
a finger long, and draws Chafe unto it. It be^^okeneth the flame of the
inward charity of the Saints, who shine but dim abroad, and yet they resist
all privy underminings. For in the troubles of this world, their Charity is
strong, and unable to be appaired: but when it is willed to prefer other
folks, then it appears what brightness it has within. Marl. upon the Apoc.
fol, 299.

The third a Chalredon, which is yet more course to look upon then the
Sapphire, but in nature, precious, mighty and strong. Of this nature were
Helias and John. Baptist, whose conversation was in the wilderness rough, hard
and unpleasant. Yet appeared they precious at the times appointed, mighteli^
rebuking sin, drawing unto them the chafe, as the propertis is of the
Chalcedon (which are the common people) but vtterlis throwing forth again,
the Idolatrous and Hypocrites The word of Helias brent like a cresset, and John
was a shining lantern before the world. Bale.

CHAMBER.
What this word Chamber signifies.
BUt when thou praiest, Mat. 6. 6.
enter into thy chamber. Chamber here signifies a secret place, separated
from all worldly noise, when we go about such things, as we would no man
should know of. As it is said. Esaias. 26. 20. Such a chamber must thou make of
thine own heart, and there pray. Tindale.

Of entering into the chamber and shutting the door too, I say as above of that
the left hand should not know what the right hand does: that the meaning is,
that we should avoid, all worldly praise and profit and pray with a single
eye and true intent according to Gods word: and is not forbidden thereby, to
pray openly, etc. Tindale.

Enter thou into thy chamber, Esa. 26. 20
and (...) dor after thee. He exhorts the faithful to be patient in their
affi^^ions and to wait upon Gods work. Geneua.

CHARIBDIS AND SCILLA.
What these two of the Poets are fained to be.
THese two are fained of the Poets to be 2. great Monsters of the Sea in the
way between Calabria and Cicilia, standing the one directly against the
other, and the same so dangerously that they destroy all the ships that come
within the reach of either of them, for Charibdis they fable to be a Monster
that swalloweth up all things, and the same shortly after sponteth up again.
But in venie deed it is a dangerous Goulfe, Goulfe.
making sore ourrsalles, by reason of the meeting of sundry streams in one
point. And Seilla in very deed is a great rock Rock.
in the same straight, standing so directly against Charibdis, that except the
ships cu^ and take course even justly between both, they hardly escape,
drowning, And because that Scilla a far of, represents to the ^ie, the figure
and shape of a christen body, and to the, ear (by roaring and reason of beating
of the waves) is represented the barking of dogs. Therefore the Poets have
fained, that Scilla is a Monster of the Sea, having in the upper part the
shape of a maiden, and in the nether part, the likeness of a Fish, the body
of a Wolf, and the tail of a Dolphin fish, as witnesses Virgilius in the
third Uolume of the Aeneidos. Albeit Homere writes Scilla has six heads and
twelve feet, and barketh like a Dog. N. Vdal.

CHARIOT.
What a Chariot is, and how they were used at the first, and after put down.
AChariot (which we call a Cart) was a certain Engine of war, Psalm. 20. 7.
made with long and sharp pikes of iron, set in the forefront, and with three
sharp pointed swords on either side. And behind it had sharp crooked yrons
made much like Sithes, or rather like Sickles for the crookedness thereof, And
of these manner of sharp, yrons, they are called in the first of Iudicum, and
diverse other places of the old Testament: Currus falcati, sickle Carts The
Horses y^ did draw these Carts were well harnessed, and especially the men y^
rode upon them. These Chariots was a terrible kind of Engine, and in great
price among the Egyptians, as it appears by king Pharao, when he followed
the Children of Israel with ^00. of chosen Chariots. And in what estimation
they were in among the Philistines, ye shall find in the first book of the
Kings. 13. Chapter, that they came against king Saul with thirty thousand
Chariots, beside other horsemen and warriors a great number. Vigetius in his
third book de re militari, says that Chariots were most used of Darius,
Antiochus and Mithridates: but at length the Romans invented a trick, that
caused Chariots to be nothing set by. The invention was this: They invented
Caltropes, which when the Chariot came nigh unto them with a great race and
mighty force, they did cast from them their Caltropes, which pricked their
horses in the feet so sore, that down came the Chariots, horsemen and all.
This invention says Vigetius, caused chariots to be laid down. But here in
this realm of England, they were had in use and great price, at such time as
Julius Caesar (after he had conquered France) came into the land called
Britain: Julius Caesar does not call them Currus falcatus, but he in his 5.
book of his Commentaries does call the^ Esseda, and the chariot driuers
Essedarij. These be his words: Equites Britaniorum Essedarij^ acriter praelio,
cum equitatu nostra in itinere confluxerunt: The horsemen of the Britains and
their chariot men very fiercely did set upon our men says Julius Caesar.
Thus ye see in what estimation Chariots were in the old time, insomuch that the
Prophet David (which had all his confidence in the Lords help) said: Hij in
curribus, and hij in equis, etc. Some put their trust in horses, and some in
chariots, but we will put our trust in the name of the Lord our God. Ri. Turnar.

Because they had iron Chariots. Iudi. 1. 19.
He that shall read the Iliades of Homer, shall easelie perceive, that the men
in the old time used Chariots in battles, and also the same may be gathered
both out of the most ancient histories, and also out of the later writers, and
amongst other, Quintus Curtius writing the life of Alexander, does plainly
make mention of such Chariots in the battle ^ought against Darius. But I
think no Writer writes more plainly of them, then does Pliny. For he in
that Battles wherein Antiochus was overcome of the Romans, which is in the
4. Decade, and 7. book, thus describes Chariots, Chariots described
which he calls hooked. He says that they were chiefelie fonsed after this
manner. The points about the draught tree standing out from the yoke, had as it
were horns, wherewith, whatsoever they met, they might thrust it through, and
two hooks hong out at the end of the Cart, the one even with the Cart, the
other fastened downward to the earth. The former served to cut a sonder,
whatsoever came on the side of it, the other was made to crush them, which fell
down, and went under. There were also two sundry hooks fastened after the
same sort, to the Exeltrees of both the wheels, etc. The use therefore of these
Chariots, endured till y^ time that An^ochus was overcome. Howbeit we never
read that y^ Romans used them, And that they were horible to behold, and hard
to be conquered, may manifestly be gathered by the book of Joshua: for there
in the 17. Chapter, when the Tribe of Joseph complained, because it was so
many in number, and had obtained so narrow a Lot, Joshua commanded this, that
if they had not room enough, they should go and dwell or else conquer the
places of their Enemies adioining unto them. They excusod themselves y^ they
could not do so, because their neighbors had iron Chariots. But to repeat
more auncienter things, Pharao (as it is written in the book of Exodus) when
he persecuted the Israelites which fled, is said to have had Chariots, and with
the same he took upon him to enter into the Sea, but they being overthrown by
the power of God, he was punished for breaking his fidelity. Pet. Mar. upon
Iudic. fol. 32.

CHARITY.
What Charity is.
Charity is the love of thy neighbor. The rule of Charity is this: Do as
thou would be done unto: for Christ holds all alike, the rich, the poor,
the friend and the foe, the thankful and the unthankful, the kinsman and
stranger. Book of Mar. fol. 1112.

Charity is a good and a gracious effect of the soul, whereby man's heart has
no fantasy to esteem, valor, or ponder any thing in this wide world, beside
or before the care and study to know God, etc. Lupset.

Look. Love.

CHASTISE.
What the word Chastise betokens.
TO chastise is to correct one to his behoof. And therefore here is to be
noted the difference between the afflictions of the godly and the ungodly.
For the godly are afflicted to their own profit: namely that they may be
nurtured unto patience, and held fast in the fear of the Lord, according as
ye may see in Job. ^. 17. Iere. 31. 18. and 46. 28. Pro. 3. 11. Heb. 12. 10.
But the correction of ye ungodly, is called a consuming of them Iere. 30. 23.
24. and 46. 10. And therefore the chosen to amend at the Lords chastisement, as
David 2. Reg. 12. 13. But the reprobate are hardened the more by Gods scourges
as Pharao was Exo. 9. 7. 35. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 69.

O Lord correct me, Ier. 10. 24.
but with judgment. Considering that God had revealed unto him the certainty
of their captivity (meaning the Jews) chap. 7. 16. He only prays that he
would punish them with mercy, which Esaias calls in measure chap. 27. 8.
measuring his rods by their infirmity. 1. Cor. 10. 13. For hereby Judgment
is meant not only punishment, but also the merciful moderation of the same, as
chap. 30. 11.

Look. Affliction. Punishment.

CHASTITY.
How Hierom expounds chastity.
HE expounds it of virginity only, as though they that were married could
not be chaste: or though the Apostles did write these things only to virgins.
In the first and second chapter to Tit. he warns also Bishops, young men, and
married folks both man and wife, to be chaste and pure. Luther upon the Gal.
fol. 262.

And there be some chaste which made themselves chaste, Ma. 19. 12.
etc. He makes himself chaste Chaste.
for y^ Kingdom of heaven sake, which either having the gift of sole life,
uses the same to the setting forth of Gods word: or else being a perfect and
a natural man, takes to himself an honest yoake-fellowe, and lives in chaste
wedlock with her, setting forth nevertheless GODS truth to his uttermost
power. Sir. I. Cheek.

The word Chaste, signifies, Gelded, and they were so made, because they should
keep the chambers of noble women, for they were judged chaste. Geneua.

There he some, etc. which have the gift of continence, and use it to serve
God with more free liberty. Geneua.

Objection.
How can ye prove that they which make themselves chaste, or gelde themselves
for the kingdom of heavens sake, have received the gift of chastity before.

Answer.
When the Apostles had said: If the matter be so between man and wife, then it
is not good to marie. Our Savior Christ did answer and say: All men be not
able to comprehend or receive this saying, but they to whom it is given. Now,
if ye will ask me who they be that geld themselves, or make themselves chaste
for the kingdom of heavens sake: I will answer that they gelde themselves and
make themselves chaste for the kingdom of heaven sake, unto whom it is given.

He that is able to receive this, let him receive it. Ma. 19. 1^
This gift (meaning. Chastity) is not common for all men, but is very rare
and given to few: therefore men may not rashly abstain from marriage. Geneua.

How in breaking of Chastity, the one part may offend, and not the other.
An adulterer abuses a woman's body against her will, the man does sin, and
yet the woman is undefiled, because her mind is chaste and unspotted.

Lucretia the Roman Matrone, lives chaste for ever, of whose body though
proud Tarquinius Son had his pleasure, yet her mind continued still, most
chaste and faithful to her husband, and therefore, she not consenting in
heart to sin, is by Fame recorded to be the Ornament of all womanhood and
perfect Chastity, and therefore says Saint Hierom very well, Corpus
mulieris, etc. Not violence but will, does defile a woman's body.

S. Augustine to Victorianus says: Hiero. li. Heb. que,
Ad Deum ingemiscentibus, etc. August. victoria. Epist. 122
He will ever be present with his, that sigh and groan to God, as he has wont
to be present with his, and either he suffers nothing to be done in their
chaste bodies by devilish lust: or if he does suffer, where are their mind is
not defiled with any filthiness of consent, he does defend his own flesh
from offense. And whatsoever either the lust of the patient, has either not
consented unto, nor suffered, it shall be the fault of the only doer. And all
that violence shall not be imputed for the filthiness of corruption, but for the
wound of suffering. For the soundness of Chastity is of such force in the
mind, that when the mind is undefiled, chastity cannot be defiled in the
body, whose members might have been disseuered one from another. In another
place: Magis timeamus, etc. Let us fear more, least the inward understanding
being corrupt, the chastity of faith, does therewith perish, rather then least
women should be violently defiled in their flesh: for chastity is not defiled
by violence, if it be kept sound and clear in the mind, forasmuch as none is
defiled, when the will of the suffered does not filthelie use the flesh, but
suffers that thing without consent, which another does work by violence.

Of counterfeit Chastity.
S. Paul foretells of Antichrists disciples. 2. Tim. 4. that they shall
bear a great countenance of continent life, and forbid marriage. And of such S.
Hierom says: Hierome. cap. 7. li. 2
Iactant pudicitiam suam impudenti facie: They make bragges of their chastity,
with whorish countenance. Jewel. fol. 482.

CHAVNCE.
How nothing comes by hap and chance.
THe providence of God is of that nature, that through the immutable certainty
thereof, whereby all things be ruled, it excludes all chances and hap of
fortune. I call it chance and hap of fortune, whatsoever appears and betideth
unlooked for, vnforeseene, at all adventures, and without any sure cause or
reason, so that it appears to be done, by no foresight at all, neither of God
neither of man, such as without number does befall among men in the world.
Therefore look how much any does yield unto chance and fortune, so much he
does pull away from the providence of God. Unto good christian men it is a
clear case, y^ there chances nothing throughout all the whole world at hazard
or all adventures with the providence of God which disposes all. Wherefore my
judgment is (says Musculus) that chance and fortune be vain words, and to
no purpose. Musculus. fol. 432.

Achab the king when he went on warre-fare, changed his apparel, and would
not be known to be the king, but be counted a rascal soldier, yet was he
slain with an Arrow, which was shot at adventure, which thing might have been
seemed to have been done by chance, when as yet God in very deed governed
the shot. And in like manner as Plutarch tells, Pirrhus was slain of a woman
in besieging Thebes, she throwing down a Tyle from the house top. Uerie
many such things are done in our time, which seem unto us therefore to have
happened by chance, because we know not the causes of things and judgments of
God. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 172.

Look Fortune.

CHAVNTER.
What this word signifies.
TO the Chaunter. Psalm. 4.
That is here translate to the Chaunter is in Hebrew Lamnazah, which word
after y^ mind of Abrah, Ezra, and David Kimhi expositours in Hebrew,
signifies to the chief of the singers, which we commonly call in English
setters of the quiers or chaunter^ This interpretation also, do both the most
and best learned of the Latinists best allow, and therefore have I followed the
same, the whole Psalter through. Expressing it by this word chaunter.
Notwithstanding diverse Authors do diversely interpret it. Some say it
signifies to the victor or ouercommer: Some to the victory: which may thus
agree and concord together, if thou take a Psalm to be a stirring and an
exhortation to put our trust in God, being sure to obtain the victory: And
where some interpret unto the end, understand even the same: For therefore do
we put our trust in God, that we may come to ye end of the victory. Some
translate the title thus: A vehement and often made exhortation in instruments
of music, a Psalm to David, that is as they themselves expound it, a Psalm
reuelate to David, for David is in Hebrew the Dative case, and not the
Genitius. T. M.

CHEEK.
What is meant by turning of the cheek.
Whosoever (says Christ) shall smite thee on the right cheek, Mat. ^. 39.
turn to him the other also. To turn the other cheek is a manner of
speaking, and not to be understood as the words do sound, and it is to cut of
the hand, and to pluck out the eye: And as we command our children not only
come nie a brook or water, but also not so hardy to look that way, either
to look on fire, or once to think on fire, which are impossible to be
observed. More is spoken then meant, to fear them, and to make them perceive,
that it is earnest that we command: even so is the meaning here, that we in
no wise avenge, but be prepared even to suffer as much more, and never think it
lawful to avenge, how great so ever the injury be: for he himself, turned not
the other cheek when he was smitten before the Bishop: nor yet Paul when he
was buffeted before the Bishop also, etc. Tindale. fol. 210.

We ought so patiently to suffer all wrongs, that we should rather turn the
other cheek, then show any token of impatience. In the mean season it
pertains unto the Gods, that is to say, unto the Magistrates and Judges, to
revenge the wrongs of the oppressed. Sir I. Cheek.

Rather receive double wrong, then revenge thine own griefs. Geneua.

CHEMARIMS.
What the Chemarims were.
ANd he put down the Chemarims. ^. Reg. 2^. 3.
That is, the ministers of Baal, so called because they were clad with black
clothes or smoky. chemarim signifies smoky or burnt, or black monks of Baal,
and so do the Jews call them. T. M.

Meaning the Priests of Baal, which were called Chemarims, either because they
wear black garments, or else were smoked with burning insence to Idols.
Geneua.

CHERINTHVS.
Of his most foolish and damnable opinions.
CHerinthus a Jew taught circumcision, Heretic
and that the Prophets and the law was given by Angels, and that the world
was made by them. He said also that Jesus was not borne of a virgin, but was
the son of Marie and Joseph, and that Jesus was not Christ, but that Christ

and reign in the world the space of one thousand years after his
resurrection, and then should ascend into heaven with his people, where they
should live always in pleasure of gluttony and fleshly lusts. He was about
the year of Christ. 88.

Of the sodeine death of this Cherinthus.
John the E^angelist (on a time) came into a bath, where he found Cherinthus
the heretic sitting with a company about him, disputing and divining Christ
to be man Whose unshamefast blasphemies grieved John so much, that he with his
company rose up and departed from them, who was no sooner gone out of the
house, but it fell upon Cherinthus and slew him and all his company. Euse li.

CHERVB.
What a Cherub is.
IT is an Hebrew word, and signifies properly Volucres a Bird. And in the
plural number it signifies also a certain high order of Angels, which be
most swift and ready in the executing of Gods commandments. And Cherubin when
it is taken for y^ high order of Angels, is as much to say in latin, as
Sciencia multitudo, the multitude of science or cunning. Of the Angels y^ be of
this order, there is much mention in the Scriptures of the old Testament. In
the third Chapter of Genesis, we read that God did set an Angel of the high
order of Cherubins, to keep Adam out of Paradise. And in Exodus, when God
shows to Moses the fashion of the Sanctuary, and of y^ Arc of covenant and
of the propiciatorie seat. These were dead Images they were no living
Angels, but only ordained by the commandment, partly to adourne the
propiciatorie seat, and partlye to pluck the hearts of the rude people, to
the admiration of Gods most high glory, by the golden glory of the two
Cherubins, which were made as the Hebrews say, like two young children with
wings. And by the way, here it might peradventure be reasoned, why it is not
lawful for us then, to set up golden Images as well in our Churches, as it was
lawful for the Israelites to have golden Cherubs in their Tabernacles, they
had the same commandment that we have, Non facies tibi scultile, Thou shall
make thee no graven Image. To this argument it may be easily answered thus:
From the time that the veil of the Temple was miraculouslie rent in pieces,
from the top to the ground at the suffering of Messiah our Lord: all the
Jews law apperteining either to the civil order of the people, either else
to the Ecclesiastical ordering of the people, which laws be commonly called
Laws Judicial and Laws ceremonial, both these kind of laws were utterly
by the virtue of Christ's passion, fulfilling that in deed, whereof they were a
figure to come, the thing being fulfilled, the shadow was taken away,
abolished, and utterly abrogated. This is a plain and flat answer: and it
serves to the soluting of many like kind of cauillations drawn out of the
ceremonies and judicials of the old law, etc. Ric. Turnar

CHERVBIN.
What the Cherubins were.
AScendit super Cherubin and volau^t. Psalm. 10. 18
The Lord has ridden upon Cherubin and has flowen. The Cherubins that is
spoken of here, are the Angels of God, of whom Esaie the Prophet speaks in
the sixth Chapter, Esai^. 6. 3.
saying: Clamabant alter ad alteram, dicentes: Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus,
Dominus Deus sabbath, plena est omnis terra gloria eius: Cherubin and Seraphin
cried one to an other, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of sabbath, all the earth
is full of thy glorie^ Upon these Angels called Cherubin, that is to say, by
interpretation, the multitude of science, y^ Lord rides. For both al knowledge
is subject unto God, and also he rides upon Cherubin. For he has the^ which
of y^ property of swiftness in doing the messenges, and executing the
commandments of God, are called Cherub in the singular number. i. Volucris,
or Cherubin in the plural number. i. Volucres. He has these Angels at all
times to do all his commandments. And this readiness and swiftness of
Cherubin which are but Gods creatures and Gods messengers, do declare and set
out unto us mortal men, that great majesty of God wonderfully. So that these
words of the Prophet. The Lord rides upon Cherubin, are no more to say, but
the Lord is of such might and unspeakable majesty, y^ as all men do bring
their matters quickly to pass by the help of swift running horses, so the
Lord for his matters to be accomplished, in steed of horses he uses swift
Angels called Cherubin. And if ye cannot (says the Prophet) perceive the
swiftness of Angels, by means that they are spirits invisible, then will I
declare the incomparable speed in preferring of Gods commandment, by a
material and sensible thing that ye daily see, which thing is nothing else but
the wind. The winds are of such swiftness, that nothing can express how
swiftly they blow from the East, to the full West, and from the South to the
full North. They occupy no space but it is done with full blast, even sodeinlie.
Even so does God by his infinite power work things with such swiftness that as
I might say ( Per presepopoliam) volauit super pennas ventorum. He has not
ridden, but he has flowen, not with swallows wings, but with wings of the
wind: that is as much to say, as with incomparable and unspeakable
swiftness, does God by his divine power, bring all things to pass, that his
blessed pleasure is to be done. Ric. Turnar.

CHILDREN.
How children are not forbidden to come to Christ.
SUffer ye children to come unto me, Luke 18. 16.
etc. Unto such as children be, does the kingdom of God perteine, therefore
ought children to be brought unto Christ, not only by Baptime, which is the
seal of the kingdom of heaven, but also by godly education and bringing up.
Sir I. Cheek.

They brought unto him also Babes. Luke 18. 15
The children were tender and young, in that they were brought, which appears
more euidentilie in that, that they were infants: which is to be marked against
them that are enemies to the baptising of child (...) Beza.

And shall be filled with the holy Ghost. Luke 1. 15.
Since that children m^ie be filled with the holy Ghost, even in their mothers
wombe^ who can forbid them to be baptized? For Saint Peter says, who can
forbid those folks to be baptized with water, since that they have received the
holy Ghost as well as we?

Act. ^o1. 47. Again, Paul faith: He that has not the spirit of Christ, is
not his. But the children are Christ's, they then have the spirit of Christ, and
so ought to be baptized. Sir I. Check.

Look Baptising of children.

How children ought to be brought up.
Saint Paul's doctrine is, Ephe. 6. 4.
that children be brought up in godliness and good civility, which both be
comprehended in his words, when he says: Ye parents bring up your children in
nurture and awe of the Lord. The same is taught and confirmed in Tobie, Tobi.
1. 10.
where he says: All the days of thy life bear God in thy mind, and beware
thou consent not unto sin. First, he wills him to study godliness, and
next to beware of sin, that he be not entised thereunto. Hemming.

Of children adopted.
Look Adoption.

Of the children of this world.
Children of this world are wiser in their generation, Luke 16. 8.
then the children of light. This is a most grievous complaint, that worldly
men are more careful in getting temporal goods, which perteine only to this
present life, and continue but a very short time, then Christians are careful
for the getting of heavenly goods, which shall endure for ever. Hemming.

Men that are given to this present life, contrary to whom the children of
light are set. S. Paul calls those spiritual, and the other carnal. Beza.

How the children of God, are helped of the Infidels.
And all that were about them strengthen^d their hands with vessels of silver
and gold, ^. Esd. 1. 6.
etc. The Babilonians and Chaldeans gave them these gifts. Thus rather then the
children of God should want for their necessities, he would stir up the very
hearts of Infidels to help them. Geneua.

What is understood by children in this place.
If a man die having no children, Ma. 22. ^4.
etc. Under which name are daughters also comprehended, but yet as touching the
family and name of a man, because he that left daughters was in no better
case, then if he had left no children at all (for they were not reckoned in the
family.) By the name of children are sons understood. Beza.

CHILIASSIS.
Of the fond opinion of this man.
THe Chiliassis who^ in latin we may call Mellenarij, thought that this
inheritance of the whole world shall be declared before the end of this world,
when Christ as they thought should reign a thousand years in this world with
his Saints, having destroyed and overcome all the wicked. And these men it
should seem followed the Oracle, which is said to come from Elias, y^ the
world should endure. 6000. years, and these years they thus describe, saying
that 2000. years passed away before the law. 2000. under the law, and so
many shall be under y^ Gospel. Afterward they add a thousand years, in
which, say they shall be the chief rest: so that the thousand last years they
call the sabbath. And so they appoint a week, in which every particular day
is called for a thousand years, according to that which is said, A thousand
years is with the Lord as one day: and again, One day as a thousand years.
Augustine makes mention of this opinion in his 20. book, and 7^ chapter, De
ciuitate Dei, and says that it was after ^ (...) tolerable, and that he
himself once was of the same opinion. But that which they added concerning
pleasures, delighte, and worldly honors, which they said all the faithful
should for the space of those thousand years, eni^ie togethers with Christ,
he ear^estly veproueth, etc. Eus^bius Cesariensis in the third book of his
history, says that this opinion had his beginning of Cheri^hus the heretik, of
whom. D^omsius Bishop of Alexandria exp^unding the Apocalips of John thus
writes: That he was altogether given to lusts and unto the belly, and
therefore attributed these carnal delights unto the kingdom of Christ which
should continue a thousand years. Pet. Man. upon the Romans fol. 88.

CHORE.
How this Psalm made by the children of Chore, is understood.
A Mystical Psalm made by the children of Chore. Psalm. 42.
We read in the 16. Chapter of the book of Numeri, that a certain man named
Chore (which was the great Nephew of the Patriarch Leui, or else to whom Leui
was Perannus his great graund-father) with other Captains mo, rebelled against
Moses and Aaron, whose fact displeased almighty God so sore, that he caused
the earth to open and to swallowe up Chore with all his company, their wives,
children, and all their substance.

Now seeing that all his substance, wife, and children, went the same way that
he did, how can it be true that the children of Chore should be makers and
setters forth of this 42. Psalm. of David, as the title thereof makes mention.
To this question, answer is made in the 26. of Nu. where it is written, y^
when Chore was swallowed up of the earth, God miraculouslie preserved certain
of Chores children, of whose offspring there came afterward, certain that
proved very excellent learned men, and notable wise men, namely these four,
Ethan, Heman, Calcal, and Darda, as who should say these men excelled all
other. Lo, such noble men came of the spring of Chore, of whom the title of
this Psalm and diverse other Psalms to their perpetual name and renown,
does make mention, calling them the children of Chore, because they sprang of
y^ seed of Chore and of his children, whom God did miraculously preserve from
the swallowing of the earth, and not because they were his natural children.
For it is well known that Chore lived in Moses time, against who^ he was y^
chief in stirring up of rebellion against him. Again, Ethan, Heman, Calcal,
and Darda (which were the natural sons of Mahol) lived and flourished in
Salomons time, which was 400. and almost or altogether fourscore years after
that Chore was killed. So that these men could not be the natural sons of
Chore, but they are called his children and his sons, because they came of
his porgenie, and of his offspring.

CHOSEN.
Wherefore we are chosen.
WE are not chosen of God to break his commandments, but for to live in
holiness and righteousness all the days of our life.

How God has chosen us, and we not him.
You have not chosen me, says Christ, Ioh. 15. 16.
but I have chosen you. Who hearing this saying of our Lord, dare be so bolds
as to say, that men are chosen through belief, whereas rather they are chosen
that they may believe, least y^ they should be found to have chosen Christ
first, contrary to the sentence of the truth, unto whom Christ says, you have
not chosen me, but I have chosen you. Pet. Viret.

Objection.
We were chosen (do some say) before the foundations of the world were made,
because that God did foresee that we should be good, and not that he himself
should make us good.

Answer.
God says, ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, for if he had
therefore chosen us, because he had foreseen that we should be good, he
should also have known before, that we should have chosen him. Veron.

How God is said not to have chosen many wise men.
Paul says, that God has not chosen many wise men after the flesh, 1. Cor.
1. 26
nor many men of power, nor many noble men borne. And yet the same man says,
God will have all men saved: how then does he nor choose: God is said not to
have chosen them, not because he would not have them saved, but for the sequel
of it, that is to say, because the wisdom of this world, power, and
nobility of birth, do like baits entice and withdraw many from the obedience
of the Gospel. David was rich and puissant, and so was Nero. But David was not
entised by the riches and power, to fall from the Gospel, as Nero was to his
own destruction. And so forth of other like. Hemmyng.

Of Marie Magdalens good choosing.
Marie has chosen that good part. Luke 10. 42.
which shall not be taken from her. She has chosen the hearing of the word of
God, which ever endures and is the only way to everlasting life. Tindale.

The good part, that is, the hearing of the word of God, from the which it was
not meet that she should be drawn, having not always opportunity to hear
the same. The Bible note.

How God chooses two manner of ways.
I have chosen you twelve says the Lord, John. 6. 70
and one of you is the devil. It is to be understood that there is two manner
of choosing. The one whereby the Apostles were chosen to that most worthy
office of Apostleshippe that they were in, and the other whereby they were chosen
into life everlasting. Therefore when Christ says that Judas was chosen with
the other Apostles, that same must be understood of the office whereunto he was
called and chosen with the other. For when he speaks of the election that does
perteine to life everlasting, he does altogether exclude him from the number
of the chosen. I do not (says he) speak of you all, I know whom I have
chosen. I. Veron.

CHRISOLITE.
The nature of this stone, and what it betokens.
The seventh a Chrisolite. Ape. 21. 2^
This stone glittereth like gold, and casts out burning sparks. Whereby are
meant those that understand the divine Scriptures and both in word and work,
do utter that unto others, which they themselves understand. Marl. fol. 300.

The seventh foundation is of a Chrisolite or Turcas, which shines as gold,
and seems as it should send forth sparks, under this are they
comprehended, which having the wisdom of the spirit, inflameth other with it,
provoking them thereby to the love of God and their neighbor. This did Moses
and Esau, Barnabas and Paul, in whom the glory of the Lord appeared
plenteouslie. Bale.

CHRISOTRACE.
The description of this stone, and what it betokens.
THe (...) a Chrisoprade. Ape. 21. 20
This is of a green color intermedled with gold, and it betokens such as
resembles the freshness of the everlasting country by charitable
intercommuning one with an other. Mirl. upon the Apoc. fol. 300.

The tenth was a Chrisoprace, whose condition is to shine like gold, and yet
he is green in sight. Such are they which having godly wisdom, utters it
according to the talent given them of the Lord, thereby renewing the dull
spirits of other unto heavenly things. Among this sort may (...) be numbered,
which saw many wonderful visions. And so may Simeon and Anna in the
Gospel. Bale.

CHRIST.
How Christ was first promised to Adam.
WHen the first man Adam through the craft and subtlety of the Serpent (whom
the devil had set for his minister to deceive him) had lost the felicity of
Paradise, Genesis 3.
and made himself and all his posterity for ever subject to death and all
other calamities and nuseries of this world (where before it was in his power
always to have lived.) Then almighty God for the salvation of mankind,
promised that of the seed of the woman Christ should come and destroy the
power of Satan, and deliver us free from sin and death. Lanquet.

How Christ grew in age and wisdom.
Christ as touching his Godhead, did not grow in age, Luke 2. ^2.
wisdom, and favor, but in respect of his manhood, in that he was very man,
whose example would God we could follow, that as we grow in years, so we might
grow in wisdom and favor with God and men. Hemming.

How Christ is called David's son.
If David call him Lord, M^. 22. 45
how is he then his son. Christ in that he is a very natural man is David's
son, but in that he is a true and a natural God, equal with the Father, he
is also his Lord. Sir I. Cheek.

How Christ had moneie.
Look Moneie.

Why Christ became man.
As through a natural man we were banished out of Paradise, ^en. 3.
made the children of dampnation, so it pleased the almighty trinity, neither
by an Angel, nor Archangell, but by a natural man to restore us again, and
made us heirs of salvation, 1. Cor. 15. 31.
as Paul witnesses, By a man came death, and by a man comes the
resurrection of the dead, for as by Adam all die, even so by Christ all be made
alive. R. Hutchynson.

Why Christ fasted.
Like as it pleased God to give power unto Moses xl. days, twice in the
mountain, not for the avoiding of temptation, but for to set forth the
glorious law, and will of the Father then to be published. And Elias being
sent to anoint a king over Siria, and a king and a Prophet over Israel, by whom
both these kingdoms should be clean altered and changed, did fast forty
days from all manner meats, Fasted.
for the declaring of the power of God in his works. So did it please Christ of
his own power to fast forty days, that the Jews should have none occasion
to think him inferior to those tw^ their great Prophets, in the publishing of
his Gospel and glad tidings unto the world, and his renewing of all things:
not to the intent that we should follow him, and thereby have purgation for
our sins. For beside that, it is impossible to follow him (without an
especial work of the spirit) either in that he fasted forty days, or in
that he was never hungry: This were a plain denial of the benefits of his
passion, and the setting up of our own work which is imperfect. For what
great matter is it to eat meat but once every day, and to drink two or
three times, many have so lived in old y^ time. And what holiness is it to eat
fish only, do not Cormerants and such as live by the sea side, live so like
wise. Christ has commanded us to follow him in love, peace, mercy, and such
like: But in this example (as a thing impossible) we have no such
commandment, except we be drawn into wilderness by the spirit, as Christ
was, or by any other work of God, we be destitute of food and the comfort of
creatures. Then, lo y^ example of Christ may strength us, and teach, that not
by bread only do we live, but by every word that proceed out of the mouth
of God. A. G. fol. 187.

Look Holy.

Why Christ is called true.
Look True.

Why Christ was borne of a woman.
Why was Christ borno of a woman: truly because ^nne and death ouerflowed
the world through the first woman, he works the mystery of life and
righteousness by an other woman, Woman.
that the blame of sin should not be imputed to the creature which is good,
but to the will by which Eve sinned. R. Hutehynson.

Why Christ died for us.
And I was dead. Apoc. 1. 18
This cannot be verified of the Angels because they be invisible and immortal
spirits. But Christ to obeie his Father, and to wash away the sins of
mankind, was contented to yield himself to death for a time, to the intent
that he might at length by death, destroy him that had y^ power of death (that
is to wit the devil) and set them at liberty, which for fear of death were
subject to bondage all their life long. Died.
Heb. 2. 14. 15 for even from the beginning God purposed upon the sacrifice,
wherein Christ the true shepherd of all men, gave his life for his sheep.
John. 10. 15. 17. And like as Christ the head of the Church, entered into his
glory by death. Luke 24. 26. So becomes it all the godly to die with him,
that they may be glorified together with him, according as Paul teaches.
Romans 8. 17. 2. Timo. 2. 12. 13. and Acts. 14. 22. Marl. fol. 27.

Christ died for us. Romans 5. 8.
They allege also that Christ died for us all, and thereof they infer that
his benefits is common to all men, which thing we also will easily grant, if
only the worthiness of the death of Christ be considered, for as touching
it, it might be sufficient for all the sins of the world, but although in it
self it be sufficient, yet it neither had, nor has, nor shall have effect in
all men: which thing the schoolmen also confess, when they affirm that
Christ has redeemed all men sufficiently, but not effectually: for there
unto it is necessary that the death of Christ be healthful unto us, that we
take hold of it, which cannot otherwise be done, then by ^aith, which faith is
the gift of God, and not given to all men. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 305

Objection.
why did Christ choose to die upon the cross, before other kind of death.

Aunsvvere.
Truly because this kind of death is accursed, and all that die on it, as it
is written: Cross.
Cursed is every one that hangs on tree: for so it comes to pass, that
Christ was accursed for us, to deliver us from Gods curse as Paul says:
Christ has delivered us from the curse of the law, in that he was made
accursed for us. Gal. 3. 13.
R. Hutchynson.

The time and hour of Christ's crucifieng.
One of the Euangellsts says y^ Christ was crucified the third hour, Mar. 15.
25.
and the other the sixth hour. Augustine affirms both to be true: for y^ Jews
at the third hour cried, Crucify, Crucified
crucify, wherefore as touching them they slew the Lord then, Ma. 27. 45.
who yet was afterward at the sixth hour crucified by the soldiers of Pilate.
Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 166.

Of Christ's calling upon God in his passion.
My God, Ma. 27. 46
my God, wh^e have thou forsaken me. Notwithsta^nding y^ he feels himself as
it were wounded with Gods wrath, and forsaken for our sins, yet he cease
not to put his confidence in God, and call upon him, which is written to teach
us in all afflictions fo trust still in God, be the assalts never so grievous
unto the flesh. Geneua.

How Christ baptized, and baptized not.
Though that Jesus himself baptized not, John. 4. 2.
but his disciples. It is said in the 22. verse of the chapter going before, y^
Christ was in Iewrie, and that he there baptized, Baptized.
the which Saint John here expounds saying, that he baptized by his
disciples. Therefore the Lord baptized and baptized not. For he baptized,
because it was he y^ cleansed, washed, and purified the sin, He baptized not,
because he used not the outward sacrament of dipping or ducking in the water.
The Disciples used the ministry of the body, And he joined therewith his
majesty and grace. Therefore the Lord baptized by the ministry of his
Disciples Marl. fol. 10^.

Of Christ's humanity.
The Marin Vigilius Vigilius.
says, Dei filius secundu humanitatem, etc. The son of God according to his
manhood is departed from us, according to his Godhead he is ever with us.
Vigilius li, 2. contra Euti.

Cyrillus Cyrillus
says: Secundum carnem, etc. according to the flesh only he would depart but
by the presence of his Godhead, he is ever present. Cyrillus in John. li. 9.
cap. 21.

Gregory Gregory
says: Verlium incarnat^m manet and recaedet, etc. The word incarnate both
ab^deth with us and departs from us. It abides with us by the Godhead, it
departs from us by the body or manhood ^ Gregory de pasc. homi. 30.

Augustine Augustine
says: Ibat per id, quod, home erat, etc. Christ departed by y^ he was man,
and abode by y^ he was God. He departed by that y^ he was in one place, he abod
by y^ y^ he was in all places.

The heavens, says Saint Peter, Peter
must contain and hold him, until the time that all things be restored.
Act. 3. 21.

Cyrillus Cyrillus
says: Christus non poterat, etc. Christ could not be conversant with his
Apostles in his flesh, after he ascended unto the Father. Cyril in John. li.
11. chap. 3.

Of Christ's descending into hell, three opinions.
Lyra says, 1. opinion
y^ Christ's soul was 39. hours in Lymbo sanctoru patrum. In y^ place where y^
souls of y^ holy Patriarks were reserved and kept till Christ's coming: he
says y^ Christ's soul was 39. hours in y^ place which he calls Lymbus, y^
is to say, from y^ 9. hour of good fridaie, which we after our counting of y^
clock do take to be toward night, as it were about 3. of y^ clock in y^ after
noone, until y^ dawning of Easter day in y^ morning. But I doubt of this
doctrine (says y^ Author) and y^ for two causes. Once we read. y^ Christ
hanging upon y^ cross, did give up his soul, commending it into the hands
and tuition of his Father, saying. Pater, in manus, etc. Again we read, that
Christ hanging upon the cross, said to the good thief that said: Remember me
O Lord, when thou shall come into thy kingdom, Christ answered y^ thief and
said^ Hodie mecum eris in Paradiso: This day thou shall be with are in
paradise, weigh these words well. First Christ said, Hodie, to day, y^ is to
say, immediately, after thy soul shall depart out of thy body, Mecu^ eris, Thou
shall be y^ me, where, In Paradiso, in paradise, what shall we call paradise? Shall
we not understand y^ kingdom of heaven by paradise, seeing y^ thief said.
Remember me when thou co^mest into thy kingdom: where is Christ's kingdoe but in
heaven. Lyra does wrest this word paradise to signify Limbu^ sanctoru^ patru^.
But Theophilactus grau^teth y^ paradise and the kingdom of heaven is all one
thing in understanding, and yet he seems to lene to this conclusion. Quod
Christ^s eu^ men^e ingressus est paradisu^, in infernu^ desce^det cu^ a^ima.
And yet he denies y^ thief had y^ fulness of glory, yea, or y^ the souls of
y^ patriarks and other saints departed in of y^ faith of Christ, have y^
fullness of joys and glory, which they shall have at y^ day of dome when y^
body and y^ soul shall be united together, and yet he grants y^ the theefs
soul went straight to y^ kingdom of heaven S. Augustine in an epistle y^ he
wrote to Euodius, affir moth plainly: Quod anima Christi descendit ad infernos,
y^ Christ in his soul while his body lay dead in y^ grave, went down into
hell: whom Saint Bede does follow. Saint Hierome in his commentaries that he
written upon y^ Psalter, ( Si tamen Hieronimi sint) has these words: Non
derelinques qua ipsa ad inferna defcendit: vt electos suos eijcerit, and
diabolos ligaret, qua antea iactitabat se esse omniu^ Dominu^ nunc omnium
seruus. And therefore S. Hierome in a certain Epistle has these words: Quid
homine imbecilius qui a carne sua vincitur: quid ita homine Christi aut fortius
qui diabolum and mundum vincit? But how? Quia omnia possum in eo qui me
confortat. Because we put our trust in the name of Jesus, which bad us be bold
upon him, saying: Confidete a me, quia ego vici mundum. To tell you more of
their minds, that say that Christ went down into hell in his soul. Saint
Gregory and certain other do add and say moreover: Quod anima Christi
passasi^ apud inferos: And that when John Baptist being in prison and hearing
of the miracles of Christ, sending to Christ two of his Disciples with this
message, saying: Tu es qui venturus, an alium expectamus? The meaning of Saint
John was this. Art thou he or shall we look for an other, not meaning whether
he were the true Messiah incarnate, for then he must have said: Tu es
quivenisti, an alium expectamus, but John said: Tu es qui venturus, an alium
expectamus. Meaning says Saint Gregory, that where now I am in prison, and
see nothing but present death, what shall I in my soul, like as I have been
thy preacher, and thy fore runner here iu earth, shall I in my soul also
preach unto the souls departed in the faith of thee to come. These be Saint
Gregory's words: Debeo te nunciare inferis, qui te nunciam superis.

As touching the second opinion ^. opinion
that Christ descended into hell, not personalie in his soul, Sed in spiritu:
Hoc est viuifica mortis sua virtute: that is, by the might and power of his
rede^mption, that he made upon the cross. This opinion I have not save only
in the learned writers of this our age, which do prove their opinion true by
the words of Saint Peter, written in his first Epistle in the third and fourth
Chapters, which places undoubtedly are very notable. These be the words of
Saint Peter, in the third Chapter. Christus in spiri^u (...), and spiritibus
^ui (...) careete ^ra^t pr^dica^it: Christ in spirit, that is to sale, in the
power of his Godhead, and inerites of his manhood, and virtue of his passion,
went and preached unto the Saints that were in prison, Of the spirits that
were in prison at the time of Christ's suffering under Pontius Pilate, there were
two sundry sorts, good and bad, the souls of Infidels, the souls of ungodly
and wicked livers in this wretched world as Cain, Nemroth, the Sodomits and
Gomorean^, the Philistines, the Iebusites, and Judas the traitor with his
fellows: And the souls of the Patriarchs, Adam, Abel, Seth, Noe, Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, David and all other souls of holy men, and faithful believers
in Christ to come. All flesh, both good and badde were in prison, till at the
suffering of Christ upon the Cross: but yet not all in one prison. The souls
of the Saints, that is, of good men, were by themselves in one society or
fellowship, which the Gospel calls the Bosom of Abraham, and S. Peter
calls it a prison, in respect of the infinite pleasures: To both these sorts
of spirits or souls Christ preached, but after a sundry sort. To the good sort
he preached redemption and satisfaction for their sins, paid by Christ upon
the cross, and thereupon received them into heaven unto himself. To the
souls of the sinful, he preached perpetual pains in Hell never to have
end, but bound, and to burn continually with the Devil, whom they did serve
when they were alive. Of the wicked and damned souls S. Peter gives an
example, by whom all the world may take heed. Of the good souls he gives
no example. But of the damned souls he gives now example by them that lived
i^ Noes^ time, that were disobedient to the preaching of Noe: when the long
suffering of God abode exceeding patiently, but in conclusion, there were no
more saved from drowning, saving only eight persons. That the meaning of S.
Peter in the third chapter, should be this that I have recited, That is, that
Christ in the spirit, that is, in the power and virtue of his passion,
descended into hell, these learned and godly writers do prove by the
exposition that Saint Peter makes of his own words, in the next Chapter
following, where he says thus: Mortuis euangelizatum est, vt iudicentur quidem
secundum homines in carne, viuant autem secundum Deum in spiritu. The Gospel
was preached unto the dead, that they should be judged in the flesh after the
fashion of men, but in the Spiritshould live after the fashion of the son of
God. Here Saint Peter seems to make answer to a secret question that might
have been asked, which is this: If the Gospel, that is the tidings of their
redemption by the merits of Christ's passion was preached the deliverance of
the faithful that were in prison: how came they out, with their bodies or
without their bodies. S. Peter answers, y^ they came out with their souls
alone, for as concerning their bodies they shall be judged secundum homines,
after the fashion of men, that is to say at ye day of doonie. Thus I have
rehearsed to you the second Opinion.

Now shall ye hear briefly of the third Opinion, 3. Opinion
which is that these words: Christus descendit ad inferna, is no distinct nor
several article of our Creed, but rather an exposition of the former clause,
et sepultus est, he was buried. They that be of this Opinion they bring these
reasons, for the proof of their assertion. First S. Cipriane expounding the
Creed, does make no exposition thereoff, but he says: Haec verba non habentur
in symbolo romano. Erasmus expounding the Creed, seems to allow very much
the sentence of S. Cypriane. Insomuch, that he says that Inconcin^itas
sermonis, i. the disordred speech proves these words to be added, for the
exposition of these words: Et sepultus est, otherwise it is the cart before
the horse: yea, Erasmus is so plain, that it is but a patch added unto y^
Creed: that he thinks that S. Thomas, not Thomas the Apostle, but Thomas
Aquina did add to the Creed these words, Descendit ad inferna. These be
Erasmus words: An Thomas Aquina addidit sub dubito. Furthermore they bring in
for their purpose, this argument in the Creed read at the holy Communion
called Symbolum necenum. And likewise in the Counsel set forth in the three
other general counsels, there is no mention of these words, Descendit ad
inferna. And where as Athanasius in his Creed, which we call Quicunque vult,
has these words, Descendit ad inferna, they grant, but yet only in steed of
these words, Et sepultus est, which all other Credes have. And Athanasius used
in the steed thereof, Descendit ad inferna. And to prove Descendere in infernum
may rightly signify I was buried, they allege the words of Jacob, dolens
Joseph discerptum a bestia, Descendam ad filium meum lugens in infernu^
morietur pater noster, and deducent samuli tui cauos eius, cum dolor ad
infernum. R. Turnar.

Of Christ's Ascension.
This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, Act. 1. 11.
shall so come even as ye have seen him go up into heaven.

As Christ did ascend visiblie into heaven, Ascension
so shall he come again in the same shape and form that he went up. Till that
time then, that we may see him with our own eyes come down, as the Apostles
saw him go up, let us never believe that he is here, Act. 3. 21
touching his manhood, for he is every where touching his Godhead, so in that
he is a very natural man, he is in heaven, and sits at the right hand of
the Father. Sir. I. Cheek.

The heavens (says S. Peter must contain and hold him, until the time that
all things be restored. Cyrillus says: Christus non poterat, etc. Christ could
not be conversant with his disciples in the flesh after he had ascended unto
the father. l. Fri.

How Christ is the end of the Law.
Christ is the end of y^ law, Romans 10. ^. End
to justify all that believe. That is Christ is y^ fulfilling of y^ Law, so y^
whosoever has him, and believes that he with shedding of his blood, has washed
away sins, and therewith over come death and hell, and obtained the favor of
his father: For all that thus believe is counted righteous, although he do not
indeed satisfy the law. Tindale.

The end of y^ law is to justify the^ which observe it. Therefore Christ having
fulfilled it for us, is made our justice, sanctification, etc. Geneua.

Christ has fulfilled the whole law, and therefore whosoever believes in him,
is counted just before God, as well as he had fulfilled the whole law
himself. The Bible note.

The end of the law is to justify them that keep the law: but seeing we do
not observe the law through the fault of our flesh, we attain not unto this
end: But Christ salueth this disease, for he fulfilled the law for us. Beza.

How Christ dwells in us.
When Christ is said to dwell in us by faith or y^ spirit, it does not therefore
follow y^ either his body or his soul dwells in our hearts really as I may call
it and substa^cially. It is enough y^ Christ be said to be in us by his divine
presence, and that he is by his spirit grace and gifts, present with us, etc.
Pet. Mar. upon the To. fo. 199.

We deny not, (says Cyrill Ciril. li. ^0 cap. 13
against the heretic) but we be spirituallie joined to Christ, by faith and
sincere charity: but that we should have no manner of conjunction in our flesh
with Christ, that we utterly deny, and think it utterly discrepant from
Gods holy Scriptures. For who doubts but Christ is so the Uine tree, and we
so the branches, as we get thence our life. Hear what S. Paul says, we be
all one body with Christ, for though we be many, we be one in him. All we
participate in one seed. Thinks this heretic, that we know not the
strength and virtue of the mystical benediction, which when it is made in us,
does it not make Christ by communication of his flesh to dwell corporally in
us? Why be the members of faithful men's bodies, called the members of Christ?
And, Shall I make the members of Christ, parts of the whores body? GOD forbid.
And our Savior also says: He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood,
dwells in me, and I in him. Although in these words Cyrill does say, that
Christ does dwell corporally in us, when we receive the mystical benediction,
yet he neither says that Christ dwells corporally in the Bread, nor that he
dwells in us corporally only at such times as we receive the Sacrament,
nor that he dwells in us, and not we in him: but he says as well, that we
dwell in him, as that he dwells in us. Which dwelling is neither corporal
nor local, but an heavenly, spiritual and supernatural dwelling whereby so
long as we dwell in him, and he in us, we have by him everlasting life. And
therefore Christ says in the same place, that Christ is the Uine and we are the
branches, because that by him we have life. For as the branches receive life
and nourishment of the body of the vine, so receive we by him, the natural
property of his body, which is life and immortality, and by these means, we
being his members do live and are nourished. And this meant Cyrill by this
word Corporally in us. Corporally
And the same meant also S. Hilarious by this word Naturally, Naturalie
when he said, Christ dwells naturally in us. And as Saint Paul when he
said, that in Christ dwelled the full divinity corporal, by the word
corporally he meant not that the Divinity is a body, and so by that body
dwells bodily in Chist. But by the word corporally he meant, that the
divinity is not in Christ, accidentally, lightly, slenderly: but
substanciallie and perfectly, with all his might and power: so that Christ was
not only a mortal man to suffer for us, but also he was an immortal GOD
able to redeem us, etc. Cranmer.

What Christ is in the holy Scripture.
In the holy Scripture Christ is nothing else, but a Savior, a Redeemer, a
iustifier and a perfect peacemaker between God and man.

The proves.
He shall save the people from their sins. Mat. 1. ^^


Christ is made our righteousness, 1. Co. 1. 30
our satisfaction, and our redemption.

For the wretchedness of my people have I stricken him. Esaias. 52. 5^


There is none other name given unto men, Act. 4. 12.
wherein they must be saved.

He it is that has obtained grace for our sins. 1. Ioh. 2. 2.


He sent his son to make agreement for our sins. ^. 10. ^ 10.
Here is the very nature of Christ, and his very properties full and whole.
And whosoever denies any thing thereof, or takes any part of them, and
apply them, or give the glory of them unto any other person then to Christ
only, the same man robs Christ of his honor and denies him.

How Christ entered, the doors being shut.
Look. Doors.

How Christ's natural body is in one place.
S. Augustine says, Augustis.
(as it is alleged by Gracian) Corpus Domini in quo resurrexit. The body of
our Lord wherein he rose again, must needs be in one place. Again he says:
Christus secundum presentiam corporalem, etc. Touching bodily presence, Christ
could not be in the Sun, in the Moon, and upon the Cross, and all at once.
Jewel. fo. 85. 86.

The heavens (says S. Peter must contain and hold him, Act. 3. 21.
until the time that all things be restored. Cyrillus in John. li. 11. cap. 3.
says: Christus non poterat, etc. Christ could not be conversant with his
Disciples in the flesh, after he had ascended unto the Father. I. Frith

Look. Body of Christ.

How Christ is called Messiah.
Look. Messiah.

How Christ is called our Altar.
Ireneus calls Christ our Altar: Altar^
And Origin calls our hearts our Altar, not that either Christ or our hearts
be Altars indeed, but by a Metaphore or a manner of speech.

How Christ is called sin.
Look. Sin.

How Christ is the Fathers word.
Look. Word.

How Christ is only the Image of God.
Look. Image.

How Christ in his Godhead, is every where.
Loo. Godhead.

How Christ is not carnally present Carnal presence.
with us, nor in the sacrament.
Christ by his Godhead (says S. Austen) is ever with us: but unless he had
departed away bodily from us, we should ever more carnally see his body.
These words are specially to be noted: If Christ were bodily here, he
should carnally be seen. Therefore S. Austens judgment, if Christ were bodily
present in the Sacrament, we should see him carnally in the sacrament.

A man may have Christ verily present, August. in John tract. 50
though he have him not in his mouth. For thus S. Austen says. Habes Christum
in presenti, etc. Thou have Christ in the time present, by his sign or token:
in the time present by faith, in the time present by the Sacrament of Baptime.

Christ is present in the Sacraments, as they teach that he is present in his
word, when he works mightelie by y^ fame, in the hearts of the hearers, by
which manner of speech it is not meant that Christ is corporally present in the
voice or sound of the speaker (which sound perishes, as soon as the words be
spoken) but this speech means, that he works with his word, using the voice
of the speaker, as his instrument to work by, as he uses also Sacraments,
whereby he works, and therefore is said to be present in them. Cranmer.

The same flesh that was given in Christ's last supper, was given also upon the
Cross, and is given daily in the ministration of the Sacrament. But although
it be one thing, yet it was diversely given, for upon the Cross, Christ was
carnally given to suffer and to die: at his last Supper, he was spirituallie
given, Spirituallie in the sacrament
in a promise of his death, and in the Sacrament he is daily given in the
remembrance of his death, and yet it is al but one Christ that was promised to
die, that died indeed, and whose death is remembered, that is to say, the very
same Christ, the eternal word that was made flesh, and the same flesh was also
given to be spirituallie eaten, and was eaten indeed before his supper, yea,
and before his incarnation also. Of which eating, and not of the sacramental
eating he spoke in the 6. of John: My flesh is very meat, and my blood is
very drink, he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood, dwells in me,
and I in him. Cranmer. fol. 21.

How Christ drank of it himself.
He also drank of it, Chrisosto^
least when they heard his words, they should say: why do we then drink
blood and eat flesh, and so should be troubled: for when he spoke these
things, they were offended with his words, and because that should not also
chance, he himself drank Drank
first of it, that he might cause them to come without fear to the partaking
of those mysteries. Here Chrysostom notes that Christ drank of it, to draw
them from the gross understanding of his words, and by his drinking to testify
unto them, that it was not his natural flesh indeed, but memorials and
representations of his body and blood. I. Frith.

How Christ bare himself in his own hands.
S. Augustine has a saying, that in the Sacrament, Christ was borne in his
own hands, and does expound himself in another place, Bare himself
saying: Ferebatur tanquam in manibus: that is, he was borne after a certain
manner in his own hands. And by that y^ he says after a certain manner, we
may soon perceive what he means. Howbeit if S. Austen had not expounded
himself, yet he says ad Bonifacium, that the Sacrament of a thing, has a
similitude or property of the thing which it signifies. And so he says y^ he
bare himself, because he bare the sacrament of his body and blood, which did
so earnest express himself, as nothing might more do it. I. Frith.

Of Christ's name and Offices.
First he is called by the name of Jesus, Name and Office of Christ.
which signifies Savior, to admonish us, that he was sent unto us from the
father to save us, and that we may have salvation by none other but by him
only. His Offices be these three: A Prophet, a King, a Sacrificator, for the
name of Christ signifies anointed, and because that in the ancient Church of
Israel, y^ Priests, Kings and Sacrificators were anointed by the ordinance of
God, in testimony of their vocation and office, they were called by that name.
And because they were true figures of y^ very anointed of the Lord, which is
the very son of God, which was anointed by the holy Ghost, which was given
to him without measure above all other men. And therefore Christ is named with
that name, as well because of the same unction, as because that all those.
Offices were enioined to him by the father. Pet. Viret.

Who they be that come before Christ.
All that come before me (says Christ) are thieves and robbers. John. 10. 8
He means all the false Prophets who led not men to Christ, Before.
but from him. Geneua.

To come before Christ is to despise Christ, and to seek other means beside
him to enter into the fold. They also come before Christ, which do attribute
and ascribe unto themselves, or to their own inventions, that thing which
only ought to be ascribed unto Christ. Sir. I. Cheek.

This place has been diversely expounded, being restrained of some to Judas of
Galilee, and to such like, but Christ generally compares all false doctrines
with the Gospel, and all false Prophets with godly Teachers, etc. For to come
before Christ in this place, is not to go before Christ in time, but to teach
other doctrine beside the doctrine of Christ. Moses was before Christ, the
Prophets also were before Christ, but they taught the church of the Lord by the
spirit of Christ, and preached Christ plainly, though he lay hid under
shadows and tipes. For Peter says, that the spirit of Christ was in them,
also he says that the holy men of God spoke, being inspired with the spirit
of Christ, wherefore they are with true Pastors, because they enter into the
church by the word of the Lord, and fed the people of God in the Pastures of
Christ, etc. All the teachers of humane Traditions, and the carnal
interpreters of the Law, are thieves and murderers, for with their pestilent
doctrine, they murder souls. For they which believe lies, do perish together
with the lies which they believe. Marl. fol. 364.

Look. Right hand.

Wherefore Christ is worshipped.
Look. Worship.

How we cannot have Christ here always.
But me ye shall not have here always. Ma. 26. 11
We cannot have Christ always with us, touching his manhood, for he is
ascended up into heaven with it, and sits on the right hand of the Father,
but as touching his Godhead, he is always with us, unto the worlds end. Sir.
I. Cheek.

Christ is not present with us bodily, or to be honored with any outward
pomp. Geneua.

How Christ is our Apparel, our House, our Root. etc.
Chrysostom says: Christ is become all things unto thee, thy Table, thy
Apparel, Apparel.
thy House, thy Head and thy root. How is Christ our Table? S. John says: Who
so eat me shall live through me. How is he our Apparel? S. Paul says: As
many of you as are baptized in Christ, ye have put on Christ. How is he our
House? S. John says: Who so eats my flesh, dwells in me, and I in him. How
is he our Root? S. John says: I am the Uine and ye are the branches.

How Christ was subject to the Law.
After the Law of Moses, Luke 2. 22. Subject.
etc. Christ was subject unto the Law, and in all things obeyed the Law, that
so he should deliver us from the tyranny and curse of the Law, and also
thereby to give us an example, that we (though we be made free by him from the
curse thereof,) ought to be obedient unto all ordinances and laws.

How to know Christ aright.
That I may know him. Phil. 3. 10 Know.
The most excellent and the most perfect knowledge of Christ, is to know that
Christ is both a true natural God, and a true natural man, who having pity
and compassion upon us came down and was incarnate, and at length nailed upon
the Cross, for the satisfaction of our sins. Sir. I. Cheek.

To know Christ aright, is to know and confess, that of him only and by
him comes our salvation: that by him our good deeds are acceptable unto
almighty God the Father: that by him the Fathers wrath is pacified: that by
him we be enfraunched from the captivity and thraldom of the Devil. And to
be short, that by him we are adopted and chosen to be the children of God, and
inherit^^s of the Kingdom of heaven. Erasmus in his Paraphrasis.

How Christ suffers in his members.
And fulfill that which is behind of the passions of Christ. Col. 1. 14.
Saint Paul does not mean, that there wants any thing in the passion of
Christ which may be supplied by men: for the passion of Christ (as touching
his own person) is that most perfect and only sufficient Sacrifice, whereby
we are made perfect, as many as are sanctified in his blood: But these words
ought to be understood of the elect and chosen, in whom Christ is and shall be
persecuted unto the worlds end. Act. 9. The passion of Christ then (as
touching his mystical body, which is the Church) shall not be perfect till
they have all suffered, whom God has appointed to suffer for his son. Sir.
I. Cheek.

As Christ has once suffered in himself, to redeem his Church, and to
sanctify it: so does he daily suffer in his members, as partaker of their
infirmities, and therefore a revenger of their injuries. Geneua.

Look. Passion. Affliction.

How Christ is the head of the Church militant, and not the Pope.
God (says Saint Paul) has raised up Christ from the dead, Ephe. 1. 20
and set him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all
principalities, and powers, and might, dominion, and every name that is named,
not in this world only, but also in that, that is to come. And has made all
things subject under his feet, and has appointed him over all things, to be
head to the Curch which is his body, Head
even the fullness of him, that fills all in all things. Bullinger fol. 865.

Which is the head, that is to say Christ, Ephe. 4. 15
in whom all the body is coupled and knit together, etc. Here we learn, that
as the spirit of life, does come down from the head into the whole body,
which is sundry wise compact, and made of many members, so is the
Congregation of the faithful quickened by the spirit of Christ, which is the
head of the Church. The Joint that ioineth this mystical body together, and
wherewith the grace of God is ministered to every member, is love, and unity.
For neither the hand, nor yet the foot being cut off, can be partaker of the
heavenly virtue that comes from the head. Sir. I. Cheek.

How Christ does call ^ brethren.
Narrabo nomentuum fratribus ^eis, ^fa. 22. 22
I will spread abroad thy name among my Brethren.

These be the words spoken in the person of Christ unto the Father of Heaven.
The blessed Apostle Saint Paul, in the second Chapter to the Hebrews does
allege this vearse of the Prophet, to this purpose and intent, to prove that
Christ took the same nature of man upon him that we have. This is a very
truth that I do now teach says Saint Paul. Brethren
Qui sanctificat and qui sanctificabitur ex vno omnes, that is, both he that
sanctifies, and they that are sanctified, are all of one: Christus
sanctificat, purgat, abluat and emundat nos, nos vero mortales sanctificamor
and illum per Christum. And this Christ which by the morites of his bitter
passion does sanctify us, and we which are sanctified be all of one: This
place proves Christ humanity
what is that to say, we come all of Adam, concerning the nature and virtue of
flesh and blood, Christ came of Adam as well as we: and that is the cause why
S. Luke describes the pedegr^e of Christ after the flesh, he begins at
Joseph, qui putabat illius pater, which Joseph says Saint Luke, was thought to
be Christ's Father. This Joseph was the son of Hely, Hely was the son of
Mathat, which was the sanne of Le^^: And so he descends in order until he
come to Adam: signifieng thereby, that Christ concerning y^ flesh, came of Adam
as well as we. And that is the thing which S. Paul says. Qui sanctificat, et
qui sa^ctificatur ex vno omnes: so they y^ sanctify, and they y^ be sanctified
by Christ come all of one, nempe Adamo, that is to wit of Adam. Propter quam
causam, Christus non confidetur vocare nos Fratics. For the which cause Christ
is not ashamed says S. Paul (notwithstanding we be sinners) to call us his
brethren, according as it is written: Narrabo nomen tuum fratribus meis, I will
set out and spread thy name among my brethren, not brethren only by
affection, as when Christ says: Matter mea and fratres mei hij sunt, qui verbum
Dei audiunt and faciunt, but my brethren because they be made of the same
kind of flesh and blood that I am: my brethren, because they come of Adam as
I do. Ric. Turnar.

We cannot have God to be our father, unless we acknowledge Christ to be our
brother, etc.

Saint Ambrose says: Ambi. li. de Isa. and anima.
He is our Mouth, by the which we speak to the Father: our Eye, by the which
we see the Father: our right hand, by which we offer us unto the Father.

The lieng of Christ in the Stall, Stall.
expounded.
Chrysostom says, As Christ was in the Stall, so is he now upon the Altar:
And as he was sometimes in the woman's arms, so is he now in the Priests hands.
Erue it is, that Christ was there, and Christ is here, but not in one or like
manner of being. For he was in the stall by bodily presence: upon the holy
Table, he is by way of a Sacrament. The woman in her arms, held him reallie:
the Priest in his hands holds him in a mystery. So says Saint Paul; Christ
dwells in our hearts, and no doubt the same Christ that lay in the Stall. It
is one and the same Christ, but the difference standdeth in the manner of his
being there: For in the stall he lay by presence of his body, in our hearts
he heth by presence of faith.

Chrysostom says that Christ heth upon the Altar as the Seraphins with their
tongues touch our lips with the coals of the Altar in heaven, which is an
Hiperboricall loquution, of which Chrysostom is full. Bradford in the book of
Martirs.

How Christ is called the Rock.
Look. Rock. Rock.


What it is to put on Christ according to the Gospel.
The putting on of Christ according to the Gospel, consists not in
Imitation, but in a new Birth, and a new Creation. That is to say, in putting
on of Christ's innoren^ie, his righteousness, his wisdom, his power, his
saying health, his life and his spirit. We are clothed with the leather coat
of Adam, which is a (...) garment, and a garment of Sin: that is to say, We
are all subject to Sin, Put on.
all sold under Sin. There is in us horible blindness, ignorance, contempt
and hatred of God: moreover evil concupiscense, uncleanness, covetousness,
etc. This garment, that is to say this corrupt and sinful nature, we received
from Adam: which Saint Paul is wont to call the old man. This old man must
we put off with all his works. Ephe. 4. 22. That of the Children of Adam, we
may be made the Children of GOD. This is not done by changing of a garment,
or by any laws or works. but by a new birth, and by the renewing of the
inward man, which is done in Baptime, as Paul says: All ye that are baptized,
have put on Christ. Also, according to his mercy has he saved us by the
washing of the new birth, and the renewing of the holy Ghost. Tit. 3 5.
Besides that, they which are baptized, are regenerate and renewed by the holy
Ghost to a heavenly righteousness, and to eternal life, there rises in them
also, a new light, and a new flame: there rise in them new and holy
affections, as the fear of God, true faith, assured hope, etc. There begins
also in them a new will. And this is to put on Christ according to the Gospel.
Luther upon the Gal. fol. 167.

How Christ first loved us, and not we him.
Who loved me, and gave himself for me. Paul says here, Gal. 2. 20.
that first he began and not we. He, even he (says Paul) loved me, Loved
and gave himself for me, as if he had said: he found in me no good will or
right understanding: but this good Lord had mercy upon me. He saw me to be
nothing else but wicked, going astraie, contemning God, and flieng from him more
and more: yea, rebelling against God, taken, led, and carried away captive of
the Devil. Thus of his mere mercy preventing my reason, my will, and my
understanding, he loved me, and so loved me, that he gave himself for me, to
the end that I might be free from the Law, Sin, the Devil and Death, etc.
Luther upon the Gal. fol. 82.

How Christ's corporal presence is hurtful.
I tell you truth, it is expedient for you that I go away. The corporal
presence of Christ is hurtful unto men, John. 16. 7
and that through their own fault. For why? they are too much addicted unto
it. Therefore his flesh must be taken away from us, that we may wax and
increase in the spirit: therefore they are far out of the way, that dream
in the mystical bread and wine, a bodily presence. Sir. I. Cheek.

The absence of Christ according to the flesh, is profitable to the Church,
that we may wholly depend upon the spiritual power. Camerarius.

How Christ is God, by these proves following.
First almighty God said, Genesis 1. 26.
let us make man in our own Image, and after our likeness. Which words (no
doubt) do signify unto us the Triplicitie of the persons in the Godhead,
which are three distinct in name and office, the Father, the Son, and holy
Ghost. And yet but one God.

The same thing also is more plainly opened unto us in the 18. 1 Proof.
of Genesis, where it is written that the Lord appeared unto Abraham as he sat
in the Tent door, for he lift up his eyes and saw three men, which ran to
meet them, and fell to the ground and said, God.
Lord I beseech thee if I have found favor in thy sight, go not I pray thee
from thy servant, etc.

Here he saw three to make us understand (as I said before) the plurality of
persons. And yet he honored but one, and therefore said, Lord I beseech thee
depart not from me. And to signify unto us the unity of the Godhead. And
therefore not without cause S. John says: There are three that bear witness
in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost, and these three are one,
wherefore it must needs be granted, that Christ is God.

Christ says also, 2. Proof.
Or Abraham was borne, I am. Which words (I am) declare unto us his Godhead,
for it is only the name of God, as he himself said when he sent Moses unto
the children of Israel in Egypt saying, thou shall say thus, unto them, I am,
has sent me unto you. Ergo Christ is God.

Christ said unto his disciples, 3. Proof.
Go your way and teach all Nations, baptising them in the name of the Father,
of the Son and of the holy Ghost. But yet it is not lawful to baptize in
the name of any creature, but only in the name of God, and we are commanded
to baptize in the name of Jesus Christ. Ergo Christ is God.

S. John says. 4. Proof.
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the
Word, which Word also became flesh, and dwelt among us, by which words it is
evident, that he is God, and that from the beginning.

None has power to make and create all things, 5. Proof.
but only God, but Christ has made and created all things as says Paul,
both in heaven and in earth, visible and invisible, and S. John says, the
world was made by him, and the world knew him not. Ergo Christ is God.

Whatsoever is without beginning is God: 6. Proof.
Christ is without beginning, Ergo Christ is God. But now to prove the Minor,
that Christ is without beginning, it is written that in the beginning God
created heaven and earth, and so made y^ world, and all that are therein, and
this was done in the beginning. But Christ was before the world was, as he
himself affirms, saying: Glorify me then Father, with thine own self,
with the glory which I had: with thee or ever the world was. Ergo Christ is
God.

Saint John says, 7. Proof.
We know that the Son of God is come, and has given us aminde to know him
which is true, and we are in him which is true, through his son Jesus Christ,
the same is very God, and eternal life. 1. John. 5. 20. A more evident place
of scripture cannot be, which affirms not that Christ was God by his Office,
as was Moses, but the true and very God, and also eternal life.

S. Paul also affirms that Christ came of the Israelites, 8. Proof.
which is God over all things, blessed for evermore. And Thomas said unto
Christ, My Lord and my God. In all which places he is called as he is indeed
God.

It is written, 9. Proof.
thou shall honor the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou serve. And yet
S. Paul says, that in the name of Jesus Christ shall every knee boow, both
of things in heaven and things in earth, and things under the earth. By which
sentence we see, that godly honor is due unto him also, wherefore it must
needs be granted that he is God.

Esaias also prophecieng of Christ says, 10. Proof.
that unto us a child is borne, and unto us a son is given, upon his
shoulders shall his Kingdom lie, and he is called with his own name,
wonderful, the giver of counsel, the mighty GOD, the everlasting Father, the
Prince of Peace. And Paul in like manner out of the Psalms of David says: He
makes his Angels spirits, and his ministers flames of fire. But unto the Son
he says: God, thy seat shall be for ever and ever. In which places we see he
is called God, yea, and that the mighty God.

M^ch^^ the Prophet says, 11. Proof.
and thou Bethleem Epheata art little among the thousands of Judah, out of thee
shall come unto (...) which shall ^ee the Governor of Israel, whose outgoing
has been from the beginning, and from everlasting. And again Paul says,
Jesus Christ yesterdaie and to day, and the same continues for ever, the
which sentence meruailouslie commends and sets forth the divinity of
Christ, forasmuch as he is without beginning, from everlasting, and shall
continue for evermore.

None is able, 12. Proof.
or has raised up Christ from death but God, as Peter affirms that God
raised him up and loosed the sorrows of death. But Christ has power to raise
up himself, for he says: Destroy this Temple (meaning the Temple of his
body) and I will rear it up in three days. And again, I have power to put
my life from me, and have power to take it again. Wherefore it must needs be
granted, that Christ is God.

Christ says, 13. Proof.
All that the Father has are mine. The Father has the Divine nature and
Godhead in him, Ergo Christ has the same, and so he is God. For says Paul,
in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and we are complete in
him, which is the head of all rule and power.

All things that the Father does, 14. Proof.
the same do I says Christ, for the Father gives eternal life, to as many
as believe in him, and so does Christ. Wherefore seeing that the Father and the
Son have all one action, needs must it follow then, that they be of one
nature, and so is one God with him, as he himself affirms, saying: The
Father and I are one, and teaches us also to believe, that the Father is in
him, and he in the Father.

Certain of the Arrians Objections that Christ is not God, answered.
Objection.
THe Father says Christ, 1. Object.
is greater then I. Christ ye see in this place has granted himself to be
infexiour unto the Father, wherefore it cannot be said, that he is all one God
equal with him.

Answer.
Forasmuch as there are two natures in Christ, the nature of God and man, as is
before sufficiently proved, I answer that by his divine nature, he is God
equal, and all one with the Father, as he himself said, I and the Father are
one. But as touching his human nature he was less then the father. And
therefore he said, the Father is greater then I. But how y^ this Scripture
ought thus to be understood, we shall see that Saint Paul will declare the
self same thing in effect in one sentence. ii. Natures in Christ.
Jesus Christ says he, when he was in the shape of God, thought it no robbery
to be equal with God, nevertheless he made himself of no reputation, taking
on him the shape of a servant, and was found in his apparel as a man, etc.
Here we see that forasmuch as he was in the shape of God, he was equal with
God, and inasmuch as he was in the shape of man, he was less then the father,
for he made himself of no reputation. Thus ye do see the sentence they bring
forth is very true, and yet makes nothing for that purpose they allege it.
But if they list to cavil about this word shape or likeness of God, therefore
he was not God, for it is one thing to be in the shape and likeness of GOD,
and another to be GOD. To that I answer, that as he says, he was in the
shape of GOD, so he says also that he took on him the shape of a servant, and
was found as a man. And if they will prove him hereby not to be God, so on
the other side I will prove him not to be man, because he took on him the
shape of a servant, and was found as a man, and the one is even as true as the
other, which if it should be granted, the whole work of our salvation should
be of none effect. Thus do you see of what force this argument of theirs is.

Objection.
Christ says all power is given unto me in heaven and earth. 2. Object.
And again, the Father loves the son, and has given al things into his
hand. Thus see we the Father gives, and the son receives, and greater is he
that gives, then he that receives, wherefore it cannot be, that he should be
equal, and all one God with the Father.

Answer.
This objection may be answered like as the other, ye Christ was equal with
his Father as touching his divinity, and less then the Father as concerning
his humanity. In the which humanity he received all things of his Father, but
as touching his divinity, he created and made all things, and gives the
self same gifts to men that the Father gives. For Saint John says: the world
was made by him, and as many as received him, to them gave he power to be the
sons of God. Thus see we the Scripture which they allege, serves nothing
for their purpose.

Objection.
S. Paul. 1. Cor. 15. 25. says: 3. Object.
Then comes the end, when Christ has delivered up the kingdom to God the
Father, when he has put down all rule, all authority and power. For he must
reign until he put all his enemies under his feet. For as much then as Christ
shall deliver up his kingdom to God the Father, and shall reign until he put
all his enemies under his feet, needs it must be granted that his kingdom
shall have an end, whereby it is evident that he is not God.

Answer.
The kingdom of Christ does consist in conquering our ancient enemy the
devil, under whom we were a long time in bondage, and in that he should die to
redeem the people, and so together in one, and so to ascend up on high, and to
lead away captivity captive, to sit on the right hand of God, to make
intercession for us, and last of all to sit in judgment on all flesh, whereof
part is already done, and the other part is a doing, and part to be done. For
first y^ redemption of man is already done and wrought by his death and
passion. Again, even unto this day, he fights in his members against Satan
the enemy of God, and reigns as a king in the hearts of them that be his,
beside this, he continually makes intercession for us. And the last day, he
shall as a righteous Judge, reward them that be his, with eternal life, but
the ungodly with death everlasting. All the which being done, this kingdom
of his shall cease. For he shall deliver it up unto his Father, and so have an
end. For it shall be no longer needful, forasmuch as the salvation of man, shall
there us altogether finished and made perfect. But does it now follow, that
although this kingdom of his shall have an end, that then he shall cease to
reign, and have no kingdom? By the self same reason may it be proned, that
God the Father was without a kingdom, all the while y^ this kingdom of Christ
has continued, for Christ says: All power is given me of my Father. Here ye
see that the Father gave all power and authority unto Christ, Ergo the Father
was without power and authority for the time that Christ had it. The which I
am well assured, that no man that is in his right mind will be content to
grant.

And beside all this, Luke 1. 3^
we have the plain testimony of Scripture, that the kingdom of Christ is
everlasting. For the Angel said, Of his Kingdom there shall be no end. Thus
if the Scripture be well weied, it makes nothing at all for their purpose.

What Christ has done for us.
Christ is the Savior of the world. John. 4. 42. Christ is the Savior. Luke.
2. 11. Christ died for us. Romans 5. 6. Christ died for our sins. Romans 4. 25.
Christ bought us with his blood. 1. Pe. 1. 17. Christ washed us with his blood.
Apo. 1. 5. Christ offered himself for us. Gal. 1. 4. Christ bare our sins
upon his back. Esaias. 53. 11. Christ came into the world to save sinners. 1.
Tim. 1. 15. Christ came into this world to take away our sins. 1. John. 3. 5.
Christ was the price that was given for us and our sins. 1. Timo. 2. 6. Christ
has paid our debt, for he died for us. Coll. 2. 14. Christ is our
sanctification. 1. Cor. 1. 30. Christ is our redemption. Ephe. 2. 14.
1. Cor. 1. 30. Christ is our peace. Coll. 2. verse. 14.

Christ has pacified the Father of heaven for us. Romans 5. 1. Christ is ours,
and all his. 1. Cor. 3. 22. Christ has delivered us from the law, from the
devil, and from hell. Coll. 2. 14 The Father of heaven has forgiven us our
sins for Christ's sake, or any other like the same, which declare unto us the
mercy of God. ^. John. 1. 7. In the book of Mar. fol. 1110

CHRISTIAN.
The definition of a Christian.
SEE that will express the name of a Christian, must be such a man as
excels through the knowledge of Christ and his doctrine, in modesty and
righteousness of mind, in constancy of life, in virtuous fortitude, and in
confessing of sincere piety toward the one and the only universal God.
Eusebius. fol. 8

The right Christen man consents to the law that it is righteous, and
justifies God in the law. For he affirms that God is righteous and just,
which is the author of the law. He believes the promises of God, and
justifies God, iudgeing him true, and believing that he will fulfill his
promises. With the law he condemns himself and all his deeds, and gives
all the praise to God. He believes the promises, and ascribes all truth unto
God, thus every where justifies he God, and praises God. Tindale. fol. 380

Where the name of Christian began.
The Disciples at Antioch were the first that were called Christians. Act. 11.
26
They that believed in Christ were before this called Disciples, and began
first to be named Christians at Antioch, which name we have of our Lord Jesus
Christ, in whom we believe, and being pertakers of his spirit, do rejoice in
our salvation purchased unto us by him. Therefore we must take heed, that we
do not by our unclean conversation pollute and defile this most excellent
name, and so give occasion unto the heathen, for to misreport and blaspheme it.
Sir. I. Cheek.

A Christian after the Popes religion.
After the Popes Catholic religion, a true Christen man is thus defined: First
to be baptized in the Latin tongue, (where the Godfathers profess they cannot
tell what.) Then confirmed by the Bishop: the mother of the child to be
purified. After he be grown in years, then to come to the Church, to keep
his fasting days, to fast the Lent, to come under Benedicite, that is, to be
confessed to the Priest, to do his penance. At Caster to take his rightes, to
hear Mass and divine service, to set up candles before Images, to creep to
the Cross, to take holy bread and holy water, to go on Procession, to carry
his Palms and Candles, and to take Ashes, to fast the Imberdaies and vigils,
to keep his holy days, and to pay his tiths and offering days, to go on
pilgrimage, to buie pardons, to worship his maker over the Priests head, to
receive the Pope for his supreme head, and to obeie his laws, to receive S.
Nicholas Clerks, to have his beads, and to give to the high Altar, to take
orders if he will be a Priest, to say his Mattins, to sing his Mass, to lift
up fair, to keep his vow, and not to marry: when he is sick to be anealed,
and take the rightes of holy Church, to be buried in the Churchyard, to be
rong for, to be song for, to be buried in a Friars coat, to find a soul
Priest, etc. Book of Mar. fol. 44.

How the Christian may warrant himself the forgiveness of his sins.
Saint Hilarie in his 5. Canon upon Matthew says: S. Hilarie
It is Gods will that we should hope without any doubting of his unknown will
for if the belief be doubtful, there can be no righteousness obtained by
believing. And thus we see that according to S. Hilarie, a man obteineth not
forgiveness of his sins at Gods hand, except he believe undoubtedly to
obtain it. And good right it is it should be so. For he that doubts is like a
wave of the sea, which is tossed and turmoiled with the wind. And therefore
let not such a one think to obtain any thing at Gods hand.

Let such foolish imaginations (says Saint Austen) murmr as much as it
lists, saying: S. Austen.
Who are they? How great is that glory? By what desert hopest thou to obtain
it? I answer assuredly: I know in whom I have believed, and I know that he
(of his great goodness) has made me his son, I know he is true of his
promise, and able to perform his word: for he can do what he will. And when I
think upon the Lords death, the multitude of my sins cannot dismaie me,
for in his death do I put all my trust. His death is my whole desert, it is my
refuge it is my salvation, my life and resurrection, and the mercy of the
Lord is my desert, I am not poor of desert, so long as the Lord of mercy
fails me not. And since the mercies of the Lord are many, many are also my
deseruinges. The more he is of power to save, the more am I sure to be saved.

The same Saint Austen talking with God in an other place says, that he had
dispaired by reason of his great sins, and infinite negligences, if the word
of God had not become flesh. And anon after he says these words. All my
hope, all the assurance of my trust, is setteled in his precious blood, which
was shed for us, and for our salvation. In him my poor heart takes breath,
and putting my whole trust in him, I long to come unto thee O Father, not
having mine own righteousness, but the righteousness of thy son Jesus
Christ. In these two places S. Austen shows plainly, that the Christian must
not be afraid, but assure himself of righteousness by grounding himself,
not upon his own works, but upon the precious blood of Jesus Christ, which
cleanses us from all our sins, and makes our peace with God.

S. Barnard in his first sermon upon the Annuntiation says most evidently, S.
Barnard
ye it is not enough to believe that a man can have forgiveness of his sins,
but by Gods mercy, nor any one good desire or ability to do so much as one
good work, except God give it him: no, nor that a man can deserve eternal
life by his works, but if God give him the gift to believe. But beside all
these things (says Saint Barnard) which ought rather to be counted a certain
enteraunce and foundation of our faith. It is needful that thou believe also,
that thy sins are forgiven thee, for the love of Jesus Christ, etc.

CHVRCH.
What a Church, or the Church is.
To the seven Churches Apoc. 1. 4.
A Church is properly a Company or Congregation of Christen folks, redeemed
by the blood of Christ, which suffer themselves to be ruled by Gods word, and
are always in this world mingled with the ungodly and unbelievers, and
therefore being known only unto God. They be preserved under the protection
of Christ their Shepherd, that they may not perish with this world. Therefore
wheresoever we see Gods word sincerely preached and heard, and the Sacraments
ministered according to Christ's institution, it is not to be doubted but there is
some church of God considering that his promise cannot deceive, which is:
Wheresoeeuer two or three be gathered together in my name, Mat. 18. 20
there am I in the midst of them. Marl. fol. 7.

If we take the Church in general, it signifies assembly or company. But
when we speak of the Church of God, we take it not only for the assembly
and company of all sorts of people, but for a company and assembly of men,
the which God has chosen from others, and has consecrated and sanctified them
unto himself in his son Jesus Christ by his holy spirit, for this cause she
is called holy, and the co^^^union of saints, and they be all the true
faithful, which by faith are made members of Jesus Christ, which is the holy
one of holiness, the which has given his holy spirit to his Church to
sanctify it. And therefore S. Paul does call all Christians saints. Viret.

The very true Church of God is not a fellowship gathered in a consent of
exterior thing and ceremonies, as other politic felowships be: but it is a
fellowship gathered together in ye unity of faith, having the holy Ghost
within them to sanctify their spirits, which does set their trust only in the
redemption promised the^ in Christ's blessed blood, and this church by Christ is
made without spot or wrinkle. D. Barnes. fol. 313.

The Church (says Lyra) does not stand by reason of spiritual power or
secular dignity, Lyra
for many Princes and many Popes and other inferior persons, have swarued from
the faith, wherefore the church does stand in those persons, in whom is ye true
knowledge and confession of faith and verity. Lyra in Math. Chap.

The holy church are we (says Augustine) but I do not say are we, Agustine.
as who should say, we that be here alonelie that hear me now, but as many
as be here faithful christen men in this church, ye is to say, in this
city, as many as be in this regigion, as many as be beyond the sea, as many
as be in all the whole world, for from the rising of the Sun unto the going
down of ye same, is the name of God praised. So is the church our mother.
August. sermo. 99. de tempore.

Saint Paul calls the church the spouse of Christ, Ephe. 1. ^.
for that she ought in all things to give ear to the voice of the Bridegroom.

Likewise he calls the church the pillar of the truth, 1. Tim. 3. 15.
for that that she ^aieth her self only by the word of God, without which
word, the church were it never so beautiful, should be n^ church.

The holy church is, all they that have been, and that now are, and always
to the end of the world shall be, a people the which shall endeavor them to
know and to keep the commandments of God, dreading over all things to offend
God, and loving and seeking most to please him, etc. Book of Mar. 632.

The church (says Lambart) I do take for to be all those that GOD has chosen
or predestinate to be inheritours of eternal bliss and salvation, Lambart
whether they be temporal or spiritual, king or subject, bishop or deaco^,
father or child, Grecian or Roman, etc. Book of Mar. fol. 1276.

Of whom the Church began.
When Adam and Eve his wife had taken comfort of Gods promises, which was, that
Christ should come of the woman's seed, to redeem the world from sin, death,
and hell, then they believing the same steadfastly in their hearts, were the
beginning of the true Church. Lanquet.

Why the Church is holy and Catholic.
On this consideration (says Saint Austen) the Church is holy and Catholic,
Holy.
not because it depends on Rome, or any other place, nor of any multitude
obedient to Rome (both which are donatistical) but Quia recte credit in Deum,
because it believes rightly in God. I. Bridges. fol. 543.

The Fathers began to call this true and right teaching, Catholic
the Church of Christ, the catholic Church which is as much to say, as
universal. Augustine to his cousin Seuerinus: This is (says he) the catholic
Church, whereupon it is also called Catholice in Greek, Universal
because it is spread throughout al ye world. Isichius upon Leuiticus. For the
universal Church (says he) is Jerusalem, the city of the living God, which
contains the Church of the first begotten, written in heaven. And Gelasius
unto Anastatius the Emperor: The same is called, says he, the Catholic
Church, which is by a pure, clean, and undefiled fellowship sequestered from
all the unfaithful, and their successors and companions, otherwise there
should not be a difference given of God, but a miserable, mingle mangle, etc.
Musculus. fol. 258.

Cipriane the Bishop and Martyr in his book De simplicitate Clericorum says:
The Church is one which is spread further and further abroad by fertile
increase: even as there are many heames of the Sun and but one light, and
many boughs of a tree, yet but one Oak grounded upon a steadfast root: And
where as many brooks issue out of one spring, though the number seem to be
increased by the abundaunce of store, yet it is but one at the head. Pluck a
beam of the Sun from the Gloabe, that one once separated is void of light:
Break a bough from the Tree it can bring forth no fruit. Cut a Brook from
the Spring, and being cut of, it dries up. Guen so the Church lightened
with Gods light, which is spread every where, neither is the unity of the
body separated, she extends hot branches with plenteous increase throughout
all the earth, she sends out her plentiful rivers all abroad. Yet is there
but one head and one spring, and one mother plentiful with fertile success^^,
etc. Bullinger. fol. 841.

How the Church is made clean by Christ.
If the fear of God have delivered you, John. 8. 36
then are ye truly delivered.

You are washed, 1. Co. 6. 11 Clean
you are sanctified, you are justified in the name of Jesus Christ, and in the
spirit of God.

Of Christ is the Church made fair first she was filthy in sins, August. de
verbis Dom. ser. 50
afterward by pardon and grace, was she made fair. D. Barnes. 253.

How the Church has spots and wrinkles in her.
The whole Church prays, Aug. de ver. Apost ser. 29
Lord forgive us our sins, wherefore she has spots and wrinkles, but by
knowing of them, her wrinkles are stretched out, and knowledging, her spots be
washed away. The Church continues in prayer, that she might be cleansed by
knowledging of her sins, and as long as we here live, so stands it. And
when every man departs out of this body, all such sins are forgiven him,
Spots and wrinkles,
which ought to be forgiven him. For they be forgiven by daily prayer, and he
goes hence cleansed. And the Church of God is laid up in the treasure of God
for gold, and by this means the Church of God is the treasure of our Lord
without spotte or wrinkle. Sequitur. Let us pray that God may forgive us, and
that we may forgive our debtors, seeing it is said, And it shall be forgiven
unto you. We say this daily, and dailye we do this, and this thing is done
daily in us. We are not here without sin, but we shall depart without
sin. D. B. fol. 254.

How it is said aright that the Church cannot err.
The Church is the pillor and foundation of the truth, 1. Tim. 3. 15.
how then can it err? We answer briefly (says Musculus) we do know
right well, that the Church is the only and well-beloved spouse of Christ, the
kingdom of heaven, ye it is ruled by the masterie and leading of the holy
spirit, and that we be always taught by his anoninting, and that it is the
pillar and foundation of the truth. But these saiengs do perteine not unto all
particular Churches, but unto that only upright and catholic church, which
is the communion of the Saints and elect throughout all the world, which does
believe in Christ their Lord and spouse, in all ages. And touching this there is
no variaunce, there is none of us that say, that the catholic church has
erred in the faith of Christ. For how can it err when it follows Christ, and
walks not in darkness, but has the light of life? Christ has not forsaken
it, nor never will forsake it, all our whole strife is upon the particular
churches, which be mingled with good and evil together. They not only can
err, but also have erred, and do err yet in many points, etc. Musculus.
fol. 267.

Saint Augustine in his preface upon the 47. Psalm alleges this place of
the Apostle in this wise. Augustine
Therefore we must understand by the second of the sabbath, none but ye church
of Christ, but the church of Christ in his Saints, the church of Christ in
them which be written in heaven, the church of Christ in them which do not
yield unto temptations of this world, for they be worthy to bear the name of
ye firmament. Therefore the church in them which be strong (of whom the Apostle
says, We which be strong bear with the infirmities of the weak) is called
the firmament: whereof it is song in the Psalm: Let us hear, let us know,
let us sound, let us glory, let us reign. For hear you and know, that the
same also is called the firmament by the writing of the Apostle: which is
(says he) the church of the living God, the pillar and firmament of truth.
Thus says Augustine.

Chrysostom does expound this place in this sort. Not as ye Jewish church: for
this is that which contains the faith (that is to say; the pillar and
establishment of the church) and ye preaching. For truth is the pillar and
establishment of the church, this says he. He makes not the church to be the
pillar and establishment of the truth, but ye truth of ye church, etc. Mus. fo.
268

To prove that the congregation of faithful men, The popes law 24. quest. a
recte in gloso.
is ye church that cannot err, hear their own law. The whole church cannot
err ^ Again. The congregation of faithful men must needs be, which also
cannot err. This church which is spread abroad throughout all the world, and
stands in the unity of faithful christen men, is the church that God
suffers not to err in those things that belong to salvation. D. B. fol. 254.

How the Church is known.
Whereas the word of God is purelie and sincerely preached, and the Sacraments
orderly ministered after the blessed ordinance of Christ. And whereas men do
patiently suffer for the verity. And the hearers do apply their living to
Christ doctrine, and with meekness receive the holy Sacraments, these be good
and present tokens to judge upon, that there be certain members of Christ's
church, and to prove this, read the doctors following.

Our mother holy church (faith Augustine) throughout all the world scattered
far and wide in her true head Christ taught, Augustine
has learned not to fear ye contumelies of the cross, nor yet of death, but
more and more is she strengthened, not in resisting, but in suffering.

They that be in Judea, Ma. ^ 4. 16 Chrysostom in opere imper^.
let them fly unto the mountains, that is to say, they ye be in
Christendom, let them give themselves to the scriptures, for in that time in
the which heresies have obtained into the church, there can be no true
probation of christendom nor no other refuge unto christen men, willing to
know the verity of faith, but by the Scriptures of God. Before by many ways
was it showed, which was the church of Christ, and which was the congregation
of the Gentiles. But now there is none other way to them ye will know, which
is the very true church of Christ, but only by Scriptures. By works first was
the church of Christ known, when the congregation of christen men, either of
all or of many were holy, the which holiness had not the wicked men.
Mountains.
But now christen men are as evil or worse then heretics or Gentiles: yea,
and greater continence is found among them, then among christen men. Wherefore
he ye will know which is the very church of Christ, how shall he know but by
ye scriptures only? And therefore our Lord considering that the great confusion
of things should come in the latter days, for that cause commanded he that
christen men willing to reserve the stablenesse of the true faith, should flee
unto none other thing, but unto ye scriptures. For if they have respect unto
other things, they shall be slau^dred and shall perish, not understanding which
is ye true church.

The same Doctor says ^ It can no way be known, what is the Church, but
only by the Scriptures. Again, Christ commands, Homi. 49.
that who so will have the assurance of true faith, seek to nothing else but
unto the Scriptures. Otherwise if they look to any thing else, they shall be
offended, and shall perish, not understanding which is the true Church, and by
means hereof, they shall fall into the abomination of desolation, which
stands in the holy places of the Church.

There be certain books of our Lord, Augustine
unto the authority whereof each part agrees: there let us seek for the
church: Thereby let us examine and try our matter. Again, he says in the
same Chapter: I will ye show me the holy church, not by decrees of men, but by
the word of God. August. de unit eccl. cap. 3.

The question or doubt is, Augustine
where the Church should be, what then shall we do? Whether shall we seek
the Church in our own words, or in the words of her head, which is our Lord
Jesus Christ? In my judgment we ought rather to seek the Church in his words,
for that he is the truth, and best knows his own body. August. de unit.
eccle. Chap. 2.

Whether of us be Scismatikes, Augustine
we or you, ask not me, I will not ask you: Let Christ be asked that he
may show us his own Church. Augustine cont. litter. Petilium. li. 2. chap.
85.

In times past (says Chirsostome) there were many ways to know the church
of Christ, Chrysostom.
that is to say, by good life, by miracles, by chastity, by doctrine, by
ministering the Sacraments But from that time heresies did take hold of the
church, it is only known by the Scriptures which is the true church. They
have all things in outward show, which the true church has in truth. They have
Temples like unto ours, etc. Wherefore only by the Scriptures do we know
which is the true church.

Verses.
Hoc est nescire, sine Christo plurima scire,
Si Christum been s^is, satis est, si caetera nescis.
Englished.
This is to be ignorant, to know many things without Christ: If thou know
Christ well, thou know enough, though thou know no more.

What is meant by the militant, and triumphant Church.
Men do divide the true Church of Christ into the militant Militant.
and the triumphant church So that the militant church should be of them which
do yet travail in this mortal flesh, and do strive with Satan, the flesh and
the world^ The triumphant, of them which are passed to heaven, Triumphant.
and have overcome all manner of their enemies. In this sort Augustine places
the Angels also. These be not two churches, but the parcels of one self same
church, of which the one is already gone to that dwelling of heaven, the other
does follow every day, until that at ye last, in the end of the world they
shall be both joined together, and live everlastingly in bliss, with Christ
our Savior. Musculus. fol. 255.

Who is the true head of the true church.
And he has made subject (says the Apostle) all things under his feet (he
speaks of Christ) and he has given him to be the head over all things, Ephe.
1. 22
to that church which is his body, the accomplishment of him which fulfilleth
all things in all men. Ephe. 4. 1.
Again, But let us (says he) follow the turth in love, and in all things grow
in him, which is the head, Head.
that is to say, Christ, in whom if the whole body be joined and compact
together in every joint of aid and relief, according to the working of
every part in his proportion, it makes up the increase of the body, Ephe. 5.
15
to the building up of it self by charity. Again, You wives be subject unto
your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the wives head, even as
Christ is also the head of the congregation, and the same which ministers
salvation to the body. And in an other place, All things were created by him
and for him, and he is before all things, and by him all things have their
being, and the first begotten of the dead, that he might have the pre-eminence.

How the church is vnspot'ed.
Albeit that Paul do call the spouse of Christ unspotted and not beraied with
any wrinkles or moules? Yet does it not follow that the faithful sin not,
as ye unskillful Anabaptists chatter. For then had John been a liar in writing,
If we say we have no sin we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us.
1. John. 1. 8. And where as the same John says, He that is of God sins not,
neither can sin. John. 3. 9. unspotted
And whereas Saint Paul tells us, that Christ's Church is unblameable: The
cause is this, that although the godly and the faithful be sinners, and do
daily offend, yet notwithstanding, their peace maker and bridegroom Jesus
Christ, lays not their sins to their charge by reason of their wedding
garment, that is to say, of their belief in him. Wherefore those that by this
and such other like places do gather with ye Pelageans to prove the perfectnes
of the church in this life, they may be disproued without any trouble, etc.
Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 293.

How the Church received not her first preaching of the Gospel from Rome.
Eusebius fol. 28. says, that Saint Mark the Evangelist first erected
congregations and taught the Gospel at Alexandria. Not from Rome.


Nicephorus says, that S. Mark went preaching over all Egypt, Libia, and
Sireni, and Pentapolis, and the whole country of Barbary, in the time of the
Emperor Tiberius, which was at the least six years before Peter came to
Rome. Therefore it cannot be true that the Church received from Rome, the first
preaching of the Gospel.

How the Church is hidden.
In Helias time the Church was not known unto men, but unto God only, for
else Helias would not have said, that he ws left alone. And this is plain
enough by that which the text has, namely that God says, Reliqui mihi, I
have reserved to me. 7000. Mark that he says, God has reserved to himself,
Hidden.
to his own knowledge, as I doubt not, but an hundred years ago, God had
his. 7000. in his proper places, though men knew not thereof. Bradford.

It is it (says S. Austen) that is sometime darkened and covered with multitude
of offenses, as with a Cloud: Sometime in calmness of time appears quiet
and free: Sometime is hidden and troubled with waves of tribulations and
temtations. He brings forth examples that oftentimes the strongest pillars,
either valiantly suffered banishment for the faith, or were hidden in the
world. Calvin in his insti. 4. li. Chap. 2. Sect. 3.

Objection.
Where was your church in such and such years?

Answer.
I answer out of my Creed thus, I believe that there has been, is, and shall
be an holy catholic Church. My senses cannot show it, and therefore I believe
it. It is not necessary that we shall from time to time, see the church. But
we ought to believe from time to time, that there is an holy church. Scripture
says: Thou art verily a hidden God. So the church is oftentimes hidden. The
husband of an hidden condition, and the spouse of an hidden condition. Christ
was in the midst of them, and they knew it not The church was in the midst
of them and they knew it not, etc.

How the Church is not above the word of God. Objection.
How can a man come to the knowledge of the word of God, but as they be taught
by the Church?

Answer
The Church by premonstration declares what is the word of God: Above.
Ergo is the Church above the word of God? This argument is not good. No more
then if you would say: John Baptist does show Christ's coming to ye people,
Ergo John Baptist is above Christ. Or as if I should show the king to one who
knew him not, and tell him this is he, by and by you should say, that I was
above the king. Hemmyng.

How the Church has no authority to reform the Scriptures.
The Scriptures of God has authority to reform ye church, but the church
has no authority to reform the Scripture. Christ reformed the errors of the
church in his time by the Scriptures, saying unto the Scribes and Pharesies,
Scrip^^m est, S. Paul reformed the Corinthians in his time, fo^^^ using the
holy communion by y^ scriptures, saying, I (...) you that thing that I
received of the Lord, Jewel against (...)

How the authority of the church moved Saint Austen to believe in Christ.
I would give no credence (says S. Austen) unto the gospel, if the authority
of the catholic church did not move me. Gerson the chancellor of Paris, a
right excellent famous man in his time, does in his second book, De vita
spirituali, like a discrete, profound, learned clarke say, that Saint Austen
in this place takes the Church for the primitive congregation of those
faithful christen men, Saint Austen moved to believe.
that heard and saw Christ, and were his record bearers. For when there crept
out diverse sundry Gospels in the church, while the Apostles and Disciples of
Christ were yet living, they that had seen Christ himself, and had heard his
Apostles, could testify which were right and true, and which were not.

Saint Austen before he was converted was an heathen man, and a Philosopher,
full of worldly wisdom, unto whom the preaching of Christ is foolishness,
says S. Paul. 1. Cor. 1. 18. And he disputed with blind reasons of worldly
wisdom against the christen. Nevertheless the earnest living of the
christians according to their doctrine, and the constant suffering of
persecution and adversity for their doctrine sake, moved him and stirred him
to believe, that it was no vain doctrine, but that it must needs be of God, in
ye it had such power with it. For it happens that they which will not hear
the word at beginning, are afterward moved by the holy conversation of them ye
believe, etc. Read. 1. Pet. 3. 1. 1. Cor. 16. Tin.

How the church is our Mother.
Christ is our Father, Mother.
as the Church his sponse is our Mother. As all men naturally have Adam for
their father, and Eve for their mother, so all spiritual men have Christ for
their Father, and the church for their mother. And as Eve was taken out of
Adams side, so was the church taken out of Christ's side, whereout flowed blood,
for the satisfaction and purging of our sins. August. li. 4. de sin. cap. 10.
in Epist. post Col. contra donat
D. Harpsfield in the book of Mar. fol. 1791.

He shall not have God to be his Father, which acknowledges not the church to
be his Mother. Moreover, without the church (says Saint Austen) be the life
never so well spent, it shall not inherit ye kingdom of heaven. This is not
meant of the Popish Church, but of the holy, catholic, or universal Church,
which is the communion of Saints, the house of God, the city of God, the
spouse of Christ, the pillar and stay of the truth: out of this Church there
is no salvation indeed. N. Ridley.

How the Church is visible.
The Church is none otherwise visible, then Christ was here on earth, that is
by no exterior pomp or showe^ Visible
that sets her forth commonly, and therefore to see her, we must put on
such eyes as good men put on to see Christ, when he walked here on earth: for
as Eua was of the same substance that Adam was of, so was the Church of the
same substance that Christ was of, flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone,
as Paul says, Ephe. 5. 30. Look therefore how Christ was visiblie known to be
Christ, when he was here on earth, that is by considering him after the word
of God so is the Church known. Bradford.

Marks whereby the Church is known.
The Church (says the Papists) has three marks, unity, antiquity and
consent. These three (says the Answer) may be as well in the evil as in
the good, Marke^
as well in sin as in virtue, as well in the Devils church as in Gods
Church. As for example, Idolatry among the Israelites had all these three.
Chrysostom tells plainly, that the Church is well known, tantummodo per
Scripturas, alonelie by the Scriptures. Bradford.

Master Calvin says: This honor is meet to be given to the word of God, and
to his Sacrraments, that wheresoever we see the word of God truly preached,
and God according to the same truly worshipped, and the Sacraments without
superstion administered, there we may without all controversy conclude the
Church of God to be. And a little after. So much we must esteem the word of
God and his Sacraments, that whersouer we may find them to be, there we
certainly know the Church of God to be, although in the common life of men,
many faults and errors be found. Whitegift. fol. 81.

Of the Church of Antichrist the Pope.
The tyranny of the Popes Church, shows them not to be Christ's Church. The
Church (says S. Hylarie) does threaten with vanishments and impr^onments,
Hilarie co^tra Aria, ^es
and the compels men to believe her which was exi^ed and cast into prison.
She hangs on the dignity of their fellowship, the which was consecrated by
ye threatenings of persecutors: she causes priests to flee, that was increased
by the chasing away of Priests. She glories that she is loved of the world,
the which could never be Christ's, except the world did hate her.

To prove that the spiritual a^ai^ and gorgeous apparel that is used in the
Popes Church, does not make the Church. S. Barnard says thus: They be the
Ministers of Christ, but they serve Antichrist. They go gorgeously araied of
our Lords goods, unto whom they give no honor. And of these comes the
decking of harlots that thou see daily, the game-plaiers disguisings, and
kings apparel. Of this comes gold in their bridles, in their saddles, and
in their spurs, so that their spurs be brighter the^ the Altars. Of this
comes their plenteous wine presses, and their full sellers, belking from this
unto that. Of this comes their Tonnes of sweet wines. Of this be their
bags so filled. For such things as these be, will they be rulers of the
Church, as Deacons, Archdeacons, Bishops, and Archbishops, etc. D. Barnes. fol.
2, 6.

Objection.
Has God (says the Papists) forsaken his Church a thousand years, and were
all our fathers deceived before Luther was borne, such antiquity, unity and
universality, was it al in error? etc.

Answer.
Was the world deceived so many hundred years? Why should it not? The Lord
ordained, that there should come an apostacy, and general fall from the says
of Christ: that the world might be seduced with the man of sin: whose age began
in the Apostles time, and shall not utterly die, till the day of Christ. Thus
the Lord appointed, and so let it be, for all things are for his glory.
Deering.

Of the universal Church.

CIRCVMCISION.
What circumcision does represent.
CIrcumcission represents the promises of God to Abraham on the one side, and
that Abraham and his seed should circumcise and cut of the lusts of their
flesh on the other side, to walk in the ways of the Lord. Tindale. fo. 6.

There be two Circumcisions, the one outward, made in the flesh by men's hands,
cutting away a round piece of the skin of the secret members. And this
Circumcision was not necessary to salvation, ii. Circumcisions
after the Gospel was openly preached after Christ's passion, but was
abrogated and left as indifferent and not necessary to salvation. The other
Circumcision was the inward Circumcision by y^ spirit of God, by y^ which y^
whole body is mortified and put away cleerelie by the spirit and by faith in
Christ. And this Circumcision is necessary to salvation. L. Ridley.

Circumcision is nothing of it self, it signifies y^ blessed seed, in which
al nations are blessed. And it signifies y^ circumcision of the heart, which
consists in y^ spirit, and not in y^ flesh. D. Heynes.

The Nazares did contend, no Nation to appertain to the Church of God, unless
they were circumcised. Paul and Barnabas said, that all as well Gentiles as
Jews, if they believe in Christ, should be saved without circumcision. D.
Heynes.

Circumcision was the holy action, whereby the flesh of the fore-skinne was
cut away for a sign of the covenant that God made with men. Or to describe
it more largely, Circumcision was a mark in the privy members of men,
betokening the eternal Covenant of God, and was ordained by God himself, to
testify his good will toward them that were circumcised, to warn them of
regeneration and cleanness, and to make difference betwixt the confederates of
God and other people or nations. Bullinger. fol. 355.

What was meant by Circumcision.
Lactantius. lib. Insti. 4. chap. 17. says thus: The meaning of Circumcision
was, that we should make bare our breasts, to wit, that we should live with a
simple and plain dealing heart, because that part of the body which is
circumcised, is partly like to a heart, and is therefore part of the priuitie.
And the cause why GOD commanded to make it bare, was, that by that sign he
might admonish us, not to have a covered heart, y^ is, that we should not cover
within the secrets of our conscience any (...) whereof we ought to be
ashamed. And this is the Circumcision of the heart, whereof the Prophets speak,
which God has than (...) (...) the mortal flesh, to the immortal soul. For
the Lord being whole set, fully minded, according to his eternal goodness,
to have a cure for our life and safegarde, did set repentance before our eyes
for us to follow, ^s a way to bring us thereunto. So that if we make bare our
hearts, that is, if by confession of our sins we satisfy the Lord, we should
obtain pardon: which is denied to the proud, and those that conceal their
faults, by God, who beholds not the face as man does, but searches the
secrets of the breast.

How Circumcision is the sign of the Covenant.
And he gave him the covenant of Circumcision. Act. 7. 8.
Circumcision is not the Testament, but a sacrament or holy sign of the
covenant. Sign.
That is to say of promise that God made to Abraham, saying: I will be thy
God, and the God of thy seed after thee. Sir. I. Cheek.

Why Christ was circumcised.
Why was Christ cirumcised, seeing he is exempted from the number of sinners?
Christ.
This does S. Paul expound to the Galathians. 4. 4. where he says: When the
fullness of time was come, God sent his son borne of a woman, made subject to
the Law, that he might redeem those that were under the Law. Wherefore as he
was borne for us, so was he circumcised for us. Neither was it his will to
abolish Circumcision before he had made his present Sacrifice upon the Altar
of the cross: by which doing he bare witness, that Circumcision was Sacrament
ordained of God. Hemmyng.

Why Circumcision was marked in the member of generation.
Out of Augustine in diverse places we gather, that therefore God would have it
so, Member.
to put us in mind, that Original sin is by generation t^aduced from the
parents into us: And that even as the foreskinne being cut off in the Parent,
does notwithstanding return again into the child which is begotten, so
Original sin being remi^^d unto the parents buddeth by again in the
children which are brought forth, etc. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 85.

How the Jews circumcise their children.
Whilst the Jew circumcise the Infant, Jews.
there stands one by, with a little vessel full of earth or of dust,
whereinto they thrust the fores kin being cut off, as though the Devil seemed
by that means to have his meat. For the Lord said unto the Serpent, even
straight way at the beginning: upon thy breast shall thou creep, and earth
shall thou eat. They seem to think that the Devil having thus gotten his
meat, departs from the child, and will not afterward trouble him any more.
Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 87.

How the Egyptians circumcise their children.
The Egyptians (says Ambrose) circumcised not in the eight day, Egyptians.
as God had commanded, but in the 14 year, for that Ismael at that time
received Circumcision, which manner also it is most likely the Arabians
followed, for at this day, the Turks also are circumcised at that age.
Although the Egyptians (as the same Ambrose affirms) were wont also to
circumcise their women kind, and that in the 14. year as they did their
males. And of this thing they gave this reason, that they would by this sign
signify, that lust is to be restrained, which in either kind at that age,
begins chiefelie to be kindeled. But God commanded, that only the male
kinds should be circumcised: and yet were not the women of the Hebrews, counted
either strangers from the Church, or from the Covenant: for they are always
numbered together with the men: they that were unmarried with their Fathers, and
the married with their husbands, etc. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 87.

Objection.
The people in the wilderness ceased from Circumcision notwithstanding it was
commanded. Joshua. 3. 5.


Answer.
They had Gods special dispensation so to do, for they were in continual
travail from place to place, and could abide no labor being newly
circumcised, but they made no law that circumcision should be quite abolished.
Lyra.

They looked daily to remove at the Lords commandment, which thing they
that were newly circumcised, could not do without great danger. Geneua.

CLOVDES.
How God did cover himself with clouds, when he spoke to the people.
SUch is the unspeakable power, and the high majesty of God, that like as
Princes do appear and show themselves in goodly. Tabernacles or houses and
palaices richly hanged and princely adourned, so the Clouds serve unto God
to compass him about, when he speaks unto men. As the Prophet says: Posuit
tenebras latibulum suum in circuitu eius, Psa. 12. 11
tabernaculum eius tenebrosa aqua in nubibus aeris. He has made darkness to
be unto him as it were a secret closet or privy chamber, his Tabernacle that
compasses him round about, is dark water and thick Clouds of the air. And
to make this as plain as can be made to our dull senses, read the 19. Exo. 19.
18
of Exodus, and there shall ye find it written, that when God gave the Law to
the people of Israel, he appeared to Moses upon the top of Mount of Sinai, in a
thick Cloud, compassed about with smoke and flames of fire, by the which
strange sight, God declared his presence, and also his power unto the hard
hearted people of the Jews. Likewise in the third book of Kings the 8. ^. Re.
8. 10
Chapter, we read that after the time king Solomon had builded the Temple,
almighty God to declare his presence to be ready to hear their prayers, and
to accept their Sacrifice made in that place, filled the Temple at noone day
with a dark Cloud, so that the Priests could not stand and minister because of
the Cloud. Also in the new Testament, ye shall read in the 17 of S. Matthew,
Man. 17. 3
y^ when Christ vouchsafed to give to the Apostles a taste of his heavenly
glory, before he should go to the suffering of his passion: to the end that
they should more strongly and constantly abide in those bitter storms of
temptation, when he should be spitted at, and reviled of the Jews: our Savior
did transfigure and change the state of his natural body, into the
cleerenesse and brightness and gloriousness of his heavenly body, that he
should have after his Resurrection, in such wise y^ his face did shine, as
bright as the Sun, and his garments that he did wear upon his body, were as
white as Snow, and with him was seen Moses and Helias talking with him, Et
ecce nubes lucida obumbrauit ^os, And behold a clear Cloud did shadow them and
close them in, and out of the Cloud was heard a voice saying: Hic est filius
meus dilectus, in quo mihi been complacui, ipsum audite. This is my beloved
Son, for whose sake I am pleased and pacified, toward all them that believe
in him, and will hearken unto his doctrine, ipsum audite, hear him.
Furthermore in the first chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, Act. 1. 9
we read that a Cloud compassed and closed in the body of our Savior Jesus,
ascending up into heaven, and so took him out of the sight of the Apostles.
Thus by these manifest places of Scriptures conferred together, ye see
evidently the words of the Prophet put in practice, Psa. 18. 11
when he says: The Lord has made the darkness his secret closet, and the
Clouds of the air his Tabernacle, to compass him round about. Ric. Turnar.

How the Clouds are called Gods pauilions and Chariots.
The Clouds and all the cope of heaven, are termed Gods Pauilions or Tents.
And diverse times it is said, that y^ Clouds are his Chariots namely because he
guides them and makes them to go forward, or else does as it were walk upon
them to make his triumphs. Thus you see how God is presented unto us as a
Prince, in that he uses the Heavens as his Palaice, and his majesty shows
it self there. Again, the Clouds are as ye would say, the pillars of his
pauilion, to the end we should be the more moved to consider the royal
workmanship. Then seeing it is so, let us learn to yield God that which is his
own, and let not his glory be lefaced through our unthankfulness. Call. upon.
Job. 672.

COCKATRICE EGGS.
The meaning of the place following.
THey breed Cockatrice Eggs, and weaue the Spiders web. To breed Cockatrice
Eggs, Esaias. 59. ^
is to go about that which is mischievous and wicked, and to weaue the spiders
web, is to go about vain and trifling things which are of no value, although
they seem never so excellent unto the doers. T. M.

Whatsoever comes from them is poison, and brings death. Geneua.

COLD.
What it is to be cold
I Would thou were either hot or cold. In some men's opinion, to be cold, is
as much as to be utterly void of faith: and to be hot is to persist
steadfastly and stoutly in faith, that is workfull by love: and to be luke
warm, is nothing else but to be a counterfetter and dissembler, that is to
say, to be hot and faithful to outward appearaunce, and inwardly to be void
of faith. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 67.

I know by thy works that thou art neither hot nor cold, etc. Thy works are
evidently open before me (says the Lord) and I know them in their kind: I
see thou art neither cold nor hot: thou art neither a full Infidel, nor a full
believer, neither a perfect Pagan, nor a perfect Christian, thou art neither
constant in thy faith, nor yet all without faith. Outwardly thou art hot, but
within thou art cold as y^e. Inwardly thou abhorrest ye word of God, yet do
thou not outwardly condemn it. I would thou were either cold or hot, either a
Christian or none at all, either a perfect lover of the verity or else, a full
hater of it, and not a dissembling Hypocrite as thou art, judging evil good,
and good evil, calling darkness light, and light darkness, making sower
sweet, and sweet sower, allowing fables and lies, and contemning the wisdom
of God. None is so far from the kingdom of heaven, as is a false Christian.
Much sooner is he converted to the truth that is all cold or all without
faith, then he that under the color and pretense of Gods laws, maintains
errors and lies. For So Much therefore as I find thee between both, and neither
of both, half cold half hot, and neither fully cold nor hot, neither
faithfully given to Gods word, nor all whole with out it, but a false and
glosing hyporrite, I will begin to vomit thee as a morsel out of season, and
spew thee out of my mouth, as a thing out of kind. Thou shall not be digested.
Neither shall my word allow thee, nor my promise admit thee to rest with
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But thou shall be thrown
forth into exterior darkness, whereas shall be weeping and gnas^^ng of teeth. I
will cast thee out, detest thee, and abhor thee. For much worse are they that
abuse or despise y^ gift of God, then they which never received it, etc. Bale
upon the Apoc.

COALS OF FIRE.
What the meaning of S. Paul is in this place.
FOr in so doing, thou shall heap hot coals of fire upon his head. R^. 12.
20.
This place may be understood two manner of ways: either that our gentle
kindness toward our enemy, shall be unto him a cause of great damnation, and
so by the coals we shall understand the vengeance of God, or that our enemy
being overcome by our gentleness, and as a man might say, being kindeled with
love, might repent, and become our friend. Sir. I. Cheek.

Either thou shall wound him with thy benefit, or else his conscience shall
bear him witness, that Gods burning wrath hangs over him. Geneua.

Thou shall as it were by force overcome him, Pr^. 25. 22
insomuch that his own conscience shall move him to acknowledge thy benefits,
and his heart shall be inflamed. Geneua.

After this sort does Solomon point out the wrath of God, that hangs over a
man. Beza.

COMFORTLES.
The meaning of this place of John.
I Will not leave you comfortless. Ioh. 14. 18.
Some understand this, of the return of Christ unto his Disciples after his
Resurrection. But other some a great deal better, refer the same unto the
coming of the holy Ghast. As if Christ should have said: ye shall think when
I am gone from you in my bodelie presence, that you are Orphants without a
Father: but if you consider the matter well, I will never leave you. For I will
come unto you with the spirit of consolation, which shall help you with
fatherly affection in all adversities. So beneficial shall my departure be
unto you, so great profit shall my death bring unto you. Marl.

COMMAVNDEMENTS OF GOD.
How they be impossible for man to fulfill.
IF thou will enter into life, Mat. 19. 1^
keep the Commandments. Remember that when God commands us to do any
thing, he does it not therefore because that we of our selves can do that he
commands, but that by the Law we might see and know our horrible damnacion
and captivity under sin, and therefore should repent and come to Christ and
receive mercy, and the spirit of God to loose us; strength us, and to make us
able to do Gods will which is the Law. Now when he says, if thou will enter
into life, keep the Commandments, is as much to say, as, he that keeps
the commandments, is entered into life. For except a man have first the
spirit of life in him by Christ's purchasing, it is impossible for him to keep
the commandments, or that his heart should be loose or at liberty to lust
after them, for of nature we are enemies unto the law of God. Tindale. fol. 76.

Objection.
If our free will (says fleshly reason) can do no goodness, what need, God
to command so many good things, what need God to give those Commandments
that he knows well to be impossible for us, and if they be impossible, what
right is in him that damneth: us for that thing that is impossible for us to
do?

Answer.
It is a great presumption to enquire a cause of our makers will, or to murmr
against his holy ordinance, which may not be changed. And if he do give us
commandments which be impossible for us (by our own natural strength) to
keep: he does it, that we thereby might know our weakness, and so to seek and
call to him for help. Augustine
As S. Austen declares well in these words, saying: If a man do perceive that
in the commandments is any thing impossible, or else too hard: let him not
remain in himself, but let him run unto God his helper, the which has
given his commandments to that intent, that our desire might be stirred up,
and that he might give help, etc. Here we see S. Austen says, that the
commandments be impossible for our strength, but we must call to God for
strength. D. Barnes.

Whereas S. Augustine has these saiengs: That God neither could command
things that were impossible, Augustine
because he is just, nor would condemn man for that he could not avoid: And
that God would never condemn the slothful servant, if he had commanded that
he could not atchieue: And also that God who is just and good, could never
command things that were impossible to be done: yet in his book of
refractions, whereas he better aduising himself, writ on this wise: All the
commandments (says he) are accounted to be done, when that is pardoned which
is not done.

A reason of the Pelagians, answered.
The Pelagians did reckon that they had got a great victory, Pelagians reason.
when they had made this carnal reason, that God would condemn nothing that
were impossible: of this reason did they glory and triumph, and thought they
must needs have some natural strength and power to fulfill the Commanndements
of God, seeing that God would command nothing impossible to man.

Answer.
The Pelagians (says S. Austen) think that they know a wonderful thing,
when they say, God will not command that thing, the which he knows is
impossible for man to do. Every man knows this. But therefore does he
command certain things that we cannot do, because we might know, what thing
we ought to ask of him. Faith is she that by prayer obtains that thing the
Law commands. Briefly, he that says, if thou will thou may keep my
Commandments, in the same book a little after says: He shall give me
keeping in my mouth. Plain it is that we may keep the Commandments if we
will. But because our will is prepared of God, of him it must be asked, that he
may so much will, as will suffice us to do them. Truth it is that we will
when we will, but he makes us to will, that thing which is good. Here S.
Austen says, that the Commandments of God, be impossible to our natural
strength, and therefore be th^^ given, that ^wee should^ know our weakness,
and ask strength to fulfill them, for faith by prayer obtains strength to
fulfill the impossible commandments of the law. Here have we also that God
moves us, and causes us to be good willers, and gives us a good will, or else
we would never will but ill. D. Ba^n^^.

You say, Gods Commandments are easy, Hier. con^ Pelagia.
and yet ye are able to show us no man that ever fulfilled them altogether:

Again. Set not thy face against Heaven, to mock^ fools ears with these
words, Be and can be. For who will grant you, that a man can do that thing,
that no man ever was able to do. Jewel. fol. 317.

A profane example.
Scelurus Scitha, when he gave his children every one a faggotte, commanding
them to break it, knew right well before, that they were not able to do it,
and yet in so doing, he did both fatherly and wisely, to the intent his
children might learn thereby, to see their own weakness, and not to trust to
their own private strength too much.

which are rich in this world, to be ready, to distribute unto ye necessity of
their brethren. 1. Tim. 6. which needed not at al, if all things had been

do not also receive the holy Communion. And unto the same agrees the decree
of Ana^^tus: When the consecra^ion is done (says he) let all such communicate,
as intend not (...) (...) excommunicate. H. Latimer.

Augustine Augustine
testifies of his own time: The Sacrament (with he) of this thing, of the
unity of the Lords body, is some where daily, some where by certain
distances of days prepared upon the Lords Table, and is there received at the
Table, to some unto life, to other some unto destruction. And in y^ first
Epistle to Ianna^i^s: some do daily communicate of ye body and blood of the
Lord, some receive it at certain days: in some places, there is no day let
pass, wherein it is not offered: in some other places only upon the Saturday
and the Sunday. And in some other places never but on the Sundaie. But
forasmuch as the common people was (as we have said) somewhat slack, the holy
men did call earnestly upon them with sharp rebukings, least they should seem
to wink at such slothfulness. Such an example is in Chrysostom upon the
Epistle to the Ephesians. It is not said unto him that dishonored the banquet,
Wherefore did thou sit down? But, Wherefore did thou come in? Whosoever is
not partaker of the mysteries, he is wicked and shameless, for that he
stands here present. I beseech you, if any be called to a banquet, washes
his hands, sits down, seems to prepare himself to eat, and then does
taste of nothing: shall he not shame both the banquet and the maker of the
banquet? So thou standing among them that with prayer do prepare themselves to
receive the holy meat, have even in this that thou have not gone away,
confessed that thou art one of the number of them, at the least thou do not
partake: had it not b^ne better that thou had not b^ne present. Thou will
say, I am unworthy, therefore neither wast thou worthy of the Communion of
prayer, which is a preparing to the receiving of the holy mystery. Call. in

How the Sacrament at the Communion ought to be received in both kinds.
WE have found (says Gelasius) that some receiving only the portion of the
holy body, Both kinds.
do abstain from the Cup, let them without doubt (because they seem to be
bound with I wot not what supersticion,) either receive the Sacraments whole:
for the dividing of this mystery is not committed without great sacrilege.

Reasons made of the Catholics to prove a Communion in one kind. Answered.
1. Reason.
Christ brake bread to his Disciples in Emaus, One kind
and vanished out of their sight, before he took the Cup and blessed it. Of
which place they gather y^ the communion was ministered in one kind.

Answer.
S. Augustine, Gregory, Iulianus, Dionisius, Lyra, Winford with others, say
it was not the Sacrament, but the breaking of bread, there was hospitality and
enterteining of strangers. Their words be these. First S. Augustine says,
because they were given to hospitality, they knew him in breaking of the
bread, whom they knew not in the expounding of the Scriptures. Gregory says,
they lay the table and set forth bread and meat, and God, who they knew not
in the expounding of the Scriptures, they knew in breaking of bread. Dionisius,
He took bread and blessed it, but he turned it not into his body, as he did
at his Supper, but only as the manner is, to say grace or to bless the
meat. Antonius Iulianus. He took bread, blessed it, brake it, and gave it to
them, as his manner was before his passion. Lyra says: They knew him, for
that he brake the bread so even, as if it had been cut with a knife. Winford.
It cannot be gathered (says he) neither by the text of S. Luke, nor by the
Gloss, nor by the ancient Doctors, that the bread that Christ brake after his
resurrection, was the consecrate or sacramental bread, and therefore I sai^,
that foolishlie and by consequence, that falselie he alleges S. Augustine to
his purpose. Thus by these authorities it is proved not to be the sacrament. In
ye text there is no mention made of consecration, neither yet y^ either Christ
himself or the Apostles did eat the bread.

2. Reason.
The breaking of bread, in the 27. of the Acts of the Apostles by S. Paul,
they affirm to be the Sacrament.

Answer.
If S. Paul gave the Sacrament being at that time in peril of shipwreck, he
gave it only to Infidels that knew not Christ. And Chrysostom enlarging S.
Paul's words, says thus: I pray you take some sustenaunce, it is behouefull
that ye so do, y^ is to say, take some meat, lest perhaps ye die for hunger.

3. Reason.
Egesippus witnesses of S. James, that he never drank wine, but at our Lords
Supper.

Answer.
S. Hierom says, that S. James continued Bishop in Jerusalem, the space of
30. years until the seventh year of Nero. If it then be true that Egesippus
writes of S. James that he never drank wine but at our Lords Supper, then it
must needs follow, y^ being bishop in Jerusalem ye space of 30. years, he
never said Mass, or else consecrated in one kind, which thing by Gelasius is
counted Sacrilege.

4. Reason.
Melciades Bishop of Rome ordained that sundry Hoasts should be consecrated
and sent abroad among the Churches and Parishes, that Christen folks should
not be frauded of the holy Sacrament, whereof they do gather a Communion in
one kind, because the wine could not be so conveniently carried.

Answer.
Whereas the maintainers of the Communion in one kind, make so great a matter
of the carieng of the wine, defrauding the people of one kind of Christ's
institution, mark this that follows. S. Hierom: writing of Exuperius Bishop
of Toulouse in France, says thus: There was no man richer then he that carried
the Lords body in a wicker basket, and his blood in a glass. Also Iust^us
Martyr declaring the order of his Church in his tune, says thus: Of the things
that be consecrate (that is the bread, water and wine) every man takes part,
the same things are delivered to the deacons to be carried unto them, that be
away. Here ye see it was a common usage in those days, to carry the
Sacrament in both kinds.

5. Reason.
The Council of Nice decreed, that in the Church where neither Bishops nor
Priests were present, the Deacons themselves, bring forth and eat the holy
Communion, which cannot be referred (say they) to the form of wine, for cause
of sowring and corruption if it be long kept.

Answer.
Rufinus writes in this sort: In the presence of the priests, let not the
Deacons divide or minister the Sacrament, but only serve the: Priests in their
office. But if there be no Priest present, then let it be lawful for the
Deacon to minister. Here is no mention made of these words: Let them bring it
forth themselves and eat. Which words in very deed, is neither found in
the Greek, nor in the decrees, nor in the former ediction of the Council, nor
yet alleged by Gracian. Therefore the meaning of the Counsel of Nice is, not
that the Deacons shall go to the Pix, and take the Sacrament reserved, and
eat it. But in the absence of the Priest, they might consecrate the holy
mysteries, and deliver the same unto the people, as may be gathered by the
words of Rufinus before rehearsed.

6. Reason.
Women received the Sacrament in a linen cloth. Tertulians wife received it at
home before meat. S. Cipriane says, a woman kept it at home in a chest. These
examples they allege, to prove that the people receive the Sacrament in one
kind and not in both.

Answer.
That women and other kept the Sacrament and carried it about them, and that in
both kinds, is manifestly proved by these. Authorities following. Gregory
Nazianzene writing of his Sister Gorgonia, says thus: If her hand had laid up
any token of the precious body and of the blood mingling it with her tears,
etc. Here he says, she had laid up both parts. Again, Amphilochius says,
that a certain Jew came and received among the faithful, and priuelie carried
part of either home with him, how or wherein it is not written. Truly, the
three examples above rehearsed, are nothing else but mere abuses of the
Sacrament, and therefore as it appears by Saint Cipriane, God showed himself
by miracle, to be offended with it, fraieng the woman that so had kept it, with
a flame of fire. And it was decreed in the Council holdon at Cesarea Augusta
in Spain, that if a man received the Sacrament, and eat not the same
presently in the Church, he should be accursed for ever.

7. Reason.
Basil (says Amphilochius) being once made Bishop, besought God, that he might
offen up the unbloody Sacrifice with his own words: be fell in a trance,
came again to himself, and so ministered every day. On a certain night,
Christ with his Apostles came down to him from heaven, Amphilochius.
brought bread with him, awoke Basil, and had him up and offer the Sacrifice.
Up he rose, was straight at the Altar, said his prayers as he had written them
in his paper, lifted up the bread, laid it down again, brake it in pieces,
received one, reserved another to be buried with him, hung up the third in a
golden Dove. And all this was done, Christ and his Apostles being still
present: who came purposelie from heaven, to help Basil to Mass.

Answer.
This story is a mere fable put forth under the name of Amphilochius, as
shall appear by the circumstaunce and weighing of the likelihood. Basile
besought God that he might make the sacrifice with his own words. And shall we
think he had more fancy to his own words then he had to the words of
Christ? He awoke, stood up, and sodeinlie was at the Altar at midnight. What
shall we think he was the Sextine there, or lay all night like Elie and
Samuel in the Church, and yet being so famous a Bishop, had no man to tend upon
him. He divided the bread, and laid up the third part of it in a golden Dove
that hang over the Altar, which Dove was not yet ready made: For it follows
immediately in the next lines: After Basile had done th^se things, and had
communed with Eubolius and other mo, the next day he sent for a golde-smith,
and made a Dove of pure gold. If this Dove were made before, how was it made
afterward, and if it were not made before, how could it hang over the Altar?
or how could Basile put his bread therein before it was made? and to what end
was the bread so kept in the Dove? and wherein or where was the other third
part kept, that Basile thus reserved purposelie to be buried with him, which
portion in the end of seven years, he received in his death bed. Now judge what
kind of bread y^ would have been, after seven years keeping, to be given to a
sick man. The true Amphilochius was a godly and worthy Bishop. But this
Amphilochius which wrote the story of Thomas Becketts life, 700. years before
he was borne, was a manifest and an impudent liar. Jewel.

Bucers opinion of the communion bread.
The third Chapter (says he) is of the substance, form, and breaking of
bread, which all do well enough agree with the institution of Christ, whom it
is manifest to have used unleavened bread, and easy to be broken. For he brake
it and gave it to his Disciples pieces of the bread broken. Touching ye form
and figure, whether it were round or square, there is nothing declared of the
Evangelist. And because this bread is commonly used for a sign, not for
corporal nourishment, I see not what can be reprehended in this description of
the bread which is in this book^, except some would peradventure have it
thicker, that it may the more fully represent the form of true bread. D. W.
fol. 594.

CONCOMITANCIA.
A new word devised of the Papists.
AFter that a new religion was devised, it was necessary for aid of the same
to devise new words: Whereas Christ says: This is my body, they say, this
is my body and my blood. Whereas Christ says, This is my blood, they say,
this is my blood and my body, and in either part they say is whole Christ,
God and man. If ye demand how they know it, they say, not by the word of
God, but by this new imagination of Concomitancia.

CONCORD.
A definition of concord.
COncord is a sure consent of minds and wills in any matter, so that
whatsoever God says, to will the same, whose parent and concernatrice
similitude, as far forth as the nature of things do bear and suffer,
brings all things to unity.

Who is the mother of concord.
Similitude by interpretation is called likeness, and it is named among
learned men to be the mother of concord, because that whereas men be of like
faith, there is peace and unity, and whereas they be not, there is strife and
debate.

A praise of concord.
Salust, called (as I may use Saint Austens words) Historicus veritatis, that
is to say, a writer of true stories, says: that by concord, small substance
does increase. And again, by discord, most great riches will waste away and
come to naught.

Publius a writer of merry verses, nevertheless full of wise sentences,
affirms weak help to be made strong, by sure consent. The Psalmograph or the
writer of Psalms, commending concord as a necessary thing, says: Behold how
good and joyful a thing it is, for brethren to dwell together in unity. And
in the last end of the Psalm it follows, there has the Lord promised his
blessing and life for evermore.

Can Giusta a Scithian, which made or builded the dominion of the Tartarians,
exhorting his xii. sons, (which dieng he left behind him) unto concord, as
unto the only sure stabilitie of the public weal, by the example of a sheafe
of Arrows, which being surely bound together, none of them was able to break
a sunder. But the shaftes being loosed one from an other, they did very
easille crack them in pieces.

Chria Serterius (by the like example before) did bring his host into a
concord, showing that the strongest men of war, could not draw out the
hairs of an horse tail all at once, but taking the weak hairs divided
asunder, they might soon pull them out one after an other, without any paino.
Bibliander.

CONCVBINE.
How a Concubine is taken in holy Scripture.
A Concubine and an whore (after the manner of our English speech) is all one.
For we in England do understand by a Concubine, a woman that is not married,
and yet secretly and unlawfully keeps company with any man, as though
she were his wife. But the Scripture does not so take this word Concubine. As
by these examples. Abraham was a good man and yet he had both a wife, and two
concubines: For Sara was his obedient and loving wife, and Agar and Ketura were
his concubines, as it is expreslie written in the 25. of Genesis on this wise.
Abraham beside Sara had an other wife called Ketura, by Agar he had only one
son, by Ketura he had six sons. Now when Abraham died, he gave his
inheritance and his chief possessions to Isaac: Filijs autem concubinarum
largitus est munera. But unto the sons of his concubines Abraham gave rewards
and legacies, and yet was Abraham no fornicatour, nor Agar neither Ketura were
no whoores. Also in the. 8. Chapter of Iudicum, ye read that Gedeon had 70.
sons. He had one named Abimelech, Natus de Concubina, whose name (as
Josephus says) was Droma.

This Abimelech when his Father was dead, he labored by the help of his
kindred by his mothers side to be made king. And to the end he might atteine
unto the crown, he slew. 69. of his own natural brethren. Now mark, Gedeon
was a just and a godly man, high in Gods favor, he therefore would not, and
again having so many wives of his own, he needed not to have kept Droma
which is called his concubine, as a privy whore. Therefore it must be taken
that Concubina is not taken In malem partem, for an harlot and an whore, but
every woman which is, Serua aut ancilla and a libero homine ducta in vxorem
concubina dicitur. For ye shall understand that in the old time, bond men and
bond women were counted so vile, that they were neither taken nor used as men
and women be, but bought and sold as a bullock or an horse is. And if it so
happened y^ a bond man and a bond woman did marry together, it was not counted
nor called matrimony, but Contubernium, a company keeping, as an horse and a
mare, and as a bull and a cow does, and yet such company keeping, if it were
between a man and a woman not prohibited by the law of God, it were before him
good and lawful matrimony, but by the civil law of men, it were no
matrimony, because that ye children begotten between such a Father and such a
mother, were not in their power nor at the commandment of their parents, but
at their Lords commandment. And if they and their parents did get any goods,
the children should not inherit but the Lord. And moreover if a free man did
marry a bond woman, this lawful wife should not be named a wife, but a
concubine, and her children should not inherit their Fathers lands, but only
receive such moveable goods, as their Father would give them by his Testament.
And after that sort did Abraham deal with the sons of Agar and Kethura,
which were no whoores, but his lawful wives. Nevertheless, because they were
bond women before he married them, therefore they were called his concubines. So
likewise Solomon had 700. wives, that is. 700. Queens, which were free women
borne, and. 300 concubines, which were also his lawful wives, but because they
were not free women borne, therefore they are called concubines. R. T.

The difference between a wife and a concubine.
Took to wife a concubine of Bethleem Judah. Iudic. 19. 1
This difference was between the wife and the concubine, that the wife was
taken with certain solemnities of marriage, and her children did inherit. The
concubine had no solemnities in marriage, neither did her children inherit,
but a portion of goods or moneie was given unto them, The Bible note.

And his concubine called Reumah^ Genesis 22. 24
Concubine is oftentimes taken in the good part, for those women which were
inferior to the wives. Geneua.

CONCVPISCENCE.
What concupiscence is.
COncupiscence is, that evil inclination and nature, which we have of the old
man, Genesis ^. 21.
which draws us to evil as GOD says in Genesis. The imagination of man's
heart is evil from his youth.

Concupiscence is a motion or affection of the mind, which of our corrupt
nature does lust against God and his law, and stirs us up to wickedness,
although the consent or deed it self does not presently follow upon our
conceit. For if the deed do follow the lust, then does the sin increase by
steps and degrees. Bullinger. fol. 325.

How concupiscence is sin.
Against concupiscence of the flesh, Saint Paul is forced to mourn and cry
out on this wise: I see an other law in my members, Romans 7. 23 24. ^
fighting against the law of my mind, and leading me prisoner unto the law
of sin. And again, O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this
body of death.

Saint Ambrose Ambrose.
says: Non inuenitur in vllo homine, etc. There is not found in any man such
concord between ye flesh and the spirit, but that the law of concupiscence
which is planted in the members, fighting against the law of the mind. And
for that cause the words of Saint John the Apostle are taken as spoken in the
person of all Saints: If we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and
the truth is not in us.

Saint Austen Augustine
says also: Concupiscencia carnis, etc. The concupiscence of the flesh,
against which the good spirit lusts, is both sin and the pain of sin,
and the cause of sin. Again he saith^ Quamdiu viuis, etc. As long as thou
live, there must needs be sin in thy members.

One of the Popes principal doctors writes thus: Augustinus tradet hanc ipsam
concupisentiam, etc. S. Augustine teaches us that this same concupiscence
planted in our body, Albertus Pighius
in them y^ be not regenerate by baptime, verily and in plain manner of
speech, is sin: and that the same concupiscence, is forgiven in baptime, but
is not utterly taken away.

Against Saint Paul and these holy Fathers. S. Ambrose and Augustine, the late
Counsel of Trident has decreed thus: Hanc concupiscentiam quam Apostolus,
etc. The concupisce^ce which the Apostle Saint Paul sometime calls sin,
this holy counsel declares that the catholic church never vnderderstood it
to be called sin, Counsel of Tride^t
for that it is so indeed, and in proper name of speech in them that be
baptized: but because it is of sin, and inclines us to sin. And if any
man think the contrary, accursed be he. So that by this degree S. Ambrose, S.
Austen, and other holy fathers, that have written the same, are all accursed.
Jewel. fol. 217. and. 218.

CONFESSION.
When confession first began.
LOthernus Leuita a Doctor of Paris, being once made Bishop of Rome, and named
Innocent the third, he called together at Rome a general counsel called
Lateranense, in which he made a law, which Gregory the ninth recites in his
decretall of penance and remission li. 5. chap. 12. almost in these very
words: Let every person of either sex after they are come to years of
discretion, faithfully confess alone, at least once in a year, their sins
unto their own proper Priest: and do their endeavor with their own strength
to do the penance that is enjoined them: receiving reverently at Easter at the
least, the Sacrament of the Eucharist, unless peradventure by y^ counsel of
their own Priest, for some reasonable cause, they think it good for a time, to
abstain from receiving it: otherwise in this life, let them be prohibited to
enter into the church, and when they are dead^ to be buried in christen burial.

Of confession to God. And against auricular confession.
Delictum meum cognitum^ by, and iniusticia^ meam non abscondi, Psalm. 32. 5.
etc. I have reknowledged my sins unto thee, and mine unrighteousness is not
his. S. Austen upon this place has a very pretty saying: Mark (says S.
Austen) Quando homo detegit, Deus tegitesi homo agnoscit, Deus igno scit.
Whenever man discloseth his sins, then God does close and shut it up: If
man do confess his sin. God does forgive his sins. Many men by this
place of the Prophets have gone about to stablish secret confession, which some
do call auricular confession, where the Prophet by his own expressed words do
declare that he speaks here of the confession that a sorrowful sinner
makes to God, saying: Delictum meum cognitum tibi feci. O Lord, to thee have I
declared my sin, and thou have forgiven it me. This confession as S. Hilarie
says, is nothing else but a continual calling to remembrance of our sins,
with a true repentant heart for the same. That man or woman does only confess
themselves unto God, which in his heart and in his spirit being pricked and
afflicted, does utterly detest and abhor his old filthy life, defieth and
d^nieth himself, hates his own doings, and does wholly consecrate himself
both body and soul unto God, does care for nothing but to fashion his life,
unto the will and pleasure of God, who so has not this mind, this spirit and
this purpose, when he confesses him unto God, he is but a mocker of God. Ric.
Turnar.

If we doeconsesse our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins, 1. Ioh. 1. 9^
etc. S. Austen does expound this: If thou tell not God what thou art, God does
condemn that which he shall find in thee: will thou not y^ he shall condemn
thee, condemn thou thy self? Will thou have him pardon thee, acknowledge thou
thy self, that thou may say unto God: Turn away thy face from my sins,
and say also the words unto him of the same Psalm, for I do acknowledge my
wickedness. Thus says Austen. M. 218.

What have I to do with men (says Augustine) to hear my confession, Aug. in
his 10. bo. of conf. and 3. cha.
as though they were able to heal my diseases. They be a curious kind of men,
that will seek to know an other bodies life, and be slow to amend their
own. Why do they seek to hear of me what I am, which will not hear of
another man what they be? And how do they know when they do hear me tell of
my self, whether I do say true or no: For no man does know what is done
within man, but the spirit of man, which is in man. Thus says Augustine.
Musculus. fo. 228.

I say not unto thee, Chrysostom.
that thou should bewraie thy self abroad openly, neither yet accuse thy
self before other, but I will they obeie the Prophet which says: Show unto

sins before God, confess thy sins before ye true Judge with prayer, for
the wrong that thou have done, not with thy tongue, but with the memory of thy
conscience. Chrisost. in his. 3. Homi. upon the. 12. to the Hebre.

It is not now necessary to confess, Chrysostom.
other being present, which might hear our confessions. Let the seeking out
of thy sins be in thy thought, let this judgment be without the presence of
any body: let only God see the making of thy confession. God which does not
vpbraide thee for thy sins, and cast them in thy teeth, but loses them in
thy confession. Chrisost. in his ser. of conf. and repen.

Beware thou tell any man thy sins, Chrysostom.
least he cast them in thy teeth and revile thee for them. Neither do thou
confess them unto thy fellow servant, that he might tell thy faults abroad,
but to him which is thy Lord and master, which also cares for thee, to him
that is kind and gentle, and thou show thy wounds unto him that is a
Physician. Chrisost. in his 4. ser. ad Lazarus.

I do not call thee before men for to discover thy sins, Chrysostom
unfold thine own conscience before God, show thy wounds and stripes unto
the Lord who is the Physician, and pray him to remedy it: he it is which
does not check, and which gentlye heals the poor sick persons. Chrysostom
in the fifth homili. of the incomprehensible nature of God against the Anomians.

The Church of Rome does command to confess all our ^nnes, not excepting any.

Answer.
David says: who can tell how often he offends: O cleanse thou me from my
secret faults. Psalm. 19. 11.

Peter powered forth tears, Mat. 26. 75.

Jesus Christ did heal him that had the leprosy, Mat. 8. 4.

Wherefore did he so? For none other cause, but that the Jews might not reprove

Cananite.

Blessed Rheuanus, Be. Rheua.

commanded. Bea. Rheua in argum. li. Ter. de penit.

Erasmus Erasmus.
says thus: Tempore Hieronimi, etc. It appears that in the time of Saint
Hierome (which was 400. years after Christ) secret confession of sins was not
yet ordained, which notwithstanding was afterward wholesomely and profitably
appointed by the church, so y^ it be well used, as well by y^ Priest, as by the
people. But herein certain divines, not considering advisedly what they say,
are much deceived: for whatsoever the ancient fathers write of general and
open confession, they wreast and draw the same, to this privy and secret
kind, which is far, of an other sort.

It is better said (says the Gloss) Gloss.
that confession was appointed by some tradition of the universal church, then
by any authority or commandment of the new or old Testament. De poenit.

Of three manner of confessions to men, allowed by Gods word.
There may be an open confession 1. confession.
made unto men, as that was which S. Paul made unto Timothy. I thank the
Lord Christ Jesus O brother Timothy for that he has made me strong, and has
now committed unto me the office of Apostleship, to be a preacher of the
Gospel: which heretofore have been a blasphemer of Christ a railer and a
persecuter of the Gospel, a very sturdie and bloody Tyrant, against all them
y^ believed in him. To this manner of confession may be reduced, such godly
talk and godly confession, as sick men have oftentimes, when they lie upon
their death bed. Cantantes Cygnea cantionem. Singing sweetly (as the proverb
says) like Swannes and Signets, which song, albeit all their life time it is
most mournful and unpleasant to be heard, yet against death almost contrary
to nature, their song is most sweet and pleasant. So oftentimes they which
have been great and grievous sinners, then they begin to singe the sweet
song of the Signet, then they cry and confess openly their sins, their
naughty doings, their malice against their innocent brother. They are not
ashamed of any thing, that may save their souls, and turn to the glory of
God.

The second confession is made but seldom, 2. confession.
the more^ is the pity, but ought to be made unto man, and that very often,
even so often as one christen man offends an other, but understand ye of the
offense given, and not taken. For of them that be offended without a cause,
they must be made at one again without amends. And as Christ said to the
Pharesies. Sinite illos, quia ceci sunt and duces cecorum. If the offender be
grieved with the preacher or with the magistrate, neither the preacher nor the
magistrate in that case is bound to reconcile or confess himself to his
brother, whom he has offended with true serving of God, and so in such like.
But in all other cases, where we hurt our brother by our deed or word, we must
harken and to obeie the voice of Christ: S^f^ater tuus aliqui aduersus te, etc.
In all such cases we must follow the counsel of S. James: Confitemini alter
alterum peccata vestra, and orate pro inuicem vt saluemini. Confess and
reconcile your selves one to another, and do pray one for an other, that ye
may be saved: Both these kinds of confession made unto man, whether it be the
open confession or secret confession betwixt neighbor, and neighbor, be
very godly, wholesome and pro^able.

The third condition^ 3. confession.
which commonly is called Auricular confession, after the opinion of that
great learned Lawier. Gracianus (by whose study the book of the Canon law
called the Decrees was made^ a man that lived about a 400^ years a go) was
devised and ordained by godly Bishops, to make the people the more afraid
and ashamed of their sins. The devise was good and godly. Nevertheless this
constitution and ordinance, was never begun nor received in the universal
Church, but only in this our Occidentall Church. The Greeks and Oriental
Church, were ever free from this secret confession: wherefore we must needs
grant that this confession was without Gods own making from the beginning,
but only devised by good Fathers and godly Bishops, for to bring the lay
and unlearned people, to the more fear of GOD, and knowledge of their duty
unto him, and to their neighbor: And for the better performaunce of this their
purpose, they ordained that he that should hear any man's confession,
should have these four properties. Four properties of a co^fessor
First, to be a man of honest and godly conversation: Second, a secret
keeper, no babbler nor talker. Thirdly, a wise discrete man: and fourthlye, a
man learned in Gods laws. This was wonderfully godly begun, and prospered
well, and did much good. Till it cha^mced at the City of Constantinople, in
the days of a Bishop called Nectarius, the next Bishop there, before Saint
John^ Chrysostom, that a certain noble woman of blood, and fair of skin
and bone, which had been there in the Church of Constantinople, commanded by
the Priest that had heard her confession, to resort daily to the Church for a
certain space, there to watch in fasting and prayer. This Priest intended well
he thought that such an entera^ce and beginning of a new life should have done
that lady good, which by subtlety of the devil and wickedness of man, turned
clean contrary, as thus: A certain Deacon Deacon.
of that church fell in familiarity with that woman, more then godliness and
honesty required. To be short he lay with her, and did stuprate her. The
matter was tried and confessed, where upon a great outcrie and wond^^ment was
made against the Deacons and Priests of Constantinople^ insomuch Nectarius the
Bishop deposed the Deacon from ministry, and for a quieting of the people, and
stopping of their months, commanded confession to be free, and at every man's
liberty, whether he would be confessed or no. Thus for a while confession was
left, till within process of few years, carnal liberty and licentious
living had so much over whelmed the world, that the Fathers of the Occidentall
Church, for the great love they did bear unto the people, thought themselves
bound to restore confession again, but without any scrupulus burden of
impossible enumeration of sins, without the opinion of dampnation, to hang
over their heads which had not been confessed, but took and used it as a mean
to give good counsel unto the ignorant people. Thus it continued many years
in the Occidentall Church, whereby the people were brought to great amendment
of life, by the true searching of their consciences, and again, to great
knowledge of God, through the godly counsel that was then given them by the
learned Fathers, and godly Counselors: many men that were robbed and wronged
(by that means) had their goods and good name restored to them again. All
this was done so long as the old Canon was observed, that is, no man to hear
confession, except he had ye four properties aforesaid, so long this
discipline was had in great estimation, and did much good. But after that
wicked Rome with dispensations, had in the steed of learning nourished
ignorance, for diligence, sloth and idleness, for wisdom and wise
counsailers, lowtish lobbes and ignorant dawes: In steed of good counsel
and amendment of life, had clogged the consciences of men with enumeration of
sins, with many more like inconveniences, almighty God the lover of truth, the
spouse of his Church, has stirred up in every Realm learned men to inueigh
against these abuses. So that now we are left free again, every man to
confess or not to confess, as shall seem to him good and most for his own
comfort. Thus ye see what beginning this secret or auricular confession had,
what increase, and at the last what decrease again. Ric. Turn^r.

Sozomenus reports that this constitution of Bishops was diligently kept in
the west Churches, Trip. hist. li. 9.
but specially at Rome: Whereby he shows that it was no universal
ordinance of all Churches. But he says, that there was one of the Priests
peculiarly appointed to serve for this office. Whereby he does sufficiently
confute that which these men do falsely say, of the keys given for this use
universally to ye whole order of Priesthood. For it was not the common office
of all Priests, but the special duty of some one that was chosen thereunto by
the Bishop. The same is he whom at this day in all Cathedral churches they
call Penitentiari, the examiner of heinous offenses, and such whereof the
punishment pertains to good example. Then he says immediately after, y^
this was also the manner at Constantinople, till a certain woman, faining y^
she came to confession, was found so to have colored under that pretense,
the dishonest company that she used with a certain Deacon. For this act,
Nectarius a man notable in holiness, and learning, Bishop of that Church,
took away that custom of confessing. Here let these asses lift up their
ears. If auricular confession were the law of God, how durst Nectarius repel
and destroy it? Will they accuse for an heretic and scismatike Nectarius a
holy man of God, allowed by the consenting voice of all the old Fathers? But
by the same sentence they must condemn the Church of Constantinople, in which
Sozomenus affirms that the manner of confessing was not only let slip
for a time, but also discontinued even til within time of his remembrance.
Yea, let them condemn of apostacy, not only the Church of Constantinople,
but also all the East Churches, which have neglected that law, which (if they
say true) is inviolable and commanded to all Christians. Call. 3. b. chap. 4.
Sect. 7.

A Monks opinion of confession.
In the days of king Henry the fourth, there was a Monk Monk.
of Feuersam, which men called Moredome, that preached at Canterbury at the
cross within Christ's church Abbeie, and said thus of confession: That as
through the suggestion of the fiend, without counsel of any other body, of
themselves many men and women, can imagine and find means and ways enough to
come to pride, to theft, to lechery, and to other diverse vices: In
contrariwise this Monk said: Since the Lord God is more ready to forgive
sins, then the fiend is, or may be of power to move any body to sin:
then whosoever will shame and sorrow heartelie for their sins, knowledgeing
them faithfully to GOD, amending them after their power and cunning without
counsel of any other body, then of God and himself (through the grace of
GOD) all such men and women may find sufficient means to come to Gods
mercy, and so to be clean assoiled of all their sins. Book of Mar. fol.
645.

CONFIRMATION.
What confirmation was.
COnfirmation was that Ceremony, which the Apostles did use, when they laid
their hands upon those which received the holy Ghost after they were baptized
of them, and was likewise ordained by the ancient Fathers. For the Bishops
do use upon those children which were baptized in their infancy, and were
afterward instructed a new in Christ's religion, when they came to be young
men, that they might in their own person, and with their own tongue allow
and confess their faith publicly. F. N. B. the Italian.

This was the matter (says he) in times past, that the children of christians
should be set before the Bishop, after they were come to years of
discreation, that they might perform that which was required of them, that
being of age did offer themselves to Baptime. For these sat among the
Cathecumeni, until (being rightlye instructed in the mysteries of faith) they
were able to utter a confession of their faith before the Bishop and the
people. The infants therefore that were baptized, because then they made no
confession of faith in the Church: at the end of their childehoode, or in the
beginning of their youth, they were again presented of their parents, and were
examined of the Bishop according to a certain and common form of a
Catechism. And to the intent that this action (which otherwise ought of right
to be grave and holy) might have the greater reverence and estimation, there
was added also a ceremony of laieng of hands, so the child was dismissed,
his faith being approved with a solemn blessing. The ancient Fathers make
often mention of this order. Pope Leo. If any man return from heretics, let
him not again be baptized, but let the virtue of the spirit (which was
wanting) be given unto him by the laieng on of the Bishops hands. Here our
adversaries will cry, that it is rightly called a Sacrament, where the holy
Ghost is given. But Leo himself, does in an other place expound what he means
by these words: He that is baptized (says he) of heretics, let him not be
rebaptised, but let him be confirmed with ye invocation of the holy Ghost, by
the imposition of hands, because he received only the form of baptime without
sanctification. Although I do not deny that Hierome is somewhat herein
deceived, that he says that it is an Apostolical observation, yet he is most
far from these men's follies. And he mitigateth it, when he says that this
blessing was granted only to the Bishop, rather for the honor of
Priesthood, then by the necessity of the law. Wherefore such an imposition of
hands which is simply in stead of a blessing, I commend, and would wish it
were at these days restored to the pure use. Call. in his insti.

In the fifth Sect of his fourth book, Calvin writes thus: But the latter age
has counterfeit confirmation, in stead of a Sacrament of God, the thing it
self being almost quite blotted out. They feine this to be the virtue of
confirmation Abuse of confirmation.
to give the holy Ghost, unto the increase of grace, which was given in
Baptime, to innocence of life, to confirm them unto battle, which in Baptime
were regenerate unto life. This confirmation is wrought with anointing and
this form of words, sign thee with the sign of the holy Ghost, and I
confirm thee with the ointment of salvation, in the name of the Father, and of
the son, and of the holy Ghost, etc. And in confuting this manner of
confirmation and imposition of hands, he proceeds on in this fifth Sextio,
and in the sixth. D. W. fol. 777.

CONIVRING.
Of coniuring the Devil out of infants in Baptime.
The Apostles used not the coniurings in Baptime, whereby they do conjure the
devil to go out from the infants that should be baptized. This they do also
altogether without any example of Christ or ye Apostles, not only as
concerning the ceremony of Baptime, but also of other. For which of them ever
coniured Satan to depart out of him y^ was subject unto sins, and possessed
of him, not in body, but in mind? The Apostles delivered such as were
possessed with Devils, commanding the spirits to go out in the name of Jesus
Christ, but we read not, that they did any such thing with sinners. And I
think that our adversaries be not so mad, to say ye infants be corporally
possessed of Satan, for Christ should have driven out the evil spirits out of
them which were brought unto him, which thing for all that he did not. But if
they say that this is done because of original sin, in respect whereof
infants be in bondage of the kingdom of Satan, then I pray you, why did not
Christ so unto the publicans and sinners, and the Apostles unto all them which
they baptized, being also conceived and borne in sin: I know (says
Musculus) that this coniuring was in the Church in the time of Ciprian and
Augustine, but I seek not what the fathers did, but what Christ did institute,
and what the Apostls did. Musculus. fol. 291.

CONSCIENCE.
What conscience is.
THe conscience verily is the knowledge, judgment, and reason of a man,
whereby every man in himself, and in his own mind, being made privy to
every thing, yt he either has committed or not committed, do either condemn
or acquit himself. And this reason proceeds from God, who is both prompt,
and writes his judgments in the hearts and minds of men. Bullinger.

What Saint Paul's meaning is by this.
Having the conscience seared with an hot iron. 1 Timothy 4. 1.
Their dull consciences first waxed hard: then after, canker, and corruption
bred therein: Last of all it was burnt with an hot iron, so that he means
such as have no conscience. Geneua.

Whose conscience waxed so hard, that there grew an hard fleshlinesse over it,
and so became to have a Canker in it, and now at length, required of very
necessity to be burned with an hot iron.

Tindale applies this place to false Teachers, whose consciences being seared
be witnesses unto themselves, that for their belly sake, and desire of filthy
lucre, they hide the truth and stablish lies. Tindale.

CONSECRATION.
What Consecration is.
Giving of thanks unto God for y^ death of his only begotten Son Jesus Christ,
Ma. 26. ^6
is the true Consecration. Sir. I. Cheek.

Consecration signifies the whole action of the Supper, and not the turning of
the Elements. Book of Mar. fol. 1538.

Doctor Redman being sick at Westminster, was among other things asked this
question, by one Master Wilkes, what Consecratio was: it is (quoth Doctor
Redman) tota actio in ministering the Sacrament, as Christ did institute it: All
the whole thing done in the mystery as Christ ordained it, that is Consecatio.
Thus far D. Redman.

CONTEMPT.
How Contempt is defined.
COntempt consists chiefelie in three things: for either we contemn only
in mind when we despise any man, and their goods, or when we do them any
discommoditie, not thereby to seek our own gain, but only to rejoice at
their discommoditie: or lastly when we add words or deeds, which have
ignominy or contumely joined with them. Pet. Mar. upon. Iudic. fol. 166.

CONTENTION.
Of the Contention between Paul and Barnabas.
Look. Paul.

CONTINENCY.
What Continency is.
Continency is a virtue or power of the mind, received from the spirit of God,
which suppresseth affections, and does not in any wise permit unlawful
pleasures. This is conversant and does show it self in the common and usual
talk of men, in pleasures that are allowed, in apparel, in buildings, and
dwelling houses, in meat and drink, and in other things also, etc. Bullinger.
fol. 237.

CORNELIUS.
How Cornelius was justified by faith, and not by works.
Cornelius, Act. 10. 4.
thy prayers and thine alms, are come up into remembrance before God, etc.
The prayers and alms of Cornelius pleased God before he was baptized, but
without faith God cannot be pleased. Cornelius therefore (as Bede truly
notes) had faith, whereby his prayers and alms pleased God, for (says he) he
came not to faith through works, but to works through faith. The Bible note.

Inasmuch as by works no man can be saved, Psa. 143. 2 and 130. 3.
as the psalmist openly affirms: In thy sight none that lives can be
justified. And again: If thou look on our iniquities. Lord who shall be able
to bear them. No christen conscience dare be so hardy, as to attribute
salvation of this man Cornelius, to his prayer and fasting, for first ye see he
was a Gentile uncircumcised, not keeping the law, nor once thinking thereon,
and therefore must be justified by faith that came by hearing the glad tidings
preached in Christ, and therefore must we look to the words of Luke, in the
beginning of this Chapter, where he says that he feared God, which thing he
could not have done, neither yet have prayed nor given alms, except he had
believed. For how should he have called on him, on whom he believed not. Thus
are we compelled to ascribe his calling unto faith, out of which these fruits
of prayer and fasting proceeded, specially seeing that Saint Paul affirms
that whatsoever is not done of faith, the same is sin. The christen then, and
such as will the Scriptures to be true in all places, and to expound one text
that another may agree with it, do right well know that his calling and our
salvation is freely given of God for his son Christ's sake, and not for the
deserving of our works. And because faith can receive this great and free
benefit of God, and believe it to be true, and works neither can believe it,
neither discern it, therefore it is ascribed unto faith and not to works. If
prayer or fasting or the holiest work under heaven could save, Christ had
never needed to have suffered such grievous pains, but utterly died in vain.
Neither should God freely choose us, but our works should choose him.
Understande therefore, that by his works was he not called, but by Faith, out
of which his works sprung, which faith, God freely gave him, as he calls
and saves us all. Good works must we do as this man did, and that with all
love and earnestness, and thereto are we bound, and without them can it not be
known, whether we be very christen or no, no more then we can know a good
Tree to be good, and never felt his fruit. But we may in no condition
ascribe justification or salvation to them, for as says Christ: When ye have
done all ye can do, (...) ye are unprofitable servant, but to faith which
only can receive the benefits of Christ, and believe that he alone has
deserved forgiveness for the sins of all the world. The Apostles were here
first taught and certified by the holy Ghost, of the conversion of the
Gentiles. Tindale.

CORNER STONE.
Look. Stone.

CORRVPTION.
From whence our corruption comes.
ADam was not created in the corruption which is spoken off here, but he
purchased it of himself. For God found all the things to be good which he had
made. Man therefore who is the excellentest of all creatures, was not marred
after that fashion, till he had withdrawn himself from God. But when he had
once separated himself from the Fountain of righteousness, what could
remain unto him but naughtiness and corruption. Thus we see from whence all
our naughtiness proceeds, and that we ought not to blame God for the vices
whereunto we be subject, and under which we be held prisoners, according to
the Scripture which says, that we be sold under simie, and become the bond
slaves of Satan. We must not blame God for this, but we must learn to know
that it is the heritage which we have from our father Adam, and therefore we
must take the whole blame to our selves before God, etc. Call. upon Job. fol.
274.

COVETOVSNES.
What Covetousness makes men to do.
Covetousness is the root of all evil. 1. Tim. 6. 10. Covetousness is Image
service. Col. 3. 5. It makes men to err from the faith. 1. Tim. 6. 10. It
has no part of the kingdom of Christ and God. Ephe. 5. 5. It hardened the
heart of Pharao, that the faith of the miracles of God, could not sink into
it. It made Balaam which knew all the truth of GOD to hate it, and to give
most pestilent counsel against it. It taught the false prophets in the old
Testament, to interpret the Law of God falsely, etc. It kept Judas in
unbelief, etc. And compelled him to sell Christ unto the Scribes and
Pharesies, for covetousness, is a thing merciless. Covetousness made the
Pharisees to lie on Christ, to persecute and falselie to accuse him. It made
Pilate, though he found him an Innocent, yet to slaie him. It caused Herod to
persecute Christ in his cradle. It makes hypocrites, to persecute the truth
against their own conscience, etc. Finally, Covetousness makes many (whom
the truth pleases at the beginning) to cast it up again, and to be afterward
the most cruel enemies thereof, after the ensample of Simon Magus. Act. 8.
Tindale. fol. 230.

Through Covetousness shall they with fained words make merchandise of you,
etc. 2. Pet. 2. 3
False Prophets must needs be among us, and also prevail, and that because we
have no love unto the truth. And Covetousness is the father of them, and their
preaching confidence in works, is the denieng of Christ. Tindale.

This is evidently seen in the Pope and his Priests, which by lies and
flatteries, sell men's souls, so that it is certain, that he is not the
successor of Simon Peter but of Simon Magus. Geneua.

COVNCELS.
Of a Council a little before that Christ revealed himself.
THere was a Council gathered together at Jerusalem, a little before y^
Christ reveled himself, to choose a Priest in the room of one that was
deceased. Look how many letters there are in the Hebrew tongue, so many
Priests there were in the Temple: to wit. 22. The manner was to register in a
certain ^ooke reserved in the Temple, the day of the election, the name of
the elected, the name of his father, of his mother, and of his Tribe. Whilst
that they thought some on one man, some on another, there stepped forth a Priest
one of the multitude, and said: My will is that Jesus the son of Joseph the
carpenter be elected Priest, who, though he be young in years, yet passes he
in vtteraunce, wisdom, and manners. I think truly there was never seen in
Jerusalem such a one, both for eloquence, life and manners, the which I am
sure all that inhabit Jerusalem do know as well as I. The which was no
sooner spoken, but was allowed of, and the party (I mean Jesus) chosen to be
a Priest. They doubt of his Tribe, again they were therein resolved. They call
for his parents to register their names. The Priest that sauoured Jesus, made
answer that Joseph his father was dead, yet Mary his mother was a live. She
was brought before them, she affirmed that she was his mother, and that Jesus
was her son. But she said moreover that he had no father on earth, that she
was a Uirgin, and the holy Ghost had ouershadowed her. They sent for the
Midwiues, and also for such as had been present at the birth, she was found to
be a virgin. In the end, they concluded with one voice, that he should be
registered, Jesus the Son of God, and of Mary the virgin. We remember moreover
Josephus to have said, that Jesus sacrificed in the Temple together with the
Priests. Heerevpon also it fell out, that as Jesus entered into the Synagogue
of the Jews, the book was delivered unto him, where he read of the Prophet
Esaias: whereby we gather, that if Jesus had not been Priest among the Jews, the
book would not have been delivered unto him. Neither is it permitted amongst
us Christians, for any to read holy Scripture in the open assembly, unless
he be of the Clergy. So far Suidas, as he learned of a Jew.

A Council of the Scribes and Pharisees.
The Scribes Scribe^,
and the Pharisees gathered a Council at Jerusalem, and sent from them
Scribes, Pharisees and Levites, unto John Baptist to know who, and what he was.
Ioh. 1. 19.

A Council of the high Priests and Pharisees.
The high Priests and Pharisees gathered a Council in the hall of the high
Priest, High Priests
to advise them what was best to be done touching the doings of Christ. If they
let him alone, then feared they least the Romans came and took their place
and Nation. They decreed therein, that whosoever knew the place of his abode,
he should inform them thereof: they decreed also, that whosoever confessed
Christ, should be excommunicated, they consulted how they might put Laza^us to
death, and how they might take Jesus by subtlety and kill him. Then Judas went
in to them, and said, what will ye give me, and I will deliver him into your
hands, and they appointed him 30. pieces of silver. John. 12. 12. Mat. 26. 3.

A Council of the Scribes, Pharisees, and Elders.
The Scribes, Pharisees, Pharisees
and Elders, hearing that Christ was risen from the dead, gathered a Council
for to suppress the rumor thereof, and concluded that a piece of moneie should
be given to the soldiers, for saying that his disciples stole him away by
night. Mat. 28. 12.

Counsels held of the Apostles.
The Apostles immediately after the Ascension of our Savior, Act. 1. 12.
returned from Mount Oliuet to Jerusalem, and there assembled together for the
election of one to succeed in the room of Judas the traitor, where they chose
Mathias.

A Council is summoned of the Apostles and disciples of Christ at Jerusalem,
Act. 6. 1.
for the removing of the tumult risen between the Grecians and the Hebrwes,
about the contemning of their widows, wherein they chose 7. Deacons.

The Apostles, Elders and Brethren, Act. 15.
gathered a Council at Jerusalem, Anno. 4. Claudij, to determine what was to
be done, touching the doctrine sowed by certain brethren of the Pharisees,
which came from Iudaea: affirming that Circumcision was necessary and the
observation of the Law. This news Paul, Barnabas and Titus brought unto
them. Gal. 2. Where they decreed, that the faithful should abstain from
things offered to Idols, from blood, from that that is strangled, and from
fornication, the which they published by their letters unto the Church of
Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: with Silas and Judas, which accompanied Paul and
Barnabas. Beda. Lyra.

James Bishop of Jerusalem, Act. 21.
Paul and the Elders summoned a Council at Jerusalem for the removing of the
slander bruted by the Jews of Paul, that he was no obseruer of the Law,
that he spoke against Moses, wherefore, for the removing of this suspicion, and
for the winning of the brethren the Council decreed that Paul should clear
him, and purisie himself, according unto the Law, yielding a little for a
time unto the Ceremonies of the Law.

Of certain general Counsels.
At Nicena was called a general Council in y^ which the Emperor Constantine
was present with 318. Bishops, by whom was determined against Arrius, that the
Son was equal with the Father. Which decree was confirmed by the Emperor,
and Arrius with 6. Bishops banished. This Council willing to reform the life
of man, did set certain laws, the which certain men would have had a Law,
to be brought in, that the Bishops, Priests, Deacons and Subdeacons, should not
lie with their wives which they had married before their consecration. But
Paphuntius a Confessor (being unmarried himself) did withstand them, and said
that their marriage was honorable, and it was pure Chastity for them to lie
with their wives. So that the Council was persuaded, not to make any such
law, affirming it to be a grievous occasion, both unto them and also unto their
wives of fornication. The Council did allow this sentence, so y^ nothing was
decreed as concerning this thing, but every man was left to his own free will,
and not bound of any necessity. Here is to be noted, that this holy Council,
did not reckon it an vnpure and filthy thing for a Bishop or a Priest to
company with his wife, but to grant that it is a pure and a clean chastity,
for a Priest to company with his wife. Also at this Council it was decreed,
that the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antiochia, should have like power over
the Countreies about those Cities, as the Bishops of Rome, had over the
Countreies about Rome. D. Barnes.

A Council was holden at Sardis, Sardis.
where 300. Bishops approved the Acts of Nicene Council. But the Bishops of
the East refused to be in their company, and assembled them at Philipolis:
where they cursed the sentence of the foresaid Council of Nicene. Cooper.

A Council held at Eliberis Eliberis.
in Spain, in the time of Constantine, decreed that the Usurer should be
excommunicated, that Tapers should not burn in the day time in Churchyards,
that women should not frequent vigills, that Images Images banished.
should be banished the Church, that nothing should be painted on the wall to
be worshipped, that every one should communicate thrice in the year. Tom. 1.
council.

In the Council of Gangreus Gangreus
this decree was made: If any man do judge or condemn a Priest that is
married, that he may not by the reason of his marriage do sacrifice, but will
abstain from his Mass by reason thereof, cursed be he. The occasion of this
Council was this: There was a certain heretic called Eustachius, the which
did among other heresies teach, that no married man should be saved. Also he
taught that priests which did marry ought to be despised, and in no wise for
to handle the blessed Sacrament. D. B.

In this Council it is written on this wise: The sixth Sinode.
Considering that it is decreed among the laws made by them of Rome, that no
Deacon nor Priests shall company with their wives: therefore we notwithstanding
that decree, following the rules of the Apostles, and the constitutions of
holy men, will that from this day forth, marriage shall be lawful, in no
wise dissoluing the matrimony between them and their wives, nor depriving them
their familiarity in time convenient. Whosoever therefore shall be found able
of the order of Deacons, Subdeacons, or of priesthood, we will that no such men
be prohibited, to ascend the dignities aforesaid, for the cohabitation of their
wives. Nor that they be constrained, at the receipt of the orders, to profess
chastity ^or to abstain from the company of their lawful wives. It
follows, if any man presume therefore against the Canons of ye Apostles, to
deprive Priests or Deacons from the copulation and fellowship of their lawful
wives, let such a man be deposed. Semblably both Priests and Deacons which
puts away their wives, under ye color of holiness, let them be
excommunicate, but if they continue in the same, let them be deposed. Note how
this Council, does condemn by name the Popes Decrees, which has commanded
spiritual men to forsake their wives. D. Barnes.

A Council was assembled at Arminium, Arminiu^
in the which 200. Bishops of the West established the Council of Nicene. But
the Arrians would not agree thereunto. The Bishops of y^ East, by the
commandment of Constantius, held a Council at Necomedia, and from thence
were transferred to Seleucia, and there indeauoured to confirm the heresy of
the Arrians.

In the third Council at Carthage, Carthage
it was decreed, that the Clergy in their years of discreatien, should
either marry or vow chastity: that the chief Bishop should not be called
the Prince of Priests, or highest Priest, but only the Bishop of the chief
Sea. Tom. 1. council.

A Council held at Hippo. Hippo
Anno Domini. 417. decreed that Bishops and Priests should look well unto
their own children: that no Bishop should app^ale over the Sea: that the
Bishop of the head Sea, should not be called the chief Priest: that no
Scripture Scripture
be read in the Church, but Canonical. Tom. 1. council.

A Council holden at the city of Pize, Pize
where both Gregory and Benet were deposed, and Alexander the 5. chosen Bishop
of Rome. Gregory and Benet that deposition notwithstanding held still the
title of Papalitie, and so were there 3 Bishops, 3. Popes
until the coming of Constaunce. Cooper.

By procurement of the Emperor Sigismound, a great Council was holden at
Constaunce, Co^stau^ce
for y^ union of the Church, which continued for the space of 4. years. To
what profit of the Church, let him judge, that has diligently read the
Histories of that time, with the A^tes of the Council, and well considered
what thereof ensued. In this Council were 3. Bishops deposed, the doctrine of
Wickleffe Wickliffe
condemned, with Master John Hus Hus
and Hierom Hierom
of Phrage adjudged to be burned, for preaching against the Bishop of Romes
usurped power. At this Council it was enacted, that no faith No faith
is to be kept with heretics. Cooper.

The second Council of Nice, Nicene. 2.
was 781. year after Christ, holden by a multitude of idolatrous, flattering
and unlearned Priests, which to feed the humor of that wicked Empress Irene,
Images restored
were gathered together, not in the name of Christ, but against Christ, etc.
And against this unlearned and blasphemous Council, Carolus Magnus wrote a
book, in which he confuteth that gross heresy of adoration of Images.

About the year of our Lord 1435. was kept the Council of Basile, Basile
without any profit to the Church and to the great trouble and disquieting of
the same. For there was a long season horrible contention among the Prelates
and Bishops there assembled, whether the authority of the Roman Bishop were of
more power then a general Council or not. Insomuch that of diverse learned
Bishops and other, it was concluded that the Bishop of Rome was an Heretic,
The Pope an Heretic.
and by their consents was deposed, because he would not obey the authority of
the general Council. Eugenius the Bishop perceived that the Council intended
diverse things contrary to his prerogative, endeavored by all means possible
to delaie the same council, or to transfer it to some other place, where more
favor should be showed him, as at Bouenia, Ferraria, Florentia, or other where,
but by the advertisement of the Emperor, he granted it to proceed at Basile.
But there present he would not be for nothing. At this Council Eugenius was
deposed, and Amodius Duke of Sauoie in France chosen in his place. But
Eugenius notwithstanding continued still as Bishop, A Duke made Pope.
and would not resign. Cooper.

This Council by reason of a great Pestilence was transferred to Florence,
Ferrare
where the Christians of Arminia and India consented to the Roman church, and
the Greeks agreed that the holy Ghost proceeded from the Father and the
Son, that there was a Purgatory, that the Sacrament ought to be celebrated
only with unleavened bread made of wheat, and that the Bishop of Rome was
Peter's lawful successor, and Christ's glorious Uicar on earth, The Popes
supremacy granted.
to whom all the world ought to obaie, which they never consented to before
this time, neither at this time did long continue in that belief. Cooper.

In the Council of Milinitani, Milinetani.
it was decreed, that if a Clearke of Afrike would appeal out of Afrike
beyond the Sea, he should be taken as a person excommunicate.

In the general Council of Constantinople the first, it was decreed, that
every cause between any person, should be determined within the Provinces,
where the matters did lie: and that no Bishop should exercise any power out
of his own Diocese or Province. And this was also the mind of holy Saint
Ciprian^, and of other holy men in Africa.

Therefore the Pope has no such Primacie given him, either by the words of
Scripture, or by any general Council, nor by common consent of the holy
Catholic faith.

And the Apostles and Elders came together, Act. 15. 6.
to reason of this matter. ^When Counsels be gathered in the name of Christ,
there is no doubt but Christ is in the mids of them and with his spirit does
assist them. But if they be gathered in their own name, that is to say, to
set forth their own glory, they are utterly destitute of the Holy Ghost,
and whatsoever they do decree or set forth, ought to be esteemed none
otherwise, but men's doctrines, and trad^tions. Sir. I. Cheek.

How Counsels may err.
THe Council may err, as it has erred concerning the contract of Matrimony
Inter raptorem and raptam. And the saying of S. Hierome was afterward preferred
above the sta^ute of the Council, as it is proved 36. Question 2. Tria. For
in things concerning the faith, the saying of a private man, is to be
preferred above the Pope, if he have better reasons and Scriptures out of the
old and new Testament for him, then the Pope has. Neither it can help that
the Council cannot err, Err.
because that Christ did pray, that the faith of the Church should not fail:
for I answer to this, that though the general do represent the whole
universal Church, yet nevertheless in very deed, there is not the universal
Church, but representative. For the universal Church stands in the election
of all faithful men throughout the whole world, whose head and spouse is
Christ Jesus. And the Pope is but the Uicar of Christ, and not the very head
of the Church. This is the Church that cannot err.

The Counsels that may be gathered together in every province, must without
doubt give place to the authority of y^ full Counsels which be gathered of
all Christendom. And also these full Counsels oftentimes must be amended by
the full counsels that came afterward, if any thing be opened by experience
that was before shut, and if any thing be known, that was before hidden. And
this must be done, without any shadow of supersticious pride, without any
boasted arrogancy, without any contention of malicious envy, but with holy
meekness, with holy peace, and with christen charity. Here Saint Augustine
says plainly, that the full Counsels may err, and may be reformed. D.
Barnes. fol. 248.

Of wicked Counsels.
Counsels that be wicked, Psa. 33. 10.
the Lord breaks, as the Prophet David says: The Lord breaks the council
of the heathen, and brings to naught the devises of the people.

The council of the builders of Babel is confounded. Genesis 11. 7.


The council of Joseph's brethren is let. Genesis 37. 7


The council of Balaac is turned. Number. 22


The council of Absalom against David his father, is destroyed. 2. Reg. 15


The council of Achitophel takes none effect. 2. Re. 17. 7


The council of Sanabalat and Tobiah against the building of Jerusalem is
disappointed. 2. Esd. 4. 7


The wicked council of Haman, Esther. 3. 8
is his own destruction.

The counsels and devises of the wicked are ouerthrown. Job. 3. 10
Esaias. 7. 3.

The council of the Pharesies and Priests, Mat. 27. 63.
etc. prevailed not.

The council of the Priests and Saduces against the Apostles prosper not. Act.
5. 17. and. 9. 23.


CRETA.
Of the description of this I Will.
THis I Will does lie between the part of Greece called Peloponesus and the
Rhodes. Tit. 1. 5.
It has one the North part the sea Aegeum and Cretense. On the South the Sea
of Egypt and Africa. It is now called Candie. In this I Will was Jupiter
nourished: whom ye Panims named their chief God. There Minos reigned, and
Rhadama^thus governed under him with most exquisit justice, as ye may read in
their places, of whose laws other countries took their first pattern: yet
notwithstanding the people of that country were noted of old Authors to be
vicious and shameful liars, as Epimenides wrote in a vearse recited by S.
Paul in his Epistle to Titus, saying: The Cretians alwaie been liars,
ungracious beasts and slothful paunches. Eliote.

Even one of their own Prophets said: The Cretians are always liars, Tit. 1.
12
evil beasts, slow bellies. He calls Epimenides ye Philosopher or Poet,
whose verse here he recites, a Prophet, because the Cretians so esteemed him,
and as Laercius writes, they sacrificed unto him as to a God, for so much as he
had a marvelous gift to understand things to come: which thing Satan by the
permission of God, has opened to the Infidells from time to time, but it
turns to their great condemnation. 1. Tim. 1. 4. Geneua.

CRY.
What it is to cry unto the Lord.
WHerefore criest thou unto me. Exo. 14. 19
To cry unto the Lord, is to pray unto him with full heart, and fervent
desire, as Moses here did, and yet spoke never a word, and so does this word
crieng and making of noise signify, throughout all the Psalms. And in the
Psalm. 5. 2 T. M.

Thus in temptations, faith fights against the flesh, and cries with inward
gronings unto the Lord. Geneua.

This erie is to be understood, not of the sound of his, voice, but of the
earnest affection of his heart. The Bible note.

What it is to cry from the ends of the earth.
From the ends of the earth will I cry unto thee, etc. Psa. 61. 2
To cry from the ends of the earth is, being in a far Countr^ie to sigh
with affection, and pray with fervent desire, to come out of the tribulation
and adversity, wherein we are oppressed in those far Countreies, and to be
brought again to the place where we would wish us. Read the 3. of the Kings,
the 8. chap. ver. 47. David was driven into the utmost Coasts of all Israel,
both when Saul and Absalom persecuted him, and therefore says he, How far
soever I be outlawed, yet will I call upon the Lord, and trust surely to
obtain my request.

From the place where I was banished, being driven out of the City and Temple
by my son Absalom. Geneua.

CROSS.
How the Cross of Christ is not to be worshipped.
SAint Ambrose (against the opinion of Damascene) speaking of the finding of
the holy cross by Helene Constantines mother, says: Inuenit ergo Helena
titulum, etc. Helene therefore did find the title, she worshipped the king and
not the wood verelie. For this is an error of the Gentles, and a vanity of
the ungodly: but she worshipped him y^ hung upon the wood, which was written in
the title. Here we see that to worship eue^ the very cross that Christ did
hang upon, it is an error of the Gentles, and a vanity of the ungodly. Now
if the cross that Christ died and hung upon, and did imbrue with his blood,
may not be worshipped unless we will run into the error of the idolatrous
heathen, and into the vanity of the ungodly: how much less ought the other
crosses, that are only made after the figure and likeness of it, be
worshipped. I. Veron.

How the Cross was esteemed among the Egyptians and Romans.
The cross among the Egyptians was had in such estimation, that they did set
it upon the breast of their Gods. And among the Jews and Romans, the death
upon the cross, was reputed and taken for ignomious and shameful.

Of bearing the Cross.
Seneca rehearses, that this was an old Proverb, when they exhorted any man
to suffer adversity, Follow God. By which they declared, that then only men
truly entered under the yoke of God, when he yielded his hand and back to
GODS correction. Calvin in his Institutions 3. book. chap 8. sect. 4.

CROWN OF GOLD.
What is understood by the Crown of gold, that David speaks of here.
POsuisti in capite eius corona de lapide precioso, Psa. 21. 3
Thou have set a Crown of pure gold upon his head. Applieng these words of
the Prophet unto Christ, of whom the whole Psalm is chiefelie spoken, we
cannot verefie these words by him literallie. Thou have set a Crown of gold
upon his head. Indeed we read, how he was crowned with a Crown of sharp
Thorns upon his head, but never with a Crown of gold: For he said when the
people would have made him a King: Regnum meum non est de hoc mundo, My
kingdom is not of this world. To apply therefore these words of the Prophet
unto Christ, we must understand by the Crown of gold, the great victory that
Christ had over the Devil, the World, Death, Damnation and Hell. And if we
will apply this place of the vearse to the members of Christ, which be, all
just livers and faithful believers, then we must understand by the Crown of
gold, the joy and glory everlasting, that is prepared for us in Heaven. This
glory, this li^e, does Saint Paul call in sundry places a Crown. Bonum
certamen, etc. I have fought a good fight (says he) I have fulfilled my
course, I have kept my faith: from henceforth, there is laid up for me a
Crown of righteousness, which the Lord (that is a righteous Judge) shall give
me at that day, not to me only, but to all them that look for his coming.

They that go about to verify these words of the Prophet (Thou have set a
Crown of gold upon my head) literallie they do allege for it, the
glorious victory that GOD gave to David over the Ammonites, whose King, David
took prisoner, and did wear his Crown of gold. This Crown of gold which
David got in Battle, is thought to be the Crown whereof mention is made,
when the Prophet says, Posuisti in capite, etc. But for as much, as the Psalm
is a Prophetical Scripture, which takes place to the end of the world in all
other godly Kings as well as David, and specially is most verefied in Christ,
and in all his true members, therefore it is better and more sound
interpretation to understand by the Crown of gold the heavenly glory of the
life everlasting. Ric. Turnar.

What is meant by the Crown that Job speaks of.
And taken the crown away from my head. Job. 19. 9
Rabi Abraham understands by the crown, the dignity that comes to the
rich, by the means of their riches, for all men have the rich in honor:
although some understand thereby his children, as in the Proverbs. 17. 2. The
Crown of old men are their childrens children. Other understand the dignity
that came unto him of his wisdom and cunning. So Jobs meaning is, that of a
worshipful and rich man, he became poor and despised. T. M.

Meaning his children, and whatsoever was dear unto him in this world. Geneua.

CRVELTIE.
From whence this word cruelty is derived.
THis word Cruelty is derived either of this Latin word Cruor, which
signifies blood, wherein cruel men like best to delight, either of Crudae
carnis, which signifies raw flesh, which fierce and barbarous people sometime
do eat, and may be defined to a vicions habit, whereby we are inclined to
sharp and hard things above reason. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 12.

CVBITE.
What the measure of a Cubite is.
A Cubite with the Grecians is two foot, but with the Latins a foot and a
half. Some allege the cause of this difference to be, because the measure
may be extended from the elbowe to the hand, being sometimes closed and
sometimes open or stretched forth. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 16.

CVP.
The sundry significations of this word, Cup.
IN the Cup of his wrath. Ape. 14. 10
The transposing of the word Cup from his own proper signification, both in
good part and in evil, is very rife in the Scripture, for God has allotted
unto every man his portion of prosperity or adversity by mesure certain,
and he shall drink it whether he will or no. In this sentence following, it is
taken in evil part: The spirit of tempest is the portion of their cup. Psalm.
11. 6. that is to say, vengeance is the reward, that God has ordained for
their wickedness. In these sentences following it is taken in good part: The
Lord is the lot of my part and of my cup. Psalm. 16. 5. that is to say, he is
my appointed heritage: Also my ouerflowing cup. Psalm. 23. 5. that is to say,
the goods which God has given unto me as my lot, are abundant. Moreover,
Christ says, Can ye drink of the cup that I shall drink? Math. 20. 22. by
which words Christ demanded of the sons of Zebedie, whether they were able
to endure the cross and torments that he should suffer, for so is meant by
drinking of the cup that he should drink of. A. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 210.

The meaning of this place following.
Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of. Mat. 20. 22.
This is spoken by a figure, taking the cup, for that which is contained in the
cup. And again the Hebrews understand by this word cup, sometime the manner
of punishment which is rendered to sin, as Psalm. 11. 6. or the joy that is
given to the faithful. As. Psalm. 23. 5. and sometime a lotte or condition. As
Psalm. 16. 5.

What the Cup of the new Testament signifies.
This Cup is the new Testament in my blood. Luke 22. 20 Fulgentius.
This Cup or Chalice is the new Testament, that is, this Cup or Chalice which I
deliver unto you, does signify the new Testament. Here it is plain, the Cup
is not the new Testament, but does signify the new Testament. Therefore the
bread is not the body, but does signify the body. I. Frith.

The sign of the new Testament, which is established and ratified by Christ's
blood. Geneua.

As the Cup is ye new Testament, so the bread is the body of Christ. By the
new Testament, he understands the forgiveness of sins. Heb. 8. 12. But the
Cup does only represent unto us the new Testament, that is to say, the
forgiveness of our sins, that we have in the blood of Christ. Sir. I. Cheek.

Here is a double Metonymia. For first the vessel is taken for that which is
contained in the vessel, as the Cup for the wine which is within the Cup. Then
the wine is called the Covenant or Testament, whereas in deed, it is but the
sign of the Testament, or rather of the blood of Christ, whereby the Testament
was made, neither is it a vain sign, though it be not all one, with the thing
it represents. Beza.

What is meant by the Cup of salvation.
I will take the Cup of salvation, Psalm. 116. 13.
and call upon the name of the Lord. In the law they used to make a banquet,
when they gave solemn thanks unto God, and to take the Cup and to drink, in
sign of thanksgiving. Geneua.

I will take the Cup, etc. In token of my deliverance. The Bible note.

He alludeth to the manner that was used under the law. For when they gave
solemn thanks unto God, there was also a feast made, whereat was made an
holy drinking in token of gladness, and because this doing was as a
Sacrament of their deliverance out of Egypt, he termed it the Cup of
salvation. Calvin.

Of the cup of blessing.
Is not the Cup of blessing which we bless, 1. Cor. 10. 16
partaking of the blood of Christ, etc. That is to say, they that do eat of
the bread and drink of the Cup of the Lord with thanksgiving, are the
Communion of the body and blood of Christ, that is to say, the congregation
of them that are washed in the blood of Chrst, being made his body and
members. Sir I. Cheek.

The Cup of blessing. Of thanksgiving, whereupon that holy banquet was called
Eucharist, that is, a thanksgiving. Is it not the Communion, etc. A most
effectual pleadge and note of our knitting together with Christ, and
ingraffing to him. Beza.

Is not the Communion, etc. The effectual badge of our conjunction and
incorporation with Christ. Geneua.

How the Cup is taken for the drink in the Cup.
Drink of it all, Mat. 26. 2
for it is my blood of the new Testament. For it is (that is to say) the
drink that is in the Cup, or if ye list, the Cup is my blood of the new
Testament, taking the Cup for drink, by a manner of speaking used in all
tongues, as when we say, I have drunk a Cup of good wine, we take there the
Cup for the wine, my blood of the new Testament, that is to say, my blood, for
whose shedding sake, this new Testament and covenant is made unto you, for the
forgiveness of sins. Tindale.

How by the Cup is signified Christ's passion.
Ye shall drink of my Cup. Mat. 20. ^
By the Cup and Baptime be understood his bitter passion and death, as he
himself testifies a little after, saying: Let this Cup pass from me. Sir I.
Cheek.

How the Cup is taken for the cross of affliction.
Are ye able to drink of the Cup, Mat. 20. 22
etc. He sets the cross before their eyes to draw them from ambition,
calling it a Cup, to signify the measure of the afflictions, which God has
ordained for every man. The which thing also he calls baptime. Geneua.

Of the Popes golden Cup.
Having a Cup of gold in her hand. Apoc. 17. 4
He speaks of untoward and counterfeit doctrine. The Pope boasts himself
to have the Scripture: but he corrupts it with his bloody gloses, and makes
men to drink of the troubled or rather stinking water of puddles, in steed of
Gods pure words which is the meat and drink of our saules. The Popes cup
These blasphemous and abominable decretals which the Romish Antichrist
serves his guests withal, are yet extant, howbeit y^ he serves them in a
golden Cup, that is to wit, under the name of Christ's Uicarship, under the
color of the Gospel, and under such glorious names, as that all things
proceed of the instinct of the holy Ghost, and that he cannot err, etc.
This is the golden Cup which has beguiled many, etc. Marl. upon the Apoc.
fol. 242.

CVRSE.
What this word curse imports.
AS concerning this word curse, let us mark that it gives us not scope to
wish the mischief or confusion of the party (I mean through desire of
vengeance, as oftentimes we be so carried away by our passions, as there
reigns nothing in us but heart burning and bitterness, or at least wise, a
foolish and indiscreet zeal) But whereas it is said that Eliphas cursed the
wicked man's house: it imports nothing else, but that he hold him to that
which the scripture teaches and shows us. And therefore it is not for us to
be Judges, for it were too great a rashness, if we should take so much
pre-eminence upon us as to say: O that man shall make an evil end, or such a
man shall come to shame. A man must not presume so far, but it belongs to
God only to curse or to bless. Call. upon Job. fol. 80.

Of two manner of cu^ses.
Upon me be thy curse my son. Genesis 27. 13
There are two manner of curses in the Scripture, the one is in the soul, that
pertains to the soul, as sin and wickedness. And the other to the body,
as all temporal misery, and wretchedness. As Genesis 3. and Deuteronomy. 23. T. M.

Of the curse of good men.
What strength the curse of holy men, Iudic. 9. 7.
oppressed with wrong has to bring the vengeance of God upon the oppressors,
4. Re. 2. 24.
may appear by Ioathan the son of Ierobaal: and likewise by Eliseus the
Prophet.

And cursed them in the name of the Lord. 4. Re. 2. 24
Perceiving their malicious heart against the Lord, he desires God to take
vengeance of that injury done unto him. Geneua.

The meaning of this place following.
Cursed be he that does the work of the Lord negligentlie, Iere. 48. 10
and cursed be he that keeps back his sword from shedding of blood. The
Hebrews exround this of the Chal^ees, that they should haste to destroy the
whole kingdom of the Moabites: as though the text should mean thus much:
Cursed be he that negligently performs the vengeance of the Lord, that
spares these most wicked Moabites, and that withholds his sword from
shedding of their blood. T. M.

He shows that God would punish the Chaldeans, if they did not destroy the
Egyptians, and that with a courage, and calls this executing of his
vengeance against his enemies his work: though the Chaldeans sought an other
end. Geneua.

What Gods curse is.
Look God.

CUSTOM.
A definition of custom.
Custom (says Ostiensis) is an use agreeing with reason, allowed by the
common institution of them that use it, whose beginning is time out of mind,
or which is by a just time prescribed and confirmed, so that it is by no
contrary act interrupted, but allowed with contradictorie judgment. This is
(as he thinks) a full definition. But in that he says, that that use ought
to be agreeing with reason, it is not sufficient. But first it is to be said
that it ought to agree with the word of God, for that is to be counted for the
chief reason. Afterward it must be allowed by the institution of the people,
and of whose beginning there is no mention, or that it is prescribed by a just
time, and appointed by the laws, neither is interrupted by any contrary
action. For if a Judge or Prince shall give judgment against it, the custom
is broken. As it also happens in prescription is cast out of his possession,
or the matter is called into law, and the matter is in plead, the prescriptio^
is broken. Also the allowing of the contradictorie judgment ought to be had,
that is, when one part alleges the custom, and an other part denies it. If
it be pronounced on the custom side, that does confirm it. But all these
things as I have before said, must be reckoned unto the rule of Gods word.
Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 190.

Of vicious customs, and what difference is between a law and a custom.
In the country of Taurus, there was a custom to kill strangers and guestes.
The Persians had a custom never to deliberate of weighty matters, but in
feasts, and when they were drunk. Among the Sauromates there was a custom,
that when they were drinking they sold their daughters. These prescribe not,
when they are manifestly vicious and ill. But that custom prescribes, which
is neither against the word of God, nor the law of nature, nor the common
law. For the right of custom comes by the approbation and secret consent of
the people. Otherwise why are we bound unto laws? But because they were
made, the people consenting and agreeing unto them. For this is the difference
between a custom and a law, because in the one is a secret assent, but in
the other an open assent. Wherefore such customs cannot be reckoned without
danger. Aristotle in Politicis, admonishes that men which have learned to do
sinister things, ought not to be compelled to do things dextere. Wherefore
in things indifferent and of no great value, custom is to be retained. It is
an old Proverb, Law and Country, for every region has certain customs
of their own, which cannot easily be changed. But it is said when they are
against the word of God, or against nature, or the common law, they are not
prescribe. For then are they not only customs, but beastly cruelties. Pet.
Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 189.

How custom must yield to the word of God, and to truth.
It is chiefly to be considered how the Apostle lays the Oracle of God
against an old received custom. We are taught by this example, that such is
the authority of Gods word, that unto it all things which were instituted of
men, of a godly zeal and holy intent, ought to give place, as soon as they
seem any ways to make against the will of God. Therefore their obstinacy is
very peevish and pernicious that go about to retain these Ceremonies in the
church, which it appears have been devised by foolish men, for the
confirmation of superstition, and are very derogatorie to the merits of
Christ. They think it a dangerous matter to alter or change any thing. But
it is much more dangerous to stick to the observation of old errors with
the loss of salvation. And we ought to remember that the obedience of faith
is the end of true christianity, which requires of us to deny our selves,
and to resign and yield up all our thoughts and judgments, unto the will
and power of God. Gualter upon the words of Saint Peter to Cornelius men. vz.
But God has showed me that I should not call any thing common or unclean,
etc.

After the truth is once found out, Augustine
let custom give place unto the truth, let no man set custom before the truth
and reason, for reason and truth put evermore custom to silence.

If you lay custom for your self, G^egorie.
ye must remember that Christ says, I am the way, the truth, and the life: he
says not, I am custom, and doubtless any custom be it never so ancient,
never so common, yet must it needs yield unto truth.

If only Christ must be heard, Cipriane.
we may not weigh what any man has thought good to do that has been before
us, but what Christ has first done which is before all, for we may not
follow the custom of man, but the truth of God. Specially for that God says
by the Prophet Esaie, they worship me in vain, teaching the commandments
and doctrines of men.

CUSTOMS.
What customs are.
Customs are these which are paid of Merchaundises, and of those things which
are either carried out or brought in. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 263.

CVT OF.
What is meant by this cutting of.
And will cut him of. To wit from the rest, or will cut him into two parts,
which was a most cruel kind of punishment. Wherewith as lustine Martyr
witnesses, Esaias the Prophet was executed by the Jews. The like kind of
punishment we read of. 1. Reg. 15. 33. and Dani. 3. 29. Beza.

DAY.
How the days were first called, and after changed.
^ The Jews did call the whole week Sabbatum. As we read in the Gospel,
where the Pharesie boasted himself of his fasting, saying: Ieiuno bis in
Sabbato: I fast twice every week. And like as the Jews did call the whole
week Sabbatum, so did they call the feast, and the chief day of the week
Sabbatum, the Sabbath day. And the next day they called Prima Sabbati. As we
may perceive by the words of the Evangelist Saint Mathewe, saying: Vespere
autem sabbati quae lucessit in prima sabbati, venit Maria Magdalena, and altera
Maria videre sepnlchrum. Upon the Sabbath day at night, which dawneth upon the
first of the sabbots, came Marie Magdalene, and an other Marie, to behold the
Sepulcher: and that same day that Saint Matthew calls Prima Sabbati. Saint
Mark in the 16. Chapter does call it Vna Sabbati, saying: Cum transis^et
Sabbatum, Maria Magdalena and Maria Iacobi and Salomi emeru^t aromati, vt
venientes vngerent Iesum, and valde mane vna Sabbatorum veniunt ad monumentem
orto iam sole. These places do prove that the Jews did use to call the first
of the week, Prima Sabbati, and the second day, Secunda Sabbati, the third,
Tercia Sabbati, the fourth, Quarta Sabbati, the fifth, Quinta Sabbati. And the
sixth which we call Fridaie, they did call Sexta Sabbati, vell dies parascenes:
the day of preparation to the Sabbath. The Gentiles following the Hebrews in
the number of days, concerning the week they did yet change the names of the
days, according to the names of their Gods which they did weekelie worship,
Primum dicabant sole, secundum lunae. The first day in the honor of the Sun
(which they did count the giver of light) they did call Dies soli, Sundaie. The
second in y^ honor of the Moon, which they did count the giver of the body,
they did call Dies lunae Mundaie. The third day in the honor of Mars, whom
they did worship as the giver of lusty courage, they did call Dies Marti,
Tuesdaie. The fourth day in the honor of Mercury, to whom they did ascribe
the gift of wisdom and eloquence they did call Dies Mercurij, Wednesdaie. The
fifth day in the honor of Jupiter, to whom they did ascribe the gift of
temperaunce, soberness, and discreation, they did call it Dies louis.
Thursdaie. The sixth day in the honor of Venus the Goddess of love, they did
call Dies Veneris, Fridaie. The seventh day in the honor of God Saturn, the
promoter of men to lumpish lowering and heavy dullness, they called it Dies
Saturni, (...). Now Siluester Siluister.
Bishop of Rome, about a 300. years after the ascension of Christ, made
many laws and decrees ecclesiastical, of the which this was one, that the
days of the week should loose their old name. The day which before was
called Dies Solis, should now be called Dies Dominicus, and Mundaie, he called
Feria secunda, Tusedaie. Feria tertia. Wednesdaie, Feria quarta, Thursdaie,
Feria quinta. And Fridaie, Feria sexta. The name of Saterdaie he retained still,
only altering the feast into Sundaie.

This word Feriae Feriae.
is always used in the plural number, and never in the singular number as
Siluester did abuse it. Hae Feria^, arum. in latin, be properly called all
days of rest, which we call holidaies. Ric. Turnar.

Fabian and other Chronicles tell, that when the Saxons invaded the realm, and
there were 7. kings ruling here at once, they brought with them two Idols, the
one called Wed and the other Fria. Or else as other write, it was a noble
Captain and his wife, which for their worthiness were made Gods, and when
they had overcome the English men, they made two days in the week to be
called, Wednesdaie and Fridaie, Wensday Fridaie.
by the names of their false Gods or Captains, and so to be worshipped, which
names be kept still.

What is meant by the day here in this place.
For the day shall declare it, 1. Co. 3. 13
and it shall be showed in fire. Day here signifies the time when God
brings to light things that is hid. By fire understand exquisite and perfect
true judgment, the which when it has opened the fault and error, affliction
of forethinking and repenting does follow. Saint Paul entreats here of
preachers that succeeded him, when he was departed from the Corinthians. He had
laid a good foundation, let other take heed (says he) what they build
thereon. If they build things worthy for Christ, their works will remain and
abide, even when it is seen in the light, which thing he signifies when he
says, the day shall declare it, but if they bring in Jewish fashions, they
shall happily deceive for a time, but at length their deceit shall be opened,
as soon as it is begun to be examined with true and sincere judgment, which
is signified by this word fire. Thus does Erasmus expound this place in his
Annotations upon these words, Haie and Stubble.

Proving also by the authority of Ambrose, (...), and other old authors,
that it makes nothing for Purgatory, though many have wrongfullie labored,
to wrest it to that purpose. Tindale^.

The day, etc. Or the time which is, when the light of the truth shall expel,
the darkness of ignorance, then the curious ostentation of man's wisdom shall
be brought to naught. Geneua.

How good days are to be esteemed.
Say not thou what is the cause that the days in the old time, Eccles. 7. 10
were better then they be now, for that were no wise question. Good days are
not to be esteemed by prosperity, but by virtue and true religion, as the
days of Christ, are better then the days of Moses. The Bible note.

Why it was called the day of sweet bread.
In the first day of sweet bread. Mat. 26. 17
They were called the days of sweet bread, because that by the space of
seven days, no leauened bread was used among the Jews, where they kept their
Easter. Exo. 12. 15, Sir. I. Cheek.

This was the fourteenth day of the first month: and the first day of
unleavened bread, should have been the fifteenth, but because this days
evening (which after the manner of the Romans was referred to the day before)
did belong to the Jews manner to the day following, therefore it is called the
first day of unleavened bread. Beza.

What is meant by the day of Madian.
As the day of Madian. Esaias. 9.
By the day of Madian is meant the day wherein Gedeon with three hundred men
five an innumerable multitude of y^ Madian^^s, as ye read, Iudic. 7. th^^

Again, we do in vain trouble and fo^ie our selves to re^ken and define,
Augustine
how many years there (...) of the world. Augustine the (...)

As for we (says Saint Austen^) I dare hot verily number and count the time

that is looked for in the end. And a little after in the same Epistle hoe
says: To reckon therefore the times that we may know when the end of the
world, or the coming of the Lord shall be, seems to me none other thi^ th^n
to go abo^^t to know that that he himself says, that no man may know.
And truly the opportunity of that time shall not be until the Gospel be
preached in all the world, for a witness unto all the world. August, ad
Hesichin. 79. Epist.

It is not for you to know the times of the season, Augustine
which the (...) put in his own power Act. 1. 7. And of that day and houte
knows no man, neither Angel neither power, nor the Son, but the Father
alone, Math. 24. 36. And that that is written, that the day of the Lord
comes as a thief, does manifestly declare that no man ought to take upon
him the knowledge of y^ time by any computation of years. For if that after
7000. years, that day shall come, then every man by reckoning of these
years, may learn his coming a How shall this be then? Nor the son of ^an
knows it? Which thing becilye is so spoken, because that by the son of man,
they learn not this, not that to him he knows it not, but after that phrase
of speech in Deuteronomy. 13. 3. Your Lord GOD tempts you, that he may know (that
is to say) that he may make you to know. Arise Lord, that is to say, make
us arise. When it is said then, that the son of man knows not this day,
not that be knows not, but that he makes them not to know, to whom it is
expedient not for to know it (that is) he does not reveal or open this unto
them. What. manner of presumption is that, the which by the computation of
years, hopest most certeinlye upon the day of the LORD, after. 7000. years:
let us therefore willingly be ignorant of that thing, that the Lord would not
have us to know. August. upon the 6. Psalm.

DAGON.
What Dagon was.
WHat this Dagon was, it is not very well known, howbeit as far as may be
judged by the Etimologie of the word, Leucothea was the Goddess called of
Matura and Aurora
it was some God of the Sea. For Dag in Hebrew signifies a fish. And that both
the Grecians and the Latins worshipped Gods of the sea it is certain. For
they had Neptune, Leucothea, and Triton. Above the belly (as they say) it had
the form of a man, and downward it ended in the form of a fish. Such a God
worshipped the Philistines. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 234.

In the temple of Dagon. ^. Pa. 10. 10
The Idol of the Philistines, which from the belly upward was like a man, and
from the belly downward had the form of a fish Geneua.

DAMNATION.
How this word is understood in this place.
They will marry, ^. Tim. 5. 12.
having damnation. Saint Paul does not here speak of everlasting damnation,
but by this word damnation does rather understand the shame that those wanton
widows shall have in the world for breaking of their promise. Ambrose.
Erasmus. If this place be well understood, it is able alone to overthrow all
the monkish vows. Sir. I. Cheek.

DAN.
Why the tribe of Dan is left out, and which is likened to the Pope.
The Tribe of Manasses is put in, Apoc. 7. 6.
and the Tribe of Dan is left out quite, the reason whereof the Fathers have
rendered to be this: namely, that Antichrist should be borne of the Tribe of
Dan, according to Jacobs prophecy: Dan is an Adder in the way. Gene. 47. 17.
which thing agrees very well by mystical signification, (that is to say, by
the interpretation of the name) unto Antichrist, that is to say, the Pope. For
the word Dan signifies a Judge. This does Antichrist challenge to himself,
insomuch as he makes his bragges, that he alone may judge all men, and no
man may judge him. Distinct. 40. 61. Papa. Wherein according to Paul's
judgment, ought to be at the discreation of the sitters, that is to say, of
the Church. 1. Cor. 14. 29. He that hears not the church, must (as our
Savior says) be counted as an heathen and a publicane. Math. 18. 17. Marl.
upon the Apoc. fol. 108.

DANIEL.
Wherefore he set open his window when he prayed.
AND the windows of his chamber toward Jerusalem stood open, Dan. 6. 10
etc. Because he would not by his silence show that he consented to this
wicked decree he set open his windows toward Jerusalem when he prayed,
both to stir up himself with the remembrance of Gods promises to his people
when they should pray toward the Temple, and also that other might see, that
he would never consent in heart nor deed for these few days, to any thing
contrary to Gods glory. Call. upon Dam. and Geneua.

Wherefore he absteined from the kings meat.
But Daniel purposed in his heart, not to be polluted with the portion of the
kings meat and drink. Here some do doubt whether any such matter were in
the meat and the drink, that Daniel ought to abstain from them. For this
seems some note of superstition, and we know that all things are pure, unto
the pure, which rule is true in all worlds.

Again we do read no such thing of Joseph. And it is very like that Daniel
afterward did use such meats when he was in his great authority with the
king: wherefore this was not always observed of Daniel, and therefore it may
seem now either an unadvised zeal, or too much singularity. To this may be
answered, that God allows it in Daniel, and in his fellows, as it were by
miracle, preserving them fair liking in their mourning and strait diet, and
therefore it is not to be doubted, but by Gods spirit they were thus at ye first
moved to abstain for a time from the kings delicates, and so to record that
they were exiles and captives brought from the holy city and the holy kindred
of Abraham into an idolatrous country and people, whose manners were
abominable unto them, and so they count their fine meats and deintie fare,
pollution and abomination for the consequence that would have ensued, if they
had greedelie given themselves unto them. For Daniel knew the danger, that
they should have been corrupted with heathenish manners, if they had thus at
y^ first given themselves up to have been abused with sumptuous fare and
princely dishes. Wherefore absteining from them he keeps his mind in
reverence to God, he reteineth the remembrance of his own state and country,
he disapointeth the King of his crafty purpose, and grows into more credit
through Gods providence. Call. upon. Daniel.

Not that he thought any religion to be in the meat and drink, for
afterward he did eat. But because the King should not entice him by this
sweet poison to forgette his religion and accustomed sobriety, and that in
his meat and drink, he might dailye remember of what people he was. And
Daniel brings this into show, how God from the beginnning assisted him with
his spirit, and at length called him to be a Prophet. Geneua.

DARKNESS.
Of the darkness that was in the land of Iewrie, at the death of Christ.
Darkness over the land, Mat. 27. 45.
etc. Not over the whole earth, but this darkness was over Judea only or
Jerusalem. For if this darkness had been over the whole world, it would
have been thought a natural Eclipse, and so not regarded of men. But to have
Judea covered with darkness, and the Sun to thine in other places, was a
more notable miracle. Tertulian does affirm in this Apologitico, that this
darkness of the Sun was written in the book of ancient monuments of ye
Romans. For Pilate (as he writes in an other place) had foreshewed all these
things unto Tiberius. Eusebius also in his Chronicles makes mention of this
darkness of the Sun, and of the earthquake, by the which many hou^es in
Bechania sell down. He brings in Philogontis, the writer of the Olimpiades,
for his witness. There want not some which write that this darkness was over
the whole world, being lead thereunto by the writing of Philogontis and Orosius
describing ^eraduenture those things which were kept of this matter in the
monumentes of the Romans, being written and foreshewed (as we said even now)
by Pilate unto Tiberius. But although this was brought forth by one or two
writers, yet notwithstanding ye history of their times was so common, that
such a notable miracle could not be buried in silence, of so many which
diligently observed those things, which were not so well worthy to be
remembered. Marl. fol. 726.

What is understood by darkness in this place.
And the darkness comprehended it not. John. 1. 5.
This darkness, that is to say, the unfaithful which do sit always in
darkness, and in the shadow of death, do all that they can to darken and put
out the beams of this Sun, but they shall never prevail. Psalm. 9. Esaie. 29.
Abdy. 1. Sir I. Cheek.

They could not perceive nor reach unto it, to receive any light of it, no,
they did not so much as acknowledge him. Beza.

What is meant here by darkness.
And men loved darkness, John. 3.^
etc. By darkness is here meant the ignorance of Christ, and whatsoever else
worldly men love more then Christ. For they which are not borne of God, as they
cannot hear the word of God, so it is necessary y^ they prefer the ignorance
of Christ, before they knowledge him, and so to love darkness more then light.
Marl. upon John. fol. 82.

DAVID.
Of David's praise to king Saul by Doeg.
DOeg one of the chief about Saul hated David, 1. Re. 22. 9
and praised him to Saul, not of love, but of hatred, thinking that for as
much as Saul was now vexed with a devil, he might kill David at one time or
other, but God turned it to good. Lyra.

The cause why David was unknown, both to Saul and Abner.
Saul said to Abner, 1. Re. 17. 55
whose son is this young man? and Abner answered, as thy soul lives O
King I cannot tell. Saul knew not David now, although he had been in service
with him before. And the matter that brought out Saul of knowing of David, was
his bearde, which was now grown, and did change the sight of his face very
much. And why did Abner say, that he knew not David, seeing he was in
service with him before. Ans. It might be that Abner did not know David, for
that he was captain of the kings army, and always occupied in the kings
affairs, in the extreme parts of his dominion and not at home during the
small time of David's being with king Saul. Lyra.

Of David's coming to Ahimelech the Priest.
When Ahimelech saw David come so sodeinlie, 1. Re. 21. 1
and so hastily unto him, and also alone, he meruailed not a little thereat,
and said: Quare tu solus, and nullus est ^ecum? Why art thou alone and no man
with thee? Here it seems that David had no body with him, but himself
alone, when he came to Ahimelech, but that is not so, for the text says
afterward, if thy servants be clean fro women: So that it appears that he
had men with him, but yet very few, in comparison of them that he was wont to
have. And therefore Ahimelech says, Why come thou alone. The Evangelist S.
Matthew also says, have ye not read what David did when he was an hungered, and
they that were with him, how he entered into the house of God, and did eat the
show breads which were not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were
with him, but only for the Priests. Here it is plain, that he came not to
Ahimelech alone. Ric. Turnar.

Of David's ^e to Ahimelech.
The king has commanded me a certain thing, 1. Re. 21. 2
etc. These infirmities that we see in the Saints of God, teach us that none
has his justice in himself, but receives it of Gods mercy. Geneua.

This lie that David made to Ahimelech Priest of Nob, and such like infirmities
as we see in the Saints of God, may teach us, that no man is just of himself,
but receives all justice at Christ's hand. The Bible note.

Why the people flocked to David.
And there gathered unto him, 1. Re. ^2. 2
all men that were in comberaunce and in debt. The peoples gathering to David,
was not to assemble a rebellious multitude to invade King Saul, and to depose
him from the Crown, to set up himsel^e. For neither they came for any such
purpose, but for their succor, being in debt and trouble or otherwise vexed:
Neither did David send for them nor incited any to take his part, nor
proclaimed himself to be King, or published the Lords anointing of him, or
ever used that multitude that came unto him, for any such purpose. And yet the
question is moved, both by Caietanus and Lyranus heerevpon. The question (says
Ca^etanus) arises, whether it were lawful for David to receive these debtors,
in the prejudice of the Creditours that had lent them? The solution is, that if
these men had houses, fields or vineyards, they are understood to have left
their goods unto them. But if they were utterly unable to pay their debts,
they were excused for their inability, until their better ability. For, that
David excellently instructed all the^ that came unto him, while he tarried in
that Cave. The Psalm testifies: I will praise the Lord at all times,
Containing (according to the letter) a doctrine given there of David unto the
Soldiers. Therefore David received not these men in prejudice of their
Creditours. And thus as he did not receive them to the prejudice of any
private man: so he received them not to the prejudice of the King and public
state. Where as Lyra moves the other question, saying: In that he became
their Captain, it seems he sinned in receiving such as Abimelech received:
the needy and vagabonds assembling them unto him, as is contained Iudi. 9. We
must say that he gathered them, not to slaie the innocent, as did Abimelech to
slaie his brethren, neither to spoil the faithful. For we read not that he
spoiled ye people of Israel, but rather kept their goods, as is contained
afterward. 1. Reg. 25. of Nabal, but he gathered them to persecute the
Infidells, as is contained afterward in many places, and to keep his own
body from the ambushment of Saul. The which he might do in such a
necessity, chiefelie when he was now anointed King. By reason whereof in such
a case, he might prolong the payment of the debtes, and in many the forfeifure
is released in the case aforesaid. I. Bridges.

How David's adultery was punished.
When God minded to punish David for rauishing Bethsabe, 2. Reg. 11. 4
he said unto him, Thou have done this thing priuelie, but I will make the
Sun to bear witness of it. How was that? What was that God would do unto
David? It was that Absalom should ravish his fathers wives, 2. Reg. 16. 22.
and defile them in the presence of all the people, in the sight of the Sun.
Call. upon Job. fol. 22.

How David is said to be righteous.
David did that which was right in the sight of God, 3. Re. 15. 5
and turned from nothing that he commanded him, all the days of his life,
save only in the matter of Vrias the Hethite. This seems not to be true,
for it is said in another place, that he did sin in numbering his people, and
in the sentence he gave again Mephiboseth. But it is to be understood, that
these sins were nothing in respect of that he had committed against Vrias,
and therefore were not reputed unto him. Lyra.

How David numbered the people, and whereof it came.
Whereof came it that David numbered the people: 1. Pa. 21. 1
the text reports how it was the Devil that stirred up all the mischife, when
David numbered so the people of God. David then being one of Gods children, was
notwithstanding sometimes delivered unto the power of Satan, to be beguiled by
him. Now when we see this, we have good cause to pray unto God, and to come
and shroud our selves under the shadow of his wings, and there to hide us. For
if such things befell unto David, what shall become of us, etc. Call. upon Job.
fol. 22.

Why David and Abraham are first rehearsed in the Genealogy.
The son of David, the son of Abraham. Math 1. 1.
These two are first rehearsed in the book of the Genealogy of Christ,
because Christ was first promised unto them. For unto Abraham it was said: In
thy seed, that is to say in Jesus Christ, All Nations shall be blessed. And
David in the mystical Psalm. says: Of the fruit of thy womb shall I set upon
thy seat. Geneua.

Where David laid up the Armor of Golias.
David in the first book of Kings, Chapter 17. 54. says, that he put the
Armor of Golias, into his own Tent. But Lyra says, that he laid it up in
the Tabernacle of the Lord. For so it appears (says he) in the 21. 9. where
it is said: The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest, etc. Behold
it is wrapped in a Cloth behind the ^phod. Lyra

DAVNCING.
How Dancing is a cursed mirth.
THe wicked run after the Tabor and the Flute, etc. It is true, Job. 21. 12
that the Flute and the Tabor and such other like things are not to be
condemned, simply of their own nature: but only in respect of men's abusing
of them, for most commonly they peruerte the good use of them: For certainly,
the Tabor does not sooner sound to make men merry, but there is always
lightly some vanity, I say not supersticious, but beastly. For behodle men
are so carried away, as they cannot sport themselves with moderate mirth, but
they fling themselves into the air, as though they would leap out of
themselves. This then Job meant to note here a cursed mirth, and a mirth that
God condemned. Whereby we ought to take warning, to restrain our selves from
such loose and wanton pastimes, but let us rather advisedly restrain our
selves, and set God always before our eyes, to the end that he may bless
our mirth, and we so use his benefits, as we may never cease to travel up to
heaven ward. Thus you see it behooves us to apply all our mirth to this end,
namely, that there may be a melody founding in us, whereby the name of God
may be blessed and glorified in our Lord Jesus Christ, etc. Call. upon Job.
fol. 373.

Against Dancing used in these days.
As it is lawful to sing, and we use singing to give thanks unto God, and to
celebrate the praises, so also by a moderate dancing, we may testify the
joy and mirth of the mind. For David publikelie daunced before the Ark of the Lord, and the Maidens with daunces and songs, celebrated his victory
against Goliath. Maria also sister of Moses when Phar^o was o^erthrowen and
slain, led daunces with other women, and sung a song of victory. Wherefore
seeing holy men and chaft women used daunces, we cannot say that of their
own nature they be vicious. But as it is used in these days that men should
dance mingled together with women, ought not to be suffered, because that
those things are nourishments and prouokers of wantonness and lusts. Maria the
sister of Moses daunced not with young men, but apart by her self among women.
Neither David daunced with women: and maidens which celebrated his victory
daunced among themselves, and not with men. Per. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 286.

What Daunces are honest, and what evil.
Let us remember, that although honest Matrimonies, are sometimes brought to
pass by dancing, yet much more are adulteries and fornications wont to
follow of their spectacles. We ought to follow the examples of godly
fathers, who now and then used daunces, but yet such as were moderate and chaste,
so that the men daunced by themselves, and the women aparte by themselves: by
such kind of daunces they showed forth the gladness of their minds, they
sang praises unto God, and gave him thanks for some notable bene^ite, which
they had received. But we read not in holy Scripture of mingled daunces of men
and women together. But our men say: who can dance after that sort? In saying
so, they utter themselves, what they seek for in dancing. Pet. Mar. upon
Iudic. fol. 287.

Augustine Augustine
against Petilianus the 6. chapter. The Bishops (says he) were always wont to
restrain idle and wantonne dauncings. But now a days there are some Bishops
which are present at daunces, and do dance together with women, so far are
they off to restrain this vice. The same Augustine, upon the 32. Psalm. (when
he expounds these words of the Psalter, Of ten strings I will sing unto
thee) makes these ten strings the ten Commandments: and when he had spoken
somewhat of one of them, at last he comes to the Sabbath day. I say not
(says he) to live delicatelie, as the Jews were wont. For it is better to
dig all the whole day, then to dance on the Sabbath day. Pe. Mar. upon
Iudic. fo. 287.

Chrysostom Chrisosto^.
in his 56. Homely upon Genesis, when he entreats of the marriages of Jacob.
Ye have heard (says he) of marriages, but not of daunces, which he there
calls devilish: and he has many things in the same place on our side. And
among other he writes. The Bridegroom and the Bride are corrupted by
dancing, and the whole Family is defiled. Again in the 48. Homely: Thou
see (says he) marriages, but thou see no daunces, for at that time they
were not so lascivious, as they be now a days. And he has many things of the
14. chapter of Matthew, where he spoke unto the people of the dancing of the
Daughter of Herodias, and amongst other things he says: At this day
Christians do deliver to destruction not half their Kingdom, not another man's
head, but even their own souls. And he adds, that whereas is wanton
dancing, there the Devil daunceth together with them, etc. Pet. Mar. upon
Iudic. fol. 287.

Dancing taken in good part.
Thou have turned my mourning into dancing. Psa. 30. 11.
By the word Dancing, there is not meant every manner wantonness or Ruffianlie
leaping and frisking: but a sober and holy vtteraunce of gladness, such as
the holy Scripture makes mention of, when David conuaied the Arc of
Covenant into his place. Calvin.

What the Ethnikes opinion was of Dancing.
Aemilius Probus in ^he life of Epa^^^ ondas, says: that (...) sing and to
dance, was not very honorable among the Romans, when the Grecians had it in
great estimation. Salust^ in Cantilinario writes, that Sempronia a certain
lascivious and unchaste woman, was taught to sing and dance, more elegantlie
then became an honest matrone and there he calls these two things, the
instruments of leche^id. Cicero in his book of Offices writes, that an honest
and good man will not dance in the market place, although he might by that
means come to great possessions. And in his Oration which he made, after his
return into the Senate, he calls Aulus Oab^^us his enemy in reproth,
Sa(...)or Call(...)str^^us, that is, The fine Dauncer. It was objected to Lucius
Aurona for a fault, because he had daunced in Asia^ The same thing also was
objected unto y^ king Deiotarus. Cicero answers for Murena: No man daunceth
being sober, unless peradventure he be mad, neither in the wilderness,
neither yet at a moderate and honest banquet. The same Cicero in Philippi^^s
vpbraideth unto Autonie, among other^ his vices, Dancing. Pet. Mar. upon
Iudic. fol. 287.

DEACONS.
What the Deacons office was.
THe Deacons received the daily offerings of the faithful, and the yearly
reuenewe (...) of the Church, to bestow them upon true uses, that is to say,
to distribute them to feed partly the ministers, and partly the poor: but
by the appointment of the Bishop, to whom also they yearly rendered accounts
of their distribution. Calvin. in his. inst. 4. b. cha. 4. sect. 5.

Of the election of Deacons.
Ideo hoc non permiserunt sort, etc. The Apostles (says Chrysostom) did not
commit the election of Deacons to lottes, neither they being moved with the
spirit, did choose them, though they might have so done, for to appoint the
number, to ordeine them, and to such an use, they challenged as due unto
themselves. And yet do they permit y^ election of them to the people, lest they
should be thought to be partial or to do any thing for savor. D. W.

How Deacons may preach and baptize.
In the beginning of the 8. Chapter of the Acts, Saint Luke declares, that all
the Apostles did still remain at Jerusalem, wherefore it could not be Philip
the Apostle which was now at Jerusalem, but it must needs be Philip the
Deacon, that was dispearsed with the rest, and came to Samaria, where he now
preached and baptized. And of this judgment is Calvin, whose words upon the
place and Chapter be these S. Luke had before declared that the Apostles did
not step from Jerusalem, it is probable, that one of the 7. Deacons, whose
daughters did prophecy is here mentioned, etc. D. W.

Although (says Gualter Gualter^ opinion.
) it was the office of Deacons, to take charge of the common treasures of the
Church, and of the poor, yet was it heerewith permitted unto them to take the
office of preaching, if at any time necessity required, as we have hitherto
seen in the example of Stephen. And peradventure there was not so great need
of Deacons at Jerusalem, when the Church was through persecution dispearsed,
and therefore they which before were stewards of the Church goods, did give
themselves wholly to the ministry of the word.

Tertulian in his book de Baptismo has these words: Baptiz^^di, Tertuli^s
opinion
etc. The high Priest which is the Bishop^ has authority to baptize, so have
the Ministers, and Deacons, but not without the authority of the Bishop, for
the honor of ye Church.

Hierom aduersus Luciferianos, says thus: I do not deny, but that it is the
custom of the Church that the Bishop should gae to lay his hands by the
invocation of the holy spirit, which a ^arre off in little Cities, by
Ministers and Deacons were baptized. And a little after he says, Neither y^
Minister nor deacon have authority to baptize without y^ commandment of y^
Bishop.

Beza Beza. lib. con. ca. 5.
says that Deacons did oftentimes supply the office of Past ours, in the
administration of the Sacraments, and celebrating of marriage, and to pr^^e
this, he notes. 1. Cor. 14. 1^ and John. 4. 2. D. W. fol. 588.

DEAD.
To be Dead to the Law what it is.
Even so ye my brethren, Romans 7. 4.
are dead concerning the Law. To be dead concerning the Law is to be made free
from the Law, and from the burden thereof, and to receive the spirit, by which
we may do after the Law, and the same is to be delivered from the Law of
death. Tindale.

Are dead concerning the Law, by the body of Christ. Because the body of
Christ is made an offering and a Sacrifice for our sins, whereby God is
pleased, and his wrath appeased, and for Christ's sake the holy Ghost is given
to all believers, whereby the power of sin is in us daily weakened: we are
counted dead to the Law, for that the Law has no damnation over us. The
Bible note.

The Dead shall hear, how it is understood.
The Dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God. John. 5. 25.
Here he speaks of the resurrection of justification, whereby the wicked
arises from his wickedness, and whereby the sinner is brought from the death
of his sins, into the life of righteousness, and specially of the calling
of the Gentiles, which was done after the coming of the holy Ghost. For the
Gentiles are counted as dead men in comparison of the Jews. And afterward,
where he says, All that are in graves shall hear the voice of the Son of
man, etc. He means, the general resurrection, which shall be in the last
day. Tindale.

The Dead shall hear, etc. And who be those Dead? Surely no man can be
exempted, for where at beginning, God to make his doctrine available in us:
even at the drawing of us out of the spiritual death, wherein we were all
held, for till such time as God enlighteneth us by his word, we be blind:
till he open our ears, we be deaf: till he give us faith, we have neither
soul nor heart. True it is, that we may well seem to have some outward show
of life. The unbelievers doeate and drink as well as the faithful: again,
they can go about their business, yea and oftentimes there seems to be great
virtue in them, but all that is nothing, because that in as much as they be
strangers from God, all that is in them is but death and utter confusion. God
then must be feign to draw us out of death unto himself, as the point whereat
he must begin to make his word available in us, etc. Calvin upon Job. fol.
447.

How the Dead praise not God.
The Dead praise not thee O Lord. Psa. ^15. 17.
It is not meant that they do not praise him in their mind, but is meant, they
cannot tell his praise to other. Calvin.

The Dead praises not God for the benefits poured daily upon the earth for
them, as they that be alive do or ought to do. The Bible note.

Though the dead set forth Gods glory, yet he means here, that they praise
him not in his Church and Congregation. Geneua.

How this place following is understood.
Let the dead bury the dead. Luke. 9. 60
That is, Let Infidells alone with their infidelity, and follow thou me, that
is, believe thou in me, and go preach the Kingdom of God. Tindale.

We may not follow that which seems best to us, but only Gods calling.
And here by Dead, he means those that are unprofitable to serve God. Geneua.

To do good to them that be dead, what is meant thereby.
Do good, even to them that be dead. Gal. 7. 33.
To do good to them that be dead, is to bury their bodies with honor against
the day of resurrection: as did Abraham and Joseph, etc. To deal faithfully
and truly with their children committed to thy charge, as did David with the
children of his friend Jonathan. The Bible note.

Of the dead Israelites.
O Lord God almighty, Bar. 3. 4.
the God of Israel, hear now the prayers of the dead Israelites. Ye must
understand, that Baruch in his prayers speaks not of them that were dead with
bodily death, but of the wicked which living unto the world, were dead unto
God, which figurative manner of speaking, is oftentimes used in the Scripture.
For in the Gospel of our savior Jesus Christ, he says: Suffer the dead to
bury ye dead: as if he should say, let the worldlings that be d^ad unto God,
and good works, bury them that be departed out of this life, (for that is an
office most meet for them) but do thou the things that be for the living. The
like phrase or manner of speaking does the holy Apostle use, when he says, A
widow living in deliciousness, though she be alive, yet she is dead. Besides
this, Baruch by such kind of words, does set forth ye miserable estate of the
Children of Israel, which were even as dead men are in the world, because of
their captivity and thraldom, and straight bondage or slavery, that they
were in, which was unto them as a grave or pit, that the dead be buried in.
This is the true understanding of Baruch in this place.

How this place following is understood.
How shall we that are dead to sin, Romans 6. 2
live yet therein. They are said of Paul to be dead to sin, which are in
such sort made pertakers of the virtue of Christ, that the natural corruption
is dead in them, that is, the force of it is put out, and it brings not
forth his bitter fruits: and on the other side, they are said to live to
sin, which are in the flesh, that is, whom the spirit of God, has not
delivered from the stauerie of the corruption of nature. Beza.

Against the custom of giving the Lords supper, and Baptime over the Dead.
It has been also decreed and determinded, Cone. ter. Carthag.
that the Sacrament of thanksgiving should not be ministered unto the dead
bodies, for it is said of the Lord, Take and eat, but the dead corpses can
neither take nor eat: we must beware that our weak brethren do not believe
that, that it is lawful to baptize over the dead, unto whom it is not lawful
to minister the Sacrament of thanksgiving. This does sufficiently declare,
that both S. Austen and all other fathers ought to be understood, when they
speak of the prayers for the dead, and of the sacrifice that is offered for
them, for they are not of opinion that their prayers and oblations could help
the souls departed out of Purgatory, which began in Austens time to be only
in question he himself daring affirm nothing touching the same. I. Veron.

Whether the dead know what we do in this life.
As concerning that Job says, Job. 14. 21
that the men which is departed, knows not what is done here below, nor
whether his offspring be poor or rich, it is not to ground an Article of our
faith upon, that such as be gone out of this world, knows not what our state
is. For Job spoke as a man encombred. Therefore we must not take here any
certainty of doctrine neither is it greatly for us to enquire of such matters.
And why? Let it suffice us that God has set us in this world to communicate
one with another, and euory man ought to employ himself upon his neighbors
God has given me such a gift or ability, and therefore I must apply my self
y^ way. Again, one of us may pray for another, but when he has taken us
out of this world, the said communicating is taken away from us, and there is
no communicating as there was before. Neither must we do as the Papists do,
who are wont to run to the deceased Saints, as though they had not yet
finished their course. Now forasmuch as the Scripture teaches us not what we
ought to do in this behalf: let us leave that thing in doubt and in
suspense whereof we have no certain resolution, by the word of God: For
singleness of mind is also a thing, wherein it behooves us to walk. etc.
Calvin upon Job. fol. 265

DECEIT.
Look. Guile.

DEEDS.
Look. Works.

DEAF MAN.
By whose faith this deaf man was healed.
ANd they brought unto him, Mar. 7. 32
one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech, and they prayed him
to put his hand upon him. It seems by this man's healing, that a man may be
saved by another man's faith, for this man was healed by the faith of the men,
and not by his own, because he could not hear, for faith comes by hearing.
To this it may be said, there is a difference between corporal benefits and
everlasting salvation. But no man's faith can stand in steed for another,
touching salvation. Now Christ loosed the tongue of the deaf, and then being
called upon of him, he gave him faith, and so the dumb man, was healed by his
own faith.

DENIENG OF GOD.
How and when men do deny God.
ANd deny God, which is the only Lord, etc. Jude. ver. ^
Men truly deny God, when they ascribe their justification, or forgiveness of
sins, to any creature, or to any work, by the might and power of the
work, to any Indulgence or Pardon, to Masses, to holy Bread, to kissing of
Images and such like, and not to Christ Jesus, and to his blood shed for us, to
obtain us remission of sins, by whose blood only, we were washed from ^ur
sins, as S. John says Apoc. 1. 5. He has washed us in his own blood from
our sins. They deny the Lord, which ascribe remission of sins, to any
other thing, then unto Christ and his blood, which thing false Prophettes does,
denieng their Master. Bibliander.

DEEP.
What the Deep signifies.
OUt of the Deep call I unto thee O Lord, etc. By the Deep is understood the
adversity, wherein the people of Israel was, when they were scattered among
the Chaldes.

Unto us christen it signifies the adversity, trouble and misery, which
happens to us for our offenses and sins. T. M.

DESPERATION.
What an offense Desperation is.
SAint Hierom Hierom
affirms the offense of Judas to be greater in dispairing of the mercy of
God, then in betraieng Christ. And that Cain stirred God more to anger through
desperation of pardon, then by ye slaughter of his brothers blood. Many which
have persecuted Christ, being converted and believing in him, have obtained
pardon, and are made examples to man, that he ought not to distrust the
remission of his wickedness, seeing the death of our savior, is forgiven to the
penitent.

Let no man despair of Gods mercy and goodness.
Let him that is weak, and cannot do that he would feign do, not despair,
but turn to him that is strong and has promised to give strength to all that
ask of him in Christ's name, and complain to God, and desire him to fulfill
his promise, and to God cominit himself. And he shall of his mercy and truth
strengthen him, and make him feel with what love he is beloved for Christ's
sake, though he be never so weak. Tindale.

The means to keep us from Despair, in time of afflictions.
To know Gods righteousness, and to be fully persuaded of it, is a mean to
bring us to patience: Howbeit, that we must match another Article with it,
that is to wit, we must always think, that GOD in afflicting us, does not
cease to love us, yea that he will procure our salvation, what rigor soever he
use toward us, so as all our afflictions shall be assuaged through his grace,
and he will give them a gladsome end. Calvin upon Job. fol. 139.

DESTINY.
SAint Augustine in Opusculo. 82. questionum. quest. 45. Confuting soundly the
destinies of Planets, among other his reasons says: The conceiving of Twins
in the mothers womb because it is made in one and the same act, as the
Physicians testify (whose discipline is far more certain and manifest then
that of the Astrologers) does happen in so small a moment of time, that there is
not so much time as two minutes of a minute, betwixt the conceiving of the one
and the other.

How therefore comes it that in Twins of one burden, there is so great a
diversity of deeds, wills and chances, considering that they of necessity
must needs have one and the same Planet in their conception, and that the
Mathematicalls do give the constellation of them both, as it it were but of
one man. To these words of Saint Augustine (says Bullinger) great light may
be aded, if you annexe to them and examine narrowly the example of Esau and
Jacobs birth, and sundry dispositions. The same Augustine writing to Boniface
against two Epistles of the Pel^gians. li. 2. cap. 6. says: They which affirm
that Destiny does rule, will have not only our deeds and events, but also
our very wills to depend upon the placing of the stars, as the time wherein
every man is either conceived or borne, which placing they are wont to call
Constellations, but the grace of God does not only go above all stars and
heavens but also above the very Angels themselves. Bullinger. fol. 480.

Look. Astrology. Fortune. Chance.

DESTROY NOT.
The meaning of this place.
Destroy not. Or, Psa. 52. 1.
thou shall not destroy or make away (as some will). By this he signifies
after the mind of Kimhi, that he twice withstood and stilled his Soldiers,
which moved him to destroy and kill Saul. Ezra thinks it to be a certain
tune and manner of singing. T. M.

DEATH.
What Death is by the mind of Secundus the Philosopher.
WHen Adrian the Emperor had heard Secundus the Philosopher in the several
Oration he made of a noble Roman Matron, a kinswoman of the Emperors, he
asked of him what death was, to whom the philosopher answered thus: Death is an
eternal sleep, a dissolution of the body, a terror of the rich, a desire of
y^ poor, a thing inheritable, a pilgrimage uncertain, a thief of man, a
kind of sleeping, a separation of the living, a company of the dead, a
resolution of all, a rest of travails, an end of all idle desires. Finally,
death is y^ scourge of all evil, and the chief reward of the good.

We call death the loosing asunder and departing of two things, the soul from
the body: y^ which departing no man can escape, but necessarily die all we
must, that be borne in this world. When the body by any violence loses his
senses, and is spoiled from the quick use of his principal parts, the^^
departs the soul from him, and in manner the body leaves y^ soul, before
the soul leaves the body. For it is not y^ soul by himself y^ goes from
the body, but it is the body by himself sorsaking life, that causes the
soul to depart, etc. Lupset.

How the Devil has power of Death.
The Devil has y^ power of death, Heb. 2. 14.
that is ^he is the author of it, by his malicious nature he brought it into
the world: for God made it not, nor has any delight in it, neither is it
good in his eyes, nor was never mentioned among y^ works of his hands: but from
the Devil, and of the Devil, and in the Devil it began, and is, and videth.
And therefore in the Apocalips his name is given him, Abaddon, that is, the
destroier: and as death is of him, so for this cause also, he is said to have
the power of it, because through his manifest temptations, he makes men sin,
by which death reigns. etc. Deering.

Of everlasting death.
He shall never see death. John. 8. 51.
What else is the meaning of this which Christ says, he shall never see death,
but because he saw another death, from y^ which he came to deliver us. That is
to sai^ the second death, everlasting death; death of hell fire the death of
damnation with the Devil and his Angels, that is death indeed. Therefore
never to see death, is nothing else but to have everlasting life. So that we
may note and learn here that faith is the way to immortality, and that
Christians do truly live and never die, although in this world they be more
like to dead men then to living men, and to die in body by other men. For the
saying of Christ here is most true, to the which also agrees this place.
Every one which lives and beleeuth in me, shall never die. Marl. upon John.
fol. 329.

How this place following is understood.
Some there be standing here, Mat. 16. 28
shall not taste of death, til they shall see the Son of man come in his
kingdom. The same is to be understood of his glorious transfiguration, as if
he should say: there are some standing among you, which shall not die till
they have seen me in the same glory and majesty, that I shall come in, at
the last day of Judgment. Sir. I. Cheek.

This was fulfilled in his Resurrection, and was as an entry into his
kingdom, and was also confirmed by sending the Holy Ghost, whereby he wrought
so great and sundry miracles.

The meaning of this place following.
In, death there is no remembrance of thee. Psa. 6. 5.
His meaning is, that if he shall by Gods grace be delivered from death, he will
be thankful and mindful of it. And he bewaileth that this power shall be
^erefte him, if he should be taken out of this world because he should be no
more conversant among men, so set out the praise of God. But heerevpon do some
wrongly and vnskilfullie gather, that the dend are void of all sense, and that
there remains no perseverance at all in them, whereas (in this place) he
entreats of nothing else, but of the mutual praising of Gods grace, wherein
men exercise themselves, while they be alive. For we know, we are placed on
this earth to this purpose, th^^ we should with one consent and one mouth
praise GOD which thing is the end for which we live. Now ^hen, although that
death make an end of such praisings, yet does it not follow, that the
faithful souls which are loosened from their bodies are bereft of
understanding, or touched with no affection to God ward. Calvin. upon the 6.
Psalm.

He lamenteth that occasion should be taken from him, to praise God in the
Congregation. Geneua.

In what respect the children of God, may wish death.
O that God would begin to smite me, Job. 6. 9.
that he would let his hand go, and take me away. True it is, that Gods
children may well wish death, howbeit to another end, and for another respect
then Job does here, like as all of us must with S. Paul desire to be let
loose from the bondage of sin, wherein we be held prisoners. Saint Paul is
not moved there, with any temptation of his flesh, but rather the desire that
he has to imploie himself in Gods service without let, seems him to wish,
that he might pass out of the prison of his body. Why so? For so long as we
be in this world, we must be wrapped in many miseries, and we cease not to
offend God, being so weak as we be. S. Paul is then sorry, that he must live
so long in offending God, and this kind of desire is good and holy, and
proceeds of the holy Ghost. Call. upon Job. fol. 108.

Of four manner of deaths.
Beside the mortal and eternal death, be other two, the spiritual death and
the temporal death, which be not so well known, nor so soon espied of the
simple, as the natural and eternal death is. The spiritual death is, when
the body is yet living, the soul is dead, as the Apostles proves by the
widows that live at pleasure, 1. Tim. 5. 6.
being alive in body, and yet dead in soul. The temporal death is, when the
affections and lusts of the body, are so killed that the spirit may live,
whereof the Apostle speaks Col. 3. Col. 3. 5.
exhorting us to mortify our earthly members, and to kill all the strength of
our corrupt nature that strive against the spirit. For by obaieng our lusts,
at the first came death into the world, as it appears by Eve, when she eat
of the forbidden fruit. M. Luther.

How death is not to be feared. Example of a Panim.
I find that a learned Panim wrote, that we should neither care for life by it
self, nor yet for death by it self. He says that we should care to live
well and to die well, and let life and death pass without care: for life is
not good, but to live well is good. If Panims have this right consideration of
life and death, what shame is it for Christen men to care for death? Seeing
Christ whose words cannot but be true, so vehemently forbids us the same,
that Panims saw by reason to be done, etc. Lupset.

DEBT.
How debtes ought to be required, and how not.
ESaie Esaie. 58. 3
the Prophet seems to account it in the Jews a great fault to ask their
debt, saying: Et Omnes debitores repetitis. Ye challenge and charge all your
debtors, ye call all debts back again: Why, is it not lawful for a good
christen man to call for his debts. Yea and if need so require to sue for them
by the law? God forbid else, otherwise there could no good order, no policy,
no civility, nor Common wealth endure: If buyeng and selling, keeping of
contracts and covenants were not lawful, then all things should be common,
then we should live like lawless beasts, we needed no king, no maigistrate.
But ye must understand that in a case, charity will not suffer right, to call
for her debt. The case shall be this: My brother, my neighbor is burnt with
fire, is lamed of his limbs, is robbed of his sight, at one word, is so
oppressed with poverty, that he is not able to pay: In this case charity
will command justice to give place, and not to ask her debt, but rather to
give more of their own. The Jews were so hard hearted that they spared not,
forgave no debtors were they never so poor nor so pitiful. And therefore
Esaie lays it to their charge, Deuteronomy. 15. ^
saying: Omnes debitores vestros repetitis: Ye call upon al your debtors, as well
them that be in extreme need and unable to pay, as they that be wealthy and
able enough to pay. Beside this, the Jews had a certain civil law given
unto them by God, unto the which we now are not bound. The law was this:
Every seventh year, thou shall keep a free year, or a Iubelie year, which
shall be kept after this manner: If ought shall be owing to any man, either
from his friend, his neighbor, or his brother, he may not ask it again,
because it is the Lords free year, or the Lords Iubelie year. This year was
also called Sabbatum terrae: Moses saying unto the people on this wise: Sex
annos agrum tuum, etc. Six years thou shall sow thy land, and six years
thou shall cut thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof, but the seventh
year, shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land. The Lords sabbath it shall
be. The crop that the ground shall bring forth by her own kind, without thy
labor, that shall thou not reap: and the crop that shall grow by their own
kind, thou shall not gather, why? Shall they rotte upon the vines, and the
grass and the corn upon the ground? No not so, but the grass and the corn
thou shall reap, and the grapes thou shall not gather: Hoc est non tibi soli
ea coacernabis, neque repones federum tibi cum alijs commune. And unto this I
say in the seventh year, Non licet tibi debita exigere. Now all such debts
as were pardoned by Gods commandment, in consideration of the Iubelie year,
the covetous rich man the next year following would require all these debtes
of their poor neighbors, which they were bound upon writings made, which we
call Deed Obligatorie: now says Esaie: Dissolve Colligationes impiae, etc.
Cancel thy wicked Obligations: loose and undo the heavy burdens that
oppress thy neighbor, dispatch and let them go free, which are not able to
pay, etc. Ric. Turnar.

Of the debt the Lord forgave his servant.
The Lord forgave the servant his debt. Mat. 18. 27
By this it appears that salvation falls unto men by releasement of the
debt, and not for satisfieng of the debt: for relcasement and payment, cannot
stand in one respect togethers. It overthrows Popish satisfaction, which
(say they) must be done by pilgrimages, fasting, and alms deeds. It
quenches the fire of Purgatory, for where debt is forgiven, the debtor is not
to be punished.

DEVIL.
What the name Devil does signify.
Properly this name Devil, Apo. 12. 10
does signify a privy accuser and slaunderer, ^ausing infamy, and betraieng
men, according to the Etimologie or force of the same word. John says, the
accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God, day
and night. Marl. fol. 58.

In what respect the devil is evil.
Saint Augustine Augustine
in his book entitled De vera reli. chap. 13. says. The Devil in as much as
he is an Angel, is not evil. But in as much as he is perverse and wicked of
his will, for setting more by himself then by God, he would not be in subjection
unto him, but swelling through pride, he fell from his chief essence and
excellent being. And again in his treatise upon John. 42. Do thou demand
from whence the devil is? From thence doubtless from whence all the other
Angels are. But the other Angels constantly continued in their obedience, he
by disobedience and pride, fell from an Angel, and became a devil. Bullinger.
fol. 746.

How long the Devil has been a liar.
Christ says that the Devil has been a liar from the beginning. That is to
say, even from the time he was first a Devil, and not from the time he was
first made an Angel. And that when he does speak lies, he speaks that which
is his own. And therefore Christ adds unto it, that he did not abide still
in the truth: for he has nothing of God which is truth, but that which he now
has of evil, is of himself. P. Viret.

Who they be that offer to Devils.
Let them no more offer their offering unto devils. Leui. 17. 7
He offers unto devils, y^ offers unto any other thing then unto God, or
that does his offering after any other manner then God wills him to do, and
the same goes a whoring after Devils, as in Psalm. 73. 27. T. M.

How we must answer the Devil reasoning with us.
Thou art a sinner (says the devil) and therefore thou art dampened. Because
thou say I am a sinner, therefore will I be righteous and saved. Naie (says
the devil) thou shall be damned. No (say I) for I fly unto Christ, who has
himself suffered for my sins, therefore Satan thou shall nothing prevail
against me in y^ thou go about to terrify me in setting forth y^ greatness
of my sins, and so to bring me into heaviness, distrust, despair, hatred,
contempt, and blaspheming of God: yea rather by this that thou say, I am a
sinner, thou give me armor and weapon against thy self, that with thine
own swoorde I may cut thy throat, and tread thee under my feet: for Christ
dyed for sinners. Moreover thou thy self preachest unto me the glory of GOD.
For thou put me in mind of GODS fatherly love toward me wretched and
dampened sinner, who so loved the world, John. 5. 24.
that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him might
not perish but have everlasting life. Also as often as thou do object that I
am a sinner, so often thou call to my remembrance the benefit of Christ my
redeemer, upon whose shoulders, and not upon mine, lie all my sins: for the
Lord has laid all our iniquities upon him. Again, Esaie. ^3.
for the transgression of his people was he smitten: wherefore when thou
obiectest that I am a sinner, thou do not terifie me, but comfort me above
measure. Luther upon the Gal.

DEVOTION.
True devotion or pure religion, what it is.
TRue devotion, that is called in latin ( Pietas) is that which has annexed
therewith divine promises, for this present life to come, as witnesses Paul.
1. Tim. 4. 1. Tim. 4
which is nothing else but observation of Christ's law, that in the Psalm for
the pureness thereof is called silver fined often and many times through
fire: It has no chafe in it, Psalm. 12. 6.
as has men's traditions, but is pure and clean wheat? As shows Jeremy
writing thus: Iere. 23. 28
What is the chafe to the Wheat? Therefore behold, I will come against the
Prophet, says the Lord, that steal my word every one from his neighbor, and
deceive my people in their lies, and in their errors. And this devotion is
that which Saint James calls the pure religion of Christ, saying: Pure and
immaculate religion before God the father is, to visit fatherless children and
widows in their vexation. Whereby he means all needy people that are
succourlesse and helpless, without council or other means according to our
ability, whenever we see them in need or distress. Lambert in the book of
Mar. fol. 1266.

What the Papists call devotion.
What is it, that they call devotion? Every man's own lyking. As soon as a
man has a mind to any thing, by and by he bears him in hand, that God is
as much delighted therewith, as he himself is. And there is no man but he
undertakes some thing or other. Behold the overboldness that has always
reigned in the world, which is, that men will needs be master, and make laws
at their own pleasures, and GOD must be feign to accept whatsoever they have
forged after that manner. But contrariwse the holy Ghost tells us, that we
must not lift up one foot to go forward, but only in the way which God
shows us. Calvin upon Job. fol. 419.

From whom popish devotion sprung.
When men thought to serve God after their own fashion, and framed laws for
themselves, saying: This will be, and such a thing will be acceptable unto
God: it was because they would make him like unto themselves, as though he
delighted in all the small toys which they had invented: That is to wit,
outward things, and so doing, they transformed God, as though they would pull
him out of his heavenly seat, and draw him down hither, or as though he
were a creature, or a fleshlye thing. For then we see all these fond devotions
used in the papacy, and termed their divine service, sprang of this, namely
that they know not the highness of God, for then would they have concluded
thus: God is not delighted in the things which seems good in our own eyes,
for he is of an other nature then we be: he is a spirit, and therefore must we
serve him after a clean contrary fashion unto that which pleases our nature:
neither must we in this case attempt any thing of our own heads: but have
his law, in which he has declared his will unto us. He has prescribed us
our rule, let us hold us to that. This is the sobriety which God requires by
his word, and whereunto he would have us to submit our selves without
swaruing any thing at all therefrom. Calvin upon Job. fol. 399.

DIFFERENCE.
To make difference of the Lords body, what it is.
WHo so eats and drinks unworthily, 1. Co. 1. 27
he eats and drinks his own damnation, making no difference of the Lords
body. To make no difference of the Lords body, is unworthily to eat the
Lords bread, and to drink of his cup, etc. Saint Austen in his 26. treatise
upon John, says: The Apostle speaks of those which received the Lords
body without difference and carelessly, as if it had been any other kind of
meat whatsoever. Here therefore, if he be reproved which makes no difference
of the Lords body, that is to say, does not discern the Lords body from
other meats, how then should not Judas be dampened, who came to the Lords
table, feining that he was a friend, but was an enemy. Bullinger. fol. 1108.

DISOBEDIENCE.
Examples thereof out of Scripture.
Through Adams disobedience we were all made sinners, Genesis 3. 6.
and subject to death.

As by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, The remedies thorough
Christ.
so by the obedience of one, shall many be made righteous. Romans 5. 19.

For as by Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1. Co. 15.
22
Christ rose first from the dead to take possession in our flesh for us his
members. And where he says, all shall be made alive, he means the faithful.

DIVORCEMENT.
How and wherefore married folk may be divorced.
THe same authority has the woman to put away the man, that the man has to
put away the woman. Mar. 10. 11. 12. Christ says, there is no lawful cause
to dissolve matrimony, but adultery. For when the woman gives the use of her
body to an other man, she is no more her first husbands wife, nor the
husband no longer the husband of his wife, then he observe the faith of
matrimony with her. Wheresoever the fault happen and can be proved by certain
signs and lawful testimonies: the persons may by the authority of Gods word
and ministry of the magistrates, be separated so one from the other, that it
shall be lawful for the man to marry an other wife, and the wife to marry an
other husband. And Christ says. Math. 5. 32. and. 19. 9. So that a man shall
not need to keep at home with him a woman, that is no more his, then an other
man's, neither the woman such an husband, as is no more hirs then an other
woman's. Mar. 10. 11. 12. Saint Paul. 1. Cor. 7. 12. shows an other cause of
diuorcement, when one of the persons being married, is an Infidel, and of a
contrary faith. If this person will not dwell with the other that is his
fellow in matrimony and a christen man, it is lawful to break the faith of
matrimony and marry with an other. So says Saint Ambrose writing in the
place of S. Paul. Non debetur reuerencia, etc. The reverence of matrimony is
not due unto him y^ contemns the author of matrimony. And in y^ same place
the contempt of God, breketh y^ right of matrimony, concerning him y^ is
forsaken, least he should be accursed being married to an other. Thus thou
see that the Lord, Man. 5. and 19. gives license for adultery, to divorce
and marry again, and Saint Paul for infidelity. Whooper.

Christ speaks expreslie of the man, that he may for fornication put away
his wife: but he shows not whether the woman may leave her husband, if he
commit whooredome: the reason is, because he does only answer unto that was
demanded of him. But if a general question be moved on this behalf, there is
a common and a mutual right of either part, even as there is a mutual knotte
of faith and promise: otherwise the husband is the head of the wife, and the
wife in subjection to her husband. But as far forth as pertains unto
chastity of matrimony, and to the faithfulness of the bed, the like law is
prescribed unto the wife. The man says Saint Paul, has no power over his
own body, but the wife: neither has the woman power of her own body, but
the man. There is like liberty therefore if the husband or wife do violate
the promise of the bed, the chaste wife may forsake her husband, if he be a
fornicatour, as well as the husband may put away his wife, if she have played
the whore. Marl. fol. 420.

It is said, Mat. 5. 31.
whosoever puts away his wife, let him give her a letter of diuorcement.
These words do perteine to the law of eschewing adultery, and do teach that
truly and vndefiledly we ought to keep the faith of wedlock. For even as
the Jews thought that they behaved themselves falsely and amiss before God,
if they keep not the law after a politic order. Even so again, whatsoever
the politic or moral law did not prohibit, they fondly imagined that it
was at their pleasure. Moses in respect of the external order, did not forbid
the diuorsements with their wives (which were wo^t to be observed) but only to
take away the occasion of lust, for it was a certain testimony of
man^mission of free liberty, that ever after the woman might be free from the
bondage and power of the man: and also the man by the same, did acknowledge and
confess, that he did not put away his wife for any crime or fault, but
because the did not please him. Marl. fol. 101.

How the Bill of diuorcement was made.
Some write that the Bill of Diuorcement mentioned in the fifth of Mathewe, was
made after this form following, as should appear by a copy taken out of the
law of the Hebrews.

This Bill made the 29. Bill of diuorceme^t
day of June in the year of the creation of the world 5030. witnesses that I
H. K. the son of W. K. dwelling in the city of London, have well advised my
self, no man constraining me, and have dimist, and set at liberty, and left
thee A. K. to thy self, which have been heretofore my wife, and now having
dimist thee, and set thee free, I give the leave to do what thou will, and to
go and give thy self to wife, to whom so ever it shall please thee. In witness
whereof I give unto thee this Bill of diuorcement and dimissorie Epistle, being
an instrument of liberty according to y^ law of Moses. Marl. fol. 102.

Why the Jews were suffered to be divorced.
The Jews were suffered by the law (for their weakness sake) to be divorced
from their wives (giving them a Testimonial in their hands) to avoid a
further inconvenience, y^ was, least when they were moved or angry with them,
they would either have poisoned or killed them.

The meaning of these places following.
Whosoever marries her, Luk 16. 18
that is put away from her husband, commits adultery. They that gather by
this place that a man cannot be married again after he has put away his
wife for adultery while she lives, reason fondly. For Christ speaks of
these diuorses which the Jews used, of which sort we cannot take the
diuorcement for adultery, for adulterers were put to death by the law.

Let not man therefore put a sunder that which God has coupled together. Mat.
19. 6
He that puts away his wife for adultery or fornication, does not put
asunder that which God has coupled: for it is GOD himself (which commands
such to be stoned to death) that does separate them.

Where is the Bill of your mothers diuorcement, etc. Esaias. 50. ^
God was not the cause why the congregation of the Jews (which is understood
by mother, and was once his spouse) was divorced and forsaken, but their own
offense divorced them, and was the cause why they were sold to the usurer, etc
given over into the hands of the Gentiles or heathen, and sparkled among the
Medians, Persians, Babilonians, Grecians, and Romane^s. T. M.

DO.
Whatsoever God wills to do, is well done.
THou shall not do that which is good in thine own eyes, but do that only
which I command thee. Upon this place Saint John Chrysostom in his Oration
against the Jews, says thus: Of a truth that which is done according to the
will of God, although it seem to be wicked: yet it is altogether pleasant and
acceptable before God. Contrariwise, whatsoever is done beside the word of GOD,
and otherwise then he will have it done, though it be as a thing acceptable to
God, yet it is of all other the worst and most wicked. D. Wilson in his book
against usury. fol. 182.

How the doers of the law are justified.
For before God they are not righteous which hear the law, Romans 2. 13
but the doers of the law shall be justified. That is, shall be pronounced
just and righteous. This sentence is only spoken to the rebuke of the Jews,
setting no small store by themselves in that behalf of the law, which yet
they kept not. This thing lays Paul to their charge on this wise: It is not
enough for thee, O thou Jew, to hear the law only, and to be a professor
thereof and a leaner unto it, but if thou will needs be justified and made
righteous in the sight of God by the law, as thou so greatly crakest, then
must thou keep the law, not only hear it, now, that do thou not, out
art guilty of the breaking of it, and therefore must thou have an other way
to become righteous in the sight of God, then by the keeping of the law, which
is as this whole Epistle does after and before plainly prove, faith, that
fastlie believes sins to be forgiven freely by Christ, not for our works
or deseruinges, no not when we have done the best y^ we can. And to this
purpose does Saint Ambrose writing on this self text, expound Paul, saying:
Not they are righteous which hear the law, but which believe in Christ, whom
the law promised, affirming plainly, that to believe in him, is to do the
law. Tindale.

The Apostle in this place goes about to rifell the foolishness of the Jews,
which supposed that the hearing and understanding of the law was sufficient to
the accomplishing of the same, although they in no part fulfilled it, which
Saint Paul here confuteth, as though he would say unto them: You brag that
you are justified by the law, where in no part ye do fulfill the law, but
bragging of a little superficial understanding of the law, persuade your
selves straight, that you do fulfill the law, as though the accomplishing of
the law consisted in knowledge and under standing, and not in fulfilling: but
herein you are deceived, for not the hears but the dooers of the law are
instified. And because none fully accomplisheth the law so absolutely as Gods
justice requires therefore our justification comes not by the law (where of
the Jews brag^^d) Romans 10. and therefore in the same Chapter the Apostle
concludes thus: Nam perfecto, etc. for Christ is the fulfilling of the law, to
justify all that believe. ^. Gough.

So that ye be dooers of the word, James. 1. 22
and not hearers only, deceiving your selves. For if (...) h^are the word,
and declares not the same by his works, he is like unto a man^ beholding his
bodily face in a glass, and so forth. For there are diverse men at this day
and has been always, which think that religion consists in often hearing
the word of God, and in disputing the same at common meeting: but our Lord
Jesus Christ pronounces (in Matthew, where he says: Whosoever therefore
hears of me these words and does them) that true piety does not consist in
knowledge and talking, but in the action and conversation Marl. fol. 148.

DOCTOVRS.
How far the Doctors ought to be believed.
WE ought to indulge or bring in nothing of our own head, Tertulian
neither to choose that which any man has brought in of his own head, or of
his own brain, we have the Apostles for our authors, which did not choose of
their own brains what they should bring in, but did faithfully assign and
deliver unto nations, that which they received of the Lord. Therefore if an
Angel from heaven should preach any other Gospel unto us, we would
pronounce it to be accursed.

That which has no authority out of the Scriptures, Hierome.
or by the Scriptures, may as easily be contemned, as it is proved.

We do by good right condemn all new things y^ Christ has not taught,
Ambrose.
for Christ is the way unto the faithful. If Christ therefore has not that
which we do teach, we do also judge it execrable. Ambrose de vir. li. 4.

The discussing of our judgment, Origin.
must be taken only of the Scripture.

We have need to bring the Scripture for witness, Origin in Hierome homil. 1.
for our meaning and expositions without these witnesses have no credit.

My consent without exception I owe not to any Father, Aug. de na. and gra.
chap. 61.
were he never so well learned, but only to the canonical scriptures. His
reason is this: for whereas the Lord has not spoken, who of us can say it is
this or that? Or if he dare say so, how can he prove it?

I require the voice of the Shepherd, Augustine
read me this matter out of ye Prophets, read it me out of ye Psalms, read it
me out of the Law, read it out of the Gospel, read it out of the Apostles.
August. in John. Tract. 94.

Neither ought we to take the dispensations of all men, Augustine
how catholic so ever or commendable so ever they be, as the canonical
Scriptures: as though we may not (save the reverence that is due unto such
men) improve or refuse any thing of their writings, if we find they meant
otherwise then the truth does allow, being by the help of God found by us, or
by other. August. in Epist. ad Fortuna.

I am not moved with the authority of this Epistle. Augustine
For I do not take the letters of Ciprian, as the canonical Scriptures, but I
do try his writings by the canonical Scriptures, and whatsoever in them do
agree with the authority of the holy Scriptures, I do receive it with his
commendation, and whatsoever does not agree with Gods word, I do by his good
leave refuse it. August. con. Cresigramacion. li. 2. cap. 32.

Trust not me (says S. Austen) nor credit my writings as if they were ye
canonical Sciptures, Augustine
but whatsoever thou findest^ in the word, although thou did not believe it
before, yet ground thy faith on it now, and whatsoever thou read of mine,
unless, thou know it certeinlie to be true, give thou no certain assent unto
it. August. prol. li. 3. de Trini. Tom. 3.

We must be pertakers of other men's saiengs wholly after the manner of Bees, S.
Basile
for they fly not a like to all flowers: nor where they sit, they crop them
not quite away, but snatching so much as shall suffice for their hon^e^
making, take their l^aue of the rest. Even so we if wa^ves wise, having got
of other so much as is sound and agre^able unto truth, will leap over the
rest, which rule if we keep^, in reading and alleging the Fathers words, we
shall not sw^rue from our profession, the Scripture shall have the sovereign
place, and yet the Doctors of the Church shall loose no pa^te of their due
estimation.

Saint Austen to Saint Hierome, Aug ad Hierome Epist. 19.
says on this wise: I reckon not my brother, that ye would have us, so to
read your books, as if they were written by the Apostles or Prophets.

DOEG.
How Doeg was a figure of Antichrist.
DOeg was a wi^ked ^o^etous man, 1. Re. 21. 7
the keeper of king Saules Mules, who to the satisfieng of his
co^et(...)isnesse, gave himself to flattery, and to serve the kings turn in
all things, were it right or wrong, insomuch that when he had falsely accused
(...) that good and godly Priest unto the king, he at the k(...)es
commandment (all other re^using that wicked deed) fell upon A(...)melech
with the swoorde, 1. Reg. 22 9. 18
and slew both him and all the Priests of the Lord, to the number of 85. All
such cruel and covetous men, (although sometime they will appear holy as
Doeg did, which went to the Eabernacle of common place of prayer, and was there
occupied, as though he had been an holy man) may be called Doegs. Doeg by
interpretation and turning of his name into Latin, signifies, Commot^^, in
English ^ehementlye moved. By whom, says Saint Austen is signified Antichrist,
Augustine
which with fal^e signs and fained miracles, shall move all the world, before
the coming of the Lord into judgment. And as Doeg wrought wickedness for the
pleasing of king Saul, by whom is signified the Devil, so shall Antichrist
move and stir the world to s^nne, for the pleasing of the devil, and
aduauncing of his kingdom.

DOGS.
Who they be, and what is signified thereby.
A Dog is counted a vile beast, Deu. 23. 18
and so vile, that in the old law it was forbidden to offer the price, the
gain, or the ^auntage, that was got by the selling of a dog to the building or
repairing of the Tabernacle of the Lord. And because dogs be great raueners,
malicious and envious beasts, therefore the Scribes, Pharesies and high Priests
of Moses law, in persecuting of Christ, were called dogs. Ric. Turnar.

Give not that holy things unto dogs, Math. 7. 6
etc. The dogs are those obstinate and indurate, which for the blind zeal
of their leaven, wherewith they have sowred, both the doctrine and also the
works, maliciously resist the truth, and persecute the ministers thereof, and
are those wolves among which Christ sends his sheep, warning them not only
to be single and pure in their doctrine, but also wise and circumspect, and to
beware of men, for they should bring them before Judges and kings and slaie
them, thinking to do God service therein: That is as Paul to the Romans
testifies of the Jews, for blind zeal to their own false fained
righteousness, persecute the righteousness of God. Tindale. fol. 238.

Declare not the Gospel to the wicked contemners of God, whom thou see left
to themselves and forsaken. Geneua.

This holy thing is Gods word. Dogs are they that persecute the word.
Tindale.

The meaning of these places following.
For dogs are come about me. By dogs are understood the tyranny and the
cruelty of the Jews toward Christ. Like dogs are they at all times, which
Iewishlie and heinouslie persecute the members of Christ, that is, the
faithful. T. M.

A quick dog is better then a dead Lion. This Proverb, is the saying of the
Epicures, the which believes not the immortality of the soul. The Bible note.

He notes the Epicure and carnal man, which made their belly their God, and
had no pleasure but in this life, wishing rather to be an abject and vile
person in this life, then a man of authority, and so to die, which is meant by
the Dog and Lion. Geneua.

Beware of Dogs, etc. Ph^l. 3. 2.
Beware of Dogs which bark against the truth to fill their bellies. Geneua.

DOMES DAY.

DOOR.
An exposition of these places following.
I Have set a door open before thee. Apoc. 3. 8.
Paul glories that a door was open unto him. 2. Cor. 2. 12. that is to say,
that occasion was given him by God, whereby to enter into the hearts of the
heathen by the word of the Gospel. In this wise must this present place be
taken: namely, y^ Christ had opened a way, whereby the Church of Philodelphia
might allure other churches to the faith of Christ, by her own example, how
much so ever their adversaries brabled against them, whether they were Jews or
Gentiles, or false Apostles. And therefore by saying, and no man can shut it,
his meaning is this: namely, no man shall be able to ^et you, but that you
shall prefer my Gospel to many. So at this day there is a great door set
open unto Gods servant, while the Antichrists and persecutors burst a sunder:
that is to say, the way is opened for them, to enlarge the bounds of Christ's
kingdom by preaching his word, and to beat down the gross errors of
ungodliness by the brightness of the Gospel. Because that when God
determines to enlarge the borders at Christ's Kingdom, there is no power so
high that is able to let it. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 61.

For so much therefore as I find thee thus grounded in faith, be thou
certain and sure of it, I have set before thee an open door, I have
illumined thy senses, and cleared thy understanding to know the holy
Scriptures, and perceive the high mysteries written therein, so admitting thee
(...) my Kingdom. And this door can no man (...) again. Neither shall the
power of this world, nor (...) the gates of ^ell, be able to prevail against
this opening. Bale.

And when the doors were shut. John. 20. 19
In this place the Evangelist does diligently note the time that Christ our
Savior came in to his disciples, not meaning that he went in through the
doors, for the Greek has not Dias^roon Kekleismenoon, that is to say,
through the doors being shut, but Toonsnroon Kekleismenoon, that is to
say, The Gates or Doors being, as a man might say: late in the evening, and
at that time that the Gates and Doors be wont to be shut. Or else could not
Christ our savior, through his divine power cause the doors (were they never
so surely shut to open unto him of their own accord, as when he delivered
Peter out of prison by his Angel, then not only the chemes that he was bound
withal, f^ll off from him, but also all the doors and locks did open of their
own selves, and did give him passage. Act. 12. 7. Again, how the Apostles
were deliuered^ Read. Act. 5. 19. Sir ^. Cheek.

Whereas some think that doors were opened for him, that he might enter in
according to the manner of men, it disagreeth much with the mind of the
Evangelist. Therefore we must not think that Christ entered in without
miracle, to the end he might declare his divine power to make his Disciples
the more attentive. Nevertheless that is most false which the Papists do
affirm, as that Christ's body pearc^d the doors which were shut: This they
therefore affirm, that they might make his glorified body, not only like
unto a spirit, but also so incomprehensible, that no place can co^rein the
same. But the words of the Evangelist sound no such thing: because he said
not that he entered through the doors that were shut, but that he stood
sodeinlie in the midst of his disciples when the doors were shut: we know
that Peter came forth of the fast barred prison, shall we therefore say that
he pearsed through the midst of the iron Gates? This were too absurd and
childish. Let us content our selves with this, that Christ purposed by a
notable miracle to confirm the Apostles in the faith of his resurrection.
Marl. upon John. fol. 594.

So that no man opened him the doors, but he by his diuinepower, caused them
to open of their own accord. As of Peter is read. Act. 5. 19. and 12. 10.
Geneua.

DOSITHEANS.
What manner of men they were.
THe Dositheans were such as in diverse Ceremonies severed themselves from the
Jews, some of them would marry, yet live and continue Uirgins: They fasted
from all living creatures. They began of Dositheus. Who showing his followers
an example of fasting, famished himself to death, and thereby proved himself
a fool. ^pipha. li. 1. tom. 1. haeres. 1^.

DOVBTING.
Of the doubting of Abraham and other holy persons.
WHether Abraham any thing doubted, when God promised to him a child, the
Scripture seems to leave in suspense. For in the 12. of Genesis, it is
written that he laughed and said: Shall a child be borne unto me of an hundred
years of age? And shall Sara bring forth a child being 90 years of age? I
would to God Ismael might live in thy sight. These words have a show both of
joy and admiration being joined notwithstanding with some doubting. And this
Scripture therefore makes mention of these things, y^ the faith of Abraham
which is so highly commended, should in no wise be thought to have been without
doubting, which are accustomed to spring of the flesh and humane sense: but
because the faith of the Patriarch overcame those doubtings, therefore it is
praised. Neither do we read there, that Abraham was accused of incredulity as
Sara was, which also laughed. And if a man weigh the outwa^d laughter, they
were both alike. But God which is the searcher of the hearts, understood right
well the faith of either of them. Holy men, although they believed the
promises of God, yet sometime through humane weakness, they somewhat doubted,
and therefore it came to pass oftentimes, that they required signs and
miracles to confirm their weakness, which thing we read in Gedeon and
Ezechias the King. But in this place is showed a remedy against such
temptations, namely to call back our thoughts from humane lets, and to fix
our eyes only upon the power of God. Of this thing the Angel admonished the
blessed Uirgin saying: No word is impossible with God, although it appeared not
by the words of the Uirgin that she doubted, but only asked how that should
come to pass: for she doubted not, but as the Angel had told her she should
conceive, and that straight way: but because she saw, that she was not as yet
coupled in Matrimony, although she were betrouthed, she demanded how that
should come to pass. Therefore the Angel in his answer comprehended two
principal points. The one is, whereby he removed away doubting, if
peradventure there stuck any thing in the mind of the Uirgin. For he said,
No word is impossible with God. The second is of the manner of conceiving, The
Holy ghost (says he) shall come upon thee, and the power of the most highest
shall shaddowe thee. But whereas some feign, that she asked this, because she
had vowed virginity to God, it needs no long confutation, especially seeing
we are by the History it self taught, that she was betrothed to a man,
neither was there at that time any such custom to vow Uirginitie. Pet. Mar.
upon the Romans fol. 96.

DRAGMA.
What Dragma is.
A Dragma is the fourth part of a Sickle, which is to say five half pence,
for a Sickle is twenty half pence.

DRAGON.
Wherefore the King of Egypt is called a Dragon.
I Will upon thee, thou Dragon. Ez^. 29. 3.
The property of Dragons is to haunt, where abundance of waters are. Therefore
is the King of Egypt here called a Dragon, because of the abundaunce of water
that are in Egypt, where he reigned. So is Jerusalem called a Stews because
of her haunting of Idolatry. As in the 16. T. M.

He compares Pharao to a Dragon, which hides himself in the river Nilus. As
Esaias. 51. 9. Geneua.

The meaning of this place following.
Thou have covered us in the place of Dragons, and covered us with the shaddowe
of death. That is, thou have condemned us to the place of Dragons or Serpents,
or thou have driven us into the place of Dragons or Serpents. By the place of
Serpents is understood their bondage among the Heathen, which in cruelty, are
like to Dragons or Serpents. The same calls he the shadow of death, for it is
worse then death, and more to be feared, to be put in all thing to the
arbitriment, and pleasure of the ungodly, to hear continually ye name of God
blasphemed, and all godliness despised, and all manner of injuries and wrongs
done to the favorers thereof. Therefore says he, thou have covered us with
the shaddowe of death, that is, with the very darkness of death. T. M.

Who be the Dragons Angels.
And the Dragon and his Angels fought, Apoc. 12. 7
etc. The Angels whose force the Dragon uses against Michael, are the great
men, wise men, and wealthy men of the world: whose puissaunce, policy and
riches, are the weapons that he fights with, for the maintenance of his
kingdom and honor, which he has usurped wrongfullie, with him we must also
encounter, howbeit with spiritual armor from God, according as the Apostle
says. 2. Cor. 10. 4. Ephe. 6. 13. Marl. upon the Apo. fol. 174.

Who be the Dragon, beast, and the false Prophet.
Out of the mouth of the Dragon, Apo. 16. 1^
beast and false Prophet. There be that think the Dragon, the Beast and the
false Prophet to be all one. But we may fitly understand by the Dragon, Satan
himself the Father of lies. By the Beast, Antichrist and all his body: and by
the false Prophet all manner of false teachers of Antichrists kingdom. Marl.

DRAVVING.
The meaning of these places following.
NO man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me, John. 6. 44
draw him. To be drawn of ye father, is to be endued with faith and with ye
Holy ghost, by which our hearts are sealed and confirmed toward Christ. For ye
father gives faith to who^ he will: and on whom he will he has mercy, and
whom he will also, he makes hard hearted. It is no violent manner of drawing
which draws a man with external haling and pulling, of the which our Savior
speaks here: and yet notwithstanding the motion of the Holy ghost is so
effectual, that it makes men willing in despite of flesh and blood. Wherefore
that is false and profane which some say, that no man is drawn against his
will: as though a man were obedient to God by his own motion and will. For in
that men willingly obaie God, it comes of him who frames their hearts to
his obedience. Therefore man's free will is nothing. Marl. upon John. fol. 218.

I will draw all men to me. Job. 12. 32
In that our Savior speaks here so generally, that by his death he will
draw all men unto him, it is to be referred to the Sons of God, which are of
the flock. Also he used this general speech, because the Church of God was to
be gathered out of the Gentiles, and also out of the Jews, according to this
place: There shall be one Shepherd, and one Sheepefold. Mar. fol. 441.

Look. Father.

DREAMS.
How it is hard to discern Dreams.
SAint Austen demands, by what means the reuealations of evil and good
spirits, may be discerned one from another, and he answers that that cannot
be done, except a man have the gift of discerning of spirits, but he add^th
that an evil spirit, does always at the last, lead men to wicked opinions,
and perverse manners: although at the beginning, the difference cannot be
known, without the gift of the Holy Ghost. In his Epistle to E^odius, which
is the hundred Epistle, inquiring of the same matter, he says: I would to God
I could discern between Dreams which are given to error, and those which
are to salvation, nevertheless we ought to be of good cheer, because God
suffers his Children to be tempted, but not to perish. Pet. M(...). upon
Iudic. ^ol. 137.

Of Dreams natural and supernatural.
Supernatural sleeps or Dreams, do come of God from above by good Angels,
by the which God (...) his will to whom it pleases him. And w^ understand
th(...) those (...)de (...) Dreams, do much differ from those that be
natural, because they are of more certainty, and sealed and confirmed from
above, so that the verity of the same, cannot be ambiguous or doubtful. The
Dreams which commonly happen unto men, are wont to come of continnuall
cogitations and thoughts of the mind, or of the course of Nature, or of the
distemperaunce of the body, or of such like causes. But to the divine Dreams,
comes the testimony of the spirit, which witnesses for a surety, that it
is God that speaks. As of the Ladder of Jacob, which we read that he saw in
a vision or Dream. Marl. fol. 13.

DRUNKENNESS.
What Drunkenness is, after the mind of Seneca.
SEneca Seneca
says in his 84. Epistle: Drunkenness is nothing else, but a voluntary
madness. And straight ways after, The quality of Drunkenness, continuing
many days, is furiousness.

Plato in his 7. book De legibus toward the end, Plat^
writes that Minos in his Laws, prohibited the Cretenses, that they should
not drink togethers to Drunkenness. Again, in his 16. Dialogue De iusto at
the beginning: A dronken man (says he) has a tyrannical heart, for he would
rule all men as he lust, and not by any reason or law. Also, he writing in
his. 3. book De repub. says: that Drunkenness may be suffered in any man,
rather then in a Magistrate: for a dronken man, knows not the ground whereon
he is on. If a Magistrate Magistrate
be drunk, then has the keeper need of a keeper^ This is moreover to be
added, that there is nothing kept secret, where Drunkenness reigns.

How Drunkenness is condemned by holy Scripture.
Paul says, Be ye not made dronken with wine, Ephe. 5. 1^
wherein is wantonness. But be ye filled with the spirit, speaking to your
selves, by Psalms Hymns, and spiritual songs. Upon which place ^ierom says,
we cannot at one time be filled with wine and the Holy ghost, for the Apostle
puts these things as contraries even as we cannot serve two masters. He that
is filled with the spirit, has wisdom, meekness, shamefastness, and
chas(...)cie: and he which is filled with wine, has foolishness,
furiousness, malipartnesse, and filthy lusts. They which are not ^illed with
wine, can easelie sing Psalms, Hymns and spiritual songs, which thing they
cannot do, which have gorged themselves with wine. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol.
162.

Propl^ne examples of Drunkenness.
Alexander Alexander.
of Macedoni^, the Conqueror of the world, was most filthelie overcome with
wine, and being drunk, slew Clitus his friend most valiant and faithful,
whose diligence, industry, labor, prudence and strength he had in wars long
time used, to his great commodity. Wherefore, when he had slept after his
wine, and being awaked, and remembering the wicked act that he had committed, he
was so ashamed and sorry, that he wished himself dead. But yet he amended not
the vice of drunkenness. Yea once afterward he drunk so much wine in one
night that he fell into a Fever, and for that he would not temper himself from
wine, within a while after he died. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 163.

King Philip, King Philip
father to Alexander ye great, was a noble Prince and fortunate, yet
notwithstanding y^ vice of drunkenness reigned too much in him, wherefore it
followed, that after he had given judgment upon a time against a poor widow
woman, she answered straight, she appealed. The Nobles then present, hearing
the woman what she said, demanded to whom she appealed, since the king
himself had given sentence. She answered and said, I appeal to King Philip,
which is now dronk: that when he is sober, he return and give sentence. The
woman was nothing deceived in her appela^ion, for after king Philip had reposed
and slept a little, he re^oked and repea^ed that sentence that he had before
given against her.

This Cambices Cambices
the son of Cyr^s, had a Counsalour about him named Prexaspes, and because he
admonished the King somewhat boldly of his drunkenness, he commanded
Prexaspes to bring his youngest son unto him, for I quod he will shoot at
him with my bow. And if I hit his heart with my dart, then may thou think
that I am not beside the capacity of reason, but if not, then may it
worthelie be said, I am drunk, and so the child being bound to a post, the
king after he had well drunk shot at the child with his dart, and pierced him
through the heart, which being ripped, he showed to Prexaspes the childs father,
saying: here thou have good evidence that I am not dronk, for the heart is
rightly hit. Carrion.

A good woman had an husband, who would be oftentimes dronken, wherewith she
being ashamed, and devising by what means she might cause him to leave that
horrible vice, at the last, when he was asleep, she carried him unto ye Charnel
Charnell.
house wherein were put the bones of dead men, and leaving him lieng there, she
made ^ast the door and departed, and when she thought he was waking she taking
with her bread and meat, returned to the Charnell house, and knocked at the
door: her husband faintlie asked, who knocked there. The good woman answered,
I: which have brought meat with me, for the dead men: Peace quod her husband^
thou increasest my pain, in speking of meat, bring me some drink I pray
thee: that hearing the good woman, Alas said she that ever I was borne, for
this vice gotten by custom, my husband has made it an habit, which will
never forsake him.

^xamples of Drunkenness out of the Scripture.
Noe a great man, just and loved of God, Noe.
who saw two constitutions of the world (for he lived both before and after ye
flood) is set forth unto us as an example utterly to avoid Drunkenness. When
as he having drunk more wine then was meet, lay in the Tabernacle most
filthelie naked, and his privy parts which were wont to be covered, he left
bare and uncovered: and he that was wont to be a Master of virtues was a great
offense unto his children. Ch^m, mocked him: the other two sons of a better
and holier nature, were sorry and very much ashamed of their fathers
filthiness. By this act it is sufficiently declared, that shame, derision and
offense, follow Drunkenness. But of this sin we have a notable example in
Lot, Lot.
who undoubtedly drank not immoderatelie, to the end he would abuse his
Daughters, and to commit incest, but to put away care and griefs which he had
taken for the overthrow of the 5 cities, for the loss of his dear wife, and
also of his substance. He would also comfort his daughters, that they should
not take too much thought, specially ^or the loss of their mother: although
he ought to have invented other ways of comforting. But this I speak only
least that any man should think, that he did with hi^ will drink too
much, to pollute himself with most filthy lusts: yet for all that, to^ much
abundaunce of drink, was the cause of his most vile incest, being otherwise an
old man, and in a time far out of purpose, for as much as the judgments of
God were declared against the filthy lusts of the 5. Cities. And which is
wonderful, wine so alienated Lot from himself, that he understood not with what
women he had companied. Wherefore rightly says Seneca Seneca
in his 84. Epistle: They which are dronken, do many things, which afterward
when they are sober, they are ashamed of. Lot sought to make himself merry
with wine, and he incurred a perpetual heaviness. Let them therefore which
seek to be made merry with wine, remember that they put themselves in a most
present danger, and by that means may easelie throw themselves headlong,
into most grievous wicked acts. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 162.

Through Drunkenness and other vices were the Cities of Sodom and Gomorra
destroyed. Gen 19. 24. Eze. 16. 49.

Ammon being drunk was slain. 2. Reg. 13. 29.

Ela the son of Baasa King of Israel being dronken, 3. Re. 16. 9^
was slain of his servant Zimri.

Benhadad King of Syria with his 32. Kings, 3. Reg. 20. 12.
being dronken, were all overcome of King Achab.

Holofernes being overcome with drink, Judith. 13.
was slain of a woman.

Simon and his sons, through drunkenness, 1. Mac. 16. 16.
was slain of Ptolomy and Abobus.

Of the incommodities of Drunkenness, Read Pro. 23. 30 etc. Eccl. 36. 26. etc.

DROPS.
How these Drops show Christ to be a true man.
ANd his sweat was like Drops of blood. Lu. 22. 44
These not only show, that Christ was true man, but other things also which
the godly have to consider of, wherein the secret of the redemption of all
mankind is contained in the son of God his debasing himself to the state of
a servant, such things as no man can sufficiently declare.

DRVCILLA.
What manner of woman this Drucilla was.
FElix with his wife Drucilla. Act. 24. 25
This Drucilla was Agrippa his sister, of whom Luke speaks afterward, a very
harlot and licentious woman, and being the wife of Azizus King of the Emesens
who was circumcised, departed from him, and went to this Felix, the brother of
one Pallas, who was sometime Nero his bondsman.

DVVELL.
What is betokened by this word, Dwell.
WIll dwell among them. By this word dwell, Apoc. 7. 15
is betokened, friendship, familiari^ie and company betweene^ God and the
Elect, according as Christ says: If any man hear my voice, and open me the
door, I will come in to him, and suppe with him, and he with me. Marl. upon the
Apo. fol. 113.

The Lord that sits on the throne, will always dwell among them as their
most mighty defender, their solace and their comfort. Bale.

Let the word of God dwell in you plentifully in all wisdom. Col. 3. 16.
To dwell in us, is to have full possession, and a mansion house in us, to sit
and rest there, to govern and rule there, as we do in our houses and places
of our own abo^e, and how shall this be, but by that ordinary means which
God has appointed us, which is by reading and hearing the word of God, etc.
Beza.

And dwelt in us. John. 1. 1^
And dwelt. The Greek word ( Escuiosen) is as much to say, as he made his
Tabernacle, whereby the Evangelist signifies, that he was conversant among
them, as a very man, and he showed not himself the twinkling of an eye, and
so vanished away, but had his abode and continued among them long time,
whereby they might have sure and certain experience of his godly behavior,
of his singular virtues and of his wonderful works. Some think by this word
(Dwelt) that the Lord Jesus had no certain dwelling place in this world, but
was feign to ^lit often and remove, for so do they that dwell in Tents and
Tabernacles. Chrysostom takes (in us) to be in our flesh, and understands
that the humanity of Christ, was a Tabernacle to the divinity, and so frames
this argument against the Heretics, that affirmed the Word to be turned into
flesh. Look after in. Word. Traheron.

How men should dwell with their wives.
Likewise ye men dwell with them according to knowledge. 1 ^et. 3. 7.
To dwell with them, is with faithfulness, with the despising of pleasures and
of ambition, with the decking of the inner man, with the meekness and
demureness of a quiet spirit, with love and reverence to order them, not
according to our wilful commandment and lust, but according to knowledge,
appointing them to do nothing, but that is expedient, and flattering them in
nothing, that may hurt or corrupt honest conditions and manners. Tindale.

Ebion.
Of the heresy of this man.
EBion of whom the Ebionites are called, affirmed Christ to be but a bare man,
borne of Joseph and Marie, he thought that faith only did not iustifie^ He
affirmed the corporal observation of the law to be necessary, he denied the
Epistles of Paul, accusing him that he fell from the Law. The Jewish Sabbath
and other Ceremonies, he observed together with the Jews, only the Sundaie
he celebrated in remembrance of the resurrection. Euse. li. 3. ca. 24

Epiphanius says haeres. 30. that John the Evangelist hearing that Ebion was
in the Bath, refrained his company. Abdias B. of Babylon says, that Philip
the Apostle overthrew this heresy of Ebion at (...)erapolis.

EDIFIENG.
What it is to edify.
LEt every man please his neighbor in that that is good to edifieng. Romans 15.
2
To Edify, signifies to do all manner duties to our neighbors, either to
bring him to Christ, or if he be won, that he may grow from faith to faith,
for the faithful are called the Temple of God, wherein is resident his holy
spirit, and these faithful are the stones of new Jerusalem, that is the
universal Church^ Esaias. 54. Apoc. 21. 2. Of the which building, Christ is the
corner stone. Ephe. 2. 20. Geneua.

EDOM.
What is signified by Edom.
WHo is this that comes from Edom, Esaie 63. 1
with stained red clothes of Bosra. Edom is the Earth, and the stained and red
clothes, are Christ's blood, which he did shed upon earth for our sins. And
they which demand, Who is he, be his creatures, which shall marvel at the
wisdom of God, in delivering mankind from the bondage of the spiritual
^harao, by blood, by death, and by the Cross. Turnar.

This Prophecy (aforesaid) Esaias. 63. 1. is against the Edumians and enemies
which persecuted the church, on whom God will take vengeance, and is here set
forth all bloody, after he has destroyed them in Bosra the chief City of
the I^umeans, for these were their greatest enemies. And under the title of
Circumcision and the kindred of Abraham, claimed to themselves the chief
religion and hated the true worshippers. Psalm. 137. Geneua.

Remember the Children of Edom. Psa. 137. 7
According as Ezechiel. 25. 13. And leremy. 49. 7. and Abdias. ver. ^0. shows
that the E^onntes which came of Esau, conspired with the Babilonians against
their brethren and kinfolkes.

For thy cruelty (says Abdias) against thy brother Jacob, Abd. ve. 10
shame shall cover thee, and thou shall be cast off for ever. Here he shows
the cause why the Edomites were so sharply punished: to wit, because they were
enemies to his Church, whom now he comfort, by punishing their enemies.
Geneua.

EYE
A description of the Eye.
LActantius in a little book that he wrote, de opificio Dei, says on this
wise: Mark (says Lacta^tius) the situation of Eyes in the head of a man. The
Head is like a goodly Tower, gallantly garnished with the Eyes, which Nature
by the premission and ordinance of God have set in a pretty valley, compassed
about with the bulwark of the strong and hardy rock of the forhead, covered
with fine, soft and close windows, which we call the Eye liddes. In Latin
they be called Cilia quasi caelia caelando, of ciling or covering the eyes.
Underneath is set as it were a little Mount, which we call the ball of the
cheek, and all this is for the defense and sauegard of the Eye, which if he
stood open in a flat plain place, as it stands in a round valley, it should
ever be in danger to be hurt, where now, it is so on every side defended,
that no rush nor knock can lightly hurt it. Beside all this, the apple of ye
Eye, or the sight of the Eye, is compassed and nourished with plenty of fat
and moist humor, and in the mids as it were a goodly Pearl, stands the
Apple of the Eye. Weigh all these things well, and we must needs say, that
the Apple of the Eye is goodly and wonderfully defended. And that is the
cause why David does say in his seruent prayer: Psa. 17. 8
Custodi me vt pupillam oculi, Keep me as the apple of an Eye. Ric. Turnar.

To what end our Eyes were made.
Job says, Job. 31. 7
that his heart walked not after his eyes. We have to mark thereupon, that our
eyes which were created to look upon good works, to the end we might be
taught to love, reverence and fear him, are become as it were bonds of Satan,
and are as it were inticers, which come to beguile, and work our destruction.
God I say has created our Eyes. To what end? To the end that whiles we be
in this world, we should have ability to discern between things, and that the
same might lead us unto him, whether we look upward or downward, do we not see
that our Lord calls us unto himself? Are not all the creatures both in
heaven and earth, means to allure us to come to God? Then does he not only
say, come unto me: but he draws us thither by his goodness, according as we
see, he shows himself liberally toward us, and thereby ministers occasion
to us to walk in his fear. Thus ye see, to what end our eyes were made. For
if we had no eyes, we should not have such means to behold Gods glory in all
points as we have. Call. upon Job. fol. 529.

The meaning of this place following.
Is thine eye evil because I am good. Mat. 20. 15
Naught, that is to say, do thou envy at my goodness toward them? For
the Hebrews by an evil eye, means envy, because such dispositions appear
chiefelie in the eyes, as above Chapter. 6. 23. it is said to answer the
word, single, and it is there taken for corrupt: for whereas he said there
before, ver. 22. If thine eye be single, he adds in ye 23. but if thine eye be
wicked or corrupt, the word being the same in that place, as it is here. Beza.

What the Eyes and Eye liddes of God do signify.
God is said to have eyes, because he sees all things, Augustine.
and nothing is hid from him, in whose sight as the Apostle tells, no
creature is invisible, for all things be naked and open to his eyes. His eyes
also is sometime taken for his favor. As the eyes of the Lord, are over the
righteous. Psa. 34. 15. His eye liddes be taken for his secret judgments.
Psa. 11. 4. His eye liddes behold the children of men.

EAGLES.
Of the nature of Eagles.
AS concerning the nature of Eagles, it may be taken, that their young ones
do suck blood anon after they be unclosed, Job. 39 30.
because that one kind of Eagles do cast their young ones out of the neast, so
as they be driven to shifte for themselves, and it is said that they bring up
none but the black ones: howbeit, they that write of such matters, do vary
in that point. For some say that the Eagles do cast away their young ones,
as bastards, if their sight be not strong enough to look upon the shining
Sun. Call. upon Job. fol. 719.

An Eagle of all Birds lives along time, without all kind of feebleness,
Plini. li. 10 chap. 3.
dieng never of age, but of famine.

An exposition of these places following.
Thy youth shall be renewed as the Eagles. ^ The comparison of the Eagles gave
the Jews occasion to forge fables. Psa. 103. 5
For whereas they understood not the principles of any science at all, yet are
they so brazen faced, that what matter soever is entreated of, they never make
bones in it, and so soon as they meet with any uncouth thing, there is not
any so peevish a forgerie, which they threape not upon men as an Oracle from
God. So in this place they surmise, that every tenth year, the Eagles fly up
to the Elementall fire, and afterward plunge themselves in the Sea, and than by
and by new feathers grow up again. But the plain meaning of the Prophet is
picked out of the nature of the Eagle, described by the Philosophers, as which
is thoroughly known by experience. For that foul is fair and well liking
unto her old age, and is not effeebled by years, nor subject to diseases, till
at the length she die for hunger. Certain it is that she lives long: but at
the length her beak ouergroweth, so as she cannot receive meat, but only is
feign to suck in the blood of it, or else to refresh-hir self with drinking,
whereupon came the Proverb: An Eagles old age for necessity, compels him
to be ever bibling. And because drink alone is not enough to maintain life,
they rather pine away for hunger and want of food, then decaie for want of
strength. Now without any fable, we perceive the natural meaning of the
Prophet. That like as Eagles continue always lusty and in good plight, so as
they be youthful even in their old age: even so the godly are sustained by
the secret power of God, so that they receive their strength still vnappaired.
Call. upon the Psalm.

As the Eagle when her beak ouergroweth sucketh blood, and so is renewed in
strength: even so God, miraculouslie gives strength to his Church, above all
men's expectation. Geneua.

For wheresoever a dead Carcass is, even thither also will the Eagles be
gathered together. Ma. 24. 28
There are diverse kinds of Eagles, among which one is of the Uultures kind,
excelling the rest in bigness. And the Uultures (which Writers do witness)
do fly two or three days before, to the place where the carcass shall be.
Job. 39. 30
And Job of the Eagle says; where any dead body lies, there is he
immediately. It is likely that the common Proverb arose of this kind of
Eagles. Marlorate in expounding this place at the full, makes this conclusion
in the end: Moreover (says he) their reason is nothing sure or effectual,
which upon this place say, that the death of Christ was so effectual, that it
allured the elect and chosen of God. For it was rather the purpose of Christ,
to bring an argument from ye less to the more, as thus: If there be such wit in
Birds, that many of them, will come from far to one Carcass. It is a great
shame to the faithful, not to be gathered to the Author of life, by whom
only they are truly sed. Marl. fol. 576.

In despite of Satan, the faithful shall be gathered and joined with Christ, as
the Eagles assemble to a dead ^^^sse. Geneua.

Nothing can hinder the faithful to be joined to their head Jesus Christ, Luke
17. 36
for they shall gather to him as ravening birds about a carrion. Geneua.

That is, there as the son of man shall be to judge the world, thither shall
all gather together unto him. Tindale.

That is, according to S. Paul's interpretation, when Christ comes to
Judgment, we shall betaken up, to meet him in the air, and so we shall be
with him for ever.

That is, the faithful that believe the Gospel, will repair unto him as
ravenous birds to the carrion. The Bible note.

And how I carried you upon Eagles wings. Exo. 19. 4.
For the Eagles by flieng high is out of danger. And in carieng her Birds
rather on her wings, then in her talents declares her love. Geneua.

The Eagle carries her young ones upon her wings, fearing only man's violence,
which rather then they should take harm, she would receive the harm in her
own body. In steed thereof served the cloud that kept of the Egyptians
force. The Bible note.

ELAM.
What is signified by Elam.
I Will break the bow of Elam (...) By Elam is signified Persia, Ier. 49. 35.
so called of Elam the son of Sem. And because the Persians were good
Archers, he shows that the thing wherein they put their trust should not
profit them. Geneua.

The Elamites were good bow men in battle, and therefore is their bow
prophesied to be broken, etc. By which is meant, that they should be overcome
in battle of their Enemies, and scattered abroad, unto the four coasts of
the earth. T. M.

ELDAD AND MEDAD.
Look. Moses.

ELDERS.
Why he names them Elders and not Priests.
IN the old Testament, the temporal heads and rulers of the Jews, which had
the governance over the lay or common people are called Elders, as ye may
see in the four Evangelists. Out of which custom Paul in his Epistle and
also Peter, call the Prelates and spiritual Governors, which are Bishops and
Priests, Elders. Now, whether ye call them Elders or Priests, it is all one to
me, so that ye understand they be officers and Servant of the word of God:
unto the which all men both high and low that will not rebel against Christ
must obaie, as long as they preach and rule truly, and no farther. Tindale.
fol. 38.

ELEAZER.
The meaning of this place that follows.
THe child of the stewardshippe of my house, Genesis 15. 2.
is this Eleazer of Damasco. Eleazer was then Steward of Abraham's house, which
Eleazer had a son called Damascus, which child, because Sara was barren,
Abraham had thought to have adopted for his son. Of this Damascus, took the
City of Damasco his name. Lyra.

ELECTION.
What the cause of our Election is, and how it is defined.
ELection is the free mercy and grace of God in his own will, through faith
in Christ his son, choosing and preferring to life such as pleases him.
Bradford in the book of Mar.

The only good pleasure of the will and frank mercy of God by Jesus Christ
without respect of any works, either present or for to come, is the cause of
the divine Election. F. N. B. the Italian.

The cause of our election is only the will of God. And to prove this, Saint
Paul says (which saw as far in men's deseruings as we can do) brings in
an evident example of Jacob and Esau, how Jacob was elected and Esau reproved,
before they were borne, or had done either good or bad. To the which some will
say, that God saw before that Jacob should be good, and therefore chose him,
and that Esau should do no good, and therefore repelled him. But to those that
will judge of that that God saw, it may be demanded how they know that GOD
saw that, and if he saw it, yet how know they that that was the cause of
Jacobs election? Saint Paul knows none other cause but the will of God,
whatsoever other discuss. And if they should say the cause why God saw
before that Jacob should do good, was because that God would give him his
grace, therefore God saw that he should do good, and so should also the other
have done, if God would have given him that same grace. Saint Paul concluding
with these Scriptures, says: I will show mercy to whom I show mercy, and
will have compassion on whom I have compassion, So lies it not in man's will
and running, but in the mercy of God. He says not, I will have mercy on him
that I see shall do good, but I will show mercy to whom I will. He says not,
I will have compassion on him that shall deserve it, De congrua, but of him, of
whom I will have compassion. This does Austen well prove in these words: The
disputation of them is vain, the which do defend the prescience of God,
against the grace of God, and therefore say that we were chosen before the
making of the world, because that God knew before that we should be good,
because he should make us good. But he that says, you have not chosen me
says not so, for if he did therefore choose us, because that before he knew
that we should be good, then must he also have known before, that we should
first have chosen him. Here it is plain, that the election of God is not
because he saw before, that we should do well. But only the cause of the
election, is his mercy, and the cause of our doing well is his election. And
therefore Saint Paul says, not of works but of calling. I. Veron.

So then election is not of the willer, Romans 9. 16.
but of God that takes mercy. It is evident by this Text, that our works or
merits do not justify us, but that our salvation does wholly depend upon the
free election of GOD, which being righteousness it self, does choose whom
it pleases him unto life everlasting. Sir I. Cheek.

Blessed are the people whom the Lord has chosen to be his inheritance,
Psa. 34. 12
etc. Of the Lords free election and choosing of his Citizens, whom he has
predestinate and appointed to be saved, the Scripture both in the old and new
Testament speaks much. In the 20. of Saint Matthew, verse 16. our savior
says: Multi vocati, pauci vero electi^ Many be called, but few be chosen.
All they be called which have had the word of GOD preached unto them. And they
only are elect, which finally and eternally shall be saved, and inherit the
everlasting kingdom with Jesus Christ the first begotten, and the only
purchaser of life eternal. The elect have these properties and blessings of
GOD following them: Though they do fall and sin of tentimes, yea and
peradventure very greeuouslie as David did: or committing as Saint Peter did
with his denieng and forswearing of CHRIST: As Marie Magdalene and the woman of
Samarie did, with their frail and foolish yielding unto the pleasure of the
flesh, yet they never fall from GOD, but their gross and natural falls, do
cast them into such a shame of themselves and abhorring of sins, that by
their falling they rise up the more stronger. So that the elect cannot finally
be seduced nor carried away from GOD. For whom Christ loves, In finem
diligit, he loves surely unto the very end. Neque rapere eos de manu ei^s
quisque potest. No creature can pluck out of Christ's hands his elect
servant, and no marvel, for the purpose of Gods election is sure. The elect
unto salvation was chosen before they were borne, and before they did either
good or badde, as Saint Paul witnesses, proving this example true, by Jacob
and Esau the sons of Rebecca, and as it was in those two brethren (says
Saint Paul) so was it in all men before they were borne, having done neither
good nor evil. The one was an elect person, and the other a man reprobate,
according as it is written, Jacob dilexi, Esau autem odio habui, Jacob have I
loved, Esau have I hated. All this was done says Saint Paul, to the end that
all men might know, that the free election and choosing of God unto salvation,
stands upon his predestinate purpose, and not upon our good works, or our
good deeds which we do, after that we believe and live in this world. For
God before the foundation of the world was laid, had predestinate and appointed
all the elect to be saved, and all the reprobate persons, God did foresee and
fore-knowe, that they should be dampened. But then it might be objected thus: If
the salvation of man do rest upon Gods election, what fault is there in man,
though he be dampened, is not the fault in God? To this Saint Paul answers
and says roundly: Absit, GOD forbid that any man should so think, but yet I
will have no man to control me: for unto Moses it was said: I will show
mercy unto whom it pleases me: Therefore let all men set their hearts at
rest, says the Apostle, Quia non est volentis neque currentis, sed in Dei
miserentis. For it is not in the power of the well willer, nor in the swift
runner, but in the power of GOD that mercy shows. But thou will peradventure
say, why does GOD blame us, if we be not saved, seeing no man is able to
resist his will and his knowledge. Here the Apostle once again, bids
every man to stop, and in no wise to enter into such disputation with GOD,
says: O homo quis es qui respondes Deo, numquid dicit figmentum ei qui se
finzit, quid me fecisti sic? Therefore O thou vain man stop in this matter
betimes, and be not too bold after such manner to dispute with God, Thou will
then say, what profit can come to one of us the lay people, by speaking or
preaching of Gods election, it seems to be a perilous matter to be talked
of: no not so, do not thou call that perilous which the holy Ghost has
ordained for thy comfort and singular profit, if thou be of God: marie if
thou be of the Devil, it shall bring thee either to desperation that thou
art not elect, and therefore thou must needs be dampened, or else to presumption
that thou art elect, and therefore do what thou will thou must needs be
saved.

But if thou be of GOD, thou shall take two great benefits, the one is this:
Where the property (even of the best of us all) is to be tickled with vain
glory and pride, and are always ready to advance our own good works. This
did I, and thus and thus. To pluck away this pride, this vain glory, and
reioising in our selves, and to make us wholly to humble our selves unto God,
there is no such thing, as to say unto our selves: It is neither in the power
of the well willer, nor in the swift runner, but in the power of God and mercy
shewer. This is a great profit and necessary lesson to be taught. An other to
be learned of Gods election is this. That in God there is most high providence
for the government of the world, seeing that he has foreseen and forecast
all things, before the foundation of the world was laid, there can no man then
accuse God of negligence: nor again there needs no man to practice any evil
craft to get a living, seeing God forgets no body, nor leaves none of his
unprovided for: so that we have all then good cause to rejoice with the Prophet
and say: Blessed be those people whom the Lord has chosen to be his
inheritance. As who should say: by the providence and free election of God,
salvation comes to men. Tur.

How our election is particular and not universal.
Election is particular and not universal, for surely he that takes al,
makes no choice, and he that chooses a thing out from two other things or
more, must needs be said to refuse or forsake the things that he chooses not.
Theo. Beza.

Signs of our election
Whoseuer feels himself called of God both inwardly and outwardly, and
does constantly believe, that he is delivered from eternal dampnation and
justified before God by Jesus Christ only, he surely has most certain
signs in himfelfe, whereby he may know that he is chosen of GOD to eternal
glorification in Jesus Christ, not being in himself capable of so excellent a
thing: and so he holds Christ as it were a glass before his eyes, in the
which he sees continually his own eletion. F. N. B. the Italian.

The saying of the elect within himself.
The man y^ is not endued with the spirit of adoption (which is also the spirit
of holiness, righteousness, says and life) says thus: I do the evil that
I have a mind unto. I do no good, nor have no list to do it. But the man
that is regenerate and so consequently elected (howbeit as still yet
wrestling) says thus: I do the evil that I would not do, and I do not the
good that I would do, woe is me, who shall deliver me out of the body of this
death. And in crieng out on this wise, the elect person casts his Anchore in
the very throne of God the Father, whom he beholds in the preached word, and
in the Sacrament. Theo. Beza.

The elect number have always in their hearts, this humble confession. Lord
we are the workmanship of thine hands, made to do the thing whereunto thou have
appointed us by thy secret will and purpose. Thy will be done in us. Thou have
revealed unto us the things that do please thee, and thou have showed unto us
things that thou do hate. But unless thou pluck us back by thy grace
Lord, we follow upon the worse, though our conscience allow the better.
Crowley.

How to make our election sure.
Give more diligence to make your election and calling sure. 2. P^. 1 10.
Albeit it be sure in it self, forasmuch as God cannot change, yet we must
confirm it in our selves by the fruits of the spirit, knowing that the purpose
of God, electeth, calls, sanctifies and justifies us. Geneua.

Although the calling of God be stable and sure, nevertheless the Apostle will
that our works should declare unto men, that we are called. Tindale.

Objection.
Since we be sure of our election, what need we have the gospel preached unto
us, or to make our prayer to God, for to obtain such things as do perteine to
our salvation, since we be sure of it already?

Answer.
If we have a good piece of ground, which we know most perfectly to be
fruitful, would we not till it still and sow it, that we may have some
profit of it, or would we let it lie alone, because we know it to be
fruitful: Even so the elect and chosen are as it were plowed and tilled, and
good seeds still cast into their hearts, that they may bring forth good and
pleasant fruit unto the Lord. Again, If we go about that the true elect and
chosen of God, have no need of the preaching of Gods word, because they be
sure already of their salvation: we may also maintain and uphold, that we
have no need of meat and drink, since that we be assured by Gods word, that
we shall not die before the time that God has appointed. Christ was sure of
his salvation, and yet continued all night in prayer. I. Veron.

ELEMENTS.
What is signified by Elements.
AFter the Elements of the world. By the Elements some understand the Sun,
the Moon, the Stars, or the other Elements, thinking that there was among
the Coll^ssians, some that did worship these Elements as Gods, and desired
health and salvation of them, putting trust and confidence in them, praieng to
them, and desiring of them prosperous things, and of the disposition of these
Elements prophesied things to come: The Apostle here bids them beware they
fantasy no such thing by these Elements which are no Gods, nor are not to be
worshipped as God, but as the creatures of GOD, made and ordained for the
behalf and commodity of man in this world. Other understand by Elementa
mundi, the ceremonial and judicial laws of the old Testament, thinking them
to be necessary for salvation, and that none could be saved without the
observing of them, as some thought. Act 15 ^ and among the Galathians. 4 9. But
Peter and James, and the residue of the Apostles of Christ, thought legal
ceremonies and sacrifices not necessary for salvation, but salvation might
well be had without them, yea, and without all ceremonies, for ceremonies now
used in the Church, be no holy things of themselves, they make no man holy,
they be no workers nor works of salvation. They be ordained to signify and
represent other things signified by them. And here the Apostle bids them
beware of such as did call them to the law, and not to Christ, to the
ceremonies and works of the law, and of man decreede, and not of God
commanded: And here he wills them to beware, of all them that exhort men
to ceremonies, old customs, voluntary works, laws, statutes, decrees,
traditions of men, rather then Gods commandments. Ridley.

ELIAS.
The Jews opinion of Elias.
ARt chou Elias, John 1. 21.
and he said I am not. The Jews thought that Elias should come again before
the days of Messiah, and they took the ground of that their opinion out of
Malachy. 4. 5. which place is to be understood of John. Math. 11. 14. And yet
John denies that he was Elias, aunswering them in deed according as they
meant. Theo. Beza.

Behold I will send you Elias the Prophet. This Christ expounds of John
Baptist. Mal. 4. 5
Math. 11. 14. who both for his zeal, and restoring of religion, is aptly
compared to Elias. Geneua.

Of the comparing of Elias with Christ, and his coa^e with the Sacrament.
Chrysostom says. Chrisosto^
Elias (when he was carried up in the fiery Chariot) left to his Disciple
Elizeus his mantell of Sheep skins: but the son of GOD when he ascended,
left us his flesh. But Elias put off his mantell: and Christ has left his
flesh with us, and ascended, having it with him.

Answer.
Chrysostom shows in what sort Christ has both taken up his flesh into
heaven, and also left the same among the faithful in the earth, and in the
end compares Elias and Christ together. The story is known that when Elias
was taken up in a fiery Chariot, he let down his coat unto Elizens that
stood beneath, who took it up, and by the power of the same divided the water
of Iordane. Upon occasion hereof Chrysostom says: Elizeus received the coat
made of Sheep skins, as a great inheritance more precious then any gold.
After that time Elias was double, for there was Elias above ^ and Elias
beneath. Above was the very true Elias in the natural substance and presence
of a body: beneath was nothing else but Elias coat, which coat
notwithstanding because of the powers that were wrought with it, he called
Elias. Thus Chrysostom compares Elias with Christ, and Elias coat with the
Sacrament. And this he says, Christ is above, and Christ is beneath, as he
says, Elias is above, and Elias is beneath. For as Elias coat was called
Elias, even so the Scarament of Christ's body is called Christ's body.

ELISEVS.
How he resisted not the king, in keeping out his messenger.
THe Prophet had a special warrant by Gods especial reueling, 4 Re. 6. 32
so to bid them, and therefore the Prophet did nothing amiss therein, etc. The
cause whereof (says Lyra) is annexed: for behold the sound of his masters
feet is after him, for after the departure of the messenger, Ioram repented,
and therefore he followed him, to revoke the precept. And says Caitane, that
thou should boldly resist the kings messenger, he foretells them, that
the king followed his messenger, repenting ye he sent him, and therefore the
king followed the messenger, because he repented that he had commanded, that
Elizeus head should be cut off, for he came to himself again, and came
personally to move his complaint before Elizeus. I. Bridges. fol. 1084.

ELIZABETH.
How she might be Mary's cousin.
ANd behold thy cousin Elizabeth. Luke. 1. 36
Though Elizabeth were of the Tribe of Leui, yet she might be Mary's cousin. For
whereas it was forbidden by the law, for maidens to be married to men of other
Tribes, this could not let, but that the Leuies might take them wives, out of
any Tribe, for the Levites had no portion allowed them when the land was
divided among the people.

Notwithstanding ye Elizabeth was married to one of the Tribe of Leui, yet she
was Mary's cousin which was of the stock of David. For the law which forbadde
marriage out of their own Tribe, was only that the Tribes should not be
mixed and confounded, which could not be in marrieng with the Levites, for they
had no portion assigned unto them. Geneua.

EMANVEL.
Wherefore Christ was called by this name.
AND they shall call his name Emanuel, Mat. 1. ^3.
which is by interpretation, God with us. Christ is called Emanuel, in that he
took the flesh of man, and joined and knit himself to us, and became our
brother. Tindale.

EMERALDE.
The description of this stone, and what is betokened by it.
THe fourth an Emeralde. Apo. 21. 19
This stone is exceeding green, above all herbs and leaves, in so much as it
makes even the very air about it green. Hereof are many kinds: but the
preciousest in the Countreie of Sychamit, which is desert and vninhabitable by
reason of extreme cold. And these stones are kept by Griffons, not for
themselves, but for men. For armed men fight against them, and take them from
them. The Devil is the Griffon who labors to take from us the jewel of our
redemption bestowed upon us by Christ in the coldenesse of his exceeding sore
passion, that is to wit, of his infirmity, took upon him for us, through the
freshness of his invincible courage. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 299.

The fourth was a Smaragde or an Emeralde, which is not only green of his
own nature, but he makes all the air about him to seem green also. Of
this condition was Jeremy and Paul, which having the doctrine of life, spared
not to minister it unto others, for their eternal refreshing, these with such
other thrown into the foundation of the church were very comfortable unto
other. With the holy (says David) thou shall be holy, and with the pure
innocent, thou shall be both innocent and pure. Bale.

EMIMS.
What kind of people they were.
A Kind of Gyaunts so called because they were terrible and cruel, for Emim
signifies terriblenesse. Tindale fol. 15.

ENACH.
What the Enachs were.
A Kind of Gyaunts so called, Nu. 13. 23
happily because they ware cheines about their necks. Tindale. fol. 15.

Enach or Enak in Hebrew is to girde, Iudi^. 1. 20
or to compass, and is chiefly referred to cheines, which are worn about the
neck for comeliness sake. And thereof is this name Enak derived, and in the
plural number, has both the masculine and the feminine form, and it
signifies a cheine, and is transferred to noble and worthy men, whom thou
may call cheined. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 15.

ENEMY.
How an Enemy is not to be despised.
The Philistines despising the Hebrews, 1. Re. 14. 13.
were overcome of Ionathas and his harnesse-bearer.

Golias disdained David, 1. Reg. 17. 42.
who notwithstanding overcame him and slew him.

Benhadad king of Siria, 3. Reg 20.
making light of the power of Israel, was overcome of Achab, and saine to crave
of him his pardon.

Amasiahu king of Judah not esteeming Iehoas king of Israel, 4. Reg 14. 2. etc.
was of him taken captive, and carried to Jerusalem, to his great dishonor.

How an enemy reconciled is not sodeinlie to be trusted.
Saul acknowledging his fault with tears, 1. Reg. 24. 26. and 26. 21.
was not therefore to be trusted.

Ioab being reconciled to Abner, 2. Reg. 2. 28. and. 3. 27.
by deceit notwithstanding slew him.

Triphon as a reconciled enemy, kept Ionathas in hold, and at the last put
him to death. 1. Mac. 12. 48. and 13. 23.

ENON AND SALIM.
Why John baptized there, more then else where.
AND John John. 3. 23.
baptized in Enon beside Salim. The Geographers affirm that these two Towns
Enon and Salim, are not far from the river of Iordane and Iaboc: near unto
the which two Towns, they make a City called Scythopolis. Hierome says it
makes no matter, whether you read Salem or Salim. The cause why John
baptized in Enon is added, for that there was much water there. Marl. fol. 80.

ENTER.
An exposition of these places following.
ENter not into judgment with thy servant. Psa. 143. 2
Saint Austen upon this place says: O LORD enter not into judgment with thy
servant: What means that, enter not into judgment with thy servant? Thus
much it means: Stand not with me in judgment, requiring of me all that thou
have commanded, for if thou enter into judgment with me, thou shall find
me guilty. I had need therefore, not of thy upright judgment, but of thy
mercy. August. de tempo. ser. 46.

Enter into thy masters joy. Math. 25. 21. 23.
The master receives him into his house, to give him part of his goods and
commodities. Geneua.

Enter into thy masters joy, is as much to say, as possess the kingdom
prepared for all such as are faithful. Tindale.

ENVY.
How Envy came first into the world.
Envy came first of Satan, Gen 3.
for enuieng the felicity of man whom GOD had created and set in Paradise, a
place replenished with all pleasure, changed himself into an Angel of light,
abusing the wisdom of the Serpent to deceive man. Lanquet.

Examples of Envy.
Of envy, Genesis 4. 5.
Caine slew his brother Abel.

Of envy the Philistines stopped the Well from Abraham's servant. Genesis 26. 15


Of envy Joseph was sold of his brethren. Genesis 37. 4.


The Egyptians envied the multiplication of the Israelites. Exo. 1. 12.


Miriam, Nu. 12. 13
enuieng her brother, was plagued with leprosy.

Through envy Saul persecuted David. 1. Re. 18. 8.

Envy stirs up all contention. Pro. 10. 12.

Through envy Daniel was accused as a transgressour of the kings laws. Dan.
6. 13.

The elder brother envied the younger brother, which had prodigally spent his
goods received into favor. Luke. 15. 27.

EPHA.
What an Epha is.
THe tenth part of an Epha of barleie meal. Nu. 5. 15.
An Epha contains three bushels. The tenth deal of an Epha co^teineth only
so much as forty Eegge-shells can comprise. An Hin is a measure of things
Liquid, containing as much as xij. Logges, each Logge holds as much as vi.
Egge-shells can hold. But Omer or Gomer, which is called Corus in Latin,
contains the measure of three Ephaes, that is as much as a thousand, two
hundred, fourscore and ten Egge-shels can contain. The Bible note.

EPHESVS.
Of whom this City took his name.
Ephesus was the Mother City of the lesser Asia, Apoc. 1. 11
and a famous mart Town builded by the Amazons, the noblest of all the Cities
of Ionia, taking that name of a woman of Amazonia, and before that time turned
by many other names, as Vrichia, Ortigia, Ptelea and Arsinoe, after the name
of Arsinoe, the wife of king Lisimachus. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 19

EPHOD.
What an Ephod is.
An Ephod is a garment somewhat like an Amice, save the arms came through and
it was girded too. Tindale. fol. 11.

The Hebrew word Aphad, is to bind or so gird, whereof this nowne is derived,
signifieng a Garment which compassed the shoulders, and then it was bound
together, and after a sort girded together the inward coat. Pet. Mar. upon
Iudic. fol. 151.

Girded with a linen Ephod. 1. Re. 2. 18
An Ephod is a short and narrow linen coat without sleeves, put uppermost
upon his garments to keep them close unto him. The Bible note.

Of two kinds of Ephods.
There was an Ephod which only the high Priests used, it was made of Purple,
Uiolet color, Silk, and Scarlet, it had gold wrought in it, and sundry
kinds of most precious stones. There was also an other, which was called Ephod
bad, that is, a linen Ephod, which the Levites used in holy service. Pet.
Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 151.

EPHRAIM
Why the Tribe of Ephraim is not reckoned.
NEither is the Tribe of Ephraim reckoned, Apoc. 7. 6
because Jeroboam the first king of Israel after the division of the kingdom
being of that Tribe made Israel to sin in the golden calves, according as
the holy history reports. Marl. fol. 108.

EPISTLE to the Hebrews.
Why it is thought, not to be Saint Paul's.
THe Epistle which bears the title to the Hebrews, is not thought to be his,
for the difference if the style and phrase, but either judge it to be written
of Timothy, as Tertulian supposes, or of Saint Luke as other do think, or
else of Clement, afterward Bishop of Rome, who as they say was adioined
with Paul, and coupling together his songs and sentences, did phrase them in
his style and manner. Or else as some do judge, because S. Paul wrote to the
Hebrews, for the odiousness of his name among that people, therefore he
dissembled and suppressed his name in the first entry of his salutation,
contrary to his accustomed condition. And as he wrote to the Hebrews, he
being an Hebrew, so he wrote in Hebrew, ye is in his own tongue, more
eloquentlye, and that is thought to be the cause why it differs from his
other Epistles, and is after a more eloquent manner translated into the Greek,
then his other Epistles be. Some also read the Epistle written to Laodicia,
but that is explosed of all men. Thus far Saint Hierome. In the book of Mar.
fol. 55.

EQVALITIE OF BISHOPS.
Look. Bishops.

EQVINOCTIALL.
What it is.
THE Equinoctial is, when the day and night is both of one length, and
comes twice in a year, to wit, the. viii. of April and the viii. of
October. The Jews began to reckon from one to twelve, as we began to
reckon from seven in the morning till six at night, and so it was, that our
three a clock was nine a clock to them, and our five, eleven to them.
Bullinger. fol. 363.

EARS.
To what end the use of Ears serve.
IT is not said only that the ear shall hear, that is to say, that it is
created only to hear, but it is also said, that it shall judge of words
and matters: As if Elim should say, that the LORD has not given us the
opening of our ears to receive the Doctrine that is told us as a poison, but
to the end to receive the doctrine that serves to the spiritual feeding of
our souls: Like as when we receive Bread and Wine, we are not afraid to eat
and drink, as though we wist not whether it were poison or no. True it is,
that we must beware of poison, and pray to GOD to preserve us from it: But
are men so foolish to sterue themselves, and to forbear eating and drinking,
for fear least their food be poisoned? No, for they can skill of meats, to
discern whether it be poisoned or no. So then let us understand, that our
Lord has not given us the use of our ears to the end we should be afraid
to receive the doctrine, because we think it too high, and too dark for us:
but it behooves us to pray GOD to give us the spirit of discreation and
judgment, to the end we may apply that thing to our profit, which shall
be declared to us out of his word, and therewithal so to govern us by his
holy spirit, as we may be skillful to discern the thing that is good and
profitable, etc. Calvin upon Job. fol. 105.

How and by whom our ears must be opened.
He put his finger into his ears, Mar. 7. 33
etc. and straight ways they were opened. By the which we may learn, that his
word can neither be heard nor understood, unless our ears be opened by
Christ's finger, that is to say, unless the holy Ghost do open the ears of
our hearts. Hemmyng.

How God is said to have ears.
God is said to have ears, because he hears all things, Augustine
Sap. 1. 10. The ear of the jealous hears all things, and the noise of the
grudgings shall not be hid.

EARTH.
How it is founded upon the Seas.
IT is the property of all wise men, Mat. 7. 27
as it may plainly appear by the words of our Savior in the Gospel of
Saint Mathewe, that when they shall go about to build any strong house,
they will be sure that the foundation shall be laid, not upon sand or
muddie mire, but upon a rock or some other sure or steadfast ground, knowing
that otherwise all their labor and cost, comes shortly to naught, whilst
either the violence of the wind or the waves of the hudge floude, do rush
against that house, and break it down. Seeing then that this is the right
property of all substantial, wise, and politic builders: What a wonderfutl
paradoxe and inopinable sentence is this, to say: Qui ipse fundauit, etc.

The Lord himself (the fountain of all) has founded the whole earth, that
is so hudge and heavy a thing, upon the wavering waters and flowing floudes.
These be the words of the Prophet. Super maria fundauit eam, and super
flumina preperauit eam. Or as Saint Hierome reads, Super flumina stabiliuit
eam. Upon the Seas, he has founded the whole earth, and upon the floudes he
has stablished it. This sentence cannot but seem to the judgment of all men,
a marvelous strange and wonderful saying, the earth to be founded upon the
water. Natural reason will lead a man to say, that God has founded the sea
upon the earth, and not the earth upon the water: Nam terra aquae
stabilimentum est, non aqua terrae. For of the four Elements, the Fire, the
Air, the water, and the earth, the Orb of the fire is the highest, and
covers the earth round about: the Air likewise ought by natural consent to
cover ye water round about, and the water the earth. Wherefore then it
follows by good reason, that earth being the heauiest and lowest of all the
four Elements, and next under the water, it ought therefore to be called the
foundation of the waters (because the waters do lie upon the earth) and not
the waters the foundation of the earth. This reason is so strong, that no
natural wit can be able to impugn it. Again in the 104. Psalm, the Prophet
says, That the Lord has founded the earth upon his own weight and
stablenesse, Fundasti terram super stabilitatem tuam and non inclinabitur in
seculum seculi. Ovid the Poet says in like manner: Tellus po^deratu^ librata
suis. The earth is stayed and paised by means of his own weight, he says not
that the earth is founded, and yet the Prophet says: Dominus super maria
fundauit orbem terrae, and super flumina stabiliuit eam. The Lord has founded
the whole earth upon the Seas, and upon the floudes he stablished it. Ye
shall understand therefore by the order of natural reason, the earth like as
it is the lowest of all the four Elements, and next under the water, so it
ought to be altogether covered with water, and underneath the water. But ye
almighty and most mighty creator of all things, by his myraculous and his
divine power, has altered the order general, and has made a law and a
statute peculiar, which is this: That the waters shall not ouerflow the whole
earth, but to be contented with a portion of the earth to dwell upon, and to
get them into a corner, and in no wise so hardy their heads to pass their
bounds and limits appointed. This statute was made upon the third day after
the creation of the world, as we read in Genesis 1. Chapter on this wise.
Congregantur aquae sub coelo sunt in locum vnum, and appareat arida. Let the
waters that be under Heaven, be gathered together into one place, that the dry
land may appear. And by this peculiar commandment of God, in the which the
Philosopher being ignorant, and seeing such a miraculous work above Nature,
be called it Natura particularis. Now ye must note, that forasmuch as this
peculiar order that God has established between the waters and the dry
land, the Earth is exalted above the waters, even as far as the walls of an
house are above the foundation. In consideration of this miraculous work of
God, the earth is here said by ye Prophet to be builded partly upon the salt
Seas, and partly upon the fresh floudes, because the earth is so wonderfully
exalted in every place above the waters, even as far as the walls of an house
is above the foundation, and not that the water is absolutely the foundation
or the pillar of the Earth. Ric. Turnar.

EARTHQVAKE.
How Earthquakes do come.
AN Earthquake is a shaking of the earth, which is caused by means of wind
and exhalations that be enclosed within the caves of the earth, and can find
no passage to break forth, or else so narrow a way, that it cannot be soon
enough delivered. Wherefore with great force and violence it breaks forth,
and one while shakes the earth, and another while rendeth and cleaves the
same, sometime it casts up the earth a great height into the air, and
sometime it causes the same to sink a great depth down, swallowing both
Cities and Towns, yea and also mighty great Mountains, leaving in the place
where they stood, nothing but great holes of an unknown depth, or else great
lakes of water. W. F.

Aristotle the great and the learned Philosopher, disputes of Earthquakes in
the 5. book of his Mute. And holds opinion that y^ cause efficient of
Earthquakes be wind enclosed within the caves and hollow places of the earth.
And the material cause he judges to be Exhalations hot and dry. Other of the
most ancient and great Philosophers, be of a clean contrary opinion, which
is this: That Earthquakes do come with the vehement pushes and beatings of
great waters, that be crept in at the caves of the earth, and afterward do
seek a way out, which when they cannot find, the waters violently enclosed,
beating and rolling up and down within the earth, does cause earthquakes, but
it is to be thought that the third opinion, which A. G. li. 2. cap. 10^
seems to allow, is better and a more wiser opinion (no dispraise nor
displeasure to Aristotle) then either of both these, and that is this: that no
man can certainly tell, the cause of Earthquakes, but only God, and these be
his words: Quaenam esse causam, quamobrem terra motus fiant, non cordibus
hominum, sensibus, opinionibusque comitatum est. Sed ne iuter phisicas quidem
phinas satis constiti^. And indeed though that Earthquakes be works and above
our discuss of reason, yet by the Scripture we be taught, that Earthquakes,
Thunderings and Lightenings, be tokens and tastes of Gods most tremed and
dreadful power. And sometimes also they be plagues, inflicted to impenitent
sinners in the time of Gods wrath, teaching all men to stand in awe of God,
and to beware how they displease him, with breaking of his law and holy
commandments. Ric. Turnar.

ESAV AND ISMAEL.
What is to be thought of their salvation.
I Think of Esau and Ismael, so much only as the holy Scripture has set
forth unto us. And I think that there are no places extant, by which we may
define any thing touching their salvation. The Scripture thus speaks of
Esau, that he so vehemently hated his brother, that he sought to kill him,
that he sold his birthright, that he provoked his parents to anger, when he
had taken strange women to wives: that he was a violent man, and despised the
land of Canaan, promised unto the fathers, and in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
it is written, that although he poured out tears, yet found he no place of
repentance. Of Ismael also we read, that he was rejected not only by the
will of Sara, but also by the will of God. But touching both their posterities,
I deny not but some of them might be saved, no less then some of the stock of
Jacob might become runnagates and obstinate. For it is sufficient to the
election and reiection of God, that some part of either Stock, be either
elected or rejected. Peter Mar. upon the Romans fol. 251.

Ye know how that afterward, He. 12. 17
when he would have inherited the blessing, he was put by, and he found no
means to come thereby again, no though he desired it with tears.

This text makes not against repentance that is done in season, for Esau
repented too late, therefore profited not. When sentence of judgment is given,
then has repentance no place. The dampened in Hell, shall weep and repent, but
in vain: for then is the time of repenting past. The blessing which Isaac
gave, was undoubted done by the inspiration of the Holy ghost, and given in
steed of a determinate sentence, and therefore must needs be ratified, and
might not be called again. But and if Esau before the blessing given, had
changed his manners, and had heartelie and earnestly repented him, he had
surely not been reproved of God. This should seem to be the very meaning of
this place. Tindale.

He was full of despite and disdain, but was not touched with true
repentance, to be displeased for his sins, and so seek amendment. Genena.

ESSENCE OF GOD.
What the Essence or substance of God is.
BY Essence is meant the nature that is common to those three persons, the
Father, the Son, and the Holy ghost. Theo. de Beza.

ESSES.
What manner of people the Esses were.
THe Esses, when they perceived that both the Pharisees and Saduces followed
their appetites under the color of honest Titles, neither did ought in a
manner that were worthy their profession, therefore seemed it them good, to
declare ye straitnes and severity of life with the deed, and would be called
Essei, that is, workers or doers. For Assa, whence the name Essei comes
signifies to work: as in these times the Anabaptists, do reprove both the
Lutherians and Papists, and endeavor to seem more holier then either of them.
For the Essei lived in a manner in all things, as the Anabaptists live: they
married not, and would have all things common among them. They delighted in
clean apparel and prayed before the Sun rising, etc. Lanquet.

The Essea^s celebrate festiual days not after ye Jews, Heretics
but severally at several times: they think themselves purer the^ other people.
Epipha. de haere. The Esseans says Josephus (Antiquit. lib. 15. cap. 13.)
exercise the like trade of life as Pythagoras delivered among the Grecians.
Again ( lib. 13. cap. 8.) They affirm all things to be governed by destenie.
They marie no wives. They think ( Bell. Iud. li. 2. ca. 7.) that no woman will
keep her self to one man. They have nothing proper, but all common. They are
in number above 4. thousand. Antiq. li. 18. ca. 2.

There is a second sort of Esseans, says Josephus (Bell. Iud. li. 2. cap. 7.)
which agree with the other in all things, marriage only excepted. They commend
marriage for the maintenance of succession. Their manner is for three years
space, to behold the health and behavior of maidens, then if they see them
healthie and fit for procreation they marie them.

Of the people called Esseni or Essei.
A people inhabiting Judea toward the West, which do live without women, and
contemn gold, silver and all other riches. They live by ea^ing of Dates. There
resorteth continually unto them by the providence of God, men from diverse
parts, so that their company never fails, but none is received, unless the
merit of his virtue and chastity do advance him. Eliot.

ESTRICH.
The nature and property of the Estrich.
THis Bird has such a weighty body, that he cannot mount up to fly aloft,
but flickereth in such wise as he cannot be ouergone. A man may well run post
after him, but he cannot overtake him. For what with his half leaping upon his
clees, and what with his half flieng with his wings, he passes all the
swiftness that can be in horses, or in any other beast. They have this
policy, to take up stones by the way, and throw them at such as follow
after them. But again there is such foolishness in them, that if they once
hide their head, they think that all their bodies are hidden, and yet the huge
carcasses of them, are seen still. And as touching their Eggs, they sit not
upon them. But forasmuch as they keep in hot Countries, they hide them in the
sand, and the Sun giving warmness unto them, does by that means hatch
them, etc. Calvin upon Job. fo. 716.

EATING.
Of the eating of Christ's flesh, and drinking his blood.
WHen our Lord Jesus Christ spoke of his body: John. 6. 54
Except (says he) a man eat my flesh and drink my blood, he shall have no
life in himself, for my flesh is very meat, Augustine
and my blood is very drink. The spiritual understanding saves him that
believes, for the letter kills, but the spirit quickens. August. in ser.
ad infantes. Here it is plain, that the text must be taken spirituallie.

Mark (says Origin) Origin.
that they are figures which are written in the Scripture of God, and therefore
examine them as spiritual men, and not as carnal, and understand those things
that are spoken. For if thou follow after the letter, this saying that is
spoken: Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you
can have no life in you, this letter kills. Origin. in Leuit. 7.

He that eats my flesh, John. 6. 5^
and drinks my blood, abides in me and I in him. This is therefore (says S.
Austen) Augustine
the eating of that meat, and drinking of that blood, is to abide in Christ,
and have him abiding in us. And therefore he that abides not in Christ, and in
whom Christ abides not, without doubt he eats not Christ's flesh nor
drinks his blood, although he eat and drink the Sacrament of so great a
thing, unto his own damnation. Augu. sermo circa feria pas. Here it is
plain, that he which abides not in Christ, that is to say, he that is wicked
and unfaithful, does not eat his flesh, nor drink his blood, although he eat
and drink the Sacrament of so great a thing. And so must it needs follow that
the Sacrament is not the very natural body of Christ, for then the
unfaithful should eat his flesh, seeing he eats the Sacrament of his body,
but that does S. Austen deny. Wherefore it must needs be, but only a token
of a remembrance, and a sign of his body breaking, and a representation of
his passion.

He that abides not in me, and in whom I abide not, Augu. de ciuit. Dei. li.
21. ca. 25
let him not say or think that he eats my body, or drinks my blood. They
abide not in Christ, which are not his members, which make themselves the
members of an harlot. Here it is plain that the wicked and ungodly or
unfaithful (which are not the members of Christ) do not eat his body nor
drink his blood, and yet they do eat the Sacrament, as well as the other.
Wherefore it must needs be that the Sacrament is not the very body of Christ,
but a figure, token or memorial thereof.

The bread (says Saint Ambrose) Ambrose.
that goes into the body, is not so greedelie sought of us, but the bread of
everlasting life, which vpholdeth the substance of our soul, so he that
discordeth from Christ, does not eat his flesh nor drink his blood, although
he receive y^ sacrament of so great a thing, to his damnation and destruction.
Ambrose de Sacra. Here S. Ambrose confirms S. Austens saiengs before.

Though we do verelie eat Christ, Augustine
yet it it follows not, that we do grossly and naturally eat him with our
mouth. And though Christ be very meat, yet it follows not that he is
therefore reallie and fleshly in the Sacrament. S. Austen says, What
preparest thou thy teeth or thy belly, believe, and thou have eaten. In
another place he says: Believing in him, is the eating of the bread of life.

You shall not eat this body that you see, Augustine
nor drink that blood, which they that crucified me shed out, I have given a
very sacrament unto you, if it be spirituallie understood, it quickens you,
but the flesh profits nothing. Augu. prefa. psalm. 98. This is plain enough
spoken. Frith.

He that discordeth from Christ (says this Doctor) does neither eat his
body nor drink his blood, Prospe. in li. sententiarum.
although he receive indifferently the sacrament of so great a thing, unto his
condemnation of his presumption. These are also the very words of Bid, upon
the 11. chapter of the first Epistle to y^ Corinthians.

Therefore says S. Cipriane, Cipriane.
he that drinks of the holy Cup, remembering this benefit of God, is more
thirsty, then he was before, and lifting up his heart unto the living God, is
taken with such a singular hunger and appetite, that he abhors all gallie
and bitter drinking of sin, and all savor of carnal pleasure is to him as
it were sharp and sower vinegar. And the sinner being converted receiving the
holy mystery of the Lords supper, gives thanks unto God, and booweth down
his head, knowing that his sins be forgiven, and that he is made clean and
perfect, and his soul (which God has sanctified) he renders to God again,
as a faithful pledge, and then he glories with Paul, and reioiceth saying:
Now it is not I that live, but it is Christ that lives within me. These things
be practiced and used among faithful people, and to pure minds, the eating of
his flesh, is no horror but honor, and the spirit deliteth in the drinking
of the holy and sanctified blood, and doing this, we whet not our teeth to
bite, but with pure faith, we break the holy Bread. These be the words of
Cipriane, De coena Domini.

The Word (says Origin) Origin.
was made flesh and very meat, which who so eats shall surely live for
ever, which no evil man can eat. For if it could be, that he that continues
ill, might eat the Word made flesh, seeing that he is the Word and Bread of
life, it should have been written: Whosoever eats this Bread, shall live for
ever. Origin in Matthew. chapter. 15.

The Author of this tradition (Saint Cypriane) Cipriane.
said, that except we eat his flesh and drink his blood, we should have no
life in us, instructing us with a spiritual lesson, and opening to us a way
to understand so privy a thing, that we should know, that the eating is our
dwelling in him, and our drinking is as it were an incorporation in him, being
subject unto him in obaieng, joined unto him in our wills, and united in our
affections: the eating therefore of this flesh, is a certain hunger and desire
to dwell in him.

S. Austen says upon the Gospel of John, John. 6. 53
that he that does not eat his flesh and drink his blood, has not in him
everlasting life, and he that eats his flesh and drinks his blood, has
everlasting life. But it is not so in those meats which we take to sustain
our bodies, for although without them we cannot live, yet it is not necessary
that whosouer receives them shall live, for they may die by age, sickness
and other chances. But in this meat and drink of the body and blood of our
Lord, it is otherwise, for both they that eat and drink them not, have not
everlasting life. And contrariwise, whosoever eat and drink them, have
everlasting life.

Who do eat and drink the body and flesh of Christ.
They which do believe in Christ, and do assuredly persuade themselves, that
he died for their sakes, they I say, does both eat the flesh of Christ, and
drink his blood, to which use, the Simboles or fignes, for that they stir up
the senses, are very much profitable: not that the flesh and bleud of Christ
are powered into the bread and wine, or are by any means included in those
Elements, but because these things are of the true believers received with a true
faith. For they are an invisible norishment, which is received only in the
mind, as Augustine has faithfully admonished saying: Why preparest thou the
teeth and the belly, believe and thou have eaten. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol.
212.

What it is to eat God.
To eat God, is to have the fruition of the divine nature, and to be
incorporate into God. But the Majesty of God, so far surmounteth the
capacity of man, that as he is in himself in nature and Godhead, no natural
creature is able ot conceive him, but only in the face and sight of Jesus
Christ the son of. God Therefore S. Paul says: Christ is the brightness of
the glory, and the express Image of the substance of God. Jewel. fol. 240.

Of the true sacramental eating, and of the true eating of Christ's body.
The Sacrament (that is to say the Bread) is corporally eaten and chawed with
the teeth in the mouth. The very body is eaten and chawed with faith in the
spirit. Ungodlie men when they receive ye sacrament, they chaw in their mouths
(like unto Judas) the sacramental bread, but they eat not the celestial
bread, which is Christ. Faithful christian people (such as be Christ's true
disciples) continually from time to time record in their mind the beneficial
death of our Savior Christ, chawing it by faith in the cud of their spirit,
and digesting it in their hearts, feeding and comforting themselves with that
heavenly meat. Also they daily receive not the sacrament thereof, and so they
eat Christ's body spirituallie, although not ye sacrament thereof. But when
such men for their more comfort and confirmation of eternal life, given unto
the^ by Christ's death, come unto ye Lords holy Table, then as before, they
fed spirituallie upon Christ, so now they feed corporally also upon the
sacramental bread. By which sacramental feeding in Christ's promises, their
former spiritual feeding is increased, and they grow and wax continually
more strong in Christ, until at the last they shall come to the full measure
and perfection in Christ. This is the teaching of the true Catholic Church, as
it is taught by Gods word. And therefore Saint Paul speaking of them that
unworthily eat, says that they eat the bread, but not that they eat the
body of Christ, but their own damnation. Cranmer. fol. 79.

ETERNAL LIFE.
How Eternal life is sometime called a reward.
Eternal life is sometimes in the holy Scriptures called a reward, but then
it is not that reward, which Paul writes to be given according to debt: but
is all one, as if it should be called a recompensation. Gods will and pleasure
was, that there should be this conjunction: that after good works, should
follow blessedness: but not yet as the effect follows the cause, but as a
thing joined with them by the appointment of God. Therefore we may not trust
unto works, for they are feeble and weak, and do always waver and stagger.
Wherefore the promises of God depend not upon them, neither have they in
themselves as they come from us, that they can move God to make us blessed. We
say therefore, that God judges according, because according as they are
either good or evil, we shall obtain, either eternal life or eternal
damation. But thereby it follows not, that works are the cause of our
salvation. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fo. 39.

EVANGELISTS.
Who be Evangelists.
Evangelists were next unto Apostles, and had their Office much like them;
saving that they were beneath them in degree of dignity. These gave themselves
chiefelie to instructing of the people, and preaching the Gospel to them, as
plainly and simply as might be, of which sort was Timothy and such like. For
although Paul match Timothy with him in doing commendations, yet does he not
make him his follow in Apostleship, but keeps that name peculiarly to
himself. 2. Cor. 1. 1. Col. 1. 1. And in writing to him he says thus: Be
watchful in all things, harden thy self in afflictions, go through with the
work of an Evangelist. 2. Tim. 4. 5.

EVER.
How this word Ever is taken.
ANd to thy seed for ever. Genesis 13. 15
Ever is not here taken for a time without end, but for a long season, that
has not his end appointed. T. M.

Meaning a long time, and till the coming of Christ. And spirituallie, this is
referred to the true Children of Abraham, borne according to the promise, and
not according to the flesh, which are heirs of the true Land of Canaan.
Geneua.

Shall keep it holy for an ordinance for ever. Exo. 12. 14
That is, until Christ's coming, for then Ceremonies had an end. Geneua.

And shall serve him for ever. Exo. 21. 6
That is to the year of Iubile, which was every fitieth year. Deuteronomy. 15. 17.
Leuit. 25. 40. Geneua.

EVCHARIST.
What Eucharist is.
EVcharistia in Latin, is Englished, a Thanksgiving, and is now taken, for
the Sacrament of the Altar. Eliote.

When the Fathers say, that Eucharist is but bread, they speak
hyperbolicallie, and understand that it is not bread only or alone, or
common bread, because unto the bread is added the word of God, whereby it
receives the nature of a Sacrament. And this is a strong reason against the
Anabaptists which have ever in their mouth that saying of Paul unto the
Corinthians: Circumcision and uncircumcision is nothing, but the observation of
the Commandments of God, so they say that Baptime and the Eucharist, and the
Ecclesiastical mystery are nothing, but pretend only the observing of y^
commandments of God. But we answer them, that other things are nothing, if
they be alone without faith and piety and a holy life. Pet. Mar. upon the
Romans fol. 49.

EVTICHAE.
What manner of men they were.
THey were a sect of Heretics Heretic:
called also Psalliani, of whom Epiphanius makes mention contra Massilianos,
and Saint Austen, de haeresibus, who for mumbling up of their long prayers, were
called the praieng heretics (for so sounds the Greek word luk^ea^) They
would never cease praieng and singing of Psalms day and night. And so much
they gave themselves to prayer, that they thought themselves bound to do
nothing else, not to get their living with the sweat of their brows, not to
trouble themselves with any Office that concerned the Commonwealth, not to
study or to put their hand to any kind of labor, but to live in continual
idleness, in only eating, drinkking, sleeping and praieng. Of whom also thus
writes the ancient Greek Author I heodoret: And the miserable wretches
being deceived, give themselves to no kind of work, for they call themselves
spiritual men. But giving themselves to praieng, they sleep the most part of
the day. Pomet. fol. 117.

Eutiches This Eutiches (...) an Abbot of a Monastery in Constantinople about
the year of our Lord. 450.
maintained the opinions of Nestorius, and said that our Lord consisted of two
natures before the ^iuinitie was coupled with the humanity, but after the
uniting of them, to be of one nature, and that the body of Christ, was not of
one substance with ours. The Council of Constantinople deposed him, but he
appealed to Theodosius, and procured the Council of Ephesus to be summoned,
where, Dioscorus the Heretic restored him. Euagr. lib. 1. cap. 9. This
Eutiches being condemned in the Council of Chalcedon, brake out into these
words: This is the faith that I was baptized in, this is the faith that I have
learned of the Fathers, and in this faith will I die. Tom. 2. Council.

EVCHRAITES.
What they were.
EVchraites were Heretics, Heretics
after the Etimologie of their name continent. The Author of their heresy was
Tacianus of Mesopotamia, the disciple of Justinius Martyr. He abhorred marriage,
he forbad the use of living creatures, he offered water in steed of wine in
the Sacrament, he denied that Adam was saved. The Euchraites prevailed in
Pisidia, and Phrigia. Eusebius. lib. 4. cap. 27. Epiphan. haeres. 46. 47.

EVIL MEN.
How far evil men are to be borne withal.
SAint Augustine Augustine
says, the good are not to be forsaken for the evil: but the evil are to be
borne withal for the good. Here ought to be adedd other words, which the same
writer has expreslie in other places, that is, if those evil men do cast
abroad no seeds of false doctrine, nor lead other to destruction by their
example.

How evil men eat not Christ body.
Look. Eating.

EVNOMIVS.
Of his heretical opinions.
EVnomius Bishop of Cyzicum, Heretic.
and the Scribe of Aetius, said, y^ God had no more knowledge then man. He
termed Aetius the man of God, and rebaptised all that came unto him, in the
name of the uncreated God, in the name of the Son created, and in the name of
the sanctifieng Spirit, created of the created Son. Socrat. li. 4. cap. 7.
Theodor. li. 2. cap. 29. Epiph. haeres. 76.

He affirmed moreover, that they which kept the faith that he taught, should be
saved, had they committed never so great a sin, and continued therein. He was
about the year of our Lord. 353.

EVSTACHIVS.
Of his opinions, and how they were condemned.
EVstachius Bishop of Sebastra in Armenia went in such attire as was not decent
for a Priest. Heretic.
He forbad marriage: made laws of fasting, This man was about the year of our
Lord. 324.
he parted married couples asunder. He caused such as refrained the Churches, to
raise Conuenticles at home. He took servant from their masters under color
of religion. He commanded his followers to wear the Philosophers habit. He
caused the women to be shaven. He forbad the accustomed fasting days, and
commanded they should fast on the Sundaie. He detested the prayers of married
men. he abhorred the Offering and Communion of married Priests, not remembering
that his own Father was a Priest, and Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia. He was
first condemned of his own Father in a Council held at Caesarea, afterward
in a Council of Gangra, and last of all at Constantinople. Socrates. lib. 2.
cap. 33.

EXALT.
What it is to exalt or humble a man's self.
Every one that exalts himself shall be brought low, Luk 18. 14
and he that humbles himself, shall be exalted. The Pharisie exalted
himself, thinking himself righteous by his deeds of the Law, which was
nothing at all, and therefore he was brought low by the sentence of damnation.
The Publican humbled himself, acknowledging his sins by lawlie prayer, and
by trust in Gods mercy by Christ, and therefore he was exalted. Hemmyng.

EXAMINE.
How we should examine our selves, before we go to the Lords table.
BUt let a man examine himself, 1. Cor. 11. 28
and so let him eat of this Bread and drink of this Cup. There be three
principal points, the which every man ought to examine and prove himself,
before he go to the Table of the Lord: The first, is true repentance and a
true acknowledging of his offenses and sins, for the which Jesus Christ died,
as he declares unto us, in the same Chapter. The second, is true faith, in the
only grace and mercy of God, which is offered and granted to us in Jesus
Christ and by Jesus Christ, as that Sacrament also testifies. The third, true
Charity and union, toward all the members of Christ Jesus, as it presents
unto us, in that we there eat all of one felfe Bread, and drink of one self
Cup. Viret.

This proving and examining of a man's self, is first to think with himself
with what lust and desire he comes to the Maundie, and will eat that bread,
whether he be sure that he is the child of God, and in the faith of Christ:
and whether his conscience do bear him witness, that Christ's body was
broken for him: and whether the lust he has to praise GOD and thank him with
a faithful heart in the midst of the brethren, do drive him thetherward:
or else whether he do it for the meats sake, or to keep the custom: for
then were it better that he were away. For he that eats or drinks
unworthily, eats and drinks his own damnation, because he makes no
difference of the Lords body. Frith.

Look. Weak and Sick.

We must mark that in this examination, he sends no man to another, but
every man to himself. The Papists bid thee go to an auricular Confessor,
there to confess thy self, to receive absolution, and to make satisfaction
for thy sins, according to the form that is commanded thee. But Paul the
Doctor of the Gentiles, and the vessel of election, speaks not a word of
these things, but says simply: Let a man examine himself, and so let him
eat of that bread, and drink of that Cup, for like as God is the searcher of
the hearts, and requires the inward affection of the mind, and hates
hypocrisy: so none knows what is in the heart of man, or what affections we
bear to Godward, but we our selves do: therefore he wills us our selves, to
examine every thing in our selves: That is to say, he wills every man to
descend into himself, and to examine himself. Bullinger fol. 1109.

Look. Proving.

EXCOMMVNICATION.
What Excommunication is.
IT is the separation and reiection from the holy assembly of our Lord Jesus
Christ, Mat. 18. 15
ye which is done by the Church, against open and obstinate sinners. Tindale.

Excommunication is a censure of the Eldership, whereby he that is guilty of
some most grievous crime, is without any certain prescription of time, shut
from the sacraments, and banished the company of the faithful. This is the
sorest punishment of the Church, which also is called of Saint Paul, a
delivering up to Satan: of Christ to be as an Ethnike and Publicane, which
answers the Jews, cutting them off from the Covenant, so often repeated to
the people of God by Moses. Hereof is often mention made in the new Testament.
John. 9. 18. And 1. Cor. 5. 4. 2. The. 3. 15. and in other places mo. Now
whereas it is so grievous a punishment, it is executed on none, but on him that
is guilty of some heinous trespass, which kind of sins are rehearsed by
Saint Paul. 1. Cor. 5. 11. and 2. Thessa. 3. 14.

Yet count him not as an Enemy, but warn him as a Brother. 2. The. 3. 15
The end of Excommunication, is not to drive from the Church such as have
fallen, but to win them to the Church by amendment. Geneua.

They shall excommunicate you. John. 16. 2.
In that he says, they shall be excommunicated, his meaning is this: They
shall cast you out of their Sinagogues, they shall condemn you of impiety and
heresy, they will refrain you of water and fire, and such necessaries. They
will banish you, and sell your goods, and they will account you not for
Israelites, but for Gentiles and Atheists. For the good as subject, not only
to persecution, but also to ignomie and reproach, even as says the Apostle
Paul. Be thinks that God has set forth us, which are the last Apostles, as
it were men appointed to death: for we are made a gasing stock unto the world,
and to the Angels, and to men. Christ notwithstanding commands to stand
firm and steadfast against this temptation: because, though they be thrust out
of Synagogues, yet nevertheless, they shall abide in the kingdom of God.
Marl. upon John. fol. 527.

What S. Paul meant by the excommunicating of Alexander.
And Alexander, which I have delivered to Satan. 1. Tim. 1. 20.
Whereas Saint Paul says, that he did deliver Alexander and Himeneus unto
Satan, he means none other thing thereby, but that he did excommunicate them
openly as no true Christians, and that he did threaten them (if they would not
repent and turn) that GOD would punish them everlastingly, by Satan and his
Angels. Sir. I. Cheek.

Saint Austen says: What is a man the worse, Augu. de Clericos.
if the ignorance of a man strike him out of the book of the Church, if his
conscience strike him not out of the book of life. In this case (says Saint
Austen) it comes sometimes to pass, that there be many Sheep without the
Church, and many Wolves within the Church.

EXORCISTES.
What the Office of an Exorcist was.
THe Exorcists office was, by a special gift of God, serving only for that

possessed. Jewel. fol. 98.

Face.
What the Face of Christ is.
IN the Face of Jesus Christ. 2. Cor. 4. 6
That is to say, in the knowledge of Jesus Christ, not in the Face of Moses,
which is the knowledge of the Law, for by Christ came we to the knowledge of
God. Tindale.

What the Face of God is.
The face of God is the knowledge of his divine nature, of the which it is
written, Augustine
Show us the light of thy countenance, and we shall be whole, that is: grant
us to know thee. Otherwise Gods face does signify the invisible nature of
Christ's Divinity. Exo. 33. 23. You shall see my hinder parts, but my Face you
cannot see, that is, You shall see Christ's humanity, but his divinity cannot
be seen.

The Face of God is that which is described in ye 26. of Leuiticus: I will
turn my face to you, and I will make you fruitful: I will give you rain in
season, and peace in the earth, the sword shall not come in the Land, if ye will
walk in my statutes and keep my precepts, etc. Plenteousnesse and goodness,
and all Gods benefits, that is Gods face. T. Drant.

What is the Face or countenance of God? It is not a shape like unto a man's
visage, which has nose, eyes and mouth: but the Face of God is the record,
which he gives us, when we know his will. God therefore shows us his Face,
when he tells us why he does this thing or that, and it is all one, as if we
saw him before our Eyes. Contrariwise, he hides his face from us, when he
afflicts us, when things seem strange unto us, and when we know no reason
why he works after that sort. Therefore when God holds us in ignorance, it
is an hiding of his Face from us. Call. upon Job. fol. 629.

Thou may not see my face, for there shall no man see me alive. There shall
no man see my face and live, not that the face of God which is the face of life
is the cause of death to them y^ see it, for the Saints that are in heaven do
indeed see it, but none that lives in the body can see, neither comprehend
the majesty of his face: but must be first purified by death, as Paul
declares it, 1. Cor. 15. 52. Tindale.

How this place following is understood.
Because his face shall be so deformed, and not as man's face. Esa. 52. 14
That is, his face shall be more deformed then other men's: and his beauty
fouler then the beauty of the sons of men. The whole sentence means, that
many men shall be estonied when they shall see Christ our savior (which was
exceeding beautiful before all the sons of men) Psalm. 45. 2. so wickedly and
violently entreated of the Jews, spit upon, scourged, crowned with thorn, and
all be blouded, yea, greatlier humbled, contemned and despised, then ever was
any mortal man. T. M.

FAITH.
What Faith is.
FAith is a sure confidence of things which are hoped for, Heb. 11. 1.
and a certeintie of things which are not seen. Faith and trust in Christ
only, is the life and quietness of the conscience, and not trust in works
how holy so ever they be or appear. Works cannot set ye heart at rest, because
we ever think they be not enough, nor yet good enough, but to few, and so fall
we to mistrusting, after which follows despairing, and so damnation, if we
leave not the confidence in them, and stick to faith, which can receive and
believe without mistrust, that Christ's works on the cross, has full purged,
cleansed, and loosed us from our sins.

Again, Faith is a lively and steadfast trust in the favor of God, wherewith
we commit our selves altogether unto God, and that trust is so surely
grounded, and sticks so fast in our hearts, that a man would not once doubt of
it, though he should die a thousand times therefore, and such trust wrought by
the holy Ghost through faith, makes a man glad, lusty, cheerful, and
true hearted unto God and all creatures, by the means whereof, willingly and
without compulsion, he is glad and ready to do good to every man, to suffer
all things, that God may beloved and praised, which has given him such grace,
so that it is impossibl^ to separate good works from faith, even as it is
impossible to separate heat and burning from fire. Therefore take heed and
beware of thine own fantasies, which to judge of faith and good works, will
se^me wise, when indeed they are stark blind, and of all things most
foolish. Pray God that he will vouthsafe to work faith in thine heart, or
else thou shall remain evermore faithless, feign thou, imagine thou, enforce
thou, wrestle with thy self, and do what thou will.

Again, Faith is the believing of Gods promises, and a sure trust in the
goodness and truth of God, which faith justified Abraham^ Genesis 15. and was the
mother of al his good works, which he afterward did, for faith is the goodness
of all works in the sight of God. Good works are things of Gods commandment,
wrought in faith. And to show a show at the commandment of God to do thy
neighbor service with all, with faith to be saved by Christ (as God promises
vs^) is much better the^ to build an Abbeie of their own imagination, trusting
to be saved, by y^ fained works of hypocrites. Jacob robbed Laban his uncle,
Moses robbed the Aegiptians, and Abraham is about to sley and burn his own
son, and al are holy works because they are wrought in faith at Gods
commandment. To steal, rob, and murder, are no holy works before worldly
people, but unto the^ ye have their trust in God, they are holy when God,
commands them. What, God commands not, gets no reward with God. Holy
works of men's imagination, receive their reward here as Christ testifies.
Math. 6. 2. Tindale.

Faith is an undoubted belief most firmly grounded in the mind. Bullinger.
fo. 30.

Again, True faith is the wel-spring and root of all virtues and good works,
and first of al it satisfies the mind and desire of man, and makes it quiet
and joyful. Bullinger. fol. 54.

How Faith is the ground of all good works.
As a good tree in the time of ye year brings forth good apples, not to
make him good, for he is good before, nor yet this apple is to his own profit,
but unto other men's, notwithstanding ye good nature ye is in him must needs
bring it forth, So like wise y^ just man must needs do good works, not by them
to be justified, but alonelie in them to serve his brother, for he has no need
of the^ concerning justification, This is the very true way and manner of doing
good works, and how ye no man can do goods works, but a justified man, as our
savior Christ says: either make y^ tree good, and then his fruit must be
good, or else the tree evil, and his fruit also evil, for a good tree must
needs bring forth good fruit, and a bad evil fruit. D. Barnes.

How Faith justifies.
The faith of true believers is, ye God justifies or forgiueth, and Christ
deserves it, and the faith and trust in Christ's blood receives it, and
certifieth the conscience thereof, and saves and delivers from fear of
death and dampnation, and this is it ye we mean, when we say faith
justifies, ye faith I mean, in Christ, and not in our own works, certifieth
the conscience ye our sins are forgiven us, for Christ's blood sake. Tindale.
fol. 187.

Again, when I say ye faith justifies, the understanding is, ye faith
receives the justifying: God promises to forgive our sins, and to impute us
for full righteous. And God does justify us actiuely, y^ is to say, forgiueth
us for full righteous, and Christ's blood deserves it, and says in the promiser
receives it, and certifieth the conscience thereof. Faith chalengeth it for
Christ's sake, which has deserved all that is promised, and cleaves ever to
the promise, and truth of the promiser, and pretends not the goodness of the
work, but knowledgeth that our works deserve it not, but are crowned and
rewarded, with the deseruinges of Christ. Take an example of young children,
Example of young children.
when the Father promises them a good thing, for doing of some trifle, and
when they come for their reward, dalyeth with them saying. What, that thou have
done is not worth half so much? Should I give thee so great a thing for so
little a trifle? Ye did promise me, ye said I should have it: why did you
promise, and whie^ did you say so? And let him say what he will to drive them
off, they will even say again, you did promise me, so ye did, you said I
should have it, so ye did: But hirelings will pretend their work and say: I
have deserved it, I have done so much, and my work is worthy it, etc.
Tindale. fol. 225.

That faith the mother of all good works justifies, before we can bring
forth any good work, as ye husband marries his wife, before he can have any
lawful children by her. Furthermore, as y^ husband marieth not his wife ye she
should continue unfruitful as before, Example of the Husband
and as she was in the state of virginity (wherein it was impossible for her to
hear fruit) but contrariwise to make her fruitful: even so faith justifies
us not, that is to say, marries us not unto God, that we should continue
unfruitful as before, but ye he should put his seed of his holy spirit in us
(as S. John in his first Epistle calls it) and to make us fruitful. For,
says Paul, Ephe. 2. 8. For by grace are ye made safe through faith, and that
not of our selves, for it is the gift of God, and comes not of works, least
any man should boast himself. For we are his workmanship created in Christ
Jesus unto good works, which God has ordained that we should walk in them.
Tin. fol 59.

But who shall glory of his own righteousness, when he hears God by his
Prophet saying, Origin.
That all your righteousness is like a most filthy defiled cloth. The only
true glorieng therefore is in the faith of the cross of Christ, which
excludes all that glorieng, which descends of the works of the law. Origin
in his 13. book ad Romans

We think that a man is justified by faith, Hierome
without the works of the law. For because there is one God which justifies
circumcision of the law, and uncircumcision of faith. It manifestly shows,
that righteousness is not in ye merit of man but in the grace of God, who
without the works of the law, accepts the faith of them that believe.
Again, In li^ ^. contra Ecudem he says thus: ^unc ergo iusti sumus, etc.
Therefore we are then righteous, when we confess our selves sinners. And our
righteousness stands not upon our own merit, but upon the merit of God.
Hicrome li. 2. contra Pelag.

We be not justified by works, A^ brose
but by faith. For the weakness of the flesh is a let unto works, but the
brightness of faith shadoweth the error of deeds which des^rueth pardon of
sins. Only faith.
S. Ambrose ^de Iacobo. Cap. 21.

For the thief believed and was justified by the most merciful God: Chrisosto^
And here say not unto me that he lacked time to live vprightlie, and to do
good works, for I contend not about that, but this only I steadfastly
affirm, that only faith Only faith
by it self saved him. Chrysostom de fide and lege.

How faith is the work of God.
Faith is the work of God, and it comes of God, as Saint John says: This is
the work of God, then you should believe in him, Saint Paul witnesses the
same, saying. Philip. 1, ^9. Not only it is given to you, that ye should
believe in God, but also y^ ye should suffer for hi^ sake. Of this it is an
evident saieug, living or dead, not to have had faith of themselves, or of
their own might ^ power, but to have received it of God, which gives faith to
whom he will, and when he will, although S. Paul says, Faith to come by
hearing of the word of God, which word although many may hear it, yet no
man shall believe, but he to whom God gives faith, and in whom God works
faith and love. Bibliander upon the expos. of ^ude.

What faith is without works.
What avails it my brethren, ^amos. ^. 14.
y^ man say he has faith, when he has no deeds? Can faith save him. Can faith
save him. S. James speaks not here of true faith, which by love is mighty in
operation, but of the vain imagination and opinion y^ the unthankful people
have of faith, and therefore he does call it dead faith, because there follow no
good works of it, as there do of the faith that justifies in the sight of God.
To be justified here, and in all the Chapter over is to be counted just, and
that before the world, as in Luke. 10. 29 and 16. 15. and not to be made just
in the sight of God. So that when he says, was not Abraham Abraham
our Father justified through works, etc. signifies thus much, was not Abraham
our Father by his works declared just: That is, did not his works declare and
show that he was just, and were sure tokens or his righteousness, it
signifies that Abraham was by his works made just before God, reputed
righteous obtained remission of sins, for by Faith he came thereby, not by
works, as witnesses S. Paul. Romans 4^2. Tindale.

Will thou understand D thou vain man, that faith without deeds is vain,
James. ^. 20.
was not our Father Abraham justified of his deeds, when he offered his son
Isaac on the Alter, etc. Whereas Saint James brings that Abraham was justified
by offering his son I^^ac, that is clean contrary, as many as do take it.
First unto Moses whereas the very original is. For it is openly declared,
Genesis 15. 6. where these words were spoken of Abraham: Abraham did believe, and
it was reputed unto him for justification, where there is no word of Isaac, for
he was neither yet ^orn nor promised, and yet must Abraham needs be justified,
for the holy Ghost says it. And when the words were spoken unto him, he was
at the most but 86. years old, as it is declared in the. 16. Chapter, verse.
16. But when Isaac was promised him by name, then was Abraham. 99. years old,
as it is open in the. 17. Chapter, and the year after was Isaac borne And when
Isaac was borne, was Abraham. 100. year old, as it is plain in the. 21. 5.
Now would I know that, where that Abraham was justified from that he was 86.
year old, till he was an hundred year old, you cannot say by offering up of
Isaac, for you see he is not borne. D. Barnes.

Therefore by faith is the inheritance given, Romans 4. 16.
that it might come of favor, and the promise might be sure to all the seed.
Therefore by faith, etc. Therefore are ye pronounced righteous by faith, by
which understand even the mercy of God received by faith, that the conscience
might be surely certified, of the will of God, and of the promises of the
Gospel, that is, of remission of sins, of reconciliation or reputation of
righteousness, and of the gift of everlasting life, that these things
cleerelye be performed, which were not possible if the promise should depend
and hang on our works. For then shall the conscience be unsure, doubting
whether we had works enough, whether God would be merciful, whether the law
which we have trangressed would condemn us, etc. Now when doubtfulnesse
remains in us, there remains also fearefulnes by which comes desperation
and death, for so long as the law shows us the anger of God, fear of death
cannot be overcome. Therefore must we needs stick only to faith in the
merciful promises of God, surely certified, and they shall be fulfilled,
although our works have not deserved the fulfilling of them. Tindale.

Of faith and deeds. And how Saint Paul and James do agree therein.
Ye see then, James. 2^ 24.
how that of deeds a man is justified, and not of faith only. Ye see then ye
a man is justified, etc. That is, is declared just, is openly known to be
righteous, like as by the fruits, the good tree is known to be good;
otherwise may not this sentence be interpreted. For there could nothing be
more foolish then this saying of James, if a man would thus interpret it, that
no man obteineth remission of sinne^, but because his works are worthy of so
great a benefit. This interpretation who so sticks frowardlie by,
understands not what remission of sins is, or how the conscience ought to
be comforted, when it sees that it brings no good works to God, which are
sufficient to please him. And this interpretation is clean contrary to other
open saiengs of the Scripture, which teach y^ remission of sins comes freely,
as y^ Psalmist says: I said I will acknowledge mine offense, Psalm. 32. 5.
and accuse my self unto ye Lord, and thou forgauest me y^ wickedness of my
sin. And To. 4. 5. To him ye works not, but believes on him y^ justifies y^
ungodly, his faith is cou^^ed for righteousness. What can be more plainly, then
y^ sins are forgive to a wicked and ungodly man y^ works not, y^ is, not
for any of his works, but freely. To conclude, if ye gospel forgive not sins,
but for our good works sake, and for our worthiness it diffe reth not from y^
law, it saves no more the^ y^ law: this I trust will suffice y^ good and wise.
For as touching them y^ bring nothing to this cause but a will to brawle and
chide, will never suffer themselves to be satisfied. And yet if we would contend
by ye number of authorities, this one place of James is overthrown with many
witnesses of Paul, if men will understand by justification al one thing in the^
both. Therefore Paul says, Faith justifies, understand thereby y^ faith
causes y^ we be counted just, reputed righteous, and that our sins are not
imputed unto us, but forgiven us for. Christ's sake. When James says, works
justify, he means thus Works declare us just, and show euidentlye, that we
are righteous. Thus shall thou make them agree. Tindale.

Ye shall understand y^ S. Paul and S. James be not contrary in this matter.
For Paul to y^ Romans and Galathians, disputes against them which
attributes justification to good works. And James reasons against them which
utterly condemn works. Therefore Paul shows the cause of our
justification, and James the effects. In Paul is declared how we are
justified: in James how we are known to be justified. In Paul, works are
excluded, as not y^ cause of our justification: in James they are approved as
effects proceeding thereof. In Paul they are denied to go before them that be
justified: in James they are said to follow them that are justified. Geneua.

Join y^ liu^ly faith of S. Paul, with ye good works of S. James, and bring
both these into one life: and then have thou reconciled them both, and so shall
thou be sure to be justified both before God by Paul's faith, and before men by
S. James works. I. Fox.

How Faith is nourished.
If Faith as it is written come by hearing, Romans 10. 17
that is, as it is added by the word of God, then follows it of necessity,
that there is nothing, whereby faith is more nourished, maintained, and
confirmed, then by con^tinuall reading and repeating of the word of GOD. This
thi^^ testified Tertulian in his Apology, where he says, That to this end
holy assemblies are gathered together to hear the word of God. The
Philosophers say, that if faith be by the word of God, then by the same also
it is nourished. We know moreover, that of works often repeated are confirmed
habits or qualities, as contrariwise if a man cease off from actions, they wax
weak, wherefore if a man cease to read, to hear, or to repeat the holy
Scriptures, faith will wax feeble m^him. And they which think that a lively
and pure faith may continue in Churches wou^ often preaching, do exceedingly
err. Chrifostome has a very apt similitude of a light or Lamp that burns,
Similitude of a Lamp.
which easily goes out, unless there be still^ Oil powered into it. By the
Lamp or Light, he vnderstandth Faith, and by Oil the word of God^ and this
he there writes of the Parable of the wise and foolish virgins. Pet. Man upon
the Rom fol 326.

Faith is nourished by hearing the word of God, for the word of God is the
foot of Faith, according to Saint Paul's saying. Romans 10. 17. Faith comes by
hearing. Hemmyng.

How Faith without Charity is nothing worth.
If I had all Faith, 3. Cor. 13. 2
so that I could move mountains out of their places, (...) had no charity, I
were nothing. Of this do some ga^her that ^aith without charity cannot
justify. But this cannot be gathered of Saint Paul, for it is open that he
speaks not of this thing whereby that men may be justified, but only he
te^heth how they y^ be justified must work with charity. It is (...) that he
speaks not of faith that does justify (...) but of that faith that does
work out wardlie, the which is called the gift of the holy Ghost, as the gift
of tongues, the gift of prophesies, the gift of healing, the gift of
interpretation, as it is open in the Chapter before, now is this Faith not
given to justify, but only to do miracles, wonders, and signs by. And
therefore says Paul, If I had all faith so that I could move mountains, etc.
Saint Paul deser^^eth this faith, calling it faith that works by charity,
not that it justifies by charity, for he says there plainly, it is neither
circumcision nor uncircumcision y^ is of valor in Christ Jesus, but faith. He
does here plainly exclude from justification, the highest work of the law,
Circumcision, and sets faith alone, not the gift of faith that does
miracles, but the gift of faith that works by charity. D. Barnes.

Faith is here taken for the gift of doing miracles, which the wicked may have
Mat. 7. 22. and also for that faith (called historical) which believes the
mighty power of Christ, but cannot apprehend Gods mercy through him, and this
devils have, James 2. 19. and therefore is separated from charity, but the
faith y^ justifies in effect cannot. As. 1. John. 2. 9. Mat. 17. 20. Geneua.

How faith ^gendereth charity.
That which the schoolmen teaches, y^ charity is before faith and hope, is
a madness, It is faith y^ first ingendereth charity in us: how more rightly
does Barnard teach, I believe (says he) y^ the testimony of conscience, which
Paul calls the glory of y^ godly, consists in three things. For first of
al it is necessary to believe y^ thou can not have forgiveness of sins, but
by y^ pardon of god: Then y^ thou can have no good works at all, unless he
also give it: last of all, that thou can by no works deserve eternal life,
unless it be given thee also freely. A little after be adds y^ these things
suffice not, but y^ there be a certain beginning of faith, because in
believing y^ sins cannot be forgiven but of God, we ought also believe y^
they are not forgiven us, till also we be persuaded by the testimony of the
holy Ghost y^ salvation is laid up in store for us, because God forgiueth sins,
he himself gives merits, and he himself gives rewards, that we may not ^aie
still in this beginning. Call. in his Insti. 3. b. chap. 2. Sect. 4.

From faith to faith, what it is.
For by it, the righteousness of God is known, Romans 1. 17^
from faith to faith. From faith to faith, y^ is, from an imperfect faith, to a
perfect faith: from a weak faith to a strong faith, or from one battle of
faith to an other. For as we have escaped one ieoperdie through faith, an other
inuadeth us, through which we must wade, by the help of faith also. Tindale.

How the faith that saved the old fathers, shall save us.
Look Abraham.

How Faith is a work.
Faith is a work, therefore (will some say) we be justified by works: but y^
answer of the which so say, avails not, because love also and other virtues
be the works of God, yet are we not justified by them. The mayor is not so to
be understood, we be not justified by faith, because it is a work or quality
in us, but because it leans upon mercy, and receives mercy. And this
saying, we be justified with faith, must be understood by the way of a
comparison, that is to say, by mercy we be pronounced just, but it must be
received with faith. Although then faith be a work or new quality in us, yet
we be not justified by the worthiness thereof, for this faith is as yet
imperfect, like as other virtues be, but we be justified by that thing,
whereupon faith leans, and the which faith receives that is to say, for
Christ's sake.

Out of a book called the Sum of Divinity. Of Faith before works.
Look Cornelius.

How Faith is perfect
Faith is perfect when it receives and takes hold of Christ perfect: And,
yet it has need of increasement, to the intent it may become full in all his
parts. The man that said, Mar. 9. 24.
Lord I believe, had perfect faith, and yet was it great^^e increased
afterward. Likewise Peter had a perfect faith, when he said, John. 6. 68.
Lord whether shall I go, etc. Which faith of Peter was much more increased,
after he had received the holy Ghost at Whitsontide, etc.

How Faith overcomes the world.
Faith is not an idle assent or thought, but it is a stout Gyaunt, which (as
Saint John says) overcomes the world, ^. John. 5. 4
but how; Even through the conqueror Christ, which it possesses.

How Faith and invocation are inseparable.
No man comes to Christ, as to a Savior, nor calls upon him, but he that
believes upon him, for like as no man believes, but he that hears, so no
man calls upon him but he that believes. Romans 10. 17. Faith and invocation
are so knitte together, that ye may sooner separate the heat from the fire,
then pluck them asunder one from an other. Hemmyng.

How Faith is called the marriage Garment.
Faith in Christ's blood makes the marriage between our souls and Christ,
and is properly called the marriage garment, or the sign Thau. Tindale.

Of Faith, Love, and Hope. Objection.
If Faith, Love, and Hope, be three virtues inseparable, then faith only
justifies not.

Answer.
Though Faith, 1. Cor. 13. 13
Hope, and Love be three virtues inseparable in this life, yet have they
separable and sundry offices in effects. As heat and dries be inseparable
in the fire, have yet their separable operations: for the dries only
expels the moistness of all that is consumed in the fire, and heat only
destroieth all coldenesse, for dries and cold may stand together, and so
may heat and moistness. It is not all one to say, the dries only, and the
dries that is alone. Nor all one to say, Faith only, and Faith that is
alone.

The office of Faith.
Faith only which is a sure and undoubted trust in Christ, and in the father
through him, certifieth the conscience that the sin is forgiven, and the
dampnation and imposibilitie of the law taken away, etc. And with such
persuasions mollifieth the heart, and makes her love GOD again and his law.
And as often as we sin, Faith only keeps us, that we forsake not our
profession, and that love utterly quench not, and hope fail, and only
makes the peace again. For a true believer trusts in Christ only, and not
in his own merits or works, or ought else, for the remission of sins. Tindale.

What one man's faith does profit in other. Objection.
When as Christ by the faith of the hearers healed the man sick of the palsy,
it is demanded of some in this place of Matthew, Math. 9. 2.
what one man^ faith does profit an other.

Answer.
First of all we know for certain, that the faith of Abraham did profit his
posterity, when as he embraced y^ covenant and promise, made to him and his
seed. The like we ought to judge in all the faithful, because by their faith
they spread out the grace of God to their children and posterity, and that
before they be borne. And also the same takes place in children and young
infants, who for want of age are not apt to have faith. But they which are ripe
of years, whose faith is insufficient whether they be strangers or of y^ same
line or kindred, an other man's faith (in respect of the eternal salvation of
the soul) does nothing profit them but only mediate. Marl. fol. 173.

And when Jesus saw the faith of them. Math. 9. 2.
And also his faith ye had the palsy: for except we have faith, our sins
cannot be forgiven. Geneua.

That the faithful may pray for me, and offer me unto God with their
faithful prayers, yet unless I have faith my self, I cannot be saved: for the
righteous lives with his own faith. Abac. 2. 4. Romans 1. 17. Sir I. Cheek.

The Centurion believed, Math. 8. 13
and his servant was healed. Of this we may learn, y^ the godly by their faith
may obtain corporal benfits for other, but to be saved with eternal
salvation by an other man's faith, it cannot be, for no man can be saved without
his own faith. Hemmyng.

Again, As one man by his wisdom, may make an other man prove wise: so he y^
believes may by his faith obtein faith for other men. But as no man is wise by
another man's wisdom but by his own, so is no man saved by an other man's
faith, but by his own. Hemmyng.

How faith is taken in these places following.
If I had all faith, so that, etc. Here faith is taken for the power to do
miracles. ^. Cor. 13. 2.
For when faith is taken for that assured trust in God, through the blood of
Jesus Christ, it can in no wise be without charity and love. Sir I. Cheek.

Faith is here taken for y^ use of doing miracles, which ye wicked may have,
as Mat. 7. 22. and also for y^ faith called historical, which believes y^
mighty power of Christ, but cannot apprehend gods mercy without him. And this
devils have. James. 2. 19. and therefore is separate from charity, but the
faith that justifies in effect cannot. As. 1. John. 2. 9. Geneua.

Have thou faith, Romans 14. (...)
have it with thy self before God. He speaks to him, says Origin, which
knows and believes that all kind of meats are now free through Christ. Let
him use this his faith toward God, and give thanks to him. And let him not by
reason of his faith, campell an other man to eat with a wavering and resisting
conscience. And let the same man have his ^aith with himself, and let him not
boast of it to the hurt of his neighbor. Neither let him with overmuch
licenciousnesse use what meats he list. Paul seems by a certain, preuencion
to answer to those which said, they would live freely, and defend the faith
which they had received, Paul answers, have thou this faith before God, and
keep it to thy self. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans for. 441

Faith here is taken for a full persuasion of the christian liberty, in
things indifferent, as the Apostle interprets it in the 14. verse where he
says: I know and am persuaded through the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing
unclean of it self, but unto him that judges any thing to be unclean, to
him it is unclean. Geneua.

If ye have says like ^graine of mustard seed, Mat. 17. 20^
etc. But least any man should by and by gather (as certain perverse men do)
that whosoever has faith as a grain of mustard seed, may remove mountains,
and do all things else, and say, we believe therefore, that we are able (...)
all things, yea, if need be to remove mountains, and also to cast out evil
spirits, we must note of what faith the Lord speaks here: let us understand
therefore, y^ there are three kinds of faith. Three kinds of Faith.
The first, is that by the which certain things are believed to be such as
they are declared to be in the Scriptures. As in Scripture, we here y^ there is
one God, being omnipotent and the creator of all things, this faith is called
an historical faith. The second, is y^ which we believe the promises of God,
and apprehend y^ mercy and grace of God in Christ Jesus: this faith is said to
be a justifying faith. The third is that by ye which a man does firmeli^
believe that there is nothing impossible unto God and the mind armed by a
certain inspiration of the spirit, to do marvelous things, and this is
called the faith of miracles. The first kind of faith is most general,
insomuch y^ it per^e^eth even to ye wicked, with ye which faith also Satan is
endued, as appears by the words of the Apostle: Iam. 2. 19.
Thou beleeuest that there is one God; thou do well, the devils also believe
and tremble. The second kind of faith, per^eineith only to ye elect and
chosen of God, as witnesses ye Apostle Paul in his Epistle to Titus, by the
which faith we are made members of Christ's bod^, Titus. 3. 5^
and are saved: Of this ^aith Christ speaks not here, neither do al they ye
have the same, w^^^ miracles straight way. The third kind of ^aith perleineth
so certain christians, and that not at all times, but it has a certain
consideration also. This faith may also be called a particular of special
faith, and it is no doubt a singular gift of the holy Ghost, as S. Paul
teaches saying: To some faith is given by the same spirit, the which truly
cannot be said of ye justifying faith, which pertains not to a certain
only, but unto all the elect and chosen of God. This faith saves no man,
neither does it change the hearts of men, and therefore it is such a faith as is
also given unto ye wicked, and therefore we have alredie heard in the 7. chapter
going before, how the wicked at the day of judgment shall say unto Christ:
Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and by thy name cast out
devils, and done many miracles in thy name? To whom it shall be answered, I
never knew you: depart fro^me ye ye work iniquity. And in an other place ye
Apostle says: If I had all faith, so ye I could remove mountains, and have no
love, it is nothing: Of this faith Christ speaks here. where he says. If ye
have faith like a grain of mustard seed. Mar. fo. 387.

Of the faith of lnfants.
Indeed (says S. Austen Augustine
) albeit ye faith which does consist in the will of the believers, do not make
the child, faithful, yet ye sacrament of ye faith does make him ^aithfull,
for it is answered, that he does believe, so he is called also faithful, not by
censenting in mind to the matters itself, but by receiving the sacrament of
the very same matter and effect, Faith of Infants.
And in an other place he says: This word of says, is of so great strength in
ye church of Christ, ye it does cleanse the infant by him that does believe,
offer, bless, and w^^h him never so little, although he (...) not yet able to
believe in heart to righteousness, and to confess in mouth unto saluat^^,
Thus ^^saith he, Epi. 2^. ad ques. Bonifac^^.

Wha^ the faith of hypocrites is.
The faith of hipocrits Faith of hypocrites
is, y^ god forgiueth and works deserves: and ye same false faith in their
own works, raineth ye mercy promised to the merits of their own works, and so
is Christ utterly excluded. Tindale, fol. 187.

Of two manner of faiths^
There be two manner of faiths, an historical faith, and a feeling ^aith The
historical faith hangs of the truth and honesty of the tel^er or of the
common fame and consent of many. 2. Faithes.
As if one had told me the Turk had won a cidie and I believed ^o, moved
with the honesty of thelm^n. Now if ^here come another y^ seems more honest
or that has better (...), that it is not so, I think immediately ye he lied.
and so loose my faith again. And a feeling faith is, as if a man were there
present, when it were won, and there were wounded, and had there lost all y^ he
had, and were taken prisoner there also^ that man should so believe, that all
the world could not turn him from his faith. Tindale. fol. ^66.

A comparison between Faith and Incrudelitie.
Faith is ye root of all good: Incrudelitie is ye root of al evil Faith makes
God and man friends: Incrudelitie makes them foes. Faith brings god and man
togethers: Incrudelitie sundreth the^. All ye faith does pleases God: All ye
incrudelitie both disuleseth God. Faith only makes a man god and (...) (...)
only makes him unjust and evil. Faith makes a man a member of Christ:
Incrudelitie makes him a member of y^ devil. Faith makes a man y^ inheritour
of heaven: Incrudelitie makes him y^ inheritour of hell, faith makes a man y^
servant of God: Incrudelitie makes him y^ servant of y^ devil. Faith shows
(...) God to be a sweet father: Incrudelitie shows him to be a terrible
Judge. Faith holds (...) by y^ word of God: Incrudelitie wauereth here and
there faith counts and boldeth God to be true: Incrudelitie holds him false
and a liar. Faith knows God: Incrudelitie knows him (...). Faith loves
both God and his neighbor: Incrudelitie loves neither of them faith only
saves us: Incrudelitie only condemns us. Faith extolleth God and his deeds:
Incrudelitie extolleth her self, and her own deeds.

Of only faith.

FALL.
How Christ is the fall and vprising of many.
Behold this child is appointed for the fall and rising again of many in
Israel. Luke 2. 34.
To be the fall of the reproba^e, which perish through their own default, and
raising up of the elect, to whom God gives faith. Geneua.

Objection.
How is Christ (will some say) a fall to y^ unbelievers, which are already
cast away.

Answer.
The ungodly do perish two manner of ways: first they are lost through their
own unbelief, and secondly, for that they wilfully deprive themselves of ye
salvation that is offered unto them by Christ. As if a man that is once
condemned of theft, should afterward not regard the kings son that sueth for
his par^^, but utterly ^espi^e y^ deliverance offered by him. Hemmyng.

FALSE.
Of false Christ's.
Many shall come in my name, Mat. 24. 5
and say that I am Christ. Josephus makes mention in his 20. book, and the
12. chapter of a certain Aegiptian which was a false Prophet, who in his own
opinion thinking himself to be a prophet, gathered almost thirty thousand
together, whom when he brought out of ye wilderness of the mount of Olives or
Oliuet, he went about to take Jerusalem, but they were oppressed by Felix the
president at that time, of ye which Felix there is mention made in the. 21 of ye
Act. Lastlie^ the same Josephus writes of another also, which promised the
people quietness and rest from all evils, if they would follow him into the
desert. By many such were ye people of ye Ie^ws mocked and deceived, al which
as they promised liberty and salvation of ye people, so they affirmed y^ they
were Christ's. And under this name they ^ossed the themselves also, for ye true
and promised (...), of who^ y^ prophets and scriptures testifies. Such one was
Simon Magus, which persuaded the Samaritanes that he was the power of God,
which was called great. Look Teudas, who was such another. Marl. fol. 557.

What the false Prophets are.
Beware of false Prophets, which come unto you in sheep clothing, Mat. 7. 15.
but inwardly they are ravening Wolves, etc. False Prophets are Preathers that
^eruert and wrest the word of God: Sheep ^innes signify the appearaunce of
outward holiness: Ravening Wolves are Tyrants that delight in persecuting, and
shedding of blood. Tindale.

False Prophets shall ever impugn the faith of Christ's blood, and enforce to
quench the true understanding of the law, and the right meaning and intent of
all the works commanded by God, which fight is a fight above all fights.
First, they shall be in such number, that Christ's true Disciples shall be but a
small stock in respect of them. They shall have works like Christ, so that
fasting, prayer, poverty, obedience and chastity, shall be the names of their
profession. For as Paul says to the Corinthians. The Angels or messengers of
Satan, shall change themselves into the Angels or messengers of light and
truth. They shall come in Christ's name, and that with signs and miracles and
have the upper hand also, even to deceive the very elect if it were possible.
Yea, and beyond all this, if thou get the victory of the false Prophets, and
pluck a multitude out of their hands, there shall immediately rise up of the
same and set up a new false sect against thee. And against all those
Amalechites the only remedy is to lift up the hands of thy heart to God in
continual prayer, which hands if thou for weariness oncelet fall, thou go
to the worse immediately. Tin. fo. 239.

FAN.
What the Fan is.
Whose Fan is in his hand, etc. Which is the preaching of the Gospel, Mat.
3. 12.
whereby he gathers the Faithful as good Corn, and scatters the Infidells
as Chafe. Geneua.

Another Expositor says thus: The Fan is Gods word: The Flower is the people
of Israel, the Garner is the kingdom of Heaven ^ By the Wheat he
understands: the elect and true Israelit^s, by the Chafe he understands
the unfaithful.

FARE FAIR WITH MEN.
How this place is understood.
Seeing then that we know the fear of the Lord, we fare fair with men. 2. Co.
5. 11
We fare fair with men, that is, we play not the Tyrants with cursings and
excommunications, neither use we violence malitioustie among the people, but
feate God, and entreat the people lovingly, to draw them unto God. Tindale.

FARTHING.
What this Farthing means
THou shall not go thence, till thou have paid the last Farthing. Mat. 5. 26.
Christ's meaning is, that he shall never come out^ for that he must evermore
pay the last farthing, while he ^u^fereth everlasting punishment for his
sins committed in this world. Hier, (...). b. cha. 1. upon the Lam. of Ierem.
I. North bridge.

And that some make Purgatory of the last Farthing, they show their deep
ignorance. For first no similitude holds every word and syllable of the
similitude. Furthermore when they dispute, till he pay the last farthing, Ergo
he shall pay, but not in Hell, Ergo in Purgatory, a wise reason. Joseph knew
not Marie, till she had borne his first son, Ergo she bare the second, or he
knew hi^ afterward. I will not forgive thee till I be dead, nor while I live,
Ergo I will do it after my death. And a thousand like. Tin. fol. 204.

FASTING.
A Definition of Fasting.
FAsting was a certain discipliue and measurable castigation or cha^^isoment
of the body, always used of the ancient fathers and Saints of God, usurped,
to this end, that the substance of heavenly things, might the more be
inflamed, and that the fleshly desires of the body, might the more be
quenched. Marl. fol. 126.

What true Fasting is.
True fasting (says Basile Basile.
) consists in freeness from ^ites, in continency of tongue, in suppressing
of anger, in cutting off concupiscence, back biting, lie^g, and perjury, etc.

True fasting is a religious work, ordained to testify our humlitie, and to
make the flesh make obedient unto the spirit, that we mai^ be the quicke^ to
pray, (...) to all good works. Jewel. fol. 15.

Look Abstinence.

The true use of fasting, which is spoken of in holy Scripture, is the taming
and subduing of the flesh, thereby either to be the better disposed (...)
^ditation, and to those prayers which thou offere^^ to God, or else for
a^estimonie of humbleness, at such time as thou confessest thy faults before
God himself. F. N. B. the Italian.

Fasting is to abstain from surfeiting, or overmuch eating, from drunkenness
and care of this world, as thou may read. Luke. 21. 34. And the ^n^e of
fasting is to tame the body, that the spirit may have a free course to God,
and may quietly talk with God. For overmuch eating and drinking and care of
worldly business, press down the spirit, choke her, tangle her, that she
cannot lift up her self to God: now he that fasteth for any other intent,
then to subdue the body, that the spirit may wait on God, and freely
exercise her self in the things of God, the same is blind and woteth not what
he does, erreth and shoots at a wrong mark, and his intent and imagination
is abominable in the sight of God. When thou fastest from meat and drink all
day, is that a christian fast: either to eat at one meal, that were
sufficient for four. A man at four times may bear that that he cannot do at
once. Some fast from meat and drink, and yet so tangle themselves in worldly
business, y^ they cannot once think on God. Some abstain from butter, some
from eggs, some from all manner of white meat, some this day, some that
day, some in the honor of this saint, some of that, and every man for a
sundry purpose. Some for the toothache, some for y^ headache, for fevers,
pestilence, for sudden death, for hanging, drowning and to be delivered from
the pains of hell. Some are so mad, that they fast one of the Thursoaies,
between the two S. Mary's days, in the worship of that Saint, whose day is
hallowed betweene^ Christmas and Candelmas. All these men fast without
conscience and God, and without knowledge of the true intent of fasting, and do
none oth^^^ ^^onour Saints as the Gentiles and Heathen worshipped their Idols,
and are drowned in blindness, and know not of the Testament, that God has made
to man-ward in Christ's blood. In God have they neither hope nor confidence
neither believe his promises, neither know his will, but are yet in captivity,
under the Prince of darkness. Tindale. fol. 80

Fasting stands not in eating and drinking only, and much less in flesh
alone, but in abstinence of all that moves the flesh against the spirit, as
long sleeping, idleness and filthy communication, and all worldly talking,
as of covetousness and promotion and such like, and wanton company, and soft
clothes and soft beds, and so forth. Which are that right hand and right
eye, that must be cut off and plucked out, that the whole man perish not.

Objection.
Some man will say, seeing fasting is to withdraw all pleasures from the
body, and to punish the flesh, then God delights in our pains taking.

Answer.
God delights in true obedience, and in all that we do at his
commandment, and for the intent he commanded it for. If thou love and pity
thy neighbor and help him, thine alms is acceptaple. If thou do it of vain
glory to have the praise that belongs to God, or for a greater profit
only, or to make satisfaction for thy sins past, and to dishonor Christ's
blood which had made it already: then is thine alms abominable. If thy
prayer be thanks in heart, or calling to God for help, with trust in him
according to his promise, then thy prayer pleseth. If thou believe in Christ's
blood for the remission of sins, and henceforth hate sin, that thou
punishest thy body to slaie the lusts, and to keep them under, that thou
sin not again, then it pleases God exceedingly. But and if thou think
that God delights in thy work for the work it self, the true intent away,
and in thy pain, for the pain it self: thou art as far our of the way, as
from heaven to the earth. If thou would kill thy body, or when it is tame
enough punish it farther, that thou were not able to serve God and thy
neighbor, according to the room and estate that thou^a^^ in, thy Sacrifice
were clean without falt and altogether unsavory in the ta^^e of God, and thou
mad and out of thy wit. But and if thou trust in thy work, thou art then
abominable. Tindale. fol. 229.

How it is not appointed in Scripture, upon what da^es we ought to fast.
Saint Austeni^^^th Augustine Epist. 86.
Quibus die bus oporte^t ioiunare, etc. Upon what days we ought not to fast,
and upon what day we ought to fast, I find it not appointed by any
commandment, either of our Lord, or of the Apostles. Jewel. fol. 197.

Who first prescribed la^ves of fasting.
Eusebius in his 5. book and. 16. chapter says, that Montanus the Heretic,
was the first that prescribed laws of fasting.

How the Maniches fast and the Papists, were much alike.
The Maniches (of whom S. Austen testifies) under the color of abstinence,
refrained from any living thing, and from drinking of wine, yet did they (...)
pamper themselves with delicate fruits and spices, with drink made of the
^uice of Dates: which fast was much like to our Papists fast.

How Fasting is of three sorts.
Fasting is an outward for bearing of meat and drink for a time, 3. sorts of
Fasting.
whereby the body is kept lewe, and as it were mortified. And it is of three
sorts, indifferent, godly and ungodly. The indifferent Fast is, when a man
abststaineth, either for poverty, or for health sake, etc. The godly fast is
not only an abstinence from meat and drink, but also from all other things
that may delight or provoke the flesh to sin. The ungodly Fast, is an
abstinence from certain kind of meats, which of it self is thought to be a
worshipping of God, and a thing acceptable to God for the works sake, and
therefore also meritorious, etc.

And this hypocritical Fast, is it that the Prophet does condemn. Hemmyng.

The manner of Fasting in the old time.
I caused a Fast to be proclaimed, 1. Esd. 8. 23
etc. Fasting as the Scripture makes mention, have been common, humiliations
and supplications done before God, either for some great tribulation suffered,
Fast in the old time.
or coming at hand, or for a singular repentance, and earnest fore-thinking
of their sins, as it is written. 1. Reg. 7. 6. and. 31. 13. 2. Esd. 1. 4.

When Iehoakim King of Judah heard that the King of Babilons army was coming
to besiege Jerusalem, he appointed a solemn and public fast for all the
people, commanding them to resort unto the Temple at the tune appointed, and
there to make their humble prayers unto God for peace a^n his favor, as the
manner of Gods people was in all their distresses, to fast and pray in
faithful repentance. Iere. 36. 6. The Bible note.

Against supersticious Fasting.
Behold, Esai. 58. 4
when ye fast, your lusts remains still. This fast remains yet among the
christen, for true chastening of the body and abstaining from vice,
Superstitious fasting.
will we yet neither understand nor hear of, but still think with the Jews,
that we do God a great pleasure when we fast, and also that we then fast^ when
we abstain from one thing, and fill our bellies with another. And verelie in
this thing does our superstition exceed the superstition of the Jews: for we
never read that they ever took it for a fast, to abstain from flesh, and eat
either fish or white meat (as they ca^^ it.) T. M.

Quid prodest oleo, Hierom ad Nes.
etc. What avails it to eat no oil, and with pain and much ado curiously to
seek for Nelits, figs, pepper, nuts, dates, fine white bread, honnie and
Pistacia? Besides this I hear say, there be some, which contrary to ye common
order and nature of men, will neither drink water nor eat bread, but seek for
delicate suppings, and herbs shred togethers, and the juice of Beetes, and
receive y^ same, not out of a cup, but out of a shell, fie for shame, do we not
blu^h at such foolishness? Are we not weary of such superstition? And yet
beside all this, living in such curious delicacie, we look to be praised for
our fasting.

How hypocrites will have their fasting accepted.
Wherefore have we fasted, Esai. 58. 3
and thou see it not. He sets forth the malice and disdain of the
hppocrites, which grudge against God if their works be not accepted. Geneua.

How Fasting drives out Devils.
Howbeit this kind goes not out, Ma. 17. 21
but by prayer and fasting. The best remedy to strengthen the weak faith, is
prayer, which has fasting added unto it, as an help to the same. Genesis

For the casting forth of devils by fasting and prayer, mark what Christ
answers: he says that the Apostles could not, because of their incredulity
and weakness of faith, and afterward he adds these two (fasting and prayer)
as wepons and works of faith, which cannot be separated from faith, neither can
be found in the old bottells of ye hypocrites This prayer when it strives
against ye devil, it surmounteth all worldly things or plesures, and the same
is also the only true fast, to neglect (for the time) all worldly things, to
neglect meat and drink, and whatsoever bodelie pleasure or desire may be
imagined, y^ in prayer thy mind may be lifted up above ye heavens unto ye
throne of God. A. G.

The understanding of these two places following.
When ye fast, be not sad as ye hypocrites are, etc By this it appears, that
the true fast is to put away all wanton desires and lusts, etc. And to rule
the body by convenient chastity and mortifieng, as it is said in ye Psa. 35.
13. I afflicted my soul with fasting: and Esa. 58. 4. Behold, when ye fast, your
lusts remain still. Tin.

Then shall they fast in those days. Then shall they fast, that is, so long as
I am with them, they shall not feel the trouble and great persecution of the
world: but when I am taken from them, then shall they fast, that is, then shall
they mourn, for then their persecution and trouble shall begin. Tindale.

Of miraculous Fast.
There is a fast which is above man's strength, and is sometime given of God
meruailously unto some of his saints, Miraculous fast.
to commend their doctrine. Moses in the mountain fasted 40. days. For God
would by a notable example show, ye the law which he set forth, came from
himself, and was not invented of men. Neither went Moses therefore unto ye
mountain to fast, but to receive ye law of God, and to talk with him. Elias
also receiving bread and water of ye Angel, and in ye strength of ye meat
walked 40. days, even unto ye mount of God, Horeb, ye he by this miracle should
be declared to be ye true revenger of ye law. By this kind of fasting our
savior commended ye preching of ye Gospel, y^ it should not seem to be a thing
vulgar, but should be proved a thing begun by god. But these were miracles
neither pertain they any thing unto us, but only y^ we should have the^ in
admiration, and by such examples be stirred up with reverence, to receue ye word
of god. P. M. up. I. 274 And when he had fasted 40. days. The fasting of
Christ ought to be unto us an example of sober living, not for 40. days, as
some do imagine of their own brains, but as long as we are here in this
wildernes^. S. I. Che.

Of the fast compelled.
There is a fast, which lies not in our power, as when we being destitute of
meat, have not whereof to ^ate. Here is need of patience, Compelled fast.
and we must pray unto God y^ he would strengthen and encourage us. So the
Saints when they wandered about, and preached the Gospel, were compelled
sointinies to hunger. And the disciples when they followed y^ Lord, were driven
by hunger to pluck ye ears of corn, and to rub out ye corn, Elias also
desired meat of the widow, and waited at the Brook for such meat^ as the
Ravens should bring him. This kind of fasting men do not take upon them of
their own free will, but it is laid upon them by God. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic.
fol. 274.

The Father is greater then I. Father greater then I.
First I say, Ioh. 14. 18.
that one place of the Gospel, is not to be expounded against the whole
purpose of the book, which is to teach that the Lord Jesus, is Gods natural
s^nne and equal to God. And since the Evangelist has this word Equal,
plainly and expre^lie, they show themselves mad, y^ would make him to
encounter against himself. Second, I say that in that place, the Lord Jesus
compares not his substance with his Fathers substance, but compares his
present humble state, with the glorious state, that he should have after his
Ascension. And therefore all the godly old fathers well nigh have taught these
words to be spoken of his man's nature, which should be forthwith advanced to
immortal and incorporall glory, by the power of the Father. Some Greek
Writers indeed, admit that the Father is greater then the Son, not because
he had greater power, or that there is any difference in their substance and
essence, but in that he is the Father and begets the son, and is not
begotten of the son, therefore he may be said greater. The meaning also of
these words, The Father is greater then I, may be this: The end why I travail
with you is not, that you should stay in me, and look no farther, but to
bring you to the Father, as to the last mark, that with me ye may see him as
he is, whose glory is more dear to me, then mine own glory, and therefore I
seek it more then mine own, and I think that I have not accomplished mine
office until I have brought you to him, etc.

for sometime God shows mercy to the children, and yet notwithstanding
cease not to chastise the unrighteousness of their fathers in ye persons of
their children. As for example: we see a father that has gotten much goods,
howbeit by wicked bargening, by subtlety, by craft and by cruelty, and yet
God has pity upon the child of such a man: and what will he do? He will rid
him quite and clean of all those evil gotten goods, because they would but
bring him to confusion: according as it is said, that such kind of riches are
as wood, which in the end will kindle the fire of Gods wrath. Therefore when
the Lord means to save ye child of a wicked man that has lived amiss, he
bereaueth him of all the evil gotten goods, as though he should let him
blood to save his life, that he might not be wrapped in ye mischife and
coruption, which his father had drawn unto himself. Behold how God punishes
the wickedness of the fathers upon the children, and yet cease not to be the
savior of ye children, and to show them mercy. Sometimes he passes farther,
and because the fathers have been so far out of al square^ as they have led a
stubborn and froward life, God forsakes their offspring, insomuch y^ the grace
of his spirit dwells not with them. Now when we be so destitute of Gods
guiding, we must needs run into destruction, and needs must the mischief
increase more and more. Thus we see y^ when the children of the ungodly do
bear the sins of their fathers, it is not only for that God forsakes them,
and leaves them up to the state of their own nature^ but also for that he
gives Satan full power over them, and lets him have the bridle, to ^aigne
in such houses at his pleasure. And when ye devil has led away the fathers,
and carried them into all naughtiness, their children shall also ouer-shoote
themselves, into excessive outrage. We see then as now what is meant here,
that is to wit^ that when the children of wicked men are (...) destitute of
Gods grace, and walk after their inordinat^ (...) they must needs come to
greater confusion then their Fathers. Call. upon Job. fol. 82.

How our fathers did eat the same spiritual meat, etc.
Our Fathers did all eat the same spiritual meat, 1. Cor. 10. 3
and did all drink of the same spiritual drink, and then drank of that
spiritual Rock, that followed them, which Rock was Christ. These words Saint
Austen expounds, saying: What is to eat the same meat? But that they did
eat the same which we do. Whosoever in Manna understood Christ, did eat the
same spiritual meat that we do, that is to say, that meat which was
received with faith and not with bodies. Therefore to them that understood and
believed, it was the same meat and the same drink. So that to such as
understood not, the meat was only Manna, and the drink only water, but
to such as understood, it was the same that it is now. To come and is come, be
diverse words, but it is the same Christ. These be S. Austens words De vtilita.
poeniten.

How our fathers were justified by faith, as we are now.
The fathers were no less justified only by the faith of Christ then we.
Wherefore it is written in the book of Genesis of Abraham, that he believed and
it was counted unto him for righteousness. John also testifies that Christ said
of Abraham, y^ he had seen his day and therein reioiced. The Epistle to the
Hebrews. the 13 chap. affirms that Christ was yesterdaie and to day, and
remains for ever. Wherefore, even as we are said now to be saved not by
works, but by the true mercy of God, by faith in Christ, so was it with the
Fathers at y^ time, for they were justified by no works, but only by faith in
Christ. Furthermore, what obedience soever ye fathers had toward ye
commandments of God, and also faith in the promises, they were not derived
from their own strength and power, but (even as it also happens unto us) they
came unto them by the grace of God and Christ. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 74.

FAT.
What is meant by the fat^ the inwards and two kidneies.
THe fat that covers the inwards. Le^. 3. 3.
By taking away of the fat the inwards and two kidneies and the kall, is
signified unto us, that if we will be a sweet sacrifice unto the Lord, we must
cut off all concupiscence and mighty desires of the flesh, and the evil use
of all our members, and must subdue and mortify our affections and offer them
to God, by the mortification of the cross, as says the Prophet Psa. 25. T. M.

What the fatted Calfe signifies.
And bring hither the fatted Calfe. Luke 15. 23
That fat Calfe is Christ, which has washed away our sins in his blood, and
feeds us daily through faith with his body and blood unto life everlasting,
for he was killed therefore, that he might be the food and meat of our
souls. Sir. I. Cheek.

What fat Bread signifies.
Of Aser comes fat bread. G^. 49. 20.
Fat bread is plenteousnes of the earth, as increase of corn, and other, etc.
therewith shall feed Kings, and all the men of the earth. As 2. Esd. 9. T. M.

FAVOR.
How Favor casts many a man away.
DEsired favor against him. Here we do learn that many good men are by
favor of them that be in authority, or by hatred of the Iud ges cast away.
Sir. I. Cheek.

FEED.
The exposition of this place, Feed my sheep.
WHereas you think, that this place of the Gospel of John John. 21. 16
was spoken only to Peter, and that these words make him shepherd over all,
and above all: S. Peter himself testifies the contrary, in his canonical
Epistle, where he says to all Priests: Feed y^ flock of Christ which is among
you, which he bad them do by the authority y^ Christ had put them in, as
follows: And when the chief shepherd Christ shall appear, ye shall receive
the incorruptible crown of eternal glory. Tonstall in the b. of Mar. fol.
1212.

Whosoever they be (says S. Austen) that feed the sheep, to the end to make
them theirs and not Christ's, they love themselves and not Christ, for desire
either of glory, or of rule, or of gain. Jewel. fol. 18.

FELIX.
Wherefore he is praised of Tertull^s the Orator.
FElix by his diligence had taken Eleazarus the Captain of the murderers,
Act. 24. 3.
and put the Egyptians of flight which raised up tumults in Iewrie, for these
y^ Orator praised him. Otherwise he was both cruel and covetous. Read
Josephus. lib. 2. Antiq. cha. 11. and. 12. And li. 2. De bello Iudaico. cap.
12. Geneua.

Of Felix trembling.
Felix trembled. Act. 24. 26
The fear of the dreadful judgment of God profits nothing, unless it do
engender true repentance in men's hearts. Felix was afraid at the preaching of
the judgment, but he was never the better for it: for why: he did gape still
for bribes and rewards, as a most corrupted Judge. Sir. I. Cheek.

The word of God, makes the very wicked astonished, and therefore to them, it
is the ^auour of death unto death. Geneua.

Wherefore Felix would have pleasured the Jews.
And willing to get favor of the Jews, left Paul in prison. For whereas he
had behaved himself very wickedlie in the Province, had it not been for
favor of his brother Pallas, he should have died for it. So that we may
gather hereby, why he would have pleasured the Jews. Beza.

FEAR.
A definition of fear.
Fear is nothing else but a certain affect of the mind, whereby we are
stricken, by reason of some great and hurtful evil which is at hand. We are
not commonly moved by such dangers which are far from us, but by those which
seem to be even now at hand, neither do things light and of small weight make
us afraid. Wherefore fear, as a Divine speaks of fear, has a respect unto
sin, unto the wrath of God, unto chastisement and scourges, and finally unto
hell fire. But there are noted two kind of fears, 2. Fears.
of which the one is commonly called filial, that is, pertaining to a natural
child, and the other servile, that is, pertaining to a bondman. And that is
called a servile fear, which only by the fear of pains and of hell fire,
either draws us back from doing evil, or impelleth us to do well. Even so
signified an Ethnike Poet, Horace.
when he wrote: Oderunt peccare^ma^ formidine poen^, that is, The wicked hate
to sin, for fear of punishment. But the final fear is, whereby men live
upright and fly wickedness, for that they desire to set forth the glory of
God, and for that they allow righteousness even for his own sake, wherefore
the same Poet says: Oderun^ peccare bo^^ virtutis amore, that is, The good
hate to sin for the love of virtue, etc. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 209.

Difference of fears.
Peter feared otherwise then did Judas. For Judas indeed so feared that he
despaired: but Peter. so feared that he got him again unto Christ, whom
before by denieng, he had forsaken. Where we say that a servile fear Servile
fear.
is, whereby we so abhor God being angry, and fly from him that we are
utterly void of faith. But a filial fear Filial fear.
is, whereby in ye midst of terrors, we are lifted up through faith, neither
suffer we our selves to be swallowed up with fear. Wherefore in godly men
fear is never seioined from faith. For these. 2. things are so to be knit
together, y^ faith always governs fear: Faith governs fear.
for if it should not, desperation would easily succeed: for even as ye law ought
always to be joined with ye gospel, so also ought fear to be ever joined
with faith. We do not so embrace ye gospel, but y^ we always think upon ye
obedience of ye co^mandeme^ts of God: and when we see how often and how
grievously we fall, we call our selves back again by repentance. And
contrariwise ye law is not to be received without the gospel, for if it
should, we could never obey it without Christ, nor also obtain pardon for the
offenses which we committed against it. Pet. Mar. upon the To. fol. 207.

What Fear imports.
Fear imports as much as y^ our life must be ruled according to the will of
God. For what becomes of men, when they know not themselves to be subject to
their maker? They rush out into al naughtines. We know what our lusts are, the^
if ye fear of god reign in us, we must acknowledge y^ he has not put us into
ye world to live at such liberty as we lust our selves, but reserueth his
whole right over us, so as we must obey him: behold (I say) what the word fear
imports, y^ is to say, y^ we should lern to direct our whole life to ye will of
god, etc. Ca. up. Job. 267.

What the fear of God is.
Whereas we speak of ye fear of God, we have to understand, y^ it is not a
^^auish fear (as men term it) but it is so termed, in respect of ye honor
which we owe, for that he is our Father and Master^ Do we fear God? Then it
is certain nothing but to honor him, and to be wholly his. Do we know him?
That must be in such wise as he has uttered himself, that is to wit; that he
is our maker, our maintains, and ^^e that showed such fatherly goodness toward
us, that we of duty ought to be as children toward him, if we will not be
utterly unthankful. Also it behooves us to acknowledge his dominion ^
superiority over us, to ye end y^ every of us yeld^ng him his due honor may
^ern to plese him in all respects: thus you see y^ under this ^ere of god, here
is comprehended all religion: y^ is to wit, all y^ service and honor which the
creatures owe unto their God. (...). 4.

They neither f^ared the Lord, 4. Reg. 17^ 34.
etc. Not to fear the Lord is, to live careless, and to serve their lusts and
appetites, and not to set by God and his Law, as is said. Psalm. 55 19. T. M.

He means this by the Israelites, to whom God hat given his commandments.
Geneua.

They feared the Lord, 4. Reg. 17. 33.
but served their Gods. That is, they had a certain knowledge of God, and
feared him because of the punishment, but they continued still Idolaters, as do
y^ Papists, which worship both God and I^ols, but this is not to fear God, as
appears ver. 34. Geneua.

How this place following is expounded.
Perfect love casts out fear. ^I know there are some which interpret those
words in this sense: 1. Ioh. 18
that they which love God truly, are not afraid for piety sake, to put
themselves in all manner of dangers, neith^r do they shame persecution, but
valiantly stand fast in all manner of dangers, which self thing, Paul in the
letter to Timothy, writ in other words, (...): We have not received the spirit
of fearfulness, but of might and of love. Wherefore he exhorts Timothy,
not to be ashamed of the testimony of the Lord, nor of him being in ^andes for
the Lords sake, but courageously to endure labors for the Gospels sake:
Although those things are true, yet this is not it which this place of John
teaches. Fear cast out.
For it there makes mention of the judgment of the Lord, of which he wills
the godly which love God not to be afeard: and he renders a reason, for y^
fear has vexation joined with it. Wherefore I gladly assent unto Augustine
which says, that John speaks of perfect Charity, which forasmuch as it
cannot be had in this life, we may not look to have it without fear. Further
we might in this place understand, that fear which is se^oined from
confidence: and therefore driued men to desperation. For they which believe and
love God truly, uphold their fear with a lively faith. Pet. Mar. upon the
Romans fol. 208.

Of fear that comes of faith, and of fear without faith.
He that fearth God truly, will eschew all things, wherewith he knows he
shall offend God, and do whatsoever he perceives to be acceptable unto him,
and this fear has his beginning of faith. Fear without faith.
There is a fear of God in the vng^lie, but it is without faith. For they
always dread Gods judgment against them, and would rather there were no God,
then to be punished for their wickedness.

How we cannot utterly shake off all fear, so long as we live here.
Be not high minded, R^. 11. 20
but fear. No man of the number of the faithful, ought to be in doubt of his
salvation. For the nature of faith is, to make men assured of the promise of
God. Howbeit, this is to be known, y^ it is not possible, that so long as we
live here, we should not utterly shake off all fear, for we are continually
tossed between two cogitations, the one of the goodness, faith and constancy
of god. The other of our corruption, infirmity and pronesse to evil. For when
we consider how weak we are and prone to evil, and consider also ye filthiness
and imperfection of our works, though they be never so good, and therwithal
the severity of the law in requiring even to the uttermost, the things which
it commands. This consideration (I say) if it be vehement, cannot but
exceedingly make afeard ye mind, and deiect it. But on the other side, when we
consider the clemency, goodness and mercy of God, and his constancy in his
promises, and therewithal remember, that all the merits of Christ are
communicated to us, we are refreshed and recreated, and the fear is either
lenified, or else sometime utterly laid away. And these effects where they
are perfect and vehement, do succeed ye one the other, for they cannot be both
at one time, or if they be both at one time, then are either of them remiss,
and not vehement. But in what matter they give place ye one to ye other we may
by daily experience understand. For if a man be set upon ye top of an high
tower, Tovver
and if being there his mind run upon n^thing else but upon the height of the
tower, and what a deep way he should fall, so y^ he cannot fall without danger
of death, it i^ possible but y^ his mind being still upon this, he should be
altogether smitten with an error: but if he turn his eye aside to the bar
or battlements which stay him up that he cannot fall, then will he pluck up
his spirits again, and put away al fear: neither ought it to seem unto any
man strange, y^ we say that faith expels that fear, which is joined with
doubting of salvation, when as in John it is said, That charity drives fear
out a doors. For it is most certain that y^ which the Scripture attributes
to charity, may be attributed to faith: for charity springs of faith. Pet.
Mar. upon the Romans fol. 355.

FERVENT.
Of two sorts of feruentnesse.
THey have a fervent mind to God, but not according to knowledge. Romans 10. 2
There be two manner of feruentnesse of mind, and two manner of good intents.
The one is grounded upon a vain or fleshly opinion, and not upon Gods word:
this good intent is damnable before God. The other proceeds of faith, and
suffers it self to be ruled by the wisdom and judgment of the spirit of
God. Such feruentnesse was in Moses, in Phin^hes, and in Helias, with other
innumerable. Sir I. Cheek.

Look. Zeal.

FEASTS.
Feast of dedication, wherefore it was ordained.
THE feast of dedication. Ioh. 12. 22
That is to say, the feast of invocation or renueng: because ye temple which
was polluted: by y^ commandment and authority of Judas Machabeus, was
consecrated a fresh: And then it was appointed y^ every year there should be a
feast day of new dedication, Dedicati^
to put the people in mind of the grace and favor of God, who had taken from
them the tyrant Antiochus. Read the 2. chapter of the second book of
Machabees: Notwithstanding there are some which refer this day of
dedication, to that first day, when the people returned from Babylon, of which
mention is made in the sixth Chapter of the first book of Esdras. Read
Josephus in his. 22. book, and 14. chapter. But it makes no great matter of
which dedication or renouation, you say that this was the seast day, whether
of the first or of the last. Marl. upon John. fo. 381.

Feast of pas^e-ouer, wherefore it was instituted.
The feast of pase ouer^ Passover

Feast of Penticost, wherefore it was instituted.
The feast of Penticost Penticost

Of the feast of Tabernacles.
The feast of tabernacles was (...) of the dwelling of the Israelites forty
years in tents. Hemmyng.

The Jews feast of tabernacles was at hand. John 7. 2
Ey this feast of tabernacles Tabernacles.
we are a^monished y^ we are but pilgrims and strangers, as long as we live
in this natural body, and that we have no permanent city, here, and
therefore ought we earnestly to desire that we may enter into the land of
promission, which is the land of the living. Of this feast read. Leuit. 23. ver
34. Sir I. Cheek.

At this feast they dwelled 7. days in the tents, which put them in
remembrance that they had no city here permanent, but that they must seek
one to come. Geneua.

This feast of tabernacles or tents was so called because the children of
Israel abode in their tents 7. days, for a remembrance that God made their
fathers dwell in tents when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. This
feast is celebrated from the fi^teenth day of the seventh month (which we
call October) unto the. 21. day of the same. As is to be seen in Leuiticus.
Marl. upon John. fol. 242.

Of the omitting of the feast of Tabernacles.
For since the time of Joshua y^ son of Nun unto this day, had not the
children of Israel done so etc. The mening is not y^ the feast of tabernacles
was not celebrated from y^ time of Joshua the son of Nun unto that day which
was almost a thousand years, but y^ it was not celebrated in that manner, y^
is with such solemnity, so great (...) and gladness, as the v^rie words
themselves declare, both in the Hebrew text, and in the best translations. And
so does (...) expound that place, who says, y^ those words since the time of
Joshua the son of Nun, etc. be spoken in the respect of greatness of the joy
which there happened unto the people^ Lyra also expound^th the same place, much
after the same sort, and presupposes nothing less then that the feast were
omitted all this time, for he affirms y^ they were much more solemnly, and
with greater cost celebrated in ye time of David and Solomon. Therefore says
he, the comparison is, Secundum quid and propertionaliter. (For I use his
words,) because in all this time sithence Joshua, it is not read, y^ the people
were so gathered together in Jerusalem, as we read in the beginning of this
chapter, that they were at this time. And again he says, y^ it was more for
the people newly returned from captivity to celebrate such a feast with that
solempnitie, then it was to mighty kings and people being in prosperity, and
setteled in a kingdom, to celebrate the same day with much more cost and
solempnitie. D. Whitga^t. fo. 9.

FESTVS.
How he ascribed madness to Saint Paul.
FEstus said with a loud voice. Act. 26. 24
Paul thou art beside thy self, much learning has made thee mad. Festus
being much troubled with Paul's declaration, and having nothing to say
against it, yet would not yield unto it, but ^^amorouslie condemned it, as
wicked and superstitious. For worldlings are loath to be combred with godly
matters, and count all such as foolish, that trouble themselves therewith. The
Bible note.

FEET OF GOD.
Look Foot.

FIRE.
How every man's work is tried by the fire.
IN the fire it shall be showed. 1. Cor. 3. 13
If any man's work that he has builded do abide this fire, y^ is, if the
word y^ a man has preached do abide all assalts and temptations, it is a
token that they are surely grounded on the Scripture of God, and then shall
the preacher receive his reward. If any man's work be burnt, that is, the
preachers word will not abide the trial and light, but vanish away, then it is
a token, that they are not well grounded on Scripture, and so shall he suffer
hurt, for it shall be a great cross and vexation to the preacher that he has
been so deceived himself, and also has lead other into his error.

Notwithstanding he shall be saved, because of his faith in the foundation
which is Christ, and his ignorance shall be pardoned^ since hee^erred not of a
malicious purpose, but of a good zeal. But yet shall it be as it were a fire
unto him, for it shall grieve his heart to see that he had labored ^n vain,
and that he must destroy the same, which he before through ignorance
preached. This is the process and pure understanding of the text. I. Frith.
fo. 44.

By fire Saint Paul does understand, persecution and trouble. By gold,
silver, and precious stones, he understands them, that in the midst of
persecution, do abide steadfastly in the word. By timber, haie, and stubble,
are meant such as in the time of persecution do fall away from the truth. If
they then which believe, do in the time of persecution stand steadfastly in
the truth, the builder shall receive a reward, and the work shall be preserved
and saved. But if so be, that they swarne and go back when persecution
arises, he shall suffer loss, that is to say, the builder shall loose his
labor and cost. But yet the builder (I mean) the preacher of the word, shall
be saved, if he being tried by persecution, do abide fast in the faith. Sir
I. Cheek.

The meaning of Saint Paul when he wrote this to the Corinthians, was to
advise the ministers of the Gospel, that when as he had laid Jesus Christ as
the foundation of our health, they should build nothing upon it, but only
heavenly doctrine, which is like to gold, silver, and precious stones. For if
any man would build upon it man's doctrine, which is not grounded upon the
word of God, but is like to timber, haie, and stubble, every man's doctrine
shall be examined and tried by the fire, that is, the holy Ghost. And that
doctrine which is altogether agreeable to the foundation shall stand still. And
that doctrine which is not fully agreeable, and yet has kept the foundation
whole, shall be consumed by the fire of the holy Ghost, who works by his
grace, that such ministers as does repent them of those errors which they have
committed in their doctrine vnagreeble unto the word of God, should be saved by
the fi^e of this examination. F. N. B. the Italian.

If any man build upon this foundation gold, 1. Cor. 3. 12
silver, precious stones, wood, haie, or stubble, Wood, haie, and stubble.
etc. Here the Apostle would have us to be fervent in good works, and
earnest to do well, he wishes us to be occupied in y^ labou^, which when the
judge of all shall come, may in his sight be acceptable, may to his word be
commendable, and that we should well beware, what works we build upon our
foundation, he plainly shows, that at the last day, all our d^^ing shall be
opened, and that then the same shall be so tried as the golde-smith in fining
his mettalls, tries out the dross and base matter from the pure, perfect, and
fine. The day (says he) of our Lord shall declare it, because it shall
appear in fire. The day of our Lord is the day of judgment, the thing is so
plain as no man though he be very perverse may deny it. But when shall it
appear in fire, even then at the general judgment, so is the Text. This
place is only spoken of those which shall be saved, of such as build upon
Jesus Christ, upon which foundation as all cannot build gold, precious
stones, and silver, as all cannot be perfect, neither by martyrdom be crowned,
nor yet by good learning shine like the stars of heaven. So thereon building
being b^t wood or haie, be it but very stubble, though the work it self be
in the end burned, though he himself receive no such reward as y^ others, yet
shall he be saved, and hom? As it were through fire. Not through fire, but
through the great fear wherein he then shall stand, of the justice and
judgment of God. O how comfortable is this doctrine? How far passes it all
their painted fires and ^ained flames of Purgatory. You see now, that the
Scripture admits no such place, you see the right meaning of the Apostle,
etc. L. Euans.

The meaning of these places following.
And he heard him from heaven in fire upon the Altar of whole burnt offerings.
1. Par. 21. 26.
God declared that he heard his request in that he sent down fire from heaven,
for else they might use no fire, but of that which was reserved still upon the
Altar. Leuit. Chap. 6. 13. and came down from heaven. Chap. 9. 14. as
appears by the punishment of Nadab and Abihu. Leuit. cap. 10.^ Geneua.

Shall be worthy to be punished with he^fire. Mat. 5. 2^.
The Jews used four kinds of punishments before their government was taken
away by Herod, hanging, beheading, stoning, and burning. This is it that
Christ shot at, because burning was the greatest punishment, therefore in that
he makes mention of a judgment, a counsel and a fire, he shows that some
sins are worse then other some, but yet they are all such y^ we must give an
account for them and shall be punished for them. Beza.

FIG TREE.
Of the Fig Tree that Christ cursed.
ANd spied a Fig Tree in the way and came to it, Mat. 21. 18
and found nothing thereon but leaves only. By this Fig Tree Christ does
sufficient lie show, that the Jews although they had an appearaunce of
holiness by their ceremonies, yet nevertheless, they had not the fruit of
charity: by which he signified y^ they should worthily be deprived, and put
from this false appearance, by the destruction of Jerusalem. Mar. 13. 2. Luke
21. 6. Tin.

Cut it down, Luke. 13. 7
why combereth it the ground. Unles we do believe, and also bring forth
fruit worthy repentance, we shall with the unprofitable fig tree be cut
down, and also our talent shall be taken from us, and given unto an other,
that shall put it to better use. Sir I. Cheek.

FIGVRE.
Proves how the bread in the Sacrament is a figure of Christ's body.
THe Lord doubted not to say, Augustine
This is my body, when he gave a sign of his body. And after in the same
Chapter he expounds it. For truly so the blood is the soul, and Christ was
the stone. And yet ye Apostle does not say, the stone did signify Christ, but
he says, ye stone was Christ. Here Christ calls ye figure of his body his
body (says S. Austen) and does compare the three texts of scripture, This is
my body, The blood is the soul, and Christ was the stone. Declaring them to
be one phrase, and to be expounded after one fashion. August contra^ Adam.

The Priest says, Ambrose
make us, this ^^lation acceptable, etc.

For it is a figure of the body of our Lord Jesus Christ. Here he calls it
plainly a figure of Christ's body. Ambrose. li. 3. de Sacra.

^et that saying be expounded by a figure, Hierome.
I say the thing that is spoken is not true indeed but figured under the
cloud of an allegory. Hierom^ aduers. (...).

Ye have heard that it is a figure. Chrisosto^
Therefore marvel not ^ And being a figure require not al things to agree,
for otherwise it were no figure. Chrysostom in Genesis Homil. 35.

First of all thou must take heed, Augustine
that thou take not a figurative speech according to the letter, for that is it
whereof Saint Paul says, The letter kills. For when ye thing that is spoken
under a figure, is so taken as if it were plainly spoken, there is a fleshly
understanding, neither is there any thing that may better be called ye death
of the soul. August. de doct. Chri. li. 3. ca. 5.

Figures be in vain, Lactatius.
and serve for no purpose, when the things of them signified be present.
Lactan. insti. li. 2. ^ap. 1.

A figure of a body (says Tertulian Tertulian
) presupposes a very natural body for of a show or a fancy, there can be no
figure. But Christ gave unto his Disciples a figure of his body, therefore it
must needs follow, that Christ had a very natural body. His words be these:
Christ taking the bread and distributing it to his Disciples, made it his
body, saying: This is my body, that is to say: This is a figure of my body:
but a figure it could not be, unless there were a body of a truth, and
indeed, for a void thing as is a fantasy, can receive no figure. Tertulian
contra Mar. li. 4.

There is a figure (says Hilarie Hilarie.
) for bread and wine be outwardly seen. And there is also a truth of that
figure, for the body and blood of Christ be of a truth inwardly seen. This
Hilarie was within less then 350. years after Christ.

Crisostome affirms saying, Chrisosto^
that if a man understand the words of Christ carnally, he shall surely profit
nothing thereby. For what mean these words, the flesh avails nothing? He
meant not his flesh (God forbid) but he meant of them that fleshly and
carnally understood those things that Christ spoke. But what is carnal
understanding? To understand the words simply as they be spoken, and nothing
else. For we ought not so to understand the things which we see. But all
mysteries must be considered with inward eyes, and that is, spirituallie to
understand them. In these words S. Chrysostom shows plainly, that the
words of Christ concerning the eating of his flesh, and drinking of his blood,
are not to be understood simply, as they be spoken, but spirituallie and
figuratiuelie. Chrysostom in John Homil. 46.

Tertulian Tertulian
writing against Marcion, says these words: Christ did not reprove bread,
whereby he did represent his very body: And in the same book he says, That
Jesus taking bread, and distributing it among his Disciples, made it his body,
saying: This is my body, that is to say (says Tertulian) a figure of my
body. And therefore says Tertulian, that Christ called bread his body, and
wine his blood, because that in the old Testament, bread and wine were figures
of his body and blood. Tertulian contra Marcionem.

The wine refreshes and augmenteth the blood, Druthmarus.
^or that cause the blood of Christ is not improperly figured by ye same:
Inasmuch as all that comes unto us from him, does make us glad with a true
joy, and increases all our gladness, etc. A little before he says, the Lord
gave unto his Disciples the Sacrament of his body in remission of their
sins, and for to keep love and charity, to the end, that having remembrance
of that deed, he would do always in a figure, that which he thought to do
for them, and should not forget that charity: This is my body, that is is to
say, a Sacrament, etc. Druthmarus. Monk of S. Benet. in his Comment. upon. S.
Ma.

Figures of Christ's resurrection.
Christ's resurrection (says Saint Austen) was prefigured in our first father
Adam: because like as Adam rising after sleep knew Eve shaped out of his side:
So Christ rising again from the dead, builded the Church out of the wounds of
his side. Joshua, Joseph, Samson, James, were figures of Christ's resurrection.

FIGVRATIVE SPEECH.
How to know a figurative speech.
TO know a figurative speech, Augusti li ^. de doctri. Christ.
S. Austen has these words: Whenever the Scripture of Christ seems to
command any foul or wicked thing, then must that text be taken figuratiuelie
and that it is a phrase, allegory, and manner of speaking, and must be
understood spirituallie and not after the letter. Except (says he) ye eat the
flesh of the son of man, and drink his blood, ye shall have no life in you,
he seems (says S. Austen) to command a foul and wicked thing, it is
therefore a figure. Now seeing that Saint Austen calls it a foul thing to
eat his flesh, we may soon perceive that he thought it as foul and as
wicked a thing to eat his body, seeing his body is flesh. And then
consequently it must follow, that either this word eat (where Christ said,
take this and eat it) must be taken spirituallie, or else y^ this saying of
Christ. This is my (...) spoken. But this word (...) is taken after the l^tter
(for thy did indeed ^^o bread) must be figuratiuelie spoken. I. Frith.

We even v^e to say when Easter draws nigh, August ad Bonis. 1 pist. 23.
that tomorrowe or the next day is the Lords passover, and yet it is many
y^a^es sin^e he suffered, and that passion was never done but once. And upon
that Sundaie we say, This day the Lord did rise again, and yet it is many
years since he rose. Now is there no man so foolish to reprove us as liars
for so saying, because we name those days after the similitude of those, in
which those things were done. So that it is called the same day, which is not
the same, but by the reuolu^ion of time, like it. And it is named to be done
the same day, through the celebration of the Sacrament, (Through keeping the
men^oriall of the thing once done) which is not done y^ day, ^^t was done long
before. Was not Christ once crucified in his own person, and yet in a mystery
(which is the remembrance of his very passion) he is crucified for the
people, not only every ^east of Ea^^er: but every day Neither does he lie,
which (when he is asked) a^^swereth that he is crucified. For if Sacraments had
not certain similitudes of those things whereof they are Sacraments, Note.
then should they ^e no Sacraments at all. And for this similitude for the most
part, they take the names for the v^rie things. And therefore after a certain
manner, the sacrament of Christ's body, and the sacrament of Christ's bl^ud, is
Christ's blood. So the Sacrament of faith is faith, for it is none other to
believe, then to have faith. And therefore when a man answers, that the
infant believes, which has not ^he effect of ^aith, he answers that it
has faith, for the Sacrament of faith. Sacrament of Faith: Conversion: Baptime.
And then it turns it self to God, for the Sacrament of conversion. For the
answer it self pertains unto the ministering of the Sacrament. As the
Apostle write^h of Baptime: We be buried (says he) with Christ through
baptime unto death, he says not, we signify buri^ng, but utterly says, we
are buried. He called also the Sacrament of so great ^ thing, even with the
proper name of the very thing it self, etc. Here does Saint Austen plainly
set forth the matter. For even ^s the next good Fr(...)e shall be called the day
of Christ's passion, and yet he shall not suffer death again upon that day, for
he died but once, and now is immortal, even so is the Sacrament called
Christ's body. And as that day is not the very day he dyed upon, but
only a remembrance of his body breaking and bloud-shedding. And likewise as
the next Easter day, shall be called the day of his resurrection, not that
it is the very same day that Christ did rise in, but a remembrance of the
same, even so the Sacrament is called his body, not that it is his body
indeed, but only a remembrance of the same, etc. I. Frith.

FINDING OF THINGS LOST.
How they ought to be restored, and not kept.
SAint Austen touches this thing in his 19. Sermon, De verbis Apostolis. And
it is had in the Decrees. 14. Questi. 5. Chap. Si quid inuenisti. Where he
says, That things which are found must be restored. Which thing if thou do
not, thou have rapt them, for as much as thou have done what thou could, so
that if thou had found more, thou would have rapt more, etc. There the
Glo^^r very well declares, what is to be done with things that are found.
Either (says he) the same things are counted for things cast away, as if
any owner has cast away any thing, the same thing if a man ^eteine when he
has found it, he commits not theft. But if that thing which is found, be
not willinglie^ cast away, neither thought to have been willlinglie lost of
the owner, (As when a Ring is found, or a Purse, or any such thing, which is
not wont to be cast a side) the same thing if thou retain, it is theft,
unless thou keep it by thee, with a will and mind to restore it again.
Wherefore thou must publicly testify that thou have ^ounde those things,
whereby the owner may come to his own again, as it is decreed^ in the
Digestes. De furtis, In the law. F^ssus in the Paragraphe, qui alienum. But if
thou keep it by thee, with the mind not to restore it, it is theft. Which

FIRST.
Of the first begotten son, An answer to Helindius the heretic. Objection.
Our Savior Christ was called her first begotten son, Ma. 1. 25.
and none (says Helindius) can he called first begotten, but he that has
brethren, even as he is called the only begotten son, which is the only
son of his Father.

Answer.
That is not true, for every only son is the first begotten, although he
have no brethren, and therefore in the book of Numbers, the almighty God does
define, who, or what is the first begotten, saying: All that breaks the
matric^ in all flesh, whether it be of men or of beasts, shall be slain:
nevertheless the first borne of man, thou shall redeem. Here the word of
the Lord does define what first borne is, that is, every one that opens the
matrice first: namelye, whether it be only begotten or first begotten. The
Lord says not, tarry unto the sccond be borne: but he says: Those that are
to be redeemed shall thou redeem, from the age of a month, for the value of a
month, namely, for five Sickles. For if it should have been so, that he that
first opens the matrice, should not be called the first borne First born
until he have brethren, then might some man have said, I owe nothing unto
the Priest, till that he be brought forth, by whom he that is already borne
be made first begotten. Also in Exodus it is said. And at midnight the Lord
smote all the first borne in the land of Egypt, both of man and beast. Now if
it be true that none are first begotten, but they that have brethren, then the
only begotten although they were first borne, perished not. Marl. fol. 19.

What is meant by breaking of our first Faith.
Prima fides is not taken for the vow of chastity, ^. Tim. 5. 12
but for the faith we promise in Baptime after the mind of Saint Hierome, who
wrote on this wise: Non sunt digoi fide, etc.

They be not worthy to be believed, that have forsaken their first faith:
First faith
I mean Marcion and Basilides. These two famous heretics, Marcion and
Basilides, were not condemned for any vow of chastity, but for the refusing
of the faith of Christ. Which Saint Hierome calls the first faith. Jewel.
fol. 170.

They have not only done dishono^r to Christ, in leaving their vocation, but
also have broken their faith. Geneua.

What the first fruits signify in the law.
In the law it was commanded, that of all the increase and fruits of the
earth, should be given unto God the first fruits, yea, also the first borne of
living creatures, were due unto him. And when Paul makes mention of the mass
or (...), he alludeth to that which we read in the 15. First frui^s
Chapter of the book of Numbers, that some part of the lump of new dowe was
commanded to be separated for God, before that the new bread should be tasted
of: for thereof were made sweet cakes, which were offered unto God. Which
thing he therefore caused to be done, that men by that ceremony might
understand, and of their own accord testify, that God is unto them the giver
and distributer of all fruits. Wherefore that oblation increased not the
riches of God, which are otherwise infinite, but also nourished in men a
grateful memory of benefits received. As oftentimes Emperors and great and
mighty kings, give unto some one man a city or province, or some certain
dominion, with this condition, That he shall pay unto him every year some
thing of small value in the name of a Tribute, not that they seek by that
talent to be enriched, but that they may perpetually understand and
testify, that he depends upon that Prince, and that he has at his hands
obtained that dignity, which he now enjoys. Moreover, this commodity had
the Common weal by that ceremony, (...)
that by such oblations the holy ministry was sustained, whose use is so
great, that it ought to be maintained, yea, though with great charge Moreover
in all the first fruits was signified Christ, the first borne of all
creatures, and namely the first fruits of them that rose again from the
dead, whereby all the faithful are sanctified: for by first fruits was made
holy that which was remaining, and left at home to sustain the family. Yea,
and this manner of offering first fruits, was derived also unto the Ethnikes,
for the Uirgins called Vestae offered first fruits unto their domestical
Gods: And as Plutarch tells in Symposiacis, the men in old time drank not
any Wine, before that they had first offered sacrifice to some God, that that
which they drank might not hurt them. And at Athens the xi. day of the
month, they offered the first fruits of Wine. In all these things we may
behold the steps of that holy institution. Although y^ Ethnikes had with
idolatrus superstition violated that which was well instituted. At this day
also although the yoke of the Ceremonies of Moses be taken away, yet should it
be very well done of us, of our free and liberal will, to offer unto God, the
first fruits, by giving them to the poor. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 351.

The meaning of this place following.
The first shall be last, Mat. 20. 16.
etc. To be made of the first, last, is to be excluded and shut out of the

the body is, when the true preacher flies the cruel persecution of tyrants,
that seeks his death and destruction. And this may he do lawfully both by
the doctrine and example of Christ. The flieng of the mind is, when one flies
from doing his duty, and will not defend the true doctrine, by rebuking and
condemning the false. Hemmyng.

FLESH.
What is understood by flesh.
FLesh is not understood, Romans 8.
as though flesh were only ye which pertains unto unchastity. But Paul
calls flesh here as Christ does. John. 3. All that is borne of flesh, that
is to wit, the whole man with life, soul, body, wit, will, reason, and
whatsoever he is or does within or without: because that those al, and all that
is in man, study after the world and the flesh, etc. Tindale.

By y^ deeds of ye law no flesh shall be justified. Gal 2. 16.
Flesh in Paul does not signify (as ye schoolmen dream) manifest and gross
sins, for these he uses to call by their proper names, as adultery,
fornication, uncleanness, and such like: but by flesh Paul means here as
Christ does in the third chapter of John. That which is borne of flesh (says
he) is flesh. Flesh therefore signifies the whole nature of man. This flesh
(says he) is not justified by works, no nor of the law. Flesh therefore
according to Paul, signifies all the righteousness, wisdom, devotion,
religion, understanding and will that is possible to be in a natural man. So
that if a man be never so righteous, according to reason and the law of God,
yet with all his righteousness, works, merits, devotion and religion, he is
not justified, etc. Luther upon the Gal. fol. 65.

That which is borne of flesh is flesh, John. 3. 6.
etc. That is fleshly, to wit, wholly unclean and under the wrath of God: And
therefore this word (Flesh) signifies, The corrupt nature of man, contrary
to which is the (Spirit) that is the man ingraffed into Christ, through the
grace of the holy Ghost, whose nature is everlasting and immortal, though the
strife of the flesh remains. Beza.

By the works of the law, Romans 3. 20
no flesh shall be justified. Flesh is here taken for man, as in many other
places, and furthermore has here a greater fear: for it is here put to show
the contrariety between God and man: as if you would say, man, who is
nothing else but a piece of flesh defil^d with s^^me, and God who is most purs,
and most perfect in himself. Beza.

The meaning of this place following.
Such shall have trouble in the flesh. 1. Co. 7. 28.
By the flesh he understands what things soever belongs to this present
life, for marriage brings with it many discommodities: so that he bends
more to a sole life, not because it is a service more agreeable to God then
marriage, b^t for those (...), (which if it were poss(...)) he would with all
men to be void of, that they might give themselves to God only. Beza.

What it is to be in the flesh.
Neither does Saint Paul in this place (where he says, Romans 8. 9.
Ye are not in the Flesh) mean any other thing, then did the Lord in the
Gospel, when he said unto his disciples, ye are not of this world. Wherefore
Ambrose says, that we have such a nature framed unto us as we feel it to be:
and he adds moreover, that the wise men of the world, are in the flesh,
because they resist faith and will believe those things only, which are
agreeable to reason. This place again teaches us, that Ambrose by the name of
flesh understands reason, and the higher parts of of the soul, we say
therefore, that to be in the flesh according to the Apostles, meaning signifies
nothing else, then in all our actions to be ruled and governed by the sense and
effect of Nature, not yet regenerate in Christ. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol.
198.

Again, this place (Ye are not in the Flesh) cannot but be figuratiuelie
interpreted: for if we should understand simply, that we are not in the Flesh,
the truth would show the contrary.

Wherefore Chrysostom upon this place says, that it is a thing very
dangerous always to understand the Scriptures, according to the proper
signification of ye words. I marvel therefore what our adversaries mean, so
much to iangle and make such (...), that when we say that these words of the

To take no thought for the flesh, how it is expounded.
Take no thought for the flesh, Romans 16. (...)
to fill the lusts of it. By the flesh he here understands not natural
health, for that is not to be neglected, that we may be able the more
constantly to serve GOD. Paul writes to Timothy: Use a little Wine, because
of the stomach, and often (...). Here he prohibiteth only, the pleasures
and delights of the flesh. For when we let loose the bridle to them, the
flesh is made unruly. Wherefore, seeing that we ought continually to wrestle
against the prone affects thereof, let us take heed, that with over much
delicateness we nourish them not. Pet. Mar. fol. 434.

The meaning of this place following.
My flesh is verelie meat, and my blood verelie drink.

When Christ spoke th^se words, John. 6. 55
he spoke nothing of the Sacrament, for it was not instituted until his last
Supper. Upon this S. Austen says, Why preparest thou either tooth or belly,
believe, and then thou have eaten him. And when Christ saw them offended, he
said unto them: Does this offend you? What will ye say then, when ye shall
see the Son of man ascending thither whence he was before? Then adds Saint
Austen, You shall know that he meant not to give his flesh to eat with your
teeth, for he shall ascend whole. And Christ adds, it is the spirit that
quickens, the Flesh profits nothing, the words that I speak are spirit
and life, that is to say says S. Austen, are spirituallie to be understood.
And when Christ says his flesh profits nothing (meaning of his own flesh as
Austen says) he means that it profits not as they understood him, that is
to say, it profits not if it were eaten, but it does much profit to be
slain, that through it and the shedding of his blood, the wrath of God our
father is pacified, and our sins forgiven.

His Disciples which followed him, Augustine
were astonished, and abhorred his words, and understood them not. Again in
another place he says: when Christ said, Except a man eat my flesh, and
drink my blood, he shall have no life in him, they because they understood him
not, said to each other, This is an hard saying, who can hear him? August. in
sermo. ad infan.

What flesh shall inherit the kingdom of Heaven.
Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of Heaven. 1. Co. 15. 50
Our belief is, that there shall be a general Resurrection of the flesh
according to the Scripture. Esaie 26. 19. Romans 12. 2. Job. 19. 26. John. 5. 29.
Nevertheless, it shall be purged from all corruption, and be changed to
immortal life, for it must be an vncorrupt flesh that shall inherit the
kingdom of God.

Of the battle between the flesh and the spirit.
Between the flesh and the spirit, is a continual strife, if the spirit
overcome in temptation, then is the stronger, and the flesh weaker: but if the
flesh get a custom, then is the spirit none other oppressed, then as though
she had a mountain upon her back, and as we sometime in our dream, think
that we bear heavier then a millstone upon our breasts: or when we dream now
and then, that we would run away for fear, our legs seem heavier then
lead^ even so is the spirit oppressed and ouerladen of the flesh, and strives
to get up and break loose in vain, till God of his mercy which hears
his groan through Jesus Christ come and loose him with his power, and put his
cross of tribulation on the back of the flesh to keep it down, to minish her
strength, and to mortify her. Tindale. fol. 186.

What flesh and spirit signifies.
Flesh and spirit, may thou not here understand, as flesh were only that
which pertains unto unchastity, and the spirit that which inwardly
pertains unto the heart. ^ut Paul calls flesh here, as Christ does John.
3. All that is borne of the Flesh, that is to wit, the whole man, with life,
soul, body, wit, will, reason, and whatsoever he is or does, within or
without, because that those all, Flesh and Spirit.
and all that is in man, study after the world and the Flesh. Call Flesh
therefore, whatsoever (as long as we are without the spirit of God) we think
or speak of God, of faith, of good works, and of spiritual matters. Call
Flesh also all works which are done without grace, and without the working of
the spirit of God, howsoever, good, holy and spiritual they seem to be, as
thou may prove by the 5. to the Galathians ver. 19. and 20. where Paul
numbreth worshipping of Idols, witchcraft. ^nuie and hate, among the deeds of
the Flesh. And by the eight to the Romans ver. 3. where he says that the Law
by the reason of the Flesh is weak, which is not understood of unchastity
only, but of all sins, and most specially of unbelief, which is a vice
most wicked, and ground of all sins, and as thou call him which is not
renewed with the spirit, and borne again of Christ, Flesh, and all his deeds,
even the very motions of his heart and mind, his learning, doctrine, and
contemplation of high things, his preaching, teaching, and study in the
Scripture, building of Churches, founding of Abbaies, giving of Alms, Mass,
Mattin^, and whatsoever he does, though it seem spiritual, and after the
Laws of God. So contrariwise call him spirituall^ which is renewed in Christ,
and all his deeds which springs of faith, seem they never so gross, as the
washing of the Disciples feet done by Christ, and Peter's fishing after the
Resurrection, yea, and all the deeds of Matrimony are pure spiritual, if
they proceed of faith, and whatsoever is done within the laws of God, though
it be wrought by the body, as the very wiping of shoes and such like,
howsoever gross they appear outward. Without such understanding of these
words, thou can never understand this Epistle of Paul, neither any other
place in ye holy scripture. Take heed therefore, for whosoever understands
these words otherwise, ye same understands not Paul whatsoever he be. Tin. in
his Prol. to the To.

The meaning of this place following.
The Flesh profits nothing. John. 6. 63
The flesh of Christ profits nothing, to wit, if it be considered as
separated from his divine nature, and from his holy spirit, but it is the
spirit that gives life, meaning God dwelling in Jesus Christ corporally as
Paul says Col. 2. 9. To dwell reallie and indeed, reconciling the world unto
himself. Tindale.

To wit, Flesh profits not
if it be separated from the spirit, whereof it has the force that comes of
the power of the spirit, that the flesh gives us life and feeds. And
therefore that we may be truly fed and nourished with it, we must bring the
spiritual mouth of faith to receive it. The Bible note

Saint Austen expounds these words thus: Understand ye spirituallie the
things that I have spoken, ye shall not eat the body that ye see. Likewise
Chrysostom says, My words must be heard spirituallie: who so hears them
carnally or according to the flesh, gets nothing, nor has no profitte by
them.

FORGET.
How God is said to forget.
God is said to forget, Augustine
when he takes his mercy from us, forgetting his statutes, ordinances, and
commandments, and to remember us when we change and not he.

Although God take us out of this world, Calvin
yet forgets he us not, though he seem to forget us: he keeps those
that are his, always in his hand and custody. And as for those that are
damned, they be reserved as it were in chains, unto the day of executing the
sentence. Ye see then, that God does bear us always in mind. And when the
Scripture says, that he has forgot us, it is because we perceive not his
present succor, like as if a poor man that lingereth in pain, desire God to
help him, and feel not his help, nor sees any likelihood that God hears
him. Thus ye see after what sort it is said that he has forgotten us: but
yet for all that, he remembers us continually. Call. upon Job. fol. 257.

FORGIVE.
How it is understood.
Forgive us our trespasses, Mat. 6. 12.
as we forgive our trespassers.

We may not think that by forgiving unto our brethren, we shall obtain
forgiveness of our sins, but rather this is added for a plain and
infallible token to certify therewith our conscience, that we have through
faith in Jesus Christ for remission of our sins. For if we can find in our
hearts, unfeignedly to forgive unto our brethren their trespasses: it is a
most infallible token, that our sins are clean washed away and quite
forgiven. Sir. I. Cheek.

Because he knows that our nature is so weak, that we cannot but sin
daily: therefore he teaches us daily to repent, and to reconcile our selves
together, and daily to ask God forgiveness. Seeing he commands us to ask,
we may be bold so to do, and to believe that he will forgive us. No man
therefore needs to despair, that can repent and ask forgiveness, how deep
soever he has sinned. And me think, if we look a little near upon this
text, we needed not to make the Pope so great a God for his pardons. For Christ
(which is a man to be believed) shows us here a more sure way, yea, and that
a sensible way, which we may feel that we be pardoned, and our sins forgiven.

We can have no experience of the Popes things whether they be so or no? He can
with all his Pardons deliver no man of any Pargatorre that God puts us unto
in this world He cannot bless or heal any man, so mush as of a poor ^gue or
Toothache, which diseases yet by his own confession GOD puts on us, to purge
us from our sin. But where we cannot see, feel or have any experience at
all, that it so is, there is he mighty. If I were come home out of a land,
where never man was before, and were sure never man should come. I might tell
as many wonders as Master Moore does of Vtopia, and no man could rebuke me. But
here Christ makes thee sure of pardon, for if thou can forgive thy Brother,
GOD has bound himself to forgive thee. What if no man have sinned against
me? that were hard in this life. Nevertheless, if that profession be in thy
heart, that thou know that is thy duty to forgive thy brother for thy
fathers sake, and art obedient unto thy fathers ordinance, and would
forgive if any of thy brethren had offenced thee, and did ask thee
forgiveness, then have thou that same spirit, which God desires to be in
(...). Mark what Christ says above in the beginning of the (...) chapter:
Blessed be the merciful, for they shall have mercy. Do thou (...) thy
brethren that sin, and do thy best to a^^nd them, that thy fathers name
may be honored? Then have thou that whereby thou art sure of mercy, as soon
as thou desire it. And again, Blessed be the peace makers, for they shall be
Gods children, Lo, if there be any variaunce among thy brethren, that one
have offended the other, do thy best to set them at one, and thou have the same
thing that God (...) of (...), and ^orthwith he has bound himself to forgive
thee. Tindale in the 6. of Math.

FORNICATOR.
Look. Sa(...)

FORSAKE.
What it is to forsake a man's self.
IF any man will follow me; Ma 16. 24
let him forsake himself. To forsake himself, is utterly to (...) against
the will of the flesh, mortif^eng the affections of his mind, working the
glory of God, and the (...) of his neighbor, as is (...). Romans 15. 2.

None of them(says S. Luke) that refuses not all that he possesses can be my
disciple: that is, he that casts not away the love of all worldly things,
can be no scholar of Christ, to learn his doctrine. Tindale.

What it is to forsake the Lord.
And forsook the Lord, 2. Pa. 7. 2^.
God of their Fathers, etc. To forsake the Lord, God of their fathers, is to
despise and forsake the word of God, not so believe his promises, nor to walk
in his commandments, but to imagine another service of him, then he himself
has assigned in his word. T. M.

FORTUNE.
How nothing ought to be ascribed to fortune.
TO be had in favor it helps not to be cunning, but that all lies in Time
and Fortune. Thus the worldlings say, to prove that all things are lawful for
them, and attribute that to Chance and Fortune, which is done by the
providence of God. Geneua.

Thus the wicked worldlings are deceived, attributing to Fortune, that which is
ordered by the secret providence of God. The Bible note.

Augustine Augustine.
in his book against the Academites, says. It does displease me, that I have
so often named Fortune, albeit my meaning was not to have any Goddess meant
thereby, but only a chaungeable happening in outward things, either good or
evil. Of which word Fortune, are derived these words, which no Religion
forbids us to use: Forte, forsan, forsitan, fortasse, fortuito: y^ is,
Perhaps, peradventure, by fortune and by chance, which yet must al be applied
to y^ providence of God. And that did I not leave unspoken when I said, For
peradventure that which is commonly called Fortune is also ruled by sercet
order: and we call chance in things, but that whereof the reason and cause is
unknown. I said this indeed, but it repents me, that I did there so name
Fortune: Forasmuch as I see that men have a very evil custom, that whereas
they ought to say, It pleased God: they say, It pleased Fortune. Call. in. his
inst. 1. b. chap. 16. sect. 8.

Fortune and adventure are the words of Panim^, Basilius.
the signification whereof ought in no wise to enter into the heart of the
faithful. For if all prosperity be the benediction of God, and all adversity
his malediction, there remains no place to Fortune, in such things as come to
men. Basil. retract. li. 1. ca. 2.

FOOT.
What the foot does signify in scripture.
My foot stands right. Foot in the scripture is taken for the affection,
desire or will of the heart. As in the Psa. 36. 11. O let not the foot of
pride overtake me. T. M.

The meaning of this place following.
At the feet of Gamaliel. Act. 21. 3.
That is, his daily hearer. The reason of this speech is this, for that they
which teach, sit commonly in the higher place, speaking to their scholars,
which sit upon fourmes beneath, and therefore he says, At the feet of
Gamaliel. Beza.

What the feet of God signifies.
As his head signifies his divinity, Augustine.
so his feet signifies his humanity, the which is subject to Gods deity, as
our feet are unto our heads Psalm. 8. 6. Thou shall put all things in
subjection under his feet. In some places the Preachers of Gods word, be meant
by the feet, as in Deuteronomy. 33. 3. They that draw nigh his feet shall taste of
his doctrine.

FOOTE-STOOLE.
What this Foote-stoole was.
ANd a foote-stoole for our God. 3. Pa. 28. 2
The foote-stoole, etc. was the mercy seat, at which, and on which, God had
promised, the Hebrews to hear them, and speak unto them, which was upon the
Arc, as it appears Exo. 25. T. M.

And fall down before his foote-stoole, Psalm. 99. 5.
etc. That is, before his Temple or Arc, where he promised to hear, when they
worshipped him, as now he promises his spiritual presence, wheresoever his
Church is assembled. Geneua.

And remembered not his foote-stoole. Tree. 2. 1.
Alluding to the Temple or to the Arc of the Covenant, which was called the
footstool of the Lord, because they should not set their minds so low, but
to lift up their hearts toward the heavens. Geneua.

Until I (...) thy footstool. Act. 2. 35.
Christ is ye only^ redeemer, unto whom all power are subject and must obey.
Gene.

FOUR.

Of the fourth Watch.

ANd entreat them evil, four hundred years. Act. 7. 6.
That is not to be understood, that they stould be evil entreated, the whole
four hundred years, but by excess of speech, called Hyperbole, is signified,
that they should be evil entreated within ye space of 400. years. The Bible
note.

FOVRTEENE GENERATIONS.
Under whom the fourteen Generations were ruled.
THe first fourteen generations from Abraham to David, was under the rule of
Judges: Judges.
from David unto the captivity of Babylon, under Kings: Kings.
from captivity of Babylon, under high Priests. Priests.
And the last fourteen generations from the captivity of Babylon, ended in
Christ. Marl. fol. n.

FORM OF GOD.
What it is to be in the form of God.
Athanasius says, Nature, substaunnce, kind and form, be all one thing, Leo
says, What is it to be in the form of God? He answers, it is to be in the
nature of God. Chrysostom says, The form of God is the nature of God. S.
Austen says, As concerning the form of God, Christ himself says of
himself, I and my Father, are both one: again he says, The form is one,
because the Godhead is one. Jewel. fol. 88.

Look. Shape of God.

What it is to take the form of a servant.
Leo says, What is it to take the form of a servant? He answers,
doubtless, it is to take the perfection of nature, and state of man.
Chrysostom says, The form of a servant, verelie is the nature of a
servant. Saint Augustine says, When thou think of the form of a servant
in Christ, think of the shape of a man, if there be any faith in thee:
Again, We must believe and confess (says he) that Christ according to his
humanity, is visible, has the substance and property of a body is
contained in place and form of a servant, that is to say, in very truth he
took man.

And took on him the form of a servant. Phil. 2. 7.
If Christ being very God equal with the Father, laid aside his glory, and
being Lord, became a servant, and willingly submitted himself to most
shameful death, shall we which are nothing but vile slaves, through arrogancy
tread down our brethren, and preserve our selves? Geneua.

How this vocable (Form) signifies very bread and wine in the Sacrament.
S. Paul speaking of Christ's incarnation says, that he being in the form of
God, did humble himself, taking upon him the form of a man. By which words,
S. Paul meant not that Christ was like unto God, and not God indeed, nor yet
was like unto man, and not very man indeed: but that he was and is very God
and very man, having two substances, one of his godhead, and the other of his
manhood, united together in one person. And the ancient Doctors writing of
this Sacrament, when they speak of the forms of bread and wine, do use this
vocable (Form) as S. Paul uses it, to signify the very bread and very
wine, or the substance of bread and wine, and not the similitude or likeness
of bread and wine, without the substance, as you fantasy and imagine. Craumer.
302.

FOXES.
Of the Foxes that Sampson caught.
ANd Sampson went and took 300. Iudic. 15. 4.
Foxes, etc. If a man ask how Sampson got so many Foxes, he must understand,
that as there are sundry Regions, so are there also in them, many sundry
increase of things. In some place there are many horses, and those fair: In
some place, there is great abundaunce of cattle: In England there is great
plenty of Connies, and so is there in the Islands called Baleares. In those
Regions a man may easelie in one day, and in a little ground take 3. or 400.
Conies, which to some peradventure might seem incredible: And so it is said,
ye there is a very great abundance of Foxes in Siria, and specially in ye
borders of Iewrie. Wherefore Solomon in his Canticles says: Take Foxes for us,
which destroieth ye vineyards, for they delight most of al in ripe grapes. Yea,
and David says of the vngod^^e, the (...) be parts of Foxes, that is their
pray, so that their carcasses, shall be deuou^ed of them. And out of the
fourth chapter of Nehemias is gathered that the number of them was so great,
that they could in a manner, ouerturne the walls of the city. And Sampson
took them either by his own industry, or by the help of his friends. Pet.
Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 223.

FREE.
How we are free in Christ.
THen are the children free. Mat. 17. 26
Though we be made free by the death of Christ, yet ought we to be obedient
unto Magistrates, and to pay them such tribute as they do require of us. Sir.
I. Cheek.

FREE WILL.
How the word (Free Will) is not found in all the Scripture.
THis word Free-choise, or (as some men call it) Free Will, is not in all the
holy Sccipture, but is invented by proud men, which would set up their own
righteousness, and put down the righteousness of God, upon the which also they
have grounded their merits attributing righteousness and salvation to their
works, by the which thing they deny the merits of the passion of Christ.
Romans 3 24. Gal. 2. 16.

The Free Will of man before his fall.
Free Will was given to man when he was first created, Augustine
by the which he might have chosen either to sin or not to sin. August. 12.
b. 13. cha. of the city of God.

All men before sin had free will either to follow the devil or not.
Chrysostom Chrisosto^
in his sermon of the coming of our Lord in his 36. homely.

Man was made good, and by his free will was he made an evil man. Augustine
And shall he now (says S. Austen) being evil, make himself, good, seeing
that when he was good, he could not keep himself good.

He has set fire and water before thee, Ecc. 25. 16.
stretch out thine hand unto which thou will. Free Will before the fall of man
was an upright free will, before which, fire and water was laid of God, and
the first man did reach his hand to which he would. He did choose fire, and
forsook water. So the righteous Judge, the same which man being free did
choose, he did receive, he would have evil, and the same did follow him.
Augustine in his book of the new song, the 8. chapter.

But why God did not uphold man, Call in his inst. 1. b. ca. 15. se. 8
with the strength of his steadfast countenance, that rests hidden in his
own secret council: it is our part only to be so far wise, as with
sobriety we may. Man received indeed to be able if he would, but he had not
to will that he might be able. For of this will should have followed, steadfast
continuance. Yet is he not excusable, which received so much, that of his own
will, he has thought his own destruction. And there was no necessity to
compel God to give him any other then a mean will, and a frail will, that
of man's fall he might gather matter for his own glory.

Of the free will of man after his fall.
Man misusing his free will, Augustine
lost both himself and his will. Augustine in his Ench. to Laurence, the 30.
chap.

No man can believe, Augustine.
hope or love unless he will, but even the self same will to believe, to hope
and love, comes not but from God.

Free Will once made thrall, Augustine
avails nothing now but to sin. August. ad Boni. in his 3. b. and. 8. chap.

That we live well, Augustine
that we understand aright, we have it of God. Of our selves we have nothing
but only sin, that is within us. Aug. de verbis Apost. Ser. 10.

After that man had sinned with his free will, Augustine.
we were cast headlong down into necessity, as many as ever came of his
stock. Aug. against Fortunatus in the 2. disp.

It was showed in Adam, Augustine
what free will can do without help: it is able enough of it self to do evil,
but not unto goodness, except it be helped of God. Au. in his b. of the new song
cap. 8.

Man is apt and able to wound himself, Augustine
but he is not apt and able to heal himself: when he will he may be sick,
not when he will he may rise. Augustine upon the 98. Psalm.

All men at the first were created without fault or vice, Ambrose
and all our natures were in health, but by the transgression of ye same man we
have lost it. There hence is drawn mortality, there hence are so many
corruptions of the mind, there hence is ignorance a difficulty, unprofitable
cares and unlawful conc^^piscence^ etc. Amb. in his b. of the calling of the
Gentiles. chap. 3.

We had free will before sin, Chrisosto^
to work well, but after sin we had none, because we were not able by our own
power and strength after sin, to escape from the power of ye. devil: but as a
ship when the stern is broken, is driven hither and thither, where the tempest
will, so by the devil we are domen from one: sin to another, neither
hitherto can do any thing, but even as the devil will. And except God
deliver of with his strong hand of his mercy, we shall remain in bonds and
chains of sins unto death. Chrysostom in his 36. hom.

That man of his natural power without the spirit of God can do nothing but
sin, is proved by the words of Christ himself. He that abides in me (says
Christ) brings forth much fruit, for without me can ye do nothing: If a
man bide not in me, he is cast out as a branch and he shall burn. Here it is
plain, that free will without grace can do nothing that is acceptable before
God: Saint Austen Augustine
upon this place of John John. 15. 5.
says, Least any man should suppose, that the branch of it self, could bring
forth at the least way a little friute, therefore says he not, Without me
can ye do a little: but, Without me can ye do nothing. Therefore, whether it
be little or much, without me it can not be done. One of two must the branches
needs do, either abide in the Uine, or else burn in the Fire. If it be not in
the Uine, then it is in the Fire. D. Barnes.

What goodness can he do (says S. Austen) that is loft except he be
delivered from his misery. Augustine
Can he do any good by his free will? God forbid. For man evil using his
free will, did both loose himself, and also his free will. And as man being
alive, does kill himself, and when he has killed himself, he can not make
himself alive again: so likewise when we do sin by Free Will, and sin
has the victory, then is free will clear lost. For of whom a man is
overcome, unto him must he be servant.

Saint Austen declaring what goodness free will deserves without grace,
Augustine
says: Oh cursed free will without God. We have experience what Free Will is
able to do without God. Behold, man was made good, and by his Free Will, was
made an evil man. What shall an evil man by his free will forsaking God, make
a man good, Make good.
he being good, could not keep himself good. And now that he is evil, shall
he make himself good, when that he was good, he kept not himself good, and
now that he is evil, shall I say, I make my self good, etc. Here is the
very strength of free will, by his strength are we made miserable, and that
does experience learn. D. Barnes,

Saint Paul says, 2. Cor. 3. 5.
that we are not sufficiient to think any thing of our selves, as it were of
our selves, but our sufficiency is of God. Saint Barnard upon this place
says, what shall we say (says he) is this alonelie all the merit of
Freewill, that he does alonelie consent? Yea doubtless: not that that same
consent, in the which is all his merit, is not of God, (...)
when we can neither think, ye which is less then to consent any thing of our
selves, as though we were sufficient of our selves. These words be not mine,
but the Apostles, the which gives unto God, and not unto Free Will, all manner
thing that can be good, S. Barnard gives unto God. Now what strength has
free will, he can neither think good nor will, nor yet perform it. And there
is nothing, but either it is included, in thinking, in willing or in
perfourming, and all these he gives to God. D. Barnes.

Three blessings there are, Barnard in his 39. scene. of his little S.
which are necessary to us: the first is, preventing: the second is, helping:
the third is, of glory. He does prevent our conversation by mercy: he helps
our conversation by his grace: he does accomplish our ending with glory.
Unless the Lord do give these three blessings, Three blessings.
our bodies can give forth no fruit, neither can we begin any good thing,
before we be prevented by niercie: or do any good thing, until we be h^lpen by
grace: or that we can end in goodness, until we be filled with glory. I^
Northbrooke.

We will, Augustine
but it is God that wills it in us: We work, but it is God that works in
us, to work according to his godly pleasure. This is behoouefull for us, both
to believe and speak: This is a godly, this is a true doctrine, that our
confession may be humble and lowly, and that God ^a^e have the whole. We live
in more safety, if we give all unto God, rather then if we commit our selves,
part to our selves, and partly to God. Augustine de bono prese. ca. 13.

Man before his fall had free will: but after his fall, both he in himself,
and in all his prosteritie, utterly lost that free will. So that man can now
with nothing of himself that is good or acceptable before God. All the
abominations of the thoughts of men's hearts are evil. Genesis 6. 5. and 8. 21.
Out of the corrupt heart of man proceeds all wickedness. Math. 15. 19. We
are not apt of our selves to think any thing that pertains to the glory of
God. 2. Cor. 3. 5. It is the grace and goodness of God that works
altogether, whatsoever is good in us, for it is neither of him that wills,
nor of him that runs, but of God only that shows the mercy. He that
does believe, does believe willingly, and of his own accord, but that he
has a will to believe, is not of himself, but of GOD, for GOD does not only
offer mercy to our will, but also gives us a will to receive it: As Saint Paul
testifies: God works in us both to will and to persorme whatsoever is good,
and perteining to salvation. Philip. 2. 13. And where God gives not a will,
there cannot men believe, though grace and mercy be offered unto them. As in
John. 12. 37.

Without the grace of God, Augustine
Adam could not be good, yea, though he had free will: Wherefore God would not
leave him without his grace, although he left him in his freew-ill, because
that free will is sufficient to do evil: but to good it is but of small value,
if it be not aided with the goodness of ye almighty: which aid if man had
not forsaken through his free will, he had been always good: but he did
forsake it, wherefore he was also forsaken. August. in his book of correction
and grace. Chap. 11.

The counsel of Milenitan, in two Canons.
Free Will weakened to the first man, Canon. 1.
cannot be repaired and amended, but through the grate of Baptime, the which
after that it is lost, cannot be restored again, but by him which has power
to give it; wherefore the truth says, If the son make you free, then are you
free indeed.

The second Canon says: Canon. 2.
God does work so in the hearts of men, and to free will that if there be any
godly cogitation, any deliberation tending to the honor of God, and any
motion of good will all the same proceeds from God. For by him we may do
some good thing, and without him we can do nothing.

What have thou that thou have not received? Saint Barnard of free will.
Art thou created? Art thou healed? Art thou saved? Which of them have thou of
thy self? Which of the^ is not impossible for free will? Thou could not
create thy self when thou wast not made: nor justify thy self when thou wast
a sinner, etc.

Examples how God orders man's will.
God said to Abimelech king of Gerar, concerning Abraham's wife, I kept thee
also that thou should not sin against me, and therefore suffered thee not
to touch her. Genesis 20. 6.

Be not afraid (says Joseph to his brethren) can we resist the will of God?
You devised evil against me, but God turned it to good. Genesis 50. 19.

God says thus of Pharao: I will harden his heart: And in the 33. 19. of the
same book he said: I will show mercy and have compassion of whom it pleases
me. Exo. 4. 21.

A man may prepare his heart, but it is God that governs the tongue. Pro.
16. 1.

I know (O Lord) that it is not in man's power to order his own ways, or to
rule his own steps or goings. Iere. 10. 23.

I allow not that which I do, for what I would, that do I not, but that I
hate, that do I. Romans 7. 15.

Not that we are sufficient as of our selves, to think any thing, but our
ableness is of God. 2. Cor. 3. 5.

For it is God that works in you, both the will and the deed, even of his
good pleasure. Phil. 2. 13.

What little freedom of will Saint Paul had.
Read Romans 7. 14. etc.

FRVITE.
The meaning of these two places following.
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb. Luke. 1. 42.
Christ could not have been the fruit of the virgins womb, if he had not
taken the substance of his body of her substance, and that by the mighty
power of the holy ghost. Sir I. Cheek.

By their fruits ye shall know them. Mat. 7. 16.
Christ gives us this lesson, not to try the true doctrine from the false,
but a true professor from an hypocrite, otherwise our lives must be tried by
the gospel, and not the gospel by our lives.

FOUNDATION.
How Christ is the foundation of the Church, and not Peter.
Other foundation none can be laid, 1. Cor. ^. 1^.
but only that is laid already, which is Christ Jesus. Saint Paul found
great fault with the Corinthians that said: I hold of Apollo, I hold of
Paul, I hold of Peter: but the Catholics say, thou art Peter, and upon this
foundation, the pillars of the Church, which are ye Bishops are sure set. And
so devising an other foundation beside Christ, and contrary to S. Paul's
doctrine, would have all the Bishops of the world hold of Peter.

Gaderenes.
The understanding of this place following.
AND preached throughout all the city. Luke. 8. 37.
To wit, the City of the Gaderenes. And though Mark say in the 5. Chapter,
verse 20 that he preached it in Decapolis, they descent not, for Pliny
records. li. 3. Chap. 18. That Gadara is a town of Decapolis. So that
Decapolis was partly on this side Jordan, and partly on the other side. Beza.

GALGAL.
What this word signifies.
Joshua pitched in Galgal. Iosu. 4. 20.
Galgal is between Iordane and Jericho, of the East end of the city. The
word signifies by interpretation, taking away, because the Lord there took
away the reproof and shame of Egypt, as in the next chapter, verse 9. where
he says: This day have I taken the shame of Egypt from you, etc. Before
(says the Bible note) they were like to the uncircumcised Egyptians, whom
though they served, yet they disdained and judged them profane, and shameful.
This author says, that (Shame) in the 5. Chapter, verse 9. signifies
misery, wretchedness, contempt and despite, vileness, and bondage. Josephus
de Antiqui. li. 5. cha. 10. says, that Galgal signifies liberty. T. M.

GALILEANS.
How we ought not to judge rashly of the Galileans.
SUppose ye, Luke. 13. 2
that those Galileans were greater sinners then all the other Galileans,
because they suffered such punishment. The Jews took occasion hereby to
condemn them as most wicked men. Geneua.

We ought in no wise to judge rashly of them that receive punishments for
their misdeeds, nor yet to despise the^. For if our sins and lewdness were
openly known, we should be counted of like punishment. Again, God does
otherwhile punish some (as them upon whom the Tower fell in Siloe) for to
admonish other, that they perish not likewise. Sir I. Cheek.

The Galileans as I suppose, were they of whom certain had showed unto Christ
( Luke. 13) that Pilate had mingled their blood with their own Sacrifices.
Whereupon Ambrose in Luke notes their Sacrifice to have been abominable.

Euse. Eccle. Hist. lib. 1. Chap. 6. mencioneth the heresy of the Galileans
out of Josephus, to have spronge up of one Judas Galileus in the time of
Augustus, when Cyrenius was President of Iudaea, and under the said Emperor,
of an other called Simon Galileus under Copinius the President. They exhorted
the Jews to a lawelesse and carnal liberty, affirming that Tax and Tribute,
was nothing else but slavish servitude. They misliked moreover with the Jews,
that they suffered mortal men under God to reign over them. Of the same
opinion were the Galileans, in the time of Pilate, under the Emperor Tiberius.
Wherefore Judas (as Josephus writes) was hanged together with his complises.
Simon came to naught, and Pilate rewarded them under him as rebels deserved.
Antiqui. li. 20. Chap. 5. Bell. Jude. li. 2. Chap. 7. Luke. 13.

GALL.
What is signifie^ thereby.
AND closed me with Gall, Tr^. 3. 5
etc. Gall for sorrowfulness, as in the Psalm. 69. 21. They gave me Gall to
eat, etc. That is, they that should have comforted me, did me most grief, and
augmented my sorrow, as if one should give bitter meats to him that is
hungry. Howbeit that Prophecy was also fulfilled in our Savior Christ, of
whom David was here a figure, as in Saint Matthew. 27. T. M.

And given us water of Gall to drink. Iere. 8. 14.
That is, has brought us into extreme affliction, and thus they shall not
attribute this plague to fortune, but to Gods just judgment. Chap. 9. 15. and.
23. 15. Geneua.

I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness. Act 8. 23.
Or thine heart is full of despitefull malice, and devilish poison of impiety.
So that now Satan has thee ties in captivity in his hands. Deuteronomy. 29. 18.
Geneua.

GARDS.
What the Gards did signify.
ANd let them make ye gards of Riba^d, Nu. 15. 38
of Iacinct, etc. Such gards should the Christen have deeply fixed in their
hearts, considering what they are bound to the Lord, of what God, what a
service they have taken upon them, that they might with all diligence and
circumspection fulfill that which they have promised. T. M.

Read the text at this place. Nu. 15. 38. and thou shall learn why the Jews
did wear such borders upon their garments.

Look. Philacteries. Borders.

GARMENT OF HEALTH.
What the Garment of health is.
FOR he shall put upon me the garment of health. Esa. 61. 10
The Garment of health is faith, that works by charity, which is called the
wedding garment. Mat. 22. 11. This Garment (says the Prophet) shall Christ put
upon the Church. For all that believe in God, shall be saved through Christ,
and be his beloved children by election, and justified by his blood. Ephe. 1.
7. T. M.

GATE.
How this word Gate is taken in Scripture.
IN the Scripture, the word Gate, signifies judgment. Because men's causes
were wont to be debated there.

And it was the place where common assemblies were made. And finally it was
the seat of justice, and this is it that is meant in the Psalm. 118. 20.
where it is said, that the children of good men, and of such as are blessed of
God shall be maintained in the Gats, and put their enemies to flight. Calvin
upon Job. fol. 83.

Then Booz went unto the Gate. Ruth. 4. 1.
The Gates in the scripture do oftentimes signify the places where the people
did commonly assemble, and when judgments were given and causes determined,
for in old time was such things done in the gates. T. M

What is to be understood by the gates of Hell.
And the Gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Mat. 16. 18
The gates of cities for the most part are very strong, and have Perculies to
set before them. There by the name of Gates, all kind of force and munition is
noted. And by hell gates, all Satanicall and devilish power is to be
understood. These promises are great and most firm, which do pacify and
comfort the consciences of the faithful, when they consider themselves to be
so setteled and granted, that they know for a surety how they are able to
resist all the power of Satan, according to the saying of Saint Paul: There is
no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus. And if God be with us, who
can be against us, who spared not his own son, but gave him for us, how
then should he not with him give us all things, who shall lay any thing to
the charge of Gods chosen, etc. Marl. fol. 161.

What the gates of Syon signify.
Within the port of the daughter Syon. Psalm. 9. 14.
The ports or gates of the daughter Syon, are the companies of the good and
faithful, in which are recited the truth of God, and all that leads so life.
Psalm. 87. 2. T. M.

In the open assembly of the Church, says Geneua.

What is understood by the gates of Brass.
For he has broken the gates of brass. Psa. 107. 16
By the gates of brass and bars, are understood all instruments of help
for war, which (how many or strong so ever they be) profit nothing against
the Lord. A like manner of speech uses Christ of the gates of hell, for the
strengths and powers of them that be in hell. Math. 16. 18. The gates of hell
shall not prevail, etc. T. M.

When there seems to man's judgment no recovery, but all things are brought
to despair, then God chiefly shows his mighty power. Geneua.

How the gates do mourn.
Then shall the gates mourn and lament. Psa. 3. 26.
The gates shall mourn and complain because y^ not only the Soldiers shall
perish with the sword, but also the Judges and giver of Sentences. He takes
the place of judgment for the Judges, for in ye gates was judgment wont to be
given. Ruth. 4. 1. Or even the gates shall be destroyed, and no man shall enter
in or go out thereat. For the gates mourn if the people be not often seen
in them. T. M.

What it is to open the gates of righteousness.
Open me the gates of righteousness. Psa. 118. 19
To open the gates of righteousness, is to open unto the world the grace and
righteousness that comes from God. So Esaie. 26. 2. says: Open ye the gates
that the good people may go in, etc. He wills preachers to open Christ unto
the people, for he is the door through whom they must enter. John. 10. 9. T.
M.

He wills the doors of the tabernacle to be opened, that he may declare his
thankful mind. Geneua.

Open ye the gates that the righteous nation, Esa. 26. 2.
etc. may enter in. He assures the godly to return after the captivity, to
Jerusalem. Geneua.

What the gates of death are.
Has lift me up from the gates of death. Psa. 9. 13.
The gates of death are the judgments of death, the counsels of the wicked,
the congregation of Satan, the doctrines of falsenesse, and whatsoever leads
to death. T. M.

GELDED.
Look. Chastity.

GELOVSIE.
What the law of gelousie is.
THe law of gelousie seems to be a fear, Nu. 5. 12. etc.
and a certain nurture of wives, that they should be obedient unto their
husbands chaste, mannerly, and faithful, and such as give no occasion to be
suspect, and thereto served this law, while it kept them under, and gave them
no license to run at large, whereby they might have come in some suspect, and
so to have come to this great shame before the congregation. T. M.

After what manner. God is gelous.
I the Lord thy God, Exo. 20. 5.
am a gelous God. I am gelous, that is, I am the Lord that watches and looks
narrowly unto your wickedness, and will punish it secretly. And again, y^
seruently loves your goodlinesse, and reward it abundantly. T. M.

And will be revenged of the contemners of mine honor. Geneua.

He is called gelous, Deuteronomy. 4. 24
because he cannot suffer that any should fall from him. T. M.

For God is called a gelous God. Exo. 34. 14
God is called gelous, because he will not permit that any other Gods shall be
worshipped: but he only will be loved and, worshipped as God. The Bible note.

Wherefore Saint Paul was gelous over the Corinthians.
I am gelous over you with godly gelousie. 2. Cor. 11. 2.
For this cause was Saint Paul gelous over the Corinthians, because that he
had truly instructed them in the christen faith, and was afraid least they
being deceived and undermined, by the wily craft of them that slaundered him,
should fall away from the true doctrine that they had received. This godly
gelousie ought to be in all Bishops and Pastors. Sir. I. Cheek.

GENEALOGY.
Of the Genealogy of Adam and Christ.
IN Moses books the Genealogy of Adam is discribed, whose children are the
children of wrath and of death. In the new Testament the Genealogy of Christ
is set forth, in whom we are borne a new, and are made the children of God,
and heirs of the kingdom of heaven through Christ. Sir. I. Cheek.

Luke Luke 3. 23
ascends from the last Father to the first. And Matthew descends from the
first to the last. Matthew extends not his rehearsal farther then to Abraham,
which is for the assurance of the promise for the Jews. Luke refers it
even unto Adam, whereby the Gentiles also are assured of the promise, because
they came of Adam, and are restored in the second Adam. Matthew counts by the
legal descent, and Luke by the natural. Finally both two speaking of the
same persons, apply unto them diverse names. Geneua.

GENERATION.
How generation is taken in this place.
Which follow me in the Generation^ Math. 19. 28.
The Generation is (...) wherein the elect shall begin to live a new ^y^^
that is to say, when they shall enioie this heavenly inheritance, does in
body and soul. Beza.

GENTILES.
How God chose the Gentiles to praise him.
THis people have I made for my self, Esai. 43. 21
and they shall show forth my praise: To show forth the praise of the Lord, is
to preach the remission of sins, and the deliuorance from death and hell, and
the giuenesse of everlasting life by the mercy of God for Christ's sake. A like
manner of speaking use th D^u^d in the Psalm. 22. 22. where he being the figure
of Christ, says. In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee, etc. Thus
should the Gen^iles and Heaten praise him, which people he chose for himself,
as ye may see in the text. For the Jews (which were signified by Jacob) would
not do it, but put their confidence in keeping of the law. This does the
Prophet vpbraid them with, in the person of God, saying: Thou gave me not the
young breasts, etc. As who should say, say not that thou have given me many
sacrifices, both because thou gave them not to me only, but unto my Ca^ues,
and Baals and other I^o^ls. And also because I never set greatly by them, nor
greatly required them. They grieved me always, when the faith and devotion of
the giuers was away. The Sheep of thy burnt offeringes broughtest thou not
unto me, neither did thou glorify me with thy sacrifices, but did
only satisfy thine own superstitions. I compelled thee not to worship me
with thine offeringes, but because thou so ready offeredst such things unto
Idols after the manner of the heathen I commanded that they should not be
offered unto other Gods, but unto me. Of whose gift thou receiuedst them, etc.
None of all these profited not me, in as much as thou leftest off the things,
which I chiefly required, righteousness, faith, and judgment. Math. 23. ^3.
T. M.

How the Gentiles found that they sought not for.
What shall we say then that the Gentiles which followed not righteousness,
Romans 9. 30
have atteined unto righteousness. So then the Gentiles had no works to
prepare and pr^eure Gods mercy before hand, and as for that that the Gentiles
attained to that which they sought not for, the mercy of GOD is to be thanked
for it. And in that the Jews atteined not to that they sought after, they can
thank none for it but themselves, because they sought it not aright. Beza.

GENTLENESS.
What a virtue Gentleness is.
Gentleness is, when a man is gentle and tractable in his conversation, and in
his whole life. For such as will be true followers of the Gospel, must not be
sharp and bitter, but gentle, mild, courteous, and fair spoken, which should
encourage other to delight in their company: which can wink at other men's
faults, or at least, expound them to the best. Which will be well content to
yield and give place to other, contented to bear with those, which are
froward and intractable, as the very Heathen said: Thou may know the
manners of thy friend; but thou must not hate them. Such a one was our savior
Christ, as every where is to be seen in the Gospel. It is written of Peter,
that he wept so often as he remembered the sweet mildness of Christ which he
used in his daily conversation. It is an excellent virtue and most necessary
in every kind of life. Luther upon the Gal. fol. 262.

GIVEN.
To whom it is given to know the mysteries of God.
TO you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God. To you, that
is, to you that are without deceit, and are not curious, nor trust in any
thing that pertains to man, it is given of my Father of his merciful
goodness, to know the mystery (that is the secret) of the kingdom of God,
that is of the Gospel, in which is taught the kingdom of God, which is our
righteousness, peace, and joy in the holy ghost. Romans 10. which is the
kingdom of all mercy, and the kingdom of forgiveness of sins for Christ's
sake. But unto them that are without, that is, unto such as are curious, and
trust more in their own works, then in the righteousness of Christ, are all
things spoken in parables, that is, all that they hear is even as obscure and
dark unto them, as though they were indeed parables, which (...) God therefore
suffers to be done, that when they see they should see and not discern, and
so forth (...) it follows in the text. Tindale.

GVIDE.
Who is the guide of a woman's youth.
WHich forsakes the guide of her youth, Pro. 1. 17.
and forgets the (...) of her God. Guide of (...) that is her (...) which is
her head and gu^^ to (...) her from whom she ought not to depa^t but remain in
his sublertion, and not forget the covenant of her God, which is the promise
made in marriage. Geneua.

GIFT.
What the gift of God is.
THat thou stir up the gift of God that is in thee^ 2. Tim. 1. 6.
The gift of God is a certain lively flame kindled in our hearts, which Satan
and the flesh labor to quench, and therefore must nourish it, and stir it
up. The Bible note.

The difference between gift and grace.
Look. Grace.

GITHITH.
What it signifies.
TO the chaunter upon Githith, Psalm. 8.
etc. Githith after some, signifies as much as for the wine press, after some
concerning the Gethites, after other some, it is an instrument of music. T. M.

Whether Githith signify an instrument of music, or a kind of tune, or the
beginning of some notable and well known Ballad. I leave it uncertain. For as
for those that think the Psaline was called so, because it was made in the
city of Gith, then fetch their fained exposition too far off. Of the three
former opinions, it makes no great matter which a man take. Calvin.

GLORY.
What Glorious
Glory is nothing else but a praise, most abund^lie published. (...) 63.

How glory does follow true (...)
Glory is not to be sought for of men, but glory of her own accord,
customablie does follow true virtue.

How the glory of the Lord is taken in this place following.
And in the morning ye shall see the glory of the Lord. Exo. 16. 7.


The glory of the Lord is (...) (...) for the bright (...) ^ight that was
seen in the Cloud, of which glory the (...) makes mention. (...)

What is signified by the glory of God, in these places following.
Because the glory of the Lord, had fulfilled the house of the Lord. 2. Par.
7. 1
The glory of the Lord fulfilling the house, was a visible Cloud pre(...) y^
God ought to be preached, praised and magnified, throughout the whole world,
in the congr^gation of the faithful. As he says Nu. 14. 22. T. M.

For the glory of the Lord shall appear. Esaie. 40. 5
The Prophet calls the glory of the Lord, the righteousness that should
be showed by the Gospel, whereby we should become righteous in the sight of
God the father, for his son Christ's merits. This glory shall all flesh see,
that is, all men, as well the Jews as the Gentiles that believe. A like saying
have we after, in the 60. 1. The glory of the Lord shall rise upon th^e. T. M.

What is understood by glory in this place following.
And we saw the glory of it, etc. John ^ohn. 1. 14.
says not we saw his essence, but we saw his glory. No man sees nor has
seen, the very essence of the word. But the beleening Apostles saw his
glory. The which as it was (...) seen of three of the Disciples in the mount
(...). Even so by his glorious resurrection and asce^tion, it did might(...)
thine, and was openly exhibited to be seen of all the Disciples. Therefore by
this word Glory, he understands those things which set forth the glory
of the word, that is to say, which are certain sure tokens of his (...)mitie,
goodness, wisdom, and power. Marl. upon John. fol. 21.

GLORIFY.
What it is to glorify God.
TO glorify God is to attribute all glory unto him, and to praise him with
heart, with mouth, with confession, and with behavior. Hemmyng.

How God is glorified in his son.
That the Father may be glorified in the son. John. 14. 13
The Father is glorified by the son, when we knowledge and give thanks, that
he gave his son to us to save us. Tindale.

GLOTTONIE.
What glottonie is.
NOt in glottonie. Romans 13. 13
By glottonie he means feasts and bankets: but not all kind of feasts, but
as Ambrose says. Prodigal feasts, which are made either at the common charge
of every one of the guestes, or which are made by courses by good fellows and
companions, wherein men pass the bounds of all shame. For every one of the
guests thinks that to be his feast: And therefore he dares both speak and
do whatsoever he thinks good, but he which is bidden to an others table, is
commonly brideled with some modesty and shamefastness not to presume to
speak any thing that is uncomely. And peradventure Job feared least the
feast of his children were such manner of feasts, and therefore he daily
sacrificed unto God for them. And what is wont to happen at such riotous feasts
the head of John Baptist declares, which was given to that wanton and
dissolute maiden. And how great the outragiousnesse of men was, and
especially of the elders amongst the Ethniks, it may hereby be known, for
that when they had well drunk, they were wont having garlands on their heads,
and minstrels with them, to go in banketting from place to place, as wanton and
young folk, to speak and to do what they lysted, so that oftentimes they
fell to unclean acts, and to contentions, as Paul here declares. Which
thing the Poets have cunningly painted unto us in the feasts of the Centaures
and of the Lapothites. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 434.

GNOSTICI.
What ma^^er of heretics they were.
THey were heretics, Heretics.
which with swelling pride that they knew all things so termed themselves.
Some call them Barborites, for their beastly life. Some write that they b^dded
out of the Nicolaites. Some other that they sprung out of Carpoerates.
Epiphanius says, that the Valentinians called themselves Gnostici. All women
among them are common. Their sacrifices were too too beastly, as Epiphanius
writes. They abhorred fasting, saying it was of the Devil, they said Christ
was not born of Marie, but revealed by Marie, that he took no flesh indeed,
but according to appearaunce. Epiphan. haere. 26.

They would (says M. Eliote) on good Fridaie, about the Sun set, assemble
men and young women together, not sparing daughter nor sistter, after nine
months passed, they met again in the same place. And then they pluked the
children newly borne from their mothers, and cutting them in pieces and
receiving their blood in pottes and cups, they burned the bodies into Ashes,
which they did mix with the blood, and preserved it, to put in their meats
and drinks: They also affirm that neither the law of nature, nor laws made
by men were good, nor that the virtues were nothing.

GOD.
How there is no God but one.
THere is none other true and living GOD, One God.
but he that is known in Jesus Christ, for whosoever does not acknowledge him
in Jesus Christ, knows him not at all. All other Gods that men do call Gods,
are no Gods all, but only by the imagination of men. And therefore it is that
Paul did write to the Ephesians, y^ the Pagans were without Gods. For albeit,
many by name and by fancy, yet notwithstanding they had none indeed, seeing
they were ignorant of the true God. Pet. Viret.

How God is the savior of all men.
It is in Timothy, 1. Tim. 4. 10
how God is called the savior of all men, and especially of the faithful: In
which words, this word Thotes, that is, savior, is to be taken, not as though
God gives to all men saluation^ but as it signifies, that he preserves and
defends all men from many evils, which otherwise the Devil practices
against them. For so great is his rage against mankind, Savior of all men
that if he were not restrained he would destroy all things, he would suffer no
commonwealth nor church, but would bring to naught both goods and all things,
whatsoever pertain to man's life. Wherefore in such sort is God the savior of
all men, in that he drives away so great evils from all men. But as touching
eternal salvation, that is to be understood of the elect only. And
therefore it is added, and especially of the faithful. For, forasmuch as they
are predstinate, they above all other attain unto this benefit, etc. Pet. Mar.
upon the Romans fol. 307.

Who they be that are without God.
And were without God in this world. Ephe. 2. 12
They are without God which either believe not that there is a God, or if they
do believe, Without God.
yet do they not believe to be such one as be is. And truly as many as are
without the true living and eternal God, it is well said that they are without
God. Sir I. Cheek.

How God is Almighty
Some do think God to be almighty, Almighty
because he can do all things, and then it should follow that he were not
almighty. For all things he cannot do. He cannot save the unfaithful, he
cannot restore virglnitie once violated, says Saint Thomas and also Hierome,
writing to Paul and Eustachinum. He cannot sin says. Dunce. He cannot deny
himself says Saint Paul. Now if these men's learning were allowed, then might
not God be almighty, because there is somewhat that he cannot do. But they
that are accustomed with the Scripture does know that he is called almighty,
not because he can do all things, but because there is no superior above him,
but y^ he may do all that he will, and all that his pleasure isto do, that
may he bring to pass, and no power is able to resist him. But he has no
pleasure to make himself a liar, nor to make his Scripture false. And yet
notwithstanding he abides almighty, for he may do all things that he will.
I. Frith.

How God did forknowe the fall of Adam, and yet was not the cause thereof.
A prudent Father does foresee by some outward tokens, that his son will one
day come to an evil ending. Neither is he deceived in his foresight, for he
is slain being in adultery. But he is not slain because his Father foresaw
that he would be slain, Foreknovvledge of God.
but because he was an adulterer. And therefore Saint Austen or whosoever it is
that was the author of the second book, De Gentium vocatione, Chap. 4.
speaking of the murder which Caine committed, says: God veril^e did
fore-knowe to what end the fury of that mad man would come, and yet because
Gods foreknowledge could not be deceived, it does not thereupon follow that
necessity of sinning did urge the crime upon him, etc. S. Austen de libero
arbitrio. li. 3. Chap. 4. says: As thou by thy memory do not compel those
things to be done, y^ are gone and past, so God by his foreknowledge does not
compel those things to be done which are to come. And as thou remembrest some
things that thou have done, and yet have not done all things which thou
remembrest: so God foreknoweth all things which he does, not and yet does not
all things which he foreknoweth. But God is a just revenger of that whereof he
is no evil author, and so forth. Bullinger. fo. 490.

How God is said to laugh.
He that dwells in heaven shall laugh them to scorn, the Lord shall have
them in derision. Psalm. 2. 4. And in an other place: As for the scornesull he
shall laugh Laugh.
them to scorne^ God is not of such affection as man is, to be moved with
mockage and laughter, for he reioyseth not in the hurt of man, but at his
amendemen^^. For God abhors scornful persons, but as that man which
laugheth at other men, is farthest from a mind to help them, and to remedy
their griefs, so is God to such as despise his commandment, set light by
his threateninges, and are not mo^ed with his promises. This is Gods laughter
and scorning. Augustine.

How God is said to sleep.
Look. Sleep.

How God is said to awake.
God is said to awake, Awake
when he does straight way without any tarrieng help, succor and deliver
his ele^t and chosen out of their troubles. Math. 8. Augustine.

How God is said to forget.
Look. Forget.

How God is said to sit.
Look. Sit.

How God is said to stand.
Scripture attributes standing unto God, Standing
for long sufferance, wherewith he calls us to repentance. Augustine.

How God is said to rise.
Arise O God. Rise.
The rising of God is the declaring of his power, against his enemies. Arise O
God, that is, step forth, and thew thy power against mine euimies to my
deliverance: as in the Psalm. 3. 7. Up God and help me. T. M.

How God is said to walk.
Look. Walk.

How God is said to be a shooter.
He has bent his bow (says David. Psalm. 7. 12. 13) and made it ready, Shooter
he has prepared weapons of death, and ordained arrows to destroy, that is,
he will avenge evil men, and will reward them for their oppression, he will
punish them for their ungracious devises, except they amend He has whet his
sword: and well may god be compared to a shooter, for as a shooter, y^ less or
more he draws his shaft, his stroke is thereafter, and if he draw far and up
to the iron, then it paieth home as they say, then it gives a mighty stroke:
so god sometimes differreth to punish me^ of their sins, and therefore except
they amend when he punishes, he will draw his shaft to y^ head, and strike most
grieuouslie. There fore let us remember that God is a shooter, and heap not up
his wrath against us, neither prolong the riches of his goodness, which
leads us to repentance. Romans 1.

How God is said to remember.
Look. Remember.

How God is said to be angry.
Look. Anger.

How God only forgiueth sins.
It pertains to God only to forgive sins, Sin
and to give the Holy ghost. He alone forgiueth sins, that alone died for
our sins. Ambrose in his 9. b. and. 76. Epistle.

It is the office of God only to quicken within, and to take away sin,
which says by the Prophet, I am he that puts away your iniquities and
sins. Cyril. in his. 7. book

For to forgive sins pertains only to God, therefore every man that
sins is the servant of sin. There, ye are servant and bondmen of sin,
because ye are sinners. Moreover, because it was likely that they should say,
for all that we be under such bondage, yet we have sacrifites and Priests,
which will make us clean of our sins: he says, that even they also be
servant and bonds, for all men have sinned and want the glory of God.
Theophilact, upon the 1. chap of Luke.

How God is said to have shoulders.
God is said to have shoulders, Shoulders

How God is said to come down.
And the Lord came down to see, Come down.
etc. God is said to come down, when he does any thing in the earth among
men, that is not accustemed among men^ in manner showing himself present among
men, by his wonderful work. As in the Psa. 18. 9. T. M.

How God is said to look.
And the Lord looked unto Abel and to his offering. Genesis 4. 4.
The Lord looked: Look.
that is, he was pleased with Abel and his Offering, but with Cain and his
Offering was he not pleased, and there he says that he looked not thereto. The
same use of speaking is also in the second of Kings. chap. 16. 12.

Why God is said to search.

How God cannot be shut up in a Pixe.
God is infinite, Pixe.
incomprehensible, unmeasurable, higher then the high heavens, iower then the
deep bottomless waters: he measures the wide world with his spanne, and
contains all enclosed in his fist. With him y^ light dwells, and the sun
beams are at his ordering. By him is ruled light and darkness, life and death,
and all together. Wherefore when thou can enclose in a Bore, the raging Seas:
when thou can pin up the Sun (being but a creature) in thy Pixe, then
will I grant thee to have power over things infinite and incomprehensible.

In the mean time, I must take it impossible by carnal capacity: and also by
spiritual judgment, grounded upon the word of God and by the gift of reason,
whereby all men considering the work of God in the creation, may know their
Creator to excel all creatures far, and that he can therefore be made by no
creature, much less can he lie enclosed in a Box of an inche and an half
deep, when the Priest will mumble up four words in a corner: and there be
tied till he wax foistie, unless the Priest loose him. A. G.

How God is called a Rock.
The Lord is my Rock. 2. Re. 22.^
Godly men have called the Lord by diverse names, according to their faith,
that is, as they thought of God within themselves, Rock.
and as they also had proved. As David here calls him his rock, his Castle,
his deliverer, his strength, his shield, his horn of defense. Psalm. 18. 1. T M.

By the diversity of these comfortable names, he shows how his faith was
strengthened in all temptations. Geneua.

God is called a Rock, because he and his word lasts for ever. He is sure to
trust to, and a present comfort to bel^^uers, and their singular defense at all

How God is not changed.
If I shall speak evil against any Nation (says the Lord) and that Nation
shall repent, I will also repent me of that evil which I said I would do. And
that Jeremy might more manifestlier understand the things that were spoken,
he bad him go into the house of the Potter, where he saw the Potter make a
vessel of claie, which was broken in the hands of the workman. But the Potter
made again another vessel of the same claie. So says the Lord, if they
repent, I will also repent: I do now make for them evil things, but for evil
things I will make good. Not changed.
And yet as I have said, he changes not his sentence, because such
threatenings and promises do depend upon a condition which is sometimes
changed, when as God abides the self same. Of this thing right well writes
Chrysostom upon Genesis in his 25. homely: The Lord commanded Noe to build an
Arc, and threatened that after an 120. years, he would destroy all mankind by
a flood: but when in the mean time, they nothing at all profited, he cut off
20. years, and sent the flood in y^ hundred year, and yet was not God
changed, but the conditions of men veried. The same Chrysostom also upon
Math. in his 65. homely, when he interprets this: Uerelie I say unto you,
ye which have forsaken all things, etc. demands: Was not Judas one of the
twelve? And shall Judas sit upon the seats, and judge the twelve Tribes of
Israel? Did Christ change his sentence? No (says he) but Judas was changed.
Which self same thing, we must judge of the city of Niniue, and of King
Ezechias, whom God pronounced should die. For neither Niniue at that time
perished, nor Ezechias di^d, because they were changed. God said at the
beginning, that the fear of man, should be upon beasts: but it happens
contrary. For men are now afraid of Lions, Bears and Tigers, because they are
of them oftentimes torn: but that comes hereof, because the condition of
men is changed, and not the council of God. Pet. Mart upon Iudie. fol. 175.

How God hears no sinners.
God hears no sinners, John. 9. 31
that is, he hears none that repents not, nor is not in mind to leave
their evil life. Tindale.

Saint Austen says: This was not spoken of the Lord, but of him that had
already his bodelie eyes restored, Sinner.
but the ei^s of the heart was ^ot yet opened, and therefore he thought of the
Lord that he was but a Prophet: for afterward, knowing that he was the Son of
God, he worshipped him. (...)
But the Lord himself, when two did pray together in one Temple, a Pharisie
an^ a Publicane does say, that the Publicane confessing his sinnes^ was more
justified then the Pharisie, boasting his merites^ (...)
for although being justified, he ceased not to be a sinner, yet while he was
a sinner, he did pray and confess his sins, that he might be justified, and
being heard, he was justified that he might cease to be a sinner: and truly he
should not cease to be a sinner, unless he were heard being yet a sinner.

This place does not so mean, that God will hear no sinners, that is always
ready to repent, but of such as will never repent, but still continue in their
sins.

We must understand, that there be two kind of sinners: They that acknowledge
their sins and repent unfeignedly, are heard and forgiven of God. Math. 9.
13. and. 28. Eze. 18. 21. But they that do of an infidelity continue, in
their sinful abominable living, and despair of the mercy of God, shall
never be heard. John. 5. 16. Sir. I. Cheek.

How God tempts no man to evil.

How we are made like unto God.
After his own likeness. Genesis 1. 27.
That is after the shape and Image, which was before appointed for the Son of
God. The ^hiefe part of man which is the soul, Like.
is made like unto God, in a certain proportion of nature, of power, of
working, so that in that^ we are all made like unto God. T. M.

This Image and likeness of God in man, is expounded, Ephesians. 4. 24.
where it is written that man was created after God in righteousness and true
holiness, meaning by these two words, all perfection, as immortality,
wisdom, truth, innocence, power, etc. The Bible note.

For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire. Deu. 4. 24.
Because God proves his by afflictions, Consuming fire
therefore he is called a consuming fire. Heb. 12. 29. And because he consumes
the unfaithful remednesse, for there is nothing that can resist his anger
toward them. T. M.

How Gods ordinance may not be broken.
There were some orders in the Primative Church commanded by God, Ordinance
and some there were devised by man, for the better training of the people.
Such orders as were commanded by God, may in no wise be changed, only
because God commanded them. For as God is everlasting, so is his word and
commandment everlasting. On the other side, such orders as has been devised
by men, may be broken upon some good consideration, only because they were
men that devised them. For as they be mortal, so all their wisdoms and
judgments be but mortal. And so indeed, as touching such things as has been
ordained by men, we are not bound of necessity to the order of the Church: but
such things as God has commanded preciselie by his word, may not be
broken, by any custom or consent.

Of Gods consolation in trouble.
And that because we should not put our trust in our selves, ^. Co. 1. 9.
but in God. God does help and deliver us, when we do patiently bear his
cross, Consola^ion.
that is to say the persecution, trouble and adversity, that he does send
unto us. For God will never forsake them, that do patiently wait for his aid
and succor. Again they y^ will not wait for his help, but go about without
him to help them selves, by there own works and wisdom, or are impatient in
their troubles, them does he forsake utterly in the mids of their
afflictions. Sir. I. Cheek.

What Gods curse is.
Gods curse is the taking away of his benefits. Curse.
As God cursed the earth, and made it barren: so now, hunger, dearth, war,
pestilence and such like, are yet right curses, and signs of the wrath of God,
unto the unbelievers: but unto them that know Christ, they are very blessings,
and that wholesome cross and true Pur^^torie o^ our flesh, through which all
must go that will live godly and be saved. As thou read. Math. 5. 10.
Blessed are they that suffer persecution for righteousness sake, etc. And Heb.
12. 6. The Lord chasteneth whom he loves, and scorgeth all the children that
he receives. Tindale.

What God appoints, and no more.

Therefore let the Preacher of the truth be of good comfort, though Satan with
all his legion of devils, the world, and all the mighty Princes thereof do

most commonly forsake the true God and serves him.

GODHEAD IN CHRIST.
How Christ's Godhead is understood.
FOr in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodelie. Col. 2. 9.
We must beware that we do not with the Antropomorphi^es, think that God has
a bodily shape, because the Apostle says, that the Godhead dwells in Christ
bodelie, for that is as much to say, that the Godhead does dwell truly and
naturally in Christ, being a (...) and^ (...) God, and that therefore he is a
sufficient treasure of all (...) riched. Sir. I. Cheek.

In saying that the Godhead is reallie in Christ, he shows that he is very
God. Also saying, In him, he declares two distinct natures. And by this word
(Dwells) he proves that he is there forever. Geneua.

How Christ in his Godhead is every where.
How may Christ be called a stranger, Origin
is he departed into a strange country? Seeing he is with us unto the worlds
end, and is among them that he gathered in his name.

Aun^were.
Christ is both God and man, 2. natures in Christ.
having in him two natures, and as man he is not with us unto the worlds end,
nor is present with his faithful gathered together in his name. But his divine
power and spirit is ever with us. Paul (says he) was absent from the
Corinthians in body, but he was present with them in spirit. So is Christ
gone hence (says he) and absent in his humanity, which his divine nature is
every where. And in these saiengs we reserve to both his natures their own
properties. Origin in Math. homil. 33.

GODS MERCY.
Of such as presume too much thereof.
Many do presume so much of Gods mercy that they sin at pleasure, and
repent at leisure. But be not seduced says S. Paul, for God is not mocked,
whatsoever a man sows, that shall he reap. Hemmyng.

GODLY SORROVV.
What godly sorrow brings to a man.
FOr godly sorrow causes repentaun^^, etc. ^. Co. 7. 10
There be two manners of sorrow. The one comes of God, and ingendereth
repentaun^e (...) life. The other comes of the flesh, and breeds
desperation unto death. We have examples of both in Cain and David, in Judas
and Peter. For they all sorrowed, but the sorrow of Cain and of Judas was
fleshly and carnal, and therefore being without godly comfort, it did drive
them to desperation. Whereas David and Peter in their godly sorrow, did fly
unto the father of mercies, with a true repentant heart, and were received
again into the favor of God. Sir. I. Cheek.

Whose heart Gods spirit does touch, he is sorry for his sins committed
against so merciful a father, and these are the fruits of his repentance, as
witness David's and Peter's tears. Others which are sorry for their sins,
only for fear of punishment, and Gods vengeance, fall into desperation, as
Cain, Saul, Achitophel and Judas. Geneua.

GODLINESS.
What Godliness is.
Godliness is not made of words, as wood is made of Trees, but it is an
earnest love proceeding from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an
unfeigned faith, in which we may glorify God, and do good to his people.
Paul was godly, when he gloried in nothing but in the cross of Jesus Christ,
by which the world was crucified unto him, and he unto the world. They are
godless hypocrites, which in word confess they know God, but in deed do
deny him. They are Christ's which have crucified the flesh with the affections
and concupiscence of it. They are of their father the Devil, that in
wickedness do the desire of the Devil, etc. M. Deering.

GOG AND MAGOG.
What they were, and what they do signify.
SAint Austen in his 20. book De ciuitate Dei, wills by Gog, to be
signified, the glorious hypocrites of the world, and by Magog the open enemies
of righteousness pretending the contrary. As testifies Berosus the Chaldean,
in the first book of his histories and 5. chapter. Gog was a mighty governor
in the land of Sabea and Arabia the rich, under Nimroth the great king of
Babylon, and there ruled with Sab^s his Father, in the 18. year of his reign.
In the 38. Chapter of Ezechiel^ Prophecy. ver. 2. he is called the chief
Prince of Mosoch and T^^bal whom some Expositours takes for Capadoce and
Spain. But after the opinion of S. Hierom and Isidorus, which was a Spaniard,
the Hebrew takes this Thubal for Italy, which is much more agreeable to the
purpose. Magog was the second son of Iaphet, which was the third son unto
Noe. This Magog (as witnesses Josephus, in the first book of his Antiquities
the 11. chapter) was the first beginner of the Magogites, whom the Greeks
called the Scythians, and we now the Tartarians. And all the chief Writers
sp^cifieth the Turks of them to have taken their first original. Now mark
this wonderful mystery, and consider therein both the time and story, so
shall ye well perceive the Holy ghost to mean none other here, by this Gog
and Magog, but the Romish Pope and Mahomet, Pope and Mahomet
with their blasphemous and wicked generations. Search the Chromcles and ye
shall find that their beginning were base, and estate simple, before the
thousand years were fulfilled. But after that, they grew up so high, by their
fained simplicity and simulate holiness, that they became the two chief
Monarchs of the earth, and so in process ruled the universal world, etc. Bale.

Set thy face against Gog, Eze. 38. 2.
and against the land of Magog, Which was a people that came of Magog the son
of Iaphet. Genesis 10. 2. Magog also here signifies a certain Country, for
that by these two enemies, which had the government of Greece and Italy, he
means the principal enemies of the Church. Geneua.

How Gog and Magog shall be destroyed.
These same things be spoken of Gog and Magog in Ezechiel. 38 and. 39. and in
Apoc. 20. For Ezechiel says, that Gog and Magog after they have done their
mischief in destroieng and slaieng, they shall themselves at last be destroyed
in the mountains of Israel, which albeit, it may be understood of the last
judgment, yet I think it to signify the Battles which the godly have and
shall have in this last old age, with the Popish Emperors, Kings and Turks,
which all shall be overcome in the Hills of Israel, that is in the places where
y^ Church of Christ dwells in which the Gospel is preached and received, and
the people truly in the faith of the Son of God, one only Mediator, call
upon their heavenly Father. For the Pope and Turk shall not be overcome, but
by the Son of God fighting for his Church, as ye shall see it cleerelie in
Daniel. 12. chap^ saying: Michael (which is Christ) the great Captain shall
stand forth for the defense of the peoples children. But both in Daniel and in
Ezechiel, they be prophesied many great destructions, which with all our
hearts, we beseech God to mitigate them. Melancthon upon Daniel.

GOLD.
What is meant by gold, silver, and precious stones.
IF any man build upon this foundation, ^. Co. 13. 12
gold, silver, or precious stones, etc. That is, if any man prech purely the
word of God, which is likened to gold, silver and precious stones, because y^
as these are not consumed with material fire, but rather made more pure, even
to y^ pure word of God, suffers neither hurt nor damage in spiritual fire,
that is, Temptation and persecution. Tindale. fol. 43.

What Gold, Frankencense and Mirrhe, do signify.
Presented unto him gifts, Mat. 2. 11.
Gold, Frankencense and Mirrh. The Persians manner was not to salute Kings
without a present, and therefore they brought of that which was most precious
in their Country, whereof, every one of them offered. Geneua.

The three wise men that came out of the East, anon after Christ's nativity,
brought with them these 3. presents, Aurum, Thus and Mirrha. Gold to declare
that he was a mighty King: Frankencense, to declare that he was a Priest, and
should offer unto the Father upon the Altar of the Cross, the sacrifice of
propitiation for the sins of the world: And Mirrhe to bury h^^ withal. For
Mirrhe is not only a sweet odori^erous thing, but also of that nature that
it preserves dead bodies from putrefaction Ric. Turnar.

GOLGATHA.
What this word Golgatha signifies.
THis word Golgatha, Ma. 27. 33.
is a Chalde word, signifieng a head: for which the Hebrews say Gulgoleth of
the verb Galal, which signifies ^o fold or wrap in, of the which comes
Galgal, a sphere, a circle, a bowl: Gulgoleth is a name for y^ head, because
of the roundnesse thereof. But this place was without the gate, on the North
side of mount Sion, in the which malefactors were put to death: for the which
cause the place was counted more reproachful. There would they have Christ to
be crucified that thereby his death might be more odious. Marlorate. fol. 715.

GOOD.
What Good or Goodness is.
Goodness is that, as Philosophers say, which all things desire. And more
larglie or plainly to declare the nature thereof: Good things are all such,
which in respect of us are either profitable, commodious, or pleasant to our
uses. All things (says Paul) are yours, whether it be life or death, or Paul
or Cephas, and we are Christ's, and Christ is Gods. Again, To them that love
God, all things work to good.

How there is none good but God.
There is no man good but one, Mar. 10. 1^
which is God. If there be any goodness in us, that have we of God, but God
only is good of himself. Sir. I. Cheek.

Why call thou me good, etc. Because commonly they abused this word, Jesus
shows him that he could not confess him to be good, God is good.
except also he acknowledged that he was God. Geneua.

Of good and evil doings.
And they that have done good, John. 5. 29
unto resurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the
resurrection of damnation. As if he should say, Good and evil.
that they that through faith have done good works, or by their good works
have declared their faith, shall rise again unto life everlasting. But they
that have brought forth the fruits of infidelity, or have not declared the
faith which they fained themselves to have by good works shall rise again unto
damnation. The good works then do not save nor justify, but are signs and
tokens that a man is justified. Sir. I. Cheek.

What a good age is.
There is often mention made in the holy Scripture of a good age. Good age
And in the 15. chapter of Genesis it is promised unto Abraham, as a certain
excellent good thing. And it seems to show two things. First a just place of
life, so that death should not come untimely, and strike as it were in tender
age.

Father (...) end. Wherefore it is requ^^ed thereunto that the (...) be sound,
the body not broken with diseases, no want of riches, the family, country
and dignity abiding firm. This is judged a good age. P^t. Mar. upon Iudi^.
fol. 55.

How the good life of christian man smells in Gods nose.
The good life of a christian man, Good life
is (...) to Gods mouth, and spice to Gods nose: The odor of a sweet fiel^,
which is commended in Genesis 27. 27. The odor of incense in Numery. 28.

The odor of fragrant waters in Job. The odor of that Oil which ran down
Aarons beard, of that Oil that Mary shed upon Christ's head. The odor of spices
and Uine flowers commended in the Canticles, the sweet Balm of
Ecclesiasticus, and the smell of Libanus that Ose speaks of, the smell of
Noah's sacrifice, the smell of best burnt sacrifice, is not the like smell to
Gods nose, (...)
as the smell of a good life, rising from a good belief, for that is, Hostia
Deo in odorem suanitatis. A Sacrifice unto God, a sweet savor, whole Grocers
shops of spicerie, all the flowers in Priapus garden, all the flowers in
Naiades, and Traiades, and Satyrus: that is, all the flowers in Hills and Dales,
and flowers in many a great Forest, are not so delightful and smelling. The
Uiolet has not the like savor, the Rose has not the like savor, the Lilie
the like smell, the Giliflower the like sent, as good life through good faith
yields to Gods nostrells, etc. T. Drant.

Of the good purpose of man.
Look. Man.

GOOD INTENT.
How our good intents must agree with Gods word.
NOthing can be done to the honor of God, nor with a good intent, but that
which is done according to his word. For the word of God is the very true and
only rule of all good intents, and of the honor wherewith he ought to be
honored. For it is not sufficient for man to honor God according to his own
fancy, and to do whatsoever likes himself. For God has given a contrary
commandment, saying: Do not every one of you what shall please you, but that
only which I command you. Pet. Viret.

The Lord was wroth with Oza and smote him, because he put his hand to the
Arc, ^. Pa. 13. 10
etc. Oza punished, because he took upon him an office, whereunto he was not
called, for it was the Priests office. Nu. 4. 15. So that all good intents be
condemned, except they be commanded by the word of God.

Leo the first of that name in his sermon of the Passion of of the Lord, says,
that Peter when he cut off the ear of the servant of the high Priest, was
moved with a godly motion, but what godly motion could it be, which Christ
reproved, yea, and so reproved it, that he affirmed, y^ he which so drew the
sword, should perish with ye sword. What other thing was this then to have a
zeal of God, but(as Paul says) not according to knowledge. Paul also the
Apostle, when he afflicted and destroyed the Christians, thought that he did
God high service. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 152.

Of the good intent of Nadab and Abihu.
The good intent of Nadab and Abihu the sons of Aaron, Leuit. ^0. 1
do show us the fruits of man's good intent without Gods word. As we may do
nothing less, so does that ensample teach, that we may do no more then is
commanded. T. M.

Examles of good intents, out of holy Scripture.
The man that gathered sticks on the Sabbath day, thought he had done well,
and yet was stoned to death for his so doing. Nu. 15. 32.

Look. Man.

God by Samuel, and therefore was reproved. 1. Reg. 15. 8. etc.

James James.
and John desiring (of good intent) that fire might come down from heaven, and
consume the Samaritanes, were rebuked of Christ. Luke. 9. 54.

Peter Peter.
of good intent would have dissuaded Christ from his suffering, and was called
Satan for his labor. Mar. 8. 32.

Judas Judas.
of a good intent, spoke to have the ointment sold, and the money given to the
poor.

The Jews Jews.
of a good intent put Christ and Stephen to death. Math. 27. Act. 7.

GOODS.
How and where they ought to be most safely laid up.
A Man's goods are no where more safely laid up, then in the hands of his
friends. As Alexander being asked the question, in what place he had his
treasure lieng, in the hands of my friends (quod he) meaning that a man's
goods, are no where more safely then so laid up in store. For when the case
requires, goods so bestowed, come again to our hands with increase.

How the goods of the Church, ought to be bestowed.
S. Hierom Hierome.
saith^ so many as with the goods of the Church, satisfy their own pleasure,
are like to the Pharisees, which gave money to the keepers of Christ's sepulcher
to oppress the glory of God. Hierom. in Math. cap. 28.

Urban Bishop of Rome says: The goods of the Church, ought not to be turned
to any other uses, then to Ecclesiastical uses, and the comm^dities of the
poor, for they are (says he) the oblations of the faithful, and the
patrimony of the poor, given unto the Lord for this purpose. If any man
therefore (which God forbid) bestows them otherwise, let him take heed he
fall not into the damnation of Ananias and Saphira, and be proved guilty of
Sacrilege. Forasmuch as not only Tenths are not ours, but are appointed for
y^ relief of y^ congregation, but also whatsoever we receive more of God, then
we have need off, that altogether ought to be bestowed on the poor. If we
receive that for our own lusts and vanities, which is appointed for the poor:
look how many people die, either for hunger or want of clothes, in all those
places where we dwell, let us be well assured that at the day of judgment, we
shall vender accounts for the lives of them all. Caesarius in admonitione.

S. Gregory Gregory.
appoints that the Church-goods, should be divided into four parts. One to
the Bishop and his family, for the maintenance of hospitality, and relief
of the poor. The second to the Clergy, that is to say, to the Ministers,
Deacons, and Scholars. The third to the poor. The fourth to the repairing of
the Temple. S. Gregory. 12. q. 2. can. quatuor.

GOSPEL.
What the Gospel signifies.
THe Gospel signifies a message of God, happy and ioifull news, and shows
to us the grace, by the which we are discharged and set free before the
judgment of God, and delivered from the death and eternal damnation, to the
which we are justly condemned by the Law. And it declares unto us by, and by
what means, whereby, and by whom we obtain that grace, and of whom. Pet. Viret.

As touching the interpretation of this word, Gospel, it being taken from the
Greek word, signifies, good or glad tidings. The which word the threescore
and ten Interpreters, used so often as they found the Hebrew word Bisser, which
signifies to tell, and Besora Tidings, being the deriuatiue of the same, and
also Mevasser, Telling. Mar^orate.

This word (Gospel) signifies good tidings, Math. 1.
and is taken here, for the Story which contains the ioifull message of the
coming of the Son of God, promised from the beginning. Geneua.

The Gospel, after S. John Euangelion, signifies good tidings. And in the
holy writers it signifies a public, solemn and open preaching of Christ
whereby his death has purged our sins, and being risen from the dead,
raineth in the ha^ts of his chosen, and renueth them unto godliness, through his
spirit, mortifieng from time to time their foolish lusts, and abolishing more
and more the remnaunt of their natural corruption, and this indeed is very
good tidings, for hereby we are delivered from the fear^ of death and
damnation, and from the bondage of sin and Satan. Briefly hereby we are
removed from darkness to light, from despair to good hope, from death to
life, from Hell to Heaven. Now because the office of proclaiming and publishing
this most ioifull tidings was committed to the Ministers of the new Testament,
the name of the Evangelists is most properly attributed unto them, and
specially to those, that the Nativity, conversation, death, resurrection of
the Lord Jesus, wherein the blesfulnesse rests, that we see so much advanced.
Some writers affirm, that as many promises of felicity and salvation as
there is, so many Gospells there be, and that therefore the Prophets are
Evangelists. When they speak of the redemption that Gods anointed should
accomplish. I think it not good to strive about words, and I deny not that
the Hebrewe word Bassac, which signifies the Euangelize, and to preach good
tidings, is applied in some place to y^ men of y^ old time, howbeit, I believe
rather, that Euangelion is an open publishing of salvation alredie performed
and accomplished, then of the same promised. And therefore they speak more
distinctlie and properly, that give the name of Evangelists to the Apostles,
and writers of the histories of the Lord Jesus, and finally to the ministers
of the new Testament And to give place rather to this judgment, the words of
our Savior in the. 16. of Luke, moves me, where he says. That the Law and
the Prophets were until John Baptist, and from that time the kingdom of God
was Euangelized. Trah.

What is meant by the Gospel preached to the dead.
For unto this purpose verily was the Gospel preached unto the dead: 1. Pet.
4. 6.
that they should be judged like other men in the flesh, but shall live before
God in the spirit. As certain learned expositours will, To the Dead.
that he here calls preaching of the Gospel unto the dead, in the chapter
going next before, The preaching to the spirits that were in prison, which
thing (say they) signify as much as unto the dead also, or spirits in prison,
came that salve of medicine of the Gospel, and of the glad tidings of Christ's
passion, whereby they were loosed, the strength thereof being so pithie that
they were therewith brought out of prison, to immortality. And because it might
have been demanded, how y^ souls of these blessed came out of prison, whether
compassed with their bodies, or only in pure substance of y^ spirit? Therefore
says Peter, that they should be judged like other men in the flesh, that is,
when all other men shall be judged in the flesh, but should live before God in
the spirit, which signifies that in the mean season til that judgment come,
shall their soul live and re^oice before God through Christ. T. M.

Although the wicked think this Gospel new, and vex you y^ embrace it, yet
has it been preached to them in time paste, which now are dead, to the
intent that they might have been condemned or dead to sin in the flesh, and
also might have lived in the spirit, which two are the effect of the Gospel.
Geneua.

How Christ's Gospel is likened to a Bow.
And he that satte upon him had a bow. Apoc. 6. 2.
The bow is Christ's Gospel, the preaching whereof is disposed at his pleasure,
therefore like as the enemies be overthrown by the arrows which the Bow
shoots out a far off, even so the nations that were far off, are subdued
unto Christ by the preaching of the Gospel. Ephe. 2. 13. This did Christ
promise to his Disciples, saying: I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which
all they that shall be against you, shall not be able to gain say, or gain
stand. Luke. 21. 15. And Paul following the Prophet, says, I will destroy
the wisdom of the wise, and shake off the understanding of the skillful.
Esaie. 29. 14. 1. Cor. 1. 19. Also the weapons of our war are not fleshly,
but mighty to Godwarde, etc. 2. Cor. 10. 4. Whereto pertain those things
which are written in the Psalm. 45. 5. 1. Cor. 14. 24. And Heb. 4. 12. Marl.
upon the Apoc. fo. 90.

Why the Gospel is said to be^ everlasting.
Having the everlasting Gospel. An honorable Title of the Gospel, and it is
called everlasting, first because it brings and beheighteth good things,
according to this Text: He that believes in me has everlasting Iyfe. John.
6. 47. And this is the promise which he has assured us off, even everlasting
life. 1. John. 2. 25. Second because that according to Paul's saying: There
is none other Gospel to be looked for, no not even at an Angel from heaven.
Gal. 1. 8. Thirdlye, because it was promised long ago by the Prophettes, in
the holy Scriptures. Romans 1. 2. Like as where it was said, The woman's seed
shall break thy head. Genesis 3. 15. And also in thy seed, shall all Nations of
the earth be blessed. Genesis 22. 18. Lastly, the Gospel is termed
everlasting, because it shall endure for ever, ma^gre all the ungodly, for
Christ's reign is such, as shall have no end. Luke. 1. 33. 1. Cor. 15. 27.
For it consists in spirit and truth, and not in outward things, according as
it is said: all the gloriousness of the kings daughter is from within. Psalm.
45. 13. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 207.

How the Gospel is no less to be reverenced then the body of Christ.
I ask this question of you brethren and sisters, says Saint Austen,
answer me whether you think greater the word of God or the body of
Christ, if you will answer the truth, verily you ought to say thus, that
the word of GOD is no less then the body of Chrst. And therefore with what
carfulness we take heed when the body of Christ is ministered unto us, that
no part fall thereof out of our own hands on the earth: with as great
carfulness, let us take heed that the word of God which is ministered unto
us, when we think or speak of vain matters, perish not out of our hearts,
for he that hears the word of God negligentlie, shall be guilty of no
less fault, then he that suffers the body of Chrst, to fall upon the
ground through his negligence. Cranmer. fol. 170.

Whether the book or leaves of the book, be the Gospel.
By the authority of Saint Hierome, the Gospel is not the Gospel, for
reading of the letter, but for the belief that men have in the word of GOD.
That it is the Gospel that we believe, and not the letter that we read. For
because the letter that is touched with man's hand, is not the Gospel, but the
sentence that is verily believed in man's heart, is the Gospel. For so Saint
Hierome says. The Gospel that is the virtue of Gods word, is not in the
leaves of the books, but it is in the root of reason. Neither the Gospel (he
says) is in the writing above of the letters, but the Gospel is in the
marking of the sentence of Scriptures. This sentence approves Saint Paul,
saying thus: The kingdom of God is not in word, but in virtue, and David
says: The voice of the Lord, that is, his word, is in virtue. And after
David says: Through the word of God, the heavens were made. And in the spirit
of his mouth, is all the virtue of them. In the book of Mar. fol. 644.

An exposition of this place following.
For I am not ashamed of the Gospel. The Gospel is that heavenly message
which declares unto us, y^ Jesus Christ is the power of God in whom and by
whom, Not ashamed.
God does set forth unto the world all his heavenly treasures, that whosoever
does believe in him, whether he be a Roman or a Jew, Greek, or other, he
should not perish, but have life everlasting. Sir I. Cheek.

Saint Bede Bid.
affirms that in his time and almost a thousand years after Christ, here in
Britain, Easter was kept after the manner of the East church in the full
moon: what day in the week so ever it fell on, and not on the Sundaie as we
do now, whereby it is to be collected, that the first preachers in this land,
have come out from the East part of y^ world, where it was so used rather then
from Rome.

Petrus Cluniacensis Cluniake
writing to Barnard, affirms that the Scotts in his time did celebrate their
Easter, not after the Roman manner, but after the Greeks. And as the said
Britains were not under the Romans in the time of this Abbot of Cluniake: So
neither were they, nor would be under the Roman Legate in the time of
Gregory: nor would admit any primacie of the Bishop of Rome to be above them.

Ghildas says, that Joseph Joseph
of Aramathia that took down Christ from the cross, being sent hither by
Philip the Apostle out of France, he began to preach the Gospel first in
this Realm, in the time of Tiberius the Emperor.

Nicephorus says, that Simon Zelottes Simo^ Z^.
about the same time came into this land, and did the like.

Theodoretus says, that Saint Paul Paul.
immediately after his first delivery in Rome under the Emperor Nero, preched
the Gospel in this Island, and in other Countries of the West.

Tertulian says of his time, that the countries of Britai^e, which the
Romans could never attain unto, are now subi^ct to Christ. Origin says the
same.

GOAT.
How this Goat does figure Christ.
PUtting them upon the head of the Goat. Leuit. 16. 21.
Here this Goat is a true sign of Jesus Christ, who bears the sins of the
people. Esaias. 53. 5. Geneua.

Why it is called the escape Goat.
And the other for a escape Goat. Leuit 16. ^
In the Hebrew it is called Azazel, which some say is a mountain near Sinai,
whether this Goat was sent, but rather is called escape Goat, because it was
not offered, but sent into the desert, as verse. 21. Geneua.

GRACE.
What Grace is.
BY grace understand the favor of God, and also the gift of working of the
spirit in us, as love, kindness, patience, obedience, mercifulness, despising
of worldly things, peace, concord, and such like. Tindale.

The true definition of grace.
The true definition of Grace, and agreeing to the holy scriptures is, the free
benevolence of God, whereby he counts us dear in Christ Jesus, and forgiueth
us our sins, gives the holy Ghost, an upright life, and eternal felicity:
by this definition is seen, not only what we call grace, but also by whom we
have it, and with all the principal effects thereof. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans
fol. 140.

Received grace of all Apostleship. Romans 1. 5.
Grace is throughout all the Epistles of Paul, taken for the favor and free
mercy of God, whereby he saves us freely without any deserts or works of
the law. In like manner peace is taken for the tranquillity of the conscience,
being fully persuaded, that through the merits of Christ's death and
bloud-shedding, there is an atonement and peace made between God and us, so
that God will no more impute our sins unto us, nor yet condemn us. Sir. I.
Cheek.

What it is to reject grace.
To reject and refuse the grace of God, Grace reject.
is to seek righteousness by the law, or to deserve grace by our own
righteousness.

What difference is between grace and gift.
Grace properly is Gods favor, benevolence, or kind mind, which of his own
self without deserving of us, he bears unto us, whereby he was moved and
inclined to give Christ unto us, Grace and Gift.
with all his other gifts of grace. Gift, is the holy Ghost and his working,
whom he powers into the hearts of the^, on whom he has mercy, and whom he
favors. Though the gifts of y^ spirit increase in us daily, and have not
yet the full perfection, yea, and though there remain in us yet evil lusts
and sin, which fight against the spirit, as he says here in the seventh
Chapter, and in the fifth to the Galathians, and as it was spoken before, in the
third Chapter of Genesis, of the debate between the woman's seed, and the
seed of the Serpent, yet nevertheless GODS favor is so great and so strong
over us for Christ's sake, that we are counted for full, whole, and perfect
before God. For Gods favor toward us, divides not her self, increasing a
little and little as do the gifts, but receives us whole and altogether in
full love for Christ's sake our intercessour and Mediator. And because the
gifts of the spirit, and the battle between the spirit and evil lusts
are begun in us already. Of this now understand thou the. 7. Chapter,
where Paul accuses himself as a sinner, and yet in the 8. Chapter says,
There is no dampnation to them that are in Christ, and that because of the
spirit, and because the gifts of the spirit are begun. Sinners we are
because the flesh is not full killed and mortified. Nevertheless in as much as
we believe in Christ, and have the earnest and beginning of the spirit, and
would feign be perfect. GOD is so loving and favorable unto us, that he will
not look on such sin, neither will count it as sin, but will deal with us
according to our belief in Christ, and according to his promises which he
has sworn to us, until the sin be full slain in us, and mortified by
death. Tindale in his Prol. to the Romans

The difference between grace and the Law.
Chrysostom notes certain diefferences, between the Law and Grace. The
Law (says he) sets ^oorth a Crown, but first requires works and
battles. Grace first crowns, Grace and law.
and afterward brings unto the battle.

By this he teaches that the righteousness which is set forth the Law, is
obtained by works, for we cannot be justified by the law, unless we have
accomplished, all the things which are commanded in the law. But that other
righteousness which we have by grace through faith, does first crown us with
a new generation and adoption to be the children of GOD: And we being
regenerate, it brings us forth to battle, and unto good works. Hereunto
Chrysostom adds, the law reproves, but loses not from sin. Grace loses
from sin, and reproves not. The law reproves sin, and increases it:
Grace forgiving it, suffers us not to be under sin, etc. Pet. Mar. upon the
Romans fol. 134.

How this following is understood.
And of his fullness have all we received even Grace for Grace. John. 1. 16
This sentence is sundry wise expounded. I will first show you Saint Austens
mind. These be his words upon this place: That brethren all we have received
out of his fullness, out of the fullness of his mercy have we received, what?
Remission of sins, that we might be justified by faith.

And what moreover? Grace for Grace, Grace for Grace.
that is to wit: For this Grace whereby we live of Faith, we shall receive an
other Grace, namely, Everlasting life. But what else is it save Grace? For if
I shall say this is due to me, I assign somewhat to my self, as to whom it
is due. But GOD crowns the gifts of his mercy in us. Thus ye see Saint
Austens meaning, to wit, that all good gifts, and in the end, everlasting
life is not a recompense of our merits, but comes of the free liberality of
God, because it pleases him so to reward his former graces, and to crown his
own gifts in us. And so he calls faith whereby we are justified one
Grace, and euerla^ing life an other grace, very truly and godly to the
confusion of the common Idolles Soldiers. Other expounding Grace for Grace,
Grace upon Grace, teach that out of this fullness of his son, GOD gave to
our Fathers under the old Testament the spirit of fear, whereby as children
under a Schoolmaster they were kept in and restrained, that they should not
stray abroad after fleshly lusts, but be led forth and framed to some
goodness. And in the new Testament, he gives the spirit of freedom, whereby
with more frank and free hearts, and with more ioifull courage by the motion
of the spirit, we do the thing that pleases God, not that our Fathers were
altogether void of this free spirit, but because of their childlie age, they
were kept more under by fear, and the spirit was not so richly and larglie
given to them as to us, I mean universally, touching gods ordinary
disposition. For to some special person the spirit was larglie given, and more
larglie then it is now. The exposition of other is, that God loves and
favors us, because of the love and favor that he bears to his son, as
Saint Paul writes, That he has made us acceptable in the beloved. For by
nature we are the children of wrath, and the love and favor that we find in
Gods sight, is for that of his own goodness he has made us the members of his
most dearelye beloved son, and so loves us, as a part of his sons body.
Other think that the meaning of these words is, that GOD powers all his
graces into the Lord Jesus, and by him conueieth the same unto us, as by a
Conduct pipe^ I leave to your choice, which of these expositions ye will take.
B. Traheron.

By grace understand favor. The meaning is, for the favor that God the Father
has to his son Christ, has he received us into favor. So as Christ is
beloved of his Father, even so are we beloved for his sake. Romans 5. 15. T. M.

All grace, All grace
and all that is pleasant in the sight of God, is given us for Christ's sake
only, even out of the fullness and abundance of the favor that he receives
with the father. Tindale.

Grace for grace. That is, God does favor us and give grace to so many as
believe in Christ, and are become his members. The Bible note.

What is understood by grace and peace.
Grace to you and peace from God. Romans 1. 17 Grace and peace.
By grace here is understood the favor of GOD wherewith he freely forgiueth
sinnes^ By peace the tranquillity of conscience pr^ceeding thereof. Tindale.

How these words (Grace and Truth) are expounded.
But grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. John. 1. 17
By grace some understand that, Grace and truth.
that makes us amiable and acceptable, and gets us favor before God and
man. By truth they understand, true, sincere, perfect, sound, and sure
righteousness. Other by grace in this place understand forgiveness of sins,
and by truth, the fulfilling of all the figures and shadows in Moses law, in
which signification you shall take the words, the since shall be good and
godly. B. Traheron.

The grace (says Saint Austen) which is given of the largnesse of God privily
into man's heart, cannot be despised of no manner of hard heart, for therefore it
is given, that the hardness of the heart shall be taken away. Wherefore when
the father is herd within, and does learn that he must come unto his son,
then takes he away our stony heart, and gives us a fleshly heart, and by
this means he makes us his children of promise, and the vessels of mercy,
which he has prepared to glory. But wherefore does he not learn all men to
come to Christ: because that those y^ he learneth, he learneth of mercy, and
those that he learneth not, of his judgment does he not learn them.

These places following are alleged of D. Barnes against Free will.
Saint Austen says, Austen against Dunce.
that there is no hardness of heart, that can resist grace. Dunce says, that
there may be an obstacie in man's heart.

S. Austen says, that grace finds the heart in hardness and obstinacy. But
Dunce says, that there is a mollifieng that precedeth grace, which is called
attrition.

Saint Austen says, when the Father learneth us within, then takes he away
our stony hearts. But Dunce says, that we can do it by the common natural
influence, that is, we can dispose our selves of congruence.

Saint Austen says, how all men be not taught to come to Christ, but only
they that be taught of mercy be taught, and if it be of mercy, then it is not
of congruence by attrition.

The meaning of these places following.
For by grace are ye saved through faith. Ephe. 2. 8.
So then grace, that is to say, the gift of God and Faith, do stand one with
an other, to which two these be contrary, to be saved by our selves or by our
works. Therefore what mean they, which would join together things of so
contrary nature. Beza.

And grace for grace. John. 1. 16
This place is diversely expounded. Some understand the first grace to be that,
by y^ which through faith we receive remission of our sins, the other grace
to be life everlasting, the which kind of Grace is given to the faithful,
according to the saying of the Apostle: but the grace of God is eternal life.
Grace for Grace.
Romans 6. 23. But other some will have the first to be that, which in the old
Testament was given to the Jews: The other to be more copious and large, and
given to all men. But the simple sense and meaning of the text seems to be
this, that whatsoe^er graces God does pour upon us, they do also spring from
this Well. For whatsoever we do receive of Christ, he does not only give it
unto us as GOD, but also the Father has so given all things into the hands of
Christ, that whatsoever we receive from GOD, they come to us by Christ, as by a
conduct Pipe. They judge therefore rightly, which say that we are watered by
the graces powered upon Christ. This was the anointing with the which he was
anointed, and that he might anoint us all with him, whereupon he is called
Christ, that is to say, anointed, and we Christians, that is to say, anointed
by him, etc. Marl. upon John. fol. 24.

Look on the next Leaf before.

GRAFFING.
How we are graffed in Christ, and also cut off.
THere be three kinds of graffing Three graffings.
in, and two manners of cutting off. First, the children of the faithful, unto
whom by the virtue of the covenant that is made with the Fathers, the promise
does perteine, are graffed in. Secondlye, they are graffed in, that receive the
seed of the Gospel, but before it can bring forth any fruit, it is choked in
them. Thirdly, they be graffed in, that by the unchangeable purpose or decree
of God, are ordained and chosen to life everlasting. Now, the first are cut
off, when they do vnfaithfullie refuse the promise that is made unto their
Fathers, or else will not of a certain malicious mind receive it. The second
are cut off, when the seed is choked in them. I. Veron.

GRIEF.
What grief is, and how it is defined.
Grief as says Cicero in his Tusculane questions, is a disease which vexes
the mind, and it is taken by reason of the evil which seems to be already
at hand, and to be present. For y^ disease which is taken for an evil, which
is come, is not called grief but fear. If a man demand from whence this
grief springs, I answer, from love. For when it goes evil with them, to
whom we would good, we begin to be grieved. But if unto them whom we care not
for, or who are not dear unto us, there happen any misfortune, that is not
customablye grieuesome unto us. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 237.

GREEKS.
Of whom the Greeks came.
OF Iauan the son of Iaphet sprang the Greeks, which is a part of Europe.
Lanquet.

Why the Title was written in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew.
In Greek letters, Luke 23. 38
and in Latin and Hebrew. That the thing might be known to all nations,
because these three languages were most common. Geneua.

The meaning of these places following.
There arose a murmuring of the Grecians toward the Hebrews. Act. 6. 1.
Whose ancestors were Jews, and dwelled in Grecia. Therefore these spoke
Greek and not Hebrew. Geneua.

And disputed with the Greeks. Which were Jews, but so called because they
were dispersed through Grecia and other countries. Geneua.

Spoke unto the Grecians. Act. 9. 29.
He means not the Jews, which being scattered abroad in diverse countries
were called by this name, but the Grecians which were Gentiles Geneua.

I am debtor both to the Greeks and Barbarous. Rom 1. 14.
All those that were not Jews by a common word, were called heathen. And here
they are divided into Greeks and barbarous. By Greeks he understands those
that were learned, ^iuill, and of good bringing up By Barbarous, he means the
rude and savage people, with whom no man could well have to do. The Bible note.

Of the Jew first, Rom ^. 9.
and also of the Grecian. By the Grecian he understands the Gentile, and
every one that is not^ a Jew. Geneua.

GREAT.
An exposition of this place following.
Whosoever will be great among you. Math. 20 ^6.
He says not, no man ought to be chief among you, which he should have said,
If it had not been lawful in the kingdom of God, for some to be great and
chief, or if it had been necessary that all should have been in all things
equal. The celestial spirits be not equal: The Stars be not equal: The
Apostles themselves be not equal: Peter is found in many places, to be the
chief among the rest, which we do not deny. Therefore this is not the
meaning of Christ, to have none great or chief among Christians, seeing the
very necessity of our state requires, that some be superiors and betters,
so far it is from being repugnant to charity. In like manner there must be
in the Church Governors, Presidents, Rulers, of whom Paul makes mention.
Romans 13. l. Cor. 12. 28. Heb. 13. 17. And there is also in the body some
principal members, some inferior, etc. Therefore Christ does not require that
in his kingdom all should be equal, but this he does require. That none
should desire to be great, or to be thought or counted chief. Mus^.

The Anabaptists (says Bucer) think here that they are able to prove, that
it pertains not to a Christian to bear rule, and that no man can be together
a Magistrate and a Christian, because Christ said here to his disciples, Vos
aute^ non si^, not considering that those which godly and according to the will
of the Lord bear rule, Nihil minus, etc. Do nothing less then bear rule
indeed, yea verily, do most of all serve: Surely Christ would have his
Apostles to have their authority in Churches, and they themselves did greatly
require to be obeyed: but because in that they sought nothing unto themselves,
but only salvation and the glory of God in those whom they ruled, they did
govern the Churches. They had every where the superiority, they ruled such
as believed: they would have y^ godly to be obedient unto them: Interim
nihilominus seruierunt omnibus, etc. And yet in the mean time served all, and
had dominion over all. So also in the civil government, who was ever in
greater dignity then Moses, or more to be feared for authority and power?
And yet who ever served mo, more diligently and more humbly, which never
sought any thing for himself, etc. but day and night, to the uttermost of his
power, ^ought for the safety of the people, etc. If any now so bear office,
and rule the works of the hands of the Lord, and govern the Sheep of his
pasture according to his will, what does he else but serve all those whom he
governs.

And therefore Christ does not here dehort from bearing rule and being a
Magistrate, but from ^eeking rule and dominion, For I had rather take this
saying of the Lord in this generality, then to restrain it to the Apostles
only: Eo quod omninus pius, etc. Because a godly Magistrate does altogether
serve and not bear rule, and has by himself all things agreeable to this
present exhortation of the Lord. Bucer.

GROVE.
The meaning of these place^ following.
THe grove also remained still in Sa^^a^^a. Wherein they did commit their
Idolatry, 4. Re. 13. 6
and which the Lord had commanded to be destroyed. Deuteronomy. 16. 21. Geneua.

He brought the Grove from the Temple of the Lord. 4. Re. 23. 6
He removed the Grove, which Idolaters for devotion had planted near unto the
Temple, contrary to the commandment of the Lord. Deuteronomy. 16. 21. Or as some
read, the similitude of the Grove which was hanged in the Temple. Geneua.

They worshipped Trees and Groves. Iudic. 3.
This word Aschrea with the Hebrews is a Tree, and being in the plural
number Ascheroth, as it is in this place it signifies Trees, an^ of some it is
translated Groves. For it is a most common manner among the Idolaters to
worship their Gods in Groves. In Oken Groves they sacrificed to Jupiter. And
the Oak of D^dome was in the old time most famous, by reason of the aunsweres
which it gave. In woods of Baye^^es was Appollo worshipped. Dap^^e also is
notable where the Temple of Appollo was (...) was won^ to have a temple among
Olive trees. And lastly, we may mark both in Poets, and also in histories, y^
shadowie woods, most large rivers and mountains of exceeding great height,
were counted in the men of the old time, places most apt for Sacrifices to be
done unto Idols, because such places drewe^ unto men no small admiration.
Wherefore they thought that such notable places had the power of God present.
Yea and Abraham also, Isaac, and Jacob, and the old Fathers offered
Sacrifices, unto the true God, upon the high mountains, which custom was
till such time used, as God by a law ordained that they should not do
sacrifice every where, but in that place only which he himself had chosen.
Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 77.

GVILE.
The definition of Guile.
^Eruetus an interpreter of the Law, has thus defined evil guile, namely,
to be a subtle invention or device for to deceive an other by, when as one
thing is done, and an other thing dissembled. Wheresoever therefore is guile,
there is deceit by some dissimulation, etc.

Of good and evil Gule.
Some guile is good, and other some is evil: We call that good, which is not
hurtful: and when as it hurts none, but sometimes profits: but evil guile
is hurtful, and ever hurts some body, etc. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic.

Halcion.
What Halcion is.
HAlcion was the daughter of Neptunus and wife to Cey^, whom she beholding to
be drowned, for sorrow prowned her self. Wherefore the Poets write, that they
were both translated into birds, and called Hal^io^es. Elio^o.

What the Halcions (...) be.
Halcion is a kings fishe^. It is said, that in the most sharp and coldest
time of the year, these Halcions making their n^ast ^ in the sea rocks or
sand, will (...) their Eggs and hatch forth their Chickens^ And therefore the
same sea that ha^bou^eth these ^oules thus sitting upon their Eggs, will be so
calm and still to her guests for (...) days, y^ men may surely sail without
peril upon her, not shaken or moiested with any storm or tempest, nor yet
the neasts of these birds so nigh the water, not once shaken, nor hurt with
any sou^ges. (...)
For the sea will not for y^ time of these birds ^^tting and hatching, disease
her guests. And therefore is this tranquillity of the sea for that little time,
as a t^ewes taking in the Winter, called the Halcions days. Melancthon upon
Dan^

HAND.
What the hand of God signifies.
CHrist is called the hand of God, for he is both his arm and his hand.
Moreover, Gods hand is taken sometime for his power. Iere. 18. 6. Behold the
house of Israel, ye are in my hand, even as the claie in the Potters. Sometime
for his scourge. Soph. 1. 4. I will stretch out my hand over Judah and
Jerusalem, and I will root out the remnaunt of Siria. Of the which scourge.
Job. 19. 21. says: The hand of the Lord has touched me. Augustine.

Of the band that Balthas^r saw.
The king himself alone saw the hand^ w^iting^ and not his guests, Dan. 5. 5.
as did Balaams^ Ass see the Angel, which Balaam saw not. The hand came
glittering forth against^ the light and Candlestick. Rabbie Saadias says,
That it was the hand of Gabriel. But it was the hand of God and man to ^ee,
even of Christ: which is the mighty Angel of Gods counsel, and hand of the
Father, etc. Melancthon upon Dan.

What is meant by this place following.
Put thy hand under my thigh. Genesis 24. 2.
To put the hand under the ^high, was an oath which the^ Hebrews used in such
things as perteined to the Testament and promise of God. As in G^n^ 47. 29.

Which ceremony declared the servant obedience toward his master, and the
masters power over the servant. Geneua.

Hand writing, what it was.
And has put out the hand writing y^ was against us contained in the law
written. Col. 2. 14.
The law is our hand writing, in that the conscience sets to her seal,
subse(...) and ^on^enteth that the law is just and we sinners, which law
concerning dampnation, is taken away through faith in Christ. Tindale.

The Apostle here uses a Metaphor of a writing or of an Obligation made, Col.
2. 14.
where men are bound to ful^^ll the writing or obligation made. This writing is
the law of God, it requires that all men should fulfill the law, no man
fulfilled the law (Christ only excepted) wherefore all men were found by
the law guilty and worthy of death, because they have not fulfilled the law,
that they were bound to keep.

This Law Christ not only for himself, but for all that believe in him to
the worlds end, did fulfill, that it shall not be imputed to them that
believe in Christ, any transgression of the law, and we by him and in him.
Christ is the perfection of the law to all them that believe in him. L. Ridley
upon the ^oll.

HAPPY.
The meaning of this place following.
Happy or blessed are they which have not seen, and yet have believed. Ioh.
20. 29.
These words were spoken in reproach of the hard belief of Didimus, that would
not believe the resurrection of his Master Christ, by the report of them that
saw him risen (notwithstanding he knew that Christ had promised before his
death, that he would rise again the third day) but said he would first see
the fa^^eming of the nails in his hands, and put his finger into the holes,
and his hand into his side or he would believe. But when he had seen and
confessed, saying: My Lord and my God: Then said Christ to him: Because thou
have see^e me Thomas thou have believed, happy or blessed are they which have
not seen, and yet have believed, meaning thereby the Fathers and Prophets of
the old law, which saw him, not with the bodily eyes, and yet believed all
that they writ of him concerning his coming in the flesh, which Thomas wo^ld
not believe till he saw it. This is the meaning of this place, and not to
apply it (as the Papists have done) to the Sacrament, counting them to be
blessed, that believe Christ's body to be there, and see it not. Crowley.

HARDEN.
How God is said to harden.
GOd is said to harden, when he calls, Exo. 4. 21.
and he resists, making himself unworthy of the kingdom of heaven, he does
then permit him unto himself: that is, he leaves man unto his own corrupt
nature, according unto the which, the heart of man is stony, which is only
mollified and made tractable by the only grace of God: therefore the
withdrawing of Gods grace, is the hardening of man's heart, and when we are left
to our selves, then are we hardened. Bullinger. fol. 490.

God is said to harden man's heart, when he does justly punish his obstinacy
and wickedness by withdrawing his spirit and grace. The Bible note.

Harden his heart. By returning my spirit, and deliu^ring him to Satan, to
increase his (...). Geneua.

HEART.
Where the heart of man is placed.
THe heart of man is placed on the left side, and all other beasts in the
middle of the ^reast.

The opinion of all natural Philosophers is, that the first that is formed in
man is the heart, and the last member that dies in man.

How some men's hearts be hairie.
Pliny says that some man's heart is hairie, Heart hairie.
which betokens hardy, courageous and active: as it was pro^ed by one
Aristodamus, which fought against the Lacedaemonians, and slew three hun^red
with his own hands, and he being dead and opened, his heart was found hairie.

How the heart of man that is poisoned, will not burn.
Sweton and Pliny says both, that if a man die of poison, the heart of that
man can not be burned, Heart no^ burn.
though it be cast into the fire: which was proved of Germanicus, father to
Caligula.

Of the heart and womb of God.
The heart of God Heart of God.
the Father, signifies the secret of his wisdom, of which he begat his word,
that is his Son without beginning, without any passion. Psalm. 45. 1. My
heart is inditing of a good matter. His womb is used in the same
signification. Psalm. 110. 4. Of my womde before the morning star I begat
thee. Augustine.

HEART OR STAGGE.
A^ the H^rt being poisoned, does covet the wat^r, so we being poisoned with
sin, ought to fly unto Christ for succor.
THose that do write of the nature of beasts do say, that an Heart among
other his peculiar properties, has a great desire above all other beasts to
the waters, and that for three causes: One is for the quenching of his thirst,
and that desire is common to him with all other beasts: he has also a natural
desire to the water when he is hot and chafed with the chasing of dogs, and
that for two causes: One the cold water cools his heat, and refreshes his
strength: Secondly, the water by the means of his readiness and aptness to
swim, does not only set him forward and gives him a vauntage before the
dogs, but also does sometime thereby deceive the Hounds, and sometime defends
him against the ^ray-hounds. So that the Heart being chased and in danger of
his (...), hearesorteth by and by for his^ comfort and defense, Ad (...)
aquarum, unto the water springs, unto the Brooks or Rivers. Our Hunters (I
trow) term it not to call it the water Springs, but they call it the Sound.
The Stagge say they, got him to the Sound, and there the Hounds made a fault,
and had l^st him clearelie, had not one old Hound have been, which ius^^lie
leaped into the water, and on the other side, tried which way he was gone, and
so followed the chase afresh. Beside these two great causes, why the Heart
desires the water, there is yet another, as great as any of the other two,
but not so well known to the most part of men, as the other be. In Affrike and
other hot Countries where many Serpents be, there is a natural enmity
between the Heart and them, and as soon as the Heart has devoured the
Serpent, the poison of the Serpent does cast the Heart into such a fervent
heat, that it causes him to have a marvelous desire to the water, without
which the Heart must need die. Such a love ought all men have to godliness,
and to run to God for succor, when they be poisoned with the venime of
sin, or oppressed with any kind of trouble: as the Heart has (...) run to
the water Springs, when he is chased with Dogs, or poisoned with Serpents. So
that they may say with the Prophet David, As the Heart desires the water
Springs, so my soul desires thee, O Lord. Ric. Turnar.

HARVEST
What is understood by this word, Harvest.
THe Harvest is great, Mat. 9. (...)
but the laborers are few. The Harvest are the hearts of men prepared to
hear the word, as it appears by the Samaritanes. John. 4. 39. Tindale.

Because the harvest of the earth is ripe. Apoc. 16. 1^.
This Harvest is the very same, that Christ wills to be tarried for, when he
teaches of the s^oling out of the good from the bad. Suffer ye them (says he)
to grow together till Harvest, and when Harvest comes, I will say to the
Harvest folk, First gather together the Darnell, and bind it up in bundells
to be burnt, but gather ye the Wheat together in my Barn. Mat. 13. 30. Marl.
fol. 216.

HATE.
The meaning of this place following.
HE that hates his life in this world, Ioh. 12. 2^.
shall keep it unto life eternal. He that can be content to loose his
temporal life in this world for Christ's sake and his word, shall live for
eue^. As in Ma^h. (...) Tindale.

When a man may hate his neighbor.
WHen thy neighbor has showed thee more unkindness, t^en God has love; then
ma^^ thou hate him and not before, but must love him for Gods sake, till he
fight against God, to (...) the name and glory of God. Tindale. fol. 204.

HAS.
(...) following.
For (...). Math. 13. 1^.
But whosoever has not, etc. That is to (...), He that has a good heart
toward the word of God and a set purpose to fashion his deeds thereafter, and
to garnish it with godly living, and to testify it to other the same shall
increase more and more d^ilie (...) the gra^e of God and Christ. But he that
loves it not to live thereafter, and to edify other, the same shall loose the
grace of true knowledge and be blinded again, and every day worse and worse,
and blinder and blinder, till he be an utter enemy unto the word of God, and
his heart so hardened, that it shall be impossible to convert it. Tindale.

He that has any thing, as he should have it righ^lie, and uses it well as
he should do the same, shall abound and increase more and more in goodness and
godliness: But he that has not, even that he has shall be taken from him,
that is, he that lives not according to the knowledge he has in Gods open
word of his commandments, but knows the Lords will, and does it not, shall
be deprived of that he has, and turned over into blindness and darkness.

They that have a desire of righteousness, and of the truth, shall be more and
more illuminated of God. On the contrary part, they that do not covet after
righteousness and truth, are more hardened and blinded, though they seem unto
themselves to be most wise. Sir. I. Cheek.

HAZ^^^
How he came to his kingdom.
HE took a rough cloth, ^. Re. 8. 15
and dipped it in the wa^er, and ^pred it on his face. Hazael brought this wet
cloth to Benhadad as though he would therewith have (...) him, and eased him of
his (...), ^ut did in deed st^^gle him, after Josephus. He had heard of the
Prophet that Benhadad should (...) have be (...) long or he had reigned,
therefore did he rid (...), to the (...) that he might (...) ^ome by the
kingdom. T. M.

HEBRON.
What Hebron was.
HEbron is a proper (...) of a (...), which (...) called the City of Arbe,
(...). 14. 15.
which Arbe after the Hebrew was a Giant, both strong and mighty, and of a
famous name. T. M.

HEAD.
What is meant by the head of God.
WHen we read that God has a head, we must understand his divine nature, which
was before all things, and to it all things be obedient. Augustine.

What the head of the Serpent signifies.
Shall tread thee on the head. Genesis 3. 15.
The head of the Serpent signifies, the power and tyranny of the Devil,
which Christ the seed of the Woman overcame. The heel is Christ's manhood,
which was tempted with our sins. T. M.

HAIRS OF GOD.
What the hairs of God signify.
HIs hairs signify his Angels, and the whole multitude of his chosen. Dan.
7. 9. His clothing was as white as snow, the hairs of his head like pure
wool. Where the head of God is his Deity and Godhead, his clothes and his
hairs be his Angels and Elect, which be like white snow and pure wool.
Augustine.

HELCHESAITES.
What their opinions were, and who consuted them.
HElchesaites (called of Epiphanius, Heretics Confuted about the year of our
Lord. 247.
Sampsai, the first Author of them was Elxais a false Prophet. They rejected
part of the old Testament. They denied the Apostle. They counted it a thing
indifferent in case of necessity to deny with y^ mouth, so that thou believe
with heart. Origin confuted them. Euse. li. 6. cap. 37.

HELIAS.
Of the strange vision seen at the birth of this Prophet.
HElias the Prophet of Thesbes of the Country of Arabia, a Leuite of the Tribe
of Aaron. He dwelt in Gilead, for Thesbes was an habitation, dedicated unto
Priests. In the time of his birth, his father Sobas did see a vision, that men
apparailed in white did call the child, threw him to the fire, and gave to
him a flame of fire to eat. The Father rising up, went to Jerusalem, and
showed his Uision to the Priests. And he that gave answer said unto him,
beware thou disclose it not. The habitation of this child shall be light, and
his word a demonstration, and shall judge Israel in the sword and fire. This is
that Helias that brought fire thrice from Heaven, and bare rain in his tongue,
and was taken up into Heaven in a fire storm.

That which is written more of him, in the Bible may be there read. Eliote^

HELISE^S.
Of a strange thing that befell at his birth.
HEliseus the Prophet of Abelmath of the Land of Rubim, when he was borne at
Galgalis, the Cow of gold in Selom so lowed, that she was heard at Jerusalem.
And the Priests said, that it signified that a Prophet was borne that day,
which should dissolve and break in pieces, Images carved and cast in metal.
Many meruailes almighty God showed by him, which may be read in the Bible.
Eliote.

HELL.
How Hell is taken in the scripture.
OUt of the belly of Hell I cried. I^^as. 2. 2.
The Scripture speaks of Hell, commonly as of a place common for all them
that go down into the earth, as into a grave, or to the deep of the Sea,
etc. As ye have in Genesis and in the Psalms. T. M.

For he was in the Fishes belly, as in a grave or place of darkness. Geneua.

I thought I should have gone to the gates of Hell, Esa. 38. 10
in my best age. That is, I thought I should have gone down to my grave, and
have died in my best age. The Hebrew word signifies both Hell and a grave, pit
or ditch. That ye may perceive in Genesis 42. 38. where Jacob says, that if any
misfortune should happen to Benjamin in his journey into Egypt with his other
brethren, his graie head should be brought with sorrow unto his Grave, where
the common Translation reads Hell for grave. As for Hezekia he neither feared
Hell nor Purgatory, as ye may well see, by that he a little before says.

Remember O Lord, that I have walked before thee in truth and a steadfast heart,
and have done that thing that is pleasant to thee, which thing who so does,
needs not to fear any of those two places. Beside that the Dunce-men and
Sophisters themselves, which were (as most learned men think) the inuenters
and finders, yea, and the very makers of Purgatory, say that before the time
of Christ, there was no sure place. So that Hezekia is by their sentence
skilled quite from that place. And of Hell does the sentence of the word of God
quite him, which says, There is no damnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
Romans 8. 1. T. M.

The meaning of this place following.
For Hell praises thee not, etc. Esa. 38. 18
The meaning is, if I now die, I cannot praise thee in thy Temple. For the dead
and buried, cannot love and praise, with their material tongues or hearts,
neither can any death nor any burieng, be at this season, for the setting out
of thy glory. For all the godly will be feared with this thy Judgment. And
the wicked will impute my death to the overthrowing of Idolatry, and to the
putting down of the brazen Serpent.

Look, Hezekia.

The meaning of this place of Matthew.
Shall be worthy to be punished with Hell, Mat. 5. 22
etc. Whereas we read here, Hell, it is in the text it self Gehenna, which is
an Hebrew word made of two, and is as much to say as the Uallie of Hynnon,,
which otherwise the Hebrews called Topheth. It was a place, where the
Israelites were wont most cruelly to sacrifice their Children to false Gods,
whereupon it was taken for a place to torment the Reprobates. As Jeremy. 7. 31
Beza.

HELPERS OF FAITH.
How men be helpers of faith.
MEn be helpers of faith, when they suffer not the faith received to be weak,
feeble or inconstant, to be oppressed with desires or affections of the flesh,
or of the world, by the craft or subtlety of false prophets, to be brought
away from it, and led into a false belief, by false doctrine, whom the devil
does us as his ministers, to deceive the simple people unlearned. Also
scripture uses to call men helpers of the faith, when men do diligently
watch that they be not deceived by y^ devil, nor by any of his Ministers,
when they do labor with all force to make their faith sure and strong,
doubting of altering in no part, but by all means studieth every day to
make their faith more stronger and stronger by all manner of good works.
Bibliander upon Jude.

HELINDIVS.
What his heresy was.

HEM.
How we touch the hem of Christ's vesture.
ANd touched the hem of his vesture. Mat. 9. 20
We touch the hem of Christ's vesture, when we believe that he did take our
frail nature upon him, to heal the filthy diseases of our corruptible flesh.
Sir. I. Cheek.

HEMEROBAPTISTS
What manner of Heretics they were.
THe Hemerobaptists were Jews in all points, Heretics
they affirmed that it was impossible for any man to attain unto everlasting
life, unless he were every day purified and baptized. Epiphan. per^a. lib.
1. de here is.

HENOCH.
What his taking up into heaven signifies.
THis is not Henoch the first son of Ca^, Genesis 5. 24.
but Henoch the son of Iared, whose taking up into heaven, does manifest unto
us, the immortality that remains after this life, and that God would judge
the world, who will save those that be righteous, and dampne those that be
wicked. Lanquet.

For God took him away. To show that there was a better life prepared, and
to be a Testimony of the immortality of souls and bodies. As to enquire
where he became, is mere curiosity. Geneua.

HER AND ANAN.
How they were slain, for not using the lawful benefit of marriage.
HEr, Gen 38. 7.
the eldest son of Judah was married to Thamar of Mesopotamia, the daughter of
Aran. Now, Her was a wicked impe, and doubted of Thamar because she was not of
the land of Chanaan, therefore the Angel of the Lord slew him, the third night
after his marriage, when he had not yet companied with her, by reason of his
mothers subtlety, and so he died in his naughtiness, for she was loath that
he should have any child by her. When Anan was mariageable, Thamar was given
unto him, and he also of a spite companied not with her, notwithstanding that,
he lived a full year with her, and when he was threatened of his father Judah,
then he companied with her, but yet by his mothers commandment, he let his
seed fall upon the ground, and so he also died in his wickedness.

This Story is in the book of the 12. Patriarks.

HEAR HIM.
How Christ is to be heard in all things.
THis is my dear son in whom I delight, Mat. 17. 5
hear him.

Since that we are from above by the voice of the heavenly Father bidden to
hear Christ, we ought not (as Saint Cyprian says) to care what the Fathers
have done before us, but much rather what Christ (which was before the Fathers)
did command us to do, that are we most bound to follow and to do. Sir. I.
Cheek.

HERESY.
The definition of Heresy.
AS touching the definition of Heresy, S. Austen says: To express by orderly
definition what thing makes and Heretic, as I judge, is either impossible or
very hard.

The word Heresy, is derived of a Uerbe, which signifies to elect or choose
unto themselves, some certain opinions, which are against the holy Scriptures,
and do stubbornly defend the same. And the causes of this their choice, for the
most part, are either because they are ignorant of the holy Scriptures, or else
if they know them, they despise them, and being driven by some covetousness,
they apply themselves to the invention of some errors, Wherefore Augustine in
his book De vtilitate credendi writes, An Heretic is he, which for the love
of gain or rule, either brings up, or else follows new opinions. The
definition therefore of Heresy, is a choice and stubborn defending of
opinions, which are against the holy Scriptures, either by reason of ignorance
or else contempt of them, to the end the easier to obtain their own pleasures
and commodities.

The choice and stubborn defending is in this definition in steed of the
form, but the opinions disagreeing with the holy Scriptures serve for the
matter. Pride and covetousness make Heresy. And the obtaining of dignities,
gain and pleasures are appointed the ends of this so great a mischief. By
this definition, it is manifest enough (as I think) who be Heretics. Pet.
Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 58.

What things are required for the proof of Heresy.
For just proof of Heresy, three things necessary are required for the
proof of Heresy. First, that it be an error. Second, that it be an error
against the truth of Gods word. Thirdly, that it be stoutly and willingly
maintained. Otherwise, an error in Gods truth without wilful maintenance, is
not an Heresy. S. Austen says, Errare possum, etc. In an error I may be,
but an Heretic I cannot be. Jewel.

How Heresy is to be avoided and punished.
A man that is given to Heresy, after the first and second admonition avoid,
etc. Tit. 3. 10.
After that the godly Minister has by the mighty word of God, convinced any
man of heresy, if that man will obstinately abide in his erroneous opinion and
doctrine, it is lawful for the godly Magistrate to punish him with ye sword,
this place (which does only pertain to the Minister, unto whom the temporal
sword is not delivered) notwithstanding. Paul did smite Bariesu with
blindness. Act. 13. 11. And ye Lord Deuteronomy. 13. 5. did command y^ the false
Prophet shall be slain and put to death. This law is not yet abolished. Sir.
I. Cheek.

This Commandment is given to the Minister, and so particularly to all men to
whom ye sword is not committed, but else the Magistrate whose chief office is
to maintain Gods glory in his Church, ought to cut of all such rotten and
infectious members from the body. Geneua.

HERETIC.
What is to be done with Heretics.
MY brethren (says James) if any of you do straie from the truth, so that
any man convert him, he must know that who soever do cause a sinner to turn
from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death. But now a days you
may find men, that will travail rather to overthrow, then to turn heretics.
The Lord (says Augustine) does overthrow the kingdoms of error through his
servant, but he gives charge, that the men, forasmuch as they be men, should
be rather reformed then lost. Neither ought we to despair of the turning of
our brother which is fallen into Heresy. For unless that such a one might be
converted, by the grace of the Lord, the advice of James had been utterly to
no purpose. This Augustine knew well, and therefore he employed himself
wholly unto the converting of Heretics, and that with great lenity and
mildness of spirit, according unto the monition of the Apostle. Again he
says, It was our duty to choose and to wish the best, that we might make our
way to your reformation, not in contention, wrawling and persecution, but by
comforting of you gently, by aduising you favorably, by reasoning mildly, as
it is written: It becomes not the servant of the Lord to strive, but to be
lowly toward all men, favorably to teach, patient, reforming them that be of
a contrary mind with modesty. Muscu^us. fol. 535.

How they ought not to be compelled.
Christ came not into this world to compel men unto him, etc. Chrysostom
says: In case that they which do allure men from us, unto the company and
sect of most silthy folk, think that they be able to get away some great and
notable person, then they tremble and quake exceedingly, and be much afraid
least he shall turn back again. He will be of their side (say they) and
indeed such a fellow will turn a thousand times, I mean not of them y^ be
sinners, but in case there be any which is without any spot of sin, and will be
turned and altered, let him go and turn. Surely I am sorry for it, and do
wail and lament, and am stricken to the very heart with all, no less then if
it chanced me to have one of mine own members cut off. But yet for all that,
I do not so lament that, that I shall be driven upon this fear, to do any
thing that is uncomely. We do not lordly rule and govern your faith, my most
dear brethren, neither do we command yo^ these things upon any title of
imperie or lordlinesse.

It is the doctrine of the word which is committed unto us, not the authority
of Princelinesse or power. We stand in the degree of counsailers and aduisers,
he which gives his advice and shows his opinion, does not compel the hearer,
but does leave a free choice to his power what to do. And he is to be blamed
only for this, if he say not those things which becomes him, and which he
is bound to do. This says Chrysostom. Muscu. fol. 536.

Of the opinions of Heretics, look at their proper names, as they fall out in
this book.

HEROD.
Of his great cruelty.
Herod 1. Herod
the first, which was also called Ascalon, had many children, among ye which
he himself caused three to be slain, Aristobolus, Alexander and Antipater, by
reason of a conspiracy that they had made against their father. But after him
remained alive, Archelaus, Herodes which was surnamed Antipas, and Philippus.
These parted the kingdom among them. Carrion. fol. 75.

And sieve all the children that were in Bethleem. Mar. 2. 16
Of this is mention made in the second Book and fourth Chapter of his
Saturnalies. How Augustus Caesar hearing that Herod had likewise killed his
own son, said: It were better to be Herodes Swine, then his Son. T. M.

When Macrobius heard that all the Children that were two year old and under
should be slain, and that among the multitude his own Son was slain also,
he said: I had rather be Herodes dog then his son. Marl. 34.

How and for what cause this Herod burnt the Scriptures.
King Herod, for that he well understood the baseness of his house, therefore
he burnt the Scriptures: least by y^ mean of such ancient Records, some doubt
might after ward be moved, Ambr. in Luca. lib. 3. cap. 3.
against his posterity. For he thought if he had once removed such monuments,
it could never be proved by any manner of other witness, but that he came by
descent from the stock of the Patriarchs and old Proselites, whereas indeed
(says Master Jewel) he was a mere Aliene, and a stranger to the house of
Israel, and a very tyrannous usurper of the Crown, as being (...)allie
descended, not from Jacob, but from Esau. Jewel. sol. 477.

Of his death it is written thus.
Herodes disease vexed him more and more, Josephus Ant. Iud. li. 17. cap. 8. 9.
Anno Christi. 6. Augu 47. Euse. chr.
God executing justice on him^for the thing which he impioustie committed. It
was a slow o^ slack fire, yet yielding not so great inslamation outwardly to
the beholders, as vexation inwardly to the int^rnal parts, he had a vehement
desire gr^ed^lie to take some thing, yet was there nothing that sufficed him.
Moreover inward rotting of the bowels, and specially (...) (...)uous Flux in
the Fundament, a raw and a running fl^ame about his feet, and the like
malady vexed him about his Bladder. His privy members put^ified, engendring
worms, which swarmed out a shrill stretched wind, he had great pain(...)
br^athing, and a gross breath, having throughout all the parts of his body
such a Crampe, as strength was not able to sustain. It was reported by them
which were inspired from above, and to whom the gift of Divination was
granted, that God en^o^ned the Prince this punishment, for his great impiety.
Eusebius. fol. 12.

Of the second Herod, son to the first.
At that time Herod Tetrarcha, etc. Mat. 14. 1.
This Herod was the son of y^ Herod of the great Antipater, surmaned of some
Ascalon, which slew the I^fants in Bethleem, 2. Herod
being a most pernicious Raven, hatched of so wicked an Egg. Some call this
Herod Antipas sor his surname. He is the very same which araied our Savior
with a white vesture, and de^ided his Divine wisdom, making an open jest and
laughing slocke of him. Of this man Josephus makes mention in his 18. Book of
the Antiquities of the Jews. Marl. upon Matthew, fol. 305.

How he led away his brother Philips wife.
This man was surnamed Antipas, the brother of Archel^us, and made Prince of
Galile by his father Herod. The same took his brother Philips wife from him
he being yet alive, the which happened by this occasion: Herod went to Rome,
and by the way, he lodged by chance with his brother Philip, who dwelled in
ye forepart of Iewrie. As Herod and Herodias had now made acquaintance, which
Herodias was the daughter of Aristobolus, and sister to Herod Agrippa, they
were agreed, y^ he coming from Rome, should lead her with him, the which was
done. John Baptist rebuked this wickedness, who was therefore beheaded.
Howbeit Herod went not unpunished at the last for it. For by Caius Caligula was
he sent in exile, at Leonia in Galile with Herodia, the which constrained him
to go to Rome and require a kingdom, but coming home with out doing ought,
he lost that part also of the kingdom, which he possessed before. He reigned
24. years in Galile.

For Herod had taken John and bound him, Mat. 14. 3.
etc. The Evangelists affirm that John was taken, because he openly condemned
the incestious Matrimony of Herod with Herodias, which was his brother
Philips wife: for John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to know her.
Josephus alleges another cause why he was put in prison, namely because by
his doctrine (to the which the people wonderfully resorted) he brought
himself in some suspicion with Herod, of the moving of some new attempt or
unwonted matter. But it might be that the wicked Tyrant took this as a
cloak, to cover his cruel murdering of John. Or it might be, that this wicked
rumor was spread abroad of him, for unjust violence and cruelty, is never
without diverse accusations. But the Evangelist show the very cause indeed,
namely that Herod was an enemy unto the holy man, because he was sharply
reprehended of him. For Josephus Josephus deceived.
is deceived, which thought that Herodias was not taken from Philip, the
brother of Herod but from Herod the king of Chalos his fathers brother, for
at what time the Evangelist writ, the remembrance of the wicked deed, was not
only new, but also common in the eyes of all men.

And whereas Josephus in another place says, that Philip was of a soft wit,
in consideration and hope whereof, there is no doubt, but that Herod was the
more bold to accomplish his will, and to abuse the modesty of Philip, not
fearing any punishment.

Here is also another probable conjecture that Herodias was rather given in
Matrimony to Philip her fathers brother, then to her great Uncle the Father
of her Graundfather, which for age was even crooked. But Herod Antipas here
mentioned, and Philip, were not brethren by the mother side, but Herod was
the son of Marthaca the third wife of great Herod, and Philip was borne of
Cl^opatra. Marl. fol. 307.

And when he knew he was of Herodes jurisdiction, Luke. 23. 7
he sent him to Herod. This was Herod Antipas, the Tetrarch, in the time of
whose governance, which was almost the space of 22. years, John the Baptist
preached, and was put to death.

And Jesus Christ also died and rose again, and the Apostles began to
preach, and diverse things were done at Jerusalem, almost seven years after
Christ's death. This Herod was sent into banishment to Lions, about the second
year of Caius Caesar. Beza.

Of Herod Agrippa.
This man was the son of Aristobolus, the son of the first Herod, and was
slain by his Father, he was prisoner in Rome, in the time of Tiberius, and
afterward in great favor with Caius Caligula the Emperor, of whom he
obtained the part of Philip his brother, and the name of a King.

Afterward, the Land also which Herod Antipas had, he obtained of Claudius,
Samaria and Iewrie. And by this occasion was whole Iewrie subject again, unto
one man's Domion. The Apostle James the greater was put to death, by this
Herod, the which is mentioned in the 12. chapter of the Acts. He reigned
seven years. Carrion.

About this time, Act. 12. 1.
Herod the king stretched out his hand, etc. This name Herod was common to
all them y^ came of the stock of Herod Ascalonites, whose surname was Magnus.
But he that is spoken of here was nephew to Herod the great son to
Aristobolus, and father to that Agrippa, who is spoken of afterward. Beza.

What the Herodians were.
The Herodians Heretics
were they of the Jews, which thought that Herod was Christ, and applied unto
him the Prophecy of Jacob (Genesis 49. 10.) The Scepter shall not depart from
Judah, etc. Which is veri^ied in none other but in Christ. Epipha. li. 1. tom.
1. haeres. 20.

HEAVEN.
Of the opening of heaven.
WHere the Heavens opened, etc. Eze. ^. 5.
That is where there were mysteries opened from Heaven. Steven also the first
Martyr saw the Heavens open, and Jesus standing on the right hand, etc. Act.
7. 56. So are the Heavens open in the faith of the believer, that he sees God
in his glory. The Heavens are counted in the Scripture to be opened, when a
manifest Uision, revelation, sign or token, is showed of God unto man. Math.
3. 16. Mar. 1. 10. T. M.

HIDE.
What the hiding of Gods face is.
ANd will hide my face from them. Deu. 31. 17
To Hide his face, is as much as not to hear, and to take away the tokens of
his kindness, as when he gives no care to us or our prayers, nor shows us
any token of love, but sets before our eyes grievous afflictions, and even
very death. As in Job. 13. 20. Math. 3. 4. T. M.

I will hide, etc. That is, I will take my favor from them. As to turn his
face toward us, is to show us his favor. Geneua.

HIENA.
Of the property of this beast.
WHat peace is there between Hiena and a Dog. E^^. 13. 19
Hiena is a wild beast that counterfaiteth the voice of men, and so inticeth
them out of their houses, and deuour^th them. Geneua.

That is, with a sinner that returns continually to his sin again, as a
Dog to his vomit. Or ^ls after the other Translation, Hiena is a subtle
beast, watching about shepherds folds, rese^bling a man's voice, and lerning
certain names, does call them forth, and so dest^^ieth them, whose nature is
contrary to the dog, which is a keeper of the fold, and friendly to men.
The Bible note.

HYMENEVS.
Of this man's opinion.
HYmeneus and Philetus said: 2. Tim. 2. 17.
that the resurrection was already past.

HIGH PRIEST.
How the high Priests office was divided.
WHen Annas and Caiphas were high Priests. Luke. 3. 2
By the law there should have been, but one high Priest, but corruption of the
time, by reason the Romans had rule, and the briberie of Caiphas brought to
pass that the office was divided. The Bible note.

There could be by Gods law but one sacrificer at once. But because of the
troubles that then reigned, the office was so mangled by reason of ambition and
briberie, that both Caiphas and Annas his Father, had it divided between them.
Geneua.

How every Bishop is called by the name of high Priest.
The safety of the Church hangs upon the dignity of the high Priest. Which
authority S. Hierome Hierome
in that place, does attribute to the Bishop of every Diocese. Hierome con.
Luci.

Tertulian Tertulian
says, The high Priest, that is, the Bishop has authority to minister
Baptime. Tertulian de Baptismo.

Augustine Augustin^
says, Quid est Episcopus, etc. What is a Bishop, but the first Priest, that
is to say, the high Priest. August. questionibus de vtroq. Tes.

Euagrius calls ^^phemius and Gregorius the Bishop of Antioch, Su^mos
Sacardotes, the highest priests. Ruffinus calls Athanasius y^ Bishop of
Alexandria, Pontificem marinum, the greatest or highest Bishop. By these I
trust (says M. Jewel) it may appear, that the title or dignity of the
highest Priesthood, was general and common to al Bishops, and not only
closed up and mortified only in the Pope. Jewel. fol. 526.

HILL.
What is meant by this Hill.
Upon the hill shall be taken away the side vale, etc. By this hill is meant
the hill of Syon. By which is signified the Church. There will y^ Lord judge and
deliver us from al our enemies. By the vale and covering, understand sin,
wherein all men are found guilty. Romans 3. 23. All men have sinned, etc.

From it has the Lord delivered all men, which believe that he has freely
done it, of his own mercy for Christ's sake, and not for their deseruings.
Romans 3. 24. T. M.

HIN.
What manner of measure it was.
WIth the fourth part of an Hin of beaten Oil. Ex^. 29. 40
A Hin was a measure of Liquid things, containing. 12. Logins, and one Login
was so much, as would receive six Eggs. The Bible note.

Look. Eliote.

HINDER PART.
What is meant by the hinder part of God.
THe hinder part of God, Augustine.
is Christ's humanity, the which he took upon him in the end of the world,
that we might live without end.

HYPOCRITE.
What an hypocrite is.
AN hypocrite is as much to say as a fainer or dissembler, or a player, which
represents the person of an other man, which seems to be such a one as
indeed he is not. Marl. upon Math. fol. 113.

Hypocrisy described.
We see many which bear the face of very zealous Christians, so long as it
is but to dispute and to hold long talk, and to bear men in hand that they
study to serve God, and to honor him, and yet for all that, as soon as they
have to do with their neighbor, a man shall perceive what they have in their
hearts, for they seek their own advantage, and make no conscience to rake to
themselves, and to beguile folk when they have them in their danger, by what
means so ever it be. Now then there is no doubt, but that those which seek
their own advantage and profit, are hypocrites. Calvin upon Job. foi. 4.

HYPOTIPOSIS.
What this word signifies.
IT is a figure called Illustration, by the which the form of things is so set
forth in words, that it seems rather to be seen with the eyes, th^^ heard
with the ears. Marl. upon Math. fol. 607.

HIRE.
What is meant by hire, wages, or reward.
AND my hire is with me. Apo. 22. 1^
Here Christ shows himself to be judge of the whole world, inasmuch as he
avouches that he will render every man his reward. For all this whole book
treaseth of the holiness and righteousness of the chosen, and likewise of the
naughtiness of the cast-awaies, wherefore it behooves us to be heedfull, that
every one of us do diligently perform his duty according to his calling.
As for the profiting or not profiting of our labor, that must we put to the
discreation of him that promises to yield to every man his reward according
to his work. Let us not sleep as other do, but let us watch and be sober. 1.
The. 5. 6. waiting for the blessed hope, and for y^ appearing of y^ glory of y^
great God, and of our savior Jesus Christ. Tit. 2. 13. Moreover ye hire whereof
mention is made here, must be referred, not to ye desert of the work as ye
meritmo^gers talk, but to y^ believing of y^ promise, according to this text,
when ye have done all that is enioined you, say ye, we are unprofitable
servants, and have done that which we ought to do. Luke. 17. 10. Marl. upon
the Apoc. fol. 312.

Why eternal life is called by the name of hire.
And y^ thou should render hire unto thy servants, etc. Apo. 11. 18
The Lord shall bring to light the things that are covered, and make the
righteousness of y^ godly to shine as the noone day, whom the graceless
world had condemned for the worst of al men. Psa. 32. 6. Esa. 58. 8. 1. Cor. 4.
5. And it is called by y^ name of hire in the Scripture, not absolutely, nor
yet for y^ works sake, but in respect of y^ bountifulnes of the promiser, as
for example. If a man ^uie a bondslaue, he is wholly at his masters
commandment: And whatsoever service or toil he does, it is only his Lord
and masters. Now if his master should of his own free goodness promise his
slave any wages for showing himself diligent and faithful in doing his
service, surely it were rather a reward then of hire, but yet the masters
promising of it, gives it the name of hire, by reason whereof our Savior
Christ says, When you have done all that is commanded you, say ye, we be
unprofitable servants. Luke. 17. 10. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 164.

HISTORY.
What an history is.
TVllie calls an history the witness of times, the light of virtue, the
life of memory, Maistres of life.

HOBAB.
What this Hobab was.
AND Moses said to Hobab the son of Raguel the Madia^te, Nu. 10. 29
Moses Father in law. Hobab is the same which before is called Iethro, even as
Solomon is called in some place Idida: and as Osias is also called Azarias. He
was the son of Raguel, and Father to Zephora Moses wife, Albeit that in the
second of Exodus Raguel is called her Father, not because he was so indeed,
but because he was her Fathers Father, which manner of speaking is not a few
times used in the Scripture. T. M.

Some think that Raguel, Iethro, Hobab, and Keni, were alone. Kimhi says,
that Raguel was Iethroes Father: So Hobab was Moses Father in law. Geneua.

HOLY.
Who is holy.
HE is holy that is borne again by the word of life and hallowed, ^poc. 20. 6
that is to say made clean by Christ's spirit, and so ^s become the dwelling
place of God. In the respect whereof Paul calls them holy, which are borne
again through the fountain of life. Romans 1. 7. 1. Cor. 1. 2. For the chosen
hear how the Lord says: Be ye holy as I am holy. Leuit. 11. 44. 1. Pet. 1.
16. Also God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness. 1. These. 4.
7. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 276.

How Christ is called holy.
Thus says he that is holy, Apo. 3. 7.
etc. Christ Jesus is properlye termed holy, and so soothfast, because that
all other things, yea even the Stars of the Sky are defiled and untrue, in
comparison of him, for he is God blessed for ever. Romans 9. 5. Moreover he
only is holy in respect of his manhood, because being segregated from the
number of sinners, he always performed the things that pleased his Father, and
became obedient unto him, even unto death. He did not sin, neither was there
any guile found in his mouth. Heb. 7. 26. John. 8. 29. Psalm. 2. 8. 1. Pe. 2.
22. Hereby only has he reconciled us unto God, and obtained faith and grace
at his hand for us, becoming our righteousness and holiness. 1. Cor. 1. 30.
To be short, he is worthelie termed the holy of holiest. Dan. 9. 24. Marl.
upon the Apoc. fol. 60

What is meant by the Angels crieng, Holy, Holy, Holy.
And one cried to an other and said, Holy, Holy, Holy. Esaie. 6. ^.
This often repetition signifies that y^ holy Angels cannot satisfy themselves
in praising God, to teach us that in all our lives, we should give our selves
to the continual praise of God. Geneua.

The meaning of the Prophet in this place.
With the holy thou shall be holy, Psa. 1^. 25.
and with the perfect thou shall be perfect, with the clean thou shall be
clean, and with the froward thou shall be froward. This text most commonly
hath^bene alleged to this end: That if a man did acquaint himself and keep
company with good men, he should learn by their example, custom, and
company keeping, to be a good and a godly man. And contrariwise, who did keep
company with the ungodly, with mockers and scorners, with liars and swearers,
or with any other notably spotted with any kind of vice, or evil manners,
the company keeper with such, must needs at the length be infected with the
same vices. And therefore Cato gave a precept to young children, Tu bonis
ambula, My child keep company with them that be good, for it is most true
that the Apostle says: Corrumpant mores bonos colloquia praua: Naughty and
filthy talk do oftentimes corrupt good manners: To this purpose and end
therefore to teach men this holy wholesome lesson to beware of evil company,
and to join them to good company, was this text commonly alleged: Cum
sancto sanctus eris, etc. Which sentence as it is very good, so it is not true
nor agreeing with y^ mind of the Prophet. For his meaning in this place is, y^
God with a man y^ is holy, he will be holy, that is, he will be present with him
and maintain his holiness. And with him that is present and sound without
wrinkles or wiles, God will dwell with him and strengthen him in his
perfectness, and with the pure the Lord will be pure, and with the froward,
the Lord will deal frowardlie, not y^ there is any frowardness or
peruertnesse in God: but deals frowardlie after the manner of speaking of y^
Scripture, when he punishes ye frowardness of men. Like as God is holy with
them that be holy, y^ is, he prospers them in their holiness. Now ye see y^
albeit, this as a good and godly sentence gathered of these words: Cum sancto
sanctus eris, etc. With him that is holy, virtuous, and good, a man (keeping
company with such) shall have a smacke of his holiness and vertuousnesse: And
he that shall use to keep company with the wicked and ungodly, shall grow to
wickedness and ungodliness: yet the more true and the very German sense of
these words in this: to apply them to the practices of God, and not company
keeping with man: whose property is to be merciful, and to show his loving
favor unto men freely without our deserving, and yet this favor does follow
them that apply themselves to holiness and vertuousnesse. Ric. Turnar.

HOLY GHOST.
How and when the visible sign of the holy Ghost was received.
ANd they received the holy Ghost, etc. Act. 8. 17.
Understand in a manifest and visible sign, as the Apostles themselves
received it, in the first day, or (as we call it) Whitsondaie, which thing at
y^ time was necessary, for the furtherance and stablishment of the preaching
of the Gospel, although not needful to salvation. But now that the preaching
thereof is sufficiently confirmed, this visible miracle is ended, and yet
remains that still which was stablished by the miracle, y^ is, by the
preaching of y^ Gospel is ministered the holy Ghost, although our bodily eye
see it not, by whom faith comes, which receives Christ to be our
righteousness, sanctification and redemption. 1. Cor. 1. 30. Tindale.

How the holy Ghost is God, proved by the Scriptures.
Are ye not ware that ye are the Temple of God, 1. Cor. 3. 16
and how that the spirit of God dwells in you. If any man defile y^ temple
of God, ^. Cor. 6. 16
him shall God destroy, for the temple of God is holy, which Temple are ye. 1.
Cor. 6. 19
And again, ye are the Temple of the living God, as says God, I will dwell
among them and be their God, and they shall be my people. But we are also
called in Scripture, y^ temples of the holy Ghost. For know ye not says
Paul, that your bodies are the temples of ye holy Ghost, which is in you,
wherefore it must needs be granted that the holy Ghost is God.

What man knows the things of man, 1. Cor. 1. 11
save the spirit of man which is within him. Even so ye things of God knows
no man, but ye spirit of God: By which sentence it is evident, y^ as is the
spirit of man to manward, so is the spirit of God to Godward, and as the spirit
and body is but one man, and yet have several offices, even so the Father,
Son, and holy Ghost, although they be distinct in name and office, are yet
but one God.

S. Paul says, If the spirit of him y^ raised up Christ from death dwell in
you, Romans 8. 11
even he y^ raised up Christ from death, shall quicken your mortal bodies,
because of his spirit that dwells in you. And again, speaking of the same
holy Ghost, he says: If there be any man that has not the spirit of Christ,
Romans 8. 9.
the same is none of his. For as much then as the same holy Ghost, is
indifferently the spirit of the Father and of the ^onne, it must needs be
granted, that he is of the self same nature and substance with them both,
and so all one God with them. This sentence also proves Christ to be God.

Peter said to Ananias, how is it that Satan has filled thine heart, that thou
should lie unto the holy Ghost. And after that he saith^ Thou have not lied
unto me, but unto God. Wherefore seeing he says, in lieng unto the holy Ghost,
he lied unto God, it cannot be denied but that the holy Ghost is God.

None may be every where and in all persons at once but God: Act. 2. 5.
The holy Ghost may be in all men and every where at one time and moment,
Ergo the holy Ghost is God.

None has power to send forth and appoint Christ to y^ preaching of the
Gospel but God, Luke. 4. 18
but the holy Ghost has done the same, as Christ himself affirms out of
Esaie the Prophet, saying: Esa. 61. 1.
The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to preach the
Gospel to the poor, and has sent me to heal the broken in heart, 1. John. 5.
7
wherefore the holy Ghost is God.

There are three says John that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word,
and the holy Ghost, and these three are one. And although some men affirm y^
this sentence (these three are one) is not found written in y^ Greek, yet is it
altogether untrue, for y^ Greek translation has it. But if it were not in y^
Greek, what is that for us, seeing the self same thing may be proved by
other places of Scripture, for Christ says: I and the father are one. And the
holy Ghost also, is not only the spirit of the Father, but also of the
son, and so is of one nature and substance with them, as is before said,
wherefore it may well be said, y^ he is God, and y^ these three are one, and
bear record of the truth, for he says, If we receive the witness of man,
yea, the witness of God is greater. The witness of them, is the witness of
God, Ergo the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost are God.

It is only the office of God to elect and choose ministers which are fit to
govern his Church, Act. 12. 24
and therefore the Apostles setting Barnabas and Mathias before God, said thus:
Thou Lord which know the hearts of all men, show whether of these two thou
have chosen. But y^ holy Ghost also appoints ministers to preach, Act. 13. 2.
for it is written that the holy Ghost said: Separate me Barnabas and Saul,
unto ye work whereunto I have called them. And again says Paul: Take heed
unto your selves, Act. 20. 28
and to all the flock, amongst whom y^ holy Ghost has made you overseers to
rule ye congregation of God, which he has purchased with his blood, wherefore
it cannot be denied but y^ the holy Ghost is God. The self same reason uses
Athanasius against Arrius the chief Author of this sect.

None has power to adopt us to be the children of God, but God only: but by
the holy Ghost we are adopted to be the children of God, for Paul calls the
holy Ghost, the spirit of Adoption, and all because we are thereby made the
children of God, Ergo the holy Ghost is God.

How the Holy ghost is God, proved by the ancient Doctors.
S. Augustine August.
says thus: Spiritus sanctus est D^us, etc. The Holy ghost is God: Therefore
Peter when he said unto Ananias, thou have enterprised to lie unto the Holy
ghost, he followed readely and told him what was the Holy ghost, and said:
Thou have not lied unto men, but unto God. August. cont. literas petilia. li.
3. cap. 28.

This place of Saint Austen is against those, that will quarrel and say, that
the Godhead of the Holy ghost cannot be proved by express words of the
Scripture. Jewel. fol. 91.

Nazianzenus Nazianzenus.
says: Dicit aliquis, etc. Some man will say, it is not written that the Holy
ghost is God, but I will bring thee forth a whole swarm of authorities,
whereby it shall appear that the Godhead of the holy Ghost, is plainly
witnessed in the Scripture: Unless a man will be very dull, and utterly
void of the holy Ghost. Nazianzenus de spiritu sancto^

Didimus Didimus.
in his book De spiritu far cto, which Saint Hierome did translate, proves
that the holy Ghost is very God, because he is in many places at one time,
which no creature can be. For (says he) all creatures visible and invisible,
be circumscribed and environed, either within one place (as corporable and
visible things be) or with the property of their substa^nce, (as Angels and
invisible creatures) so that an Angel (says he) cannot be at one time in two
places. And for as much as the holy Ghost is in many places at one time,
therefore (says he) the holy Ghost must needs be God. Did^mus de spiritu
sancto. li. 1.

The Angel (says Basil Basil.
) which was with Cornelius, was not at the same time with Philip. Nor the
Angel which spoke to Zachary in the Altar, was not the same time in his
proper place in heaven, but the holy Ghost was at one time in Abacuck, and in
Daniel in Babylon, and with Jeremy in prison, and with Ezechiel in Chober,
whereby he proves that the ho^^e Ghost is God. Basil de spiritu sancto. cap.
22.

HOLY WATER.
How it was called in the old time.
THen the Priest shall take the holy Water, Nu. 5. 17.
etc. Which also is called the water of purification or sprinkling. Nu. 19 9.
because they that were separated for their uncleanness, were sprinkled
therewith and made clean. In Hebrew it is called the water of sin, because
it is made to purge sin. Nu. 8. 7. It is also called holy water, because it
was ordained to an holy use. Geneua.

Of the Popish holy water and use thereof.
Pope Alexander ordained and commanded all his Priests to make holy water,
not to be a remembrance of Christ's blood and of our Baptime, but to purge men
from sin, as his words do testify in the book of the Popes decrees: Aquam
sale conspersam populi benedicemus, etc. We bless water sprinkled with salt
for y^ people, that they sprinkled therewith may be hallowed and cleansed. The
which thing we command all Sacrificers or Priests likewise to do. For if the
Ashes of a Calfe sprinkled with blood, hallowed and cleansed the people: much
more water sprinkled with salt, and sanctified with good prayers, halloweth and
cleanses the people. These be the words of Pope Alexander both vain and
superstitious.

HOMILIES.
Bucers judgment concerning Homilies read in the Church.
IT is better (says he) that where there lackes to expound the Scriptures
unto the people, there should be godly and learned homilies read unto them,
rather then they should have no exhortation at all in ye administration of the
Supper. And a little after he says: There be too few homilies, and too few
points of religion taught in them: when therefore the Lord shall bless this
kingdom with some excellent preachers, let them be commanded to make mo
homilies of the principal parts of Religion, which may be read to the people
by those Pastors that cannot make better themselves. Bucer.

HONOR.
What Honor signifies.
IN giving honor go one before an other. Honor is here taken, Romans 12. 10
not only for a certain outward reverence, whereby we reverence the dignity
of our neighbor, but also for an outward help, succor and aid, whereby we
help those that stand in need. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 419.

What honor is to be given to the wife.
Giving honor unto the wife. 1. Pet. 3. 7.
Erasmus in his Annotations notes out of Saint Hierome, that to give honor
here, is not to bow the knee, neither to deck them with gold and precious
stones, neither to set them in the upper seats and highest places, which
manner we see most foolishlie used in diverse regions, but to abstain from
fleshly lusts, for so (says Hierome) is honor given unto women, if they be
not defiled with over much wantonness and lust. The signification of this
word honor, does also extend it self, to amiable, kind, and loving speech,
and to the ministering unto the wife, such things as she needs, as far
forth as thine ability stretches. Tindale.

What it is to honor parents.
Honor thy Father and thy Mother. Exe. 20. 12
To honor Father and Mother, is not only to show obedience unto them, but
also to help them in their age, if they be poor and needy. As Ephe. 6. 2.
Mar. 7. 10. Math. 15. 4. Romans 13. 7. T. M.

By the which is meant, all that have authority over us. Geneua.

Of three manner of honors, a divine honor, a civil honor, and an Idol
honor.
There be many words indifferent to diverse and contrary significations, as
are, Adoro, Colo, Seruio, to bow down, worship, to serve and to kneel, 3.
manner of honors
which when the word following is added, as to say, Adoro Deum, vel Imaginem:
vel hom^em. It is soon seen what worship is meant, for the Scriptures put
never any such word alone, but express what thing is worshipped or honored.
In ye former chapter it is written, y^ the king fell down before Daniel, and
honored him with a civil honor. And we are commanded so to honor our
parents, princes, and ministers of y^ word, etc. but no where commands god,
but utterly forbids it to fall down before, or to honor Images: wherefore it
is plain Idolatry to fall down or to kneel before the^: and it cannot be
excused nor mocked out with any popish gloss of a certain reverent behavior
before Images. For Images be called in scripture abhominatio^, and y^ execrable
signs of y^ destruction of y^ popish Church. Dan. 9. And Christ himself
confirming i^ adds.

Who so reads the place let him understand it. Wherefore when an Idol or
Image or false Gods follow any of these words, Adoro, Colo, Seruio, and such
like, then beware of that act, fall not down with no reverent behavior nor
worship thou them, but say with Daniel and his fellows, yea, and as Christ
said to the devil: To thy Lord God shall thou do reverent behavior, and him
only shall thou serve and worship. Let these defenders of Idolatry show us
one place in all scripture, which either commands or permits any Idol
honor, or Image service, which they call adoration or reverent behavior to
any Image, if they cannot, then let us say unto them as Christ said to
Satan: Avoid ye devils, and learn to worship your Lord God, and him only
serve, etc. Melancthon upon Daniel.

HOPE.
A definition of Hope.
HOpe is a faculty or power breathed into us by the holy Ghost, whereby we
with an assured and patient mind wait for, that the salvation begun by Christ,
and received of us by Faith, should one day be perfected in us, not for our
merits, but through the mercy of God. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans

Hope is an evident showing of things not appearing, a seeing of things not
seen, a witness of dark things, a presence of things absent, and open
showing of hidden things. Call. in his Insti. 3. b. chap. 2. Sect. 4.

Hope is a most firm and undoubted looking after those things which we
believe. Bull. fo. 34.

Hope is a trusty looking after the thing that is promised us to come: as we
hope for the everlasting joy which Christ has promised unto all that believe
in him. Book of Mar. fo. 1112.

How hope is of things absent.
We are saved by hope (says Paul) but hope that is seen is no hope, Romans 8.
24
for how can a man hope for that which he sees, but and if we hope for that
which we see not, then do we with patience abide for it. Abraham hoped that he
should receive the promised land, when as yet he possessed not one foot of
ground in it, but saw it inhabited of most puissaunt nations. Moses hoped that
he should deliver the people of Israel out of Egypt, and place them in the
land of promise, where as yet he saw not the manner and means how he should do
it. David hoped that he should reign over Israel, and yet he felt the peril
of Saul and his servants hanging over his head, so that oftener then once he
was in danger of his life. The Apostles and holy Martyrs of Christ, did hope
that they should have eternal life, and that God would never forsake them,
and yet nevertheless, they felt the hatred of all sorts of people, they were
banished their Countries, and lastly were slain by sundry torments. So (I
say) is ye hope and looking for of things not present and things not seen. Yea
it is a sure and most assured looking for of things to come, and that not of
things whatsoever, but of those which believe in faith, and of those which are
promised to us, by ye very true, living, and eternal God. For S. Peter says:
Hope perfectly in the grace which is brought unto you. Now they hope
perfectly, which do without doubting commit themselves wholly unto the grace
of God, and do assuredly look for to inherit life everlasting. Bullinger.
fol. 305.

How hope hangs upon faith.
Hope is nothing else, but a looking for those things, which faith has
believed, to be truly promised of God. So faith believes that God is true:
Hope looks for the performaunce of his truth in convenient time: Faith
believes y^ he is our father, Hope looks for him to show himself such a one
toward us. Faith believes that eternal life is given us: Hope looks y^ it be
one day revealed. Faith is the foundation whereupon Hope rests: Hope
nourishes and susteineth Faith, etc. Calvin. 3. b. Chap. 2. Sect. 42.

Of Augustines Hope.
Augustine Augustine
in his book of Meditation, writes of the confirmation of his Hope, in this
sort. There be three things which do strengthen and confirm my heart, that
no lack of deserts, no consideration of mine own ba^enesse, no regard of
the heavenly blessedness, can thrust me down from the expectation of my
hope. My soul is fast rooted therein. And will thou know what the matter is?
I do weigh and consider three points, in which my whole hope does consist. That
is to wit, the love of adoption, the truth of the promise, and the power to
perform. Now let my foolish imagination wonder as much as it list, and say,
what art thou? Or, how great a glory is this? Or by what desert do thou hope
to obtein this thing? And I will boldly answer: I know whom I have believed,
and am assured that God has adopted me in exceeding great love, and that he is
true in his promise, and able in performance, for he is able to do what he
will. Musculus. fo. 459.

HORIMS.
What manner of people the Horims were.
A Kind of Giants, and signifies noble, because that of pride, they called
themselnes noble or Gentles. Tindale. fol. 16.

HORN.
What this word Horn, signifies.
AND has raised up the horn of salvation. Luke. 1. 69
This word Horn in the Hebrew tongue signifies might, and it is a Metaphore
taken from beasts that fight with their horns. And by raising up the might of
Israel, is meant y^ the kingdom of Israel was defended, and the enemies thereof
laid on the ground, even then when the strength of Israel seemed to be
utterly decayed.

The Horn of my health, etc. He calls God the horn of his health, Psalm. 18.
2.
because by him he had subdued his enemies and obtained health. It is a
borrowed speech of horned beasts, which with their horns defend themselves,
and drive away them that fight against them. T. M.

Ye shall understand y^ the Scripture does commonly use the Metaphore of the
word Cornu, an Horn, for the most perfect and pure strength: The translation
being taken of horned beasts, whose power and defense be altogether in their
horns.

The same Metaphore and the same words we have in the Gospel of Luke, in the
song of Zachary: Et erexit Cornu salutis nobis in domo, etc. This Horn of
salvation is an other manner of horn, then y^ horn which ye fables of ye Poet
do speak off. They have a pretty and pleasant fable, not altogether unlike to
some of our pilgramage fables, which was this, That Jupiter, which in deed was
a bastard borne, being cast out of his mother at al adventures (as oftentimes
bastards be) nevertheless his father Saturnus caused a Goat to give him suck,
and two Nymphs to nurse him, the one was called Adrasia, and the other Ida. The
name of the Goat that gave him suck, was Amalthea, which Amalthea after y^
Jupiter was a great old god, he set her among the stars: sau^ y^ he gave of his
liberality one of Amalthes horns to his two nursses, granting to y^ Goats
horn this property, That whatsoever they should wish for, it should by and by
spring out of that horn, of the which fable sprang a Proverb, Cekas
Amaltheias: Hoc est Cornu Amalthea: sieve cor nu copia, plenty of al things.
This was a foolish fable and a stark lie of the Heathen Poets: but the horn of
salvation which the Scripture speaks of, is nothing else but the almighty
and unspeakable power of Gods defense for his true servants. Ric. Turnar.

HORNET.
What an Hornet is.
I Will send Hornets before thee, Exo. 23. 28
etc. A Hornet is like a Waspe, she is of more venomous nature, and stingeth
much sorer. As Deuteronomy. 7. 20. Iosu. 24. 12. T. M.

I sent Hornets before you. Iosu. 24. 12.
That is, I sent such things of fear and dread into the hearts of your
enemies, and so discouraged, dased and astonished them, that they were ready to
fall or ever ye came at them. T. M.

HORSE-LEACH.
What her two daughters be.
THe Horese-leach has two daughters, Pro. 30. 15
etc^. Two daughters, that is, two forks in her tongue, which he here calls
her two daughters, whereby she sucketh the blood, and is never saciate. Even so
are the covetous extortioners insatiable. Geneua.

HOSANNA.
What this word Hosanna signifies.
CRied, Mat. (...). (...)
saying, Hosanna. This was an ancient crieng, which they used in the feast of
Tabernacles, when they carried boughs, according as God commanded. Leuit. 23.
40. And the word is corruptly made of two, for we should say Hosheangua,
which is as much, as save I pray thee. Beza.

HOT.
Look. Cold.

HOVRES.
The distribution of the Hours among the elders.
THE elders did so divide the time, that always from the Sun setting to the
Sun rising they counted 12. houers. And again, as many from the rising of
the Sun, to the going down thereof. Again, they divide either time into four
spaces, and these they called watches, and every one of these spaces contained
three houres^ Wherefore the third hour from the rising of the Sun, is with
us, either the eight or ninth hour, as the time of the year requires, for
these hours are unequal. The sixth hour, is Noone, and the ninth is the third
at after noone: And the twelfeth at the Sun set. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol.
276.

And he went out about the third hour. Math. 20. 3
They divided the day into twelve hours, so that the third was the fourth
part of the day, six of the clock was noone, nine was three of the clock
after noone, and the eleventh hour Eleventh hour.
was an hour before the Sun set. Geneua.

What is meant by half an hour.
There was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. Apoc. 8. 1.
By this half hour some understand, the mean time betwixt the destruction of
Antichrist and Christ's coming to judgment. But for so much as the warre-fare of
the church must be endless in this world: such manner of rest is not to be
looked for in this world. Beside this, Antichrist shall never be put quite
away, till Christ himself come. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 8. Wherefore we rather say, That
this silence shall be in heaven at such time as the souls of them that be
slain shall cease their crieng for vengeance, because they see the Lords
rightful judgment upon the wicked, when they shall suffer due pu^ishment for
their wickedness, and by the half hour is rightly understood, the beginning
of the everlasting rest, because the number of seven is appointed for resting.
Genesis 2. 2. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 115.

Look. Silence.

HOUSE OF GOD.
What the house of God is.
HOw thou ought to behave thy self in the house of God. 1. Ti. 3. 1^


The Church or Congregation is called the house of God, because y^ God dwells
in the hearts of the faithful, in whom he reigns and declares his strength,
for they that have through ^aith dedicated or given themselves whollye unto
Christ, they themselves do not live, but Christ lives in them. Such
Congregations is the pillars and grounds of truth. For why, they are builded
upon a sure foundation, which is Christ, whose doctrine only they follow, Sir.
I. Cheek.

It is none other but even the house of God. He calls it the house of God,
Gen 28. 17
because of the household of Angels that he there saw. We in like manner call
the Church of lime and stone, the house of God, because the people come
thither, which are the Church of GOD, as Saint Paul teaches. 1. Cor. 3 16. 2.
Cor. 6. 16.

How this place following is understood.
He made them houses. Exo. 1. 21.
That is, He made a kindred or a multitude of people to spring out of them, as
we say, the house of David, for the kindred of David. Tindale. fol. 11.

Again, He made them houses. That is, he increased and multiplied them, and
made households of them, giving them both husbands and children. As in Genesis 7.
T. M.

Again, He made them houses. That is, either God blessed and increased the
families of the widows, or else blessed and increased the families of the
Israelites by them. The Bible note.

HVMILITIE.
A definition of Humility.
HE is humble indeed, which neither arrogateth any thing to himself before
God, nor disdainfully dispiseth his brethren, or co^eteth to seem his
superior, but counts it sufficient y^ he is taken for one of the members of
Christ, desiring nothing else but that the head may excel. Marl. 395.

Humility or lowliness, is not an imbasing of our selves, when we have where
with to magnify our selves. But it is acknowledging, that there is nothing but
wretchedness in us, and that if we would open our mouth to allege any thing
for our selves, we shall find nothing but utter con^usion in ^s, so that if
our hearts conceive any vain presumption, the same is but wind, which may
well burst us, but not feed us. Thus ye see what the right true humility or
lowliness imports, namely, that a man should not esteem of himself,
according also as in very truth we have no reason so to do: And whosoever
sets by himself, must needs be over blind and brutish, etc. Call. upon
Job. fol. 545.

Who they be that be humble.
The humble shall hear thereof and be glad. Psa. ^34. 2
The humble or meek, are all such as have determined within themselves to
bear the Cross, which are evil entreated of the world, because they be not
of the world. John. 15. 19. All such as are displeased with their own evils,
and thirst after righteousness, and in renouncing of themselves, do wholly
commit them into the hands of God, as in the Psalm. 25. 9. T. M.

They that be meek, will he guide in judgment, Psalm. 25. 9.
and teach the humble his way. He will govern and comfort them, that are
truly humbled for their sins. Geneua.

Look. Lowliness. Meek.

HUNDRED FOLD.
What it is to receive an hundred fold.
SHall receive an hundred fold. Mat. 19. 29
God has promised, if thou be meek and soft, and suffer a little persecution,
to give thee, not only in the life to come, but also an hundred fold here in
this life: that is to say, to give thee his self, and to be thy protector,
and to minister thee ever enough, which may of right be called, an hundred
fold, and is a treasure, passing the treasure of all Princes. Tindale. fol. 191.

HVNGER AND THIRST.
What it is to hunger and thirst for righteousness.
BLessed be they which hunger and thirst for righteousness, Math. 5. 6.
etc. Righteousness in this place, is not taken for the principal
righteousness, that makes a man good or acceptable before God: but for the
outward righteousness before the world, as true and faithful dealing each
with other, and just executing of the offices of all men in their degrees, and
meek obedience of all that be under power: so that the meaning is: Happy are
they which not only do their duties to all men, but also study and help to
the uttermost of their power, with word, deed, counsel and exhorting, that
all other deal truly also according to the degree that every man bears in
the world, and be as desirous to further good order and righteous dealing, as
the hungry and thirsty, is desirous to eat and drink. Tindale.

HVS.
Of the land of Hus.
SOme men do place the land of Hus far Eastward, Job. 1. 1
nevertheless in the fourth chapter of the Lamentations of Jeremy, the same
word Hus, is put for a part of Edom. We know that the Edomites are descended
of Esau. And true it is that they also had Circumcision, howbeit, forasmuch as
they were strayed away from Gods Church, they had it no more as the sign of
his covenant. Therefore if we take Job to have been of this land of Hus, then
was he an Edomite, that is to say, of the lyns of Esau, etc. Call. upon Job.
fol. 2.

HUSBAND.
What the husbands office is.
HUsbands love your wives, even as Christ loved the congregation, Ephesians. 5. 25.
and gave himself for it, and cleansed it in the fountain of water, through
his word, to make it unto himself a glorious Congregation without spot or
wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blame. So
ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife,
loves himself, for no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourished it,
etc.

What is meant by the husband of one wife.
A Bishop says S. Paul must be faultlesse, 1. Tim. 3. 2
the husband of one wife. Tit. 1. 6.
Saint Paul wills him to be so honest and so chaste a man, that he be content
with his one only wife, (for in those countries at that time, some man had more
then one) he forbids him not to marry again, after the death of his former
wife: For he that marries the second wife, is also the husband of one wife, so
long as he is content with her only. Melancthon

The husband of one wife. S. Paul writes not this, as making a law, as if it
were not lawful for a man to be made a Bishop without a wife: but he appoints
an order in that behalf, for it was lawful for the Jews to be coupled in the
second Matrimony, and for to have two wives at one time. Chrisost. in his
Epist. 1. ad Tim. homil. 10.

In like sort says S. Hierom: Hiero. in Epist. ad Tit. cap. 1
Touching this place some men think thus: by the custom of the Jews it was
lawful for a man to have two wives or more at once. And this they took to be
the Apostles commandment, that he that is to be chosen Bishop have not two
wives or more together at one time. Again he says: Let the Deacon be the
husband of one wife: not that they should needs marie a wife, if they have
none, but that they should not have two wives together.

Iacinct.
The description of the Iacinct, and what it betokens.
THe eleventh a Iacinct. Apo. 21. 20
This stone resembles the Air. In fair wether it is clear, and in foul
wether it is dim. And it signifies the spiritual wisdom, where through y^
faithful know how to apply themselves aright in matters and persons, according
as Paul exhorts when he says: Apply your selves to the time. Romans 12. 11.
Also behave your selves in such wise, as ye may give none offense, neither to
the Jews nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God, like as I please all
men in all cases, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that
they may be saved. 1. Cor. 10. 33. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 300.

The eleventh was a Iacinct, which is in color like unto water spread over with
bright Sun beams, and this betokens those that are barren from the science
and learning of the world, and yet have knowledge from above. Uery idiots
appear they in the sight of men, and yet are they taught of God, to disclose
most wonderful secrets. Of this sort was Oseas, Iohel, and Amos, which was but
a poor Shepherd, with the other inferior Prophets. And so were Andrew,
Philip and Thomas, with the other Apostles. Bale.

What Iacinct signifies here in this place.
Iacinct, Exo 26. 1.
Scarlet and Purple. Iacinct is a flower, that we call a Uiolet, and it is also
a precious stone of the color thereoff. But here it is only taken for the
color of Iacinct, of which color the Curtains should be off, as before in
the 25. 4. T. M.

JACOB.
How Jacob is here a figure of the church.
IN that that his youngest brother did purchase the inheritance from the
eldest, Genesis 25. 29
was a figure Figure.
of the Church that should be congregated and gathered together of the
Gentiles, the which (the Jews being excluded) increases daily more and more,
receiving the grace of ye gospelby faith, of the which ye Jews through
unbelief, have made themselves unworthy.

What is meant by this word Jacob, and by seeking of his face.
Haec est generatio querentium faciem tuam Jacob. Psalm. 24. 6.
O Jacob this is the generation of them which seek for thy face. This sentence
seems to be strange, and much disonant from the vain of holy Scripture, to
say, O Jacob, this is the generation of them that seek for thy face. For it
is well known that Jacob Jacobs face.
was a mortal man, begotten of Rebcca by Isaac his natural father. Wherefore
to call them blessed that seek for the face of Jacob, albeit he was an holy
man and a worthy Patriarch, it is a ready way to set up invocation and
pra^eng to the dead Saints, which is not a true serving of God, but an horrible
blaspheming of God, and a plain robbing of him of his glory, which he has
never granted to any creature, but has evermore since the beginning of the
world commanded all invocation, all prayers, all supplications, all hope and
confidence of help, either bodily or Ghostly, to be put wholly and only
in him, the only fountain of life, grace, goodness, health, or plenty, and
whatsoever we have. Therefore it seems to be a dangerous sentence to say: O
Jacob, this is the generation of them that seek thy face. To the utter
avoiding of this inconvenience: ye must note, y^ by this word Jacob is not
understood y^ person of Jacob the Patriarch, which was the son of Isaac, ^
brother to Esau, but by this word Jacob the Scripture does customablie
understand the whole family, the whole household and the congregation of Gods
people, which in their manners and livings do follow the steps of Jacob,
which according to his name, was a mighty wrastler, against all worldly ways,
and lewd lusts of the flesh. To prove that this word Jacob, does signify all
the whole people of God, we have to witness (beside the words of the Prophet,
in diverse places of y^ Psalm, the manifest words of the Prophet Esa. 44. 1.
Audi Jacob seruus meus, and Israel quem elegi, etc. Hearken O Jacob my
servant, and O Israel whom I have chosen, thus says the Lord, thy fashioner
and ^ormer, thy helper and protector from the womb of thy mother, I will pour
my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thy stock: so that this man
shall say: I am the Lords, and another shall call in the name of Jacob.
Certain it is that these words were spoken many hundred years after Jacob the
Patriarch was departed out of this life. So that the Prophet here by the name
of Jacob and Israel (which was all one man) understands all the Congregation
of Gods people, whom he bids to be of a good cheer, and in the Lord to
joy in this life, for upon all the seed of Jacob, that is, upon all faithful
people, that do follow the fashion of Jacob, in faith and pureness of life, god
promises to pour upon them and their seed his holy spirit, so that this man
in this corner shall say, I am the Lords, and another man in another corner
shall call on the name of Jacob, that is, in the name of the same God, that
Jacob called on, which is the father of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is enough
to teach, that by this one word Jacob, is understood all the faithful flock
and people of God, which do seek the face of Jacob, when they do follow the
steps of Jacob in good living. Ric. Turnar.

Of Jacobs lie to his father.
And Jacob said to his father, Genesis 27. 19
I am Esau thy first begotten son, Jacobs lie
etc. Although Jacob was assured of this blessing by faith, yet he did evil to
seek it by lies, and the more he abuses Gods name thereunto. Geneua.

This subtle dealing of Rebecca and Jacob with Isaac considered by it self,
is altogethers blameworthy, but if it be referred to the will of God, and
setting forth of his decree, it is commendable. The Bible note.

Some to excuse Jacobs lie, says thus: Though Jacob was not the person of
Esau, yet in office and dignity he was, because he had obtained the
birthright. So does Christ say, that John was Helias, because he came in y^
person and spirit of Helias. Lyra

Of Jacobs wrastlyng with the Angel.
When Jacob was afraid of his brother Esau, Gen 32. 24
and had prayed to God he would deliver him out of his hands: God to comfort
Jacob and to declare unto him, that he should not fear his brother Esau,
caused an Angel in the likeness of a man to wrestle with him, till it was
day, and could not prevail against Jacob, Jacobs vvrastling^
till he exercised a point above man's strength, which was, that he smote Jacob
under the thigh, wherewith the sinow of Jacobs leg shranke. Then said Jacob, I
will not let go my hold, until thou bless me. What is the name said the
Angel? Jacob said he: Well said the Angel, thou shall be called Jacob no
more, but thy name shall be Israel, that is by interpretation, a man that sees.
And because thou have wrastled with me, which does represent the person of God
and have prevailed, fear not, but thou shall prevail against men. By this
mystical wrestling he was ascertained that he should overcome his brother Esau.
As evermore at length, the good men shall overcome the bad. R. Turn.

What the seed of Jacob is.
All men that do wrestle and fight manfully against the flesh, Esaias. 44. 3
the world and the devil, shall at length of Jacobs Jacobs seed.
wrastlers, be made Israelites, that is the perfect seers of God in joy and
bliss everlasting with Jacob. All such spiritual wrastlers because they follow
the steps of Jacob, otherwise named Israel, are called Semen Israel, the seed
of Israel. Turnar.

How God beholds no sin in Jacob.
He beheld no wickedness in Jacob, Nu. 23. 23
nor saw Idolatry in Israel. No sin in Jacob.
There is no people without sin, neither yet Israel, but God looks not on
it, he waxes not angry in the end, he auengeth it not, according as it
deserves, but amendeth it by his grace. T. M.

Of the finding of Jacob in Bethel.
Look Bethel.

The understanding of this place following.
The name of the God of Jacob defend thee. Psalm. 20. ^
By the God of Jacob God of Jacob.
or Israel, is understood the God of the whole stock, progeny and offspring of
Jacob or Israel, and farther, of all the people of the Lord, as in Esaias. 44. 1.
The cause why, is, that Jacob which as ye read Genesis 35. 10. was after called
Israel, was father to the twelve patriarks, of whom the twelve tribes, and the
whole people of Israel descended. T. M.

I AM.
The meaning of this place following.
I Am that I am, or I will be that I will be. Exo. 3. 14.
I will be that I will be, I am, as some do interpret it, which is, I am the
beginning and ending, by me have ye all things, and without me have ye nothing
that good is. John. 1. 3. T. M.

I am that I am. The God that ever has been, am, and shall be^ the God
almighty by whom all things have their being, and the God of mercy,
mindful of my promise. Apoc. 1. 4.

JAMES.
Why he was called the Lords brother.
James the Lords brother. Gal. 1. 20.
He was called the Lords brother for kindred sake, for he was borne of Marie and
Cleophe, who was sister to Christ's mother. D. Heines.

Of the death of this James.
Clement says that he was cast down from the pinnacle of the Temple, and being
smitten with ye instrument of a Fuller was slain. Book of Mar. fo. 53.

Of the death of James, the brother of John.
This James (says Clement) when he was brought to the tribunal seat, Hist.
Ecle. li. 2. cap. 9.
he y^ brought him (and was the cause of his trouble) seeing him to be
condemned, and that he should suffer death: as he went to execution, A notable
conversion of a wicked accuser, and after a martyr.
he being moved therewith in heart and conscience, confessed himself also of
his own accord to be a Christian. And so were they both lead forth together,
where in the way he desired of James to forgive him that he had done.

After that James had a little paused with him upon the matter, turning to him:
Peace (says he) ^e to thee brother and kissed him, and both were beheaded
together. Anno Dommi. 36. Boo. of Mar. fol. 52. And Eusebius. fol. 23.

IANNES AND IAMBRES.
What manner of men these two were.
THese were two of Pharaos Priests which resisted Moses, Exo. 7. 11.
but their names be not expressed in the 7. chapter of Exodus but only in the
second Epistle to Timothy. 3. chap. verse. 8. Book of Mar.

Then Pharao called also for the wise men and Sorcerers. It seems that these
were Iannes and Iambres. Read. 2. Tim. 3. 8. So that the wicked maliciously
resist the truth of God. Geneua.

JASPER.
The description of this stone, and what it betokens.
THe first foundation was a Jasper. Apo. 21. 19
The Jasper stone is set first in Gods foundation, because it is of this
nature: It is of color green, and he that bears it about him fears no
spirits. This stone betokens them, that always hold fast the faith of God,
and never shrink from it, neither fear the deceits of the Devil, who
notwithstanding go^th about like a rearing Lion, seeking whom he may devour. ^.
Pet. 5. 8. And this virtue is contained, in the first Article of the Christen
belief, where it is said: I believe in God the father almighty. And this
Article, (or namely that this God the Creator of heaven and earth is only to
be worshipped and professed, yea, and that incorruptly and faithfully) was
figured in Judah the chief of the 12. Patriarchs, which name signifies
confessing or acknowledging. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 299.

In that the first foundation is said here to be of a Jasper or Diamond (whose
color is green) is signified, that the faith of the first Fathers is not yet
withered away. Still unto this present day is the example of Enos orient,
fresh and lively, which (...)alled upon the name of God, and of many such other
mo. Still persevere they green, in the holy Scripture and fades not. I have
earnestly prayed for thee Peter (says Christ) that thy faith fail not. Bale.

IDLENESS.
How Idleness is the Image of death.
THey which live idlye, are not worthy to be sacrificed unto God, for Idleness
seems to be a participation of death.

Therefore Seneca when he passed through the ground longing to one called Vatia
a man full of idleness, and given to pleasures: Here (said he) lies Vatia,
signifieng thereby that such may seem not only to be dead, but also to be
buried, etc. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 412.

Against idle Colligeners.
Saint Paul's rule is, that he which labors not, ought not to eat. And
Saint Austen in his Book entitled, De opere Monichorum, cries out against
idle Colligeners.

IDOL.
What an Idol is.
AN Idol is, every form or shape when men have invented unto themselves to
signify or express God. And as there are found many and sundry matters of
these forms: so also, are there diverse kinds of Idols. Wherefore, whether
they be stones, wood or mettalls, by which God is outwardly expressed there to
be worshipped, these are gross and most manifest Idols. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic.
fol. 68.

What the word (Idol) signifies in this place.
The eating of things sacrificed to Idols. 1. Cor. 8. 4.
This word Idol in this place is taken for an Image, which is made to
represent some Godhead, that worship might be given unto it, whereupon came
the word (Idolatry) that is to say, Image service. Beza.

What difference is between an Idol and an Image.
Saint Hierom does make no difference between an Idol and an Image, insomuch
that wheresoever the 70. Interpreters have this word Idolum, (Idol) he does
translate it by Simulachrum (Image). Now if the Papists will not have their
Images lykened unto the Images of the Gentiles, then they must prove their
Images, not to be the works of men's hands, and that they can speak, see,
hear, smell, feel and walk, and that they can bring forth a voice through
their throat, or else if they cannot, it must needs follow, that the Images
of the Idolatrous Christians, and of the Gentiles, be all one. I. Veron in his
book against Images.

How an Idol is nothing, the meaning thereof.
Theophilactus does expound and set forth the occasion of this place on this
manner. There were some (says he) perfect among the Corinthians which were of
opinion, that man could not be defiled with any thing y^ went into the body,
and which did understand undoubtedly, and know that Idols are made of wood and
stone, and that they can hurt no man, and therefore going indifferently to the
Temples and Altars of such Idols, they did greedely eat of the things that
were offered unto Idols.

When they of a weaker faith see this, some of them went with the rest unto the
Idols Temple, and did eat with them of the things that were offered unto the
Idols: but not with a like mind and opinion, as they which believed the
Idols to be unworthy to whom any Sacrifice should be offered. This their
doing did move Paul to be angry: And why not? for it hurt them both
meruailously. It hurted them that were more perfect, because it made them
pertakers of the Devils bread. It hurted them that were less perfect, because
it moved them to Idolatry. Paul therefore goes about to remedy this evil,
and so omitting or leaving them (as many times he is wont to do) that were
of less perfection, he speaks unto them that were more perfect, and does
most chiefly repress and beat down that vain pride which they had
conceived of their human knowledge and science. So much does Theophilactus
write of this place.

Saint Paul does handle the whole matter after this sort. First in the
beginning, he does with a godly Exordium touch the arrogancy of the false
Apostles, teaching that any manner of knowledge be it never so excellent, if it
be not moderated and ruled by charity, is not only unprofitable, but also
most pernicious and hurtful.

Afterward he does reuerse the arguments and objections of the adversaries,
which he answers by and by. This his saying: We know that an Idol is
nothing in the world, does pertain to the declaration of the Adversaries
Argument. For they that gloried in their knowledge, went about to prove that
it was lawful for any manne to eat^ of those things that were offered unto
Idols after this manner. The Gods of the Gentiles are nothing: therefore their
Images and Sacrifices are nothing also: which argument they proved thus. There
is but one only God, whatsoever is then spoken of the Gods, are but vain and
false. The conclusion is proved after this sort: the Idol or Image does
represent him, whose Image it is, but it is most evident and plain, that the
Gods are nothing, whereupon it must also follow, that their Idols are nothing,
his meaning is not, that the Idols which be in the world be nothing at all,
for they are wood and stone, but they be of no value, force or strength. Now
Paul's adversaries taking an occasion of this, reasoned on this wise: Since that
it is most certain, that Idols are vain, it is evident and plain, that the
worshipping of them is vain also. If it be vain, and the godly which confess
do believe it to be vain: the godly may without scrupulositie of conscience,
be present at the sacrifices of the Gentiles, and sit with them at their feasts
and bankets, which they do keep in the honor of their Idols. For the mind
being restored unto it self, do honor and worship the true living God alone,
therefore it conte^ueth Idols, and cannot since it is purified by says, be
polluted or defiled with those things y^ be offered unto the^, Unto all these,
Paul makes this answer: Although thou do believe there is but one God,
and do therefore understand that both the Idols, the worshipping of them, and
the sacrices offered unto them are but mere vanity, yet all men do not so
much, neither do they come to the sacrifices with ye same conscience. He that
is weak and has not yet put away his old inueterate error, which he had
sucked of his forefathers does with a conscience sit at such meats, and
according to his old superstition, which he has not full shaken off, does
fear and dread those Gods. Specially when he sees thee, whom he takes to be
of a sound judgment, to sit at such profane meats, for he does suspect, that
thou do eat with none other conscience then he does, and so he is not
smally offended with thy bold example. Both Saint Ambrose, Theophilactus and
also Erasmus do allow this exposition.

Now if ye will apply this to our Images, ye shall find nothing that does
more strongly impugn them, for although, he which is of strong faith, knows
the Image to be nothing, yet another which has a weaker faith, will not so
judge, but as long as he shall see them thus to stand in Churches, he will
reason thus with himself: Idolatry is not so damnable as y^ preachers do say
it is, since that they are kept in the Church, and are tolerable, and borne
withal of some learned men. So they that from their cradell have been nouseled
in superstition, and have been persuaded that there is some holiness in the
Images, are kept still in error, and can never come to a perfect and pure
faith: therefore it is a most wise point to put down all Images, since it is
against all reason, that a thing of naught should stand in the house of God,
in the place of prayer, and thereby had in reverence.

The meaning of this place of Jeremy.
The Gods that has not made heaven and earth, Ier. 10. 11
shall perish, etc. This declares that all that has been in that chapter
spoken of Idols, was to arm the Jews, when they should be in Chaldea among
the Idolaters. And now with one sentence he instructs them, both how to
protest their own religion against the Idolaters, and how to answer them to
their shame, which should exhort them to Idolatry, and therefore he writes
this sentence in the Chaldeans tongue, for a memorial. Whereas all the rest of
his writing is in Hebrew. Geneua.

When an Idol is known to be an Idol.
The Idol is not known to be an Idol, so long as it is with the workman.
Dan. 3. 2.
But when the ceremonies and customs are recited and used, and the consent of
the people is there, then of a block they think they have made a God. As was
seen, at the dedication of the Image, which Nabuchodonosor set up. Geneua.

IDOLATRY.
What Idolatry is, and how it is defined.
Idolatry is none other thing, Apoc. 21. ^
then to believe a visible Ceremony, is a service to the invisible God, whose
service is spiritual, as he is a spirit. Tindale. fol. 443.

Who be Idolaters.
Idolaters. That is to say, which prefer any thing before the love of God, or
which presume to worship God with any supersticious service, not warranted by
his word. For thus says the Lord: Whatsoever I command you, that take you
heed unto, that ye do it. To this thou shall add nothing, from this thou
shall take nothing. Deuteronomy. 12. 32. And Paul writes of Idolatry in this wise:
Who, when they knew God, glorified him not as God, nor were thankful, but
fell to fondenesse in their own imaginations. Romans 1. 21. Marl. upon the Apoc.
fol. 290.

When Idolatry first began.
Nimroth which was the fourth from Noe, was the first inuenter of Idolatry.
For as Orotius writes, after that Nimroth had been long from Babylon, and
returned thither again, he found it replenished with ye people of the Chaldes,
who being glad of his return, made him their king. Then he finding falt,
because they had no God to make Sacrifice unto, caused a flaming fire to be
made, and commanded that whosoever would not worship that fire, should be
brent therein. And none disobeied him but Abraham and his brother Aram. Which
two Nimroth threw into the fire: but God preserved Abraham. Lanquet.

Abraham and Lot departed out of Chaldea into Mesopotamia, because they would
not be stained with the wicked superstition of the Chaldes, for whereas in the
Sacrifice of the godly, fire came down from heaven and kindeled the Oblations,
the wicked kindeled a fire, and set up a new Gods service of their own
invention, which fire afterward was called holy fire, and had in such
estimation, that Kings caused it to be carried before the^ upon an horse. And
of this fire began the first occasion of Idolatry, before Images were used. And
this Idolatry in scripture, is called Vr Chaldeorum, that is, the fire of
Chaldei. Lanquet.

What the head of Idolatry is.
The head of all Idolatry, is to trust in a particular and in a forged
worshipping of God, excogitated of his own head, and in the mean season to
doubt in tribulations, whether God will be favorable. This doubt I say, is the
principal part of Idolatry. And the ungodly which nevertheless esteems
himself good and wise, does in this point, much differ from the true Christian
and godly. Carrion. fol. 23.

How Idolatry is punished.
So God delivered them up, unto a lewd mind, etc. Romans 1. 28
Here we may learn how God does punish always Idolatry. He gives up
Idolaters unto the lust of their own hearts, and suffers them according to
his righteous and unsearchable judgments, to work all mischief to their
utter destruction and undoing. Sir. I. Cheek.

How Idolatrous things may be converted to the honor of God.
When Temples, Idols, Groves, and such like things by authority be
overthrown, although it is manifest when we do that, we honor them not, but
detest them: yet for all that, we may not therefore covet them or use them to
our own private uses only and commodity, that it may appear that we destroy
them for Religion sake, and not for covetousness. But when they are converted,
not into private and our own use, but into common uses, or into the honor of
the true God, that is done and brought to pass in them, which is done and
brought to pass in men themselves, when of Idolaters and wicked persons, they
are changed into true Religion. This has God him self taught in those
testimonies, which thou thy self have used, when as God himself commanded,
that of that same Grove, which was dedicate to strange Gods, there should be
woo^e taken for his sacrifice. And of Hierico, that all the gold, and silver,
and brass, should be brought into the Treasury of the Lord.

Wherefore, that also which is written in Deutronomy^ Thou shall not covet
their silver nor their gold, neither shall thou take any thing thereof to thy
self, least thou offend, because it is abomination unto the Lord thy God,
etc. It manifestly appears, that either private uses is forbidden in such
things, or that nothing should be brought into thy house to be honored, for
then it is abomination. I. Whitegift. fol. 272.

JEHOVAH.
What Jehovah is.
Jehovah is Gods name, neither is any creature so called, and it is as much to
say, as one that is of himself, and depends of nothing. Moreover, as often
as thou see Lord in great letters (except there be any error in the
printing) it is in Hebrew Jehovah, thou that art, or he that is. Tindale. fol.
6.

How the Hebrews do speak of the name Iehoua.
Rabbi Moses an Egyptian, in the Hebrew called More, says thus: All the names
of the Creator that be found in all books, be derived of effects, saving that
name only Jehovah. And it is a name appropriate unto the most high Creator.
And therefore it is called an express name. He means (says Musculus) that
there is signified and showed thereby, the substance of the Creator, and that
there is nothing in it common unto God and creatures. But the rest of his names
have some double or mingled signification, because they come of works like
unto them, which be derived in us. Thus the Hebrews, do speak of the name of
God, Jehovah. Muscu. fol. 367.

JERUSALEM.
The meaning of this place following.
WHen ye see Jerusalem bes^eged with an Host. Luk 21. 20
The same is that Matthew and Mark do call the Abomination of desolation. The
Host of the Romans is called here desolation, because that by them the City
and Temple were destroyed, and the Country made wast. And they are also called
Abomination both for their heathenish impiety, and also for the putting down
of the true worshipping and Religion. By the holy place, both Jerusalem and the
Temple is understood. Daniel. 9. 26.

How Jerusalem was called holy.
Where many hundred thousands of men are, there are scarcely seven thousand
which know God or believe in God, and yet for their sakes, the whole multitude
is called godly people. Even so was it in Jerusalem. Albeit the greater part
were wicked and godless, yet was Jerusalem called holy, not only in respect
of a small number of the godly, but also because GOD had his abiding there. So
when there was not one just person in Sodom, but Lot with his two
Daughters, yet could not the Angel destroy Sodom with fire, so long as Lot
was in it. Likewise, where four or five or ten godly persons are to be found,
for their sakes the whole city is called holy. Luther upon the Psalm. fol. 88.

JESUS.
Of the mystical and hid signification of this name.
Jesus the son of God, and of the most pure Uirgin Marie, although in the
common translation of the Bible in Latin, it seems there were diverse other
Jews so named. Yet in the Hebrew tongue, as Rencl^ne writes in his book, De
verbo mirifico. There was some diversity in the letters of the name of our
Savior, from them, that were in the other called Jesus. For in his glorious
and wonderful name, were the vowels called Tetragrammaton, with one consonant
called ( Schin) which is one. S. of the Hebrews, wherein was a mystical or
hid signification of his divinity, although the whole name be interpreted
Savior: who being equal in divinity with God the Father, begotten of him
before the world was created, and without time, willingly for the redemption
of man, descended into the blessed body of the Uirgin Marie, and was conceived
in her by the holy Ghost, the third person in Godhead. And of her borne
y^.3962. year after the creation of the world. And being God and man lived
here. 32. years in form of poverty, and than being betrayed of his own
Disciple, was by the Jews (his own people) most cruelly nailed on the
Cross, the year after the creation of the world. 3994. Eliote.

What is meant by that, that Jesus was seen alone with Moses and Helias.
And saw no man more then Jesus only with them. In this that Jesus after the
departing of Moses and Helias is seen alone, it is to be noted, that the law
being by Christ's death removed, and the prophesies fulfilled, we ought only
to have respect unto Christ the only begotten son of God, our savior and
redeemer. Sir. I. Cheek.

What is meant by Jesus sleeping in the Ship.
And he was in the stern a sleep on a pillowe. Mar. 4. 3^
It is said that the Lord sleeps, when in the troubles and adversities of
this world, he deferreth to hear and succor his elect and chosen, which
thing was here prefigured by Jesus sleeping. Sir. I. Cheek.

Christ leaves us oftentimes to our selves, both as well that we may learn
to know our weakness, as his mighty power. Geneua.

What is meant by Jesus groaning in the spirit.
And he groned in the spirit. Whereas Saint John says, Ioh. ^1. 33.
Jesus groned in the spirit, he means that he was so moved in the vowells of
mercy, that for the time he could not speak. This motion always goes before
tears in such as are vehemently affected. Ge. 43. 30.
For the like also we read of Joseph, who being moved with compassion toward
his brethren, sought where to weep. Marl. upon John. fol. 414.

JEWS.
Of whom they took their name.
THere was great lamentation among the Jews. The Jews were first called
Hebrews of Heber, the eldest son of Selah, son of A^phaxat, as it
appears. Genesis 11. 14. 1. Par. 1. 18. After were they called Israel of Jacob,
and after Jews of one of the sons of Jacob, that is to wit, of Judah. T. M.

Of the misery that happened to the Jews.
Look in these words. Fishers. Selum.

Why the Jews were suffered to swear by the name of God.
In the old law, the Jews in an earnest, just or weighty cause, were
permitted to swear in the name of GOD, but not by all manner creatures, least
they dwelling among the Heathen, and accustoming their oaths should by
continuance of time, fall unto the filthy worshippinge of their Idolles,
forgetting God. Swear by his name ( says Moses) and see that ye walk not
after strange Gods of the nations that you remain among. See that ye neither
make mention (says Joshua) nor yet swear by the name of their Gods. Thus in
the old law were they suffered to swear in an earnest, just and weighty
cause. But now after the rule of Christ, be the matter never so true, we may
not of our own selves nor by our own authority and private power, swear or
promise any manner of thing, etc.

What the principal causes be that stop the Jews from Christianity.
I read in the persecution of Scotland, of one George Wisehart a Gentleman
and Martyr, of a certain story, which he resiteth on this wise. I once (says
he) chanced to meet with a Jew, when I was sailinge upon the water of Rhene,
I did enquire of him what was the cause of his partinacye that he did not
believe that the true Messiah was come, consideringe that they had seen all
the prophesies which were spoken of him to be fulfilled. Moreover, the
prophesies taken away, and the Scepter of Judah, by many other testimonies of
the Scripture, I vanquished him that Messiah was come, the which he called
Jesus of Nazareth. This Jew answered again unto me, When Messiah comes he
shall restore all things, and he shall not abrogate the law, which was given
to our forefathers, as ye do. For why? we see the poor almost perish
through hunger among you: yet you are not moved with pity toward them: But
among us Jews (though we be poor) there is no beggar found. Secondarilie,
it is forbidden by the Law to feign any kind of Imagrie of things in heaven
above, or in the earth beneath, or in the Sea under the earth, but one God
only to honor: but your Sanctuaryes and Churches are full of them. Thirdlye,
a piece of bread baken upon the Ashes, ye adore and worship, and say, that
it is your God. In the book of Mar. fol. 1446.

Why the Jews were suffered to be diuo^ced.
Look. Diuorcement.

How the Jews were driven out of diverse Realms.
About the year of our Lord. 1179. were many Jews in England, which against
the feast of Easter, did use to Crucify young children in despite of
Christian Relygion.

About the year of our Lord. 1186. They crucified a child in the town of
Bury.

About the year of Christ. 1235. and the 18. year of the reign of king
Henry the third, the Jews dwelling in Norwich, were accused for the stealing
of a child, whom they purposed to crucify.

About the year of our Lord. 1245. and the 28. year of Henry the third, king
of England, at Tollet in Spain, a Jew digging in the ground to enlarge his
vineyard, found a hollow stone, wherein was a book of the bigness of a
Psalter, written in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, the matter whereof was of the
worlds to come. And declared the coming of Christ, to be the beginning of the
third world, which was expressed on this wise. In the beginning of the third
world, the son of God shall be borne of a Uirgin. By occasion of this book
the Jews were turned to the faith of Christ.

About the year of our Lord. 1264. and in the. 47. year of the reign of
Henry the third king of England. 500. Jews were slain by ye Citizens of
London, because one Jew would have forced a christen man, to pay more then two
pence for the usury of xx. s. the week.

About the year of our Lord, 1279. and in the sixth year of the reign of king
Edward the first, king of England. 284. Jews were put to execution, for
clipping of the kings coin.

About the year of our Lord. 1475. at the city of Trident, a child named
Simon was murdered of the Jews of that City, in dirision of the passion of
Christ, for which murder and villainy, the Jews suffered great and worthy
punishment.

In the year of our Lord. 1492. There were driven out of Spain by
commandment of the king. 125. families of the Jews, of the which 30.
thousand died of the pestilence in their iourneie as they were departing.

Of the conversion of the Jews.
Brethren I will not have you to be ignorant of this mystery, Romans 11. 26.
that you be not high minded in your selves, for that the blindness is
happened upon part of the Israelites, until that the fullness of the Gentiles
come in, and so Israel shall be saved. This conversion of the Jews I do
disseuer from those tokens which began to be done a great while a go, and do
pass before the coming of the Lord, and I do apply it unto those signs,
which shall go nearest before it. But how that conversion shall be fulfilled,
and what shall be the point of the fulfilling of the Gentiles, let him define
which is able. We can rather wish it, August ^ quest. Canon. ca. 33
then for a certain define it. Augustine says, that there shall be sometimes
a manifest vocation or calling of the Jews in the salvation of the Gospel,
but how and what time it shall be, he does not express. Musculus. fol. 451.

He shows that the time shall come that the whole nation of the Jews, though
not every one perticularly, shall be joined to the Church of Christ. Geneua.

IGNORAVNCE.
What a pleasure it is to the devil, for a man to be ignorant in the Scripture.
Unto the devil it is a torment above all torments, and a pain above all
pains, Origin in his. 2. book, and. 45. ca.
if they s^e any man readinge the word of GOD and with fervent study
searchinge the knowledge of Gods laws, and the mysteries and secrets of the
Scriptures. Herein stands all the flame of the devils, in this fire are they
tormented, for they are ceased and possessed of all them that remain in
ignorance.

The reading of the Scriptures is a great fence against sin, Chrisost. in
his 3. ser. of Lazarus.
and the ignorance of the Scriptures, is a dangerous downfall, and a great
dungeon. To know nothing of Gods law, is the loss of salvation. Ignorance
has brought in heresies and vicious life. Ignorance has turned all things
vpside down.

How no man is excused by Ignorance.
Ignorance excuses no man, if thou of ignorance follow a blind guide, Mat.
15. 14
thou shall perish together with him.

The ignorance of Scriptures and the word of God, is the head spring of all
heresies, and perni^ious errors. For why? Without the Scriptures the power of
God connot be known which is Christ. Sir. I. Cheek upon these words of S.
Math.

Ye are deceived understanding not the Scriptures. Mat. 12. 45


Whereunto the mainte^ners of ignorance may be likened.
They be like that Painter that Plutarch speaks of, Similitude.
that had evil fauouredlie proportioned a painted Hen, and therefore chased
away the live hens, least that his evil workmanship should be perceived.
Those chase away Gods word, least their fancy should be discovered.

I WILL.
What is signified by the I Will.
THey that dwell in the Isles shall see, etc. Some read: And he that dwells
in this I Will, etc. Jerusalem and the land of Judah, is justly called an I Will,
because it was beset round about with enemies, and wicked nations, as it had
been with the Seas: and therefore ought it to have trusted to the only help
and aid of God. The Church also is an I Will, that is troubled also with diverse
storms, and that by the only help of God is in safety: for he suffers not
the persecutors to persecute any further, then the Church may suffer, or then
is profitable for it. T. M.

Then shall the inhabitaunts of this I Will say, Esaias. 20. 6
etc. Meaning Judea, which was compassed about with their enemies, as an I Will
with waters. Geneua.

IMAGES.
The beginning of Images.
AVgustine affirms, that the beginning of Images came of the desire which men
bare unto ye dead. For where men took it impatiently, by death to be berest of
them whom they dearly loved, they desired at the least to solace themselves
with the Images of them, which pretense the Devil abused to Idolatry. And by
this means the Images of the elders were kept: and that was counted an honor
unto the dead, and brought some solace or comfort unto their friends. Pet.
Mar. upon the. Romans fol. 30.

How Images are not to be worshipped.
Saint Austen pronounces, that it is unlawful not only to worship Images,
but also to set up Images to God: And yet says he none other thing, but the
same which many years before was decreed by the Elibertine counsel, whereof
this is the. 36. Chapter: It is ordained that no picture be had in the Church,
that the thing which is honored and worshipped, be not painted on the walls.
But most notable is that which is another place Augustine alleges out of
Varro, and confirms it with his own assent, that which first brought in the
Images of Gods, both took away the fear of God, and brought in error.
Calvin in his Insti. 1. b. chap. 11. Sect. 6.

The counsel of Colen against worshipping of Images.
Verum cum multus etiam abusus, etc. But since much abuse has also by little
and little crept in about the worshipping of Images, that the Images also of
those have been brought into the Church which have no testimony of the
Scripture, or of approved authors: that many carved Images beyond measure with
great sumptuousness and cost, were set up so fast in Churches, as though
herein a great part of godliness consisted, the poor people of Christ being
in the mean while neglected, which are the lively Images of Christ.
Furthermore, y^ we behold the Images so painted and expressed, that they
seemed to be forged, not after the form of christen honesty, but after the
inticements of the vanity of the world. To conclude, that the rude people was
suffered to worship the Images with a certain trust reposed in them, ye
which is not altogether free from Idolatry, so y^ they cannot be excused of
Idolatry, y^ have chosen to themselves any Image to be worshipped, and that
either for the fayrenesse thereof, or the foulness, or the necessity, or the
oldnesse, believing y^ Image to have some virtue, yea, or some Godhead, or
divinity more then the rest, which error is to be plainly denounced. I.
Bridges. fol. 479.

Whereas almighty God says, Exo. 20. 4.
Thou shall make thee no Image that thou may worship it, is as much to say,
as thou shall make thee no Image, least at any time thou may chance to
worship it.

Godly honor and reverent behavior is forbidden to be given to Images.
To whatsoever Image or likeness ye godly honor is forbidden to be given,
reverent behavior is forbidden to be given to the same. For almighty God in
these words forbids both godly honor and reverent behavior to be given to
Images: Non incuruabis te eis, Exo. 20. 5.
neque coals eas. Thou shall neither ^ow thy self to the^ neither give godly
worship unto them. I. Veron.

How Images were worshipped through Ignorance. Objection.
The people be not so dull headed to worship the dumb Image, and not rather
the things that are signified and represented by them.

Answer.
Where as ye say that men are not so dull headed that they will worship dumb
Images, the experience has taught us the contrary. For about a thousand
years ago, the people did through ignorance of the law of God, and the
negligence of Bishops, begin to worship dumb Images, Images broken 1000.
years ago.
and for a witness, Serenus Bishop of Massila, did in his City, break down
the Image of Christ, and the Images of Saints, because he saw them to be
worshipped of the people. And that the people did worship the very Image,
this is plain: that they having the Roode and the Image of the Uirgin Marie,
at home in their own Churches, yet would they go a gadding, to our Lady of
Wylsdon, to our Lady of Walsingam, and the holy Roode of Boston? What was
this but a manifest sign and token, that they were wedded to the Images, and
that they thought more holiness in the one then in the other, else would they
have contented themselves with those Images that they had at home in their own
Churches, and spared both cost and labor, which they bestowed upon Idolatrous
Pilgrimages. I. Veron.

Objection.
There is no man so blind, nor so mad or foolish, for to honor the stock and
stone that stands before him, but he refers the honor to the thing that
the Image does represent.

Answer.
What did Cicero Cicero.
with all the Senators of Rome, did they not honor that same thing that stood
before them, and yet as you say, they did refer it unto the thing, that was
thereby represented. These men were wise men, and as well learned in their time
as any was, yet for lack of knowledge of the truth, they honored stocks and
stones. No man can say but that they did Idolatry, yea, and that because they
did honor the stocks and stones, and not all only for honoring of the thing
that was represented. Also what did Jeroboam, when he did set up the golden
Calves in Bethel, Ieroboams calse.
and said to the people, Go no more to Jerusalem, behold thy Gods Israel.
Was not this done to the honor of God? For they were not so mad to think that
those Calves were Gods, but they did honor them in the honor of God, and that
was well declared in their sacrifice, which was none other, but such as God had
commanded in the law, Ergo after your rule they might lawfully honor those
calves, referring it to God. They had also a greater color for them, for all
the old Fathers did always offer unto God calves, as Abraham with many other,
which oblation was accepted of God, wherefore they might well think that God
would be honored in the Images of Calves. D. Barnes.

We do honor (says S. Clement) Clement li 5. ad Iaco.
visible Images, to the honor of the inuisi^le God, ye which is a false thing.
But if you will honor the Image of God in doing well to man, in him shall you
honor the true Image of God. We will open y^ thing unto you which is of truth.
So that you must do well unto man, ye which is made unto the Image of God, give
him honor and reverence: give him meat when he is hungry, give him drink
when he is a thirst, cloth him when he is naked, serve him when he is sick,
give him lodging when he is a stranger, and when he is in prison, minister
unto his necessities, this is the thing that shall be counted to be given God
truly. What honor is this of God, to run about foolishly to stony and
woodie Images, and to honor as Gods Idols and dead figures, and to despise
man, in whom is the very true Image of God. Wherefore vnderstane you, that
this is the suggestion of the Serpent that lurketh within thee, which does make
you believe, that you be not wicked, when you hurt sensible and reasonable
men, etc.

Also the same Doctor says (in the same book) What thing is so wicked and so
unthankful, as to receive a benefit of God, and to give thank to stocks and
stones, wherefore awake and understand your health.

We are unthankful unto God, Aug de vera religione ca. vlti.
of whom we have received all things, and for them give thanks to the worm
eaten Gods. D. Barnes.

Look in the word Latria.

Let us not le^^ any visible spectacles, least by erring from the verity and
by loving shadows, we be brought into darkness. Let us have no devotion to
our fantasies. It is better to have a true thing whatsoever it be, then all
manner of things that may be fained at our own pleasure, etc. Images are but
visible spectacles and shadows. D. Barnes.

To worship Images is heresy.
Saint Austen in his Catalogue, wherein he rehearses all the heresies of his
time, reckons among them, one Marcella, a woman of Capadocia, which
worshipped the Images of Jesus Christ, Marcella.
of Paul, of Pithagoras, and of Homer, with making of adoration and incensing
of them. I. Old.

No religion where Images be used.
There is no doubt (says Lactantius, Li. 2. ca. 19
Constantinus Shoolmaster) but there is no religion whersoeuer an Image is. I.
Old.

How Images are the teachers of Iyes, and not lay men's books.
Damascene does teach in his fourth book de Orthodoxa fide, and also Gregory
the great in his Registers or book of Epistles.10. chap. and 4. Epistle, Lay
men's books.
that Images be lay men's books, and godly means to stir up the hearts of
the people to devotion.

Answer.
The Prophet Abacuc Abac. 2. 18
says: What profits the Image, for the maker thereof has made it an Image,
and a teacher of lies, Teacher of lies.
whereby it follows that the Images are the books of lies, and that they
came of him who is a liar from the beginning, as the Father of lies. How well
then are the simple and ignorant people, for whom our Savior Christ did
vouchsafe to shed his dear heart blood, provided for, when such books are
delivered unto them, in steed of the living preaching of Gods word. It is not
for naught that Jeremy does cry out: They altogether doat and are foolish,
Doctrine of vanity
for the stock is a doctrine of vanity. Meaning that nothing more displeases
GOD, nor brings men into greater error and ignorance of God, then Images
do, wherefore he calls them the doctrine of vanity, and the work of
error, Work of error.
as Abacu^ calls them the teacher of lies, who in the same Chapter thundreth
out against the wicked opinion of them, ye calls them the books of the lay
people on this manner, Woe unto him that says unto the wood, awake, and to the
dombe stone, arise up: should the same teach? Should, the same be laid over
with gold and silver, and there is no breath in it, but ye Lord is in his holy
temple. As if he should say: there is no breath, no life, nor moving in the
Image, how should they teach then. Therefore it is more vanity and fondness to
set forth Images unto the people for their teachers and schoolemaisters, since
y^ the living God who is the true teacher, is in ye midst of the temple, that
is in the hharts of ye faithful, teaching those things, that are both
profitable the everlasting: whereunto may be added the saying of Saint Paul:
What agreement has the temple of GOD with Images, but ye are the Temple of the
living God who lives and works in you. More credit ought to be given to the
testimonies of the Scriptures, as of the Prophets and the Apostles, then to the
vain gloses of all Gregory's or Damascenes in the world. Iere. 10. 8.
I. Veron.

But altogether they doat and are foolish, for the stock is a doctrine of
vanity. Because the people thought, that to have Images was a mean to serve
GOD, and to bring them to the knowledge of him, he shows that nothing more
displeases God, nor brings men into greater errors and ignorance of GOD:
And therefore he calls them the doctrine of vanity, the word of errors.
ver. 15. and Abacuc. 2. ver.18. calls them the teacher of lies, contrary to
that wicked opinion, that they are the books of the lay people. Geneua.

How Images move weak hearts to Idolatry.
S. Austen in his Epistle to one called Deo gracias, writes in this manner:
Who does doubt but that Idolles and Images are without all sense of feeling,
Set up in high places.
but when they are set up in high and honorable places, that they may be
beholden of them that do either pray, or offer, they do with the similitude
or likeness of liu^lye and sensibles, although they be both insensible and
without life, move the weak minds, so that they seem to be alive and to
have breath. Here we see to be attributed unto Images, that with the
likeness of lively members, they do move weak hearts. And therefore they are
perillousiye set forth unto them, whose books they are thought to be, and
specially if they be put in high and honorable places, where prayer and
common exercise of religion is used. I. Veron.

That they should come to the dedication of the Image. Dan^. 3. 2


Showing that the Idol is not known for an Idol, so long as he is with the
workman: but when ceremonies and customs are recited and used, and the consent
of the people is there, then of a block they think they have made a God.

When Images were taken out of Churches.
About the year of our Lord. 726. Leo the Emperor commanded, Leo Em. Images
taken out of Churches.
that all that were under the Empire, should tak^ away the Images and pictures
of Saints out of Churches, for avoiding Idolatry. But the Pope did resis^ the
Emperor, and wrote into all parts of the world, that neither for fear nor
entreaty, they should obey the Emperors commandment in this behalf, and
with so vehement persuasions withdrewe the people of Italy from the obdience of
their Emperor Leo, that they would have chosen them a new Emperor.

He also in the year of Christ. 728. commanded all Images to be taken out of
the Churches of Constantinople, and to be burned and put to death them that
would not obey.

About the year of our Lord. 747. Constantine Constantine Em.
the Emperor, did persecute them which worshipped Images.

When we were going (says Epiphanius Epiphanius.
) to the holy place which is called Bethel, there to celebrate the Communion
with them, according to the Ecclesiastical manner, and was come to the farm
place called Anablatha, and did see there passing by a light burning, and did
ask what the place was, and had learned that it was a Church, and had gone
for to pray, there I found as it were a vale dyed or painted, and having the
Image as it were of Christ or of some Saint, for I do not well remember whose
Image it was. Therefore when I did see the Image of man did hang in the Church,
Image of Christ pulled down
contrary to the Scriptures, I rent it, and did rather give counsel to the
Wardens of the place, that they should wind some poor dead body therein. And a
little after, Bid, I be see^h the, y^ elders of y^ place to receive of the

Epiphanius says: Estote memores, etc. My dear children be ye mindful, y^ ye
bring no Images into the Churches, and that ye erect up none at y^ burial of
Saints. But evermore carry God in your hearts^ ^ay, suffer not Images (...) not
in your private houses. For it is not lawful to lead a Christian man by the
eyes, but rather by study and exercise of ye mind. For this cause Epiphanius
says: The superstition of Images, is unfit for the Church of Christ. Jewel.
fol. 505.

How God cannot be presented by no manner or similitude or Image.
Whose is this Image and superscription. Mar. (...). 16
Tho Image (...) God is not in the gold, but in the man, therefore gold and
silver, with other riches, ought to be paid unto Caesar. But our consciences
and souls, ought to be kept clean unto the Lord our God. Sir. I. Cheek.

Let them tell me (I pray them) how God does answer or is known by such
things. Athanas. in. li. con. Gent.
Is it by the matter or stuff that is about them, and whereof they be made, or
by the form or shape that is given them? If it be of the stuff, what need is
there of the form or shape, and why did not God rather aford they were
fashioned and shapen, appear and manifest himself by the universal stuff.
But if the form or shape that they have received is the knowledge of God, what
need is there of gold or any other stuff? Or why is not God rather revealed
by the true living creatures, whose shapes and ^ormes the Images are, for
truly according to their own reason, the glory of God should better be
known, if God were manifested or revealed, rather by the living and reasonable
creatures, then by the vnliuing and unreasonable.

No caruer or maker of Images was esteemed among the Jews.
Origin in his fourth book against Celsus, Image caruers.
commends the Jews on this wise: Among them (says he) nothing was ever
accounted God, beside him which rules all, nor in their Commonwealth any
caruer of Idols or Image maker was, as whom the law it self drove away from
them, to the intent they should have no occasion to make any Images, which
might pluck certain foolish persons from God, and turn the eyes of their
souls to the contemplation of earthlye things.

Of the harm that comes by Images.
It is written in the book of wisdom, Sap. 14. 10. Harm by Images.
that the creature of God through the use of Images be made temptation to the
souls of men, and a trappe to the feet of the unwise, for as much as the
seeking out of Images is the beginning of whoo^dome, and the finding of them,
is the corruption of man's life. Also in the xv. chapter it is said, that they
lead into error, and that their work is without fruit, and that by their
sight alone, they stir a desire in the foolish.

The Church cannot have Images without ieopardie, for if there were no peril
of Idolatry in having of Images, what needed John to have said, Beware of
Images.

A place of Chrysostom opened.
Chrysostom says, That he that does any injury or villainy to the Image of
Caesar, he does commit the same against Caesar himself. Chrysostom in this
saying, concludes not that therefore we must have Images of God, and of
Christ in the Church, but he that does iniurye to any man that is made after
the Image of God, or disobeyeth a magistrate, which represents the person of
God, etc. He does injury to God, for he that does make an Image of God, does
God great injury, transforming the glory of the invisible God, into the
shape of any corruptible creature. Romans 1. 23.

God has forbidden an Image or an Idol, Tertul. de Idolatria.
as well to be made as to be worshipped, as far as making goes before
worshipping, so far is it before that the thing be not made that may be
worshipped. Some men will say, I make it, but I worship it not: as though he
durst not to worship it for any other cause, but only for the same cause,
for which he ought not to make it. I mean both ways for Gods displeasure,
nay rather thou worshipp^^ the Image that gives the cause for others to
worship it.

Saint Austen is against the Image of the Trinity.
Man was made after the similitude and likeness of God: how? Not in body,
but in soul and mind in the inward man. Wherefore Saint Austen, a man most
expert in Gods word, cries out against the Image of the Trinity, calling
it, Sacrilegium, Image of Trinity.
a staining of Gods honor, and an Idol, because the glory of the immortal
God is changed into the similitude and Image of mortal man, forbidding such
an Image, not only in the Church but also in thought and mind. When Philip
desired Christ to show him the Father, he rebuked him, and answered, He that
sees me sees the Father.

It is sin to set forth to the invisible and unfashionable God an Image of
an old man with an hoar head. For it is forbidden that no Image be made for
God. Deuteronomy. 4. 12. You saw no likeness in that day when the Lord God spoke
to you in Hebrewe. And Esias. 40. 18. says: To whom therefore shall we make
God like? Or what Image shall we set to him. It is a very wicked matter, to
change the glory and majesty of the invisible and incorruptible God, into
the li^enesse of a corruptible man, as we may see in the Epistle to the
Romans. 1. 23. And because they shall not say, that the blame which the
Apostle found was to be understood only of the Gentiles, they shall be
yet stopped with the writing of Saint Austen, who writes thus: We believe
also that he sits at the right hand of God the Father, and yet not so ^
that we must think that God the Father is circumscribed as with the form of
man, that in thinkinge of him we call to mind his right or le^^ side. Or for
that that it is said, the Father sits, we may^ think it do^e with ^^wing
his kn^e, least we fall into that fault of vngodlyn^sse, whereby the Apostle
^urseth them, which change the glory of the incorruptible GOD, into the
ly^^nesse of a corruptible man. For it is not lawful for a Ch^istian man to
set such an Image of God in the Temple, much more wicked it is ^o conceive it
in his heart, where the Temple of God (...) (...) (...)

And of the Image which came down from heaven. Act. 19. 35
They that made Images among the Greeks, to the intent to win the more
advantage there, fained that they were sent from Jupiter forth of Heaven, and
that they were not mortal nor subject to death. Tindale.

Antiquity, and the covetousness of the Priests, brought in this
superstition: for it is written, that the Temple being repaired 7. times, this
Idol was never changed. Plin. lib. 16. 40. By^such illusions, the world is
most easily abused. Gene.

Of the lmage that Nabuchodonosor set up.
Nabuchodonosor made an Image of gold, Dan. 3 ^
etc. Under pretense of religion and holiness in making an Image to his Idol
Bell, he ^ought his own ambition and vainglory. And this declares that he
was not touched with the true fear of God before. But that he confessed him on
a sudden motion, as the wicked when they are overcome with the greatness of
his works. The Greek Interpreters write, that this was done 18. years after
the dream, and as may appear the King feared, least the Jews by their
Religion, should have altered the state of his Commonwealth, and therefore he
meant to bring all into one kind of Religion, and so rather sought his own
quietness, then Gods glory. Geneua.

Of the Image of Provocation.
The Hill Sion was walled about, Eze. 8. 3.
and that Wall which compassed it, was called the outward Wall. About the
Temple was there another wall, that was called the inward wall, which although
it were outward from the Temple, yet was it inward from the wall, which
compassed the Hill. The space between the inward wall, and the Temple, was
called the Inner Court. Therein were many Ports, and in the North Port thereof
was Ezechiel set: for that place was holy, and therein did they use to worship
God. But with the filthiness of this hateful Image of Baal (which the Prophet
here calls, the Image of provocation, because it provoked the Lord to
vengeance) had they defiled it: as superstition does commonly defile, even the
most holiest things, and such as appear most godliest. T. M.

An exposition of this place of Esaias.
The Carpenter (or Image caruer) etc. Esa. 44. 13
Let the Christen here note, how lively the Prophet painteth out the vanity
of Images. For it is to be feared that our superstition concerning such things,
passes and exceeds the superstition of the Jews. Once evident it is, that
the Jews in our time can in no wise be persuaded to become Christian, so long
as we fall down and kneel before Images. Image caruer.
Their answer is, that they and we both (if we be of God) should in no
condition do any thing, that openly and in so many places, be forbidden of
God. The Turks and Saracens also mock us therefore: The honor of God say
they (and truth it is) ought we to seek, and to stick by his word, and
neither to add thereto, neither take away, neither to swerve to the right hand
or to the left, but earnestly to stand by that which is commanded, and forsake
that which is forbidden. God grant us Christians a better trade and
conversation of living, then that we should with our example, be an offense
either to Jew or Saracen, and an occasion to keep them from the faith of
Christ, and give the simple, eyes to see and perceive, the falsehoode of the
suhtill, which for lucre augment their blindness, and exhort them to such
superstition. So be it. T. M.

Of the Images called in Latin, Colosci.
These were Images of horrible greatness, Colosci.
like to towers: one of Apollo in the Capitol at Rome, was 30. Cubits high.
Also at Tarentum, one made by Lysippus, was 40. Cubits high, but at Rhodes one
of the Sun exceeding all other, was in height 70. Cubits, made by Colassis,
Scholar to Lysippus. The thombe of that Image, few men might fathom. It was
in making twelve years, and the charges drew to 300. Talents, which amounts
to 43115. pounds. Strabo writes that the Image was of Jupiter, and made by
Chares Lindius. Besides this, were an hundred less Colosci in Rhodes, and at
Rome were many made of metal. Eliote.

IMBER DAYS.
Why the Imber days were invented.
IN the Did. 76. chap. 1. are added Imber days, or the feasts, four times in
the year, which, why they are so divided, scarcely can any man perceive. They
recite Hierome upon Zachary, who makes mention of the fourth month, fifte,
seventh and tenth. And they seem to be moved with a wicked zeal to
distribute these Feasts into four parts of the year. And these Feasts
which the Jews received every year for the calamities which they had
suffered, the same our men have made yearly. But other have invented another
cause, namely, because in these four times of the year, Bishops are wont to
promote Clearkes unto the ministry and orders. Wherefore they say that the
people ought then most of all to fast and pray, that God would gaunt them good
Pastors, etc. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 276.

IMMORTALITY.
How Immortality properly belongs to God.
THat is immortal properly, which is without beginning, without ending, all
creatures have a beginning, of the which some nevertheless are called
immortal because they have no ending, as the Angels, man's Soul? But only
God is properly immortal, who speaks of himself, I am which is, which was,
which is to come: This belongs to God and to none of his Creatures, and to
none of the works of his fingers: of which some may truly say, that they be,
and are to come, but not that they were, because once they were not. To.
Hutchinson.

From whence the immortality of souls proceed.
It should seem that man is likened to brute Beasts. Yea, and he should be
like them in very deed, if GOD did not put too his hand. For whence comes
the immortality of our souls, but of a special favor that God bears us.
Saint Paul says, That only God is immortal, 1. Tim^. 6. 16.
we then are transitory, we do nothing else but ^ade away: and what are our
souls? Even the very Angels of Heaven, should also be mortal: howbeit,
forasmuch as GOD has breathed his own spirit into them, they must needs
continue in him.

It is he from whence proceeds immortality, (I say) even of the Angels.
And it behooves us also on our parts, to draw out of this same Well,
according as it is said in the Psalm: Psalm. 36. 9
Lord, in thee is the fountain of life, and in thy light shall we be lightened.
Call. upon Job. fol. 228.

IMPATIENCIE.
What Impatiencie is.
IMpatiencie is not simply a grief conceived of the mi^^iking of our
adversities when we be weary of them: but it is an excessive hart-burning
against them, when we cannot submit our selves simply unto God, to dispose of
us at his pleasure. Wherefore if our passions be so vnrulely, as we cannot
keep any measure in our adversities, then does inpatiencie over master us, and
if we have no hold nor stay of our selves, we must needs conclude, that we
are no better then frantike folk against God, yea, and utterly out of our
wits, etc. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 314.

According to the nature of contraries, look what good things be attributed to
Patience, the contrary thereof may aright be ascribed unto Impatiencie.
Patience is a virtue whereby all adversities be borne for godliness and
honesty sake. Therefore Impatiencie is the vice, whereby there is no adversity
suffered, for godliness and honesty sake. Musculus. fol. 528.

IMPOSITION OF HANDS.
Look. Laieng on of hands.

IMPOSSIBILITY.
AS it is impossible for a Camel (or Cable, that is a great rope of a ship)
remaining in the own quantity, Math. 19. 24.
to go through a needles eye (remaining in his own straightness) so is it
like impossible for a rich man, remaining in his own natural pride,
covetousness and corruption, to enter into the kingdom of God. And therefore
when those which heard were offended, as king, And who may then enter into
salvation? Christ answered: Things that are impossible before men, are
possible with God. Mark well, that Christ calls the humiliation of the rich
man, impossible to man, but possible with God. Knox.

As the man of Inde may change his skin, Ier. ^3. 23
and the Cat of the Mountain her spots, so may ye, that be exercised in evil,
do good. Upon these two things to Nature impossible, did the Prophet conclude,
that no more could the Citizens of Jerusalem, being exercised in all iniquity,
leave the same, and so was it impossible. Impossible I say to themselves, and
to their own power. For what the spirit of God works in the conversion of
sinners, ought not to be attributed to man's power. Knox.

For it is impossible, Heb. 6. 4
that they which were once lightened, etc. This is Paul's meaning: They that
do believe truly and unfeignedly, do continue or abide steadfast in the known
truth. If any therefore fall away from Christ, it is a plain token that they
were dissembling hypocrites, and that they never believed truly, as Judas,
Simon Magus, Demas, Hymeneus and Philetus were, which all fell away from the
known verity, and made a mock of Christ, which Paul does call here, to
crucify Christ a new, because that they turning to their old vomit again,
do most blasphemously tread the benefit of Christ's passion under their feet.
They that are such, can in no wise be renewed by repentance, for they are not
of the number of the Elect, as S. John does say: They went from us, but they
were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us
unto the end. If such men do repent, their repentance is as Judas and Cains
repentance was.

This text denies no possiblitie of mercy in God, but the impossibility of
repentance in such men as maliciously forsake the trueh, blaspheame Christ,
and take part against the Holy Ghost. For the truth is, that with the Lord
there is mercy and plenteous redemption. Psalm. 130. 7. So that whosoever
calls upon his name shall be saved Joel. 2. 32. and Romans 10. 13. Now they
that forsake the truth, blaspheming Christ, and taking part against the Holy
Ghost, cannot repent. For if sinners would convert and call upon God, they
should be sure of remission. Tindale.

They which are Apostates, and sin against the Holy Ghost, hate Christ,
crucify and mock him, but to their own destruction, and therefore fall into
desperation, and cannot repent. Heb. 6. 6. Geneua.

IMPVTATION.
What Imputation is.
IMputation is, that benefit of God the Father, whereby he vouchsafes to
account Christ's obedience as ours, in as ample manner as we our selves had
fulfilled the law, and made satisfaction for our sins. T. Beza.

INCEST.
What Incest is.
THey call Incest an unlawful meddling of a man with a woman, against ye honor
of blood and affinity. For Cestus signifies the marriage girdle which ye Bride
did wear, to show that the marriage was just and lawful. We Germans (says
Bullinger) call this sin by y^ name of Bloutschand, whereby we signify y^ sin
committed in corrupting or defiling our own blood or kindred. In Leuiticus,
after the degrees and blood in which we are forbidden to marry, the Lord does
presently add: In all these be ye not defiled: for in all these things are the
Nations defiled which I cast out before you. And hereby the land is defiled,
and I have visited the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land has spued out
the inhabitaunts thereof. Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and mine
ordinances, and shall not do any of all these abominations. For whosoever
shall do so, he shall be cut off from among his people. And in the 20. Chapter
of Leuiticus, he has appointed death to be the punishment of Incest, which is
not changed in the Civil laws or Imperial constitutions. Bullinger. fol. 236.

INFANTS.
How Infants ought not to be pertakers of the Lords Supper.
AS touching Infants, the institution of Christ, does seclude them from the
Supper, because they cannot yet, prove and examine themselves, neither yet
celebrate the remembrance of Christ's death: the which thing the Apostle Paul
teaches to be necessary for all those, which come to the Communion of the
Supper. Marl. upon John. 226.

INFIDELITY.
How Infidelity is the cause of all evil.
LEt there not be in any, Heb. 3. 12
an evil heart of Infidelity. Infidelity is it, which makes thine heart
abound in evil, and if by any means it can get room to lodge within thee,
thy heart is taken, and imagines from hence-foorth all mischief. When our
Savior Christ so many times reprooueth sundry sorts of men, he makes this a
general fault of all; that they are unfaithful and flow to believe. When
Saint Paul condemns them as reprobate men, which do never see the light of
the Gospel: he makes this the cause of their sin, that the God of this
world, has blinded the eyes of their unbelieving hearts, etc. Deering.

IN OMNEM TERRAM. etc.
Look for the exposition of this, in the word. Sound.

INSTRVMENTS.
How they served in the old law.
SIng unto him with Uiole, Psalm. 33. 2.
and instrument of ten strings. To sing of Instruments was a part of the
Ceremonial service of the Temple, which does no more appertain unto us, then
the Sacrifices, Censings and lights. Geneua.

Whereof these Instruments were made in King Salomons time.
Praise the Lord upon the Harp, sing ye Psalms with Lute and Instrument of
ten strings. Concerning these instruments, Harp and Lute, we read oftentimes
in the Scriptures: and specially in the book of Psalms, which instruments
undoubtedly were used in the Temple at Jerusalem in the service of God, and
namely at their singing of Psalms. For the Levites did not sing their Psalms
only with the voice of men and children as we do, but they joined with men's
voices, the sweet harmony of musical instruments, and namely of the Harp,
Lute, Cymbales, and Psalteries, of ten strings. These instruments as Josephus
writes. li. 8. Chap. 3. Solomon ordained quadraginta milia. forty thousand
which were made Ex. electro. 1. of mixture of gold and silver. For Electrum is
gold, whereof the fifth part is silver mingled among the gold: such a mixture
is called Electrum: And of that metal were those instruments which Solomon did
ordeine to be used in the Temple: and were made of fine wood, as our Harpes and
Lutes be, etc. Ric. Turnar.

INTENT.
What the word signifies, and how it is defined
INtent, signifies a motion of the mind, whereby, by some mean, we tend to
an end. As if a man should study by giving of gifts or by services to
attain unto any honor, for the nature of things is of such sort, that many
things are so anexed togethers between themselves, that by the one is made a
step to the other. For by medicines and drinks we atteine to health: By
studies, readings, and teachers, unto wisdom: wherefore an intent is an
action of the will, for it is his office to move and stir up the mind. And
for so much as the will does not perceive the things that he desires, before
that it has the knowledge thereof, it moves not nor forces the mind before
knowledge, which reigns in the power of intelligence or understanding, it
perceives both the end, and those things which serve to the end, and
ministers them unto the will.

Therefore intent stirs up to the end, as to atteine by those things which
unto it are directed. Let this be his definition. A will tending unto the end
by some means, Will, which is his general word, is an act of the power that
wills. The difference is taken of the object, namely of the end, and these
things which are ordained unto it: as now, as touching Gedeon, his intent was
(...) of his will, to keep the memory of the victory given him, Iudie. 3. 27
by the Ephod he had made^ In will therefore he comprehended at once both the
end and the mean, etc. Pet. Mar. upon Iudicum. fol. 152.

Of good intents.
Look before after the word Good.

INTERCESSION.
Look. Saints.

IN THE CHVRCH.
How it is an error to say: I believe in the Church.
SAint Cyprian in his exposition of the Apostles Creed, says: He said not in
y^ holy Church, nor in the remission of sins, nor in the resurrection of the
body. For if he had added the preposition In, then had the force of those
clauses ben all one with the force of that, that went before. For in those
words wherein our Belief touching the Godhead is set down, in God the Father,
in Jesus Christ his Son, and in the Holy Ghost: but in the rest where the
speech is not of the Godhead, but touching the creatures or mysteries, the
preposition is not added, that we may say, in the holy Church, but that the
holy Church is to be believed, not as we believe in God, but as a Congregation
gathered to God, and that the forgiveness of sins is to be believed, not
that we ought to believe in the forgiuenenesse of sins: and that the
resurrection of the flesh is to believed, not that we ought to believe in the
resurrection of the flesh. So that by this Syllable In, the Creator is
discerned from the Creatures, and that that is Gods, from that that is man's.
Bullinger. fol. 78.

Saint Augustine Augustine
in his Book De fide and Symbolo has: I believe the holy Church, not in the
holy Church. There are alleged also his words in his Epistle Ad Neciphyros,
touching consecration Distinct. 4. cap. 1. We said not that ye had to believe
in the Church as in God, but understand how we said, that ye being conversant
in the holy Catholic Church, should believe in God.

Paschasius in the first Chapter of his first book De Spiritu sancto, says:
We believe the Church as the Mother of regeneration: we do not believe in the
Church as the Author of salvation. He that believes in the Church, believes
in man. Leave off therefore this blasphemous persuasion, to think that thou
have to believe in any worldly creature: since thou may not believe neither
in Angel nor Archangell. The unskillfulness of some have drawn and taken the
Preposition, In, from the sentence that goes next before, and put it to that
that follows, adding thereto also too too shamefully, somewhat more then
needed.

Thomas of Aquine reasoning of Faith, in the 2. Book part. 2. Article. 9.
question. 1. says: If we say, I believe in the holy Church, we must
understand that our ^aith is referred to the Holy ghost, which sanctifies the
Church, and so make the sense to be thus: I believe in the holy Spirit that
sanctifies the Church, but it is better, and according to the common use not
to adee at all the syllable In, but simply to say: The holy Catholic Church,
even as also Pope Leo says. Bullinger. fol. 79.

INVOCATION.
What Invocation is.
WE call that Invocation, when we desire some good things to be given us, or
some evil to be taken away from us.

Proves against the invocation of Saints.
As touching Invocation, that is to wit, calling upon them, we have in
Scripture, how we should call upon almighty God, in all necessities or
tribulations. Psalm. 50. 15
As in the Psalms every where, as in this: Call upon me in time of your
tribulation, and I shall deliver you. Mark how he says here, Call upon me,
appointing neither S. Thomas, nor Master John Shorn. Also in another place:
Psa. 145. 18.
The Lord is nigh unto them that call upon him, that call upon him truly, and
with that he shows, who calls upon him truly, saying thus: He shall do the
will or desire of them that reverence him, and shall hear graciously their
prayer, and make them safe, for the Lord loves all that loves him, and all
sinners shall be destroyed, etc. In the bo. of Mar. fo. 1264.

There is one Mediator between God and man, 1. Tim. 2. 5
the man Christ Jesus, the which has given himself the redemption of all men.
Saint Paul says, There is but one Mediator between God and man. Where there
is but one, there cannot Saints come in. Saints be men, and must have a
Mediator for themselves, and then they cannot be Mediators for other men.
Moreover the Mediator between God and man, is called Christ Jesus, now is
there no Saint that has that name, if there be none, then is there none that
usurp this office without blaspheming of Christ. Furthermore, he has redeemed
us without the help of Saints, and why shall he not be whole Mediator without
Saints, redemption is the chief act of a Mediator. D Barnes.

If any man do sin, 1. John. 2. 1
we have an Advocate by the Father, Christ Jesus. Here is none assigned but
Christ Jesus, and by him have we only remission of our sins. D. Barnes.

The spirit of God makes intercession for us, Romans 8. 26
with mighty desires, that cannot be expressed with tongue. If the spirit of
God make intercession for us, then have we no need of other Mediators, for he
is able to obtain all things for us, and has taken this office on him for us
It were a great rebuke to him, that Saints should be set in his steed, and
joined with him in his office, as though he were insufficient. D. Barnes.

Christ sits also on the right hand of the Father, Romans 8. 34.
the which does also pray for us. Here S. Paul says, That Christ prays for
us, can the Father of heaven deny and thing of his prayer? Does not he ask
things necessary for us? And as Scripture says, He is our wisdom, he is our
justice, he is our sanctification and our redemption made of God. Now, what
rests for Saints to ask? What will you desire more then wisdom, justice,
sanctification and redemption: All these has Christ obtained for us. D. Barnes.

Christ says, Ioh. 14. 6
No man comes to the Father but by me. Note these words. First he says, No
man, etc. Ergo as many as ever shall come to the Father of heaven be here
contained. Then adds he, But by me: here be all Saints and merits clean
excluded in this word ( But,) wherefore it is plain, that whatsoever he be,
that makes any other Mediator, or goes about by any means (seem it never
so holy) but by Christ only to come to the Father of Heaven: First, he
dispiseth Christ, and if he despise Christ, he dispiseth also the Father which
has allowed him only to be our Mediator and way to him, as it is written, I
am the way only to the Father. D. Barnes.

Whatsoever you ask in my name, Ioh. 16. 23.
the Father shall give it you. ^ Mark these words ( Whatsoever) and that we
should run to none other, he adddeth ( In my name.)

Here is nothing excluded, but all things be given us freely, and that for his
names sake, not for no Saints name, nor for none of our merits. Therefore, let
us not run from the sweet promises of our most loving Savior, Redeemer, and
only Mediator Jesus Christ to Saints, for that is an evident token of our
infidelity, and that we think him untrue, and will not fulfill his promise,
and make him a liar. D. Barnes.

Saint Paul says: Romans 8. 33.
He (meaning the Father of heaven) has given his only son for us, how can
it be, that he shall not give all things with him. Mark he says all things.
He y^ says all things, excludes not the tooth-ake. D. B.

All good things comes from the father of light. Here they make a
distinction, James. 1. 17
that God is good only for his own nature, and Saints are good by receiving
goodness of him.

Answer.
Saints have no more goodness then they have received, and that that they
received was for themselves only, and can give none of it to other, for
they received it for themselves, and no more then was necessary, and that but
only of mercy, as it is open in Mathewe in the Parable of the five wise
virgins, and the five foolish. Thus we do openly against God, when we desire
any thing of Saints, seeing the Scripture knows all good things to come of
God only, and that he is the only giver of them. All the Prophets and
Fathers in all their tribulations, cried unto him, as David testifies of
himself saying: When I am in trouble I will cry unto the Lord, and he will
help me. Psalm. 120. 1. My help is of God that made heaven and earth. Psalm..
121. 2. Christ also himself teaching all creatures to pray, bids us not to
go to any other, but only to the father of heaven. Math. 6. 9. D. Barnes.

Objection.
The Saints must pray for us, and be mediators to God for us, that by them we
may be able to receive our petition. This is Richards opinion De media villa.

Answer.
This is a great blasphemy to Christ's blood, for if Saints be necessary to
be mediators for us, then is Christ insufficient: For Philosophers did never
put two causes when one was sufficient. And if any thing be given us for
Saints sake, then be not all things given us for Christ's sake. The which is
plainly against Saint Paul's saying. Romans 8. 32. God for us all has given his
son, and shall he not give us all things with him. D. Barnes.

An other of his reasons.
If Saints when they were here, and not confirmed in grace, did of their
Charity pray for us, Ergo now must they pray much more, seeing they are now
confirmed in Charity.

Answer.
A reason without Scripture must have a like answer. The Saints when they
were here, did of their Charity cloth naked men, and feed the hungry, and
gave drink to the thirsty, and visited them that were in prison, Ergo much
more now, for they be confirmed in Charity. Likewise Saint Paul when he was
here, did of his charity write Epistles, and declare the verity, Ergo now
must he much more write, so that where before he wrote but one, now must he at
the least write three, or else he is not confirmed in Charity. D. Barnes.

Another like reason.
Like as a man cannot come to the speech of a King, but that he must have
certain Mediators, as Dukes, Earls and such men as be in favor, between him
and the King, that may entreat his matter.

Answer.
Saint Ambrose answers this reason thus: Men are wont (says he) to use this
miserable excusation, that by these things we may come to God, as we may come
to Kings by Earls. I answer, We come unto the King by the means of Dukes
and Earls, because that the King is a man, and knows not to whom he may
commit the Common weal: But to God (from whom nothing can be hid, he knows
all men's merits) we need no spokes-men, nor no Mediator, but only a deuo^t
mind. D. Barnes.

Look. Saints. Mediator.

JOB.
His name interpreted.
SOme interpret this name of Job, to signify weeping or wailing. And other
some take it for an utter Enemy, not such a one as he hates: but such a one
as is, as it were a white for m^n to shoot at. Call. upon Job. fol. 2.

It is not known nor can be gessed, in what time Job lived, saving that it may
be perceived he was of great antiquity.

Some of the Jews have been of opinion that Moses was the Author of his
book. But for so much as there is no certainty thereof, it is left in suspense.
Yet it may be well perceived by the Prophet Ezechiel, that the name of Job was
renowned among the people of Israel. For in his 14. chapter. verse. 20. he
says: That if Noe, Job and Daniel, were among the people that should perish,
they should save no mo men's lives but their own, and all the rest of the
people should be destroyed. Also Saint James reports, that he was of great
patience. So that by these two ( Ezechiel and Saint James) it is plainelye
showed, that there was a Job indeed. Calvin. upon Job. fol. 1.

Wherefore Job curses the day of his Nativity.
Let the day perish wherein I was borne. Job 3. 2.
He curses not his day because he was weary of it, as one desperate, but
rather wishing to be dissolved, least by farther troubles, he should be forced
to offend God. The Bible note.

Men ought not to be weary of their life, and curse it, because of the
infirmities, that it is subject unto, but because they are given to sin and
rebellion against God. Geneua.

And cursed his day. Job. 3. 1.
Here Job begins to feel his great imperfection in this battle between
the spirit and the flesh. Romans 7. 18. And after a manner yields, but in the
end he gets victory, though he was in the mean time greatly wounded.
Geneua.

Like as a man having an Impostume (says Chrysostom) if he be cut of the
Surgeon, having nothing wherewith he may resist, during the time of his curing,
holds fast the things that be nigh him, and is ready to bite them that stand
by him, and yet can do nothing unto them: even so Job fearing the
grieuousnesse of blaspheming and cursing, does wrong to vnliuely things, and
speaking after the manner of the common people, which impute their miseries to
the influence of the stars, and to the day of their birth, curses his day,
that is, testi^eth with cursing, how bitter a life he lives, and unto how
great miseries he was borne (as we commonly say) in an unhappy hour, even as
though now a days a man repenting his sins should say: Woe is me wretch,
in an unhappy hour was I borne, which with my deeds have denied my maker,
woe worth it, etc.

How God suffered Satan to smite Job with sores.
And smote Job with sore Byles, Job. 2. 7.
etc. This sore was most vehement, wherewith also God plagued the Egyptians.
Exodus. 9. 9. And threateneth to punish the rebellious people. Deuteronomy. 28.
27. So that this temptation was most grievous. For if Job had measured Gods
favor by the vehemency of his disease, he might have thought that God had
cast him off. Geneua.

How Job does not justify himself.
IF I will justify my self, Job. 9. 20^
mine own mouth shall condemn me. Here it is good to see that Job presumes
not of his own righteousness, but plainly confesses himself unrighteous,
and a sinner before God, although before the world he had lived blameless. GOD
looks on the heart, though men look only on the outward appearaunce.

His adversaries thought, that he should never have had such a Cross laid on
him unless then he had also outwardly and openly lived in wickedness. To that
answers Job in diverse places, that he therein was not culpable, and
therefore accuses as it were after the manner of men the judgment of God,
concerning such as are outwardly righteous and stud^ous to live virtuously,
namely, such as live without blame among men, and that both intend and do well
to all men, and yet are wrapped in many miseryes and wretchedness oftentimes
over cruel. And herein lies the chief of the controversy betwixt Job and
his adversaries, that Job defends himself, not to have deserved his
punishment by his outward living: whereas his adversaries armed only with
manly and fleshly wit, think God to be unrighteous, if he would so grievously
punish him, that had not been an outward sinner against him. Job, his
conscience bearing him witness had lived innocently, and straightly, and hurt
no man, had always feared GOD, and worshipped him only, his children, had he
also nourtured to the fear of God, and could of no man be accused of
wickedness, yet witnesses he here (as all the godly do) that he was not
utterly without sin, for otherwise had he been a liar. 1. John. 1. 8. If we
say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us.
Wherefore in the place where he says, that he has not deserved his punishment,
and that should seem to show him blameless, know, that he speaks of his
outward manner of living, not of the inward thoughts and desires of the heart,
where he was undoubtedly an offender. T. M.

How this place of Job is understood.
O earth, cover not my blood, Job. 16. 18.
etc. That is, as Rab Abraham expounds it: Hide not my blood so, but that it
may be avenged, let not the auengement thereof be unknown, but open unto all
men's eyes, as was the auengement of Dathan and Abiram, whom the earth
swallowed. Nu. 16. 32.

Let my sin be known, if I be such a sinner, as mine adversaries accuse me,
and let me find no favor. Geneua.

JOHN BAPTIST.
Of the burial of John Baptist.
ANd his Disciples came and took up his body and buried it. How it was
lawful for the Disciples of John to take away his body which was slain, it
may well be demanded, because that Josephus says, that he was beheaded in the
Castle of Macheron. Answer. Some do answer that the Disciples had access
or liberty to come to the Castle, as appears in the 11. Chapter before, when
John as yet lay bound in prison: whereby it may be gathered that they were not
prohibited. But forasmuch as this did pertain to the cruelty of ye woman, y^
the body of the holy man should lie unburied, it is probable for so much as ye
Disciples took upon them to bury it, that it was cast out by soldiers of the
Tyrant. And although ye honor or pomp of burial profits nothing those that
are dead, yet notwithstanding it is the Lords will to have the same reverenced
of us. And truly it were far from humanity to suffer the dead to lie
unburied like the ca^kases of brute beasts, for what sight can be more
sorrowful, vglye, or horrible, then to see a dead a man's body unburied.

Furthermore, burial is a figure of the resurrection to come. Wherefore this
diligence of the Disciples of John in coming to bury the body of their
master was acceptable unto God. Moreover this seems much to confirm their
godly minds and earnest love, which they bare to their master when he was
alive, for by this means they professed that the doctrine of this holy man
John, remained yet in their hoa^tes. This confession therefore was laudable and
deserved no small commondation, seeing it was done with danger and great
adventure of peril: because they could do no honor to their master being
put to death, without provoking great displeasure and outrageous revenge of the
tyrant against them. Here we are taught what we owe to the dead bodies of
Saints, namely burial, not papistical canoni^ation, or false worshipping,
which has been used with great abuse. Marl. upon Math. fol. 313.

How John is thought to work miracles after his death.
He is risen from death, Mat. 14. 2.
and therefore are miracles wrought by him. It is an Heathenish belief, to
think that men can do greater things after their death, then in their life
time, and hereof did spring the vain worshipping of dead folks. Sir. I.
Cheek.

He spoke after the common error, for they thought, that the souls of them
that were departed, entered into another body. Geneua.

Wherefore John was called Helias.
John Baptist was called Helias, Mat. 17. 12
because he came in the spirit and power of Helias, most sharply rebuking sin.
That so, men knowing their own sinful nature, and the damnation y^ hung over
them, should the more gladly embrace Christ, the savior and redeemer of the
world. Sir. I. Cheek.

Wherefore John Baptist did no miracles.
John did no miracles. God would have no miracles done by John, John. 10. 41
least the people should have attributed too much unto him. And therefore he
would have him only to teach and to testify. For as the body of Moses and
his sepulcher are hid unto this present day, and that by the just providence of
God, least that superstitious flesh in visiting the body of Moses should commit
Idolatry: even so for just cause John, than whom other wise there arose not a
greater among women's children, wrought no miracles. For if so be the gift of
miracles had been joined to his doctrine and holiness of life, the people
could scarce have been driven srom believing him to be Christ, etc. Marl. upon
John. fol. 394.

Of John's Baptime.
The Baptime of John, Mat. 21. 25
whence was it, etc. Here the Baptime of John is taken for that heavenly
doctrine which he taught. For as water does wash away the filthiness of the
body, so does true doctrine make the soul clean, delivering it from
superstition and erroneous doctrine. Sir. I. Cheek.

Unto what then were ye baptized, Act. 19. 3.
and they said unto John's Baptime. By this place, John's Baptime signifies
John's doctrine, which therefore is so called, for that he sealed his doctrine
with the seal of Baptime, in them that believed. The Bible note.

Meaning what doctrine, they did profess by their Baptime: for to be baptized
in John's Baptime, signifies, to profess the doctrine which he taught, and
sealed with the sign of Baptime, to be baptized in the name of the Father,
etc. is to be dedicate and consecrate unto him. To be baptized in the death of
Christ, or for the dead, or into one body, unto remission of sins is, that
sin by Christ's death may be abolished and die in us, and that we may grow
in Christ. Math. 3. 11. Mar. 1. 8. Luke. 3. 16. Ihon. 1. 27. Act. 1. 5. and 2.
2. 11. 16. Geneua.

Baptime in this place is taken for the doctrine, and not for the lauer of
water. For the baptime of Christ and the baptime of John, which is done in the
water, is all one: else Christ who was baptized by John, ought to have been
baptized again. Here then we do gather that these folks not twice baptized
with the water of Baptime, but were twice instruccted, and at length after
perfect instruction, they were baptized with water in the name of Christ. Sir.
I. Cheek.

Of the difference between John's Baptime, and the Apostles.
The difference between the Baptime of John and the Apostles was only this,
that John baptized them to believe in Christ that was for to come, and the
Apostles baptized them to believe in Christ, which was come already, and had
suffered for the remission of sins of as many as believed in him. Tindale.

JOHN THE EVANGELIST.
Of this John's life, written by Saint Hierome.
John the Apostle whom Jesus loved right well, being the son of Zebedeus,
and James the Apostles brother, whom after the Lords death Herod had
beheaded, wrote his Gospel last of all the rest, being desired there to by the
Bishops of Asia, both against Cerinthus, and diverse other heretics. But
principally against the Ebeonites, which even then arose, which Ebeonites
avouch that Christ was not before Marie^ by reason whereof he was enforced to
show of his divine nativity. They say, that beside this, there was an other
cause of his writing, because that when he had read the volumes of Matthew,
Mark, and Luke, he well allowed the text of the story, and affirmed that they
had said truth, but had only made their story of one years act, in the which
after the imprisonment of John Christ suffered. Wherefore omitting that years
acts, which were sufficientlye entreated of all three, he shows such things
as were done before John was imprisoned, which thing may evidently appear to
such as shall diligently read the volumes of the four Gospels: the which
thing also does take away the disagreeing that seems to be between John and
the rest. He wrote beside the premises one Epistle, which begins thus: That
which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our
eyes, etc. The other two which begin: The elder to the well beloved Lady and
her children, etc. And the elder to the best deloued Caius, whom I love in the
truth. etc. are affirmed to have been written of John the Priest, whose
several tomb is at this day to be seen at Ephesus, and many suppose that
there are two memorials of this same John the Evangelist, of which matter we
will entreat, after we shall by order come to y^ life of Papias his scholar. In
the 14. year ^hen, at what time Domicianus after Nero, stirred up the second
persecution, John being banished into the I Will of Pathmos wrote y^ revelation,
which is entitled the Apocalips, which Justin the martyr, and Ireneus do make
Commentaries upon.

But after Domician was slain, and all his acts revoked by the Senate, because
of his overmuch cruelty, he returned to Ephesus in the time of Prince Neruai
and continued there until the time of the Emperor Traiane, he instituted and
governed all the Churches of Asia, and there continued till he was impotent for
age. He died the threescore and eight year after the passion of the Lord
Jesus. And was buried a little beside the same City. Eras. in his Paraphras.

A no^able history of this John.
When John was returned to Ephesus fr(...) the I Will of Pathmos, he was desired
for matters of religion to resort to y^ places bor^^ring near unto him: And
coming to a certain place, he saw a goodly young man both of body and
countenance, on whom he east such a fauour^ that he committed him to the
Bishop there, charging the Bishop most earnestly (and that two several
times,) to see him diligently instructed in the doctrine and faith of Christ.
And so John returning again to Ephesus, the Bishop took the young man and
brought him home, and diligently instructed him in the ways of Christ, and at
the last baptized him, and saw such towardnes in the man, that he committed
unto him the oversight of a certain cure in the Lords behalf. The young man
being now at liberty, it chanced certain of his old companions and familiars
to resort unto his company, who being idle, dissolute, and wicked persons,
enticed him to all mischief, insomuch that at the last he became as head and
captain among them in committing all kind of murder and felony. In the
mean time it chanced John to come into that quarters, and meeting the Bishop,
required of him the pledge that he left with him. The Bishop was now so amazed
that he could not tell what to answer: Then John perceiving his doubting,
said: It is the young man and the soul of our brother committed to your
custody which I require: Then y^ Bishop with great sorrow and weeping, said he
was dead. By what death quoth John^ He is dead to God, quoth the Bishop, for he
is how become an evil man, and the head Captain of thieves, which does
frequent this mountain. When John the Apostle heard this, he rent his clothes
for sorrow, and rode in all have toward the place where the young man lay, and
by ye way was taken with thieves. Then said John to the thieves, for this
cause came I hither, therefore bring me to your Captain: And being brought unto
him: the young man being all armed, began at the first to look feercely upon
John: but coming to the knowledge of him, he was stricken with great confusion
and shame, and began to flee, but John following, said: My son, why do
thou flee from thy Father? An armed man from one naked, a young man from an
old man, have pity upon me my son, for there is yet hope of salvation, I
will answer for thee unto Christ, I will die for thee if need be, as Christ
has dyed for us. I will give my life for thee. Believe me, Christ has sent
me. The young man hearing, stood still, and cast down his weapon, and
sorrowed out of measure for his offense. And John comforting him in Christ, and
in the sweet promises of salvation for his sake, never left him until he had
restored him unto the congregation again, and made him a great example and
trial of regeneration, and a token of the visible resurrection. The book of
Mar. fol. 56.

How this John is called a barbarous fellow.
Numenius an Heathen Philosopher, when he had read the beginning of John's
Gospel, burst out into these words, I pray God I die, and if this barbarous
follow, have not comprehended in few words, all that our Plato prosequuteth in
so many words. He calls him barbarous, because he was an Hebrew, and in his
writing leaves traces of his mothers tongue, and follows not curiously the
finenesse and properties of the Greek manner of speaking, but he granted unto
him as much knowledge as the most famous Philosopher, and father of all learned
wits Plato had, and more shortness in writing, which is more commendable in a
writer of grave matters. Writers of histories show many wonderful things of
this John, as that he was put in boiling oil, and came out again unhurt, etc.
But it shall be sufficient for us to know and consider, that he was one of the
most excellent, singular, and special Apostles, and therefore a meet witness
of the Lord Jesus. B. Traheron.

IONA.
The interpretation of this word Iona.
THou art Simon the son of Iona. Whereas our text has the son of Iona,
Ihon. 1. 41.
Noinus reads it the son of John, and not of Iona, to the which agrees
this place, Simon Iohanna, or Simon the son of John, love thou me. But it
is likely that the father of Simon was called Iochanan, whereupon the letter of
Asperation being altered out of his place, and s. put to ye end, came Johannes,
the which also afterward being made short, became Iona. And Iochanan or
Iochana, do signify that which we call in English John, and is as much to say
as Grecians. Marl. upon John. fol. 37.

IOSAPHAT.
Of his supreme government.
HE sends out Preachers throughout all Iewrie. 2. Pa. 17. 7
Here is declared (says Lyra) how he instructed his people, to wit, by the
Priests and Leuits, whom he sent to this purpose, and with them certain of his
Princes, to move the people to obedience, and to punish the rebellious if they
should find any. I. Bridges. fol. 265.

And Iosaphat appointed in Jerusalem Leuits and Priests and families of
Israel, 2. Par. 19.
that they might give judgment, and judge the cause of the Lord to the
inhabitants thereof, etc. And he commanded them saying: Thus shall ye do in the
fear of the Lord faithfully, and with a perfect heart, and in every cause that
shall come unto you and your brethren that dwell in their Cities, between
blood and blood, between law and precept, statutes and judgments, ye shall
judge them and admonish them, etc. Whereupon says Lyra, Lyra.
Hic ordinatur, etc. Here is ordained the government of the people in
difficult causes, which could not well be cut off without recourse had to
Jerusalem, according to the which is commanded. Deuteronomy. 17. 8. where it is
said: If thou shall perceive the judgment before thee to be difficult and
doubtful, arise and get thee up to the place which the Lord shall choose, etc.
And therefore Iosaphat appointed Judges there, to determine such difficult
matters, wherefore it follows, every cause which comes unto you, etc.
Wheresoever the question is, if it be of the law, so far forth as pertains
to the commandments of the tables: if it be of the precepts of the ten
commandments, as it were certain conclusions picked out: If it be of the
Ceremonies, so far forth as pertains to ceremonial matters of
iustifications, that is to say, of judicial matters, whereby justice is to be
conserved among men.

Thus is there no part ecclesiastical or temporal exempted, from the
oversight, care, direction, and appointment of the King. I. Bridges, fol. 272.

JOSEPH.
Of Joseph the husband of Marie.
THen Joseph her husband beeinge a just man, Math. 1. 19
etc. Upright and fearing God, and therefore suspectinge that she had committed
fornication, before she was betrothed, would neither receive her, which by
the law should be married to an other, neither accusing her, put her to shame
for her fault. Geneua.

Of the equal way that Joseph the son of Jacob devised for the Egyptians in
the time of dearth.
That Joseph brought the Egyptians into such subjection, Genesis 41. 38.
would seem unto some a very cruel deed, howbeit, it was a very equal way,
for they paid but the fifth part of that ye grew of the ground, and therewith
were they quite of all duetyes, both of rent, custom, tribute and toll. And
the king therewith found them Lords and all ministers and defended them. We
now pay half so much to the Priest, only beside their crafty exactions.
Then pay we rent yearly, though there grow never so little on the ground, and
yet when the king calls, pay we nevertheless. So that if we look
indifferentlye, their condition was easier then ours, and but even a very
indifferent way, both for the common people and the king. Tindale. fol. 7.

Why they buried Joseph's bones.
Buried them in Sichem. They buried Joseph's bones, Iosu. 24. 32
partly to perform their promise. Genesis 50. 25. and partly for a remembrance
of Gods holy promises concerning the land of promise, and not to be abused as
the Sepulchers and relics in these our latter days have been. The Bible note.

IOSIA.
How his name was prophesied many years before.
AND bowed neither to the right hand nor to the left. 4. Re. 22. 2
His zeal was prophessed of, and his name mentioned by Iddo the Prophet, more
then three hundred years before. 3. Reg. 13. 2. And being but eight years
old, he sought the God of his father David. Geneua.

How he removed the groves.
Look. Groves.

How he put out the Idolatrous Priests from ministering.
Nevertheless the Priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the
Lord to Jerusalem. 4. Re. 23. 9
Iosia thought not meet that those Priests which had served Idols, should be
ministers in the temple of God. The Bible note.

IRONICE.
What Ironice is.
IRonia is a figure in speaking, when a man dissembleth in speech, that which
he thinks not, as in scoffing, calling that foul which is fair, or that
sweet which is sour.

ISAAC.
At what age he was sacrificed.
ISaac the son of Abraham was sacrificed by his Father, in the 13. year of
his life, as Aben, Esra, and Saul do write, but Josephus affirms it to be
done in the. 25. year. Lanquet.

ISOPE.
The meaning of this place.
O Purge me with Isope, Psa. 51. 7.
and I shall be clean, etc. In the solemn sacrifice for sin, of which Nu.
19. and in the cleansing of the leaper, of which Leuit. 14. There was Isope
anexed and joined to. By that sprinkling was signified, right pureness of
heart: for that prays he here, that is, for full remission of his sin;
which once had, and the favor of God obtained, the mind reioyseth with
unspeakable joy, and becomes much whiter to the eye of the soul, then does
any Snow to the bodily eye. Some understand by Isope the passion of Christ,
by which only we are purified from our sins. T. M.

ISRAEL.
What Israel does signify.
Israel, by, (...)pretation, is as much to say, as a man that fears GOD. So
that every Christian is an Israelite, a man that fears God. Wherefore when the
Prophet says, Deliver Israel out of all his troubles, is as much to say, as
deliver Lord every true believer. Ric. Turnar.

Of the goodness of God toward Israel.
Behold I have purged thee, Esa. 48. 10
and not for moneie, etc. Some read, behold I have purified thee, but not as
silver: I have chosen thee out of the furnaice of affliction for mine own sake,
for mine own sake have I done this. For like whom would they pollute me:
truly I will not give my glory to any other. Harke^, etc. There be some that
expound it thus, I would not suffer thee wholly to perish: for if I had proved
and purified thee as gold and silver is proved and purified, from which all
manner of dross is cleansed, there should nothing have remained in thee, but I
brought thee under, and proved thee in the furnaice of affliction, that is,
wrapped thee in captivity and bondage in Egypt, from which I afterward
delivered thee, and this have I done for mine own sake, that is only for mine
own name, and glory of mine own gentleness and louinge kindness, not for
any of thy merits or deseruinges, which were none at all. For how would the
Gentiles and Heathen, have blasphemed my name, if I had rooted out mine own
people: and so have made the truth of the promises which I had determined to
fulfill in Christ; vain and untrue. For as well this praise of my truth, as
the glory of the blessing promised in the seed of Abraham and David, will I not
give unto another people or nation. The health of the world shall come of the
Jews. John. 4. and from none other. The glad tidinges of the health shall
the whole world receive of none other then of Christ, by the preaching of the
Apostles, etc. T. M.

Of Isreal's adversity.
Look in the word Navel.

What Saint Paul means by Israel of God.
And upon Israel that pertains to God. Gal. 6. 16.
Because that they which taught circumcision, mixing the law with the Gospel,
were of the Israelites. Here Saint Paul does seem to put a difference
between them and the other, which preached the gospel sincerely, whom he
calls the Israel of God, or that perteyneth unto God. Sir. I. Cheek.

IVBELY.
What the Iubely signifies.
IT shall be a year of Iubely unto you. Leui. 25. 10.
Iubely is of this Hebrew word Iobel, which in English, signifies a Trumpet: a
year of singular mirth and joy, and of much rest, wherein their corn and all
their fruits come forth without sowing, tilling, or any other labors. And
also by this Iubely is signified the restoring of all things unto her
perfection, which shall be after the general judgment, in that flourishing
world when ye chosen shall be admitted into liberty, from all wretchedness,
poverty, anguish, and oppression, when all shall be fully restored again in
Christ, that through the sin of the first man was taken away. T. M

Then thou shall cause to blow the Trumpet of the Iubely, Leui. 25. 9
etc. In the beginning of the 50. year was the Iubely so called, because the
joyful tidings of liberty was publicly proclaimed by the sound of a Cornet.
Geneua.

Who and by whom the Iubely was first brought up.
Boniface the 8. about the year of our Lord. 1300. ordained that the Iubely
should be every hundred year. Clement the sixth brought it back to every
fifty year. And Sextus the fourth brought it^ down to every. 25. year.
pretending the shortness of man's life, for a cloak to their own gain. Marl.

How this place of Judas dipping, is understood.
HE that dippeth his hand with me in the dish. Mat. 26. 23.
That is to say, whom I vouchsafed to come to my table, alluding to ye place.
Psa. 41. 9. which is not so to be understood, as though at y^ self same
instant y^ the Lord spoke these words, Judas had his hand in the dish (for
that had been an undoubted token) but it is meant of his tabling and eating
with him. Beza.

Whereunto Judas was called.
Judas was not given Christ of his heavenly Father, for to be kept and
preserved with the other unto life everlasting: but for to bear the office of
an Apostle for a time, which appears to be most true, by that which Christ
says: All that my Father gives me shall come to me, and him that comes I
will not cast out. The like may be said of all those, that for a time do
seem to be very Apostles of our Savior Christ, preaching the Gospel to
men's thinking most sincerely and purelye, but at length they do clean fall
away from Christ, and become enemies of the word. Such were Philetus,
Himeneus, and Demas, with many other. These were given Christ of his heavenly
Father, for to be in such high rooms and offices for a time, but not to be
kept unto eternal life: else how can that stand where he says: This is
the will of my Father that sent me, that I loose none of all those that he
has given me, but that I do raise them up at the last day. So that they
which be given to Christ of his Father, for to be fellow heirs with him in
his kingdom, can never perish. I. Veron.

Whereunto Judas was called.
Look. Chosen.

What the cause of Judas dampnation was.
The cause of Judas dampnation was, for that he laid hold only upon the
judgment of GOD set forth in his Law, without layenge hold upon the grace
and mercy of God, set forth in his Gospel, to all repentauntes and
faithful. As Saint Peter did apprehende it after he had renownced Jesus
Christ. Pet. Viret.

Of Judas the brother of James.
Judas brother to James, Luke. 6. 16.
called also Thaddeus and Lebbeus, preached to the Edessens, and to al
Mesepotamia. He was slain under Agbarus of the Edessens in Berito. Book of
Mar. fol. 52.

IVDGE.
How Christians may judge in matters of controversies.
Man, who made me a Judge or a diuider over you. Luke. 1^. 14.
It is to be noted that Christ at his first coming, came not to be a Judge,
but to be judged, and yet it cannot follow by this, but that Christians may be
Judges in matters of controversy. Sir. I. Cheek.

Christ chiefly came to be judged, and not to judge, notwithstanding he
wills the Christians to be Judges, and decide controversies between their
brethren. Geneua.

Are ye not good enough to judge small trifles, 1. Cor. 6. 2.
etc. We learn here in this place, that we may have our matters discussed
before christen Judges, that is to say, before them that be of a good and
uncorrupted conscience. Howbeit it were good that in every parish, some honest
and conscionable men, should be appointed to make unity and peace between
neighbor and neighbor.

Master, Luke. 12. 13
bid my brother divide the inheritance with me, Christ answered: Man, who made
me a Judge or a diuider over you. Christ came indeed to be judged, and not to
judge, he came to work the work of our redemption, not to decide
controversies, touching lands and possessions. The Anabaptists use this text
for one of their reasons to condemn magistracy among Christians: and
therefore a very learned and late writer in his exposition of this place,
writes thus: Hinc colligitur, etc. Hereof it may be gathered, how greatly
they doat which condemn Magistrates among the Christians by this place. For
Christ does not reason of the thing it self as though it were profane, but of
his own vocation, because he was sent to another end, although the thing it
self is holy and good.

Judgment of spiritual matters to whom it pertains.
It pertains to ecclesiastical persons to judge in spiritual causes. But if
any of the^ do swerve from y^ right rule of justice, he is subject to the
correction and punishment of ye civil magistrate. As Aaron had his authority
of judgment in spiritual causes, yet was he reproved by Moses, And Abiathar
the high Priest was deposed by Solomon, and Sadoch set in his place: And so
should^ Ahas, if he had been a good Prince, have deposed Vriah, for making the
profane Altar.

What judgment is forbidden.
Judge not, and ye shall not be judged. Mat. 7. 1.
Christ does not here forbid that kind of judgment that pertains to
Magistrates, whereby evil dooers are judged and punished, and the innocent
delivered, of the which kind of judgment. Exo. 18. 19 Psa. 82. 1. Esa. 1. 17.
but rather here we are instructed and taught, that we do not rashly and
uncharitably judge or condemn other men's faults, having always an eye unto
their faults, and forgetting our own.

He commands us, not to be curious or malicious to try out and condemn our
neighbors fault, for hypocrites hide their own faults, and seek not to amend
them, but are curious to reprove other men's. Geneua.

This is not meant of the temporal judgment, for Christ forbadde not that,
but often did stablish it, as do Peter and Paul in their Epistles also. Nor
here is not forbidden to judge those deeds which are manifest against the
laws of God, for those ought every christian man to persecute, yet must they
do after the order that Christ has set: but when he says, Hypocrite, cast out
first the beam that is in thine own eyes: it is easy to understand what
manner of judgment he means, etc. Tindale. fol. 137.

The meaning of these places following.
Judge no man, Io^n. 8. 15.
etc. Some distinguish thus, that he judges not as man judges: Other refer
it to the time, because he being in earth, took not upon him as yet the office
of a Judge. But more rightly it is joined with the sentence following: that the
sense may be thus: Christ judges not, and if he do, his judgment is firm
and a^tenticall, because it is divine.

So that the former part, where he denies that he judges, ought either to be
restrained to the circumstaunce of the present place. For that he might the
better convince his enemies of pride, he uses this comparison, because they
usurped to themselves license to judge preposterouslye, and yet nevertheless
could not abide him teaching simply, and absteining from the office of a Judge.
Marl. upon John. fol. 294.

Of judgment, because the Prince of this world is judged, etc. When they
shall know, that I (whom they called the Carpenters son, and willed to come
down from the Cross) am the very son of GOD, which have overcome all the
power of hell, and reign over all. 2. Cor. 10. 12. Ephe. ^. 19. Geneua

Think thou, Romans 2. 3.
etc. that thou shall escape the judgment of God. Judgment of God.
We may well excuse our selves before men, and make them to believe that we
are both just and righteous, for why? Men can only judge according to the
outward works, and according to that which they see and hear: but he that
searches the heart and reins, nothing can be hidden from him. Therefore we
cannot escape his true judgment. Sir. I. Cheek.

What it is to stand in judgment.
The ungodly shall not be able to stand in Judgment.

To stand in Judgment, is to win the process, and to have sentence
pronounced on their side, and to rob Judgment, is to let the process, and
to have sentence pronounced against right and truth. Esaias. 10. 1. So then this
text means no more, but that the wicked shall have such a terrible sentence
given upon them, that they shall not be able to abide when the Lord shall
come then to general judgment. It means not that the wicked shall not
appear in judgment. T. M.

Whether a Judge being guilty in any crime, may judge an other, accused of
the self same crime.
Wherefore, Romans 2. 1.
O man, thou art in-excusable, whosoever thou art that iudgest, for in that
thou iudgest an other, thou condemnest thy self, for thou y^ iudgest, do
even the self same thing. Here it seems such to be reproved which judge
others (and that not amiss) when as yet they themselves live in the self same
wicked acts: Let us see whether their opinion be upright which think that
such Judges cannot nor ought not to give sentence against others which are
accused unto them, they themselves being guilty of the self same fault, but
this were to overthrow all public wealths, and utterly to take away
judgments. Neither does Paul here any thing serve for the maintenance of
this opinion, but only shows that they most grieuouslye sin, which with a
great severity punish others, and ouerpasse themselves. They ought undoubtedly
first to correct and amend themselves, but yet Paul bids them not to
forsake the office committed unto them. They use also for this purpose to
recite the saying of Christ unto them which accused the adulterous woman: He
which among you is without sin, let him cast the first stone at her. But this
sentence of Christ is not against just punishments and lawful judgments.
Neither commanded he them that they should not go forward in accusing the
woman whom they had taken in adultery. He himself was no Magistrate, but the
most high Preacher of God, therefore that which was his office to do, he
executed, in persuading those hypocrites to repentance. And he would have them
first hereunto to have a regard by a lively faith and repentance to deliver
themselves from the sins whereof they were guilty. Neither forbad he, but y^
they should execute y^ which the law of Moses commanded, etc. Pe. Mar. upon the
Romans fo. 36

Here S. Paul speaks against those men only, who being themselves filled
with all wickedness and impiety, yet be of all other most busy and curious
in noting and reprehending other men's faults, not of any godly zeal, but to
justify themselves, and to bring others into hatred and contempt. The Bible
note.

Wherefore Judges are called Gods.
In all causes (says God to Moses) of injury or wrong, Exo. 22. 9
whether it be Ox, Ass, Sheep, or Uesture, or any lost thing, which an other
chalengeth, let the cause of both parties be brought before the Gods: Gods.
whom the Gods condemn, the same shall pay double unto his neighbor. Mark,
the Judges are called Gods in the Scriptures, because they are in Gods room,
and execute the commmaundements of God, and in an other place in the said
chapter, Moses charge, saying: Neither speak evil of the rule^ of the
people, whosoever therefore resists them, resists God (for they are in the
rowme of God) and they that resist, shall receive dampnation. Tindale. fol. 110.

I said, John. 1. 34.
ye are called Gods. Meaning of Princes and rulers, who for their office are
called Gods, and are made here in earth as his Liuetenants, wherefore if this
noble title be given to man, much more it apperteineth to him that is the son
of GOD, equal with the Father. Geneua.

Of the last judgment.
The Hebrews do crake upon a certain number of thousands of years, in
which this world should be determined: and they attribute these words unto
the Prophet Elias: There shall be six thousand years of this world. Two
thousand shall be void (so they do call the time which went before the
law) two thousand for the law, and two thousand for Christ. In deed this
saying does serve well to confute the obstinacye of the Jews, whereas they do
yet stubburnelye deny that Christ is come, Last judgment
but to prove the determinate space and end of the world, it can be of no
authority at all. Lactantius does also determine this world at the six
thousand. Augustine does confute them which does determine the thousands of
this world, according unto the number of the days in the week, affirming
that the eight day is a figure of the resurrection and end of the world. As
for me I am well contented to be ignorant of that which God would not have
me to know, whereby I do not allow their conjectures and gessinges, which
had rather argue in this matter and search the secrets of God, then according
unto the admonition of the Lord, watch, walk in the study, and seeking of true
godliness. Musculus upon his Common place. fol. 449.

JUST.
Who is a just man.
HE that lives unblameable and honestly among men, and harmeth no man, but is
glad to do good to all men to his power, such is called a Cicero (or rather
of all men) a just or righteous man. Such a one was Symeon, and diverse other
named in Scripture. Hemmyng.

What is meant by the just man.
To the just man, ^. Tim. 1. 9
says Saint Paul, there is no law set, but to the unjust and disobedient,
etc. By the just man here is meant, not he which never had disease, but he
which knowing his disease, seeks out the Physician, and being cured, keeps
himself in health as much as may, from any more surfets. Notwithstanding he
shall never so keep himself, but that his health (that is his new obedience)
shall always remain frail and imperfect, and shall continually need the
Physician. Where, by the way these three points are to be noted. First the
sickness it self: second, the knowing of the sickness: thirdly, the
Physician. The sickness is sin, the knowing of the sickness is repentance,
the Physician is Christ. Book. of Mar. fol. 1115.

Whose hearts Gods spirit does direct to do that willingly which the law
requires, so that their godly affection is to them as a Law, without further
constraint. Geneua.

The difference between a just man, and a man justified.
A just man is he that is endued with the virtue of Justice, which may increase
or diminish in him: but a justified man is he whose sins are forgiven him,
and he accounted righteous, not for his own worthiness, but for Christ's sake.
Or thus: a just or righteous man is he, that exercises himself, in the
keeping of Gods commandments, so near as God shall give him grace, and the
infirmity of man's corrupt nature will admit. But a justified man is he, that
having no Justice or righteousness in him before, is accepted of God for just,
his iniquity being pardoned, and his sins covered.

Look. Righteous.

JUSTICE.
The definition of Justice.
MEn do sundry wise define Justice, some man brings one thing, and some
another. Aristides said, It is, not to covet any other man's goods. In the
definition of Justice, some man brings one thing, and some another, which
rather belong to some part thereof, then whereby the whole is defined. In my
judgment, we must first see, what it is to be just, that thereby we may come
to the knowledge of Justice, for of just is derived Justice. And to say
briefly, to be just, is to be clear, sound and upright according to the
degree, condition, office and person which every man bears, and to answer
the same in all points, without blame. Each degree, condition, estate and
person, has his order and Iustite, etc. Musc. in his Com. pla. fo. 421.

JUSTIFICATION.
What is understood by Justification.
BY justifying understand none other thing, then to be reconciled to God, and
to be restored into his favor, and to have thy sins forgiven thee. As when I
say, God justifies us: understand thereby, that God God.
for Christ's sake, merits and deseruings only, receives us unto his mercy,
favor and grace, and forgiveness of our sins. And when I say, Christ Christ.
justifies us, understand thereby, that Christ only has redeemed us, bought
us, delivered us out of the wrath of God and damnation, and has with his works
only, purchased us, the mercy, favor and grace of God and the forgiveness
of our sins. And when I say, Faith Faith.
only justifies, understand thereby, that Faith and trust in the truth of
God, and in the mercy promised us for Christ's sake, and for his deseruings and
works only, does quiet the conscience, and certefie her, that our sins be
forgiven, and we in the favor of God. Tindale in his Prologue to the Romans.

To justify is nothing else, then to acquit him that was accused from all
filthiness, as allowing his innocence: since therefore God justifies us, by
the intercession of Christ, he does acquit us, not by allowaunce of our
innocence, but by imputation of righteousness, that we may be counted for
righteous in Christ, which are not righteous in our selves. Call. 3. bo. chap.
11. sect. 3.

This word justify, in the Latin men's ears, is as much to say, as to make
just: like as magnify to make great, and sanctify to make holy. And this
sense of this word, the Divine schoolmen like well, which they that do
follow them, do yet earnestly stand unto. Augustine also does in diverse
places still expound this word of justifying in this sense, when he says,
Believing in him which justifies the wicked, that is to say, of the wicked
does make godly. The Apostle Paul out of whose writings this entrance of
Justification, is principally taken, used the word of justifying, not in the
sense that the Latin ears do like, but in that sense which the holy
Scripture uses it, according to the custom of the holy language in which he
was born, brought up and instructed in from his childhood. In that language to
justify, is as as much to say, as to quite a man of his offense, and to
pronounce him just. The contrary of it, is to condemn a man of naughtiness
and wickedness, etc. This word justify, is not to make one just, which is
unjust and wicked, but is used in every place for to quite a man of his fault,
and to pronounce and declare him just. Musc. fol. 222.

How we are justified freely, and by Faith only.
It is also the cause why Faith is plainly called by S. Paul, the Faith of the
chosen, and for the which Justification is attributed unto it: that honor is
given unto it, for so much as many does acknowledge himself by the same, such as
he is of his own nature: to wit a poor and miserable sinner, the child of
wrath, subject to death and eternal damnation, therefore, spoiling himself of
his own Justice, and of all trust in his own works and merits, he does
embrace Jesus Christ, to be cladde with his Justice, to the end, that by it
his sins may be covered, in such sort that they come not to count at the
judgment of God, and so that the poor sinner by reputed just, as though he
had never offended, and that because the Justice of Christ is allowed unto him
Faith, as though the same were proper to the man, to whom it is allowed. Pet.
Viret.

All men are sinners and want the glory of God, but they are justified freely
by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ. Here Paul says, We
are justified freely. If there be any deserving less or more, then it is not
freely. He says also, Of grace, if it be any part of works, then it is not of
grace, for as S. Paul says, Then grace were no grace. S. Ambrose says upon
this place of S. Paul: All men are sinners, etc. They are justified freely
(says S. Ambrose) for they doing nothing, nor nothing deserving, alonely by
Faith are justified, by the gift of God. Here Saint Ambrose says, Men
working nothing, nor nothing deserving, are justified by Faith only. D. Barnes.

Origin upon the same t^xt says: That the Justification of Faith is alonely
sufficient, so that a man do believe only he is justified, though there be no
wo^^^es ^oke of him at al. By Faith was ye thief justified without y^ works
of y^ (...) for y^ Lord did not ask him what he had done, nor look for any
works of him, but did accept him only for confessing of Christ. Wherefore
says Origin, a man is justified by Faith, unto whom as concerning
Justification, the works of ye law help nothing. Here it is plain by Origin,
that works do help nothing to Justification, but Faith only. D. Barnes.

What thing does purchase Justification.
The same thing that purchases remission of our sins, does also purchase
Justification. For Justification is nothing else but remission of sins. Now
Faith purchases us remission of sins, Ergo by Faith we are justified. Now,
that Faith purchases remission of sins is well proved by the Article of our
Faith, Credo remissionem peccatorum. I believe remission of sins. Now if I
have not this remission for Faith, then Faith deceives me. For I do believe
only, because I would have remission of sins. What need we to believe
remission of sins, if I may deserve it by works. D. Barnes.

What the true way of Justification is.
The very true way of Justification is this: First comes God for the love of
Christ Jesus, alonely of his mere mercy, and gives us freely the gift of
Faith, whereby we do believe God and his holy word, and stick, fast unto the
promises of God, and believe that though heaven and earth, and all that is in
them should perish and come to naught, yet God shall be found true in his
promise. For this faith sake be we the children of God. This is not such a
Faith as men dream, The historical Faith
when they believe that there is one God, and believe that he is eternal,
believe also that he made the world of naught, yea and believe that the Gospel
is true, and all things that God speaks, must be true and fulfilled, with
other such things. This is not the Faith that we be justified by, for Devils
and Infidells have this faith, and also we may atteine to these things by the
strength of reason^ But the Faith^ The justifying Faith.
that shall justify us, must be of another manner of strength: for it must
come from heaven, and not from the strength of reason. It must also make me
believe that God the ma^er of heaven and earth, is not only a Father, but also
my Father, yea, and that through the favor that Christ has purchased me, from
the which favor, neither heaven nor earth, tribulation nor persecution, death
nor hell can divide me. But to this stick I fast, that he is not alonely my
father, but also a merciful father, yea, and that unto me merciful, and so
merciful, that he will not impute my sins unto me though they be never so many
nor so great, so long as I hang on the blessed blood of Christ Jesus, and sin
not of malice, but of frailty and of no pleasures. D. Barnes.

How Cornel^us was justified.
Cornelius a Gentile did great alms, Act. 10. 4.
and prayed unto God always, unto whom the Angel spoke on this manner: Thy
prayer and thine alms, are come up into remembrance in the presence of God.
Of this text some do gather, that his good works did help to Justification.

The solution.
The Holy ghost has openly declared himself there: for he says that this
Cornelius was a devout man, and one that feared God. How could this be, without
that God had taught him inwardly by Faith. Yea, how could he know God, and that
devoutly, but by faith: Ergo he was justified before God by his Faith, but the
world knew not his Justification. And therefore the Holy ghost does declare his
inward Justification, when he says that he was devout and feared God. And
also does show openly the fruits of his Justification, when he says that he
did Alms. Moreover you have there that the Holy ghost fell on them before they
were baptized in water, the which declares openly, that they were justified
before God. This well declares in your own law, whose words be these:
Cornelius Centurion being yet an Heathen man, was made clean by the gift of
the Holy ghost before all good works, for he was an heathen man. D. Barnes.

Look more in Cornelius.

Justified by grace, what it means.
Are justified freely by his grace. Romans 3. 24
This saying does S. Ambrose expound on this wise: They working nothing, nor
acquiting him any whit, are justified by Faith alone by the gift of God. This
word Freely (although many be therewith offended) is also evidently expressed
by Paul himself in these words: Freely without the law, without works, it
is a gift and such like, which thou may mark, for they are all one with
this foresaid exposition of S. Ambrose. By Faith alone we are justified, which
saying signifies thus much, only by the belief wherewith we believe, that
the mercy of God granted in Christ's blood does save us, are we pro^ounced
righteous. The word alone exclude the works, not that thou should not do
them, for unto all good works commanded in the Scripture, art thou bound, and
called to walk in them, and must earnestly study and endeavor thy self to
leave none of them undone: but that thou should in no^ condition think,
that thou art thereby justified or made righteous before God. Tindale.

How this place following is understood.
The doers of the law shall be justified. Romans 2. 13
So must it be understood (says S. Austen) that we may know that they can no
otherwise be the doers of the law, except they be first justified, not that
Justification belongs unto doers, but that Justification does proceed all
manner of doing. Thus by the mind of S. Augustine, we see that Justification is
first given, that men might be able to do the works of the law. This is also
the exposition of the common gloss. D. Barnes.

Against those men which do say they justify others.
Brethren (says S. Austen) we have Jesus Christ our Advocate with our Father,
he is the forgiveness of our sins, he that held this, was in no heresy, he
that held this was in no schism. For whereof came the schisms? Truly when
men do say, we be just: when men do say, we do sanctify them that be unclean,
we do justify the wicked, we do pray, and we do obtain. But what says John?
If a man do sin, we have an Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ, etc. Thus
says he, by which words, he did no more touch the Donatists, then he should
now a days if he were a live, gall them which do so much challenge to
themselves all the authority in the Church, to sanctify and to justify men,
and do for filthy gain, set the same also over unto others. Mus. in his Com.
pla. fo. 224.

How God does justify us.
We said in the first Article of the word of justifying, that to be justified
is as much to say in this matter according to y^ meaning of the Scripture, as
to be acquitted by grace from sin, and to be taken for just. Therefore God
does so justify us, that he forgiueth our sins, he hides them, and does
not charge us with them any more, but does rather impute Justice unto us, not
ours which is none, but the Justice of his Son our Lord Jesus Christ. And by
this imputation of Justice, he makes us saved and blessed. So the Apostle does
four times set forth this Justification to the Romans, least we should seem
to bring any thing with us of our own. Like as David (says he) does express
the blessedness of y^ man, to whom God imputes righteousness without works,
saying: Blessed be they whose wickedness be forgiven, and whose sins be
hidden. Blessed is the man to whom God does not impute sin. It appears
very well that the Justification which is imputed by grace without works is
the forgiveness of sin, and the help unto salvation. For where as he might
have said: Blessed he they whom God does justify without works, he says:
Blessed ^e thou whose sins be forgiven, and whose sins be hidden: Blessed is
the man to whom God does not impute sin. Muscul. fo. 225.

Justifying of the ungodly.
But believes on him that justifies the ungodly. Romans 4. 5.
God is said to justify the ungodly, because he pardons his sins, and of a
wicked man makes him good. The Bible note.

Which makes him that is wicked in himself, just in Christ. Geneua.

Of two manner of Iustifications.
There is two manner of Iustifications Two iustifications.
understood in holy Scripture, the one before God, the other before man. Of
Justification before God, it is truly said of S. Paul. Romans 4. 3. Credidit
autem Abraham, etc. Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for
righteousness. And of Justification before men S. James speaks in the 2.
chapter of his Epistle, verse. 21. Abraham pater noster, etc. Was not our
father Abraham justified through works, when he had offered his son up upon
the Altar, etc. And y^ he so meant, appears by his very words which follows
within few lines after, thus: Credidit autem Abraham, etc. Abraham believed
God, and it was reputed unto him for righteousness, and he was called the
friend of God. Thus we see S. Paul and Lames reconciled, and both teach
Justification by faith, in the sight of God. I. Gough.

How God is justified in us.
To the end (says S. Paul) that all months might be stopped, and all the
world acknowledge it self to be indebted unto God, Romans 3. 19.
and that he only should be justified. After what sort is it, that God shall
be justified in us, according to S. Paul?

To wit, when all of us condemn our selves, and have not the boldness to
strive against God, but do willingly confess, that all of us are indaungered
unto him: if we be once come to that point, then is God justified, y^ is to
say, his righteousness is commended by us, with such praise as he deserves. But
contrariwise, if men exalt themselves, and acknowledge not that they be
indaungered unto God, so as may condemn them, nor confess the bond of debt
which they have forfeited unto him: although they protest that they mind to
justify him (that is to say to confess that he is righteous) yet
nevertheless they condemn him. Call. upon Job. fol. 562.

Look in Works, in Faith that justifies.

How wisdom is justified.
Look. Wisdom,

Objection.
Men will wax remiss in doing good works, if Faith alone justify.

Answer.
In Justification a pardon is granted for sins past, and not of sins to
come. And if any man live wickedly after Justification, without doubt he
dispiseth the grace of justification. For who does dig about the root of a
tree, to the end it should only be a tree, and not rather that it should be a
good tree and bring forth fruit. Origin.

A lively comparison for Justification.
The justifying Faith is, as it were a flame of fire, which cannot but cast
forth brightness. And like as y^ flame burns the wood, without the help of
the light, and yet the flame cannot be without the light so is it assuredly
true, that Faith alone consumes and burns away sin, without the help of
works, and yet that the same Faith cannot be without good works. Wherefore
like as we see a flame of fire that gives no light, we know by and by that it
is but vain and painted: even so when we see not some light of good works in
a man, it is a token, that he has not the true inspired Faith, which God
gives to his elect and chosen, to justify and glorify them withal. And hold
it for a certeintie that S. James meant so, when he said: Show me thy faith by
thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works. Bar. Traheron.

IVSTINVS.
How he suffered martyrdom for the defense of Christ's Religion.
THis man in learning and Philosophy was excellent, and a great defender of
Christian Religion. He exhibited unto the Emperor and to the Senate, a Book
or Apology, in defense of the Christians, and afterward himself also died a
Martyr. He suffered martyrdom in the year of our Lord. 154. vnde^ Antonius
Pius, as the Chronicles do witness. Abb. Vesperg. and Eusebius in his
Chronicle, in the 13. year of the Emperor Antonius. In the bo. of Mar. fo. 58.

What moved him to embrace the faith of Christ.
This Justinius Martyr, when he was an Heathen Philosopher, (as he confesses of
himself) was moved to embrace the Faith and Religion of Christ in beholding
the constant patience of the Martirs, which suffered for Christ in his time.

Keye.
What a Keye is after the mind of S. Austen.
SAint Austen says, that must be called a Keye whereby the hardness of our
hearts are opened unto faith^ and whereby the secretnes of minds are made
manifest. A keye is it (says he) the which does both open the conscience to y^
knowledge of sin, and also including grace, unto the whole sons of
everlasting mystery, and. This is the definition of this keye we speak off
after S. Austen. D. Barnes. fo. 258.

The Law in her right understanding is the keye, or at ye lest way, the first
and principal keye to open the ^ore of the Scripture. Tindale. fo. 184.

What keye had the Doctors of the law, Tertulian
saving the exposition of the law. Tert. cont. Marcion. lib. 4.

The Captains of the Church have the keys of knowledge, Hierom.
to open the Scriptures unto the people to them committed. Therefore
Commandment is given, that the Minister should open, and the scholar should
enter. Hier. in Esa. li. 6. ca. 24.

The keye is the knowledge of the scriptures, Chrisosto^
whereby is opened the gate of turth. Chrysostom in Math. homil. 44.

How the word of God is the right keye.
The word of God is the very keye, and in that is all the might and power to
look our sins, and a man is but a minister and a servant unto this word.
This may be proved by our Master Christ's words, where he says: Go your ways
into all the world and preach the Gospel unto all creatures, and he that
does believe and is baptized shall be saved, but he that does not believe
shall be damned. Here may you plainly see, that the Apostles be but
ministers and servant, and have no power, but all only ministration, etc. D.
Barnes. fol. 259.

How the keys were given unto the Church.
Christ (say they) appointed Peter Prince of the whole Church, Math. 18. 20.
when he promised that he would give him the keys. But that which he then
promised to one, in another place he gave it also to all the rest, Ioh. 20. 23
and delivered it as it were into their hands. If the same power were granted
to all, which was promised to one, wherein shall he be above his fellows?
Herein (say they) he excels, De sim. Cleri.
because he received it both in common. What if I answer with Cipriane and
Augustine, that Christ did it not for this purpose to prefer one man before
other, but so to sett^ out the unity of the Church, for thus says Cipriane,
that God in the person of one, gave the keys to all, to signify the unity of
all, and that the rest were the same thing that Peter was, endued with like
partaking both of honor and power: but the beginning is taken at unity, that
the Church of Christ may be showed to be one. Homil. in John. 50
Augustine says: If there were not in Peter a mystery of the Church, the Lord
would not say unto him, I will give thee the keys, for if this were said to
Peter, the Church has them not: Homi. 11.
but if the Church has them, then Peter when he received them, betokened the
whole Church. And in another place when they were all asked, only Peter
answered, Thou art Christ, and it is said to him, I will give thee the keys,
as though he alone had received the power of binding and loosing, whereas he
being one, said the one for all, and he received the other withal, as hearing
the person of unity. Therefore one for all, because there is unity in all.
Call. 4. book. chap. 6. sect. 4.

How the Dunce men interprets the keys.
Dunce Dunce me^
and all his scholars say, that these keys be nothing else, but an authority
given to the Priests, whereby they give sentence that heaven must be opened to
this man, and shut unto the other: so that heaven is opened and shut, at the
sentence of the Priest.

Saint Hierome is against Dunce, Ma. 16. 19
whose words be these: I shall give thee the keys of heaven, etc. This place
(says Saint Hierome) the Bishops and Priests not understanding, have usurped
unto themselves, somewhat of the Pharesies pride, so that they think they may
condemn innocents, and loose them that be guilty: when before God, not the
sentence of the priest, but the life of the guilty is regarded, etc. Here you
have plainly, that the sentence of the Priest is not looked upon, nor able to
loose a sinner before God. Mark also that S. Hierom says: You understand not
this place. D. Bar. fol. 257.

How the Priests be but the key bearers.
The keye (says Chrysostom upon Math. chapter. 23.) is the word of the
knowledge of the Scriptures, by which the gate of truth is opened unto men. And
the key bearers key berers
are the priests, to whom is committed the word of teaching and interpreting
the Scriptures. Bullinger.

Of the keye of David, or keys of the Church.
Which has the keye of David. Apoc. 3. 7.
That is to say, full power over the throne of David, Key of David.
that is to wit, over the Church. For the Metaphore of keys (not only in the
Scripture, but also by the custom of men) betokens the full authority and
ordering of a kingdom, or a city, or a house. Such as loseph had in the
Realm of Pharao King of Egypt. and Eliakim in the house of the King of Judah,
according as it is said, I will lay the Keye of David's house upon his
shoulder, he shall open, and no man shall shut, and he shall shut, and no
man shall open. Esaias. 22. 22. Even so, CHRIST our Lord being of the seed of
David according to the flesh, has all power in the kingdom of the heavenly
father. For look whom ye father has foreordeined unto salvation, them
receives Christ into his ^locke (that is to say, into his Church) and
thrusts ye rest out of the doors: he opens y^ understanding of his
servants, y^ they may be enlightened and understand the scriptures ye rest he
blinds by his secret (howbeit rightful) Justice. Whereupon he says, All
things are delivered me by my father. Math. 11. 27. And again, All power is
given unto me both in Heaven and in Earth. Math. 28. 18. And the Angel said
to Ma^y, The Lord will give him the ^eate of his father David, and he shall
reign over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his reign there shall be no
end. Luke. 1. 32. To him alone therefore does it pertain to rule the Church,
whereof he is head: which thing he does even now, by the service of his
ministers, to whom he has therefore promised the Keys of the heavenly
Kingdom, to the intent they should set open the way for ye godly unto heaven,
and shut the unbelievers out of heaven, by the preaching of the Gospel. Marl.
upon the Apoc. fol. 60.

To whom the Keye of the Bottomless Pit was given.
And unto him was given the keye of the bottomless Pit. Apoc. 9. 1.
A keye is a token of power or authority and public administration received.
John therefore means, that God in his wrath, has given power to Heretics
and deceivers, to thrust their devilish opinions into the Church. Thou see
openly here (like as in many other places of the Scripture) how it happens
not but by Gods providence, that errors and untruths are brought in to deceive
men withal, whereunto also he gives such force and effectual working, that
they go for good payment, as I said a little before. Therefore we see here,
how power is given to deceivers and heretics to set their errors openly
abroad, and to seduce fond men by vain Philosophy: the doctrine of whom is
rightly lykened to a bottomless pit. For look as no man is able to gage
the ground of a bottomless pit: even so the more a man follows the doctrine
of heretics, so much the less substauncialnesse, and proof shall he find.
And in this place we see the Bishop of Romes Keys, which he boasts off so
greatly. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 126.

How the Popish Prelates have not the keys of heaven, but of hell.
As touching the authority of the keys and censours, no Christian man ought
to esteem Satan (whom men call the Pope) and his unjust censours, more then
the hissing of a Serpent, or the blast of Lucifer. Also that no man ought to
trust or put confidence in the false Indulgences of covetous Priests, which
Indulgences do draw away the hope, which men ought to repose in God, to a sort
of sinful men, and do rob the poor of such alms as is given to them: such
Priests be manifest betrayers of Christ and of his whole Church, and be Satan's
own stewards to be guil^ Christian souls, by their hypocrisy and fained
pardons. Also for so much as those Prelates and Clergy men, live so execrable a
life, contrary to the Gospel of Christ and example of his Apostles, and teach
not truly the Gospel, but only lies, and the traditions of wicked and sinful
men: It appears most manifestly, that they have not the keys of the Kingdom
of heaven, but rather the keys of hell. Keys of hell.
And they may be right well assured, that God never gave unto them authority,
to make and establish so many ceremonies and traditions, which be contrary to
the liberty of the Gospel, and are blocks in Christian men's ways, that they
can neither know nor observe the same his Gospel in liberty of conscience,
and so attain a ready way unto heaven. Book of Mart. fol. 651.

KEEP.
What it is to keep the saiengs of Christ.
HE that loves not me, keeps not my saiengs. Ioh. 14. 24.
To keep the saiengs of Christ is nothing else, but to believe that the same is
true and wholesome, and also to clea^e unto the same with our whole heart: even
as we may gather by the Scripture. Hear O Israel the Ordinances and the
Laws, which I propose unto you this day, that ye may learn them, and take
heed to observe them. If by keeping the Commandments of God, ye understand
the fulfilling of them, no man shall keep them: but i^ y^ understand, for
seeking to fulfill them, then all the godly keep them. For he cannot choose,
but give himself to the keeping of the Commandments of God, which truly
knows the same to be of God. Contrary not to keep the Lords saiengs, is to
reject the doctrine of Christ, and to contemn his commandments, which all
the wicked are wont to do. Marl. upon John. fol. 495.

How this place following, is understood.
I have sinned, Io^. 7. 20.
what shall I do unto thee, O thou keeper of men. Some men expound this, as
though lob should dispute against God, saying: I can do none other but sin,
wherefore have thou made me such a one? If thou be the preserver of men, ^hy
should thou condemn me so, seeing it lies in thee to save me. But a man
may well see, that this is not the natural meaning. And such as take it so,
never knew the intent of the Holy ghost, as touching this streine: and
moreover they have ill considered, y^ which is witnessed unto us concerning
lob, how he was patient howsoever the world went with him. What is it then that
Job meant? It is as if he should say, Well I confess my fault, and I cannot
escape the judgment of God, why so? He is the keeper of men. But this word
Keeper, has been misconstrued: for men have taken it for a preserver of
mankind, and for one that shieldeth them under his protection. It is certain,
that as y^ Greek Translater also has well marked (which thing he is commonly
wont to do) Job meant to say, that God wayteth upon us, that he watches us,
and that he knows all, as if a man should watch one to spy and mark all,
that ever he does and says. We see then in what sense Job applies this title
unto God, that is, The keeper of men. Call. upon Job. fol. 135.

KILL.
How the intent to kill, is worse then the slaughter it self.
BUt ye go about to kill me, John. 8. 40
etc. We are taught by this place, that the mind and purpose to do any work,
is accounted for the work it self? Yea, if thou consider well, the intent to
do any evil thing is worse then the work it self, and the intent to do any
good work is better then the work it self.

Better is the desire to do good to those that are in misery, then the Alms
deed it self. And the intent to kill, is worse then the murder it self. The
Alms deed may be so done, that it may displease God, concerning the which,
read the 5. of Matthew, verse 42. Exo. 32. 28.
A murderous deed may be so done, that it may please God, Nu. 25 7.
as may appear in the Leuiticus, in Phinehes, in Iehu, and so refused that God
may be displeased for the not doing of it, 1. Re. 15. 33.
as we may see in Agag, 3. Reg. 20.
Amalech, whom Saul kept alive. But the desire and intent to do good, cannot
displease God, even as the desire to kill, cannot please him. Marl. upon John
fol. 317

KING.
How, and wherefore we are called Kings and Priests.
AS every perfect believing man in our Savior Christ, are called Priests of
offering of spiritual Sacrifices, Exo. 19. 6.
so are they ^alled Kings, of ruling and subduing the temptations and
suggestions of their sinful appetites unto reason and to the will of God: 1.
Pet. 2. 5. and. 9.
upon the perfourmaunce of this condition, Kings and Priests.
Moses does call us Kings and Priests, saying: If ye will hear my voice and
keep my appointment, ye shall be mine own above all Nations. For all the
earth is mine, ye shall be also unto me, a Kingdom of Priests, and an holy
people. Ric. Turnar,

Of the Kings of Israel and Judah, how many were good.
Of all the kings that reigned over Israel and Judah, there were no mo but
David, Ezechias and Josias, 3. good kings.
that continued perfectly unto the end of their lives, in the true religion of
God, not that these three were men of such perfection, that they did not
notably offend the law of God in their life time. But these were such men,
that they were never infected with the foul sin of Idolatry, and wicked
worshipping of strange Gods. Into other sins in deed they fell, and from
the same by true repentance obtained mercy and forgiveness a^ Gods hand. So
that notwithstanding both the murder and adultery of David, and the foolish
vain glory of Ezechias, that showed all his treasure and all his secrets unto
the Ambassadors of Babylon, for the which Esaias the Prophet did openly reprove
him to his face. Yet otherwise they stood upright, keeping themselves pure and
clean, from the most detestable sin of Idolatry. And therefore David strong
in the arms and amiable of countenance, and Ezechias which by interpretation
is called the health of our Lord, and Josias, Fortitudo Domini, the strength
of the Lord: These three do bear the bell away, and are preferred above all
the Kings of Judah, as we read in the Book of Ecclesiasticus. 40. Chapter,
where their praises are commended to endure to the worlds end. Ric. Turnar.

How Kings have to do in matters of religion.
David commanded Sadoch and Abiathar the Priests, and the Levites, 1. Pa. 15.
11
to bring the Ark of the Lord God, into the place which he had prepared for it.

Solomon displaced Abiathar from the high Priests office, 3. Re. 2. 35
and put Sadoch into his room.

Hear me, 2. Pa. 29. 5
O you Levites, and be sanctified, cleanse the house of the God of your
Fathers, and take away all uncleanness from the Sanctuary. Th^se are not
words of entreatie, but flat commandments, as Lyra says: Ezechia cupiens
renouare foedus, etc. Ezechias desirous to renew the Covenant with the Lord,
first did command the Levites to be sanctified. Second, by them being
sanctified, the Temple to be cleansed. Thirdly, by those which were cleansed,
sacrifice to be made for the offense of the people. Fourthly, by sacrificing,
God to be praised. Fifthly, by cleansing, the holy Burnt-offerings to be
offered up. Thus were all things done by his commandment, by his
constitution, and at his pleasure, etc. I. Bridges. fol. 285.

Nunc mihi debio, Eusebius. li. 3 deui. chris.
etc. I judge it (says Constantine the great) that this ought before all other
things to be my scope, that among the most holy multitude of the Catholic
Church one faith and sincere Charity and godliness agreeing together toward
almighty God, might be conserved. I. Bridges. fol. 117.

Quanto subditorum gloria, etc. How much more (says the king of Spain called
Richardus) we are exalted in royal glory over the subjects, so much more
ought we to be careful in those matters that apperteine unto God. Either to
augment our own hope, or else to look to the profit of the people committed
to us of God. And as ye see me in very deed inflamed with the service of
faith, God has stirred me up to this end, that the obstinacy of infidelity
being expelled, and the fury of discord removed, I should revoke the people
to the knowledge of faith, and to the fellowship of the Catholic Church, who
served error, under the name of religion. These be the words of this christen
king, which he spoke openly in the third counsel at To-let, before all the
Bishops there assembled.

S. Austen says, that the ancient acts of the godly kings, mentioned in the
prophetical books, were signs of the like factes to be done by the godly
Princes in the time of the new testament. I. Bridges. fol. 505.

Of Iosaphats supreme government.
Look. Iosaphat.

Carolus Magnus commanded, In his. 6. bo. 162. ca.
that nothing should be read openly in the Church, saving only the Canonical
books of the holy Scripture. And that the faithful people should receive the
holy Communion every Sunday.

King William Conqueror, at a counsel at Winchester, Polichro.
where the Popes Legate was put down, Fabian.
many Bishops, Abbots and Priors. He gave to Lanfranck, y^ Archbishopric of
Canterbury, and the Archbishopricke of York, unto Thomas a Cauot of Beyon.

King Henry the first, Polichro.
took an oath as well of the Clergy as of the Laity, Fabian.
and swear them unto him, and unto William his son, and made Bishops and
Abbots, etc.

King Henry the second, Math. Paris. Polichro.
made Thomas Becket Archbishop of Canterbury, who thereat was sworn to the
king and to his laws, and to his son.

Edward the first made a statute at North-hampton, Fabian.
that after that time no man shall give, neither sell, nor bequeath, neither
change, neither by Title, assign lands, tenements, neither rents to any man
of religion, without the kings leave.

In the days of king Richard the second, it was enacted against the Pope, that
it should be lawful for no man to try any cause before him, upon pain to
forfait all their goods, and to suffer perpetual prison.

Elentherius the Pope, writing to Lucius king of England, said thus unto him:
Petijstis a nobis, etc. Ye have required of us, Found in the ancient records
of London, remaining in the Guild Hall.
to send the Roman and Imperial laws unto you, to use the same in your
Realm of England. We may always reject the laws of Rome, and the laws of
the Emperor, but so can we not the laws of God: for ye have received through
the mercy of God, the law and faith of Christ into your kingdom, you have
both the Testaments in your Realm: Take out of them by the grace of God, and
advice of your subjects, a law, and by that law through Gods assurance, rule
your Realm, but be you Gods Uicar in that Kingdom. A. G.

How kings do reign by the providence of God.
By me kings reign, Pr^. 8. 15.
etc. Whereby he declares that honors, dignity, or riches, come not of man's
wisdom or industry, but by the providence of God. Geneua.

How the kings hearts are in the hands of God.
The kings heart is in the hands of the Lord, etc. Though kings seem to have
all things at commandment, yet are they not able to bring their own purposes
to pass any other wise then God has appointed, much less are the inferiors
able. Geneua.

How kings were called Nurses.
The king is called of the Prophet the nursing Father, Psa. 49. 23
and the Queens are named Nurses, Nurses.
that although the ministry of feeding perteine to the Ministers, yet the
provision for the food, the oversight that the children of God be duelye fed
with the right milk, with the true bread and water of life, belongs to the
Princes, and therefore have they the name of Nurses, not to nourish children in
civil matters and corporal f^ode only, but as in civil, so in Lacte verbi,
In the milk of the word of God also. Is this only the cherishing of the
good child, by giving lands, reuenews, maintenance, and living to the Church?
Is this only the displing of the froward child, or as ye call it, the
punishing of the heretic. No Master Stapleton, Lyra his exposition and yours
do not agree. He says they are Nurses, what to do? To feed: whom? The
faithful ones: wherewith? With the milk of the word: what word? Even the word
and Sacraments of God. Whereof since the ministry and execution belongs not
unto them, but unto the Ministers: it follows necessary therevppon, that the
provision, direction, appointing, care and oversight, which is the supreme
government, belongs to them.

And this is that which Lyra confesses, and thereby urges of Constantine that
he was such another Nurse, as did keep, defend, maintain, uphold, and feed
the poor faithful ones of Christ, yea, carried them in his bosom as it were,
and procured them to be fed, did set forth Proclamations, not only against
false religion, but also to set forth, to exhort and allure, unto the
christen faith, caused not the Idolatrous religion to be suppressed, but caused
also on the other part, the true knowledge and religion of Christ to be brought
in, and planted among the people, and did not only make laws for punishing
of heretics and Idolaters, but also reformed all manner abuses about Gods
service. Thus says the Bishop out of Eusebius, did Constantine play the
Nurses part. I. Bridges. fol. 622.

Of the kings that served Joshua.
And put your feet upon the necks of those kings. Iosu. 10. ^4.
This was not done of cruelnesse, but to confirm and strengthen the Princes,
and the whole host of Israel, which had not killed all, but suffered some to
fly into Cities: that they should hereafter spare no kings of the
Cananites, whose possessions the Lord gave unto them, in as much as they were
commanded to slaye all. Deuteronomy. 20. 17. T. M.

By this Joshua would encourage his Captains, and signify unto them what
victory they should look for of the rest of their enemies, seeing kings are
thus by them served. The Bible note.

How wicked kings are of God, and not of God.
They have reigned and not by me. Ose. 8. 4.
They were Princes, I knew them not. These words are Gods complaint against
the wickedness of those kings of Israel, that directed not their government
by Gods law, not that they were not kings, but that they were wicked kings,
not that they were by no means ordained of God, for Omnis potestas est a Deo,
All power is of God. And God says in general, Per me reges regnant, Kings
rule by me, so well heathen as faithful kings. Pilates power was from above.
These kings of Israel, Jeroboam, Achab, Iehu, etc. were of Gods ordeining. Yea
Iehu, whose house here GOD complained upon, and said, He and his offspring
reigned not by him, were yet notwithstanding made kings and reigned by him. In
respect of their ambition and private affections, their reign was not of him.
In respect of Gods ordinance, of his justice, of his providence, it was not
only permitted, but also especially appointed of him, as both the Text is
evident, and your own Gloss (meaning the Papists) confesses for Jeroboam ye
elder, y^ it was done by Gods will, although it were done also by the peoples
sin that regarded not the will of God, but followed their own self will.
And so in some respect it was not ye work of God, and yet in other respects it
was the work of God. And so here he expoundes himself and says: I know them
not, not that he was ignorant of them, but he acknowledged not their doings.
Secondly, neither the Prophet Ose, nor any other Prophet, took upon them to
depose any of those wicked kings, but to declare the wrath and vengeance of God
to come upon them, after which declarations, they did not subtract from them
their civil obedience, or counted them from that day forward, no longer to be
their kings, or exhorted the Church of God to forsake their politic
government: but having declared their message from God: they let them alone,
till either God himself did strike them, or stirred up by some especial or
extraordinary means, some foreign or domestical persecutor of them. Thirdly,
this makes nothing to prove that those kings whom the Pope takes upon him to
pronounce, they be no kings, are no longer kings: except he will make himself
God, yea, and above God too. For although God say, they reign not by me, yet
he calls them kings, but the Pope calls them usurpers that reign not by
him. I. Bridges. fo. 1056.

Of two kings, the one secceeding a good Father, the other a wicked.
Manasses being at the age but of xii. years, 4. R^g. 21.
when he succeeded that godly king Ezechias his Father, was no sooner entered
into his kingdom, but the false Prophets of Baal (for lack of good
governors) so be witched, and so far seduced him, that he utterly forsook
all his Fathers ways, to maintain idolatry, witchcraft, sorcery, and such
like wickedness, A good man may have a wicked son, and a wicked man a good
son.
which turned not only to his own perdition, but also to y^ utter desolation
of Jerusalem and Judah, for behold says y^ Lord: Because Manasses has done
such abominations, etc. I will bring such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that
who so hears of it his ears shall tinckle, and I will wipe out Jerusalem,
as a man wipeth a dish, and when he has wiped it, turns it vpside down.
Josias (on the other side) being of the age but of viii. years, when he
succeeded wicked Amon his Father, 4. Reg. 22.
was no sooner entered into his kingdom, but through the special grace of God
and good governors, did that which was right in ye sight of the Lord, and
walked in the ways of David his fore-father, and bowed neither to the right
hand, nor to the left. Wherefore God said to him by his Prophetess, Because
thine heart did melt, and because thou have humbled thy self before me the
Lord, when thou heardest what I spoke against this place, etc. Behold I will
receive thee unto thy Fathers, and thou shall be put into thy grave in peace,
and thine eyes shall not see all ye evils which I will bring upon this place.
These two were both of them young kings, and immediate successors, the one of
Ezechias, who had extirped idolatrye by the roots, and the other to a
worshipper of false Gods, and otherwise also a wicked man. And yet Manasses
through perverse in intifers, fell from GOD to all naughtiness. And Josias
being younger of age then he, did by the help of godly and faithful
Counsailours, apply himself to all godliness, and thereby prospered. N. V.

Tokens of a wicked king or kingdom.
The signs or manifest marks of a wicked king of kingdom, are these: to
teach and suffer to be taught any doctrine, contumelious, injurious,
blasphemous, against God. Tokens of a wicked king.
An other to kill the faithful good preachers and professors of Gods word,
and to take away the Scriptures the food of their souls, from the simple and
poor, thirsting for the word of their salvation, etc. Melancthon upon Daniel.

How a Kings word must stand.
A saying there is among men, that the words, promise, and oath of a king A
kings word.
should stand, and so it ought indeed, in case it be true, lawful, and
expedient, else were it much better to be broken then kept. David made a
solemn oath to slay Nabal, and to destroy all that perteined unto him, but he
never performed that oath, and yet he was a king. He put up his swoorde again
(says Bid) and never repented him of any fault done. Homeli. 45.

Precepts that Hermes the Philosopher gives unto kings.
If a king be negligent in searching the works of his enimyes, and the hearts
and wills of his subjects, he shall not long be in surety in his Realm. The
strength of a king is the friendship and love of his people. The most secret
counsel of a King, is his conscience: and his virtuous deeds are his chiefest
treasures. Ye Kings remember first your King, the governor of all: And as you
would be honored of your subjects, so honor you him. Use no familiarity
with no wicked person. Trust none with your secrets before ye have proved him.
Sleep no more then shall suffice the sustentation of your bodies. Love
righteousness and truth.

Embrace wisdom. Feed measurablye. Reward your trustye friends. Favor your
communaltie, considering that by it your Realms are maintained. Love learned
men, that the ignorant thereby may be encouraged to learning.

Defend the true and just, and punish the evil dooers, that other monished
thereby, may flee the like vices. Cut off the stealers hand. Hang up the
thieves and robbers, that the high ways may be the surer. Burn the Sodomits.
Stone the adulterers. Beware of liars and flatterers, and punish them. Suffer

vngultie. Punish immediatlye such as have deserved it. Follow not your own
wills, but be ruled by counsel, so shall you give your selves rest, and

selves, and also to cause men to (...) from you.

KINGDOM.
What the Kingdom of Heaven is.
THE Kingdom of heaven is nothing else, but a newness of life, by the which
GOD does restore unto us a hope of everlasting blessedness. Marl. upon Math.
fol. 40.

An exposition of this place following.
Let thy kingdom come. Math. 6. 10
That is, that we which before have served the world, hereafter may come under
the dominion of Christ, as he promises. Math. 25. 34.

Or thus: seeing that thou art over all, make all to know thee, and make the
kings and rulers which are but thy substitutes, to command nothing, but
according to thy word, and to them make all subjects obey. Tindale.

How the Kingdom of God is taken two ways.
And speaking of the Kingdom of God. Act. 1. 3.
The Kingdom of God is taken two manner of ways. First it is taken for that
blessedfull life, and for that everlasting felicity, which we shall enjoy
after this mortal life. Secondlye, when by the preaching of the Gospel, the
hearts of the godly are prepared and made the temples of the holy God: It is
said and that right well, That God does reign in the hearts of the godly
through faith, innocencye, and pureness of life. Of this Kingdom did Christ
speak of unto his Disciples. Sir. I. Cheek.

The exposition of this place following.
Thou art not far from the kingdom of GOD. Mar. 12. 34^
That is, thou have the true knowledge of the law, and lackest nothing but
faith and trust in me, by which only comes everlasting life.

The meaning of this place following.
There be some of you that stand here, Luke. 9. 27^
which shall not taste of death till they see the Kingdom of GOD. This
kingdom of God which Saint Mark in the. 9. Chapter, verse ^. writes to come
with power, is the kingdom of Christ, which some of them did then see, which
were Peter, James, and John, which saw in the Clouds the glory of Christ
transformed, and heard the testimony and witness of the Father of heaven, of
Moses and Helias, for then did all those abundantlye testify, that Christ was
a king and the son of God. Tindale.

How the kingdom of God is within us.
For behold the kindome of God is within you. Luke 17. 21
The kingdom of God is to love God with all thy heart, and to put thy whole
trust in him, according to the covenant made in Christ, and for Christ's sake
to love thy neighbor, as Christ loved thee, and all this is within thee.
Tindale.

How Christ's kingdom is not of this world.
My kingdom is not of this world. That is, John. 18. 36
my kingdom is not a worldly kingdom that consists in strength, in
harness, in men, in sword, and in subduing of wordly things, but my kingdom
is spiritual, which is in the hearts of the faithful, that are ruled, not by
the swoorde, but by the Gospel. Tindale.

Quas^ ^ecepti estis, etc. As though he should say, ye are de^ei^ed, for I
hinder not your government in the world.

And so says Lyra, Non querit, etc. He seeks not the temporal government
of this world, etc. My kingdom is not from (...), that is to say, so far as
to get these temporal things. But against this seems that which is spoken in
the Psa. 46. God is the king of all the world, but he is very God as he is
very man, therefore his kingdom is of this world, we must say that according to
the verity of his divinity all things are subject to Christ, notwithstanding
so far as apperteineth to his humanity, he came not in his first coming to
govern temporally, but rather serve and suffer^ and (...) appears that he
sufficiently excludes that that was laid to his charge of usurping the
kingdom of lewrie, because there was no question of him, but in that he was
man, and for the present state that he was in, which apperteyned to his first
coming. I. Bridges. fol. 1012.

Nihil de^ique monstrauit, etc. The exposition of Ludolphus gathered out of
Crisost. and other ancient fathers
He never showed any such thing. He never had soldiers (...) princes, nor
horses, nor burden of mules, nor any such thing about him, but he ^^ad his
life humbly and poor, carrieng about with him 12. ^ase men, according to his
divinity, all things were subject unto him. Howbeit, as touching his humanity
in his first coming, he came not to rule temporally and to reign, but rather
to serve and suffer. Whereupon he denies not y^ he is a king, but rather
grants it. Because according to the truth, he was king of kings. But yet to
take away occasion of escaping, he tempereth his answer, saying, that he
seeks not the temporal dominion of this world, because his kingdom is not
of this world, so far as touching the seeking and having these temporal
things. And therefore his kingdom was neither against the Jews nor y^ Romans,
nor hindered their authority, because they only regarded an earthly kingdom
y^ is of this world, as though he said unto the^: ye are deceived, I hinder not
your Empire in this world, least vainly ye should fear and rag(...), but come
ye to y^ heavenly kingdom by believing, that is not of this world, to the
which by preaching I inuit you. Christ said, My kingdom is not of this world.
But yet notwithstanding, many prelates which are his Uicars, some in their
doing do say the contrary, in pomp making themselves equal to Princes, or
rather exceeding them. I. Bridges. fol. 1014.

KISS.
The understanding of this place following.
Kiss the Son, so reads the Hebrewe. It is a figurative speech, in which
by the sign is understood that which is signified thereby, for by the kiss
of the kings hand, even now a days in many countries, do the subjects
testify, that they will be in the faith and power of a king. He calls him
Son because he before brought in the Father, saying: Thou art my son, etc.
The Greek reads: Receive instruction, or be learned, meaning thereby, that
they should submit themselves unto the king Christ, and receive his
instruction and chastening. T. M.

KNOWLEDGE.
The meaning of this place following.
AND I knew mine. Ioh. 10. 14
In this he commends his love toward us. For knowledge comes of love,
and brings also with it a care. The Lord knows who are his. Also it is
said, John. 13. 18.
I know whom I have chosen. There are two kind of knowledge. The one is by
which we know what a thing is. By this kind of knowledge all things are
known unto Christ, not only the Sheep, but also the Goats, the Wolves, the
Thieves, and the Murderers, and that infernal Satan also. The other is that,
by which we know such as are our own, yea, by which we know them, keep
them, and defend. By this kind of knowledge the reprobates are not known,
but the elect only, for to them it shall be said, Depart from me ye workers
of iniquity. And again, Uerily, verily, I say unto you, I know you not. As
Christ therefore has a special care over his Sheep, because they hear his
voice, and follow him, even so he gives us to understand, that he has no
care at all for those which obey not the Gospel, even as in the second member
he repeateth and confirms that which he had spoken before, namely, that he is
in like manner known of his sheep. Marl. upon John. fol. 371.

How Joseph knew not Marie until, etc.
He knew her not until she brought forth her first begotten son, Math. 1. 25
Ergo after she had brought him forth he knew her. This is Helindius
objection.

Answer.
This word (Did know) in the sacred Scripture, is understood two manner
ways, sometime it is taken for the carnal copulation between man and wife,
and sometime Pro scientia, that is, for knowledge or acquaintance, Helindius
and those of his sect do understand by this word (Know) for the copulation
between man and wife. Whereas it is certain, that it ought to be referred to
acquaintance, and perfect understanding of any thing, for although Joseph
was hand-fasted or betrothed unto Marie, yet the almighty had by visions and
dreams revealed his will unto him, as we heard before in the first Chapter,
where the Angel said, Joseph, Fear not to take unto thee Marye to wife, for
that which is conceived in her comes of the holy Ghost. And in the second
likewise: Arise and take the child and his Mother, and fly into Egypt, and
abide there until I bring thee word. So that the knowledge that Joseph had
was the sure and undoubted faith of those things that were revealed unto him
from above. And that this word (Know) is taken Pro scientia in the Scripture
oftentimes, it appears by this place: The child Jesus abode in Jerusalem,
and his parents knew not of it. Marl. fol. 19.

Of knowing one an other after this life.
When Christ was transfigured, the Apostles, Peter, James, and John, did not
only know Christ, but also they knew both Moses and Helias that talked with
him, notwithstanding they had never seen them before. The rich man being in
hell, knew both Abraham and Lazarus being in joy.

Saint Gregory in his Dialogue says: Li 4. ca. 33
There is a certain thing (says he) in Gods elect and chosen people, which
is to be meruayled at, for they being in Heaven, do not only know them
whom they knew in this world, but they shall know also the good people
which they never saw, even as perfectlye as though they had before both seen
and known them. For when they in that everlasting inheritance, shall see the
auncient^ Fathers, they shall not be unknown to them in sight, whom they
always know in work. For when all there with one cleerenesse do behold God,
what is it that they shall not there know, where they know him that knows
all things.

How the Heathen doubt not in this doctrine.
I have a great desire (said Cato Cato. li. desenectu^e.
the elder) to see your Fathers whom I honored and ^oued. But I wish not
only to talk with them whom I have known in this world, but with such also
as of whom I have heard and read, yea, and I my self have written, If I were
once goinge thetherward, I would never have mind to turn hither again.
Again he says: O that noble and pleasant day when it shall be my chance to
come unto the heavenly company and blessed fellowshippe, and depart from
this troublesome and stinking world, for then shall I go not only to those
men of whom I spoke unto you before, but also unto my Cato, who was as worthy
a man as ever lived, and as noble.

And it is written of Socrates, Socrates.
that when he went unto his death, among many other things, he said, that it is
a most blessed and godly thing for them to come together, which have lived
justly and faithfully. And says he, what a great pleasure think you it to
be, friendly to talk with Orpheus, M^saeus, Homerus, Hesiodus, and such like,
verily I would dye full often if it were possible to get those things y^ I speak
of, etc. Basil.

Look, Luther.

Labans Gods.
How easy Labans Gods were to steal away.
^Herfore have thou stolen away my Gods. Gen^ 31. 30
Chrysostom expounding this complaint of Laban against Jacob for stealing away
his Gods, says thus: Wherefore have thou stolen away my Gods: O what a passing
folly is this: be thy gods such ones, that a man may steal them? And art thou
not ashamed to say, Wherefore have thou stolen away my Gods? This is resembled
to the Sacrament, hanging in the Pixe and Canopy, which be as easy to steal
away, as Labans Gods were.

LABOVRS.
The meaning of this place following.
OTher men labored, John. 4. 34.
and ye are entered into their labors. This ought to be understood of the
preaching of the kingdom of God. Among the Israelites, and among whom the
Prophets had labored already, into whose labors the Apostles did enter. But
when the Apostles did preach among the heathen, they were the first laborers,
as Paul says: I have planted, Apollo has watered. Again, I have laid the
foundation, and an other has builded upon it. 1. Cor. 3. 6. and. 10. Sir. I.
Cheek.

LADDER.
What is signified by this Ladder.
ANd behold there stood a ladder upon ye earth, Genesis 28. 12
y^ top of it reached up to heaven. By this Ladder of many steps is signified,
the degrees of generation, by the which Christ after the flesh descended from
Adam unto the virgin Marie, which brought him forth, which degrees are numbered
in the beginning of Mathews Gospel. Lyra.

It may signify Christ, by whose mediation all graces come down to us, and
all help, and by whom we ascend up into heaven. The Bible note.

Christ is the Ladder, by whom God and man are joined together, and by whom the
Angels minister unto us. All graces by him are given unto us, and we by him
ascend into heaven. Geneua.

LAY MEN.
How lay men ought to read the Scripture.
TAke heed to thy self therefore only, Deuteronomy. 4. 9.
that thou forgette not those things which thine eyes has seen, and that they
depart not out of thy heart all the days of thy life, but teach them thy
sons and thy sons sons.

Hear O Israel, Deuteronomy. 6. 4.
the Lord our God is Lord only, and thou shall love y^ Lord thy God, with all
thy heart, with all thy soul and with all thy might. All these words which I
command thee this day shall be in thy heart, and thou shall show them unto thy
children, and thou shall talk of them when thou art at home in thy house, and
as thou walk by the way, and when thou lie down, and when thou risest up.
And thou shall vinde them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be warnings
between thine eyes, and thou shall write them upon the poasts of thine house,
and upon thy gates, etc.

Thy word is a Lantern unto my feet, Psa. 119. 105.
and a light unto my path.

Blessed is the man that sets his delectation in the will of God, Psalm. 1. 2.
and his meditation on Gods law night and day.

Here men be blessed that study the word of God. D. Barnes.

Take the helmet of health, and the sword of the spirit, Ephe. 6. 17
which is the word of God. Here is it lawful for lay men to have the spirit
of God. D. Barnes.

If any man come to you and bring not this learning, 2. John. 10
receive him not into your house, nor yet salute him.

This was written to a Lady and her children. D. Barnes.

Christ says to the Pharesies, John. 5. 39.
search Scriptures, for in them ye think to have eternal life.

All Scripture given by inspiration of God, 2. Tim. 3. 16.
is profitable to teach, to improve, to inform, to instruct in righteousness,
that the man of God may be perfect and prepared unto all good works.

You may all interpret Scripture one by one, 1. Cor. 14. 34.
that all may learn, and all men may have comfort. But let your women keep
silence in the congregation, etc. If any will learn any thing, let them ask
their husbands at home.

The women was learned belike, for he need not to command them to keep
silence, and if they were unlearned. And also how should the women learn of
their husbands at home, except they were learned themselves. D. Barnes.

The noblest of Thessalonica which received the word, Act. 17. 11
searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things that Paul spoke were
true or no.

Priscilla and Aquila, did expound unto Apollo which was a great learned man,
Act. 18. 26.
the perfect understanding of Scriptures. These were lay persons, of whom this
great learned and eloquent man disdayned not to be taught, nor was not ashamed
to be instructed in the doctrine of Christ, of a poor christen man and his
wife. D. Barnes.

Also Eunuchus that was the treasurer to the Queen of the Aethiopians, Act. 8.
27.
did read Esaias the Prophet, the which he understood not till God sent him
Philip to declare it unto him. That was a lay man also, and an Infidel, and
was not forbidden of God to read Scriptures. D. Barnes.

Let the word of God dwell in you plenteously. Col. 3. 16.


The Doctors affirmations.
My brethren, read holy Scripture, August. ad fra. 6. 38
in the which you shall find, what you ought to hold, and what ye ought to
fly. What is a man reputed without learning, what is he, is he not a Sheep
or a Goat? Is he not an Ox or an Ass, is he any better then an horse or a
mule, the which has no understanding.

It is not sufficient that ye hear the divine Scriptures in the Church,
August. in his. 59. Sermon.
but also in your houses, either read them your selves, or else desire some
other to read them, and give you diligent ear to it.

If thou will that thy children be obedient unto thee, Athanasius in Epis. ad
Ephe. 6.
use them to the word of God, but thou shall not say, that it belongs
only to relygious men to study Scriptures, but rather it belongs to every
Christian man, and specially unto him that is wrapped in the business of this
world, and so much the more because he has more need of help, for he is
wrapped in the troubles of this world: Therefore it is greatly to thy profit,
that thy children should both hear and also read holy Scriptures, for of
them shall they learn this commandment, Honor thy Father and Mother, etc.

I beseech you that you will oftentimes come hither, Chri. in. Genesis ca. 9.
homil. 28
and that you will diligently hear the lesson of holy Scripture. And not
only when you be here, but also take in your hands, when you be at home
the holy Bible, and receive the things therein with great study, for thereby
shall you have great vauntage, etc.

O Paula and Eustochium, Hierom in his Prohe. in Epist. ad Ephesians. li. 2.
if there be any thing in this life that does preserve a wise man and does
persuade him to abide with a good will in the oppressions and thraledomes of
the world, I do reckon that specially it is, the meditations and study of
holy Scriptures, seeing that we do differ from other creatures, specially
in that that we be reasonable, and in that that we can speak. Now is
reason, and all manner of words contained in the Scripture, whereby we may
learn to know GOD, and also the cause wherefore we be created: Wherefore I
do sore marvel, that there be certain men the which give themselves to
slothfulness, and will not learn these things that be good, but reckon
those men worthy to be reproved, that have that good mind. This was written
to two women that were learned. D. Barnes.

Hear me ye men of the world, Chris. upon the Col. in his. 9. Homil.
get you the Bible, that most wholesome remedy for the soul, if ye will
nothing else, yet at the least get the new Testament, Saint Paul's Epistles,
and the Acts, that may be your continual and earnest teachers.

Which of you all that be here (if it were required) could say one Psalm
without the book, Chriso. in Math. 10. 1. Homil. 2.
or any other place of holy Scripture, not one doubtless, but this is not
only the worst, but y^ you be so slow and remiss of spiritual things, and to
diuelishnesse ye are hotter then fire. But men will defend this mischief with
this excuse. I am no religious man, I have a wife and children, and house to
care for, this is the excuse, wherewith ye do (as it were with a pestilence)
corrupt all things, for you do reckon that the study of holy Scripture
belongs only unto religious men, when they be much more necessary unto you
then unto them, etc. Here may we see that this damnable reason (I will read no
Scripture, it belongs not unto me) was in the hearts of lay men in
Chrisostomes days. D. Barnes.

Ye may commonly see, Theodore tus in his 5. book of the nature of man.
that our doctrine is known, not only of them that that are the Doctors of
the Church, and ministers of the people, but also even of Tailers and Smiths,
and Weauers, and of al Artificers: yea, and further also of women, and that not
only of them that be learned, but also of laboring women, and Sewsters, and
servants, and handmaides, neither also the Citizens, but also the country
folks do very well understand the same. Ye may find even the very Ditchers,
and Cowheards, and Gardiners, disputing of the holy trinity, and of the
creation of all things.

How lay men may baptize.
Tertulian Tertulian
in his book De Baptismo, says, That lay men may bapiise.

Ambrose Ambrose.
in the 4. ad Ephesians. says, that in the beginning it was lawful for all men to
baptize.

Hierome ad Luciferanos affirms, that it was lawful for lay men to baptize,
if necessity do require.

Zuinglius affirms the same.

The opinion of John Calvin.
Now (says he) if it be true that we have set down, Call. ca. 17 sect. 16.
the Sacrament is not to be esteemed of his hand by whom it is ministered, but
as it were of the hand of God, from whence it certainly comes. Hereof we may
gather that nothing is added or taken from the dignity of it, by him by whom
it is ministered. And therefore among men, if an Epistle be sent, so y^ the
hand and seal be known, it skilleth not, who or what manner of person
carries it. Even so, it is sufficient for us to know the hand and seal of the
Lord in his Sacraments, by whom soever they be delivered. Here is the error
of the Donatists confuted, who measured the worthiness of the Sacrament, to
the worthiness of the Minister. Such be now a days our Anabaptists, which
deny us to be right baptized, because we were baptized by wicked and
Idolatrous persons in the Popes Church, and therefore they furiously urge
rebaptization, against whose folly we shall be sufficiently defended, if we
think we were baptized in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the
Holy ghost, and therefore Baptime, not to be of man, but of God, by whom soever
it be ministered.

How lay men have ministered the Sacrament.
S. Augustine says, In necessity, Augu. ad Fortunat.
when the Bishop or Priest or any other Minister cannot be found, and the
danger of him that requires does constrain, least he should depart this life
without this Sacrament, we have heard that even lay men has given the
Sacrament that they have received.

Read the story of Serapion.

LAIENG ON OF HANDS.
Whereof this custom of laieng on of hands arose.
THis custom of laieng on of hands, is taken of the old Fathers. For in Genesis
48. 14. The Patriarch Jacob laid his hands upon the head of Manasses and
Ephraim the sons of Joseph, which custom afterward was confirmed to the
Jews for a Law, and so continued till the coming of Christ, who used the
same, and delivered the use thereof unto his Apostles, to the which Ceremony
prayer was then joined. As it does appear in the 19. of Matthew, when children
were brought unto Christ, that he might lay his hands upon them.

That he should lay his hands upon them. Mat. 19. 13
The laieng on of hands, was a familiar sign among the Jews, so often as
there was any solemn kind of prayer or blessing, as when they offered
sacrifice. We have also an example in Isaac more agreeable to the place, when
he laid his hands upon his son Jacob, as though he did consecrate and offer
him to God, that he might be the promised heir. That this was a common
custom among the Jews, it is evident by another example of Jacob, which
blessed the two children of his son Joseph, namely, Ephraim and Manasses. But
they were not wont to lay hands of any man which were not endued with some
notable power and virtue, or set in some high office: Even as the Apostle
takes an argument of the blessing of Melchisedech, which blessed Abraham:
neither does he feign the argument. For it is oftentimes read, that there were
Priests chosen which might bless the people, even as though God were present
to bless himself. The manner of blessing was prescribed unto Moses, by the
mouth of the Lord, when he said: Ye shall bless the Children of Israel, and
say unto them: The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to
shine upon thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee
peace. The like we have also in the 118. Psalm. Seeing therefore that the
laieng on of hands was an ancient solemn order of blessing among the Jews,
it is no marvel if the parents desire Christ to use this ceremony in
blessing their children. Marlor. fol. 425.

By the putting on of my hands, 2. Tim. 1. 6
etc. As in the Baptime, the outward ministry or mystical washing does
regenerate, wash away sins, cleanse and purge us from our filthiness: so
does the imposition or laieng on of hands, give us the gift of the holy Ghost.
But the outward and mystical washing, does only represent unto us, that in
Christ's blood our sins are clean washed away.

When Mathias was chosen by lotte, Act. 1. 23
it is not to be doubted, but that the Apostles after their common manner
prayed for him, that God would give him grace to minister his office truly,
and put their hands on him, and exhorted him, and gave a charge to be diligent
and faithful, and then was he as great as the best. Act. 6. When the Disciples
that believed had chosen vij. Deacons to minister to the Widows, the Apostles
prayed, and put their hands on them, and admitted them without any more ado.
Their putting on of hands was not after the manner of the dumb blessing of our
holy Bishops with two fingers, but they spoke unto them, and told them their
duty, and gave them a charge, and warned them to be faithful in the Lords
business, as we choose temporal Officers, and read their duty unto them, and
they promise to be faithful Ministers, and then are admitted. Neither is there
any other manner or Ceremony at all required in making of our spiritual
Officers, then to choose an able person, and then to rehearse him his duty,
and to give him his charge, and so to put him in his room. Tindale.

And laid his hand upon Ephraims head. Genesis 48. 17
The putting on of hands was commonly used of the Hebrews, when they commended
or offered any thing to God, as Leuit. 1. 4. T. M.

What is meant by laieng ones hand upon his mouth.
Whereas Job says, Job. 39. 37.
he will lay his hand upon his mouth: it is a sign of protestation, that he
will not proceed any further. And y^ manner of speech is rife in y^ scripture.
And it serves to do us to understand, that we must refrain our foolish
appetites. And that when our flesh tickeleth us to speak, we must resist it:
as if it were by putting a mussell or bridle upon our mouths to refrain them.
If a man were so wise of himself, as he would not be tempted to speak amiss,
he should not need to lay his hand upon his mouth, for he would refrain of
his own accord, and he should need neither stop nor bar. But now on the
contrary part, whereas it is said, that we must lay our hand upon our
mouth, is to do us to wit, that we have to fight against our fond lusts and
likings, which do continually make us too hasty in speaking, insomuch that
our tongue shall still be sharp set, to cast forth some thing or other, that
is naught worth, against God, etc. Calvin. fol. 724.

LAMPS.
What the Lamps and Oil do signify.
THe foolish took their Lamps, Mat. 25. 3.
but took none oil with them. By Lamps without Oil, understand works
without faith: which cannot shine because they are without light. Tindale.

These Lamps do signify, all manner of outward things, whereby we are known
to be Christians. The Oil betokens the lively Faith, which works by
unfeigned love and charity. All the whole Parable speaks of true and false
Christians. Sir. I. Cheek.

LAND.
What is meant by the crieng of the land.
BUt if case be that my land cry out against me, Io^. 31. 38.
etc. The land cries against him, when the husbandmen defrauded of their
wages, cry therefore against him: So the hyre of the workman cries. James. 5.
4. And the furrows make lamentation, when they that plowe the ground and make
the furrows, are deprived of their duty. T. M.

LAODICIA.
What the word signifies.
THis City stands in the less Asia, Apoc. 1. 11
not far from Hierapolis and Collossus. Of this City were the Laodicians, of
whom Paul has spoken somewhat. Coll. 4. 13. and 16. And this word Laodicia
signifies by interpretation, a righteous people. Marl. fol. 20.

Of the strife that was in Laodicia, for the keeping of Easter.
Melito the Pastor of the Church that was at Sardis, makes mention in his
book of the Passover with these words: Under Sergius the Uice-president of
Asia (says he) at what time Sagadis was crowned with Martyrdom, there arose a
great strise at Laodicia about the keeping of the Easter, etc. Read Eusebius in
the 26. chapter of his fourth book of Church matters, and concerning Socrates,
Eusebius, Anatolius, Stephanus and Theodorus Bishops of the same Church, look
the same Eusebius in the 28. and 29. chapters of his seventh book of Church
matters. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 66.

LAST.
Of the last day.
Look. Day.

Who be the last, and who be the first.

He tak^th away all desperation from the greatest sinner. Whom the good man of
ye house may call into his vineyard to be a labourer when he will, and give him
eternal life, as to the thief hanging on the Cross, which deserved no such
thing. Do we not see, that the Jews boasting themselves in the law to be
last, and to be rejected?

And that the Gentiles which were last, are now become first, and most
acceptable unto God, to whom he has given repentance unto life, etc. Marl.
fol. 440.

Look more in this word, First.

Of the last farthing.
Look. Farthing.

LATRIA.
What this word Latria, signifies.
LAtria (after the mind of Dunce) is called an exterior honoring, or a
bodily service, etc. If that be true, it follows that they give that honor
to stocks and stones, that only pertains to God, which do any exterior
honor, whatsoever it be. This word Latria. wherewith the simple people be
deceived, is a Greek word and after S. Austen, it signifies no more but
service, which cannot be denied is given to stocks and stones. Think you that
the Children of Israel with their high Priest Aaron could not have made this
Pope holy excuse, that they were not so mad nor so foolish as to honor the
golden Calfe, but rather to refer the honor to the living God, they had a
good color for them, for they knew none other God nor Saint but him, and yet
this excuse was not lawful nor could be allowed, when Moses came with the word
of God. Mark also what he was that made the Calfe, not a fool nor ignorant
person among the people, or one of no authority: but the most wisest man,
eloquent and chief among them, which was to keep the people together in good
order. He also made a Calfe, with y^ which thing all their Fathers had pleased
God in doing Sacrifice with them: So that they might well think that it might
be acceptable to God, to be honored in the Image of a Calfe, before any
other Image. But all these colors is naked before the word of God. D. Barnes.

LAW.
What the Law is, and what is to be understood thereby.
THe law (says Justinian) is a faculty or science of the thing that is good
and right, as Celsus there defines. Or thus: The law is a certain rule or
Canon to do well by, which ought to be known of all men. Cicero de lege
says, that the Law is a certain rule proceeding from the mind of God,
persuading right and forbidding wrong. So that the Law is a certain rule, a
directory, showing what is good, and what is evil, what is virtue and what is
vice, what profitable, and what disprofitable, what to be done, and what to be
left undone.

The Law is a doctrine that bids good, and forbids evil, as the
Commandments do speak. Book of Mar. fol. 1110.

This word (Law) may not be understood here after the common manner, as to
use Paul's terms, after the manner of men, or after man's ways, that thou
would say, the Law here in this place were nothing but learning, which
teaches what ought to be done, and what ought not to be done, as it go^th with
man's law, where the law is fulfilled with outward works only, though the
heart be never so far off, but God judges after the ground of the heart,
yea, the thoughts of the secret moouings of the mind. Therefore his law
requires the ground of the heart, and love from the bottom thereof, and is
not content with the outward works only, but rebukes those works most of
all, that spring not of love from the low bottom of the heart, though they
appear outward never so honest and good. As Christ rebukes the Pharisees
above all other that were open sinners, and calls them hypocrites, that is to
say, Simulars and painted Sepulchers, which Pharesies yet lived no men so pure
as pertaining to the outward deeds and works of the law. Yea, and Paul in
the third Chapter of his Epistle to the Philippians, confesses of himself
that as touching the law he was such a one, as no man could complain on, and
notwithstanding was yet a murderer of the Christen, persecuted them, and
formented them so sore, that he compelled them to blaspheme Christ, and was
altogether merciless, as many which nowfaine outward good works are. Tindale.

We understand by the law, these commandments only which God gave by Moses
in two Tables of stone, wherein is comprehended all the rest of the doctrine of
God, contained in the holy Scriptures. The good things which God allows and
requires of us, which we are bound to do, and the evil that displeases him,
which we ought not to follow, and beside that, it shows us our offenses and
sins, and how we stand debtors unto the judgment of God, and preaches unto
us nothing else, but the very wrath and curse of him, which we have deserved in
offending of him. By ye law we are all condemned before God, as transgressors
of all his commandments, and thereby declared worthy of death and eternal
damnation. So that the law serves rather to condemn then to save us. And yet
there is no fault in the law, which is good, holy, and just, but the fault is
in us, which are wicked of nature, and do not accomplish the law. The law does
utter our sins, and shows us plainly our disease, and how dangerous it is
(as the Physicians does) but it cannot heal us, but sends us to another,
which is able to heal our disease and none but he, one Christ Jesus our Lord.
The law is divided into two parts: The first Table 1. Table.
pertains to God, which is this: Thou shall have none other Gods but me: Thou
shall make thee no Image, nor likeness, etc. Thou shall not take the name of God
in vain, etc. Remember to sanctify the Sabbath day, etc. The other Table
pertains to our neighbor, which are these: Honor thy father and thy mother,
etc. Kill not: Commit none adultery: Steal not: Bear no false witness against
thy neighbor: Covet not thy neighbors house, nor his wife, etc. And all the
doctrine comprised in these two Tables, 2. Table.
Christ reduced into ij. points, which are these: Love God above al things, and
thy neighbor as thy self: for all ye law and the Prophets depend upon these.
ij. commandments: Then whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye
the same unto them. P. Viret.

Platoes definition of the Law.
Plato Plato.
in his Book of Laws of a Public wealth, and in Minos, seems thus to
define the law, namely, That it is an upright manner of governing, which by
convenient means directs unto the best end, in setting forth pains unto
the transgressors, and rewards unto the obedient. This definition may be
most aptlye applied unto the Law of God, yet there can be no such Law, unless
it be of God. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 137.

What the office and use of the law is.
The use and end of the law is, Use of the law.
to accuse and condemn us guilty, such as live in security, that they may
see themselves to be in danger of sin, wrath and death eternal, that so they
may be terrified, and brought even to the brinke of desperation, trembling and
quaking at the falling of a leaf. And in that they are such they are under the
law, for the law requires perfect obedience unto God, and condemns all
those that do not accomplish the same. Now it is certain that there is no man
living which is able to perform this obedience, which notwithstanding, God
straightly requires of us. The law therefore justifies not, but condemns
according to that saying. Cursed is he that abides not in all things that are
written in the law. Therefore he that teaches the law, is a minister of the
law, etc. Luth. upon the Gal. fol. 69.

What the law of nature is.
The law of nature is, Law of Nature.
that light and judgment of reason, whereby we do discern betwixt good and
evil. Thomas Aquinus says, that the law of nature is nothing else, but the
perticipation of the eternal law in a reasonable creature. That definition
indeed does express unto us, of whom this judgment and light of reason
comes unto us, that is to say, from the eternal law: but what it is, it
declares not. And that part in a reasonable creature, may comprise also
Angels, of whose nature, here is nothing in question. Other do define this
law more largely in this sort: The law of nature is the common sentence of
judgment, whereunto all men together assent and further, which God graued in
every man's mind, appointed to frame men's manners withal, etc. Musc. fol. 30.

What the law written is.
We call that the law written, Law written.
which God gave to Israel by Moses, and which Moses comprehended in his book
of Exodus and Leuiticus, Numery and Deuteronomy. This was delivered unto Moses
by Angels, and Steven witnesses saying: Ye have received the law by the order
of Angels. And the Apostle says, The law is given by Angels, in the hand of
a Mediator. The same they do commonly divide, and well enough for the
purpose, into the Moral precepts, Judicial and Ceremonial: or into precepts,
statutes and judgments. Moral law.
By statutes, they understand all that pertains unto rites and ceremonies: by
Moral precepts, the Tables: by Iudicialls, Iudicialls.
all those laws which they use in the matters and controversies of the
policies, and for punishment of the offenders. Musculus. fol. 34.

How the Law is our schoolemaister.
The schoolmaster is appointed for the child, to teach him, to bring him up,
and to keep him as it were in prison, but to what end, and how long? Is it to
the end that this straight and sharp dealing of the schoolmaster
schoolemaister.
should always continue? Or that the child should remain in continual
bondage? Not so, but only for a time, that this obedience, this prison and
correction might turn to the profit of the child, that in time, he might
be heir and Prince. For it is not the fathers will, that his son should
always be subject to the schoolemaister, and always beaten with rods, but
that by his instruction and discipline, he may be made able and meet to be his
fathers successor. Even so the law (says Paul) is nothing else but a
schoolmaister, not for ever, but till it have brought us to Christ: as in other
words he said also before. Gal 3. 24.
The law was given for transgressions, Gal. 3 19
until the blessed seed should come. Also the scripture has all under sin.
Again: we were kept under and shut up unto faith, which should after be
revealed, wherefore the law is not only a schoolemaister, but it is a
schoolemaister to bring us unto Christ. What a schoolemaister were he, which
would always torment and beat the child, and teach him nothing at all? And
yet such schoolemaisters were there in time past, when schools were nothing
else but a prison and a very hell, the schoolmaisters cruel tyraunts and very
butchers. The children were always beaten, they learned with continual pain
and travail, and yet few of them came to any proof. The Law is not such a
schoolemaister, for it does not only terrify and torment (as the foolish
schoolmaister beats his scholars and teaches them nothing) but with his rods
he drives us to Christ: like as a good schoolemaister instructs and
exercises his scholars in reading and writing, to the end they may come to
the knowledge of good letters and other profitable things, that afterward they
may have a delight in doing of that, which before when they were constrained
thereunto, they did against their wills, etc. Luther upon the Gal. fol. 163.

How the law first entered.
The law entered The laws entering
first into the world, by man's disobedience in Paradise, and was not so much
given by Gods own free motion, as by man's own seeking and wilful procuring,
which never was, nor never shall be, in his power to perform. Fox. in his
sermon of Christ crucified.

How the law was given in thunder.
The law was given in thunder, lightening, fire, smoke, and the voice of a
trumpet and terrible sight. Exo. 20. 18. Exo. 20. 18
So that the people quaked for fear, and stood a far off, saying unto Moses:
Speak thou unto us, and we will hear, let not the Lord speak to us, least we
dye. No ear (if it be awaked and understand the meaning) is able to abide the
voice of the law, except the promises of mercy be by. That thunder, except
the rain of mercy be joined therewith, destroieth all, and builds not. The
law is a witness against us, and testifies that God abhors the sins that
are in us, and us for our sins sake. Tindale. fol. 118.

The ceremonial and judicial laws, were revealed of God to Moses, by the
Angels, and by Moses to the people, and by Moses at Gods commandment they
were inserted into a written book. But the law of the ten commandments was
not revealed by man, Law of the 10. co^. written by God and not by Moses.
or any means of man, but by God himself at the mount Sina, and written, not
by the hand of Moses, but with the finger of God in tables, not made of matter,
easy to be dissolved, but made of stone to endure for ever. Bull. fo. 111.

Wherefore the law was given.
The law was given (says S. Austen) that man might find himself, and not to
make his sickness whole, but by his preaching the sickness increased, the
Physician might be sought. Wherefore the law threatening and not fulfilling
that thing that he commands makes a man to be underneath him. But the law is
good if a man use it well. What is that to use the law well? By ye law to know
our selves, and to seek Gods help to help our health. Here we see by S.
Austen, that the commandments of God gives us no strength, nor yet declares
any strengh to be in us, but shows us our duty and weakness, and also
moves us, and causes us to seek further for strength. D. Barnes.

Of profiting to crave the grace of Gods help, Augustine speaks often, as
when he writes to Hilary: The law commands that endeavoring to do the
things commanded, and being wearied with our weakness under the law, Law
impossible.
we should learn to ask the help of grace. Again to Aselius: The profit of
the law is to convince man of his own weakness, and compel him to crave ye
Physic of grace which is in Christ. Again, to Innocent of Rome: The law
commands, and grace ministers strength to do. Again, to Valentine, God
commands these things y^ we cannot do, that we may learn to know what to
ask of him. Again, The law was given to accuse you, that being accused, ye
should fear, and fearing, you should cra^e pardon, and not presume of your
own strength. Again, The law was given for this purpose, of great, to make
little, to show that thou have no strengh of thine own to righteousness: that
thou as poor, unworthy and needy, should fly unto grace. After he furneth
his speech to God and says: Do so Lord, do so merciful Lord command that
which cannot be fulfilled: yea, command that which cannot but by thy grace be
fulfilled: that when men cannot fulfill it by their own strength, every mouth
may be stopped, and no man may think himself great. Let all be little ones,
and let al y^ world be guilty before thee. Ca. in his In. 2. b. ca. 7. se. 9.

How the law was given by Moses.
The law was given by Moses, By Moses
but grace and verity came by Jesus Christ. This place does Tindale in his
exposition of the 5. 6. and 7. of S. Matthew, expound on this wise. Though Moses
(says he) gave the law, yet he gave no man grace to do it nor to understand
it aright, or wrote it in any man's heart to consent that it was good, and to
wish after power to fulfill it: But Christ gives grace to do it, and to
understand it aright, and writes it with his holy spirit in the tables of the
hearts of men, and makes it a true thing there and no hypocrisy. Folio. 184.

How we are dead through the law.
But I through the law, am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. Gal.
2. 19
But I through the law, am dead Dead
to the law, that is, by the law of liberty and grace granted in Christ, I
am delivered from the law of bondage, ministered by Moses, and from the burden
and curse thereof. Tindale.

Are dead concerning the law, by the body of Christ. Because the body of
Christ is made an offering and a sacrifice for our sins, Romans 7. ^.
whereby God is pleased, and his wrath appeased for Christ's sake, the Holy
Ghost is given to all believers, whereby the power of sin is in us daily
weakened: we are accounted dead to the law, for that the law has no dominion
over us. The Bible note.

Look. Under the law.

How the Law increases sin.
But the law in the mean time entered in, that sin should increase. Romans 5.
20
The law increases sin, Sin.
and makes our nature more greedy to do evil, because the law ministers no
power nor lust to y^ the bids, or to refrain from y^ the forbids. Tin.

Why the law is called the messenger of death.
The law is called the messenger of death: Messenger of death.
namely, because that if we have no more, but the doctrine that is contained in
the law, we shall be utterly overwhelmed before God, and we shall be cast away
without any remedy. Then if God indite us but according to the form of y^
law, he shall discover filthiness enough in us. Call. upon Job. fo. 172.

What the law of God requires.
The law of God requires love Love.
from the bottom of the heart, and cannot be satisfied nor fulfilled with the
works thereof as man's law is, for the law is spiritual as S. Paul says
Romans 7. Romans 7. 14
which no earthly creature by his own strength and enforcement is able to
fulfill, but by the operation and working of the spirit of God. Tindale.

What it is to be under the law.
To be under the law, Under the law.
is to deal with the works of ye law, and to work without the spirit and
grace, for so long no doubt, sin reigns in us through the law, that is to
say, the law declares that we are under sin, and that sin has power and
domination over us, seeing we cannot fulfill the law, namely, with the heart,
forasmuch as no man of nature favors the law, consents thereunto, and
delights therein, which thing is exceeding great sin, y^ we cannot consent
to the law, which law is nothing else but the will of God, etc. So that to be
under the law, is not to be able to fulfill the law, but to be debtor to it,
and not able to pay that, which the Law requires, etc. Tindale.

To be under the law, is nothing else, but to be bound or subject unto sin,
for the law through sin, condemns us, as guilty. But to be dead unto the
law, Dead to the law.
is nothing else, but to have that extinguished in us, by which the law accuses
and condemns us, and that is, the old man, the flesh, natural lust and
corruption of nature: when these things be once dead in us, and that Christ
lives and reigns in us, we can by no means be condemned by the law, etc.
Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 161.

What it is, not to be under the Law.
Not to be under the law, Not under the Law.
is to have a free heart renewed with the spirit, so that thou have lust
inwardly of thine own accord, to do that which the law commands, without
compulsion: yea, though there were no law. Tin. in his pro. to the Romans

Why Paul calls the book of Genesis the law.
Tell me, ye that would be under the law, etc. Gal. 4. 20
Why does Paul call the book of Genesis out of the which he alleges the
history of Ismael and Isaac, Book of Gene. called the Law.
the Law, seeing that book contains nothing at all concerning the law, but
only contains a plain history of Abraham's two children? Paul is wont to
call the first book of Moses the law, after the manner of ye Jews, which
although it contain no law besides the law of circumcision, but the
principal doctrine thereof is concerning faith, and that Patriarks pleased God
because of their faith, yet ye Jews notwithstanding, only because of the law
of circumcision which is there contained, called the book of Genesis the law,
as well as the other books of Moses, so did Paul himself also being a Jew.
And Christ under the title of the law, comprehends not only the books of
Moses, but also the Psalms. Psa. 35. 19
John. 15. 25. But it is that the words might be fulfilled which were written in
the law, They hated me without a cause. Luther upon the Gal. fol. 205.

How the law is impossible for a man to fulfill.
The Pelagians (says S. Austen) think themselves cunning men, Law impossible.
when they say, God would not command that thing that he knows a man is not
able to do, and who is there that knows not this? But therefore God
commands us to do some thing that we are not able to do, that we may
understand, what we ought to crave of him. Jewel. fol. 3^7.

And the law had righteousness, but for a time, not because it could justify
before the Lord, Ambrose ad Gal. (...)
for it could not so forgive sin, that of sinners it could make them just.
But to this end it was given, that it might be a terror provoking men to a
godly life, punishing the disobedient and vnreuerent persons. Therefore is not
a law given which can give life, but condemn. I. Gough.

How the law is called a yoke.
Why tempt ye God, Act. 15. 10
to put on the disciples necks that yoke, Yoke
which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear. He means the holy law,
and not the ceremonies only, and calls it a yoke not able to be borne,
because no man, not the most holiest and perfectest that ever was (Christ only
excepted) was able to perform the same in all points, both outwardly
according the Letter, and inwardly according to the Spirit. The Bible note.

The difference between Gods law and man's.
Man's law only requires external and civil obedience, God and man's law
Gods law, both external and internal.

Who has fulfilled the law.
Christ is the end of the law, Romans 10. 4
for righteousness to all that believe. That is, Christ has fulfilled the
whole law, Law fulfilled.
and therefore whosoever believes in him, is counted just before God, as well
as he had fulfilled the whole Law himself. The Bible note.

The end of the law, End of the law.
is to justify them which observe it: therefore Christ having fulfilled it for
us, is made our Justice, sanctification, etc. Geneua.

How the Gentiles were not without a law.
Whosoever has sinned without law, Romans 2. 12
etc. It is not to be thought that the Gentiles were altogether without a law,
for they had the law of nature, Gentiles had the Law of Nature
but not the law written, which we call the Ten commandments, therefore they
cannot excuse themselves from sin. Sir. I. Cheek.

How the law makes all men sinners.
Whatsoever the law says, Romans 3. 19
it says it to them which are under the law, etc. In this place the law is
taken for all the holy scripture, as it appears by these places and
testimonies that be alleged here before, whereby it is made evident and plain,
that all men without exception are sinners. Sinners
Sir. I. Cheek.

The law does not make us guilty, but does declare that we are guilty before
God, and deserve condemnation. Geneua.

How the law makes us to hate God.
In the faith which we have in Christ, find we mercy, life, favor and peace:
in the law we find death, damnation and wrath, moreover the curse and
vengeance of God upon us. And it (that is to say the law) is called of Paul
the ministration of death and damnation. In the law we are proved to be the
enemies of God, and that we hate him. For how can we be at peace with God and
love him, seeing we are conceived and born under the power of the devil, and
are his possession and kingdom, his captives and bondmen, and led at his will,
and he holds our hearts, so that it is impossible for a man to fulfill the
law of his own strength and power, seeing that we are by birth and nature,
the heirs of eternal damnation, etc. Tind, in his book named the wicked
Mammon. fol. 6.

How the law is spiritual.
The law is spiritual. Romans 7. 14
The law is called spiritual, Law spiritual.
because that it requires the spirit, that is to say, the righteousness and
holiness of the heart, and not the outward works only.

How we dye to the law.
For I through the law, Gal. 2. 19
am dead to the law. The law that terrifieth the conscience, brings us to
Christ, and he only causes us to dye to the law Dye to the law.
indeed, because y^ by making us righteous, he takes away from us the terror
of conscience, and by sanctifieng us, causes the mortifieng of lusts in us,
that it cannot take such occasion to sin, by the restrint which the law
makes, as it did before. Romans 7. 10. 11.

For I through the law am dead to the law, that is, by the law of liberty
and grace granted in Christ, I am delivered from the law of bondage ministered
by Moses, and from the burden and curse thereof. Tindale.

To dye in the defense of the law.
If we do praise (says S. Austen) the Machabees, and that with great admiration,
because they did stoutly stand unto death for ye laws Dye for the law.
of their country, how much more ought we to suffer al things, for our baptime,
for y^ sacraments of the body and blood of Christ.

The meaning of these places following.
Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which Gal. 3. 10.
are written in the book of the law to do them. All the which (meaning the
things contained in the law) since no man does fulfill them, No man fulfilleth
the law.
it is manifest that no man can be justified by the words of the law. No man
is justified before God, because (says S. Hierome) no man keeps the law:
therefore it is said that the believers must be saved by faith only. Moreover
he will show, that no man can be justified by the works of Moses law,
unless he have faith, which gives pardon to him that believes in God:
neither yet, he that believes in Christ, lives without a law. D. Heynes.

And I say, Gal. 4. 1.
the heir, Heir.
as long as he is a child, etc. While we were yet younglings, we had need of
the law, as our tutours, not that it should always rule us, but so long till
we come to man's state, and have the knowledge of Christ, which knowledge when
we have, we be delivered from the servitude of the law, for Christ's sake, not
for fear of punishment abstaining from evil, but led by the spirit of God, we
are prepared and made fit, to fulfill all good works which the law commands.
D. Heynes.

The Church of Israel was under the law as the Pupil subject to his Tutor,
even unto the time of Christ, when she waxed strong, and then her pupilship
ended. Geneua.

Look before where the Law is our schoolemaister.

An Argument of the Law.
If I cannot have my sins forgiven me, Argument.
except I keep and fulfill the law, then the keeping of the law justifies
me.

Answer.
I cannot have forgiveness of my sins, except I have sinned, Ergo to have
sinned, is the forgiveness of sins. Tindale.

A disputation between the Law and the Gospel.
The Law says, Law and Gospel.

The Law says, thou art a sinner, despair and thou shall be damned: the
Gospel says, thy sins are forgiven thee, be of good comfort thou shall be

The Law says, the father of heaven is angry with thee: the Gospel says

The law says, where is thy righteousness, thy goodness and satisfaction: the
Gospel says, Christ is thy righteousness, thy goodness, and satisfaction.

LAZARUS.
How the poor and rich are matched together.
RIches are not condemned in themselves, as we see how our Lord Jesus Christ
has showed us, by matching the poor and the rich together in the kingdom of
heaven, when he speaks of Lazarus in S. Luke. He says there, that the Angels
carried Lazarus: for albeit he was an outcast among men, and a poor creature
of whom no account was made, insomuch that he was forsaken of all men: yet
nevertheless behold how y^ Angels carry his soul into Abraham's bosom. And
what was this Abraham? A man rich both in cattle and money, and in householde,
and in all other things saving houses and lands, for these were not lawful for
him to have, because it behooved him to tarry Gods leisure, till he gave him
the land of Canaan to inherit. True it is that he purchased a burieng place,
but he had not any inheritance, notwithstanding that his moueables were very
great. Therefore when we see the soul of Lazarus carried by the Angels into
the bosom of Abraham, who is the Father of the faithful: we perceive that God
of his infinite grace and goodness calls both rich and poor unto salvation.
Call. upon Job. fol. 7.

Of the loosing of Lazarus.
Loose him and let him go. Ioh. 11. 44
This was commanded to be done, to amplify ye glory of the miracle, y^ the
Jews might feel with their hands the work of God which they saw with their
eyes. For he which had sent away death with the power of his word, could either
have made the grave clothes to have fallen of by their own accord, or else y^
Lazarus should have vnwound himself. But Christ would have ye hands of ye
standers by, to be witness of the same. But too rediculous are y^ Papists,
which upon this place ground their auricular confession. Christ (say they)
would have Lazarus after he had restored him to life, to be loosed by his
disciples: therefore it is not sufficient for us to be reconciled to God, except
the church also forgive us our sins. But whereupon do they define and gather
that the office of loosing Lazarus was enioined the disciples, we rather gather
by ye text, that it was enjoined the Jews, to ye end they might have all
scruple of doubting taken from them. Therefore this place serves no more their
turn for auricular confession, then does y^ othere of the ten lepers, in ye
17. chapter of Luke, the which also they have shamefully abused. Marl. upon
John. fol. 419.

LEFT HAND.
What the left hand of God does signify.
AS the right hand is taken for everlasting life, so does ye left hand signify
the torments of the wicked.

LEGION.
What a Legion is.
Every Legion contained commonly. Mat. 26. 53.
6000. footmen, and. 732. horsemen, whereby here he means, an infinite
number.

LEAGVE.
What a League is.
A League is that bond between men, whereby enterchaungeably they testify
both by words and signs, that they are bound to perform certain things, so
that they handle together with good faith. And if it be a bond and pertains
to relation, it is grounded upon human actions, and is referred to those
things which ye parties considerated ought to perform y^ one to the other^ It
is expressed by words, and for the most part signs are added. God when after
the flood he made a league with mankind, he did not only declare the form of
y^ obligation by words, Genesis 9. 13.
but also he put the rainebow in y^ clouds as a witness. And in the league
which he made with Abraham, Genesis 17. 10
he put the sign of circumcision. Furthermore, in that which was made by Moses
at the mount Sinai, Exo. 24. 4
there were twelve pillars erected, and the people was sprinkled with blood.
Joshua also when he should dye, I^s^. 24. 26
erected up a very great stone, thereby to seal the league, renewed between
the people and God. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 73.

Of three kind of leagues.
There are three kind of leagues: The first kind is, when the conquerours set
laws to those whom they have conquered, in punishing them, and commanding
them, what they will have them afterward to do. The second kind is, when
things being yet sound, and neither part overcome, they common togethers that
things taken from the one part, may be restored, and couenaunts of peace may
be established. The third kind is, when there is no war between the
parties, and certain Princes or cities are joined together by some couenaunts,
either to live the more peaceably, or else to take in hand some common affairs,
etc. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 73.

LEND.
Look. Usury.

LENT.
Whereupon the Lenten fast was grounded.
THere is none other cause of this fasting, the^ of y^ which Moses fasted, when
he received the law at the hands of y^ Lord. For since y^ miracle was showed in
Moses to stablish the authority of ye law, it ought not to have been omitted
in Christ, least the Gospel should seem to give place to the law. But since
that time it never came in any man's mind under color of following of Moses,
to require such a form of fasting in ye people of Israel. Neither did any of
ye holy prophets and fathers follow it, when yet they had mind and zeal
enough to godly exercises, for that which is said of Helias, that he fasted
forty days without meat or drink, tends to none other end, but that the
people should know, that he was stirred up to be a restorer of the law, from y^
which almost all Israel had departed. Therefore it was a more wrongful zeal and
full of superstition, y^ they did set forth fasting with the title and color of
following Christ. Howbeit, in the manner of fasting, there was then great
diversity as Cassiodorus rehearses out of So^rates in the ninth book of his
history. For the Romans (says he) had but three weeks, but in these three
was a continual fasting, except on the Sundaie, and Saturday. The Slauonians
and Grecians had six weeks, other had seven. But their fasting was by
divided times, and they disagreed no less in difference of meats. Some did
eat nothing but bread and water: some added herbs: some did not forbear fish
and foul: some had no difference in meats. Of this diversity Augustine also
makes mention in the latter Epistle to January. Calvin in his Insti. 4. b.
chap. 12. Sect. 20.

Why the Fathers instituted Lent.
The Fathers when they saw men live very carelessly and negligently, thought it
good that they should be compelled after a sort to renew godliness in some
part of the year, and somewhat to bridle ye fiercenes of y^ flesh. And for this
thing they thought that the forty days before Easter were most meet, that men
should so long have their minds both occupied in repenting, and also in
remembering y^ benefits of God. This invention although at the first sight it
might seem trim, yet it agrees not with Christ's liberty. For we must think
upon the benefits of God, and our great ingratitude, and other most grievous
sins, not only forty days, but also continally. Further, by this means
they opened a most wide window to live securely and rechlye. For if they once
had performed fullye these forty days, they thought that all the whole year
after they might give themselves wholly to all kind of pleasures and lusts. For
they referred the time of repentance to these forty days. And although the
elders had a Lent, yet as Eusebius says in his. 5. book, and 24. Chapter) it
was left free unto all men. For Ireneus after this manner, entreated with
Victor Bishop of Rome, when he would have excommunicated the East Church,
because in the observing of Easter, it agreed not with the Church of Rome: What
(says he) can we not live at concord, although they use their own cities as
we use ours: for some fast in Lent two days, some four days, some x. days,
some fifteen days, some twenty, and other some forty days. And yet is
concord nevertheless kept in the Church. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fo. 279.

LEPER.
What the Leper signifies.
THe Leper signifies properly man's doctrine, Leuit. 13.
which spreads abroad like a canker. And to be short, all infection of
ungodliness, therefore must the Levites give diligent heed thereto: for a
little leaven sowreth all the whole lump of dowe. T. M.

He (meaning the Priest) shall judge the plague to be clean. Leuit. 13. 13^
For it is not that contagious leper that infecteth, but a kind of scurffe,
which makes not the flesh raw, as the leprosy does. Geneua.

Of the leprosy in clothes which was used among the Jews, Leui. 13. 45
let them judge. This is evident, that we in our time suffer over many
leprosies in clothes. Clothes.
T. M.

The leprosy in houses, Leui 14. 34^ Houses.
is any thing thereto perteining, whereby the dweller might take any harm in
health of body, in hurting of his goods, or otherwise as if it stood in an
evil air. T. M.

If I send the plague of leprosy in an house, Leui. 14. 34.
etc. This declares that no plague nor punishment comes to man without Gods
providence, and his sending. Geneua.

How a Leper was known.
A leper had these five marks to be known by: his garment was upon him and cut
in twain, his head uncovered, his face mufled, his dwelling from the company
of men, and proclaimed openly to be a leper and unclean. Hemmyng.

Of the leprosy that Christ healed.
The leprosy that Christ healed in S. Mathewes Gospel, Math. 8. 3.
was not like the leprosy that is now, but was a kind thereof which was
incurable. Geneua.

LESS.
The meaning of this place following.
NOtwithstanding he that is less in the kingdom of heaven is greater then he.
Mat. 11. 11
Christ which humbled himself to the cross, was of less reputation in this
world then John Baptist was, yet in the kingdom of heaven Christ was greater
then he. Tindale.

The least of them that shall preach the Gospel in the new estate of Christ's
Church, shall have more knowledge then John, and their message shall be more
excellent. Geneua.

LETANIES.
What the Letanies are.
LEtanies are nothing else but humble prayers and supplications to God, to
procure his fauo^r, and turn away his wrath, and were received long before
procession came in place. Some be called Minores, the less: some Maiores the
greater. The less were instituted by Mamartus Bishop of Vienna in the year of
our Lord. 469. as Sigebertus says, 02. 488. as Polichronicon reports. The
order of them was but a solemn assembly of people unto prayer, at such time
as we call the rogation week. The cause was for earthquake and tempests, and
invasion of wild beasts which then did greatly destroy the people. The
greater Letanie was devised by Gregory the Pope, Anno. 592. When as the cause
being like as before, the superstition began to be more, for by the reason
of a great pestilence following a flood, the Bishop by Ceremonies thought to
appease the wrath of God, and therefore made Septiformen Laetanian, a
seauenfold Letanie: One of the clergy, an other of the Monks: one of men, an
other of their wives: One of maidens, an other of widows: the last of poor
and children together. These people so distinct in the seven orders, should
come from seven several places, and then it was thought they should be heard
the sooner: but in their Procession, fourscore persons were stricken with the
plague, to show how well God was pleased with them. Notwithstanding, how
things of a good devotion instituted, in time do grow to great abuse. For
what the order and solempnitie of them was, we read in the counsel of Mentz,
celebrated. 813. years after Christ. The words of the decree be these: Placint
nobis, etc. Our will is, that the great Letanie be observed of all Christians
three days. And as our holy Fathers have ordained it, not riding, nor having
precious garments on them, but bare footed in Sackcloth an Ashes, unless
infirmity do let. Thus far the Counsel.

LETTER.
What the Letter signifies.
AVgustine in his third book and. 5. Chapter De doctrina Christiana writes,
that they stick in the Letter, which take the signs for the things, and that
which is figuratively spoken in the holy Scriptures, they take it so, as if it
were spoken properlye. And so low crope they on the ground, that when they
hear the name of the Sabbath, they remember nothing but the seventh day,
which was observed of the Jews. Also when they hear of a Sacrifice, they
think upon nothing but the sacrifices which were killed. And though there be
some servitude tolerable, yet he calls that a miserable servitude, when we
take the signs for the things, wherein there is a great offense committed in
these days in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, for how many shall a man
find, which beholding the outward signs of the Sacrament, calls to memory
the death and passion of Christ, whereof it is most certain that they are
signs, or which thinks within himself that the body and blood of Christ is
a spiritual meat for the soul through faith, even as bread and wine are
nourishmentes for the body? Or which weighs with himself, the conjunction
of the members of Christ, between themselves, and with the head. These things
are not regarded, and they cleave only to the sight of the signs, and men
think it is enough if they have looked upon, bowed the knee and worshipped.
This to embrace the Letter, and not to give ear unto the said Augustine, who
in the place we have now cited, and a little afterward most appertlye
affirms, that to eat the body of Christ and to drink his blood are
figurative kind of speeches. So are the Jews accused because they cleaving
only to the Letter and circumcision, were transgrassers of the law. Pet. Mar.
upon the Romans fol. 49.

How the Letter kills.
For the Letter kills, 2. Cor. 3. 6.
but the Spirit gives life.

The Letter here and in the second to the Romans, verse. 27. and in diverse
other places of the Scripture, signifies the Law or old Testament, and the
Spirit, the Gospel or new Testament. And so does Saint Austen expound them in
sundry places of his book, which he wrote of the letter and the spirit. And
Erasmus also, both in his Paraphrases and Annotations. Because the law finds
us guilty, and thereupon condemns us, therefore says the Apostle rightly,
that it kills. And the gospel because it pronounces us righteous in Christ,
and shows us that by him we are justified from all things, whereof we could
not be justified by the law. Act. 13. 39. does therefore bring life. As for
such as by the letter, will understand the litterall sense, and by the spirit
the spiritual sense can no learned or christen man allow. For these words,
Letter, ministration of death, ministering of condemnation, and that which is
destroyed, signifies all one thing. And these, Spirit, Ministration of
righteousness, and that remains, be there very contraries. Now words
meaning one thing, must have one interpretation. And by some of the first
cannot the litterall sense be understood, nor by some of the last the
spiritual. Ergo neither by these words Letter or Spirit, since Letter is all
one with the first, and spirit with the latter. Tindale.

Origin writes thus: Origin in Leuit. homil. 7.
Et est in Euangelio littera, etc. Even in the Gospel there is a Letter that
kills. For when as Christ says: Unless ye eat the flesh of the son of
man, etc. If ye take the same according to the Letter, the Letter kills.

What is Littera occidens, the murdering Letter? Truly the law which causes
anger by which comes knowledge of sin, which is a Schoolmaster unto
Christ. The law first kills, y^ Christ may make alive, it condemns y^
Christ may justify, it shows sin, it heals sin. To. Hutchynson.

How letter and circumcision is taken in this place.
Which being under the Letter and Circumcision, Romans 2. 27.
does transgress the law. The letter is here taken for the outward show or
ceremony, as a little after by the spirit, he understands the circumcision
of the heart. Sir. I. Cheek.

When the Law is called the Letter, or that is provoke death in us, or that
it kills, or is the minister of death, or that it is the strength of sin,
it is meant as we consider the law of it self without Christ. Geneua.

LEVEN.
How Leven is diuersely taken in the Scripture.
Leven is sometimes taken in an evil sense, for the doctrine of the Pharesies,
which corrupted the sweetness of the word of God, with the leven of their
gloses. And sometime in a good sense, for the kingdom of heaven, that is to
say, the Gospel and glad tidings of Christ. For as leven alters the nature
of dowe, and makes it through sour, even so the Gospel turns a man into a
new life, and alters him a little and little, first the heart, and then the
members. Tindale. fo. 226.

Take heed and beware of the leven of the Pharesies and of the Saduces. Mat.
16. 6.
By leven here is understood the doctrine and invention of the Pharesies, and
of all other men like conditioned unto them. Sometime leven in the Scripture is
taken in an evil sense, as here, and sometime in a good sense. As in the. 13.
33. and in the 12. of Saint Luke. verse. 1. it is noted by the name of
hypocrisy, because it is deceitful, false and ungodly, and makes all the
lovers thereof hypocrites. Tindale.

Leven here is taken for the ^rronious doctrine of the Pharesies and Saduces,
which with their gloses deprauated the Scriptures. Some think this word (...)n
is taken for wholesome doctrine of the Gospel. Math. 13. 33. Sir. I. Cheek.

Beware of the leven of the Pharesie^. Mar. 8. 1^.
He wi(...)eth the in to beware of contagious doctrine, and such s^bile
practices as the adversary used to suppress the Gospel. Ge(...)

LEVY.
Of Leuy, otherwise called Matthew.
AND saw Leuy the son of Alphe^, sit at the r^ec(...)e of ^ustome. He that
is here in Mark Mar. 2. 14.
called Leuy, Luke. 5. 27.
in the Gospel before (Chapter. 9. and verse. 9.) is called Matthew, in whom we
have an example, how they that be called and believe, ought to bring forth
worthy fruits of repentance. Sir. I. Cheek.

Look. Matthew.

LEVITES.
What their office was.
TAke the sum, Nu. 4. 2. 3
etc. from thirty year old, and above. The Leuits were numbered after three
sorts: first at a month, old, when they were consecrate to the Lord, next at
25. year old when they were appointed to serve in the tabernacle, and at. 30.
year old to bear the burden of the tabernacle. Geneua.

^ He said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, 2. Pa. 35. 3
and were sanctified unto the Lord, put the holy Arc in the house, which
Solo^on the son of David king of Israel did build, it shall ^e no more a
burden upon your shoulders. It appears here, that the Levites charge was
not only to minister in the Temple, (...)
but also to instruct the people in the word of God. And where as he says: It
shall be no more a burden upon your shoulders, that is, as it was before the
temple was built^ Therefore your office only is now, to teach the people, and
to praise God. Geneua.

How this place following is to be understood.
For the Levites were purer hearted to be sanctified then the Priests.
Pelicane translateth the words thus: Leuitae quip (...) (...) ritu, etc. For
the Levites were sooner or easier sanctified then the Priests, which he
expounds more plainly in his Commentaries, saying: Intiligitur Sacerdotum
numerum imminutum fuisse, etc. It is to be understood that the number of the
Priests was diminished, which should have sufficed for to prepare the
Sacrifices, (...)
and therefore they desired the help of the Levites, that all things might
be done more diligently. There was also an other cause of the Levites help,
for the sanctifieng of the Temple, and the preparation of the Sacrifice was so
sodeinly commanded that many of the Priests had not time to sanctify
themselves according to the law, which required a certain space for the same,
and the Levites might be sanctified with less ado, and in shorter time. And
surely the very circumstaunce of the place do prove this to be the true
understanding of it: for these be the words that immediatelye go before: but
the Priests were too few and were not able to sleye all the burnt offeringes,
therefore their brethren the Liuites did help them, until they had ended the
work, and until other Priests were sanctified. I. W. fol. 11.

LEVIATHAN.
What Leuiathan signifies.
Dare thou draw out Leuiathan with an Angle, Job. 40. 20.
etc. Leuiathan as diverse learned men expound, signifies the greatest fish
that lives in the Sea, which is a Whale. T. M.

Even Leuiathan that crooked Serpent. Esaias. 27. 1
Leuiathan betoketh here the Devil, after some expositours. Albeit, that it
properlye signify a Whale, as it is said, Job. 40. Serpents also betokens
the Devil, because of their subtilenesse and wiliness. Genesis 3. 1. The Hebrews
understand here by Serpents, mighty kings and Princes. T. M.

By Leuiathan the greatest of fishes in the sea, is meant the kingdom of
Satan, and the mighty tyrants of the world, enemies of Christ, and persecutors
of his religion. The Bible no^e.

The Lord with his sore and great and mighty sword, Esa. 27. 1.
shall visit Leuiathan. That is, by his mighty power, and by his word, he
prophesies here of the destruction of Satan and his kingdom, under the name
of Leuiathan. Geneua.

LIBANVS AND CHARMEL.
What Libanus and Cha^mel do signify.
See ye not that it is hard by, that Libanus shall be truned into Charmel,
Era. 29. 17
etc. As though he should say, it is not long to, that goodlye trees (which
are signified by Libanus) shall be turned into plain fields, and that the
plain fields (which are signified by Charmel) shall become ^ough and full of
bushes. The time that Christ should come is ^he short time that he means,
which the Scripture does often call a short time. Then shall the unfruitful,
rough and woodye heathnesse (which is understood by Libanus) be turned unto
the religion of Christ's congregation or Church, and unto the true service of
the true GOD, (which is understood by Charmel) that fruitful and well tilled
field. T. M.

Shall there not be a change of all things? Charmel that is a plentiful place
in respect of that it shall be then, may be taken as a forest, as Cha. 32. 15
and thus he speaks to comfort the faithful. Geneua.

LIBERTY OF CHRIST.
What it is to stand in the liberties of Christ.
STand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free. Gal.
5. 1.
They do not stand in y^ liberty of Christ, which being not content with the
sole and only grace of Christ do set their minds upon the law, as though
Christ were not sufficient to save alone, but had need of the help of the
law. Yet we must take heed, that we do not misuse this liberty, thinking we
may do whatsoever we list. Sir. I. Cheek.

The liberty and freedom that we have in Christ, ought every man to stand by.
Tindale.

LIE.
The definition of a lie.
HE is said to lie, which with a will to receive, speaks that which is
false, and that to lie is nothing else but to speak against the mind, for
liars speak otherwise then they have in their hearts. But the desire to
deceive is utterly against justice and amity, which we mutually owe one to an
other. There are three things therefore in a lie: First to speak that which is
false: secondly his will in speaking: and thirdly desire to deceive. The first
part longs to the matter: The other two parts perteine unto the form. Pet.
Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 87.

Octauian the Emperor demanded upon a time this question of Pisto the
Philosopher: Pisto the Philosopher.
Tell me Pisto, what shall men do if he be brought to this extremity, that if
he speak truth, he condemns himself, and if he make a lie he saves
himself. The virtuous man (says he) ought rather to choose to be overcome with
truth, then to overcome by lies: for it is impossible, that a man which is a
liar, should continue long in prosperity.

Whether we may lie to preserve the life of our neighbor, or no.
What if a murderer should persecute a man, to kill him, and thou know
that he lies there kidden where thou presentlye art, and they demand of thee
if thou know whether he be there or no? He answers, that if thou be of a
valiant courage, and as it becomes a Christian, thou must say where he is, I
know but I will not utter it, do ye what ye will. But when the matter comes
to this point, that for the safety of any man's life thou must make a lie, know
thou that thou ought to commit the thing unto God, and that thou have
nothing therein more to do. Either thou must answer that thou will not betray
him, or else thou must hold thy peace. But by thy silence the murderer will
suspect that he is in thy house, and thou shall seem to give occasion of his
taking.

But in very deed thou have not so done, for thou can not let him to think
what he will. Wherefore the matter is rather to be committed unto God, then
that thou should make a lie. Howbeit thou must very well weigh with thy
self, namely, to speak so, that thou say not al, and yet speak not falsely.
For in these cases I think it is not forbidden, yea, I judge it is most
lawful to speak doubtfully. Pet. Mart. upon Iudic. fol. 90.

Of the Midwiues lie, and of Rahabs lie.
Now to speak of the Midwiues of Egypt and of Rahab. Exo. 1. 19.
God did not reward them for their lie, Joshua. 2. 4.
but for their mercy, because they dealt kindly with his people, for which
also he forgave them their lie, wherein they sinned undoubtedly, g(...)uously.
For the mouth which lies kills the soul. Sap. 1. 11 If those Midwiues
Midwiues lie.
had been perfect women, they would have refused that office, whereunto Pharao
appointed them, for it was to murder the infants of the Israelites. And Rahab
had done better, Rahabs lie.
if she had not lied, but answered, I know where they be, but because Ilfeare
God, I will never show it, they could have lost nothing by this answer,
although they had suffered death therefore. For blessed be the dead that die in
the Lord.

How Paul's lie is excused.
Saint Paul Paulesly.
made no lie when he said that he was a citizen of Rome, Act. 22. 25
for he was indeed a citizen of Rome, because his father was free. As at London
the children of free men, be Citizens and free.

Of one that would not lie.
When the Emperor sent his officers to one Ferninus Ferninus.
Bishop of Tagasta, to search after a certain man whom he had hidden, he
being enquired for him, said that he would not deny that he had hidden him,
because of lieng, but that he would never betray him: for which answer he was
grievously punished; but no pain could cause him to disclose where the man
was. The Emperor meruailing at his steadfastness, delivered him. To.
Hutchynson.

Of Aabrahams lie to Abimelech.
Look. Abraham.

Of David's Iye to Ahimelech.
Look. David.

LIFE.
How these places following are expounded.
AND the life was the light of men. This sentence is sundry wise expounded,
John. 1. 4.
for some think that the meaning is, that the life which Gods son gives
creatures, should be a light to man, to show them Gods son. Some take the
word Life, for Gods son himself, as if Saint John should say, that Gods
son, who is very life, is the light of men. Some other gather this sentence,
that the life, that Gods son gives to men, is adorned with understanding and
reason, and advanced thereunto, whereby excels all other earthly creatures.
And these two latter expositions though they varye somewhat in expressing the
matter, yet come to this end, that Gods son is the author of understanding
and reason in men, which is a sound and a true sense, and may be most certainly
gathered out of the words following, namely these: That was the true light that
lighteneth every man, etc. Thus much than may be drawn out of this sentence,
that Gods son being the author of understanding, is very God. B. Traheron.

No man takes it from me, John. 10. 18
but I lay it down of my self. If so be to lay down his life, signifies
nothing else but to dye, even as to take away the life is to kill, how then
says he, that no man takes the same from him? Did not the Jews kill him: yes
verily. If they then killed him, they also took his life away from him. Indeed
they took it away, but they did not extort it from him by violence, and
against his will. For they could not have taken the same from him, except he
would willingly have died. Marl^ upon John. fol. 375.

He that finds his life shall loose it. Mat. 10. 39.
They are said to find their life, which deliver it out of danger: and this
is spoken after the opinion of the people, which think them clean lost that
dye, because they think not of the life to come. Beza.

To find his life, is to satisfy the desire of his heart. Tin.

He that does prefer his life, before my glory. Geneua.

Whosoever shall loose his life for my sake, Mat. 16. 25
shall find it. Shall gain himself: and this is his meaning, they that deny
Christ to save themselves, do not only not gain y^ which they look for, but
also loose the thing which they would have kept, that is themselves, which
loss is the greatest of all: but as for them that doubt not to die for Christ,
it fares far otherwise with them. John. 12. 25. Beza.

Whether a man may lengthen or shorten his ownelyfe.
Solomon witnesses of God, Pro. (...). (...).
that he does lengthen the life of his, and shorteneth the life of the wicked,
saying: The fear of the Lord makes a long life, but the years of the
ungodly shall be shortened. To. Hutchynson.

LIGHT.
Who is the true light.
THat was the true light. John. 1. 9.
Here the Evangelist puts a difference between light and light. John was a
light indeed, as the Lord says, He was a Candle burning and shining, and
Gods ministers are called the light of ye world. But their light is a borrowed
light, a light given unto them, and not naturallye dwelling in them. The Candle
has no light of it self, but has light sent into it of an other. This place
plainly seuereth the Lord Jesus from creatures, for it affirms him to be the
true light, and denies them to be the true light. The Lord Jesus is light by
nature, creatures by borrowing of an other: he gives light, creatures receive
light. They need light because they have none by nature: he is full of light
and gives light to them that need. Seeing then that there is so great
difference between the Lords light and man's light, the Lord must needs be of
an other nature then a creature. For if a creature could be the true light, it
could not be said, of the son only, that he is the true light. But because a
creature is not the true light, and Gods son is the true light, therefore
Gods son is another thing then a creature. No creature can shine and give
light of it self by nature, Gods son shines and gives light of himself
naturally, for he is the true light, so is no creature. B. Traheron.

The meaning of these places following.
And the light shines in darkness, John. 1. 3.
and the darkness comprehended it not By the light is understood Christ, and
by the darkness, ungodly and unbelieving men, among whom Christ came, and
they received him not. Tindale.

Read the 18. verse in the fourth Chapter to the Ephesians.

The true light is not here opposed or compared to the false light: but the
Evangelist here goes about to put a difference between our Savior Christ
and all other, least that any man should think that he is even the same light
and no better then that which Angels and men are said to be. But this is the
difference that whatsoever is bright and shining in heaven and in earth, it
borrows his brightness from another: but Christ is light of himself, and
shining by himslefe, and lightening with his brightness the whole world,
insomuch that there is no other cause or original of brightness but he. He
called therefore that the true light, to whose nature it is proper to shine:
Therefore this is he first note, by the which Christ is discerned from John,
and from al other Apostles. For John and the Apostles were light, (as it is
said before) but not the true light, that is to say, not that natural light
which shines of it self, and which takes not force to shine of any other.
Such one is Christ, but John and the Apostles not so: for if the Lord had nto
been illuminated with this light, they had been altogether darkness. Marl.
upon John. fol. 15.

He was a burning and shining light. John. 5. 35.
Whereas our savior calls John a burning light, he does thereby the more
reprove the ingratitude of the Jews: for it^ follows that they were
willinglye blind, when they refused the Candle of God that was set before
their eyes, as if he should say, God would not have you to err, for he
appointed John to be a candell, that by his light, he might direct you in the
right way.

Therefore in that ye do not know me to be the son of God, your voluntary
errors is the cause thereof. Even so they which at this day is willingly
blind in the mids of the light of the Gospel, have no excuse, for the Lord
seeks by the preaching of his word to bring men out ot darkness into light
(in consideration whereof, he calls his Apostles the light of the world) that
the darkness of ignorance being driven away, the hearts of mortal men may
be illuminated with the knowledge of God and true piety. Marl. upon John. fol.
175.

I am the light of the world, Ioh. 8. 12.
etc. If Christ only be the light of the world, then the whole world is in
darkness, subject to the kingdom of Satan, insomuch that neither man's reason
nor strength, has any light in it, except it receive the same from Christ:
otherwise it were but vain and superstitious to give light unto light.
Therefore without Christ, there is no one spark of true light. There may
appear some show of brightness, but it is like a sudden flash, which does
nothing else but ^asill the eyes. Marl. upon John fol. 290.

What is meant by the shining light.
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works. Mat.
5. 16.
The godly couersation of the people of God, does minister occasion unto men,
to praise, laud and magnify God, as on the contrary side, our naughty
living is an occasion, that God and his holy word is blasphemed and evil
spoken of. Sir. I. Cheek.

Wherefore these lights were ordained.
Let there be lights for signs and seasons. Genesis 1. 14.
These lights were nto made to serve Astronomers fantasies, but for signs in
natural things, and tokens of Gods mercy and wrath. The Bible note.

By the lights he means the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars. Geneua.

Look. Loins girde.

LILIES.
What it is to gather up Lilies.
ANd to gather up Lylies. Rabbi Iarhi and S. Barnard expounding this place
says thus: Caent. 6. 1.
To gather up Lilies, is to gather up men. And yet even in this one exposition,
rests to be handeled, that Christ is the gatherer, and men the flowers. If
christ be a gatherer, he is no disperser. Indeed it is meet that the
shepherd should gather his sheep, and the hen her chicken, and the husbandman
the grain into his barn. Even so the Prophet Ezechiel says, that Christ
should gather his sheep out of all land, and gather them into their own land:
so does he himself say, with affection of deep love. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
how often would I have gathered thee together, as the hen gathers her
chickens, and thou would not. And as Lilies grew dispersed here one, and
there one, so good men grow rare and thin. And as Christ picketh Lilies from
among thorns, for they grow among thorns: so picked he Abraham from the
thorns of Chaldee, Job from the Hussites, Hyram from the Tyrians, Naaman from
the Sirians, the Ninevites from the Assirians, Lylies grow rare, and good men
grow rarer: lylies among thorns, and good men among thorns: and as the
gathering of Lylies and men be like: so men and Lylies be very like. T. Drant.

LION.
The meaning of this place following.
ANd I was delivered from the mouth of the Lion. Some men do expound this
place of Satan the Devil, (...). Ti. 4. 17
which (as S. Paul says) goes about like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may
devour. But it ought rather to be understood of Nero the Emperor, which was
the most cruel Tyrant that ever was on the earth, and such an ungodly Prince
is as a Lion, and as a devouring bear unto his people. Pro. 28. 15. Sir. I.
Cheek.

How Lions are compared to the persecuters of Christ.
A Lion is the Lord, and the fiercest of all other beasts of the earth, whose
property is to lie and lurk, and in a manner to humble himself until he
have his pray, and then as it is the property of a bear to roar when he is
baited, so the property of a Lion is, when he has got his pray to gape upon
it and to roar, and never before. Of this property sauoureth the sentence of
the Prophet Amos. 3. Chap. ver. 4. saying: Does the Lion roar in the wood,
except he have his pray? As who should say, the Lions roaring and the Lions
pray, go ever together. Again: Comes there any plague within a City, that
is not of the Lords sending, no more (says Amos) can ye hear a Lion roar
without his pray. Of this property of a Lion does Aristotle write in like
manner. li. 9. de natura animalium. Chap. 24. And to this property of a Lion
does the Prophet David resemble the persecuters of Christ at his passion, where
he says: Aperierunt super meos suum sicut Leo, They have opened their mouths
wide upon me as it were a Lion ramping or roaring. Another property that a Lion
has, he is afraid of nothing, except it be of the noise and rolling of a
wheele-barrowe, or a Timbrell, or some other like thing, as the noise of empty
Carts. And some write that he is afraid of the crowing of a Cock: so likewise
the Lions that put Christ to death, and do now spoil the Common weal, were
nothing afraid of Gods displeasure, wrath and vengeance, but only were
afraid of a silly rattle, as of the loss of their own vain glory and pomp,
of the decay of their foolish superstitious traditions, but nothing regarding
the shedding of Christ's innocent and most precious blood. A Lion has also this
property, he loves ever to feed and to walk alone, not so much as the
Lioness shall be in his company, contrary to the nature of all other beasts:
and this property may be resembled to the greedy Lions of this world, that
loves to dwell alone, and to eat alone for any hospitality they keep in
comparison of their living, as well as unto the Scribes, and Pharesies, and the
high Priests, who to maintain their avarice and covetousness, cried, Away
with Christ, crucify him, crucify him, we have no King but Caesar, let Moses
and us alone. etc. Ric. Turnar.

How tyrants are likened to Lions.
The roaring of the Lion, Job. 4. 10.
and the voice of the Lioness, and the teeth of the Lions Whelps are broken.
Though men according to their office do not punish tyrants (whom for their
cruelty he compares to Lions, and their children to their Whelps) yet God is
able, and his Justice will punish them. Geneua.

How the Lions are fed by Gods providence.
The Lions roar after their pray, Psa. 104. 21
and seek their meat at God. That is, they only find meat according to
Gods providence, who cares even for the brute beasts. Geneua.

LOCVSTS.
What manner of beasts they were.
HIs meat was Locusts and wild honny. Mat. 3. 4.
Locusts be certain beasts, which the people of Parthia and of Aethiopia
did commonly use to eat, as affirms Pliny in the 11 book, the 29.
chapter, and 16. book and 30. chapter. Yet do some hold opinion, that they
be the tops, or (as we call them) the buddes of trees or fruits. Tindale.

Locusts were a kind of meat, which certain of the East people use, which
were therefore called, deuourers of Locusts. Beza.

LOINS GIRDE.
What is meant thereby.
Girde up thy loins, Iere. 1. 17.
etc. For a Prophet or Preacher to girde up his loins, is boldly and
constantly to resist the false opinions and doctrine of the wicked, and even to
imprint in them the word of truth (which engenders hate) whether they will or
no, and that not once or twice, but until such time as they either amend, or
else wax angry and furious with it. Yea, and then to set more by the
commandments of the Lord, then by the power and tyranny of the world, and not
to set by the threatenings or rulers which can do nothing but that which God
permits and suffers them: Therefore are they not to be feared of an
obedient and faithful servant of the Lord. T. M.

The meaning of this place following.
Let your loins be gird, Luke 12. 35
and your lights burning. That is, be in a readiness to execute the charge
which is committed to you. Geneua.

The burning lights Burning lights.
that Christ wills us to have in our hands, are a lively faith, working
through charity. The works of the Christians ought to be lively seruent and
burning. Sir. I. Cheek.

LONG LIFE.
How a good man may desire long life.
THat it is no evil thing for a good man to ask of God long life, Psalm. 21. 4.
may be gathered by the words of the Prophet, where he says, Vitam petijt a
te, He has asked life of thee. And what marvel is it if the just man that is
but a member of Christ, do ask long life in some cases, and at some times,
seeing that the natural son of God, did in the frail nature of his manhood,
desire of his father, that the Cup of his bitter passion might pass away from
him, and what was that else, but to desire to live still, or at the least not to
dye then: nevertheless, he teaches all men how they shall pray in such a
case, he used a kind of speech called Correctio, a calling back of words
again, saying: Veruntamen Pater non sicut ego volo, sed sicut tu vis:
nevertheless father, let it not be, as I in the nature of my manhood desire
it, but let it be done as thy divine pleasure is. Thus to ask long life,
having no evil purpose or evil intent, as the rich glutton had, which when he
had enlarged his barns, belked out these glorious words: Anima, habes bona
reposita, Soul thou have much goods laid up in store for many years, be
merry, and make good cheer. This foolish glutton did live to eat, and not eat
to live. And all they y^ desire to live for any such sensual purpose, their
prayer is not lawful nor good: nay, it is not worthy to be called a prayer,
but a carnal wish, so to desire to live, is to desire to be separated from
God, and to go to the deep dungeon of hell. But to desire to lead a long
life, to the end that he may the more set forth the glory of God, and to do
good to the world, and not to be an unprofitable burden unto the world, as
they be which do nothing here but mar malte, and wast wheat, Nati consumere
fruges, apt and borne to spend and to spoil. But to live and labor to do
good (as much as in them lies) to all men, and hurt to no man, their desire to
live long, is not to be doubted to be a thing lawful, forasmuch as long life,
is a blessing of God. And if long life be one of the blessing of GOD, that he
gives to his chosen and elect servant, who can say that to ask long life of
God, is a carnal property. And to prove that long life is the blessing of
God. Read. Exo. 20. 12. Deuteronomy. 5. 16. Ric. Turn.

If the good desire to live, it is for the great desire they have to do good:
but if the wicked or evil desire to live, it is for that they would abuse the
world longer. In the Dial of Princes.

LORD.
How the Lord is our shepherd and feeds us.
DOminus regit me, Psalm. 23. 1.
etc. Ye shall understand that S. Hierome following the text of the Hebru^
verity, does read in the steed of Dominus regit me, Dominus pascit me. Which
may be Englished well, The Lord feeds me, or, The Lord is my shepherd. The
Greek word Paiuosinou, signifies Pascere and regere, both to rule and to
govern, and also to feed as the shepherd feeds his sheep, and by a
Metaphore, it is translated and applied very properly sometime to God himself,
and sometime to such men which here in the earth are called by Office to be
the spiritual Pastors and Fathers of the Christian flock. Arnobius in his
brief Commentaries does properly write upon these words. Dominus regit me, and
nihil mihi deerit, after this manner: Dicant qui volunt, reget me ager meus,
etc. Let them say that list, my house and my land shall find me: let other
say, my sheep and my fat Oxen are store enough for me, and another make his
boast of his Master, another of his Merchaundise, and he of his handie craft,
and this man of his pen, and that man of his profound learning: but I am at a
point says the Prophet, and in this opinion will I dwell all the days of my
life: Dominus regit me, and nihil mihi deerit, The Lord is my shepherd, and
therefore I am sure never to lack: Nihil mihi deerit, I shall lack nothing
that shall be necessary and good, both for the body or for the soul, etc. Ric.
Turn.

Of the Lords help in trouble.
The Lord is thy keeper, he is the shadow (or protection) at thy right hand. He
is called the shadow at thy right hand, to teach thee, that he is at hand, and
stands by thy side ready to defend thee. Or else, The Lord is thy shaddowe
at thy right hand, that is, he prospers all thy affairs, he gives success
to all thou take in hand. If thou be a Preacher, and a teacher in the Church
of God, if thou travail in thy vocation uprightly, and with a good conscience
to provide for thy self and thy family, thou shall not lack thy Cross, but
be of good comfort, for the Lord has promised to be on thy right hand: he
will aids thee, and succor thee in all things, that thou shall either do or
suffer. Luther upon the Psalm. fol. 41.

How the Lord suffers long.
Long suffering and of great goodness. Psa. 103. 8
The Lord is long suffering, which is more then patient, for he not only
suffers, but also deferreth vengeance, desiring the amendment of the
sinner, loving better to pardon and forgive, then to punish. Romans 2. 4. either
dispisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and long sufferaunce,
etc. T. M.

LOST SHEEP.
The meaning of this place following.
I Am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Mat. 15. 21
Christ calls them the lost sheep unto whom he is sent: In which saying, we
have two things to be observed. First, that we must acknowledge that we are
all lost, or else Christ has nothing to do with us. We must every one confess
with the Psalmist, that I have wandered like a lost sheep, O seek then thy
servant. They therefore that are proud of opinion of their own good works,
and think to be saved by their deserts, are not for Christ to meddle withal,
for he is sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel, or as he said
to the Pharesies, The whole have no need of the Physician, but the sick. First
therefore we must acknowledge, that we are altogether cast away, and that we
have no more wit nor power to return, or to save our selves, then has a
sheep that is wandering in the Wilderness among Wol^es, Bears, and Lions.
Secondly, if we confess and find our selves to be such, then are we here
comforted, that is properly sent and appointed of GOD, to save the lost sheep
of the house of Israel, like as he says in another place: The Son of man is
come to save that which was lost. And in Saint Lukes Gospel concerning the
conversion of Zacheus: The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which
was lost. Luke 19. 10
Therefore it ought to be no discomfort unto us, to confess that we are
utterly lost, seeing thereby that we are assured, that we appertain unto
Christ, who came of purpose to seek and to save that which was lost. O the
wonderful wisdom, power and mercy of GOD showed us in CHRIST, that even
then, when we feel our selves lost, we are found: when we see our selves
destroyed, we are saved: when we hear our selves condemned, we are justified:
only in believing these words, The son of man is come to save that which was
lost. Let us therefore with invincible courage of faith, take hold of these
general promises of God, and apply them unto our selves, as the poor woman of
Canany did, and we shall find it to be true which our Savior Christ says
unto us, There is nothing impossible, to him that believes. Doct. Fulke.

LOTTES.
How they may be used lawfully.
TO speak of lottes, how far forth they are lawful, is a light question.
Jonas. 1. 7.
First to use them, for the breaking of s^ri^e, as when partners, their goods
as equally divided as they can, take every man his part by lotte, to avoid all
suspicion of deceiptfulnesse. Act. 1. 26
And as the Apostles in the first of the Acts, when they sought another to
succeed Judas the Traitor, and two persons were presented: then to break
strife, and to satisfy all parties, did cast lottes whether should be
admitted, desiring God to temper them, and to take whom he knew most meet,
seeing they wist not whether to prefer, or happily could not all agree:
either is lawful, and in all like cases. But to abuse them unto the tempting
of God, and to compel him therewith to utter things whereof we stand in doubt,
when we have no commandment of him so to do, as these Heathen here did,
though God turned it to his glory, cannot be but evil. Tindale. fol. 27.

Which declares that the matter was in great extremity and doubt, which thing
was Gods motion in them for the trial of the cause, and this may not be done,
but in matters of great importance. Geneua.

LOVE.
Of the order of Love.
SOme in seeking for an order in love, do determine by the authority of S.
Austine, that first we must love God, secondly our selves, thirdly our
neighbors and brethren, and fourthly our own body and our neighbors. But
there is nothing in Scripture touching any such order. Indeed Christ does say,
that the first Commandment does stand in the love of God, but he does not
give the second place to the love of our selves, but unto the love of our
neighbor, where as he says in Matthew, the second is like the first. So that
there is a double error committed here by them which do uncircumspectly and
vnad^isedly follow Augustine. One, in that they do reckon the love of our
selves, amongst the kinds of love commanded us, whereas there is no
Commandment touching the same: for it is naturally given to us all to love
our selves, and that there is no need to give any commandment concerning
this manner of love: And whereas the same is corrupted by the sin that dwells
within us in our flesh, that corruption is not reformed by commanding us to
love our selves, but by the love of God, of our neighbor and brethren, which
is prescribed unto us by express precepts, to reform the natural affections
of love in us, and to direct them after a good order, wherefore it is not to be
feared that he which does love God, his neighbor and brethren aright, can
neglect and cast away himself, albeit that he do wholly deny and refuse
himself, and be addicted full and whole to the glory of God, and the
salvation of his neighbors. The other error stands, in that they place the
love of our selves, next unto the love of God, whereas Christ does assign the
second place expressly, to the love of our neighbor. Musculus. fol. 471.

How Love is the fulfilling of the law.
Paul Romans 13. Romans 13. 8
affirms that love is the fulfilling of ye law, and that he which loves,
does of his own accord all that ye law requires. And first Tim. 1. 5. he
says, that the love of a pure heart and good conscience, and faith unfeigned,
is the end and fulfilling of the law. For faith unfeigned in Christ's blood,
causes thee to love for Christ's sake, which love is the pure love only, and
the only cause of a good conscience, for then is the conscience pure, when the
eyes looks to Christ in all her deeds, to do them for his sake, and not for
her own singular advantage, or any other wicked purpose. And John both in his
Gospel and also Epistles; spoaketh never of any other law, then to love one
another purely Affirming that we have God himself dwelling in us, and all that
God desires, if we love one another. Tindale. fol. 36.

Again, Love of her own nature, bestows all that she has, and even her
own self, of that which is loved. Thou need not to bid a kind mother,
to be loving to her only son. Much less spiritual Love, which has eyes
given her of God, needs man's law to teach her to do her duty. And as in
the beginning he did put forth Christ as the cause and Author of our
righteousness: even so here sets he him forth as an example to
counterfaite, that as he has done to us, even so should we do one to another.
Tindale. fol. 49.

How we ought to love God.
This do, and thou shall live. Lu. 10. 28
That is to say, Love thy Lord God with all thy soul, and with all thy
strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as thy self: as who should
say, if thou do this, or though can not do it, yet if thou feel lust
thereunto, and thy spirit stirs and mourns, and longs after strength to
do it, take a sign and evident token thereby, that the spirit of life is in
thee, and that thou art elect to life everlasting by Christ's blood, whose gift
and purchase is thy faith, and that spirit that works the will of God in
thee, whose gift also are thy deeds, or rather the deeds of the spirit of
Christ and not thine, and whose gift is the reward of eternal life, which
follows good works. Tindale. fol. 78.

Ye have not the love of God in you. John. 5. 42
The love of God is here taken, for the whole feeling of godliness. For no
man can love God, but he must also honor him, and must submit himself
wholly unto him, even as where is no love of God, there is no obedience, in
consideration, Moses makes this the sum of the law, that we love God with
our whole heart, etc. Marl. upon John fol. 181.

Why Love has the chief place, above Faith and Hope.
Now abides Faith, Hope and Love, but the chief of these is Love. 1. Cor. 1^.
13
The chief of these is Love, not concerning justification, but concerning the
applieng of all things to the profit of the Congregation. Nothing lets some
one peculiar thing diversely referred, to be now inferior, now superior to
another. Love, concerning providing for the necessity of thy neighbor, is
chief and above Faith: but concerning the obtaining of justification and
salvation, does Faith excel Love. Now Saint Paul does not here dispute, what
Faith does in justification, but what love does to them that be needy in the
Congregation, therein is Love chief, for it seeks narrowly to see them
ho^pen. To this intent only does S. Paul give Love the chief place here.
Erasmus in his Annotations upon this place, does likewise expound it. Tindale.

Of Mary Magdalens love.
Many sins are foriuen her, Luke 7. 47.
for she loved much, or whereby it comes that she loved much. Neither do we
here wrest the words of the Gospel to maintain a wrong opinion, for in the
history there goes before: first, when they were not able to pay, he forgave
them both. If he forgave them, and if they were not able to pay, he did not
then forgive them for their love. For if they had been able to pay, he would
not have forgiven them. Secondly, there goes before: Whether of these will love
him more? Simon says, He to whom he forgave him more. Therefore, the Lords
answer could in effect be nothing else but this: I have forgiven her very
much, therefore has she loved me much. So then I say, love is of forgiveness,
and not forgiveness, of love. And then it follows immediately: And he said
to the woman, thy faith has saved thee, go in peace.

We do therefore conclude, that there is but one only satisfaction, for the
sins of all the world, to wit. Christ once offered up for us, which are by
faith made partakers of him. Lu.

For the loved much, that is says Theophil^ct, she has showed her faith
abundantly. And Basil in his sermon of Baptime, says: he that owes much,
has much forgiven him, that he may love much more. And therefore Christ's
saying is so plain by the similitude, that it is a wonder to see the enemies
of y^ truth, draw and rack this place so fondly, to establish their
meritorious works. For the greater sin a man has forgiven him, the more he
loves him that has been so gracious unto him. And this woman shows the
duties of love, how great the benefit was she had received: and therefore the
Charity that is here spoken off, is not to be taken for the cause, but as a
sign, For Christ says not as the Pharesies did, that she was a sinner, but
bears her witness, that the sins of her life past are forgiven her. B^z^.

Many sins are forgiven her, because she loved much: Not that her love
obtained remission of her sins, but faith, out of which her love proceeded:
and therefore Christ openly affirms, Thy Faith has made thee safe. For (as
says Saint Paul) without faith, it is impossible to please God. Heb. 11. 6.
And whatsoever is not of faith, the same is sin. Romans 14. 23. Tindale.

The more we knowledge our sins to God, the more shall be forgiven us. The
less we acknowledge our offenses, the less forgiveness we receive, as by
Christ's example to Simon the Pharesie of two debtors, who confessed that man to
love most, that had most forgiven him. So it is said of Christ by this woman
(meaning Mary Magdalene) she has loved me most therefore most is forgiven her.
She has known her sins most, whereby she has most loved me, and thou have
less loved me, because thou have less known thy sins: therefore, because
thou have less known thy sins, thou art less forgiven. Hemmyng.

We may not think that love causes remission of sins, but that remission of
sins causes love, for that our love follows, and goes not before, Christ
declares in the same place, saying: He that has much forgiven loves much,
and to whom less is forgiven, he loves less. Does not Christ here
manifestly teach, that Gods forgiving engendereth in us much love or little: If
we examine the circumstaunce of the place, and ponder it diligently, we shall
find it, to be none other wise. But how shall we answer the phrase of
Scripture, which says that many sins are forgiven her, because she loved
much: Summer is high, because the trees blossom, and yet the blossoming of the
trees does not cause Summer, but Summer causes them to blossom. So Winter
causes cold, and not cold Winter, and yet we complain on Winter, because it
is so cold. So we say, the tree is good, because the fruit is good. Tindale.

The meaning of this place following.
No man knows whether he be worthy of love or hatred. Eccle. 9. 1.
The meaning of this place is, that man knows not by these outward things,
Love or hate.
that is by prosperity or adversity, whom God does savor or hate. Luther
upon the Psalm. fol. 46.

By any outward thing in this life, no man knows whether he is loved or hated
of God. The Bible note.

No man knows, etc. Meaning, what thing he ought to choose or refuse: or man
knows not by these outward things, that is, by prosperity and adversity,
whom God does savor or hate, for he sends them as well to the wicked, as to
the godly. Geneua.

The difference between Love and Charity.
There is (says this Author) as much difference between Love and Charity,
Love and Charity.
as is between thread and twined thread. For though all twined thread be thread,
yet all thread is not twined thread. So this word Love is more common and more
general then is Charity. For true it is, that all Charity is Love: but it is
not true that all Love is Charity. In Greek, Charity is Agape, and love is
Eroz. There is the same difference in the one word from ye other, that is in a
pen and a quill. All our pens for the most part be quills, but all our quills
be not pens. The quill is that remains in his nature, without any other
fashion or form put to it. The pen is a quill shaped and formed, and made apt
to write. Likewise Love is the common affect or favor: Charity is Love
reduced into a due order toward God and man, as to love God alone for
himself, and to love man for Gods sake, etc. Lupset.

Of five manner of loves.
There be five ways noted of loving one another. Of the which number, one way
is praised, three be utterly dispraised, and one neither praised nor
dispraised. First I may love my neighbor for Gods sake, as every good virtuous
man, loves every man. 5. Loves.
Second I may love my neighbor of a natural affection, because he is my
son, my brother or my kinsman. Thirdly, I may love for vain glory, as if I
look by my neighbor to be worshipped or advanced to honor. Fourthly, I may
love for covetousness, as when I cherish or flatter a rich man for his goods,
when I make much of them that have done me plesures, and may do me more. The
fifte way, I may love for my sensual lust, as when I love to fare deliciously,
or else when I mad or dote upon women. The first way to love my neighbor for
the love I bear to God, is only worthy to be praised. The second way
naturally deserves neither praise nor dispraise. The third, the fourth and the
fifth, to love for glory, and advantage or pleasure, all three be stark naught.

LVKE.
The life of S. Luke written by S. Hierome.
LVke a Physician and born at Antioch, was not ignorant of the Greek tongue
(as his writing do show) he was a follower and disciple of the Apostle Paul,
and a companion of al his peregrination: he wrote a volume of the Gospel, of
whom ye same Paul says on this wise: We have sent with him a brother, whose
praise is in the Gospel throughout all ye Congregations. And again to the
Collossians: Most dear Lucas the Physician greeteth you. And to Timothy: Luke
is with me alone. He set forth also an other special good book, which is
entitled the Acts, of the Apostles, the story whereof came even full to
Paul's time, being and tarieng two years at Rome, that is to say, unto the
fourth year of Nero the Emperor there, whereby we do well perceive that the
same book was made in the same City. Therefore as for the circuites of Paul
and of Tecla the Uirgin, and all the tale of Leo by him baptized, we reckon
among the Scriptures that be called Apo^ripha. For what manner a thing is it,
that a companion which never went from his elbow, should among his other
matters be ignorant of this thing alone. Tertulian; which was near unto that
time, reports that a certain Priest in Asia, being an affectionate favorer
of the Apostle Paul, was convict before John for being Author of that book,
and that the Priest confessed himself to have done the thing, for the love
that he bare to Paul, and the book by reason thereof, to had escaped him.
Some Writers deem, that as often as Paul in his Epistles says, according to
my Gospel, he signifies of the work of Luke. And that Luke learned the
Gospel, not only of the Apostle Paul (who had not been conversant with the
Lord in the flesh) but also of the rest of the Apostles, which thing Luke also
himself declares in the beginning of his own works, saying: As they have
delivered them unto us, which from the beginning saw them themselves with
their eyes, and were Ministers of the things that they declared. The Gospel
therefore, he wrote as he had heard: but the Acts of the Apostles he composed
as he had seen. He lived lxxxiiij. years not having any wife. Buried he was
at Constantinople, unto which City his bones were removed and conuaied out of
Achaia, together with ye bones of Andrew the Apostle, in y^ 20. year of
Constantius y^ Emperor. Eras.

In this second book, the blessed Evangelist S. Luke (whose life we have set
forth already at the beginning of his Gospel) does declare and write unto us
(if we will be Theophile, that is to say, unfeigned lovers of God) what was done
and wrought for our secular comfort, after the glorious Resurrection and most
triumphant Ascension of our Savior Jesus Christ, how that our Lord Jesus did
both promise, and also gave most abundantly his holy spirit unto all his
Disciples. And what this spirit did work by the preaching of the word, both in
the Jews, and also in the Gentiles, that believed in Christ: this book has
always been in great estimation, and that most deseruingly. For the Acts of
the Apostles (says S. Hierom) seem to be but a bare history, because in them
only the infancy of the Church (which then began to spring) is set forth: but
if we consider that Luke the Physician (whose praise is in ye Gospel) has
written them: we shall also perceive, that all his words are ye physic of a
languishing and sick soul. What other thing (I beseech you) is this sacred and
heavenly history, but one of the chiefest parts of the Gospel. For truly in y^
other books (which are entitled the Gospel) the corn of wheat are cast into
the ground and discribed. But here in this book, y^ self same corn is set
forth, being already sprung up, and declaring most effectually his riches unto
the world. Again, if we had not by Luke known, after what manner Christ
forsook the earth, where and in what place, how and after what fashion, the
promised Comforter did come, what beginning the Church had, wherein it did
flourish, by what means it did increase, should we not have lacked a great
part of the Gospel? Therefore Bid did right well, saying, that Luke had not
only made an history until the Resurrection and Ascension of the Lord, as
the other did, but also did so set forth by writing the doings of the
Apostles, as much as he knew to be sufficient to edify the faith of the
readers and hearers, that only his book (touching the Acts of the Apostles)
was by the Church thought good to be credited, all other which presumed to
write of the same matter being rejected and disapproued. Chrysostom also, to
them that did marvel why S. Luke had not written forth all the Apostolical
history unto the end, or that he had not described the Acts of every one of
them severally in books by themselves, does answer godly, saying: These are
sufficient unto them that will apply their minds and take heed. Therefore
leaving unprofitable questions (why was not this written or that written) let
us take heed unto those wholesome saiengs of the Evangelist, that so we may
apply, this most comfortable salve (ministered unto us by him) unto our wounded
souls. Sir. I. Cheek.

LVNATIKE.
Of the man that was lunatike.
Master, Math. 17. 15.
have pity upon my son, for he is lunaticke. They that at certain times of
the Moon, are troubled with the falling sickness, or any other kind of
disease. But in this place we must so take it, that beside the natural
disease, he had a devilish frenzy. Beza.

LVTHER.
What he was.
LVther was an Augustine Friar. And began to write against the Bishop of Romes
Pardons, in the year of our Lord. 1517.

The cause why he first wrote against the Bishop of Rome.
Friar Tecel the Pardoner, made his proclamations unto the people openly in the
Churches in this sort: Although a man had lain with our Lady Christ's mother,
and had begotte her with child, yet were he able by the Popes pardons to
pardon the fact.

How he wrote to Pope Leo.
In the year of our Lord. 1518. the tenth year of King Henry the eight,
Luther wrote first to Leo Biopsh of Rome, concerning the use of pardons, and in
certain private disputations, called in doubt diverse things concerning the
Bishops supremacy, for which after he was troubled, and lastly proclaimed an
heretic, under the defense and maintenance of Frederike^ Duke of Saxony, he
preached and writ against his power. All Germany soon after forsook the
Bishop of Rome, and so was the whole state of Religion by his means altered
among them. Sleadane.

How he was troubled with the lusts of the flesh.
When I was a Monk, I thought by and by that I was utterly cast away, if at
any time I felt the lust of the flesh, that is to say, if I felt any evil
motion, fleshly lust, wrath, hatred, or envy against my brother, I assaide
many ways to help and to quiet my conscience, but it would not be: for the
concupiscence and lust of my flesh did always return, so that I could not
rest, but was continually vexed with these thoughts: This or that sin thou
have committed: Thou art infected with envy, with impaciencie, and such other
sins, therefore thou art entered in this holy order in vain, and all thy
good works are unprofitable. If then I had rightly understood the sentences of
Saint Paul, The flesh lusts contrary to the spirit, and the spirit contrary
to the flesh, and these two are one against another, so that ye cannot do the
things that ye would do, I should not have so miserablye tormented my self, but
should have thought and said unto my self, as now commonly I do: Martin
thou shall not utterly be without sin, for thou have flesh: thou shall
therefore feel the battle thereof, according to that saying of S. Paul. The
flesh resists the spirit. Despair not therefore, but resist it strongly, and
fulfill not the lusts thereof, thus doing thou art not under the law, etc.
Luther upon the Gal. fol. 251. Let all troubled consciences comfort themselves
by this example of Martin Luther, and say as he said.

The question that Luther put forth a little before his death.
Luther a little before his death, moved this question to his friends as they
sat at supper: Whether we should know one an other in the life to come or no,
and when they were al desirous to learn of him: What says he chanced to
Adam? He had never seen Eve, but what time god shaped her, he was cast into a
marvelous dead and sound sleep. But awaking out of the same, when he saw
her, he asked not whence she is, nor whence she came, but says, She is
flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones. But how knew he that? Uerily
being full of the holy Ghost, and replenished with true knowledge of God, he
spoke thus. In like manner shall we also in another life, be renewed with
Christ, and shall know more perfectlye our parents, wives, children, and
whatsoever is besides, then Adam that time knew Eve. Sleadane.

Luthers prayer before his death.
O God my heavenly Father, and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of all
consolation, I give thee thanks, that thou have revealed unto me thy son
Jesus Christ, whom I have believed, whom I have professed, whom I have
loved, whom I have set forth and honored, whom the Bishop of Rome and all
that wicked rabell do persecute and dishonor, I beseech thee my Lord Jesus
Christ, receive my soul: my heavenly Father, although I be taken out of this
life, albeit I must leave this body, yet know I assuredly that I shall
remain with thee for ever, and that no man can take me out of thy hand, Slay.

What sects is said to rise out of him.
Look. Sect.

Macedonius.
Of his cruelty and tumult he caused in the Church.
MAcedonius a Priest of Constantinople, Heretic.
taught that the holy Ghost was a creature and no God. Between this man and
one Paulus was great strife, whether of them should succeed Alexander in the
Bishopric of Constantinople: So that Hermogenes master of the chivalry, was
slain of the people when he came with the Emperors authority to stablish
Macedonius, whom the Arrians favored. And being Bishop of Constantinople, he
practiced extreme cruelty in the Church, constraining the Christians to
receive the Communion with the Arrians, in such wise that if women or children
refused to do the same, he did either cut off their paps, or by such other
cruel torments, force them thereunto. He caused much tumult and business in
the Church, till at last a Sinode was assembled at Constantinople of. 180.
Bishops against him. Cooper.

Macedonius at the first being an Arrian and deposed by Acacius sect, could not
quiet himself, but fell from the Arrians into an other heresy. He denied the
Godhead of the holy Ghost, terming him the servant and drudge of the Father,
and of the son. This opinion they say, Marathonius Bishop of Nicomedia taught
before him. These heretics be called Pneumatomachoi. Socrat. li. 2. chap. 25.
Epiph. haeraes. 73.

MAGI.
What the Magies were.
Behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem. Wise men or Magi in
the Persians tongue, Math. 2. 1
signifies Philosophers, Priests, or Astronomers, and are here the first
fruits of the Gentiles, that came to worship Christ. Geneua.

The wise men (called Magi) that came fom the East, were neither kings nor
Princes, but as Strabo says (which was in their time) sage men among the
Persians, as Moses was among the Hebrews. He says also that they were the
Priests of the Persians. Tindale.

MAGISTRATE.
What a Magistrate is.
THE word Magistrate, is derived from Master, and signifies the authority
and office of them, which do either by right of inheritance govern subjects,
peoples, or cities, either have y^ rule appointed the^ by free election and
choice, some do derive ye word Master, from the Latin Aduerbe Magis, which is
to say, More, for that master can do no more them others, and excelling them in
dignity and authority. Some do draw the word Master from the Greek word
Menisos, which signifies greatest. But whether that Master come of the
Aduerbe Magis, either of the Greek word Menisos, every way, Magistrates do
represent y^ authority and office of Masters. And we be also thereby informed
that it were meet for them which do rule others to advance and pass them
whom they do rule, in the prerogative of wisdom and authority. Musc. fol.
546.

How Magistrates are the Ministers of Gods justice.
As the true Church does acknowledge the ministers of the Gospel, as the true
ministers of God, ordained by him, for the administration of spiritual things:
even so do she knowledge the Magistrates as ministers of his justice ordained
of him for the confirmation of the public peace, and therefore she does
willingly submit her self to them in all things for God. For she knows very
well, that God would that every man should be subject unto them in all things,
which are of their charge.

And that they which do resist the same, resist the ordinance of God, and do
set up themselves against him. To. 13. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 13. Pet. Viret.

How the Ecclesiastical person is subject to the civil Magistrate.
It pertains to ecclesiastical persons to judge in spiritual causes, but if
any of them swerve from the right rule of justice, he is subject to the
correction and punishment of the civil magistrate. Exo. 32. 21
As Aaron had his authority of judgment in spiritual causes, 3. Re. 2. 35
yet was he reproved by Moses. And the high Priest was deposed by Solomon, 4.
Re. 16. 16
and Sadoc set in his place. And so should Ahas, if he had been a goodly prince,
have deposed Vriah, for making the profane Altar.

How Magistrates that do not persuade the people to Gods word, are not to be
obeyed in cause of conscience.
The. xxi. Princes that were sent to explorate and search the priuitie and
conditions of the land of Canaan, two of them persuaded the people to believe
Gods promises, and not to fear the people that dwell in the land. Unto these
godly Princes was no faith nor eredence given of the people. The Princes that
persuaded the thing contrary unto God, were believed of the people and their
counsel admitted. By this we learn that such Magistrates as persuade the
people to Gods word, should be believed and obeyed, the other not, in cause of
conscience, there must God only be heard. Act. 5 29. Math. 10. 28. Or else
people shall fail of a right faith. For he that knows not what his duty is
to God and his laws, will believe rather a lie with his forefathers, then the
truth with y^ word of God. And this man is no meet auditor nor disciple of ye
word of God. 1. North.

MAGNIFY.
What it is to Magnify.
THis day will I begin to magnify thee. Iosu. 3. 7.
To magnify properly is to advance and set forth exceedingly, and to bring
him in estimation as it is said. Genesis 12. and often in the Psalms. T. M.

MAHOMET.
Of the rising up of this false Prophet.
MAhomet of Arabia (as most men say) of the mother side descended from Abraham
by the lineage of Ismael his son, which he had by Agar his servant, which was a
Jew, being fatherless and motherlesse. He was (by the Scenites) sold to a
great rich Merchaunt, who loved him so greatly for his favor and wit, that he
made him ruler of all his merchaundise and business, and was very diligent in
his masters affairs, and gained much by occupieng with the Jews and
Christians, and in using their company, learned many things both of ye one law
and of the other. His Master chanced to dye without heir, leaving his wise
very rich, who being about the age of 50. years, liked the young man Mahomet
so well, that she took him to husband, and made him of a poor man very rich.
At the same time it chanced a Monk named Sergius, a man of very evil
nature, and very subtle (who fled Constantinople for heresy) to fall into
familiarity with Mahomet, by whose instruction he increased so in Magical
art, that by his counsel and aid, he took upon him to make the people
believe that he was a Prophet, and showing some points of Magike, he first
persuaded his wife and his householde. He had also an infirmity called the
falling sickness. And when his wife (being sore afraid thereof) would ask
him what it was, he made her believe that it was the Angel of God, which came
oftentimes to speak unto him, and forasmuch as he could not abide (as man)
the divine presence, he fell into such agony and alteration of spirit. After
this his wife died and left him marvelous riches, who then, what for the
riches and y^ constant report that went on Mahomet the Prophet, he became in
great reputation among the Gentiles. And so by the counsel of Sergius, he
called himself the great Prophet of God, and shortly after when his name was
published and of great authority, he devised a law or kind of religion
called Alcaron. In the which he took some part well near of all the heresies
that had been before his time. With the Sabellians he divided the trinity: with
y^ Maniches he affirmed to be but two persons in ye deity: he denied the
equality of the father and the son, with E^nonius, and said with Macedone, the
holy Ghost was a creature: and approved the multitude of wives with y^
Nichola^tes, he borrowed of the Jews circumcision, and of the Gentiles much
superstition, and somewhat he took of the Christian verity, beside many
devilish fantasies invented of his own brain. Those that obeyed his laws be
called Sarase^s. When he had lived forty years, he died of the falling
sickness, which he had of long time, saying that when he was taken therewith,
y^ the Angel Gabriel appeared unto him, whose brightness he could not behold.
He was buried at Medina, three days journey from the red sea, an hundred miles
from Mecha, where is now the chief temple of his law. He was after y^
incarnation of Christ, 600. years.

Of the fair show of holiness in the kingdom of Mahomet.
In outward pretense of religion, even the common sort of their people excel
the Popish Monks^ Yea^ even they that are best reformed. For not only their
Clergy and Monks, but also their communaltie, say the common prayers Prayers.
together five times every day. Namely, at the Sun rising, at noone, at after
noone, at the Sun setting, and after supper when they go to bed. At which time
or they go to pray, they wash themselves, they make themselves bare foot, they
kneel down upon the ground, and the noble men and commons intermedling
themselves altogether with the King, accomplish their ordinarye prayers, with
certain bowing and falling flat down, without some lawful let, no man may
neglect the ordinary prayers unpunished. They keep their ordinary holidays
and fasting days Holydaies and fasting days.
with great devotion and reverence. They make often exhortation to holiness of
life to the people-ward: To dealing of doles: To making of pilgrimages in
remembrance of their Saints, and specially of the Prophet Mahomet. They have
many Hospitals Hospitals.
as well in their high ways as in their cities, for the receiving and
succouring of poor folk and Pilgrims. They have Monks Monks.
of such spare and stayed behavior as never was heard of, both in diet, in
apparel, in forsaking of al things, and in withdrawing themselves from the
company of the common multitude: So as they may seem to resemble rather John
Baptist, yea, or the very Apostles, for the straitness of their life. Some of
them have visions, Visions.
rauishments, and traunces, and some of them are renowned for miracles, as well
in their life as after their death. Moreover, there is wonderful honesty and
behavior among them. Temporaunce.
In their fare, apparel, building, riding, yea, and furniture of war, they
use a plainness. When they eat their meats, all of them, as well the king
himself as also his noble men, sit down upon the ground, and they utterly
abstain from wine and swines flesh. They abhor all superfluity and
curiousnes, as well in apparel as in building. Tents, Faithful of promise.
For y^ most part they dwell in tents, and hales which are removed from place to
place. In their leagus, bargains, and al promises they use al faithfulness.
Heervpo^ it comes to pass, y^ they use no seals to scale their writing
withal, no not even in ye Princes matters. Wonderful is their love and
obedience toward their king, Obedience to their king.
insomuch as al ye noble men of y^ realm stand in awe of y^ kings only
commandment, and in so many large kingdoms: al things are done by y^ kings
appoinment only. Those y^ be chosen to y^ wars, for y^ defense of their
religion, run to it so merry and cheerful, Their willingness to battle.
y^ ye would say they were going to a wedding. They believe themselves to be
happy in all points, when they yield up their souls among the spears and
arrows, in defending or enlarging their Empire or religion Neither are they y^
die in y^ quarrel commended with y^ mourning of their friends, but they be
registered among the Saints, that have gotten the upper hand, and they be
openly praised with Hymns. Finally, great is the shamefastness and honestye
of their women. The honesty and shamefastness of their women.
They be never seen in the company of men, or in places of resort. For a man
to talk with a womam abroad, it is so rare a thing, that it may be counted for
a miracle, if it happen to be seen. Their women neither buie nor sell any
thing. They never come in the sight of men with their faces bare, neither in
their own houses, nor out of their houses. The apparel that they wear, is
both very comely and very plain, and in the Church, they have a place alone
by themselves from the men. Who then would not wonder at such behavior and
orderlinesse? Who would not like it well? Who could look for such things even
at the hands of y^ popish Monks, boast they never so much of reformation?
Hereby they may easily deceive such as are of an honest disposition, and make
them believe that God favors them highly, and aduaunceth their Empire, etc.
Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 191.

MAYZIM.
What this word Mayzim signifies.
MAyzim signifies strong defenses, Da^. 11. 38
as Bulwarks, and Castles. This God Mayzim, which our fathers, as Abraham,
Isia^, the Prophets, and the Apostles with our fathers in the Primitive Church
never knew, is it which the shaven Antechrists of late have made, and saine
themselves every day to make it, which slighthie ^egerdemane (say they) no
Angel nor yet Mary her self cannot do, but only the Popes false anointed
Antichrists. This their strong God and Castle Mayzim, is not only their own
made God, but also al their rites, cermonies, laws, doctrines, traditions,
with their tran^^^stantiations, all their lieng profane Papistrie, false
worshipping, and Idolatry belonging thereunto, etc. Melancthon upon Daniel.

Mayzim, that is, the good of power and riches: they shall esteem their own
power above al their Gods, and worship it. Ge.

MAKER.
Against the false opinion that has been taught the people to receive their
maker in the Sacrament.
The Sacrament is a Sacrament, it is not God. It is the bread of our Lord (as
S. Augustine Augustine
says) it is not our Lord: it is a creature corruptible, it is not ye maker
of heaven and earth. Accursed is he that gives the name and glory of God to a
creature that is not God. August. in Iohannem. Tract. 59.

Saint Chrysostom Chrisosto^
says: Nolimus queso, etc. Let us not confound the creature and the creator
together: least it be said of us: They have honored a creature more then their
maker.

MALACHY.
What is meant by the Sacrifice that Malachy speaks of.
FRom the rising of the Sun unto the going down of the same, Man. 1. 11.
my name is great among the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall be
offered in my name, etc. The pure sacrifice y^ Malachy speaks of (says
Tertulian Tertulian
) that should be offered in every place, is the preaching of the Gospel unto
the end of the world. In an other place he says: The Sacrifice that Malachy
meant, is a devout prayer, proceeding from a pure conscience.

The Prophet Malachy (says S. Hierom Hierome.
) means hereby, that the prayer of holy people shall be offered unto God,
not only in Iewrie that was but a province of the world, but also in all
places.

Mart^^lis says, the pure sacrifice which Malachy means, is offered not
only upon the holy altar (or communion table) but also every where. Then if it
may be offered in every place and without an altar, he meant not the sacrifice
of the Mass.

God shows that their ingratitude, and neglect of his true service, shall be
the cause of the calling of the Gentiles. And here the Prophet that was under
the law framed his words to the capacity of the people. And by the altar and
sacrifice he meneth the spiritual service of God. which should be under the
Gospel, when an end should be made of all those legal ceremonies, by Christ's
only sacrifice. Geneua.

The Prophet in this place spoke no word of the Mass, nor of any oblation
propiciatorie to be made by the Priests. But he spoke of the oblation of the
faithful people in what place so ever they be, which offer to God with pure
hearts and minds sacrifices of laud and praise, prophesieng of the vocation of
y^ Gentiles, that God would extend his mercy unto them, and not to be God
only of the Jews, but of all nations from East to West, that with pure faith
call upon him, and glorify his name. Cranmer.

MAMMON.
What this word Mammon signifies.
MAke you friends of the wicked Mammon, Luke. 16. 9
etc. This word Mammon is a word of the Syrians speech, and signifies riches.
So that the text means, Bestow your riches according to the word of God, y^
God be pleased with your doings, and not deceitfully, as this fellow did.
Tindale.

Again, he defines Mammon on this wise: Mammon (says he) is an Hebrew word,
and signifies riches or temporal goods, and namely, all superfluity, and all
that is above necessary, the which is not reputed to our necessary uses,
wherewith a man may help another, without undoing or hurting of himself. For
Hamon in the Hebrew speech signifies a multitude or abundance, or many, and
therehence comes Mahamon or Mammon, abundance or plentifulnesse of goods or
riches, etc.

MAN.
How man was made after the Image of God.
GOD said, Let us make man in our Image, according to our likeness etc. Genesis
1. 26.
This Image and likeness of God in man, is expounded. Ephe. 4. 24. Where it is
written that man was created after God in righteousness and true holiness,
meaning by these two words, al perfection, as immortality, wisdom, truth,
innocence, power, etc. Geneua.

After the likeness of God created he him. Genesis 1. 26.
That is, after the shape and Image which was before appointed for ye son of
God. The chief part of man also which is ye soul, is made like unto God in a
certain proportion of nature, of power, and working. So that in that we are
made like unto God. Tindale.

How God made man to be vndestroied.
God made man to be vndestroied. S^p. 2. 23.
That is, when God made him in the Image of his own likeness: nevertheless
through the envy of the devil came death into the world, whereby it may be
easily gathered y^ the wise man does speak there of Adam, being in the most
perfect state of his first creation, in the which if he had continued and
abiden still, obaieng the commandment y^ the Lord his God had given him,
neither death nor hell could have had any power of him, he should have been
immortal, he should have lived for ever. God then had created him to be
vndestroied, if he had not through disobedience broken his commandment. I.
Veron.

For God would not that man should perish. 4. Es. 8. 59
But they, after that they were created, have defiled the name of him that made
them, and are unthankful unto him, which prepared life for them.

How the death of man and beast is alike.
It happens unto man, Eccle. 3. 19
as it does to beasts, even one condition to them both, as the one does, so
does the other. There is no difference between a man and a beast, as touching
the body which of them, both dies, but the soul of man lives immortal, and
the body of man rises up again, by the mighty power of the spirit of God.
The Bible note.

Man is not able by his reason and judgment, to put difference between man
and beast, as touching those things, whereunto both are subject: or the eye
cannot judge any otherwise of a man being dead, then of a beast which is dead.
Yet by the word of God and faith, we easily know the difference. Geneua.

Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward. Eccle. 3. 2^
Meaning, that reason cannot comprehend that which faith believes herein.
Geneua.

The immortality of the soul is not known by carnal reason or sense, but by
the word of the spirit of God. The Bible note.

How man's life is but sorrow and care.
What profit (says the wise man) has man more of all the labor wherewith he
wearieth himself under the Sun, Eccl. 2. 23.
but sorrow and care, Man's life
, and nothing without pain and grief. Euripides says, if thou which art
borne mortal, do think to live thy self without labor and unquietness,
thou art a fool. I. Northbrooke.

Of man's good purpose before grace.
A reason of the Pelagians and Dunce men, of man's good purpose before grace.
The grace of God (say they) does help man's good purpose, so that man does
first intend and purpose well, and as Dunce says, dispose himself by
attrition to receive grace, and then God does help him.

Answer.
Of truth; there is no good purpose in man, Man's purpose.
no good disposition, nor good intent, but all is against goodness, and clean
contrary against all things that agrees with grace, till that God of his
mere mercy comes and gives him a will to will goodness, yea, and that when
he thought nothing of goodness, but does clearly resist all goodness. This
does S. Austen Augustine
prove in these words: The Pelagians say, that they grant how ye grace does
help every man's good purpose, but not that he gives that love of virtue to
him that strives against it. This thing do they say, as though man of
himself, without the help of God has a good purpose and a good mind to
virtue, by the which merit proceeding before, he is worthy to be helped of the
grace of God that follows after. Doubtless the grace that follows does
help the good purpose of man, but the good purpose should never have been, if
grace had not preceded. And though that the good study of men when it
begins is helped of grace, yet it did never begin without grace. Here we
see S Austen clear against them. D. Barnes.

How man's ordinance my be altered.
There be some orders in ye primitive Church commanded by God, and some other
were devised by men, for y^ better training of the people. Man's ordinance.
Such orders as were commanded by God, may in no wise be changed, only
because God commanded them: for as God is everlasting, so is his word and
commandment everlasting. On the other side such order as have been devised by
men, may be broken upon some good consideration, only because they were men
that devised them. For as they be mortal, so all their wisdom and inventions
be but mortal. And so indeed as touching such things as have been ordained by
men, we are not bound of necessity to the order of the primitive Church. But
such things as God has precisely commanded by his word, may never be broken,
by any custom or consent. Jewel.

Of the disposition of man.
As man's strength is, so is his work: as is his will, so is his work: Man's
disposition.
as is his forecast, so is his doing: as is his heart, so is his mouth: as is
his eye, so is his sleep: as is his mind, so is his talk, either of the law
of the Lord, or of the law of Behal. In the Testam. of Neptalin.

Of man's will and running.
It lies not in any man's will or running, but in the mercy of God. Romans 9. 16.
Whereas some upon this place do ascribe part of justification unto the grace
and mercy of God, and part of it unto the same will and running, Man's will and
running.
or endeavor of man. S. Austen makes answer thus: If (says he) the Apostle
did mean none other thing, but that it does not only lie in the will and
running of man, except the mercy of God do help, we may also say on the
contrary, that it lies not only in the mercy of God without the will and
running of man: but since it were a plain ungodliness to say so, let us not
doubt but y^ the Apostle did attribute all to y^ mercy of God, and that he did
leave no manner of thing unto our own will and endeavor. Again he says in an
other place: Therefore that we should believe in God and live godly, it lies
not in the will and running of man, but in the mercy of God, not that we ought
not both to will and run, but because that he himself does work in us, both
to will and also to run. I. Veron.

Of two Hebrew words that signify man.
A man sent from God. John. 1. 6.
The Hebrews have two words to signify man, Adam and Ish. Adam signifies a
man subject to mortality, misery, and calamity. Ish, signifies a man of
reputation. The Prophet David comprehends both in one verse in the Psalm.
Hear this all ye people, etc. B^th children of Adam and children of Ish. The
Greek word which the Evangelist uses is Anthropos. And as Plato techeth, it
is made o^ up looking, for y^ state of man's body is upright, and his face is
advanced to heaven, he is not bent downward to the ground, after the manner of
other beasts, which thing the Greeks noted by the name of a man, calling him
Anthropos, an up looker. They have also another word Aner In the holy scripture
written in Greek, this word Anthropos, signifies a man compassed with misery:
for in the tenth of the Acts, when Cornelius worshipped Peter, he said unto
him, arise, I also am Anthropos a mortal man. And again, Paul and B^^^abas.
when at Lustra i^^^ters Chaplains would have sacrificed unto them, rent their
clothes, and cried, saying: Men, why do ye these things, we also are Anthropoi,
men subject to the same passions, and miseries, y^ you be. See then the measure
y^ the Evangelist keeps, when he says, y^ I was sent of God: he adorneth him
with high authority, and sets him up on high, above the common sort of
men, but using together this word Anthropos, he tempereth the matter with just
measure y^ no man should think of John more then he was^ For our nature and
custom is, either to advance man too high, or to abase or depresse the^ too
low. The Jews extolled John Baptist too high, for some thought y^ he was no
man, but an Angel in a man's body: Some took him for the promised Messiah. The
Evangelist weighs him in a true pair of balance, neither diminishing any
thing that God had given him, nor adding more then was found in him, etc.
Traheron.

Of the first man Adam, and the second man Christ.
The first man was of the earth earthly, the second man is the Lord from
heaven. 1. Co. 15. 47
S. Paul's purpose in this place, is not to speak of the substance of our
bodies, or of y^ substance of the Lords body, but of ye qualities, as the
words following declare. Hoios. Of what quality y^ earthly, of y^ quality are
ye earthly, and of what quality the heavenly is, of that quality are the
heavenly. This then is the sense. The first man was of y^ earth earthly, that
is subject to sin, and corrupt affections, which bring death. The second
heavenly, that is, full of heavenly qualities, which through the power of Gods
spirit, draws them life and immortality. As we bear the Images of the
earthly, y^ is, were sinful, and therefore compassed with death, so shall we
bear the Image of the heavenly, that is, our spirits shall be renewed to true
holiness, and our bodies to immortality. Wherefore when he says the second
man is the Lord from heaven, he means not that he brought his body from
heaven, but that he is heavenly, as he expounds himself, that he is endued
with heavenly qualyties. Traheron.

Whereas he says: The second man is ye Lord from heaven, it is attributed to
Christ as concerning his divinity, not in respect of his humanity, whose
flesh has this glory by ye power of God, who dwells in it. Geneua.

Of the man that gathered sticks on the Sabbath day.
They found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. Nu. 15. 32
Necessity drove him not to gather sticks, and therefore was he worthy his
cruel death, forasmuch as he despised to hear the word of God, whereunto he
was so straightly commanded to give ear on the Sabbath day. T. M.

Of the man wounded.
There was a man (says Christ) that travailed from Jerusalem to Jericho, Luke
10. 30
and by the way, fell among thieves, was spoiled, wounded, etc. In which person
mankind is signified: much more cruelly handled by the devil, then the figure
expresses: we were spoiled of the gifts, wounded man.
y^ God had endued Adam withal, as innocence, immortality, and the Image of
God: and not only in danger of temporal, but everlasting death, from which
we could never deliver our selves. The priest and Leuit ministers of the law
(by whom y^ law is signified) passed by, they ne could ne would help the
afflicted. They looked upon him, they saw, and that was all, for the law shows
and reuealeth our misery, releeueth it not. The Samaritane (in whom our savior
Christ and the christian righteousness coming by him is signified) powers
Oil into his wounds, binds them up, and carries him to the Inn, wherein is
noted both our lack and misery, and also our help from whence it comes.

How the birth of man is four manner of ways.
Men have been brought into the world. Birth of man. 4. ways.
4. manner of ways. The first manner was of Adam, who was shaped of the ^lime
of the earth. The second was of Eve, who was brought out of a rib of Adams. The
third was of Christ only, who was borne of a pure virgin, The fourth is the
common birth of all other men, which are conceived of the seed of male and
female together. Hemmyng.

MANDRAGORAS.
What Mandragoras is.
AND found Mandragoras in the field. The Hebrews call it an herb, Ge. 30. 14
or rather a root that bears y^ similitude of man's body, Other call it an
Apple, which being eaten with meat causes conception. S. Austen thinks that
it pleases women because it has a pleasant savor, or rather for
deinti(...), because there was not many of them to get. T. M.

The Mandrake is a kind of herb, whose root has a certain likeness of the
figure of a man. Geneua.

MANES.
How the sect of Maniches rose of this man.
Of this man came the sect of the Maniches: Heretic.
he was a Persian borne, in manners rude and barbarous, and of a fierce and
cruel nature, and without all modesty, he endeavored to persuade the people
that he represented the form of Christ. Sometime he said that he was
Paraclitus, that is, the true comforter that was promised by Christ. His
followers denied Christ to have taken very flesh. They rejected also the old
Testament, and part of the new. Cooper.

In the time of Aurelianns, began first the Maniches, and one Manes born^ in
Persia, was the beginner of them. This same spread his venim abroad largely.
First by y^ Arabians: afterward in Africa, which went to speedely on, y^ it
could not be swaged the space of two hundred years afterward. The chief of
their doctrine was, y^ there were two Gods, ye one good, ye other evil, and both
like everlasting. This doctrine seemed unto man's reason allowable. For seeing
God is good by nature, and that in the mean season the evil has such power:
it is necessary there be also a peculiar God, which is author and doer of
evils, equal to the other God with power and euerlastingnes. Beside these, had
they other opinions ye they taught, namely, y^ Christ was no true God, neither
received they the books of the Apostles, but fained their several doctrines,
y^ which they called Christ's gospel also: They bosted also of several
illuminatio^s of heaven, and said, they gave the holy Ghost. They ordained
sundry ceremonies: They used also choice of meats: They forbad wedlock,
saying, that thereby is obtained the holy Ghost. They taught also to reject
civil power. For Matrimonye and governance of Common wealth, they said to
have their offspring from the evil God, and not to be ordained of the good God.
Carrion.

Wherein the Papists agree with the Maniches.
They called their unmarried Ministers (as S. Austen. Epist. 72. faith)
Electos, The Papists and Maniches agree in these points.
they ministered the holy mysteries under one kind. They yielded more credit to
their own devises, the^ to Gods holy word. They say the scriptures are
falsified and full of errors. They abstain from flesh, and yet in their fast,
they had and used all manner delicates and strange fruits, with sundry sorts
of spices in great abundaunce. They abstained from wine, and yet used other
lyquors more dainty and precious then any wine, and thereof drank while their
bellies would hold.

Manes the Heretic, whereof the Maniches have their appellation, had his
original in Persia (as Epiph. haeres. 66. writes) about the. 4. year of
Aurelianus. He called himself Christ and the comforter. He chose unto
himself. xij. Apostles. He said that Christ was not truly borne, but
phantastically. Eusebius. li. 7. cap. 30. Socrates. li. l. cap. 17. says of him
that at the first he was called Cubricus. Afterward changing his name, he went
into Persia, found the books of Buddas, and published them in his own name.
He taught that there were many Gods, that the Sun was to be worshipped, that
there was fatal destenie, that the souls went from one body into another. The
king of Persia son fell sick. Manes through Sorcerie took upon him to cure
him and killed him. His death and vvretched end.
The King caused him to be clapped in prison, but he brake prison, and fled into
Mesopotamia: there was he taken and flayed alive, his skin filled with
chafe, and hanged at the gates of the City.

The Maniches confuted.
He walked on the water to go to Jesus. Mat. 14. 29
This place confuteth the Maniches and such like Heretics, which denied the
truth of the human nature of Christ, saying that his body was not a true
body, but a fantastical body. Thus they reasoned to uphold their errors: It
pertains not to a true body to walk on the Sea, but Christ walked upon the
Sea, therefore he had no true nor real body but a fantastical body.

These men consider nothing more to be in Christ, then in a bare man, as though
it were impossible for God to help an human body from sinking in the Sea.
But what say they unto this, y^ Peter at the commandment of Christ, walked
upon the Sea. Why do they not consider that he which caused Peter to walk upon
the Sea with an human body, can much more easily himself do the like. They
should weigh the power of Christ, if not in his own deed, yet at the least,
by the deed of Peter. Marlorate. 324.

MANNA.
What Manna signifies.
THen eat they Angels food. Psa. 78. 25
Manna is called the food of Angels, not that the Angels use such food, but
because it came down from heaven, which is the dwelling place of Angels, and
therefore do some read here the bread of the clouds, because it came from
the clouds: Some, the bread of the mighty, because it came from the
Almighty. Exo. 16. 14. Sap. 16. 20. lohn. 6. 31. T. M.

How Manna is not the true bread that came from heaven.
Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, John. 6. 32
etc. He denies that Manna was that true heavenly bread, and says that he
himself is that true bread, because he feeds unto the true and everlasting
life. And as for that that Paul. 1. Cor. 10. calls Manna spiritual food,
it makes nothing against this place, for he joins the thing signified with
the signs, but in this whole disputation, Christ deals with the Jews, after
their own opinion and conceit of the matter, and they have no further
consideration of the Manna, but that it fed the belly. Beza.

Manna is called the bread of heaven and of Angels, because it rained from
heaven by the ministry of Angels. There be some that do interpret this, to be
the bread of Princes or of great men, because of the Hebrew word, which in
another place signifies Princes or Noble men. Marl. upon John. fol. 206.

Of those that eat Manna and are dead.
Your Fathers did eat Manna in the Wilderness, John. 6. 49
and are dead. This verse is two ways expounded. Some understand it generally
of all those fathers of the Jews, which did eat Manna in Moses time in the
Desert, as well godly as ungodly: insomuch that the Lord speaks here in this
place, not of the death of the soul, but of the body. But other some expound
it of the wicked only, which did eat Manna without faith of the truth, in the
which is life, and therefore are also dead, that is to say, they perished
everlastingly: but it seems not necessary, that we here distinguish between
the believing and the unbelieving Jews. Only Christ says y^ Manna was a
corruptible meat to the Fathers, being food not of the soul, but of the
body, not sempiternall but temporal, which could not save them from death. It
follows therefore, that men's soul find food no where, but in him whereby
they may be fed into everlasting life, for we must remember what was spoken in
another place, that there is no mention made here of Manna as Christ was a
secret figure (for in that respect Paul calls him spiritual meat) but
here Christ frames his speech to his hearers, 1. Cor. 10. 3
who being only careful for the feeding of their bellyes, had no farther
consideration of any thing in Manna. He does therefore justly pronounce that
their fathers are dead, that is to say, which were in like manner addict to
their bellyes. Marl. upon John. fol. 221.

What Manna and the white stone signifies.
To him that overcomes will I give to eat Manna that is hid, Apo. 2. 17.
and will give to him a white stone, etc. By Manna understand the word of God,
and true hearty love: by the white stone is signified the election before God,
and also everlasting peace and confidence in the grace and favor of God, unto
everlasting life. Sir. I. Cheek.

How Manna and the water brought out of the Rock, is compared to our bread and
wine in the Sacrament.
The Manna which God sent down from heaven, to feed the people of Israel in
the wilderness, and the water which he brought out of the stone to refresh and
comfort them, were even the same things unto them, that bread and wine is now
unto us. For as S. Austen says, as many as in that Manna understood Christ,
did eat the same spiritual meat that we do. But as many as sought only to
fill their bellies of that Manna (the fathers of the unfaithful) did eat, and
are dead. And likewise the same drink, for the stone was Christ. Here may we
gather of S. Austen that the Manna was unto them, (...) the bread is unto us.
And likewise that the water was to them, as the wine is to us: which thing
appears more plain by the words of Saint Austen following, which be these:
Manducauit Moses Manna, etc. Moses did also eat Manna, and Aaron and Phinehes
did eat of it, which pleased God and are dead, wherefore, because they
understood y^ visible meat spiritualy. They were spiritualy an hu^gred, they
tasted it spiritualy, y^ they might be spiritualy replenished. They did all
eat the same spiritual meat, and all drank the same spiritually which we
do, and they all did drink the same spiritual drink. They drank one thing
and we another, but that was in the outward appearaunce, which nevertheless
did signify the same thing spiritually. How drank they the same drink? They
(says the Apostle) drank of the spiritual stone following them, and that
stone was Christ. And thereto Saint Bede adds these words: Videte autem fide
manente, signa variata: Behold, that the signs are altered, and yet the faith
abides one. Of these places it may plainly be perceived, that it is no
Article necessary to be believed under pain of damnation, that the Sacrament
should be the naturalll body of Christ, seeing the old fathers never believed
it. And as they were saved without believing that Manna was altered into
Christ's body: even so shall we be saved without believing that the substance
of bread is turned into his naturally body, for the same faith shall save us,
that saved them. And we are bound to believe no more under pain of damnation,
then they were bound to believe. I. Frith.

MARANATHA.
What this word Maranatha signifies.
LEt him be had in execration, 1. Cor. 16. 22.
Maranatha. By these words is betokened the seuerest kind of curse and
excommunication that was among the Jews, and the words are as much to say, as
our Lord comes. So that his meaning may be this, Let him be accursed even to
the coming of the Lord, that is to say, to his deaths day, even for ever.

S. Hierome does expound this word Maranatha, the Lord comes, as if he should
say: If a man do not believe our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed: and
let him be sure that the the Lord (against who^ no hatred can prevail) does
come. Some again do expound it thus: Let him be as a rotten member cut off,
and perish utterly. Sir. I. Cheek.

Maranatha: a word wherewith the accursed or vile person, in the extreme
degree is signified. The Bible note.

MARCION.
Of the damnable heresies of this man.
MArcion of Pontus increased the doctrine of Cerdon. He lived in the time of
Justinius Martyr, Heretic.
which wrote a book against him. He met Policarpus and asked of him: Know
thou us? Policarpus: I know thee for the first begotten of Satan. Eusebius. li.
4. cap. 11. 14. He said, the soul only should be saved, and not the body. He
thought that Cain with the Sodomites and Egyptians, etc. were saved when
Christ went down to Hell. Irenaeus li. 1. ca. 29. Epiph. haeres. 42. writes
of him, that he was a Bishops son, who when he had de^^oured a Uirgin, was by
his own father excommunicated the church, and afterward he fled to Rome. Being
there, because they admitted him not into the Church, he began to preach
detestable doctrine: That there were three beginnings, good, just and evil.
That the new Testament was contrary to the old. He denied the resurrection of
the body.

A comparison between the Marcions doctrine, and the Popes.
The Marcions received no man to be a Christen man, except he would refuse
marriage. The Pope receives no Priests, except they fors wear marriage. So that
there is no diversity between these heretics and the Pope, but that these
Heretics does except a greater number then the Pope does, and speaks more
generally, but the thing is all one. For the Marcionites indgeth marriage
unclean for their sort, and so does the Pope for his sort. Farther more
Marcion says, that among christen men may be no temporal marriage, but all
conjunction must be turned into a spiritual marriage. And the self same thing
says the Pope of his Priests, wherefore seeing y^ they do grant how that S.
Paul and also holy Fathers has condemned this heresy of the Marcionites, it
must needs follow that the opinion of the Pope is likewise damned. But here
will some object and say (as Eckius has written) that the Pope does not
condemn marriage, but he causes men alonely to keep his vow. Answer. First
the Pope compels them and if they will be Priests, to vow and fors wear
marriage. For if there were no statute made before of ye Pope, y^ all Priests,
should fors wear marriage, the^ should there no vows he made of priests against
marriage, but the thing should be free. So y^ the vow comes out of the Popes
decree and prohibition, and not the decree out of the vow. Ergo, the
prohibition goes before the vow, wherefore this euation can have no place.
Example. The Emperor makes a statute, that no man shall be admitted into his
service, except he first swear to be an enemy unto the Kings grace of
England. Is not now the Emperor first an enemy unto the Kings person, and
then also a forbidder of love and favor toward the Kings grace of England? I
think his grace will take his act none otherwise. For though he do not nor
cannot make all men the Kings enemies, yet he makes all that appertain unto
him, to be ye kings enemies. So likewise the Pope, though he do not forbid
all men marriage, yet he forbids as many as will be Priests, yea, and he will
admit no man to be Priest, except he first forswears marriage. So that the vow
is first made, or the Priesthood be given. D. Barnes.

A notable example of Marcions chaste life.
Marcion and Montanus, two rank Heretics, anon after the Apostles days
sprung up, and fained such a chaste holiness of life, that they forbad and
damned marriage. But Epiphanius writes, that Marcion when he was received as a
guest in the house of a certain Deacon in Cipres, he carried away his Hosts
wife, deceived with his holy pretense of his new chaste religion. And when
Doctor Marcion had taken his pleasure of her, and cast her up, the miserable
woman constrained to return to her husband, lamenting her fault, asked him
forgiveness. This careful woman (says Epiphanius) was afterward a good
warning for many other women, monishing them to beware of Bishop Marcion his
doctrine. This Marcion and Montanus were the only beginners of the law of
wiuelesse and husbandlesse chastity, and the first authors and patrons of the
Monks religion Melancthon.

MARCUS.
The d^testable heresies of this man.
MArcus of whom Marcosij, Colorbasus of whom Colorbasij, and Heracleon,
Heretic.
after whom the Heretics are called Hera^leonites sacrificed with witchcraft,
to amaze their auditory they pronounced Hebrew words: they said unto the women,
open your mouths, and prophecy through the power which comes from us. Many
women came to the Church, and under color of prophecy confessed that they
were abused of them. Marcus ran away with another man's wife: They power oil
and water upon the head of the departed, hoping so to redeem them. They said
that the life and generation of man consisted in 7. stars: that Christ
suffered not indeed, but was so thought, and that there was no resurrection of
the flesh. Epiph. haeres. 34. 35. 36. Irenaeus. Aug. li. de haeres.

MARY.
How Mary the mother of Christ, ought not to be worshipped.
CHrist (says Epiphanius) did form a fashion, himself of the Uirgin Mary, as
of the earth, who came down from heaven, and being both God and the word, did
put on flesh of the Uirgin, but not that the Uirgin should be worshipped, or
that he would make her a God, or that we should offer in her name. For he
neither did suffer her to give or minister Baptime, nor to bless the Apostles,
neither did he command her to bear rule in the earth, but will have us to
know, that he alone is the sanctification and that she is made worthy of the
kingdom of heaven. Whence does this rolling Serpent or Dragon come unto us?
Whence are these lewd and wicked counsels renewed? Let Mary be in honor, let
the Father, the Son and the holy Ghost be worshipped, let no man worship
Mary. And by and by after, Let no man eat of the error which is of the holy
Mary. Although it be a goodly tree, yet is it not for meat to be eaten of:
Although Mary be most beautiful, holy and honorable, yet she is not appointed
to be worshipped, let therefore the error, of ye deceived cease. For neither is
Mary a God, neither has she a body from heaven, but of the conception of man
and woman, howbeit disposed, according to y^ promise, as y^ co^ception and
birth of Isaac was. And let no man offer in her name, for he that does it, does
cast away his soul. Again, let no man rail against her, nor blaspheme y^
holy Uirgin, God forbid, for she was not coupled to man, neither after the
birth, nor before the birth of our Savior: Again in y^ same book Contra
Colicidianos, these are also his words: Indeed the virgin was a virgin and
honorable, but not given to us to be worshipped, but rather she does worship
him y^ took his substance of her, that is to say, of her flesh.

Of Mary the sister of Lazarus.
It was that Mary that anointed the Lord with ointment. John. 1. 2
Because the Gospel makes mention of many Mary's, here there is a difference
put, between this Mary and the rest, namely, that it was the very same which
anointed the Lord. And this is put down here by anticipation. For the
Evangelist declares this anointing in the Chapter following. Therefore there
is a great ignorance in them, which imagine this Mary the sister of Lazarus,
to be that infamous woman of whom Luke makes mention in his 7. Chapter. The
making mention of the ointment, occasioned this error, and also because in both
places, mention is made of Simon, in whose house it was done: as though it were
not manifest that Christ was oftentimes anointed, and that in diverse places.
The sinful woman of whom Luke speaks of, anointed Christ in Jerusalem, where
she dwelt. And Mary of Betany did the like in her town. And the preter tense
(anointed) which the Evangelist uses, ought not to be referre^ to the time in
the which the same was done, but to the time in which he wrote: as if he should
say^ This is that Mary which afterward powered out her ointment, for the which
cause there arose a murmuring among the Disciples, etc. Marl. upon John. fol.

MARRIAGE.
Who ordained Marriage, and how it is honorable in all estates.
Concerning Marriage, we say that it ordained of: God, and honorable in all
estates, as the holy Scripture teaches. So that whosoever has not the gift of
continency, that is to say, who that feels in himself, such a natural
desire; that he may be drawn to evil thoughts, is obliged and bound to marry.
Theodore de Beza.

Wedlock (or marriage) is a perpetual joining together of one man with one
woman, instituted of God to bring forth fruit, and is ordained to avoid lusts
forbidden in the scripture. They shall be two in one flesh, that is to say to
please God ye Creator, of nature, to obaie his ordinance in that vocation, the
man not to despise the womankinde, but to hono^r and love her, that every man
should know his own vessel, as the part and parent of mankind, to defend
her, to help her, and to love her. Both bringing forth children, teaching
them the true knowledge of God, that this knowledge of God might be set forth
more plenteously, and be conserved upon earth.

For this cause also ought wedlock to be used, that when men be departed from
this society, every man's duty is for himself gone, to leave after him by
just wedlock, other worshippers of God in his place upon earth. For this
intent Abraham, Isaac, and many ancient old holy Bishops, desired to have
children, that they might leave after them, the faithful keepers of the
heavenly doctrine. M^la^ct^on.

Matrimony or wedlock, is a state or a degree ordained of God, and an office
wherein the husband serves the wife, and the wife the husband. It was ordained
for a remedy to increase the world, and for the man to help the woman, and
the woman the man, with all love and kindness, and not to signify any
promise, that ever I have heard or read off in the scripture. Therefore ought
it not to be called a Sacrament. It has a promise, that we sin not in that
state, Matrimony is no sacrama^t
if a man receive his wife, as a gift, given him of God, and the wife her
husband like wise: as all manner of meats and drinks have a promise, that we
sin not, if we use them measurably with thanksgiving. It they call Matrimony
a Sacrament, because the scripture uses the similitude of matrimony to
express the marriage or wedlock y^ is between us and Christ (for as a woman
though she be never so poor, yet when she is married, is as rich as her
husband: even so we when we repent and believe the promises of God in Christ,
though we be never so poor sinners, yet are as rich as Christ, all his merits
are ours with all that he has) If for that cause they call it a Sacrament: so
will I mustard seed, ^euen a net, keys, bread, wine, and a thousand other
things, which Christ and the Prophets, and all the Scripture^ is to express
the kingdom of heaven, and Gods word withal. They praise wedlock with their
mouth, and say it is an holy thing: as it is verily: but had lever be
sanctified with an whore, then to come within the sanctuary. Tindale. fol. 144.

How eurry man is commanded to marry, that has not the gift of chastity.
Let every man for avoiding of fornication have his wife, 1. Cor. 7. 2
and every woman have her husband. Here S. Paul commands, that where as
any danger of fornication is, y^ every man, in avoiding of vicious living
should take a wife, here is no man excepted, for the text says, every man,
and specially to them that cannot live sole. The occasion that S. Paul had to
write this text to the Corinthians, there were certain men among them, that
reckoned it an holiness and a perfection (as certain men do now for Priests)
that Christen men should live sole without wives, as the text declares, it is
good for a man not to touch a woman. To this their holy hypocrisy S. Paul
does answer in this manner: To avoid fornication (says he) let every man
marry a wife: mark, how he bids them to marry, he bids them not to
fast, nor to labor, nor yet to wear hair to chasten their bodies, but
alonely to marry. As who should say, God had ordained and approved a lawful
and lawdable remedy, for every man that had not the gift of chastity. D.
Barnes.

Against condemners of marriage.
The spirit speaks evidently that in the latter times, 1. Tim. 4. 1
some shall depart from the faith, and shall give heed unto spirits of
error, and doctrines of devils, which speak false through hypocrisy, and
have their conscience burned with an hot iron, forbidding to marry, etc. S.
Paul having the spirit of God, did prophecy, that there should come men in
the latter days which should forbid marriage, and these men shall speak lies
through hyprocrisie. Now mark the text, Men shall forbid marriage, and that in
the latter days. The truth is, that no man has forbidden any certain state
of men to marry, but the Pope only, wherefore this text must needs touch his
kingdom, seeing that he is also in the latter days. There were certain
Heretics called Taciani, which did condemn fully and wholly all manner of
marriage. And though S. Paul speaks against them, yet in very deed the
Popes doctrine is not excepted, seeing it is contained in these latter days.
For though there were twenty heresies more then ^aciam, yet must the text be
applied against them all, that does condemn or else despise marriage in ye
whole or in part, for the text is against them all that does condemn marriage,
specially in the latter days. But he that does forbid his Priests to marry,
does for so much forbid marriage: Ergo, the text is against the Pope. Note also,
that these men which forbid marriage, shall have an holy color of hypocrisy.
Now has the Pope forbidden the Priests to marry, under the color of
holiness, because (as he says) his Priests must be pure and clean. As who
should say, that marriage were unclean and vnpure for Priests to use. What
can be holy hypocrisy, if this be not hypocrisy. Here is the holy and pure
institution of God condemned as a thing unclean for his Priests to use.

Moreover, the Tacians did not forbid marriage under the color of holiness,
but they said it was fully and wholly an unlawful thing: the which doctrine
had no manner of color. But the Pope says, Marriage is good and laudable in it
self, but his Priests be too pure and too holy, for to use that simple thing,
for it is not a thing (says he) that does become the state of perfect men,
but it belongs to weak and imperfect men. Now judge whether the Taciani or
the Papiani does pretend the greatest color of holiness.

Heretics (says S. Hierome Hierome li. 1. Ose. 9
) and all such as pretend that they love chastity, do very seldom love it
indeed, as Manicheus, Arrius, Mar^ion, Tacianus, and the renuers of the old
heresy. They promise honny with a poisoned mouth, but according to the saying
of the Apostle, It is a filthy thing to utter what they do in secret. Ephesians. 5.
12. Saint Hierome in this place inueigheth against the old heretics, which would
not marry themselves nor allow marriage in other, but pretended such a
hollinesse with a show of virginity and hatred of marriage, that with their
holy looks and sweet words they deceived the people. Doct. Ponet.

How marriage is no hinderaunce to godliness.
Notwithstanding marriage have much trouble in it self, Chriso in 1. Epist. ad
I^ta. Hoin^^.
yet may it be so taken, (and used) that it shall be no hinderance to perfect
life. Again he says, excuse not thy self by thy marriage, thy Lord was at
the marriage feast, be honored marriage with his presence, And yet do thou
blame marriage? And say thou that marriage is an hinderance unto godliness, I
tell thee marriage is no manner hinderance unto godliness. Will thou know that
it hinders not to have wife and children? Had not Moses wife and children?
Behold Peter a pillar of the Church, he had a wife, therefore find no fault
with marriage. Again, writing upon the words of the Prophet Esaias, Vidi
dominum, etc. He says: who speaks these words: Esaias the beholder of the
celestial Seraphins. Who not withstanding he had company with his wife, yet he
quenched not the grace of God. Again, Esaias had a son and a wife: that thou
may understand that marriage is not evil, but that fornication is ill.
Again, what did marriage hinder thee? No, thy wife is given thee to be thy
helper, and not to deceive thee. Jewel. fol. 178. and. 179.

Proves for the marriage of Priests.
For this is the will of God, 1. The. 4. 3
even that ye should be holy, and that ye should abstain from fornication,
that every one of you should know to keep his own vessel in holiness and
honor. Here Saint Paul says, that it is the will of God that every man
should abhor fornication: who will then resist the will of God, Priests
marriage.
and not regard the thing that God will have done.

Furthermore, the will of God is (says S. Paul) y^ every man should keep his
vessel in honor. Now if Priests be men, and have not the gift of chastity,
then are they bound to regard this commandment, for he says, every man.
Mark how S. Paul also calls the vessel of married men honorable, and
sanctified, wherefore then should it be unlawful for a Priest, to use a
sanctified and an holy vessel. How can man now for any occasion curse that
thing that God has sanctified, or make it unclean that God has purified, but
Saint paul prophesied of such men. D. Barnes.

Have we not power to lead about a wife being a sister, 1. Cor. 9. 5.
as well as other Apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord and Cephas. This
text does clearly prove that Peter and other Apostles had wives, And wherefore
then should it be unlawful for Priests to marry, they are no better nor no
holyer then the Apostles were. But here will some say, that the Apostles had
wives, before that Christ did choose them, but afterward they forsook their
wives and followed Christ, which thing is not true that they forsook their
wives, for that had been plainly against the doctrine of their Master
CHRIST, which taught them not to forsake their wives, but in any wise to keep
them, saving alonely for fornication. And this place of S Paul, Have we not
power, etc. does prove how S. Peter after his Apostleshippe, and also other
disciples of Christ, carried their wives about with them, when they went a
preaching. Wherefore it is a false lie to say that they had forsaken their
wives. D. Barnes.

Let Bishops and Priests read this thing (he speaks against mispending of
goods, Hier. d. 31 5. ca. lega.
that is offered to help poor men with) the which does teach their children
profane letters, and makes them to read Comedies, and to sing baudy songs of
iestes, and these children they find of the charges of the Church.

Here, the Bishops and Priests had children, which they could not lawfully
have, if they were unmarried. D. Bar.

The Council of Nicene, Ex tri. hi. diu. 31. ca.
willing to reform the life of men, did set certain laws. At the which
certain men would have had a law to be brought in, that the Bishops and
Priests, Deacons and Subdeacons should not lie with their wives which they had
married before their consecration. Council of Nice.
But Paphuntius a Confessor (being unmarried himself) did withstand them, and
said that their marriage was honorable, and it was pure chastity for them to
lie with their wives, so that the Council was persuaded not to make any such
law, affirming it to be a grievous occasion both unto them and also unto their
wives, of fornication. The Council did allow this sentence, so that nothing
was decreed, as concerning this thing, but every man was left unto his
free will, and not bound of any necessity.

Here is to be noted, that this holy Council did not reckon it an vnpure or a
filthy thing for a Bishop or a Priest to company with his wife, but do grant
that it is a pure and a clean chastity for a Priest to company with his wife.
D. B.

Innocentius Innocentius.
the third in his Decretalls writes on this manner: These Priests that after
the manner of the country has not forsaken the conjunction of marriage, if
they do break wedlock, ought grievously to be punished, seeing that they may
use lawfully Matrimony. Mark that this was the manner of certain Countries
that Priests might marry Ergo, it must needs follow that Priests marriage is
not forbidden by Gods Law. And if it be not forbidden by Gods Law, is it in
the Pope to compel men so violently unto that thing, the which God has not
bound them too? D. B.

The Master of the sentence Master of the sentences.
writes on this manner. Our weakness is prone to fall into filthiness. But
it is helped with honest marriage. And that thing that is unto whole men an
offense, is unto sick men a remedy. Mark how the Master of the sentence
says, that we are ready to fall into filthiness, and how marriage is an honest
remedy, how can men then after their own learning condemn marriage, as no
honest thing, seeing their own Clearkes calls it honest. D. B.

We read in our own Chronicles, that in the time of King Henry the third,
Henry the third.
which reigned the year of our Lord. 1101. Priests might lawfully marry
wives, insomuch that Anselme then Archbishop of Canterbury in a Seane that he
held at London, did make a Decree, that Priests should forsake their wives,
the which was both against Gods law and man's. For the text of our Savior
Christ is clear, Quos Deus coniunxit homo non seperat.

It is better (says Epiphanius Epip. con. Atheos heresy.
) for him that is fallen in his course (meaning them that cannot continue in ye
thing that they have vowed) to take a wife openly according to the law, and so
to be restored into the Church again (as one that before has done evil, and
as one that has fallen and has been broken, and has now need to be bound)
and not daily to be inwardly wounded by secret darts, wherewith the Devil
continually does assault them. Lo, here Epiphanius does not only allow
marriage of Priests and Uotaries before priesthood and vowing, but also after
priesthood and vowing, and names marriage done in such case lawful, and that
marriage after their vow so broken, is a mean to restore them again to the
Church, if they were fallen from it by breking their vow. So that you see by
Epiphanius judgment, y^ the marriage of priests even after their vow, is not
only a marriage, but also a lawful marriage.

Wherefore they that say the marriage of such (meaning of them that marry
after they have vowed) is no marriage but rather adultery, Augustine
me seems they do not aduisedlye enough consider what they say, for they be
deceived by an appearaunce of truth, for by the means of that foolish opinion
whereby they think the marriage of such professed women as have forsaken their
vow is no marriage if they marrye, there comes no small inconvenience, which
inconvenience is this, wives be separated from their husbands, as though they
were whores, and not wives. And when they will restore the divorced to sole
life, their husbands are compelled to be very adulterers, when their own
wives being alive, they marrye other husbands.

Saint Paul speaking of marriage and meat, 1. Tim. ^. 4
says thus: Every creature of God is good to the faithful, and none is to be
refused being taken with thanksgiving, for it is sanctified by the word of
God and prayer. This Mayor or ground we have of Saint Paul, whereunto I add
this Minor or mean proposition. But marriage is a creature of God, that I am
sure you cannot deny, unless ye will say marriage is a creature of the
Devil, as the old Heretics Saturnius, Basilides, and their fellows did,
whereupon must follow this cen^^sion, Ergo marriage is good and not to be
refused, being taken with thanksgiving, for it is sanctified by the word of
God and prayer. This sound Silogismus proves plainly that the marriage of a
Priest, is not only a marriage, but also a good marriage, and a good thing,
for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. Ponet.

Saint Paul calls the Bishop, 1. Tim. 3. 2
Priest and Deacon, by the name of husband, and their yoake-fellowes by the
name of wives, and says the Bishop must be the husband of one wife, and
likewise the Deacon. 1. Cor. 7. 2.
And further he says: For the avoiding of fornication let every man have his
wife, etc. In which general sentence, Priests must be comprehended, if they
be men. Yea, and their marriage not only a marriage, but also an honouradle
marriage, Heb. 13. 4.
or else cannot marriage be honorable in all estates, as Saint Paul writes to
the Hebrews. Ponet.

Siritius Siritius
being an enemy to Priests marriage, calls their wives Suas vxores, their
own wives, which thing he would not have done, if he had taken their marriage
to be no marriage. And furthermore, he makes a distinction between y^
children whom the Priests had A proprijs vxoribus, by their own wives, and
those children which they had a Turpi coitu, by unlawful means. Ponet.

Gregory Gregory
Bishop of Rome writing to Peter Subdeacon of Sicilia, says: Duru^ est, etc.
It is a hard thing, that such deacons as have not found the gift of sole life,
should be compelled to abstain A suis vxoribus, that is, from their own
wives, in the which words (their own wives) no man can deny, but that by
Gregory's judgment, the marriage of a Priest was a marriage. Ponet.

Doctor Gracian, 26. q. 2. so.
a principal Doctor of the Popes side, says thus: Copula sacerdotalis, etc.
Priests marriage is not forbidden by any authority either of the Law of Moses,
or of the Gospel, or of the Apostles. Jewel. fol. 171.

Clement Alexandrinus says: Clement stro. Mat. li. 3.
Omnes Apostol. Epistolae, etc. All the Epistles of the Apostles, which teach
sobriety and continent life, whereas they contain inuumerable precepts
touching Matrimony, bringing up of children and government of house, yet they
never forbad honest and lawful marriage. Jew.

The Canon commonly called of the Apostles does excommunicate a Bishop or a
Clearke, Canon of the Apo.
that does put away his wife, under the color of Religion.

The Council of Chalcedon. Council of Chalcedon.
Canon. 13. forbids Clearkes to marry wives of a contrary religion, as Jews
and Pagans, but not simply forbids them, much less would allow them to put
away their lawful wives.

By whom marriage of Priests was forbidden.
About the year of our Lord. 1074. Gregory Gregory.
the 7. was Bishop of Rome. He decreed that Priests should have no more wives,
and that they which already had, should be divorced: and that no man should
thenceforth be admitted to Priesthood, but they vowed perpetual chastity.
Against this decree repugned the Bishops and Priests of Germany, and withstood
it a long season.

About the year of Christ. 1106. the Priests of England were constrained to
forgo their wives, by means of Anselme Anselme.
Archbishop of Canterbury.

The saying of Hierocles, concerning marriage.
It is mere folly (says he) and lack of wit, Hieroclis.
which make those things that of themselves are easy to be born, troublesome,
and make a wife a grievous clogge unto her husband, for marriage to many men
has been intolerable: not because that wedding state is by default of it
self, or own proper nature so troublesome and comberous, but for our
matching, as we should not, it falls out as we would not, and causes our
marriages to be grievous and noi^ome. To this end verily our daily marriages
do commonly come. For they marry wives usually not for the begetting of
children or society of life: but some for a great dowry, some for a
beautiful body, and some being seduced by such kind of cautiles, as it were
men abused by unfaithful counsailers, have no regard to the disposition and
manners of their spouse, but marry at adventures to their own decay and utter
destruction. Bullinger. fol 228.

The Latin Church had her married Priests a long season, as testifies the
story of Sericij the Pope, which first labored in Spain to divorce Priests
from their wives, albeit y^ Priests of Spain refused to obey the decree of
Sericij, Mat. 19. 6
having for their patron and defense, the Bishop of Tarracony, aunswering the
Bishop of Rome, and reciting the saying of the Gospel, which forbids
marriage to be dissolved. To the which (says Melancthon) Siricius wrote again
so arrogantly, and so foolishlye, that marvel it is to see so great
ignorance, audacitie, impiety, and so great tyranny to have had reigned then
in their church. For he rebukes says he) honest married men, and calls them
contumeliously the defenders of lechery, sull foolishly wrasting Paul's saying:
Romans 8. 1^
If ye live after the flesh, ye shall dye, to make against Matrimony. If there
were then (says Melancthon) so great foolsh ignorance in the man, as to
think wedlock reviled and dampened by this text: surely Sircius had been more
meet to have rowed in a gally, or to have holden the plough, then to have had
that seat, therein to sit and govern the Church of Christ. To live after the
flesh, what it is.
Or else if he did so mock out this thing wittinglye, his shameless
rescription is more worthy to be abhorred and hated, then his fond ignorance.
For to live after the flesh, is to fall against the commandments of God, and
not to signify the honest use of chaste wedlock, or lawfully to use meat and
drink, according to Gods precept. Melancthon in a little book he wrote to
King Henry the. 8. in the defense of Priests Marriage.

The use of Marriage among the Chaldeans.
The Chaldeans honored the fire for their God, and had this usage among them,
that none was suffered to have fire in his house, but those y^ were married, for
the custody of Gods (said they) might be committed to none but married and
ancient folks. And this was their order in marriage. The day when any
person should be married, Marriage of the Chaldea^s
the Priest came into the house to light new fire, the which never ought to be
put out until the hour of his death. And if perchance during the life of the
husband and of the wife, they should find the fire dead and put out, the
marriage between them was dead and undone, yea, though they had been xl. years
married. And of this occasion came the Proverb, which of many is read, and of
few understood, that is to wit, Provoke me not too much, that I throw water
into the fire. The Chaldeans used such words when they would divorce or separate
the marriage. For if the woman were ill contented with her husband, in casting
a little water on the fire, immediately she might marry with an other. And if
the husband like did put out the fire, he might with an other woman contract
marriage. I pray God there be none(at this day) among the Christians, that would
be content to put out the fire, and to cast out the ashes and all to be at
liberty. Cynna Catul.

MARINVS.
Of this man's heretical opinion.
MArinus the Arrian, Heretic.
thought that the Father was a Father when there was no son. Such as were of
this opinion, were called Psathyrians, the reason why, is to be seen in
Socrates, li. 5. chap. 22.

MARK.
Of the life of Saint Mark the Evangelist.
Mark the Disciple and interpreter of Peter, being desired of the brethren at
Rome, wrote a short Gospel, according as he heard Peter pr^ach and show every
thing by mouth. The which gospel ye same Peter after he had herd it, did allow
and publish by his authority, because it should be read in ye congregation as
records Clement in ye 6. book of his work entitled Dispositiones. Of this
Mark, Papius also Bishop of Jerusalem, makes mention. And Peter in his first
Epistle, where under the name of Babylon by a figurative manner of speaking,
he understands Rome. The congregation of them which at Babylon are
companions of your election, saluteth you, and so does Mark my son.
Wherefore he took the Gospel that he himself had written, and went into
Egypt, and first of all men preached Christ at Alexandria, where he ordained
a Church or congregation of such pure doctrine and perfect living, that he made
all that professed Christ to follow his example. To be short, philo the
eloquentest writer of y^ Jews, perceiving the first congregation of Alexandria,
yet to persevere in the Jewish religion, wrote a book of their conversation, as
it were in the praise of his Nation, and as Luke shows how all things were
common among the believers at Jerusalem. So did he put in writing all that
ever he see done at Alexandria, during the time that Mark there taught and
preached. He died in the eight year of Neros reign, and was buried at
Alexandria. In whose place succeeded Aniamis. Erasmus.

Of the martyrdom of this Evangelist.
This Mark was the first Bishop of Alexandria, and preached the Gospel in
Egypt, and there drawn with ropes unto the fire was burned, and afterward
buried in a place called there Bucolus, under the reign of Traianus the
Emperor. Book of Mar. fol. 52.

What the Mark in the right hand signifies.
And made all, etc. to receive a mark in their right hand, Apoc. 13. 16
and in their forehead, etc. Whereby he (meaning the Pope) renounseth Christ:
for as faith, the word, and the Sacraments are y^ christians marks, so this
Antechrist will accept none, but such as will approve his doctrine: so that it
is not enough to confess Christ, and believe the Scriptures, but a man must
subscribe to y^ popes doctrine. Moreover, their chrismatories, greasings,
vows, oaths, and shauings, are signs of this mark. Insomuch y^ no nation was
excepted, y^ had not many of these marked beasts. Ge.

Marks to know the false Apostles by.
There are two marks to know the false Apostles by: The one is when they leave
Christ and serve their bellies, the other when they regard not the holy
Scriptures and preach lies, and their own fantasies, as S. Paul says, they
serve not Christ, but their own bellies, and with sweet and flattering words,
deceive the hearts of the innocents. Romans 6. 18.

MARS STREET.
What Mars street is.
Paul stood in the midst of Mars street. This was a place so called as you
would say, Act. 17. 22
Mars hill, where the Judges sat, which were called Areopagitae, upon weighty
affairs, which in old time arrained Socrates, and afterward condemned him of
impiety. Theo. Beza.

MARTYR.
What makes a Martyr.
IT is not the death, but the cause of the death that makes a Martyr. Saint
Austen Augustine
says: Tres erant in cruce, etc. There were three hanged on the cross: The
just was the Savior: the second to be saved, the third to be dampened: The
pain of all three was one, but the cause was diverse. Jewel. fol. 30.

It is no hard matter by words to testify the truth. But those testimonies are
most weighty, which are sealed with blood and with death. Howbeit this is to
be known (as Augustine puts us in mind) that the pains and punishments
or death make not martirs, but the cause. For otherwise many suffer many
grievous things, which yet are not martirs for the same. Augustine to
Bonifacius of the correction of the Donatists, and in many other places
testifies, that there were in his time Circumcelliones, a furious kind of
men, which if they could find none that would kill them, oftentimes threw
themselves down headlong, and killed themselves. These men (says he) are not
to be counted for martirs. Wherefore there seem to be three things required to
cause a man to be a martyr. First, that the doctrine which he defends be
true, and agreeable with the holy Scriptures. The second is, that there be
joined integrity and innocence of life, that he not only by his death, but
also by his life and manners do edify the Church. The third is, that they
seek not to dye for boasting sake, or desire of name or fame, etc. Pet. Mar.
upon the Romans fo. 233.

How Martirs ought not to be worshipped.
Cyrillus Cyrllius.
in his sixth book Contra Iulianum says, We neither say that the holy Martirs
are Gods, neither are we wont to worship them, but rather we do honor them
with lauds and praises, because they did stoutly fight for the truth, y^ they
might keep the sincerity of faith.

MASS.
How the Mass (as they call it) was used at the first.
FIrst they said Confiteor and acknowledged themselves to be sinners. And then
the Priest prayed in general for all estates and degrees, and for increase of
grace, and in especially if need required. Unto which prayers the people
harkened and said, Amen. And then the Gospel and glad tidings of sorgiuenesse
of sins was preached, to stir our faith, and then the Sacrament was
ministered, for the confirmation of y^ faith of the Gospel, and of the
testament made between God and us of ^orgiuenesse of sins in Christ's blood
for our repentance and faith. As ye see, how after all bargains, there is a
sign thereof made, either clapping of hands, or bowing a penny or a grote, or
a piece of gold, or giving some earnest. And as I showed you, after a truse
made, they slew beasts for a confirmation. And then men departed every man to
his business, full certified that their sins were forgiven, and armed with
the remembrance of Christ's passion and death, for y^ mortifieng of the flesh
all the day after. And in all these was neither the Sacrament, neither other
ceremonies of the Mass, Image service to God, and holy deeds to make
satisfaction for our sins, or to purchase such worldly things, as the Gospel
teaches us to despise. And now compare this use of the Mass to ours and see
whether y^ Mass be not become y^ most damnable Idolatry and Image service that
ever was in the world Tindale. fol. 427.

How the Popish Mass is falsified upon S. James.
The Papists do brag that S. James did use their manner of Mass at
Jerusalem: S. Mark at Alexandria, and S. Peter at Antioch. But they have no
history touching this matter worthy. Though they used y^ Lords supper as
Christ our Master did, and as Paul also at Corinth, yet they did not use it,
as the peevish Papists do now the Mass. That Ignatius, Policarpus, and
Ireneus make mention of, is not like the popish Mass. They confess y^
Basilius Magnus, Hierome and Ambrose, used an other order in the administration
of the Lords supper, then is now used, and that diverse have used diverse
fashions therein by their own words. Therefore it is manifest that this kind
of Massing is not the ordinance of Christ, but inverted by man's wit and
policy, without the word of God. Thus says the prechers of the Gospel at
Basil. Bibliander.

S. Gregory Saint Gregory.
says, that the Apostles had no peculiar manner in celebrating the Mass, but
that they only said y^ Lords prayer, whose words be these: The manner of the
Apostles was, y^ only at the saying of the Lords prayer they consecrated the
sacrament D. Barnes. fol. 356.

By whom the Popish Mass was patched.
Who so list to know the often alterations and chaunges of the Mass, let them
read Platina, and Polidore Virgil, touching the same, and there shall they
find, how and by whom, and upon what occasion, and in what process of time
all the parts of the Mass were peeced and set together. And that in the space
of seven hundred years, surely and with much ado, it was made up at last, and
brought to some perfection. Jewel.

How the Mass is not a sacrifice propiciatorie.
It is proved by Saint Paul in his Epistle to the Hebrews, Heb. 9. 28
that the offering of the Priest in the Mass, or the appointing of his
ministration at his pleasure, to them that be quick or dead, cannot merit or
deserve, neither to himself nor to them for who^ he sings or says, the
remission of their sins, but y^ such popish doctrine is contrary to the
doctrine of the Gospel, and injurious to the sacrifice of Christ. For if only
the death of Christ, be the oblation, sacrifice, and price, wherefore our sins
be pardoned, then the act or ministration of the Priest, cannot have the same
office. Wherefore it is abominable blasphemy, to give that office or dignity
to a Priest, which pertains only to Christ: or to affirm that the Church
need of any sacrifice: as who should say, that Christ's sacrifice were not
sufficient for the remission of our sins, or else that his sacrifice should
hang upon the sacrifice of a Priest. Cranmer.

MASSILIANI.
Of the opinions of these Heretics.
MAssiliani, were idle Monks, whom the devil had possessed, they said that the
body of Christ in the Sacrament, did neither good neither harm. They said
Baptime was to no purpose. Lentus Bishop of Melitena drove the thieves out of
their dens, the wolves from among the sheep, and set the Monastaries on
fire. Theodoretus. li. 4. chap. 11. These heretics were called also Euchitae, so
called because of their continual praieng. It is a wonder says Augustine, to
hear what a number of prayers they run over (much like unto the late mumbling
of prayers upon beads) where Christ said, pray always, and S. Paul, Pray
without intermission, which is devoutly to be taken for every day, they do it
too much, and therefore says Augustine, to be nu^bred among heretics. They say
when the soul is purged, y^ a Sow with her pigs is seen to come out of man's
mouth, and that a visible fire enters in, which burns not. These Euchits
did think that it apperteined not unto Monks, to get their living with y^ sweat
of their brows, but to live idly. Epiphanius says, that when Luppicianus the
Praetor executed some of them for their lewdness, they called themselves
Martirianos. Some of them thought that it was their duty to worship the
devil, least he should hurt them. These were called Satiniani. If ye called
any of them Christ, a Patriarch, a Prophet, or an Angel, he would answer that
he was. They slept like Swine, men and women all in one heap. August. li de
haeraes. Epi. haer. 80. These Massilians were condemned in the general
counsel held at Ephesus in the time of Theodosius lunior. Cyril. li. Apologet.

MASTER.
What the Masters office is to the Servant.
Ye Masters do unto your servant that which is just and right, Col. 4. 1.
putting away all bitterness and threatnigs, Ephe. 6. 9.
knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.

The Pharesies dissembling in calling Christ Master.
Master, we know that thou art true. This is a deceitful dissimulation, they
are not ashamed of inconstancy, by the which they now call him Master,
whereas before they blasphemed him, saying, that he had the spirit of Belzabub,
even so in an other place, the Pharesies which were the Masters of these
Ambassadors, said unto Christ, Master, we would see a sign of thee. And
again, Master, this woman was taken in adultery. But they called him
Master, whose disciples they would not be: for they said unto that beggar, to
whom Christ restored his sight, be thou his Disciple, for we are Moses
Disciples. Here the Proverb is fulfilled, Such lips such lettice. The
Pharesies were dissemblers and hypocrites, and their Disciples follow them in
all points. Marl. fo. 502.

MATTHEW.
The life of Saint Matthew, written by Saint Hierome.
Matthew, which was otherwise also called Leuy, being of a publican made an
Apostle, first of al other composed and wrote in Iewry the Gospel of Christ in
the Hebrew tongue, for their behoof and cause, which being of the circumcision
had believed: which Gospel, what person did afterward translate into Greek,
it is not very certeynly known. But truly the very Hebrew it self is had
even until this present day in y^ Library of Cae(...)(...)(...)e, which
Library Pamphilus the martyr, did with all possible studiousnesse set up and
make. And I my self also had the same Gospel of Matthew in Hebrewe lent me to
coppye it out, of the Nazarites which in Beroea a City in Syria, do use the
same book, wherein is to be noted and observed, y^ wheresoever the Evangelist
either in his own person, or else of the person of our Savior, does use any
allegations of the old Testament, he does not follow the authority of
Septuaginta, that is to say, of the threescore and ten translaters, but of the
Hebrew. Of the which sort are set forth these two citations here ensuing: Out
of Egypt have I called my son: And for a Nazarite shall he be called.
Erasmus.

MATRIMONY.
Look. Marriage.

MEDIATOVR.
Proves that Jesus Christ is the only Mediator between God and man.
There is one God and one mediator between God and man, Tim. 2. 5.
which is the man Christ Jesus. If there be but one mediator, as Saint Paul
says there is not, then cannot Saints come to make mo then one. Saints cannot
be mediators for other, because they have need of a mediator themselves. D.
Barnes.

Christ is our mouth wereby we speak unto the Father, Ambrose
our eyes whereby we see the Father, our right hand whereby we offer our
selves to the Father, without whose intercession, neither we, nor all the
Saints, have ought to do with God. Ambrose in his book of Isaac and the soul.

We have all things in Christ: Ambrose
If thou desire to be cured of thy wounds, he is thy Physician: If thou be
grieved with thy sins, he is thy righteousness: If thou lack help, he is
thy strength: If thou fear death, he is thy life: If thou be in darkness, he
is light: If thou will go into heaven, he is thy way: If thou seek meat, he
is thy nourishment. Ambrose in his. 4. book upon Saint Luke.

We are reconciled and brought in favor again with God through Christ,
Augustine
which is the mediator, that of enemies we might be made sons.

Neither should we be delivered through him as only y^ mediator of God and
man Christ Jesus, if he were not also God. But when Adam was made, that is to
wit, a right man, he needed no mediator: but when as sins did separate and
sunder mankind far from God, we must be brought in favor again with God by
a mediator and a mean, which was only borne without sin, lived and was
slain, unto the rising again of the flesh, and to everlasting life. August in
his Enchirid. to Laurence, the. 32. chap.

Saint Paul says, 1. Tim. 2. 5
Vnus est Mediator, etc. There is one mediator between God and man Christ
Jesus being man^ Upon this place S. Austen says thus: Paulus non facet se
mediatorem, etc. Paul makes not himself a mediator between God and the
people, but requires that they pray all one for an other, being all the
members of the body of Christ. August. contra Epist. perminiani. li. 2. chap.
8. Again in the same book he writes thus of Saint John. St. Johannes ita
dicerit, etc. If John would say, this have I written unto you, that ye sin
not, and if ye sin, ye have me your mediator before God, and I will entreat
for your sins, as Permenian (the heretic) in a certain place made the
Bishop a mediator between God and the people, what good and faithful christen
man could abide him? Who would look upon him as the Apostle of Christ, and not
rather to think him to be Antechrist.

Tell me woman, Chrisosto^
since thou art a sinful and wicked woman how durst thou go unto him, I know,
says she, what I do. Behold the wisdom of the woman, She prays not unto
James: She entreats not John: She goes not unto Peter: She did not get her
self unto the company of the Apostles: She sought for no mediator, but for
all those things: She took repentance for her companion, which did fulfill the
room and place of an advocate, and so she did go to the high fountain.
Chrisost. in his. 12. Ho. of the woman of Ca.

There is no need of porter, Chrisosto^
of a mediator of minister, say only, Lord have mercy upon me, we have no
need of advocates with God, nor of any running and gadding about, for to
speak fair unto other. For although thou be alone and without an advocate,
and pray unto God by thy self, thou shall obtain thy petition. Chrysostom
in his Sermon of going forward in the Gospel.

Saint Austen says, August. li. contra Liar. in cap. 8.
Christen men do mutally commend themselves in their prayers. But he for whom
none makes intercession, but he for all, he is the only and true mediator.
Paul the Apostle, though he were a principal member under y^ head, (yet
because he was a member of the body of Christ, and knew that the greatest and
truest Priest of the Church entered, not by a figure into the inward places of
the veil to heaven, to a holiness, not shadowish, Romans 15. 30
but eternal) commends himself also to the prayers of the faithful, neither
does he make himself a mediator between the people and God, but prays that
all the members of the body of Christ should mutuallye pray for him, because
the members are careful one for another of all ye members yet travailing in
earth, 1. Co. 12. 20
may ascend to the head which is gone before into heaven, in whom is apeacement
for our sins. For if Paul were a mediator, ye other Apostles should also be
mediators: and if there were many mediators, then neither Paul's own reason
stood fast, in which he had said, for there is one God, and one mediator
between God and men, Ephe. 4. 3.
the man Christ, in who^ we also are one, if we keep the unity of faith in
the bond of peace. Again in another place, but it thou seek for a Priest, he
is above the heavens, where he makes intercession for thee, which in earth died
for thee. Yet do we not dream, y^ he falls down at the fathers knees: and
in humble wise entreats for us: but we understand by the Apostle ye he so
appears before the face of God, that the virtue of his death avails to be a
perpetual intercession for us: yet so that being entered into the Sanctuary
of heaven, unto the end of the ages of the world, he alone carries to God
the prayers of the people, abiding far off in the porch. Calvin in his
Instit. ^. book, chap. 20. Sect. 20.

Brethren (says Saint Austen) we have Jesus Christ the just for our advocate
with the Father, he is the propiciation for our sins. He which held this
committed no heresy: he which held this opinion committed no Scisme. For
whereupon are Scismes committed? When men do say we be just, we do make
holy unclean, we do justify the wicked, we do desire and we do obtain.
But I beseech you by the way, how much more past shame be they which do say,
we do determine, we do command, and what said John: And if a man do
sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just. But some man
will say: Do not the Saints then pray for us? Do not the Bishops and
superintendentes pray for the people? Mark the Scriptures, and see that the
overseers also do commend themselves to the people. For the Apostle says to
the people prayeng togethers for us also. The Apostle prays for the people,
and the people prayed for the Apostle: we do pray for you brethren, but pray
fo us also. Let all the members pray together one for an other, and let the head
make means for all. This says Augustine in y^ place, in which words he does
plainly and openly attribute the office of intercession, which perteyneth to
the chief Priest to none but to Christ the head. Again he writes thus: But
if the Apostle should have said thus: This I write unto you, to the intent ye
should not sin, and in case any man do sin, you have a mediator to the
Father. I do pray for your sins, (as Perminian^s in one place does make the
Bishop mediator between the people and GOD) what good and faithful
Christen folks could abide him? Who would esteem him as y^ Apostle of Christ,
and not rather an Antichrist, for all christen men do commend themselves one to
an other in their prayers, but he for whom none does entreat, but he himself
entreats for all. He is y^ only and true mediator, and forasmuch as the
figure of him was resembled in the Priest of the old Testament, there is none
sound the^^ that ever prayed for the Priest. Musculus. fol. 149.

The man Christ Jesus alone, Basil.
which gave himself a ransom for all men, is our sufficient mediator,
advocate, and intercessour, as the holy Scripture teaches in diverse places.
Whosoeeuer therefore refuses to pray unto this man Christ Jesus, to be his
mediator and advocate unto God the father, and flies to other, without all
doubt he is an enemy unto Christ, and to the uttermost of his power he
labors to make Christ as they use to say, Ia^ke out of office. For since the
time of his ascension, his chief and principal office is to be our
intercessour, mediator, and advocate.

MEEK.
Who are meek.
THe meek, Mat. 5. 5.
are such as are not easilye provoked by injuries, who by every offense are not
wayward and froward, but are rather ready to suffer any thing. then they will
be like unto the wicked: Romans 12. 21
finally, they are such which do not resist evil, but do overcome evil,
(...) doing that which is good. Marl. fol. 77.

How the meek shall pssesse the earth.
Blessed are the meek, Mat. 5. 5.
for they shall possess the earth. By the earth understand all that we
possess in this world, which all God will keep for us, if we be soft and
meek, And whatsoever (...) arise, yet if we will be patient and abide, the end
will go^ on our side. As it is written in the Psalm. 37. 9. The wicked shall
be weeded out, but they that abide the Lords leisure shall inherit the land.
And again, within a while the wicked shall be gone, thou shall see his place
where he was, and he shall be away, but the meek shall inherit the earth,
Even as, Be still, and have thy wilt, and of a little meddling comes great
(...) for a patient man shall wear out all his en^mied. Tindale. fo. 210.

How that God does guide the Meek in judgment. Dirigit mansu^tos in iudicio,
docebit mitos via^ suas.
Them that be meek shall be guide in judgment, Psa. 25. 9.
and such as be gentle, them shall he teach his ways. To guide y^ meek in
judgment, is not meant only to be their help only when they shall come
before the Judges of this world, but to guide them in judgment, i^ here
meant, to make them through his grace and knowledge of his law, to live orderly
and uprightly in all their doings with right judgment and true discerning of
virtue from vice. This great gift does God of his gracious goodness, give unto
men that be sinners: but yet says the Prophet, not to all manner of sinners,
but only to those y^ be meek and gentle. Vniuersa via Domini misericordia and
veritas, requirentibus testamentum eius and testimonia eius, All the ways of
the Lord are mercy and truth, but yet says the Prophet, Requirentibus
testamentum eius and testimonia eius. Unto such as keep his covenant and
testimonies, To the sturdy and rebellious sinners: Via Dominni odor mortis
fuit, The ways of y^ Lord is a deadly savor, and a pestilent stink, which
nevertheless of themselves, and namely to all good men, are Odor vitae, the
sweet odor of life. So that to the wicked, the ways of the Lord, and his
commandments are the occasion of their great damnation, but unto the meek
and such as fear the Lord, they are light unto life ouerlasting, through the
mercy and truth granted unto us, in and by Jesus Christ our Lord. Ri^. Turn.

MELCHISEDECH.
How he is a figure of Christ.
WIthout Father, Heb. 7. 3.
without Mother, without kin, etc. So called, because that Moses makes no
mention of his parents and kinsfolks, but as he had been sodeinly sent of God
into the world, to be a figure of Christ, or everlasting Priest, and shortly
taken out of the world again. So Christ as touching his humanity had no
Father, and concerning his divinity had no mother. Geneua.

It is said that Melchisedech is without father and mother, because that no
mention at all in Scriptures is made of his parents, nor yet of his genealogy.
And thus does the Scripture declare, y^ he is a lively figure of Christ, which
as touching his Godbead is without mother, being begotten of his father without
all beginnings, and as touching his manhood is without father, being conceived
by the mighty operation of the holy Ghost. Sir. I. Cheek.

How Melchisedech and Sem is one person.
Lyra says, that Melchisedech was the same person which in Scripture is called
Sem, the first son of No^. And S. Paul Heb. 7. says that Melchisedech was
without father, without mother, without kin, and has neither beginning of
his days, nor yet end of his life. So that by this it should seem
Melchisedech and Sem, not to be one person. To this, answer is made on this
wise, that the Apostle reports Melchisedech to be without father and mother,
because the Scripture makes no mention of them, and not that he was without
parents and kinsfolks, etc. For although y^ Scripture make mention of y^ father
and mother of Sem, and of his Genelogie, yet it is not under the name of
Melchisedech, but under the name of Sem. And so is y^ Apostle to be understood,
that under the name of Melchisedech, no mentton is made in the Scripture of his
father and mother. Lyra.

The meaning of Saint Paul in making mention of Melchisedech.
Saint Paul writing to the Hebrews, goes about to dissuade them from the
vain confidence they had in the sacrifices and ceremonies of Moses law, and
to persuade them to put their trust in that only sacrifice that Christ had
offered himself once for all. And least they should reject his doctrine, as
having no ground in holy Scriptures, he puts them in mind of Melchisedech,
who was a figure of Christ, and of his Priesthood: which was also a figure of
Christ's Priesthood. First, he was a figure of Christ (says Saint Paul) in
that he was called Melchisedech, which is by interpretation the king of
righteousness, and the king of Salem, which is the king of peace. And in that
he was a Priest of the most high God, and has neither beginning nor end of
days noted in holy histories: his Priesthood seemed to be an everlasting
Priesthood, and therefore (says Saint Paul) he is likened to the son of God
that is everlasting, and has an everlasting Priesthood, and is alwaie able to
save them, that seek salvation at his hands, because he lives ever to make
intercession for us. This is the mind of Paul. And not that Melchisedech was
a figure of Christ and of his Priesthood, in that he used to offer to God a
sacrifice of bread and wine, etc. Crowley.

How Melchisedech is brought in of the Papists to maintain the sacrifice of
the Mass.
Melchisedech (say they) was a figure of Christ, for he was y^ Priest of the
highest. And as David says, Christ is an eternal Priest, after the order of
Melchisedech, and therefore he offered bread and wine undoubtedly. Melchisedech
was a figure of Christ, but Saint Paul manifestlye declares in what things
he was the figure of Christ. In the rehearsing of the honors and dignity of
Melchisedech, which is, that he was an eternal Priest, and king of peace and
righteousness. There is not one word of bread and wine. They cannot find in
the book of Genesis that Melchisedech did sacrifice unto God, but that he
offered bread and wine to Abraham, for sustenaunce of his people, as Christ
offered to us his word. Melchisedech brought bread and wine, and Abraham paid
him tithe. Christ after the same sort gave us the Sacrament of his body and
blood, but he did not offer it to God. The Scripture shows forth
Melchisedech under the figure of an eternal and only Priest.

But the Papists appoint other Priests to be Christ's Uicars, after his
ascension into heaven. If a man should agree with them that Christ offered to God
bread and wine, yet they cannot prove that he killed himself in sacrifice
under bread and wine. Also if Christ offered nothing but bread and wine, the
Priests of the old law did much better, in killing of living creatures, to
offer them in sacrifice. The Papists cannot tell what to say. And when they
bring authority of Scripture, it makes against, and are confuted with their
own saying, as one that is slain with his own weapon. This is the exposition
of the Prechers of Basil.

Of the heresy of these heretics called Melchisedechiani.
Melchisedechiani were heretics Heretics.
which honored Melchisedech, and said that he was greater then Christ, and
that he was no man. Epiph. heraes. 55.

MEAN.
How the mean is best.
THe counsel that Phoebus gave to Phaeton his son, has never hurt any man,
which is this: Medio tutissimus ibis. The best way is to tempt the mean or the
midst, neither to be discouraged in y^ reading of y^ scriptures, because of
the multitude of the great difficults therein, neither yet to be too bold with
the plainness of certain places, to take upon thee to discuss the high and
mystical places thereof: keeping this rule, ye shall find the words of the
Prophet most true: The testimony of y^ Lord gives wisdom to all men, that be
simple, and meek, and lowly in heart. Ri. Turnar.

MENANDER.
Of this man's erroneous opinions.
MEnander a Sorcerer and the Disciple of Simon Magus, Heretic.
a Samaritane, said that he was the great power of God come down from heaven,
that the world was made by Angels, he called himself a Savior, he said
salvation was to be purchased by his Baptime, and that such as were therewith
baptized, should never die, no not in this world. Euse. li. 3. chap. 23.
Ireneus. li. 1. chap. 21. Epiph. heraes. 22.

MEAN.
The interpretation of this word.
SOme do thus divide it, Dan. 5. 25
that both the years of the life of the king, and also the time of the kings
reign was numbered. But this subtlety seems not substantial. Therefore I
think (says Calvin) that this word was added twice, for confirmatition: as
though the Prophet should say, y^ the number was now fulfilled. For in account
it is easy to fail, as the proverb says. Wherefore y^ Balthazar might
understand that his life and his kingdom was now at an end, God does affirm
that the number is full and perfect: as though he should say that there should
not be added one minute of an hour to the term appointed. And thus does
Daniel himself interpret the same. God (says he) has numbered thy kingdom,
that is, God has appointed and determined an end of thy kingdom, so that it
must needs come to an end, because the time is accomplished, etc. Calvin upon
Daniel. fol. 89.

This word (Mean) is doubled, not only to exaggerate the certainty of the
matter, but also as some think, the one to signify the end of the King, the
other the end of the kingdom. The Bible note.

This word (Mean) is twice written, for the certainty of the thing, showing
that God had most surely counted. Signifieng also, that God has appointed a
term for all kingdoms, and that a miserable end shall come on all, that
raise themselves against him. Geneua.

MEN PLEASERS.
Who they be, that please men.
Do I now persuade men or God? Gal. 1. 10
Either do I seek to please men. Paul purges himself from the slanders of
those his enemies, that said he sought the peoples favor by his flattering
tongue, to the intent he might brag of the multitude of his scholars, and so to
be praised of men. Men in Scripture is taken for sinners: These please men,
that please the wicked, wherefore let us please the godly and displease the
wicked. 1. Cor. 10.
These please men, that teach men's traditions. D. H.

What it is to be men servant, or servant of men.
Be not men servant. 1. Co. 7. 23.
To be men servant, or the servant of men here, is to do any thing for
the favor of men, by which they fall from the favor of God, while they
dispising Christ, do hang on men, more regard men's precepts and ordinances,
then the institutions of God, yea, then God himself. This forbids S. Paul
here, and not to deny to be servant unto our Masters to whom we be bound,
according to the common order appointed in Commonwealths, to these we are
straightlye commanded in sundry places of the Scripture, to be with love and
diligence, in all things agreeable to Gods holy word. Tindale.

MERCES.
As concerning this Latin word, Merces.
Look. Reward.

MERCY.
What mercy is, and how it is defined.
CIcero does define mercy to be the sorrow of the mind and grief conceived
upon the misery of some other, ready to aids the same.

Seneca in his book De clementia says, that mercy is the grief of mind,
had upon the seeming of the miseries of others, or else the sorrow conceived for
other men's evils, which it is thought that they deserve not.

Augustine says, what is mercy? but a certain compassion in our heart of
some others misery, whereby we be compelled to help them if we can. For who
knows not that mercy is named of that, that it makes a man's heart miserable
and pitiful, sorrowing for another man's evil. So they do define mercy
commonly to be touched and stricken within in the heart, with the misery of
others. The Hebrews do call mercy by this word (...) which word does properly
signify ye belly, and they do apply it unto the signification of mercy,
because y^ the inward parts of them, which be touched with y^ sight of other
men's miseries, are wont to be moved with some affection of compassion and pity.
Mus. fo. 978.

What it is to have mercy, or be merciful.
To have mercy or be merciful, is to have compassion, Mat. 5. 7
and to feel another man's disease, and to mourn with them that mourn, and
suffer with them that suffer, and to help and succor them that are in
tribulation and adversity, and to comfort them with good counsel and
wholesome instruction, and loving words. And to be merciful, is lovingly to
forgive them that offend thee, as soon as they knowledge their misdoing, and
ask thee mercy. To be merciful, is patiently long to abide the conversion of
sinners, with a lusty courage and hope, that God will at the last convert
them, and in the mean time to pray instantly for them.

And to be merciful, is to interpret all things to the best, and to look
through the fingers at many things, and not to make a grievous sin of every
small trifle. And to suffer and forbear in his own cause, the malice of them
that will not repent, nor be a known of their wickedness, as long as he
can suffer it, and as long as it ought to be suffered, and when he can no
longer, then to complain to them that have authority to forbid wrong, and to
punish evil doers. Tindale.

Blessed are the merciful, Mat. 5. 7
for they shall obtain mercy. Here God has made a covenant with us, to be
merciful unto us, if we will be merciful one to another. So that the man
which shows mercy unto his neighbor, may be bold, to trust in GOD for
mercy at all needs. And contrariwise, Iame. 2. 13
judgment without mercy, shall be to him that shows not mercy. So now, if
he that shows no mercy, trust in God for mercy, his faith is carnal and
worldly, and but vain presumption. For God has promised mercy, only to the
merciful: and therefore the merciless have not Gods word that they shall have
mercy: but contrariwise that they shall have judgment without mercy. Tindale.

What is meant by mercy and truth.
Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: ^^o. 3. 3
bind them upon thy neck, and write them upon the table of thine heart. By
mercy and truth, he means the commandments of the first and second table,
or else the mercy and faithfulness that we ought to use toward our neighbors.
Keep them (says he) as a most precious Jewel, and have them ever in
remembrance. Genesis

MERRY.
How the children of God, may and ought to be merry.
TRue it is that the children of God, may will be merry when they have
prosperity: like as when God sends us wherewith to be fed and maintained,
when he deals so with us, as we want nothing, when he gives us health,
quietness, and all other like things: we may well be merry, yea, and we ought
so to be, according as it is said in the law, Thou shall eat and drink before
thy God and be merry. But yet must not the faithful settle their joy upon
the present benefits, nor hold themselves only tied unto them: yea, rather if
they want meat and drink, or be troubled with sickness, they must not
therefore cease to trust in God, but must learn Saint Paul's lesson, which is
to have skill both to be poor and rich, to endure hunger and scarcity, and
also to have abundaunce. Thus ye see that the mirth of Gods Children differs
greatly, from the mirth of the unbelievers and worldlyngs, etc. Calvin upon
Job.

MERIT.
What Merit is.
MErit is sometime taken for the work it self, which is taken to be
meritorious. In which sense, Augustine in a place says, that merit must go
before the reward. Sometime it is taken for the reward, which is worthily given
to him that works. The first sense is concerning him that works, the la^
concerns him that gives the reward to the other, etc. Musculus. fol. 234.

What merit of congruence is.
Some will have the merit of congruence Merit of co^grue^ce
to be, when although that he to whom the thing is given, be unworthy to have
it given him, and that his doing is not such, that it deserves it, yet that
it becomes him, to whom it is done to give him: As although the sinner
deserve no favor, yet it is convenient for God of his goodness, to forgive
the repentaunt, and to give him his grace. But some say that the merit of
congruence, is when a man of his own good motion coming by nature does
deserve the first grace, which they call the preventing grace.

What merit of worthiness is.
They call the merit of worthiness, Merit of worthiness
when the just person does entreat for the sinner. For they say, it is
worthy that the just be heard. So when grace is given to the sinner, at the
prayer of the just, they do attribute this to the merit of worthiness, that
is to say, of the just, which does make means for him.

What merit of condign is.
They will have the merit of condign Merit of co^digne.
to be, when a man helped by the first grace, does make himself by the first
grace, worthy of everlasting life, for he by that means doing well, is worthy
(they say) to have reward for his labor.

This pestilent plague of the Pelagians, is to be withstoode with all our
might, and we must firmly hold, that we cannot deserve neither grace nor
salvation by any strength or works of our own, for any merit, either of
congruence, worthiness, or condign, but that all is simply and merely to be
referred to the grace of God in Christ. You be saved through grace, by faith
(says the Apostle) and that not of your selves, it is the gift of God, not by
works, least any man might glory. After y^ schoolmens divinity we should
have said, you have deserved your first grace, by y^ good motion of your
hearts, produced of nature, but ye have not yet obtained salvation, but must
deserve the same by good works of condign: when Christ says, He that
believes in me, has life everlasting, he speaks not like a schooleman. For
he should have said, he that believes in me by the good motion picked out of
nature, he shall deserve the first grace, but he shall have everlasting life,
at that time when he has deserved it of a condignes, by his good works. Paul
calls not everlasting life, the merit of condignes, but the gift of God.
Therefore look how far wide this doctrine or the merit of congruence and
condign, is from the Scriptures, so far it is to be cast off from the ears
and hearts of the faithful. Musculus. fol. 235.

Objection.
THey object that saying of the Apostle: I have fought a good fight, I have
run out my race, I have kept my faith: for the rest there is laid up for me
a crown of justice, which which God shall restore me in that day, the just
Judge. Is not here mention made of both (say they) by the Apostle, both the
good work which he did, and the reward also, which he looked for of God.

Answer.
AVgustine answers, saying on this wise: The Lord (says he) shall render me
my crown, the just judge: Ergo, he owes it me: who shall render it thee
than: Ergo, he shall render it as a just Judge, for when he considers our
work, he cannot upon that consideration of the work, deny us a reward. I
have fought a good fight, 2. Ti. 4. 7.
it is a work: I have finished my race, it is a work: I have kept my faith,
it is a work: There remains a Crown of Justice for me, that is the reward.
As for thy reward, thou do nothing, and as for thy work thou do it not
alone: Thy Crown comes from him, and thy work from thy self, but yet not
without his help. And a little after: Therefore (thou see) when he does
render good things, he does prevent himself, giving good things to thee
before, to whom he may render good things also after: Lo, he rendereth
reward unto that good thing by the good works, to him that fought out his
fight, to him that ran out of his race, and kept his faith. He rendereth good
things, but for what good things? The same that he gave before himself. Did
not he give it thee to fight out thy good fight? If it were he that gave it
thee, why do thou say in another place, I have labored more then they all:
but not I, but the grace of God with me. Lo thou say again, I have run
out my race. Did not he give thee also to run out thy course? If he gave it
thee not to run out thy race, what is that thou say in another place: Romans
9. 16
It stands not in the willer nor in the runner, but in GOD which has mercy:
I have kept my faith, have thou kept thy faith, I know it, and am content
withal. I grant thou have kept, it. But unless the Lord do keep the City,
they do watch in vain that do keep it. Therefore thou have both fought out
thy good fight, and run out thy race, and kept thy faith, even through him as
ayding thee, and giving it to thee. Give me leave O Apostle, I know nothing of
thine own but naughtiness. Give me leave O Apostle, we say, that thou did
teach: I hear thee confessing God, I find thee not unthankful. But we
perfectly know that there be none of thine own things gotten to thee by thy
self, but evil things. Therefore when God does crown thy merits, he
crowns nothing else but his own gifts. Thus says Saint Austen. Musculus.
fol. 237.

How we can merit nothing after our death.
When thou art departed from hence (says S. Austen Augustine
) thou shall be received according to thy deserts, and shall rise again to
receive that which thou have done. Then God shall crown not so much thy
merits, as his own gifts. This says he. And Hierom Hierome.
after he had recited the opinion of them, which do hold that after we be
departed out of this life, we may both hurt reasonable creatures, and do good,
yet he does expound that place of Ecclesiasticus Eccl. 9. 5
(The dead knows nothing, and there is no reward any more for them) in this
wise: They y^ do live, may for fear of death do good works, but they which be
dead, can add nothing to that which they have carried hence with them out of
this life. Item, They can neither do justly nor sin, not add neither virtue
nor vice. This says he. And no doubt, there is one season to work in, and
another season to receive for that which a man has wrought in this life. And
men shall be judged at the judgment to come, not for the works or merits
which be done after this life, but for the same which is done in this body, as
the Apostle says. Wherefore it appears that we have no merit, neither before
this life, nor in this life, S. Austen
neither after this life. Muscu. fol. 234.

Augustine says, God does many things in man, which man does not: but man does
nothing which God makes not man to do. Wherefore we must in any wise beware,
that we do not so establish man's merits, that we do make void y^ grace of
Christ, and contemn the justice of God. For merit and grace be so contrary
one to another, that as Barnard says, there is no means for grace to enter,
where merit does keep place. Musculus. fol. 238.

Proves, that the merit of man is nothing auailable to purchase salvation.
Say ye, that we be unprofitable servants, for notwithstanding we have done
all things that are commanded, yet have we done no good thing, for if our
doings were good indeed, then were we not unprofitable: but any good deed of
ours is called good, not rightly or duly, but by abuse of speech. Origin Origin
in his 8. treaty upon Math.

He that trusts not to his own deeds, Basile
nor hops so be justified by his works, has the only hope of his salvation
in the mercy of God. Basil upon the 32. Psalm.

This is our full and perfect reioicing in God, Basile
when we acknowledge that we are void of any of our righteousness, and are
justified by only faith in Christ. Basil. in his book of humility.

I say not unto the Lord: despise not the works of my hands: I have sought the
Lord with my hands, Agust. in his book upon the 117. Psalm
and was not deceived. But I do not praise or commend the works of my hands.
For I am afraid, least when thou look upon them, thou shall find more
sins than merits. This only I say, this I pray, this I cover, Despise not
the works of thine hands. See thine own work in me, and not mine: for if
thou see mine, thou do condemn, if thou see thine, thou crownest. For
all the good works that I have, they come of thee.

First of all thou must believe that thou can not have remission of sins
but through pardon and forgiveness of God. Barn. in his ser. of the Ann. of
the Vir. Mary
And then next, that thou can have no good work, except he give it thee.
Last of all, that everlasting life cannot be deserved with any works, except
it be given unto thee also freely.

What worthy thing do we, that we may be found in the heavenly spirits. The
Apostle says: I judge that the afflictions of this time, are not worthy of
that glory that shall be revealed in us, therefore I take him to be the sounder
Divine, the faithfuller Catholic, and more agreeable to the holy scriptures,
that utterly denies all such kind of merits. Waldensis Waldensis.
in his book against Wicleffe.

Meritum meum, etc. Bar. in Ps. qui habi.
My merit (says Saint Barnard) is the mercy of God. So long as God is not
poor of mercy, so long cannnot I be poor of merit. If his mercy be great
then am I great in merit. This is the whole merit of man, if he put his whole
affiaunce in the Lord.

Forasmuch as all men are shut up and closed under sin, Orige. ad Rom li 9.
chap. 12.
now the salvation of man stands not in man's merits, but in Gods mercy.

For nothing thou should save them. What is meant by these words, Augustine
For nothing thou should save them? This is the meaning, Thou find
nothing in them, wherefore thou should save them, and yet thou sauest them.
Thou find nothing wherefore thou should save them, but thou find
wherefore thou should save them, but thou find wherefore thou should
condemn them. Aug de verbis Apostoli. sermo. 15.

Again, Deserved pain would throw all men into death, unless the undeserved
grace of God, delivered some from it.

Trust in men's merits, leads to desperation, and therefore S. Cypriane says,
Cypri. de sim. prael.
They teach us night in steed of day, destruction in steed of health,
desperation under the color of hope, infidelity under the pretense of faith,
Antichrist under the name of Christ.

Does he thank that servant. Luke 17. 9
Christ does here with a lively example teach us, that nothing is due to our
merits, or much rather that we deserve nothing at all. Our duty is to walk
diligently, and with all fear in the commandments of God, and if he
rewards us any thing, it is of his mercy and goodness. Sir. I. Cheek.

How the name of merit ought to be abolished.
The name of merit, if we will speak properly, ought to be banished out of our
mouths. I know that the fathers sometimes used that word, but yet not properly.
But that word is not found in all the holy Scriptures. For the nature of
merit is, that there be a just proportion and equal consideration, between
that which is given, and that which is taken. But between the good things
which we look for, and those things which we either suffer or do, there is no
proportion or agreement.

For Saint Paul says, that the passions of this time, are not worthy the
glory to come, which shall be revealed in us. Farther, merit has joined unto
it debt: which thing Paul testifies when he says, that to him which works,
reward is rendered according unto debt, and is not imputed according to grace.
Which self same Paul writes expressly, that the grace of God is eternal
life. Lastly, unto the nature of merit, there is required, that that which is
given pertains to the giver, and be not due unto him which receives it, but
works are not of our selves, for they are called the gift of God, which he
works in us. Wherefore Augustine very wisely says, that God does crown
his gifts in us. Now if our works be due unto him (which we cannot deny)
then undoubtedly the nature of merit is utterly taken away, etc. Pet. Mart.
upon the Romans fol. 39.

Saint Austen says, Let merits of men here hold their peace, which have
perished by Adam, and let the grace of God reign by Jesus Christ. Again, The
Saints give nothing to their own merits: they will give all to none but to thy
mercy O God. In another place, When man sees that whatsoever good he has, he
has it not of himself, but from his God, he seeeth that all that is praised
in him, is not of his own merits, but of the mercy of God. You see how
taking from men y^ power of doing well, he also throws down the dignity of
merit. And Chrysostom says, Our works, if there be any, which follow the
free calling of God, are repaiment and debt: but the gifts of God, and grace,
and bountifulness, and the greatness of liberal giving. But leaving the
name, let us look upon the thing. I have verily before alleged a sentence
out of Barnard, as it suffices to merit, not to presume to merit: so to want
merits suffices to judgment, but by adding forthwith an exposition, he
sufficiently mitigateth the hardness of y^ word, where he says: Therefore
care thou to have merits: when thou have them, know that they are given: hope
for fruit, the mercy of God: and so thou have escaped all danger of poverty,
unthankfulness, and presumption. Happy is the Church, which neither wants
merits without presumption, nor presumption without merits. And a little
before he had largely showed, how godly a meaning he used. For of merits
(says he) why should the Church be careful, which has a stedfaster and a
surer cause to glory of the purpose of God: God cannot deny himself, he will
do that which he has promised. If there be no cause why should ask by
what means may we hope for, good things? Eze. 36. 3^.
Specially, when thou hear said: Not for your sakes, but for my sake, it
suffices to merit, to know that merits suffice not. Calvin in his Inst. 3.
b. cha. 15. sect. 2.

S. Barnard Barnard
says, Non est qua gratia intret, etc. Where merit has taken up the room,
there is no place for grace to enter. Bar. super. Canti. Ser. 17.

Saint Augustine Augustine
says: Hoc est electio gratia. etc. This is the election of grace, because
(...) good merits of man^^ are prevented. For if it were given by any good
merits, then were it not given free, but rendered as ought. And by this means,
it is not by a true name called grace, where reward is. As the saine Apostle
says, it is not imputed according to grace, but according to duty. But if
that it be true grace, y^ is to say, freely given, it finds naught in man to
whom it may be worthily owing. August. lib. de patientia. cap. 2.

Of two kinds of meriting.
There be two kinds of meriting, that is to say, of good and evil. The good
kind of meriting, is by Christ, through Christ, for Christ and in Christ. That
is, by casting all our care on him only, having him continually beaten and
crucified before our eyes, and crucifieng our selves unto the world, having no
trust in our selves, nor in any work that we can do, or any other for us,
setting up any in heaven, earth, or hell, to be equal or partner with him: but
believing and confessing him to be all in all things. The only Creator and
maker, the only free giver of all goodness, and the only peace maker
between God and us. The other kind of meriting is by Satan, the world and the
flesh, contrary in all points to this: that is to say, taking all cares upon
our selves, seeking ways to crucify and offer up Christ again, refusing to
crucify our selves, having all trust in our own works and other creatures
merits, making the dead Saints obteiners of merits, through their prayers and
merits, yea, making them mediators and peace makers between God and us. Rob.
Crowley.

MESECH AND KEDAR.
What manner of people these were.
MEsech and Kedar were two sorts of people inhabiting near unto the Jews:
Psalm. ^^0. ^
of which y^ first came of I^pheth as Moses teaches, and the second of Ismael.
Both of them were barbarous, cruel, and without all humanity, dwelling in
tents. To these cruel people, David compares the Israelites, which were no
less cruel and spiteful against Gods people then they. Luther upon the Psalm.
fol. 18.

These were people of Arabia, Mesych
which came of Iapheth. Genesis 10. 2. Geneua.

MESSENGER.
The meaning of these places following.
WHo is so blind as my messengers. Esa. 42. 19
By messengers he means the high Priests, and those that had cure of the
people. Those should have taught the other, but they were blindest of all, as
Christ declares in the Gospel. Such there be at all times, and shall be unto
the worlds end. T. M.

By the servant, messenger and the perfect man, he means the Jews and their
Priests, who ought of all other people to have had knowledge, and so have
served God perfectly. The Bible note.

What the messenger of Satan means.
The messenger of Satan to buffet me. 2. Cor. 12. 7
The messenger of Satan, which he calls the unquietness of the flesh, Paul
does understand the enemies of the truth, false Prophets and persecuters of
Gods word, with all kind of adversities and troubles, wherewith the flesh is
disquieted and vexed. And those things did (by the divine providence of God)
happen unto Saint Paul, least he should be puffed up above measure, because of
his reuealations. Ambrosius. Erasmus.

Look. Flesh.

MESSIAH.
How the word Christ in Hebrew is called Messiah.
THat is called Christ. Mat. 1. 16
In Hebrew Messiah. It signifies anointed. Jesus Christ then is the earnest
and pledge of Gods promise, by whom the grace and favor of God is promised to
us, with the Holy ghost, which illumineth, lights and renueth our hearts, to
fulfill the same. Tindale.

We have found Messiah. That which is in the Hebrew text Messiah, is in the
Greek Christos, and in the Latin text Vnctus: which three words have all one
sense. But these words, We have found Messiah, seems to be spoken with great
Emphasis or force, and do note that Simon also (to whom Andrew told the
news) burned meruailously in desire toward Christ, for his words are thus much
in effect: rejoice brother, for him whom both of us have sought so carefully,
we have found, even the Savior Christ. He spoke not doubtfully, as did the
woman of Samaria, which said, Is not he Christ? But as one fully certified,
Andrew says, we have found Messiah. Marl. upon John fol. 36.

MEASVRE.
Of the spirit of God given by measure.
FOr God gives not the spirit by measure. ^ohn. 3. 34
Some extend this place to the common dispensation, because God, which is the
bottomless well of all goodness, does nothing at all empty himself, when
largly and plentifully, he powers his gifts upon men. They which power water
out of any vessel, or draw a Well, come at the length to the bottom of the
same: but we need not fear to doubt of the like to be in God. For the more
his gifts are bestowed upon us, the more plentiful they abound. This
exposition seems to have some color, because the sentence is somewhat
intricate and obscure. Notwithstanding, their opinion seems more probable
which interpret this to be spoken concerning Christ: and so the sense and
meaning is, that the spirit is not given by measure to Christ, as though the
grace in him were to be measured: even as as the Apostle Paul teaches, Ephesians.
4. 7
that to every one is distributed according to the measure of the gift, 1. Cor.
12. 7
so that no one man abounds at the full. And verily, the spirit must rest upon
Christ without measure, John. 1. 16
to the end we might all receive of the fullness of the same, etc. Marl. upon
John fol. 97.

MEAT.
What the meat is that Christ said he had to eat.
I Have meat to eat that ye know not of. John. 4. 32
His meat is to do the will of his father, and the chief thing of his
fathers will is, to preach the Gospel to all the world, which thing was even
now at hand to be done, as when the corn is ripe, men must fall to harvest.
Tindale.

How we ought not to hurt our weak brother with our meat.
Cause not your treasure to be evil spoken of. Romans 14. 16
We cause our treasure, that is to say y^ Gospel to be evil spoken of, when
we without any respect of the weak. (S. Paul calls them weak, which be
nothing strong in the faith, and for lack of instruction, yet make conscience
of this meat or that meat) do eat indifferently all kind of meats, giving
therein to these weak persons an occasion to think and to say, that we seek
nothing else in ye Gospel, but y^ pampring up of our bellies. S. I. Chapter

Which is the benefit of Christ's liberty, by abusing whereof, ye cause y^
weaklings to blaspheme the Gospel, which might seem to them contrary to Gods
will, and the doctrine of the Law. Geneua.

How meat defiles not a man.
There is nothing without a man that can defile him. Mar. 7. 15
Meat defiles not, if it be taken and received with faith. And if any man
make this Objection saying: Does not meat and drink defile them that surfeit
and are dronken? Answer, that surfeiting and drunkenness ought not to be
imputed to the meat, but to the inordinate lust of the heart. S. I. Cheek.

There is no outward or corporal thing which enters into man, that can
defile him, meaning chiefly of meats, which if they be taken excessiuely, it
comes of the inordinate lust of the heart, and so the lust is evil. Geneua.

The meaning of this place following.
Come and eat of my meat, Pro. 9. 5
and drink of y^ wine that I have drawn. By the meat and drink is meant the
word of God, and the ministration of the Sacraments, whereby God nourishes his
servant in his house, which is the Church. Geneua.

MICHAEL.
The meaning of this place following.
MIchael the Archangell, Iud. vev. ^
when he strove against the devil, and disputed about the body of Moses, etc.
Of Moses it is writtten the last of Deuteronomy. That he died in the land of Moab, and
was buried, and that no man did know his sepulcher unto this day. The sepulcher
of Moses, God would have it unknown, least the Jews which counted Moses for
such a great and holy prophet should commit Idolatry, and set up Idolatry upon
y^ sepulcher of Moses, and worship Moses as God, for y^ Jews were ready to
Idolatry. Of this does y^ contention appear to be sprung between Michael and
the devil, of the which contention Judas here speaks of. The devil would y^
body of Moses to have been showed to the Jews, that it might have been unto them
an occasion of Idolatry. Michael would it should not have been showed unto
them, that they should have had by it none occasion of Idolatry, but that all
Idolatry should be utterly extincted and put away. Here you may learn the
desire of the Devil, which is to move to Idolatry, to iniquity and sin.
Good men then always do dissuade from Idolatry and sin^ and takes away all
occasion, by y^ which passage may be made to Idolatry and sin. S. John. Apo.
12. does speak of a certain battle between Michael and the devil. He
says there was made a great battle in heaven, Michael the Archangel and his
Angels, did fight with a Dragon, and the Dragon and his Angels did fight with
Michael, but they have not prevailed, nor yet no place of them was found any
more in Heaven. But the battle of which it is here spoken, was of the body
of Moses, which the Devil would have had worshipped, that the Jews might
have committed Idolatry on it, Michael did resist him. This is the meaning of
this place (says the Author) after my opinion, if it be the true meaning of
Jude, take it: if not, take their minds, that can bring a better sense, and I
my self will be glad to learn, of better learned then I am, (for I am of the
least) the true understanding of this place. Accept mine opinion in good worth,
till thou hear a better. Biblian. upon Jude.

It is most like that this example was written in some of those books of the
scripture, which are now lost. Nu. 21. 14. Io. 10. 13.

Who be Michaels Angels.
Michael and his Angels fought with the Dragon. Apoc. 12. 7
Michael (who in the Prophet is called a great Prince, and is said to stand in
Gods people side. Dan. 10. 21.) represents unto us Christ, whose Angels be
both those holy seruiable spirits, and also (among men) the godly Princes and
Magistrates together with the Ministers of Gods word, which serve Christ in
vanquishing the huge powers of Antichrists host. Marl. upon John in the Apoc.
fol. 174.

MICHOL.
Diverse doubtful places of this woman made open and plain.
MIchol being David's wife, was afterward given by Saul her father to one
Psaltiel y^ son of Lais, ^. Reg. 25 44
which Psaltiel being a good man, and a Doctor of Law, did not yet vs^ her,
for he knew her to be the very wife of David, and that he had not forsaken
her: for the which cause David after ward received her again, which he would
not have done, if she had been known of Psaltiel, even as he went no more into
his wives which Absosolom knew. Lyra.

And whereas it is said that Michol had five sons by Adriel, 2. Reg. 21. 8
it is to be understood that they were the sons of Merob her sister, which
was the wife of Adriel, for Michol had no natural child borne of her, nor was
the wife of Adriel. But because Michol did nourish and bring up the children of
Merob, (she being dead) even as they had been her own natural children,
therefore were they called the sons of Michol, which were not her natural
sons, but her sons by adoption. Ly.

And the sons of Michol, the daughter of Saul, 2. Re. 21. 8
whom she bare to Adriel. Here Michol is named for Merob Adriels wife, as
appears. 1. Reg. 18. 19. For Michol was y^ wife of Psaltil 1. Reg. 25. 44.
and never had child. 2. Reg. 6. 32. Geneua.

And where it is said how Psaltiel went after Michol his wife weeping, 2. Reg.
3. 15
what time as she was restored again to David: It was thought that he wept for
joy, that she was reduced to her own husband again, and that he had not
touched her, but kept her as his own sister, for he being a doctor in the
law, knew that it was not lawful for him to touch her carnally, David being
alive. Lyra.

MICHTAM.
What this word Michtam signifies.
Michtam of David. Psalm. 16.
That is, nobility, or honor of chivalry, or an instrument of Music. T. M.

MY DAY.
The meaning of this place following.
ABraham was glad to see my day, John. 8. 56.
and he saw it and reioysed. To see my day, which was to see the coming of
Christ in the flesh, which thing Abraham saw far off, with the eyes of
faith. Geneua.

All the holy Fathers that were before the coming, from the beginning of the
world, had the same faith of Christ that we have which be called Christians.
Tindale.

MY GOSPEL.
Wherefore Paul calls it his Gospel.
According to my Gospel. Romans 2. 16.
He calls it his Gospel, partly because he took much labor in preaching
it, and partly for the great affection that he had toward it: and for that he
was appointed to the publishing of it abroad. Pet. Mar. upon. the Romans fol. 44.

MILK.
What is meant by milk and strong meat.
SUch as need of Milk, Heb. 5. 1^.
and not of strong meat. By Milk are understood things easy to perceive. By
strong meat, such as are hard and obscure. Tindale.

That is called Milk, which agrees to beginners, and such as have little
experience. That is called strong meat, which is for old practitioners, and
such as have wisdom to judge between truth and falsehood. Deering.

MILLSTONE.
What is meant by this Millstone.
THat a Millstone were hanged, Man. 18. 6.
etc. He makes mention here of a great kind of punishment, which the
Palistines used (as Saint Hierome says) to punish notable offenses and wicked
acts. The Latin text for a Millstone has Mola asinaria, which signifies the
great stone that lies underneath in the Mill, the which stone in Greek is
called Asinus, an Ass, of the which comes Asinaria. S. Hillary says, that
it is called, Mola asinaria, or the Ass stone because the Ass did use to
turn the same about, at such times as any thing should be ground, according to
the manner of those Mils which we have in these days, in the which an horse
being blindfolded, turns the stone going still round. Marl. fo. 397.

What is meant by the taking of the Millstone to pledge.
NO man shall take the nether or the upper Millstone to pledge, Deuteronomy. 26. 6
for then he takes a man's life to pledge. Ey the nether or the upper Millstone
is signified any thing, which is necessary, required to a borrower or a
debtor, whereof he nourishes and susteyneth himself, that may no creditour
take from him, in especially his craft and occupation, whereon he chiefelye
lives, may he not by imprisonment, (which some most cruelly do) keep him
from. Least he be compelled to pay his debt with double disprofite, one, that
his millstone is idle in the mean time: another that he is constrained to come
further in debt, otherwise to sell his necessary goods, without which he
cannot live to make payment. T. M.

By the nether or upper millstone, is understood any thing whereby a man
gets his living. Geneua.

MINISTER.
What the Minister is by the word of God.
THE true Minister is the eye of the body. Mat. 6. 22.
The workman in the harvest. Math. 9. 38. The messenger that calls to the
marriage. Math. 22. 3. The Prophet that tells the will of the Lord. Math.
23. 34. The Scribes that does expound the law. The servant that occupies his
Masters talent unto gain. Math. 25. 16. The witness that bears testimony
of Christ to all people. Luke. 24. 48. The dispensers of the mysteries of God.
1. Cor. 4. 1. The Stewardes that gives meat in due season, unto the residue
of the householde. Math. 24. 45. The Sacrificer of the Gospel of GOD, to make
the oblation of his flock acceptable. Romans 15. 16. The Minister by whom the
people do believe. The laborers of God to till the husbandry. The Shepherd
to feed the Church of God, which he has purchased with his blood.

What men ought to be Ministers in the Church of God.
As in the old law it was forbidden that any man should prease to come to
the altar, and to offer the bread of God which had any manner blemish or
deformity in the body: So ought no man now to take upon him the preaching
of Gods holy word and ministration of the holy Sacraments, that is deformed
with vice, but innocent, pure, faultlesse, and vncorrupt, both in life and
doctrine. Theo. Basil.

The quality of Gods Minister.
They must be blameless, 1. Tim. 3. 1
watchful, sober, modest, herberous, wise, gentle, apt to teach, able to
convince the adversary, such as govern well their whole families, no
drunkards, no quarellers, no contentious men, these be y^ qualities that God
requires.

How ministers ought to be Preachers.
He is a dead Priest (says Gregory Greg. 24.
) and therefore no Priest, no more then a dead man is a man, Epist.
which does not preach: for he kindles the wrath of God the great judge
against him, if he walk without the sword of preaching.

Again he says: you Priests increase your own sins, with the death of
others, and you kill and murder so many, as you see daily without all care
(holding your peace) go to their death.

How Ministers ought first to be doers, and then teachers.
But whosoever does, Math. 5. 19
and teach the same, etc. This that is spoken here, pertains to the
ministers of the word. He teaches them therefore, what perfection is required
of them, namely, that they express and declare those things in their life,
which by their doctrine they declare and teach. 1. Cor. 9. 27
Saint Paul did chastise his body and brought it into subjection, least when
he preached to others, he himself should be a castaway. And writing to Timothy,
1. Tim. 4. 12
Be (says he) unto them ye believe an example in word, in conversation, in
love, in spirit, in faith, in pureness. And to Titus Tit. 2. 7.
(he says) in all things show thy self an example of good works, in the
doctrine, with honesty, with gravity, and with the wholesome word, which
cannot be rebuked, that he which withstandeth, may be ashamed, having no evil
to say on you. The like words has Saint Peter 1. Pe. 5. 19.
in effect. Marl. fol. 92.

Whosoever does, Mat. 5. 19.
etc. Christ makes mention first of the work, and then of the doctrine, for
if the works go before, though the doctrine do not follow, yet shall the
very work more suffice to teach them that look upon us, then any words shall
do.

First of all teach with works, and then with words: least the saying of Saint
Paul be objected: Romans 2. ^1.
Thou that teach another, teach not thy self.

The saying of Cato.
The things which in other thou art wont to blame, Cato.

Be well ware that thou offend not in the same.
For it is very shame, when a man will preach,
If that his deeds against his words do teach.
The saying of Menander.
The manners of the speaker are they that persuade, Menander
and not that which is spoken.

How the Ministers of the Church are called Stars.
The seven Stars are the Angels of the seven Churches. Apo. 12. 7.
The overseers of Churches are in Scriptures called Stars and Angels. Stars
in respect of the brightness, both of their heavenly doctrine, and of their
heavenly conversation. Angels because they report unto us the will of God the
Father. According also as in the same respect Christ is called the Angel of
the Testament, Mal. 3. 1. And John Baptist is called an Angel, Mal. 3. 1.
Math. 11. 10. So also in this place the rulers of the Churches are called
Angels, which thing appears chieflye heerby, that hereafter in y^ second
chapter and the first verse, they be willed to repent, which thing could in no
wise agree with the heavenly spirits. Therefore like as the Stars shine in the
Sky, so must the ministers of Gods word shine in y^ Church, and go before
other in pureness of doctrine and christen conversation. But a great part of
them (alas for sorrow) walk as enemies of Christ's cross, whose end is
damnation, whose God is their belly, and their glory is shame which seek
after earthly things, when as notwithstanding their conversation ought to be
heavenly. Phil. 3. 18. Marl. fol. 28.

How ministers were chosen in the old time.
Ministers in the old time were elect and chosen by the whole consent of the
people, as Cypriane Cipriane.
reports. The common people themselves have before all other, power either to
choose worthy Priests, or to refuse the unworthy. This order took his
beginning of Gods authority, for God said to Moses: Take thy brother Aaron and
Ehazarus his son, and set them on the mount before all the congregation, and
put off Aarons apparel, and put it upon Eleazarus his son, which declares
that ministers ought not to be admitted unto the ministry, but with the
consent and knowledge of the people. Theo. Basil.

In old time none was received into the company of clerks, without the
consent of all the people, insomuch that Cipriane labored earnestly to excuse
y^ he appointed one Aurelius to be a reader, without asking advise of y^
church, because y^ was done beside the custom, though not without reason. For
this he says before: In ordering of clarks dear brethren, we are wont to ask
your advise, and by common counsel to weigh y^ manners and deseruings of every
one. But because in these lesser exercises there was not much peril: because
they were chosen to a long proof, and not to a great office, therefore y^
consent of the people ceased to be asked. Afterward in the other degrees also,
except the Bishopric, the people commonly left y^ judgment and choice of them
to the Bishop and the Priests, that they should examine who were meet and
worthy, saving peradventure when new Phriests were appointed for the Parishes:
for then it behooved that the multitude of the place namely should consent.
Whether it is any marvel y^ the people in his behalf was little careful in
keeping their own right, for no man was made a subdecon that had not showed a
long proof of himself in his being a clarke under y^ severity of discipline,
which then was used. After y^ he had been tried in y^ degree, he was made a
Deacon. From thence he came to y^ honor of Priesthood, if he had behaved
himself faithfully. So no man was promoted, of whom there had not ben in deed
a trial had many years before y^ eyes of the people. And there were many Canons
to punish their faults. So y^ the Church could not be troubled with evil
Priests, or deacons, unless it neglected y^ remedies: howbeit in y^ Priests
also there was required y^ consent of them of ye same city: which ye very first
cano^ testifies in his. 67. distinction which is fathered upon Anacletus.
Finally al y^ admissio^s into y^ orders were therefore done at certain appointed
times of y^ year, y^ no man should privily creep in without the consent of
the faithful, or should with too much easiness be promoted without witnesses.

Wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest report, etc. If
the Church had kept still this order in choosing of Ministers, Act. 6. 3.
it had been better with the christen common wealth and religion. Lampridius a
notable histori^graph in the life of Al^xander Seuerus does write y^ this was
used customably among ye christians, when they should choose or make any
Minster, they did first publish his name abroad. And if any man could allege
any notable crime against him, he was expelled and put back from his office.
Sir. I. Cheek.

Why the Ministers are not now chosen as they were in the primitive Church.
The alteration of government and orders of the Church of Christ is well set
out by Ambrose, in the. 4. to the Ephesians. upon these words, Et ipse dedit, etc.
Where he says on this sort. That the number of the Christians might increase
and be multiplied, in the beginning it was permitted to every one to preach the
Gospel, to baptize, and to expound the Scriptures, but when the Church was
enlarged, there were certain preachers appointed, and governors, and other
officers ordained in the church, etc. Therefore the writings of the Apostles do
not in all things agree with the orders that are now in the church. D.
Whitegift.

Musculus also in his common places answering to this question, why that
Ministers of the word, are not chosen now by the Ministers and the people, as
they were in the Primitive Church, but appointed by the Magistrate, says thus:
Such was the state of the Churches, that they could choose their Ministers none
otherwise, because they had no christen magistrate. If thou would have the
manners and customs of these times, then must thou call back their condition
and state.

How Ministers ought not to forsake their vocation.
Ministers must abide in their vocation, so long as y^ strength of the body
will suffer them, and that they be not thrust out by force. For y^ men and
people committed to their charge, ought never to be forsaken, so long as they
can abide to hear ye word of God. And if they be altogethers conte^ners of y^
word of y^ Lord, and will not suffer it to be preached, then as Christ
commanded his Apostles, let them shake of the dust of their feet against
them, and depart. But so long as there are any among them, which will suffer
ye pastor to preach, and to entreat of ye word of God, he ought not to give
over his ministratio^. Wherefore I know not whether Melitius did well or no, or
whom Theodoretus makes mention in his. 2. book. 31. chap. y^ he forsook the
Bishopric of a certain church in Armenia, being offended with ye over great
disobedience of his flock. But ye same man afterward being chose^ Bishop of
Antioch, was for ye defe^ding y^ catholic faith against ye Arria^s thrust into
exile. In which fact, God peradventure declared that he was not well pleased,
that he had departed from his first vocation. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fo. 334.

How a Scisme ought not to be made for the evil life of the Minister.
The Scribes and Pharesies sit in Moses, Mat. 23. 2.
etc. All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do, but
after their works do not, for they say and do not, etc. Behold y^ Lord says,
they say and do not: therefore the teachers lives were not agreeable to their
doctrine: yet for that they stood in Moses seat, that is to say, because they
taught the word of God lawfullye, and sincerely, he bids to receive their
sincere doctrine, but their life not being agreeable to their doctrine, that he
bids to refuse: And therefore to make a scisme for the Preachers evil lives
sake, the Lord does forbid. Bullinger. fo. 846.

MIRACLES.
A definition of true Miracles.
A Miracle is a work, hard and uncustomed by the power of God, which passes
all faculty of nature created, to this end wrought, to cause the beholders to
wonder and to confirm faith toward the word of God. Wherefore the matter of
miracles are works, and the form is, that they be hard and unaccustomed. The
efficient cause is the power of God, which overcomes nature created, and the
end of them is both admiration and also confirmation of faith. Pet. Mar. upon
Iudic. fol. 126.

To what use Miracles do serve.
Miracles serve for three uses. First, that he which is healed thereby should
sin no more^ Secondlye, that the beholders should put their trust in the
healer. Thirdly, that we which read of the miracles of the Lord, should be
confirmed in the glory and doctrine of Christ, and therewithal conceive faith
in him. Hemmy^g.

Brethren, Grego. in Euan. ^o. Homil. 29
be not in love with signs, which may be had common with the reprobate, but
love ye rather miracles of charity and true godliness, which the more secret,
the more secure, and for the which the less estimation that there is with men,
the greater is the reward with God. In the beginning and gathering of y^ Church
many things were necessary which now is needless. Similitude
Miracles were used then, which outwardly be divided now. When we go about to
pla^t a tree, so long we water it, until we see it have taken root. But when
it is once substantially grounded, and branches spread abroad, we take no more
pain to water it: on like sort, as long as y^ people were altogether
faithless, this mean of miracles was of indulgence granted them. But when
spiritual instruction had taken better place, the corporal signs surceased
straight. Wherefore the Apostle says: Lingua in signum sunt, non fidelibus sed
infidelibus. Strange tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to
them that believe not. And plainly to argue that a thing is good, because a
miracle is showed by it, or else to approve a present use, by that which
needfully sometime was done, has too many absurdities and inconveniences to
be yielded to. D. Calfehill.

Whether we should believe miracles.
If only the word of God is to be believed, why said Christ, that if they
would not believe him, they should yet at the least believe his works. To this
we answer, that miracles are as testimonies, by which men are the easilier
brought to believe, so that they are things, by means whereof men believe, not
that faith is directed unto them, as unto his object: although as touching the
miracles of Christ and of the Apostles, we must believe y^ they were done by
God, and not by Belzabub or by the devil, as the Pharesies slanderously
reported: and this is contained in the word of God, for it gives testimony y^
these miracles should be wrought, and that they were wrought in their due time,
namely in the preaching of the second doctrine, etc. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans
fol. 326.

In old time, Chriso. in Mat. homil. 49.
it was known by miracles, who were the true Christians, and who the false:
but now the working of miracles is taken quite away, and rather found among
them that be false Christians.

Why miracles be not done now a days.
To these that demand this question: why is not miracles done now a days by
the ministers of Gods word Answer. Because that the glory of Christ and
truth of Gods word, was confirmed by miracles long ago, which being done they
have discharged their duty. Hemmyng.

Pope Leo makes them answer thus: Leo in ser. de passio Domini.
ye foolish Scribes and wicked Priests, the power of our savior was not to be
showed, at the discretion of your blindness, God shows his miracles, when
and where, and to whom he will.

Whosoever requires miracles to bring him to the faith, Augu. de con. dei. li.
22. ca. 8
is himself a great miracle, that the world believing, remains still in
unbelief.

How Miracles are wrought by the devil.
In the end of time power shall be given to the devil, Chriso. in Mat. homil. 49.
to work profitable signs and miracles: so that then we cannot know the
mysteries of Christ, by that they work profitable miracles, but by that they
work no miracles.

Let no man say (says S. Austen) therefore it is true for that this man or that
man has wrought this or that miracle: Augu. de vnita. Ecclae. cap. 16
or for that men make their prayers at the tombs of the dead, and obtain their
desire: or for that these or these miracles be wrought there, etc. Away with
these things: they may be either the iuglings and mockeries of deceitful men,
or else illusions of lieng spirits.

S. Austen says, August. in John. Tra. 13.
Contra istos, etc. My God has warned me to beware of those mongers of
miracles, saying: In the last day shall rise up false Prophets working signs
and wonders, to the end of it be possible, to bring the elect to error, behold
I have forewarned you, therefore the bridegroom has willed us to beware, for we
may not be deceived, no not by miracles.

Alexander of Halys says, Alex. de Hal. 4. quest.
In the sacrament it self, there appears flesh, sometimes by the conueiance
of men, and sometimes by the working of the devil.

Nicholas de Lyra says, Lyra in Dan. ca. 14
sometime in the Church, the people is shamefullye deceived with feined
miracles, wrought either by the Priests, or else by their companions for lucre
sake.

S. Austen says to Faustus the Maniche, Aug. eon. Fau li. 13.
ye work no miracles, and yet if ye wrought any, at your hands we would take
heed of them.

The Prophet Jeremy says, (...). 23. 32
They have deceived my people, by their lies, and by their false miracles.

These wonders which they call miracles, Bilney.
be wrought daily in the Church, not by the power of God, as many one think,
but by the illusion of Satan rather, who (as the Scripture witnesses) has
been loose now abroad. 500. years, according as it is written in the book of
the Apocalips: after a thousand years Satan shall be loose, etc. Neither are
they to be called miracles of true christian men, but illusions rather, whereby
to delude men's minds, to make them put their trust in our Lady, and in other
Saints, and not in God alone, to whom be honor and glory for ever. Bilney in
the bo. of Mar. fol. 1140.

Vulgus hominu^, etc. The common people (says he) esteems Saints by
miracles, Friar Ferus.
and counts him the greater, that has done m^ miracles, but they err
manifestly that so judge: Miracles are indeed (to use S. Paul's words) the
operation of great works, the gift of the holy Ghost. But heereon, they are not
only esteemed Saints, else the blessed virgin and John Baptist were of all
Saints y^ least, that are dead to have wrought no miracles. We may not
therefore esteem Saints heerevpon. Moreover, oftentimes miracles are given to
the evil, for many shall say in y^ day, Lord, Lord, have we not cast out
devils in thy name, and I shall say unto them, I have not known you.

Why Christ did not many miracles in his own country.
And he did not many miracles there^ Mat. 13. 58.
etc. Christ might have wrought miracles, yea, though they believed not, but he
did not work many, and y^ for their own profit. Least if he had done there as
he did in other places, their condemnation should have been greater. Sir. I.
Cheek.

How to know true miracles from false.
Even as we take those Sacraments for true Sacraments and ceremonies, which
preach unto us Gods word: so do we account these for true miracles only, which
move us to harken unto y^ word of God. Other rule the^ this to discern the^
by, there is not: namely, y^ the true are done to provoke me^ to come and harke^
unto Gods word: and y^ false to confirm doctrine y^ is not gods word.

How faith grounded upon miracles abides not.
What a multitude came out of Aegipt under Moses, of which the Scripture
testifies y^ they believed, moved by y^ miracles of Moses. Nevertheless y^
scripture testifies, y^. vi. hundred thousand of those believers perished
through unbelief, and left their carcasses in ye wilderness, and never entered
into y^ land y^ was promised them.

Judas believed because of Christ his miracles. Simon Magus believed, through
occasion of Philips preaching, but Peter said that his heart was not a^ight
with God. Act. 8.

How false teachers shall deceive by nothing more then by miracles.
Christ says, Mat. 24. ^4.
there shall arise false anointed, and false Prophets, and shall show great
miracles. Also in the same chapter, (verse. 5.) Many shall come in my name,
etc. by the which words it appears: that they must be in the church of
Christ, and of them that shall call themselves Christians.

What the cause of false miracles is.
The cause of false miracles is, for that they love not the truth: and therefore
God has promised by S. Paul to send them abundance of false miracles to
stablish them in lies, and to deceive them and lead them out of the way, so
that they cannot but perish for their unkindness, that they loved not ye
truth, to live thereafter, and to honor God in their members.

How miracles are done in these days.
The Church of Christ is a little flock, which the devil the king of darkness
and Antichrist the people do persecute, and bend all their force against it.
And yet Gods so miraculously defends the same, that all they (without Gods
permission) cannot touch the least number thereof. This presence of God in his
Church, is miraculous enough, so that we need not to seek any other miracles.
Hemmyng.

MIRRHE ALOES AND CASSIA.
A brief declaration of these three words.
MIrrhe is a little shrubby tree growing in the hot country called Arabia
foelix, the fruitful Araby, or the wealthy and plentiful Araby: so called in
respect of the other that is but barren. This Mirrhe tree is low and full of
pricks, as our thorns and briers be. The ^auour and smell of the wood, is
singularly pleasant: so likewise is the juice or the Gum thereof called
Guttaa distillando, like as of the Greeks i^ is called Stacte. In steed of
this word Gutta or State, some Interpreters do translate Aloes. Aloes is a
shrub^e growinge in Arabia also, whereof there be two kinds, the one clean
contrary to the other: for the one has a very stinking savor, and is of a
marvelous bitter taste. And of that kind of Aloes speaks Iuuinal, or rather
the prouerbiall sentence used by Iuuinal: Plus Aloes quam melles habet, It is a
thing that has more bitterness then sweetness in it. As if a man would say,
to bear office seems to be a pleasant thing, but if the displeasure and
danger thereof be well considered, Plus Aloes quam mellis habet. There is
another kind of Alos of most pleasant and sweet savor, of which mention is
made in y^. 7. chapter of y^ Proverbs: Solomon counterfaiting the pleasant
speech of an harlot, alluring young men unto her sensual purpose, says in her
person on this wise: I have made me a gorgeous chamber, Et cubile meum odoratum
reddidi mirrha, Aloe and Cynamome: And I have made my bed exceeding sweet (not
with damask water) but with Mirrhe, Aloes, and Cynamome. Of Mirrhe and Aloes
Nichodemus that came to Christ in the night seson, made a fine and costly
mixture, therewith to anoint the dead body of Christ, lieng in the sepulcher.

Cassia is of like oderiferous a pleasant savor, y^ Mirrhe, and Aloes be,
which three being joined togethers, must needs make a sweet smell, as it is
spoken of the Prophet by Solomon, Mirrham, Guttam sieve stactem, sieve Aloen and
Cassiam, redolent omnia vestementa tua, All thy garments do smell of mirrhe,
aloes, and Cassia, that is to say, thy garments are exceeding pleasant and
sweet. Ri. Turn.

MYSTERY.
What a Mystery is^
A Mystery is a thing secret or hid in words or ceremonies, or a ceremony
wherein some secret thing is understoode. Eliote.

Christ is crucified every bay in a mystery, that is to say, every day his
death is represented by his Sacraments of remembrance. The bread is Christ's
body in a mystery, that is to say, it represents his body that was broken
for us, and keeps it in our remembrance. The Communion is Christ's pason in a
mystery, that is to say, it represents his person, and keeps it in our
memory. I. F^rith.

MOLOCH.
What manner of Idol this Moloch was.
THat gives of his seed to Moloch, Leuit. (...). 2.
etc. Under the name of Moloch is forbidden all manner of Idolatry, specially
the exercising children thereto for that is abominable before the Lord. Moloch
was an Idol of the children of Ammon, whose Image was hollow, having in it
seven closets, one was to offer therein Fine flower, an other for Turtle
doves, the third for a sheep, the fourth for a Ram, the ^ift for a Calfe, the
sixth for an Ox. And for him that would offer his son, was opened the seventh
closet. And y^ face of y^ Idol was like ye face of a Calfe, his hands made
plain, ready to receive of the^ that stood by. T. M.

Moloch was a certain Idol of copper, proportioned like vnot a man, which
Image was made holow within. And when the people would offer their children in
sacrifice to this Idol, a fire should be made within the holow place of ye
Image, until it were red hot, and when the child should be put into the Idols
hands, the Priests would make such a noise with drumslades, Timbrells and
Tabrets, that the parents should not hear the voice of the child, but
believe tha ye Gods received y^ soul of y^ child, and that it died quietly
and without pain, Lyra.

MONEY.
How Christ had Money.
SHall we go and buy. 200. pennyworth of bread, etc. We learn here that
Christ had money, else the Apostles would not have said, Let us go and buy. 200
pennyworth of bread. Then it is lawful for Preachers to have money with them,
wherewith to buy meat and drink and clothing, with other necessaries. Sir. I.
Cheek.

MONTHS.
The. 42. Months in the Apocalips expounded.
ANd power was given him to do. 42. months. As there is no doubt, but by the
^east with. 7. heads, bearing the whore of Babylon, dronken with ye blood of
Saints, is signified y^ city of Rome. So in my judgment y^ power of making.
42. months (in y^. 13. of ye Apocalips) is to be expounded, taking every month
for a sabbath of years, y^ is, reckoning for. 7. years a month, so y^ forty
and two such sabboths of years being gathered together, make up y^ years just
between the years of Christ's death, to the last year of the persecution of
Maxentius, when Constan^inus fighting under y^ banners of Christ, overcame him,
and made an end of al persecution within y^ Monarchy of Rome. The number of
which years by plain computation come to ^ 294. to the which ^294. years, if
we ado ye other 6. years, under ye persecution of Licinius in Asia, then it
fills up full the number of. 300. years. And so long continued the
persecution of Christ's people under the heathen tyrants and Emperors of the
Monarchy of Rome, according to the number of 42. mon^thes, which the beast had
power to make, specified in the. 13. of the Apocalips. In the book of Mar.
^ol. 139.

MONETARIVS.
Of this man sprang up the sect of the Anabaptists.
Look. Anabaptists.

MONTANVS.
The first that wrote laws of ^asting.
MOntanus whereof the Montanists are called, taught in Phrigia, hereof it is
that the heresy is called Phrigian. Epiphan. says, it began about the. 19.
year of Antonius Pius, which succeeded Adrian. This Montanus was taken in
Phrigia for the holy Ghost, Priscilla and Maximilla for Prophitesses. He forbad
marriage, and commanded abstinen^e from certain meats as unlawful. In the
end, Montanus and Maximilla, hanged themselves. Eus. 1. 5. cap. 13^ 14. 15. 16.
17. The Montanists otherwise called Cataphrigians, pricked a boy with bodkins,
drew the blood out of his body, soked therein the bread, and made a Sacrament
thereof. If the boy died, he was counted a marti^, if otherwise a great Priest.
Epiph. h^raes. 48. August. li. de. heraes.

Eus^bius in his. 5. book and. 18. chapter, writes that one Appolonius
reproved Montanus, because he was the first that wrote laws of fasting, as
though the Church before him was free. He by laws and prescripts prescribed
what days men should fast, and what meat they should abstain from. Pet. Mar.
upon Iudic. fol. 278.

MONKS.
Of the life of Monks in S. Hieromes time.
S. Hierome Hierom a^ Marc(...) vt Com.
describing the life and order of Monks in his time, says thus: They brag not
of their sole and single life. All contention is who may be most humble
Whosoever is la^^, is counted first, There is neither difference nor wondering
in apparel howsoever it pleases a man to go, he is neither slaundered for
it, nor commended, no man is advanced for his fasting, neither his abstinence
praised, nor sober refection condemned.

Each man either stands or falls unto his Lord. No man judges other, least
of the Lord he himself be judged.

Of the Monks that be now.
If the name of Monks (that is to say, Solitari) be not sufficient to declare
that those which at this day be named Monks, be nothing less then that they be
called, there be other reasons sufficient to convince them. For the ancient
Monestaries, were as Colleges, into the which men resorted, for two causes.
First, the better to be at quiet to study Scriptures. The second to exercise
patience and austeritie of life. Notwithstanding, it was not to be strained and
bound to one place during life without exception, but contrariwise to be the
more meet to serve the churches when they should be called and elected
thereunto, as it appears by Gregory Nazienzene, Basile, and Chrisottome,
namely, in S. Augustines time. To be idle and not to work with the hands was
intolerable: for on the contrary, they lived only by the labor of their own
hands, yea, and they did give the rest of their labor unto the poor. So that
a Monk not travailing for his living, was esteemed as a thee^e, according to
the rule of S. Paul. And to put salvation partly or altogether in their
abstinence, how extreme or hard so ever they were, they never thought it. For
they knew very well what S. Paul had written of that point. Moreover S. Austen
testifies and says. Let none be oppressed above his power, least there be
superstition in the abstinence of meats, for the weak refusing foolishly the
use of wine, were admonished brotherly, that by their superstition they brought
themselves rather more weak then holy, it appears moreover by that which S.
Cipriane said, y^ it were better for the virgins, which were dedicate by promise
unto God (y^ is to wit, to the service of the poor, and not to be idle in
couents) if they would not or could not continue, y^ they should marry rather
then fall into the fire and burn by their delights, as also Paul has
ordained. If this be heresy, then Saint Cipriane must be an heretic. Theo.
Beza. Apud hos, Hierome ad Eusto.
etc. Among these me^ (meaning Monks) al things are counterfeit, their wide
sleeves: their great boots: their course gowns: their often sighs: their
visiting of Uirginnes: their backbiting of Priests, and if there come an holy
day, they ease until they be feign to perbrake.

S. Austen says unto the old heretics called the Maniches: Augu. de moribus
Manich^. li. 2. ca 19 and 20.
Ye say, we may not examine what men they be that profess your sect, but
only what is their profession: what thing can there be found more false, more
deceiptfull, more malicious then yeu are^

The old Fathers opinions of Monks Gods service.
These Monks (satih S. Austen) serve not God, Augustine
they serve their bellies. August. de opera Monacho. cap. 12. Augu. de oper.
Monic. ca. 22.


Again, We cannot tell (says he) whether they became Monks of purpose to
serve God, or else being wearye of their poor painful life, were rather
desirous to be fed and clothed, doing nothing.

Under the color of holiness (says S. Hilary) they seek for dainty fare,
In Psalmum. 5^.
they maintain their storehouses, by the unprofitable service of religious
people, of whom it is written: They devour up widows houses, although they
think to serve God, yet the same answer shall be made them that is written
in the Gospel, We know that God gives no ear to sinner^.

They are loath to be abiects and in ser^ile state. Hiero. ad Eustochi.
For idleness they will not labor: and to beg they are ashamed, for being
valiant and lusty people, no man would give them any thing.

Of the idleness of Monks.
They speak much of their idleness, Augu de oper. Monic. ca. 22.
as if it were the keeper and Castle of the Gospel. Again, in the same chapter
he says: the same thing happens unto them that S. Paul speaks of young
widows, living out of order, they learn to be idle, and not only idle, but
also curious and full of words, speaking such things, as are not meet.

Saint Austen says: Unto the servant of God, Augu. ad fratre. in cre. ser. 1.
there is nothing worse then idleness, let them therefore work in the name of
God.

These Monks (says S. Austen) will have idle hands and full bellies. Augustine
Aug. de opere Monicho. cap. 23.

A learned Father was wont to say by the report of Soc^ates: A Monk that
labors not with his hands, may be re, sembled unto a thief.

They (meaning Monks) says S. Barnard, Barnar. in Psa 72.
must needs be in travails with Devils, that are not in the travails of men.

Such a number of Hipocrites (says S. Austen) has the Devil scatter^d abroad
every where, Augustine
under the color of Monks. Aug. de opere Monicho. cap. 28.

Of the original of Monks.
S. Hierom Hierome
disputing of the original of Monks in the Iyfe of Paul^s, has thus written:
Among many it has oftentimes been called into question, who first began
chiefly to dwell in the wilderness of the Monks: some fetching the matter somewhat
too far off, began to reckon from Helias the holy prophet, and S. John: of whom
Helias seems to us to have been more then a Monk: and that S. John began to
prophecy before he was born. But others (in which opinion the most part of all
people do^ commonly, agree) affirm that S. Antonie was the first beginner of
that order, which in part is true. For the was not only the first, but also
the motioner of all others thereunto. Amathas and Macarius, S. Antonies
scholars, whereof the first buried his masters body, do now affirm that one
Paulus Thebius, was the first beginner of that way, which thing we also
confirm, not only in name, but also in opinion. Bull. fol. 1135.

The form of a Monkish absolution.
God forgive thee my brother, the merit of the passion of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and of blessed S. Mary always a Uirgin, and of all the Saints: the
merits of thine Order, the straightness of thy religion, the humility of thy
confession, the contrition of thine heart, the good works which thou have
done, and shall do for the love of our Lord Jesus Christ, be unto thee
auailable for the remission of thy sins, the increase of desert and grace,
and the reward of everlasting life, Amen. Ye hear the merit of Christ
mentioned in these words: but if ye weigh them well, ye shall perceive that
Christ is there altogether unprofitable, and that the glory and name of a
iustifier and Savior, is quite taken from him, and given to Monkish merits.
Is not this to take the name of God in vain? Is not this to confess Christ in
words, and in very deed to deny his power, and blaspheme his name, etc.
Luther upon the Gal. fol. 72.

Of the profit that is of the Moon.
HE appointed the Moon for certain seasons. Ca. up the Psa. 104. 19
The Interpreters agree that this ought to be understood of the ordinary and
appointed ^easts. For inasmuch as the Hebrews are wont to reckon their months
by the Moon, they use her as the directer of their festival days, and as
well ^or their holy assemblies, as for their meetings about politic affairs.
Notwithstanding I doubt not but that there is the figure Synechdoche, as if the
Prophet had said, that the Moon not only puts a difference between the
nights and the days: but also boundeth the years and months, and consequently
serves to many purposes, because the distinction of times is fetched out of
her course.

MORNING AND EVENING.
How this place of Job is understood.
FRom Morning to Evening they be destroyed. Some expound this, as though it
were meant, that men perish in small time, and that is very true. But
heerewithall there is yet more: that is to wit, that we pass not a minute of
our life, but it is as it were approaching unto death. If we consider it well,
when a man rises in the morning, he is sure that he shall not step forth one
pace: he is sure he shall not turn about his hand, but he shall still wax
elder and elder, and his life ever shorteneth. Then must we consider even by
eye sight, that our life fleeteth and slideth away from us. Thus we see what is
meant by consuming from morning to evening. Ca. upon. Job. fo. 75.

MORTIFICATION.
What true mortifieng is.
TO mortify is nothing else, but for a man to be violent against himself, and
to withstand and resist wicked lusts. Pe^. Mar. upon the To. fol. 203.

The flesh is mortified, when the custom of sin is abolished: and the spirit
is quickened when we begin to perform new obedience unto God.

Mortify therefore your members, etc. Col. 3. ^.
The true morti^ieng is, when the fear of God does fray us from sin, so that
our hearts trembles for fear of Gods judgment, when we are tempted or
entised unto sin. The heart being thus stricken with the fear of God
acknowledges his weakness, and calls unto God unfeignedly for help. This
mortifieng is the work of the Holy ghost. Romans 8. and works out wardly a
soberness of living and other godly exercises. Sir. I. Cheek.

Extinguish all the strength of the corrupt nature, which resists against the
spirit, that ye may live in the spirit, and not in the flesh. Geneua.

How we cannot mortify the flesh by our own free will.
If you mortify the deeds of the flesh by the spirit, Romans 8. 13
ye shall live. S. Austen upon this place: Thou will say (says he) that can my
will do, that can my free will do: What will, what manner of free will,
except he lift thee up, thou lie still: how can thou do it then by thy
spirit, seeing that the Apostle says, as many as be led by the spirit of God,
be the children of God: will thou do of thy self: Will thou be led of thine
own self, to mortify the deeds of the flesh? What will it profit thee, for
if thou be not voluptuous with the Epicures, thou shall be proud with the
Stoikes. Whether thou be an Epicure or a Stoike, thou shall not be among the
children of God, for they that be guided by the spirit of God, be the children
of God, not they that live after their own flesh, not they that live after
their own spirit, but as many as be led by the spirit of God. But here a man
will say, Ergo then are we ruled, and we do not rule. I auns were, thou both
rulest, and art ruled. But thou do then rule well, if thou be ruled by the
good spirit, utterly if thou do want the spirit of God, thou can do no
good. Thou do truly without his help by the free will, but it is but evil
done, unto that is thy will, which is called free will, and by evil doing is
she made a bondseruaunt. When I say, Without the help of God thou do nothing,
I understand by it, no good thing. For to do evil, thou have free will
without the help of God, though that be no freedom. Wherefore you shall know,
that so do you goodness, if the helping spirit be your guider: the which if
he be absent, can do no good at all. Augu^ de verbis Apost. ser. 13.

MOSES.
How Moses came by his impediment of speech.
OF Moses it is written, that the King of Egypt on a time for his daughters
sake took the child Moses in his arms, and set the crown upon his head:
which Moses as it were childishly playing, hurled if down to the ground, and
with his fee^e spurned it. Then the Priests and Soothsaiers seeing that, cried
out saying, that this was he, whom before he had prophesied should be borne,
which should destroy the kingdom of Egypt, except he were prevented by death.
Then Termuth the Kings daughter excused the child, alleging that his age had
yet ^o discretion. And for proof thereof caused burning coals to be put to
his mouth, which the child with his tongue lick^d, whereby he ever after had an
impediment in his tongue. And by this means, their fury at that time was
appeased. T. Lanquet.

The cause why Moses fled from Pharao.
Moses being about the age of 40. years fled for fear of Pharao, Exo. 5. 15.
when he had slain the Egyptian. Josephus says, that it was for displeasure,
because in the wars of Aethiope whereof he was Captain, he took to wise the
Kings Daughter of Aethiope.

How Moses seemed to doubt in Gods promises.
When God said to Moses, that he would give the people flesh to eat, Nu. 11. 21.
even a month long, he answered, shall the Sheep and the Oxen be slain for
this people to eat, which are vi. hundred thousand, or shall the fish of the
Sea be gathered together to serve them. Here it seems that Moses did doubt
in Gods promise, which was not so. For he doubted no more that God was able to
accomplish and fulfill his word: then Mary the mother of Christ did doubt in
the words of the Angel, Luke 1. 34.
when she said: How shall this be, seeing I know no man. Lyra.

How the Lord was angry with Moses, and why.
Moses being in his Inn, Exo. 4. 24.
the Lord met him and would have killed him. Some refer this to Moses and
say, that ye Lord would have killed him, because he carried Eleazer his son
with him, which was not circumcised. But Gerson was circumcised in the land of
Madian. Other refer this to Eleazer the child, saying, the Lord would have
killed him, because he being uncircumcised, would yet go into Egypt, to
remain among the children of Israel which were circumcised: but this seems
not to be so: for the child not yet being come to ^ull growth, was not in
fault, but Moses his father, which had the cure and charge of the child. Lyra.

How Moses stilled the murmuring of the people.
When Moses complained unto the Lord, Nu. 11. 14
that he was not able to bear the burden of the murmuring people alone, God
commanded him to choose out. 70. of the Elders of Israel, and bring them
before him, and he would take of his spirit and give unto them, and they should
bear the burden of the people with him, Nu. 11. 14
Then Moses willing to quench the murmuring of the Jews against him, chose out
of every Tribe. 6. because he would not take out of One Tribe more then
another. So that the number taken out of twelve Tribes came to. 72. And because
the Lord commanded no more but 70. Moses made 72. littlle rolls of paper, and
writ in them all saving in two (wherein was nothing written) and put them all in
a vessel togethers that no man saw them: and then each one should take out a
paper as his fortune was, and whosoever did light upon the papers unwritten, it
was a sign that God would not have them counted among the Seniours. Now were
there two of them named Eldad and Medad. Eldad and Medad.
whose chance was (by Gods providence) to draw the papers unwritten, wherefore
they went not up with the other 70. to the Tabernacle, but remained in the
host, upon whom (nevertheless) the spirit of Prophecy rested, so that they
prophesied. Then Joshua the son of Nun, hearing how they had prophesied of the
death of his master Moses, and how that Joshua should lead the people of Israel
into the Land of promise, spoke unto Moses, to forbid them. But Moses not
discontent with their prophecieng, wished that all the people could prophecy,
and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them all. Lyra

How Moses took to wife the Kings daughter of Aethiope.
The woman of Inde which Moses had to wife, was daughter to y^ king of
Aethiope, Nu. 12. 1
as Io^ephus writes. For what time (says he) as there arose cruel wars
between the Aethiopians and the Egyptians, the Aethiopians destroyed Egypt
and wasted the Country so so^e, that the Egyptians of necessity were
compelled to fly for counsel unto their Oracles and Diuinations, where they
received an answer, that they must elec^ an Hebrew Captain over their Army,
by whose help the Aethiopians should be subdned, upon the which, Moses, both
for his wisdom and personage was chosen sovereign Captain over their Army,
who so politikely set upon the Aethiopians, that at the first battle he put
them to flight, and slew a great number of them: and they not able to resist
him, fled, into their strong City called Saba, which City Moses besieged,
and did so valiant and so politikely assualt, that he was of the Kings Daughter
of Aethiope vehemently beloved: so that she not able to sustain the power of
love, sent unto him, requiring of him marriage. Who upon condition to render
unto him the City, was contented. Which thing (by her mean) was quickly
brought to pass, and be married unto her. By which occasion he subdued all
Aethiope, and returned into Egypt with great triumph. T. Lanquet.

Wherefore Moses slew the Egyptian.
He slew the Egyptian, Ex^. 2. 12
etc. That is, he declared himself to have such love unto his brethren the
Israelites that were the people of God, that he would rather slaye or be
^laine, then that his brother should suffer wrong of the enemies of y^ Lord. In
which act also, he showed himself to be predestinate of the Lord, to be a
defense and sauer of the Israelites. T. M.

What Moses face is.
Moses face is the law in her right understanding. Tindale.

Of Moses and Helias which talked with Christ.
And behold there appeared unto them Moses and Helias. Mat. 17. 3
No doubt this appearing and talk of Moses and Helias, did make very much to
y^ declaration of ye kingdom of Christ. Notwithstaning it is demanded, whether
they were truly present, or whether y^ a figure or show only of them was set
before y^ face of his disciples, even as visions of things absent, were set
before the prophets: although y^ matter be so probable, y^ both parties may
have good occasion to dispute, yet notwtsta^ding it is more likely y^ they were
truly brought into y^ place, neither it is any absurdity at al to say (seeing
yt God has both body and soul in his hand and power) y^ the dead for a time
may be restored to life, according to his will, Moses and Helias did not rise
unto themselves at y^ time, but they rose at ye will and commandment of God, to
be present for y^ time, with Christ. Again, if any demand how the Apostles
knew Moses and Helias whom they never saw: It may be answered that when God
had set them in the mids before them, he gave them signs and tokens, by the
which they might be known unto them. This truly was done by an extraordinary
manner of revelation, that they might certainly know Moses and Helias. But
why did these two rather then any other of the Saints appear ^ Surely that
reason ought to satisfy us, to say that the Law and the Prophets had no other
scope or end, then Christ. For it was a great aid and help to our faith,
that Christicame not forth without testimony, but was commended of God long
before. Therefore in Moses the Law, and in Helias the Prophets are
represented. Marl. upon Mat. fol. 377.

Of Moses chair what it signifies.
The Scribes and Pharesies sit in Moses seat, etc. Mat. 23. 2
Christ speaks of them that do teach the Law of Moses, and not of such as
wrap them in the constitutions of men. And even now happily must the Bishop be
heard that does truly teach the Gospel, though he live skant Gospel like. But
who can suffer them against Christ's doctrine, for their own profits, to make
and unmake laws, exercising upon the people plain Tyranny, and measuring all
things for their own advantage and authority. They that with traditions
imagined for their own lucre and tyranny, do hamper the people, do not sit in
the chair of the Gospel, but in the chair of Simon Magus and Cayphas.
Tindale.

To sit in Moses chair, Augu. in ^o. tra. 46^
was truly and rightly to instruct the people, and to open unto them the law of
Moses. S. Austen says, Sedendo super cathedram Mosis, etc. Sitting upon Mofes
chair, they teach the law of God: Therefore it is God that teaches by the
means of them. But if they will teach you things of their own, then hear
them not, then dde it not. For certainly such men seek their own, and not the
things that pertain to Christ Jesus.

The Chair of the which our Savior Christ makes mention here, does not
signify the authority of Moses, which the Scribes abused, but it signifies
the place out of the which, they purely red and interpreted the law of Moses.
To sit in Mos^s chair, is nothing else, then to show out of the Law of God,
how men ought to live. And although it be not certain out of what place they
did speak or preach, yet notwithstanding their conjectures is probable,
which refer it to the Pulpet which Esdras made, to have the Laws taught in.
He therefore sits in Moses Chair, which preaches not of his ^wne brain,
but by the authority and word of God. Marl. upon Math. fol. 521.

So long as the Scribes safe in Moses seat, and continued in the pure and
simple interpretation of the Law, teaching those things which the Lord had
commanded, and taught in the name of God. For Saint Austen very well and
according to the mind of Christ expounds that the Scribes sitting upon Moses
seat, taught the Law of God, and that therefore the sheep ought to hear the
shepherds by them as by hirelings. To the which words he adds by and by
saying: God therefore teaches by them. But if they go about to teach their
own inventions, neither hear them nor follow them. To the which sentence
agrees that which the same Father has in his fourth book De doctrina
Christiana, saying: Because the good and faithful do not hear every man, but
obediently hear God himself, therefore they are heard profitably, which also
live not profitably. Therefore the seat, not of the Scribes, but of Moses,
constrained them to teach, that which was good. For in their life, they did
what them lust, but the seat being none of theirs, suffered them not to teach
what they lusted. Marl. upon Math. fol. 522.

We ought to have an eye most especially unto the doctrine of the Preachers,
whether they sit in Christ's chair or not, that is to say, whether they teach
Christ's doctrine or not, for by their doctrine we shall be either justified or
condemned, and not by their living. Sir. I. Cheek.

How Moses did eat the body of Christ,
Look. Manna.

How this place is understood.
And Moses wrote this Law. Deu^. 31. 9
Before Moses time the doctrine which contained the manner of serving God, was
not put in writing, but only delivered by word of mouth by the fathers to
their children, from one generation to another. The Bible note.

How we are sent to Moses and the Prophets.
They have Moses and the Prophets, Luk 16. 29
let them hear them. We are bidden to believe Moses and the Prophets, and not
the dead, and if we will needs hear the dead speak, Christ ought to be
sufficient for us, which being revived, taught none other doctrine, but that
which he had taught in his time, that is to say, Moses and the Prophets. Sir.
I. Cheek.

Which declares that it is too late to be instructed by the dead, if in their
life time they cannot profit by the lively word of God: as faith comes by
Gods word, so is it maintained by the same. So that neither we ought to look
for Angels from heaven, or the dead to confirm us there, by only the word of
God is sufficient to life everlasting. Geneua.

Why Moses was bid to put off his shoes.
Put off thy shoes from thy feet. Act. 7. 33
Moses could not be suffered to talk with God, Exo. 3. 5
before he did put off his shoes, whereby we understand that we must put
away all fleshly and carnal lusts, and so approach unto God in faith and
pureness of heart. Let them here (which will not touch holy things with
their bare hands without gloves) learn of the Angel of the Lord, what they
ought for to do in such things.

Of Moses death and burial, which makes against relics.
We read of Moses the servant of the Lord, Deu. 36. 6
that he died in the land of Moab, and the Angel of the Lord buried him in a
valley, but no man knows of his Sepulcher unto this day, which thing was of
purpose by the providence of God, appointed so: that the Jews might have no
occasion thereby to com^nitte Idolatry. But if the translating of dead bones,
had been either for the glory of God or commodity of man, the relics of
such a one as Moses was, should not have been hidden. For doubtless of all
Prophets he was the greatest, by the testimony of God himself, who called him
faithful in all his house, to whom he spoke mouth to mouth, and by vision, and
not in dark words, and yet was not his body shrined, nor his bones carried in
procession, nor any Chapel erected for him. Indeed the Devil did attempt no
less, then to make it matter of superstition (for we read that there was a
strife betwixt him and Michael about Moses body) but the Angel of the Lord
withstood him. I. Calfehill.

MOTHER OF GOD.
Wherein Mary the mother of God, was most blessed.
TO be the child of God, Augu. de sanc. virg. ca. 3.
is a great deal greater grace, then to be the mother of God, which Saint
Austen proves thus: Beatior ^rgo Maria, etc. Mary was more blessed (or full of
grace) in that the received the faith of Christ, then in that she conceived the
flesh of Christ. Motherly kindred could have done Mary no good, Augu. in Ioh.
tra. 10
unless she had borne Christ more blessed in her heart, then she bare him in
her flesh. Again he says, Master mea quam, etc. My mother whom ye have called
blessed, therefore is blessed, because she has kept the word of God, not
because the word in her was made flesh.

How mother is taken for grandmother.
He put down Miacha his mother. 3. Reg. 1^. 13.
Mother for grandmother. As David is oftentimes called father, of them of whom
he was grandfather. And as Zephora Moses wife calls Raguel father, which yet
was her grandfather.

How the Church is called our mother.
Forsake not thy mothers teaching. Pr^u. 1. 8
That is of the Church wherein the faithful are begotten by the incorruptible
seed of Gods word. Geneua.

MOVNTAINES.
How Mountains here do signify Scriptures.
LEt them that be in Iewry fly then to the mountains. Mat. ^4. 16 Chriso. in
Ma ho 49
That is to say, let them that be in Christ's profession, fly to the
scriptures, the scriptures of the Apostles and Prophets be the mountains, etc
Our Lord knowing that there should be such confusion in ye last days, therefore
commands that Christen men y^ believe in Christ, willing to have an
assurance of the true faith, should have recourse to nothing else but unto the
scriptures. Otherwise if they have regard unto any other thing, they shall be
offend^d and perish, not understanding what is the true Church, and by means
hereof they shall fall in abomination of desolation. Jewel. fo. 722.

S. Hierome says: Hiero. in Nau ca. 3
The people before the second coming of Christ which shall be in glory, shall
leave their negligent and idle schoolmaisters, which have of long time deceived
them, and shall fly to the mountains of the Scriptures, and albeit they find
not one to teach them, yet shall their desire and endeavor be accepted before
God, for that they have sought unto these mountains, and the negligence and
slothfulness of their masters shall be reproved. Jewel. fol. 721.

What these Mountains signify.
That the Mountains may bring peace. Psa. 72. 3
By the mountains are understood the great men and Rulers that receive the
word of peace, and by the little hills their subjects. Psalm. 114. 4. 148. 9.
Luke 3. 5. T. M.

What is meant by the translating of Mountains.
He translateth Mountains. God translateth Mountains, Job. 9. ^.
not only those of the earth, but also the arrogant and proud Tyrants, and
the great Realms of the world, which by a borrowed speech are oftentimes in
the sriptures signified by mountains and hills. So translated he Pharao, Exo.
14. 28. and king Senacharib. Eze. 37.

What the name of this Mountain was.
Our Fathers worshipped in this mountain. (...). 4. 20
The name of this mountain is Garizim, whereupon Sanabalecta the Cuthite built
a Temple by Alexander of Macedony his leave, after the victory of Issica, and
made there Ma^asses his son in law high Priest. Josephus. bo. 11.

MOVRNE.
What it is to Mourn.
Mourn and weep, etc. To mourn in the Scripture signifies sometime, to make
an unmeasurable and grievous lamentation, as when a man for impatience and
grief smites his own body, renteth his clothes, teareth his hair, etc. So
in Math. 24. 30. And then shall all the kingdoms of the Earth mourn. T. M.

The mourning of the Christians under the Cross.
Blessed are they that mourn, Man. 5. 4.
etc. This mourning is that Cross, without the which was never Disciple of
Christ, nor never shall be. For of whatsoever state or degree thou be in this
world, if thou profess the Gospel, there follows th^e a Cross, as
warmness follows the Sun shining, under the which thy spirit shall groan
and mourn secretly, not only because the world and thine own flesh carrye
th^e away, clean contrary to the purpose of thine own heart, but also to see
and behold the wretchedness and misfortunes of the brethren, which because thou
love them as thy self, thou shall mourn and sorrow no less then for thy
self. Tindale. fol. 190.

How far mourning for the dead is admitted.
The Scripture admits the mourning for the dead. For in Deuteronomy. 34. the people
mourned for Moses. Abraham bewailed his wife Sara, Joseph mourned for his
father Jacob. David mourned for Ammon, Israel for Samuel, Martha for Lazarus:
And our Lord himself wept for Lazarus. Jesus the son of Syrach says 38.
chapter, verse 16. My son shed thy tears over the dead. But Ier. 22. 10
says: Bewail not y^ dead. And Christ says Luke. 7. 13. to the woman whose
son was dead, Weep not. Which counter saying Paul reco^cileth. 1. Tess. 4.
13. where he says: Brethren, I would not have you ignorant concerning them
that be fallen a sleep, that ye sorrow not as other do which have no hope.
So it is ^e^thenish sorrow that is forbid, which have no hope nor comfort of
the resurrection. Hem^yng.

And made great lamentation for him. Act. 8. 2
A moderate mourning for the dead ought not to be reproved, so y^ all
supers^ition be laid aside, howbeit these godly and devout persons y^ be
spo^en of here, did rather make this lamentation for Steven, because they had
lost such an ^arnest and valiant de^^nder of the truth, then for any other
thing. For without all peradventure, they had a hope of resurrection, and that
no harm was happened unto him. Sir. I. Cheek.

MOUTH.
What the mouth of God is.
GOds mouth is taken for the son of God the Father, Augustine
or his commandments. Esaias. 40. 5. the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.

The meaning of this place following.
He has made my mouth like a sharp sword, Esa 49. ^
etc. That is, he has given me the spirit of sharp and pithye speech, so
that my words shall even cut a sunder (as it were) the hearts of the chosen
which hear me, and drive them to repentance, and declare the offenses of the
wicked, and without excuse. This does the spirit of Prophecy and of true
preaching of the word. Apoc. 16. T. M.

He has made my mouth like a sharp sword. That is spoken in the person of
Christ, to assure the faithful that these promises should come to pass, for
they were all made in him, and in him should be performed. Geneua.

Of the staff of Gods mouth.
Look. Staff.

MVLTITVDE.
How it is not good always to follow a multitude.
THe Turks being in number five times more then we Christians, do knowledge
one God, and believe many things of God, moved only by the authority of
their Elders, and presume that God will not let so great a multitude err so
long time, and yet they have erred and been faithless. 800. years. And the
Jews believe this day, as much as the carnal sort of them ever believed,
moved also by the authority of the Elders only, and think that it is
impossible for them to err, being Abraham's seed, and the children of them to
whom the promise of all that we believe were made. And yet they have erred and
have been faithless this 15. hundred years.

The elect which are few, shall among that great multitude, never be without
persecution and temptation of their faith, as the great multitude of the Pope,
persecute and suffer not: and yet the same in the mids of their persecution,
shall be kept by the mighty hand of GOD, against all natural possibility.

We must suspect as many things as the rude multitude with great assent and
consent appears. Many be called, Mat. 22. 14
but few be chosen. Broad is the way that leads to destruction, Mat. 7. 13
and many there be that enter thereinto. Mat. 13. 8
Of seed sown in four places, fruit was brought forth but in one.

MVRDER.
Who be Murderers.
ANd murderers. Apoc. 21. 8
That is to wit, with tongue, mind, hand, or by withholding of things
needful, of which sort be those Can^sh Gyaunts, and great men of name like
Nymrod the strong hunter, which murder guiltless persons at their pleasure,
and make them as sheep to the slaughter. Which thing no man does more cruelly
at this day, then does the Romish Bishop, the Uicar and stepfollower of that
meek Lamb, and the successor of Peter, whom Christ commanded to put up his
sword. And there be other of the chief Prelates also, which are very diligent
in following the example of the Romish Bishop, but God will abhor those
bloudthirstie and deceiptfull men. Psalm. 5. 6. Mar. upon the Apo. fo. 289.

The vnpitifull murderers are also the same bloudthirst^e Prelates, those
Caines, and those boisterous Nemrothes, that never will be satisfied with the
slaughter of Innocents.

No cruel Antichrist after John Wickleues time, did so spit^fully persecute
the verity of Christ in England, as did Philip Ripingdon, made then of a false
Brother and perjured Christian, Bishop of Lincoln. The Graund Captain of
this mad muster, is the proud Bishop of Rome, the preposterous Uicar of
the Lamb, and the unworthy successor of Peter, in that he has not yet put
up his sword. Of the same sort also are all those cruel Princes and
unmerciful Magistrates, that applies their authorities, powers and officers
unto the same mischief. Such deceiptfull ravenous and abominable
bloudshedders, the merciful Lord abhors evermore, Of this number was Pharao
and Herod, with innumerable Tyrants since, which to rehearse in order were too
long. I. ^ale.

Murder first committed.
Cain was the first murderer of man, Gen 4. 8
for he slew and murdered his own brother Abel. And why slew he him? Saint
John makes answer in his first Epistle the third Chapter: Because (says
he) his own works were evil, and his brothers good. Lanquet.

MUSIC.
The first inuenter of Music.
TVbal the son of Lamech by his wife Ada, (...) ^ ^2
invented the science of Music, by the stroke and noise of hammers of his
brother Tubalkain which was a Smith. Lanquet.

How far Music is sufferable in holy assemblies
Praise the Lord upon the harp, (...) 1^0. 3
etc. There is no doubt but that in this verse he expresses the vehemency and
earnestness of his affection in praising God, when he will y^ Musical
instruments should be applied to that use. For he would have nothing by the
faithful that may kindle their minds and senses to set out the praises of God.
For although Gods glory be not properly sett^ forth, but by plain utterance
of speech: yet is it not for naught that he has added these helps wherewith
the faithful are wont to stir up themselves, specially seeing he spoke to
the people of old time. For there is a difference to be held, that we draw
not to our selves, (without respect) whatsoever was commanded the Jews in
old time. And I an^ out of deubt for my part, that the plaieng of Cymballes,
singing to the Harp and Uiall, and all the whole order of Music, whereof
mention is made oftentimes in the Psalms, was a part of the law of schooling:
I mean of the solemn furniture of the Temple. For at this day, if the
faithful cheer up themselves with instruments of Music, I say their
purpose ought to be, not to sever their mirth from the praises of God. But when
they haunt their holy assemblies, I think that musical instruments are no more
meet for ye setting forth of Gods praises, then if a man shall call again
sensing and lamps, and such other shadows of the law. Foolishly therefore
have y^ Papists borrowed this and many other things of the Jews. Men y^ are
given to outward pomps, delight in such noise, but God lyketh better the
simplicity which he commends to us by his Apostle For Paul. 1 Cor. 14.
suffers not men to praise God in the open congregation of the faithful, but
with a known tongue. Certes the voice of man (although it be not understood of
all in general) far exceli all dead instruments What shall we then say of
chauntinge, which only seedeth the ^ares with a vain sound: if any man
object that music, avails greatly to the stirring up of men's minds: truly
I grant it does so, howbeit it is always to be ^cared least some corruption
should creep in, which might both defile the pure service of God, and also
bind men with superstition. Moreover, seeing that the holy Ghost warns us
expressly of y^ danger by the mouth of Saint Paul: to proceed further then we
have warrant there, I say it is not only an unadvised zeal, but also a wicked
stubburnenesse. Calvin.

Why the Musical Instruments in old time were used.
Bring forth the Tabret, the merry Harp with the Uiall. The Levites not
without cause, Psa. 21. 3.
used instruments of Music under the old law, because it was Gods will to
train his people (which as yet were tender and childish) with such
introductions until the coming of Christ. But now when the brightness of the
Gospel (having chased away the shadow of the law) betaketh to us the service
of God in a plainer sort, we shall do but foolishly and lewdly to counterfeit
that thing which the Prophet appointed only for his own time, whereby it
appears that the Papists were right Apes, in conueieng over this thing unto
themselves. Calvin.

What Music Saint Austen allowed.
Augustine in the book of Confession, both confesses, and also is sorry, that
he had sometimes fallen, because he had given more autentiue heed unto the
measures and cords of music, then the words which were under them spoken.
Which thing hereby he proves to be sin, because measure and singing were
brought in for the words sake, and not words for music. And he so repented
him of his fault, that he exceedingly allowed the manner of the Church of
Alexandria used under Athanasius. For he commanded the reader, that when he
song, he should but little alter his voice, so that he should be like rather
unto one that reads, then to one that sings. Howbeit on the contrary, when
he considered how at the beginning of his conuertion, he was inwardly moved
with these things, namely in such sort, that for the zeal of pi^tie he burst
forth into tears, for this cause I say, he consented that music should be
retained in the Church, but yet in such manner, that he said he was ready to
change his sentence^ if a better reason could be assigned. And he added, that
those do sin deadly, as they were wont to speak, which give greater heed to
music, then unto the word of God, to which sentence undoubtedly Hierome
affirms as he has noted upon ye Epistle to ye Ephesians. Gregory also of
Rome in the Sinode of Rome, was of the same opinion, and both their words are
written in the Decrees, did. 92. in the Chapter, Cantantes, and in the Chapter
In sancta Romana. In which place are read in the Gloss, two verses, not indeed
so eloquent, but yet godly.

Non vox sed votum, non cordula musica sed cor,
Non clamans sed amans, cantat in aure Dei.
The English.
Not the voice but the desire, not the pleasantness of music, But ye voice
not crieng, but loving, sings in the ears of God.

And in the words of Gregory, this is not slightly to be passed over, in that
he says, Whilst the sweetness of the voice is sought for, the life is
neglected, and when wicked manners provoke God, the people is ravished by the
pleasantness of the voice. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 103.

Look more in Singing.

Naaman.
How Naaman was justified by faith.
NAaman the Sirian was (no doubt) a good and godly man, 4. Reg. 5.
and had a religious and reverent opinion of God. And although he was a Gentile
and belonged not to the kingdom of Moses, which then flourished: yet
notwithstanding his flesh was cleansed, and the God of Israel was revealed unto
him, and he received the holy Ghost, for thus he says: Now I know assuredly
that there is none other God in all the world, but in Israel. He does nothing
at all, he keeps not the law, he is not circumcised, but only prays that
so much of that earth might be given unto him, as two mules should be able to
carry away Moreover it appears that faith was not idle in him, for he says
to the Prophet Eliseus, Thy servant will henceforth neither offer burnt
sacrifice nor offering unto any other God, saving the Lord. But in this thing,
the Lord be merciful unto thy servant: that when my Master goes into ye
house of Rimmon to worship there, and leans upon my hand, and I boowe my
self in the house of Rimmon: when I boowe down (I say) in y^ house of Rimmon,
The Lord be merciful unto thy servant in this point, to whom the Prophet
says, Go in peace. So was he justified. The Jew hering this, fre^teth for
anger, and says, What? Should the Gentile be justified without the keeping of
y^ law? Should he be compared with us which are circumcised, etc. Luther upon
the Gal. fol. 91.

How it was against Naamans heart to worship Idols any more.
Herein the Lord be merciful unto thy servant, that when my Master goes
into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and leans on my hand^ and I boowe
my self in the house of Rimmon, etc. He feels his conscience wounded in
being present at Idols service, and therefore desires God to forgive him,
least others by his example might fall to Idolatry: for as for his own part,
he confesses that he will never serve any but the true God. Geneua.

NABVCHODONOSOR.
How his death is compared to Lucifer.
HOw a^t thou fallen from heaven (O Lucifer) thou fair morning child. Esa. 14.
12
He compares the death of Nabuchodonosor to the falling of Lucifer the morning
star, which he calls y^ child of the morning, because it appeared only
in the morning. The meaning is, no such thing ought to have happened unto thee,
that in earth was like the morning star, which no man can take out of heaven,
and thou that wast so mighty, y^ thou destroi^dst what people thou would,
and to whom it was pastime to overthrow nations, have received such measure as
thou broughtest. Such a like thing is there in Ezechiel. 28. against king
Tyrus. T. M.

Thou that thoughtest thy self most glorious, as it were placed in the heaven,
for the morning star that goes before the Sun is called Lucifer, to whom
Nabuchonodosor is compared. Geneua.

How Nabuchodonosor is Gods servant.
And I will prepare Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon Iere. 25. 9.
my servant, and will bring him upon this land. So the wicked and Satan
himself are Gods servant, because be makes them to serve him by constraint,
and tourneth that which they do of malice, to his honor and glory. Geneua.

What his policy was to have of the kings seed, and of the Princes of Israel.
That he should bring certain of the kings seed, Dan. 1. 3.
and of the Princes. His purpose was to keep them as Hostages, and that he
might show himself victorious, and also by their good entreaty and learning
of his religion, they might favor rather him then the Jews, and so to be able
to serve him as governors in their land. Moreover, by this means the Jews
might be better kept in subjection, fearing otherwise to procure hurt to these
noble men. Geneua.

For what purpose he set up Image of gold.
Nabuchodonosor the king made an Image of gold, Dan. 3. 1.
etc. Under pretense of religion and holiness in making an Image to his Idol
Bell, he sought his ambition and vainglorie: And this declares he was not
touched with the true fear of God, but that he confessed him of a sodeine
motion, as the wicked when they are overcome with the greatness of his works.
The Greek interpreters write that this was done. 18. years after the dream,
and as may appear, the king feared least the Jews by their religion should
have altered the state of his common weal, and therefore he meant to bring all
to one kind of religion, and so rather sought his own quietness then Gods
glory. Geneua.

How this place following is understood.
Hell trembles at thy coming, etc. That is, even they that be in hell will
tremble when Nabuchodonosor comes thither. It is figuratively spoken, to the
further setting forth of the mischief of Nabuchodonosor. T. M.

Who is meant by Lucifer in this place of Esaias.
Thy pride (says Esaias) is driven down to hell, Esa. 14. 12.
etc. How ^ellest (...) ^ucifer from heaven which did rise in the morning, and
(...) will (...) up to heaven, I will advance my self (...) of God: I will sit
in the mount of witness, in the sides of the North: I will go up above the
highest of the clouds: I will be like the highest: but for all that thou shall
be thrust down to hell, etc. Without al nay (says Musculus) it contey^eth the
prophecy of the proud king of Babylon which was then to come, although it be
by some expounded for the fall of Satan. Musculus. so. 10.

NATION.
Whom he calls a Nation.
I Will provoke you to envy by a Nation that is no Nation. Romans 10. 19.
He calls all profane people a Nation, that is no Nation, as they are not
said to live but to dye, which are appointed for everlasting condemnation.
Esaias. 65. 1. Beza.

NAKED.
How this word Naked is to be understood.
IF that we be found clothed and not naked, etc. They are naked that have not
the wedding garment of faith, 2. C^r. 5. 3.
working through love upon them. They are naked, that without all shame, do
give themselves in this world, to filthy, wicked, and devilish conversation,
putting away from them the spirit of God and reason. It is said that our
mantion is from heaven, and not because it comes from heaven, but because
that it receives from thence, the grace or gift of immortality and
incorruption. Sir. I. Cheek.

How Saul is said to be naked.
And ^ell naked all that day. Saul is said to fall naked, for so much as he
put of his kinglye apparel, and put on such as the Prophets used to wear in
the time of prophesieng. Geneua.

How that the people is said to be naked.
Saw that the people were naked. That is, destitute of Gods grace, wild,
licentious, and ready to fall into all kind of Idolatry, whereby they gave
their enemies an occasion to speak evil of their God. Geneua.

NARROVV WAY.
What the narrovv way is.
ANd the way is narrow that le^^eth to life. Mat. ^. (...).
The narrow way is, to live after the true knowledge of the law, and the true
intent of works, he that will enter in at this gate, must be made a new, his
head will else be to great. He must be untaught all that he has learned, to
be made less to enter in, and defused in all things, to the which he has been
accustomed, to be made less to walk the narrow way, whereby he shall find
such an heap of temptations, and so continual, that it shall be impossible
to endure or to stand, but by prayer and strong faith. Tindale.

Look. Strait gate.

NATVRE.
What Nature is.
NAture (says Plato) is that thing that God will. His meaning is, that nature
is subject and obedient ot God: and that there is neither change nor
necessity in the course of nature, but al things are ordered by Gods
omnipotency, and natural causes are only the instruments of Gods will. It was
Gods will that Christ should take the natural substance of man's body, and that
in all things he should be like unto his brethren, and that his body should be a
creature. And as S. Austen says, should be in one place. This is Gods known
and express will. Therefore by Platos judgment, this is nature.

Nature is sundry ways defined. Some do take it to be a certain strength
void of reason, stirring up necessary motions in our bodies. Again, some do
judge it to be a strength which has reason and order, as proceeding some
certain way, and declaring what the cause of every thing works, and what
follows the quicknes and actiuitie. Whereof no art nor hand, neither workma^
is able to attain unto by immitation or following it. Epicure does call all
things by the name of nature. Augustine defines it after this manner. Nature
(says he) is a certain strength and power put into things created by God,
which gives to each that which belongs unto it. Surely the very word seems
to signify, that nature is called to be the same, which is proper unto every
thing, and that as grafted and bred in it at the very beginning, so y^
whatsoever any thing is of ye birth as it were, y^ is the nature thereof.
Lactantius says: y^ nature is termed of ye latin word Nascendo, which is of
birth. My opinion (says Lactantius) is not, y^ nature is the thing it self,
but ye proper and peculiar strength of the thing naturally given unto it,
straight way from the beginning thereof, whereby it receives y^ quality, which
it has not only of being, but also of doing, bearing and begetting, etc.

What the nature of Gods word is.
The nature of Gods word is, y^ whosoever reads it, or hears it reasoned
and disputed before him, it will begin immediately to make him every day better
and better, till he be grown to a perfect man in the knowledge of Christ, and
love of the law of God, or else make him worse and worse, till he be hardened,
y^ he openly resist the spirit of God, and then blaspheme after the example of
Pharao, Coran, Abir^on, Balam, Judas, Simon Magus, and such other. Tindale.

What the nature of God is.
Of the nature of God Augustine writes on this wise: All natures either is God
who has no beginning, or is not God, because he is the beginner thereof. As for
y^ which has God for y^ beginner of it, by who^ it is, some is not made, and
some is made. That which is not made, and yet for all that is of him, either is
begotten of him, either proceeds from him. That which is born, is the only
son: That which proceeds is the holy spirit, and this trinity is of one
and self same nature. For these three be one, and each of them is God, and
altogether one God, immutable: everlasting, without any beginning or end of
time. But nature which is made, is called a creature, and God is called a
creator, I mean the Trinity. Musculus.

How the nature of any creature in it self is not evil, howsoever it be used.
When Hierico was destroyed, ^osua. 6. 19.
and all things accursed, and not lawful for the Israelites to touch any thing
thereof, yet was the gold and the silver, and their brass and iron vessels,
carried into ye tresure house of the Lord, and consecrated unto him.

Gedeon was commanded to take and sacrifice that Ox of his Fathers to God,
Iudic. 6. (...).
which his Father had sed and brought up to be sacrificed unto Baal, yea, and
to burn that Ox with y^ self same wood, that was consecreated and dedicated
unto the Idol.

Bucer says, y^ for any thing to be a note of Antichrist, is not in the nature
of any creature in it self (for to y^ end nothing was made of God) but it
hangs altogether of consenting to Antichrists religion and the professing
thereof: the which consent and professing being changed into the consent and
professing Christianity, there can stick in the things themselves, no note or
mark of Antichrists religion. The use of Bells was a mark of
Antichristianitie in our Churches, when the people by them were called to
Masses, and when they were ronge against tempests: Now they are a token of
Christianity, when the people by the^ are gathered together to the Gospel of
Christ, and other holy actions, etc.

Of three natures of men.
There are three natures of men. One altogether beastly, which in no wise
receive the law written in their hearts, but rise against Princes and rulers,
whenever they are able to make their party good: These are signified by them
that worshipped the golden Cal^e, for Moses brake the table of the law, ere
he came at them. The second are not so beastly, but receive y^ law, and unto
them the law comes, but they look not Moses in the face, for his
countenance is too bright for them, that is, they understand not that the law
is spiritual, and requires the heart, they look on the pleasure, profit, and
promotion that follows the keeping of the law, and in respect of the reward,
keep the law outwardly with works, but not in the heart. For if they might
obtain like honor, glory, promotion, and dignity, and also avoid all
inconveniences, if they break the law, so would they also break the law and
follow their lusts. The third are spiritual, and look Moses in the open face,
and are (as Paul says) a law unto themselves, and have the law written in
their hearts, by the spirit of God. These need neither of king nor officer to
drive them, neither that any profer them any reward for to keep the law, for
they do it naturally. The first work for fear of the sword. The second for
reward. The third work for love. Tindale.

Of two natures in Christ.
Look. Christ.

NAVEL.
What the Navel does signify.
IN the day of thy birth when thou wast borne, ^say. 16. 4.
the string of thy Navel was not cut off, etc. The Navel signifies the
desires and delectations of man, which are healed by the word and fear of
God, as it is said. Proverbs. 3. 8. But feary y^ Lord and depart from evil, so
shall thy Navel be whole. The learned expound this whole sentence, of the
tribulation that Israel suffered in Egypt, and after among the Chaldes. After
the death of Joseph when Pharao knew them not. Exo. 1. were they most abject and
vile, and no man had compassion on them. The^ was the day of their birth. And
in like case after the destruction of Jerusalem, and in their imprisonment at
Babylon, at both these times were they motherlesse and helpless concerning
their own strength, but were yet cared for of God, and received by his mercy.
The Prophet borrows his fashion of speaking of the manners of mothers, after
the birth of their children, which first dress their nauells, and wash them
with s^lt, and then swadle them, etc. Such help had Israel none in his
adversity in Egypt and Babylon, but lay over whelmed in their filthiness and
miseries, and were regarded as bastards, and unworthily entreated of all men.
There was no man but only God that took thought for them, and that he only of
his mere mercy without any of their deseruings. T. M.

NAZARAEANS.
What these Nazaraeans were in their opinions.
THe Nazaraeans were such as used no living creatures, Heretics.
they abhorred the eating of flesh. They allowed of Moses and of y^ law written
by him, but they denied y^ the. 5. books under his name, were written by him,
affirming themselves to have found other books. Epiphan. li. 1. Tom. 1.
heraes. 18.

Nazaraei were Jews which believed in Christ, and so called themselves of
Nazareth. They contraried the Jews, in that they confessed Jesus to be the
son of God. They erred in christian religion, for that they addicted
themselves wholly to the observation of the whole law. Epiph. heraes. 29.

NECENAS.
What he was.
NEcenas was a noble man in Rome, and a great man with Augustus Caesar, and so
great a ^auourer and promoter, and setter forth of V^^gil, Horace, and such
other learned men, that ever since his time, all those that do notably
promote, help, or ^auour students or learned men, are of his name called
Necenates. V dal.

NEGINOTH.
What it is.
TO him that excels on Neginoth, Psa. 4. 1.
a Psalm. Among them that were appointed to sing the Psalms, and to play on
the instruments, one was appointed chief to set the tune, and so begin: who
had the charge, because he was most excellent, and he began this Psalm on the
instrument called Neginoth, or in a tune so called. Geneua.

Calvin does take this word ( Neginoth) for the chief master of the Quere.
And I do ( Says he) derive this word Neginoth, of Nagaz, which signifies to
strike, and therefore I doubt not, but that it was an instrument of music,
whereupon it follows, that this Psalm was to be song, not only in an high
note, but also with plaieng upon instruments, which were ruled and ordered by
the same master of whom mention is made. Call. upon the. 4. Psalm.

Neginoth signifies the tune or note of the instrument, where after the Psalm
before which it is prefixed were song: for the Psalms were song at certain
instruments, but so that the sweet tune and melody of the instruments prepared
ye mind more perfectly to perceive the word of the holy ditie. T. M.

NEGLIGENCE.
What negligence is.
NEgligence is nothing else then a privation of that ende^our, which we ought
to apply for the governing of things, by it the will is weakened, and the
cheerfulness of the body is diminished. Pet. Mar. upon Indic. fo. 247.

NEHILOTH.
What it signifies.
NEhiloth, signifies by interpretation, heritages, or as some will, Psalm. 5.
a certain instrument of music. T. M.

NEHVSTAN.
What Nehustan is, and how the Serpent was so called.
And he called it Nehustan. ^. Re. 18. 4.
That is, a piece of brass: thus he calls the Serpent by contempt, which
notwithstanding was set up by the word of God, and miracles were wrought by
it, yet when it was abused to Idolatry, this good king destroyed it, not
thinking it worthy to be called a Serpent, but a piece of brass. Geneua.

NEIGHBOVR.
What this word Neighbor signifies:
Neighbor is a word of love, Luk 10. 34.
and signifies that a man should be ever nigh and at hand, and ready to
help in time of need. As the Samaritane was to help his neighbor, that was
wounded with thieves, leaving behind (with his host) two pence to bestow upon
him, more if need were, signifieng thereby, that h^ was every where
merciful, both present and absent, without faining, cloaking, complaining, or
excusing, and forsook not his neighbor, as long as he had need. Tindale.

Who is our neighbor.
Augustine Augustine.
does prove by many arguments, that every man is to be understood in the name
of a neighbor, and he has respect therein unto the fellowshippe and company
of our common nature. But yet they which do live in places far off from us,
albeit they be man also, that cannot for all that conveniently, be called our
neighbors, which by any occasion are joined unto us, so that their necessity,
may be presented unto our senses, and become able to receive of our benefits
and well doings. August. de doct. Christ. chap. 30. Et libro de vera religi.

My neighbor is every man, specially which has need of my help. As Christ
expounds it in the. 10. chap. of Luke. Who although he has done me some
wrong of hurt me by any manner way, yet notwithstanding he has not put off
the nature of man, or ceased to be flesh and blood, and the creature of God
most like unto thy self, brieflye, he cease not to be my neighbor. As long
then as the nature of man remains in him, so long also remains
commandment of love, which requires at my hand, that I should not despise
mine own flesh, nor render evil for evil, but overcome evil with good, or
else shall love never be as Paul describes it. ^. Cor. 13. Luther upon the
Gal.

How our neighbor ought to be loved.
Love thy neighbor as thy self. Gal. 5. 14.
Indeed this is brieflye spoken but yet very aptly and to the purpose. No man
can give a more certain, a better, or a nearer example, then a man's own
self. Therefore if thou would know how thy neighbor ought to be loved,
and would have a plain example thereof, consider well how thou love thy
self. If thou should be in necessity or danger, thou would be glad to
have the love and friendship of all men, to be helped with the counsel, the
goods and the strength of all men, and of all creatures. Wherefore thou have no
need of any book to instruct and admonish thee how thou ought to love thy
neighbor, for thou have an excellent book of all laws, even in thy heart.
Thou need no schoolemaister in this matter. Ask counsel only of thine
own heart, and that shall teach thee sufficiently that thou ought to love thy
neighbor as thy self. Luther upon the Gal. fol. 245.

NESTORIVS.
Of this man's heresy.
NEstorius the heretic, by birth a German, yet Priest of Antioch, was sent
for by Theodotius to Constantinople, and there made Bishop. For his cruelty
he was called a firebrand. He brought from Antioch a Priest in his company,
whose name was Anastasius, which taught in the Church, that Marie was not to
be called the mother of God^ whom he defended, and avoided as Socrates says
in this clause: The mother or bearing God as a bugge or fraieng Ghost, yet he
proceeded in spite, and being called to the counsel of Ephesus, he denied
that Christ was God, and seeing that there rose great stir thereof, he
seemed to repent, but the Council deposed and banished him into Oasis, GOD
winking not at his impiety, but plagued diversely him from above his tongue was
eaten up of worms, and so he died. Socra. li. 7. chap. 22. 23. 29. Euag. li.
1. chap. 2. 3. 7.

NEW.
What it is to be new.
THat is known to be new which neither ever was before, nor has been yet
seen or heard of, but now beginning and comes to light first. And therefore
Solomon says, that there is nothing under the Sun that is new, nor that it
can be said lo, that is new: for that it has gone, and ben before in times
past. Indeed a thing seems to be new, when it has been in times past, and
is now corrupted and perished, either by time, abuse, or negligence of men, by
restoring again is renewed, not that it begins now first to be, but rather
to be the same which it was before. And in v^rie deed it is nothing less then
new. For it is one thing to make a thing new, and to renew a thing which was
made long ago. They be said to make new things, which do in^titute new
things before unused and unknown, and they are said to renew, which do
restore things decayed, unto their old estate and use. So the law was new,
which was given by Moses to be kept of the Israelites, when it was first set
forth in the mount Sina. And the Gospel of Christ was new when it was first
declared in the world by the Apostles. But the law was now new, when by the
care of godly kings it was restored and renewed, after that it had been once
corrupt. The histories of the kings, Asa, Hezechias, and of Josias be well
known. Neither was the doctrine of the Prophets new, when they did rebuke the
corruptnesse of the lawish religion, and requires the right and true
observation of Gods law, although it seemed never so new and strange. Muse.
fo. 361.

By whose fault the doctrine of Christ seems now new to the Papists.
What time as the book of the law was found in the days of king Josias, in
the secret corner of the temple, and was exhibited unto the king himself, it
might have seemed some new thing unto them which had lived a great while
without law: where ind^ed nothing ought to have been more used or known to
the people, but through whose fault was it? Was it not the fault of their
a(...)itors, which would no longer hear the words of that book? I mean the
kings and Priests, which leaving the sermons of the law, followed the
ceremonies of the Gentiles. Compare here with all those things which are
betided us. Has not the holy Bible been hidden and cast into corners these
many ages, and v^knowne to the multitude of the unfaithful, yea, too many of
the pastors also, and in this our age, what time it is translated into all
languages well near, and set forth commonly to be read, is it any otherwise
taken of y^ superstitious Papists, then if there were some new and unknown
doctrine thrust into ye Churches? You might have found in times past, in the
Popery, a number of Massing Priests and pastors, which had never as much as
seen y^ holy Bible, came not this through fault of our aunce^ors, would God
the heads and Princes of christen people would knowledge it, and say with
Josias, Go ask counsel of the Lord for us, and for our people, for ye Lords
anger is great over us, because our Fathers heard not the words of this
book, and that they would not only acknowledge their fault, but also with a
godly and holy endeavor, renew and set up again the decayed religion,
according unto y^ Lords word, and in so doing, they should turn away the Lords
wrath from themselves, and from their people, etc. Muse. fo. 362.

A declaration of the old and new Testament.
New Testament is as much to say, as a new covenant, The old Testament is an
old temporal covenant, made between God and the carnal children of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, otherwise called Israel, upon the deeds and
observing of a temporal law, where the reward of keeping is temporal life,
and prosperity in the land of Canaan, and the breaking, is reward with
temporal death and punishment. But the new testament is an everlasting
covenant made unto the chrildren of God, through faith in Christ, upon the
serving of Christ.

Where eternal life is promised to all that believe, and death to all that are
unbelieving. My deeds if I keep the law, are rewarded with the temporal
promises of this life. But I believe in Christ, Christ's deeds has purchased
for me, the eternal promise of everlasting life. If I commit nothing worthy of
death, I deserve for my reward that no man kill me^ If I hurt no man, I am
worthy that no man hurt me: If I help my neighbor, I am worthy he help me
again. So that with outward works, with which I serve other men, I deserve
that other me^ do like to me in this world: and they extend no farther. But
Christ's deeds extend to life everlasting unto all that believe, etc. Tindal. in
his Pro. to the new Test.

How they called Christ's doctrine new doctrine.
What new doctrine is this. Mar. 1. 27.
They blasphemed, which did call the doctrine a new doctrine, for Christ did
only by himself speak those things, which before he had spoken by the
Prophets. Sir. I. Cheek.

It was then n^w, and now after fifteen hundred and seven and thirty years,
is yet new, when will it then be old. Tindale.

They refer the miracle to the kind of doctrine, and so marvel at it, as a
new and strange thing, and do not consider the power of Christ, who is the
author of the one and the other. Geneua.

NICHOLAS.
Of the heresy that sprang up by the occasion of this man.
NIcholas one of the seven deacons, is by S. John abhorred. Act. 6. 5.
Apoc. 2. 6. He was accused of gelousie over his wife, and to clear himself
of this crime, he brought forth his wife, and bid marry her who would. This
fact of his is excused by Eusebius. His followers by occasion hereof, do
practice their wandering lust, without respect of wife or maid. Eusebius. Eccl.
hist. li. 3. chap. 26.

How this Nicholas the Deacon is excused.
When the Church was yet springing, as Eusebius testifies in his. 3. book of
his history, the. 26. chapter, the Nicholaites did openly and manifestly commit
fornication, and laid the custom of their wicked crime to Nicholas the
deacon: although Clemens Bishop of Alexandria in Stromatis no excuse Nicholas:
for he says that he never thought or taught any such thing. But having a fair
woman to his wife, and therefore being thought to have been gelous over her,
he brought her forth before the people, and said: This is my wife, and that ye
might understand that I am not gelous over her, I am content for my part that
any of you take her to wife, which thing also he meant, as far as the laws
of God would suffer. But they which were afterward called Nicholaites,
understanding his words peruersly, supposed, that the wives among Christians
ought to be common. Pet. Mart. upon Iudic. fo. 230.

NIGHT.
How night is taken in this place.
THe night comes when no man can work. John. 9. 4.
The night is when the true knowledge of Christ, how he only justifies is
lost, then can no man work a good work in the sight of God, how glorious so
ever his works appear. Tindale.

How the night was divided into four parts.
Augustine in his sermon De verbis Domini, the. 14 Oration^ says, that the
elders divided the night into four parts, of which every one contained. 3.
hours, which he confirms also by the testimonies of the holy Scriptures. For
it is said, that the Lord came unto the Apostles in the. 4. watch of the night,
when they labored so vehemently in the sea, that their Ship was very near
sunk. The same Father writes the like thing upon the. 79. Psalm. The gloss
also in the Decrees. 1. question. The one, Mat. 14. 25
Super veniente pascha, makes mention of the names of those parts of the
night. Conticinium, Intempestem, Gallicinium, Antelucanum That is, the bed
time, the dead part of y^ night, the cock crowing, and the dawning of the day.
Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 139.

For a thousand years in thy sight, Psa. 90. 4.
etc. as a watch in the night. As touching this word (watch) we know how me^ in
old time were wont to divide ye night into four watches, of which each one
consists in three hours a piece. Now this similitude is added, to make the
matter seem less, as who would say, a thousand years in Gods sight differed
nothing from. 3. hours of the night, in which men scarcely know, whether they
be a wake or a sleep. Calvin.

NILVS.

NIMROTH.
By this man was Idolatry first invented.
Look. Idolatry.

Why he was called an hunter.
IN that he was called an hunter, is signified that he was a deceiuer of
souls, an oppressor of men. And for that he withdrew men from the true
religion of God, he was so called.

NINE.
Of the nine that returned not again unto Christ.
BUt where are those nine. Luk 17. 17
The Priests had so abused the nine, and made them believe that they were
healed and cleansed of their leprosy by their works and other obseruaunces
that they returned not to Christ to give him praise, which had only healed them
as he had done the other. I. Veron.

He notes here their ingratitude, and that the greatest part, neglect the
benefits of God. Geneua.

NOETVS.
What his heresy was.
NOetus denied that there were three persons, Heretic.
saying all three were on. He called himself Moses and said that Aaron was his
brother, he said, the Father, the Son, and the Holy ghost, suffered in the
flesh. Epiph. haeres. 57.

NOSE OF GOD.
What the Nose of God signifies.
THe Nose of God (says Augustine) does signify his inspirations in the hearts
of the faithful. Augustine
Smoke went out at his nostrells. 2. Reg. 22. 9.

NOT.
The meaning of these places following.
THou art not far from the kingdom of God. Mar. 12. 34.
When Christ had heard the discreet answer of the Scribe, concerning the
love of God, and the love of his neighbor: he said unto him: Thou art not
far from the kingdom of God, that is, thou have the true knowledge of the
law, and lacks nothing but faith and trust in me, by which only comes
everlasting life.

To sit on my right hand, and on my left is not mine to give. Ma. 20. 23
Though Christ had received all power of his Father, yet had he not received it
to this end, that he should give the glory of his kingdom unto other, then
his father had appointed. Beside that, Christ does here speak as a man. For
touching his Godhead, he was and is equal with the Father. Sir. I. Cheek.

God my Father has not given me charge to bestow Offices, but to be an example
of humility unto all. Geneua.

Thou shall not kill. Ex. 20. 13
God says to the private man, Thou shall not kill: but to the Magistrate he
says: Thine eye shall not spare: Thou shall not suffer the wicked Sorcerer to
live.

Not possible.
Look. Impossibility.

Not seen, etc.
Look. Happy.

Not chosen many.
Look. Chosen.

NOTHING.
The meaning of this place following.
ANd has nothing in me. Ioh. 14. 30
Satan has power over those that are subject to sin, for he works in the
children of disobedience. Therefore seeing the Lord was pure from all sin,
Satan had no power at all in him, etc. But if Satan had no power of Christ, why
then did he prevail so much, that he brought him to the death of the Cross?
For shortly after Christ died, and that the most shameful death of all other,
even y^ death of the Cross. Hear now the cause thereof, in these words of
our Savior following: But that the world may know I love the Father, that is
to say, therefore I will give place to the power of Satan, and deliver my self
into the hands of sinners, that the world may know I love the father. Marl.
fol. 498.

Satan shall assail me with all his force, but he shall not find that in me,
which he looks for: for I am that innocent Lamb without spot. Geneua.

NOVACIAN.
What the opinions were, which this man held.
NOuacian a Priest of Rome, fell from his order and called his sect Catharous,
that is, Puritans. He would not admit unto the Church, such as fell after
repentance. He was condemned by sundry notable men, and in sundry Counsels.
Eusebius. li. 6. ca. 42. He abhorred second marriage. Epip. haere. 59.

By what occasion the heresy of this Nouacian sprung.
About the year of Christ. 251. in Alexandria, Dionisius there Bishop was
cruelly tormented, and many other martired and put to death, all kinds of
pains were invented (...)constrain them to forsake their Religion^ by which
means, diverse for fear denied Christ, some before their pains, and some in
the time of their torments, of which many repenting, were after by y^ Council
of Cipriate, received into y^ Church. Of this occasion sprang the heresy of
Nouacian a Priest, who was the first Anabaptist in Rome, and allowed not
Priests marriage, and taught that they which had once forsaken their faith,
should not be received again to penance. Cooper.

When the heresy of Nouacian was condemned.
About the year of Christ. 254. Cornelius the. 20. Bishop of Rome, which
succeeded Fabian, condemned the heresy of Nouacius, concerning the perverse
doctrine of penance. For he taught that they which had received Baptime, and
fell into sin, could not come again to salvation: And with this error
brought he many to desperation, and spoiled the concord of the Church or
Congregation. Carrion.

Obedience.
The definition of Obedience.
WE may make a definition of Obedience by y^ very word it self, which is
called in Greek, Lakai. And is nothing else but a faithful submission of
mind, whereby the word, and will of the commander is obeyed, when both the
heart and ears be attent unto his words and will, and those things which be
commanded according to their ability be accomplished without any gain-saieng.
For true obedience must have not only an obedient hand, but a following will
also. Wherefore they cannot be counted for obedient, in whom the definition of
true obedience takes not place, such as they be, which do obey in fact only
without the ready will of mind, or else in word or ear only, without doing it
when they may. For when the thing cannot be done, the will to obey is reputed
for the doing. And so we say most commonly, that God accepts our good will in
steed of the fact. Musculus. fol. 479.

What is meant by obeing in this place following.
To obey is better then Offering, 1. Reg. 15. 22.
etc. To obey, what? Man's invention, man's dreams or traditions? Nay verily,
but GODS holy words, his blessed Commandments, yea, and to obey them, is
better then to offer Sacrifices, which yet was ordained and appointed by God
himself. How much better then is it, then our Offerings, which are invented
without any of Gods word, or any mention theroff made the whole Scripture
through Joseph. de antiq. li. 6. cap. 9. expresses Samuels saying in like
manner, but his words are too long to rehearse. T. M.

OBSERVING OF DAYS.
How the observing of days are reproved, and how they may be observed.
YE observe days and months, and times and years. Gal. 4. 10
By the days, he understands Sabboths and new Moons: by the months, the
first and seventh month: by the times, Whitsontide, Easter, and the feast of
Tabernacles: by the years he understands the years of Iubely or of
forgiveness. It is not meant, but that we may well keep certain days, not
that one is holier then another, but that we may have time to come together,
both to preach and to hear the word of God, offering with one accord, our
common supplications unto him. Sir. I. Cheek.

Ye observe days, as Sabboths and new Moons: ye observe months, as the first
and seventh month: ye observe times, as Easter, Whitsontide, the feast of
Tabernacles: ye observe years, as the Iubely, or year of forgiveness: which
beggarly Ceremonies are most pernicious to them which have received the sweet
liberty of the Gospel, and thrust them back into superstitious slavery.
Geneua.

Days are observed, least the rude multitude should diminish their faith. And
certain days are appointed for us to come together in. Not to the intent the
day should be more solemn or high, in which we gather together, but that great
joy may rise to us, of our beholding one another. D. Heynes.

OFFENSE.
Of three manner of offenses.
SOme kind of offenses are to be eschewed, which take their differences of
their causes. There is one kind of offense, that rises of evil doctrine, and
corrupting the doctrine of the Church. He y^ after this manner is an offense
unto others, follows the steps of the Devil his father, who overthrew the
first man and woman with this kind of stumbling block. Genesis 3. Another kind
of offense, is that which springs of evil manners, that is to wit, when other
folks regarding thee, do counterfaite thy evil conditions. He that on this
wise is an offense to man, builds up the kingdom of Satan, and overthrows
the kingdom of Christ. The third kind of offense, rises of the abuse of
things, which of their own nature are indifferent, which must be shunned, y^
the weak be not offended: The wilful and ungodly, are to be despised, and for
warrant thereof, we have Christ's example.

Of an offense given, and an offense taken.
An offense is given then, when by thy fault, by thy importunity I say, and
thy lightness, thou either do or say a thing, for which thy brother has a
cause to be offended. The other offense is not given, but taken or picked out,
not by thy faults, but by the works or wickedness of another man: As for
example: when thou do sin neither in word nor deed, when thy deeds are
nothing insolent, nor thy words unseasonable, when thou say or do the
thing that is free and lawful for thee to say and do, and yet another takes
Pepper in nose, and is offended with that liberty of thine. Which is all one,
as if a man that walks in a plain path should ^ap to trip or stumble, and
presently quarrel with his companion, as though he had laid a block in his
way. Bullinger. fo. 451.

To give offense is a great sin. For Christ does say, Woe unto the world
because of offenses. It must needs be that offenses come, but woe to the man
by whom the offense comes. Whosoever offends one of these little ones, etc.
Saint Paul also speaking to the brethren that give offense, says: Through
thy giving of offense, perishes thy brother, for whom Christ died, and so ye
sinning against your brethren, and wounding their weak consciences, do sin
against Christ himself. Bullinger. fol. 452.

What it is to be offended in Christ.
Happy is he, that is not offended by me. To be offended in Christ, is to will
neither to know Christ, nor yet to believe in him. And not to be offended in
him, is to receive him, and knowledge by a perfect faith, that he is our
Savior.

Happy is he, etc. That take no occasion by Christ to be hindered from the
Gospel. Geneua.

How a man may offend God, and not his own conscience.
When Paul and Barnabas (men elect to be Apostles by the reuealation of the
holy Ghost, as it is written in the second of the Acts) fell out one with
another for John Mark (as it is in the 15. of the Acts) insomuch as the one
forsook the others company: it cannot be denied, but either Paul, or
Barnabas, or both, were in a great fault to fall out for such a trifle, and yet
there was neither of them both, but he thought in his conscience that he did
well, and did contend for the glory of God. So undoubtedly, the most
circumspect men in their living and most studious to do all their works, and
to utter all their words to the glory of God: yet oftentimes they shall
conceive in their thoughts, wish in their hearts, and also speak and do such
things, as shall be very great sins in the sight of God, and yet they shall
not offend their conscience, nor think they do amiss. And therefore the
Prophet David desires almighty God not only to forgive him all such and
secret hid sins, wherein he had offended the most pure and perfect law of
God, but also he desires him utterly to pourge him of all his secret and
subtle sins, saying: Ab occultis meis munda me: unto this place of the
Prophet, seems the saying of Saint Paul to agree very well, when he says:
Nihil mihi conscius sum. sed non in hoc iustificatus sum. Mine own conscience
accuses me of no fault, and yet I am not because of that justified before God,
for we sin upon a good intent, and so by ignorance commit great offense
against God. In all such cases, a man offends not his own conscience, and
yet he offends God. Ric. Turnar.

OFFERINGS.
What Offerings did signify unto the people.
THe Offerings were signs, and did certefie a man that God was at one with
him, and was his friend and loved him. For the fat of the beast was offered and
wine thereto, as though God had sat and eat and drunk with them, and the
rest, they and their households did eat before God, as though they had eaten
and dronken with God, and were commanded to be merry and to make good cheer,
full certified that God was at one with them, and had forgotten all old
offenses, and now loved them, that he would fulfill all his promises of mercy
with them. Tindale.

OIL.
What Oil does signify in this place following.
ANd make of them holy annoynting Oil. Ex. 30. 25
This holy annoynting Oil does figure the virtue of the Holy ghost, declared
or showed by the word of God, and descending down, first on the head of Aaron
which is Christ, and consequently upon the Apostles, and all the faithful. As
Psalm. 133. 2. T. M

With my holy Oil have I anointed him. Psa. 89. 20
By the holy Oil, is understood the holy Ghost, the grace, the mercy, and
word of God, by the which the soul is refreshed, and delivered from pain to
spiritual joy. Geneua.

Is like the Oil that runs upon the head, etc. Psa. 133. 2
The ointment was a figure of the graces, which came from Christ the head unto
the Church. Geneua.

What the Oil of gladness is.
The Oil of gladness, is the gift of the spirit of God, gladness to our
selves, because it fills us with joy in the Lord, and gladness to other,
because it powers grace into our lips, to comfort the weak hearted, and to
make us a sweet savor of life unto life, to all that hearken unto us. Deering.

Thy God has anointed thee with the Oil of gladness. Psa. 45. 7
Has established thy kingdom as the figure of Christ which is the peace and
joy of the Church.

Of the Oil that Saint James speaks off.
Annoint him with Oil in the name of the Lord. Iam. 5. 14.
Among those Nations unto which S. James wrote this Epistle, it was the manner
to annoint their body with Oil, which thing Christ commands his Apostle to
do. And Oil is to many diseases, as a wholesome medicine. We, where such
annoynting is not used, may under the name of Oil understand the Office and
duty of Charity, in ministering unto the sick, such things as he needs.
Tindale.

Oil was much used in Palestina, and was counted medicinable. Mark. 6. 13.
Luke. 10. 34. Therefore where the Apostles does command that Elders should
annoint with Oil, the bodies of the sick, his meaning is, that they shall in
no wise despise those means that God has appointed, naturally to be used, for
the healing of the sick. Sir. I. Cheek.

The Oil that S. James speaks of, was not a necessary Sacrament of the
Church to continue for ever, but it was a miraculous gift of healing, lasting
for the time, like as other miracles did. Jewel.

And they anointed many with Oil that were sick, Mar. 6. 13
and healed them. This oil was a sign of this miraculous working, and not a
medicine to heal diseases: so that the gift of miracles ceasing, the
ceremony is to no use.

How the Oil that the Papists do use, came not from the Apostles.
The Apostles in old time gave the Holy ghost by laieng on of hands, Pauor. de
cons. ca. 5
but now a days because Bishops he not so holy, order has been taken, that
they should give this Sacrament with Chrisme. Jewel.

Extreme unction (as they term it) was that Ceremony which the Apostles,
used oftentimes when they healed the sick, annoynting the^ with Oil. For as
they laid their hands upon those whom they baptized, giving to them the Holy
ghost visibly: so likewise when they healed any sick man, they did eftsoons
anoint him with Oil, to signify unto him, from whence the gift of health did
come, that is, from the Holy ghost. F. N. B. the Italian.

How the Oil is compared to the bread in the Sacrament.
Cyrillus Cyrillus
writing of the Oil, says thus: Beware thou think not this to be Oil only.
For as the bread of the Sacrament, after the invocation of the Holy ghost, is
no longer common bread, but the body of Christ: so this holy Oil is no longer
bare or common Oil, but it is the grace of Christ. By these words there
appears like change in the Oil and bread: For as the Oil is the grace of
God, so is the bread the body of Christ: and as the nature and substance of
the Oil remains still, although it be not bare or common oil, so the nature
and substance of bread remains still, although it be not common or bare
bread.

OLD MAN.
What is understood by our old man.
KNowing this that our old man is crucified with him. Romans 6. 6
By the old man he understands our natural disposition, that we have of our
first parents, which is slow to virtue, but most prone and ready to sin. It
is also called the body of sin. Sir. I. Cheek.

Old wine.
Look. Wine.

ONELT FAITH.
How only faith justifies proved by the Doctors.
SAint Ambrose says: They are justified freely, because working nothing, Ambr.
in Epist. ad Romans ca 4
and requiting nothing, they are justified by only says through the gift of
God. Again, he says in the same place. This was Gods determination, that the
law surcea^^ the grace of God should require only faith unto salvation.
Again he says. Romans cap. 9. Only faith is laid or appointed for salvation.

He knows himself to be void of true righteousness, Basil. de humil.
and to be justified by only faith in Christ.

Theodorus says, Theodoretus.
Not by any works of ours, but by only ^aith, he have got the mystical good
things.

Origin says, Origin
Where is now thy boasting (of thy good works) it is shut out: Paul says, that
the justification of only faith justifies: so that all men only believing
may be justified, although he have done no good works at all.

Chrysostom says: Chriso in Epist. ad Gal. ca. 3.
(they said) Who so stays himself by only faith is accursed. Contrariwise
Saint Paul says, that whosoever stays himself by only faith, he is
blessed.

They be manifestly blessed whose wickedness be forgiven, Ambr. in Epist. ad
Romans ca 4
without any labor or work: and their sins hidden, without any works of
repentance sought of them, but only that they must believe.

Arbitramur hominem iustificari absque operibus legis. Tho. aq. super To. cap 3^
We being taught of Christ think (says Thomas) according to the truth of the
Apostle, that every man, whether he be Ie^, or Gentile, is justified by faith.
Act. 15. 19. By faith purifieng their hearts, and that without the works of
the law. And that not only without the Ceremonial works, which did not give
grace, but also without the works of the Moral commandments, according to
that saying of Titus. 3. ver. 5. Not of the works of the righteousness, that
we have wrought. The reason is presumed that we are saved for our merits, the
which he excludes when he says, Not of the works of the righteousness,
which we have done: but the true reason is, the only mercy of God. There is
not therefore in them the hope of iustifitation, Sed in sola fide, but in faith
only. Works are not the cause that any body is just before God, but they are
rather the executions and the ministering of righteousness. In this point
(though he swerve from the truth in many other points) he speaks right. I.
Bridges. fol. 143.

Our Adversaries, Musculus
when they do teach that the justifying of us does not consist in faith only,
but in works also, what do they else, but obscure the glory of Gods grace, and
extol the merit of our works. They do not way that it is necessary, that
our justifying do consist in faith only, for as much as it is bestowed
freely. If they cannot abide the word only, or alone, let him leave it, and
use this word freely. For in case we be justified freely by faith, as the
Apostle does testify, it must needs follow, that we be not justified by
faith and works, but by faith only. If it be not by faith only, but by works
withal, then is it not freely, but of duty. If it be of duty and not
freely, then there is no glory of Gods grace at all. Musculus, fol. 229.

ONE.
Of one Mediator.
Look. Mediator.

What the Prophet Ose does mean by one head.
THen shall the Children of Judah, Ose. 1. 1^
and the Children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one
head. To wit after the captivity of Babylon, when the Jews were restored; but
chief this is referred to the time of Christ, who should be the head, both of
the Jews and Gentiles. Geneua.

The number of the Children of Israel, shall be as the sand of the Sea shore,
that cannot be numbered: And it shall come to pass in the place, where it was
said unto them: Ye are no people of mine, there shall it be said unto them, ye
are the children of the living God. And the Children of Judah and the Children
of Israel shall assemble together, and shall appoint to themselves one head.
Upon which words S. Hierom writes thus: All these things shall come to pass,
because it is the great day of the seed of God, which seed is expounded (not
the Pope, but) Christ.

There shall assemble together the Children of Judah, Nic. Lyra. in Os. ca. 1
that is to say, the Apostles: and the Children of Israel, that is to say, the
Heathen converted: together, that is to say, in one Church: and shall appoint
unto themselves, one head, that is to say (not one Pope, but) one Christ.
Jewel. fol. 101.

Let us remember (says Augustine) the corner stone (that is Christ and not the
Pope) and the two walls, Augu. de Ciui. Dei. li. 18. ca. 2^
the one of the Jews, and the other of the Heathen. Jewel. fol. 101.

Of one Sheepefold.
And there shall be one Sheepefold. Ioh. 10. 16
When the Gentiles have received the Evangelical faith, they shall be associate
and joined to the faithful people of the Jews, and so of them both there
shall be one fold, that is, of the Jews and Gentiles, there shall be one
Church: One God (says Paul) one Faith, and one Baptime? Therefore we must be
one, even as we are called into one hope, etc. They which gather upon this
place, that there shall be a mutual consent and agreement among men in the
whole world, insomuch as none shall remain as In^^dell or ungodly, do err
and know not the Scriptures, neither do consider what is the state and drift
of this place. Again, there are some which gather of this place, that after the
last day of Judgment, all both good and bad, shall be gathered into one place
of eternal life. But the opinion of those men is most foolish. For then shall
the Sheep be separated from the Goats, and the judgment of the Sheep shall be
one, and the judgment of the Goats another, as the Scripture plainly
testifies. Mar^. upon John. fol. 374.

Of one Spirit.
He that cleaneth unto God, 1. Cor. 6. 12
is one spirit with him.

Nico. Lyra upon this place says: V^us non secundum rem, etc. One spirit with
God not one in deed but one in love, or according to affection. So that we are
united unto God, by faith and love and none otherwise.

ORACLE.
What an Oracle is.
AN Oracle is properly the mind and answer of God, by some divine
Interpreter declared, as by some Prophet, Priest, or otherwise by man.

ORIGENIANI.
Of whom these Heretics bare their name.
ORigeniani were Heretics called after a^e Origin (not he that was the great
Cleark of Alexandria) they condemned marriage, yet lived they beastly, their
manner was to have among them religious women like Nuns, whom they de^^led,
yet used means to keep them from swelling. Epiph. haer. 63.

Of the Heretics that sprang of the learned Origin.
Origeniani again were Heretics, which so called themselves of Origin
Adamantius the great Clearke of Alexandria, they taught as Epiphan. says (
haeres. 64.) that there was no resurrection, that Christ was a creature, and
the Holy ghost a like, that the souls were first in heaven, and came down
into the bodies, as it were into prison, that in the end, the devils should be
saved. Epiphanius as I read in Socrates (Eccl. hist. li. 6. ca. 11.) was become
the enemy of Origin, through the spite and malice of Theophilus, Bishop of
Alexandria. The devil bare Origin a displesure, he procured heretics to
father upon him lewd opinions. He complains himself in a certain Epistle,
how that Heretics corrupted his works. Pamphilus Martyr the great friend and
familiar of Eusebius wrote an Apology in his behalf. Eusebius (li. 6. ca. 3.
18. 20. 26.) reports of the famous men that favored Origin. Socrates (Eccle.
histor. lib. 6. cap. 12.) writes in his commendation. Athanasius gave of him a
notable testimony. Chrysostom would in no wise be brought to condemn either
Origin or his works. Socrates li. 6. cap. 11. 12. 13.

ORIGINAL SIN.
That no man is without original sin.
THe death of our Lord Jesus Christ the son of God, Augustine
is a mighty remedy against the wound of original sin wherewith the nature
of all men is (in Adam) corrupt and slain, and from whence the infection of
all concupiscence has sprung. Augustine in the Articles falsely imputed unto
him, the first Article.

All men were in the first man, Ambrose
created without sin, and all by the transgression of the same man, have lost
the freedom of our nature, from thence we took the manifold corruption both
of body and soul, from thence, ignorance and dullness has ensued, etc. Ambr.
in his 1. book and 3 Chapter of the calling of the Gentiles.

In the law it is commanded, Origin
that for him that is borne, a pair of Turtles or young Pigeons should be
offered, of the which, the one should be for a sin Offering and the other for
a burnt Offering: For what sin is this one Pigeon offered? Could this newborn child sin? Yea, even then he has sin, for the which he is commanded
to offer a sin Offering from the which there is no man clean, and though he
be but one day old. Origin in his 5. book and 6. chap. upon the Romans

No man lives here upon earth without sin. Hierom
Hiero. in his 29. Epistle.

There shall be no judgment without mercy, Basil
for because there can no man living, be found clean without filthiness, no
though he were but one day old from his birth. Basil. upon the 32. Psalm.

No man is clean from filthiness: no, Barnard
not an Infant of a day old, has a clean life here upon earth. Barnard in
his second sermon upon the first Sunday after the Epiphany.

OATH.
What an Oath is.
AN Oath is the calling or taking to witness of Gods name, to confirm the
truth of that we say, etc. Bullinger. fol. 132.

An Oath is a way or mean, whereby contreuersies are ended, and promises
performed, by the calling upon the name of God. For it is written in the Law,
If a man deliver unto his neighbor, Ox, or Ass, or Sheep to pasture, and it
dye or be hurt, or driven away (no man seeing it) then shall an Oath of the Lord
go between them, and he shall swear whether he has put any hand to the
taking away of his neighbors goods or not. And the owner of the goods shall
receive the Oath. And if he by the Oath that he has taken says, that he has
put no hand to it, then shall he not make it good, etc. And this must be done
before the Gods, that is to say, before the Judges and Magistrates.

An Oath is also a mean whereby promises are performed, as in Genesis 21. where
Abraham swear to Abimelch y^ he would neither hurt him nor his posterity, and
performed it indeed.

How an Oath is lawful.
Lawful it is for the Magistrate, when they put any man in office, to take an
Oath of him, that he shall be true, diligent, and faithful therein, as Jacob
for the commodity and profit of his posterity, took an Oath of Laban the
Idolater. Likewise Judas Machabeus of the Romans for the same purpose. Also
Princes may demand an Oath of their Subjects and Commons, for the sauegard of
their lands and people. But they that swear must have these properties, They
being required of the Magistrate, must swear truly, minding neither fraud or
deceit, but witness only the truth, seeking no parcialitie but the truth,
not themselves, but the glory of God, the profit of of their neighbor, and
the Common wealth of GODS people.

How an Oath is damnable.
To swear to do evil, as to slaye, to ravish, or to rob, is damnable
without fail, and to perform such an Oath, or to do those wickednesses
indeed, is a double damnation, both to him that so swears, and also to the
Judge that causes him to swear. Mat. 14. 9.
Such an Oath was the cursed Oath that King Herod made unto the Daughter of
Herodias his harlot, for the head of holy John Baptist, whom Christ calls a
wily Fox for his crafty conueyaunce. A color was this Oath of his cruel
Tyranny, and a cloak to his most spiteful murder. For through that means was
John done to death. Neither was an Oath ordained after the mind of Saint
Austen, Augu, ad Seuerum Milenita.
to bind the perfourmaunce of manslaughter, robbery, Idolatry, or other
sins. Rather had David break his Oath, then to fulfill it with bloudshedding.

Whereas David did not by shedding of blood perform his promise bound with an
Oath, 1. Reg. 25. 31.
therein his godliness was the greater. David swear rashly, but upon better and
godly advise, he performed not the thing he had sworn. By this and by like it
is declared, that many Oaths are not to be observed. Now, he that swears so,
does sin, but in changing his Oath, he does very well. He that changes not
such an oath, commits a double sin: First, for swearing as he ought not,
and then for doing that he should not. Bullinger. fol. 134.

How wicked Oaths and vows are to be broken.
Oaths are to be observed, when their end is not evil, nor to the hinderaunce
of souls health. In which promises (says Isidore) let faithfulness have
place. In filthy vows, change thy decreed purpose. Do not the thing in
effect that thou have without consideration sworn unto, for the promise is
evermore wicked, that cannot be done without sin. Therefore if the Judges or
Rulers, should enforce the inferior subject to swear to the things that were
against souls health or Gods honor, as to worship an Idol, or to an Innocents
undoing, they ought rather to dye, then to obey: as did Eleazarus, with the
seven faithful brethren and their mother in the Machabees, for much better it
is (says Saint Peter) in such a cause to obey God then man.

Of Herodes wicked Oath.
Nevertheless for his Oath sake, etc. Mat. 14. 9.
Better it is otherwhises to forswere himself, then to do any ungodly thing.
This deed of Herod, can in no wise be excused, for if she had asked his own
head, or her mothers head, he would not have granted her. Sir. I. Cheek.

How Oaths first began.
When the Law of natural love (which God had inwardly written in the hearts
of men) remained among the good fathers, Adam, Seth, Enoch, Noe, Abraham,
Moses, and other godly men, then was no swearing, but every man did unto his
neighbor, as he would his neighbor should do unto him. But when the wicked,
as Cain, the filthy Giaunts, Nymroth, Cham, and such like, began to increase
in the land, they contrariwise (for want of that rule) fell into all manner of
abominable sins, so that daily more and more great mischiefs increased.
And as Ose the Prophette complains, there was no faithfulness, no brotherly
love, no truth among men, but bitterness, lieng, manslaughter, theft, and
adultery has gotten the over hand: In their daily occupieng was much falsehood
used, and that was thought well won good, that was gotten by deceit. Uery
seldom in their bargaining were promises performed, and more seldom a great
deal, was faithful honesty regarded. In process of time therefore, were very
few or none believed, unless they took God to witness that the matter was
true. Wherepon first of all came up the swearing of Oaths among men, to
confirm their saying with.

Look. Swearing.

OTHONIEL.
How he was called the brother of Caleb.
THis Othoniel was, Iudic. 1. 13
called Calebs brother, to whom Caleb gave Achsa his daughter to wife for
winning of Kari^h Sepliar, that is the City of letters: which kind of
marriage was forbidden by the law of Moses. Leuit. 18. Therefore Othoniel did
contrary to the law to marry his brothers daughter. To this it is said, that
Othoniel was the natural son of Kenes, which Kenes was brother to Caleb,
which was the natural son of Iephune. Now when Iephune the father of Caleb was
dead, Kenes married his mother, which afterward had the charge of Caleb in
bringing him up, wherefore Caleb (notwithstanding he was the natural son of
Iephune) was called the son of Kenes, as in Joshua. 14. 6. So that Othoniel was
Calebs nephew, and might therefore marry his daughter by the law. Othoniel is
here none otherwise called the brother of Caleb, but as Loath was called the
brother of Abraham, which indeed was Abraham's brother son. As in Genesis 13. 8.
Lyra.

OWN.
Why Christ calls the people of the Jews his own.
HE came in to his own. John. 1. 11.
The Jews were called Gods peculiar people, because that although all Nations
are his, yet of his only mercy he chose them, to whom he would commit his
holy word and Sacraments, and among whom, he would have an open face of his
Church. In this place S. John calls them not his own, because they were his
chosen, but because they bare the name of his people, and the title of his
Church. Traheron.

OX.
Of the Ox that treads out the corn.
NON alligabis os bouis triturantis in acca fruges tuas. 1. Cor. 9. 9.
Israel, thou shall not mosell the Ox that treads out the corn in the flore
of the barn, but forasmuch as he treads, and as I might say, thresheth out
the Wheat, so let him eat of the best, and mosell him not. Now this
proposition being spoken literally of the liberty that husbandmen ought to
show to their threshing Oxen, Saint Paul does draw this proposition to an
allegory sense: for where he had given a commandment to the lay brethren to
be courteous and liberal to all them that did look dilligently, and took
pains to teach and to instruct the congregation, he rendereth as it were a
cause of this his precept and law, by this place of the Scripture: Dicit non
Scriptura: Non alligabis os boui trituranti. Thou shall not mosell the Ox that
treads out thy corn: understanding by the Ox, the Minister of Gods
mysteries. It cannot be denied now but this sentence: Non alligabis os boui
trituranti, was first spoken of the Ox that took pains for the profit of the
husbandman. Seeing then God would the Ox to live of his labors? How much more
then by all right and reason behooves it them to live liberally in this world,
by whose pains other men do live everlastingly in the world to come: So that
the allegory of this proposition, Non alligabis, has a pretty quick and a
vehement kind of probation, to the purpose that Saint Paul went about, more
then the text spoke plainly, which is this: That the Ministers of spiritual
things, ought of duty to reap temporal things. Ric. Turnar.

Patience.
What true patience is.
THat which the latin Interpreters of the holy Scriptures have translated
Patience, is in the Hebrew as much to say, as far from anger: as we may
perceive in the Proverbs, and in Ecclesiastes. In the Greek it is called
Nouollone, which signifies sufferance and patience. Cicero in his book De
inuencione, makes a difference between perseueraunce and patience: And
defines perseverance to be a steadfast and continual abiding in a matter well
considered and weighed, and patience to be a willing and long sufferaunce of
hard and painful things for honesties sake and profit. So that
perseueraunts is the general virtue, whereby we do constantly abide and
proceed in all that which we have begun, upon some good reason. And that
Patience is a kind of perseueraunce, when we do willingly and constantly
suffer things that be hard, painful, sorrowful, and to our loss. I do
not mislike this definition of Cicero. For every suffering of adversity ought
not straight to be called Patience: for there is no man in the world but that
he suffers many things, which he would not do, if he could any wise
withstand it: and yet we do not call them all patience, like as we do not
call them impatient neither, which do suffer no adversity, but do sustain
it with evil will and discontented mind. Therefore like as unto patience,
there is requisite a willinge sufferaunce, so it is vnpatiencie, when we do
vnwillinglye, striving and with anger suffer that which we do suffer. And he
did upon a good consideration put in the definition of patience not only the
willing, but the long sufferaunce also of evils, for the virtue of patience
consists not only in this, if the sufferaunce be willing but there is
requisite also a constancye in suffering. You shall find many that be willing
to suffer for a while, but they be soon gone, and become impatient, unto them
cannot be attributed true patience, which is of that sort that it must be
both willing and continual. Like as the faith of them which do believe for a
time, and do shrink away at time of temptation, is not true faith: nor their
love true, which do love to day, and hate to morrow, so it is no true
patience neither, if thou be patient for a season, and within a while after do
change thy patience into impatiencie. The truth of virtues cannot stand
without constancy. Musculus. fo. 522,

This word patience or patientnesse, betokens not that men should become
blockish, so as they should have no heaviness at all, nor be combred with any
grief when they feel adversity, but the virtue is when they can moderate
themselves, and hold such a measure, as they cease not to glorify God in the
midst of all their miseries, nor be so ouercompred and swallowed up with
sorrow and anguish, as to quail altogether, but fight against their own
passions, until they may be able to frame themselves to the good will of God,
and to say (as Job does) that he is righteous in all respects. Calvin in Job.
fol. 29.

How we ought to be patient under the Cross.
With your patience, possess your souls. The soul is possessed that it
perish not, but is saved by patience, if it through faith in Christ, do
patiently suffer in adversity. Tindale.

Those possess their souls in patience, unto whom God gives a joyful mind
under the cross, even unto the end. The Bible note.

Possess your souls, that is, live joyfully and blessedly, even under the
cross. Geneua.

PAINTED WALL.
How this place following is understood.
GOD smite thee thou Painted w^^l. Act. 13. 3.
By a figurative speech, we call him a Painted wall which pretends himself
to be one thing, and is an other. As if a man should in countenance and
iesture make an outward show of righteousness, whereas inwardly he is full of
all iniquity, rapine, and filthy covetousness. Sir. I. Cheek.

Saint Paul does not curse the high Priest, but denounce sharply the
punishment of God which should light upon him, in the way of prophesieng.
Geneua.

Of the painting of the virgin Mary, and of Christ.
Some say that Saint Luke did paint first the Image of the virgin Mary, and
did set it forth with lively couloures, and that Nichodemus (who came unto
our Savior Christ by night) had the Image of Christ being crucified.

And that also Agbarus the king of Edessenes did send a Painter to Christ to
bring his Image to him, and when he could not do it, because of the
exceeding great brightness of his face, Christ himself took his cloth, that
he would have painted him on, and did wipe his face therewith, and so gave him
in the cloth, a lively Image, or resemblaunce of his face, sending it to
Agbarus, who was desirous of it. The like say they did happen unto the Veronike
when she did reach her fine cloth unto our savior Christ to dry his face with
all, that did run full of sweat. All these things they father upon
Athanasius, which is most false and untrue. First, as touching S. Luke, it is
not in Scripture that ever he was a Painter, but that he was a Physician,
Scripture makes mention. And being a Physician for the body, he was afterward
called to be a Physician for ye soul. And because that Luke of all other the
Evangelists did set forth most lively the strong faith, humility and
lowliness, and al other heavenly virtues of the blessed virgin Mary: Some did
affirm that Luke painted out the virgin Marie. And as for the story of
Agbarus and of the Veronike, if any such things had been done or wrought, the
Evangelists would as well have set that forth as they did other things of
smaller importance. They wrote of the Hem of Christ's garment: but not a word
of this marvelous Image of Christ's face. Therefore such vain and fond
histories ought in no wise to be credited. I. Veron.

PARADISE.
The meaning of this place following.
HOw that he was taken up into Paradise. 2. Cor 12. 4
So the Grecians name that which we call a Park, that is to say, a place where
trees are planted, and wild beasts kept. By which name they that translated
the old Testament out of Hebrew into Greek, called the Garden, whereinto Adam
was put straight after his creation, as a most del^^able and pleasant place.
And heervpon grew it, that the blessed seat of the glory of God, is called by
that name. Beza.

The felicity of Paradise described by Saint Austen.
Man lived in Paradise as he would, so long as he willed that God commanded,
he lived having the fruition of God, of whom came his gooddesse. He lived
wanting nothing, having in his power withal to live continually. Meat was
ever ready, and at hand, because he should not be hungry, and drink, for that
he should not thirst: And tree of life, that age should not ^onsume and end his
life. No corruption was there^ neither in his body, or came of his body^ which
was to the loathsomenesse and (...) He feared neithe^ inward disease, nor
outward (...). (...) his flesh was perfect health, and in every part of his
soul, no less tranquillity and quietness. As in Paradise no grief was felt
through heat or cold. So likewise to the inhabiters there of happened there
nothing through unlawful destra, or fear, that might be unto the impeachment
of his good and god^y^^^ lived (...) In him was there no fo^^ co^fulne^^^ at
(...) nor yet any (...) gladness, true joy was in him continued by God^
toward whom there issued a burning (...) not of a p^^e heart, a good conscience,
and an vnfei^ed (...) the ^an^^ the woman, there was (...) proceeding of
virtuous and (...) watching of mind and body, and finally keeping of Gods
(...) without grief or grudging, (...) wit, y^ of all y^ trees in paradise he
might lawfully eat, so that he absteined from the tree of the knowledge of
good and built. He thereto Saint Austen.

PARADOX.
What Paradox i^.
PAradox is a strange sentence, contrary to the opinion of the most part^ Or
thus^ It is a strange sentence, not easily to be conceived of the common sort.
Pet. Mar. fo. 284.

PARAPHRASE.
What Paraphrase is.
PAraphrase, is a plain setting forth of a text or sentence more at large,
with such^ circumstaunce of more or other words, as may make the sentence open,
clear, plain, familyar, which other wise should perchance seem bare,
unfruitful, hard, strange, rough, obscure, and dark to be understood of any
that were either unlearned, or but meanly lettered^ Vdal.

PARDONS.
Of the Bishop of Romes forged Pardons.
THe Papists call the treasure of the Church the merits of Christ, and of the
holy^ Apostles and Martirs. The pri^c^^all custody of this ^arne, (as I have
already^ touched) they ^aine to be delivered to the Bishop of Rome, that he
should have the distributio^ of so great^ gifts, that he might both give them
himself, and also grant jurisdiction to other to give them. Here upon
proceed (...) the Pope some time pleu^rie pardons, some pardons (...) certain
years. From the Cardinals, pardons for an hundred days: from Bishops, pardons
for forty days. But they ^e (as I ^ay naturally describe the^) the profaning
of the blood of Christ, Satan's mockery, to (...) away the Christen people from
she grace of God, from the life that is in Christ, and to (...) from the true
way of salvation, for how could the blood of Christ be more filthely profaned,
then when it is deuied to suffice to the remission of sins, to reconciliation
and satisfaction, unless the want thereof, as being withered (...) wasted,
should be other wise supplied and profited. Act. 10. 43.
The Law and the Prophts (says Peter) bear witness of (...) I ^ (...) that^
by him for giuenesse of sins is to be received. (...) give remission of
sins, by Peter, Paul, and the Martirs. The blood of Christ (says John 1.
John. 1 7.
) cleanses us from sin. Pardons do make the blood of Martirs, the washing
away of sins, Christ (says Paul) which knew not sin, 2. Cor. 5. 21
was made sin for us, that is, the satisfaction of sin, that we might be
made the righteousness of God by him: Pardons do set the satisfaction of
sins in the blood of Martirs. 1. Cor. 1. 13
Paul cried out and testified to the Corinthians, that only Christ was
crucified and dyed for us: Pardons pronounce that Paul and other dyed for us.
In an other place he says. Act. 20. 28
That Christ purchased the Church with his blood: The Pardons appoint an other
price of purchase in the blood of Martyrs. Heb 10. 14
The Apostle says, that Christ with one oblation made perfect for ever them
that were sanctified. The Pardons cry out to the contrary, and say, that
satifaction is made perfectly the blood of Martyrs, which otherwise were not
sufficient John says that all the Saints washed their garments in the blood of
the Lamb: Apoc. 7. 14
The Pardons teach men to wash their garments in the blood of Saints.

Leo Bishop of Rome, Epist. 8 ^.
writes notablye well to the Padestines against these Sacri^edges. Psa. 16.
Although (says he) the death of many. ver. 15.
Saints has been precious in the ^ight of the Lord, yet the killing of no
innocent has been the perpetuation of the world. The righteous received but
gave no Crowns: and out of the valiantness of the faithful, are grave
examples of patience, not gifts of righteousness, for their death it were
every one singular to themselves, and none of them did by his end pay the
debt of an other, for as much as there is one Lord Christ, in whom all are
crucified, all are dead, buried, and raised up again. Which sentence (as it
was worthy to be remembered) he repeated in an other place.

Saint Austen Augustine.
speaks no less fitlye to the same effect. Though (faith he) we bye
brethren, for brethren, yet the blood of no Martyrs is shed for the
forgiveness of sins Which thing Christ has done for us, that we should
follow him, but has given us a thing to rejoice upon.

Again in an other place, As only the son of GOD, was made the son of man
to make us with him the sons of GOD: So he alone for us has taken: upon
him punishment without evil deserninges, that we by him might without good
deseruings obtain grace not due unto us. Calvin is his Institu. 3. (...)
chap. 5. Sect. 2. and. 3.

Pardons are not known unto us by the authority of the Scriptures, Siluester
prierias in his book against Luther.
but by the authority of the Church of Rome and of the Popes, which is greater
then the authority of the Scriptures. O blasphemous mouth so to say. I. N.

Thus I answer: Rusensus in his bo, against Luther.
It cannot well appear from whom Pardons first begun: Among the old
Doctoure and Fathers of the Church, there was either no talk at all, or very
little talk of Purgatory. But as long as Purgatory was not cared for, there
was no man that sought for Pardons, for the whole price of Pardons hangs
upon Purgatory, take away Purgatorye^ and what shall we need of Pardons?
Pardons began when folks were afraid of the pains of Purgatory. I. N.

There is nothing in the Scripture less opened, or whereof the olds learned
fathers have less written, then Pardons. Of Pardons there is no mention.
Alphe. de Castro in his 8. book or Pardons.

Look. Purgatory.

PASSOVER.
How the Lamb was called the passover.
FOr it is the Lords passover. Ex^. 12. 11
The (...) was called the passover, that the very name it self should keep
in memory what was signified thereby, which phrase and manner of speaking the
Scripture uses often, calling the sign by the name of the thing that is
signified. As Genesis 16. b. T. M.

The Lamb was not the passover but signified it: As the Sacraments are not
the thing it self which they do represent, but signify it. Geneua.

This was the passover of the Jews, but our paschall Lamb is Christ, as
witnesses Saint Paul. 1. Co^. 5. 7. The Bible note.

What the passover was.
The passover was an holy action ordained by God in the killing and eating of
a Lamb, partly to the end that the Church might keep in memory the benefit
which God did for them in the land of Egypt, to be a testimony of Gods good
will toward the faithful, to be a tipe of Christ, and part^ye also togather
all the p^r takers thereof, into the fellowship of one body and to put them in
mind to be thankful and innocent. Bullinger. fol. 362.

And they ^^ue the passover. The Scripture uses in sundry places to call the
Lamb, ^. Par. 35. 1
the passover, which was but the sign of the passover. Because in all
Sacraments y^ signs have the names of the things signified.

How this place following is understood.
There was no passover holden like that (which Josias held) from the days of
the Judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and
the kings of Judah. This is onel^ spoken in the respect of the multitude, and
zeal of the people ^^ith the great preparation, and not because the passover
was not all th^^ time celebrated. D. Whitegift. fol. 9.

Of the passover, offering of the clean, and unclean.
If a man be clean and not let in a journey, Nu. 9. 10.
and yet was negligent to offer passover, the same soul shall perish from his
people, etc. In like manner it is with us in our spiritual Easter or
passover, whosoever does not reverently believe the redemption of mankind,
which was thoroughly finished in the true lamb Christ, and amendeth not his
life, nor turns from vice to virtue in the time of this mortal life, shall
not belong unto the glory of the resurrection, which shall be given to the^
true worshippers of Christ, but shall be rooted out from the company of the
Saints. T. M.

PASSION.
What a passion is.
Whatsoever moves the mind in an ungodly desire is called a passion, as
malice, rancour, ire, envy, ambition, covetousness, lechery, pride, hatred,
study of praise, study of enuieng, and such other, which stir akd move the
mind out of his natural rest, to love or to hate without reason and measure:
As when a body suffers any torment, we say, we be in a passion: So when our
mind suffers any such inordinate desire, we have the minds passion: And
every such motion of mind out of his due course, is called a passion. Lupset.

What is now the passions and sufferings of Christ.
Now joy I in my sufferings which I suffer for you, Coll. 1. 24.
and fulfill that which is behind of the passions of Christ in my flesh, etc.
Passions and sufferings of Christ, is the passions which we must suffer for his
sake, for we have professed and are appointed to suffer with Christ. John. 20.
21. As my Father sent me, so send I you. Tindale.

As Christ has once suffered in himself to redeem his Church, and to
sanctify it: so does daily suffer in his members, as pertakers of their
infirmities, and therefore a revenger of their injuries. Geneua.

PASTOR.
Who are pastors and Shepherds.
PAstors or Shepherds are such as being endued with a singular gift, know how
to feed Christ's hungry sheep with his healthful word, as with most pleasant
pasture, how to heal them that be attainted: how to bring back them y^ be
astray, and to keep away the wolves from the Lords flock. These have some
certain flock committed to their charge, which is the mark whereby they be
discerned from the other before. And concerning these, there be diverse things
written by the Prophets, and specially by Ezec. 34. 1. and also by John. 10.
11. 21. 15. And in the Act. 20. 28. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 259.

Look. Shepherd.

PATERNIANI.
What the opinions of these heretics were.
PAterniani were heretics Heretics.
which thought that the nether parts of man's body were made not by God, but
by the devil, and therefore yielded all those parts unto all beastly life.
Some called those men Venustianos. August.

PATHMOS.
What Pathmos is.
WAs in the I Will of Pathmos. Apoc. 1. ^.
Pathmos is one of the Isles of Sporas, whether John was banished, as some write.

PATRICIANI.
What manner of heretics these were.
PAtriciani said that man's flesh was not made of God, but of the devil,
Heretics.
so that some dispatched themselves to cast off the flesh. August.

PAVLE.
How Paul's afflictions is prophesied of Agabus.
SO shall the Jews at Jerusalem, Act. 21. 11
bind the man that owes this girdle. God for the most part is wont to warn
his elect before, what afflictions and troubles shall happen unto the^ for his
sake, and not to fray them thereby, but rather to prepare and arm their minds
against the boisterous tempests of persecution. Therefore does he now send
Agabus unto Paul, to prophecy unto him of his imprisonment and bonds, that he
should suffer at Jerusalem, where we have also a good example of constancy
and steadfastness in Paul, which regarding nothing the tears of his familiar
friends, nor yet peril of his own life, did through fire and water go on
still to set forth the glory of God. Sir. I. Cheek.

God would ^haue his servant bands known, to the intent that no man should
think that he cast himself into wilful danger. This was not to make Paul
afraid, but to encourage him against the brunt. Geneua.

How Paul persecuted Christ in his members.
I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. Act. 20. 8.
Jesus was now in heaven, and could not be persecuted of Paul. But the
persecution which Paul exercised against the faithful being his members,
Christ counted it as done unto himself. The Bible note.

Of the comfort that God gave to paul in his journey to Rome.
And he entered into a ship to Adr^mitium. Act. 27. 2
The life of man is a perpetual warfare upon the earth. Paul being delivered
out of the hands of the ungodly, and that so many times, is now feign to commit
himself to the rough waters of the sea, where he was a long season in great
peril and ieopardy of his own life. God being always (to the great comfort
of all them that heard of it) most ready to help and succor him. First he did
send him a most friendly company, I mean Aristarcus and Lucas, so ruling the
heart also of the vndercaptaine, that he was beneficial unto him always. In
like manner God did in the old time, appoint men for Joseph and the Prophet
Jeremy, when they were in their most troubles.

Of Paul's purifieng.
We have four men, which have a vow on them, Act. 21. 23.
them take and purify thy self with them. Paul yielding to this ceremony,
offended as sore as Peter did when he was reproved of Paul, for absteining
from meat s in presence of the Gentiles, notwithstanding through feruencie of
his zeal, he did ieopard much to win thousands of the Jews, for the
salvation of whom he wished himself to be separated from Christ. The Bible
note.

The end of this ceremony was thanksgiving, and was instituted by God, and
partly of ignorance and infirmity received. Therefore S. Paul supported
therein the weakness of others, and made himself all to all men, not bindring
his conscience. Geneua.

Of Paul's appealing.
I appeal to Caesar. Act. 25. 11
The iniquity of the Judge, who contrary to equity willing to pleasure the
Jews, devised how to betray Paul, drove Paul to appeal, which is the
uttermost remedy for such as by wrong judgment are oppressed. And this
appellation by Gods providence, was a mean that Paul should testify of
Christ at Rome also. The Bible note.

How Paul had his authority from God, and not from Peter.
Paul an Apostle not of men, Col. 1. 1.
neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and by God the Father, etc. Paul though
he came long after the Apostles, yet had he not his authority of Peter, or of
any that went before him: Neither brought he with him letters of
recommendation, or Bulls of confirmation, but the confirmation of his
Apostleship was, the word of God, conscience of men, and the power of the
spirit, that testified with him by miracles and manifold gifts of grace.
Tindale.

How Paul and James are made to agree.
The saiengs of the two Apostles Paul and James are not contrary, James. 2. 17
whereas Paul says, a man is justified without works, and James says, faith
without works is in vain. For Paul speaks of the works that go before
faith: James speaks of the works that follow after. August. lt. 8. quae qua.
76. James. 5.

The ordinary gloss out of Saint Austen says, Augst. 38. quest. 26.
that Paul and James do agree in this sort. That whereas Abraham was
justified by faith without good works, it is understood of the works that
went before, for he was not made just, for the works he did, but for faith
only. And here it is meant of the works which do follow faith, by which he
was justified the more, whereas he was just before by faith. Wherefore Paul
says, Abraham offered up Isaac when he was proved. This oblation was the work
and testimony of his faith and justice. This he writes upon the Epistle of
Saint James. So that if the offering of Isaac was the testimony of the faith
and justice of Abraham, than he was not justified by it, but declared thereby
to be just. Musculus. fol. 230.

Join the lively faith of S. Paul, with the good works of S. James, and bring
both these into one life: And then have thou reconciled them both: and so shall
thou be sure to be justified, both before God by Paul's faith, and before man by
S. James works. M. Fox.

How Paul denies to be crucified for us.
Was Paul crucified for you? 1. Cor. I. 13
It is evident by Saint Paul's saying, that Christ only who was crucified for
us, ought to be our Lord, and that in matters of religion, we ought only to
have our name of him, and not to be called after this Doctor or that Doctors
name, for that is to deny Christ, and so to bring again the hypocritical
sects of Friars and Monks. Sir. I. Cheek.

Of Paul's beating and mortifieng his body.
I beat my body says S. Paul, 1. Cor. 9. 27
and bring it into subjection, least by any means after that I have preached
to other, I my self should be reproved. Whereas some do gather of this place,
that Paul did mortify in himself the fire of inconstancy, by long fasting,
and by beating and scourging of his body, it is nothing so. For what need had
he to ^ame his body with fasting, when he was shut up in prison and had
nothing to eat, either yet to beat and scourge his body, when he suffered
stripes enough of his enemies. S. Paul had the gift of continency, as it
appears. 1. Cor. 7. I would (says he) that all men were as I my self am,
but every man has his proper gift of God, etc. Then by these words Saint Paul
does mean, that he did subdue and mortify his body, for to live according to
the doctrine y^ he himself did teach, least be should be reproved of men when
they should see him do contrary, or contemn y^ thing which he taught other to
do. Ric. Turnar.

Of Paul's unquietness of the flesh.
Look. Flesh.

How Paul wrought with his hands.
He abode with them and wrought: Act. 1^. 3.
Their craft was to make tents. How do they follow Paul's example, which
neither give themselves to the study of holy Scriptures, to feed the flock
of Christ, nor yet will labor with their hands, but live idly with the sweat
of other men's brows: there was a law among the Massilians, that if any man
did go about to live idly under the pretense of some kind of religion, he should
in no wise be received into their city. Sir. I. Cheek.

Thus he used where ever he came, but principally at Corinthus, because of the
false Apostles, which preached without wages, to win the peoples favor. His
craft was to make tents or pauilions, which were made of skins. Geneua.

Wherefore Paul wished himself to be separate from Christ.
For I have wished my self to be separated from Christ, Romans 9. 3.
for my brethren, etc. The Apostle loved his brethren so entirely, that if it
had been possible, he would have been ready to have redeemed the casting away
of the Israelites, with the loss of his own soul for ever. For this word
separate betokens as much in this place. Beza.

He saw the loss and destruction of his whole nation, falling so far from
Gods true religion, he considered how far God should be dishonored, when his
wonderful benefits and blessings bestowed upon his people should take none
effect, but utterly be defaced, which so mightily moved him, ye he wished
rather to be cut off from Christ, then those things should come to pass. The
Bible note.

He would redeem the reiection of the Jews with his own dampnation, which
declares his zeal toward Gods glory. Read Exo. 32. 32. Geneua.

How Paul had a wife.
Paul wished that all men were as he was. 1. Cor. 7. 7
That is, he wished that all the Corinthians which advanced themselves of
virginity and widowhood, could live chaste without a woman, as he did, which
left his wife Wife.
in an other place then where he preached, and that all men were without care
as he was, which thing commonly follows marriage.

Look. Apostles had wives, what Erasmus says thereof.

Ignatius, and also Clemens Alexandrinus, which were very nigh the Apostles
time, does plainly affirm that S. Paul had a wife. Ecclesiast. histo. li. 3.
cap. 30.

What Paul calls the infirmity of the flesh.
Paul calls the infirmity of the flesh, ^al. 4. 13.
no disease of y^ body, or temptation of the flesh, but his suffering and
affliction which he suffered in his body. So that he sets the same against
the virtue and power of the spirit. But least we should seem to wrast and
pervert Paul's words, let us hear himself speaking in the. 2. Cor. 12. 10.
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in
persecutions, and anguish for Christ's sake, for when I am weak, then am I
strong. And in the. 11. chapt. 13. In labors more abundant, in stripes above
measure, in prisons more plenteous, in death often, of the Jews five times
received I forty stripes save one. I was thrice beaten with rods, I was once
stoned, I suffered thrice shipwreck, etc. These afflictions which he suffered
in his body, he calls infirmities of the flesh, and not corporal diseases.

PAVLVS SAMOSATENVS.
Of the heresy that this man taught.
THis man was Bishop of Antioch. Heretic.
He denied the trinity. He taught that Christ took his beginning of our lady.
And was a man only of our common nature, which heres^e was condemned by a
general Council, and Paulus excommunicated. He was about the year of our
Lord. 267.

PEACE.
How Christ came not to send peace on earth, but debate.
SUppose ye that I am come to send peace on earth: Luk 12. 5.
I tell you nay, but rather debate. So the peace as this world loves (which is
then at peace, when men's appetites and desires are satisfied, and when the
evil agree with the evil) came I not to send on earth, but therefore came I
with y^ words of very peace, to destroy the peace of this world. For since the
doctrine of the Gospel which teaches all peace shall be envied of many, it
cannot be but debate must arise, even amongst greatest friends, while they
that love this world, will sooner exercise cruelty toward them y^ they love
best, then leave y^ vices which they have been accustomed unto. And again,
those whom the fire of the charity belonging to the Gospel has touched,
will by no means suffer themselves to be divided from that which they have
begun to cleave to. Betwixt these two am I not come to set peace but debate.
Tindale.

What it is to be at peace with God.
Because therefore that we are justified by faith, Romans 5. 1.
we are at peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ. To be at peace with
God, is none other thing then to have tranquillity and rest in our hearts to
Godward, knowing assuredly ye we be accepted of him, and do please him, which
thing we find by faith only, in that it receives forgiveness of sins, and
newness of life everlasting by mercy obtained at Christ's hands. Our own works
can bring no such tranquillity, because they be unsure, and engender doubt, of
which follows desperation, and of it dampnation, we are not ashamed of our
hope, for we are sure by the death of Christ that God loves us, and will bring
our hope to pass.

By peace here is meant that incredible and most constant joy of mind, when
we are delivered from all terror of conscience, and fully persuaded of the
favor of God, and this peace is the fruit of faith. Geneua.

By peace, which is the fruit of faith, is meant the incredible and most
constant joy of mind, our conscience being quiet and established in Gods
grace. The Bible note.

How peace makers be blessed.
Blessed be the peace makers, Mat. 5. 9.
etc. To inherit this blessing, it is not only required, that thou have peace
in thy self, and that thou take all to the best, and be not offended lightly,
and for every small trifle, and always ready to forgive, nor sow ^o discord,
nor avenge thine own wrong: But also that thou be fervent and diligent to make
peace, and go between person and person, and that thou leave nothing unsought
to set the^ at one. Tin.

Cursed be the peace breakers, Peace breakers.
pikequarrellers, whispers, backebiters, sowers of discord, dispraisers of them
that be good, stirrers up of Princes to battle, bee-liers of the true
preachers of Gods word, etc. Tindale.

What peace offering is.
To offer peace offering of Oxen unto the Lord. Exo. 24. 5.
Peace offering is to reconcile God toward men, to be at peace with them, and
to forgive them their trespass: or as some men say, for peace obtained after
victory in battle. As before in the. 20. cha. ver. 24. and after in the. 32.

PELAGIVS.
Of his heresy.
PElagius a Britain and a Monk of Bangor, Heretic
wrote notable books as Geonadius said before he fell into heresy: his
heresies were these: That man without the grace of God, was able to fulfill all
the Commandments of God: that man had free will: that the grace of God was
given unto us according to our merits: that the just have no sin in this
life: that children have no original sin: that Adam should have dyed, if he
had not sinned. Aug. li. de haeres. Polidor.

PENAVNCE.
What this word penance is, and how it was invented.
Penance is a word of their own forging (meaning the Papists) to deceive us
withal, as many others are. In y^ scripture we find Poenitentia, Repentance.
Agite poenitentiam, Do repent. Poeniteat vos, Let it repent you. Metanoyte in
Greek, Forethinke you, or let it forethinke you. Of repentance they have made
penance to blind the people, and to make them think y^ they must take pain,
and do some holy deeds to make satisfaction for their sins, namely such as they
inoine them. As thou may see in the Chronicles, when great kings and tyrants
(which with violence of sword conquered other kings lands, and slew all that
came to hand) came to themselves, and had conscience of their wicked deeds,
then ye Bishops coupled them, not to Christ, but to the Pope, and preched the
Pope unto them, and made them submit themselves and also their Realms, unto
the holy Father the Pope, and to take penance (as they call it) that is to
say, such Injunctions, as the Pope and Bishops would command them to do: to
build Abbeyes, and to endow them with lyuelode, to be prayed for, for ever. And
to give them exemptions, and privilege and license, to do what they lust
unpunished, etc. Tind.

What true penance is.
The most high penitenciarie Christ, when he gave and defined true penance or
repentance, said: Go and sin no more. And Ambrose says: True penance is
to cease from sin. Our Church masters of penance, do bring the word
repentance unto that that the poor seduced people, do think that they have
repented sufficiently for their sins, in case they observe the same which was
appointed them for their penance, according to the number, manner, time and
tide given them by their ghostly father: although they never feel one jot of
true repentance in their hearts, nor yet did accomplish it in work. Mus. fo.
215.

To do penance and repent, what it is.
To do penance, as Divines speak, and to correct our life, is to cast out of
our mind, all the purpose and manner of our living, those things which be
contrary to the will of God, whether we our selves received them by our
affection and error, or whether they were delivered unto us by some other men,
as it were with hands, and to do, yea, and with greatest studis to ensue those
things, which are agreeable unto the supreme law, and most perfect reason,
that is to say, unto the mind of God. So that he which before time did
supersticiously worship things created: let him now religiously worship only
the true living God: which before was perjured, may now keep his Oath, and
perform those things whereunto he is sworn: which before was an homicide, may
now abhor from slaughter and blood: which before was a breaker of wedlock
and an unclean person, may now hold Matrimony in holy reverence and live
chastely: which did hurt his brethren with craft and guiles, may now abstain
from injuries, and do good to as many as he is able to profit, etc.
Bibliander. fo. 76.

PENIE.
How a penny is taken in Scripture.
ANd they took him a penny. Ma. 22. 19
A penie is ever taken for that the Jews call a sickle, and is worth ten pence
sterling. Tindale.

Before in the. 17. Chapter verse. 24. there is mention made of Didrachme, and
here a penie, whereas the Didrachme is more by the seventh part then a penie,
so that there seems to be aiarre in these two places. But they may be easily
accorded thus. The penie was paid to the Romans for tribute, according to the
proportion they were rated at, the Drachme was paid for every one to the
Temple, which also the Romans took to themselves, when they had subdued
Judea. Theo. Beza.

PEOR.
What Peor is.
IS the wicked deed of Peor too little for us, Iosu. 22. 17
etc. The wicked deed of Peor, for the wicked Idolatry done to Peor. Peor, (or
as some will) Phogor, was an Idol of the Moabites, which was worshipped in an
hill in Moab called Peor, where the Israelites not only committed carnal
whoredom with the women of the Moabites, but also spiritual whoredom, that
is, became Idolaters, and worshipped that Idol Peor, which y^ Moabites did.
For which they were plagued, so y^ there died of them four and twenty
thousand at y^ time. As ye read. Nu. 25. 3. T. M.

PEPVZIANI.
What manner of Heretics they were.
PEpuziani were Heretics Heretics
which came out of the Uillage Pepuza. Their abiding was in Galatia and
Cappadocia. They were called Quintilliani and Priscilliani, because that Christ
in the form of a woman lay with Quintillia a maid (or as some say Priscilla)
and revealed unto her divine mysteries. Women and Priests among them, Women
Priests.
their sacrifice is a like with the Montanists. Epiph. haeres. 49.

PERFECTION.
To be perfect, what it is.
YE shall be perfect as your father in heaven is perfect. Mat. 5. 4^.
The text says not, he shall be as perfect as God, but perfect after his
example. To be perfect in the Scriptures, is not to be a Monk or a Friar, or
never to sin. For Christ teaches not here, Monks and Friars, but his
Disciples, and every Christian man and woman, and to be in this life altogether
without sin, is impossible. But to be perfect, is to have pure doctrine,
without false opinions, and that thine heart be to follow that learning.
Tindale.

We must labor to attain unto the perfection of God who of his free
liberality, does good to them that are unworthy. Geneua.

Walk before me (says God to Abraham) and thou shall be perfect. Genesis 17. 1.
Which is as much to say, as if thou will have me always before thine eyes,
thou shall proceed to perfection. The like is said in Matthew. 19. 21. If thou will be perfect, go and sell all that thou have, etc. Not that this young man
for so doing was by and by perfect, but by that he went forward to perfection.
Lyra.

If thou will be perfect, Mat. 19. 17
keep the commandments. S. Austen says, that God gives us that keeping,
and moves us to be good willers, or else we would never will but evil.

Wherein perfection consists.
Perfection consists not in selling all that we have, Mat. 19. 21
and giving to the poor only, but in following Christ, in bearing his Cross,
and in mortifieng the perverse and crooked disposition of the flesh. We ought
always to bear in mind the saying of our Savior Christ: If any man will
follow me, let him deny him self, and take up his Cross and follow me, etc.
Marl. fo. 432.

How man's perfection is imperfect.
Thou shall love thy Lord thy God with all thy heart, Deuteronomy. 6. 5
with all thy soul, with all thy power. Ye shall not turn, neither to the
right hand nor to the left, Accursed is he that stands not in every thing
that is written in the law to performs the same. And S. James says, Iam. 2. 18.
Who so offends in one commandment, is guilty in all. Mat. 5. 48.
And Christ says, Be ye perfect (not meaning your selves by your own
ability, but) as your father is perfect which is in heaven. And yet heerby he
means not the perfection that is in God and his Angels, but only the
perfection that is required in man.

I beseech you (says S. Hierom) has God commanded me that I should be the
same that God is, Hiero. ad Chr. cont. Pela.
that there should be no difference in perfection, between me and my Lord the
Creator, that I should be above the highness of Angels, or that I should have
that the Angels have not?

I said, Augu. de spi and lit. cap. 1.
it is possible that a man may be without sin if he want not will, the power
of God assisting him. And yet I find that besides Christ in whom all men shall
be quickness to life, there was never man, nor never shall be, who being in
this life, shall have this perfection.

Wherefore does Christ say, Mat. 5. 48.
Be ye perfect: wherefore does Paul say, As many of us as be perfect etc.
Heereto S. Hierom answers thus, What then do we think, or what ought we to
think, that be not perfect? We ought to confess that we are imperfect, and
that we have not yet gotten, nor taken that perfection that is required. This
is the true wisdom of a man, to know himself to be imperfect. And as I might
say, the perfection of all just men living in the flesh, is imperfect.

He has much profited in this life, Augu. de spi. and lit. ca. 35.
that by his profiting has learned, how far he is from the perfection of
righteousness.

Our very righteousness it self is so great in this life, Augu. de Ciui li.
^9 ca. 27.
that it stands rather in forgiveness of our sins, then in perfection of
righteousness. Jewel. fo. 316. 317. 318.

PERGAMVS.
What Pergamus was.
CHurch, which is at Pergamus. Apo. 2. 12.
Pergamus was the name of a famous City in old time in Asia, where the kings
of the Atalians were always resident. The faith of them of Pergamus is much
commended, because they remained constant, even in the very heat of
persecution. Theo. Beza.

PEARL.
What a Pearl in Scripture does signify.
NEither cast ye your Pearls before swine. Mat. 6. 6
A Pearl has his name among the Grecians, for the orient brightness that is
in it. And a Pearl in ancient time, was in great estimation among the
Latins: for a Pearl that Cleopatra had, was valued at two hundred and fifty
thousand Crowns: and the word is now borrowed from that, to signify the most
precious heavenly doctrine. Theo. Beza.

PERIVRIE.
How perjury is made lawful by the Popes law.
YE shall understand that these two worthy Martirs of Jesus Christ, Perjury is
no sin by the popes law.
John Hus, and Hierom of Prage were called to the general Council holden at
Constaunce, and faith was made to them, that by safe conduct, they should come
safe and return safe, and yet were they contrary to the faith, taken and
burned. And least that holy Council should seem to do any thing, wherein
all their sect did not consent, they made this Antichristian law in the 19.
Session: Presens sancta Synadus, etc. This present holy Counsel does publish
and declare, that there can no prejudice, hurt or hinderaunce come to the
Catholic faith, or to the Ecclesiastical jurisdiction by reason of any safe
conduct granted by the Emperor, by Kings or other Princes of the earth, to
any which either be heretics or defamed of heresy, for what bond or promise
soever the same Princes have made unto them (their safe conduct
notwithstanding) it is lawful for any compitent Ecclesiastical Judge, to
enquire of the errors, yea, although they come to y^ place of judgment,
trusting upon their safe conduct, so that otherwise they would not have come.
Neither he that makes any such promise, any whit bound to perform it, if he
have done that that lay in him otherwise. I. Pon.

PERMISSION.
Of Gods permission or suffering.
WE must note, that when either the Scriptures or Fathers, do seem God to be
the cause of sin, this word permission is not there so to be added, as though
he only suffered men to sin, and by his providence or government, wrought
nothing as concerning sins. Indeed he lets them not, though he can, but
uses them, and shows in them his might, and not only his patience which
thing Augustine understood right well, and disputed against Iulianus, he confuted
that sentence, where it is said, that God suffers sin only according to
patience, and proves that his might is also thereunto to be added by the words
of Paul, who wrote unto the Romans: If God by much patience have suffered
vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, to show forth his anger, and to
make known his might. And undoubtedly there are many things in the holy
scripture, which cannot always be dissolved by the word of permission or
patience. For the heart of the King is said to be in the hand of the Lord, so
that he inclines it, whether soever it pleases him. And Job testifies that
it was so done as God would. But as touching the sin of the first man, when
yet nature was not viciated and corrupted, we grant y^ the cause thereof came
from the will of Adam, and suggestion of the Devil, and we say that God
permitted it, because when he might have withstood and let it, he would not
do it, but decreed to use that sin, to declare his Justice and goodness.
Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 167.

PERSECVTION.
What persecution is.
PErsecution is an obstinate pursuing to destroy, Mat 5. 10
by the which there is no place of rest and quietness given: but the
destruction of Innocents is sought with all kind of violence and deceits. Mar.
upon Math. fol. 81.

They which do follow upon any man, for to be revenged, so that they make no
end of pursuing of him, nor leave from that which they had begun withal, be
rightly called persecuters: although that at length they be compelled to leave
off, contrary to their determination and purpose, as it betideth to all
persecuters, which are at the last constrained whether they will or not, to
break off the race and course of their persecution. Some do take the word of
persecuting or pursuing, to be a full following or pursuing in all points. As
when an Hound follows the Dear a dry foot up hill and down, through thick
and thin, etc. Both senses be applied to this word of persecuting. The first
is touched in Samuel. Saul sought or pursued for David every day, 1. Re. 23.
14.
but the Lord did not deliver him into his hands. What is it else to seek a
man every day to slay him, but to persecute him continually? Of the second we
do read in the same Chapter, where he says: Ver. 23.
But in case he do hyde him in the earth, I will search for him amongst or out
of all the thousands of Judah. He means that he will search for David
diligently in every corner, and that he will omit nothing touching the
persecution of him. And David used this word properly in the Psalm, saying: I
will persecute mine enemies and overtake them, Psa. 18. 37
I will not return till they shrink, I will break them so that they shall
not be able to stand, they shall fall under my feet. When he says, I will
persecute mine enemies and overtake them, he does express the purpose of them
which do persecute, which is bent to this end, to overtake and catch them
whom they do persecute. And whereas he does add: I will not return until
they do shrink, it declares his earnest diligence and desire in the
persecution or following. And that point: I will break them and crush them
together, that they shall not be able to stand, they shall fall under my feet,
expresses the revenge which the persecutour entendeth to take upon him when
he does persecute. And these be the parts of full and perfect persecution,
continually without ceasing, to persecute, to catch, and to revenge. Musculus.
fol. 516.

How some persecution is just, and some wrong.
If that be the true Church (says Augustine) which suffers persecution, not
that which does it (so said the Donatist) let them ask of the Apostle, what
church Sara signified when the did persecute her handmaid, for he says that
the free woman our mother the heavenly Jerusalem, that is to say, the true
Church of God, was figured in that woman which afflicted her handmayd. And a
little after: Again, I demand in case that the good and holy do persecute
none, but only suffer, whose saying suppose they that the same is in the
Psalm, where we read: I will persecute mine enemies, and overtake them, and I
will not turn till they shrink. Therefore if we speak and acknowledge the
truth, that is a wrongful persecution which the ungodly makes upon the Church
of Christ, and that persecution is just which the Church of Christ makes
against the ungodly. Thus says Augustine. Musculus. fol. 518.

How the Church does persecute.
The Church says Augustine in the place before, does persecute by loving to
reform, and to call men back from error, and to make them to profit in the
truth. And it is like the persecution of a loving mother, and not of a
spiteful stepdame. Such I would have the Church persecution (says Musculus)
when the rulers of the Church shall in the name of the Church persecute, not
the innocent, but the hurtful more politikely then Church like. But whereas the
false shepherds under pretense of heresy and schism do persecute (not the
Goats which they cherish, but the true sheep of Christ, which do follow ye
voice of their only shepherd, and do abhor the voice of strangers) with
banishment and out-lawe, prison, wrongful judgments, snare, sword, faggot and
fire, what shall we call it else, but the tyranny of Antichrist: whereas
Augustine said, that is a wrongful persecution which the ungodly makes
against the Church of Christ, he might well have added thereunto, and that in
ten times more wrongful, which the malignant Church works against the godly.
But in his time, the Romish Tyranny had not yet so openly set up her shameless
head, to practice all kind of persecutions and public oppressions of them
that would descent from them. Musculus. fol. 519.

Wherefore the true Christians are persecuted.
Blessed are they that suffer persecution for righteousness sake. Mat. 5. 10
If the faith of Christ and law of God be written in thine heart, that is, if
thou believe in Christ to be justified from sin, or for remission of sin,
and consentest in thine heart to the law, that it is good, holy and just, and
thy duty to do it, and submittest thy self so to do, and thereupon goes
forth and testifies that faith and righteousness openly unto the world in
word and deed: Then will Satan stir up his members against thee, and thou
shall be persecuted on every side, but be of good comfort and faint not. Call
to mind the saying of Saint Paul. 2. Timothy. 3. 12. Now all that will live
godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution, etc. Tindale.

Chrysostom says: Does the Sheep persecute the Wolf at any time? Chri. Man.
homil. 9.
No, but the Wolf does persecute the Sheep. For so Cain persecuted Abel, not
Abel Cain. So Ismael persecuted Isaac, not Isaac Ismael, so the Jews
persecuted Christ, not Christ the Jews. So the Heretics persecute the
Christians, and not the Christians the Heretics. Therefore ye shall know them
by their fruits. Again, Chrysostom says in the same place: Whomsoever ye
see rejoice in the blood of persecution, he is a Wolf. Jewel. fol. 2.

Moses says, Ismael played or sported with Isaac. But Saint Paul says, Genesis
21. 9
the same plaieng and sporting, was persecution. For thus he writes, Gal. 4. 29
He that was after ye flesh, persecuted him that was after the spirit. D.
Heynes.

How the Christians in persecution does multiply.
The Christians (says S. Austen) were bound, Augu. de Ciu. li. 22 ca. 6.
were imprisoned, were beaten, were tormented, were burnt, and yet were
multiplied, etc.

The miserable end of certain cruel persecutors.
Saul did murder himself. Achitophel hanged himself. Judas did the like.
Sennacherib murdered of his own sons. Herod and Antiochus murdered by lyce.
Pilate murdered of himself. Nero murdered of himself. Dioclesian and
Maximianus Emperors, deposed themselves. Maximinus eaten up with lyce:
Maxentius and Pharao both drowned in their own harness

PETER.
Why Peter is called chief of the Apostles.
THey say that Peter was chief of the Apostles, verely^ as Appelles was called
chief Chief
of Painters for his excellent cunning above other, even so Peter may be called
chief of the Apostles for his actiuitie and boldness above the other. But
that Peter had anys authority or rule over his brethren and fellow Apostles,
is false and contrary to the Scripture. Christ forbad it even the last hour
before his Passion, and in diverse times before, and taught always the contrary.
Tindale. fo. 143.

Of Peter's confession.
When Peter had professed the very true confession of Christ that he was the
Son of God, Christ said to him: Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock, I will
build my Church, that is to say, upon the faith whereby thou have confessed and
acknowledged me. And that Christ by this Rock whereupon he said, he would
build his Church, did understand and mean himself. Saint Austen does write in
an Homely which he has written upon this place, where he says: If Christ
would have laid the foundation of his Church upon Peter, truly he would have
said: Thou art Peter, and upon thee will I build my Church. Christ is only that
proved corner stone, which as Daniel says, shall break all the kingdoms of
the world, and it self shall endure for ever a stable and strong foundation of
the kingdom and congregation of Christ, which thing is also confirmed by the
Prophet Esaias. And Saint Paul teaching the same doctrine, says: that we must
be raised up in this holy building of the Church, not upon Peter, but upon the
most strong foundation of the Prophets and of the Apostles. And where as many
might chance to stomble at the stone, thinking that Christ during the time of
his being in earth was the foundation of the Church, but when he was once
lifted up into heaven, he then left Peter in his stead. Paul the Apostle
teaches the contrary in especial words when he says: Peter not head of y^
Church
There can none other foundation be laid, then that which is laid already,
which is Jesus Christ. And whereas some do say, that Peter, or some other
Bishop of Rome is the foundation of the Church of Christendom, is as false as
God is true: for Saint Paul writing to the Galathians, says not that Peter
was the foundation of the Church of Christ, but calls him a pillar, as he
called also James and John, making him equal, but not superior. Bar. Ochine.

In the 16. chapter of Saint Matthew, the question being put in general of
Christ to all his Apostles, what they thought or judged of him, Peter
aunswering for them all, as he was always ready to answer, said: Thou art
Christ the son of the living God, to whom Jesus answered again: Blessed be
thou Simon the son of Jonas, for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto
thee, but my father which is in heaven, and I say unto thee: Thou art Peter,
and upon this Rock will I build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not
prevail against it. That is to say, upon this Rock of thy confession of me to
be the son of God, I will build my Church. For this faith contains the
whole summarie of our faith and salvation. As it is written. Romans 10. The word
of faith that we do preach, is at hand, in thy mouth, and in thy heart. For
if thou confess with my mouth our Lord Jesus Christ, and with thine heart do
believe that God has raised him from death to life, thou shall be saved, etc.
And this confession being first uttered by the mouth of Peter, upon the same
confession of his, and not upon the person of Peter, but upon the faith,
Christ has builded his Church. And what is the faith? This: thou art the son
of the living God. That is to say, upon this Rock? That is: Upon this
confession of Peter, etc. And with this saying of Chrysostom, all ancient
Expositours do agree. For if we should expound that place that the Church is
builded upon the person of Peter, we should put another foundation of the
Church then Christ, which is directlye against Saint Paul saying: No man may
put any other foundation, but that which is put already, which is Christ Jesus.
Tonstall in the bo. of Mar. fol. 1208.

How Peter was not the Rock, but Christ.
Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock which thou confessest, upon this Rock
which thou acknowledgest, Au. in his 13. Psa. upon Mat.
saying: Thou art Christ the son of the living God, I will build my Church. I
will build thee upon me, and not me upon thee. For men willing to build upon
men, said: I am of Paul, I am of Apollo, I hold of Cephas side, which is
Peter: others that would not build upon Peter, but upon the Rock, Peter was
not the Rock
said: I hold of Christ. And the Apostle Paul, when he did know that he was
chosen and preferred, and Christ despised by some men, said: Is Christ divided?
Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? And as
not in Paul's name, no more were ye baptized in the name of Peter, but in the
name of Christ, that Peter might be builded upon the Rock, and not the Rock
upon Peter. Again, Saint Austen says, Christ is the Rock, and that Petra the
Rock is the principal name, and that Petrus Peter, is derived of Petra the
Rock. And not Petra the Rock, upon Petrus Peter.

Of Peter's denieng of Christ.
But he denied before them all. (...). 26. 70
Peter had before confessed that Christ was the only begotten son of the
living God, Peter denies.
and now he utterly denies him. Yet for all that, as soon as he repented and
did call for mercy he was forgiven. That opinion then is false, which
affirms that if a man fall (after he has known the truth, he shall never
be forgiven. Sir. I. Cheek.

An example of our infirmity, that we may learn to depend upon GOD, and
not put our trust in our selves.

How Peter speaks for all.
As Christ did not only ask Peter, but all the rest of the Apostles with him,
when he said: but who say you that I am? So also Peter made answer in the
name of all the Apostles, or else they all being demanded should every one
have answered for themselves. But there was much communication among them at
sundry times before, and they all confessed with one accord, that he was the
Son of GOD, although Judas with a lyuelye faith believed not so. And Christ
at an other time, asked all his Apostles. Will you also depart? Peter only
in the name of the rest, made answer. Thou have the words of eternal life,
which thing is evident of the words that follow, to whom shall we go? We
know and believed long ago that thou art Christ the son of the living God. Of
a like sort he answered in the name of them all, when he spoke these wordes^
Thou art Christ the son of God. And because Peter in the mouth of them all,
confessed Christ to be the son of God: ye must grant that when Christ said:
Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I build my Church, that he spoke not
only to Peter, but to them all, although it were in the name of Peter. As
though he had said, Peter only is not the living Rock, but all such as
following his example, verily believe and confess Christ to be the son of
God, be lively Rocks, which be builded upon the vncha^ngeable and precious
corner stone Christ, the only foundation of his Church. Bar. Ochme.

How Peter's faith is prayed for, that it should not fail.
Simon, behold Satan has desired to fifte thee, as it were Wheat, Lu. 22. 32
to try whether he by his old craft that he once practiced upon Eve, The
Apostles faith in the dai of judgment shall condemn the scribs and the
pharesies with the rest of the number of the jews for their incredulity
could overcome thee, but I have made a petition or prayer for thee, that thy
faith shall never fail, not the faith that thou beleeuest that I am the Son
of God, for so every man's faith ends, when this life ends. Forasmuch as
faith properly, is only of those things which we see not, nor feel not, but
believe to see them. As soon therefore, as our souls shall enter into the
celestial joy, prepared for us in Christ, we have the very sight and fruition
of that everlasting bliss, which we believed and hoped to come unto, and
therefore when Christ says to Peter, I have prayed that thy faith shall never
fail, it is meant of the confession that Peter made, when he said: Thou art
Christ the Son of God. This thy confession Simon Peter, this thy faith shall
never fail unto the worlds end. And that it may the better stand and
flourish, see that thou Simon Peter after thou shall be thoroughly converted, I
pray not for the world John. 17. but for them who^ thou have given me
which shall be after my Passion, and receiving of the Holy Ghost in a visible
sign: Confirma fratres tuos: See that thou do confirm thy brethren: exhort
them, comfort them, and encourage them manfully to resist Satan and all his
people, and to cleave to the faith that thou have confessed. Ric. Turnar.

When Christ prayed for Peter, that his faith should not fail it did not
follow therefore that he was Pope, and could not err, for he erred after that
time, sundry times: and namely, when he expressly denied Christ the Son of
God. But when Christ perceived Peter's timorous boldness, that shortly after he
would shamefully deny him, to arm and strengthen him against the temptation
which should ensue, least the greatness of the fault might hurl him down
into desperation, he said unto him: Satan goes about to sifte you like
Chafe, and to undo and destroy you, yea, you had been already utterly lost,
if I had not prayed for you, and for thee especially Peter by name, that thy
faith should not fail, because thou will fall fowler then the rest. And I
know that God has heard my prayer. For although thou will deny me with thy
mouth, yet thou will not deny me with thy heart. Thou will sin, but sin
shall not reign in thee, so that in thy heart thou shall not yield to
naughty temptations. I will suffer thee to have a foul fall, that by the
means thereof, thy timorous boldness may be brideled and rebuked. And again,
that after when thou shall come to thy self, and perceive thine own
infirmity, thy heart shall be touched with compassion against those that shall
sin, raising them up with knowledge, and confirming and boldening them with
thine example. Barnar. Ochine.

Peter, I have prayed for thee, that thy faith shall never fail, and thou
being once converted, confirm thy brethren. Surely that speaks only of the
fall of Peter, known to Christ by his godly prescience, whereof he gave him an
inckling, that after the time of his fall, he should not despair, but retour^e
again, and confirm his brethren, as he ever being most seruent of them was
wont to do. The place does plainlye open it self, it cannot be otherwise
taken, but this to be the very meaning of it, and not to be spoken but to
Peter. For else his successors must first fail in the faith, and then convert,
and so confirm the brethren. Tonstall in the b. of Mar. fol. 1212.

Christ said to Peter, Augu de (...) Do in Euan. se^.
I have prayed for thee, that thy faith shall never fail. Saint Austen says:
Numquid pio petro rogabat, etc. Did Christ pray for Peter, and did he not
pray for John and James. Lu^. sc. 35
Again, This night has Satan desired to thresh you, as it were wheat: but I
^aue prayed to my father, (not for Peter only, but) for you, that your faith
may not fail.

Origin says: Origin in Ma. ^^a. 1.
Numquid audeamus dicere, etc. May we dare to say, that the gates of Hell shall
not prevail against Peter, but shall prevail against the other Apostles and
Rulers of the Church: Were the ^^yes of the kingdom of Heaven, given only to
Peter? And shall no holy man else receive the same? Nay, all the things, both
that were said before, and also that follow after, as spoken to Peter, are
common, and belong unto them all.

Peter's seat, what it is.
Peter's seat, Peter's seat
is no stool or chair (for what has the kingdom of God to do with such
baggage) but it is a spiritual thing. Christ says in the Gospel: The Scribes
and Pharesies sit in Moses seat, what was Moses seat there, a Chair, or a
Temple, or the Church, or Synagogue of the Lord? Nay verily, for Moses came
never there. But Moses seat was Moses Law and doctrine. Even so Peter's seat,
is Peter's doctrine, the Gospel of Christ, which Peter taught, and the same
doctrine is Peter's keys. So that Peter's seat, Peter's keys, and Peter's
doctrine, is all one thing. Now is Peter's doctrine, Paul's doctrine, and the
doctrine of all the twelve Apostles indifferently, for they taught all one
thing. Wherefore it follows, that Peter's keys, and Peter's seat, be the
keys and seat of Paul also, and of all the other. xij. Apostles, and are
nothing save the Gospel of Christ. And thus as Peter's doctrine is no better
then Paul's, but one thing, even so Peter's seat is no greater nor higher, or
holyer, then the seat of the other xij. Peter's seat now is Christ's seat,
Christ's Gospel on the which all the Apostles sat, and on which this day
sits they only which preach Christ truly. Wherefore, as Antichrist preaches
not Christ's doctrine (which is Christ's Gospel) he sits not on Peter's seat,
but on the seat of Satan, whose Uicar he is, and on the seat of his own
laws and ceremonies and false doctrine, whereunto he compels all men with
violence of sword. Tindale. 359.

How Peter was rebuked of S. Paul.
There was a fault in Peter's conversation: ^al. 2. 14.
not any error in his doctrine or preaching, for in their doctrine Peter and
Paul agreed wonderful well. It is not good and profitable (says S. Austen)
to correct an open fault in secret. An open correction is better then a secret
love. Pro. 27. 5. D. Heynes.

How Peter had a wife.
Look. Apostles.

How Peter suffered nothing for the truth against his will.
And lead thee whether thou would not. ^oh. 21. 18
Not that Peter suffered Peter's suffering.
ought for the truth of God against his will, for we read that he came with
joy and gladness when he returned from the Council, where he was whipped,
but because this will comes not from the flesh, ^ut from that gift of the
spirit which is given us from above, therefore he shows there should be a
certain striving and conflict or repugnacie which also is in us, in all our
sufferaunces, as touching the flesh. Theo. Beza.

How Peter's power was no greater then the rest of the Apostles.
As Peter was Christ's Uicar, even so was Paul and the other Apostles, and the
one no less then the other. If it be true that Saint Cipriane does write,
which is also consenting to Scripture. He says thus: That Christ spoke unto
Peter saying: I say (quoth our Savior) that thou art Peter, and upon this
Rock of stone shall I build my Congregation, Peter's power.
and the gates of hell shall not overcome it, to thee will I give the keys of
heaven and what thing that thou bind on earth, the same shall be bound in
heaven, and what thing soever thou shall loose upon earth, shall be loosed in
heaven also. And to him after his resurrection does Christ say: Feed my
sheep. And albeit he gave equal power unto all his Apostles after his
resurrection, and says: Like as my father sent me, do I also send you, take
you the Holy Ghost. If you shall retain to any man his sins, they shall be
retained if you shall remitte to any man his sins, to him they shall be
remitted. Nevertheless, because he would declare unity, he ordained by his
authority, the original of the same unity beginning of one. The other
Apostles truly were the same that Peter was, endued with equal partaking,
both of honor and authority, or power, but the beginning comes of one, that
the congregation should be showed to be one. These are the words of Cipriane
in a treatise called, De simplicitate prelatorum, where you may see that Christ
made all the Apostles of equal honor and like authority, notwithstanding
because he would testify the unity of his Church or congregation, he spoke it
as it were alonely to Peter, when he said: feed my sheep, and I shall give
thee Peter the keys of heaven: but in so saying, though the words seem spoken
to Peter only, yet they were spoken to him, in that he sustained the general
person of all the Church, being as it were a common speaker for the same. So
that in speaking to him Christ spoke unto al other the Apostles, unto whom he
gave all the same authority that he gave to Peter, as you may see both in the
words of Cipriane, and also the same is clearly showed of Saint Augustine in
diverse places, but no where more plainly, then in a treatise called De agone
Christiano. Lambart in the book of Mar. fol. 1278.

These words of Christ, August de Agone Chr. ca 30
Love thou me? Feed my sheep. When they are spoken to Peter, they are spoken
to al priests and ministers. He adds further, and says. Therefore wretched
men, while in Peter they understood not (Christ, that is) the Rock, and while
they will not believe, that the keys of the kingdom of heaven are given (not
to Peter alone but) unto ye church, they have quite lost the keys out of their
hands.

Peter when he received the keys, signified the holy Church. August in
Augustine.
John. Tract. 50.

So says Saint Basil: Basil.
Christ said to Peter, Love thou me, Feed my sheep, and in like sort unto
all Pastors and Doctors, he gave the same power, a token whereof is this, that
al others bind and loose equally as well as he. Basil. in vita sel^ taria. cha.
23.

Saint Ambrose says: Ambro. de digni. Sacer. cap. 2
Our Lord said to Peter: Feed my sheep, which sheep and flock, not only
blessed Peter then received, but he received the same together with us, and all
w^e have received together with him.

Christ (says S. Cipriane Cipriane.
) gave unto his Apostles like and equal power. Cipriane de. sim. p^ela.

Saint Bede Bid.
says: The power of binding and loosing, notwithstanding it seem to be given
only to Peter, yet without all doubt, we must understand that it was given
also to the rest of the Apostles. Bid. in Homil. in Euangel. Quem me dicunt.

If we speak that Peter spoke, Orig. in Mat. tra. 1.
we are made Peter, and unto us it shall be said, thou art Peter, for he is the
Rock, that is, the Disciple of Christ. Again, he that is bound with the
bands of his own sin, binds and loses in vain.

How Peter was never at Rome.
The mainteiners of the Popish kingdom do hold an opinion that Peter came to
Rome the second year of Claudius the Emperor, and dwelt there. 25. years, by
whose preaching Rome was brought to the faith of Christ, as both Eusebius and
Saint Hierome has written, say they. To this it is answered thus. Peter was
never at Rome.
Plain it is that Christ suffered upon the Cross, the. 18. year of Tiberius
the Emperor: who reigned 23. years. After him succeeded Gaius, and reigned
four years, then followed after Claudius. Now then if Peter came to Rome the
second year of Claudius, it must needs be granted that Peter came to Rome
within a. 11. years after Christ's death. Again on the other side it is
plain by the words of holy Scripture, that Paul was not only, not converted
to the faith, when Christ suffered upon the Cross, but it appears also that
he was not converted when Steven was stoned, for the Scripture is plain that
he kept their Garments which stoned Steven to death. This being so, Paul
himself writes to the Galathians, that he came to Jerusalem. 17. years
after he was converted, and that then he found Peter there, which was at the
least. 18. yers after the death of Christ. The^ if Peter were yet at Jerusalem.
18. years after Christ, how can it be that he came to Rome the second year
of Claudius, which (as they say) was the. 11. year after Christ's death.
Furthermore, Peter was at Jerusalem not only. 18. years after the death of
Christ, but the same time also was he sent to preach the Gospel, not to the
Romans, but to the Jews. And it is to be believed that he preched the Gospel
among the Jews. For when Paul wrote to the Romans, and saluted a great
many there by name, it is thought he would have saluted Peter also, if he had
then been the chief Bishop there. Wherefore it is a very false lie, that the
Papists historiograpers do write, that Peter was first Pope of Rome, and died
there. Bar. Och^^e.

Saint Hierome upon the Epistle to the Romans says, that he has read in
certain old books, that at the sending of this Epistle, Narcissus, whom
with his family Paul saluteth was then the Senior of the congregation at Rome:
Ergo not Peter. John Bale in the pageant of popes. fol. 9.

Of the shadow of Peter.
That at the least way the shaowe of Peter when he came by, Act. 5. 15.
might shadow some of them. God at the first publishing of his Gospel wrought
wonders by these things that seemed trifles to the world, Peter's shadovv.
which things as they were done for a time, so now the like must not be looked
for. The Bible note.

How Peter is but a figure of the Church.
To thee will I give the keys of heaven. To this Saint Austen says, that if
Peter there had not been the figure of the Church, the Lord had not said unto
him: To thee will I give the keys of the kingdom of Heaven. The which if
Peter received them not, the Church has them not, if the Church has them,
then Peter has them not. Philpot in the book of Mar.

PHARAO.
Whereof the word Pharao is derived.
AMbrose writes that the name of Pharao was not a proper name, but rather a
surname of al y^ kings of Aegipt: for at y^ time they were al called Pharaos, as
afterward they were called Ptolomei, when the Macedonians were the chief Lords
over all, as the Roman Emperors were called Caesar's, or Augusti: But
wherehence that word was derived at the beginning, this we may by conjecture
gather. This Hebrew word Pharao amongst other things, signifies to avenge,
and especial in the conjugation, Hiphil. Wherefore I think that the wise men
of the Egyptians, in those ancient times, meant by that surname, to signify
what manner a thing, the function and power of a king is, namely that, that the
Prince is the minister of God: who as Paul says to the Romans, Bears the
swoorde and is auenger against those that do evil. Wherefore the king of
Egypt so often as he heard, that his might call to memory that the auenging
of sins and wicked factes perteined unto his office: And the subjects being
terrified by that name, might be kept in true obedience: if yet it may be
admitted out of the Hebrew tongue to derive the Etimologie of an Egyptian
word, etc. Pet. Mart. upon the Romans fol. 264.

How Pharaos heart was hardened both by God, and himself.
Suppose that there were a Carter having many horses, which is continually
whipped forward, neither suffers he them to stand still: They being driven
forward must needs move: and as many as are whole and sound of legs go
uprightly: but if there be any amongst them that have lame or diseased feet or
legs, they also go when they are whipped forward, but yet slowly and evil
fauouredly, for they halt, but that halting should not be unless they were
driven forward. For when the horses stand still the halting is not perceived,
but the beginning of halting, that is the disease of lamenesse of the legs,
the horses have in themselves, and receive it not at the Carters hand. So God,
for so much as he by his mighty working perpetually moves and stirs us up,
makes us to light upon diverse occasions, which we (for that we are evil)
cannot use well. But in this similitude, this difference ought to be noted,
that it lies in the hand of God, by his liberal grace and spirit, to deliver
us from sin graffed in us by nature, when it lies not in the power of the
Carter to heal the diseased feet of the horses, etc. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans
fo. 265.

Why Pharao was called Leuiathan.
Thou brakest the head of Leuiathan. Psa. 74. 14
I am of opinion (says Calvin.) that Pharao and his army are betokned by way
of a Metaphore, because such manner of speech is very rife among the Prophets,
specially when they entreat of ye Egyptians, whose land was sustained with
fish of the Sea, and the river Nilus running through it. Not without cause
therefore is Pharao termed Leuiathan, by reason of the commodity of the Sea,
because he reigned there as a Whale in the water. Calvin.

PHARISEES.
What the Pharesies were.
THe Pharisees were among the Jews certain men, which professed a form of
living more straight and devout then other of that people, and were therefore
called by that name, for Phares in the Hebrew tongue signifies divided. They
professed continence, virginity, fast, and abstinence from meat, twice in the
sabbath days. They slept only upon boords, some upon stones, or else on
thorns, to keep them from stirring of fleshly appetite. They ware in their
foreheads scrowles of parchment, wherein were written the ten commandments
given by God to Moses, which they called Philaterias. They had in great
reverence their elders, insomuch that they would not with a word displease
the^. Notwithstanding they believed that all things happened by constellation,
and yet took they not away free will from man. They affirmed that souls are
immortal, and that God shall come to judgment. Hereby they came into
wonderful credence with people, whereby they drew to them great multitudes, and
of them were diverse good men, among whom was Saint Paul, Nichodemus, and
other, which afterward were Christ's Disciples, although the multitude taking
the profession for vain glory, perverted that honest form of living into
hypocrisy, deceiving the people, whom Christ sharply rebuked, and declared
their folly. And yet with some of them (which by likelihood were good men) he
dined, and otherwise used them familiarly. Eliote.

As concerning the Pharisees, Saduces, and Esses, read Josephus in his second
book De bello Iudaico. These were special sects among the people. The
Pharisees professed the more surer knowledge of right and customs of the law,
they were had in great vneration and reverence of the people, and they gate
unto themselves the greatest part of dominion and rule. Neither did they only
oppress the people with the burden of the prescript law, but also with their
own traditions, in the which thing the Saduces were greatly against them, as
we read in Josephus. But they are deceived which think them to be so named of
the division, as though they being separated from the order of the common sort
of people, might take a degree proper unto themselves. They were called also
Pheruss^^, that is to say, Interpreters: because not being content with the
simple letter, they profesied that they had the way to understand secret
mysteries. Whereof the^e arose a wonderful mixture and confusion of errors:
when as they taking to themselves the dignity of maistershippe, did with their
wicked lust and sense, and also with wonderful pride, thrust in steed of the
truth their own inventions, etc. Read Act. 23. 6. Marl. upon Math. fo. 45.

When the sect of the Pharisees began.
About the year before Christ. 150. through the wars and descention of the
Jews, there arose among them sundry sects and opinions in their religions, of
which there were three sorts. The first were called Pharesei, that is segregate
or chosen.

They used certain constitutions of men beside the law of Moses, by which
they were segregate from the residue of the people. They reputed themselves
better then all other. They observed fained fastes, prayed commonly in the
streets, that they might be seen and called masters. Their learning was
somewhat better then the others, for they taught the immortality after this
life, and that God would punish sin. They believed also Messiah to come, to save
such as believed, and to judge such as sinned. Lanquet.

Tindale supposes the Pharesies were righteous men, which had professed, not
as now, one Dominicke, the other Fraunces, and an other Barnardyns rules, but
even to hold the very law of God, with prayer, fasting, and alms deed, and
were the flower of perfection of all the law, As Saint Paul reioyseth of
himself, Phil. 3. 5. saying: I am an Hebrewe, and as concerning the law a
Pharesie, and concerning the righteousness of the law was faultlesse.
Tindale. fo. 201.

What the wickedness of the pharesies was.
The wickedness of the Pharesies was, the leaven of their Gloses, to the
moral laws, by which they corrupted the commandments of God, and makes
them no more Gods, and their false faith in the ceremonies, that the bare work
was a sacrifice and a service to God, the significations lost, and opinion of
false righteousness in their prayers, fastings, and alms deeds, that such
works do justify men before God, and not that God forgiueth sin of his mere
mercy, if a man believe, repent, and promise to do his uttermost to sin no
more. Tindale. fo. 202.

After what manner Paul commends the sect of the pharesies.
After the most straightest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharesie. He takes
the sect of the Pharesies to be perfect, because their doctrine was better then
the other sects. The Saduces denied the resurrection of the dead. The Esses
glorifieng in straightness of life, little regarded true doctrine. The Bible
note.

Paul speaks of this sect, according to the peoples estimation, who
preferred it as most holy above all other: for their doctrine was least
corrupt. Geneua.

How the pharesies added to the Scripture.
And hate your enemies. Mat. 5. 41.
This had the Scribes and Pharesies added to themselves, because of that which
is written. Exo. 34. 11. Deuteronomy. 7. 1. Iosu. 23. 7. 12. of having familiarity
with those nations.

What pharisaicall righteousness is.
Pharisaicall righteousness consists in outward works, void of the fear
of God and of faith in God, which as it looks for heaven at Gods hand, as a
reward for his works: so it hunteth for praise at men's hands, for the visour of
counterfait^ holiness. Hemmyng.

PHASHVR.
Of the cruelty of this Priest to Jeremy the Prophet.
THis Phashur was the high Bishop of the Temple, Iere. 20. 2.
the ringleader of false Prophets, and the chief heretiktaker, that is,
ouerthrower of true godliness. The dignity of Priesthood given unto him, he
abused. For he taught not, and reproved by the word, but feared the godly
with cruelty, he is not the greater man that strikes, but he is the
stronger that is stricken. He not only stroke, but also prisoned him, that
withstoode him not, but patientlye looked for the help of GOD. It is no new
thing (ye may see) for Bishops do persecute the Prophettes of the LORD,
for the preaching of the truth and constancy. T. M.

Thus we see, that the thing which neither the king, nor the Princes, nor the
people durst enterprise against the Prophet of God, this Priest, a chief
instrument of Satan, first attempted. Read Chapter. 18. 18. Geneua.

PHEBE.
What ministration this godly woman used in the Church of Cenchrea.
I Commend unto you Phebe our sister. Romans 16. 1.
Men think that this holy woman carried this Epistle of Paul to Rome. She had been a minister in the Church of Cenchrea, not indeed in teching publicly, but
in looking to ye poor, which were sustained at the charges of the Church. And
what manner of widows, either as touching age, or as touching manners were
required to that charge, it is at large set forth in the Epistle to Timothy.
By what manner of means, she was an help unto Paul, we know not, but it is
enough for us, our of this testimony of Paul, to understand that she had
oftentimes been beneficial, both to many others, as also to Paul himself.
She is here three ways commended, for that she was a sister, for that she was
a minister, for that she had given hospitality to many others, and to Paul
also, whereunto also may be added, that she was holy, for Paule^ straight way
adds, as it becomes Saints. Hereby it is manifest, the Christians that are
strangers, ought not only therefore to be received for that they are
brethren, but also for that they perteine to God, as Saints, and wholly
dedicated unto him. Cenchrea is a town nigh unto Corinth, and a port or haven,
longing to that town. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fo. 453.

PHIGELLVS.
Of hi^ heresy.
PHigellus and Hermogenes forsook Paul, and made shipwreck of their faith.
Heretic.
2. Tim. 1. 15. Abdias Babilonius says, that Philetus and Hermogenes said,
that Jesus was not the son of God.

PHILACTERIES.
What a Philacterie is.
THey make broad their Philacteries, Mat. 23. 5.
etc. They wear scrowles of parchment, wherein the commandments were written.
And to this day the Jews use the same, and close them in a piece of Leather,
and so bind them to their brows and left arm, to the intent they might have
continual remembrance of the law. Geneua.

A Philacterie was a certain paper or parchment, where the ten commandments
were written. And this day the Pharesies and Scribes put round about their
heads like a crown, thereby to persuade the simple and ignorant people, that
they were holy^ and that they did diligently keep the law. Sir. I. Cheek.

It was a third or ribband of blew silk in the fringe of a corner, the
beholding whereof, made them to remember the laws and ordinances of God. And
therefore was it called a Philacterie, as you would say a keeper. Nu. 15. 38.
Deuteronomy. 6. 8. which order the Jews afterward abused, as they do now adays
which hang S. John's Gospel about their necks: a thing condemned many years
ago, in the Council of A^tioch. Theo. Beza.

PHILIP.
Of the Martyrdom of Philip the Apostle.
PHilip the holy Apostle, after he had much labored among the barbarous
nations, in preaching the word of salvation to them. At length he suffered as
the other Apostles did, in Hierapolis a city of Phrigia, being there crucified
and stoned to death, where also he was buried and his daughters also with him.
Isido.

PHILOSOPHY.
What Philosophy is.
IT is nothing else but the observing and eschewing of such things, as reason
judges to be good or bad in the mutual conversation of life. W. Baldwyn:

Saint Austen says: If they which becalled Philosophers, specially of Plato
his sect, have spoken ought that is true, and appertinent to our faith, we
ought not only not to fear it, but also to challenge it as our own, from them
which are no right owners of it. For like as the Egyptians had not only Idols
and great burdens, which the Israelites did hate and fly, but also vessels,
ornaments, and goodly jewels of gold and silver, which the Israelites
departing from Egypt under the color of borrowing stole privily from them,
not of their own mind, but by the commandment of God to turn that to a
better use which the Egyptians abused. So in the doctrine of the Gentiles are
not only contained superstitious and feigned rites, with great burdens of
vain labor, all which we Christians following Christ out from among the
unbelieving Gentiles, should detest and avoid, but also much good learning
meet to serve the truth, how to worship the eternal, and only God. W.
Baldwyn.

Beware least any man come and spoil you through Philosophy and vain
deceites. Coll. 2. 8.
Paul here bids the Collo^sians take heed of such men, that with their
Philosophye went about to hinder the Gospel, to stop the prosperous success
of Gods wrode, abusing Gods gifts, rebuking the evil conditions of men, and
not dispraisi^g the art, for he himself was a great Philosopher. Now, if
Philosohye did set forth a false and untrue matter, that it confounded the
faith of many, how much more is it able to set forth the truth. Ridley.

Teaching you vain speculations, as worshipping of Angels, of blind
ceremonies and beggerlye traditions, for now they have no use, seeing that
Christ is come. Geneua.

PHYSIC.
By whom it was first invented.
AESculapius the son of Apollo was the first inuenter and practiser of
Physic, who for that science, the antiquity honored as a God. And such as
recovered from any disease, did sacrifice unto Aesculapius a live Cock. But
the Poets do fable that he was slain with lightening of Jupiter, because he
had with cunning of Physic restored Hippolitus the son of Theseus to life.
Vdal.

Of the woman that had spent all her goods in Physic.
Had suffered many things of many Physicians, Mar. 5. 26
and had spent all that she had. Here the woman is not blamed, because she had
spent and bestowed much substance upon Physicians, but rather we do learn,
that Physic ministered without God is unprofitable. Let us not then despise
Physic, which the highest did create from the earth, but let us resign and
put our whole will into the hands of God, whether he will heal us by physic, or
bring us to our grave. Sir. I. Cheek.

How God must be sought before the Physician.
He sought not the Lord but Physicians. 2. Pa. 16. 12
He shows that it is in vain to seek to physicians, except first we seek to
God, to purge our sins, which are the chief cause of all our diseases, and
after use the help of the Physician, as a mean by whom God works. Geneua.

PHOTINVS.
Of his heresy.
PHotinus Bishop of Sirmium maintained the heresy of Sabellius and Paulus
Samosatenus, Heretic.
that Christ was not God before Marie bare him. He said the word was at the
beginning with the Father, but not the Son. Socrates li. 2. cap. 24. Epiphan.
heraes. 71.

PIETY.
What Piety is.
Piety is a true worshipping of God, a soundness of doctrine, and a pure
ly^e, which things follow hope and faith. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 279.

Lactantius calls it justice, and devout worshipping and knowledge of God,
godliness, godly affection, natural love toward the parents and kinsfolk,

PILATE.
Of the Acts and death of this man.
THis man being ordained President of Judea, at his first entry to flatter
Tiberius caused the Image of Caesar to be brought into the Temple of
Jerusalem, whereby rose a great sedition, for so much as the Jews being
therewith grievously offended, offered themselves rather to the death, the^ they
would suffer any Image in y^ temple, Pilate in like manner used the treasure
called Corbona, contrary to the custom and law of the Jews, and because
diverse of the Jews showed themselves, to be grieved therewith, he beat and
slew a great number of them. And after the death of Christ (as witnesses
Tertulian) Pilate wrote to Tiberius the Emperor, of the death, virtue and
miracles of Christ, who after he had published the same in the Senate, would
have had Christ to be ascribed and numbered among the Gods of the Romans, but
the Senators would not consent thereto in any wise, because that Pilate
wrote to the Emperor and not to them. But Tiberius continued in his sentence,
and defended on pain of death, that no man should persecute the christen
people. Pilate at the last was commanded by Vitellius provost of Surrey, to go
to Rome, there to answer to certain complaints, which should be laid to his
charge by the Jews, for which accusations he was after deposed and banished
to Lions in France, where (as Eusebius says) he slew himself.

Of Pilate Josephus writes, he succeeded Valerius Graccus under Tiberius, and
was deputy of Judea ten years. About the eight year of his government he
crucified Christ. And two years after that being expired, he was put out of
his office by Vitellius deputy of Siria, for the innocent Samaritanes that
were slain, an other being put in his place, and he constrained to go to Rome
to purge himself in the judgment of Caesar against the accusation of the
Samaritanes. But before he came to Rome, Tiberius was dead and Gaius appointed
in his room. Under this Gaius (as Eusebius makes mention in his ecclesticall
history) Pilate slew himself. Marl. upon Math. fol. 685.

Of Pilates wife.
His wife sent to him saying: Mat. 27. 18
Have thou nothing to do with this just man, for I have suffered many things
this day in my sleep because of him. Only Matthew makes mention of this
thing concerning the wife of Pilate, which was done when Pilate was sitting
down on his Tribunal seat to give judgment of death against the Lord (
Have nothing to do with that just man,) As touching the Greek text it is
said, Thou have nothing to do with that just man. But the Hebrew text has:
Have thou nothing to do with that just man. Behold and note here how the
innocence of Christ deserved testimony of every one, namely, of Judas, of
Pilate, of Pilates wife, of Anna, of the false witness, of the wise men, of
the Cananites, of the Samaritanes, of the Centurion, and lastly of the these
hanging on the Cross. ( For I have suffered many things) although the
meditation and study in the day time might be occasion of this dream, yet
notwithstanding it is without al doubt, that the wife of Pilate suffered those
torments not naturally (as many do at this day oftentimes) but rather by
singular instinct and motion of God. Many have thought that the Devil suborned
this woman, and craftily colored the matter in her, that he might stay the
redemption of mankind, the which is very unlikely in all points, when as by
the motion and provocation of the Devil, the chief Priests and Scribes did so
greatly seek and desire to destroy Christ. Therefore we must this rather
think of it, that the innocence of Christ was proved by many means of God
the Father, to the end that it might appear, that he died not for his own,
but for others sakes. And for that cause he thought good to be absolved so
oftentimes by the mouth of Pilate, before he was condemned, that in his
innocent dampnation there might appear a lawful satisfaction for our sins.
But Matthew very expressly and plainly sets forth the matter, least any man
should marvel why Pilate was so careful and diligent to defend and contend
in the tumult of the people, for the life of a contemned man. And truly God
constrained him, by the terror of the dream which his wife suffered, to
defend the innocence of his son, not that he might deliver him from death,
but only to declare that he was punished for other men's faults. etc. Mar.
fol. 702.

Why the priests delivered Jesus to Pilate.
And delivered him to Pilate. Mar. 1^. ^
It was not lawful for them to put any man to death. For all causes of life
and death were taken away from them, first by Herod the great, and afterward
by the Romans, about forty years before the destruction of the temple, and
therefore they delivered Jesus to Pilate. Theo. Beza.

PLANT.
How this sentence following is expounded.
Every plant which is not of my fathers planting shall be plucked up. Some
understand this sentence of opinions, as if it should have been said, that all
the inventions of men, and whatsoever came not out of the mouth of God, must be
plucked and rooted out and perish. But Christ rather had a respect unto men: so
that these words are in effect, as if he should have said: that it is no
marvel that if the doctrine of salvation were mortiferous and deadly to the
reprobate, because they are always carried headlong into destruction.
Wherefore we must understand those to be planted by ye hand of God, which by
his free adoption are graffed in the tree of life. Marl. upon Math. fol. 336.

Every plant, Hilary in Mat. ca. 15
etc. That is to say, the tradition of man is to be rooted out, by the love
whereof they transgressed the commandments of the law, and therefore are
they blind leaders of the blind, promising the way of eternal life, which
themselves cannot see. And so being blind themselves and guides of the blind,
they tumble into the ditch together. I. Bridges. fol. 454.

All plants, Mat. 15. 13
etc. That is, all doctrines that are not grounded on the word of God shall
perish. Tindale.

All they that are not graffed in Jesus Christ by free adoption: and every
doctrine that is not established by Gods word. Geneua.

All kinds of religion and doctrine that is not of God, shall be plucked up by
the roots, only the word of God shall remain for ever. Sir. I. Cheek.

PLOVGH.
By what means the plough of Gods word goes awrie.
THe kingdom of Christ is a spiritual kingdom, which no man can minister
well, and a temporal kingdom too: Because that no man which puts his hand
to the plough and looks back, is apt for the kingdom of heaven. As Christ
answered. Luke. 9. Luke. 9. 26
unto him that would have followed him, but would first have taken leave of
his household. If a man put his hand to the plough of Gods word to preach it,
and look also to worldly business, his plough will surely go awry. And
therefore says Christ unto an other that would likewise follow him, but desired
first to go and bury his father, Luke. 9. 62
let the dead bury the dead, but come thou and show or preach the kingdom of
God. As who should say, he that will preach the kingdom of God (which is
Christ's Gospel) truly, must have his heart no where else. Tindale.

POLICRONICON.
What Policronicon is.
POlicronicon is as much to say, as a Chronicle of many times.

POLIGAMIE.
What Poligamie is.
POligamie is, when a man has many wives, or a woman many husbands. Bibhan.
fol. 27.

POOR.
How this place following is understood.
THe poor ye shall evermore have with you, Mar. 26. 11.
but me ye shall not have. Let good men hear this, and not be careful: for
this he speaks of the presence of his body. For according to his majesty,
according to his providence, according to his unspeakable and invisible grace,
it is fulfilled that he said: I am with you unto the consummation of the world:
But according to the flesh that the word received: according to that he was
borne of a virgin: according to that he was taken of ye Jews: according to
that he was nailed to the cross: according to that he was taken down, and
lapt in a shroud, and laid in a grave, and rose again and showed himself: In
this respect it is true that he said, ye shall not evermore have me with you.

He speaks of the presence of his body, when he says: The poor you shall
always have with you, but me shall ye not have always. For in respect of his
majesty, of his providence, and of his unspeakable grace, is that fulfilled
which he spoke: Behold I am with you always unto the end of the world: But in
respect of the flesh which the word took upon it. In respect that he was borne
of a virgin: that he was taken by ye Jews: that he was nailed to the cross:
that he was wound in a sheet: that he was laid into the sepulcher: that he was
manifested in the resurrection, you shall not have me with you always.

And why so? Because he was conuersaunt as touching his bodily presence forty
days with his Disciples, and they accompanieng him, but not following him, he
ascended into heaven, and is not here. For there he sits at ye right hand
of the Father. And he is here, for he is not gone hence in respect of the
presence of his majesty. Bullinger. fol. 1096.

What the complaint of the poor is.
He forgets not the complaint of the poor. Psalm. 9. 12.
The complaint of the poor, is the fervent desire and burning affection
wherewith they cry unto the Lord and be heard. By the poor in the scripture
are understood the afflict, which feel their need and temptation, and which
sorrow and lament, that the truth is ouertroden, which put no trust at all in
any thing that is in this world: yea, which are despised and forsaken of the
world, and cleave only to the living God, assured at his hand they shall
find help, though the world be never so extreme against them. And in the next
Psalm. T. M.

How the poor in spirit are blessed.
Blessed are the poor in spirit. Math. 5. 3.
That is to say, the rich that have not their confidence nor consolation in ye
vanity of their riches, and the poor that desi^eth not inordinatly to be
rich, but have their trust in the living God for food and raiment, and for all
that pertains either to the body or to the soul, for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven. Tindale.

None is poor in spirit, but he which being humble and lowly in his own eyes,
trusts only to the mercy of God. For they which are overwhelmed with
desperation, when they fret and fume against God, are puffed up with a lusty
and proud spirit. Marl. upon Mat. fo. 76.

Christ calls them here poor, Luke. 6. 20
which are poor in spirit, that is, which trust in no worldly thing, and are
forsaken and despised of other, being poor and contrite of heart, which often
do not prosper in the world, because they lead a godly life, and put their
whole trust and confidence in God. Tindale.

How the poor receives us into everlasting Tabernacles.
That when you have need they may receive you into everlasting habitations.
Luke. 16. 19
It is manifest that Christ receives the believers into everlasting
habitations: for eternal life is GODS gift by Jesus Christ. And where as it
is said, in this text that the poor shall receive us into everlasting
Tabernacles, it is meant, that they shall be as witnesses and aue^chers of our
faith. Tindale.

POPE.
Reasons of the Papists to confirm the Popes supremacy, answered. Their
first reasons.
AS the first begotten in the old Law was Lord over his brethren, even so,
because it is evident that Peter was the first begotten of Christ, he must be
Lord over all the rest, and supreme head of the whole Church of Christ, which
thing may be proved by that that Peter as the chief and most worthiest
person, speaks always first for them all, and amongst the rest, he was
always accounted and named first. Again, in any civil governance of man
(where the common wealths be well ordered) there is one supreme head, which
dignity of order, we see also observed even among brute beasts, for the Bees
have their king, who governs the baser sort of the common people, and ouersee
them to do their duties. The Cranes have one chief guide, whom all the rest
do follow. The Sheep also have their Shepherd, whose voice they know, and
whom they follow, and at whose Commandment they be.

Answer.
If the first begotten among the Apostles, ought to be Lord over all the rest,
then forasmuch as Andrew was called before Peter to the office of an Apostle,
Peter should not take the Lordship away from him, which of right should have a
better title unto it. But truth it is, that Christ is the first begotten among
his brethren, and he is only the Lord of all. And the worthiness of his
first begotten, which was shadowed in the first begotten of the old Testament,
is fulfilled in Christ himself. Now, because the kingdom of Christ is
altogether spiritual, he may be accounted greater, higher, and more excellent,
not that is first borne to Christ in this world, nor he that is richer or more
nobler after the flesh, nor he that is better learned: but he that excels
more in godliness, and has received more light and strength of the holy
Ghost. And whereas Peter used oftentimes to speak first because of his
boldness, yet follows it not of that, that he had authority and dominion
over the rest of the Apostles. And where the Bees have an head and governor,
yet it cannot be that one Be should govern all Bees in the world, but only
those that be in the same hiue. And one Crane to be guide to. xx. or. xxx.
Cranes, yet it is impossible that all the Cranes in the world should follow
this one Crane. So neither can it be that one Bishop can have the cure of all
the souls in the world: for experience teaches, that when one Shepherd has
the charge of a thousand sheep, it is as much as he is able to do to feed so
many and to order them well. If he cannot rule a thousand, much less can he
order 7. or 8. thousand. So that by these reasons, the Bishop of Rome may be
governor of all the souls within his own Diocese, and no further.

The. 2. reason.
As the Jews in the old Testament had (by the will of God) one chief Priest
above all other, so the Christen men now a days must have one Pope.

Answer.
The Jews in those days were but a few, and all knit and joined togethers in
one narrow place, whereas now the Christians be innumerable, and are dispersed
throughout the whole world, wherefore that thing which according to the will of
God was meet for them then (that is to say, that they should have one chief
Priest in earth) cannot agree now with us in these days. Nor the high
Priesthood of the Jews, shadowed not the high Priesthood of the Bishop of
Rome, but the high Priesthood of Christ. Wherefore that high Priesthood of the
Jews after a certain time had an end, Christ is the chief Priest, not after
the order of Aaron, but after the order of Melchisedech, not of the tribe of
Leuy, or of the stock of Aaron, but of the Tribe of Judah, and of the stock of
David. He was not chosen as other chief Priests be chosen of other Priests,
who do not always choose the best, but he was chosen of his eternal and
heavenly father, when he said: Thou art my son, this day have I begotten
thee. And the other chief Priests were anointed with a material Oil, but
Christ was anointed with y^ holy ghost. And they had on such garments as Moses
appointed by Gods commandment: but the apparel of Christ, was the whole
company of virtues. They offered incense and brute beasts, but Christ offered
himself upon the Cross. They entered into the Holy of the holiest, but Christ
entered into Heaven, and sits now at the right hand of the eternal father,
etc. So that Christ was chief Priest after the order of Melchisedech, which
was much more excellent then was the order of Aaron. Bar. Ochin.

The. 3. reason.
Unto thee will I give the keys of the kingdom of heauen^ and whatsoever thou
bindest in earth, shall be bound in Heaven, etc. Lo, says he, in that he
says, whatsoever thou bindest in earth, he excepteth nothing, therefore I may
make laws, and bind both King and Emperor.

Answer.
When Christ, Math. 16. 19.
as he had no worldly kingdom, even so he spoke of no worldly binding, but of
binding of sinners. Christ gave his Disciples the keye of the knowledge of the
Law of God, to bind all sinners, and the keye of the promise, to loose all
that repent, and to let them into the mercy, that is laid up for us in
Christ. Tindale.

The. 4. reason.
All power is given me in heaven and earth, Math. 28. 20.
go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptising them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to keep all
that I command you, and behold I am with you unto the worlds end. Lo, says
the Pope, Christ has all power in heaven and earth without exception,
therefore all power is mine, and I am above all Kings and Emperors in
temporal jurisdiction, and they but my servant, to kiss nor my feet only,
but my. N. also if I list not to have them stoop so low. Tindale.

Answer.
When Christ (as I said) because he had no temporal kingdom, even so he meant
of no temporal power, but of power to save sinners, which the process of the
text declares, by that he says: Go ye therefore and teach and baptize, that
is, preach this power to all Nations, and wash them of their sins, through
faith in the promises made in my blood. Tindale.

The. 5. reason.
The Priesthood being translated, Heb. 7. 12.
the law must needs be translated also, etc. Now says y^ Pope, y^ priesthood
is translated unto me, wherefore it pertains unto me, to make laws, and to
bind every man. Tindale.

Answer.
The Epistle means no such thing, but proves evidently, that the Ceremonies
of Moses, must cease. For the Priest of the old Testament, must needs have
been of the Tribe of Leuy, as Aaron was whose duty for ever was the offering
of Sacrifices. Wherefore when that Priesthood ceased, the Sacrifices and
ceremonies ceased also. Now that Priesthood ceased in Christ, which was a
Priest of the order of Melchisedech and not of the order of Aaron, for then he
must have been of the Tribe of Leui, and that he was not, but of the Tribe of
Judah, and of the seed of David. Wherefore they that are under Christ's
Priesthood are not under the sacrifices or ceremonies. And of this manner
iuggle they with all the Scripture, which falshoode least the lay men should
perceive with reading the process of the text, is all their fear, whatsoever
they pretend. Tindale.

More of the Papists reasons, for the Popes supremacy.
Peter drew his sword, Vide per era. to. 1. cou. to. to
and cut of Malchas ear: therefore the Pope is head of the Church. The world
was finished in. 7. days: therefore none must marry within. 7. degrees of
kindred. God made two great lights, the Sun and the Moon: therefore, as much
as the Sun is brighter then y^ Moon, so much y^ Pope is greater then the
Emperor. The Prophet says, Behold the face of thine anointed: this says the
Pontifical, is a Bishops prayer over the Popes Legate, when he kneeleth before
the Altar. Behold I send my messenger to prepare the way before thy face, says
God by the Prophet Esaias: the Pontifical, this is a Prophecy fulfilled when
the Popes Legate meets the Emperor, to receive him into any City. I have
found David my servant, and anointed him with holy Oil. My Love is
beautiful among the daughters of Jerusalem: this they apply to Kings and
Queens, when the Clergy receives them personally into their Churches. The
Prophet says. Sprinkle me Lord with Hisope, and I shall be clean: that they
apply to the Priest sprinkling with holy water. Lift up your heads O ye gates,
and ye everlasting doors, lift up your selves: that is, when the Clearke
opens the Church door, for the Priest to come in with the Cross on Palm
Sunday. Ten thousand such applications and expositions are in their books,
such as no bedlem man could devise more vain and foolish. Deering.

Look. Universal head.

How the Popes Doctors, prove him the head of the Church.
Nicolaus Cusanus says: The truth clea^eth fast to the Popes chair, therefore
the members united to the chair, and joined to the Pope, make the Church.

Johannes de parisijs says: Ioh. 10. 16
There shall be one flock and one shepherd, which thing cannot be taken of
Christ: we must needs understand it of some other Minister that rules in his
steed.

Hosius says, It is so necessary a thing, that one only man, over rule the
whole Church, that without the same the Church cannot be one.

The Canonists say, It is plain that therefore the Church is one, because that
in the whole universal Church is one supreme head, that is, the Pope.

They allege S. Hieroms words to the same purpose: The safety of the Church
hangs of the worship of the high Priest, meaning the Pope Peter's successor.
But S. Hierome meant not thereby the Bishop of Rome, but every several
Bishop within his own charge: every which Bishop he calls the high Priest.

Of the Popes triple crown, and signification thereof.
A man can receive nothing, John. 3. 27
except it be given him from above. If a man can receive nothing, except it be
given him from heaven, that howsoe^er human wisdom braggeth and boasts it
self, yet notwithstanding it cannot have in very deed, that which it has
not received from heaven, although the world attribute the same unto him.
Therefore although the Bishop of Rome to signify his power and authority, in
heaven, earth and in hell, wears the triple crown Triple crown.
on his head, and would have all men to worship the same, being herein like
unto Jupiter (of whom the Poet faigneth with the triple seepter, yet
notwithstanding, because he has received the same from Constantine as some
affirm and not from heaven, he shows himself to be vainglorious, and
nothing inferior in pride to Luciter. And whereas his faulters and defenders
object unto the Church it skilleth not, for it is not written h^ere by the
Evangelist, except it be given him from the Church, but he says, except it be
given him from heaven. Marl. upon John. fol. 90.

How the Pope blasphemeth God.
The Bishop of Rome ought to be abashed, ashamed, and to abhor his own
pride. For in this be outragiously does offend God, and blasphemeth The pope
blasphemeth.
him, in that he presumes to take this high name from our Bishop Christ, in
that he takes away (as much as lies in him) the glory of God, the Majesty
appertaining to Christ, in that he takes upon him these names only
appropriate to Christ. Summus Pontifex, maximus Pontifex, vniuersalis Pontifex.
The highest Bishop, the greatest Bishop, the universal Bishop of all the world.
I much marvel how he dare be so bold to usurp and take these great names
upon him. Greater blasphemy can there not be, then to take from God, that that
naturally belongs unto him, then to tak^ from God his glory and honor, then
to vindicate and take upon him such high names, as beseems no Christen man
to usurp. God said by his Prophet: Non dabo gloriam meam alteri, I will not
give my glory away to any other, to any creature, he does reserve that glory,
that laud and honor that belongs to him, unto himself, no man to attempt so
far, no man to take so much upon him. B. Langland in the b. of. Ma. fo. 1251

How the Pope is an Idol.
And the Lord (says Zachary Zac. 11. 15
) said unto me: Take yet unto thee the instrument of a foolish Shepherd, for
lo, I will raise up a Shepherd in the land, which shall not look for the
thing that is lost, nor seek the tender Lambs, nor heal that that is hurt,
nor feed that that stands, but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear
their claws in pieces. O Idol Shepherd that leaves the flock. The sword
shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye, his arm shall be clean dried
up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened. Who exercises this tyranny
over the people, and the Princes too, eating them to the bones, yea bones and
all, deposing them, destroieng them, and pilling their kingdoms with
insatiable extortions, but y^ Pope. The Popish gloses ascribe it to Antichrist,
The pope is an Idol
but they describe the Popes practices. A Pastor in the land (says Lyra) that
is, Antichrist to rule therein, that shall not visit the forsaken, that is, he
shall do no work of godliness, but shall be of great cruelty toward the
just, and therefore he says, and shall eat the flesh of the fat, that is by
spoiling of their goods, and tear their claws in pieces by afflicting and
killing them. Again, what Pastor may better be called an Idol than this
Antichrist the Pope? That is called an Idol (says Lyra) that is worshipped
for God, and is not God. And so shall it be of Antichrist, that shall sit in
the Temple of God as though he were God. O Pastor and Idol (says the Gloss)
thou art so wicked that thou shall not be called a worshipper of Idols, but
shall be called an Idol, while thou will be worshipped of men, who leaves the
flock to be devoured of Beasts, that the Lord had always kept. This Pastor
shall therefore arise in Israel, because the true Pastor had said, I will not
feed you. This Pastor by an other name, is called the Abomination of
desolation, that shall sit in the Temple of God, as though he were God.
Therefore the sword of the Lord shall be upon his right arm, and upon his
right eye, that the force of him, and all y^ bosting of his might, might be
dried up and withered away, and the knowledge that under a false name he
promised to himself, shall be^ obscured with eternal darkness. I. Bridges.
fol. 1092.

In what respect the Popish Church may be called Catholic.
As a certain scholar of Oxford, by a certain woman, whom other praised (did
merrily say) she was a Catholic Catholic.
woman, meaning a common queen. So the Popish Church in like sense is a
Catholic Church, that is to say, a common strumpet prostitute to all Idolatry,
and not the chaste spouse of Christ, etc. I. Bridges. fol. 165.

What the Pope says of himself.
I cannot err, I have all laws both temporal and spiritual in my breast: the
popes pride.
I am above all general Councels: I may judge al me^, but all ye world may not
judge me, be I never so wicked: I am king of kings, and lord of lords: I can do
whatsoever Christ himself can do: I am all and above all: all power is given to
me as well in heaven as in earth, etc.

What the Popes own law says.
If the Pope care neither for his own health, Distin. 40. Si Papa.
neither for his brothers, be found unprofitable and negligent in his works,
further, apt to no good, that hurts himself and other, leads with him
people innumerable by Legions unto the Devil, to be punished with him in
pains most dolorous for ever: being, Pope, no man should presume to reprehend
his faults, for he judges all men, and is to be judged of no man.

How the Pope has power over Angels.
The Pope (says Felinus) has Christ's lieuetenauntship, not only over things
in heaven, over things in earth, over things in hell, but also over the Angels
Angels.
both good and badde. Jewel. fol. 543.

How the Pope is the Devils Viceregent, and Antichrist.
It is most certain that the Pope is Uicar to the Prince of this world,
Viceregent.
and the Devil is said in the Gospel to be the Prince of this world. Who
doubts then, but if the Pope be Uicar to the Prince of this world, he is
Uiceregent to the Devil: and as Jesus Christ appeared to this world to undo
the works of the Devil, so likewise the Devil has made the Pope, who is his
Neatheard here upon earth, to appear to the world to undo the works of
Jesus Christ. And therefore the Pope studieng diligently to obey the will of
his Prince fully, is forced daily to be contrary to Jesus Christ, and what is
this but only to be Antichrist. F. N. B. the Italian.

POWER.
How neither Pope nor Priest has power to forgive sins.
THe word of God forgiueth sins, De poeni. did. 1. ver bum Dei.
the Priest is the judge, the Priest executes his office, but he exercises no
right of power.

The Lord has granted the office of baptising to many, Augu. de stal. Para.
but the power and authority in Baptism to forgive sins, he has reserved
only to himself. So says Ambrose, it is our part to remove the stone from
the grave, Ambr. de pen. li. 2 ca 7^
(by preaching, by counsel, and by exhortation) but it is the Lords work to
raise up the dead, it is the Lords work to bring him from the pit.

It is not the ambassador: Amb li. 9 Epist. 76
it is not the messenger, but the Lord himself that has saved the people: The
Lord remains alone. For no man can be partner with God in forgiving sins.
This is Christ's only office, that has taken away the sins of the world. And
yet is not the Priests office void of power. He has power and commission to
open the will of God, and as S. Paul says, to speak unto the people, 2. Cor.
5.
even as in the person of Christ. Tertul. de baptismo
So Tertulian says: The chief Priest, that is to say, the Bishop, has right
and power to give Baptime. But as S. Austen Augustine
says: God gave the ministry (of remission of sins) unto his servant,
but the power thereof, he retained unto himself, etc. Jewel. 158.

How all power is in and of God, and not in man.
Thou could have no power against me, Ioh. 19. 12
except it were given thee from above. Here we do learn, that all power is
of God. Yea, the power of darkness, which God causes to reign for our
sins and disobedience to him and his word. Job. 34. Whosoever therefore
resists any power, he does resist the ordinance of God, and so purchases
unto himself utter destruction and undoing. Let also Magistrates remember, of
whom they have received their power, and use their authority according to the
will of him, unto whom they must render account of all their doings. Sir. I.
Cheek.

How the higher powers are to be obaied.
The powers that be, are ordained of God. Romans 13. 2
We are bound in all manner of things to obaye the Magistrates, since that they
are the ordinance of God, whether they be good or evil, unless they command
Idolatry and ungodliness, that is to say, things contrary to true Religion.
Then ought we to say with Peter, We ought rather to obaye God then men.

But we must beware of tumult and insurrection. The weapon of a Christian man
in this matter, ought to be the sword of the spirit, which is Gods word, and
prayer coupled with humility and due submission, and with heart ready rather
to dye, then to do any ungodliness. Sir. I. Cheek.

Let every person be subject to the higher Powers.

This (says Chrysostom) is ordained to the Ecclesiasticall^ and Clergy, and
to the Monks or any other whatsoever it be. For thy obedience and subjection
does not alter thy service toward God. By what title (says Saint Barnard) is
it (speking of the temporal sword) that the Pope sells these things it is
not according to the right use Apostolical, for Saint Peter could not give
that which he himself had not, but he has left to his successors, that
which he had, to wit, the order of the Churches. Item, says he, your powers
are not over possessions, but over the sins, forasmuch as ye have received
the keys of the kingdom of heaven, not to be great Lords, but to have the
correction of vices, which dignity seems greatest to you, to forgive sins,
or to distribute possessions? There is no comparison. These earthly
superiorties have their Judges, which be Kings of the earth: And wherefore
usurp you the Office, dignities and lymittes of other men. Learn (says he)
to have a Spade to delue and dress the Uineyard of the Lord, and not to bear
a Scepter. And yet more it is (says he) a clear thing, that all Lordships is
forbidden to the Apostles. Go thou then which vsurpest the title of an Apostle
in ruling Lordlike, go where the authority and power is fette in the
Apostolic seat, etc. Theodore. Beza.

What absolute power is.
Absolute power is that, which is altogether free, and is neither governed or
restrained by the law or will of any other. The limited power is not free, but
subject to an absolute or greater power of another, which cannot of it self
do every thing, but that only that the absolute power or greater authority
does suffer to be done, and suffers it under certain conditions, etc.
Bullinger. fol. 837.

PRAYER.
What Prayer is.
Prayer is a mourning, a longing and a desire of the spirit to Godward, for
that which she lacks, as a sick man mourns and sorroweth in his heart
longing for health. Tindale. fol. 8^.

Again, Prayer is either a longing for the honor of the name of God that all
men should fear him and keep his precepts and believe in him: either to give
God thanks for benefits received: either a complaining and a showing of thine
own misery and necessity, or of thy neighbors before God, desiring him with
all the power of thine heart to have compassion and to suceour thee and them.
Tindale.

The true and acceptable prayer consists not in a rabblement of words nor yet
in the vehemency of the voice, but in the steadfastness of our belief, in the
beauty of our desires, and in the pure intentive thought of our hearts, fixed
on Gods divine mercy, at such time as we do pray.

God has given us a special commandment to pray, promising to hear and
grant our requests. Wherefore it is requisite when we power out our fervent
prayers unto God, that we have a special regard unto the promise, for except
the Lord had promised to hear us, we could obtain nothing by our prayers. And
whenever we obtain any thing in our prayer, we may not attribute the grant
thereof to our prayers or worthiness, but only unto his merciful promise.

Prayer (says Augustine) is the devotion of the mind, Augu. de spi. and an.
cap. 5.
that is to say the turning unto God by godly and humble affection, but we
(says Musculus) define it thus: that the prayer which may appear unto God, is
the affection and bewayling of an afflicted heart, whereby the aid of God is
most humbly besought, whether the same be done with words or without words, by
wayling alone and sighs. Masculus. fol. 485.

The right form and affection of prayer, Romans 8. 26
comes by the holy Ghost, who makes intercession tor us, not that he
prays and mourns, but that he so stirs our hearts, that we lift them up
to heaven earnestly and fervently, which is the true prayer.

Hear my prayer O God. Psa. 102. 1
True prayer is an earnest and affectious communication of the heart with God,
and a diligent consideration of the things that want in us, concerning the
seeking of his glory, and doing his will, with a burning and fervent desire
of the spirit, that requires him to repair and amend, that which wants in
us. Psa. 5. 1. Pro. 15. 29. Every godly with, also, is a good prayer. T. M.

What else is prayer, then a record of the faith that we have to Godward: for
by calling upon God without Hypocrisy, we witness openly that all our welfare
lies in him, and that he is the only party to whom we ought to fly for
succor.

And (to be short) by calling upon God we yield him the glory that belongs
unto him, and which he reserueth unto himself, etc. Call. upon Job. fol. 205.

The sincere prayer which is appointed of God, is used to inflame the heart of
man with a fervent desire to seek God always in true faith, and evermore to
have recourse to him in all his needs, and the rather to receive his benefits
with a thankful mind, when he is certefied by prayer, that all benefits do
come from his bountiful hand, and finally to confirm weak minds, so that
they shall not have cause to doubt in Gods providence, when they see God does
stir them up, yea, does command them to call upon him in their necessities
by Jesus Christ, and does promise them y^ he will hear their prayers through
the same Jesus Christ, whenever they call upon him, that they may render
thanks unto him, and glorify his holy name. Neither will God have us make our
prayers without his Temple, that is Jesus Christ his Son, in whom his Deity
dwells effectually. For as he has given us our being and the knowledge of
him, by the means of his Son, so will he likewise have us to ask of him by
this means, and not by any other. And therefore whosoever does pray and offer
up his petitions to any other then to God only, or does seek any other means
then Jesus Christ to offer them by, without doubt he does both against the
commandments, and against the promise of God, and does sin grievously in
Gods sight. F. N. B. the Italian.

Prayer is the ordinary instrument to attain all things that are needful
for us of God. Or thus: Prayer is a lowly listing up of y^ mind unto God, in
desiring ought at Gods hand, or yielding thanks for benefits received. Hemmyng.

We are taught by Ose how we should pray.
The Prophet Ose tells us how we should pray: Lord says he, Ose. 14. 2.
take away mine iniquity, and receive (if I have any) my goodness, and I will
give thee the Bullockes and Sacrifices of my lips.

The meaning of this place following.
But when thou praiest, Mat. 6. 6.
enter into thy chamber. The heavenly schoolmaster when he minded to set out
the best rule of praieng, commanded us to go into our chamber, and there the
doors being shut, to pray to our Father which is in secret, that our Father
which is in secret may hear us. of praieng in secret.
For when he has drawn them away from the example of Hypocrites, which with
ambitious boasting show of prayers, sought the favor of men, he therewithal
adds what is better, namely to enter into our chamber, and there to pray the
door being shut, in which words (as I expound them) he wills us to seek
solitary being, which may help us to descend and to enter thoroughly with our
whole thought into our heart, promising to the affections of our heart, that
God shall be near us, whose Temples our bodies ought to be. For he meant not to
deny but that it is expedient also to pray in other places: but he shows that
prayer is a certain secret thing, which both is chiefly placed in the soul,
and requires the quiet thereof, far from all troubles and cares. Call. in his
Insti. 3. b. cha. 20 sect^ 29.

Look. Chamber.

When thou with pray (says Christ) go into thy Closet, and shut the door upon
thee, and pray unto the father in secret. He spoke not to this intent to
restrain the prayers of his faithful unto chambers and closets, but to
admonish them that they should specially eschew the fault of ostentation and
boasting, which the Pharesies used in their prayers, praieng openly at the
corners of the streets, and in the Synagogues to be seen of men, and to be
taken for devout folk, and under that pretense to devour and spoil the houses
of widows, etc.

What do thou seek, an apt and holy place, when thou would pray unto
God? Cleanse thine own inward parts in scouring out all naughty desires from
thence, prepare thy self a secret corner in the quietness of thy heart. When
thou praiest in the Church, pray within thy self, and so do always, that
thou may be the Temple of God, for there God does hear where he does dwell.
Thus says he: by which words it appears sufficiently enough, that even in
his days many of y^ Christians were so fallen back to the superstitions of
Temples and Churches, not only in services but in prayers also, that they
thought the prayers were more effectual in Churches, then in other places,
which they took to be as profane, and not meet for prayer. Musculus fol. 489.

How prayer for the dead avails not.
When we be once departed out of this life, Cipriane.
there is no more place of repentance, there is no more effect or working of
satisfaction: life is here either lost or wonne^ everlasting salvation is
here provided by the due worshipping of God, and the fruits of faith. Then he
shall be without fruit of repentance, and grief of pain: In vain shall
weeping be, and prayer shall be of no force nor effect. Cypr. in his first
treatise against Demetrius.

We know in this world, Hierom
we can be helped one of another, either with prayer or with counsel, but
after we be come once before y^ judgment seat of Christ, neither Job nor
Daniel, nor Noe is able to pray for any body, but every man shall bear his
own burden. Hierom in his. 13. questi. etc. 2. chap.

When thou do hear that our Lord did rise again naked, Chrisosto^
cease I pray thee from the mad expense of the burieng, what means this
superstuitie and unprofitable dispense, which unto them that make it, brings
hurt, and no profit to the dead, but rather harm. Chrisost. in his. 48.
homil. upon the 20. of John.

For if he had not hoped that they which were slain should rise again, 2.
Mac. 12. 44.
it had been superfluous and vain to pray for the dead. From this verse to
the end of this Chapter, the Greeks text is corrupt, so that no good sense,
much less certain doctrine can be gathered thereby. Also it is evident, that
this place was not written by the holy Ghost, both because it dissenteth from
the rest of the holy Scriptures, and also the Author of this book
acknowledging his own infirmity, desired pardon if he have not attained to
that he should. And it seems that this Jason of Ceronean, out of whom he
took this Abridgment, is Joseph Bengorion, who has written in Hebrew. 5.
books of these matters, and intreting this place, makes no mention of ye
prayer for the dead. And though Judas had so done, yet particular example is
not sufficient to establish a doctrine, no more the^ Ziphorahs was to prove
that women might minister the Sacraments. Exo. 4. 25. Or the example of Razis,
that one might kill himself; whom this Author so much commends. 2. Mac. 14.
41. Geneua.

Truly I think that Judas believed that there should be a resurrection, as the
text praised him saying: Thinking well and denoutly of the resurrection of our
flesh, and they that believed were yet so rude and ignorant, that they thought
they should rise but to obtain a carnal kingdom, and have their enemies
subdued under them without rebellion. And thereto stick the Jews unto this
day. And it is most like that this should be his meaning, we shall all rise
again and possess this land in peace, and these men which are slain, are
out of the favor of God, because they have contrary to the law. Deuteronomy. 7.
took of the Idols oblations, therefore it is best that we send a Sacrifice to
Jerusalem to pacify ye wrath of God toward the^, lest when they rise again,
ye Lord should send some plague among us for their transgression which they
committed while they were here living. If any man can better guess, I am well
content to admit it. But this is plain though, he thought that this sacrifice
could not help them, before they should rise again, which does fully destroy
Purgatory: for where he says that it were void and vain to pray for the
dead, except they should rise again, is even as much to say unto him that
has any wit, as that this prayer and sacrifices can do them no good, before
they be risen again from death: for else were it not in vain to pray for them,
although they should never rise again. As by this example, if I say to a man,
that he shall never obtain his purpose, except he should sue to the kings
grace, it is even as much to say to a man that has any wit, he shall never
obtain his purpose, before he has su^d to the Kings highness. I. Erith.

It were an hard matter for a man to teach ye there were any sacrifices, and
prayers used in ye Apostles time for ye faithful when they were departed. But
afterward it fell out by ye good zeal of the Bishops, y^ there was a solemn
remembrance kept of the^ which died in ye Lord, specially of Martirs, and there
were also sacrifices offered, I mean of thanksgiving, but they were not done
for ye dead to avail to their salvation, but for y^ faithful y^ were alive,
that their hearts might be the better confirmed in the faith of Christ. Of
these sacrifices, Cypriane makes mention, how they used to offer sacrifices
for ye martirs, Laure^tius, Ignatius and y^ rest. Wherefore it appears that
they had not the same manner of Sacrificing for the dead at that time, as it is
now used in the Popery. They did sacrifice for the Martyrs, but so that they
did not pray for them at all, as Augustine does also testify, so that this
sacrifice for the dead, had no prayer for them joined withal, but for the
faithful which were alive. Musculus. fol. 493.

To lean (says Ireneus) upon the holy Scriptures, Ireneus against Valentinus.
which are the sure and undoubted truth, is to build his house upon a sure
and strong Rock. But if leaving it (I mean the truth of the Scriptures) any
man do stick to some other doctrines, the same is to build his house upon the
unsteadfast Sand, where it shall easily fall. Holy scripture allows no praieng
for the dead.
The Canonical Scriptures make no mention at all of the praieng for the dead,
therefore (says Ireneus) if we do follow the doctrines of men in this point,
it is none other but to build upon the unsteadfast Sand. I. Veron.

We do (says Ambrose) condemn by right all new things that Christ has not
taught. Ambrose de vir li. 4
For Christ to the faithful is the way: if Christ therefore has not taught
this that we teach, we do also judge it detestable. If it cannot be proved by
Christ's holy Gospel and word, that he has not taught us to pray for the
dead, then whosoever teaches that doctrine, we may judge it by the word of
Saint Ambrose, to be detestable. I. Veron.

We do make Sacrifices and Oblations for the dead, every year on a certain
day says Tertulian. Tertulian
This with another place of Cypriane Cipriane.
does the Papists object, to make for the praieng for the dead.

Answer.
This word Oblation and Sacrifice, among these ancient Writers) is taken for
an Hymn of laud and praise, and for an earnest thanksgiving, or else for a
thankful and solemn commemoration or remembrance of them y^ were dead in the
faith of our savior Jesus Christ. For in the old time when any of the
brethren was deceased, the Superintendent, Bishop or Minister, did give
thanks unto God for him. And sometime made a funeral Sermon, as Ambrose did
for Theodotus.

The people did also pray and thank God that he had vouchsafed to call their
christen brother or sister out of this world in the faith of his son Jesus
Christ, beseeching him that he would give them grace to depart in the same
belief. I. Veron.

How prayer in a strange tongue profits nothing.
The Greeks name God in the Greek tongue, Origin.
and the Latins in the Latin tongue, and all several nations pray unto God
and praise him in their own natural and mother tongue, for he that is Lord of
all tongues, hears men praieng in all tongues, Prayer in a strange tongue.
none otherwise then if there were one voice pronounced by diverse tongues, for
he that rules the whole world, is not as some one man that has gotten the
Greek or Latin tongue, and knows none other. Origin in his. 8. book
against Celsum.

What profit is there in speech be it never so perfect, Augustine.
if the understanding of the hearer cannot atteine unto it. For there is no
cause why we should speak at all, if they understand not what we speak, for
whose sake we speak, that they may understand us. August, in his. 4. b. and.
10. chap. of Christ, doct.

Unless I speak that you may plainly and clearly understand, Chrisosto^
but only show my self to have the gift of tongues, ye shall depart away,
having no fruit of those things that ye understand not. For of a voice that ye
know not what profit can ye have. Chrisost. in his. 35. Homil. upon the. 1.
Cor. 14.

Some entering into the Church, Chrisosto^
stretches forth and draws at length their prayer, till they have said a
thousand verses, as though the great number of words were needful before God,
as though he knew not what thou do ask, which know before thou think:
Prayer stands not in many words.
even they wot not what they say. Their lips only moves, and their mind is
without fruit, and his ears are unto them deaf. Thou hear not, that is,
understand not, and take no heed of thy prayer, and yet thou will that
God shall hear thy prayer. Chrysostom in his. 12. Homil. of the woman of Cana.

Of Common prayer.
Saint Basil Basil.
in the using of Common prayer in his time says thus: In our prayers that we
make unto God, we raise up such a sound of the voices of men, women, and
children, prayeng togethers, as if it were the noise of the waves beating
against the sea banks. By this it appears that in. S. Basils time, men,
women, and, children, song in the church altogether.

Of prayer and fasting.
This kind goes not out but by prayer and fasting. Mat. 17. 21
Satan and the flesh which are our most mortal enemies, are overcome by faith,
Prayer and fasting.
prayer, and true abstinence or soberness of living, if we use the same
according to Gods word and the doctrine of Christ. Sir. I. Cheek.

The best remedy to strengthen the weak faith is prayer, which has fasting
added unto it, as an help to the same. Geneua.

How prayer ought to be made according to Gods will.
Saint Austen upon the forty Psalm says, Call upon God with praise and
thanksgiving, and not with reprehention, for why when thou call upon him
to destroy thine enemy, when thou will rejoice of an other man's hurt, and
call God to that evil, Our prayer must be after gods will.
thou make him pertaker of thy malice. For why? thou supposest God to be as
thou art, therefore it is said unto thee in an other place: These things have
thou done, and I held my peace. O thou wicked creature, thou do conjecture
that I would be like thee. Hitherto Austen. Now therefore our prayers must be
made after the rule of the Lords, and we must evermore pray with these
exceptions, Thy will be done and not ours. Biblian. fol. 109.

What modesty ought to be used in prayer.
Let these words (says Cipriane) and prayers of such as pray, be orderly
governed, keeping modesty and shamefastness. Let us think we stand in the
sight of God. Prayer standing, kneeling, lieng, or sitting, is allowed in holy
Scripture.
God his eyes must be delighted, both in the iesture of our bodies and manner
of our words. For as it is the part of an impudent person to use clamorous
shoutes in praieng, so contrariwise, it beseemes a shamefast person, to pray
with modest prayers.

Some foolishly imagine that prayer is made either better or worse, by the
iesture of our bodies. Therefore let them hear Saint Austen. li. 2. ad
Simplicianu^. quest. 4. saying. It skilleth not after what sort our bodies be
placed, so that the mind being present with God, bring her purpose to pass.
For we both pray standing as it is written, the Publicane stood a far of:
and kneeling, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles: And sitting as did David
and Helias: And unless we might pray lieng, it should not have been written
in the Psalms, every night wash I my bed. For when any man seeks to pray, he
places the members of his body after such a manner, as it shall seem most
meet unto him for the time, so stir up his devotion. Bullinger. fol. 929.

To pray continually, how it is understood.
There were a sort of heretics Massaliani of their first Captain Massalianus,
which under the pretense of long praieng, did study to live idly, and
condemned all manner works and labor of the hands, alleging for
themselves a great sort of Scriptures, but specially this place of Saint
Paul: Orate sine intermissione, do ye pray continnallye, 1. These 5. 17
to this they joined the example of the primitive Church, Act. 12.
which when Saint Peter was ^ast in prison by Herod, prayer was made without
ceasing of the congregation unto GOD for him. Luke. 18.
Also that our Savior Christ did teach his Disciples, that they should always
pray and never cease. And also that the Prophet David says, I will always
praise the Lord, Continual praieng.
evermore shall his praise be in my mouth. Upon these places did these
heretics ground their errors, which they understood not aright. For God has
set this general order for all men: Deuteronomy. 5. 13
Six days shall thou work and do therein all thy business, but upon the
seventh day thou shall do no bodily labor, neither thou nor thy servant,
nor thy cattle, for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea,
and all that therein is, and upon the seventh day he rested, and so shall
thou. Saint Paul says, he that labors not, 2. The. 3. 10
let him not eat. 1. Tim. 5. 8
And again, if any provide not for his own, and specially for them of his
householde, the same has denied the faith and is worse then an Infidel. And
so he commands servants to be seruable unto their masters, and to do
their work truly behind their backs, as well as before their faces. Now to
declare y^ true meaning of such scriptures as seemed to make for the
Massalians. S. Austen Augustine.
says on this wise: All such places of the Scriptures as seem to commend
continual praieng, are to be understood of the learned, the fervent and
perpetual desire that we ought to have to pray, whereof we have an example in
that holy widow named Anne, Luke. 2. 36
the daughter of Phanuel: Quae non discedebat de Templo, ieiunijs ac
deprecationibus ^eruiens nocte ac die. In which words we must grant the
tropicall speech called Hiperbole. For it cannot be avoided but that this holy
woman did eat, drink, and was sometime occupied about her necessary business
at home. But because she was most commonly in the temple praieng, therefore the
Evangelist says, that she was there night and day: So that the Saints do
fulfill this Scripture, praieng continually, when they pray often and fervently
to God. Question Long prayer.
And if any man now should ask this question, forasmuch as Christ has
forbidden much babbling in the time of praieng, whether do they ^in or no, which
do pray long. To this is answered thus: In a case they sin, and in a case
they sin not, but do very well and godly. In case they put their trust in
their long praieng, thinking that therefore they shall be heard as the Gentiles
do, then they sin as they do, and are condemned by the sentence of Christ
in the Gospel: But if they pray long with fervent faith and true devotion,
then they sin not: no though they pray with often repeating of one prayer:
but they follow ye example of Christ, which in mount Oliuete did oftentimes
repeat one prayer, which in effect was none other but this: Pater si possibile
est, transeat a me calex iste. Wherefore Saint Austen most holyly and truly
makes a distinction betwixt Multum loqui, and multum precari: Much babbling and
long praieng. To pray long with godly and devout exercising of the heart, it is
a good thing: but to ask a good thing with superfluous and an unprofitable
heap of words, the mind not occupied, it is naught. And again says S.
Austen: How can any man condemn long prayer, seeing that of Christ it is
written. Quod pernoctauit in orando, that he was occupied all night in prayer.
But this do I counsel says Saint Austen, Ad probam: Si quis nausiam, If any
man supposes lothsomenesse to arise of long praieng, let him well consider,
although it be not long, yet often it is lawful to pray And whatsoever he be
that so shall pray often, he shall nevertheless fulfill the example of the
Prophet David, which says to the provoking and teaching of all other men to
pray often. Benedicam Dominum in omni tempore, and semper laus ^ius in ore
meo: I will always praise the Lord, and evermore shall his praise be in my
month. Ric. Turnar.

Like as he that is in prison desires ever to be delivered, whether he be
eating, drinking, or sleeping, and as he that is sick destreth always to be
whole, even so does every christen man pray continually, yea, even when he
seems not to pray. For prayer consists not in much babbling. Mat. 6. 7. but
in spirit and verity. John. 4. 24. and in vehement desire of the heart
toward God. Tindale.

What the prayers of Saints in the Apocalips means.
And when he had taken the book, Apoc. 5. 8.
the four beasts and the. 24. elders fell down before the lamb, having
every one harpes and golden Uialls full of odours, which are the prayers of
the Saints. And in an other place of the same book he says: And an other
Angel came and stood before the altar, Apoc. 8. 3.
having a golden censour, and much of odours were given unto him, that he should
offer the prayers of ye Saints upon the gloden altar which is before the
throne. These places the Papists do allege for the invocation of Saints.

Answer.
Ye must understand that there be two kind of prayers, the one is invocation
or petition, and the other is giving of thanks, laud, and praise. The
petition if need were, might be proved by the fourth Chapter of the Epistle to
the Philippians. We call that invocation when we desire some good thing to be
given unto us, or some evil to be taken away from us. Giving of thanks does
contain, the praising and lauding or magnifieng of the name of God, for his
exceeding great benefits which we receive daily and hourly at his hands. It is
manifest by y^ which follows that the Apostle does speak of the last, and
not of the first. These be the words, and they song a new song, saying: Thou
art worthy to take the book, and to open ye seals thereof, because thou wast
killed and have redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred and
tongue, and people, and nation, and have made us unto our God kings and
Priests, and we shall reign on the earth. Now what does this make for the
intercession of the blessed spirits or souls that the Saints do sing praises
unto God in heaven. In the other place is meant none other but that the Angel
did join his laud and praise which he gave unto God with the Hymns and
songs of the elect. Saint Austen expounding this place writes thus: Alius
Angelus, ipse est Jesus Christus, etc. The other Angel (says he) is Jesus
Christ, having a golden censour, which is an holy body: for the Lord himself
was made a censour, out of the which God received a sweet odor, and was made
merciful unto the world, for he offered himself a sacrifice of sweet
smell, and the Angel did take the censour, and did fill it with the fire of
the altar. Jesus took a body that is to say, the Church, and did fill it with
the fire of the holy Ghost.

The meaning of this place following.
Withdraw not your selves one from an other. 1. Cor. 7. 5.
S. Paul speaks not this of that kind of prayer that is commonly and daily
used of all faithful, Married folks.
as well married as unmarried, but only of the general and solemn prayer of
the whole congregation, which then as in time of persecution and fear of
enemies was kept only in the night: And all the whole multitude of the
faithful was charged to be present at the same. At which time it was
necessary, that both the man and the woman should leave the others company
and resort to prayer. To this read Joel. 2. at the place, Blow up the trumpet
in Syon. Jewel. fol. 172.

A prayer for the King and chief governor.
Exaudiatte Dominus in die tribulatione, protiget te nomen Dei Jacob. Psalm. 26.
1.
The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble, the name of the God of Jacob defend
thee. These words be words of prayer, and to be offered unto God for the
preservation of the king. Therefore when ye do pray and say: The Lord hear
thee, understand (for example) by this word (Thee) our king or chief
governor, and then the prayer is plain. And here by the way, note that the
Prophet says, not as the old superstition was wont, our blessed Lady and all
the whole company of heaven hear thee, for the^ he had taught us to call upon
creatures, which can neither hear us nor help us: but the Prophet as he does
always, so he does here teach us to cry unto God himself in the day of
trouble, And in that he says the name of the God of Jacob defend thee, it is
nothing else to say, but the power and the might of the most high omnipotent God
of Jacob defend thee. Ric. Turnar.

What private prayer is.
Private prayer is made unto God by every faithful man, in what place so ever,
either in the house, or without doors, in the closet of his heart, and temple
of his own body. For S. Peter went up into the uppermost part of the house and
prayer. Act. 10. 9. S. Paul. 1. Tim. 2. says: I will therefore that the men
pray every where, lifting up pure hands. And Christ our Lord himself very often
departed even out of ye temple into the mount to pray. And in the Gospel Mat.
6. he says: When thou praiest, enter into thy chamber, and when thou have shut
the door, pray to thy father which is in secret, etc. Bullinger.

Of public prayer.
Public prayer is that which is used unto God in the holy assembly, according
to the accustomed order of every Church. Bullinger. fol. 914.

PREACHERS.
What doctrine preachers ought to teach.
TEaching them to observe all things, Mat. 28. 20.
whatsoever I command you. Here do all Preachers learn what they should
teach, nothing else but Gods word, nothing else but that the Lord has
commanded them. Not their own dreams and inventions. Sir. I. Cheek.

Men may not teach their own doctrine, but whatsoeuer^ Christ has taught, for
he reserueth this authority to himself, to be the only teacher and author of
the doctrine. Geneua.

That we must not presume of inspiration without preaching.
Saul was sent by the vision to Damascus to Ananias to be instructed, and yet
we may not despise the meanest minister that teaches us, for Ananias and
Philip were mean and obscure and unknown men, this is not notable, yet Paul
who was notable and instructed at the fee^e of Gama^^el, was sent unto them by
the vision. Cornelius was sent to Peter. The Eunuch understood not till Phlip
came unto him. David could not understand ye ridle of Nathan, until it was by
Nathan himself expounded.

How Preachers ought not to yield to the wicked.
Moses said to Pharao, Euo. 10. 26
there shall not one hoof thereof be left, for thereof we must serve the Lord
our God.

What weapons the preachers must use.
They must fight with the word, Ambrose.
and not with the sword, their weapons are prayers and tears,

What Preachers may fly, when and in what place.
But if it be in such a case that the minister alone is sought after by the
enemy, or be forsaken of them which were his congregation, or if no ruin or
detriment ensue unto the congregation by his departing, then is there no cause
why he may not reserve himself for a more commodious season. But they that
forsake the public cause of the congregation, and go from them that hold
fast the profession of faith, these indeed be Apostatus and hirelings, who
Christ says use to fly, when the woolfe comes. John. 10. 5. We ought to
follow Saint Ambrose, who denied to deliver his Churches to the Arrians,
although y^ Emperor commanded. Gualter Suelacts. fol. 358.

This saying, Mat. 10. ^3
when they persecute you in one city, fly to an other, etc. was spoken unto
the Apostles, because the building of the Church depended upon their preaching,
who were also but few in number. It was meet therefore that they should be
preserved, until the work were ended. But once having persuaded their
congregatio^s to the faith, and having ended their work, it was meet that they
should refuse to fly, and seal^ their doctrine with their ^loud, as they did
indeed, because then the ^earcitie of Preachers being helped, it was meet
that the members of new conuerts should be confirmed, etc.

Of general preaching.
By the use of general preaching, neither had David been touched by Nathan to
repentance, nor Herod been touched by John Baptist to grief. For he that
speaks generally, speaks to no man.

PREDESTINATION.
What Predestination is.
PRedestination is Gods everlasting and unchangeable ordinance, going in
order before all the causes of salvation and dampnation, whereby God has
determined to be glorified, by some by saving them of his own mere grace in
Christ, and in other some by dampning them through his rightful judgment in
Adam, and in themselves. And after the custom of the Scripture, we call the
sormer sort, the vessels of glory, and the elect or chosen, that is to say,
folks appointed to salvation before the world through mercy: And the other
sort we call reprobates or castawayes and vessels of wrath, that is to say
appointed likewise to rightful dampnation from everlasting, either of both
which, GOD has known severally from time without beginning. Theo. Beza.

By the eternal Predestination of GOD, is understood his eternal ordinance,
whereby he has ordained before the creation of the world, that which he
has determined to do with all men, to be glorified in them, as well in his
mercy, as in his just judgment. In his mercy he is glorified in showing, the
riches of his glory in his vessels of mercy, which are his chosen, y^ which
he has prepared to glory in the just judgment, he is glorified in showing his
wrath, and giving to understanding his power, after that he has endured in
great patience, the vessels of wrath prepared to perdition. P. Viret.

I think it best (with this definition) to begin with that that the Logitians
call ( Quid nominis) what the word signifies. The Grecians call
Predestination Ouproris non, of this Uerbe Cuporitas, which signifies to
determine and appoint before. For Oros, is Terminus, that is a band or limit.
Wherefore the elect are separated a sunder from them that are not elect, the
Latin men call it Praedestinatio. For Destinare is nothing else, but firmly
to determine and constantly to appoint any thing in the mind, or by some
firm decree of the mind to direct any thing to some one end.

But Predestination which we speak of, may be taken two manner of ways:
either as touching the bringing of it to the effect, as that Paul going to
Damascus, was converted to Christ, and by that means separated from the
unbelievers: Or inasmuch as it was with God from eternity, before men were
borne. Of this Paul speaks writing to the Gala^hians, Gal. 1. 15.
that he was set aparte to preach the Gospel from his mothers womb, long
before he was converted. And unto the Ephesians Ephe. 1. 4.
also he says, that we were predestinate before the foundation of the world
were laid.

And to the Romans, Romans 9. 13
of the Twins he says: before they had done either good or bad, Jacob have
I loved, and Esau have I hated. And we at this present speak of this eternal
Predestination of God. Wherefore the other is nothing but a declaration of
this. Predestination therefore may be taken both commonly and properly. But
for so much as God does all things by an appointed Counsel, and nothing by
chance or fortune, undoubtedly whatsoever he creates or does, he appoints
to some end and use: After this manner neither the wicked nor the Devil
himself, nor sinners can be excluded from Predestination, for all these
things does God use according to his will, etc. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol.
291.

Augustine Augustine
in his book De Predestinatione sanctorum, the 10. Chapter, thus defines
Predestination, that it is, a preperation of grace. And in the. 12. Chapter he
says, it is foreknowledge and a preparation of the gifts of GOD, by which they
are certainly delivered which are delivered: but the rest are left in the mass
and lump of perdition. In an other place he calls it the purpose of having
mercy. The Master of the Sentences Master of the sentence.
in the first book, Distinct. 40. defines it to be a preparation of grace in
this present time, and of glory in time to come. These definitions I reject
not. Howbeit because they comprehend not the whole matter, I will bring in an
other definition more full, as nigh as I can. I say therefore that
Predestination is the most wise purpose of GOD, whereby he has before all
eternity constantlye decreed, to call those whom he has loved in Christ to
the adoption of his children, to justification by faith, and at length to
glory through good works, that they may be made like to the Image of the
son of God, and that as then should be declared the glory and mercy of the
creator. This definition as I think comprehends all things that perteine
unto the nature of Predestination, and all the parts thereof may be proved by
Scripture. Pet. Mart. upon the Romans fol. 292.

Predestination we call the eternal and immutable decree of God, by the which
he has once determined with himself what he will have to be done with
every man. For he has not created all to be of one condition. Or if we will
have the definition of Predestination more large: we say that it is the most
wise and most just purpose of God, by the which before all times, he
constantly has decreed to call those whom he has loved in Christ, to the
knowledge of himself, and of his son Christ Jesus, that they may be
assured of their adoption, by the justification of faith, which working in them
by charity, makes their works to shine before men, to the glory of their
Father, so that they (made conform to the Image of the same God) may finally
receive the glory which is prepared for the vessels of mercy. These latter
parts (to wit, of vocation, justification of faith, and of the effect of the
same) I have added for such as think that we imagine it sufficient that we
be predestinate, how wickedlye soever we live. We constantly affirm the
plain contrary, to wit, that none living wickedly can have the assurance
that he is predestinate to life everlasting, yea, though man and Angel would
bear record with him, yet will his own conscience condemn him, unto such
time as he unfeignedly turn from his conversation. Knox.

Who has predestinate us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ. Ephe. 1.
5.
This is the true understanding of Predestination, that without any merits or
deseruings of ours, yea, before the foundation of the world was laid, GOD has
decreed with himself to save through Christ, all them that do believe.

How Predestination was the first work that God made.
God before the be^inning of the world, did work but only the work of
Predestination, of the which Saint Paul says Ephesians. 1. GOD has
predestinate and chosen us to him through Christ our Lord before the foundation
of the world was laid. So that the work of Predestination was the first work
of God Predestination the first work that God made.
that we do read of in the scripture, which was perfectly finished before the
world began. The second work of God, was the work of creation, Crea^ion the
second.
that is, of making all things of nothing. Of this work it is written: Qui
viuit in eternum creauit omnia semel. He that lives everlastingly, without
beginning and without ending made all things at once. By all things is
understood the matter and substance, whereof all things was afterward made,
which is called of Moses Coelum and terram. That undigested and vnshaped and
unfashioned lump, called of the Poettes Chaos, whereof all the Firmament and
the four Elements were afterward made, that was made by the work of
creation, Idque semel, and that all at once. The work of creation being
ended, God proceeded to the dividing and setting of things in order, which is
called Opus distinctionis. Opus distinctionis.
And in this work we read that GOD was occupied six days.

This work being ended, almighty God ceased from making of any mo new
things, and yet he nevertheless works continually, in the redressing, in the
preserving, and in the governing of the things that he has made. Indeed upon
the sixth day he made man, and blessed him with the strength of generation in
his posterity unto the end of the world, by virtue of which blessing all men
do increase, do multiplye, do flourish and come into the world. And yet
notwithstanding that work of the sixth day, God still a pace works by his
divine providence and governing of man wonderfully, which is called Opus
gubernationis. Opus gubernationis.
for the which his work we are bound every man to praise him and to magnify
him according as we be taught by the prophet in the Psalm, saying in the
person of Christ: O Father: Tues qui extraxisti me de ventre, etc. Thou art he
y^ tookest me out of my Mothers womb. Ric. Turnar.

No reason can be given, why God did predestinate this man more then that, but
only that it was his pleasure so to do.
I ask, how came it to pass that the fall of Adam did wrap us in eternal
death, so many nations with their children being infants, without remedy, but
because it so pleased God? Hear their tongues which are otherwise so prattling,
must of necessity be dumb. It is a terrible decree I grant, yet no man shall be
able to deny but y^ God foreknew what end man should have, ere he ^reated him,
and therefore foreknew it, because he had so ordained by his decree If any man
here inueigh against the foreknowledge of God, he rashly and unadvisedly
stu^bleth. For what matter is there I beseech you why the heavenly Judge should
be accused, for y^ he was not ignorant of y^ which was to come? Therefore if
there be any just or coulourable complaint, it touches Predestination.
Neither ought it to serve an absurdity which I say, that God foresawe not
onley the fall of the first man, and in him the ruin of his posterity, but
also disposed it after his own will. For as it belongs to his wisdom to
foreknow all things that shall be. So it belongs to his power to rule and
govern all things with his hand^ And this question, Augustine very well
discusseth, ^nchy. ad Lauren.
as ^e does other, saying: We must wholesomely confess, y^ which we must
rightly believe, that the God and Lord of all things, which created all things
very good, and foreknew that evil things should spring out of good, and knew
that it more perteined to his almighty goodness even of evil things to do
well, then not to suffer them to be evil: That he so ordered the life of
Angels and men, that in it he might first show what free will could, do, and
then y^ the benefit of his grace and judgment could do. Call. in his Insti. 3.
b. cap. 23. Sect. 7.

They ask how it comes to pass, that of two between whom, no deserving
puts any difference, God in his election passes over the one, and takes
the other. I ^on the other side do ask them, whether they think that in him
that is taken, there is any thing that may make the mind of God to incline
toward him. If they confess (as they needs must) that there is nothing, it
shall follow that God looks not upon man, but from his own goodness
^ot^heth a cause why to do good to him. Whereas therefore God chooses one man,
refusing another, this comes not of respect of man, but of his mercy alone,
which ought to have liberty to show forth and utter it self where and when it
pleases him. For we have in an other place also showed that there were not
from the beginning many called noble or wise or honorable, that GOD might
humble the pride of the flesh: so far is it off, that his favor was bound
unto persons. Call. in his Insti. 3. b. cha. 23. Sect. 10.

Of Gods mercy, and our undeserving in Predestination.
In giving that unto some which they do not deserve, he does show his free
mercy and grace: but in not giving it to al men, he does declare what all did
deserve. He is good in showing mercy to some, he is just in punishing the rest.

Places out of S. Austen for Predestination.
Christ's sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name,
Augustine.
for he has their names written in the book of life: he calls his own
sheep by name. Hereof comes it that the Apostle says: The Lord knows who
they be that be his. Augustine his 45. treatise upon John.

I have kept those that thou have given me, Augustine.
and no man of them is perished, save only the child of perdition, that the
Scripture might be fulfilled. He that betrayed Christ is called the son of
perdition, because he was prodestinate unto destruction, according to the
Scripture, which in the. 109. Psalm. chiefly, is prophesied of him. August. in
his. 107. treatise upon John.

Wherefore is that man or that man, Augustine.
and wherefore is not that man and that man predestinate? Ask not of me: I am
a man, I turn me to the depth of the Cross, I do not enter far in, I am
afraid, I am no seacher in, his judgments are unsearchable, thou art a man, I
am a man, it was a man that said: O man, what art thou that disputest with
God. Augustine in his Epistle to Paulinus. 7. Sermon.

But thou will say, Augustine.
wherefore made he me to honor, and an other to dishonor? What shall I
answer? Will thou hear Augustine that wilt not hear the Apostle, saying: O
man, what art thou that disputest with God.

There are two little children borne, if thou seek a due or a right, both
are made of one lump of perdition: but wherefore the Mother bears one to
grace, and the other choketh, being asleep? What will thou say unto me, what
did he deserve that was ^^oked up by his mother in sleeping? both of them
deserved no good? But the Potter has power over the clay of the same lump, to
make one vessel to honor, and an other to dishonor, will thou dispute with
me? Rather will thou wonder and cry out with me: O the great depth of his
riches, let us agree together in fear, least we perish in er^our. Augustine in
the same book and. 12. Sermon.

The Predestination of God by no means does make that the children of God,
should be made the children of the Devils, o^ of the temple of the holy
Ghost, the temple of Devils, or of the members of Christ, the members of an
harlot? But rather Predestination does make, that of the children of the Devil
are made the children of God, or of the^ temples of devils, are made the
temple of the holy Ghost, o^ of the members of an Harlot, are made the members
of CHRIST, because he has bound the strong man, and spoiled him of his armor.

Objection.
If God do find all men guilty, let him punish them all alike: If he find
them vnguiltie, let him withold the rigor of his justice from them all.

Answer.
Since (says Saint Austen) that in the first man, Augustine.
all the whole (...) of mankind did fall into condempnation, the vessell^ that
are made of it unto ho^our, are n^^ the vessels of their own righteousness,
but of the mercy of GOD, and some are made vessels to dishonor, it ought not
to be imputed unto any unrighteousness or iniquity, but unto judgment.
Again, that God does recompense due punishment unto them whom he does reprove,
and gives: undeserved grace unto them whom he does choose, he is de^^uered
from all blame by the similitude of a creditour, in whose power it lies to
forgive some the whole debt, and to make the other to pay the uttermost
farthing. Therefore God may give his grace to whom he will, because that he is
merciful, and not give it to al men, because y^ he is a righteous Judge. In
giving that unto some which they do not deserve, he (...) his free mercy and
grace, and not giving it to all men: he does declare, what we all do deserve.

The similitude.
If a man has many debtors, The similitude.
that do all owe unto him the like sum of money, does it not lie in his power
to forgive some of them the whole debt, and to make the other to pay to the
uttermost farthing, who can lay any thing to his charge if he will so do?
Then mark we are debtors unto God, for we have all deserved everlasting
dampnation. That then he does of his free mercy and goodness forgive some,
and some again he does deal extremely with-all, according to his righteous
judgment, who shall be so bold to blame him for it?

The words of Fulgentius and Barnard.
God (says Fulgentius Fulgentius.
) did not promise all things which he foretold, although he foretold al things
which he promised. As he did not predestinate all things which he foreknew,
although he foreknew al things which he did predestinate. He foreknew the will
of men good and bad, but he did not predestinate y^ naughty wills, but the
good. Fulg. in his. 1. book.

The kingdom of God (says Barnard Barnard.
) is given, is promised, is declared, is received: It is given in
Predestination, it is promised in calling, it is declared in justification, it
is received in glorification. Thereof y^ is said: Come ye blessed of my Father,
receive the kingdom prepared for you.

So does the Apostle say: Those whom be predestinate he calls: whom he
calls he justifies, and them he glorifieth. In Predestination is grace, in
calling is power, in justification is ioyfulnesse, in glorification is glory
and praise. Barnard upon the work of the book of Wisdom.

Fear not thou small flock (says Barnard Barnard.
) for to you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven. Who
be those? Even them whom he has foreknowne and predestinate to be fashioned
like unto the Image of his son. A great and secret Council is made known.
The Lord knows who be his: but that which was known unto God is not made
manifest to men: neither does he vouchsafe to make any ^^^er pertakers of so
great a mystery, but those self same men whom he has forknowne and
predestinate to be his, etc. Barnard in his. 107. Epistle to Thomas Beuerly.

Objections against Predestination answered.
Because of Christ coming, we must deny both Predestination or election and
reprobation, for if Predestination save the one, and Reprobacion condemn the
other, then is there nothing left for Christ, and his coming is in vain.

Answer.
But so many as are predestinate, are predestinate in Christ, without whom
there is no election: for those whom he predestinateth, them also he calls in
Christ.

Objection.
If does appoint a fatal necessity, and so drives men to desperation.

Answer.
If rather confirms our hope: for if salvation were by us to be gotten, then
we are so immutable that we should every minute of an hour, cast away our
selves, but it is for our safety, that our salvation lies in the purpose of
God.

Objections in S. Augustines time.
That the true endeavor to rise again, was taken from them that were fallen,
and occasion of carelessness ministered to them which did stand: also that it
takes away the true use of preaching and rebuking, and makes to none effect.
Also that before S. Augustines time, this doctrine was not preached, and yet
notwithstanding the doctrine of faith without it still defended.

Answer.
It overthrows not the gift of preaching: for Paul the Apostle of the
Gentiles, and the preacher of the whole world, so amply and so often urges it
in his Epistles to the Romans, to the Ephesians, and to Timothy. Also Luke in
the Acts of the Apostles. Math. 11. and. 22. John. 10. 17. and. 25. For like
as calling is the mean to win them that are predestinate, so consequently by
preaching is our calling fulfilled, and contrariwise by preaching, are the
wicked and reprobate made inexcusable.

They that are predestinate, are called by preaching.
They that are reprobate, are condemned by preaching.
PRESCIENE.
Of the prescience of God, what it is.
WHen we attribute prescience to God, we understand that all things have ever
been, and perpetually abide present before his eyes, so that to his eternal
knowledge, nothing is by past, nothing is to come, but all things are present,
and so are they present, that they are not as conceived imaginations, or forms
and figures, whereof other innumerable things proceed (as Plato testifies,
that of the form and example of one man, many thousands of men are fashioned)
but we say that all things be so present before God, that he does contemplate
and behold them in their verity and perfection. And therefore it is, that the
Prophets oftentimes speak of things, being yet after to come, with such
certainty, as that they were already done. And this prescience of God do we
affirm to be extended to the universal compass and circuit of the world,
yea, and to every particular creature of the same. Knox. in his boo. against an
Anab. fol. 20.

PRICK OF THE FLESH.
The meaning of S. Paul, in this place.
THere was given unto me a prick in the flesh. 2. Cor. 12. 7
He means concupiscence y^ sticks fast in us as it were a prick, insomuch as
it constrained Paul he being regenerate to cry out, I do not that good I would
do, etc. And he calls it a prick by a borrowed kind of speech taken from
thorns and stumpes, which were very dangerous and hurtful for the feet, if
a man walk through woods that are cut down. Theo. Beza.

The Greek word signifies a sharp piece of wood, or a pole or stick or
sharp thing, which pricketh one as he goes through bushes or thick places.
Geneua.

PRIEST.
What a Priest does signify.
THe Priest shall be as the people. Esa^ 24. 2.
A Priest does often signify every man that rules the people, be it King or
Prince, or other common officer. Iere. 6. 13. And from the Prophet to the
Priest. T. M.

Because this was a name of dignity, it was also applied unto them, which were
not of Aarons family, and so signifies also a man of dignity, as 2. Sam. 8.
18. and 20. 25. 1. Chro. 18. 17. And by these words the Prophet signifies an
horrible confusion, where there shall be neither religion, order, nor policy.
Ose. 4. 9.

Of the Priests deceiving of the people.
O my people^ Ribaulders oppress thee, Esaias. ^. 1^
and women have rule of thee, O my people thy leaders deceive thee. Some read
^Exactours or Extortioners. He notes the covetousness of Priests and
Prelates. God here calls the poor widows, the fatherless, and all that
are destitute of the comfort of this world his people, whom the Pharesies then
oppressed, now the Priests and such as falsely boast themselves to be spiritual,
justly called exactors, insomuch as they require their right (as they call it)
more by men's traditions themby the word of God, and do not to seek souls to
God as money for themselves. Oppress, that is spoil, pill and even shave, so
that they scant have ought.

What house, field or merchandise is there, that renders them not somewhat?
whether there be children christened, or marriage made, or men come to the
table of the Lord, whether y^ sick be visited, or the dead buried, there is
ever somewhat to be required. Furthermore, they are not only accused to be
covetous, but also to be women, Priests are become women.
that is effeminate and womanly, because they most filthelye and idly spend
and wast, that which they have scraped with iugling violence, and most naughty
fashions. T. M.

How the Priests office ought not to be despised for the vice of the Priest.
When thou see an unworthy Priest, slander not the Priesthood. For thou
ought not to condemn the thing, but him that evil uses a good thing. Since
Judas also was a traitor, howbeit for this, the other Apostles is not accused,
but the mind of him: neither is it the fault of the Priesthood, but of the
evil mind. And thou therefore blame not the Priesthood, but the Priest that
uses evil a good thing. For if one dispute with thee and say: Seeest thou
yonder Christian, answer thou: But I speak not to thee of the persons, but
of the things, or else how many Physicians have been made slaughter men, and
have given poison for remedies, and yet I despise not the Art, but him that
evil uses the Art.

How many shipmen have guided evil their ships, yet is not the Art of sailing
evil, but the mind of them. If the Christen man be wicked, accuse not thou
the profession of the Priesthood, but him that evil uses a good thing. I.
Bridges.

How all men be Priests.
There is no man almost of the faithful (says Augustine) that doubts but
that the Priesthood of the Jews, was a figure of the princely Priesthood to
come, which is now in the Church, wherein all they be consecrated, which do
belong to the body of Christ, the chief and true Prince of Priests.

For now all men be anointed, whereas at that time, Kings and Priests were so
only. And whereas Peter writing to christen people, called them a royal
Priesthood, he declared y^ both the names of them did agree unto that people
unto whom y^ same anointing did belong. All Christen men be priests
In another place he says, From which time (says he) those which do believe
and be cleansed by ye sanctifieng of that Baptime, they be anointed, not some,
as it was before in the law, but all for Prophets, Priests and Kings. By the
example of the which annoynting, we be admonished what manner of folks we
ought to be, that our conversation be not less holy then our annoynting is.
For from the Sacrament of this annoynting both the word of the name of Christ,
and all Christians, that is to say, such as believe in Christ, is descended and
derived, which name is naughtely and vain applied unto him, which does not
follow Christ. And Origin says: As many (says he) as be anointed with the
holy Ointments, be made Priests, like as Peter said to all, Churches: You be
a chosen sort and a royal Priesthood, a holy people: you be therefore a
Priestly kind, and therefore you repair to the holy places. And Beda upon the
first Epistle of Peter, Whereby (says he) he does most manifestly admonish us,
that whereas we be of our selves an holy Priesthood, we may be builded upon the
foundation of Christ, therefore he calls every Church an holy Priesthood,
which name of office the house of Aaron had ever in the law: for surely we be
all of us members of the high Priest, and we be all marked with the Oil of
gladness. And Hierom upon the Prophet Malachy says: We be all the priestly
and royal kind, which being baptized in Christ, do bear the name of Christ.
These be the saiengs of those Doctors, by whose testimonies it is approved,
that the same which is mentioned of the Priesthood of the new Testament in the
places before rehearsed, does pertain unto all Christen persons, and that
therefore we be all Priests. Muscu. fol. 251.

In the new Testament, Priests be called by this word Sacerdotes, y^ is to say
(I think) Sacrificers. And thus as Christ was called Rex and Sacerdos, King
and Priest, so be all true Christen men in the new Testament, as is testified.
Apoc. 1. 5. and. 6. by Christ made Kings and Priests. The words of the Apoc. be
thus: To Jesus Christ which has loved us, and washed us from our sins,
through his blood, and made us Kings and Priests unto God, even his Father,
unto him be glory and rule for ever and ever, Amen. Thus says John. speaking
of all Christen people. In like manner it is said. 1. Pet. 2. where he writes
to the Christen men: You (quod he) be a chosen generation, a Regal Priesthood,
an holy people. S. Bid expounding the same, shall testify plainly with me.
And S. Austen I wot well in diverse places, that all Christen men be so called
Regale Sacerdotium. And likewise does Faber in his Commentaries upon the same
place. Whosoever looks upon the treatise called Vnio dissidentium, shall
find a multitude of ancient Fathers saiengs, declaring the same. Lambert in
the bo. of Mar. fol. 1268.

How to know a true Priest.
To take a Priest for a Sacrificer for sin, is injurious to Christ, and we
know none such in the new Testament, for that Priesthood must needs end, with
the law of Sacrifice. But to take a Priest as Malachy does: How a true Priest
is known
The lips of the Priest shall keep knowledge, and they require the law at
his mouth, for he is the Angel and the Minister of the Lord of Hosts. Here
find we a better mark then ye beasts mark or the flesh marke^ that is to say
knowledge, whereby only he does the message of his Lord and master, and
instructs his Sheep in the law of God. By this mark are true Priests tried
and known. A. G. fol. 199.

How the Priests are forbidden to be at the death of any of the people.
A Priest shall defile him at the death of none of his people. The Priests be
warned, that they shall not come at the common wakings and lamentations of the
dead, lest they should thereby be the more unapt to do sacrifices, whereunto
they were properly appointed, and least they should by their weeping give an
occasion to destroy the belief of the resurrection of ye dead. T. M.

How the Priests eat the sins of the people.
And they eat up the sins of my people. Ose. 4 8.
To wit, the Priest^ seek to eat the peoples Offerings, and flatter them in
their sins. Geneua.

Of Priests marriage.
Look. Marriage.

How the Priesthood is translated.
S. Paul says, Heb. 7. 12.
that forasmuch as the Priesthood is translated, no remedy the law must also
be translated. Paul indeuoureth none other, but to declare, that like as the
Priesthood is now translated from the Tribe of Leuy, The priesthood translated.
to Christ and his spiritual generation^ which are Priests after the order of
Melchisedech, so must the law also be translated, that is to say, the
Ceremonial law, which prescribes unto the Levites, the kind and order of
their sacrifices, must now be translated and altered. For Moses prescribes
nothing to this Priesthood, that is after the order of Melchisedech. The
Priests of this order, must follow the example of their first and chief Priest
Jesus Christ, who offered up his own body, and none other sacrifice, so must
we, if we be Priests of that order, offer up our bodies a lively and acceptable
sacrifice unto God, always singing unto him in our hearts, and so shall we be
true honourers of God the Father, and shall honor him in spirit and truth.
Crowley.

Who began first to make the statute of Priests chastity.
Some says that Calixtus primus did first make the statute that Priests should
vow chastity, but that is not so. For all Chronicles bears witness that
Priests had wives in the Council of Nicene, the which was almost an hundred
years after Calixtos days. But ancient histories does make mention, y^
Nicholas the first, which was bishop of Rome, the year of our Lord. 860. did
go about this thing, but he could not bring it to pass, S. Huldrik
by the reason of an holy man. S. Hulderich Bishop of Auguensais, which wrote
sharp Epistles against him, reproving him sore, y^ because he would compel
Priests to vow chastity, his words be these: Thou have not swarued a little
from discretion, y^ whereas thou ought to have counseled Priests to
chastity, thou have with a Lordly violence compelled them to it. Is not this
after the judgment of all wise men a great violence, when that thou, against
the institution of the Gospel, and against the decree of the Holy ghost, wilt
compel men to serve thy private decree, etc. Note that this holy man says,
that Priests ought to be admonished and counseled to chastity, but not
compelled. For that (says he) is a great violence, and against Christ's holy
Gospel, and the blessed spirit of God.

This holy man proceeds further with the Bishop of Rome, and tells a fact
of S. Gregory, S. Gregor.
the which went about to compel Priests to vow chastity. Upon a day S.
Gregory sent unto his Pondes for fish, and in the nets that they fished
withal, were brought about 6000. 6000. heads.
young childrens heads, the which thing when S. Gregory saw, struck him sore
to the heart, and was very heavy of that sight, and perceived anon, that his
decree that he made for Priests chastity, was the occasion of this great
murder, in that that Priests could not live sole, nor yet they durst not auow
their children for fear of the decree. And so for sauegard of their honesty,
they fell into a fearful and abominable sin, to kill their own children.
And for this cause S. Gregory (says this holy Bishop) did revoke his decree
again, and did greatly allow the saying of the Apostle: It is better to marry
then to burn. Adding to it of his own: It is better to marry, then to give
occasion of murder. D. Barnes. fol. 328.

PRINCES.
How Princes ought to be obeyed.
A Man ought to obey his Prince, but in the Lord, and never against the Lord.
For he that knowingly obeys his Prince against God, does not a duty to the
Prince, but is a deceiuer of his Prince, and an helper unto him to work his
own destruction. He is also unjust which gives not the Prince, that is the
Princes, and to God that is Gods. A noble saying of Valentinianus the Emperor
for choosing the Bishop of Millayne, Set him (says he) in the Bishops seat,
to whom i^ we as man do offend at any time, may submit our selves.
Policarpus the most constant Martyr when he stood before the chief Ruler, and
was commanded to blaspheme Christ, and to swear by the fortune of Caesar,
etc. he answered with a mild spirit, We are taught (says he) to give honor to
Princes which be of God, but such honor as is not contrary to Gods religion.
Ridley in conferring with Latimer.

How Princes ought to do with matters of religion.
Look. Kings.

How this place following is understood.
O ye Princes open your gates: Psa. 24. 7.
and de ye lift up O ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall enter in.
Much ado there is about the exposition of this verse. Some delyght in the
applieng of it to the building of ye Temple at Jerusalem. Other in a spiritual
Allegory apply it to the members of Christ, which undoubtedly agrees very
handsomely with the process of the Prophet, as thus. O ye Princes open your
gates. By y^ Princes which have given their names and their faith, to Christ
the holy Lord, may well be understood all such men which do earnestly study
to live a godly life. All they whether they be men or women, poor or rich,
high or low, in the sight of the world, they are nevertheless spiritually
Princes, like as they be called spiritual Priests: Priests as S. Peter does
call them, because they sacrifice daily unto god, their bodily members, their
whole heart and mind to the true serving of God. And like as they be called
in respect of such spiritual sacrifice, Priests: so may all true Christians be
called princes, because they have conquered (as I might say) and crucified as
S. Peter terms it, their flesh against all vice and concupisence. To these
Princes the Prophet now speaks, saying: O ye Princes, O ye living Saints, O
ye dearly beloved members of Jesus Christ, open your gates, not your gates
made of timber and boords, but your spiritual gates, ye gates and doors of
your souls, which be spiritual and eternal, open them resist not the Holy
ghost, quench not the spirit, that Christ the king of eternal glory, may come
and dwell in your hearts. Love him, and labor continually to keep his
Commandments, and then surely both he and his Father with the holy Ghost,
will come and dwell with you. Ric. Turnar.

PRISCILLIANVS.
Of the damnable heresies of this man.
PRiscillianus a Spaniard maintained the opinion of Gnostici, Manichaeus and
Sabellius, being condemned by the Council of Bordeaux, he appealed unto Maximus
the usurping Emperor, which found him an Heretic and beheaded him. Prosp.
Chronic. He said, the soul was of one substance with God, and came down from
heaven to endure voluntary conflicts. He said that man's actions were governed
by the stars, he condemned the eating of flesh, he parted married couples,
referring the creation of the flesh, not to God but to wicked Angels, he
allowed of the Scriptures called Apocripha. Unto every of his followers he
said: Iura, periura, secretum prodere noli. August. li. de haeres.

PRIVI CONTRACT.
How privy contracts are not lawful nor good.
NOw also if ye will consent to deal mercifully and truly with my master,
Genesis 24 49
tell me: and if not, tell me also. He treats with the mother and brother
concerning the maid, whereby it may appear, that privy contracts without the
knowledge and consent of their parents are not good. The Bible note.

PROCESSIONS.
How Processions came up.
WE read not of any Processions, till the time of Agapatius Pope, who(as
Platina reports) did first ordeine them. Ann. 533. Although we read the like
of Leo y^ third, about. 810. years after Christ. Surely whenever Processions
began, they were taken of Gentilitie. We read often in Pliny that the Romans
in all their distresses, would run to every Idol they had, would go their
circuites from this place to that place, and think they did acceptable service
unto God, of whose folly Arnobius writes thus: Nudi cruda, etc. They go about
naked in the raw Winter, other have their cappes on: they carry about with them
old targets, beat their skins, they lead their Gods a begging round about
the streets, they suffer some Chappells to be gone to once a year, some must
not be seen at all, some a man may not come unto, some other are holy enough
without women, and for a servant to be at some of them, is an heinous offense.
So much Arnobius.

PROMISE.
A constant rule of all humane promises.
ALl promises ought among the godly, so far^e forth to be of force, as they
do agree with the word of God, which thing if Iephthe had diligently
considered, he would never have suffered himself to have committed so unworthy
things against his daughter: this condition surely in all couenaunts ought to
be counted for a most constant rule. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 37.

What promise it was that the old Fathers received not.
And received not the promise, Heb. 11. 39
etc. This which Saint Paul says, that the Fathers has not obtained the
promise, ought not to be understood, of the everlasting rest or joy, that we
have by the merits of Christ his death, but rather of the Incarnation and
coming of Christ. Sir. I. Cheek.

They had not such clear light as we: for they looked for that which we
have. Therefore it were shame for us, if at least we had not as great
constancy as they. Geneua.

How promises may be broken.
They returned into their country another way. Mat. 2. 12.
Promise ought not to be kept, where Gods honor and the preaching of the
truth is hindered. The wise men not withstanding their promise mad to Herod,
returned home into their own Country by another way.

PROPER AND IMPROPER.
Of proper and improper speeches in Scripture.
WHen the Scripture says thus: God is a spirit, it is a proper speech. And
why? Because he is so of his own, nature. But when it gives him a body,
members, and the use of them, resembling it to man, as we see it does in diverse
places, then it is an improper speech.

When the Scripture says, that the Lord God is unchangeable, it is a proper
speech, because he is so of his own nature: But when it makes show that he
is chaungeable, as when it says, he repented that he had made man. And in
another place, he repented that he had made Saul king, then it is an improper
speech.

When it says, that God is in every place, it is a proper speech, because it
is so conu^nient for his nature, for the confirmation of all things which he
has created, although he be also perticularly in the hearts is of the
faithful, for the special ^ffect of their sanctification: but when it says:
He went down to see the Tower of Babel, then it is an improper speech.

Of proper and improper speeches in Christ's words.
When Christ saith^ I am the light of the world, it is a proper speech, for it
is true indeed, that Jesus Christ is the only son of righteousness, which
does lighten the world with true light. And afterward when he says to his
Disciples: Ye are the light of the world, that is an improper speech, because
they are not the light in themselves, but in the Lord.

When he says to his Apostles, Preach repentance and remission of sins in
my name, he speaks most properly, because it is he of whom the Prophets do
bear witness, that whosoever believes in him, shall receive remission of
sins through his name. But when he says afterward: To whomsoever you shall
remit sins, they shall be remitted, he speaks improperly: because he gives
that unto the Apostles, which properlye belongs unto himself. For the
Apostles are but his ministers and messengers to pronounce remission of sins,
which comes properly from Jesus Christ, to those that believe, in him. F. N.
B. the Italian.

PROPHECY.
How Prophecy sometime comes out of the month of wicked men.
He prophesied that I^^^ ^ould dye for the people. Ioh. 11. 50


Hereby we do gather that the gift of Prophecy, is given not only to good
men, but also to the reprobate, being set in public office, even as
oftentimes it is permitted to the wicked to work miracles, as we may read in
the. 7. chapter of S. Matthew. So also we read of Saul, who being anointed
with the kingly unction by Samuel, began to prophecy with the rest of the
Prophets, etc. Marl. upon John. fol. 424.

God made him to speak, neither could his impiety let Gods purpose, who caused
this wicked man, even as he did Balaam, to be an i^strument of the Holy Ghost.
Geneua.

PROPHETS.
What the Prophets were.
THe Prophets were the notable interpreters of Prophecies, Apo. 18. 20
who through a certain singular gift of revelation, were able to apply them to
the present matter. Marl. fol. 259.

Against false Prophets.
O Israel, Eze. 13. 4.
thy Prophets are like to the Foxes upon the dry field: for they stand not in
the gaps, neither make they an hedge for the house of Israel. O Israel thy
Prophets, etc. Thy Preachers of men's traditions does the Prophet compare unto.
Foxes, which feign a service of God, and increase Ceremonies, and teach a way
to please God by such works as they enrich themselves with. By the hedge here
may ye understand prayer done in faith. T. M.

How the people gave ear rather to false Prophets then to the true.
But whereas you say that God has raised us up Prophets at Babylon, etc. Iere.
29. 15.
Such Prophets as preached unto them, the things which they were desirous off,
did they greatly allow; yea, even after they came to Babylon, in them they
reioiced, as though they had been sent of the Lord, and yet were they indeed
false Prophets. But Ezechiel the true Prophet of the Lord, which preached the
contrary, did they persecute.

By the false Prophets they said, God has sent us Prophets, and their doctrine
did they follow, but the true Prophet did they mock and laugh to sc^^ne, and
would neither believe his doctrine, nor give ear unto it. T. M.

How a false Prophet is known.
Ye shall know them by their fruits. Ma. 7. ^6.
The fruit of the Prophets is their doctrine. Therefore if thou will know the
true Prophet from the false, try their doctrine at the touch stone of Gods
word, for else by the outward conversation, thou may be deceived and beguiled.
Theo. Beza.

The meaning of this place following.
Art thou a Prophet? John. 1. 21
He answered no. They inquire of some great Prophet, and not of Christ, for
John had denied before that he is Christ, for they thought that some great
Prophet should be sent like unto Moses, wrasting to that purpose, that place of
Deuteronomy. 18. 15. which is to be understood of all the company of the Prophets and
Ministers, which have been and shall be to the end, and especially of Christ,
who is the head of all Prophets. Beza.

PROSELITE.
What a Proselite is.
Jews and Proselites. Act. 2. 10.
By the Jews he means them, that were both Jews by birth, and Jews by
profession of Religion, though they were borne in other places: And they were
Proselites which were Gentiles borne, and embraced the Jews religion. Theo.
Beza.

And Proselites. To wit, such as were converted to the Jews Religion, which
were before Panims and Idolaters. Ge.

PROTESTANTS.
How the name of Protestants came up.
THe original of the name of Protestants began in Germany, about a decree that
was made at Speres against y^ Gospel. Anno. Dom. 1529. which Decree, the
Princes electours of Germany resisted, unto whose protestation, certain of the
chief Cities to the number of. 14. did subscribe with them. The number of the
Protestants. 7. Princes and 24. Cities. Sledane.

PROVIDENCE.
Of the providence of God, what it is.
Providence is not only that unspeakable power whereby it comes to pass,
that God has foreseen all things from everlasting, and most wisely provided
for all things before hand: But also that eternal decree or ordinance of the
most wise and righteous God, whereby that every thing that has been, has
been: and every thing that is, is: and every thing that shall be, shall be:
according as it liked him to appoint from everlasting. Beza.

We mean by the providence of God, that even as he is creator of all things,
he is also the conseruer, which does by his eternal power and wisdom, guide
and govern them, and by his sovereign goodness in such sort, that nothing
comes by adventure, neither in heaven nor in earth, without his counsel and
ordinance, and his most just will, be it in general, or in particular. Peter.
Viret.

No good or evil does happen without a cause, or by fortune without Gods
providence, but all things does happen after his judgment. Hierom. upon Eze.

Providence is Gods appointed, immovable and perpetual administration of all
things. Pet. Mar.

Providence is sometime as much to say as knowledge, and foreknowledge of
things to come. Sometime it signifies an ableness to foresee for others of
things necessary, so it is said that God in heaven does foresee and care for
all. Again, some do define the providence of God after this wise: Providence
is the everlasting and unchangeable kingdom and administration of all things.
They do mean (says Musculus) by the word of kingdom, dominion and power,
and by the word of administration, the temperature of ye dominion which they
added, because of the finding and giving of all things unto us, which seems
in show, to be a condition of ministry, as well as of dominion. Musc. fol.
425. and. 426.

Gods providence we call that sovereign Empire and supreme dominion, which God
always keeps in the government of all things in heaven and earth contained.
And these two (that is, prescience and providence) we so attribute unto God,
that with the Apostle we fear not to affirm, that in him we have our being,
moving and life. We fear not to affirm, that the way of man is not in his own
power, but that his footsteps are directed by the eternal God That the sorts
and lots which appear most subject to fortune) go so soorth by his
providence, that a Sparrow falls not on the ground, without our heavenly
Father. And thus we give not to God any prescience, by an idle sight, and a
providence by a general moving of his creatures (as not only some
Philosophers, but also more then is to be wished in our days do) but we
attribute unto him such a knowledge and providence, as is extended to every
one of his creatures. In which he so works, that willingly they tend and
incline to the end, to the which they are appointed by him, etc. Knox. fol. 21.

Because we know not all things (says S. Austen) which God does concerning us
in most good order, that therefore in only good will we do according to the
law, because his providence is an unchangeable law. Therefore since God do
claim unto himself the poor to rule the world, which is to us unknown. Let
this be a law to us of soberness and modesty, quietly to obey his sovereign
authority, that his will may be unto us the only rule of Justice, as the most
just cause of all things. I mean not that absolute will, of which the
Sophisters do babble, seperating by wicked and profane disagreement, his
Justice from his power, but I mean that providence, which is the gouernesse of
all things, from which proceeds nothing but right, although the causes be
hidden from us. Calvin. 1. book. chapt. 17. Sect. 3.

PROOVING.
What proouing and examining of a man's self is.
THis proouing and examining of a man's self, is first to think with him, with
what lust and desire he comes to the Maundie, and will eat that bread.
Whether he be sure that he is the child of God, and in the faith of Christ:
and whether his conscience do bear him witness that Christ's body was broken
for him. And whether the lust that he has to praise God, and thank him with a
faithful heart in the mids of the brethren do drive him thetherward, or
else whether he do it for the meats sake, or to keep the custom: for then
were it better he were away. For he that eats and drinks unworthily eats
and drinks his own damnation, because he makes no difference of the Lords
body, that as it is said before, he that regards not the purpose, for which
it was instituted, and puts no difference between his eating and other
eating (for other eating do only serve the belly) but this eating was
instituted and ordained, to serve the soul and inward man. And therefore he
that abuses it to the flesh, eats and drinks his own damnation, etc. I.
Frith.

Look. Try. Examine.

PTOLOMEVS.
Of this man's heretical opinions.
PTolomeus, Heretic
of whom Ptolomei are called, taught the heretical opinions of the Gnostici
and of Valentinus, adding thereunto of his own certain heathenish doctrine
out of Homer. He wrote unto Flora a woman of his faith, and endeavored to
pervert her. Epiph. haere. 33.

PVBLICAN.
What the Publicans were.
The Publicans, Mat. 21. 3^
bought in great the Emperors Tribute, and to make their most advantage did
ouerset ye people. Tind.

Of their receiving before the Jews.
The Publicans and Harlots shall come into the kingdom of God before you. The
Harlots and Publicans repenting truly, and with amendment of life, submitting
themselves to the mercy of God, are more acceptable unto God, then ye proud
workmongers, that trust in their own righteousness. S, I. Chapter

PUNISHMENT.
How the punishment of the law, does not satisfy for sins.
MOses in the law, John. 8. 5.
commanded that such should be stoned. They recite the law out of the. 20.
chap. of Leuit. where it is said, and the man that commiteth adultery with
another man's wife, because he has committed adultery with his neighbors wife,
the adulterer and the adultresse, shall both dye ye death. But ye law does not
therefore punish the sins and offenses of men, as though the punishment of
the sword were a satisfaction for sin (for the death of Christ only has
made satisfaction for sin). But offenders are punished by the sword for
examples sake, that the people might fear to offend. And least in time, sin
and wickedness might be counted for virtue and righteousness. For the sin
that is left unpunished, is not known to be sin. Marl. upon John. fol. 282.

PVRE IN HEART.
Who they be that are so called.
BLessed are the pure in heart. Math. 5. 8.
Blessed (says he) are y^ pure in heart, y^ is, which join themselves unto me
with a pure, simple, and desirous mind of knowing the will of God, and do
embrace the doctrine of truth without hypocrisy and doubleness of heart, such
were the disciples of Christ, so soon as it was offered unto them. Such was
Nathanael, of whom Christ said: Behold a true Israelite, John. 1. 47.
in whom there is no deceit. Marl. upon Math. fol. 79.

They are called pure in heart, that believe unfeignedly, and trust from the
very heart in God, whom they do see through faith while they be yet in this
vale of misery: but after this bodily life, they shall have a full fruition of
him, and see him as he is. Theo. Beza.

What pureness of heart is.
Pureness of heart is, the consenting and studuous purpose to keep the laws
of God, and to mean truly in all thy words and works, and to do them with
a true intent.

PVRGATORIE.
How Purgatory is utterly disproued by the Scriptures of God.
Verily, verily I say unto yea, he that hears my word, and believes in him
that sent me, lohn 5. 24
has everlasting life, and shall not come into damnation, but has passed from
death unto life. He was wounded for our transgression, Esaias. 53^ 5.
he was broken for our iniquities: The chasticement of our peace was laid upon
him, and with his stripes we were made whole.

Saint Paul says, Coll. 2. 14.
Christ has taken the oblation that was against us, and has fastened it to
the cross, etc.

Saint John says: Apoc. 14. 13
Blessed be the dead that dye in ye Lord, even so says the spirit. For they
rest from their labors, and their works follow them. He says not they be in
Purgatory, but they rest from their labors.

Again he says: Apoc. 7. 17
They hunger no more, they shall thirst no more, for the lamb which is in the
midst of the throne, shall govern them, and shall lead them (not into
Purgatory, but) into the living fountain of waters, and God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes.

Saint Augustine says. Aug. hyp. G^ost. li. 5
Primum locum fides Catholicorum, etc. The first place of Catholic faith, by
Gods authority believes, to be the kingdom of heaven, from whence whosoever
is not baptized is excluded. The second place, the same Catholic faith
believes to be hell: where all ru^nagates and whosoever is without the faith
of Christ, shall taste everlasting punishment. As for the third place we utterly
know none, neither shall we find in holy Scriptures, that there is any
such.

If there were a Purgatory, and also if that the Pope with his pardons for
money may deliver one soul thence, he may deliver him as well without money:
Pope a cruel ^ira^t
if he may deliver one, he may deliver a thousand, if he may deliver a
thousand, he may deliver them all, and so destroy Purgatory. And then is he a
cruel tyrant without all charity, if he keep them there in prison till men
will give him money. Book of Mar. fo. 1155.

Know you (says S. Austen) Augustine
that when the soul is departed from the body, it is incontinent for his good
deeds put in paradise, or else thrown headlong into the dungeon of hell for
his sins. Choose you now what ye list, and purpose this while ye be here in
this life, either to joy perpetual with Saints, or else to be tormented
without end, among wicked sinners. Book of Mar. fol. 1263

The christian says does hold, that the only blood of Jesus Christ and the
sacrifice that he has done upon the cross for poor sinners, is so
sufficient to satisfy the judgment of God, and to cleanse man of his sins,
that there needs none other Purgatory for them: As indeed there is none
other to cleanse them, neither by fire nor by water, nor by any other means,
neither in this world, nor in the other. Therefore he that seeks
satisfaction any where else, be it in his own works or those of other men, or in
any kind of creature, or y^ in all or in part, the same he or she refuses
wholly the ransom and satisfaction made by Jesus Christ. Then it follows that
she doctrine of the Papists concerning Purgatory, and their satisfactions
which they seek in themselves and in their works, or in those of their Priests
and Monks, and in their offering and suffrages, as well for the living as for the
dead, are man's inventions full of blasphemies, and wholly against y^ word of
God, whereby as much as in them is, they make of none effect y^ merit and
benefit of Christ's death and passion, and do openly renounce ye same. P. Vi.

How Purgatory and pardons came jointly together.
Polidore Po^idore
says: Nemo nunc dubitat, etc. No Catholic man now doubts of Purgatory:
whereof notwithstanding among the ancient Fathers, there is either no mention
at all, or very seldom. Yea even to this day the Grecians believe it not. For
so long as there was no care for purgatory, no man sought after pardons.
Polidore de inuentio. li. 8. cha. 5.

How Purgatory was not known. 400. years after Christ
S. Austen was. 400. years after Christ. And yet in his time was it not fully
and fastly believed to be an Article of our faith: no, nor yet fully and fastly
believed to be true: for he himself writes in his Enchiridion on this manner,
speaking of Purgatory, after that he expounded the place of Paul. 1. Cor. 3.
and had taken this word fire, not for Purgatory, but for temptation and
tribulation, he added these words in the. 69. chapter: It is not incredible
that such a thing should also chance after this life, and whether it be so or
no, it may be questioned, etc. I. Frith.

S. Austen overthrows al prayers for the dead with this, when he teaches
that all men looks for ye resurrection of the flesh, and the eternal glory,
and that every man then receives the rest y^ follows after death, if he be
worthy when he dies. And therefore he testifies y^ all the godly do immediately
after death enjoy y^ blessed rest as well as y^ Prophets, the Apostles and
Martirs. If their estate be such, what I beseech you (says Calvin) shall our
prayers avail them. Call. in his Inst. 3. b. chap. 5. Sect. 10.

When (say they) the Lord affirms that the sin against the holy Ghost should
not be forgiven in this world, nor in ye world to come, there he shows y^ there
is a forgiveness of some sins in the world to come. But who sees not that the
Lord there, speaks of the fault of sin? Now if it be so, what is that to
their Purgatory, forasmuch as by their opinion, y^ pain is there suffered of
those sins, whereof they deny not the fault to be forgiven in this present
life? But that they may no more carpe against us, they shall have yet a plainer
solution. When the Lord meant to cut off all hope of pardon from so heinous
wickedness, he thought it not enough to say that it should never be forgiven:
but the more to amplify it, he used a division, wherein he comprehended both
the judgment that every man's conscience feels in this life, and the last
judgment that shall be pronounced at the resurrection: As though he should
have said: Beware ye of malicious rebellion, as of most present damnation: for
he that of set purpose, shall endeavor to quench the light of the holy Ghost,
shall not obeteine pardon, neither in this life which is given to sinners for
their conversion, nor in the last day, when the lambs shall be severed by the
Angels of God from the Goats, and the kingdom of heaven shall be cleansed
from al offenses. Then they bring forth also that parable of Matthew. Agree with
thine adversary, least he deliver thee to the Judge, and the Judge to the
Sergeant, and the Sergeant to the prison, Agree with thine adversary.
from whence thou shall not get forth until thou have paid the uttermost
farthing. If in this place the Judge do signify God, and the adversary
plaintiue the Devil, the Sergeant the Angel, and the prison Purgatory, I will
gladly yield unto them: But if it be evident to all men that Christ meant
there to show into how many dangers and mischifes they cast themselves, y^ had
rather obstinatly pursue the extremity of the law, then deal according to
equity and good right, to the end to exhort his Disciples, the more earnestly
to agree with equity: where then I pray you shall Purgatory be found. Call. in
his Inst. 3. b. cha. 5. Sect. 7.

How Purgatory came from the Heathen.
As for the fancy of Purgatory, it sprang first from the heathen, and was
received among them in that time of darkness, long before the coming of
CHRIST, as it may plainly appear by Plato and Virgil, in whom ye shall
find described at large, the whole common weal, and all the orders and
degrees of Purgatory. Saint Austen says, the old Heathen Romans had a
sacrifice which they called, Sacrum Purgatorium, a Purgatory sacrifice. Jewel.
300.

An Argument of Purgatory.
It is impossible that remission or purging from sins should be made without
blood, Argument.
Paul to ye Hebrews. But in Purgatory there is no blood but fire, Ergo in
purgatory it is impossible that remission or purging from sins should be made.

Objection.
Purgatory is good to fear men from sin.

Answer.
Christ and his Apostles thought hell fire enough, and yet (besides the fleshly
imagination cannot stand with Gods word) what great fear can there be of that
terrible fire, which thou may quench almost for three half pence.

How our sins are only purged by Christ.
By his own person he has purged our sins. Heb. 1. 3.
These words (by his own person) have an Emphasis or vehemency, which drives
away all sacrificing Priests from such office of sacrificing: seeing that which
he has done by himself, he has not left to be perfected by other, so that
the purging of our sins may more truly be thought done and past, then a thing
to come and to be done. Latimer.

Doctor Readmans opinion of Purgatory.
Being asked what his opinion was concerning Purgatory, and what the Schoolmen
judged thereof, he answered, that the subtle reasons of the Schoolmen
concerning Purgatory, seemed to him to be no less vain and frivolous, then
disagreeing from the truth: Doctor Readma^
Adding thereto, that when we be rapt up to the clouds to meet Christ coming
to judgment, with a great number of Angels, in all glory and majesty, then
every one shall be purged with fire, as it is written: The fire shall go
before him, and shall flame round about his enemies, and the fire shall burn
in sight, and round about him shall be a great tempest: saying that diverse of
the old writers approved this his sentence concerning Purgatory. Book of Mar.
fol. 1540.

PVRPLE AND LINEN.
WHich was clothed in Purple and Linen. Luke. 16. 19^
Uery gorgeously and sumptuously, for Purple garments were costly, and this
fine linen, which was a kind of linen that came out of Achaia, was dear as
gold. Beza.

PVTTING ON OF HANDS.
Look. Laieng on of hands.

Queen of Heaven.
Who it was they called the Queen of Heaven.
AND the women kneded dough to make cakes to the Queen of heaven. l^re. 7. 18.
That is, they sacrifice to the Sun, Moon, and stars, whom they called the
Queen of heaven. Geneua.

As to burn incense to the Queen of heaven, etc. Iere. 44. 17
It seems that the Papists gathered of this place their Salua Regina, and
Regina coeliletare. Calling the virgin Mary Queen of heaven, and so of the
blessed virgin and mother of our savior Christ, made an Idol: For here the
Prophet condempneth their Idolatry. Read the fourth of Kings. chap. 21. verse.
5.

Epiphanius says: Ne quis comedat de errore, etc. Let no man eat of this
error touching S. Mary. Epi. li. 3.
For though the tree be fair, haeres 59.
yet is not this fruit to be eaten. Although Mary be beautiful, holy and
honorable, yet in she not to be adored. But these women worshipping. S. Mary,
renew again y^ sacrifice of wine mingled in the honor of ye Goddess Fortuna,
and prepare a table for the devil, and not for God, as it is written in the
Scriptures, they are fed with the meat of wickedness. And again: Their women
boult flower, and the children gather sticks to make fine Cakes in the honor
of Queen of Heaven.

Therefore let such women be rebuked by the Prophet Jeremy, and let them
trouble no more the world, and let them not say, we worship the Queen of
Heaven. Jewel. fol. 313.

QVESTIONS.
AS touching Questions, 2. Tim 3. 2 3.
Saint Paul says to Timothy thus: In these things I would have thee
confirmed, these be good and profitable for men: but foolish questions, and
questions of vanities, those shun, for they unprofitable and vain.

Of good questious.
Naaman asked Elias the Prophet, 4. Reg. 5. 18.
whether if his master should go up to the Idols Temple and worship, he might
do so or no.

The Eunuchus Eunuchus
asked Philip, the exposition of these words: He was lead as a sheep to the
slaughter. Act. 8. 23. Esaias. 52. 7.

John asked this question: Mat. 11. 3
Art thou he that shall come, or shall we look for an other.

Mary asked this question: Luke. 1. 34

Lord whether shall we go? Thou have the words of eternal life.

Nichodemus asked this question: John. 3. 4. 9
How can a man be borne in his age? Again: How can those things be done?

Of vain questions.
The Serpent moved this vain question: G^n. 3. 2
why has God forbidden you to eat of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil?

The Apostles asked this vain question: Act. 1. ^
Lord when will thou restore the kingdom of Israel? whom Christ controlleth:
It is not yours to know times, or the moment of times.

Peter asked this vain question of his fellow John, John. 22. 2^
Lord what shall this John do?

Whether God the Father has the Son. Son.


Whether Christ might possible have taken upon him the likeness of an Ass,
Ass.
of a woman, of a feend, or of a Goord. Goord.
How that Goord should have preached, done miracles, or have hanged upon the

Angel.

Whether a Mouse Mouse.
can eat Christ's body or no? And if she do eat it, what danger can
be levied upon her head. These and such like be fond and foolish questions.

Rabbi.
What this word Rabbi does signify.
AND to be called Rabbi. Mat. 23. 7
This word Rab signifies one that is above his fellows, and is as good as a
number of them: And we may see by the repeating of it, how proud a title it
was. Now they were called Rabbi, which by laieng on of hands were uttered and
declared to the world to be wise men. Theo. Beza.

Christ forbids not to give just honor to magistrates and masters, but
condempneth ambition and superiority over our brothers faith, which office
apperteineth unto Christ. Geneua.

The chief purpose of Christ in this place is, to teach us not so to depend
upon men, as though it were not lawful to break their decrees, or to decline
from their authority: for there is one only Father, Lord, Master, to whom
we are so bound, that by no means we may decline at any time from his
precepts. D. Whitegift.

They said unto him Rabbi. John. 1. 3^
The name of Rabbi was common to great men, and such as were of honor and
great calling. But here the Evangelist shows an other use of this word in
his time, namely that Doctors and interpreters of the word of God, were
saluted with this name, although therefore as yet they knew not Christ to be
the only master of his Church, yet notwithstanding they being moved with the
title that John gave unto him, they do count him as a Prophet and a teacher,
which is the first step to aptness to be taught. Marl. upon John. fol. 34.

RACHA.
What the word Racha does signify.
RAcha is a reproachful word of Hebrewe, Mat. 5. 22.
and signifies Thistles or Brambles. Finallye, it is a rebukefull word,
signifieng the extremity of the person that speaks it.

It signifies in the Sirians tongue an idle brain, and is spoken in contempt.
Geneua.

Chrysostom says, that it is a word of the Sirians speech, by which is
showed that the mind is moved to anger.

But under this word fool, does Saint Austen and Chrysostom understand all
manner of injury, opprobrious and spiteful words. Tindale.

This word Racha in English signifies ill or affliction. Christ means
there, that he only is not a murderer that by hand kills his brother, but
also he that curses or desires evil to his neighbor, as those do that bid
the Pestilence, the Fever quartaine, Saint Antonies evil, or such other
execrations, and should be punished as heretics and blasphemers of God, as ye
may read Leuit. 20. 9. Genesis 27. 29. 1. Cor. 5. 5. Such evil sayers has no
part in the kingdom of God. He that calls his brother fool, that is to say,
contemn him, mocking, or as men call it now a days, flowting, or lowting,
commits such murder, as is worthy hell fire, and eternal dampnation, the
which vice is reprehended, Psalm. 56. And was so abhorred of the Gentiles, that
many would rather suffer death then sustain the slander of a pestilent
tongue. Cham that cursed his Father. Genesis 9. The Philistines that counted
Sampson for a fool. Iudic. 16. Michol that lowted David her husband, 2. Reg.
6. The Ammonites ye contemned David's ambassadors, 1. Reg. 10. The Boys that
mocked Elizeus the Prophet. God punished the same with death, more cruel then
the magistrates do punish murderers. Whooper.

RACHEL.
The opening of this place following.
RAchel weeping for her children, Iere. 31. 15
etc. To declare the greatness of Gods mercy in delivering the Jews, he
shows them that they were like to the Beniamites or Israelites: that is,
utterly destroyed, and carried away, insomuch that if Rachel the mother of
Benjamin could have risen again to seek for her children, she should have
found none remaining. Geneua,

That is to say, all that compass about Bethleem, for Rachel Jacobs wife, who
died in Childbed, was buried in the way that leads to this town, which is
also called Ephrata, because of the fruitfulness of the soil and plenty of
corn. Theo. Beza.

RAGVEL.
How Raguel and Iethro were not both one person.
AND when they came to Raguel their Father, Exo. 2. 1^.
he said. This Raguel is not Iethro, but is the Father of Iethro, and the
graundfather of Zephora, and was also the Priest of Madian. For it was a like
order with them, as it was with the Jews, that the son possessed the office
of his Father. T. M.

RAHAB.
How this woman Rahab was no harlot.
OF Rahab, Iosu. 2. 1.
some do say, that when the men which Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho came
into her house, they came not to commit fornication with her (for she was no
harlot) but there to hide themselves. Other say, that in times past she had
been an harlot, but now she was none, although that name remained with her
still, Lyra.
as in Math. 4. it is said, that Jesus came into the house of Simon the leper,
not that he was then a leper, but before that time he had been a leper, of the
which Christ had healed him, and yet the name remained still with him, so that
he was called still by that name, Simon the leper. Other be against these and
say, that this Rachab was afterward joined in marriage to Salmon, which was one
of the principal men in the Tribe of Judah, and therefore do think it
unlikely that he would have taken such a woman to his wife, whcih had been
then named to be an harlot, or ever had been any before: But she was a woman
that kept an honest vi^ling house^ both for strangers and other, and no
harlot. For where as we have in our speech, a woman harlot, they have in the
Chaldish tongue, Iosu. 2. 4.
a woman that sells victuals. Ric. Turnar.

Of Rahabs lie she made.
But I wist not what they were. Albeit Rahab lied of a good intent, yet in that
she lied she did amiss, for as Saint Paul says, We must not do evil that
good may come of it. For as her act in hiding Gds people, came of faith and is
praised. Heb. 11. 31. and James. 2. 2. So her lie came of the fear and
weakness of the flesh, Iosu. 2. 11.
and therefore not to be followed. The Bible note.

How Rahab confesses God.
For the Lord your God, he is the God of heaven above, and in earth beneath.
God is no respecter of persons, for hear a daughter of Abraham by faith and
worthy confession found among the Gentiles, yea, in the sinful City of
Jericho.

Herein appears the great mercy of God, that in this common destruction,
he would draw a most miserable sinner, to repent, and confess his name.
Geneua.

How Rahab and Ruth are named in the Genealogy of Christ.
Salmon begat Booz of Rahab. Math. 1. 5.
Rahab and Ruth are here named among the grandmothers of our Savior, thereby
to signify that he was not only come of the Jews, and for the Jews, but
also the Gentiles, and for the salvation of the Gentiles. Sir. I. Cheek.

Rahab and Ruth being Gentiles, signify that Christ came not only of the
Jews and for them, but also of the Gentiles and for their salvation. Geneua.

RAINEBOVV.
What the Rainbow signifies,
WHen Noe was come out of the Arc and had made an Altar, Genesis 9. 13.
and offered up beasts and birds thereon unto the Lord: GOD gave first of
all unto him his word, by the which he promised that he would no more
destroy the world with water. And for the confirmation thereof, he gave the
Rainebowe for a sure token betw^ene him and man. For in that Bow is expressed
both the couloures of Water and Fire, the one part being blew, and the other
read, that it might be a witness to both the judgments, the one past, the
other to come. Lanquet.

RAVEN.
How the Ravens feeds Elias.
I Have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there. 4. Re. 17. 4
To strengthen his faith against persecution, God promises to feed him
miraculously. Geneua.

How God feeds the Ravens.
And ye young Ravens ye cry. Tsa. 147
For their crieng is as it were a confession of their need, which cannot be
relieved, but by God only: then if God show himself mindful of the most
contemptible fowls, can he suffer them to die with famine, whom he has
assured of life everlasting. Read Job. 39. 3. and Luke 12. 24. Geneua.

Of the Raven and Dove, sent out of the Arc.
The Raven that Noe sent out of the Arc, Genesis 8. 9
went going and returning until the waters were dried up upon the earth. But
the Dove which he sent out, finding no resting place for her foot, returned
unto him into the Arc, suffering Noe to pull her in unto him with his hand.

Upon this place the Bible note says thus: It seems the Raven being a
wild and unclean foul, fed of the dead carcases, and therefore refused to
turn again into the Arc. But the Dove being of nature a tame foul, and
used to clean food, and finding no place to rest on, suffered her self to be
received in again.

REALITIE.
When and by whom this word was invented.
THis term Reallye present, you shall understand that after Bonifacius the
third, about the year of ^ur Lord. 603. obtained of Phocas the false
Emperor to be the head of the Church (by the crafty practice of the Monks
Pas^hasius, Hunbe^^cus, Guinudus, Algerus, Rogerus, Franciscus, Anselmus, and
such other) was Realitie invented, and termed to the Sacrament before that
time the spiritual eating was magnified among the old Doctors. Antony Gyloy.

RECEIVED.
How we have nothing but that we have received of God.
WHat have thou that thou have not recei^ed. 1. Cor. 47.
This sentence ought to be had in remembrance of all men. For if we have
nothing but that we have received, what can we deserve I pray you, or what
need we dispute of our merits? It comes of the free gift of God that we
live, that we love God, that we walk in his fear, where be our own
deseruings then? Sir. I. Cheek.

RECONCILIATION.
What it is to be reconciled.
TO be reconciled, is (all hatred and discord set aparte) to restore all the
former love, concord, friendship, necessity, and familiarity that was wont
to be. Marl. upon Math. fol. 97.

Reconcile, to make at one, to bring in grace and favor. Tindale.

REED.
What is signified by this Reed.
A Reed shaken with the Wind. Mat. 11. 7.
The Reed is a figure of the doctrine that is not of God, but wauereth with
the wind. Tindale.

How the power of Egypt is compared to a Reed.
Thou trustest now in this broken staff of Reed, 4. Re 18. 21
to wit, on Egypt. Egypt shall not only be able not to succor thee, but
shall be an hurt unto thee. Read Esaias. 6. 36. and Ezech. 29. 6. Geneua.

A Reed shaken with the wind, does signify a man inconstant. As in Math. 11.
7. and Luke. 7. 24. Geneua.

What is meant by the bruised Read.
A bruised Reed shall he not break, etc. Mat. 12. 26
By the bruised Reed and smoking flax, the adversaries of Christ, the Scribes
and Phares^es are understood whose power is likened unto a bruised R^ede, and
their fur^e wherewith they persecuted the innocent, unto smoking flax, so that
it had been as easy for Christ to have destroyed them, as it is to break a
sunder a bruised Reed, or to quench smoking flax. Some suppose that the same
should be understood of the Publicans and sinners, whom he did not contemn
nor despise, but mercifully called them unto him. Sir. I. Cheek.

A bruised Reed, etc. That is, he will bear with them that is infirm and
weak. Geneua.

READING.
What profit comes of reading holy Scripture.
AVgustine Augustine
says: Reading cleereth and purges all things: who will ever be with God;
must evermore pray and read. Aug. de t^mpor. sermo. ^.

If we either read not the Scriptures our selves, Augustine
or be not desirous to hear other read them, then are our (...)dictnes turned
into wou(...) and then where we might have had remedy, we shall have judgment.
Aug. Ser. 55.

Hear me ye men of the world, Chrisosto^
get ye the Bible, that most wholesome remedy for the soul: if ye will nothing
else, yet at the least, get the new testament, S. Paul's Epistles, and the
Acts, that may be your continual and earnest teachers. Chr^. upon the Coll. in
h^. 9. Hom^^

Isidore says, Isidore^
says, that reading brings great profit to the hearers.

Tertulian Tertulian
says, when ye come together to the reading of holy Scripture, we feed our
faith with these heavenly voices, we raise up our affiaunce, we fasten our
hope. And again he calls the reading of the scriptures, the feeding of our
faith.

Let one of you take in hand the holy book, Chrisosto^
and let him call his neighbors about him, and by the heavenly words let him
water their minds, and also his own. Chris. in Genesis hom. 6.

Being at home we may both before and after meat, Chrisosto^
take the holy book in hand, and thereof receive great profit, and minister
spiritual food unto our souls. Chris. in Genesis Homi. 10.

Would God we would all do according as it is written, Origin
Search the Scriptures. Origin. in Esaias. Homi. 10.

Harken not heereto, only here in the Church, Chrisosto^
but also at home let the husband with the wife, the father with the child,
talk together of these matters, and both to and fro, let them enquire and give
their judgments, and would God they would begin this good custom. Chrisost. in
Math. Homil. 78.

Look. Scripture.

REGENERATION.
What this word (Regeneration) imports.
THis word Regeneration imports as much as a man might say, new birth. As if
after that we were once borne, we are borne yet again. And therefore it
imports forthwith a reformation fo the man, which is a rising again from the
dead, which is wrought in the spirit, as the last resurrection shall be wrought
in the flesh. Pet. Viret.

Regeneration stands chiefly in these two points: In mortification, that is
to say, a resisting of the rebellious lusts of the flesh, and in newness of
life, whereby we continually strive to walk in that pureness and perfection,
wherewith we are clad in Baptime.

How Regeneration is taken in these places following.
Ye which followed me in the regeneration, etc. In this work whereby the world
is changed, renewed, Mat. 19. 28
and regenerate, or to join this word with the sentence following, and so take
regeneration for the day of judgment, when the elect shall in soul and body
enjoy their inheritance, to the end that they might know, that it is not
sufficient to have begun once. Geneua.

By the washing of the new birth. Tit. 3. 5.
Baptime is a sure sign of our regeneration, which is wrought by the holy
Ghost. Geneua.

How this place is understood.
Except a man be borne of water and spirit. John. 3. 5
Nichodemus understood not the opinion concerning regeneration or new birth
of man. Therefore our loving and merciful Savior more plainly expounds
these things which before he spoke mystically teaching that to be borne again,
is nothing else, but to be borne of water and of the spirit, and that the same
is the true manner of regeneration. But all men for the most part by this
sentence of our Savior Christ understand Baptime, and many of them do hereby
make Baptime so necessary, that they affirm it impossible for a man to attain
to salvation, except he be washed with the water of Baptime: and so disorderly
they include the assurance of our salvation under the sign, when as the whole
Scripture attributes the grace and power of regeneration to the Holy ghost:
as may appear in diverse places of Scripture, but specially by these places
noted in the margent. Mat. 16. 16
And as touching this place we ought to understand the same simply of man's
regeneration and not of Baptime. Tit. 3. 5.
For the purpose of Christ was to exhort Nichodemus to newness of life,
because he was not capable of the Gospel, until he was a new man. Therefore
this is the simple meaning of this place. That it behooves us to be born
again, that we may be the sons of God, and also that the Holy ghost is the
Author of the second birth. Marl. upon Ioh. fol. 66.

REINS.
What they signify.
YE shall understand that the reins or kidneyes of a man is that entire part,
from which springs chiefly the strength and the desire of natural
generation, which effect or desire in man, because of all other effects it is
the most mightiest, therefore the Scripture, uses to call the secrets or the
privy thought or effects of a man, by the name of the reins or the kidneyes.
Insomuch as when the Scripture says that God knows all our hearts and our
thoughts, then the Scripture says: Scrutans corda and re^es Deus. God is the
searcher of hearts and reins, that is of the most privy and secret thoughts
that be in man. R. Tur.

Try out my reins and my heart. Psalm 26. 2.
By the heart and reins will he signify the delectations and affections of y^
flesh, which let him to follow God. As in the Psa. 16. 7. T. M.

My reins also teach me in the night. Psalm. 16. 7
God teaches me continually by secret inspiration. Geneua.

Examine my reins and my heart. Psalm. 26. 2
My very affections and inward motions of the heart. Geneua.

Thou have possessed my reins. Psa. 139 13
Thou have made me in all parts, and therefore most needs know me. Geneua.

Thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins. ^ere. 12. ^


They profess God in mouth, and deny him in heart, which is here meant by
the reins. Esaias. 29. 13. Math. 15. 8. Geneua.

REJOICE.
Wherefore we should chiefly rejoice.
Rejoice, Luke 10. 20
because your names are written in heaven. Though we should work miracles, and
cast forth devils, yet ought we not to rejoice therefore, for we shall have
no profit at all thereby, but other shall have the profit that come thereof.
But this ought to be our chief joy and comfort, that we are elect and chosen
in Christ Jesus, before the foundation of the world were laid, whose names are
written in the book of life. S. I. Chapter

RELEASEMENT.
How releasement and payment cannot stand togethers.
THe Lord forgave the servant his debt. Mat. 18. 27
By this it appears that salvation falls unto men, by releasement of the
debt, and not for satisfieng of the debt. For releasement and payment cannot
stand in one respect together. It overthrows Popish satisfaction, which (say
they) must be done by Pilgrimages, fasting and alms deeds. It quenches the
fire of Purgatory. For where the debt is forgiven, the debtor ought not to be
punished.

RELIGION.
How couples joined in marriage of diverse Religions, is doubtful.
THe prohibition of S. Paul is, that we draw not the yoke with the
unbelievers, 2. Cor. 6. 14
which thing is to be understood not only of doctrine, but of all trade of
life. For he that touches pitch (says Solomon) shall be defiled therewith.
For it cannot be, but that he which keeps company with the ungodly, must
needs himself gather some infection thereby. As Solomon keeping company with
Heathen women became an Idolater. Achab through the counsel of lezabel slew
the Prophets. Hemmyng.

Be not unequally yoked with the Infidels. 2. Cor. 6. 14
He seems to allude to that which is written. Deuteronomy. 22. 10. where the Lord
commands that an Ox and an Ass be not yoked together, because the match is
unequal. So if the faithful marry with the Infidells, or else have to do with
them in any thing unlawful, it is here reproved. Eccl. 13. 18. Geneua.

How the Devil is sorry to see the religion of Christ flourish.
Diabolus gentium vocatione cruciatur, etc. Leo in Epiph. ser. 6
The Devil is sore grieved with the calling of the Heathen (to the faith) and
with the daily decresing of his power: sorrowing to see himself forsaken, and
Christ the true King to be worshipped in all places: therefore he deuiseth
guyles, and imagines dissentions.

REMEMBER.
How God is said to remember.
GOd remembered Noe. This is not so to be understood, that there is any
forgetfulness in God. Augustine.
But the Scripture speaks after the manner of our speaking. As when we may
deliver a man that is oppressed and does it not, then it is said, we do
forget him. And when we begin to go about his delyueraunce, then it is said,
we do remember him.

REMNAVNT.
Of the remnaunt that God says he had reserved.
I Have reserved unto my self, seven thousand men, Romans 11. 4
etc. He speaks of remnaunts and reserved people which were chosen from
everlasting, and not of remnaunts that should be chosen afterward. For they
are not chosen because they were no Idolaters, but therefore they were no
Idolaters, because they were chosen and elect. Theo. Beza.

RENT.
What is meant by renting of clothes.
HE rent his clothes. Genesis 37. 29 34
It was specially used among the Hebrews, to rent clothes, when the glory of
God was contemned. And here, where they feared God so little, as to kill their
own brother. T. M.

Then they rent their clothes. Genesis 44. 13
To signify how greatly the thing displeased them, and how sorry they were for
it. Geneua.

What is meant by renting of our hearts.
Rent your hearts and not your garments. Joel Joel. 2. 13
means that it is to no purpose for men to have great store of ceremonies,
and to martyr themselves much in outward sight of the world, except their
hearts be broken before. And what manner of renting or breaking is it that God
requires in our hearts, it is, that we should be cast down and humbled before
him: that when we perceive any signs of his wrath (specially when we feel the
blow of his hand already) we should be patient, assuring our selves that all
comes for our sins: and that we do not as many do, who when they be
beaten with Gods rod, chawe their bridles like mules, and conceive I wot not
what a fierceness and bitterness, which serve to set them in a rage against
God, notwithstanding that, they make countenance as though they were well
tamed. But contrariwise (as I have said) it behooves our hearts to be rent,
according to the exhortation that is made unto us in the Psalm, by laieng our
hearts open before God, to the end that he should know all that is within it.
Then let us follow the said saying of the Prophet Joel, that we should not rent
our garments, but our hearts rather, for therein will the true repentance
show it self. Call. upon Job. fol. 46.

And rent your hearts, Joel. 2^ 13
etc. Mortify your affections, and serve God with pureness of heart, and not
with Ceremonies. Geneua.

REPENTAVNCE.
What Repentance is, and the definition thereof.
Repentance is an unfeigned tourning to God, whereby we being of a sincere
fear of God once humbled, do acknowledge our sins, and so by mortifieng our
old man, are afresh renewed by the spirit of God. Bulling. fol. 562.

Repentance is a very displeasure which man has in his heart of his sin,
the which ingenderesh in him an hatred against sin, and a desire to live
better in time to come, reserving his life to the will of God. Peter Viret.

Repentance is nothing but a conversion of the mind, and an alteration of the
former opinion, as appears by the saying of the Prophet: Turn unto me, Esa.
45. 22
and ye shall be safe. Eze 18. 31
Again, Act. 3. 19^
I will not the death of a sinner, but that he turn and live. Also, Repent and
amend, that your sins may be done away. Marl.

Repentance is an inward thing, which has his seat in the heart and mind,
and brings forth fruits, in changing the life. Marl. upon. Math. fol. 47.

Concerning this word Repentance (as they used) Penance, the Hebrew has in
the old Testament generally (Sob) Turn or be converted, for which the
Translation that we take for S. Hieromes, has most part (Conuert^) to turn,
or to be converted. And sometime (Agite poenitentiam). And y^ Greek in the
new Testament, has perpetually (Metanoeo) to turn in the heart and mind,
and to come into the right knowledge, and to a man's right wit again, for which
(Metanoeo) S Hieroms translation has sometime (Ago poenitentiam) I do repent.
Sometime (Poeniteor) I am repentaunt. Sometime (Habeo poenitentiam) I have
repentance. Sometime (Poenitet me) it repents me. And Erasmus uses much
this word (Recipisco) I come to my self, or to my right mind again. And the
very sense and signification both of the Hebrew and also of the Greek word is:
to be converted, and to turn to God with all ye heart to know his will, and to
live according to his laws, and to be cured of our corrupt nature with the
Oil of his spirit and wine of obedience of his doctrine, which conversion or
turning, if it be unfeigned, these four do accompany it, and are included
therein: Confession, not in the Priests ear, for that is but man's invention,
but to God in the heart, and before all the Congregation of God, how that we be
sinners and sinful, and that our whole nature is corrupt and inclined to sin
and all unrighteousness, and therefore, evil, wicked and damnable, and his
laws holy and just, by which our sinful nature is rebuked. And also to our
neighbor, if we have offended any man perticularly. Then Contrition,
sorrowfulness that we be such damnable sinners, and not only have sinned, but
are wholly inclined to sin still. Thirdly, Faith, of which our old Doctors
have made no mention at all, in the description of their Penance, that God for
Christ's sake does forgive us, and receive us to mercy, and is at one with us,
and will heal our corrupt nature. And fourthly satisfaction or amends making,
not to God with holy works, but to mine neighbor whom I have offended (if
any open crime be found in me) and submitting of a man's self unto the
Congregation of the Church of Christ. And note this, as satisfaction and amends
making is counted righteous before the world, and a purging of sin, so that:
the world, to whom I have made a full amends, has no farther to complain:
even so faith in Christ's blood is counted righteousness, and a purging of all
sin before God. Moreover he that sins against his brother, sins also
against his Father almighty God, and as the sin committed against his
brother, is purged before the world with making amends or asking forgiveness.
Even so is the sin committed against God, purged through faith in Christ's
blood, only for Christ's ^ake. John. 8. 24. Except ye believe that I am he, ye
shall dye in your sins, that is to say, If ye think that through any other
Sacrifice or satisfaction to Godward then me, ye remain ever in sin before
God, how soever righteous you appear before the world. Wherefore now, whether
ye call this (Motanoe) Repentance, Conversion or to^^ing again to God, either
amending, etc. Or whether ye say, repent, be converted, turn to God, amend
your living, or what ye list, I am content, so ye understand what is meant
thereby, as I have now decla^ed. Tindale. fol. 37.

HOW repentance is attributed to God.
I will repent of the plague that I thought to bring upon them. (...). 18. 8.
When the Scripture attributes repentance unto God, it is not that he does
contrary to that which he has ordained in his secret counsel. But when he
threateneth, it is a calling to repentance, and when he gives man grace to
repent, the threatening (which ever contains a condition in i^) takes no
place: And this the Scripture calls repentance in God, because it so
appears to man's judgment. Geneua.

The Lord repented of the plague. (...). 26. 19
In the divine nature there is no such affections or chaung^ablenesse. But God
is said after the mauner of men to rep^^it, when he does not execute that he
had denounced, or does defer the plague which he had threatened. Geneua.

I repent me that I made Saul King. 1. Re. 15. 11
God in his eternal counsel never changes nor repents, as ver. 29. though
he seems to us to repent, when many things goes contrary to his temporal
election. Geneua.

The repentance of God, is only changing of the deed. And as the affection
of mercy and of fatherly love is attributed unto God: even so does the
Scripture attribute unto God, after his manner of speech to affliction of anger
and of fury, and of repentance also, for men cannot otherwise speak of God.
T. M.

It repented the Lord that he had made man. Genesis 6. 6.
God does never repent, but he speaks after our capacity, because he did
destroy him, and in that as it were did disa^owe him to be a creature. Geneua.

Of Esaus repentance.
And found no place of repentance. Heb. 12. ^
Nouatus did not well understand this place, gathering thereby, that they
which do of a fraylenesse sin, (though they repent never so truly) ought not
be received to favor again. For here is not one word spoken of remission of
sins, but of the right of the first borne, which being sold for a vile mess
of po^age, could not be recovered again, though he sought it with tears. Sir.
I. Cheek.

The meaning of this place following.
My repentings are rouled together. Ose. 11. ^
Meaning that his love, wherewith he first loved them, made him between doubt
and assurance what to do: and herein appears his fatherly affection, that
his mercy toward his, shall overcome his judgments, as he declares in the
next verse. Geneua.

Of two manner of repentance.
I find (says Frith, to Rastall) two manner of repentance, one is without
faith, and is such a repentance as Judas and Rastals Christen men which
continue still in sin, have at latter end, which does rather purchase them an
halter, then the remission of sins. Another repentance follows
instification and remission of sins, and is a flourishing fruit of faith, for
when by faith we do perceive ye favor and kindness y^ our loving father has
showed us in his son Jesus Christ, and that he has reconciled us unto
himself, by the blood of his son, then begin we to love him, the more we
hate the body of sin, and lament and be sorry that our members are so frail,
that they cannot fulfill ye law of God, and so in mourning and bewailing our
infirmity, it causes us to abstain both from meat and drink and worldly
pleasures, which is the pure fasting, that we talk off: but you understand it
not. And this repentance comes not to purge the sins which is committed
before, but onely^ takes an occasion by the sins before committed, to know
what poison there remains in our flesh, and seeks by all means to make us
hate this body of sin, and to subdue it with all manner of works, that God
has appointed, to the intent that it should in time to come, no more displease
God our most merciful Father, which of gentleness so often pardons and
forgiueth us, as I touched before. This is the manner of repentance which I
find in scripture, but this helps that we should sin no more: but what
Rastall dreameth I wot not. But to express the uttermost what I mean by
repentance, mark this example. Example of an house.
If a man build an house, which does cost him much labor and money, and have
laid no sure foundation, but that when a tempest comes his house does fall,
then will he be very sorry, and repent that he has so foolishly bestowed his
money and labor. Notwithstanding all this great sorrow and repentance cannot
set up his house again which is fallen, but only it takes an occasion by the
ruin of the house, to teach the owner wit against another time, y^ when he
builds again, he may make a sure foundation. Even so, though thou repent
never so much, that cannot get remission of thy sins: that is, but that must
be pardoned only by ye faith in Christ's blood. Nevertheless it does teach
thee wit, and learn thee to tame thy body, and subdue it, and cast a low
foundation, that in time thou may the better resist the assaults of the
Devil, the world and the flesh. This does Frith teach of Repentance, let the
world take it as they will, but Christ's Sheep do hear his voice. I. Frith.
fol. 74.

REPROBATION.
A definition of this word Reprobation.
REprobation is the most wise purpose of God, whereby he has before all
eternity constantly decreed without any injustice, not to have mercy of those
whom he has not loved, but has ouerhipped that by their just condemnation, he
might declare his wrath toward sinners and also his glory. Pet. Mar. upon the
Romans fol. 293.

How the just cause of reprobation is hid unto us.
We say not that Gods ordinance is the cause of reprobation, but we affirm
that the just causes of reprobation are hid in ye eternal counsel of God, and
known to his godly wisdom alone, but the causes of sin of death and damnation
are evident and manifestly declared to us in ye scriptures, to wit, man's
fr^e-wil consenting to the deceivable persuasion of the devil, wilful ^inne,
and voluntary rebellion, by which entered death into this world, the contempt of
graces and Gods mercies offered, with the heaping up of sin upon sin, till
damnation justly came. The causes I say of sin, death and damnation, are
plainly noted unto us in Gods holy Scriptures. But why it pleased God to show
mercy to some, and deny the same to others, because ye judgments of God, are
a devouring depth, we enter not in reasoning with him, but with all humility
render thanks to his Majesty, for the grace and mercy, which we doubt not but
of his free grace, we have received in Christ Jesus our only head. Knox.

RESERVING OF BREAD.
Look. Bread.

REST.
How rest is here understood.
IF they shall enter into my rest. Heb. 4. 3.
God by his rest after the creation of his works, signified the spiritual
rest of the faithful, yet he swear to give rest in Canaan, which was but a
figure of the heavenly rest, and dured but for a time. Geneua.

How rest is taken here for the land of Canaan.
They shall not enter into my rest. Psa. 95. 1^.
That is, into the land of Canaan, where he promised them rest. Geneua.

How rest is sometime taken for doctrine.
This is the rest: give rest to him that is weary. Esa. 28. 1^
This is the doctrine whereupon ye ought to stay and rest. Show to them that
are weary and have need of rest, what is the true rest. Geneua.

RESVRRECTION.
How that we all do rise by Christ.
I Am the resurrection and the life. Ioh. 11. 2^
That is, I am the Author of resurrection and life. For those that believe in
me will I raise up at the last day unto life everlasting, and those that are
dead, shall live by me, because they believed in me. Tindale.

Christ restores us from death, to give us everlasting life. Geneua.

The meaning of this place following.
Since they are the children of the resurrection. Lu. 20. 36
That is, men pertakers of the resurrection. For as we say truly y^ they shall
live indeed, which shall enjoy everlasting bliss, so do they rise indeed
that rise to life, though this word resur^^ction be taken generally, it
betokens also to ye wicked which shall rise to condemnation, which is not
properly life, but death. Beza.

For although the wicked rise again, yet that life is but death, and an
eternal destruction. Geneua.

Infallible tokens of Christ's resurrection.
By many infallible tokens, etc. Act. 1. 3.
He calls these infallible tokens, which were otherwise termed necessary:
now, in that Christ spoke, and walked, and eat, and was felt of many: these
are sure signs and tokens, that he truly rose again. Beza.

What the first resurrection is.
This is the first Resurrection. Apo. 20. ^.
Which is to receive Jesus Christ in true faith, and to rise from sin in
newness of life. Geneua.

Of two resurrections.
There be two sorts of resurrections expressed in Gods word, of which it is
written: Likewise as Christ was raised up from death by the glory of the
father: even so we also should walk in a new life. Romans 1. 4.
This new life is the resurrection from sin. Christ's raising is the other
resurrection, that is of the body, which began in Christ, Romans 3. 11
the first fruits of the dead, for Paul says, He that raised up Christ from
death, shall quicken our mortal bodies, and in another place, 1. Co. 15. 44
It shall rise a spiritual body. Roger Hutchynson.

REVVARD.
How reward is deserved.
HE shall not loose his reward. Mat. 9. 41.
That is, whatsoever thou workest at the commandment of God, thou shall have
the same reward therefore, that appertains to a faithful worker, which is
life everlasting, not that it is due to thy work, but to thy faith, out of the
which, thy work proceeds: for we receive that promise by faith, and not by
works. Tindale.

Shall reward thee openly. Mat. 6. 6.
We ought not to think, because that Christ makes here mention of a reward,
that we do merit or deserve any thing, but rather we ought to acknowledge that
God of his mere mercy rewards in us his own gifts, for what has he that
gives alms that he has not received. He then that gives any manner thing to
a poor man, gives not of his own, but of those goods that he has received
of God. Sir. I. Cheek.

Or else ye shall have no reward of your father which is in Heaven. Mat. 6. 1.
This word Reward is always taken in the Scriptures for a free recompense, and
therefore the schoolmen, do fondly set it to be aunswerable to a deserving,
which they call merit.

Concerning this word (Merces) Reward, there has been much strife. The
occasion of the Contention has been this: Forasmuch as that thing which every
man shall receive of God, according to the measure of his good works and
godliness of this life, Christ does call it Merces multa and copiosa:
Therefore some have gone about to prove, that we by our good works, otherwise
called merits, do deserve Heaven, and then (if that be true) as Saint Paul
says, Christ died but in vain. For and if the benefit of justification come
by works, then no gramercie for the grace of God, for the merits of Christ.
To solute therefore this cauillation, learned men do gr^unt, that the
quyethesse of conscience, good name and good fame in this life, and life
everlasting after this life, is called (Merces) not for because that our
merits or good deeds in this life, be able to deserve the joys of heaven. For
as Paul says, Non sunt condign passionis, etc. Nor again it is not called
(Merces) because that the merits and good works that we do, are but Gods
gifts, Qui operatur in nobis and velle and perficere, but our receipt is
called (Merces) reward, albeit most meruailously surmou^teth all our
deseruings, be they never so great. Properly a reward is that which a man
deserves through his labor and pains taken in bringing any thing to pass.
To this end and purpose, to provoke us to labor most lustely in the Uineyard
of the Lord. After the same manner of speech: a natural father for the tender
love that he bears toward his child doing but meanly in virtue and coming
forward in learning, yet he will say to the encouraging of his child: Son,
go too, and continue as thou have begun, and thy reward or thy part shall not
be the least of all thy brethren. And according to this his promise, he
endueth him liberally, when he makes his Testament, not for that the child
had deserved the one half of that he had done for him before, but because he
loved him. Richard Turnar.

RICHES.
What the true use of riches is.
THe true use of riches is, to make them serve the possessour thereof, and not
they that have them in possession to serve them, and to be well content to
depart from them, whenever the glory of God, and the commodity of their
neighbor shall require. Basil.

The rich that trust in their goods are discommended.
Then a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. Mat. 19. 24
He is here called rich that puts his confidence in his goods, which thing
they do, that have all their delight and joy therein. Tindale.

Only they that put their trust and confidence in their own riches, are here
understood. For there be many godly rich men, that use their riches and
substance according to the will and pleasure of God. Sir. I. Cheek.

Woe be unto you that are rich. Luk 6. 24.
Here he speaks of ungodly rich men, which have all their confidence and
trust in their riches. For riches of themselves are the good creatures of God,
and his blessing, if we use them according to his blessed will. Sir. I. Cheek.

For though a man have abundaunce, yet his life stands not in his riches.
Luke 12. 15
Christ condemns the arrogancy of the rich worldlings, who as though they
had God locked up in their Cofers and Barnes, set their whole felicity in
their goods, not considering that God gave them life, and also can take it away
when he will. Eccl. 11. 19. Geneua.

Of the rich man's burieng.
The Scripture says of the rich man, that he was buried Luke 16. 22
And what says it of Lazarus? There is no mention made of his burial:
insomuch that it is not known whether he were eaten with dogs, or whether he
were cast abroad in the fields: the Scripture speaks not of it. It speaks
of the burial of the rich man. Contrariwise if Gods children happen sometimes
to lie unburied: is it to be concluded therefore, y^ they are accursed? No, like
as when the wicked are buried, it is not to be said that they are blessed in
their death. But it is to show us, that God executes not his temporal
punishments after one egall rate in this world, but reserueth the chief to
himself till the latter day. Call. upon Job. fol. 472.

How the poor and rich are joined together.
Look. Lazarus.

RIDLES.
Why Ridles were put forth in seasts.
SAint Austen demands the cause why Sampson put forth his Ridle, and he
answers, Iud. 14. 12.
because in such seasts, men are sometimes wont when they have well drunk, to
be somewhat full of talk, and somewhat too intemperately to rebuke others,
which things turns for the most part into brawling and chiding, and to avoid
that, grave men were wont to put forth Ridles or Problemes, omitting dangerous
talk, and turning their mind to the exposition of the things put forth.
Whose example Sampson followed, and set forth a reward for him that should
expound his question. As though the knowledge and sharpness of the mind
ought to be rewarded, and contrary punishment is instituted for ignorance and
sluggishnesse, Pet. Mar. upon Iudi^. fol. 218.

RIGHTEOUS.
Who are righteous.
FOr thee have I found righteous. Genesis 7. 1.
They are righteous before God, that love their neighbor for Gods sake
unfeignedly, having the spirit of God, which makes them the sons of God, and
therefore are accepted of God as good and righteous. As it is written. Genesis 18.
23. T. M.

Found righteous. In respect of the rest of the world, and because he had a
desire to serve God, and to live uprightly. Geneua.

If I shall find in Sodom. 50. righteous, Genesis 18. 26
etc. God declares that his judgments were done with great mercy, forasmuch
as all were so corrupt that not only fifty, but ten righteous, could not be
found there, and also that the wicked are spared for the righteous sake. Geneua.

How and by whom we are righteous.
We are counted thoroughly righteous before God, by imputation of Christ's
righteousness, not in our selves, but in him, in whom we be united to him by
faith. Beza.

How the righteous and not the unrighteous, is allowed to praise God.
Exultate iusti in Domino, rectos decet collaudatio. O ye righteous rejoice ye
in the Lord: Psa. 33. 1.
for it becomes the upright livers to give praise or to be thankful. S.
Austen upon this place deuideth all the people of this world into two sorts of
men, Iustos and iniustos, rectos and curuos, sieve rectos and prauos, into
righteous or unrighteous, upright or crooked, or straight or froward livers.
There are neither of these two sorts of men, but they are contented to praise
God, and to speak well of the Lord: but yet (says Saint Austen) mark: the
Prophet desires not the unrighteous wranglers, liars, thieves and adulterers,
nor the crooked crafty hasters and deceitful deceivers to praise the Lord,
why so? For it is written: Non est speciosa laus in ore peccatoris, quia non
est a Domino missus. The praise of God to come out of the mouth of the wicked
man, it is not comely nor acceptable in his sight, for he is not sent of the
Lord so to do: and no marvel, for this we know by experience, that there is
none of us all, which being but a man, wise and of good judgment, but he had
rather be dispraised then praised of such whose life is impure, filthy and
unclean, for their praise commonly are not dealt, but unto such whom they
favor, because in their living they be like unto themselves: so y^ their
praise is a dispraise, or at the least a suspected praise, that he whom they
praise, is rather a naughty man the^ a good man. If this be true in wise men,
how much more then must it be true in God, the father and fountain of all
wisdom, to refuse and set naught by the praise of the proud, the wicked and
ungodly men. In consideration whereof the Prophet now says: Exultate iusti in
Domino, rectos decet collaudatio. O ye righteous rejoice ye in the Lord, I
speak not to the wicked, nor to the crooked, wayward nor froward people of
this world, if I should, they would peradventure not deny to give praises unto
the Lord. Nam curuus and prauus, quam diu sibi been est, Deum laudat, and
benedicit, si autem male, blasphemat: rectus semper laudat sicut Job. For the
crooked and froward man says S. Austen, so long as he has all things after
his own will and pleasure, so long he ^audeth and praises God. But if he be a
little pinched with poverty and adversity, then he raileth and curses, then
he banneth and blasphemeth God and his most righteous works: but the righteous
and upright men, they evermore laud and praise God, as well in adversity as in
prosperity, even as Job did, therefore says the Prophet, to you that be
righteous, that is, men truly penitent, and sorry for your offenses, trusting
through Gods mercy all your sins to be covered, and not imputed, nor never to
be laid to your charge, to you I say: Exultate iusti in Domino: O ye righteous
rejoice ye in the Lord.

The proves.
Christ allowed the praise and confession of Peter when he said: 1. proof.
Tu es Christus filius Dei viui. Thou art Christ the son of the living God.
And dispraised the man possessed with the Legion of Devils, who confessed as
much as Peter did, when he ran to Jesus and fell down upon his knees and
worshipped saying: Quid mihi and tibi, Jesus filij Dei altissimi, O Jesus the
son of God the most highest, what have I to do with thee.

When Simon Magus had fained him to believe in Christ, 2 proof.
and would have bought ye gift of ye holy ghost for money, Peter said unto him,
thy money perish we thee, because thou weenest ye the gift of God, may be
obtained with money. Thou have neither part nor fellowship in his business,
for thy heart is not right in the sight of God, etc.

The wicked may with their mouth cry: 3. proof.
Domine, Domine, but note what I set by their praise (says Christ) I shall
say unto them, Ego non noui vos, I know you not, I allow you not, nor it was
no pleasure to me to hear you pray or preach: It was but blasphemy, Non erat
collaudatio, it was no true praise, it was but such as Simon Magus did give
unto God, or such as Bariesu would feign have given unto God, whom Saint Paul
rebuked saying: O thou full of guile and of deceit, the son of the Devil,
the enemy unto all goodness, thou ceasest not to subuerte the right ways of
the Lord. Richard Turnar.

RIGHTEOUSNESS.
What righteousness is.
Righteousness is the mere gift of God, without the works of the law, and
is not paid as a due debt, but bestowed on the believers as a grace. Beza.

The name of righteousness is not restrained to any one man, but betokens
all the worshipers of God without exception. Howbeit the Scripture calls
those men righteous, not which are accounted such for desert of their works,
but such as do long after righteousness, because that after the Lord has
embraced them with his favor, in not ^aieng their sins to their charge, he
accepts their rightful endeavor, for full perfection of righteousness. Call.
upon the. 5. Psa. ve. 13.

The Christian righteousness.
Although (says the Christian) I am a sinner by the law, and under the
condition of the law, yet I despair not, yet I dye not, because Christ lives
which is both my righteousness and everlasting life, in that righteousness
and life, I have no sin, no fear, no stinge of conscience, no care of death.
I am in deed a sinner, as touching this present life, and the righteousness
thereof, and the child of Adam, where the law accuses me, death reigns
over me, and at length will devour me. But I have another righteousness of
life, above this life, which is, Christ the son of GOD, who knows no Sin,
nor Death: but is righteous and life eternal: by whom this body being dead and
brought into dust, shall be raised again, and delivered from ye bondage of the
law and sin, and shall be sanctified together with the spirit. Luther upon
the G^l. ^ol. 6.

Of the righteousness which comes by faith.
But the righteousness which is of faith, Romans 10. 6
speaks on this wise, Say not in thy heart, etc. That is to say, he that is
justified through faith, is not curious, he doubts of nothing that pertains
to his salvation, but^ is persuaded that in Christ he has the full redemption.
He asks not for signs from heaven, where he knows his Savior and
mediator is: he goes not about to learn the truth by the dead: for he
believes that Christ being risen from death, did teach all truth. Read the 13.
chapter of Deuteronomy. Sir. I. Cheek.

Say not, etc. Because we cannot perform the law, it makes us to doubt, who
shall go to heaven: and to say, who shall go down to the deep to deliver
us thence? But faith teaches us, that Christ is ascended up, to take us up
with him, and had descended into the deapth of death, to destroy death and
deliver us. Geneua.

And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness.
Romans 4. 11.
This is the righteousness of faith, whereof mention is made here and in many
other places, if through faith we do take hold upon the mercy of God declared
unto us in our Savior Jesus Christ. We are through the same faith counted as
righteous before God, as if we had fulfilled the law to the uttermost. Sir. I.
Cheek.

Saint Austen says thus in one place: The righteousness of the Saints in this
world, stands rather in the forgiveness of sins, then in perfection of
virtues, wherewith agree the notable sentences of Barnard: Not to sin is the
righteousness of God: but the righteousness of man is the merciful kindness
of God, he had before affirmed, that Christ is to us righteousness in
absolution, and therefore that they only are righteous that have obtained
pardon and mercy. Call. in his Inst. 3. b. chap. 11. Sect. 12.

How by the righteousness of Christ we obtain to be justified.
By the only mean of Christ's righteousness we obtain to be justified
before, etc. Saint Ambrose has excellently well showed how there is an example
of this righteousness in the blessing of Jacob. For as Jacob having not
deserved the pre-eminence of the first begotten son, hid himself in the
apparel of his brother, and being clothed with his brothers coat, that
favored of a sweet smell, he crept into the favor of his father, and
received the blessing to his own commodity, under the person of an other: So
we do lie hidden under the precious pureness of Christ our elder brother,
that we may get a testimony of righteousness in the sight of God. The words
of Ambrose be these: Whereas Isaac smelt the savor of the garments,
peradventure this is meant thereby: that we are not justified by works but by
faith: because fleshly weakness hinders works, but the brightness of
faith, which meriteth forgiveness of sins, ouershaddoweth the error of
deeds. And truly so it is, that we may appear before the faith of God unto
salvation, it is necessary for us to smell sweetly with his odor, and to have
our faults covered and buried with his perfection. Calvin in his Insti. 3.
book. cha. 11. Sect. 23.

How righteousness is to be understood.
Righteousness is even such faith, as is called Gods righteousness, or
righteousness, that is of value before God. For it is Gods gift: and it
alters a man and changes him into a new spiritual nature, and makes him
free and liberal to pay every man his duty: for through faith a man is purged
of his sins, and obteineth lust to the law of God, whereby he gives God
his honor, and paieth him that he owes him, and^^ men he does service
willingly wherewith so ever he can, and paieth every man his duty. Such
righteousness can nature, freewill, and our own strength never bring to
pass. For as no man can give himself faith, so can he not take away
unbelief, how then can he take away any sin at all. Wherefore all is false
hypocrisy and sin, whatsoever is done without faith or in unbelief, as it
is evident in the. 14. chap. to the Romans. ver. 23. though it appear never
so glorious or beautiful outward. Tindale. fol. 43.

Of outward and inward righteousness.
It shall be righteousness unto us before the Lord. Deu. 6. 25
The outward deed is righteousness unto the avoiding of punishment,
threatenings, and curssings, and to obtein temporal blessings: but unto the life
to come, thou must have the righteousness of faith, and thereby receive
forgiveness of sins, and promise of inheritance, and power to work and
love. T. M.

But because none could fully obey the law, we must have our recourse to Christ
to be justified by faith. Geneua.

No man can perfectly fulfill the law: therefore we must have recourse to
Christ by faith, in whom we are reputed as just. The Bible note.

How we receive our righteousness by the mere gift of God. Example thereof.
Like as the earth engendereth not rain, nor is able by her own strength,
labor, and travail, to procure the same, but receives it of the mere gift
of God from above: so this heavenly righteousness is given us of God, without
our works or deseruings: Look then how much the earth of it self is able to do
in getting and procuring to it self seasonable showers of rain to make it
fruitful: Even so much and no more, are we able to do by our own strength and
works, in winning this heavenly and eternal righteousness, and therefore shall
never be able to atteine it, unless God himself by mere imputation and by his
unspeakable gift, do bestow it upon us. Luther upon the Gal. fol. 5.

The meaning of these places following.
Of righteousenesse because I go to my Father. John. 16. 10
Wherefore the wicked must needs confess that he was just and beloved of the
Father, and not condemned by him as a blasphemer or transgressour. Geneua.

And righteousness of the God of his salvation. Psalm. 24. 5^
This word righteousness may be expounded two ways: either for all the
benefits of God, whereby he proves himself to be righteous and just of
promise toward the faithful, or for the fruit of righteousness Truly David's
meaning is nothing doubtful: namely, y^ it is not for such men to look to
obtain the fruit of righteousness, as unrighteously dishonor Gods holy
service. And again, that it is not possible that God should disappoint his
true worshippers, because it is his property to a^ouch his righteousness with
benefits. Call. upon the. 24. Psalm.

Blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness, Math. 5. ^
for they shall be satisfied. But what can all our righteousness be before
God? Shall it not according to the saying of y^ Prophet, be counted as a most
filthy and defiled cloth? And if all our righteousness be straightly judged,
it shall be sound unjust, and having less force. What therefore shall become
of our sins, whereas not even our righteousness it self shall be able to
answer for it self? Therefore with all our might crieng out with the Prophet
as loud as we can, Enter not into judgment, etc. With all humbleness let us
run to the throne of mercy, which only is able to save our souls. I. Gough.

Look. Hunger.

RIGHT HAND.
What is meant by Gods right hand.
THE right hand is wont in the Scripture to betoken the strength and power
whereby God works all things effectually, as the right hand of the Lord has
done mightily. Psalm. 118. 16. And is also taken for help, as in Job. 14. 15.
Psalm. 138. 7. 139. 10. And in the Revelation of John. 1. 17. Marl. upon the
Apoc.

Christ is called Gods right hand. Augustine
Psa. 118. 15. 16. The right hand of the Lord has done meruailes. The right
hand of the Lord has gotten the victory, it is used also for the glory of
the Father, concerning which he says to his son: Sit on my right hand. And
in some place for everlasting joy and life.

Math. 25. 33. And he shall set the Sheep on the right hand, and the Goats on
the left.

Saint Hierome Hierome.
in his exposition of Paul's first Chapter to the Ephesians says: He has
declared the power of God by the similitude of a man, not because a seat is
placed, and God the Father sits thereon, having his son sitting there with
him: But because we cannot otherwise conceive how the son does judge and
reign, but by such words to our capacity. As therefore to be next to God or
to depart far from him is not to be understood according to the distance of
places, but after men's merits, because the Saints are heard by him, but the
sinners (of whom the Prophet says, Behold they that get themselves from
thee shall perish) are removed far enough for coming near him at all. Even
so like wise to be either at the right or left hand of God, is to be taken so,
that the Saints are at his right hand, and sinners at his left. As our Savior
himself also in the Gospel affirming the same does say, that at ye right hand
are the sheep, and the Goats at the left. Moreover, this very word (to Sit)
does argue the power of a Kingdom, by which God is beneficial to them on whom
he does vouchsafe to sit, insomuch as verily he does rule them, and has them
always in his guiding, and does turn to his own beck or government, the
necks of them that before ran out of the way, at randon, and at liberty.
Bullinger. fol. 73.

Saint Austen Augustine.
in his book De fide and simbolo, says, We believe that he sits at the
right hand of God the Father: yet not so therefore as though we should think
that God the Father is comprehended within the limits of a man's body: so y^
they that think of him should imagine that he had both a right and a left side:
And whereas it is said that the father sits, we must not suppose that he does
sit with bended hammes, least peradventure we fall into the same sacrilege for
which the Apostle accurseth them that have changed the glory of the
incorruptible God, into the similitude of a corruptible man. For a detestable
thing it is to place God in such a likeness in a christian Church: and much
more wicked it is to place it in the heart, where the Temple of God is verily
and indeed, if it be cleansed from earthly desires and errors. We must
therefore understand that at the right hand is as much to say, as with
greatest happiness, where righteousness and peace and gladness is: Even as
also the Goats are placed at the left hand, that is, in misery, for their
iniquities to their pain and torment. Whereas God therefore is said to sit,
thereby is not meant the placing of his limits, but his judicial power, which
his majesty never wants in bestowing worthy rewards, to those that are
worthy of them, etc. Bullinger. fol. 74.

What the right hand does signify in this place following.
That I may turn me to the right hand or the left. Genesis 24. 49
The right hand or the left hand is no more to say, but tell me one thing or
another, that I may know whereunto to stick, and is a phrase of the Hebrews. T.
M.

Of the right hand of Christ.
To sit on my right hand or on my left hand, Math. 20. 23.
is not mine to give (says Christ) but unto them for whom it is prepared of
my Father. This answer made Christ to the mother of Zebedes children, who
desired of him that her two sons might sit in his kingdom, the one upon his
right hand, and the other upon his wft, and is as much to say, that according
to this present state wherein ye^ see me^ I am not come to distribute places
and seats of my kingdom: for know ye that from the beginning my Father and I
have distributed and appointed them Therefore be not you careful as though
they were void. This is the true understanding of this place. I. Proctour.

ROB.
How robbing is no these when God commanded it.
AND shall rob the Aegypti^ns. Exo. 3. 22.
Here ye may not note that they stale, and therefore ye may steal, but note
that it was done at Gods commandment, and therefore was it a just and a
righteous thing to be done, for he is not the author of evil. T. M.

This example may not be followed generally, though at Gods commandment, they
did it justly, receiving some recompense of their labors. Geneua.

ROCK.
How Christ was the Rock.
THe Rock was Christ. 1. Cor. 10. 4^
S. Chrysostom says upon this place, Petra ^rat Christus, etc. The Rock was
Christ, for it was not by the nature of the Rock that the water gushed out,
but a certain other spiritual Rock, wrought all these things, that is to
say, Christ. Jewel. fol. 254.

How Christ is the true Rock.
Because thou have said to me (says Christ to Peter,) Thou art Christ the
son of the living God: I do also sa^ to (...) Thou art Peter (for before he
was called Simon) but this name that he should be called Peter, was given him
of the Lord, to the end that by that figure he might signify the Church. For
because Christ is Petra the Rock, Petrus is the Christian people. For Petra is
the principal name: And therefore Petrus comes of Petra, and not Petra of
Petrus. As Christus, Christ, is not named a Christiano, but Christianus, a
Christian, is named of Christus, Christ. Therefore says Christ, Thou art Peter,
and upon this Rock which thou have confessed, upon this Rock which thou have
known, saying: Thou art^ Christ the son of ye living God, I will build my
church: y^ is, upon my self being the son of the living God, will I build my
church: I will build thee upon me, and not me upon thee: for men that be
builded upon me^ did say: I am of Paul, I am of Apollo, and I of Cephas, y^
is, of Peter. And other who would not be builded upon Petrum, Peter, but upon
Petram the Rock did say, I am of Christ. And the Apostle Paul, when he did
know y^ he was chosen or preferred, and Christ despised by some men said: Is
Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the name of
Paule^ And as not in Paul's name^ no more were ye baptized in the name of
Peter, but in the name of Christ, that Peter might be (...) upon the^ Rock
not the Rock upon Peter. Nowel. fol. 109.

Upon this Rock, etc. Upon that faith whereby thou have confessed and
acknowledged me: for it is grounded upon the iufallible truth. Geneua.

Christ is the Rock whereupon the true Church is builded. No man can lay
any other foundation besides that which is laid already, which is Jesus
Christ. 1. Cor. 3. 11. Peter is through faith, one of the stones wherewith the
Church is builded. Sir. I. Cheek.

ROD.
The opening of this place of Mark, contrary to Matthew and Luke.
Commanded them that they should take nothing unto their journey save a rod.
Mar. 6. 8^
Save a rod only, although in Math. 10. 10. and Luke. 9. ^. be should seem to
forbid them a rod, yet the text means not so indeed, but forbids Coa^^,
Sh^es, Rod, etc. By a figure, to the intent only that they should utterly put
from them all carfulness of any such provisions. For if he had so mo^^ y^
they should have taken no such things with them:

Then should it no^ now be lawful for any preacher to have any of those
things with them when they go to preach. And therefore Mark, expressing
Christ's mind more plainly, gives liberty to take a rod or a walking staff,
to ease themselves withal when they were weary. Tindale.

Take nothing to your journey, Luke. 9. ^.
neither staves nor s^rip, etc. Because this journey was short, and but for a
time, Christ willed that they should make have and take nothing with them,
whereby they might be let any thing at all from the business. The Bible
note.

To the end they might do their charge with greater diligence, when they had
nothing to let them. Geneua.

Of the rod and staff of God, what is meant thereby.
Virga tua, and beculus tuus: ipsa me consolata sunt: Thy rod and thy staff
has comforted me. Psalm. 23. 4.
A rod does serve to beat, to punish, and correct children for their faults:
And a staff ser^eth not only for a weapon to defend a man from his enemies,
but also a staff serves to save a man from falling. So that by the rod, ye
must understand our cross, correction and persecution, that the godly do
suffer in this life. And by the staff our help and our preservation in our
daily dangers, which (...) were not able to endure, if God had not been with
us and preserved us. Ric. Turnar.

ROME.
HOW Babylon is proved to be Rome by the Scriptures.
She is fallen, Apoc. 14. 8
she is fallen, even Babylon that great City. signifieng Rome, for as much as
the vices which were in Babylon are found in Rome in greater abundance, as
persecution of the Church of God, oppression and slavery, with destruction of
the people of God, confusion, superstition, Idolatry, impiety, and as Babylon
the first Monarch was destroid, so shall this wicked kingdom of Antichrist have
a miserable ruin, though it he great, and seems to extend throughout all
Europa. Geneua.

And their corpse shall lie in the streets of the great city, Apoc. 11. 8
which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where our Lord was crucified.
Meaning the whole jurisdiction of the Pope, which is compared to Sodom and to
Egypt, because the true liberty to serve God is taken away from the
faithful, and Christ was condemned by Pilate, who represented the Roman power
which should be enemy to the godly.

Objection.
What impudency is it to affirm that Christ was crucified at Rome, and all
the world knows he suffered death at Jerusalem.

Answer.
Rome being understood for the Regiment, etc. As is aforesaid, the proof is
evidently made, that our Savior Christ suffered, and was crucified at Rome.

Reasons to prove that Christ suffered at Rome.
By whom was he condemned, was it not by Pilate the deputy or lieuetenant of
the Roman Empire, etc?

For what cause or crime was he judged to dye? Was it not for treason pretended
to be committed against the Roman Empire?

With what kinds of execution was he put to death? Was it not such as was
usual by the laws of the Romans, for such heinous offenses, as were
unjustly laid to his charge?

Finally was not the place where he suffered within the circuit Conclusions of
this first prose with application of the former reso^s.
of the Roman Empire? May and not then justly affirm that he was crucified at
Rome, when by the Roman Judge he was condemned for a crime against the Roman
state, and executed by a kind of death appointed by the Roman laws, and in a
place of the Roman dominion.

As for the Jews, they had at that time no authority to put any man to death,
as they confess themselves, when Pilat^ had them take him and judge The Judge.
him according to their own law, meaning they should decree some light
punishment against him, they answered. It is not lawful for us to put any man
to death, and he has defe^ued to die.

As touching to cause, The cause
although they accused him of blasphemy, because he made himself the son of
God, yet could he not be condemned for that, because Pilate wild admit no
accusation, but such as contained a crime against the Roman laws.

And as for the death of the cross, The kind of death.
it is manifest to be prope^ to the Romans, for the Jews would have stoned
him, if they might have condemned him for blaphemie, according to y^ law^ of
Moses.

And that the Angel in that place The place
by no means can understand Jerusalem, it is manifest by these reasons: First
that he calls it the great City, which term could never be spoken of
Jerusalem. Also us calls it Sodoma and Egypt, which was the Sea of the
monsterons beast Antichrist, which in other places is often called Babylon,
etc. Add hereunto that Jerusalem the place where Christ suffered, was
utterly destroyed in Saint John's time, which wrote this revelation.

For the second proof, The second proof.
see the. 13. Chapter of this Revelation, and the. 17. chapter, where this
evil shapen beast is described with. 7. heads and. 10 horns. Also see Daniel
the 7. Chapter, describing the four beasts, especially the fourth beast,
which all men must confess to be the Monarch of Rome, which is the fourth
Monarch.

The third Argument or proof The third proof.
is taken out of the 17. chapter, verse. 9. of this Revelation. Where the
Angel expounding to Saint John the mystery of the beast with seven heads,
declares in very plain words, that the seven heads do signify seven
hills, whereupon the woman sits: which al writers, Poets, historiers,
cosmographers with one consent do confess to be Rome, which is builded upon 7.
hills, 7. Hills.
whose names are these: Palatinus, Capitolinus, Auentinus, Exquilinus,
Viminalis, Quirinalis, and Caelius. The Poet Virgil describes Rome with this
Periphrasis in his Georgikes.

Septem quae vna sibi muro circundedit arces.
Which has compassed. 7. hills within her walls.
The fourth and last proof Th iiii. proof.
is taken out of the. 17. chapter of this Revelation, the last verse, where the
Angel expounds, that the woman which Saint John saw (which was the great
whore Babylon) is that great City which has cominion, over the kings of the
earth. And what man is so impudent, as to say, that any other City in Saint
John's time had dominion over the kings of the earth, but Rome.

How Babylon is proved to be Rome by the Doctors.
Ireneus one of the most ancient and autenticall writers that the Church has,
The first Doctor.
in the fifth book of his treatise against all hereliks, speking of the sea of
Antichrist upon the last verse, upon the. 13. chap. of this Revelation, where
it is said, y^ the number of the beasts name is six hundred sixty and six,
shows that the opinion of many in his time was, that seeing this name
Lateinos, which is in English the Latin man or Roman, in the numerall Greek
letters contains this number, that Antichrist must be sought at Rome his
words are these: Sed a Lateinos, nomen fex centorum sexaginta sex numerorum,
etc. Et valde verisimile est quoniam verissim regnum hoc habet vocabulum,
Latini enim sunt qui nunc regnant Also (says he) this name Lateinos containing
the number of 666. is thought to be the name of Antichrist, and it is very like
so to be, for that which most undoubtedly is a kingdom has that name: for they
be Latins which now do reign.

Tertulianus, The second Doctor.
a very ancient writer in his third book against Marcion, which denied that
Christ had a true body, wherefore. Tertulian uses this reason against him:
That thing which has a figure in it, might be a thing of truth, and so
discoursing of many things figured, and the figures of them, comes to these^
words, Si^ and Babylon apud Iohannem nostrum, etc. Even so does Babylon (in
the Apocalipsis) of our Saint John, bear the figure of the City of Rome,
which is altogether as great and as proud in reigne^ and as great a persecuter
of the Saints as Babylon was.

Chrysostom in his Commentaries upon the second Epistle to the
Thessalo^^ans, Capter. 2. The third Doctor.
in his fourth Homelye: where as Paul speaks of the manifestation of
Antichrist says, they knew what was the cause that he was not presentlye
revealed ^ but when that stay is taken away, he should be r^^^^led in his
due time: Chrysostom (...)death this stay too be the Roman Empire, which
must give place to Antichrist: that like as the Persians came in place of the
Chaldeans, the Grecians in the place of the Persians, and the Romans in the
place of the Grecians: Even so our Antichrist should invade the Empire of the
Romans: Vacantem imperi^ principatum inuadit, and tentabit ad se capere
hominum and De^ imperium. Antichrist (says he) shall invade ye vacant
principality of the Empire, and shall assay to draw unto himself the Empires
both of God and man. Hitherto Chrysostom. And it is manifest to all men that
the papa^ grew and took increase, by the decay of the Empire, and at the fall
of the Monarch, they challenged full possession of all dominion, both
spiritual and temporal.

Of the same judgment is S. Hierome writing upon ye same place of Paul unto
Aglasia in ye eleventh question, The iiii. Doctor.
whose words are these: Nec vult aperti, etc. Neither will he openly say, that
the Roman Empire should be destroyed, which they y^ govern it think to be
everlasting: wherefore according to the revelation of S. John, In ye forehead
of the purple whore, there is written a name of blasphemy, which is Rome
everlasting.

The same Hierome in his. 13. Verba eiusdem.
book of his Commentaries of the Prophecy of Esaias upon the 24. chapter
writes thus: Licet ex eo quod iuxta septuaginta, etc. Forasmuch as the
seauentie Interpreters, write not the daughter Babylon, but the daughter of
Babylon, some do interpret the rest, not Babylon in Chaldea, but the city of
Rome, which in the revelation of S. John, and the Epistle of Peter is specially
called Babylon.

The same in his preface unto the book of Didimus, De spiritu sancto, Verba
eiusdem.
which he translated out of Greek into Latin writing to Pauinianus, he
utters these words: Cum in Babylone versarer, etc. Of late (says he) when I
was in Babylon, and was an inhabitant of the purple harlot, and lived after the
laws of ye Romans, I thought to entreat somewhat of the holy Ghost.

The same, Eiusdem.
writing to Marcella a virtuous gentlewoman of Rome, whom he allured to forsake
Rome, and to dwell near unto him in Bethleem, one especial reason that he
uses to persuade her, Marcella.
is this, that as Bethleem whither he would have her to repair, is situated in
the holy land, and the place consecrated to the birth of Christ: so Rome where
she desired to remain, was the Babylonicall harlot, according to the
Revelation of Saint John, appointed for the birth of Antichrist, which there
should arise and exercise tyranny, and from thence should deceive the whole
world with his wicked wiles. Hue vsque Hieronimus.

Ambrose writing a Commentary upon the Revelation of S. John, The fifth Doctor.
is of the same judgment.

Primasius also a very ancient writer, The sixth Doctor.
who likewise Commenteth upon the Apocalips, expounds these Prophesies of
Antichrist, to be fulfilled in the Roman Empire.

Augustine in his work De ciuitate Dei, The 7. Doctor.
not once or twice but oftentimes is bold to call Rome Babylon, and Babylon
Rome. As in his. 6. book and. 17. Chapter, he calls Rome an other Babylon in
the West. And in his. 18^ book and second chapter, he calls Babylon of
Chaldea, the first Rome, and Rome of Italy the second Babylon, willing men to
consider that in the beginning of the City of God (which was the Church in
Abraham's time) the first Rome that was Eastern Babylon her enemy, was builded
in Chaldea, and about the same time that the first Babylon was destroyed, least
the city of God should, lack her enemy, the second Babylon which is Rome in
Italy, was erected. Hue vsque August.

Look more in Antichrist. Babylon.

If Caput come of Capio, which signifies take, Verses.

The^ may Rome well be called so, which nothing does forsake:

RVDIMENTS.
What these Rudiments were, and wherefore they were called poor.
Weak and beggarly Rudiments. Gael. 4. 9.
The poor and weak Rudiments, be circumcision, sacrifices, and the choice of
days and meats, and other observation and keeping as a thing necessary to
obtain everlasting life, and the grace of God, He calls them poor or weak,
because they be not, nor consist of themselves, whose nature only consists
in signifieng: And what strength so ever they have, that they have, because
they import or signify some weighty thing. Doctor Heynes.

The Galathians of Panims began to be Christians, but by false Apostles were
turned backward to begin a new the Jewish ceremonies, and so in steed of
going forward toward Christ, they ran backward from him. Geneua,

Sabbath.
Wherefore the Sabbath was instituted.
YE shall do no labor therein, but hallowe the sabbath, Iere. 17. 22
as I commanded your fathers. The foundation of the faith is to believe Gods
premise, and that he made the whole world, and does also govern it, and
further, that he knows and will judge all things, etc. Those things did ye
law require, in keeping of the sabbath, to confess both with word and sign,
and to give diligent heed to the hearing and interpreting of the law, to think
of the glory of God, and to relieve the faithful soul with the food of the
word, to minister occasion also unto ye simple, that they likewise might
attempt such things in their houses amongst their household folks, to be
pitiful over the wearines of such neighbors as labored sore all the week
long and relieve them, to attend and give heed to the exercises of the spirit,
and to the consolation and comforting of their neighbors, not only to
abstain from outward works, and fulfill their appetites and lusts, for that
did the Lord forbid. The Sabbath should be applied to the lawful serving of
God, not to sinfulness and wantonness. It is commanded to be sanctified, and
not polluted and defiled with naughtiness. To God alone must we also keep
it, and call on his name: Other Gods or Gods fellows, ought we not to enquire
of, nor fall down unto them: But when such occasions come as turn our rest
into occupation and labor, then ought we remember that the Sabbath was
ordained for man, Mar. 3. 27.
not man for the Sabbath. So that in the mean season, the fear of God, and
the charity toward our neighbor (which are the chief and principal things
in the observation of the Sabbath) be not lightly regarded. T. M.

A Sabbath of rest it shall be unto you. Sabbath, feasts, and new moons,
signify the joy and gladness of the conscience, the renewing of man, and the
rest wherein we rest from our own works, not doing our wills, but Gods,
which works in us through the Gospel and glad tidings, while we earnestly
believe it. Exech. 20. 12. Exo. 20. 8. and 31. 13. Deuteronomy. 5. ^4.

God rested the seventh day. Genesis 2. 2.
What we should learn in this, Exo. 28. 8.
we may plainly see in the commandment: Keep holy the Sabbath day: for that
day was instituted for this cause: because then God rested from his works, and
in that day a rest is commanded us, that in it we should do no manner of
work, and why (dearly beloved) shall we rest? God is not pleased with
idleness, he will not have us like the idle men, y^ in the ninth hour of the
day stand still idle in the market, but God commanded us to keep that day
holy unto him, which is to serve him in it, and not our selves. Deering.

And went into the Sinagogue on the sabbath day, Act. 13. 14
and sat down. The truth never fears the light, but comes forth boldly, as
it appears by Paul and Barnabas, which entered into the common Sinagogue.
Also here we do learn why the sabbath was instituted, not for vain sports
and pastimes, but that upon that day the people should give themselves to
prayer, to read and hear the word of God. Sir. I. Cheeke^

How the Priests brake the Sabbath, and were blameless.
That on the Sabbath, the Priests in the Temple brake the Sabbath, and are
blameless. Not that the Priests brake the Sabbath in doing that which was
commanded by the law: but he speaks this to con^ute the error of the
people who thought the Sabbath broken, if any necessary work were done that
day. Geneua.

See that ye keep my Sabbath. The Sabbath, beside that it served to come and
hear the word of God, and to seek his will, and to offer, and to reconcile
themselves unto God. It was a sign unto them also, and did put them in
remembrance that it was God that sanctified them with his holy spirit, and not
they themselves with their holy works. T. M.

What is meant by the second Sabbath.
It came to pass in the second Sabbath. Luke. ^. ^.
Epiphanius notes well in his treatise where he confuteth Ebion, that the time
when the Disciples plucked the ears of corn, was in ye feast of unleavened
bread: now whereas in these feasts, which kept many days together, as the feast
of tabernacles, and the passover, their first day and the last were of like
solemnity. Le^^. 23. Luke fitly calls the last day the second Sabbath,
though Th^ophilact understand it of any of them that followed the first. Beza.

The feasts which contained many days, as the passover, and the feast of
tabernacles had two Sabboths, the first day of the feast, and the last. Geneua.

A s^ieng of S. Austen concerning the Sabbath.
It is less evil (says Saint Austen) to go to plough, Augustine.
then to play upon one of those days, meaning the Sabbath days.

Why the Machabees fought on the Sabbath. Objection.
The Machabees fought and defended themselves upon the Sabbath day,
notwithstanding God had appointed that day to rest.

Answer.
The Machabees might lawfully defend themselves upon the Sabbath day, 1. Mac.
2. 41
for Christ expounds the law, man is not made for the Sabbath, but ye Sabbath
for the man. And the Jews did evil (says D^do) being besieged upon ye Sabbath
day, to stand and to yield them unto their enemies. Yet did not ye Machabees
proclaim y^ it should be lawful upon ye sabbath day to go to ye field.

The meaning of this place following.
And bear no burden on ye Sabbath day. Luke. 17. 21.
By meaning the Sabbath day, he comprehends ye thing ye is thereby signified,
for if they trangressed in the ceremony, they must needs be culpable of the
rest. Read Exo. 20. 8. And by ye breaking of this one commandment, he makes
them transgressors of y^ whole law, for as much as ye first and second table
are contained therein. Geneua.

The signification of the Latin word Sabbathum.
Sabbathum was among the Jews accounted the seventh day, in the which they
fasted in remembrance of ye seven days in the which they were fatigate going
fasting in ye desert of Arabia, or they came to the mount of Sinai. S. Austen
upon the Psalms, writes ye Sabbathum is taken three manner of ways, for ye.
7. day is called by the name in the which almighty God rested, after his work
of 6. days. Sabbathum is also eternal quietness. Moreover, Sabbathum is the
conscience of a quiet mind, advanced by hope of the time to come, not being
shaken or vexed with storms of things present. Eliote. Look. Winter.

SACKCLOTH.
What the wearing of sackcloth signifies.
SAckcloth, sheering of men's heads, renting of their garments, and casting of
dust and ashes upon them, were ^okens of repentance, or else of great sorrow
among the people of the East countries in old time. Call. upon Job. fol. 29.

SACRAMENT.
What Sacrament is.
A Sacrament says S. Austen, Augustine
is the sign of an holy thing. If it be the sign of an holy thing, then it is
not the very thing it self, which it does signify. I. Frith.

It seems to me that a Sacrament is an outward sign, wherewith the Lord
seals to our consciences the promises of his good will toward us, to
sustain the weakness of our faith. And we again on our behalfes, do
testify our godliness toward him, as well before him and the Angels, as
before men. We may also with more briefness define it otherwise: As to call
it a testimony of Gods favor toward us, confirmed by an outward sign, with
a mutual testifieng of our godliness toward him. Whether of these
definitions, it differs nothing in sense from the definition of S. Augustine,
which teaches that a Sacrament is a visible sign of an holy thing, or a
visible form of an invisible grace: but it does better and more certainly
express the thing it self, for whereas in the briefness there is some
darkness, wherein many of the unskillful sort are deceived, I thought good in
more words, to give a fuller sentence, that there should remain no doubt.
Call. in his Instit. 4. b. chap. 14. sect. 1.

A Sacrament as S. Austen defines it, is a sign of an holy thing. It cannot
be both the sign and the thing signified.
But if the Sacrament be Christ's body (as the Papists say it is) then can it
not be a Sacrament, that is the sign of an holy thing, for it is the holy
thing it self. So that they must either deny ye sacrament to be ye body and
blood of Christ, either else the Sacrament thereof. For one thing cannot be both
the sign and the thing signified, because they be in that respect most
contrary the one to the other. Crowley.

A Sacrament is a visible sign ordained of Jesus Christ, as a seal to
confirm us the better in the faith of the promises, the which God has made
us, of our salvation in him. Vnet.

Sacrament, is a sign representing such appointments and promises, as the
Rainbow represents the promise made to Noe, that God will no more drown
the world. Tindale.

This word Sacrament, is as much to say, as an holy sign, and represents
always some promise of God, as in ye old Testament, God ordained that the
Rainbow should represent and signify unto all men an Oath that God swear to
Noe, and to all men after him, that he would no more drown the world with
water, so the Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, has a promise
annexed, which the Priest should declare in the English tongue: This is my body
that is broken for you: This is my blood that is shed for many unto the
forgiveness of sins: This do in the remembrance of me ^aith Christ. Luke.
22. 19. and 1. Cor. 11. 24. If when thou see the sacrament, or eatest his
body, or drinkest his blood, thou have this promise fast in thy heart (that his
body was slain, and his blood shed for thy sins) and beleeuest it, so art thou
saved and justified thereby: if not, so helps it thee not, though thou herest
a thousand Masses in a day, or though thou do nothing else al thy life long,
then eat his body and drink his blood: no more then it should help thee in a
dead thirst to behold a bush at a Tavern door, if thou knew not thereby, ye
there were wine wtin to be sold. Tin.

This word sacrament, did not signify ye same with the old Writers, as it
does now in ye Church, for they call a sacrament, the oath or religious bond,
which was of ye strength of an oath. So they called y^ soldiers oath, whereby
they swear when they should go a warfare for the Common wealth, The soldiers
sacrament.
that they would serve faithfully, The soldiers sacrament, as we may perceive
by Seruius and Vigetius, in their books of war matters.

Augustine defines a sacrament in this sort. The visible sacrifice (says he)
is the sacrament of the invisible sacrifice, that is to say ye holy sign. And
again: A sacrament (says he) is a visible form of an invisible grace, etc.
Musc. fol. 272.

S. Austen describes a sacrament thus: The word of God coming to the Element
makes ye sacrament. And again, in another place he says: A sacrament is a
thing, wherein the power of God under the form of visible things, Master of
the sentence^.
does work secret salvation. And the Master of the sentences does describe a
sacrament none otherwise: A Sacrament (says he) is an invisible grace, and
has a visible form: and by this invisible grace (says he) I mean remission
of sins. In the b. of Mar. fo. 1352.

What the Sacrament does signify.
The signification and substance of the Sacrament is, to show how we are fed
with the body of Christ, The signification of the sacrament.
that is, that like as material bread feeds the body: so the body of Christ
nailed upon the Cross, embraced and eaten by faith, feeds the soul. The
like representation is also made in the Sacrament of Baptime, that as our
bodies is washed clean with water, so is our souls clean with Christ's blood.

How the sacrament is called the body of Christ.
It is called the body of Christ, that is to say, Sacrament called Christ body.
it signifies the body of Christ. Glosa de consecra. did. 2. Hoc est.

The right consecrating of the sacrament.
The same Christ that did adorn and beautify the Table is now present, and he
does consecrate the same also. For it is not men that does make these things
that be set before us, of the consecration of y^ Lords table, to be y^ body and
blood of Christ: but ye same Christ which was crucified for us. The words are
pronounced by the mouth of the Priest, but the things are consecrated by the
power and grace of God. This is (says he) my body, by this word are the things
y^ are set before us consecrated. And even as y^ voice which says, grow and be
multiplied, and replenish y^ earth, was but once spoken, but yet does at all
times by the work of nature, feel effect to generation: so that voice also was
but once spoken, and yet it gives sure stay to the sacrifice, throughout al
y^ tables of the Church even to this day, and from henceforth til his coming.
Chrysostom does here compare y^ words y^ Christ spoke at y^ insitution of his
supper, to ye words y^ God spoke, when he appointed man to be multiplied by
generation, affirms y^ the same power y^ works still in ye one, does still
work in ye other also. Not to charm out ye substance of bread^ and to charm in
y^ substance of Christ, under ye accide^ts of bread (as you do teach, meaning
Watson). But y^ as by natural order y^ generation of mankind is continued
according to ye first voice, so ye invisible graces y^ were promised, by ye
death and bloudshedding of our Savior Christ, are by y^ sacramental use of
these creatures according to his commandment, continually preached to our
senses, and by ^aith received into our souls. Crowley.

How the sacrament is a memorial or sign of Christ's death.
If Jesus have not dyed, Wherefore the Sacrament was instituted
whose memorial and sign is this Sacrifice? Thou see what diligence he gave
that we should continually keep in memory that he dyed for us, etc. Here
Chrysostom calls the Sacrament a memorial or sign of Christ, and that it
was instituted to keep his death in perpetual remembrance. And where he
calls it a Sacrifice, he means it to be a remembrance of that holy
sacrifice that Christ made upon the C^osse once for all, for he can be
sacrificed no more, seeing he is immortal. I. Frith.

How the sacrament is received with our mouth.
Rabanus Maurus says, Received with mouth.
The sacrament is received with the mouth of our body: but the body of Christ
is received into the inner man, and that with the spiritual mouth of our soul.

How the sacrament is more then bare bread or wine.
Our Bread and Cup be not of the common sort, Augustine
as in steed of Christ, bound togethers in ears of corn and twigs, as they
(that is the Maniches) do foolishly imagine: but by undoubted consecration,
Sacra^ is more then bare bread.
it is made unto us mystical or sacramental bread, it does not grow such:
wherefore that food that is not so made, although it be bread and wine, it is
a nourishment of refection, but not a sacrament of religion, otherwise then
that we bless and give thanks to God in all his gifts, not only spiritual
but corporal also.

How the sacrament is made of two natures.
Ireneus says, that the Sacrament is made of two natures, Of two natures.
of an heavenly nature, and of a terrenall and earthly nature: now take away
the substance of bread, and what earthly nature or substance, remains in
this holy Sacrament?

How sacraments are no cause of grace.
In Sacraments, No cause of grace.
the only promise of God by Christ, both by word and sign, are exhibited unto
us: which promises, if we apprehende by faith, then is the grace increased in
us, and the gift of God by faith received, is by the Sacrament ^ealed in us.

What ought to be considered in sacraments.
S. Augustine Augustine
says: in Sacraments we must consider, not they be indeed, but what they
signify.

All mysteries or sacraments must be considered with inward eyes, Chrisost^
that is to say, spiritually.

How the sacraments are holy whether the minister or receiver be good or bad.
S. Augustine in this place against the Donatists, Aug. con. lit. Per. li. 2.
ca. 47.
shoots not at this But, whether Christ's very natural body be received
with our mouths, but whether the Sacraments in general be received both of
good and bad. And he declares, that it is all one water whether Simon Peter,
or Simon Magus be christened in it: all one Table of the Lord and one Cup,
whether Peter sup thereat or Judas: all one Oil, The evil minister or
receiver hurts not the Sact.
whether David or Saul were anointed therewith. Wherefore he concludes thus:
Memento ergo sacramentis Dei, etc. Remember (says S. Austen that the manners
of evil men hinder not the sacraments of God, that either they utterly be not,
or be less holy: but they hinder the evil men themselves, so y^ they have the
sacraments to witness of their damnation, not to help of their salvation.

And all process spoken there by S. Austen, is spoken chiefly of Baptime
against the Donatists, which said y^ Baptime was naught, if either the Minister
or receiver were naught. Against whom S. Austen concludes that the sacraments
themselves be holy, and be all one, whether the Minister or receiver be good
or bad. Cranmer. fol. 63.

What the old fathers do teach of the sacrament.
Ireneus, S. Agustine, and other ancient Doctors, yea and the Canon law does
teach, there must be both the outward Element, which in Baptime is water, and
in the Lords supper, bread and wine, and the outward grace, as the two
principalls thereof: Take away the bread and wine, and then it is no sacrament.

How the sacrament is our body.
Because Christ has suffered for us, Augu. in ser. de sacra. feria. Pas.
he has betaken unto us in this sacrament his body and blood, which he has
made also even our selves, for we also are made his body, and by his mercy we
are even the same thing that we receive. And after he says: Now in the name
of Christ ye are come, as a man would say to the Chalice of the Lord, there are
ye upon the Table, and there are ye in the Chalice. Here ye may see that the
Sacrament is our body: and yet it is not our natural body, but in a mystery.
I. Frith.

If you will understand the body of Christ, hear the Apostle which says: Ye
are the body of Christ and members. 1. Cor. 12. 27. Therefore if ye be the body
of Christ and members, your mystery is put upon the Lords Table, ye receive
the mystery of the Lord, unto that you are, you answer Amen, and in
aunswering subscribe unto it. Here we may see, the Sacrament is also our body,
and yet is not our natural body, but only our body in a mystery, that is to
say, a figure, sign, memorial, or representation of our body. For as the bread
is made of many grains or corns, so we (though we be many) are bread and one
body, and for this property and similitude, it is called our body, and bears
the name of the very thing, which it does represent and signify. I. Frith.

As the sacrament of the Altar is our body, even so it is Christ's.
First understand ye, that in y^ wine which is called Christ's blood, is admixed
water, which does signify the people y^ are redeemed with his blood: so that
y^ head, which is Christ, is not without his body, which is the faithful
people, nor ye body without the head. Now if the wine when it is consecrate, be
turned bodily into Christ's blood, then it is also necessary that the water
which is admixed, be bodily turned into ye blood of ye faithful people: for
whereas is one consecration, must follow one operation: and whereas is like
reason, there must follow like mystery. But whatsouer is signified by the water,
as concerning ye faithful people, is taken spiritually, therefore whatsoever
is spoken of the blood in the wine, must also needs be taken spiritually, This
is Bartrams reason upon a. 700. years since.

How in the sacrament, there can be no accident without his substance.
In ye sacrament of ye Altar (says I. Puruay) I. Puruay.
after y^ consecration there is not, neither can be any accident Accident^
with y^ substance, but there verily remains ye same substance, and the very
visible and incorruptible bread, and likewise ye very same wine, y^ which
before y^ consecration were set upon ye Altar, to be consecrate by y^ Priest:
likewise as when a Paga^ or Infidel is baptized, he is spiritually converted
into a member of Christ, and yet remains y^ very same man which he before
was, in proper nature and substance. B. of M. 649.

Of a new article invented in the sacrament.
Innocentius the third Pope was the head of Antichrist, who after the letting
loose of Satan, invented a new Article of our faith, A new article of our faith.
and a certain fained verity touching the sacrament of the Altar: that is to
say, that the Sacrament of the Altar is an ^^cident without a substance. But
Christ and his Apostles do teach manifestly y^ the sacrament of the Altar is
bread, and the body of Christ together, after y^ manner y^ he spoke. And in y^
he calls it bread, he would have ye people to understand as they ought with
reason, that it is very and substanciall bread, and no false nor fained bread.
In the b. of Mar. fol. 649.

Of the sacramental change.
Of the sacramental change. Sacramental change
S. Bid, which was about 900. years ago says thus: The creature of the bread
and wine, by the ineffable sanctification of the spirit, is turned into the
sacrament of Christ's flesh and blood.

In sacraments (says S. Augustine) Augustine
we must consider, not what they be of themselves, but what they do signify.

S. Ambrose Ambrose.
says, What saw thou in thy Baptime, water no doubt, but not only water.
Again he says, Before the blessing of the heavenly words, it is called
another kind: but after the consecration, the body of Christ is signified.

Of the sacramental word.
Let the word (says S. Austen) be added to the element, and there shall be
made a Sacrament. Sacramental word
For whence comes this so great strength to the water, to touch the body and
wash ye soul, but by the word making it: not because it is spoken, but because
it is believed. For in the very word it self, the sound which passes is one
thing, and the power which abides is another. This is the word of faith which
we preach says the Apostle: whereupon in the Acts of the Apostles it is said,
By faith cleansing their hearts, etc. Call. in his Inst. 4. b. chap. 14. sect. 4.

How in the sacrament remains bread and wine.
That which you see (says S. Austen) Augustine
in ye altar is ye bread and the cup, which also your eyes do show you, but
faith the weth you further ye bread is ye body of Christ, and the cup his
blood. Here he declares two things: y^ in the sacrament remains bread and
wine, which we may discern with our eyes: and that the bread and wine be
called the body and blood of Christ.

He that called his natural body (says Theodoretus) Theodor. (...) Dialo.
wheat and bread, and also called himself a Uine, the self same called bread
and wine his body and blood, and yet changed not their nature. And in his
Dialogue he says more plainly, for (says he) as the bread and wine after the
consecration, lost not their proper nature, but kept their former substance,
form and figure which they had before, even so the body of Christ after his
Ascension was changed into the godly substance.

Of the sacramental eating.
Look. Eating.

What is to be wondered at in the sacraments.
The wonder Wonder.
is not how God works in the outward visible sacrament, but his marvelous
work, is in the worthy receivers of the sacraments. The wonderful work of God
is not in the water, which only washes the body, but God by his omnipotent
power works wonderfully in the receivers thereof, scouring, washing, and
making them clean inwardly, and as it were new men, and celestial creatures.
This have all old Authors wondered at, this wonder passes the capacity of all
men's wits, how damnation is turned into salvation, and of the son of the
Devil condemned into hell, is made the son of God, an inheritour of heaven.
This wonderful work of God, all men may marvel and wonder at: but no
creature is able sufficiently to comprehend it. And as this is wondered at in
the sacrament of Baptime, how he that was subject to death, receives life by
Christ and his holy spirit: so is this wondered at in the sacrament of Christ's
holy Table, how the same life is continued and endured for ever, by continual
feeding of Christ's flesh and his blood. And these wonderful works of God
toward us, we be taught by Gods ho^y word and his sacraments of bread, wine and
water, and yet be not these wonderful works of God in the Sacraments, but in
us. Cranmer. fol. 74.

How the sacrament may be poisoned.
Pope Victor the third was poisoned in the Sacrament. The Emperor Henry the
seventh was poisoned Poison.
by a Dominike Friar, named Barnardmus de monte policiano, in receiving the
sacrament, and yet may it be none other substance, but the body and blood of
our Savior Christ God and man, where if he had been man, they had poisoned him
first, but if he had been God, he would first have espied their poison,
because he cannot be deceived. And because he cannot deceive, he would not
have poisoned the Emperor who mistrusted nothing. A. G.

How the Sacrament was cast into the fire, and burnt.
This wicked Pope Heldibrand, The Sacrament burnt.
sought by all means how he might destroy Henry the Emperor, and on a time
demanded of the Sacrament of Christ's body (as the Heathen use to do of their
Idols) what success he should have against him.

And because the sacrament spoke not, and gave him no answer, he threw it
into the fire, maugrie all the Eardinalls that were about him, and said to the
sacrament most blasphemously: Could the Idol gods of y^ Heathen give the^
answer of their success, and can not thou tell me?

How there is but two sacraments.
Look. Two.

When the sacrament was forbidden to be ministered in both kinds.
The sacrament was forbidden to be given in both y^ forms unto lay men in the
general Council at Constaunce, which was in the year of our Lord. 1415.
Sacrament fordiden the lay sort.
The words of the Council: Although Christ after supper ordained this
worshipful Sacrament, and gave it under both the forms of bread and wine to
his Disciples, yet that notwithstanding, the authority of the holy Canous, and
the laudable and approved custom of ye Church, has ord^ined, that the lay
men, should not receive it.

Sacraments of the Elders compared to ours.
Chrysostom brings a very apt similitude, in his Homely which he made upon
these words of Paul, Our Fathers were baptized into Moses. And in his vii.
Homely upon the Epistle to the Hebrews. Paint^rs (says he) when they intend to
(...) a King, first draw out the proportion upon a table with shadows and dark
colors, Sacraments of the elders
but yet in such sort, that a man may by that deliniation, although it be some
what obscure, easily perceive that the Image of a King is there painted, and
harsemen and Chariots, and such other like things, which things are not yet
straight way known of all men. But afterward when the Painter has laid on
fresh colors, and has finished the work, those things which before by those
first lines appeared scarce begone and rude, are now manifestly and opresly
perceived. Such (says he) were the sacraments of the Elders, if they be
compared with ours. By these words it is manifest, that Chrysostom was of y^
op^nion, that one and the self same thing is represented in our sacraments,
and in the sacraments of Elders: although in theirs more obscurely, and in ours
more manifestly. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 82.

SACRIFICE.
What a Sacrifice is.
A Sacrifice is a voluntary action, wherein we worship God, and offer unto him
somewhat, whereby we testify his chief dignity and dominion, and our
servitude and submission toward him. Pet. Mart. upon the Roman^s. fol. 411.

Again, A sacrifice (says he) is a voluntary and a religious action,
instituted of God, to offer unto him our things unto his glory, and that
thereby we may with a straighter ^and be coupled unto him in holy society. To
this definition of sacrifices, must be added a perticipation. Certain
sacrifices are propiciatorie, One sacrifice propiciatorie.
and other of thanks giving. By the first kind, God is made merciful unto
us, by the power and just merit thereof, but of this sort we have but only
one, forasmuch as only by the death of Christ, the eternal Father is
neconciled unto us, and by the merits of this one only Oblation, the sins
of the elect are forgiven, but in the other kind of sacrifice, we give
thanks unto God, we celebrate his name, and to our power, we obey his will.
Pet Mar. upon Iudic. fol 63.

Of two manner of sacrifices.
The sacrifice of reconciliation Sacrifice of reconciliation.
or redemption, is to deliver sinners from the wrath of God, which does only
pertain to our Savior Jesus Christ, whereof all the Leuiticall sacrifices
were but shadows and signs. The Sacrifice of praise or thanks giving, is all
the works of the faithful, wherewith they praise and laud God, and labor, to
be joined with him, etc. S. Austen himself does expound it. August. lib. 10.
de. ciuita. Dei. cap. 6. I. Veron.

One kind of sacrifice there is, which is called a propiciatory or merciful
sacrifice, that is to say, such a sacrifice as pacifieth Gods wrath and
indignation, and obtains mercy and forgiveness for all our sins, and is
the ransom of our redemption from everlasting damnation. And although in y^
old Testament there were certain sacrifices called by that name, yet in very
deed, there is but one such sacrifice, whereby our sins be pardoned, and
Gods mercy and favor obtained, (which is the death of the Son of God, our
Lord Jesus Christ) nor never was any other sacrifice propiciatory One
sacrifice propiciatorie.
at any time, nor never shall be. This is the honor and glory of this our
high Priest, wherein he admits neither partner nor successor. For by his
one obsation he satisfied his father for all men's sins, and recon^iled
mankind unto his grace and favor. And whosoever deprive him of this honor,
and go about to take it to themselves, they be very Antichrists, and most
arrogant (...)phemers against God, and against his Son Jesus Christ, whom
he has sent. Another sacrifice there is, which does not reconcile v^ unto
God, but is made of them that he reconciled unto Christ, to testify our duties
unto God, and to show our selves thank^ull unto him, and therefore they be
called Sacrifi^es of laudo, praise and thanks Sacrifice of laud, praise and
thanks.
giving. The first kind of sacrifice, Christ offered to God for us. The
second kind we our selves offer to God by Christ. And by the first kind of
sacrifice, Christ offered also us unto his Father, and by the seconds we offer
our selves, and all that we have, unto him and the Father. And this sacrifice
generally is our whole obedience unto God, in keeping his laws and
commandments, of which manner of sacrifice speaks the Prophet David,
saying: A sacrifice to God, is a contrite heart. And S. Peter says of all
Christian people, that they be an holy Priesthood, Psa. 11. 17.
to offer spiritual sacrifices^ acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. 1. pet. 2.
5.
And Saint Paul says, that always we offer unto God a sacrifice of laud and
praise by Jesus Christ. Heb. 13. 15.
Cranmer.

How the Priests cannot offer up Christ in sacrifice.
No man (says S. Paul) can offer up a greater sacrifice then himself. The
Priests therefore cannot offer up Christ in sacrifice, because Christ being
offered up, must needs be the greatest sacrifice, and so can he not be when a
Priest sacrifices him self, for if the Priest sacrificed himself, he should
be y^ greatest sacrifice y^ he could offer, for no man can offer a greater
sacrifice the^ himself: yea god requires none other sacrifice but our selves,
as writes S. Paul: Give your selves a living sacrifice to God. And the
Psalmist: The sacrifice that God accepts is a penitent spirit, a contrite and
an humble heart. Whereby it is manifest, Psa. 51. 17
that the Congeegation redeemed by the sacrifice offered on the Cross, does
not, nor cannot offer by the sacrifice of Christ's body, for (as S. Paul
writes) he cannot be offered up but be dies. Heb. 9. 28
Wherefore he offered up himself once for all, because he could not dye but
once, etc. Crowley.

How it is to offer our bodies a quick sacrifice.
Make your bodies a quick sacrifice. Romans 12. 1
The sacrifices of the new Testament are spiritual. This is a sacrifice most
acceptable unto God, if we mortify our mortal bodies, that is to say, if we
kill and ^lay our fleshly concupiscenc^s and carnal lusts, and so bring our
flesh, through the help of the spirit, under the obedience of Gods holy law.
Sir. I. Cheek.

The Jews in Moses law were commanded to offer up the carkases of beasts, but
Christians should exhibit their own lively bodies, for a sacrifice to God in
mortifieng their carnal lusts, and seaming themselves by faith, to godliness
and charity. The Bible note.

In steed of dead beasts, lively sacrifice. In steed of the blood of beasts
which was but a shadow and pleased, not God of it self, the acceptable
sacrifice of the spiritual man, framed by faith, to godliness and charity.

The first is, the sacrifice of praise and thanks giving, which S. Paul does

as the Prophet Ose says, Ose. 6. 6.
I will have mercy and not sacrifice. Read the. 25. Chap. of Matthew. The third
is when we offer our bodies a lively and an acceptable sacrifice to God,
mortifieng our carnal and fleshly concupiscences. Romans 12. 1. Sir. I. Cheek.

as well for the dead as for the quick, and therefore the very deed it self
justifies and puts away sin: I answer, that a sacrifice is the slaieng
of the body of a beast or a man: wherefore if it be a sacrifice, then is Christ's
body there slain and his blood there shed, but that is not so. And therefore it
is properly no sacrifice but a sacrament, and a memorial of that everlasting
sacrifice once for all, which he offered upon y^ cross, now a. 15. hundred
years ago, and preaches only to them that are alive, etc. Tindale.

The sacrifice of the old law, what it meant.
Although in the old Testament, there were certain sacrifices, Sacrifice of

called sacrifices for sin, yet they were no such sacrifices that could take
away our sins in the sight of God, but they were ceremonies ordained to this
intent, that they should be as it were shadows and figures, to signify before
hand, the excellent sacrifice of Christ that was to come, which should be
the very true and perfect Sacrifice, for the sins of the whole world. Cranmer.

SACRILEGE.
What Sacrilege is.
Sacrilege is rashly to touch or to usurp unto himself holy things, which
are dedicated unto God, due either by the name of a vow or else of a curse.
The Jews had a Commandment given them, that they should not spare Idols:
for their duty was to overthrow and destroy all things pertaining unto them.
But they being led by covetousness, reserved those things unto themselves, and
turned them to their own proper commodities. So sinned Achan and also Saul,
when he had overcome Amalech. Contrariwise, Moses gave an excellent example of
virtue, Exo. 32. 20
when he not only brake the golden Calfe, but also did beat it into powder,
and threw it into the river. For if the relics of the Idol had remained
still, peradventure the Israelites, as they were outrageous, would have
worshipped them. Indeed the Publike-wealth and our Magistrates may take away
those things which are superstitious, and convert the prices of them to good
and godly uses. But this thing is not permitted to private men. But the Jews
were generally forbid, that they should not save such things, especially as
were vowed by a curse. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 46.

SADVCES.
What the Saduces were.
THe Saduces were such men, as cloked their religion under a glorious name: for
Saducei is as much to say as just or holy. They taught y^ there was neither
Angel, spirit nor life after death: that God gave the law only for this, that
honestly and quietly we should live, receiving of God here in this life, the
reward of Justice. They interpreted the Scriptures according to the judgment
of man's reason: neither any other thing would they hear. And as concerning
that which pertained to the manner of their living, they were plain Epicures.
A wonderful thing to be heard, y^ such Ethnike opinions should creep in,
among the peculiar people of God, and that so far, that openly they were not
afraid to teach, and constantly to affirm, that after this life, there
remained none other life.

The Saduces calling themselves after the Etimologie of their name, just men,
affirmed as Josephus writes ( lib. 2. bell. Iud. cap. 7.) that man had
free will, that it lay in man to do good or bad. Mat. 22. and Luke. Act. 23.
say: that they deny the resurrertion, affirming there was neither Angel nor
spirit. Eusebius. 13.

SAGAION.
What it signifies.
SAgaion, as some will signifies an exercise, Psalm. 7.
that is, a painful and heavy temptation of Dauid^. Other interpret it an
ignorance, because he knew not the fault that was laid unto him. Some say it
was one of the instruments, where with all the Psalms before which it is set,
were sung. Some think that it is a certain kind of melody. T. M.

The Hebrew Interpreters agree not among themselves upon this word Sigaion.
For some take it for an instrument of Music. Unto some it seems to be a
note to sing a song by Other some think it, to be the beginning of some common
carol, according to the time, whereof David's will was to have this Palm sung.
And other interpret the Hebrew word to signify delightfulnes. In my judgment
(says Calvin) y^ second opinion is most allowable, namely y^ it was some kind
of tune or song: as if a man would term it a Saphicke or Phalentian verse.
Howbeit I force not a matter of so light importance. Call. upon the Psalm.

SAINTS.
How Saints are not to be prayed unto, nor worshipped.
THe very Saints themselves, whether they he dead men or Angels, Augustine
will not have honor given unto them, which only is due unto God. This appeared
in Paule^ and Barnabas, when the men of Licaonia a^^onied at their miracle,
would have done sacrifice unto them, as if they had been Gods: for they renting
their garments confessing and persuading them that they were not Gods, forbad
such things to be done unto them. This appears also in the Angels, as we
read in the Apocalips. The Angel forbidding himself to be worshipped, and
saying to him that worshipped him: I am the fellow^ servant of thee and thy
brethren. August. in his. 2. boo. and 21. chap. against Faustus. I. Gough.

But neither Helias is to be worshipped, Epiphan.
although he be yet alive: nor yet is John to be worshipped, although by his
own prayers, he made his sleep wonderful: nay, rather he received grace from
God. But neither Thecla nor any Saint is worshipped. For y^ old error shall
not rule in us, that we should forsake the living God, and worship those things
that were made by him. For they honored and worshipped the creature besides the
creater and they were made fools. For if he will not have the Angels to be
worshipped, how much more y^ which was borne of Anna, which by Ioachi^ being
given to Anna, which by prayer and all diligence was given according to promise
to the father and mother, notwithstanding was not ^orne otherwise, beside the
nature of man, but like as all men of the seed of y^ woman, and of the womb
of the woman. Epiph. in his book. cont. haeres. li. 3. to. 2. haeres. 29.

Let us not count it religion to worship the works of men's hands. Augustine.
For the crafts masters themselves which made such things are better, whom
notwithstanding we ought not to worship. Let us not make it religion to worship
brute beasts, for the basest sort of men y^ be he better the^ they who^
notw^sta^ding we ought not to worship. Let us not make it religion to worship
dead men, because they have lived godly, they are not counted that they seek
such honor, but they would have him to be worshipped of us, who allumining them
do rejoice. August. in li. de vera religi. chap. 55. I. Gough.

As for the holy Martirs, Cyril.
we neither say that they are Gods, neither have we accustomed to worship
them, but we praise them rather with great honor, because they have valia^tly
striuen for the truth, and have maintained the sincerity of faith, insomuch as
they have despised their own life, and not regarded the terrors of death,
have prevailed in very great dangers, and were of so great strength as though
they would raise up Images to themselves of their own life, etc. Cyril in his
6. book contra Julian.

To praise God in his Saints, what it means.
If the Papist will have this place: Praise the Lord in his Saints, to be like
unto this: Call upon the Saints of the Lord: Then by as good a reason we may
say, that the Trumpet, the Uioll, and the Harp, etc. ought to be called upon.
For it follows immediately after: Praise him in the sound of the trumpet, in
the violl, and in the harp: but the Catholic verity and truth, does both
read and understand the words of the Prophet after this sort: Praise the Lord
in his Sanctuary, Praise god in his Sanctuary
or in his holiness: that is, praise him that dwells in heaven: for in
another place he says, Lift up your hands unto the Sanctuary, and praise the
Lord, which is as much as if he should have said: Lift up your hands unto
heaven and praise the Lord, and give him thanks for his benefits. Whereunto he
adds with what instruments they were wont to stir up the hearts of the people
to sing praises, and to be thankful unto the Lord. But now under Christ,
such ceremonies of the old law are clean abolished.

How the dead Saints know nothing what is done in earth.
S. Austen in his book De cura pro mortuis agenda, does plainly affirm, y^
the souls of y^ Saints that be in heaven, do not know what the living do
here in earth, proving it by example of his own Mother, and by this place of
Esaias: Thou art our Father. Dead Saints know nothing.
Abraham knows us not, neither is Israel acquainted with us. And also by
Josias, where God promised that he should dye, and not see those calamities,
plagues and miseries, which he threatened should come upon that place, and upon
the people.

How Saints cannot impart their righteousness to other.
S. Hierome says, the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the
wickedness of ye wicked shall remain upon him, every man shall die through his
own sin, and every man shall live through his own righteousness. The Jews do
say in vain, Abraham is our Father, since that they have not the works of
Abraham. If we should put our trust in any, let us put our trust in God, Cursed
be every man that puts his trust in men, although they be Saints, although
they be Prophets.

We read, Put not your trust in men. Again: Better it is to trust in God
then in Princes, not only in the Princes of the world, but in the Princes of
the Church, which if they be righteous, they shall deliver their own souls
only.

Certain Objections, Answered.
Saints do pray for us says the Papists, ^. objection
which they prove by the place of David. Psa. 32. 5. I will confess my sin
unto the Lord, and so ^hou forgauest the wickedness of my sin: for this
shall every Saint make his prayer in a time when thou may be found.

Answer.
When David had reasoned of the remission of sins, and had appointed
himself an example to other, and had said, I have confessed my sin unto
thee Lord and thou have forgiven the wickedness of my sin, he did add by
and by: Many holy and godly men shall be provoked by this example of mine to
call after the same sort upon GOD, when god may be found.
for the pardon and forgiveness of their sins, in a time when thou may be
found. For after that we be departed hence (says Saint Cipriane) Cipriane.
there is no place of repentance, no effect of salvation, here the life is
either lost or holden: here by the worshipping of God and the fruit of says,
everlasting salvation is provided for^. By these words of Ciprian^ we do
know that as long as we be in this life, we may through faith in our
Savior Jesus Christ, pray unto GOD for the remission of our sins, and that
so long God may be found: but after that we be once gone, neither repentance,
nor yet praieng unto God for the remission of our sins can profit us nothing.

Objection.
The Saint was great with God when he was alive, ^. obiecti^
as it appeared by the miracles which God showed for him, he must therefore be
great now say they.

Answer.
This reason appears wisdom, but it is very fool^shnesse with God, Great
with God
for the miracle was not showed that thou should put thy trust in the Saint,
but in the word of the Saint preached, which word if thou beleeuest would save
thee, as God has promised, and would also make thee great with God as he did
the Saint.

Objection.
If a man have a matter with a great man or a king, 3. objection
he must go first to one of his mean servants, and then higher and higher
till he come to the king.

Answer.
This entising argument, is but a blind reason and man's wit. It is not like in
the kingdom of the world, as it is in the kingdom of God and Christ. With
kings for the most part we have no acquaintance nor promise. They be also
most commonly merciless. Moreover if they promise, they are yet men and
unconstant as are other people and as untrue. But with God if we have belief
we are accounted, and have an open way unto him, by the door Christ, which is
never shut, but through unbelief, neither is there any porter to keep any man
out. By him says Paul. Ephe. 2. 18. That is to say, by Christ we have an
open way into the Father, so are ye now no more strangers and forriners (says
he) but citizens with the Saints, and of the household of God. God had also
made us promises, and has sworn, yea, has made a testament or a covenant,
and has bound himself, and has sealed his Obligation with Christ's blood, and
confirmed it with miracles. He is also merciful and kind, and complains
that we will not come to him: He is mighty and able to perform that he
promises: He is true and cannot be but true, as he cannot be but GOD,
therefore it is not like with the king and God.

Objection.
We be sinners say they, 4 objection
God will not hear us.

Answer.
Behold how they fly from God, as from a tyrant merciless whom a man
counts most merciful to him, he soonest flies. But these techers dare not
come to God, why? For they are the children of Cain. If the Saints love who^
God hates, then God and his Saints are divided. When thou praiest to the
Saints, how do they know, except God whom thou countest merciless tell them?
If God be so cruel and so hates thee, it is not lykely that he will tell the
Saints that thou praiest unto them, etc.

Objection.
Saints must pray for us, and be mediators to God for us, ^. objection
that by them we may receive our petition. This is Richards opinion De media
villa.

Answer.
This is a great blasphemy to Christ's blessed blood, for if Saints be
necessary to be mediators for us, then is Christ insufficient. For
Philosophers did never put two causes where one was sufficient. And if any thing
be given us for Saints sakes, the^ be not al things given us for Christ's sake.
The which is plainly against Saint Paul's saying, Romans 8. 33. God for us all
has given his son, and shall he not give us all things with him? D. Barnes.

Paul says, there is but one mediator between God and man, 8. Tim. 2. 5.
the man Christ Jesus, the which has given himself for the redemption of all
men. Here he says, there is but one mediator between God and man. Where
there is but one, there cannot Saints come in. Moreover Saints be men, Ergo
they must have a mediator for themselves, and than they cannot be mediators
for other men. Moreover the mediator between God and man is called Christ
Jesus. Now is there no Saint that has that name. If there be none, then is
there none that can usurp this office without blaspheming of Christ.
Furthermore, he has redeemed us without the help of Saints, and why shall he
not be wholly mediator without Saints. Redemption is the chief act of a
mediator. D. Barnes.

Saint John says, if a man do sin, we have an advocate by the father,
Christ Jesus. Here is none assigned but Christ Jesus, and by him have we only
remission of our sins.

Look. Advocate. D. Barnes.

Saint Paul says: Romans 8. 26
The spirit of God makes intercession mightily for us with mighty desires
that cannot be expressed with tongue. If the spirit of God do make
intercession for us, then have we no need of other mediators. For he is able
to obtain all things for us, and has taken this office on him for us. It were
a great rebuke to him that Saints should be set in his steed, and joined with
him in office, as though he were insufficient. D. Barnes.

Paul sayth^ Christ si^teth on the right hand of the father, the which does
also pray for us. Romans 8. 34
He says that Christ prays for us: can the Father of heaven deny any thing
of his prayer? Does he not ask all things necessary for us? And as Scripture
says, he is our wisdom, 1. Cor. 1. 30
he is our justice, he is our sanctification, and our repemption made of God^
Now what rests for Saints to aske^ Now what will ye desire more then wis^ome,
justice, sanctification and redemption. All these hath^ Christ obtained for us.
D. Barnes.

Christ says: John. 14. 6.
No man comes to the father but by me. Note these words: First he says. No
man, etc. Ergo as many as ever shall come to the father of heaven be here
contained. Then adds he: But by me. Here be all Saints and merits clean
excluded in this word (But:) Wherefore it is plain that whatsoever he be that
makes any other mediator, or goes about by any means seem it never so
holy, but by Christ, he despises also the father which has allowed him only
to be our mediator and way to him, as it is written, I am the way only to
the Father. D. Barnes.

Whatsoever ye ask in my name, the Father shall give it you. John. 16. 21
Mark these words, Whatsoever, and that we should run to none other, he
adds also, in my name. Here is nothing excluded, but all things be given us
freely, and that for his names sake, not for any Saints name, nor for none of
our merits, therefore let us not run from the sweet promises of our most
loving Savior, redeemer, and only mediatour^ Jesus Christ, to Saints. For
that is an evident token of our infidelity, and that we think him untrue, and
will not fulfill his promise, and make him a liar. D. B.

S. James James. 1. 17
says: All good gifts comes from the Father of ligh^. Here they have
destinction, ye God is good only of his own nature: and Saints are good by
receiving goodness of him. Answer. Saints have no more goodness then they have
received, and that y^ they received was for themselves only, and can give none
of it to other, for they received it for themselves, and no more then was
necessary, and that but only of mercy: As it is open in Matthew in y^ parable
of y^: 5. wise virgins, and the. 5. foolish. Thus we do openly against God,
when we desire any thing of Saints, seeing ye scripture knowledgeth all good
things to come of God only, and ye he is the only giver of them. All ye
Prophets^ and fathers, in all their tribulations cried alonely on him, as David
testifies of himself in these words following, When I am in trouble, I cry
unto ye Lord, Psa. 120. 1
and he will help me, etc. Here he did not doubt for all that he was a sinner,
and also in this place following: My help is of God that made heaven and
earth, etc. Also Christ himself teaching us to pray, bids us not to go to
any other thing, but alonely to the Father of heaven.

Wherefore Saints deeds do serve.
All the Saints deeds pertains to the glorifieng of God: And not to this end,
Saints deeds.
that we should put our hope and trust in them and their help. D. Heyn^s.

How Saints have not merits sufficient for themselves. Objection.
I remembor (says Friar Brusiard Friar Brusiard.
to Bilney) in a certain sermon of years, you said that no Saint, though his
suffering were never so great, and his life most pure, de^erued any thing for
us with God, either by his death or life, which is contrary to S. Austen.

Answer.
Christ says one thing, S. Austen an other: whether of these two should we
believe? For Christ willing to deliver us out of this dark ^^eon of ignorance,
gave forth a certain parable of ^ virgins, Saints have not merits sufficient
for the^elues
of which ^iue were fools, and five were wise. ^By the five faolish virgins
wanting the oil of good works, he meant us all sinners, by the wise virgins he
meant the company of all holy Saints. How let us heard what the five wise
virgins said to the foolish, craving Oil of them: No said they, least
peraduen^ure we have not sufficient for us and for you. Get you rather to them
that sell, and buy of them to serve your turn. Wherefore if they had not oil
sufficient for themselves, and also for ye other, where be then the merits of
Saints, wherewith they can deserve both for themselves and for us? Eeries I
cannot see. Bilney in the book of Mar. fo. 11^40.

How the faithful living on earth are Saints.
To prove that the faithful living yet here in earth be called Saints, Act.
9. 1^.
hear the words of Anani^s in the Acts of the Apostles: Lord (says he) I
have heard by many of this man, how much harm he has done to thy Saints at
Jerusalem, and how he has power of the high Priests, to bind all those that
call upon thy name. Now hear what S. Austen says concerning this matter. He
writing upon the Psalms do allege these words of the Apostle: And some of
you were such, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified. Si ergo eos
sanctificauit, dicit, etc. If he call them sanctified, let every one of the
faithful say, I am a Saint. This is not the pride of him y^ is puffed up, but
y^ confessio of him y^ is ingrate or unthankful, for if thou say thou art a
Saint of thy self, thou art a proud man. Again, being faithful in Christ,
Wherefore the faithful are Saints.
if thou say thou art not a Saint, thou art ingrate and unthankful. Say unto
thy God, I am a Saint because thou have sanctified me, because I have received
it not because I had it: because thou have given it, not because I deserved it.
For on y^ other side thou beginnest to do injury unto thy Lord Jesus Christ.
For if all christians and faithful, and all they y^ be baptized in him, or
are apparelled with him, as ye Apostle says: As many as are baptized in Christ,
are apparelled with him. If they be made members of his body, and say y^ they are
not Saints, they do injury unto ye head himself, whose members are not holy.
Now see where thou art, and take dignity of thy head, let every christen man
say: yea, let the whole body of Christ cry out whensoever it suffers
afflictions, diverse temptations, and innumerable slanders, preserve my soul
for I am a Saint. Ric. Turn. To al you of Rome beloved of god and saints by
calling. ^Saints by calling is as much to say, Romans 1. 7^
as called to be saints, called to holiness and holy things. For the Scripture
is accustomed to call them that be alive, Saints: And it ought to be all one to
say: S Saint or a christen man, or a christian. Tindale.

How Saints shall judge the world.
They shall judge (says Chrysostom) not they themselves sitting in judgment
and exacting an account, God forbid: But they shall condemn the world, the
which signifieng, he says: And if in you, etc. He says not of you, but in
you, as who should say the just condempnation of those that are the worldlinges
shall shine in the salvation of you that are in his Saints. I. Bridges.

SALOMONS HOUSE.
Of the beauty thereof, and whereunto it is applied.
SAint Hierome and other learned interpreters in reading and pointing, Psalm.
49.^
do swerve quite and clean from our Latin Bibles, reading this clause of
commending of Salomons goodly house on this wise. Epalatijs eburneis vt te
exhilerent^ and yet here is still Eclipsis, which may be thus made up, Supplia
vestimenta deprompta e palatijs eburneis vt te exhileret. Out of the Iuory
pallaices, and not Iuory places, but out of Iuory palaces are thy sweet
garments brought out to make thee mer^ie and joyful: for that is one of the
properties of sweet odours, to make the spirits of a man merry and cheerful.

Thus then does the Prophet commend Solomon the figure of Christ. He says that
Solomon had not only a princely store of sw^^t^ and goodly garments, smelling
of Mirre, Aloes, and Eassia, but also they were said up in pallaices of Iuorie.
Of Salamons most princely house the Scripture makes mention. 3. Reg. 7. Where
it is said that Salomons house was a building. xi^. years. There was none
other timber occupied in ye making of the roof and certain other parts, but
only Cedar, which wood is costly and hard to be gotten. The walls were in many
places set with precious stones, and the pillars of Ceder plated over with
gold. This was a sumptuous house. But yet we read not that Salomons pallaice
was made of Iuorie: No, of Iuorie there is no mention, and no marvel, for
Iuorie is only the bone of an Elephants tooth. So that it is not lykely, that
such plenty of Elephants teeth could be gathered or gotten, that should make
or cover Salomons pallaice that was so great and so large that it was xiii.
years a building, wherefore by these words: Domus eburnea, Iuorie pallaices,
What is understood by Iuory pallaices.
we must understand nothing else, but most goodly and sumptuous houses, so
pleasant and so beautiful, as if they had been made of white Iuorie, and of the
shining teeth of Elephants. Thus then has ye prophet in this dark place (E
domibus eburncis.) And if ye will apply these words unto Christ, then ye must
allegorically understand by ye Iuory houses, the white and the pure hearts of
the elect Saints and servants of God, wherein through the sanctifieng of the
holy Ghost, Christ dwells more princely then ever Solomon did, in any of his
gorgeous houses.

Of Salomons Temple.
Which had seen the first house, etc. Wept with a loud voice. Because they
saw that it was nothing so glorious as that Temple which Solomon had built, 1.
Es. 3 12.
notwithstanding Aggeus comfort them and prophesies that it shall be more
beautiful then the first. Agge^ 2. meaning because Christ and his Apostles
should preach the Gospel and work miracles therein. The Bible note.

The note in the Bible of Geneua, has thus in the end: meaning the spiritual
Temple, which are the members of Christ's body.

What Salomons porch means.
In Salomons porch. The Evangelist calls Salomons porch the Temple: not
because it was the Sanctuary, but a part of the same. Therefore this place in
the which Christ walked belonged not to the Scribes and Pharesies, but to the
common sort of people. For it is certain ye this porch of the which mention is
made here, was not ye same which is described in y^ book of Kings (for that
was taken away by the Chaldees and quite ouerthrown) but the same which the
Jews straight after their return from their exile into Babylon builded
according to the pattern of the old. Marl. upon John. fo. 391.

Which was builded again, after the pattern of that which Solomon builded.
Geneua.

SALT.
What it is to salt.
THE office of an Apostle and true preacher of Christ is to salt, not only the
corrupt manners and conuersations of earthly people, but also the rotten heart
within, and all that springs out thereof, To Salt. what it is
their natural reason, their will, their understanding and wisdom, yea, and
their faith and belief, and all that they have imagined without Gods word,
concerning righteousness, invocation, satisfaction, and serving God, etc.
Tindale. fol. 196.

Who is meet to Salt.
The true preaching is a salting that stirs up persecution, and an office
that no man is meet Meet Salters.
for, save he that is seasoned himself before with poverty in spirit,
softness, meekness, patience, mercifulness, pureness of heart, and hunger
for righteousness, and looking for persecution to, and has al his comfort and
hope, in the blessing only, and in no worldly thing. Tindale. fol. 196.

Of the salting of hypocrites.
The nature of Salt is to bite, fret and make smart, and though the sick
patients of the world can suffer their gross sins to be rebuked under a
fashion, Salting of hypocrites
as in a Parable a far of, yet to have their righteousness, their holiness,
and serving of God and his Saints, disallowed, improued, and condemned for
dampnable and devilish, that may they not abide. Tindale. fo. 196.

Of salt that has lost his saltness.
If Salt have lost his saltness, Mat. 5. 13.
it is good for nothing but to be trodden under foot of men. That is, if the
preacher which for his doctrine is called Salt, True salting lost.
have lost his nature of Salt, ye is to say, his sharpness in rebuking all
unrighteousness, all natural reason, natural will and understanding, and all
trust and confidence in whatsoever it be, save in the blood of Christ, he is
condemned of God, and disallowed of all them that cleave to the truth, etc.
Tindale. fol. 197.

Ye are the Salt of the earth, etc. The ministers of Gods word are called the
Salt of the earth, because ye men are made by their true doctrine (being
received through faith) sauory unto the Lord. And the Salt has lost his
saltness, when the ministers fall from Gods word, unto the dreams and
traditions of Antichrist. Beza.

How our speech ought to be poudred with salt.
Let your speech be gracious always, ^^ll. 4. 6
and poudred with salt. Here we have a goodly lesson how that our
communication ought to be tempered with godly wisdom, which he understands
by Salt (for as Salt makes meats sauorie, Speech poudered with Salt.
so godly wisdom causes our communication and talk to be allowable and have
a grace) we ought to take heed with whom, and before whom we do talk, and
according to the audience to moderate and rule our communication. Sir. I.
Cheek.

Let your speech be always gracious, etc. Perteining to edification, and mixed
with no vanity. Geneua.

How the nature of Christ is set out by the ceremony of salt.
Upon all thine offering thou shall bring Salt. By this ceremony is the nature
of Christ set forth, Leui. 2. 13
which is figured in all sacrifices. For Christ is the true and heavenly Salt,
Christ is the true Salt.
by who^ all that believe in him be made sauorie and pleasant unto God the
father, so that they shall never so putrify, that they shall Perish. The Bible
note.

How salt in Baptime is not Christ's ordinance.
The use of Salt in the old Testament was appointed to the Jews by the law
prescribed by Moses to them that were under the law. Salt in Baptime.
If it had been Christ's pleasure y^ his ministers should have looked back unto
the rites of Moses, and taken out of them such as they listed, he would rather
have had declared the same, or else the Apostle would have done it, wherefore our
opinion is (says Mus^ulus) that this use of Salt also in Baptime, is to be
attributed unto y^ will worship of the Bishops. Mus. fo. 290

Of the salted covenant.
Let it be a salted covenant Nu. 18. 19 Salted covenant.
for ever. Like as Salt does preserve flesh from corruption, so this covenant
should be sure, stable, and incorruptible. The Bible note.

Neither shall thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking.
Leu^^. 2. 13
All offerings must be salted with Salt, signifieng that al our works must be
directed after the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets, and then shall they
be acceptable in the sight of the Lord, if they savor of the Salt thereof, or
else not. T. M.

What the sowing of Salt means.
Destroyed the city and sowed Salt in the place. He sowed Salt there to make
it barren for ever: Iudic. 9. 4^
for Salt makes the ^round unapt to bring forth any thing, as says Pliny in
his^ 13. book the. 17. chapter.

Abimelech after he had destroyed the city of Sichem, sowe^ Salt therein,
which was a token of a wilderness and desert. For Salt dries the ground, and
makes it unfruitful. In Hebrew Malach signifies Salt. Thereof comes the
Uerbe Malach, which is to Salt, but in the Coni^gation Niphal Niuilah is a
Uerbe which signif^eth to destroy, to break down and to wast. That word
leremy used in his. 14. chapter. And David in his. 107. Psalm. God turns a
fruitful land into a sa^^ish ground, that is, makes it wast and desert. In
the year. 1165. Frederike Oenobarbus ye Emperor overthrew Millaine, and sowed
Salt there, For that city took part with Alexander the third being Pope,
against Caesar: which thing Frederike took in ill part. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic.
fol. 170.

SALVATION.
A firm Argument for the certeintie of our salvation.
ANd seeing it is said, that faith shall be imputed unto us unto
righteousness, as it was in times past imputed unto Abraham, we have a most
firm argument of the certeintie of salvation. For as Abraham behaved himself
toward the promise of God, as touching that he should have issue. Sure of our
salvation.
So must we behave our selves toward the promises of the remission of sins.
But he was certain, neither doubted he: whereof we ought to be certain of
the salvation promised unto us, and by no means to doubt thereof. This reason
let us hold fast, and not suffer it to slip from us. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans
fol. 96.

As the holy Scriptures teaches us, we ought to hope, and such is the nature
of hope not to confound, we may manifestly infer, that we ought not to doubt of
our salvation. There are which pretend, ye their doubt hereof springs, for
y^ they are uncertain whether they shall persevere unto y^ end or no. But these
me^ should consider, y^ we ought alwais to pray for perseuera^ce. For as says
Cipriane, whom Augustine follows, in all ye things which we ask in the Lords
prayer, is included perseuera^ce. And as James teaches, we must ask without
doubting, wherefore it is manifest, y^ we must by no means doubt of
perseverance, and especially seeing we have in our hearts the holy Ghost,
always bearing an excellent testimony unto us thereof. For as Saint Paul
says in this Epistle: Romans 8. 16
It is the spirit that bears witness to our spirit that we are the sons of
God, and ^e which has not the spirit of Christ is none of his. And Paul
writes of himself, that he is sure, that neither life, nor death, nor
principality, nor power, can pluck him from y^ love of God, namely from ye
love, wherewith God loved him. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fo. 967.

How without the Church is no light or salvation.
S. Cipriane De simplicitate praelatorum says. Whosoever is separated from the
Church, is joined to an adulterous church, y^ same man is separated from ye
promises of ye church, neither pertains he to Christ's merits, which has left
y^ church of Christ. He is a stranger, he is unclean, he is an enemy. He
cannot now have God his father, who has not the church his mother. No
salvation out of the Church.
If he may escape that was out of the Ark of Noah, he may also escape that is
abroad out of the church. He must needs be a most wicked man, whosoever he be
that leaves his own country, and the fellowship of very good men, and falls
away to the enemies. Lactantius therefore most truly said: It is only the
catholic church, which receives true religion. Here is the fountain of
truth: This is the household of faith. This is y^ temple of God: into ye which
if one enter not, or out of ye which if any depart, he is excluded from the
hope of salvation and life everlasting: for our savior said, that out of the
sheepfolde, life is not to be sound. Bullinger. fo. 843.

The causes of our salvation.
The special cause why we obtain everlasting life, is y^ voluntary and free
will of God: And the second cause are y^ merits of Christ, for he died for the
salvation of mankind: but this is also a free gift of the good will of God.
The third cause is our faith, by the which we embrace and receive this good will
of God and the merits of Christ. Marl. upon Mat. fol. 373.

It is most true that the eternal election of God in Jesus Christ, is the
only and sole cause of salvation Cause of our salvation.
unto us miserable and mortal men: And holy faith embracing the mercy of God
in Jesus Christ, by the testimony of the holy Ghost in our hearts, is that
which does assure us that it is so. Moreover I say unto thee that if any man
should go about to take from thee this assurednes, and to make thee doubtful
of thy salvation, he goes about to make thee an Infidel, and not to believe
in Christ. Yea; he seeks (as much as lies him) to make God a liar, in whom,
and not in thee, is the certeintie of thy faith grounded. F. N. B. the Italian.

How our salvation is nearer now, then when we believed.
For now is our salvation nearer then when we believed. The farther we go, the
nearer are we to the end, Rom 13. ^1.
now therefore our perfect and full salvation, is nearer unto us, then when we
began first to believe. The Bible note.

Before we believed, it had been in vain to tell us these things. But now,
seeing our salvation is near, let us take heed that we neglect not this
occasion. Geneua.

To work out our salvation, what it means.
Work out your own salvation, Our health hangs not of our works, Phil. 2.
12.
and yet are they said to work out their health, who do run in the race of
justice: for although we be saved freely in Christ by faith, yet must we walk
by the way of justice unto our health. The Bible note.

Run forward in that race of righteousness, wherein God has freely placed
you through Jesus Christ, and conducteth you his children by his spirit to
walk in good works, and so make your vocation sure. Geneua.

SALVTE.
The meaning of these places following.
SAlute no man by the way. Luke 10. 14
This is spoken after the manner of a figure which men use, when they put down
more in words then is meant: usually among the Hebrews, when they command a
thing to be done speedely without delay. As Reg. 4. 29. For otherwise courteous
and gentle salutations are points of christen duty: as for this calling it
was but for a season. Beza.

He wills that they should dispatch this journey with diligence, not
occupieng themselves about other duties. Math. 10. 12. Mar. 6. 10. Geneua.

When Heliah sent Gehazi his servant to the Sunamite, Reg. 4. 29.
he charged him, saying: If thou meet any salute him not, and if any salute
thee answer him not, as though he should say: Make speed as nothing may let
thee by the way. Geneua.

SAMARITANES.
Of their opinions.
THE Samaritanes as Josephus. Heretik^s
Antiq. li. 11. cap. vlt. deny the Jews in adversity, in prosperity they
call them cosins, deriuing their pedigrees from Joseph, Ephraim, Manasses, etc.
They only receive the five books of Moses, denieng all the prophesies after
him. They retain all the Jewish ceremonies, except the abhorring of the
Gentiles. They deny moreover the resurrection of the dead. Epiphan. Praefae.
li. 1. de heraes.

SAMVEL.
How these words of Samuel in this place are to be understood.
HOw can this be true that Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with thee,
and yet he went with him. 1. Re. 15. 26
It is to be understood, that Samuel spoke it for the time present, and not
for the time following. As our Savior Christ in the 7. of John says: I will
not go up to the feast, and yet afterward he went privily. So Samuel intending
not at that time to return with Saul^^ but after his mind being changed, for
certain causes went with Saul. Ly^a.

Of the raising up of Samuel.
And Saul perceived that it was Samuel. 1. Reg. 2^. 14.
To his imagination, albeit it was Satan indeed, who to blind his eyes, took
upon him the form of Samuel, as he can do an Angel of light. Geneua.

SANCTA SANCTORVM.
What the meaning of these words are.
THis bread and this cup are the holy things of the holy. Intet dec. Bonisa. 1.
de^re 3.
You see that he says not only, they are holy things, but he adds beside,
of the holy. As if he would say: This bread is not common to all men, nor every
unworthy, but it is the bread of the holy. How much more may we say the same
of Gods word. This word is not of men, or of every body, but of the holy.
There S. Chrysostom says, that the Priest was wont to show forth the bread in
the time of the holy mysteries, and say, Sancta sanctis, holy things for the
holy. And this is the meaning of Sancta sanctorum.

SANCTIFY.
What it is to Sanctify.
Sanctify, to cleanse and purify, to appoint a thing to holy uses, and to
separate from unclean and ungodly uses. Tindale.

And for their sakes sanctify I my self. John. 17. 19
To sanctify, is to separate to divine uses: I sanctify my self, that is, I
dye for them, that they by my death may be filled with the spirit of
sanctification, and may be made the holy vessels of God by the revealed
spirit of the Gospel. Marl. upon John. fol. 568.

Sanctify them with thy truth. John. 17. 17
To sanctify is to select and choose out a thing from a profane use, to the
true worshipping of God, the faithful then are by the truth of Gods word
sanctified, that is to say, selected and chosen out from the stock of Adam,
being cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ, from the filthiness of this
world. Christ does sanctify himself, when he offers himself upon the
cross for us. Here we must note, that Christ does in this place pray as a
very natural man and not as God.

Blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it. Sanctify in this place, Genesis 2.
3.
is as much to say, as to dedicate and ordeine a thing to his own use. As Exo.
13. 2. Tindale.

The meaning of this place following.
For both he that sanctifies and they which are sanctified, are all one. Heb.
2. 11.
That is to say, as well Christ that does sanctify, as we that are sanctified
be all of one Father, which is Abraham, whose seed Christ took upon him, and
not Angels: that so by offering of his body and shedding of his blood, he might
sanctify us for ever. Sir. I. Cheek.

The head and the members are of one nature: So Christ which sanctifies us,
and we that are sanctified, are all one by the union of our flesh. Geneua.

How our meats are sanctified.
For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. 1. Tim. 4. 8
We confess and acknowledge that God is the maker and giver of these creatures
which we use. Secondly, that we are of y^ number of those, who through Christ's
benefits, have received that right over all creatures, that Adam lost by his
fall. Thirdly by our prayer, we crave of the Lord, that we may use those meats
with a good conscience, which we receive at his hands. Fourthly, we make an
end of our eating and drinking, with thanks giving and prayer, and so are our
meats sanctified unto us. Beza.

SANCTVARIE.
Of the prayers made in the Sanctuary.
MIttat tibi auxilium de sancto, and de Syon tueatur te. Psalm. 20. 20^
The Lord send thee help from the Sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Syon.
This is a prayer for the King, and the second verse of the. 20 Psalm. And
albeit the power of God is as ready, and as able to help us, calling unto him
in the broad fields or in the wild woods (with seruent faith) as if we make
our prayers in the Sanctuary, that is, the holy place of the Tabernacle, wherein
the Arc of covenant, the propiciatorie seat, and the golden Censures, were
kept, yet almighty God to preserve the people of Israel from worshipping of
hills and mountains, woods and groves, as the Heathen Idolaters did, he
commanded Moses to make him a Tabernacle, within the which Tabernacle the
chief part was called Sanctum sanctorum, the holy of the holiest, where God
promised favorably to hear the prayers of the people. And at such time as
this Psalm was made, this Sanctuary was placed by the Commandment of King
David, in the mount and high tower belonging to the City of Jerusalem called
Syon, and according to the same, he commanded now the people to pray in this
Psalm, made for the preservation of their King, and say: Mittet tibi auxilium,
etc. The Lord send unto thee help from the Sanctuary, and strengthen thee out
of Syon. That is, the Lord which has promised to hear your prayers out of his
Sanctuary, the holy of holiest, which is now placed in Mount Syon, O King, the
same Lord send thee help and defend thee. Turnar.

What it is to fear the Sanctuary.
And fear my Sanctuary. Leu. 19. 30
To fear the Sanctuary, is diligently to perform the true worshipping and
service of God, and leave of nothing, to observe and keep the pureness, both
of body and mind verily, and not Hypocrite like, to believe that he knows,
beholds, does and rules all things, to beware of offending him, and with
all fear and diligence to walk in the paths of his laws. T. M.

SAPPHIRE.
The nature of the Sapphire, and what is meant by it.
THe second a Sapphire. Apo. 21. 19
This stone is like ye clear sky, which being stricken with the Sun beams,
casts forth a burning brightness. And it betokens the highness of the hope
of holy men, whose conversation is in heaven. Phi. 3. 20. And who being renewed
by the true son, do the more earnestly seek everlasting things, and teach
other to do the same. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 299.

The second foundation was of a Saphyre, whose color is as the air, clear,
but not very precious in sight. This betokens those simple souls, which
though they were as Job and. Joseph the Carpenter, not precious to the world,
yet had they their daily conversation in heaven. Bale.

SAPIENCE.
A definition of this word Sapience.
SApience is defined to be the knowledge of things, pertaining to God and man,
and of things divine and worldly, which they that had gotten, were called
Sapientes, that is, men of perfect knowledge, virtue and honesty. For of right
knowledge consequently ensues honesty of life. Vdall.

SARDINE.
A description of this stone, and what it betokens.
THe sixth a Sardine. Apo. 21. 20
This stone is all of one color like blood, and it betokens the glory of
Martyrdom, after the suffering of the Martyrs themselves. Marl. upon the Apoc.
fol. 300.

The sixth a Sardine, which in similitude is very like unto red earth, and
such are they, as notwithstanding the great benefit of God, thinks
themselves the unworthy children of Adam, whose interpretation after Philo, is
red earth indeed. Mary, Christ's mother was of this sort, confessing her
self after most high benefits to be but an handmaid, and her spirit to
rejoice in God her Savior. So was Abraham, calling himself but dust and Ashes
before the Lord. Bale.

SARDIS.
What Sardis is.
CHurch which is at Sardis. Apoc. ^. ^
Sardis is the name of a most flourishing City, where ye kings of Lydia kept
their Courts. This Sardis which is as much to say as a prince of plesantnes, or
a song of mirth, or that which is the remnaunt or leaving of a thing, or in the
Syrian language, a Cauldron, was also another City, whose situation is
notwithstanding vnkn^wen. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 19.

SARDONIX.
The description of the Sardonix, and what it betokens.
THe. 5. a Sardonix. Apo. 21. 2^
A Sardonix is of diverse colors. Black in the bottom, white in the mids, and
red in the top. Even so the Saints are red through sufferaunce of adversities
and troubles, white by inward pureness of conscience, and black or despised
in themselves through lowliness. Marl. fol. 299.

The. 5. was a Sardonix, which is compounded of a Sardi^ and an Onix, and is
beneath black, in the middle white, and above red. Such were those meek
sprited, that confesses themselves sinners with David and Magdalene, being
through faith both pure and orient before God. Though I be black, says the
true Congregation, yet am I fair and well favored. We faint not (says Paul)
for though our outward man be corrupt, yet is he that is inward, daily renewed.
Bale.

SATAN.
How Satan is taken for an enemy and adversary.
SAtan does signify an enemy, an adversary, and a hurtful person, as David
said: 2. Reg. 19 22.
What matter is between you and me, for this day ye are become adversaries
unto me. The latin text has: Cur efficimini mihi hodie in Satan, Eue^ so to
Peter persuading Christ from the Cross, it was said: Come after me Satan, for
he was an adversary unto Christ, Mat. 16. 23
reuoking him from his Fathers commandment. Marl. fol. 38.

How Satan is called the Prince of this world.
S. Austen in his treatise upon John. 15. says: God forbid we should think
the Devil were so called the Prince of the world, that we should believe that
he is able to rule over Heaven and earth: but the world (for he is said to be
the Prince of this world) Prince of this world
is said to be in wicked men, which are dispearsed throughout the whole
compass of the earth. And again ye same Augustine in his 1. chap. De agone
christia. says: The Prince of this world is cast out, not that he is cast out
of the world, but out of their minds, which cleave unto the word of God, and
love not the world whereof he is Prince: because he has dominion over them,
which love temporal goods, which are contained in this visible world, not for
ye he is Lord of this world, but Prince of those concupiscences, whereby every
thing is coueted that is transitory. By this concupiscence the Devil reigns
in man, and holds his heart in possession. Bull^n. fol. 750.

Now shall the Prince of this world be cast out. Satan is called Prince of this
world, Ioh. 12. 31
not because he is the lawful Prince of the same, but by rapine, by which he
has made mankind^ subject unto him by sin. Other wise the earth is the
Lords, and all that therein is, the compass of the world, and they ye dwell
therein. The Apostle Paul calls him the God of this world, which works in
the children of unbelief, by whom they are held captive to his will and
pleasure, for his kingdom is in the hearts of the unbelievers: but by the
power of Christ he is cast out of the hearts of mortal men. And now we must
take heed, least he get entrance again into his old seat. Christ and the
Prince of this world cannot reign together. Christ being let in, expels
Satan, and Satan being received, Christ departs. For there is no agreement
between Christ and Behal. Marl. upon John. fol. 441.

How the standing of Satan among the Angels. is to be understood.
And Satan also came among them. (...). 1. 6.
It is not so to be understood, that Satan wound himself in, as though he had
been of the company and order of the Angels: but it is to show us, that he is
under Gods obeysaunce as well as the Angels, Satan among the Angel^^^
howbeit that it is in a far other quality. For the Holy ghost names him
adversary, whereas the Angels be called the children of God, to signify unto
us, that the Angels ^^e ^bey with their good will, and that they be willing
servants, whereas Satan is enforced, so as there is nothing but necessity and
constraint in him. Call. upon Job. fol. 16.

When the servant of God came and stood before ye Lord, Satan came also
among them. Think not that God sometime appears to the Angels, and sometime
not, for the good Angels do always see ye face of God: neither communeth God
either with the Angels or with the Devil, with bodily speech, but the holy
ghost in the scripture, speaks many things unto us, according to our feeling,
and uses a manner of speaking familiar unto us, attributing, appearing,
speaking, enquiring and aunswering to God and to Angels, which thing man only
uses, to the intent that we thereby, may the easlier perceive his meaning. The
coming of the Angels here, is none other thing. then to give accounts of the
office enjoined them, which they give, knowing that God sees with what trust
they did it, and to give thanks and wait for their reward. They came (says
Origin) honoring, magnifieng, praising, giving thanks. Of Satan also writes
he thus: He came neither with gooing too, or coming in, but he came in
thought, counsel and most wicked desire to accuse the righteous before God:
his thought and desire are taken for a coming. The Devil then is counted to
have come into the sight of God, not that the most wicked came indeed in the
sight of the good God, but because his cruel and most wicked thoughts came
into the sight of God. And thus even now a days also comes the Devil with
them into the sight of God, in that he daily accuses, finds faults,
persecuteth and troubles the godly. T. M.

This declares that although Satan be aduersarye unto God, yet is he compelled
to obey him, and do him all homage, without whose permission and appointment
he can do nothing. Geneua.

Of the man that Paul delivered to Satan, what it means.
To deliver him to Satan. (...)
To deliver to Satan is (...) banish a man from the Congregation of the
faithful, which is the mystical body of Christ. Ye shall understand, that
there us but two Kingdoms, that is to say, the Kingdom of Christ, which is
the Church or Congregation of the faithful, and the Kingdom of Satan.
Whosoever then is a rotten member cut off from the body of Christ, he is
immediately received into the kingdom of the Devil, as though he were
delivered up unto Satan, and that ought to be done, to the intent that carnal
and fleshly wisdom and hautines of mind, may be ther-through abated. Sir. I.
Cheek.

Which is to be as an Heathen man and Publican. For being wounded with shame
and sorrow, his flesh or old man should dye: and the spirit or new man shall
remain alive, and enjoy the victory in that day, when the Lord shall judge
the quick and the dead. 1. Pet. 4. 6. Geneua.

How Peter is called Satan.
Get thee behind me Satan. Mat. 16. 23
The Hebrews call him Satan, that is to say, an adversary, whom the Grecians
call Diabolos, that is to say, slaunderer or tempter. But it is spoken of them,
that either of malice as Judas. John. 6. 70. or of lyghtnes and pride resist
the will of God. Beza.

Which words signifies an adversary, who resists the will of God, either of
malice as did Judas, or of rashness and arrogancy as Peter did. Geneua.

We ought to rebuke sharply all them, that go about to pluck us away from the
obedience that we owe unto God and to his word. Sir. I. Cheek.

How Satan can do no more then God permits him.
Go: Mat. 8. 32.
then went they out and departed into the Heard of Swine. Satan ye devil can do
no more then God does permit and suffer him: no, not so much as to enter into a
filthy hog: we are much better then many Hogs before God, if we cleave unto
his son by faith. Sir. I. Cheek.

How Satan entered into Judas.
And after the soppe Satan entered into him. Io^. 13. 27
He was entered into him before, as this Euange list affirms in the beginning
of this Chapter verse. 2. but now began he more to enforce his strength, and
more openly to show himself. In like manner as the Apostles had the Holy
Ghost before Christ's resurrection, when they believed in him, when they
confessed him to be the Son of God, but they evidently received him, when
Christ was ascended. Act. 2. Tindale.

Of the binding up, and loosing again of Satan.
And I saw an Angel descending from heaven, Apoc. 20. ^
having a key of the bottomless Pit, and a great chain in his hand, and he
took the Dragon the old Serpent which is the Devil, and Satanas, and bound
him for a thousand years, and put him in the bottomless dungeon, and shut him
up, and signed him with his seal, that he should no more seduce the Gentiles,
till a thousand years were expired, and after that he must be loosed again for
a little show of time. And I saw seats, and they sat upon them, and judgment
was given unto them, and the souls I saw of them which were beheaded for the
testimony of Jesus. By these words of ye Revelation here recited, three
special times are to be noted First, the being abroad of Satan to deceive the
world. Second, the binding up of him. Thirdly, the loosing out of him again,
after a thousand years consumate for a time. Concerning the interpretation of
which times, I see the common opinion of many to be deceived, by ignorance of
Histories and state of things done in the Church: supposing that the coming up
of Satan for a thousand years, spoken of in the Revelation, was meant from ye
time of Christ our Lord. Wherein I grant that spiritually the strength and
dominion of Satan, in accusing and condemning us for sin, was cast down at
the passion, and by the passion of Christ our Savior, and locked up not only
for a thousand year, but for ever and ever. Albeit, as touching his malicious
hatred and fury of that Serpent, against the outward bodies of Christ's poor
Saints (which is the heel of Christ) to afflict and torment the Church
outwardly: that I judge to be meant in the Revelation of Saint John, not to
be restrained, till the ceasing of those terrible persecutions of the
Primitive Church. At which time it pleased God to pity the sorrowful
affliction of his poor flock, being so long under persecution (the space of
300. years) and so to assuage their griefs and torments, which is meant by
binding up of Satan, worker of all these mischiefs. Understanding thereby,
that for so much as the Devil, Prince of this world, had now by the death
of Christ the son of God, lost all his power and interest against the soul
of man, should turn his furious rage and malice which he had to Christ,
against the people of Christ. Which is meant by the heel of the seed. Genesis 3.
15. in tormenting their outward bodies. Which yet should not be for ever, but
for a determinate time, when as it should please the Lord, to bridle the malice
and snaffle the power of the old Serpent, and give rest unto his Church, for
the term of a thousand years.

Which time being expired, the said Serpent should be suffered loose again
for a certain or a small time. In the bo. of Mart. fol. 493.

SATISFACTION.
What is understood by this word, satisfaction.
AS pertaining to satisfaction, this wise understand, that he that loves God,
has a commandment (as S. John says in the. 4. chapter of his first Epistle
ver. 21.) to love his neighbor also. Whom if thou have offended, thou, must
make him amends or satisfaction, or at the least way if thou be not able, ask
him forgiveness, and if he will have mercy of God, he is bound to forgive
thee. If he will not, yet God forgiueth thee, if thou thus submit thy self.
But to God ward Christ is a perpetual and an ^uerlasting satisfaction for
evermore. As often as thou fallest through frailty, repent and come again, and
thou art safe and welcome, as thou may see by the similitude of the riotous
son, Lu. 15. If thou be lepen out of sanctuary, come in again. If thou be
fallen from the way of truth, come thereto again and thou art safe. If thou be
gone astray, come into field again, and the shepherd Christ shall save thee,
yea and the Angels of heaven shall rei^yce at thy coming, so far it is that
any man shall beat thee, or chide thee. If any Pharesie envy thee, grudge at
thee, or rail upon thee, thy father shall make answer for thee, as thou see
in the fore-rehearsed likeness or Parable Whosoever therefore is gone out of
the way, by whatsoever chance it be, let him come to his Baptime again, and
unto the profession thereof, and he shall be safe. For though that the washing
of Baptime be past, yet the power thereof, that is to say, the word of God,
which Baptime preaches, lasts for ever, and saves (...). As Paul is past
and gone, ^enerthelesse, the Lord ye Paul preached, lasts ever and saves
ever, as many as come theretoo, with a repenting heart and steadfast faith.
Hereby see thou that when they make penance of repentance, and call it a
Sacrament, and divide it into contrition, confession, and satisfaction, they
speak of their own heads, and lie falsely. Tindale. fol. 149.

How hurtful the doctrine of satisfaction is.
The Schoolmen do call satisfaction the work of pe^ance, enioined by the
Priest after the Auricular confession And here they make much ado, that the
satisfaction be neither less nor lighter, then counteruaileth the weight of
the sin. This doctrine of satisfaction does exceedingly darken the
clearenesse of the grace of Christ, it does make men's consciences either
falsely assured, when they suppose that they have satisfied: either it does
piteously torment them, when they cannot tell by what time they have satisfied
in the sight of God for one sin, much less for all their sins. Beside
that, it has not opened one gap, but all doors, windows and arches, etc. to
the Popes mark^t, to gape upon pardons, and for the traffike of Priests Masses,
to deliver souls out of Purgatory: wherefore all godly do worthily abhor
it. The doctrine of the Gospel does denounce unto us pardon of our sins by
the blood of Christ, by the shedding whereof, there is satisfaction made, not
only for ours, but for the sins of all the world. And wheresoever this grace
does take place, that satisfaction has nothing to do, we could bear with
them if they said, that like as the faith in Christ, is reputed for
righteousness to the believers, according to the example of Abraham, so
repentance is of mercy, and frankly imputed for satisfaction. As we may
perceive it was in the prod^gall son, whose return and repentance, his
father of his right fatherly clemency, did accept for a most sufficient
satisfaction, and sought nothing further of him. This meaning of satisfaction
does derogate nothing from the grace of God, but does exceedingly advance it.
It makes nothing for the gain and iuglings of the Popes markets, but it
makes much to the quieting of our consciences. Wherefore we will stick unto
it, and we will lean the trumpery wares of counterfaite satisfactions, to the
Pope, and his Priests and Friars. Musculus. fol. 219.

Of two manner of satisfactions.
There are two manner of satisfactions, the one is to God, the other to my
neighbor. To God cannot all the world make satisfaction for one sin:
insomuch, as if every grass of the ground were a man, as holy as ever was
Paul or Peter, and should pray unto God all their life long for one crime, yet
could they not make satisfaction for it: but it is only the blood of Christ,
that has made full satisfaction unto God for all such crimes. Heb. 7. or else
were there none other remedy, but we should all perish. There is another
satisfaction, which is to my neighbor whom I have offended, whom I am bound to
pacify as we can agree, and as the Law of the Realm determines between us,
as if I had defamed him, then am I bound to pacify him, and to restore him to
his good name again: If I have murdered any man, then by the laws of the
Realm I must dye for it, to pacify my neighbor and the Commonwealth: but yet
I am sure that Rastal is not so childish, as to think that this eiuill
satisfaction, is the very satisfaction which pacifieth Gods wrath for breaking
his law: for if thou murder a man, and should dye an hundred times for it,
yet except thou have satisfaction in Christ's blood: and so I speak that no
temporal pain was instituted of God, for the intent that we should satisfy
Gods wrath thereby, etc. Frith. fol. 74.

SATVRNINVS.
Of his opinions.
THis man was of Antioch, Heretic
he taught in all points as Menander did before him. He affirmed that Christ
had no true body, but a fantastical body, and that there was no resurrection.
Adding moreover, that marriage and procreation was of the Devil. Ireneus. lib.
1. cap. 22. Eus. li. 4. cap. 6.

SAVIOVRS.
How that there is, no more Saviors then one.
AN answer to those that asks whether Paul go about to make many
Saviors, 2. Tim. 4. 1^.
do this, and then thou shall save thy self and other. Paul makes no more
Saviors but God alone, for he attributes salvation unto the instruments
whereby God works salvation. When as David killed Golias with a sling, he
that says David's sling killed Golias with a ^ling, says not there was more
slayers of Golias beside David, for the sling was the proper weapon, that David
killed Golias with. And so is Timothy Gods instrument, whereby he wrought the
salvation of Timothy, and of them that believed his preaching. But if a man say
that a lance killed Golias, the same man makes another killer of Golias
beside David, for the Lance was none of the weapons that David killed Golias
with. So he that gives salvation instrumentally to any instruments, which God
has only appointed, and used to work salvation unto other instruments then
are peculiar and proper unto God, which God neither appointed, neither at any
time has used, neither will allow for his instruments, makes another Savior
beside God. I. Veron.

Thou gave them Saviors, 2. ^sd. 9. 27.
etc. Saviors are here called the Princes or Captains, which saved the
people from their enemies. Iudic. 3. T. M.

How this place following is understood.
Whosoever will save his life shall loose it. Luke 9. 24.
Whosoever will save his life, that is: whosoever (in this world,) regards so
his life, that he will not put it in ieopardye for me, when the time requires:
the same shall loose his life eternally. Tindale.

To be saved by hope, what it means.
For we are saved by hope. We are saved by hope, that is, Romans 8. 24
we hope to be delivered out of the corruption of our bodies, into the glory
that Christ now is in, and therefore saint not in our tribulations. Tindale.

SAVLE.
Why he was called Paul.
THen Saul, which also is called Paul. Act. 13. 9.
Of the name of Paul do many dispute: but the most allowed opinion is, that
of the Hebrews he was called Saul, and after the manner of speech of the
Gentiles and Romans, he was called Paul.

How Saul rent Samuels coat.
When Saul took Samuel by the lap of his coat and rent it, 1. Re. 15. 27
Samuel said unto Saul: The Lord has rent the Kingdom of Israel from thee
this day. Some expositours do say, that Samuel did give this token to Saul,
that such a man should reign in his steed, as should cut off the lap of his
coat, which thing David did. For Saul, when he saw the lap of his coat in
David's hand, said unto him, Now I know surely, that thou shall reign after me.

SCEPTER.
What the Scepter of Christ is.
HIs scepter is a scepter of righteousness, Heb. 1. 8.
not only a righteous Scepter, that is, that whatsoever he ordeineth it is
righteous, but the scepter of righteousness, that is, whatsoever is righteous,
is ordained of him: and all spiritual scepters of all Kings which are not
directed by him, they are crooked and broken, scepters of superstition, and
scepters of Idolatry, there is none of righteousness, but only the scepter of
Jesus Christ. The Scepter is a little wande, which Princes have accustomed to
bear in their hands, and it is a sign of their government, and by a Metonimia
it signifies here ye government it self. Now the scepter of Christ is as his
kingdom is, not a scepter of wood or metal like other kings, for his
kingdom is not of this world as theirs is: but his scepter the Prophet Esaias
in plain words describeih it: Isa. 11. 4.
He shall smite the earth (says he) with the scepter of his mouth, and with
the breath of his lips, shall kill ye ungodly. In which words of ye Prophet, we
see both what is the scepter, and why it has the name of righteousness. The
scepter is ye word of his mouth, y^ is, the preaching of ye Gospel, not
decrees nor decre^alls, nor traditions of men, nor unwritten verities: by none
of al these we have received the spirit of God, but only by hearing faith
preached: it therefore alone is the scepter, etc. Deering.

SCISME.
What Scisme is, and how it is defined.
SCisme is a Greek word, like as Hersie is, and signifies a cutting off, a
division or a breach; derived from ye Greek word Okizio, which is as much to
say as to cut, to divide, and to break asunder. Augustine does allow their
definition, which do define Scisme to be a new discention of some Congregation
upon a diversity of opinions: and Heresy, an old worn Scisme. But seeing
the signification of this word is manifest and known, I think it a plainer
way to define a Scisme, to be a cutting a sunder of the Ecclesiastical unity
and peace, whereby the fellowship of the faithful is divided into two parts and
opinions, and that it skilleth not whether it be new or old, or else from whom
it proceed. It was surely a Scisme that the Corinthians were divided into two
parts, and, said one: I am of Paul, and another: I am of Cephas, and another:
I am of Apollo. Like as the Scisme of the kingdom of the Israelites was, when
the ten Tribes were separated from Judah and Benjamin under Roboam, was as well
a Scisme when it came to be old under the last king of that people, as when it
was yet new begun under Roboam. So the Schisms of the Church be as well
Scismes after all their auncientie of times and continuance, as they were at
the first beginning, though they convey themselves never so great a color of
the Catholic church, because they have been so long used and accustomed. Mus.
fol. 542.

Of Scismes good and evil.
That is an evil schism, whereby the good unity and concord is cut and put a
sunder: and that is a good scisme, when the naughty knot and nest was broken.
The unity of ye Jews was naught, before they heard the doctrine of Christ,
and concord was broken by scisme after ye hearing of Christ. So we do read in
John. And there was a scisme a new among ye Jews, because of these words and
talk. For many of them said, He has a Devil and is mad, why do ye hearken
unto him? Other said: These be not the words of one that has the Devil: can
a devil open the eyes of ye blind. This scisme the doctrine of Christ stirred
up among the Jews. And what godly person will say, that the unity and concord
which went before was better then it. By the like scisme the whole world was
d^uided afterward, through the preaching of Christ's Gospel, which division
Christ does expressly challenge to himself, saying: I came not to send peace,
but a sword, for I came to separate, etc. This scisme came upon good, that is
to say, upon the Gospel of salvation, and it tends to good end, that is to
say, unto the salvation of mankind: and it did break up the naughty unity,
which rested in the Catholic or universal blindness of men's minds, and it
called all men unto the true unity. Muscul. fol. 543.

SCORNER.
The property of a scorner or mocker.
Reprove not a scorner, least he owe thee evil will. ^rou. 9 8.
Scornful or mocking persons after David Kimhi, are those which be subtle and
crafty to hurt other, and which are ready to defame other, and to open and
tell secrets, and so to break concord and unity, and those also which make a
mock at the word of God, and despise it for foolishness, as in the 14. 6.
and. 19. 25. and. 22. 10.

Rebuke not a scorner, etc. Meaning them that are incorrigible, which Christ
calls dogs and swine: or he speaks this in comparison, not that the wicked
should not be rebuked, but he shows their malice, and the small hope of
profit. Geneua.

SCORPION.
The Papists compared to Scorpions.
IN three resp^cts are Heretics, Apoc. 9. 3.
and specially the Disciples of Antichrist, and Hipocrites compared to
Scorpions. First, because that like as a Scorpion, whereas he is mild to look
unto, does at length strike privily with venomous sting: for these men pretend
simplicity before the world, and yet work mischief by defaming men behind
their backs. Secondly, because that the Scorpions ^ting s(...)ngeth with his
tail: so these men prefer temporail gain, before spiritual graces, and
wound men's consciences deadly, when they promise most to help the^. And
thirdly, because that when a Scorpion stingeth with his tail, he is not felt
at the first, but yet shows in his poison by little and little afterward. So
they that be beguiled with those Heretics, feel not the wound at the first,
but when the poison has rankeled through all the inward parts, then they feel
themselves stong in the end. Of these men the Apostle writes thus: They that
be of that sect, Romans 16. 18
serve not the Lord Jesus, but their bellies, and deceive the hearts of the
simple through fair speech and flattery. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 129.

They stung their consciences with terrible dreams and visions, and with
fearful re^elations of Purgatory and of Hell, to build them up fair houses
and to live in wealth and pleasure. Finally, they venomed their faith with
their poisoned counsels and promises, and so took they from them y^ true hope
in Christ, making merchandise of them, through covetousness and fair words.
Thus cloystering together like Locusts, they have left nothing green, but they
have withered and destroyed. No works might then be used of Gods prescription,
but such as were fantasied by them for advantage, as Masses founding,
Chauntries building, Priests singing, Images gylting, kissing of relics,
praieng to dead men and such like. And when they were once frank and full,
they stood up togethers proudly against the Lord and his word. Bale.

As the Scorpions of the earth have power. That is, secretly to persecute and
to sting with their tail as Scorpions do, such is the fashion of the
Hypocrites. Geneua.

As the pain that comes of a Scorpion when he has stong a man. Apoc 9. 5.
For at the beginning the sting of the conscience seems as nothing, but
except they soon seek remedy, they perish. Esaias. 2. 19. Ose. 10. 8. Luke.
23. 30. Geneua.

SCRIBE.
What a Scribe is.
A Scribe was he that had the office of interpreting and aunswering unto the
sentences of the Prophets, Mat. 13. 52
as it appears of Herod as king the Scribes in the third chapter before. In an
other place he supposes that they were officers, as our Bishops Chauncelers,
Commissioners, Archdeacons and Officials. Tind.

Every Scribe which is taught, Mat. 13. 52^
etc. The office of Scribes was to interpret and to expound the Law and the
Prophets. He is then a Scribe taught to the Kingdom of God, that has the
spirit, that is to say, the true meaning of the Law and of the Prophets, and
not only out of the dead letter, but out of the treasure of his heart, and
with a fervent spirit of GOD, brings ^oorth Christ out of the Law and
Prophets. Sir. I. Cheek.

Because the Scribes office was to expound the scriptures, he means him that
does interpret them aright and according to the spirit. Geneua.

Every Scribe brings forth of his treasure things both new and old: new
things, that is, the sweet tidings of y^ Gospel to unbind us: and old
things, that is the old Testament and Moses law to bind us.

The Scribes were the Doctors of the Law, foolish and superstitious Glosers,
maintainers of blind customs contrary to the truth. Epiph. de haeres.

SCRIPTVRE.
How the Scriptures are easy to be understood.
IT may be said, Origin
the Scriptures are hard, yet that notwithstanding, if thou read them, they
shall do thee good, for the Lord Jesus Christ, if he find us occupied in the
scriptures, and exercised in the study thereof, not only vouchsafes himself
to be refreshed and fed in us, but also seeing such a banquet prepared, brings
with him his father unto us. Origin. in his. 20. hom. upon. Joshua. Northbrooke.

At the coming of Messiah the people shall be lifted up, Hierom
and shall prophecy, that before lay asleep under their masters. And they
shall go unto the mountains of the Scriptures: and there shall they find
Mountains, Moses and Joshua the son of Nun: the Mountains of the Prophets:
the Mountains of the new Testament, the Apostles and Evangelists: and when
they shall fly to such Mountains, and shall be occupied in the reading
thereof, if they find not one to teach them, yet shall their endeavor or good
mind be allowed, for that they have fled to the Mountains. Hierom upon the.
3. Chap. of Nahum. I. Northbrooke.

It cannot be possible that he that with earnest study and fervent desire
reads the Scriptures should evermore be forsaken: Chrisosto^
for although he want the instruction of man, yet God him self from above,
entering into our hearts, lighteneth the mind, powers his beams into our
wits, opens things that were hidden, and becomes unto us a schoolmaster of
that we know not. Namely, if we will do so much as lies in us. Chrisost. in
his. 36. hom. upon Genesis. I. Northbrooke.

We by our selves without a master shall be able to understand the things which
are there entreated off. Cstrisosto^
So that we occupy our selves in these Epistles day and night: for we do not
by the sharpness of wit and understanding, pearse unto all those things which
we understand. For even they which are of more dull wits, do by continual
study, atteine to hard things. Even as the cogitations and senses of man are
most hard to be known, yet notwithstanding our friends whom we fervently
love, and with whom we are continually conversant, do oftentimes even by a
beck open unto us the cogitations and senses of their minds, without any
token of words and speech by them spoken. So shall it come to pass in these
Epistles (of holy scriptures) so that a man love them, and be continually
conversant in them. He which asks, receives, and he which seeks, finds,
unto him that knocks, it shall be opened. Chris. in his Pref. to the Romans I.
N.

The Scripture of God is like unto a Pothecaries shop, full of medicines of
sundry sorts, that every man may there choose a convenient remedy for his
disease. Basil.
Basil upon the first Psalm. I. Northbrooke.

In the word of God is plenty for the strong man to eat, Fulge^tius
there is enough for the child to suck: There is also milk to drink,
wherewith the tender infants of the faithful be nourished, and strong meats
wherewith the lusty youth of them that is perfect may receive the spiritual
increasement of holy virtue. Fulgentius in his Sermon of the confessors. I.
Northb.

Nothing can deceive them that search the holy Scriptures, for that is the
candle whereby the thief is spied. Theophilactus.
Theophilactus of Lazarus. I. N.

The Scripture is a flud wherein the little lamb may wade, and the great
Olyphant may swim. Gregory.
Gregory in his Epistle to Leonard. I. N.

The Scriptures are easy to the slave, to the husbandman, to the child, and
to him that may seem to be very simple of understanding. Chrisosto^
Chrisost. in his first Homil. upon Mat.

How Christ and the Church are learned in the Scriptures.
In the Scriptures we have learned Christ: In the Scriptures we have learned
the Church: Augustio.
These Scriptures we have commonly, and why do we not commonly retain
both Christ and the Church in them. August. Epist. 166.

Against them that find fault that the Scriptures be dark.
The holy spirit has so nobly and wholesomely tempered the holy Scriptures,
that he might with the easy places of it, serve the greedy hunger of men, One
place of Scripture expound an other.
and with the dark places to take away the loathsomenesse. For there is no
point almost found in the darkness of it, which is not plainly spoken in some
other place. Whereby (says Musculus) it is manifest enough, that if any thing
be spoken darkly in some place of the Scriptures, ye light of it must be sought
ought of those places, where the matter is more plainly expressed, etc. Mus.
fol. 151.

Where things are more plainly uttered in the Scriptures, Augustine.
there must we learn how they are to be understood in dark places. August.
li. 83. quest.

Let us come (says Chrysostom) to the level and mark of the holy Scripture,
Chrisosto^
which does expound it self: And by and by after, The sacred Scripture
expounds himself, and suffers not the hearer for to err. Chrisostom in
his. 2. chap. Genesis Homil. 13.

In the Scriptures are all things needful for our salvation.
The holy Scriptures being inspired from God, Athanasius.
are sufficient to all instructions of truth. Athanasius against the Gentiles.

Not all things ye the Lord Jesus did, are written, Augustine.
as ye Evangelist witnesses. For the Lord both did and said many things that
are not written: but these were chosen out to be written, which seemed
sufficient for the salvation of the unbelievers. Augustine to the Bre. in the
wilderness in his. 49. treatise upon John.

Whatsoever is required for our salvation is already contained in the holy
Scriptures. Chrisosto^
He that is ignorant shall find there what he may learn. He that is
stubburne and a sinner, may find there scourges of the judgment to come, the
which he may fear. He that is troubled may find joys and promises of
euer^asting life, through the beholding of which he may be stirred to good
works. Chrisost. in his. 19. Homil. upon Math.

Read the Scriptures, Augustine.
wherein ye shall find fully what is to be followed and what is to be avoided,
not all things that our Lord Jesus did are written, etc. As before is said.
Augustine to the brethren in, etc.

For as much as Christ himself has not revealed these things, Augustine.
which of us will say, they be these or these? For who is there either so
vain or so rash, who notwithstanding he speaks the truth to whom he
lysteth, and what he ly^teth, will affirm without any testimony of the
Scriptures, that these be the things that the Lord would not then open.
Augustine in the. 96. treatise upon John.

If there be any thing needful to be known, Chrisost^.
or not to b^e known, we shall learn it by the holy Scriptures, if we shall
need to report a falsehood, we shall fetch it out from thence, if to be
corrected, to be chastened, to be exhorted or comforted, to be short, if ought
lack that ought to be taught or learned, we shall also learn it out of the
same Scriptures. Chrisost. upon the. 2. of Tim. the 3. chap.

Like as in a Merchaunts ship are carried diverse things necessary for man's
life. Lyra.
So in the Scriptures are contained all things needful to salvation. Lyra upon
the last chap. of the Proverbs.

How holy Scripture is to be read.
Now to the intent that the reading of holy Scripture may be to our profit,
Apoc. 1. 3.
we must apply our selves to it, not only thankfully and reverently, but
also with great soberness and pure affection, joining prayer thereunto also.
For God reuealeth his mysteries out of heaven. How scripture should be read.
Dan. 2. 18. He gives understanding to the little ones. Psalm. 119. 130.
according also as Christ teaches. Mat. 12. 25. Notwithstanding for as much as
it is not given to all men to read holy writ, there is express mention made of
hearing, which ingendereth faith by ye effectual working of y^ holy Ghost in
men's hearts, for faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Romans
10. 27. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 6.

Look. Search.

Of the ignorance and knowledge of Scriptures.
Ignorance of the Scriptures (says Saint Hierome) is the mother and cause of
errors. Hierome.
And in an other place he says, the knowledge of the Scriptures is the food of
everlasting life. Hierom. in the. 23. of Math.

How by the Scriptures all doubts are tried.
Consider in what danger they be that have no care to read ye holy Scriptures,
Origin.
for by the same Scriptures only, the judgment of this trial must be allowed.
Origin in his. ^0. boo. 16. chap. to the Romans

Never move question hereof, Athanasius.
but only learn of the holy Scriptures. Al doubts tried by y^ Scriptures
Origin
For the only proves that ye shall there find are sufficient to prove the
Godhead of the holy God.

We must needs call to witness the holy Scriptures, for our judgments and
expositions without these witnesses, they carry no credit. Origin in his first
Homely upon Jeremy.

We must read the Scriptures with all diligence, Hierome.
and be occupied in the law of ye Lord both day and night, y^ we may become
perfect exchangers, and be able rightly to discern what money is lawful, and
what is counterfeit. Hierom. in his. 3. b. and. 5. chap. to the Ephe.

I require the voice of the shepherd: read me this matter out of the Prophets:
Augustine.
read me out of the Psalms: read it out of the law: read it out of the
Gospels: read it out of the Apostles. August. in his book of Pastors, the. 14.
chap.

Neither will I allege the Council of Nice against you: nor shall you
allege the Council of Arminium against me: Augustine.
By the authority of Scriptures let us weigh matter with matter, cause with
cause, reason with reason. August. contra Maxi. li. 3. chap. 14.

More weighty is the doctrine of the Scripture and the Prophets, Chrisosto^
then of such as be raised from the dead do report any thing, or if an Angel
descend from heaven: As for the things they talk, they be but servants that
speak them, but whatsoever the Scripture utters the Lord has spoken it. The
Lord therefore does teach us that we should think credit should be rather given
unto the Scriptures, then to all other things. Chrisost. de Lazaro concione. 4.

No man will give heed to the Scriptures, for if we did consider them,
Chrisosto^
we should not only not fall into ^rrours our selves, but also thereof deliver
other that are deceived, and put them from peril. Chrisost. in Epist. ad Heb.
Homil. 8.

Let us not bring deceitful balances, Hierome.
wherein we may weigh whatsoever we lust at our own discretion, saying, this
is heavy, this is light, but let us bring the heavenly balance of the holy
Scripture, as from the treasure of the Lord, and therein let us weigh what is of
more weight. Hierome causa. 24. quest. chap. 1. non adfera.

How Christ overcomes Satan with Scriptures.
Jesus said unto him, it is written again. Mat. 4. 7.
Christ would not overcome Satan by his divine and almighty power, but with
the Scriptures and word of God, to teach us by his own example to fight against
Satan with the holy and sacred Scripture, which are our heavenly armor, and
the word of the spirit. Beza.

How this place following is to be understood.
Among the which some things are hard to be understood, etc. 2. Pe. 3. 16
That is to say, among the which things, for he disputes not here, whether
Paul's Epistles be plain or dark, but says that amongst those things which
Paul has written off in his Epistles, and Peter himself in these two of his
own, there are some things which cannot be so easily understood, and therefore
are of some drawn to their own destruction: and that he says to make us
more attentive and dilligent, and not to remove us from reading of holy things.
For to what end should they have written vain speculations? Beza.

As no man condempneth the brightness of the Sun, because his eyes is not
able to sustain the cleerenesse thereof: so the hardness which we cannot
sometime compass or perfectly understand in the Scriptures, ought not to take
away from us the use of the Scriptures. Geneua.

Of them which say that Scripture hangs upon the judgment of the Church.
I know (says Calvin) that they have commonly the saying of Augustine, Contra
Epist. fundamentalem cap. 5.
where he says he would not believe the Gospel, save that the ^uthoritie of
the Church moved him thereunto. But ^ow untrue and cauillously it is alleged
for such a meaning, by the whole tenor of his writing it is easy to perceive.
He had to do with the Maniches which desired to be believed without gain
saying, when they vaunted that they had y^ truth on their side, but proved it
not. Now Augustine asks them what they would do, if they did light upon a
man that would not believe the Gospel it self, with what manner of persuasion
they would draw him to their opinion. Scripture hangs not on the judgment of
the church
Afterward he says, I myself would not believe ye Gospel, etc. save y^ the
authority of the church moved me thereto: meaning y^ he himself when he was a
stranger from ye faith, could none otherwise be brought to embrace the gospel
for the assured truth of God, but by this, ye he was overcome by the authority
of the Church. And what marvel is it if a man not yet knowing Christ have
regard to men. Augustine therefore does not there teach y^ the faith of the
godly is grounded upon the authority of the Church, nor means that the
certeintie of the gospel hangs thereon: but simply and only, that there
should be no assuredness of the gospel to ye Infidels, whereby they might be
won to Christ: unless y^ consent of ye church did drive them unto it. And the
same meaning a little before he does plainly confirm in this saying. When I
shall praise y^ which I believe, Contra Epist. fundamentalem^ cap. 4.
and scorn ye which thou beleeuest, what think thou meet for us to judge or
do: but ye we forsake such men as first call us to come and know certain
truths, after commanded us to believe things uncertain: And that we follow
them that require us first to believe that which we are not yet able to see,
that being made strong by believing, we may attain^ to understand the thing
that we believe: not men now, but God himself inwardly, strengthening and
giving light to our minds. These are the very words of Saint Austen. Calvin. 1.
book, chap. 7. Sect. 3.

The Papists say, it must be understood after the interpretation of the Church
of Rome, which is false. ^. I^h. 4. 1.
When the Apostles bad us try the spirits, whether they be of God or no: meant
he (trow ye) we should try them according to the testimony of the Church of
Rome? When the men of Thessalonica tried the Apostles doctrine, whether it were
true or no? Asked they y^ judgment of the Church of Rome? etc. Act. 17. 11
Deering.

Objection.
How is the word of God and the Scriptures known but by the Church?

Answer.
The Church was and is a mean to bring a man more speedely to know the
scriptures and the word of God, as was the woman of Samaria a mean that the
Samaritanes knew Christ: but as when they had heard him speak, they said. Now
we know that he is Christ, not because of thy words, but because we our selves
have heard him: So after we came to the hearing and reading the Scriptures
showed unto us and discerned by the Church, we do believe them and know them
as Christ's sheep, not because the Church says they are the Scriptures, but
because they be so, being assured thereof by the same spirit which wrote and
spoke them. Bradford in the book of Mar. fol. 1794.

SEA.
Of the diverse names given to this Sea.
Over the sea of Galile. John. 6. ^.
This is a lake which is called in ye Scripture, the sea or lake of Ginnereth
(which some interpret the sweet sea) and is called of the Greeks Genezar or
Genazareth. Of this Josephus makes mention in his third book of the war of
the Jews and. 18. Sea of Galile.
chapter. S. John calls it the sea of Tiberias, because the city of Tiberias
(so called of Herod the Tetrach for the honor of Tiberius Caesar) bounded
upon the East part of the same. Wherefore by this portion the Evangelist does
more plainly describe ye place whither Christ went. For the whole lake was not
called the sea of Tiberias, but only that part which lay more to the shore
upon the which Tiberias was situate. Marl. fo. 188.

What the Sea of Glass signifies.
As it were a Sea of Glass. Apoc. 4. 6
The Hebrews betoken all manner of gathering of waters by the name of Sea,
according to this saying: and the gathering togethers of waters he called Seas.
Ge. 1. 10. And the vessel wherein the Priests washed themselves when they went
about ye holy ministrations, was called ye brase^ sea. 3. Re. 7. 23. In this
place the word sea is taken for a company of much people whom ye spirit of God
enlighteneth, Sea of Glass.
therefore they be clear as glass like unto Crystal, that is to say, they
be delivered from darkness and rustinesse, and soul spots by Christ Jesus
reigning in the Church, etc. In the. 7. chapter the word sea (of some) is taken
for rich merchant men which traficke upon the Seas. And in the. 16. chapter.
verse. 3. the restless Sea seems to betoken the chief estates of the world,
or the confusion or chaungeablenesse of the world, or else those people that
dwell far of in out Isles. Marl. to. 73.

The world is compared to a Sea, because of the change and unstableness.
Geneua.

And I saw as it were a glassie sea mingled with fire. Apoc. 15. 2
The Sea of glass mixed with fire, signifies the wickedness of the world,
and all wicked enemies and adversaries of the truth and doctrine of the
Gospel. Sir. I. Cheek.

The glassie Sea signifies this brittle and inconstant world mixed with fire,
that is, troubles and afflictions, but the Saints of God overcomes them all,
and sing divine songs to God, by whose power they get the victory. Geneua.

What Job means by these two words, Sea, and Whale.
Am I a Sea or a Whale fish that thou keep me so in prison. Job. 7. 12
Am I a Sea or a Whale (says Job) that thou should set (as it were) such
bars against me, Sea and Whale.
and that I should be feign to have so great lets to stop me? Job protests
here before God, that there was no need why he should be stopped with so
great violence. And why so? I am not like a Sea (says he) which has need of
rampires and lets. If a Sea have broken over his banks, a thousand or two
thousand men must be sent against it, there must be bringing of timber, of
earth, and of stones, to make up so great a breach. Also a Whale will not
suffer himself to be caught without great ado, but great force must be used
to hold so strong and mighty a beast. But Job says, I am no Sea nor Whale:
how is it then that GOD proceeds with so great violence against me? Hereby
he means, that the misery which he endures is over great, and that God has
no need to punish him so. And herein he shows that he had no such stay in
himself, as he ought to have had. Call. upon Job. fol. 99.

SEBELLIVS.
Of his heretical opinions.
THis man denied Christ to be the son of God, Heretic
and said that he was not the first begotten before all creatures. He denied
also the understanding of the holy ghost. He leaned much to the opinion of
Noetus, as touching the three persons. And denied that there was a Trinity.
Epiph. heraes. 62. August. li. de. heraes.

SECOND.
Of the second time of punishing that Nahum speaks of.
WHat do ye think against the Lord? Nahu. 1. 9
He will make an end, neither shall tribulation rise up the second time. Which
words, some of the Hebrews (as Hierome tells) interpret of ye Assirians, who
when they had the first time gotten ye victory against the kingdom of y^ ten
tribes, thought in like manner to prevail against the kingdom of Judah: but y^
it should so come to pass, the Prophet denies and says: That after the first
tribulation, the second should not follow. This exposition may indeed be borne
withal. But there is an other which is more plain, namely, to say that these
things are spoken against Sennacherib, which besieged Jerusalem, unto whom God
threatened a full and through overthrow, I will (says he) so blot thee out,
that I shall not need to rise up the second time against thee: one plague shall
be sufficient, thou shall be so vehemently afflicted with it. Pet. Mar. upon
the Romans

He shows that the enterprises of the Assirians against Judah and the Church,
were against God, and therefore he would so destroy them at once, that he should
not need to return the second time. Geneua.

What is meant by the second death.
He that overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death. Apo. 2. 11
He that so constantly perseuereth in the truth of God, y^ neither flattering
persuasion, Second death.
worldly promotion, nor cruel torment, can pluck his mind from it, shall
never take harm of the second death For the death of them which truly
believes, is precious in the sight of the Lord their God, neither shall sin
be imputed to him that has faith, nor yet dampnation to them that are in
Christ. Bale.

The first death is the natural death of the body: the second death is the
eternal death: from the which are all free, that believe in Jesus Christ.
John. 5. 24. Geneua.

SECRETNESSE.
How secrets ought not to be disclosed.
ALexander the conqueror reading a letter that came from his mother,
containing matter of weight, took Exhestion his friend to him to read the same
with him. And after he had read it, pulled out his signet, and set it to
Exhestions mouth, giving to understand thereby, that he which knows a
seceret, ought to keep his mouth close.

The Roman Fuluius opened a great secret that Augustus had told him, unto his
wife, who being rebuked of the Emperor sell in despair. And first rebuked
his wife, who made him this answer: You blame me (quoth she) without a cause,
for since ye have lived with me so long, ye ought (perdie) to have known my
lightness long or this time, and knowing of it ye should not have credited me
therewith, therefore the fault how great so ever it be, is your own, but yet
will I take the punishment upon me first, and therewithal slew her self
incontinent, and her husband did the like after.

When one asked Metellus a Roman Captain, what he would do touching such an
enterprise in war, he answered him on this wise: If I knew that this shirt
which I have upon my back were wi^ting what I will do, I would burn it
incontinent.

When one asked Aristotle, what thing he thought hardest, he answered, Secrets.

SECT.
What is meant by this word Sect.
WHich was the sect of the Saduces. Act. 5. 17
The word which is used here is heresy, which signifies a choice, and so is
taken for a right form of learning, or faction, or study, and course of life,
which the Latins call a Sect. At the first this word was indifferently used,
but at length it came to be taken only in evil part, where upon came ye name of
heretik, which is taken for one that goes astray from sound and wholesome
doctrine after such sort, y^ he sets light by the judgment of God and his
Church, and continues in his opinion, and breaks the peace of the Church.
Beza.

How many Sects are laid to Luthers charge.
Fredericus Staphilus, shows in his Apology that out of Luther have sprung
three diverse heresies or Sects: The Anabaptists, the Sacramentaries, and the
Confessionists, otherwise called the Protestants. And that the Anabaptists be
divided into six Sects: The Sacramentaries into eight, and the Confessionists
into twenty. Which all be laid to Luthers charge, and for suffering the rude
and rash people, to have the Scriptures in their own tongue.

Answer.
At the first preaching of the Gospel by the Apostles of Christ, and other
holy Fathers, there grew up immediately with the same sundry sorts of Sects, to
y^ number of 90. as they are reckoned in particular by S. Augustine, all
flowing out of one spring, all confessing one Gospel, and all known by the
name of Christ. Besides that the very Apostles and other holy fathers has
seemed to be divided by some discention among themselves. as Peter from S.
Paul: S. Paul from Barnabas: S. Cipriane from Cornelius: S. Augustine from
Hierome: S. Chrysostom from Epiphanius: and so forth. Now if Staphilus had been
in the primitive church, and seen all these hot and troublesome discentions,
doubtless as he says now all these diversities sprung from D. Luther, so
would he then have said, all these former diversities and forms of heresies
sprang only from Christ, and so have concluded as he does now, that the rude
and rash people should in no wise be suffered to read the Scripture.

SECVNDIANI.
What they were.
SEcundiani of secundus, Heretics
together with Epiphanes and Isidorus, taught the like with Valentinus, in life
they were beastly, all women among them were common. They denied the
resurrection of the flesh. Epiphan. herees. 32.

SEE OR SELING.
What is meant by seeeing in this place.
And I turned me about to see the voice that spoke to me. Apoc. 1. 12
After the Hebrew phrase, to see is put for to understand, or to hear, for a
voice is not seen but heard. So read we in Moses, the people saw the voice.
Ex. 20. 18. unless any man had lever to refer this saying unto him y^
uttered the voice, as if John should say, I turned me about to see him that
uttered this great voice, so as the effect should be put for the cause. Marl.
upon the Apoc. fol. 20.

How the people saw God.
And saw the God of Israel. Exo. 24. 10
They saw God, that is, they knew certainly that he was there present, and
they saw him as in a vision, not in his godly nature, but as it were by a
certain revelation. T. M.

And they saw the God of Israel. As perfectly as their infirmities could
behold his majesty. Geneua.

How the just shall see God.
They which are not delighted with craft and deceit, but walk godly, Math. 5. 8
purely and sincerely among men, which also adioine themselves with a sincere
and fervent mind unto Christ, such I say shall see God, that is, first they
shall be endued with the perfect knowledge: they shall understand his will and
mind, and last of all, they shall have everlasting life, when they shall behold
him, not in dark speaking of faith, but face to face with his holy Angels.
Marl. upon Math. fo. 79.

SEED.
How the seed of the righteous man is said to inherit the earth.
ANima eius in bonis demorabitur, and semen eius heriditabi^ terram. Psa. 25. 13
His soul shall long inioye good things, and his seed shall inherit the earth.
This is not a general warrant, that every good man shall have good children,
which shall inioye and inherit their Fathers land. For we read in Scripture of
many good Fathers, which have had children, some foolish and some godly. Isaac
the holy Patriarch had to his sons Jacob the virtuous, and Esau the
scapethrift. King Ezechias was a noble and a godly king of Judah, whose son
Manasses was a murderer of the Prophets of God, and a cruel shedder of
innocent blood. Solomon excelled in wisdom, whose son and heir named Roboa^
was a rash and a foolish man. And on the other ^ide Amon was a wicked Idolater,
but Josias his son was a noble, virtuous and a most excellent king, wherefore
we cannot certainly conclude, that the words of the Prophet when he says: The
soul of that man which fears the Lord shall long enjoy good things, and his
seed shall inherit the earth, that every good man shall have good children,
which shall enjoy and inherit their fathers land, but the meaning is this: By
the virtuous or righteous man's seed, ye must not understand his natural
seed, but his spiritual seed: his spiritual seed are all those which do
follow his godly steps of living: All that his seed, which do labor to
live a godly life, and study with all reverence and fear to please the Lord,
all that seed shall long enjoy good things, etc. Ric. Turnar.

How the field may not be sown with mingled seed, and what it means.
Let none of thy cattle gender with a contrary kind, Leuit. 19. 19
neither sow thy field with mingled seed. Cattle may not gender with a
contrary kind against the order of nature, much less reasonable creatures
made to the Image of God, as men and women: The field may not be sown with
mixed seed, that is, our deed and words may not be mingled with hypocrisy,
neither may our garments be made of lynnen and woollen, that is, we may not
mingle false doctrine with true, or show a carnal life under pretense of
religion. Tho. Matthew.

Thou shall not sow thy vineyard with diverse kinds of seeds, Deuteronomy. 22. ^
etc. The tenor of this law is, to walk in simplicity, and not to be
curious of new inventions. Geneua.

SEEK.
The meaning of this place following.
THey shall seek me early, Pro. 1. 28
but they shall not find me. Because they sought not with affection to God,
but for ease of their own grief. Geneua.

They seek me that hitherto have not asked for me. Esaias. 65. ^
Meaning the Gentiles which knew not God, should seek after him, when he had
moved their hearts with his holy spirit. Romans 10. 20. Geneua.

What it is to seek after God.
O^ seek after God. ^sal. 53. 2
To seek after God is, at no hand to seek our own in any thing, but both to
do and suffer all things to the glory of God and profit of our neighbor, to
deny our selves and all ours, and become the servants of all men, and this is
the especial point of godliness, against which no man strive more stiffly,
then the blood thirsty and deceitful, which think they seek God, and seek
themselves. T. M.

That would understand and seek God. Psalm. 53. 2
Whereby he condemns all knowledge and understanding, that tends not to
seek God. Romans 3. 10. Geneua.

SELAH.
What this word Selah signifies.
SElah signifies a lifting up of the voice. Psalm. 3. 2.
It admonished the singers of the Psalms to sing out in their highest tune,
because the matter of that part of the Psalm, where that word is found, was
especially to be hearkened unto, and to be considered.

This word ( Selah) after Rabikim, was a sign or token of lifting up the
voice, and also a monition and advertisement to enforce the thought and mind
earnestly to give heed to the meaning of the verse, unto which it is added.
Some will that it signify perpetually or verily. T. M.

Selah here signifies a lifting up of the voice, to cause us to consider the
sentence as a thing of great importance. Geneua.

Concerning this word ( Selah) the interpretours agree not among themselves.
Some uphold it to be a mark of affirmation, and to signify as much as truly
or verily, or so be it. Other take it for time without end. Howbeit forasmuch (
Salal) signifies to lift up: the opinion of those is allowable, which think
y^ by this word is betokened, y^ lifting up of the voice in tune. Nevertheless
it is to be understood therwithall, that the notes of singing were applied to
the meaning of the matter. And so the tune answered the thing or the matter
that it was set unto. Calvin upon the. 3. Psalm.

SEAL.
The opening the. 7. Seals, and the meaning thereof.
THe opening of the first seal, Apoc. 6. 2.
tells the state of ye Church in y^ time of ye preaching of Christ and of his
Apostles. For the first beast, 1. Seal.
that is the Lion, gave his voice, that ^etokeneth the preachers of Christ's
resurrection, and of his ascension, for then yede out a white horse, White
horse.
and he that sat upon him had a Bow in his hand, and he yede out ouercomming
to be overcome.

By this white horse we understand the clean life and conversation that these
preachers had, and by the bow their true teaching, pricking sorrow in men's
hearts for there sins without flattering. And they went out of Iewrie y^ they
commen off, ouercomming some of the Jews, and making them to leave the trust
that they hadden in the old law, and to believe in Jesus Christ, and shown
his teaching. And they wenten out to the Paynims, showing to them that their
Images were no Gods, but men's works vnmightie to save themselves or any other,
drawing them to the belief of Jesus Christ, God and man. In the opening of the
second seal, 2. Seal.
there cried the second beast, that is a calfe, Cal^e
that was a beast wonted to be slain, and offered to God in the old law.
This shows the state of the Church in the time of Martirs, that for their
steadfast preaching of Gods true law, shed their blood, that is signified by
the red horse Red horse
that went out at this second opening, and this estate began at Nero the
cursed Emperor, and dured till the time of Constantine the great, that endued
the Church. For in his time many of Christ's servants and leaders of Gods
flock were slain. For of. 32. Bishops of Rome, that were between Peter and
Siluester the first, I read but of four, but that they were Martirs for the
law of Christ.

And also in the time of Dioclesian the Emperor, the persecution of the
Christian men was so great, that in thirty days were slain two and twenty
thousand men and women, in diverse countries for the law of God. 3. Seal.
The opening of the third seal, tells the state of the Church in time of
Heretics, that beth figured by the black horse, Black horse^
for false understanding of holy writ, for that cried the third beast that is a
man, Man.
for at that time was it need to preach the mystery of Christ's incarnation
and his passion against these Heretics that ^elden miss in these points:
How Christ took very mankind of our body, him being God as he was
before, and his mother being maid before and after. The opening of the fourth
seal, tells the state of the Church in the time of hypocrites, 4. Seal.
that beth by signified the pale horse, Pale horse
y^ beth signs of penance without forth to bind the people. And he y^ sat
upon the horse, his name was Death, Death.
for they should slay Ghostly them that they leden, and teaches to trust upon
other thing then God: And hell follows him, for hell receives thilke that
those destinieth. At that time shall it need, that the fourth beast that is the
Eagle, Eagle.
make his cry that flies highest of fowls, to rear up Gods Gospel, and to
praise that law above other, least that men's wit and their traditions ouergrow
and trodden down the law of God, by enforming of those hypocrites, and that is
the last state that is, either shall be in the Church, before the coming of
the great Antichrist. The opening of the fifth seal 5. Seal.
tells the state of the Church that then shall follow, and the desire that
lovers of Gods law, shuldeth have after the end of this world, to be delivered
of this woe. The opening of the sixth seal, 6. Seal.
tells the state of the Church in time of Antichrists time, the which state
ye may know to be in the Church, when ye sees fulfilled that Saint John
prophesies to fall on the opening of this seal, where he says thus: After
this I saw four Angels standing upon four corners of the earth^ holding the
four winds of the earth, that they blown not on the earth, ne upon the sea,
ne upon any tree. These four Angels be the number of all the devils ministers
that in that time shalleth in the pleasance of the Lord Antichrist, stop the
four winds, that beth the four Gospels to be preached, and so let the breath
of the grace of the holy Ghost, to fall upon men mourning for sin, and
casting them to amendment, and to other that woulden increase in virtues,
either upon perfect men. What is there after this to fall, but that the
mystery of the seventh seal 7. Seal.
be showed, that he come in his own person. That Jesus Christ shall sleye with
the breath of his own mouth, when the fiend shall show the uttermost
persecution that he and his servants may do to Christ's lims, and that shall be
the third warning that the world shall have to come to the dreadful judgment,
etc. This is drawn out of a Sermon in the book of Martirs, preached in the
year of our Lord. 1389. and in the days of king Henry the fourth by Richard
Wymbeldon. fol. 653.

The meaning of this place following.
Whom God the Father has sealed. John. 6. 27.
That is, whom God the father has distinguished from all other men, by
planting his own virtue in him, as though he had sealed him with his seal,
that he might be a lively pattern and representer of him, and that more is,
install him to this office, to reconcile us men unto God, and bring us to
everlasting life, which is only proper to Christ. Beza.

Sealed, that is, he has put his marks of the Holy ghost, which testifies
with miracles what he is. Tindale.

Sealed. For when he appointed him to be the Mediator, he set his mark and
seal in him to be the only one to reconcile God and man together. Geneua.

SELEVCIANI.
What the opinions of these heretics were.
SEleuciani, or Hermiani, of one Seleucus, Heretics.
taught that the substance whereof the world was made, was not made of God,
but was coeternall with God: That God makes not the soul, but Angels of fire
and spirit: that evil is sometimes of God, and sometimes of the thing it self:
that Christ sits not in the flesh at the right hand of the father, but has
his seat in the Sun: that there was no visible Paradise: that Baptime is not
to be received by water: that there shall be no resurrection, but the daily
generation of children. Aug. li. de haer.

SELL.
How this place following is understood.
Go and sell all that thou have, Mar. 10. 21
and give to the poor. Go and sell all that thou have, that is, pluck thy
heart from all that thou do possess, and so forsake them with all thy heart,
that in thy mind thou do sell them, and be ready also indeed to sell
them, if the necessity of thy neighbor require it: the effect and trust in
things possessed, must we ever renounce, or else are we not perfect. As Mat. 19.
21. Luke. 12. 33. Tindale.

He has sold all that ever he has, that surely intends for the love of
Christ, to help the poor withal that he may. Voluntas reputatur pro facto.
The will is accepted to the deed, as is said commonly. And this saying both of
James and also of the Evangelist, I think verily belongs to all Christen men
that they should perform it, none except, neither man ne woman, as we use to
say, but to them as well as to any other we call religious. Lamb. in the b. of
Mar. fol. 1266.

This is to be noted, that Christ does not only command to sell all that we
have, but also to give unto the poor: because to cast away riches without any
regard is not a virtue, but rather vain ambition. Crates of Thebes is highly
commended of profane Historiographers, because he cast his money and his
precious Jewels that he had into the Sea, because that he thought that
without the loss of his riches he could not be safe. As though indeed it had
not ben better to distribute y^ to others, which he counted superfluous unto
himself, then so to have done. Truly seeing that charity is the bond of
perfection, he that depriueth himself of the use of money, deserves no
commendation at all. Therefore, the selling of the goods, is not here
commended simplye of our Savior Christ, but the lyberalytie in helping the
poor. Marl. fol. 431.

Christ here discovers his Hypocrisy, and caused him to feel his own
weakness, not generally commanding all to do the like. Geneua.

Sold under sin what it means.
But I am carnal sold under sin. Romans 7. 14
Like as bondmen are violently thrust, hurled and turmoiled, as it pleases
their cruel master: so are we through heaps of sins, drawn to many evil
doings, which we do neither lyke^ nor allow. The Bible note.

SELVM.
The misery that happened unto the Jews, is described under this man.
AS touching selum the son of Josiah, etc. (...). 22. 11
Some understand here by Selum, all the sons of Josiah, and verily they were
all taken prisoners with great shame, and dyed out of Jerusalem, yea out of
the land of Israel, and were buried without the honor due unto Kings. First,
Iehoahaz, whom many think to be specially signified by Selum, was brought
into Egypt, and there he dyed. 4. Reg. ^3. 31. And his brother Eliakim which
came in his steed was taken of Nabuchodonosor, and fettered and brought to
Babylon. 2. Par. 36. 4. Whose successor Iehoachim, was also brought to
Babylon, and his mother too. 4. Reg. 24. 25. At the last his Uncle Zedekiah
through his falsehoode both to God and man, betrayed the whole kingdom, and
was also brought to Babylon, and there had his children slain before his face,
and his own eyes put out. 4. Re. 25. 7. All this lamentable business should
Jeremy seem to note here in few words If any man think this Prophecy to
belong only to Iehoahaz, with him will I not strive. T. M.

SENECHDOCHE.
What kind of figure it is.
SEnechdoche is a figure Figu(...)
where part is used for the whole, and the whole for the part.

SENNACHARIB.
How and wherefore his own sons slew him.
WHen the Princes of Assyria, 4. Re. 1^. 37.
saw such a number of the Assyrians slain (in one night) by the Angel of God
for the great pride of Sennacherib, and his blasphemy against the God of
Israel, they were sore troubled and moved against him. The King fled to Niniue,
and being in great fear of his life, gate him into the Temple of his God
Nesrah and prayed, promising his God that if he escaped the great danger he
was in, of his Lords and Commons, that he would sacrifice both his sons unto
him for a Sacrifice. His sons now hearing of this, fell upon their father in
the Temple and slew him, and so fled into y^ land of Armenia. They did not thus
slay their father, of a desire they had to reign after him, for then they would
not have fled: but they slew him only to save their own lives. Lyra. This was
the just judgment of God for his blasphemy y^ he should be slain before y^
Idol, whom he preferred to ye living God, and by the^, by whom he ought of
nature to have been defended. Ge.

SENT.
How this place following is understood.
HOw shall they preach except they be sent. Romans 10. 1^.
Except they be sent, that is, except the word be given them of God. Except
they be sent, ye will ask of who^? Uerely of him which is the owner of the
Gospel, y^ is God: of him be they sent which preach Christ truly and purely,
without the desire of vainglory or gains. Of the same manner does Christ
prove that he was sent of his father, because he spoke to the glory of his
father not of himself. John. 7. 17. But such as under the pretense of
preaching the Gospel, preach men's traditions, whereby they seek the praise of
themselves, are false Apostles, and sent of Antichrist, not of Christ. Tindale.

SEARCH.
Why God is said to search.
GOd is said to search, John. 5. 39
for that, that which men desire perfectly and exactly to know they diligently
search for it: so God because he beholds our most hidden thoughts, is said
to search the hearts, otherwise, he before he begin to search, knows what we
have need of. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fo. 224.

How we are commanded of Christ to search the Scriptures.
Search the Scriptures. The Scriptures are given to us from above, not to the
end we might have only in books, and so laid up as our treasure, as we see
many men do: neither yet are they given that we might simply and slightly read
them, either that by a supersticious opinion, the reading of the^ might be in
steed of worship and divine se^uice, as we see the Papists do, and as the
Jews continually do on the Sabbath days: but they are given to this end,
that they might be read with diligence, and with a mind desirous to find out
those things, which belong to true knowledge and true godliness. The readers
of the Scriptures must be searchers, and not corrupters, wresters, dreamers or
supersticious murmurers. And ye scriptures do not require any searching, but
that which is godly, humble, and desirous to know and embrace one truth only:
otherwise a man may find some which read the Scriptures, but not to search out
Gods truth, but rather to hinder the same. Even so Herod inquired out the
truth out of the Scriptures, concerning the place where Christ should be
borne, not to the end he might worship him, but rather to destroy him. Also y^
Pharesies said to Nichodemus, Search the Scriptures, and see how that a prophet
comes not out of Galile. They said not, and see what is written in the
Scriptures concerning Christ. So likewise wicked and ungodly men do search the
Scriptures to corrupt them to their own destruction. By this word Scripture,
is understood the old Testament. For Christ did not first of all begin to be
manifest in the Gospel, but having testimony out of the Law and Prophets, he
only exhibited himself in the Gospel. Therefore that which Christ says
here, agrees with that which he spoke to his Disciples after his
resurrection, saying: These are the words which I spoke unto you, when I was
with you, that all must needs be fulfilled, which was written of me in the Law
of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, etc. Marl. upon John. fol.
179.

Though that miracles bare record unto his doctrine, yet desired he no faith to
be given, either to his doctrine or to his miracles, without record of the
Scriptures. When Paul preached. Act. 17. 11. the other searched the Scriptures
daily, whether they were as he judged them. Why shall not I likewise see,
whether it be the Scripture that thou alledgest: yea, why shall not I see the
christure and the circumstannces, and what goes before and after, that I may
know whether thine interpretation be the right sense, or whether thou iugglest,
and drawest the Scripture violently, unto thy carnal and fleshly purpose, or
whether thou be about to teach me, or to deceive me. Tindale.

And searched the Scriptures daily, Act. 17. 11.
whether those things were so. In this place are all Christians taught what
they ought to do, to try the Preachers, and other that came under color to
set forth true religion unto us, according to the saying of Saint Paul: Try
all things, and choose out that which is good. 1. John. 4. 1. Learn here,
that the word is the touchstone. Sir. I. Cheek.

This was not only to try, if those things which they had heard were true, but
also to confirm themselves in the same, and to increase their faith. Geneua.

SERPENT.
What Serpent do signify,
Look. Leuiathan.

Wherefore the Serpent was called Nehustan.
Look. Nehustan.

What it is to suck the Serpents head.
He shall suck the Serpents head. Job. 20. 16.
That is, he shall be subject to all cursednesse, and suffer all manner
sorrows. It is such a manner of speech, as is before in the. 15. 16. of
drinking wickedness. T. M.

He compares evil gotten goods to the venyme of Aspes, which Serpent is most
dangerous, noting that Jobs great riches were not truly come by, and therefore
God did plague him justly for the same. Geneua.

SERVICE.
What the true service of God is.
WE cannot know wherewith we shall serve the Lord, Exo. 10. 26
till we come thither. This was an outward service: but the true and right
service of God is, to fear him as a Father, to love him and keep his
commandments, and to commit a man's self only unto him, trusting in his
mercy only, setting all thought and care upon him, and when we have offended,
to repent, and to be sorry and knowledge our offenses, and believe that he will
forgive it us, for his truth sake, as 1. Pe. 5. Psa. 37. 3. T. M.

How the service ought to be ministered in a known tongue. Objection.
Paul went over many countries, as Pamphilia, Cappadocia, Phrigia, etc. But he
spoke not to every man in diverse tongues, therefore some were spoken too in an
unknown tongue, which was not their own.

Answer.
Fredericus Furius a Spaniard, which dedicated his book to Cardinal Burgensis
a Spaniard, tells a quite contrary tale, for (says he) Andrew Peter's brother
preached unto the Scythi, Segdiani and Sacri in their tongue, Barthelmew to the
Indians in their tongue: Jacob to the twelve Tribes in their tongue: Thomas to
the Parthians in their tongue, to the Medes in their tongue, to the Persi,
Hercani and Bracchi in their tongue. But put case Fredericus Furius were a
tonguelesse man, and had now yet said nothing, I ween that place of the Acts
of the Apostles, will easily choke D. Saunders, and all those barkers Lonanians.
The people there say then, Non omnes qui loquuntur linguis, Galilei sunt, etc.
Are not all these y^ speak here, men of Galile, is it not much that every one
of us does hear his own vulgar ^ mother tongue? We Parthians, Medes,
Elamites, of Mesopotamia, of Iewry, Cappadocia, Pontus, of Asia, Phrigia,
Pamphilia, and Egypt, of Lybia, Rome, Crete and Arabia, where these men speak
y^ noblenes of matters divine in our own tongue. T. D.

Objection.
The Catholics affirm, that the Protestants cannot prove that in the
Primitive Church, the public service was in the Siriacall, or Arabicke, or
Egyptian, or any other barbarous tongue.

Answer.
S. Hierom describing the pomp of Paulas funeral, Hierom^
has these words, At her funeral all y^ multitude of ye city of Palestine met
together. The Psalms were song in order, in y^ Hebrew, Greek, Latin and
Syrian tongue. Here in one City four several Nations, in their common
service, used four several tongues. Again, S. Austen willing y^ Priests to
apply their study to correct ye errors of their latin speech, adds thereto
this reason, y^ the people unto ye things they plainly understand, may say,
Amen. Which se^te^ce of S. Au. seems to be spoken generaly of al tongues.

SEAT OF GOD.
What the seat of God is.
GOds seat is ye everlasting state of his power: y^ rainbow signifies his
mercy and patient suffering: y^ 24. seats, Apo. 4.^
and the. 24. Elders do signify y^ most highest justice of God, and that y^
most special friends of God, both of ye old and new Testament, are incorporate
unto ye kingdom of God. The sea of glass may signify unto us, the
adversities of this life, which serve to the glory of God, and the profit of
the faithful. Sir. I. Cheek.

SETHIANI.
What manner of heretics these were.
SEthiani were heretics, Heretics
deriuing their pedigree of Seth ye son of Adam, whom they honored and called
Christ. They affirmed also, y^ Jesus in y^ beginning of ye world was called
Seth, but in the latter days Christ Jesus. Epipha. (haer. 39.) says that he
disputes with some of them in Egypt, and that the last of them were in his
time. August. li. de haer.

SEVEN.
How the number of seven is taken in Scripture.
John to y^. 7 churches y^ are in Asia. Apoc. 1.^
The churches y^ were at that time in Asia, were esteemed to excel almost all
the Churches of the whole world, both in multitude of people, and in holiness
of life, according as it is to be seen in the Acts of the Apostles, and in
Paul's Epistles. Now although that by ye name of Asia is meant the lesser Asia,
which is the third part of this world, yet not withstanding by these seven
Churches, and by the seven Bishops of them, are easily understood al other
Churches, and all Curates of the whole world. According as by the number of
seven, the Scripture do commonly betoken a generality or an universality.
Like as in these texts, where the number of seven is put indefinitely, or
uncertainly: Until the barren woman have borne seven Children, that is to
say, many children 1. Reg. 2. 5. Also seven women (that is to say, many women)
shall take hold upon one man. Esaias. 4. 1. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 7.

This number seven imports a great (and as it were) an infinite quantity.
Pr^. 24. 16
And here ye see why it is said in y^ Proverbs, that the righteous falls
seven times a day, and rises again. True it is that some men understand this
to be meant of sinning: but Solomon speaks only of the mischaunces we fall
into, for we be beaten with many rods, one while there comes some disease,
and another time some other adversity. Now some man shall trouble us, and
anon another shall do us some wrong. Ye see then the falls which godly children
fall into. Some stand of holding them up with strong hand, it seems that he
lets them tumble down like little babes that have no strength.

But what? When we be so fallen, God does always relieve us, and specially (as
he says in another place) he will lay his hand under us, and will not suffer
us to fall over hard. Call. upon Job. fol. 99.

A just man falls seven times, Pro. 24. 16
and rises again. That is, he is subject to many perils, but God delyuereth
him. Geneua.

What the seven Angels do signify.
And I saw the seven Angels stand before God. Apo. 8. 2.
These seven Angels be many Antichrists, and these mighty that do harm to
the faithful, and hinder the Gospel, but Jesus Christ stands at the Altar,
with the Oblation of his body for ye faithful. Sir. I. Cheek.

And I saw says S. John seven Angels standing before the majesty of God,
which signifies the preachers of his word, for the seven several times of
the seven seals opening, to every seal corresponding an Angel. For all that
the preachers has done from the beginning of the Gospel, to the time of this
last seal opening, shall then appear at once. In that day (says Esaias) the
Trumpet shall be blown, they that were lost shall come from the Assyrians, the
scattered ^tock shall come from Egypt, and worship the Lord in Jerusalem. Bale.

SEAVENTIE INTERPRETERS.
Of their translating of the old Testament out of Hebrew into Greek.
THe seauentie Interpreters at y^ request of Ptolomeus king of Egypt,
translated the old Testament out of Hebrew into Greek. 275. year before ye
incarnation of Christ. And whereas some has reported and believed, that these
70. Interpreters being divided into 70. Cellulas, that is, little studies or
sundry little Chambers, at the City of Alexandria should all translate one
way, is a lie (says S. Hierom). For neither A^stias that was a man learned,
and a Writer evermore learned at Ptolomeis hand, did never note no such
miraculous thing by them. No, nor yet Josephus, which being a most diligent
(...)riographer, and also a Jew borne, of whom it is not like y^ he would have
hid the praise of his Contrymen, yet did he never in no part of his 20.
books that he wrote in Gr^ke De Antiq^itatibus Iudaicus, make mention of any
such miraculous interpretation y^ the 70. Interpreters should make. But
A^st^des and also Josephus is contented to write and to grant, y^ the 70.
Interpreters being gathered together in one large lodging or Chamber, In vna
basilica, did confer togethers, and so made a volume and a work in Greek,
of the Bible, that they translated out of their own country speech the Hebrew
tongue. Thus they write of them, and this I think to be true, says S.
Hierome. This is drawn out of the Preface, which S. Hierome made to the 5.
books of Moses, wherein S. Hierom does reprove the 70. Interpreters of error,
for omitting certain text of scripture, which were in the Hebrew verity, and
also alleged of the Evangelists, and for adding in their Translation more
then was found in the Hebrew verity. Also he reproves those which says there
is no Hebrew verity, nor no credit to be given to the Hebrew tongue: but
rather to our Latin Bibles. The Preface is notable, which begins on this
wise: Desiderij mei, etc. These words ( Respice in me) which be added in our
Latin Psalters, are not found in the Hebrew verity: for S. Hierom in the
second Apology y^ he wrote answering unto the railing of Ruffinus, finding
great fault with Saint Hierome for his enterprising to translate the old
Testament: says expressly, that these words ( Respice in me) were added only by
the 70. Interpreters, and were not in the original text of the Hebrew verity.

SEVERUS.
Of his heretical opinions.
SEuerus an Eucratite, Heretic
of whom Seueriani, maintained the opinions of Tatianus, adding thereunto of
his own, reuilyng Paul, rejecting his Epistles, and denieng the Acts of the
Apostles. He said that a woman was of the Devil, and that man from the girdell
upward was of God, and beneath of the devil, Epiphan. haeres. 45. Eusebius. li.

SHAME.
What shame is.
SHame is an affection, which springs by reason of some filthiness, and it
may be either a fear or else a grief: for if a man be afraid, least of that
which he does or which he takes in hand, should happen any dishonestie unto
him, he is made ashamed: as we see happens in young men, which when they are
either demanded or hidden to do any thing, they blush, because they are
afraid, least they should not answer aptly, or should not be very able to
do that thing which they are bidden to do. But if an old man or a young man
be put in remembrance of any thing, which seems not to be well done, they
blush because of the sorrow of the dishonestie, whereinto they see themselves
to have incurred. Pe. Ma. up. the To. fo. 156.

How and whereof shame came first.
Shame came of disobedience and breaking of the commandment of God, Genesis 3. 7
for when Adam and his wife had eaten of y^ fruit which Adam was forbidden to
touch, their eyes were so opened, that they saw themselves both naked, at the
which sight they were so ashamed, that they hid themselves from the presence of
God, and found the means to cover their nakedness with Fig leaves.

SHAPE OF GOD.
What it is to be in the shape of God.
WHich being in the shape of God. Phil. 2. 6
To be in the shape of God, is to be equal with God in all things, yea, to be
a very natural God, which thing we ought to understand of Christ, which being
a true natural God, did for our salvation take upon him the shape of a
servant, that is to say, vouchsafe to be borne a very natural man, being in
all things like unto us, sin only being excepted. Sir. I. Cheek.

If Christ being very God equal with the father, laid aside his glory and
being Lord, became a servant, and willyngly submitted himself to most
shameful death: shall we which are nothing but vile slaves, through arrogancy
tread down our brotheren, and prefer our selves. Geneua.

SHAVE.
Look. Woman taken in war.

Wherefore Hanon shaued the beards of David's Ambassadors.
ANd shaued the^, 1. Pa. 19.^
and cut off their garments by y^ half. They shaued off the half of their
beards to put them to shame and villanye: whereas the Ambassadors ought to
have been honored: and because the Jews used to wear side garments and
beards, they thus disfigured them, to make them odious unto others. Geneua.

SHEPHERD.
The opening of these places following.
WHich is not the Shepherd, Ioh. 20. 12
neither the Sheep are his own. These words contain some difficulty, for if
they are not shepherds in the church of Christ, whose sheep are none of their
own, there shall be never a Pastor in ye church, but Christ only. What
means then the Apostles to say: God has ordained some in the Church to be
Apostles, some Evangelists, and some Shepheardes and Teachers? Also Christ said
to Peter, Ioh. 21. 15
Feed my sheep, for he is the Pastor which feeds, and he is the teacher
which teaches. Peter therefore was a shepherd, although he fed none of his
own, but the sheep of Christ. But let us remember that they which are guided
by the spirit of God, they count that their own which belongs unto the head,
not to usurp power unto themselves, but faithfully to keep that which is
committed to his charge. For he which is truly joined unto Christ, will never
account that to be none of his own, which has been so dear unto him. Marl.
upon John. fol. 369.

Their shepherds, Ier. 50. 6
have caused them to go astray, etc. Their Governors and ministers by their
examples, have provoked them to Idolatry. Geneua.

Look. Nahum. 3. 18.

Woe be unto the shepherds of Israel that feed themselves: Eze. 34. 2
should not the shepherd feed the flock? By the Shepherds, he means the
Kings and Magistrates, A good shepherd
Priests and Prophets^ Ye seek to enrich your selves by their commodities, and
so spoil their riches and substance. But the office and duty of a good
shepherd is, to love and succor his flock, and not to be cruel toward them.
Eze. 34. 4.

The property of a good shepherd.
For now we live, 1. The. 3. 8
if we stand fast in the Lord. A good shepherd does always count the welfare
and prosperous estate of Christ's flock, to be his own. For while it goes well
with the congregation, it goes well with him also. But if he sees y^ church to
be in any peril or weakness, then he is werie of his own^ life, he can have no
joy. Who is weak says S. Paul, and I am not weak, who is offended, and I
burn not. This affection is not in them, that seek their own lucre, or their
own glory. Beza.

Of the restoring of good shepherds.
For I will deliver my sheep from their mouths, Exo. 34. 10
etc. By destroieng the covetous hirelings, and restoring true shepherds,
whereof we have a sign so often as God sends true preachers, which both by
doctrine and life, labor to feed his sheep in the pleasant pastures of his
word. Geneua.

Of the outward government of a foolish shepherd.
Take to thee yet the instrument of a foolish shepherd. za^ 11. 15
Signifieng y^ they shall have a certain kind of Regiment and outward show of
government: but in effect it should be nothing: for they should be wolves and
devouring beasts in steed of Shepherds. Geneua.

Of the sword that should come of the shepherds.
Arise O sword upon my shepherds, Za^. 13. 7
etc. The Prophet warns the Jews, that before this great comfort should rise
under Christ, there should be an horrible dissipacion among the people: for
their governors and Pastors should be destroyed, and the people should be as
scattered sheep: and the Evangelist applies this to Christ, because he was y^
head of all Pastors. Mat. 26. 31. Geneua.

Of four kind of shepherds.
One kind there is, that both teaches well and lives well, following the
examples of the Prophets, Apostles, and Christ himself. 4. kind of shepherds
Another kind there is, that teaches evil, and lives evil, and these pull
down the Temple of God with both hands. The third are they which teach well
and live evil, and these, what they build with their right hand, they pull it
down with the left, and are altogether like to the shipwright, that builded and
prepared the Ark of Noah for others to be saved, perished themselves. There is
also a fourth kind, that teaches evil, and lives well, and these through
hypocrisy do most harm of all. For when the people do gaze at the outward
appeara^nce of their conversation, they are easily drawn to embrace their
doctrine, etc. Hemmyng.

SHOW BREAD.
Wherefore it was called Show bread.
Show bread. Exo. 25. 30
Because it was ever in the sight of the Lord. T. M.

Objection.
David did eat of the Show bread, notwithstanding it was forbidden.

Answer.
He was forced thereto by extremity of famine. He never decreed, that it
should be lawful for all other to do the like.

Objection.
If it were necessary (as by the words of S. Hierom) y^ they which would eats
the Show bread should abstain from their wives, how much more is it
necessary, that they that eat the body of Christ daily as the Priests do,
should keep themselves chaste, and be altogether without wives? If they eating
of the figure do require such a cleanness from women, what shall the verity
of the thing it self do.

Answer.
God gave a commandment, that when the Paschall lamb should be eaten, the
Israelites should use no leauened bread by the space of 7. days, and that
whosoever did eat or keep any in his house all that while, his soul should
perish from among his people: now may I make mine argument after this manner:
If it was necessary, that they which did eat the paschall lamb should
abstain from leauened bread, not only when they did eat the Easter Lamb,
but also whole six days after: how much more is it requisite and necessary,
that they which do eat the Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, which
as ye say was figured, signified and represented, by the Paschall Lamb, should
abstain from leauened bread. Yea, how dare your Priests eat any leauened
bread at any time, since that they do eat and drink the body and blood of
Christ almost every day.

How the Lords death is showed.
As often as ye shall eat this bread and drink of this Cup, ye shall show the
Lords death, etc. The Lords death is not showed except both parts of the
Sacrament be ministered, and because in his death the blood was divided from the
body, it is necessary that the same division be represented in the supper,
otherwise the supper is not a showing of the Lords death. Latimer.

SHOE.
What Gods shoe is.
Over Edom will I stretch out my shoe. Augustine Psa. 107. 9.
Edom is ye earth. The Apostles feet be his shoes, for it is written: How
bewtifull are the feet of them which bring glad tidings of peace. He stretched
out his shoe upon the earth, when he sent them to preach to all creatures:
for their sound went into all lands, their words to the end of the world.

SHORT LIFE.
How short life is not a general rule of Gods indignation.
IT is a certain token (but no sure token) of Gods indignation, when a man is
snatched away with unripe death in his flourishing age. Then what shall we say
to the sentence written in the Book of Sapience. 4. chapter: Sap. 4. 11
The just man is snatched out of this world, that the malice of men and
wickedness of the world should not turn his mind, and least lyeng should
deceive his soul. And again, The righteous man what death soever he be
prevented withal, his soul shall go to rest. The Innocents that Herod did
murder for Christ's cause, and John Baptist whom he did behead, are the blessed
Martirs of Christ. This must needs be granted, y^ sometime God takes out of
this world the righteous only, because the world is not worthy to have them
among them, and sometime least the malice and lewd example of men should
turn their hearts to ungodliness. But now this taking away of righteous men
out the world, is not a rule nor an order general that God uses with men, but
it is only Per accidens, because that troublesome times are at hand, as of
famine, wars, and such others, and in such particular cases. It is true that
Christ said: Beati sterilis, etc. Happy are the barren and the wombes that
never bare, etc. And yet the rule general of all women is this: that fruit of
their womb is a blessing, and the contrary a woman to be barren, is a
displeasure, and a plague more grievous to them then poverty or hunger. Ric.
Turnar.

SICERA.
What kind of drink it was.
THis Sicera (as Hierom writes to Nepotianus) was a kind of drink, much like
unto wine, which was made either of Wheat, or of Apples, or of Dates, or else
of other fruits. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 202.

SICLE.
What a Sicle is.
A Sicle (as Josephus says) contained 4. drams of Athens. And a dran^ of
Athens (as Budens gathers in his book de ass.) contained 3. shillings of
Towers. A shilling of Towers is y^ half part of a Ba^se. Wherefore a dram was
as much in value, as a shilling of Argentine, that is, three half Batses, that
is four shillings. But there were two manner of Sicles, one was usual and
profane, and the other was of the Sanctuary. The holy sickle was double so
much as the profane. Wherefore Ezechiel in his. 45. chapter verse. 12. says,
that a profane sickle contains 20. half pence, but the sicle of the
Sanctuary. 40. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 238.

A Sicle was a piece of money, in value worth 4. grotes, equivalent with that
which is called Stater: whereof the half part of this sicle is two grotes,
that is to say, the 5. part of a French Crown as they went in France, as
very exactly declares the learned Master William Budns in his book, De Assi.
Marl. fol. 390.

A Sicle after the Hebrews is an Ounce: but after ye Greeks and Latins, it is
but the fourth part of an Ounce, and is contained. 12. Geras, as in Exo. 30.
13. which is ten pence sterling or thereabout. T. M.

Take 5. Sicles of every head. N^. 3. 47.
Sicles were of two sorts: the one common, the other belonging to the
Sanctuary, and that of the Sanctuary was double the weight of the common. The
common Sicle weighed two grotes, and the Sanctuary Sicle 4. The Scripture in
this place, and in the 30. of Exo. us, and Ezechiel forty and five, says that
the Sanctuary Sicle does weigh 20. Geras, which the Grecians do call. Obolus,
and we in English an half penny, when 8. grotes of our money was an ounce: and
the Hebrews do think, that Obolus does weigh the weight of 16. barley Corns.
The Bible note.

SICHEM.
What David means by the dividing of Sichem.
SIchem was the most richest and the most strongest City in all the Tribe of
Ephraim, Psalm. 60. 6
whereof Isboseth was king and over all Israel beside. The Tribe of Judah only
except, which stuck unto David. Now where the Prophet does prophecy, and make
his bost in God, saying: Dominus loquutus est e sanctuario suo, laetabor and
diuidam Sichem. The Lord has spoken it out of his holy place, I will rejoice
and divide Sichem, is no more to say, but that David should conquer Sichem and
be king thereof, and divide it and lot it as Joshua did, and as all conquerours
do when they conquer any country or land. And as David should conquer
Sichem, so was it said, that he should meat out y^ valley of Sucoth, for
David rejoicing before hand of Gods goodness toward him, says: Ego vallem
s^coth demetiar. It is not Isboseth that shall long continue king of sucoth,
but it is I whom the Lord has appointed to be king of sucoth, and as I have
now said of sichem and sucoth, so will I say of Galaad and Manasses: Meus est
Galaad, and meus est Manasses: Galaad is mine and Manasses is mine. And to know
what Sucoth, Galaad, and Manasses were, ye shall understand that sucoth was a
vale nigh unto the city of sichem in the land of Canaan. In the which vale
Jacob pitched his tents, after he had met his brother Esau and was departed
from him. And of his pitching his tents there, the va^le had this name sucoth
given him: for Sucoth by interpretation and turning of the word into Latin, is
as much to say as Tabernacula. Galaad was the name of a little hillocke, as we
read in Genesis 31. When Jacob fled away sodeinly and privily from Laban his
father in law, with his wives Lea and Rachel. Then at the end of seven days
journey, Laban ouertooke Jacob in mount Galaad, where he reproved him, not
only of running away deceitfully, but also of theft, which when he could not
prove, Laban cooled himself, and so did shake hands with Jacob. And in witness
of friendship and of unfeigned reconciliation, Jacob with his own hand set up a
stone in title and remembrance of their true reconcilement, and commanded his
men to fetch so many stones as made a great heap, which ^ea^ is called in
Hebrew Galaad: Tumulum testimonij, vel aceruum testimonij. The heap of
witness: Such Galaads has been seen in England, which (as old men say) were
made in token of a man murdered there. So that every such like hillock of
stones may be called galaad. But y^ Galaad whereof the Prophet speaks when he
says, Meus est Galaad, Galaad is mine, is called Iabes Galaad, which was the
chiefest city of all the tribe of Gad: And a people y^ showed great courtesy in
the burieng of king Saul, for the which David commended them highly. And these
Galaadites being yet under the dominion of Isboseth, the Prophet says, Meus
est Galaad, Galaad is mine. Also by Manasses, ye shall not understand the king
of Judah, some to Ezechias, neither Manasses the son of Joseph: but when the
Prophet says: Meus est Manasses, Manasses is mine, understand ye all the land
that lies beyond Iordane, which Joshua ga^e to the half tribe of Manasses, and
was now also under the dominion of Isboseth. Ric. Turnar.

SIGG A ^O^N.
What it is.
THE Hebrew interpreters agree not among themselves upon this word ( Sigga^o^)
for some take it for an instrument of music: unto some it seems a note to
sing a song by. Other some think it to be, the beginning of some common
caroll, according to the time, whereof David's will was, to have this psalm
song: And other interpret y^ Hebrew word to signify delightfulness. In my
judgment (says Calvin) the second opinion seems most allowable, namely
that it was some certain kind of tune or song: as if a man would term it a
Saphicke or Phalentian verse. Howbeit I force not a matter of ^o light
importance. Call. upon the Psalm.

Siggaion is taken to be a beginning of a song, after whose tune this Psalm
was sung. The Bible note.

SIGN.
What a sign is.
THat is called a sign, which besides the form which it offers unto ye
se^ses, brings some other thing into our knowledge. And a sign (as Augustine
writes, and the Master of the Sentences affirms) is divided into a natural
sign, and a sign given. Smoke is a natural sign of fire, and clouds a
natural sign of rain: but a sign given, and appointed of the will, is
diverse, as letters, words, iestures, beckes, and many such like: And these
signs may perteine to diverse and sundry senses, but things that are
signified, are either things past, things present, or things to come. Pet.
Mar. upon the Romans fol. 79.

As well the Greek word ( Sureion) as the Latin word Signum^ does sufficiently
declare, that those things and dooinges be called signs, which do signify
some thing. For it cannot be a sign where there is no signification. Therefore
whether y^ the whole things do by sight and use thereof signify any thing, and
whether it be added to any thing, as some mark to be for a knowledge, it is
aright called a sign. Augustine defines a sign in this wise: A sign is a
thing, which besides the matter that it presents to the senses, does make
some other thing thereby to come into our thought: as when we see a footestep,
we do think that the beast whose step it is, has passed there: And when we
see smoke we know that there is fire: And by hearing the voice of a beast, we
understand the affectition of the mind: And at the sound of a trumpet, the
soldiers do know that they must either march or retire, according to the
matter that the battle requires, this says he. Musculus. fol. 271.

How a sign is not both the sign and the thing signified.
For even this day we have received visible food: but the Sacrament is one
thing, and the virtue of the Sacrament is another thing. Augustine
August. in John. Tract. 29.

Again, all doctrine is either of things or of the signs of things: but
things are learned by signs. Augustine
By this it appears, that Austens judgment was not, that a sign could^ be
the same thing whereof it is a sign. Aug. de doctri. Christi. li. 1. cap. 1.

Whatsoever things be such as they are called, by having relation to other
things then they be themselves, cannot be those things whereunto they have
relation. But ouery thing that is called a sign, is so by the relation that it
has to the thing that it signifies: Ergo no signs can be the same things
that they do signify. And therefore the Sacrament of Christ's body and blood
being a sign thereof cannot be the thing it self. Crowley.

Look. Sacrament.

SILENCE.
What is meant by this word Silence.
AND there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. Apoc. 8. 1.
This silence shall endure but half an hour space which may be, the thousand
years that are spoken of here before, considering that all the age after Christ
is but the last hour. And a thousand before God are but as the day before
past. In the time of this sweet silence, shall Israel be received, the Jews
shall ^ee converted, the Heathen shall come in again, Christ will seek out
his lost sheep, and bring him again to his fold, that they may appear one
flock, like as they have one Shepherd. Bale upon the Apoc. Fol. 109.

Look. Hour.

SILOH.
What Siloh is.
SIloh after some is as much to say, as sent, and after some happy, and after
some it signifies Messiah, that is to say, anointed, and that we call Christ
after the Greek word, and it is a prophecy of Christ: for after all the other
Tribes were in captivity, and their kingdom destroyed, yet the Tribe of Judah
had a ruler of the same blood, even unto the coming of Christ, and about the
coming of Christ, the Romans conquered them, and the Emperor gave the
kingdom of the tribe of Judah unto Herod, which was a stranger even an
Edomite of the generation of Esau. Tindale.

The meaning of this place following.
Go wash thee in the poole of Siloh. John. 9. 7.
He commands to wash in the poole of Siloh, peradventure, to cast the Jews
in the teeth with this, that they themselves were in the fault that they felt
not the present power of God. Even as also the Prophet Esaias reproves the men
in his time, for that they refused the soft running water of Siloh, and desired
the strong and mighty rivers. And this also seems to be the cause why
Elizeu^ commanded Naaman the Sirian to wash in Iordane. The poole of Siloh was
at the foot of mount Syon, which did not break and spring forth continually,
but only at cert^ine hours, and on certain days, and came through certain
holes and gutters of the hard rock, with a great roaring noise, etc. Marl.
upon John. fol. 338.

Of the soft running waters of Siloh.
Because the people has refused the waters of Siloh that run softly. Esaias.
8. 6.
Which was a fountain at the foot of mount Syon, out of ye which ran a small
river through the citie^ meaning that they of Judah distrusting their own power
which was small, desired such power and riches as they saw in Sytia and
Israel. Geneua.

Look. Water.

How that by Siloh Christ is meant.
The Scepter shall not depart from Judah, Ge. 49. 10.
etc. until Siloh come. Which is Christ the Messiah, the giver of all
prosperity, who shall call the Gentiles to salvation. Geneua.

The Scepter shall not be taken away from Judah, till Siloh come, that is to
say, the seed of a woman, which is Christ the Lord Hemmyng.

Of the tower of Siloh.
Upon whom the tower of Siloh fell. Luke. 13. 4
To wit, in the place or river: for Siloh was a small river, from which the
conduits of the city came, whereof John. 9. 7. Esaias. 8. 6. and therefore it
was a tower of castle built upon the Conduit side, which fell down sodeinly
and killed some. Beza.

SILVER.
What it is to turn silver into dross.
THy silver is turned into dross, Esa. ^. 21.
etc. To turn silver into dross, and to mix wine with water, is deprave the
heavenly word of God, and to corrupt the pure judgment thereof for covetous
sake, which thing was used in Paul's time, as ye may see. 2. Cor. 4. 2. much
more now be ye sure. T. M.

Whatsoever was pure in thee before, is now corrupt, though thou have an
outward show. Geneua.

What a siluerling is.
And found it fifty thousand siluerlings. Act. 19. 1^
These siluerlings, which we now call pence, the Jews call sicles, and are
worth ten pence sterling a piece, which sum mounteth to, of our money, about.
2000. Marks.

SIMON MAGVS.
Of his heretical opinions, and of his end.
SImon Magus the forcerer being a Samaritane of the village Gitton, was
baptized by Philip The Deacon in Samaria, he would have bought of Peter the
gift of the holy Ghost. Of him rose the word Simonie. Act. 8. Euse. l^. 2. cap.
1. He came to Rome in the time of Claudius, he called himself a God, he was
honored there with a picture, having this superscription, Simoni Deo sancto.
He had to his yoke mate one Helen, who^ Ireneus calls Selen, a witch and a
common ha^lot, whom he called the principal understanding. Euse. li. 2.
chap. 12. 13. 14. He said unto the Samaritanes that he was the Father unto the
Jews, that he was the son descended from heaven, unto the Gentiles, that he
was the holy Ghost. Ireneus. li. 1. cap. 20. Epipha. li. 1. Tom. 2. heraes. 21.
Peter foiled him in Samaria, where for shame he fled, and leaving Samaria and
Judea, he sailed from East to West, thinking to live at his hearts ease, and
came to Rome under Claudius, where Peter also being sent no doubt by the holy
Ghost met him. Euse. Eccle. hist. li. 2. chapter. 14. 15. Peter had much to do
with him in the presence of Nero, as Anton. Chron. writes. He had three
conflicts with him. In the end Simon seeing himself foiled, and his witchcraft
prevailing not at all, told them he would leave their City and fly up into
the heavens whence he came: wherefore upon a certain day appointed, he
climed up into the high Capitol, whence he took his flight by the means of
his witchcraft, and the spirits which bore him in the air, the people at the
sight here of were amazed. But Peter fell down and prayed unto God that his
witchcraft might be revealed unto the world. He had no sooner prayed, but down
comes Simon Magus, and bruised himself in pieces, so that thereby he dyed
miserablye. Abdias Babylon. Apost. hist. li. 1. Aegisip. li. 3. chap. 2.

Of Simon Chananeus the Apostle.
Simon called Chananeus, which was brother to Jude and to James the younger,
Mat. 10. 4
which all were the sons of Marye Cleopha and of Alpheus, was Bishop of
Jerusalem after James, and was crucified in a City of Egypt, in the time of
Traianus the Emperor, as Dorotheus records, but Abdias writes that he with
his brother Jude, were both ^laine by a tumult of the people in Suanier, a
City of Persidis. In the book of Mar. fol. 52.

SIMPLE.
Who are simple.
HE is simple that is without craft or ^eceit, and continues in believing and
executing of Gods will. Jacob was called a simple man. Genesis 25. 27.

SINAGOGVE.
What a Sinagogue is.
ACcording to the Greek word it is called a Sinagogue, Mat. 4. 23.
and to the Latin word, a place for the people to assemble together, to hear
divine matters: by the which name also, the places for the assembly of the
ecclesiastical persons are called. Marl. upon Math.

Sinag^gues are thought of certain to be convenient places of resort, Math. 6.

erected in the streets or market place. To other, it seems to be an
ecclesiastical place of resort, whereunto the people come to hear the word of
God. Marl.

SINGING.
The meaning of these two places following.
BE not filled with wine wherein is wantonness, Ephe. 5. 1^
but be ye filled with the spirit, speaking to your selves in Psalms, hymns,
and spiritual songs, singing in your hearts, giving thanks always unto God for
all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. To Wine^ y^ Apostle sets
the spirit as contrary, and forbids the pleasure of the senses, when in
steed of wine he will have Christians filled with the spirit, for in Wine (as
he says) is wantonness, but in the spirit is both a true and perfect joy.
Dronkards speak more then enough, but yet foolish and vain things: Speak ye
says he, but yet spiritual things, and that not only in voice, but also in
heart, for the voice sounds in vain, where the mind is not affected, they
which be filled with wine, do speak foolish, filthy, and blasphemous things,
but give ye thanks to God always (I say) and for all things.

Let the word of the Lord abound plenteously in you, Coll. 3. 16
teach and admonish ye one another, in Psalms, Hymns, and spiritual songs,
singing in your hearts with grace. By these words Paul expresses two
things, first that our songs be the word of God, which must abound
plenteously in us, and they must not serve only to giving of thanks, but also
to teach and admonish. And then it is added with grace, which is thus to
understand, as though he should have said aptlye and properlye both to the
senses and to measures, and also unto the voices. Let them not sing rude and
rusticall things, neither let it be immoderatly, as do the Tavern hunters. To
the Corinthians, where he entreats of an holy assembly, the same Apostle
writes after this manner. When ye assemble together according as every one of
you has a Psalm, or has doctrine, or has tongue, or has revelation, or
has interpretation, let all things be done unto edifieng. By which words is
declared that singers of songs and Psalms, had their place in the Church.
Pet. Mart. upon Iudic. fol. 102. 103.

Who brought singing first into the West Church.
Saint Austen in his book of Confessions testifies that singing in the west
Church happened in the time of Ambrose. Ambrose^
For when that holy man together with the people, watched even in the Church,
least he should have been betrayed unto the A^ans, he brought in singing to
avoid tediousness, and to drive away the time.

The judgment of diverse learned men concerning singing.
Franciscus Petrarcha in his book De remedijs vtriusque fortunae, Franciscus
Petrarcha
declares that S. Athanasius did utterly forbid singing to be used in the
Church at service time, because (says he) he would put away all lightness
and vanity, which by the reason of singing does oftentimes arise in the
minds, both of the singers and of the hearers.

We ought (says S. Hierome) to sing, to make melodye, and to praise the Lord
rather in mind, Hiero. in ^pist. ad Ephesians. ca. 5
then in voice. And this it is that is said: Singing and making melody to the
Lord in your hearts. Let young men, says he, hear these things, yea, let the^
hear whose office it is to sing in the Church, that they must sing to God, not
in the voice, but in the heart: neither must their throat be anointed after
the manner of game plaiers with sweet ointments, that in the church singing
more sit for gameplayers should be heard: but in fear, in work, in knowledge
of the Scriptures ought they to sing in the Lord. Let the voice of the singer
so sing, that not the voice of him y^ sings, but the words that are read may
delight.

It is without doubt says Saint Ambrose, ^. Am. li. de Cain and Abel.
a great incrudelitie and unfaithfulness to think thus of the power of God,
that thou can not be heard, except thou criest out: Let thy work cry: let
thy faith cry: let thy mind cry: let thy passions and sufferings cry: let thy
blood as ye blood of holy Abel cry: whereof God said to Cain: the voice of thy
brothers blood cries unto me. For he hears in secret, which makes clean in
secret. We cannot hear man except he speaks unto us, but unto God, not words
but thoughts do speak.

Guilhelmus Durandus says, Durand.
that the use of singing was ordained for carnal and fleshly men, and not for
spiritual and godly minded men. Rat. Di. Off.

Saint Gregory did greatly disalow certain deacons of Rome in his time, Grego.
in regi. part. 5. cap. 44.
which when they ought by their office to have given their minds to the
preaching of the Gospel and the provision for the poor, set all their
pleasure on pleasant singing, not caring how they lived before God, so that
with their voices they might please the world. He was therefore compelled to
make a decree, that all such as be in the holy ministry should from thence
forth, under the pain of excommunication give their minds no more to singing,
but apply themselves to the studies of the holy Scriptures, and the reading of
the Gospel.

S. John Chrysostom says on this manner: It is the duty of a devout mind to
pray to God, Chri. Ho. 44. de. loa^ ct Paul. Festo.
not with the voice, or with the sound of the voice, but with the devotion of
the mind, and with the faith of the heart. Again he says, the crieng of the
voice is not the work in prayer unto God, whom we know that he beholds the
secrets of the heart: but the crieng of faith and the devotion of a godly and
pure mind. Therefore the best way to pray, is to pray with heart, mind, spirit,
soul and inward man.

Erasmus Roterodamus expresses his mind concerning the curious manner of
singing used in Churches; Eras. Rot. in Anno. 1 Cor. cap. 14.
on this wise, and ^aith: Why does the Church doubt to follow so worthy an
author ( Paul)? Yea, how dare it be bold, to descent from him? What other
thing is heard in Monestaries, in Colleges, in Temples almost generally, then
a confused noise of voices, but in the time of Paul there was no singing, but
saying only. Singing was with great difficulty received of them of the latter
time: and yet such singing as was none other thing then a distinct and plain
pronunciation, even such as we have yet among us, when we sound the Lords
prayer in the holy Canon: And the tongue wherein these things were sung, the
common people did then understand, and answered, Amen. Now what other thing
does the common people hear then voices signifieng nothing? And such for the
most part is the pronunciation, that not so much as the words or voices are
heard, only the sound beats the ears.

When plain song, prick-song, and descant, were brought into the Church.
Pope Gelasius, Plain-so^g
Pope Gregory the first, S. Ambrose, with other, brought in first of all the
plain song into the Churches. Antonius. Guil. Durand.

Pope Vitalian being a lusty singer and a fresh courageous Musition himself,
Prick-so^g Descant, Organs
brought into the Church prick song, Descant, and all kind of sweet and
pleasant melody, and because nothing should want to delight, the vain,
foolish, and idle ears of fond and fantastical men, he joined the Organs to
the curious musikell. Thus was Paul's preaching and Peter's praieng turned into
vain singing and childish plaieng, unto the great loss of time, and to the
utter undoing of christen men's souls, which live not by singing and piping,
but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God. Math. 44
In the year, etc. 653. Theo. Basil in his. b. of Relics.

SINGLE LIFE.
What the fruits of single life among the Priests are.
NOt only they do not that they teach, Origin
but also cruelly and without mercy they lay their iniu^ctions upon others, not
considering each man's ability. Such be they that forbid men to marry: And
from that thing that is lawfully to be done, drive and force men to an
unreasonable purity. They bind and lay on heavy burdens, and cause men to
fall under them. And often time we see them that teach such things to do
contrary to their own saiengs. They teach chastity, and yet keep no
chastity. They do all things for the commendation of men and vaineglory, that
they may be seen and noted of the people. And commonly they be such as love
the highest places at feasts and bankets, and to be saluted and honored in the
market places, and of the people to be called Rabby, that will be called
Bishops Priests, and Deacons. Origin in Mat. tract. 24.

They refuse marriage, Epihanius
but not lust or pleasure. For they esteem not chastity, but hypocrisy: and
yet the same hypocrisy, they will have called chastity. Epiphan. contra
Origin. heraef. 42.

Chrysostom Chrisosto^
writes of the vowed and chaste women in his time, saying: we may say (says
he) that marriage is a great deal better (then such virginity) hereafter, it
were better there were no virgins at all. The name (of virginity) continues
still, but virginity it self in their bodies is quite gone. They live more in
pleasure, then harlots in the stews. There is often and daily running for
midwiues to virgins houses. This manner of virginity of women amongst men, is
more reproved of all men, then fornication it self.

False Prophets, false Apostles, and false Priests sprang up, which under a
counterfeit religion deceived the people, Auentinus in Hildibrando
the most part of them under the honest name of chastity, commit whooredome,
adultery, incest, commonly and without punishment.

The Bishops and Priests of this time, how do they endeavor to keep, Barnard
either in heart or in hody the holiness of chastity, without which no man
shall see God: They are given over into a reprobate mind, and do those things
that are not convenient: for it were shame to utter what these Bishops do in
secret. Again he says: absteining from the remedy of marriage, afterward they
flow over into all kind of wickedness. Again, such notorious filthynesse of
lechery there is in many parts of the world, not only in the inferior
Clerks, but also in Priests, yea, in the greatest Prelates, which thing is
horrible to be heard. Bar. de conuers. ad cleri. chap. 19. in open. triperti.
li. 3. cha. 7.

Huldericus the Bishop of Augusta in Germany, wrote sharply against Pope
Nicholas in this wise: Hulderi Epi. Aug.
I have found thy decrees touching the single life of Priests, to be void of
discreation, thou see that many followers of thy counsel willing under a
feined color of contine^t life, rather to please man then God, commit heinous
acts: in the end he concludes thus: by such discipline of discretion as you
know best, root this Pharesaicall doctrine out of Gods fold.

I believe it were a good law, and for the wealth and safety of souls,
Pauermitanus extra de cle. coniug. cum olim
that such as cannot live chaste, may contract matrimony. For we learn by
experience, that of the law of continence or single life, the contrary effect
has followed: for as much as now a days they live not spiritually nor be
clean and chaste, but with their great sins are defiled with unlawful
copulation, whereas with their own wives they should live chastely. Therefore
the Church ought to do as the skillful Physician uses to do, who if he see
by experience that his medicine hurts, rather then does good, takes it
clean away. And would to God the same way were taken with all positive
constitutions.

SIN.
The definition of sin.
SAint Augustine Augustine
in his 2. book De consensu Euangelistarum says: Sin is the transgression
of the law. Ad simpliciatum li. 1. Sin is an inordinatenesse or perverseness
of man, that is, a turning from the more excellent creator, and a turning to ye
inferior creatures. De fide contra Manichaeus. cap. 8. he says: What is it
else to sin but to err in the precepts of truth, or in the truth it self.
Again Contra Faustu^ Manicheu^ li. 22. ca. 27. Sin is a deed, a word or a wish
against ye law of God. The same Augustine De duobus animabus contra Manichaeus.
ca. 11 says: Sin is a will to retain or obtain ye which justice forbids,
and is not free to abstain. And in Retract. li. 1. cap. 5. he says: That will
is a motion of the mind with copulation, either not to loose or else to
obtain some one thing or other. All which definitions as I do not utterly
reject (says Bullinger) so do I wish this to be considered and thought of with
the rest: Sin is the natural corruption of mankind, and the action which
arises of it contrary to ye law of God, whose wrath, that is both death, and
sundry punishments it brings upon us. Bullinger. fo. 478.

What sin is.
Sin in ye scripture is not called ye outward work only committed by the body,
but all the whole business, and whatsoever acompanieth, moves or stirs unto
the outward deed, and that whence the works spring, as unbelief, pronenesse
and readiness unto the deed in ye ground of the heart, with all his powers,
affections, and appetites, wherewith we can but sin. So that we say ye a man
the^ sins, when he is carried away headlong into sin, altogether as much
as he is, of that poison, inclination and corrupt nature, wherein he was
conceived and borne: for there is none outward sin committed, except a man be
carried away altogether, with life, soul, heart, body, lust and mind
thereunto. The Scripture looks singularly unto the heart, and unto ye race and
original fountain of all sin, which is unbelief in ye bottom of the heart:
Sin in Scripture is called unbelief
for as faith only justifies and brings the spirit and lust unto outward
good works: even so unbelief only damneth, and keeps out the spirit, and
provoke the flesh, and stirs up lust unto evil outward works, as it
fortuned to Adam and Eve in Paradise. Ge. 3. For this cause Christ calls sin,
unbelief, and that notably in the. 16. of John. The spirit (says he) shall
rebuke the world of sin, because they believe not in me. Wherefore then
before all good works, there must needs he faith in the heart, whence they
spring. And before all bad deeds and bad fruits, there must needs be unbelief
in y^ heart, as in the root, fountain, pith, and strength of all sin, which
unbelief is called the head of the Serpent, and of the old dragon, which the
woman's seed Christ, must tread under foot, as it was promised to Adam.
Tindale in his Pro. to the Romans

How every sin is mortal.
That every sin is mortal in that it is sin, is evident by the words of
God himself (who can best judge in this matter.) In the. 18. of Ezechiel,
verse. 4. saying thus: The soul that sins shall dye, here is no exception
or difference made of sin, but any sin in that it is sin is deadly: as
Saint Paul says. Rom 6. 23. For the reward of sin is death. Here also you
see that Saint Paul makes no difference of sin, but that Mors, death, is
the reward of sin generally without exception. And Saint John says: Every
one that commits sin, the same also commits iniquity, and sin is
iniquity. Here also you see that Saint John says, (making no difference of
sin) that sin in that it is sin, it is iniquity, without exception.
Christ says, that out of the heart proceeds evil thoughts, Mat. 15. 19
murders, adulteryes, etc. And again he says, That whosoever beholds an
other man's wife, to lust after her, Mat. 5. 28
has already committed adulterye with her in his heart. And Saint John
following his master like a good scholar, says thus: 1^ Ioh. 3. 15
Omnis qui odit, etc. Whosoever hates his brother is a murderer. So it is
evident by the sacred Scriptures that all sins without exception are mortal
and deadly. I. Gough.

The Doctors saying in this matter.
There were also before Christ worthy men, both Prophets and Priests, Cipri. in
his ser. de l^iun.
but yet conceived and borne in sin. Neither were they free from original and
actual sin. And there was found in them all, either ignorance or
insufficiency, in which they going astray have sinned, and have needed the
mercy of God. By the which being taught and instructed have given thanks to
God, and have confessed themselves to have lacked much of the full measure of
righteousness and trusting in God, have not presumed to ascribe unto
themselves any society or righteousness of their own.

No man can be without sin, so long as he is laden with the garment of the
flesh, Lacta^tius
the weakness whereof is three manner of ways brought in thraldom and
subjection of sin, to wit, by deeds, thoughts, and by words. Lact. in his. 6.
b. de ver. cul. ca. 13. We may so long as we dwell in the tabernacle of this
body, and are compassed about with frail flesh, Hierome.
measurably rule our affections and passions, but cut them off quite, we cannot
by any means. Hierom. in his Epist. ad Algasis.

It is to be demanded, Augustine
if the nature of man be good, which none dare be so bold to deny but Manicheus
and Marcion. How then is it good if it be not possible for it to be without
evil? For that all sin is evil, who doubts: we answer both that the
nature of man is good, etc. See the place. August. de. per. just. li.

Whereupon S. Gregory Gregory.
says, he that gathers virtue together without humility, is as one that
hears dust into ye wind. For like as dust with a mighty blast of wind is
scattered abroad, so every good thing without humility is with ye wind of
vaineglorie dispearsed as^nder. And also it is much better to be an humble
sinner the^ to be a righteous man and arrogant. Which thing is plainly set
forth by the Lord, as the Publican and Pharesie are brought in for example: as
a certain wise man says: Better is in wicked deeds an humble confession,
then in good deeds a proud boasting. Gregory de donis spiri. sanct. cap. 2.

How God ordained sin, and yet is not the Author of sin.
To ordeine a thing and to be the proper cause, God is not ye author of sin.
author and worker of a thing is not all one, as by these examples following.

He that sets his wine abroad in the Sun to make vinegar, ordained it to
be made vinegar, and yet he is not the proper cause of vinegar, but the nature
of the wine and the hot Sun beams.

He that in Spain cutteth down grapes in the Summer, and lays them in a
Sunny place, ordeineth them to be made raisons, and yet he is not the proper
cause of raisons, but the nature of the grapes, and the heat of the Sun.

Finally to bring a plain rusticall example, he y^ hangs up Swines flesh in
a chimney, ordeineth it to be made Bacon, and yet he is not the proper cause of
Ba(...), but the nature of the flesh and smoke. Wherefore since it is evident
y^ it is not ever all one to ordeine a thing and to be the proper cause and
author of a thing, we may boldly say the scripture bearing plain record, and
S. Austen and sundry other most excellent writers holds up their hands to the
same, that God ordeineth sin, and yet is not the author of sin. Trahero^.

The cause of sin is not to be laid unto God.
God compels no man to do evil, but every man willingly sins, Cause of
sin.
wherefore the cause of sin is not to be laid on him. For seeing he
procreateth not in us wicked desires, he ought not to bear the blame if wicked
actions do spring out of a corrupt (...) of wicked affections: yea, the
goodness of God is rather to be acknowledged which is present, and so
governs the wicked affections that they cannot burst forth nor be hurtful
nor troublesome to any, but when he has appointed to chastin some, and to call
them back to repentance, or to punish them. Pet. Mart. upon Iudic. fol. 167.

How all sin is both deadly and venial.
We say that all sin in that it is sin is deadly. And yet we say again,
that there is not any one sin, but that the same is both deadly and venial.
Deadly if the offender repent not, venial, if the same be unfeignedly repented,
and by mercy craved at the hands of God in the blood of Christ. Venial sin
For the same God that said in Ezechiel, Anima, etc. The soul that sins
shall dye, says also in the same Chapter: And when the wicked man turns away
from his wickedness, that he has done, and does the thing which is equal and
right, he shall save his soul alive. Here you see like as all sin, in that it
is sin, is deadly: So again all sin in that it is unfeignedly repented, is
also venial. I. Gough.

How sin is not of Gods creation in man.
Whereas sin is in man's nature, it is not of Gods putting in by creation, but
by reason that Satan did spread his naughtiness farther abroad at such time as
man was beguiled by his wiliness, to disapoint the benefit of God, etc. Call.
upon Job. fol. 16.

How sin entered into the world.
As by one man sin entered into the world, and death by the means of sin,
Romans 5. 12
etc. Sin is here taken for the natural inclination or readiness to sin,
which some do call (rightwell) the original coruption of man, which though it
be ^id in man's heart, and declar^ not it self unto the manifest works of
wickedness, How sin entered.
yet it is able to condemn all men, only they being excepted whom faith in
Jesus Christ does save. This original corruption does manifest it self first
by wicked and unclean thoughts: Second by consenting unto the concupisence or
thoughts. Thirdly by committing the deed or fact. Sir. I. Cheek.

But sin is not imputed so long as there is no law. Though man imputes not
sin where there is no law, yet it follows not, that God which from the
beginning has written in men's hearts the law of nature, does impute no sin.
For since that death (which is the punishment of sin) did reign over all men
even from Adam, it is evident that sin was imp^ted. Sir. I. Cheek.

How Christ is called sin.
Whereas Christ is called sin, Augustine
it might be understood says Saint Augustine that he was the sacrifice for
sin. For Christ was without sin, 2. Cor. 5. 21
as S. Paul says: He has made him sin for us, Romans 8. ^
which knew no sin. And again, God sent his Son, in the similitude of
sinful flesh, and not in sinful flesh.

How no man can pardon sins, but Christ.
Son, be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee. The same moved the
Scribes, Mat. 9. ^
that sin should be pardoned by a man, for they regarded and beheld nothing
in Jesus Christ, but manhood, and that the law could not release that, which
was pardoned of him, for only faith justifies: and afterward the Lord
beheld inwardly their murmuring and said, that it was easy for the Son of
man to pardon sins in earth, but nevertheless, none can pardon sins but God
only: wherefore he that does pardon them is God, for none can pardon but God.
Hill. upon S. Matthew in the 9. Canon.

To sin against the Holy ghost, what it is.
But whosoever shall speak against the Holy ghost, etc. To persevere and
continue in sin of infidelity, Mat. 12. 3^
to kick against the manifest and known truth, Sin against the Holy ghost.
and so to dye without repentance with a despair of the mercy of God in
Jesus Christ, is to sin against the Holy ghost. Sir. I. Cheek.

But whosoever, etc. That is, he that strives against the truth which he
knows, and against his own conscience, cannot return to repentance, for
he sins against the Holy ghost. Geneua.

He resists the Holy ghost, which openly repugneth against the verity of
God, and by despite enforces himself as much as he can to overthrow it. Now a
man may sin willyngly, and yet be not in will to war against God, or to
blaspheme his holy word. Calvin.

It is named the sin of the Holy ghost, not against the godhead of the Holy
ghost: for the same God is also father and son: nor against the person of the
Holy ghost, for it is no greater then the person of the Father and of the
Son: but it is to sin against the graces of the spirit within us, and so
to sin against them, that we contemn and despise them, tread them under
feet, account them prophane^ and maliciously carry them away to all
wantonness. This then is sin against the Holy ghost. In a continual
Apostacy, and general falling from God, to sin against thine own
conscience, so that thou despise the graces of God, which he had given thee, to
the setting forth of his praise, and turn them to the contempt of his
majesty and glory. By the example of Satan, and the Angels that fell from
heaven: by Ca^ that flew his brother: by the Scribes and Pharesies against
Christ, Iulianus.
and Iulianus the Emperor: and that is written before, it appears that the
sin of the Holy ghost is a general Apostacy from God, with wilful
malicious unrepentant heart, to persecute the truth unto the end. As many as
do fear at the remembrance of this sin, The fear
they are as far from it as the East is from the West, for this sin is a
mocking and scoffing of the Son of God, it is not a weeping and mourning.
Deering.

When covetousness finds advantage in serving falsehood, it rises up in an
obstinate malice against the truth and seeke^h all means to resist it, this
is sin against the Holy ghost. As (by example) Balaam the false prophet,
though he wi(...) that God loved Israel and had blessed them, Balaam
and promised them great things and that he would fulfill his promise, yet for
covetousness and desire of honor, fell into such malice against the truth of
God, that he sought how to resist and to curse the people.

Christ says, It shall never be forgiven here, nor in y^ world to come: that
is, that as the sin shall be punished with everlasting damnation, in the life
to come: even so shall it not escape vengeance here, as thou see in Judas,
Pharao, and in Balaam, and in all other Tyrants, which against their
consciences resisted the open truth of God.

The cause why it shall not be forgiven is, for that the offender cannot
repent, but is utterly shut out from repentance, and has his heart hardened:
for if he were able to repent, he should be pardoned, because that by
repentance and faith, all things are washed away.

Wherefore the Holy ghost will rebuke the world of sin.
Of sin, because they believe not in me. Unbeleefe is that sin that
condemns the world, by the world, Ioh. 16. 10
understand the wicked, the world rebuked of sin
reproved and unfaithful, and not all the creatures that be in the world, and
faith is the righteousness of believers. This thing because the world and
natural reason will not know, but will be justified and saved by their own
works, is even it, whereof the Holy ghost shall rebuke the world, and show that
it shall be justly condemned. Tindale.

Of sin, etc. His enemies which contemned him, and put him to death, shall be
convict by their own conscience, for that they did not believe in him. Act. 2.
27. And shall know that without Jesus Christ, there is nothing but sin.
Geneua.

How sin is taken in this place following.
And by sin condemned sin in the flesh. Romans 8. 4.
Sin is here taken for a sin offering, after the use of the Hebrew tongue.
Tindale.

God through the sacrifice of sin, which Christ his only son offered upon
the Cross in his flesh, and abolished sin, which reigned in our mortal
bodies. The Bible note.

Of sin unto death, how it is declared.
There is a sin unto death, and for it I say not that thou should pray. 1.
Ioh. 5. 16
Whatsoever sin we see in the world, let us pray and not despair, Sin unto
death.
for God is the God of mercy. But for the sin to death, which is resisting
grace, and fighting against mercy, and open blaspheming of the Holy ghost,
affirming y^ Christ's miracle^ are done in Belzabub, and his doctrine to be of
the devil, I think no Christen man, if he perceive it, can otherwise pray,
then as Paul prayed for Alexander the Coppersmith, the 2. to Timothy, the
last, that God would reward him according to his works. They that go back
again after they know the truth, and give themselves willingly to sin, for
to follow it, and persecute the doctrine of truth by profession to maintain
falsehood, for their glory and vauntage, are remediles, as ye may see. Heb. 6.
and 10. Balaam so sinned, the false Prophets in ye old Testament so sinned,
the Pharesies so sinned, Alexander so sinned: and now many so sin, following
their pride and covetousness. Tindale.

What this sin unto death is, our Savior Christ does sufficiently declare,
saying: If ye will not believe, ye shall dye in your own sins. So that this
sin unto death, is nothing else but a wilful and obstinate infidelity, this
sin no man that is borne of God does commit, though of frailenesse we be
subject to sin, as long as we live. Sir. I. Cheek.

If we sin willingly after we have received y^ knowledge of the truth. Heb.
10. 26
This is the sin, whereof is spoken. Mat. 12. 31. that is the sin of
blasphemy against the Holy ghost, which sin John calls, the sin unto
death. 1. John. 5. 16.

They sin willingly, which of set purpose and malice, does withhold the
truth in unrighteousness and lying, To sin willingly.
which know that in all the world there is no other Sacrifice for sin, but
that only Omnisufficient sacrifice of Christ's death, and yet they will not
commit themselves unto it, but rather despise it, and abide still obstinately
in their wickedness and sins, unto such remains a most horrible and
dreadful judgment. Sir. I. Cheek.

For it is not possible that they which were once lightened, Heb. 6 4
and have tasted. This text denies not impossibility of mercy in God, but
the impossibility of repentance in such men as mal^tiously forsake the truth,
blaspheme Christ, and take part against the Holy ghost. For the truth is, that
with the Lord there is mercy and plenteous redemption. Psa. 130. 7. So that
whosoever calls upon his name shall be saved. Joel. 2. 31. To. 10. 13. Now,
they that forsake ye truth, blaspheming Christ, and taking part against the
Holy ghost, cannot repent. For if sinners would convert and call upon God, they
should be sure of remission. Tindale.

Christ himself said unto the Pharesies, Every blasphemi^ shall be forgiven,
Mat. 12. 31
but the blasphemy against the Holy ghost, (which John calls a sin unto
death) shall never be forgiven, but is guilty unto everlasting damnation. What
sin or blasphemy is this? Uerely that declares S. Mark, saying: They said
he had an unclean spirit, that was the sin unto death everlasting, that was
the sin that should never be foruen. He proves so evidently unto them, that
his miracles were done by the spirit of God, that they could not deny it: and
yet of an hard and obstinate heart, even knowing the contrary, they said that he
had a Devil within him. These Pharesies dyed not forthwith, but lived
peradventure many years after. Notwithstanding if all the Apostles had prayed
for these Pharesies while they were yet living, for all that their sin
should not have been forgiven them. And truth is, that after they dyed in
impatiencie and desperation, which was the fruit of their sin, but not the
sin it self. Now see ye the meaning of this text, and what the sin unto
death or against the Holy ghost is. If any man perceive his brother to sin a
sin not unto death that is, not against the Holy ghost, let him ask and he
shall give him life, that is, let him pray unto God for his brother, and his
sin shall be forgiven him. But if he see his brother sin a sin unto
death, that is against the Holy ghost, let him never pray for him, for it
booteth not, and so is not the text understood of prayer after this life (as
Master Moore imagines) but even of prayer for our brother which is living with
us. I. Frith.

How our sin is made Christ's sin.
Long a salute mea. Psalm. 22. ^
Seeing that this is most true that S. Paul says of Christ that he never did
sin, neither was there any guile or deceit found in his mouth: how then can
these words be verified in the person of Christ: Long a salute mea, verba
delictorum meorum. The words of my sins, or my sinful words are ^arre from
my health. Our sin made Christ sin.
Uerely they cannot be applied to Christ for his own person. Nevertheless
after the mind of S. Austen, these words are therefore spoken by Christ the
head, because they be only verefied in Christ's members. So that the Prophet
makes Christ in this place to speak in his own person, that thing which is
verefied of us that be sinners, for whose sake he suffered his death and
passion, that in this place is so lively touched. Yea, this is S. Austens
saiengs, and these be his words: Christ did well say: My sinful words are far
from my health, not for any of his own sin: Sed nostra delicta sua delicta
fecit, vt suam iustitiam nostram iustitiam facerit: But he has made our
sins to be his sins, that he might make his righteousness to be our
righteousness. That is, he is contented to be reputed and deemed as a sinner,
because that in his unjust suffering, he might justly save sinners that believe
in him. The most part of the learned Expositours be of this mind. Ric. Turnar.

How sin is forgiven in Baptime.
Saint^ Austen says, Sin in Baptime forgiven
that all sin is forgiven in Baptime, not that it should not be at all, but
that it should not be reckoned for sin.

Sin offering what was meant thereby.
They that offered a Sin offering, Sin offering
must lay their hand upon it, meaning that they themselves had deserved that
death, and also that they did consecrate it to God, thereby to be sanctified.

SION.
What Sion is.
AS many as have evil will at Sion. Psa. 129. 5
Sion in the Scripture signifies the whole Church and Congregation of God, and
every faithful soul, that has his whole intent, affection and desire toward
God. T. M.

What the daughters of Sion signifies.
Therefore shall the Lord shane the heads of the daughters of Sion. Esaias. 3. 17
To shave the heads of women, is to make them confounded and ashamed, for it is
a shame for a woman to be shaven. 1. Cor. 11. 5. So that the Prophet hereby
signifies by a borrowed speech, that the Lord shall make the daughters of
Sion, (by which understand the women of Iewrie) confounded and ashamed, and
bring them to extreme adversity and poverty, and even to naught. Josephus
makes mention, that Jerusalem which was the chief City thereof, was once so
famished, that a certain woman of the City eat her own child. Albeit some
understand even here also by the daughters of Sion, ye towns villages and
castells of Sion, as it does indeed oftentimes in the Scripture.

Because the daughters of Sion, are hautie, etc. He means the people, because
of the pride and arrogancy of their women, which gave themselves to all
wantonness, and dissolution, Geneu.

SIR.
How men of countenance may be called Sir.
SIr, Ioh. 12. 21
we would feign see Jesus. These Greeks call Philip, Sir, and he refuses not
the same. It was the custom of those Countries, to call men of wealth and
countenance by that name. Whereupon also Mary Magdalen called Christ at the
Sepulcher after he was risen (Sir) when as notwithstanding she took him to be
a gardener. The Apostles did not gainsay this custom, neither were they
serupulous in the same, as we see the Anabaptists to be. Mar. upon John. fol.
434.

SIRTES.
What the Sirtes were.
LEast we should have fallen into the Sirtes. Sirtes are peri^lous sundry
places in the Sea about the coasts of Africa, of the nature of Whirlepooles.
Tindale.

SISTER.
How Abraham made his wife to say, she was his sister.
SAy, I pray thee, that thou art my Sister. By this we may learn not to use
unlawful means, Genesis 12. 13
nor to put other in danger to save our selves. Read ver. 20. Albeit it may
appear that Abraham feared not so much death, as that if he should dye with
out issue, Gods promise, should not have taken place, wherein appeared a weak
faith. Geneua.

Look. Abraham.

SIT.
What it is to sit in the Temple of God.
SHall sit as Godin the Temple of God. To sit in the Temple of Ged, 2. The. 2. 4
is to rule in the consciences, and to command, where God only has place, and
ought only to reign, which is as much as to be exalted above God. Tindale.

Who sits in the Temple of God.
Compare the commandments of God, with the constitutions of men, and you
shall easily understand, that the Bishop of Rome, whom they call the Pope, to
sit in the Temple of God as God, and to be exalted above all that is called
God. It is written, The Temple of the Lord is holy, which is you. Therefore the
conscience of man is the Temple of the Holy ghost, in which Temple I will prove
the Pope to sit as God, and to be exalted above all that is called God. For
whosoever contemns the Decalogue of the table of the commandments of God, there
is but a small punishment for him, neither is that punishment to death: but
contrariwise, he y^ shall contemn or violate (speaking to Friar Brusiard) ye
constitutions, which you call ye sanctions of men, is counted by all men's
judgments, guilty of death. What is this, but ye high bishop of Rome, to sit
and to reign in y^ temple of God, y^ is, in man's conscience, as God. Bil. in
the b. of M. 1140

What it is to sit on the right hand of God.
Sit thou on my right hand, etc. To sit on ye right hand is, to have y^ same
glory of the godly majesty ye he has, Psa. 110. 1
to rule and govern as largly as he does. Ephe. 1. 20. whom he set on his right
hand in heavenly things above all rule, etc. That is, made him equal with
himself, and ruler over all things. T. M.

What it is to sit in the dust.
Thou shall sit in the dust. E^ey. 47. 1
To sit in the dust, is to be brought low, to be poorly araied and decked, to
sit without pomp and to fall from her estate and degree. As is said. Jonas. 3.
6. The Prophet here describes the destruction of Babylon, under the figure of
a proud Queen, which was deliciously and dainetely brought up, and after fell
into extreme poverty, misery and wretchedness. T. M.

Why they sat not down at the eating of Passover.
Look. Passover.

SIX TROUBLES.
What it is to deliver out of vi. troubles.
HE shall deliver thee in vi. troubles. I(...). 5. 19.
We had need to mind well this lesson, that is to wit, that God will deliver
us out of vi. troubles: as if it had been said, we must not trust in God only
for a day or two, or only for one push: but forasmuch as our life is full of
many miseries, so y^ we be not sooner crept out of one adversity, but there
comes another fresh in the neck of it, and so we be tormented with miseries
out of number. Therefore, insomuch as we have a continual battle, and should
be overthrown incontinently, if God were not at hand to help us: we must
believe for a certainty, that he will not fail us. Some expound this text
more precisely, as though it were said, that God will deliver us from miseries
all y^ time of our life, and in the end make us to pass out of all, by taking
us out of this world. For like as the world was made in vi. days, so also man's
life is willingly comprehended in that number, and then comes rest, when God
strippeth us out of this mortal body: for ye see how he then makes an end of
all our labors, griefs and battles. But let it suffice us to hane the plain
meaning of this text, which is, that although we be ^ossed with many miseries
during this present life: God will continually make us way out of them, and
bring as to a good haven. Call. upon Job. fol. 99.

This sentence propounded after the manner of a Prophecy (in the 5. chap. of
Job) signifies all one with that of Paul. 1. Co^. 10. 13. God is faithful
which shall not suffer you to be tempted above your strength, but shall in the
mids of the temptation, make a way to escape out. Eliphas means, he has
verelye wrapped thee in many miseries, but when the seventh comes, and when it
shall seem to him, that the offense is sufficiently punished, and that thou
have left thine impatiencie (for that lays he to Job (though unjustly) then
will he prosper thee with so great health, that thou shall after lead thy life
most ^ortunate. T. M.

Alluding (the six troubles) to the six days of Gods first work, and the
seventh day he rested: meaning that of all thy cares and troubles, God will
deliver thee, and bring thee to rest, as in the seventh day. The Bible note.

He will send trouble upon trouble, that his children may not for one time,
but continually trust in him, but they shall have a comfortable issue, even in
the greatest and the last, which is here called the seventh. Geneua.

SLEEP.
How sleep is taken in Scripture.
THe maid is not dead but sleeps. Mat. 9. 24
Sleep in the scripture is taken oftentimes to dye: neither is it so said of
the good only, but also of the wicked. It is said of Steven, Act. 7. 60
when he had thus spoken, he fell asleep, and of Lazarus, Ioh. 11. 11
Our friend, Lazarus is asleep, but I go that I may awake him. Moreover it is
written, Of the which some remain as yet, 1. Cor. 15. 6
other some are asleep. Also of wicked Jeroboam it is said, 3. Reg. 14. 20.
And he slept with his Fathers. Both the wicked and the ungodly sleep unto the
Lord and shall be raised of him: but this is only believed of the godly, which
know y^ God is not the God of the dead, but of the living, and that all things
live unto him. Here upon y^ Christians with a singular faith calls ye place
of ye burial, Coimete^iou, which is in Latin Dormitoriu^, and as much to say in
English properly, a sleeping place, which commonly we now call, a Sepulcher, a
Tomb, or a grave. But here in this place Christ takes it otherwise. For
Christ makes a special difference between sleep and death, to the end he
might bring hope of life: as if he should have said. She is not so dead, that
she sleeps in death, for ye shall see hi^ arise by and by, whom ye think to
be dead^ Marl. upon Mat. fol. 191.

Concerning them which are fallen asleep. 1. The. 4. 13
To sleep in this place, is taken to dye, because of the sure hope of the
resurrection. For we are not so sure to rise again when we lay our selves
down to sleep, as we are sure by the word of God, that our natural bodies
shall be raised again, and this sleep ought only to be applied to the body,
and not unto the soul, which is immortal. S. I. Cheek.

But while men slept. Mat. 13. 25
This sleep signifies the negligence that men have of God, which connueth by
the carfulness of riches and pleasures of this world. Tindale.

Sleep henceforth and take your rest. Mat. 26. 45.
This is an Ironie, which is one thing spoken, and another meant. And here in
hidding them sleep, he signifies that it had been more meete^ for them, to
have gone about other business, then to fall a sleeping at this time. Tindale.

He speaks this in a contrary sense, meaning they should anon be well
wakened. Geneua.

What David meant by this sleep.
That I sleep not in death, Psa. 13. 4.
etc. That is, that I sleep not the sleep of death, that I dye not and be
overcome of mi(...) enemies, and therefore follows it, least mine enemies
say, they have prevailed against me. T. M.

The meaning of this place following.
And many sleeping in the earth, Dan. 12. 2
shall be up waked, etc. To dye is not else, but after labor ^ weariness of
body, to go to bed and sleep, and so to rise up early more fresh and lusty,
by which vprising he describes our resurrection. By sleep is understood, the
rest of our bodies in our graves (for our souls sleep not but be received into
the hands o^ our Father in heaven blessed with Christ in the fruition of his
pres^nce) and by the rising up again in the morning is understood y^
resurrection of our dead bodies unto life eternal, our souls joined again to
them. Melan. up. Da.

Meaning all shall rise at the general resurrection, which thing he here
means because the faithful should have ^uer their respect to that, for in
the earth there shall be no sure comfort. Geneua.

How God is said to sleep.
God is said to sleep, Augustine
when Christ lay dead in his grave, whose death is called a sweet sleep of
^eremie: or else when he is slow to help his elect out of trouble, as in the
Psa. 44. 23. Arise, wherefore do thou sleep O Lord.

SLIME.
What Slime was.
SLime was their mortar. Genesis 11. 3
That slime was a fatnes y^ issued out of ye earth like unto tar, and thou
may call it Sement and if thou will. In the 14. Chap. verse 10. ye shall read
of Slime pits.

SMYRNA.
What Smyrna was.
ANd unto Smyrna. This was the famous City of all Ionia by the record of
Pliny, in his 5. Book and 29. Chapter, and of Strabo in his 14. Book. This
word Smyrna, Apoe. ^. 11
sounds as much as Myrrh. Marl. fol. 19.

SNARE.
What the snare signifies.
FRom the snare of the hunter. Psa. 91. 3
The snare here signifies al naughty doctrine, whether it be taken of the
Scripture evil expounded, or of the evil inventions of men. As in the Psa. 69.
22. and 119. 110. T. M.

That is, Gods help is most ready for us, whether Satan assail us secretly,
which he calls a snare, or openly, which is here meant by the pestilence.
Geneua.

The meaning of this place following.
Let their Table be made a snare to take themselves withal. Psa. 69. 22
That is, let their opinion and doctrine be the cause of their stiffenesse and
destruction, as it is come to the Jews. To. 11. 9. The Hebrew Paraphrast says
thus, Let such a dinner be set before them, whereunto they may be so bound,
that they cannot escape. The Scripture is a snare unto the ungodly, wherewith
they be trapped, although they be never so well learned, for only the spiritual
perceives the meaning. On the other side, unto the godly, though they have
never so little learning, it is the River of the water of life. John. 7. 38. T.
M.

The Jews carry about in their hands the books of Moses, and understand them
not: they read the Prophecies, and deny that in the^ is promised. But where
unto makes this, some man will say? They are blindfolded, they are snared,
they be bowed down and become deaf. Eras. in his Paraphrase.

SNOW.
Of the ingendring of snow.
WHen God covers the whole earth with snow, whence takes he so great
quantity of waters? Truly men will it is ingendered in the middle roomth of
the air, which is cold, and that when a great quantity of vapors be drawn
up thither, at length the same comes together and freeseth, and thereof
ingendereth the snow: and if the same stuff be more harder bound, then is
hayle ingendered, because y^ thing is become more fast and substantial, etc.
Call. upon Job. fol. 704.

Snow is a Cloud congeled by great cold, before it be perfectly resolved from
vapors into water. Snow is white, not of ye proper color, but by receiving the
light into it, in so many small parts, as in foam, or the white of an Egg
beaten. Snow is often upon high Hills, lies long there, because their tops
are cold, as they be near to the middle region of the air. For oftentimes it
rayneth in the valley, when it snoweth on the Hills. Snow melting on the high
hills, and after frosen again, becomes so hard, that it is a stone, and is
called Crystal. Sleet is generated even as Snow, but of less cold, or else
begins to melte in the falling. Snow causes things growing to be fruitful,
and increase, because the cold drives heat into the roots, and so
cherishes the plants. W. Fulee.

SOLD.
What it is to be sold under sin.
BUt I am carnal, Romans 7. 14
sold under sin. Like as bondmen are violently thrust, hurled and turmoiled
as it pleases their cruel master: so are we through heaps of sins, draw^n
to many evil doings, which we neither, do like nor allow. The Bible note.

Read. 3. Reg. 21. 20. of Achab.

SON OF MAN.
What is meant by the Son of man.
BEcause he is the Son of man. Ioh. 5. 27
To be the Son of man according to the phrase of Scripture is nothing else,
then to be a very man, even as that he is said to be the Son of God, is meant
that he is very God. The meaning of Christ is, that he came forth unto men
adorned with such power, that he might communicate and bestow that upon them,
which he had received of his father. And in that he is man, he was ordained by
the Father to be the Author of life, least we should seek him a far off.
For Christ has not received any thing, whereof he himself stood in need, but
rather to make us rich with his abundaunt treasure. The sum and meaning is,
that in the man Christ, the same is reveled unto us, which was hidden in God:
and the life which men before could not attain unto, is now at hand. Also it
is worthy to be noted, y^ when he might have said, because he is man, he chose
rather to say, because he is the Son of man. Let this serve our faith
against those that teach, that Christ took flesh not of the Uirgin Mary, y^ is
to say of the seed of Abraham (which the whole Scripture teaches) but that he
brought the same with him from Heaven. But Christ here plainly, calls
himself the Son of man, not man only. Marl. upon. John. fol. 168.

But the Son of man has not whereon to rest his head. Mat. 8. 20
Christ calls himself the Son of man, that is very natural man, showing in
that his humility and goodness, which humbled himself to the death of the
Cross, for our salvation. Tindale.

Whosoever speaks a word against the Son of man, etc. Luke. 12. 10
To speak a word against the Son of man, is to be offenwith the humanity or
manhood of Jesus Christ, for his humble and low degree, as were many of the
Jews. Tindale.

Behold one like the Son of man came in the clouds. Dan. 7. 13.
Which is meant of Christ, who had not yet taken upon him man's nature, neither
was the Son of David according to the flesh as he was afterward: but appeared
then in a figure, and that in the Clouds: that is, being separate from the
common sort of men by manifest signs of his Divinity. Geneua.

How the son is punished for the fathers fault.
He shall dye the death, and his blood shall be upon him. Eze. 18. 13
He shows how the son is punished for his fathers fault, that is, if he be
wicked as his Father was, and does not repent, he shall be punished as his
father was, or else not. Geneua.

SON OF GOD.
How Christ is proved to be the Son of God.
THou art my son, this day have I begotten thee. Phi. 2. 7
That is, this day have I declared that thou art my natural son, meaning
especially the time, in which he made him known in the world by his wonderful
works, as S. Paul meant when he said: God was made manifest in the flesh,
noting the working of the spirit, working in his birth, life, death,
resurrection, and ascension: so this day notes no particular time, but al
times in general, wherein God has showed his power in Christ, as especially
in the time he lived among us, etc. Deering.

Of the Son of Gods delivering up his kingdom unto his father.
Then comes the end, ^. Co. 15. 24
when he has delivered up the kingdom to God the father, when he has put
down all rule authority and power: for he must reign till he have put all
his enemies under his feet: but where he says all things are put under him,
it is manifest, that he is excepted which did put all things under him: when
all things are subdued unto him, then shall the son also himself be subject
unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. S. Paul in
this place does the Corinthians to wit, that then shall the end come, that all
things shall be subdued unto Jesus Christ: and Christ his Son shall deliver
unto his Father his kingdom, that is the Church, the whole number of ye elect,
which he has by his death redeemed. Then also Christ ye son himself shall be
subject unto the father, touching the dispensation of his flesh, and in his
members the Saints, by which it is meaned, that then the mystery of Christ
shall cease, the preaching of the Gospel shall be left, and no longer any such
in the everlasting kingdom of God and the saints, shall be as was in ye militant
Church, when the world was subject unto the preaching of the Gospel. For where
no sin nor disease is, there needs no remission or medicine. And this
subjection of ye Saints, shall be ye most free kingdom unto them, for then Jesus
Christ, very God and man, shall be al in all: God in God, and reigning in all
things: creature in creatures, and to God subject as a creature, etc. Uerely
touching the dispensation of the flesh, and the mystery now in force and ure,
Christ shall be subject to his father: but being true God, and cousubstanciall
son of God the Father, has, and shall everlastingly have, one and indivisible
reign and kingdom with the father. I. Proctor.

Now Christ shall surrender the Kingdom that was given unto him, that we may
cleave perfectly unto God, howbeit he shall not by that means utterly give up
his kingdom, whereof as the Scripture teaches there is no end, but he shall as
it were convey it from his manhood to his Godhead. For then we shall have an
open entry, and free access to the divine majesty, where now our weakness
will not suffer us to approach. Christ then shall this way be subject to his
Father, for then the vale shall be taken away, and the office of his mediation
shall some way cease, and we shall see God face to face reigning in his glory,
without any countring or mean.

And where S. Paul says, that God may be all in all, some think he speaks
so, because we shall have than without any mean, many commodities, which God
now ministers unto us by creatures. For maintenance of our life, we shall then
have no need of bread and drink, etc. Neither for edifieng shall we have any
need of the Sacraments of the Church, nor the outward word of the Scripture,
nor Ecclesiastical offices, for God by himself shall be all in all. Other
teach the meaning of those words to be, that the flesh shall covet no more the
spirit, but God shall possess every part of us, and reign in us fully and
perfectly, which thing in this life is only begun. B. Traher.

Look. Subjection.

How the son of God is equal to his father.
Thought it no robbery to be equal with God. Phil. 2. 6
If the son be equal to the father, then is there of necessity an equality,
which Arrius that Heretic denies. And if the son be compared with the
father, then is there a distinction of persons, which Sebellius that heretic
denies. Beza.

Who are the sons of God.
The sons of God are the sons of Seth, Genesis 6.
which had instructed and nourished them in the fear of God. The sons of
men are the sons of Cain, instructed of him to all wickedness. Tindale.

The sons of God seeing the daughters of men that they were fair. Genesis 5. 2
S. Austen says, that those which are there called the sons of God, were in
very deed men, namely, coming of the stock of Seth. For when they worshipped
God truly and sincerely, and called upon him holily and purely being adorned
with his favor and grace, they are called by the Scriptures, the sons of God.
But when at the length they began to burn in filthy lusts, with those women
which came of the stock of Cain, and by that means fell into fellowship with
the ungodly, taking them to their wives, and cleaving also to superstitious and
wicked worshippings, they were changed from the sons of God, not only into
men, but also into flesh. And this will I say by the way, Aquila translating
these words out of Hebrew, They were not (says he) the sons of God, but the
sons of Gods: for the cause so called (as I suppose) because their
progenitors were holy men, but their Children miserably fell from God and
godliness, by inordinate love of women. And Simmachus translateth it, the
sons of the naughty, etc. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 16.

By the sons of God are understood those that descended from Seth, which were
instruct in the true knowledge and worship of God, as in many places both in
the old Testament and in the new, the faithful are called the sons of God.
And by the daughters of men are understood the women that came of the
generation of Cain, which were given to all ungodliness, and with them Seth
commanded his children by ye will of GOD, that they should make no contract of
marriage, as the Lord commanded the Children of Israel, to make no marriage
with the women of the Cananites. Lyra.

The Sons of the godly, joined themselves with the Daughters of the wicked,
without all fear of God. Geneua.

How we are borne the sons of God.
Which are borne, not of blood, etc. John. 1. 13
These words pertain^ to the description of them which believe in the name of
Christ, and do receive the right of the adoption of the sons of God, they
which are such are not borne of flesh and blood, but of God: flesh and blood
begets not the children of God. That which is of the flesh is flesh, and
that which is of ye spirit is spirit. By these words the Evangelist means
nothing else, but the carnal birth. For he makes a comparison of the
generation of the flesh and the spirit, rejecting the one and allowing the
other, etc. They which believe in Christ, being before unclean Gentiles, are
not borne the sons of God out of the womb, or by flesh and blood, but are
brought thereunto by the workmanship of the holy Ghost. And although properly
he has respect unto the Jews, which were proud in the flesh, yet
notwithstanding of this place, a general doctrine may be gathered, namely,
that whereas we are counted the sons of God, it comes not by the property
of our nature, neither of our selves, but because the Lord has begotten us of
his own free will and singular love. Marl. upon John. fol. 19.

That we should be called the sons of God. 1. John. 3. 1.
Being made the sons of God in Christ, he shows what qualities we must have
to be discerned from bastards. Geneua.

SOPHIST.
What a Sophist was at the beginning, and what it is now.
SOphists at the first beginning were men that professed to be teachers of
wisdom and eloquence. And the name of Sophists was had in honor and price,
and they were of the same estimation and of the very same faculty and science
that afterward were called Rhetores, that is, Rethoritians, yea, and also
Logitians. For when the Sophists fell to cauilling, brawling, and tri^ling, by
little and little the estimation decayed. So that or the time that Socrates
lived in, a Sophist was a name of contempt and hatred, and so it is yet still
at this day. Vdal.

SORROVV.
Of godly sorrow, and worldly sorrow.
FOR godly sorrow causes repentance unto salvation. 2. Cor. 7. 1^
Godly sorrow is, when we are not terrified with the fear of punishment, but
because we feel we have offended God our most merciful Father: Contrary to
this, there is an other sorrow that only fears punishment, or when a men is
vexed for the loss of some worldly goods: the fruit of the first is
repentance, the fruit of the second is desperation, unless the Lord help
speedely. Beza.

There be two manner of sorrows. The one comes of God and engendereth
repentance unto life. The other comes of the flesh, and breeds desperation
unto death. We have examples of both, in Cain and David, in Judas and Peter,
for they all sorrowed, but the sorrow of Cain and Judas was fleshly and
carnal, and therefore being without godly comfort, it did drive them to
desperation. Whereas David and Peter in their godly sorrow, did fly unto the
father of mercy with a true repentaunt heart, and were received again into
the favor of God. Sir. I. Cheek.

Whose heart Gods spirit does teach, he is sorry for his sins, committed
against so merciful a God, and these are the fruits of his repentance, as
witness David's and Peter's tears. Other which are sorry for their sins
only for fear of punishment and Gods vengeance, fall into desperation. As
Cain, Saul, Judas, Achitophel, etc. Geneua.

How Christ overcame the sorrows of death.
And loosed the sorrows of death. Apoc. 2. 24
The death that was full of sorrow both of body and mind. Therefore when death
appeared conqueror and victour over those sorrows, Christ is rightly said to
have overcome those sorrows of death, when as being dead, he overcame death to
live for ever with his father. Beza.

Both as touching the pain and also the horror of Gods wrath and curse.
Geneua.

SOVLDIER.
What the profession of a soldier is.
TO profess a soldier is of it self (says Erasmus) to confess the puddle
and sink of all mischief.

The meaning of this place following.
Thou therefore suffer affliction as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. ^. Tim. 2.
34.
No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life,
because he would please him that has chosen him to be a soldier. The latter
sentence is general and perteyneth to all men. The meaning is this: Whosoever
would be a soldier unto Christ, must leave all worldly things and follow him.
And what Saint Paul means by the affairs of this life: Hear Master
Caluines judgment: by the affairs of this life, the Apostles understands
the care of governing his family and other ordinary business. He also applies
the place on this wise: Now this comparison (says he) is to be applied to the
present purpose, that whosoever will play tho warrier under Christ, leaving
all worldly matters and impediments, must give himself wholly unto him.

SOVLE.
The diverse taking of this word Soul.
THe souls of them that were put to death, etc. Apoc. 6. 9.
The word soul is put sometime for the life, Life.
because the soul is y^ cause of life, and because the life consists in the
soul, as in y^ Psalm. 119. 109. and in Job. 16. 4. Also it is taken for will,
mind, or desire, Will. mind, Desire.
because it is the seat of the will and desire. In which sense the soul of
Ionathas is said to be linked to the soul of David. 1. Re. 18. 1. And the
soul of Sichem is said to have cleued to Dina the daughter of Jacob. Ge. 24.
8. And Luke says, that the multitude that believed were of one heart and of
one soul. Act. 4. 32. Many times it is taken for the whole living man: the
whole man.
as when it is said, that threescore and sixteen souls went with Jacob into
Egypt. Ge. 46. 27. Also the soul that sins, the same shall dye. Eze. 18.
20. And the soul that steppeth aside to witches and southsayers, shall dye the
death. etc. Leuit. 20. 6. And again, eight souls were saved by water. ^. Pet.
3. 20. Sometime it is taken for the breath which men do breath in and out,
Breath.
wherein consists ye lively moving of the body, like as when it is said,
perplexity has caught hold of me, although my whole soul be still within m^^
2. Reg. 1. 9. And his soul is in him. Act. 20. 10. Also let the soul of the
child return into his bowels. 3. Reg. 17. 21. And like as in the Latin phrase
of speech, they be commonly wont to say, that the soul is puffed or breathed
out, so also does the scripture say, that the soul passes or goes out: as it
is said in Rachel: And as her soul was passing or going out, (for she was then
vieng) she called the child Benony. Genesis 35. 18. But most often the soul is
taken for the immortal spirit of man, Spirit immortal.
like as it is said: fear not them that kill the body, but cannot kill the
soul. Math. 10. 28. In this sense does John say here, that he saw the souls
of them that were put to death, etc. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 96.

The souls of the Saints are under the Altar, which is Christ, meaning that
they are in safe custodye in the heavens. Geneua.

How Christ's soul was heavy.
My soul is heavy even unto death. Mat. 26. 38.
Here we learn that Christ did not only take an humane body upon him, but
also an humane soul. So that he was both a perfect man, and perfect God, else
if the Godhead had been unto him in steed of his soul, he could not have been
heavy. Sir. I. Cheek.

Of Christ's soul descending into hell.
That his soul should not be left in hell. Act. 2. 31.
Saint Augustine writing of the presence of God unto Dardanus. 2. chap.
alleges this saying of the Apostle, and thereby goes about to prove that
the soul of Christ went down in very deed to hell, but that he suffered
nothing there. Other do affirm that it is said by a figurative manner of
speaking, that he went down to hell because that the merit of his death and
passion was profitable to them that after died in the faith of Abraham. Some
again by the word Inferi, do understand the grave. I would wish we should
always study to unity and peace, and leave these unfruitful questions. Sir.
I. Cheek.

Look Christ's descending into hell.

Thou shall not leave my soul in hell. Psa. 16. 10
That is, thou shall not forsake me, that my soul shall dye: and that
follows, neither shall thou suffer thy Saints to see corruption: signifies
thou shall not suffer my body to abi^^ in the grave, and so to corrupt. So does
Peter expound this place of Christ. Act. 2. 27 and Paul Act. 13. 7: T. M.

This is chiefly spoken of Christ, by whose resurrection all his members have
immortality. Geneua.

Wherein the soul of man and beast do differ.
In man, the soul by which he knows, Difference of souls.
judges and has discreation, is called living. The soul of beasts have none
other faculty, but to give moving unto their bodies. Calvin.

Of the apparition of souls.
The souls that is departed from the body cannot wander in this countries or
regio^s, Chri. upon his. 29. Ho mi. upon the ^. of Matthew.
for the souls of the righteous are in the hands of God, and also the souls
of sinners are straight ways after their departure led away, it is made
manifest by the rich man and Lazarus. Chrysostom in his. 29. Homil. upon the.
8. of Matthew. T. M.

But the Lord does say in an other place, this day will I fetch again thy
soul from thee. Therefore the soul after it is once gone from the body,
cannot wander here among us, and not without a good cause. For if they that go
in a journey, if they chance to come into some unknown country, cannot tell
whither to go except they have a guide, how much more shall the soul being
departed from the body when she enters into life and way, that is altogether
new unto her, be uncertain and ignorant whither she may go, except she
get a guide.

It may be proved by many places of Scripture, that y^ souls of the righteous
men, do not wander here after their death. For Stephen says: Lord receive my
spirit: And Paul did desire to be loosed, and to be with Christ. The Scripture
also does say of the Patriarch, and he was laid to his Fathers, being dead in a
good age. And that the souls of sinners cannot abide there, neither hear the
rich what he says, mark and weigh what he does ask and not obtain. If the
souls of men might be conversant here, he would have come himself, as his
desire was, and certified his brethren of the torments of hell, By the which
place of the scripture this is also most manifest and plain, that the souls
after they be gone out of their bodies, are lead into a certain place, from
whence they come not again at their own will and pleasure, but do tarry
there for the dreadful day of judgment.

God forbid that we should believe that the soul of any Saint, Tertulian in
his book of the soul.
much less of a Prophet have been fetched up by the devil, being taught that
Satan himself is transformed into an Angel of light, much more into a man of
light, and that he shall also affirm himself to be God, and work wonderful
signs for to subvert even the very elect if it were possible.

But although the virtue of God has called again certain souls into their
bodies, for to teach us that he might do it by his own right: it shall not
therefore be communicated or granted unto the confidence and boldness of
Magitians or Sorcerers, and unto the deceitfulness of dreams, and lyeng
Poets: but when in the example of the resurrection, the virtue or power of God
does bring again the very souls into the bodies, it is showed with a whole
and full truth, and which can be touched and handled, that is a shape and
form of verity, or that is a true and unfeigned shape or form: so that thou
may judge that all fetching up and appearing of the dead without bodies, are
mere illusions and deceitfulness.

There be such now a days which are wont to say: Theophi.
Who has seen what is done in hell, who ever came to bring us word? But let
them hear what Abraham says: for if we do not believe the Scriptures, we
would not believe them neither that should come from hell. The Jews have well
declared the same, which because that they believed not the Scriptures, would
in no wise believe them that were raised again from the dead, but would have
slain Lazarus that was raised again. And although many were raised again
from death, after that Christ was crucified, yet did they not let to persecute
the Apostles most cruelly afterward. Theophilact. upon the 16. of Luke. I. N.

The spirit of Samuel which the woman Sorcerer raised up to Saul, Augustine.
was not the soul of Samuel, but the devil which appeared in Samuels
likeness, for to deceive Saul. Aug. to. simpl. 3. quest.

Of souls departed.
S. Austen writes that the souls of the Saints be in the secret receptacles,
Augustine.
until they shall receive the crown of glory in the day of judgment.
Again, in an Epistle he wrote to Saint Hierome, A soul (says he) after
bodily death shall have rest, and than after that shall take her body, that she
may have glory.

S. Barnard says: S. Barnard
the sweetness which the souls of the Saints have at this present is great,
but it is not yet perfect: for it shall be made perfect, when they shall sit on
seats as Judges. When they have put of their bodies, they be forthwith brought
into rest, 3. estates of y^ soul
but not into the glory of the kingdom. He says farther, that there be three
estates of the soul: The first is in the body as in a tabernacle: the second
after death as in a porch of the temple: the third in heaven with his glorified
body.

The meaning of this place following.
And shall win his soul for a pray. Iere. 21. 9.
That is, shall escape danger. It is all one with that which goes before, he
shall save his life, his soul, that is, his life shall be unto him as a pray,
because he should utterly have lost it, if he had bidden in Hierosalem: and by
flieng to the Chaldees he should win it, even as a man wins a pray in
battle. T. M.

How satan has no power of the soul of the godly.
God has given Satan leave to punish Job, Job. 1. 12.
he says to him, behold, thou may work thy spite upon his substance, but
much not his person. And again after he has destroyed all his goods, he
says: Thou may touch his person, but thou shall not come ^eere his soul:
H^^re^^ aga^^ we see how God reserueth always the soul of Job sol (...) Satan
can no more but torment him in his goods, and in his mortal life, and in his
honor, for he had not the power to ^^lter into his soul to sedu^e him, and to
make him to burst out into impatience. Calui^^e. fol. 22.

How the souls departed know not what is done in earth.
If the souls of the dead departed (says Saint Austen) were present at the
affairs of the living, then would they speak unto us, when we see them in
our sleep, and to omit others, my tender mother would forsake me never a
night, which followed by sea and by land, to the end she might live together
with me. God forbid she should become cruel in the happ^er life, so that (if
ought al anytime greiue my heart) she comfort not her sorrowful son, whom
she loved entirely, whom she would never see sad. But in good sooth, that
which the sacred Psalm soundoth out is true: My Father and my Mother has
forsaken me, but the Lord took me up: if our Fathers have forsaken us, how are
they present at our cares and business? If our parents be not present, what
other of the departed be there which know what we do, or what we suffer? The
Prophet Esaias says: Abraham has been ignorant of us, and Israel has not
known us. God of his great goodness promised Josias that he should dye, and
be gathered unto his people least y^ he should see the plagues which he
threatened should happen to y^ place and people. Chrysostom writes that the
devils uses to say to the living, Anima talis ego sum, I am such a man's soul,
to the end he may deceive him. Chrisost. Mat. chap. 8.

Cipriane says: Cipriane.
The wicked spirits do hide themselves in pictures and Images consecrated,
they inspire the minds of the Prophets: they holden the heart strings and
intrailes: they govern the flieng of birds: they sort lots: they sift out
Oracles: they mingle always falsehood and truth togethers, they distemper the
health, for they deceive and are deceived: They trouble the life: they disquiet
the sleep: and creeping into the bodies, they fray the secrets of the mind:
they bring the lim^ out of fashion: they distemper the health: they vex with
diseases, that they may compel the poor silly wretches to the worshipping of
them, that being filled with the savor from the altars and burnt bowels of
b^ast^, loosing the thing which they bound. They may seem to cure, for this is
their curing and healing, when they cease to hurt. Cipriane de Idol. vanitate.

SOVND.
Why Calvin does use this word Sound, and not perfect.
HE was a sound man. Job. 1. 1.
This word sound in the Scripture is taken for a plain^nesse, when there is no
point of sayuing counter feiting or hypocriste in a man, but that he shows
himself the same out wardly that he is inwardly, and specially when he has no
starting holes to shift himself from God, but ^a^eth open his heart, and all
his thoughts and affections, so that he desires nothing but to consecrate and
dedicate himself wholly unto God. The same word also has been translated,
perfect, as well by the Greeks as by the Latins. But forasmuch as the word
perfect has afterward been misconstrued: it is better for us to use the word
sound, for many ignorant persons not knowing how the said perfection is to be
taken, have thought thus: Behold here a man that is called perfect, and
therefore it follows that it is possible for us to have perfection in our
selves, even during the time we walk in this present life, but they deface
the grace of God, whereof we have need continually. For even they that have
lived most uprightly, must have recourse to Gods mercy, and except their
sins be forgiven them, and that God uphold them, they must needs all
perish. So then, although that they which have used this word perfect have
meant well, yet notwithstanding forasmuch as there has been some that have
wrast it to a contrary sense (as I have said) let us keep still this word
Sound. Calvin upon Job. fol. 3.

SOVVE.
What it is to sow in the flesh, and to sow in the spirit.
TO sow in the flesh is to prouido for the needs of this present life, Apoc.
22. 2
without regard of the life to come. It is to be all for a man's own self, to
feed his own paunch only, and to bestow nothing to the mainteinaunce of the
spiritual functions. And to sow in the flesh is to follow the fruits of the
flesh, and to pamper the fleshly lusts. And to sow in the spirit is to look
more to heaven, then to the earth. And to frame a man's life, as he may seek
always, the kingdom of God. We sow in the spirit, when we do and suffer
all thing in this life, to the end we may be well at ease in the life to come.
Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 307.

For he that sows in the flesh, Gal. 6. 8.
etc. He proves that the ministers must be nourished: for if men only
provide for worldly things, without respect of the life everlasting, then they
procure to themselves death, and mock God, who has given them his ministers
to teach them heavenly things. Geneua.

SPETTLE.
Of the clay that Christ made with his Spettle.
HE spat on the ground and made clay of the spettle, John. 9. 6.
and anointed the eyes of the blind with the clay. This was not for any
virtue that was in the earth, in the spettle, or in the clay to make one see,
but it only pleased him to use these signs and means. Geneua.

How Spettle was abused in Baptime.
THe spettle whereby they do not lighten but defile and beraye the infant,
John. 9. 6.
they took out of the miraculous fact of Christ, where he did strike over the
eyes of him that was borne blind with the spettle and clay, and opened them.
This miracle the Apostles did see, but for all that none of them stroke their
spettle in the eyes of them that should be baptized. Musculus. fol. 291.

SPIDERS WEB.
What it is to weaue the Spiders web.
AND weaue the Spiders web. Esaias. 59. 5
To weaue the Spiders web, is to go about vain and trifling things which are
of no value, although they seem never so excellent to the dooers. T. M.

SPIRIT.
How this word spirit is understood.
GOD is a spirit. John. 4. 24
This word spirit is to be taken here, as it is set against that commandment
which is called carnal. Heb. 7. 16. as the commandment is considered in it
self: And so he speaks of (truth) not as we set it against a lie, but as we
take it in respect of the outward ceremonies of the law, which did only
shadow that which Christ performed in deed. Beza.

God being of a spiritual nature, requires a spiritual service, and
agreeable to the nature. Geneua.

How the spirit of God makes intercession for us.
But the spirit makes great intercession for us, Romans 8. 26
etc. The right form and affection of prayer, comes by the holy Ghost, who
makes intercession for us, not that he prays and mourns, but that he so
stirs our hearts, that we lift them up to heaven earnestly and seruently
which is the true prayer. The Bible note.

Who is of else spirit of truth, and who is not.
Even the spirit of truth, John. 14. 17
etc. The spirit (which Christ did promise) shall teach only these things,
which Christ had taught before: whosoever therefore does teach any other
doctrine besides Christ's doctrine, he is not of the spirit of truth, but of the
spirit of leasing. Sir I. Cheek.

Of the spirit that Christ promised to send.
The spirit, says h^, which I will (...) from my father, Ioh. 16. 13.
shall lead you into all truth, but how^ Because (says he) he shall put you in
mind of all those things that I have told you. There he gives warning that
there is nothing more to be looked for of his spirit, but that he should
enlighten our minds to perceive the truth of his doctrine. Therefore Chrysostom
(Sermo de sanc, and adon spi. John 12. (...) 10.) says excellently well. Many
(says he) do boast of the holy spirit: but they which speak their own, do
falsely pretend that they have him. As Christ testified that he spoke not of
himself: because he spoke out of ye law and the Prophets. So if any thing
beside the Gospel, be thrust in under the title of the spirit, let us not
believe it, because as Christ is the fulfilling of the l^we and Prophets, so is
y^ spirit of the Gospel. C^^. in his Inst. 4. b. cap. 8. Sect. 13.

Why the holy Ghost is called the spirit of truth.
Who is the spirit of truth. John. 14. 17
He is called the spirit of truth not only because he is true, but because he
makes the men in to whom he enters true, whereas all that they do without
the spirit, is none other thing but lies. Tindale.

So called because he works in us the truth. Geneua.

Of the spirit of southsaieng.
A certain damsel possessed with the spirit of southsaieng met us. Act. 16.
15
Which could tell things past, and guess at things to come, which knowledge in
many things God permits to the devil, to this end (as Austen writes) that
he might the more mightily deceive those that would believe him. The Bible
note.

Of the spirit of the Prophets.
For the spirits of the Prophets are in the power of y^ Prophets. 1. Cor. 14 32.
Here he speaks not of the holy Ghost, in whose power all men ought to be,
but of the several gifts of the spirit, which are now in the power of them
that have them, that they may always without contention use them to y^
odifieng of the Church of Christ. Sir I. Cheke.

Spirits of the Prophets, y^ is the doctrine that they do bring, as being put
in mind by the spirit of God. The Bible note.

Or learning which Gods spirit moves them to utter. Ge.

Of the spirits in prison.
And preached unto the spirits in prison. 1. Pe. 3. 19
It is unknown to us where this prison was, for the holy Scripture speaks
nothing of it: In the Gospel it is called the bosom of Abraham. It is
sufficient for us to know and believe that all the souls of the Saints or
faithful, Spirits in prison.
which dyed since the beginning of ye world, are saved by the blood of Christ,
howbeit the Gospel was sundry ways preached unto the dead. For unto the holy
Patriarchs deliverance and salvation, unto the unfaithful, deserved
dampnation was preached. Sir. I. Cheek.

Christ being from the beginning head and governor of his Church, came in the
days of Noe, not in the body which he then had not, but in the spirit: and
preached by the mouth of Noe, for the space of an hundred and twenty years to
the disobedient, which would not repent, and therefore are now in prison,
reserved to the last judgment. Geneua.

How to serve God in the spirit.
To serve God in the spirit, Spirit.
is to honor God with a true ^ffection, proceeding from a pure and clean
heart, and not by Images, or other visible and corruptible things, or else by
shows and outward ceremonies. Pet. Viret.

SPIRITVALL.
Who they be that be spiritual.
ALL be spiritual men which are lead by Gods spirit, 1. Cor. 2. 11
and he who has more abundaunce of Gods spirit, is more spiritual. Of a like
manner S. Paul speaking to the married sort in Rome, Romans 8. 9.
as well as to ye rest, said: Vos non estis in carne, sed in spiritu, You be not
in the flesh but in the spirit: And Saint John John. 1. 12.
in his first Chapter names all to be spiritual that believe in Christ, for
flesh and blood is not able to bring forth such a child. And if the outward
admission were able to make a man spiritual, then should Judas and such like,
who had the outward election (yet inwardly followed ye spirit of the flesh and
of the Devil) be worthily called spiritual. But our Savior Christ reasoning
with Nichodemus makes a plain proof by evident demonstration, that only
such as be endued with Gods spirit, be worthy of the name spiritual, and that
such as be not borne of Gods spirit, be not spiritual but carnal. And in
the same place the Lord has given a general resolution, that no man can enter
into the kingdom of heaven, unless he become a spiritual man and be borne a
new, not only of water, but also of the holy Ghost. Ponet. fol. 34.

For the spiritual judges all things. 1. Cor. 2. 15
Who is that spiritual? Not such as we now call men of holy Church, but all
that have the true interpretation of the law in their hearts: The right faith
of Christ and the true intent of works, which God bids us to work. He is
spiritual and judges all things, and is judged of no man. Tindale.

The natural man perceives not the things of the spirit of God, 1. Cor. 2. 14
etc. but he that is spiritual discusseth all things. Paul does call him
spiritual which is renewed by the spirit of God, and being governed by the
same spirit, does examine and try all things with the true touchstone of Gods
word, which is set forth unto us by the inspiration of the same spirit that he
is inclined withal, but he himself (that is to say the spirit) is judged of no
man. Here also the natural man is taken for him, which being without the
spirit of God, is lead by his natural affections. Sir. I. Cheek.

Of the spiritual house.
Look Stone.

Of the spiritual eating of Christ's body.
As the body of Christ is seen, Augustine.
so is it touched: and as it is touched, so is it eaten. But it is not seen
with bodily ^ies, it is not touched with bodily fingers.

S. Ambrose says: Fide tangitur Christus, Ambr. in Luke. li. 6 cap. 8.
etc. By faith Christ is touched: By faith Christ is seen, therefore the body
of Christ is not eaten with the bodily mouth, but only by faith, which is the
spiritual mouth of the soul.

SPITTING.
What is meant by spitting in her face.
IF her Father had spit in her face, Nu. 12. 14
should she not be ashamed. 7. days. To spit in her face, is to punish her,
and to cause her to see her offense. The Lord is a father and punishes his
chosen, not to vampne them, but to correct and fear them, and to drive them to
earnest repentance. After. 7. days was she received again into y^ host. So
after repentance had, must we be received into the congregation. T. M.

SPRINKLING.
What is meant by the sprinkling of blood.
AND sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. 1. Po. 1. 2
Here S. Peter seems to have had a respect unto the old ceremony of blood
sprinkling. For even as it was not enough then, y^ the sacrifice should be
offered and the blood thereof, unless the people had been sprinkled with ye
same: So now at this present it shall profit us nothing that Christ's blood is
shed, unless our conscience be cleansed and purified therewith, which thing is
done by the ministering of ye holy Ghost, who does sprinkle our consciences with
Christ's blood, to wash them with all. S. I. C.

STAFF.
What it is to go with a Staff.
FOr with my staff came I over this Iordane. Genesis 32. 10
To go with a staff is a manner of speaking of the Hebrews, which signifies
nothing else but to go simply, barely, and without any riches or strength. As in
Mar. 6. 8. T. M.

What the staff of Gods mouth signifies.
With the staff of his mouth shall be sley the wicked. Esaias. 11. 2
With the staff of his mouth, etc. That is, with the word of preaching, not
with harness will I destroy Antichrist, 2. Thessa. 2. 8.

All these properties can agree to none but only unto Christ: for it is he
that only touches the hearts of the faithful, and mortifieth their
concupiscences. And to the wicked he is the savor of death, and to them that
shall perish: So that all the world shall be smitten with this rod, which is
his word. Geneua.

What the staff of bread signifies.
When I shall break the staff of your bread. Leu. 26. 26
That is, the strength whereby the life is suffeined: or the force and strength
wherewith it should nourish. As Eze. 4. 16. and. 5. 16.

STAINED CLOTHES.
Look. Edom.

STAR.
What the star was that appeared to the Mages.
THe Star that appeared to ye Mages, Math. 2. 2.
differed from other common stars, three manner of ways: first in place, for
y^ it was set in the lowest part of the air to guide the trauailers the better
and surer on the way. Second in moving, for y^ it is moved not circle wise, but
went right forward as a guide to them, as the cloud and pillar of fire was a
guide unto the children of Israel at their going out of Egypt. Thirdly in
brightness, for that it shined not only in the night as other Stars did but
gave light also even in ye broad day. Wherefore it was no natural star, but
out of all doubt (as Epiphanius says) it was an Angel of God, in the shape of
a starr^. Hemmyng.

How the Moon and Stars are unclean in Gods sight.
And the stars are unclean in his sight. Job. 25. 5.
If God show his power, the Moon and stars cannot have their light, which is
given them, much less can man have any excellency but of God. Geneua.

The seven stars called Pleiades.
Will thou hinder the sweet influence of the seven Stars. Job. 38. 31
Which stars arise when the Sun is in Taurus, which is the spring time, and
bring flowers. Geneua.

How the instructers of the people shall shine as Stars.
And they that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars for
ever, and ever. Deuteronomy. 12. 3
He chiefly means the ministers of Gods word, and next all the faithful
which instruct ye ignorant and bring them to the true knowledge of God. Geneua.

How Stars presage nothing.
Stars presage nothing, for if we should say, they presage good unto us, then
would we think that good comes naturally unto us, and not through the
benefit of God. If they should presage evil, then might it be said that it
comes unto us by the natural influence, and not by the secrets of God.

STEWARD.
Of the unjust Steward.
ANd the Lord commended ye unjust steward. Luke 1^. 8.
This parable does not approve the stewards naughty dealing, for it was very
theft: but Parables are set forth to show a thing covertly, and as it were
under a figure to represent the truth, though it appear not thoroughly with the
matter it self: So that Christ means by this parable to teach us, y^ wordly
men are more heedy in their affairs of this world, then the children of God
are careful for everlasting life. Beza.

God, who does here represent the master of the house, does rather commend the
prodigal wast of his goods, and the liberal giving of the same to the poor,
then the strait keeping and hoording of them. Geneua.

He speaks after the common sort, not that such untruth is praise worthy, but
because it is thought wisdom in the eyes of the world. The Bible note.

STOIKES.
What they were.
THe Stoikes were a kind of learned men, Act. 17. 18
which (wanting the knowledge of God) affirmed that man's whole felicity and
happiness did consist in the qualities and virtues of the mind. The Bible
note.

What certain of their opinions were.
Among other dampnable and false opinions the Stoiks had, this was one: They
did place such power in the Stars, and in their oppositions, that impossible
(they affirmed) it was to change or avoid that which by their constellation
and influence was appointed to come. Insomuch that they held that Jupiter
himself (whom they called the great and supreme God) could neither alter nor
stop the operation of the stars, and the effects that should follow
thereupon. And so they affirmed that the mutation of kingdoms, the honors of
some, the deiection of others, and finally that both vice and virtue were
altogether in the power of the stars. Against this pestilent opinion
straightly and learnedly disputes S. Austen in diverse places, but chiefly in
his first book of that work, entitled, Of the City of God, affirming that
only by the providence of God are kingdoms erected, maintained and changed,
that stars have no power neither to incline man to virtue nor to vice: That
such blasphemies ought to be expelled from the ears of all men. Knox in his
book of Predest, fol. 19.

STONE^
Of the stone that Joshua pitched up.
IT has heard all the words of ye Lord. ^os. 24. 27.
It has heard, etc. That is, it signifies that ye have heard. It left not to
be a stone, nor was so transformed that it had ears, or the sense of hearing,
but should put them in remembrance, what covenant they had made there, and
stir them to the performance thereof, such phrases are familiar to the
Hebrews. T. M.

Of the stumbling stone, and who shall stumble thereat.
And stone to stumble at. Esa. 8. 1^
Some read, and as the Rock to fall upon, to the two houses of Israel: a snare
and net to the inhabitaunts of Jerusalem. And they expound y^ sentence thus:
The Lord will be unto the houses of Israel, that is, to the house of Judah and
to the house of the ten Tribes, partly a sanctifieng, (by which understand
health and felicity) and partly a stone to stumble at. So that some of both
the houses shall be sanctified, and some shall stumble, but ye chiefly they of
Jerusalem shall be snared. Who shall be sanctified, and who shall stumble and
fall, does S. Peter clearly expound 1. Pet. 2. 6. saying, Unto you therefore
which believe, he is precious, but unto them which believe not, the stone which
the builders refused, the same is made y^ head stone in the corner, and a stone
to stumble at. T. M.

What stones in this place signifies.
Thy servant has a love to her stones. Psa. 102. 1^.
Stones here signify the men upon whom the Church is edified as. 1. Pet. 2.
5. And ye as living Stones are made a spiritual house, etc. T. M.

The more that the Church is in misery, the more ought the faithful to love
and pity it. Geneua.

Of the stone cut out of the mountain.
Whereas thou saw that the stone that was cut out of the mountain, Dan. 2.
45.
etc. Meaning Christ, who was sent of God, and not set up by man, whose kingdom
at ye beginning should be small, and without beauty to man's judgment, but
should at length grow and fill the whole earth, which he calls a great
Mountain. As ver. 35. And this kingdom which is not only referred to the
person of Christ, but also to ye whole body of his Church, and to every member
thereof, shall be eternal: for the spirit that is in them is life eternal.
Romans 8. 10.

Who is the corner stone.
The stone which the builders refused, Mat. 21. 42
etc. Christ is called the head stone in the corner, not only because that he
bears up the whole building (that is to say, Corner stone
the Congregation) but because that he does join two walls together in one,
that is to say the Jews and the Gentiles. Sir. I. Cheek.

The same stone which the builders refused, Psa. 118. 22.
etc. The stone is Christ, and the builders such teachers, as taught that he
was unprofitable. Mat. 22. such builders remain yet, and shall do to the
worlds end. T. M.

Who is the stone full of eyes.
For the stone that I have laid before Joshua, Zac. 3. 9.
upon one stone shall be 7. eyes. He shows that the ministers cannot build,
before God lay the first stone, which is Christ, who is full of eyes, Stone
full of eyes
both because he gives light unto all others, and that all ought to seek
light at him. Cha. 4. 10.

STRAIGHT GATE.
What the straight gate does signify.
ENter in at the straight gate. Mat. 7. 13
The straight gate is the true knowledge and understanding of the law, and of
the true intent of works, which whosoever understands, the same shall be
driven to Christ to fetch of his fullness, and to take him for his
righteousness, and fulfilling of the law altogether at the beginning, and as
often as we fall afterward, and for more then the thousand part of our fulfilling
of the law, and righteousness of our best works all our life long, for except
the righteousness of Christ be knit to the best deeds we do, it will be too
short to reach to heaven. Tindale.

We must overcome and mortify our affections, if we will be true disciples of
Christ. Geneua.

Strive to enter in at the straight gate. ^uk 13. 24
We must endeavor and cut of all impediments which may let us. Geneua.

SVBIECTION.
Of Christ's subjection to his father.
THen shall the Son also himself be subject. Not because the Son was not
subject to his Father before, but because his body, that is to say the Church,
which is here in distress, and not yet wholly pertakers of his glory, is not
yet fully perfect and also because the bodies of the Saints, which be in the
graves shall not be glorified unto the resurrection: but Christ, as he is God,
has us subject to him as his father has: but as he is Priest, he is subject
to his father with us. August. b. 1. chap. 2. of the Trinity. Beza.

SVPERSTITION.

SUperstition is a superfluous religion, what ways soever it be superfluous:
Augu. deciuitat. de^ Cap. 30
whether it be of the superfluity of ye things honored, or of the things used
for Religion, or for the manner in Religion. This doubtless is understood by
the name of superstition, from whence soever the name has his beginning.

Whatsoever thou do to please the Almighty, if it be not commanded in his
word, it is superfluous superstition.

SVNNE.
The meaning of this place of Matthew.
THe Sun shall be darkened, Ma. 24. 29.
etc. By the Sun, Christ (which is the son of righteousness) is to be
understood. This Sun has been darkened with the clouds of men's traditions.
Therefore the Moon which is the Church, and has her light of the Sun, must
needs begin to loose her light, yea, and also the stars, that is to say, the
Teachers and Ministers, shall fall from heaven, that is to say, from the
heavenly doctrine and word of God. Sir. I. Cheek.

What it is to regard the rising of the Sun.
Did I ever greatly regard the rising of the Sun, Job. 31. 6
etc. To regard the rising of the Sun, and the going down of y^ Moon, is to
be glorious in prosperity, and to use ye things of this world to pleasure. Ie.
25. 10. For on them that be in prosperity, is the sun counted to shine, and
the Moon to go down preciously and plesantly: and on the contrary part, to
them that be in tribulation, are both the Sun and the Moon, counted cloudie
and dark. T. M.

If I was proud of my worldly prosperity and felicity, which is meant by the
shining of the Sun, and brightness of the Moon. Geneua.

SVPPER OF THE LORD.
Wherefore the Supper was ordained.
THe Supper of the Lord is ordained, first to confirm us, and as it were to
seal us in the same remission of sins, the which we obtain by faith in the
death and passion of Jesus Christ, and the true and spiritual Communion that
we have by the same, with all gifts and graces of the same. The second is, to
yield thanks unto him, and to give testimony of our faith toward him, and
of our charity which we have toward our brethren, and of the union with the
Church. The third, to represent to us by the bread and wine, which are there
distributed, the whole and perfect spiritual nouritour, which we have by the
means of the body, flesh and blood of Jesus Christ, to the end, we may be
spiritually nourished into eternal life, according to our benefit which we
have already received by our regeneration, whereof the Baptime is to us as a
Sacrament, in ye which we have in the Supper, as it were a gage of our
resurrection, the which we do believe and wait for. There even as ye bread
and wine be given unto us visibly and bodily, even so are ye body and blood of
Jesus, given unto us indeed, but invisible and spiritually, by the means of
faith, and by the virtue of the holy ghost, for he is the mean by which we
have true communion and true union with Jesus Christ, and all his Church, the
which is his body, whereof all true Christians be members. Pet. Viret.

Why the Supper of the Lord was called a Sacrifice.
The Supper of the Lord was not called a sacrifice because Christ should be
offered in it, but because he offers and presents himself unto us, and
that we do through faith receive him, and give him thanks for the great
benefit that we have received, by the merits of his death and passion and
blood shedding, confessing and professing, that we hold none other for our
Savior but him, and that we do accept and knowledge none other sacrifice but
his only, for this cause was the Lords Supper called Eucharistia, which word
does signify thanks giving. Thus does S. Austen and all other Doctors of the
Church expound it. Veron. in his b. of Purg.

The Doctors minds upon the Supper of the Lord.
If ye should see the Son of man ascend up where he was before. Job. ^. 62
What is this? By that he resolves those whom he has known: of that he
manifested the thing, whereby they have offended, for they did think that he
would give unto them his body: but he says that he will ascend up into Heaven
all whole, saying: When ye shall see the Son of man ascend where he was
before, at y^ least you shall see then that he does not give his body in the
same manner, as ye think and judge: at the least you shall then understand,
that his grace is not consumed by morsells, etc. Aug. upon S. John, in the 27.
treatise upon the 6. Chapter.

If faith be in us, Christ is in us. For what other thing says the Apostle:
Augustine
Christ dwelling in your hearts by faith, but that through the faith which thou
have of Christ, Christ is in thy heart. August. in his 49. treatise upon Saint
John. 11. Chapter.

After he had ended the solemnity of the ancient Passover, Bid.
the which he made in remembrance of the ancient deliverance out of Egypt: he
passes forth to the new solemnity, y^ which the church desires to celebrate
in remembrance of her redemption, to the end that putting the Sacrament of his
flesh and of his blood under the likeness of bread and wine, Note.
in steed of flesh and of the blood, he shows himself to be him, unto whom
the Lord has sworn and will not repent, Thou art a Priest for ever, etc. It
follows after, because the bread does fortify the flesh, and that the wine
causes the blood in the flesh, the bread is referred mystically to the body of
Christ, and the wine to his blood. Bid upon the 22. Chapter of Saint Luke.

Let us not stay here below on the bread and wine which are set on the Lords
Table, The council of Nice
but let us lift up our spirits on high through faith. Let us consider that the
Lamb of God which takes away the sins of the world, is in that holy Table,
Col. 3. 1. Cor. 6.
which is not offered in sacrifice by the Priests, after the manner of beasts.
And in taking his precious body and his blood, let us believe that they are,
the signs and tokens of our resurrection. And for the same cause, we eat not
much but a little, to ye end we may know y^ the same is not ordained for to
fill our bellyes withal, but for to serve to sanctity and holiness, etc.

How the Lords death is Showed in the supper.
As often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink of this Cup, Latimer in
conferring with Ridley.
ye shall show the Lords death, etc. The Lords death is not showed, except both
parts of the Sacrament be ministered, and because in his death the blood was
divided from the body, it is necessary, that the same division be represented
in the Supper, otherwise the Supper is not a showing of the Lords death.
Latimer.

The meaning of this place of John.
And when the Supper was done. John. 13. 2
There be some which think that it ought to be thus read. And Supper being
prepared, for it may be doubted whether these things were done after the supper
or in supper time. It is very likely, that supper was not fully ended, that is
to say, that the Table was not yet taken away, seeing it follows by and by,
that the Lord took a morsel of bread and offered the same to Judas. Marl.

From whence the wearing of Surplesses came.
NIcholaus Leonicenus says: Isidis Sacerdotes in Aegypto, etc. The Priests of
the Goodesse Isis in Egypt, used to wear linen Surplesses, and evermore had
their heads shaven: which thing seems to have been derived from them unto our
time, from hand to hand. For they that among us minister Gods service, and
serve the holy Altars, are forbidden to suffer the hair of their heads or
their beards to grow, and in their divine service use lynnen garments.
Nicholaus Leonicenus in varia historia. li. 2. ca. 21.

SVSPENTION.
What Suspention is.
SUspention is the censure of the Eldershippe, whereby one is for a time
deprived of the Communion of the Sacraments. Often this sort are forbidden,
which as yet make profession of religion. And in old time among the Jews the
uncircumcised whether they were strangers or Jews. Exo. 12. 48. 49. Thus with
us they were by the same reason to be debarred for a time, which have not
embraced true religion, or embracing make no profession thereof. They also are
put back, which professing religion commit any heinous crime: for thus in
times past the unclean, although not with greatest pollution, were put of for
a time, as namelye those that were unclean by touching of a dead body. Number.
8. which after the same manner ought to be observed with us. Neither it is
doubtful, but when as Christ has warned, that he against whom a brother is
offended should not offer his gift until he were reconciled, if he do it
not of his own free will, if the offense be known, ought to be by the
authority of the Senate, compelled thereunto.

SWEARING.
Why the Jews were suffered to swear by the name of God.
IN the old law, the Jews (in an earnest, just and weighty cause) were
permitted to swear in the name of God, but not by all manner of creatures,
least they dwelling among the Heathen, and accustoming their oaths, should by
continuance of time, fall into the filthy worshipping of their Idols,
forgetting God. Swear by his name (says Moses Deuteronomy. 6. 13.) and see that ye
walk not after strange Gods of the Nations y^ you remain among. So that ye
neither make mention (says Joshua 23. 7.) nor yet swear by the names of their
Gods.

Who swears aright.
They swear justly (being required of the Magistrates) which minding fraud nor
deceit, witnesses only the truth. Which seeks no parcialitie, but the
right, not themselves, but ye glory of God, the profit of their neighbor, and
the Commonwealth of Gods people.

What swearing is lawful.
And swear by his name, Deuteronomy. 10 20.
etc. To swear that which is true in a cause of faith, either to the honor of
God or profit of thy neighbor is lawful, and then will Moses that the oath be
made in ye name of God. By which he means, that if we must needs swear, we
refer the oath to God only, although thou swear by a book, or other thing,
as Paul did by his conscience. Romans 9. 1. T. M.

And shall swear by his name. Deuteronomy. 6. 13
We must fear God, serne him, and confess his name, which is done by swearing
lawfully. Geneua.

To swear by the Lord, and to the Lord, are two things.
And they swear to the Lord, 2. Par. 15. ^4.
etc. To swear unto the Lord, is to give thy self wholly to him with a pure
heart, which thing true worshippers do, as is said of David. Psalm. 132. 2. But
to swear by the Lord, is to call on the name of the Lord as a witness and
Judge, as it is said. Joshua. 2. 12. T. M.

Thou shall not forswear thy self. Mat. 5. 33
As we are forbidden to take the name of God in vain, or to swear by any
manner thing, giving the honor and glory unto creatures, that ought to be
ascribed only to God the Creator, so when we are called before Magistrates, we
may lawfully take an Oath, and swear the Lord lives. Exo. 32. 8. 9. 10. 11.
Deuteronomy. 6. 13. Heb. 4. 3. Rut. 1. 17 1. Reg. 20. 3. Sir. I. Cheek.

All private swearing is forbidden.
Swear not at all (says Christ) but let your communication be yea, Mat. 5. 34
yea, nay, nay. He says twice yea, and twice nay, that is yea in heart,
Private swearing,
and yea in mouth, nay in heart and nay in mouth. And if men when you mean
truly, will not believe you by your yea and nay, Basil.
let them take heed (says S. Basil) ^or they shall taste the pain that
belongs to the unbelievers, therefore it is both foolish and damnable, when a
man cannot be believed by yea and nay without an oath, because he would be
believed to swear. Hierom.
The Gospel (says S. Hierom) permits no manner of private swearing,
because the whole language of a Christian, should be so faithful, true and
perfect, that every sentence thereof shall be able to stand for an oath.

How customable swearing is dangerous.
Of customable swearing comes the damnable vice of peri^^^e. If a man shall
use commonly to swear, Customable swear.
he cannot choose but many times damnably to forswear himself. That a man has
in custome^ he shall do at all times, but he shall not at all times refrain
it.

The Lord (says Moses) will not hold him guiltless, that takes his name in
vain. Deuteronomy. 5. 11. Exo. 20. 7.

A man that uses much swearing, says Jesus Sirach shall be full of
iniquity, Eccl. 23. 11
and never shall the plague depart from his house.

All thieves and swearers are under one curse of God, says Zachary. Zach. 5. 3.


Stoned was he by the law, Leu. 24. 11
that blasphemed the name of the Lord in Israel.

The Doctors against swearing.
Tell unto me my friend (says John Chrisostom) what do^^ thou pro^^te by thy
swearing? Chriso. ^o 44. su. ma
If thine adversary should think thee to swear aright, he would never compel
thee to it, but because he thinks thee thereby to become a peri^rer,
therefore enforces he thee to an oath. Seldom has the private oath a good
conclusion. But happily thou will say, I cannot ^^ll my wares unless I do
swear, or my debtor believes me not, unless I make him an oath. Whereunto I
answer, rather be content to have thy wares unsold, and to loose thy money,
then thy salvation in Christ. Reason faithfully with conscience, and let thy
soul be more dear unto thee; then thy corruptible substance. For though thou
loose part of thy substance, yet may thou live, but if thou loose God, thou
can not live. A greater reward shall thou have, for loosing of it in the
fear of God, then if thou had given it in alms, for that is done in pain
for the love of the Lord, requires a more worthy crown, then that is done
without pain. Moreover I counsel thee as my friend (says Chrysostom) if
thou be a true Christian, that thou never compel any other man to swear. For
whether he swears right or wrong, thou art not without danger before God,
considering that Christ (whose servant thou ought to be) has given thee a
sore commandment to the contrary. Beside that, though his oath were true, yet
is not thy conscience clear from perjury, for so much as the matter being
doubtful unto thee, thou put him to the danger thereof. And if it were
false, then have thou enforced him to perjury, and so for lack of Christen
charity, lost both his soul and thine own, for whom Christ suffered his
death.

Worse is he (says S. Austen) then an homicide, Augustine
that compels a man to swear, whom he knows to forswear himself. For
the homicide slays but the body, whereas he slays the soul, yea, two
souls rather. That is to say, his soul whom he compels to swear, and his
own soul for so compelling him.

Christ has forbidden swearing (says S. Gregory) that we should the more
easily avoid all manner of occasion to perjury, S. Greg. in ho quada^
he that fears God without an oath confesses the verity, he that fears him
not, will not with an oath confess him.

Take heed (says Chrysostom Chrisosto^
) you that be reckened for spiritual men, very swift are ye to offer the
sacred Gospel unto (...) that swear, whereas ye ought to teach the contrary.

If a man may not (says Origin) in every light matter swear, Origin.
no more may they that have authority for every light matter compel a man to
swear. How can you be clean from periutie that ministers the occasion? May
he that bears fire to the burning of an house, be free from the burning of
it? Or he from the slaughter of a man, that brings the weapon wherewith he is
slain? Nay surely^ But he that gives occasion to perjury, must needs be a
partner or the same. Withdraw the fire and there shall be no burning, conueigh
away the sword, and there shall be no murder committed: sequester swering, and
there shall be no perjury.

Often swearing (says Isidore Isidore
) brings man to an vsee and that use leads to a custom, which brings in
perjury. No need has ye veri^ie of an oath, where the promise is faithful and
sure. Isidorus. li. 2. soli loquorum.

Laws made against swearing.
King Henry the 5. Henry the. 5.
made an Act within his own Pallaice, that if he were a Duke y^ did swear, he
should forfet for every (...) ^ xl. s. If he were a Lord or Baron xx. s. A Knight
or Esquire r. s. A Yeonian iii. s. iiii. d. And if he were a Page, Lackey or
Slave, to be scourged naked with a rod or else a whip.

K. Edmund King Edmund
made this law, y^ they which were proved once falsely forsworn should for ever
be separated from Gods congregation.

Donaldus king of Scots made this Act within his land, that all periurers and
common swearers should have their lips scared with a burning hot iron. Which law
S. Lodowike king of France put once in execution at Paris upon a Citizen
there, sor blaspheming the name of Christ, to y^ example of other, and so
caused it to be proclaimed throughout his realm for a general punishment.

Philip Earl of Flaunders made this Constitution within his E^rledome. An.
Dom. 1178. that he that did forswear himself, should loose his life and goods.

How the Pharisees had corrupted swearing.
As to hate in thine heart, Swearing corrupted
or to covet another man's wife was no sin with y^ pharisees, no more was it to
hide one thing in his heart, and to speak another with his mouth, to deceive a
man's neighbor, i^ it were not bo^d by an oath. And though Moses say. Le. 19. lie
not, nor deceive any man his neighbor, yet they interpreted it but good
counsel, if a man desired to be perfect, but no precept to bind under pain of
sin. And so by y^ means not only they that spoke true, but also they y^ lied
to deceive, were compelled to swear and to co^firm their words we oths, if they
would be believed. Tinda.

Of the concealing of swearing.
If a soul sin, Leui. 5. 1.
and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness whether he has seen or
known it, if he do not utter it, he shall bear his sin. This is diversely
expounded, because the Hebrew word has a double signification, this is ye
sense as some thinks: If a Judge do minister an oath to any private man to
declare ye truth of any thing y^ he has seen and do it not, he sins Other
this. If any man see his neighbor commit any sin which is by the law of God
execrable or detestable, and did conceal it, and not open it as much as in him
did lie, he did sin. Some other take it thus: All such as did hear any man
curse, banne and abuse the name of God, and did not open it unto the
Magistrate, did sin: the first sense is best lyked. The By. note.

SVVEATING.
The cause of sweating.
WE will perchance say, that the Sun is hot: yea, but how is the sweat
ingendered? It is because the body is then loosened, and the same loosening do
so open the body, that ye maysture cannot tarry within. Again, when it is cold
weather, the poores are shut up, and the moisture shrinketh inward, to nourish
a man's life, whereas ye contrary is done by heat. Again ye heat ingendereth
feeblenes, and that feeblenes makes humors to melt. And so ye see the cause
of sweating. Ca. up. Job. fol. 686.

SVVEETE.
What is meant by sweet odours.
ANd an offering of sweet odours unto the Lord. Leui. 1. 9
This sweet odor is the Sacrifice of faith and of pure affection, in which
God is delighted, as a man is delighted in the good savor of meats, as it is
said of Noe. Genesis 8. 21. T. M.

How all vice at the first is sweet.
When wickedness was sweet in his mouth. Job. 20. 12
As poison that is sweet in the mouth, brings destruction when it comes
into the body: so all vices at the first is pleasant, but afterward, God
turns it to destruction. Geneua.

SWINE.
What manner of people is here meant by Swine.
NEither cast ye pearls before swine, etc. The swine are they, which for all
they have received the pure gospel of Christ, will yet continue still in
sin, and roll themselves in the puddle and mire of their old filthy
conversation, and both before the ignorant and also the weak, use the
uttermost of their liberty, interpreting it after the largest fashion, and
most favor of the flesh, as it were the Popes pardon, and therewith make the
truth evil spoken off, that thousands which else might have been easily won,
will now not once hear thereof, and stir up cruel persecution, which else
would be much easier, yea, and sometime none at all. And yet will those Swine,
when it comes to the point, abide no persecution at all, but offer themselves
willingly even at the first chop to deny, or they be scarcely apposed of their
doctrine. Therefore lay forth the law of God before them, and call them to
repentance, and if thou see no hope of mending in them, cease there, and go no
farther, for they be swine. Tin.

Which was contrary to Gods commandment. Leuit. 11. 7. Deuteronomy. 14. 8. Geneua.

Eating swines flesh and such abomination, Esa. 66. 17

beasts forbidden, even to the Mouse; which abhors Nature. Geneua.

SVVORD.
To whom the sword belongs to punish.
ALl they that take the sword, Ma. 26. 52^
shall perish with the sword. This ought not to be understood of Magistrates,
which have received of God authority to strike with the sword such as be evil
doers, but of private persons, y^ go about to revenge themselves. Sir. I.
Cheek.

The exercising of the sword, is forbidden to private persons. He (meaning
Peter) would have hindered by his indiscreet zeal the work of God. Geneua.

Who so sheddeth man's blood, Genesis 9. 6
by man shall his blood be shed. Not only by the Magistrate, but oftentimes God
raises up one murderer to kill another. John. 18. 10. Apo. 13. 10.

What is meant by the two swords.
Behold, here are two swords. They were yet so rude, that they thought to have
resisted with material weapons, Luk 22. 38
whereas Christ warns them of a spiritual fight, wherein as well their life
as faith, should be in danger. Geneua.

Put up thy sword into thy sheath: Ma. 26. 52
every one that takes the sword, does perish by the sword. Here it is utterly
forbidden all private reuengment, but that that is done openly by authority of
the public Magistrate is never sound fault withal: but that was private and
extraordinary vengeance that the Apostle Peter was about to have taken
considering y^ he was called to be a Preacher of the word of God, not to be a
Judge, a Captain or a man of war. And against private and extraordinary
reuengment is ye sentence rightly pronounced: Every one that takes the sword,
shall perish by the sword. Bull. fol. 196.

Table.

THou have prepared in my fight a table among them that trouble me. S. Hierome
says, Psa. 23. 4
that the Prophet means by the table that he speaks of here, the Scripture
wherein is found meat, meet for such as are past their fancy in Christ, and
need not any longer to be fed with milk. His words are these in English:
Thou have prepared a table, etc. that I should not be nourished with milk like
a child, but with sound meat: that is, that cudding of holy scriptures with a
spiritual tooth, I might be able to resist the ^coward. Again, he says: Thou
have prepared a table in my presence, against those ye trouble me. A table, y^
is y^ holy scripture. Even as after labor, there is found on the Table comfort
and refection: so also ye holy men, have by y^ means of y^ table, y^ is, y^
holy scripture, consolation and refection, y^ is to say, says, hope and
charity, against those that trouble me. The persecuters of y^ church which are
devils, Jews and heretics: we do in ye holy scriptures, find consolation and
comfort against all these. Hier. in Psa. 23. 4. Albeit his enemies sought to
destroy him, yet God delivers him, and deals most liberally with him, in
despite of them. Ge.

S. Austen says thus: Thou have prepared in my presence a table, Augu. in Psa.
23. 4
that I shall not now be nourished with milk as a little child, but being made
strong against them that trouble me, I may receive greater meat.

Lyra expounding this verse after the letter, thus: Thou have prepared a table
in my presence against those, etc. that is to say, Saul and his accomplices. And
morally he says, it may be expounded thus: In my presence thou have, prepared
a table, that is, a refreshing consolation against them that trouble me with
their temptations, and evil men with injuries. Lyra in Psa. 23. 4.

The meaning of this place following.
Let their table be a snare before them. Psa. 69. 22
He desires God to execute his judgments against the reprobate, which cannot
by any means be turned. Geneua.

TABERNACLE.
Wherefore the Tabernacle was ordained and made so beautiful.
THe Tabernacle was ordained to the intent they might have a place appointed
them to do their sacrifice openly in y^ sight of the people, and namely the
Priests which waited thereon, that it might be seen that they did all things
according to Gods word, and not after y^ Idolatry of their own imaginations.
And the costlines of y^ Tabernacle, and the beauty also pertaining there unto,
ye they should see nothing among the Heathen, but y^ they should see things
more beautiful at home, because they should not be moved to follow them.
Tindale. fol. 9.

Wherefore it was called the Tabernacle of the congregation.
In y^ Tabernacle of ye congregation. Exo. 27. 21
In ye Tabernacle of the congregation, so called, because y^ Israel resorted,
and was gathered together there, at a certain and appointed time: or because
that God resorted thither to speak with Moses and his successors, as before
in the 25. Cha. ver. 22. Nu. 7. 89. Some do translate: In the Tabernacle of
covenant: but the old Interpreter, In the Tabernacle of witness. The Bible
note.

How the Tabernacle was divided.
There was a Tabernacle made before, Heb. 9. 2
etc. There was but one Tabernacle, which was divided into two parts with a
vale, being like to our Churches, where a partition is made between the queere
and the body of y^ Church. This I have added (says M. Chee.) because y^ we
should not think y^ the fathers of y^ old Testament had two tabernacles. It were
meet since that at Christ's death, the vale of the Temple was rent in two, that
there should be no partition at all in the Temples of the Christians. Sir. I.
Cheek.

Wherefore it was called the Tabernacle of witness.
In the Tabernacle of witness. Exo. 27. 21
It is called the Tabernacle of witness, because therein was contained the
covenant and witness where unto that God would that the Children of Israel
should trust. T. M.

Of the Tabernacle of David.
And would build again the Tabernacle of David. The Prophet in this place
prophesied of Christ's coming in ye flesh, which should build again the
Tabernacle of David, which figured Gods Church, but then utterly defaced and
brought to ruin, by the Phari^aicall and Jewish superstitions. The By. note.

The Tabernacle of David, that is, the Church, whereof the Temple was a figure.
Geneua.

Of the feast of Tabernacles.
Look. Feast.

TABITHA.
What the word does mean and signify.
TAbitha, which by interpretation is Dorcas. Tabitha is called Dorcas. Dorcas
signifies a Roe bucke, Act. 9. 36
and beast of sharp sight. Such a one was Tabitha in this effect, that she
being on earth far from heaven, did behold heavenly things and drew near
unto heaven with godly works. The Bible note.

TACIANVS.
Of his heroticall opinions.
TAcian an horrible Heretic Heretic
was famous, which before time was a Christian and disciple of Ius^ine the
Martyr. This man taught y^ matrimony was no better th^n whoredom and
adultery. He forbad also diverse kinds of meats. Cooper.

TALENT.
What a Talent is.
A Talent of silver: the French interpreter following Budaeus, does translate
six hundred crowns, which after the rate of 14. grotes ye crown amounts to
y^ sum of ^^o. pounds. Vd.

Of a talent of fine gold. Exo. 25. 39
This was the talent weight of the Temple, and wayed 120. pound. Geneua.

Which weyed a talent of gold. 2. Reg. 12 30.
That is three score pound after the weight of the common talent. Geneua.

And found it the weight of a talent of gold. 1. Par. 20. 2^
Which mounteth about the value of. 7000. and 70. crowns, which is about
threescore pound weight. Geneua.

And set from thence four hundred and twenty talents of gold. In the. 2. Par.
8. 18. is made mention of thirty more, 3. Re. 9. 20
which seem to have been employed for their wages. Geneua.

Of the pound or talent which the noble man left with his servants.
The money, pound or talent which Christ left with his servants to occupy till
he came, Luke 19. 12
signifies nothing else but a fra^k and free gift given of God to every one of
us, to be used and exercised to the glory of his holy name, and profit of his
faithful congregation. We have nothing as says the Apostle, but that we have
received, as says the Apostle. 1. Cor. 4. 7. What have thou that thou have not
received. And again, James. ^. 17. Every good gift, and every perfect gift is
from above, etc. We be commanded to occupy our Lords money, and not to hide
it and sleep our Masters business, as did the sluggish servant which
suffered tares to be sown among the corn, and also the foolish virgins that
fell on sleep, and let their lamps burn out. Theo. Basil.

TAPERS.
Look. Candles.

TAVGHT OF GOD.
How this place is to be understood.
AND they shall be all taught of God. John. 6. 4^
This instruction of God, is the inward illumination of the heart.
Notwithstanding, we may not hereby take occasion to contemn vocal
predication, and external hearing. For God verily teaches, but yet by
external means: for faith comes by hearing: he gives his good spirit, but
yet by the preaching of the Gospel, he gives increase, but yet by the
planting of Paul, and by the watering of Apollo. Wherefore God teaches, man
ministers, and faith receives doctrine. God gives his spirit, the Apostle
ministers, the believer receives: And so those things are ministered and
distributed by the service of the Apostles, whereof God is the author
himself. This place (All) ought to be restrained to Gods elect, which only
are the natural sons of the Church. Marl. fol. 201.

And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord. Esa. 54. 13.
By the hearing of his word, and inward moving of his spirit. Gene.

TELL NO MAN.
How these two places following are understood.
AND he commanded them that they should tell no man. In this place we are
taught, Mar. 7. 36
when we do any good deed, y^ we should not hunt and hawk after the praise of
men. They therefore that do beer so earnestly spread abroad the benefits and
power of God, sin not against Christ's words. For in other places he
requires thankfulness of us, and that we should always set^ forth the
bounteous liberality of our heavenly father. Theophilactus.

Charged them that they should tell no man what they had seen. MAT. 9. 9.
Christ forbids the Apostles to tell forth the vision, before his rising
again from death, least when men should see him to be crucified, of whom so
excellent and glorious things were spoken, they should therewith be offended,
having his Apostles in dirision ^or telling of such things. Sir. I. Cheek.

TEMPERAVNCE.
What Temperaunce is.
TEmperaunce is a sobriety or modesty of the whole life of man, which Paul
sets against the flesh. Call. 5. 23.
He would therefore that Christians should live soberly and chastely, that they
should be no adulterers, no fornicatours, no wantons. And if they cannot live
chastely he would have them to marry. Also that they should not be covetous,
nor quarrellers, that they should not be given to drunkenness or sur^etting,
but that they should abstain from all those things. Luther. fol. 262.

TEMPLES.
Wherefore Temples or Churches are ordained.
MY house shall be called the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of
thieves. Mat. 21. 13
For this final cause or end, are y^ temples of christians ordained, that they
may have some convenient places to assemble themselves together, for to offer
with one accord their Sacrifices of prayers and thanksgiving unto God, for to
preach and hear Gods word, and for to minister the Sacraments duly and
rightly: but if there be hypocrisy, superstition, and false doctrine, the
people are robbed and spoiled, and the Temples made dens of thieves. Sir. I.
Cheek.

Is this house become a den of thees. Iere. 7. (...)
As thieves hid in holes and dens think themselves safe: So when you are in
my Temple, you think to be covered with the holiness thereof, and that I cannot
see your wickedness. Geneua.

How God dwells not in Temples made with hands.
Where shall now the house stand that ye will build unto me, Esaias. 66. ^
etc. As who should say: whereto make ye me a Temple of man's handy work, which
rule the whole world, hither to have I suffered the temple, to keep you Jews
in a certain manner of instruction and obedience: and choose you one place for
your service, to the intent ye should not fall to the Idols of the Gentiles,
but now will I have all Idols banished, and for Iewry, will I challenge unto me
the whole world, for one people all the dwellers on the earth, which shall be
my worshippers in the spirit and truth. John. 4. 23. I will not be
superstitiously worshipped with sacrifices and ceremonies in the temple, but
with righteousness, with faith, and with the spirit.

The same song that the Prophet here sings in the latter end of his
Prophecy, sung he before in the beginning even in the first chapter. Let the
Christians note these two Chapters, (I mean the first and the last) well, and
then shall they perceive how greatly God abhors such hypocritish works done
without faith, although they seem and appear outwardly to be most godly. T. M.

My majesty is so great, that it fills both heaven and earth, and therefore
cannot be included in a temple like an Idol, condemning hereby their vain
confidence, which trusted in the temple and sacrifices. Geneua.

The most highest dwells not in temples made with hands. Act. 7. 48.
He reproves the gross dullness of the people, which abused the power of God,
in that they would have contained it within the temple. Geneua.

How long the temple was a building, and what Christ meant by the temple.
When the Jews asked of Christ what marvelous sign he would work, to
persuade them that he might do such as he did, he said: Destroy this Temple
(meaning his body) and in three days I will build it up again. Then they
understanding he had meant the Temple of lime and stone, said: Forty year^ was
this Temple a building, and will thou build it in three days. Here we see how
the Temple was a building fortye years, not meaning that they were continually
working on the same so long (for sometimes it was forbidden and stopped by the
kings that ruled after Cyrus) but that there were so many years from the
beginning of that work, unto the finishing of the same. For in the second
year of king Cyrus they laid the foundation, and in the second year of
Darius (the son of Assuerus and Ester) they were willed by Aggeus the
Prophet, to take in hand their work again, which they finished in the sixth
year of the same Darius. So that from ye second year of Cyrus unto the. 6.
year of Darius, were. 46. years, wherein they were a building.

The meaning of this place following.
I will worship toward the holy Temple, etc. Both the temple and ceremonial
service at Christ's coming were abolished, so that now God will be worshipped
only in spirit and truth. Geneua.

Of them that trusted in the outward service of the Temple.
Trust not in lyeng words, saying: The Temple of the Lord, Iere. 7. 4.
the Temple of the Lord, etc. Believe not the false Prophets, which say that
for the temples sake and the sacrifice there, the Lord will preserve you, and
so nourish you in your sin and vain confidence (for in the next verse after)
God shows on what condition he made his promise to this temple: y^ they
should be an holy people unto him, as he would be a faithful God unto them.
Geneua.

How Churches or Temples are not to be builded to Saints.
Saint Austen in his book De imitat. S. Austen.
Dei says plainly, we build no Temple unto our Martirs. And again in his
first book against Maximinus, a Bishop of the Arrians, if we should (says he)
build a Church of timber and stones unto some excellent holy Angel, should we
not be accursed by the truth of Christ and the Church of God? Therefore if we
should commit sacrilege in making a temple to every creature whatsoever: how
may it be that God is not true unto whom we make no Temple, but we our
selves are a Temple for him. Bullinger. fol. 1127.

How the Pope does sit in the temple of God, as God.
Compare the commandments of God with the constitutions of men, Bilney.
and you shall easily understand y^ the Bishop of Rome, whom they call the
Pope, to sit in the temple of God as God, and to be extolled above all that is
named God. It is written: 1. Cor. 3. 17
The Temple of the Lord is holy, which is you. Therefore the conscience of man
is the temple of the holy Ghost, in which Temple I will prove the Pope to sit
as God, and to be exalted above all that is called God. For who so contemns
the Decalogue, or the Table of the ten commandments of God, there is but a
small punishment for him, neither is that punishment to death: but contrariwise
he that shall contemn or violate (speaking to Friar Brusiard) the
constitutions which you call the sanctions of men, is counted by all men's
judgments guilty of death, what is this but the Bishop of Rome, to sit and to
reign in the Temple of God, that is, in man's conscience as God. Bilney in the
book of Mar. fol. 1140.

TEMPTATION.
What Temptation is.
TEmptation is nothing else, but to take proof or trial of any thing,
wherefore the end of temptation is rightly called knowledge: And they which
will pass over a water, do try out the shallowe places to know the depth of
the water: wounds also are tried of Surgions, to feel the deepenesse of them:
In tempting therefore, knowledge is sought. But God needs not that new and
fresh knowledge, for such is his nature that he knows all things most
perfectly. But when he tempts, he only does it to lead men to the knowledge
of those things which they ought to know. Wherefore when he sometime tempts
good and holymen, he brings into light and makes open the faith, obedience^
strength, and godliness, which before lay hid in their hearts, that they
which see the same things, might glorify God the author of them. And that
they which are so tempted, when they have gotten the victory, may give thanks
and desire of him, that even as he has done now, so he would vouchsafe to
help them continually in temptations. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 33.

How temptation generally is not evil.
All temptations or trial is not evil: For God tempted his servants: One
friend is tempted of an other: The child is tried by the Father: the wife by
her husband: the servant by his Master, not that they might be hurt by
trial, but rather that they might thereby be profited. The Devil also
tempts, whereupon also he is called a temptor in the Scripture. Also enemies
use to tempt, not to profit thereby, but to hurt and destroy. This kind of
temptation is wicked. Therefore the Lord has exhorted us to beware of those
which tempt with an evil mind, Mat. 10. 16
when he wills us not only to be innocent as Doves, but also wise as
Serpents. Marlo. upon John. fol. 283.

The Israelites are rebuked of Moses for tempting the Lord.
Wherefore do ye tempt the Lord. Exo. 17. 2.
Why distrust you God? Why look ye not for succor of him, without murmuring
against God. Geneua.

How God tempts no man to evil.
God tempts not unto evil. James. 1. 13
Almightye GOD has ever tempted and proved his elect by trouble and
persecution, and by nur^uring them with outward plagues, nevertheless he does
it not unto evil, but for good, namelye, because he loves them, and will have
their faith exercised. Thus tempted he Abraham. Genesis. 22. ^. and the
Israelites. Deuteronomy. 8. 2. As for temptation, that we pray in our Pater noster,
to be delivered from it, is the (...) and concupiscence of our flesh, whereby
we are entised unto evil. Tindale.

This word to Tempt is taken two manner of ways, first it ^etokeneth to
entice a man to evil, after this saying we say, that God tempted no man. For
as GOD is of his own nature good, and can^e in no wise be entised to evil, so
does he move or entice no man to sin, which he himself does detest: and
abhor, Here we learn, that if we sin, we ought not to put the fault in
God, but in our own selves. Secondly, this word to Tempt, is taken for to
prove: As when we say: God tempted Abraham. Genesis 22. 1. And that he did
tempt the Israelites. Deuteronomy. 8. 2. that is to say, did prove Abraham, and tried
the Israelites, whether they loved him or not. Sir. I. Cheek.

Of the Pharesies and Saduces tempting of Christ.
Then came the Pharesies and Saduces to tempt him. Mat. 16. 1^
To try whether he could do that which they desired, but their purpose was
naught, for they thought to find some thing in him by that means, whereupon
they might have just occasion to reprehende him. Or distrust and curiositye
moved them so to do, for by such means also is God said to be tempted, that
is to say provoked to anger, as though men would strive with him. Beza.

Men tempt God, either by their incrudelitie or curiosity. Geneua.

How Christ is tempted of the Devil.
To be tempted of the Devil. Math. 4. 1^
To the end he ouercomming these temptations might get the victory for us.
Geneua.

Christ is by and by after Baptime tempted, which thing we must look for. Yea,
the more we shall increase in faith and virtuous living, the more strongly
will Satan assault us. Sir. I. Cheek.

When the devil had ended his temptations, he departed from him for a season.
Luke. 4. 13
If at any time we overcome Satan through the grace given us of God, let us not
therefore be proud, or think that we are not without peril, but rather let
us be circumspect and wary, for Satan will come upon us again, as be did upon
Christ, whom (after he had been overcome by him,) he tempted many ways by
his limbs. Sir. I. Cheek.

It is not enough twice or thrice to resist Satan, for he never cease to
tempt. Or if he relent a little, it is to the end that he may renew his force,
and assail us more sharpelye. Geneua.

God suffers none to be tempted above his strength.
But shall with the temptation make a way to escape, 1. Cor. 10. 13
etc. He that led you into this temptation, which comes unto you either in
prosperity or adversity, or for your sins past, will turn it to your
commodity, and deliver you. Geneua.

TEN.
What the number of ten signifies.
AND ye shall have tribulation for ten days. That is to say, many days. For
it betokens that the Church shall be in continual warfare under the cross
of persecution. For the number of ten, is the number of fullness: and therefore
it is not to be observed too nicely. So said Jacob to his father in law:
Behold thou have changed my wages ten times. Ge. 31. 7. And in an other place
it is said: They have tempted me now ten times. Nu. 14. 22. Also, behold, ye
have offered me reproach ten times. Job. 19. 3. That is to say, oftentimes and
sundry ways. Marl. upon the Apoc. fol. 42.

What the ten horns do signify.
Ten horns. Apoc. 13. 1
The ten horns do signify many provinces. Geneua.

How the ten commandments are divided into two Tables.
It is certain (faith Ambrose) that the first commandment is contained in
this: Thou shall have none other Gods but me. The second: Thou shall not make
thy self any likeness of any thing that is in heaven, etc. The third: Thou
shall not take the name of thy Lord God in vain: The fourth: Thou shall
observe my sabbath days. The fifth: Honor thy father, etc. But because these
first four precepts pertains unto god, they must be understood to be
contained in the first table. The rest pertains to men, as to honor thy
parents, not to kill, not to commit fornication, not to steal, to bear no
false witness, to covet nothing of thy neighbors. These six commandments
seems to be written in the second table, whereof the first is: Honor thy
Father, etc. Thus much Ambrose. Musc. fo. 36.

Of the ten virgins.
Look. Saints.

TENTS.
How Tents were first invented.
IVbal the son of Lamech by Ada his wife, Genesis 4. 20.
first made the po^tatiue tents for to feed his cattle and ordered his
flocks, disseuering the sheep from the goats, and found out y^ certain time
when the Rams should be put to the Ewes, and taught it other. Lanquet.

Of three manner of tents.
That they defile not their tents, Nu. 5. 3.
among which they dwell. There were three sorts of tents among the Hebrews. The
tent of the Lord, that is the Tabernacle: The tent of the Leuite, and the tent
of Israel The lepers were excluded them all. The impure of an issue from the
two first, and the defiled by the dead, only from the Tabernacle of the
congregation. The Bible note.

TEARS.
Whereof tears comes.
THe natural Philosophers agree not among themselves in this matter. Some do
think that tears do come by reason of the gall being troubled, unto which
opinion agrees y^ first book De mirabilibus sacrae Scripture, the. 10. cap.
which book is entitled to be Augustines writing. Other suppose the^ to be a
certain kind of sweat, which Plutarch affirms, but some do think, that
even as from milk is separated whaye, so also a watrish humor is separated
from blood, whereof the greater part turns into urine, and y^ which remains
is thrust forth into tears. Lastly Seneca in his. 100. Epistle to Lucillus,
thinks that with the stroke of grief and sorrow the whole body is almost
shaken, and there withal the eyes, out of ye which eyes the humor lieng nigh
unto them, is expressed. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fo. 62.

The meaning of these places following.
My tears have been my meat day and night. Psa. 42. ^
As other take pleasure in eating and drinking, so he was altogether given to
weeping. Geneua.

Put my tears in thy bottell. Psalm. 56. 8.
If God keep the tears of his Saints in store, much more will he remember
their blood to avenge it, and although tyrants burn the bones, yet can they
not blot the tears and blood out of Gods register. Geneua.

And the Lord God will wipe a way ye tears from all faces. Psalm. 25. 8
He will take away all occasions of sorrow, and fill his with perfect joy.
Apoc. 7. 17. 21. 4. Geneua.

And covered the altar of the Lord with tears. Ye cause the people to lament,
because that God does not regard their sacrifices, so that they seem to
sacrifice in vain. Geneua.

TEREBINT.
The meaning of this place following, and the nature of the tree.
AS y^ Terebint have I stretched out my branches. Eccl. 24. 18
The Terebint is a hard tree spread abroad with long boughs, whereout runs
the gum called a pure Turpentine, which cleanse the stomach of putrified
humors, and purifieth y^ ears: so the wisdom of God declared in his
Scriptures, spreads abroad her manifold branches of knowledge and
understanding, to purge the inward ears and corruption of the soul. The Bible
note.

TERTVLIANIST AE.
What Heretics they were.
THese men denied second marriage, Heretics
and said that the souls of wicked men became devils after their departure out
of this life, and that the soul is continued, by going from one into an other,
as much to say, by carnal descent and succession. Aug.

TESTAMENT.
What a Testament is.
TEstament, is an appointment made between God and man, and Gods promises.
Tindale. fol. 6.

TETRARCHA.
What Tetrarcha were.
TEtrarchia or Tetrarcha, Math. 14
are words usurped of the Roman writers, but taken from y^ Greeks. Tetrarcha
were princes having the fourth part of some portion of the kingdom. Such are
they which we cast deputies or presidents. The Romans dividing their kingdoms
to suppress rebellion limited y^ same to diverse presidents or governors which
they called Tetrarchae or Toporchae, and the regions themselves, Toporchas or
Tetrarchas, the which thing we may read in Pliny. Mar. fo. 305

TEVDAS.
Look. Theudas.

THAMAR.
Wherefore she is reckoned in the Genealogy of Christ.
Only such women are named in the Genealogy of Christ, Math. 1. 3
as the Scripture does openly reprove, y^ we seeing Christ to be borne and come
of sinners touching the flesh, might believe that he would be merciful unto
sinners. Sir. I. Cheek.

And Judas begat Phares, Math. 1. 3
and Zara of Thamar. By incestuous adultery, y^ which shame sets forth his
great humility, who made himself of no reputation, but became a servant for
our sakes yea, a worm, and no man, the reproach of me^, and contempt of the
people, and at length suffered y^ accursed death of ye cross. Ge.

How Thamar is thought to be David's natural daughter, and was not.
When Thamar had dressed meat for Adon^a her brother, 2. Re. 13. 10
and brought it unto him, he took her and would have lien with her, to whom
she said: Oh nay my brother do not force me, but rather speak unto the king,
and he will not deny me unto thee. This seems to be against the law of Moses,
where it is forbidden, the brother to marry y^ sister, Leui. 20. 17
whether she be y^ daughter of his father, or y^ daughter of his mother: to
this it is answered thus: David took y^ mother of Thamar in battle, and had her
home to his house, Deu. 21. 10
and shaued her head, and let her nails grow, which thing being do^e according
to y^ law, he took her to his wife, who nevertheless was then great with
child by the husband which she had afo^e, having in her womb this Thamar, so
that she was not the natural daughter of David, and therefore Ammon his son
might take her to his wife by the law. Lyra.

THAMMVZ.
What this Thammuz was.
AND behold there sat women mourning (...) Thammuz. Exo. 8. 14.
The Jews say this was a Prophet of the Idols, who after his death was once a
year mourned for in y^ night only of women. Saint Hierome takes it for
Adonis Venus lover. Other think it was Osiris an Idol of the Egyptians. The
Bible note.

Thammuz, that is after S. Hierome Adonides Amasius which was Venus fairest
son, which is fained to have risen from death to life, which fable the women
of Iewrie did celebrate and hold solemn, both with mirth and tears. Some
say that it was an Image which was made to weep by craft. Before this Image
did women also bewail their separation from their lovers, and reioysed when
they obtained them again. T. M.

THANK OFFERING.
What Thank offering is.
WHen ye will offer a thank offering unto the Lord. Leuit. 22. 29
Thank offering that is, an offering of thanks giving. Thanks giving is when
the benefits of God are recited, whereby the faith to Godward is strengthened
the more fastly to look for the thing that we desire of God. Ephe. ^5. 4. 1.
Tim. 4. ^. T. M.

True thanks giving is an acknowledging and confessing of the benefits
received, together with a thankfulness of mind, and a publishing of Gods
goodness. Tindale.

THARSIS.
What Tharsis is thought to be
Jonas made himself ready to fly to Tharsis, etc. Under y^ name of Tharsis (as
some think) is signified some sea y^ was far of, and whose voyage was very
long: so that the sailers therein could see nothing but the sea and the air.
Ioppa is an haven of Iewry, where was sometime a goodly city, of which there
remains now but a portion. T. M.

For the king had on the sea the navy of Tharsis. Psa. 72. 10.
By Tharsis is meant Cilicia, which was abundant in variety of precious
things. 2. Par. 9. 21. Psalm. 48. 7. Geneua.

The kings of Tharsis and of the Isles. Of Cilicia and of al other countries
beyond the seas, which he means by the Isles. Ge.

THEBVLIS.
What his Heresy was.
THebulis, Anno Domini. 110. was the first heretic Heretic.
in the Church of Jerusalem. He fell from the faith because they would not
choose him Bishop after Simeon. Euse. li. 4. chap. 21.

THEFT.
What Theft is.
THeft is, when we withhold that which is an other man's against y^ owners will,
or when we by injury draw unto us other men's goods: or when we distribute not
that which is ours when need requires. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 45.

THEMA.
What Thema was.
THey y^ went to Thema. Job. 6. 19.
Thema was one of y^ twelve princes of Israel, and inhabited the South part of
Arabia, of whom the region was called Thema. By the which men pass into the
whole country of Arabia, thinking to find water there to quench their thirst,
but they are deceived. The Bible note.

THEODOTVS.
What his heresy was.
THeodotus a Montanist through sorcerie took his flight toward heaven,
Heretic.
but down he fell and died miserably. Euse. li. 5. chap. 14.

THERAPHIM.
What this Theraphim was.
THey made also Theraphim. Iudic. 17. 5
Touching the signification of this word ( Theraphim) there is great ambiguitie
among the expositours. But I understand it to be that Idol which they had
graven and molten, when all the other things were ready which served for
Idolatry, they at the length brought that Image unto the Temple. And of these
Theraphims or Images, they were wont in the old time to ask Oracles. In
Genesis we read that Rachel the wife of Jacob, stale away the Theraphim of her
Father. And in the first of Samuel, the. 19. chapter, when David escaped,
Michol put in his bed Theraphim. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic.

Theraphim, is thought to be an Image, made to the shape and figure of a man,
and also to signify all other instruments belonging to their false religion.
The Bible note.

THEVDAS.
Of his rebellion.
THeudas (in ye time y^ Caspius was president of Iewry) persuaded the people to
take their goods; Act. 5. 36.
and to follow him to Iordane, for there he bare them in hand he would with a
beck divide y^ waters, y^ they might be dry shod, and so recover their
liberty, and set them free from bondage of the Romans, to whom the foolish
people ob^ieng, when they looked in vain for the miracle, were all slain.
Hemmyng.

This was one of ye false deceivers y^ Christ prophesied should come in his
name. Mat. 24. Of this Theudas Josephus makes mention in his. 20. book and.
4. chapter of the Antiquities.

This Theudas was about thirty years before him, of who^ Josephus mentions
in his. 20. book De antiqui. cap. 4. that was after ye death of Herod the
great, when Archelaus his son was at Rome, at what time Judea was full of
insurrectio^s: so that it is not sure so give credit to Eusebius in this point.
Genesis

THIATRIA.
What Thiatria was.
THiatria is a city of Lidia, Apoc. 1. 11
which is a shire in Asia ye less, ye inhabitation of the Macedones, and
called of some the last city of the Misians. This word Thiatria betokens y^
strong fume or sacrifice of labor or painfulnes^ Look. Act. 16. 14. Ma. fo. 19

THINK.
How of our s^lues we cannot think well.
NOr y^ we are sufficient of our selves to think any thing, as of our selves.
If any man does affirm, or holds opinion, that a man can by the strength of
his own nature think a good thought perteining to his salvation, or y^ he can
without the inspiration of the holy Ghost consent or agree to the wholesome
preaching of the Gospel, he is deceived by an heretical spirit, (...)
^ understands not the words of Christ, (...): Without me, ye can (...)
nothing, nor that saying of Paul, We are not sufficient, etc. The Council of
Mil.

Look S. Barnards exposition of this place in Freewill.

How our sins shall not be thought upon with God.
They shall not be thought upon, Eze. 18. 2^
etc. The sophisters have a proper solution for this text and such like, which
testifies y^ God so forgiueth that he will not after call again his forgiveness
and punish. True it is (say they) God forgiueth the sin, but not the punishment
due unto sin. Seven years punishment (as they pray) must we abide in
Purgatory for every sin who^ it is forgiven. If this be not to mock with God
and his holy word, I wot not what is mo^king. If God can, and do (as they
affirm) give me punishment due unto my sin, so that he neither give me too
much nor too little pain therefore, and yet not once think on my sin, surely
he has a wonde^ fult remembrance. And that he will not think on it the text
does here plainly affirm. By this sophistry might the king give a man pardon
for his theft, and after ha^g him up. For he might say, Sir, I forgave you your
theft, but not your hanging which is due unto it. Such pardon would they be
lo^h^to have that first imagined it. If the king which is but a man be more
faithful then to deal so with prisoners whom he forgiueth: how should God
then which is our heavenly Father, and which is even goodness it self, have
such a subtle and imperfect forgiveness, that should after punish. But hereof
will I now speak no more, least ye should happily smell y^ this solution were
imagined to pick men's purses, through Mass pence, Dirge grotes, Trentals,
yearemindes, month minds, etc. Because that although God can and may forgive
ye sin, yet must such things obtein the forgiveness of the punishment
thereunto, or that the Priests benefits were not sufficient for them to live on
without such pillage: Or yet that the poor people could by any other means
be milked from that thing, wherewith their wives, their householde, and
children should live. T. M.

THIS IS MY BODY.
The interpetation of these words.
TRuth it is indeed that the words be as plain as may b^ spoken, Mat. 26. 26
but that the sense is not so plain, it is manifest to every man that wayeth
substancially the circumstances of the place. For when Christ gave bread to his
Disciples and said: This is body, there is no man of any discretion, that
understands the English tongue, that he may well know by the order of the
speech, that Christ spoke those words of the bread, calling it his body: As all
the old authors also do affirm, although some of the Papists deny the same.
Wherefore this sentence cannot mean as the words seem and purport, but there
must needs be some figure or mystery in the speech, more then appears in y^
plain words. For by this manner of speech plainly understood without any
figure as the words do lie, can be gathered none other sense, but that bread
is Christ's body, and that Christ's body is bread, which all christian ears do
abhor to hear. Wherefore in these words must needs be sought out an other
sense and meaning, than the words of themselves do bear. Look. Bread, how it
is called Christ's body. Cranmer:

Druthmarius expounds these words, (This is my body) on this manner: that is
to say, this is my body in a mystery. I. Frith. fol. 134.

This is my body. Mat. 26. 26
This is a figurative speech which is called M^tonymia, y^ is to say, the
putting of one name for another, so calling the bread his body, which is a
sign and Sacrament of his body: And yet notwithstanding it is so a figurative
and changed kind of speech, that the faithful do receive Christ indeed
with all his gifts, though by a spiritual manner, and become one in him. Beza.

The thing which signifies has of custom ben called of the name of the thing
which it signified, Augustine.
as it is written, the seven ears, are seven years: ye scripture says not y^
they signify seven years. And y^ seven kine, are seven yers, and many things.
In like manner S. Paul says, that the Rock was Christ, and not that it
signified Christ, but as it had been him in very deed: y^ which notwithstanding
was not Christ by substance, but by figuration. August. upon Leuiticus.

When God gave the Circumcision to Abraham, Dea(...)
he made his counenaunt before the Circumcision, and yet he calls the
Circumcision his covenant or alliance saying, Hoc est pactum meum, This is my
covenant. S. Paul expounding the same, saying: Abraham has received the
sign of Circumcision, as a seal of the righteousness of faith. God said to
the Prophet Ezechiel, Thou Son of man, take a tyle stone, and lay it before
thee and describe upon it y^ city of Jerusalem. After he says: This same is
Jerusalem. Denis in the ecclesiastical Hierarch.

THOMAS.
How Thomas and Didimus is one name.
THen said, Thomas which is called Didimus. Ioh. 11. 16
In that he says Thomas was called Didimus, is not so to be understood as
though Thomas were his proper name, and Didimus his surname. For the same which
the Greeks call Didimus, the Hebrews call Thomas. Marl. upon John. fol. 405.

How he was reproved for his unbelief.
Look. Happy.

Of his death and martyrdom.
Thomas, as it has been delivered unto us (says Dorotheus) preached the
Gospel of our Savior Christ Jesus, unto the Parthians, Medes and Persians. He
preached also unto the Caramans, Hircans, Bactrians and Magitians. He rested at
Calamina a City in India being slain with a Darte, which they call a Spear
or Iau^lin, where he was also honouradly buried. Dorotheus. fol. 532.

THOVGHTS.
How every thought is not sin.
WE teach not that every thought is sin, but every evil thought that rises
in the heart of man, and is not resisted, but with delight followed, although
it be not accomplished in act, the same is deadly and damnable, if it be not
repented. Mat. 5. 28. 1. John. ^. 8.

But there (...) between these thoughts which our will (...) ^and with love
imbraceth: Hiero. ad Demetr(...) de virgi^^
and these ^ogitations which after the man(...) of a dark shadow, are wont to
pass over the mind, and but even only in passing over to show themselves,
which the Greeks call Tulous, y^ is a bare or naked (...) or shadowing of any
thing or at y^ least between those which came into the mind, with a certain
(...) resists. For y^ loss of y^ which, as it sorroweth, so it reioy^eth y^
they are driven out. In those truly which show the^ selves softly to the mind,
and do declare them as it were flieng away^ the^ is neither sin at all, nor
yet battle. But in these with y^ which for a spa^e the soul strives,
against y^ which the will resists, there is an equal fight: for either we
cons^nt and are overcome, or else we withstand and do overcome, and in battle
get the victory.

Some therefore are ye children of ye world, and yet are not the children of ye
devil. For albeit the devil is the author and chiefs worker of all sin, yet
all sin do not make men y^ children of the devil. For y^ children of God do sin
also, for if they say they have no sin, they deceive themselves, and truth is
not in them but by y^ means they sin, by the which they are yet the children
of this world, but in y^ respect y^ they are ye children of god, they sin not
at all, for every one that is borne of God sins not. But unbelief makes
the child of the devil, which sin is called their own, as though it were
alone, if it be not expressed what manner of sin it is. I. Gough.

The meaning of this place followi^g.
That the thoughts of many may be opened. Duke. 2. 35^
That is, many shall show themselves openly to be Christ's enemies. And many
again shall confess Christ, yea, and that with utter peril and shedding of
their blood. Hemmyng.

This chiefly appears when the Cross is laid upon us, whereby men's hearts
are tried. Geneua.

THRESHING.
Of two manner of threshing.
THe Hebrews have 2. words, Dash, which signifies to thresh, but yet then when
we occupy to threshing beasts. The other word is Chabat, which is also to
thresh, but yet with ^lailes and without beasts. Pet. Mar. upon. Iudic. fol.
114.

What is meant by threshing of the mountains.
Thou shall thresh the mountains. I will make thee able to destroy thi^e
enemies be they never so mighty, Esa. 41. (...).
and this chiefly is referred to the kingdom of Christ. Geneua.

Whereto the threshing of Gilead is compared.
Because they have threshed Gilead, Amo^. 1. 3.
etc. If the Sirians shall not be spared for committing this cruelty, against
one City, it is not possible that Israel should escape punishment which hate
committed so many and grie^ous sins against God and man, Genesis

THVNDER.
What the cause is that makes thunder.
THunder is a sound, caused in the clouds, by ye breaking out of a hot and
dry exhalation, boating against the edge of the cloud. It is heard in Spring
and Summer, by reason of the heat of the Sun, that then draws up many
exhalations, which meeting in the middle region of the air, with cold and
moist vapors, are together with them enclosed in a hollow cloud. But when the
hot exhalation cannot agree with the coldness of the place, by this ^^ri^e
being driven together made stronger and kindeled, it will needs ^reake out with
soda^^e and violent eruption, causes the noise which we call thunder. A
similitude is put by great Authors of moist wood, y^ cracketh in the fire, we
may add hereunto the breaking of an Egg in the fire, of an Apple or any like
thing, for what soever holds and withholdeth enclosed any hot wind, so that
it cannot have no vent, it will seek it self a way by breaking the skin,
shell, or case. It were no evil comparison to liken Thunder to the sound of a
Gun^ which be both caused of the same or very like causes, etc. W. F.

Thunder after the opinion of Aristotle, is a natural thing. Facta tamen (^t
^nqule) secundu^ natu^ ^ordinatam. Nevertheless (says he) yet a thing of an
uncertain and doubtful nature, or of a ^sordred nature. This thundering is
nothing else but a crack and a rsibling in ye clouds, y^ cause efficient being
ye sun and the planets, the cause material being the h^t and dry exhalations,
seeking a way out of y^ clouds. In the scripture, both in the old testament and
in the new there is often mention made of thundering, which God miraculously
sent down from heaven above. In the 9. of Exo. ve. 23. God plagued K. Pha^^o
because he would not let ye children of Israel depart out of Aegipt, with thu^der,
lightning and hail stones. In the 1. Reg. 7. 1. Re. 7. 10
When y^ Philistines made war against y^ Israelites, thinking to have
destroyed them all, the Lord with a sudden great Thunder crack, did make the
Philistines so sore afraid, that they ran away and were slain the most part
of them. Ioh. 12. 29
Also in the new Testament. John. 12. Christ a little before he should suffer
his Passion, prayed unto his Father saying: Father, deliver me from this hour,
but therefore came I into this hour, O Father glorify, and set out thy name,
thy might, and power. And immediately, there came a voice from heaven saying on
this wise: Glorifica^i, and iterum glorificabo. I have glorified it, and I will
glorify it. As he might say: I have glorified it in thee my son, since the
first hour of thine Incarnation, with manifest and wonderful great miracles,
Et iterum glorificabo, and I will glorify my name in thee, after the time of
thy glorious Resurrection, and Ascension, more then ever I have done, through
the comfort of the Holy ghost, which shall so work in the hearts of men, that
then shall my name in thee my son Christ, begin to flourish in such wise, as
it never did before. When this voice was heard, there was such a stout noise
heard from heaven, that the people that followed Christ Dixerunt: Tonitrium
factum esse. They said it was a Thunder. Such a Thunder was heard upon the day
of Pentecost, at the coming down of the Holy ghost. Now here is to be noted,
that the Thundering of God mentioned in the old Testament, were ever to fraye
and to make men aghast: but the Thundering of God mentioned in the new
Testament, were so tempered that they did not fear, but comfort men, wherein
is manifestly declared a Majesty, to be both in the Law and in the Gospel:
but yet the one to drive us to God for fear of the rod, and the other with
the love of everlasting reward to embrace Christ. Of whom the words of the
Prophet David. Psalm. 18. be verefied, as well in y^ letter, as in the
Allegory, when he says: Intonuit de coelo Dominus, and altissimus dedit vocem
suam: Psa. 18. 13
The Lord from heaven has thundered, and the highest has declared his voice.
Ric. Turnar.

The Lord also thundered out of heaven, etc. Psa. 18. 13
By all the things here rehearsed, is described the power, might and majesty
of almighty God which he declares in tempests, of which the whole 29. Psalm.
entreats. And in Job. 37. are like things mentioned to y^ setting out of his
power. Oftentimes we read, that when he would more openly and more expressly
declare his power unto men, caused thunder, lightening and earthquakes, etc. As
in Exo. 19. 16. when the law was given. 1. Reg. 12. 18. when the people desired
a king. Mat. 27. 51. when Christ was on y^ Cross. Act. 2. when the Holy ghost
came upon the Apostles. Act. 4. 3^. when they prayed. With such like words do
some suppose, that God did at one time or other show his benefit to David, and
confirmed his promises with shaking y^ earth, sending thunder, lyghtening,
hayle, clouds, storms, and other terrible tokens, wherewith he holy David and
overthrew his enemies. Neither lets it y^ the Scripture mentions not
thereof in any place, for it mentions not the Tempest which Esaias prophesied
to come in the deliverance of Jerusalem from the Assyrians, yet who will
deny but that it was in very deed so done. T. M.

TIME.
The meaning of this place following.
MY time is not yet come. Some interpret this of the time of Christ's death, but
not aptly: John. 7. (...).
for he speaks of y^ time of his departure, and affirms that he differs
from his kinsmen in this, y^ they might without danger, come forth at all
hours in the face of y^ world, because they have y^ world their friends. But
he had good cause to fear, for that the world was his enemy. And he gives
them to understand, that they give evil advice in a known thing. As if he
should say, my time to go thither is not yet come, when time shall serve, I
shall need none of your admonitions, I know what and when to do every thing:
how also and when I must be known unto the world, does not depend on man's
counsel, but on my fathers decree, etc. Every man ought to consider his time,
and not to do any thing out of due time, but patientlye to tarry the
opportunity of a convenient time. The Lord would not go with his brethren
to Jerusalem, because his time was not yet come.

At another time he commanded Passover to be prepared at Jerusalem, saying I
will keep y^ Passover, at thy house with my disciples. And to his mother he
said: Mine hour is not yet come. Let every one of us therefore, learn by this
example, to frame our selves according to the conuenientnesse of the time, even
as the Astpole Paul teaches us, but so notwithstanding that we swerve not
the breadth of a nayle^ from our calling. Marl. upon Ioh. fo. 221.

What is meant by time, times, and half a time.
They shall be given into his hand, Dan. 7. 25
until a time and times, and the dividing of a time. God shall suffer them thus
to rage against his Saints for a long time, which is meant by the time and
times. But at length he will assuage these troubles, and shorten the time for
his elect sake, which is here meant by the dividing of time. Geneua.

TITHES.
What is understood by Tithes.
THy fruits whether they be dry or moist, see thou keep not back. By Tithes
and first fruits, are understood giving of thanks, whereby the heart
knowledgeth and confesses to have received it of God, as. 1. Tim. 4. 4. T. M.

Of the Tithes laid up for the poor.
At the end of three years, Deu. 14. 28
thou shall bring forth all y^ tithes of thine increase of the same year, and
lay it up within thy gates. Besides the yearly Tithes that were given to the
Levites, these are laid up in store for the poor. Geneua.

Read. Amos. 4. 4. and Mal. 3. 8.

TO DATE.
What the meaning is of these words, To day.
TO day, ^sa. 95. 7
if ye will hear my voice. As touching the words he says to day, he means
all the time in which the Gospel is preached, teaching us thereby, that so
long as the word is preached, so long salvation is offered. Deering.

TONGVE.
To speak with tongues, what it means.
I Will pray with the spirit, 1. Cor. 1^ 15.
and will pray with the mind also. To speak with tongues or with y^ spirit,
is to speak y^ other understand not, as Priests say their service. To speak
with the mind, is to speak that other understand, as when the Preacher
preaches. Tindale.

How the Apostles spoke with strange tongues.
How then hear we, every man his own language. Act. 2. ^o
Not y^ they spoke with one voice and many languages were heard, but y^ that y^
Apostles spoke with strange tongues for else the miracl^ had rather been in y^
hearers, whereas now it is in the spekers. Nazian. in his Oration of Whitsonday.

What it is to smite with the tongue.
Let us smite him with the tongue. Ier^ ^8. 18
That is, let us slander him and accuse him, for we shall be believed. Geneua.

What the tongue of God is.
Gods tongue is the Holy ghost. Augusti^
Psa. 45. 1. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.

How the tongue is compared unto a lance.
Pithacus the Philosopher says, Lance
that a man's tongue is made like the iron point of a lance, but yet that it
was more dangerous then that: for the point of a lance can but hurt y^ flesh,
but the tongue perishes the heart.

What is meant by the third tongue.
The third tongue has disquieted many a one. Eccl. 28. 1^
The third tongue or double tongue, which says and vnsaith, or speaks one
thing and thinks another. The third tongue do some take for that which
speaks neither out of the new nor the old Testament, but of their own
brain. The Bible note.

TOPAS.
The description of this stone, and what it betokens.
THe ninth a Topas. Apo. 21. 20^
This stone is of the rarer and preciouser sort, and has two colors, the one
of gold, the other of yuorie. It shines with greatest clearenes when it is
touched with the brightness of the Sun: and it passes all Jewels in
cleernesse, singularly provoking the beholders to look still upon it. And this
stone betokens such as shine in Christian life and doctrine. Therefore it
betokens the Christian sort, which are predestinate to salvation out of all
Nations, of whom is made the body of the Catholyke Church. Marl. upon the
Apoc. fol. 300.

The ninth was a Topas, which has in him the color of all other stones. And
this signifies them which are with all virtues adorned, like as was Daniel the
man of desires, and John the Evangelist, which wrote this present Prophecy,
whom Christ much loved. The clear works of these and such other, would be to
shine unto men, y^ by them y^ father might be glorified. Bale.

TOPHETH.
What Topheth is, and how it was defiled.
ANd defiled Topheth also. 4. Reg. 23. 10.
He defiled Topheth, that is, he openly showed that Topheth was defiled,
unclean and filthy. Topheth was a place nigh unto Jerusalem, in the valley of
the sons of Hennon, in which were cast dead ca^kases, and all unclean
things. T. M.

Topheth was a valley near to Jerusalem, and signifies a Tabret, because they
smote on the Tabret, while their Children were burning, that their cry should
not be heard, where after Josiah commanded carions to be cast. Geneua.

How Tophet is taken for hell.
For Tophet is prepared of old. Esa. 30. 33
Here it is taken for hell, where the wicked are tormented. Geneua.

TOVCH NOT.
This is spoken against traditions.
TOuch not, taste not, handle not, etc. Coll. 2. 21.
Men by such observations were led from the verity by the which they were made
free, whereof it is spoken, the verity shall deliver. It is a shame (says the
Apostle) and inconvenient, and far from the nobleness of your liberty
(seeing you be the body of Christ) to be deceived with shadows, and to be
judged as sinners, if you despise to observe those things, wherefore let no man
overcome you (seeing you are the body of Christ) that will seem to be meek
in heart, in the holiness of Angels and bringing in things which he has not
seen. D. Barnes. fol. 299.

Why Mary was forbidden to touch Christ.
Touch me not. Ioh. 20. 17
This seems not to agree with the narration of Matthew. For he plainly
writes, that the women embraced the feet of Christ. And seeing afterward, he
would have his disciples to handle and to feel him, what cause was there, why
he should forbid Mary to touch him. For he said unto Thomas, bring hither thy
finger and see my hands, and put thy finger unto my side, and be not
faithless, but believing. The solution thereof is very easy, if so be that we
consider that the women were not prohibited y^ touching of Christ, before such
time as they were too busy and desirous to touch him. For no doubt he did not
forbid them to touch him, so far forth as it was needful to take away all
doubt. But when he saw they were too busy in embracing his feet, he moderated
and corrected that rash zeal, for they depended upon his corporal presence,
neither did they know any other way to inioye him, then if he dwelt among
them upon the earth. Moreover, because his disciples doubted whether he was
truly risen again or no, and because the same that appeared to them was judged
of them to be but a vision, to the end they might believe the resurrection, he
said, feel and see, for a spirit has no flesh and bones as ye see me have.
Also Thomas had said, except I see y^ print of his nails in his hands, and put
my fingers into the print of the nails, and my hand into his side, I will not
believe, therefore Christ did very well in offering himself to be felt of him.
But in Mary there was no such doubting, that there should need any farther
feeling: but it was requisite y^ she should come to a further faith, and to more
plain understanding of the kingdom of Christ, least she should abase him in
computation, more then there was cause. Marl. upon John. fol. 593.

TRADITIONS.
Of the traditions of men.
FRom whence have we this tradition? Augustine
Whether comes it from the authority of our Lord, or of the Gospel, or else
from the Commandments and Epistles of the Apostles. Therefore if it be either
commanded in the Gospel, or contained in the Epistles or Acts of the
Apostles, let us keep the same tradition. Augustine unto Pompeius.

The Pharisees said not unto Christ: Chrisosto^
Wherefore do thy disciples break the law of Moses, but wherefore do they
break the traditions of the Elders. Whereby it appears, that they had altered
many things, whereas God had commanded that they should neither add nor
diminish: but fearing least they should loose their authority, as if they had
been law makers to the end they might seem the greater, they altered much,
which thing grew to such a wickedness, that they kept their own traditions,
more then the Commandments of God. Chrysostom in his first Homely of the
Jewish fast. John Northbrooke.

Some wrast this place so far as men ought to obey all manner of things, Era.
in hi^ Ann. upon the 23. of Math.
whatsoever the Bishops, Presidents or Rulers command, although they be
ungodly, and for their authorities sake, when as Christ did speak only of
them which did teach rightly the law of Moses, and not of such as did snare
men with their ordinances and constitutions: now peradventure after the same
manner a Bishop might be heard, which preched truly the Gospel, although he
live but a little according unto the same.

A reason that overthrows all doctrines of men, all Traditions, all Popery.
God said to Christ, Mat. 17. 5
Thou art my son, therefore he is his son. God said not so to any Angel:
therefore no Angel can take the name unto him.

God said, John. 3. 21
The true worshippers should not go to Mount Sion nor to Jerusalem, but worship
God in spirit and truth: where said he, go a pilgrimage, or go visit this holy
sepulcher.

God said: Gal. 4. 10.
Do not observe days, and months, and times, and years: where said he: Keep
unto me Lent or Aduent, Imber days or Saints eues.

God said to us, 1. Tim. 4. 2
It is the doctrine of Devils to forbid marriage, or to command to abstain
from meats, where said he: Eat now no flesh, now no whit meat: let not the
Ministers marry?

God said, Romans 13. 1
Let every soul be subject to Kings and Princes, and the authority of such
men, Luke 22. 26
let it not be in his Apostles. Where said he: let the Pope have the gift of
kingdoms, be exempt from authority of man, wear a triple crown, and have
Lords and Noble men under him?

God said, Apo. 22. 18
Cursed is he that adds ought to the law, or takes from it. Where said he,
The Pope shall dispense against mine Apostles and Prophets?

God said, 1. Co. 14. 19
It is better to speak five words which we understand, then ten thousand words
in an unknown tongue: where said he the ignorant men should pray in Latin?
With this very argument are overthrown, all doctrines of men, all traditions,
all Popery, etc. Deering.

What an obstinacy is this, Cipriane.
or what a presumption, to presume an humane tradition before Gods ordinance:
nor to consider that God takes indignation and wrath, so often as an humane
tradition loses, or goes beyond the commandment of God, as he cries by
his Prophet Esaias and says: This people honors me with their lips, but their
hearts is separated from me, they worship me in vain, while they teach the
commandments and doctrines of men. The Lord also in y^ Gospel blaming
likewise and reproving, puts forth and says: ye have rejected Gods
commandment to stablish your tradition. Of which commandment S. Paul being
mindful, does likewise warn and instruct, saying: If any teach otherwise, and
contenteth not himself with the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and his
doctrine, he is puffed up with blockishnes, having skill of nothing, from such a
one we ought to depart.

S. Austen says: that the ancient acts of the godly Kings, Augustine
mentioned in the Prophetical books, were figures of the like facts, to be
done by the godly Princes, in the time of the new Testament. I. Bridges. fol.

TRANSMVTATION.
When this word was first invented.
LOng after Boniface the third, when Idolatry had gotten the upper hand, then
did Petrus Lombardus (a master of sophistical sentences) bring up these terms
of Transmutation, and Transaccidentation (about the year of our Lord. 1646.)
out of certain blind trades of the Doctors before his time. Then Pope Innocent
the third gave it this new name, and called it Accidens sine subiecta. Of the
which Sophisme Doctor Dunce, Doctor Dorbel, and Doctor Thomas de Aquino, do
dispute very subtly. A. G.

TRANSVESTANTIATION.
What the word signifies.
THe word signifies a passing or turning of one substance into another, which
is thought of some not tolerable to say, that the substance of bread in the
Sacrament is changed into the substance of Christ's body. And therefore Dunce
Dunce,
himself utterly refuses and shunneth it. And thinks it better to hold that
the bread departs and gets it self away, and that then in place of it
succeeds Christ's body.

When it was first invented.
That which is former (says Tertulian) is true, that which is latter is false.
But the doctrine of Transubstantiation is a late doctrine: for it was not
defined generally before the Council of Laterane, about 1215. years after
Christ's coming, under Pope Innocentius, ye third of that name, for before y^
time it was free for all men to believe it or not believe it, Tonstall Bishop
of Duresine
as y^ B. of Duresme does witness in his book of the presence of Christ in his
supper lately put forth, Ergo y^ doctrine of transubsta^tiatio^ is false. Brad.

Reasons against Transubstantiation.
That the Lord gave to his disciples bread and wine and called it his body, 1.
Reason
the very scripture do witness. For he gave that and called that his body which
he took in his hands, whereon he gave thanks, which also he brake and gave to
his disciples, y^ is to say bread, as y^ fathers Ireneus, Tertulian, Origin,
Cypriane, Epiphanius and Augustine, and all the residue which are of antiquity
do affirm: but inasmuch as the substance of bread and wine is an other thing
then the substance of the body and blood of Christ, it plainly appears that
there is no Transubstantiation.

The bread is no more transubstantiate then y^ wine: 2. Reason
but that the wine is not transubstantiate, S. Matthew and S. Mark do teach
us: for they do witness, y^ Christ said, that he would drink no more of the
fruit of y^ vine, which was not blood, but wine: and therefore it does follow,
that there is no Transubstantiation. Chrysostom upon Matthew, and S. Cypriane
do affirm this reason.

As y^ Bread of the Lords supper is Christ's natural body, 3. Reason
so is it his mystical body, for the same spirit that spoke of it: This is my
body, did say also: for we being many, are one bread, one body, etc. But now it
is not his mystical body by transubstantiation, and therefore it is not his
natural body by tra^substa^tiation.

The words spoken over the bread in S. Luke and Paul, 4. Reason
are not so mighty and effectual as to transubstantiate it. For then it or
that which is in it, should be transubstantiate into the new Testament: therefore
the words spoken over the bread, are not so mighty to make Transubstantiation.
Bradford.

How it has made the Turks power to increase.
It was decreed of y^ transubstantiation (as they call it) in the year of
Christ. 1215. Nocentius the third being Pope. Melanct. upon Dan.
Which decree has confirmed the most horrible prodigious Idolat^y that ever
was. And anon after in the year. 1250. began Othoma^s kingdom to prosper. And
so shortly after this Idolatrye once confirmed, his kingdom began to arise,
and increased above all other Regions, and brought forth weapons against the
West part of the world, to punish the filthy spots of the Roman Church So
that as soon as this Idolatry of the Mass began to be confirmed of the
people, the Turks power did increase to scourge it in Christ. And shall yet
more and more grow and prease upon us, till this Idolatry of the Mass be taken
quite away, etc.

The cause wherefore the opinion of Transubstantiation is holden and defended.
The words of scripture (says Johannes Scotus, otherwise called Dunce Dunce
) might be expounded more easily and more plainly without Transubstantiation,
but y^ Church did choose this sense (which is more hard): being moved thereunto
(as it seems) chiefly because that of the Sacraments men ought to hold as
the holy Church of Rome holds: but it holds that bread is transubstantiate
or turned into the body, and wine into the blood, as is showed De summa
trinitate and side catholica ^irmiter credimus. Cranmer.

Gabriel Gabriel
(who of all other wrote most largly upon y^ Canon of the Mass) says thus: It
is to be noted, that although in the scripture, that the body of Christ is
truly contained and received of Christian people, under the kinds of bread and
wine, yet how the body of Christ is there whether by conversion of any thing
into it, or without conversion, the body is there with the bread, both the
substance and accidents of bread remaining there still, it is not found
expressed in the Bible. Yet forasmuch as of the sacraments men must hold as the
holy church of Rome holds, as it is written De hereticos, ad abolendu^, and
that Church holds and has determined that the bread is transubstantiated
into the body of Christ, and the wine into his blood, therefore is their opinion
received of all that be Catholic, that the substance of bread remains not,
but really and truly is turned transubstantiate and changed into the substance
of the body of Christ. Cranmer.

TREE.
The tree falling compared to death.
WHether the tree fall to the South, Eccl. 11. 3.
or to the North, look in what place the tree falls, there shall it lie.
That is to say, look in what case the righteous Judge shall find thee at the
hour of thy death, such shall thou be judged to be. Hemmyn.

He exhorts to be liberal while we live, for after there is no power. Geneua.

What the tree of life, and the tree of knowledge means.
The tree of life also in the midst of the garden, Genesis 2. 9.
and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The one was a sign of the life
received of God, the other of miserable experience, which came by disobeying
God. Geneua.

TRESPASS.
How trespass in this place is understood.
WHen that person shall trespass. Number. 5. 6.
This text is to be understood of such trespasses wherewith we hurt our
neighbor in worldly goods (as they call them) and therefore must y^ hurt be
restored, and the fifth part thereto. If the party remained not to whom the
restitution was due, nor any of his lawful heirs, then must it be the
Priests wages, which at that time had no other liuelode.

What trespass offering signifies.
Trespass offering, ^euit. 7.
that is an offering for a trespass. Trespass, after the order of the
scripture signifies sometime all the life past which we have lived in
infidelity, being ignorant of the verity, not only in doing open sins,
but also when we have walked in our own righteousness.

TREASVRE.
What this treasure in earthen vessels is.
BUt we have this treasure in earthen vessels. ^. Cor. 4. 7.
By this treasure Christ himself and the wholesome doctrine of the Gospel is
understood Mat. 13. 44. By the earthen vessels the frailnesse of our flesh is
meant. God for his own laud does set forth himself by those things that are
weak and feeble, because that the whole glory should be given unto God alone,
and not unto men that is made of earth. Ambrose. Sir. I. Cheek.

Albeit the ministers of ^y^ Gospel be contemptible as touching their persons,
yet the tresure which they carry, is nothing worse nor inferior. Geneua.

TRY OR PROVE.
How we ought to try and prove men's doctrines.
THe Priests that were Pharisees (says Chrisostom) in y^ time of Christ, made
an ordinance that whosoever should knowledge Jesus to be Christ, should be
accursed and excommunicate. If then the Pharisees or Priests, y^ now do occupy
their rooms should make a like ordinance, because they would not have Christ's
doctrine to be professed for hindering their lucre, should we therefore give in
all points credence unto them, and leave off to seek after the knowledge of
Christ's doctrine? Nay truly, why (quod he) shall we not be excused herein by
ignorance, seeing we be for^ended by the rulers to have knowledge? He
answers, no vely: for if (says he) when thou desire to buy cloth, thou will not be content to see one Merchaunts ware, but go from the first to the
second, from the second to the third, and so farther, to know where is y^ best
cloth and best cheap: thou using such careful diligence for a temporal
profit, art well worthy great reproach, that will be more remiss and negligent
for thy soul health. Seek therefore about from one doctor or teacher unto
another, that thou may know who does most duly and truly teach Christ, and
him follow, according to the saying of the Apostle: Prove all, and hold the
good. And as it is said in the Gospel, that thou may know, who be true and
lawful chaungers or coyners, and who be not. Lamb. in the B. of Mar. fol.
1257.

Look. Proving.

TRIBVLATION.
There be two kinds of tribulation and affliction.
THere be (says Gasper Megander) two sorts of tribulation. Apoc. 2. 9.
The one breeds of the grief which y^ fa^thfull conceive of the scornings,
lewdnes, blasphemies and scoffings wherewith the ungodly mock at y^ gospel and
promises of God, of which matter look. Ga. 4. 29. Phi. 3. 18. 2. Pe. 3. 3. And
also of y^ pity which they have of those that be blinded, whereof Paul
speaks To. 9. And this kind of persecution may be called inward. The other
proceeds of such things as are laid upon them outwardly, as of hunger,
imprisonment, exile, loss of goods, sword and death. This is the outward
persecution, wherewith Tyrants and other enemies of the Church rage against the
Children of God. Howbeit the one can scarce hap without the other, insomuch as
this saying of the Apostle is most true: that all they which will live godly in
Christ, must suffer persecution. 1. Ti. 3. 12. Ma. fo. 38.

I know thy works and tribulation. This was the persecution under the Emperor
Domitian. Geneua.

Look. Affliction.

TRIBVTE.
How tribute ought to be paid to earthly Princes.
IS it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not. Ma. 22. 17
The word that is used here, signifies a valewing and rating of men's
substance, according to the proportion whereof, they paid tribute in those
provinces, which were subject to tribute, and it is here taken for the tribute
it self. Beza.

The Doctors minds concerning tribute.
Origin says: Origin. in Mat. 22. Tract. 21.
In tempore ergo Christi, etc. In the time therefore of Christ, when they were
commanded to give tribute to the Romans, there was a thought and counsel
among y^ Jews, V^rum deberent, whether they ought that were Gods people, and
his portion, to give Princes tribute, or rather take arms for their liberty,
except they were suffered to live as they lusted. And the story tells that
one Judas a Galilean, of whom Luke mentions in the Acts of the Apostles,
drawing away the multitude of the Jews, taught Non oportet, they ought not to
give tribute to Caesar, and call Caesar Lord But he that was at that time the
Tetrach hastened to persuade the people, and that they should regard the
present state, and not wilfully take arms against the stronger, but be content
to give tribute. And truly the word of this present gospel, not indeed
manifests, yet it shows these things. But he y^ diligently considers the
sense of the present words, shall find this, yea, even in this place. For the
Pharisees had not had occasion (being willing to take Christ in speech, sending
their disciples with the Herodians) to ask him whether it were lawful to give
Caesar tribute or no, if it had been manifested among them, that they ought not
to give it, and that there had been agreement of all their wills, that they
should not give it.

Hilary of the question that was moved to Christ, says: Igitur an violaret,
etc. Hillary in Mat. 22. in regula Mani^ho.
Therefore they try him whether on the condition of the question propounded,
he would violate the worldly power: An videtur reddi tributum Caesari oportet,
whether tribute ought to be rendered to C^sar, etc. And^ when they said it was
Caesar's, he said: Caesari redenda esse, etc. The things that are Caesar's, ought
to be rendered to Caesar.

S. Ambrose says: Et tu si vis, etc. Ambr. in Luke. li.^ cap. 20.
And thou if thou will not be bound or thrall to Caesar, have thou not those
things that are of the world. But if thou have the riches of the world, thou
art bound to Caesar. If thou will owe nothing to ye earthly king, forsake all
things and follow Christ. And before discern ye well what things ought to be
rendered to Caesar.

Saint Austen says: Sed quia Manichei, etc. Aug. con. Faustan. Manichae li.
22. cap 74.
But because the Maniches use openly to blaspheme John, let them hear even the
Lord Jesus Christ. Hoc stipendium iubentem reddi Caesari, commaunting (not
permitting) this stipent to be rendered unto Caesar. And of these words of
Saint Paul to the Romans, Omnis anima, Let every soul be subject unto the
higher powers. Si quis ergo, If therefore any body think, that because he is a
christian, he ought not to render tax or tribute, or that honor ought not to
be given due to those powers that care for these things, he falls in great
error, but that mean ought to be kept which God himself prescribes, that we
should give unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that
were of God.

Arbitrati se, etc. Theophi.
Thinking they should smoth him with praises, they flatter him, that being
milked, he should say, Non deberi tributum, Tribute ought not to be given to
Caesar, and thereupon they might take him as a seditious man, and moving the
people against Caesar, and therefore they bring the Herodians with them that
were the kings men, to apprehende him as a stirrer of new things Thou regardest
not say they, the person of any man, thou speak nothing to get the favor of
Herod and Pilate. Tell us therefore, Debemus and hominibus, ought we to be
both tributary to men, and to give them tax, as well as to give tax to God,
or shall we give to God only, or else to Caesar? This they spoke (as I said)
that he should say, that tribute ought not to be given to Caesar. Thus we see
again their question whether they ought or no. But Jesus by the coin that was
figured in the Image of Caesar, Persuadit illis debere Caesari, persuades them
that those things are owing to Caesar that are his, that is, those that have
his Image both in corporal and outward things, we must obey the king, but in
inward things and spiritual, only God. I. Bridge. fo. 639.

TRINITY.
How the whole trinity is approved by the Scripture.
AND said, Lord, if I have found favor, etc. He saw three, but directed his
speech but to one, whereby the mystery of the Trinity is declared. The Bible
note.

Speaking to one of them in whom appear to be most majesty, for he thought
they had been men. Geneua.

John saw heaven open, Ambr. de Sacra. li. 1. cap. 5.
and the holy Ghost descending upon him like a Dove, and there came a voice
from heaven Mar. 1. 10. etc. Christ did come down, and the holy Ghost came
down. But Christ the son of God did appear, a true natural and essential
body, whereas the holy Ghost did come down in the likeness, and not in the
true and essential body of a dove. The father did also speak from heaven.
Here ye have the whole Trinity.

TRVMPET.
Whereto Trumpets serve.
AND seven Trumpets were given unto them. Trumpets serve to many purposes,
Apoc. 8. 2.
among which also is one, that public Magistrates are wont to publish and
proclaim y^ laws and ordinances, which they have made by the sound of
trumpets. The same use does John assign here to the Angels: By who^
notwithstanding we may well mean the Apostles and Ministers of the word,
according to the commandment of the Lord, given unto Esaias. 58. 1. Set out thy
throat and cry, strain thy self as a Trumpet, lift up thy voice, etc. And
Christ said to his Apostles: Look what I say unto you in the dark, speak you
it in the light, and that which you hear in the ear, preach you upon the
house tops. M^th. 10. 27. Marl.

How the Scribes and Pharesies did use them.
The Scribes and Pharesies in common and public places, Math. 6. 2
whereunto many people were wont to resort, did distribute their doles or alms
to the poor, in the which their ostentation was manifest, because they sought
frequented places to have many witnesses of their deeds, and not contented with
this they caused trumpets to be sounded: They fained truly that they called y^
poor together, by the noise of the Trumpet, so that they never wanted a cloak
to shadow their hypocrisy, when as it is for certain that they did it to have
fame, renown, and praise of men. Marl. upon Mat. fol. 112.

The very meaning both that we blow no Trumpet, Math. 6. 2
and that the left hand know not what the right hand does, is y^ we do as
secretly as we can, and in no wise seek vain glory, or to receive it if it
were proffered, but to do our deeds in singleness of conscience to God, because
it is his commandment, and even of pure compassion and love to our brethren,
and not that our good deeds though standing in our own conceit, should cause us
to despise them. Tindale.

TRVTH.
Truth defined.
THat is truth according to y^ Hebrew phrase, which is ye most perfect essence
of any thing, and the very absolute perfection it self of a matter. Marl. upon
John. fol. 309.

Why Christ is called true and soothfast.
Thus says he that is holy and true. Apoc. 3. ^
He is called true or soothfast, because he only teaches us true, certain,
substantial and infallible things, and therefore he anoucheth himself to be y^
truth it self. John. 14. 6. And only Schoolemaister. Math. 23. 8. who^ all
men ought to give care unto, even by the commandment of the father. Math. 17.
5. Also God is said to be true or soothfast, because he keeps touch in his
promises, notwithstanding men's iniquities. Romans 3. 3. 4. Marl. fol. 60.

Who they be that are true of heart.
The true of heart shall be glad thereof. Psa. 64. 10.
The true of heart are these, that neither for the prosperity of the
unfaithful nor poverty of the good, are seduced. But always judging well of
God, as pleased with that he does, contented only with his promise in his
word. Psa. 73. 1. T. M.

TWELVE MONTHS.
Look. Year.

TWO.
How two in one flesh is understood.
THey commit adultry, that marry at one time two wines, and say, if a man have
an hundred (as he may have as well as two) yet all is but two, and one flesh in
the Lord. Christ does not so interpret two. Math. 19. but refers two to one
man and one woman, as the text that he alleges out of Genesis. chapter. 1.
and 2. declares, saying: Have ye not read that he that made man from the
beginning, made the male and female, therefore shall man leave Father and mother
and associate his wife, and shall be two in one flesh. This text admits not
plurality of wives, but destroys plain the sentence of those that defend
the conjunction of many wives with one man. For at the beginning of Matrimony
was but one man and one woman created and married together, no more should there
be now in one matrimony, as Christ there teaches and expounds two in one
flesh, and not three or four in one flesh. The word of God must be followed,
and not the examples of the Fathers in this case. Whooper.

Of two Sacraments.
As concerning Sacraments which ought to be holden properly for lawful
Sacraments, ^. Sacraments.
he has ordained two in the Christian Church. The first is Baptime, the other
is the supper. The other that has been added to these by the Papists, may not
be accounted for true and lawful Sacraments, for so much as they have no
certain foundation in the word of God, without the which no Sacrament is
lawful. Pet. Viret.

Saint Cipriane says: Tunc demum plane sanctificari, etc. Cipriane.
Then may they be thoroughly sanctified, and become the children of God, if they
be newborn by both the Sacraments. Cipri. li. 2, Epist. 1. ad Steph.

Augustine says: Augustine
Quedam pauca pro multis, etc. Our Lord and his Apostles have delivered unto us
a few Sacraments in steed of many, and the same in doing most easy, in
signification most excellent, in observation most reverend: as in the Sacrament
of Baptime, and the celebration of the body and blood of our Lord. Aug. de
doct. christ. li. 3. cap. 9.

Again, Augustine.
speaking of Baptime and the supper he says thus: Haec sunt, etc. These be the
two Sacraments of the Church. Aug. de Cymbolo ad Catechemenes.

Paschasius says: Paschasius
Sunt Sacramenta, etc. These be the Sacraments of Christ in the Catholic
Church, Baptime, and the body and blood of our Lord. Paschasius de coena Domini.

Bassarius says: Bassarius.
Hoc duo solo Sacramenta, etc. We read that these only two Sacraments were
delivered to us in the Scriptures. Bassarius de Sacramenta Euchari.

Against these foresaid saiengs the late pretensed Council of Trident has
concluded thus: Council of Tridet
Si quis dixerit, etc. If any man shall say, that the Sacraments of the new
law were not all ordained of our Lord Jesus Christ, or that there be fewer or
mo then seven or that any one of the same, verilye and in proper speech be not
a Sacrament, accursed be he. Council of Trident. Sessio. 7.

and thus to confess: O Lord I am guilty of death, I have deserved to be
stoned for this trespass and not this beast, or to be strangled for this
transgression, or to be burnt for this crime. But these Sacrifices do by
shadow, signify Christ the true lamb of God, who would afterward cleanse our
sins, and pay the price of them How grievous therefore should we acknowledge
and confess our sins to be, for the which no beast but the innocent son of
God has died. For the Father sparing us, has yielded his son to death. The

VEIL.
What the veil and renting of the temple did signify.
AND the veil of the temple did rent in two pieces. Mar. 15. 3^
This veil was a certain cloth that hanged in the temple, dividing the most
holy place from the rest of the temple, as our cloth that is hanged up in Lent,
divides the altar from y^ rest of the Church. The renting of which veil
signified that the shadows of Moses law should vanish away at the flourishing

VINE.
What the Allegory means.
I Am the true vine. John. 15. ^
This Allegory is taken out of diverse writings of the Prophets, who in diverse
places compare the Church to a vineiard, and men in the Church to vines, and
the works of faith, of love, and of righteousness, to grapes. Therefore when
the Lord calls himself the true vine, we must not so understand him^ as if
he were naturally and substantially a vine, for naturally and substantially he
is God and man, and not a vine, but represents the true vine. Therefore it is
called a vine by similitude, not by property, even as he is called a Sheep, a
Lamb, a Ly^n, a Rock, a Cornerstone, and such like, from which such
similitudes are brought. Marl. upon John. fol. 500.

What is here meant by the vine.
And he shall bind his Ass sole unto the Uine. Genesis 49. 11
A country most abundant with vines and pastures is promised him. Geneua.

How Israel is compared to an empty vine.
Israel is an empty vine. Ose. 10. 1.
As the vine spoiled of her grapes bears new the year following, so the
Israelites enioyeng rest after afflictions, renewed their former wickedness and

Whereof though the grapes were gathered, yet as it gathered new strength, it
increased new wickedness, so that the correction which should have brought them
to obedience, did but utter their stubburnenesse. Geneua.

VINEGAR.
Of the property thereof.
Vinegar of it self is sharp, sour, and tart, and is no fit drink to
moisten a man that is a thirst. For though vinegar be cold in operation, yet
is it dry and has virtue exicatiue. Therefore vinegar is a sauce and no proper
drink. And if it be dronken of him that is moist, it makes him dry. But if
he be dry before, it kills him quickly, at y^ least if it be strong vinegar.
And specially if it be such vinegar as was given to Christ hanging upon the
cross, Psa. 69. 21
which (as S. Matthew says) was mingled with Gall. Saint Mark calls it Vinum
mirlatum, Wine mingled with Mirre. Whereupon the worshipful Clarke Saint Bede
does gather upon the words of S. Mark, that they gave unto Christ wine
mingled with Mirre, Mirre is the Gum of a certain tree growing in Arabia,
called Mirre, which Gum is both green and bitter like unto gall. This bitter
tart drink given unto Christ, did both fulfill the prophecy, which was that
the Jews should so use Christ in the time of his thirst, and also it made a
speedy end of his life. For as soon as he had tasted of that tart and strong
vinegar, he bowed down his head and said: Consummatum est, All is done. All
the things which the Prophets have fortold and spoken of me, are now fulfilled.

VIPER.
The property of this venomous beast.
THE nature of a Uiper is this, when the time of gendering is, the male comes
to the female, and puts his head into her mouth, which the female biteth
off, and so kills the male, whose head ingendereth within the female a great
sort of eggs, hanging togethers like beads, and when the time comes that she
should bring them forth, she puts forth but one, and yet is all a day in
doing that. Then the other being left within her are so greedy to come forth,
that they gnawe out her body, and so comes forth and kills the damme.

Of the Viper that hung on Paul's hand.
And he shook off the viper into the fire, Act. 8. 25.
and felt no harm. By this miracle God performed his promise made to his
disples, that neither Serpent nor poison should hurt them. And also by the same
was confirmed the Gospel of his son Jesus Christ, which Paul preached unto
the world. Sir. I. Cheek.

The vipers of all kind of beasts is most pestiferous, for if they do but
scant touch a man, they bring violent death, as appears by the men that in
the I Will of Miletum, who when they saw the viper hang on Paul's finger after
his Shipwreck, they said: Surely this man is a murderer, whom (although he
have escaped the danger of the Sea) vengeance will not suffer to live. But
when they saw him (the viper cast into the fire) to have no harm (for they
thought he should have been burnt, or else sodeinly fall down dead) they
altered their minds and said he was a God. So great danger does the poison
of a viper bring. Marl. upon Math. fol. 46.

VIRGINITY.
What true virginity is.
THat is not true virginity, when the body is restrained from the natural
course and disposition of wedlock, but when the pure and maidly abstinence is
to kept both in body and mind, that by the disposition of God, all our life is
consecrate and hallowed to better studies and purposes, for as touching the
restraint or countenance thereof, is to small purpose. For we find many
beasts also which do not go to fellow, and therefore Augustine does a right call
virginity, the virtue not of y^ body but of the mind. And the Apostle says:
that she may be an idle sleeuelesse matter. But he thinks it the part of
virgins, to think upon these things which do apperteine unto the Lord: which
is nothing else but with heart and mind to follow y^ Lords will accordingly, as
the necessity of the Saints and condition of every time does require. Musc.
fol. 507.

The places of S. Paul in this matter expounded.
He y^ stands steadfast in his heart having no necessity, 1. Cor. 7. 37
but power of his own will, and has determined in his heart to keep his
virgin does well, and so he that marries his virgin does well, but he that
marries her not does better. S. Hierom expounding this text, says these
words: Ille firmus statuit cuius puella consensus patris firmauit voluntaria.
He purposes steadfastly whose maidens consent, has confirmed the fathers will.
Then by S. Hierome, the consent of the maid is required, without which the
father can order nothing.

Erasinus in his Paraphrase upon the same place says: If any man perceiving
that he has liberty to bestow his virgin in marriage, or not to bestow her,
and is not compelled by need to either of both, and has determined and
purposed in his mind to keep his virgin at home, which desires no marriage
does right. For as it is ieoperdus to hold her from marriage, y^ is desirous of
marriage, so is it ungodly to discourage maids minds, from the desire and vow
of chastity.

Note here also y^ S. Paul compels no man to vow, but he lets every
man stand to his own will. Furthermore be wills whatsoever he be that decrees
in his heart virginity, y^ he first consider whether it lies in his power to
keep his decree or not. If it be in his power then (says S. Paul) does he
better to keep his virginity then to marry.

As concerning virgins (says S. Paul) I have no precept of ye Lord, 1. Cor.
7. 25
but alonely I give you my counsel, etc. Note y^ S. Paul would not bind y^
Corinthians to virginity^ because he would not tangle them in a snare, but
alonely he exhorts them to virginity, as unto an honest and comely thing, y^
they might the more quietly serve God. Upon the same text says Athanasius that
y^ Apostle would compel no man to keep virginity against his will, nor he
would not make virginity a thing of necessity.

S. Paul proving clearly that no man ought or can be bound to virginity,
further then the gift of God does strengthen him, says thus: As concerning
virgins I have no precept of y^ Lord, but only I give you my counsel, for I
think it good by y^ reason of this present necessity that a man should live
so. As he would say, unto virginity I cannot bind you, further then your
gift is, nor I do not reckon it a thing necessary to win heaven by. For
heaven is neither the price of virginity nor yet of marriage, but alonely I
reckon virginity a good and an expedient thing to live quietly by in this
world. For in marriage is many things y^ does distract and disturbeth a man's
mind. That this is S. Paul's meaning it is well proved by the text y^
follows: If a virgin does marry, she does not sin, but she shall have much
temptation in the flesh, that is to say, many occasions of disquietnesse. But I
(says S. Paul) would gladly spare you from such occasions, for I would have
you without sorrow. And she that is unmarried has no care but how to serve
God, but she that is married has much care and sorrow, how she shall dispatch
all worldly business. So that Saint Paul does clearly declare his meaning,
how that virginity is no nearer way to heaven then marriage is, saving that
alonely an unmarried person has not so many occasions to be disquieted, as the
married has. Here we see that Saint Paul has no commandment to bind men
to chasttitie, and yet the Pope compels all Priests to forswear marriage,
and to vow chastity.

But if any man think, 1. Cor. 7. ^6
etc. Here we learn that it is y^ parents part to marry forth their children.
For in the old time no contract of matrimony took effect, without authority
of the parents. Read Deu. 7. 3. Also parents ought to provide betimes for their
children, and in no wise to compel them either to virginity or to wedlock,
unless they see them to misuse themselves. Read Genesis 24. Sir. I. Cheek.

S. Hierome says: Si quis consideret virginem suam, etc. If any man consider
that his own virgin, that is to say his own flesh, grows proud, and boileth
unto lust and cannot stay it, there is laid upon him a double necessity,
either to take a wife or to fall. Hierome aduersus Iouinian. l^. 1.

Of the virgin that was sought for David.
Let there be sought for my Lord the king, 3. Reg. 1. 2
etc. David took this virgin not for lust, but for the health of his body, by
the advice of his counsel, which seems to be done by the special
dispensation of God, and therefore not to be followed as an example. The Bible
note.

Wherefore virginity is praised.
S. Paul praises virginity in them that are apt and able to embrace that
state of living, Melancth.
that they might with more speed go forth to preach, and to serve the
congregations. He praises it not because he judges that state to deserve the
more grace, for this error fighting against ye justification of faith, he most
of all abhors. We deny it not (says Melancthon) but y^ there be distinct
states of living. The Mayor of the city excels y^ shipmaister, but yet
deserves not the Mayor more grace for governing the city then the Shipper for
ruling the Ship. Yea, it is possible that the shipper may worship God better in
his ship, then the Mayor in the city. Wherefore these degrees differ not
concerning the spiritual life by faith, or any grace thereby to be obtained,
although they conferred together in y^ externe life one excels another: for
God wills an order to be in offices and states of living.

A memorable fact of a virgin in defense of her country.
Aeneas Siluius, otherwise Pope Pius the second, in describing of Asia minor.
cap. 74. recites a certain fact of a worthy virgin, who at what time the
Turks were besieging a certain town in Lesbos, The I Will of Lesbos preserved
by a virgin.
and had cast down a great part of the walls, so y^ all the towns men had given
over, putting on a man's harneis, stepped forth into the breach, where not only
she kept the Turks from entering in, but ^lue of them a great sort. The citizens
seeing the rare courage and good success of the maid, took to them again
their heart and harneis, and so lustely laid about them that an incredible
number of the Turks were slain. The rest being repulsed from the land, reculed
into their ships, who being then pursued by a navy of Calisa, were worthily
discomfited likewise upon the sea. And thus was the I Will of Lesbos at that time,
by a poor virgin, that is, by the strong^ hand of the Lord working in a weak
creature preserved from the Turks. In the book of Mar.

UNBELIEVERS.
What S. Paul does mean here by unbelievers.
Bear not the strange yoke with the unbelievers. 2. Cor. 6. 14
Nothing in this world can hinder a man so much from true godliness, as does
the amity and friendship with the ungodly. The sons of God did in the
beginning join themselves in amity or friendship with the children of men,
and they were all destroyed by a flo^d. He that touches Pitch shall be
defiled therewith. Beware therefore (if ye will continue and abide steadfast in
the true doctrine) that ye accompanye not your selves with ungodly Epicures,
which without the fear of God, do give themselves to all kind of mischief
and blasphemy. Sir. I. Cheek.

He seems to allude to that which is written. Deuteronomy. 23. 10. where the Lord
commands, that an Ore and an Ass be not yoked together, because the match is
unequal. So if the faithful marry with the Insidells, or else have to do
with them in any thing unlawful, it is here reproved. Geneua.

VNCIRCVMCISED LIPS.
What is meant by uncircumcised lips.
SEeing that I have uncircumcised lips. Genesis 6. 12.
To be of uncircumcised lips, is to have a tongue that lacks good utterance
to set out matter withal. T. M.

Uncircumcised lips. Or barbarous and rude in speech. And by this word
(Uncircumcised) is signified the whole corruption of man's nature. Geneua.

UNCLEAN SPIRIT.
How this place of the Evangelist is understood.
WHen the unclean spirit is gone out, Mat. 12. 43
etc. Unless we do now at this present take better heed to our selves, and
use thankfully the grace of God now offered unto us by his Gospel, and labor
to expel these soul spirits that yet remain among us, as covetousness,
whoordome, and uncleanness, etc. the same that Christ here threateneth unto
the Jews, shall happen unto us. Sir. I. Cheek.

When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, Luke. 11. 24
etc. The unclean spirit after he is cast out: when he comes and finds his
house swept and garnished, takes to him seven worse then himself, and
comes and enters in, and dwells there, and so is the end of that man worse
then the beginning. The Jews they had cleansed themselves with Gods word from
all outward Idolatry and worshipping of Idols, but their hearts remained still
faithless to Godward, and toward his mercy and truth, and therefore without
love also and lust to the law, and to their neighbor for his sake, and false
trust in their own works (to the which heresy the child of perdition y^
wicked Bishop of Rome with his lawiers has brought us Christen) were more
Idolaters then before, and became ten times worse then in the beginning. For
the first Idolatry was soon spied and easy to be rebuked of the Prophet by y^
Scripture. But the latter is more subtle to beguile withal, and an hundred
times of more difficulty to be weeded out of men's hearts. Tindale. fol. 35.

When by the grace of God we are induced and brought into the knowledge of the
truth, then are we delivered from the power of Satan. Therefore we must take
heed, that he do not (to our utter destruction) return again into us, that
is to say, that we fall not again into our own infidelity, superstition and
ignorance. Then indeed shall we be in worse case then we were before. Sir. I.
Cheek.

What is meant by these three unclean spirits.
And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the
Dragon. That is a strong number of this great Devil the Popes Ambassadors,
Apoc. 16. 13
which are ever crieng and croking like Frogs out of Antichrists mouth,
because they should speak nothing but lies, and use all manner of craft and
deceit to maintain their rich Euphrates against the true Christians. Geneua.

VNFAITHFVLL.
How the unfaithful eat not Christ's body.
Look, Eating. Wicked. Evil will.

UNGODLY.
The meaning of this place of the Prophet.
THe ungodly have bent their bow, etc. That is a borrowed speech, Psa. 11. 2.
by which is signified the wicked enemies of David, were most pressed and ready^
to destroy him, for this Psalm as some suppose was made when he fled from
Saul and hid himself from him in diverse and sundry places. As ye read. 1.
Reg. from the. 22. to the. 27. where his persecution was so great, that at
length he was feign to fly out of y^ coasts of Israel unto the Philistines,
after the like manner do our Saules daily persecute the christen. Psa. 37. 12.
T. M.

Look. Wicked.

UNICORNS.
What is meant by the Unicorns.
ANd hear me from among the horns of ye Unicornes. By these Unicorns
understand the common people of the Jews, Psa. 22. 21
which cruelly and furiously put themselves in prease against Christ crieng:
Crucify him, Crucify him. Mat. 27. 22. T. M.

UNIVERSAL CHVRCH.
What it is.
THe universal Church is a multitude gathered of all manner of nations, Apoc.
1. 4
which being set a sunder and dispearsed by distaunce of places, does
nevertheless consent in the one truth of the heavenly doctrine, and is knitte
together in one self same bond of religion. But for as much as it is not
possible for all Christ's members, to grow together into one place: under the
universal Church are comprehended the several Churches which are disposed in
every Town and Uillage, according as man's necessitye requires: So as each one
of them does worthily bear the name and authority of the Church. In the same
sense does Paul say, that he had a daily care for all Churches. 2. Cor. 11.
28. Marl. fol. 7.

Whether Christ's Church or the Popes be the universal Church.
That the Church of Christ, and not the Romish Church, is that true universal
Church that has always remained and ever shall: read S. Augustine to
Casulane. Epist. 80. where ye shall see the Romish Church, and other Western
Churches agreeing with her, ^. The. 2. 2
gui^e exempted from Christ's universal church, as one departed from the faith
of Christ.

Proves against the universal head.
Look. Pope.

VNQVIETNESSE OF THE FLESH.
Look. Messenger of Satan.

VNSAVERIE.
The meaning of this place of Job.
THat which is unsavory, Job. 6. 6.
shall it be eaten without Salt. Can a man's taste delight in that that has
no savor? Meaning that none took pleasure in affliction, seeing they cannot
away with things that are unsavory to the mouth. Geneua.

UNTIL.
What this word (Until) does signify.
KNew her not until she had brought forth her first begotten son. Mat. 2. 25
This word (Until) also does sometime signify the certeintie and appointed
time. And sometime it signifies the time infinite without end or ceasing, as in
these places that follows. I am I am, and until you wax old I am. Now in
this place because he says until they be old, he will be their God, will be
therefore when they are old, cease or leave off to be their God. And our
savior Christ to his Apostles: Behold, I am with you even unto the end of the
world, will the Lord after the consummation of the world forsake his Disciples.
Again, the Psalmist says ^ He shall reign until he have put all his enemies
under his f^^^e, shall he therefore when his enemies are subdued reign^ no
long^^? Again, as the eyes of the maid do wa^te upon thee hands of her
mistres, even so do our eyes way upon thee, until thou have mercy upon
us, when the Lord therefore has compassion and mercy upon us, shall we
wait no longer? In the like sense this word (Until) is to be taken in this
place: for the Evangelist says, He knew her not until she had brought forth
her son, that we may much more perceive and gather, that he knew her not
after. Marl. upon Mat. fol. 19.

Christ is here called the first borne, because she had never any before, and
not in respect of any she had after: neither yet does this word (Until) import
always a time following: wherein the contrary may be affirmed, as our Savior
saying, that he will be present with his disciples until the end of the
world, means not that after the end of the world he will not be with them.
Geneua.

This little word (Until) in the Hebrew tongue) gives us to understand also,
that a thing shall not come to pass in time to come. As Michol had no child
until her death day. 2. Samuel. 6. 23. And in the last Chapter of the
Evangelist: Behold I am with you, until the end of the world. Beza.

VNVVORTHELY.
Of the unworthy receiving of the Sacrament.
SAint Paul does not say that Judas did eat the body of Christ unworthily,
1. Co. 11. ^7
for he speaks not of his body unworthily, but of the Sacrament unworthily.
For he says: Whosoever eats of this bread, and drinks of this Cup
unworthily, eats and drinks his own damnation, because he makes no
difference of the Lords body, and not because he eats the Lords body. If
Judas did eat Christ's body, it must needs follow that Judas was saved. For
Christ says in the 6. of John. ve. 45. Whosoever eats my flesh and drinks
my blood, has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day. R.
Woodman in the b. of Mar. fol. 2181.

Who eats Christ's body in the Sacrament unworthily.
He eats this bread unworthily, which regards not the purpose for the which
Christ did institute it, which comes not to it with spiritual hunger, to
eat through faith his very body, which the bread represents by the breaking
and distributing of it, which comes not with a merry heart, giving God hearty
thanks for their deliverance from sin: which do not much more eat in
their heart the death of his body, then they do the bread with their mouth.

Objection.
He that eats and drinks this Sacrament unworthily, shall be guilty of the
body and blood of the Lord. Now say they, how shall they be guilty of the Lords
body and blood, which receive it unworthily, except it were the very body and
blood of the Lord.

Answer.
He that despises the Kings seal or letters, offends against his own
person. ^he kings arms
He that violently plucketh down his graces arms, or breketh his broad seal
with a furious mind or with violence, commits treason against his own
person, and yet his arms and broad seal, are not his own person. He y^
clippeth ye Kings coin, commits treason against ye Kings person and the
Commonwealth, and yet y^ money is neither ye Kings person nor y^ Commonwealth.
S. Paul says, y^ every man which prays or precheth we covered head, shameth
his head, and his head is Christ: shall we therefore imagine, y^ Christ is
naturaly in every ma^s head

S. Austen says, that he does no less sin, which negligently hears the word
of God, then does the other which^vnworthely receives ye sacrament of Christ's
body and blood. Here it is plain y^ Christ's natural body is not in ye word
when it is preched, and yet he sins no less (says S. Austen) ye
negligently hears it, then does he that unworthily receives the Sacrament.

S. Peter witnesses, that our hearts are purified by faith, true faith
therefore is the cleanesse of Christians, Act. 15. 9.
whereupon S. Austen says: The unbelievers eat not the flesh of Christ
spiritually, but rather eats and drinks the sacrament of so great a thing
to his own condempnation, because being unclean he has presumed to come to
Christ's Sacraments which no man receives worthily but he that is clean, of
whom it is said: Blessed be the clean in heart, Mat. 5. 8.
for they shall see God. Bull. 1107.

VOICE.
The meaning of this place.
HEaring his voice, but seeing no man. Act. 9. 7.
They heard Paul's voice: for afterward it is said in flat terms, that they
hard not his voice that spoke: as beneath cap. 22. 9. But other go about to
set these places at one, which seem to be at a jar, after this sort: to wit,
that they heard a sound of a voice, but no perfect voice. Beza.

No marvel though weak and corruptible flesh was amassed at heavenly things,
and at the talk of God, whereby it came to pass that they heard a voice, as
here is written, and hard no voice, as it is written in the 22. chapter. ve.
9. For they hard a voice, and understood it not. The Bible note.

VOW.
The definition of a vow, and what a vow is.
AUows is a testification of a willing promise made unto God, of things which
appertain unto God: but a vow which is vowed by the parent for the son,
cannot seem willing. Yea but it is: because the parents vowed not being
compelled, but of their own free will. Farther it is meet for the children to
obey the will of the parents freely and of their own accord, especially when
they command no ungodly thing contrary to the word of God. Pet. Mar. upon
Iudic. fol. 203.

A vow may be taken two ways: for vowing signifies to make a devout or
solemn promise, and also to wish and desire. So that a vow signifies sometime
a promise made unto God, and sometime a desire. Like as the Greeks do use
these two words Eukeoon and Eukij, in these two senses, we be wont in vowing to
desire and earnestly request some thing of God, and therefore a vow is
oftentimes taken for a desire and prayer. So when these things which we have
desired, do fall out according unto our mind, we say we have our wish or vow:
and they have their will which have their desire. But the proper meaning of the
word is to signify a promise, and that not every manner of promise, but the
same which is devoutly and holily made unto God: if you promise any thing to a
man, or to any other creature, it may well be called a promise, but not a vow.
The master of the sentences, does define it after this manner: A vow is a
certain testifieng or witnessing of a willing promise, which must be made
properly to God, and of those things which do belong unto God. Mus. fo. 498.

If it be a vow. Leui. 7. 1^
By vows are understood, the gifts which are accustomed to be offered and
given to God, by any outward Ceremony, as it was to round their hairs, and
to drink no wine. Number. 6. T. M.

Of the vow of chastity.
To vow chastity stands not in our choice or vow, but in the secular gift
of God: as Christ himself says: All men take not this word, but they unto
whom it is given. Math. 9. 11. S. Hierom says, that virginity is a thing
that may be counseled, but commanded it may not be. Jewel. fol. 167.

Look. Virginity.

How vows are not always to be observed.
In naughty promises break off, and in a foul vow alter thy purpose: Vows
un ad^^sedly made.
do not that which thou have unadvisedly vowed. The promise is wicked, which
is accomplished by a mischeeuous deed Thus (says Musculus) we do read in the
Canons: whereby it does well appear, that neither foolish nor unprofitable,
much less naughty and foul vows do bind their consciences which has vowed
them, but that they ought immediately to be broken. So that it is out of all
doubt, that vows be not always to be observed. Musculus. fol. 508.

The words of the Canon written in the Popes decrees. 22. quest. 4. in malis,
be these: the Popes Canons
In malis promissis, etc. In an evil promise, break thy faith: in an dishonest
vow, change thy purpose that thou have unadvisedly vowed, see thou do it not:
it is an evil promise that is kept with wickedness. Jewel. fol. 168.

Of unlawful, unprofitable, and impossible vows.
They be unlawful vows, Unlawful Vows.
which cannot be lawfully performed. The vow of Iephta was not lawful,
because it was not lawful to kill a man for sacrifice, much less his
daughter. If the wife should vow virginity, that she should deny her duty to
her husband, the vow is unlawful, because it is contrary to Gods holy
ordinance. It is an unprofitable Unprofitable.
and fond vow, vow.
when we do promise to abstain from certain meats, upon some certain
days, for meats do not commend us unto God, nor avails any thing to true
godliness. Such manner of vows be unprofitable and foolish, and not please
God. It is an impossible vow, Impossib. Vows.
if thou should vow to live without y^ flesh, as long as thou art in the
flesh, unless it be wrought and made possible, by the special gift of God,
otherwise impossible. Such is the vow of virginity. To be a virgin is not
evil of it self, and in case thou have vowed it, look well how to be able to
perform thy vow, and that not only in thy body, but in thy spirit also:
specially that thou offend not by the means of this vow. As the Apostle
witnesses, It is better to marrye then to burn. Beside this, in case a man
should vow to abstain from those things which nature it self can hardly do,
and without which the life of man cannot well be sustained, but fall into
dangerous diseases, if he will indeed perform the same which he has vowed,
it is a dangerous and unpleasant vow unto God. Musculus. fol. 501.

And Iephta vowed a vow unto the Lord. Iudi. 11. 30
As the Apostle commends Iephta for his worthy enterprise in delivering the
people. Heb. 11. 32. So by his rash vow, and wicked perfourmaunce of the same,
his victory was defaced, and so it may appear that the sins of the godly,
does not utterly extinguish their faith. Geneua.

Difference between a vow and an oath.
It is not lawful to vow but unto God only: but we may swear unto man, and
bind our selves unto him by an oath. Wherefore we must not judge the condition
of a vow, after the condition of an oath. Muscul. fol. 501.

What a vow is, and what vows were appointed of God, and what forbidden.
A vow was a free will offering of some thing to the honor or service of God,
Free Will offering.
used in Moses law. And whenever the people were disposed to vow, that is,
of his own free will to offer to God (which was when he offered to the Temple
or Tabernacle of God) they did offer one of these four things: either his own
self, or his beast, or his house, or some part of his land, and his free will
offering was one of the things that God appointed for the Priests livings, as
in the 18. of Nu^ and in diverse other places of the old Testament, ye shall
find that the Leuiticall Priests and Ministers of the Temple had no portion
nor inheritance with the other 11. Tribes, but that Gods own part should be
theirs, which was the tithes of all the country, with the commodities of 48.
cities with their Suburbs, which Cities were all Cities of learning as our
Uniuersities be. This was their portion. Number. 35. And to the maintenance of
their living, God appointed six things: four of them were certain and
standing, and two stood but upon the free offering, and devotion of the
people. The four things standing were these: The first fruits of all manner
grain and spices, What things were appointed for the Priests livings.
with other commodities. The second, y^ first birth or first begotten of every
living thing. If it were of a man, the Parents should redeem it with money. If
it were of a beast that the Priest could not eat, nor could not be offered it
should be redeemed with money also. The third was the tenths of y^ Levites
tithes. The fourth were certain Cities, which were common to them with ye
Levites. These four were standing. The other two were but casualties which
passed all the other: The one was the daily Oblations and Sacrifices that were
offered up to God in the Temple: and the other was the vows of the free will
offering of the people. The ma^s redemp.
If it were a man that had offered up himself, between 20. years and 60. his
redemption should be^ 50. Sicles. If it were a woman, her fine was 30. Sicles.
If it were a poor man not able to redeem himself with the former sum, The
woman's red.
then to agree with the Priest for as little as he could. If it be a beast that
was vowed, either it was clean or unclean, the beasts fine.
that is, it was man's meat or otherwise. If it were no man's meat, as an
Horse, an Ass, a Camel, a Swine, etc. Then the Priest might sell it to whom
he would. And if the owner would buy it again, then he must give the fifth
penie above that he was bidden for it of another man. If it were a clean beast
y^ was offered, then it could not be redeemed. The like fashion was used for
vowing of houses. Likewise also, if a man had vowed a piece of land of his
inheritance, look what sum of corn the ground would bear by the year,
according to the same, he should pay to the Priests use, counting to the year
of Iubely, which was every 7. year. Concerning those two points, that no
ground should be plowed nor tilled, nor no debtes nor law days kept to plead
for any injury. And every 50 year was the great Iubely, Year of Iubely.
in the which also if any man had morgaged and pledged his land to his
neighbor, or had vowed it to the Temple, the land should in the great Iubely
nevertheless return home to ye right heirs. So that if any man had vowed a part
of his land unto the Lord, the yearly rent thereof, according to the value, was
to be paid unto the Priests until the year of Iubely came. Thus ye know to
what use and purpose the vow went to the finding and increasing of the Priests
living. Read. Leu. 27.

Three manner of vows were unlawful and of none effect. What vows are
forbidden and unlawful. Maid un married.
DA vow made by a Damsel under the tuition and governance of her father,
without her fathers consent, was void and of no value: but with the consent of
her father, or he hearing that his daughter had vowed, and not reclaiming by
and by, the vow of his daughter, was to be offered in the temple, according to
the law Leuiticall before rehearsed.

A man's daughter being unmarried, Maid ha^ fasted.
but yet handfasted and promised to a man in marriage, if he to whom she should
be married, did reclaim and forbid the woman's vow, as soon as he heard it,
in that case the maiden was free from her offering otherwise she stood bound
to perform her free will offering.

A man's wife making any vow, her husband not consenting, The ma^s wife.
her vow was not to be kept: but he hearing of his wives vow and not denieng,
both he and she stood bound to y^ perfourmance of the vow. These are y^ only
lets which be expressed in Moses law, why a vow should not be performed. All
other men, and also widows making a vow, was by the law of Moses bound to pay
his vow.

The vow of the Nazarei, that is, of the abstainer, when he vowed abstinence
unto the Lord, Vow of an abstainer.
he was bound to abstain from wine, and from all manner of strong drink, and
from things that was made of grapes. Also he might not suffer his beard nor his
head to be shaueu, but the locks of his hair to grow, and the tufts of his
beard likewise. Moreover he might not be present at the death of any man,
neither father nor mother, brother nor sister. And keeping this 3. points
during his abstinence, he was an holy Nazarei, according to ye law of Moses.
This done and observed, they should come to the Temple door, and there offer an
he Lamb of a year old for a burnt offering, and a Ram for a peace offering,
with a basket of sweet Cakes sprinkled with oil for a meat offering. This
oblation done, the Nazarei was shaue^ before ye temple door, and so departed
with this blessing spoken of ye priest: Benedicat tibi Dominus, and custodiet
te, os^e^dat tibi facie^ sua^, and misereatur tui. Here is all y^ the old
Testament speaks of vows, which vows with the ceremonies and sacrifices,
were ordained by y^ Holy ghost for ye people, and for y^ time only, to ye end
partly to keep them from y^ Idolatry of ye heathen, and from y^ works of their
own inventions, and partly by these vows and Ceremonies to maintain the
Leuiticall service and ministration of the Tabernacle until the coming of
Christ, which was the end of the law. This could not be without Priests and
other inferior Ministers: nor the Priests could not be honestly and liberally
provided for without livings. Therefore God appointed unto them six things of
the which vows was one. Here is all that can be spoken of vows, taking this
word (Uowe) in his proper kind and signification. As soon therefore as ye
hear the name of a vow, by and by remember that ye are in the old Testament,
and in the bowels or in the shadow of Moses law, and clean out of the
Gospel: for by the Gospel we are clean rid from the law of Moses, both
Iudicialls and Ceremonialls, and vows were a part of the Ceremonialls.
Christian men have nothing to do with vows.
They that be of Christ's religion has no more to do with Uowes, then they have
with Burnt-offering, Peace offering, Meat offering, Altars, Censers,
Candlestickes, the Paschall Lamb, Cleansing, etc, with an infinite number more,
which as Saint Peter says, neither we nor our forefathers were able to bear.
Christ has made us free from all these baggages.

In the new Testament there is no mention made of vows, properly in their own
signification. Paul did not shave his head to establish the vovv of the
Nazareis among the christians nor in circu^cising Timothy allowed circumcision.
All that may be objected, is, where S. Paul shaued his head at Cenchrea, for
he had a vow says the text (understand the vow of the Nazarei) which place
does seem that S. Paul did allow the vows of the Nazareis, to be retained
among the Christians, which was nothing so. For in the 16. of the Acts ye shall
read that S. Paul did circumcise Timothy at Derba and Listria, not because he
allowed Circumcision, but to bear with the time, and with the weakness of
the Jews, whereby he might the better persuade them, and allure them to the
faith of Christ. For the same purpose did he shave his head in Cenchrea,
faining himself to the sight of the Jews to have been a Nazarei when he was
nothing less, but only to win the Jews by a little and a little, and was
content to use an holy and charitable dissimulation (as I might say) only for
this purpose, that he might win them to Christ. That this was S. Paul's
practice, he himself confesses, in y^. 1. Co. 9. 22. saying: I framed and
fashioned my self to please all men, only to this end, that I might win them
to Christ. This place ye see, makes nothing for the establishing of vows.

Votum, is sometime taken of the Lawiers, Propteractis and promissis ciuilibus,
as we would say: Votum
Vir iustus est vota and promissa prestare: The property of a good man and a
righteous liver, is to perform all his couenaunts and bargains. And now, this
word (Votum) is borrowed out of the old Testament. We call commonly our
profession in Baptime, a vow, which is not properly to be called a vow,
forasmuch as a vow is a work of a man's own free will. But let it be that our
profession be taken for a vow, which vow if we keep, all other monastical
vows are but vain, unprofitable, foolish, wicked and full of hypocrisy: for
either it must be granted, that these vows (as they call them) of chastity,
of purity, and of obedience, either they are works commanded of God, or else
works mo or other then God has commanded, what a blasphemous pride is it,
and what a presumpteous hypocrisy is it, to do more for our own vowing, then
for Gods commanding. Were not that soldier worthy of wages, that would do
nothing at the commandment of his Captain, but that which he first had vowed
of his own free will to serve his Captain. And again, Soldier
If we do other things then those which God has commanded us, all our labor
is but in vain. For Christ says, Frustra colunt ^me, docentes doctrinas and
mandata hominu^. Ri. Tur. Look. Widow.

Of the vow of the Nazarite.
As touching the vow of y^ Nazarits, Vow of the Nazarites.
as it is manifestly set forth in the 6. of Number. But those things which are
there written may all be reduced to three principal points. The first was, they
should drink no wine, nor strong drink, nor any thing that might make them
drunk. Another was, that they should not poll their head: but all that time the
Nazarite should let his hair grow. The third was that they should not defile
themselves with mourning for vnrialls, no, not at the death of their father or
mother. These things were to be observed only for some certain time, for he
vowed to be a Nazarite, but for certain number of days, months or years. Pet
Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 201.

Of the godly vow of Staupitius.

Hereafter. I will make no such vow: for I have now learned by experience, that
I am not able to perform it. Unles therefore God be favorable and merciful
unto me for Christ's sake and grant unto me a blessed and an happy hour when I
shall depart out of this miserable life, I shall not be able with all my vows,
and all my good deeds, to stand before him. This was not only a true but also
a godly and an holy desperation: and this must al they confess both with mouth
and heart, which will be saved For y^ godly trust not in their own
righteousness, Psa. 143. 2
but say with David: Enter not into judgment with thy servant. Luther upon
the Gal. fol. 251.

VRIM AND THVMIM.
What they do signify.
VRim and Thumim are Hebrew words. Vrim signifies light, and Thumim
perfectness, Exo. 28. 30
and I think the one were stones, that did glister and had light in them, and
the other clear stones as Crystal, and the light betokened the light of Gods
word, and the pureness, clean living according to the same, and was thereof
called the example of the children of Israel, because it put them in
remembrance to seek Gods word, and to do there after. T. M. Vrim and Thumim
signify light and perfectnes, out of ye which it pleased God to give
aunsweres, oracles and judgments, but what they were it does not well appear
to any writer. They were placed in the Priests breast, to admonish him, that he
ought to shine in doctrine, and to be perfect in conversation of life. The
Bible note.

Vrim signifies light, and Thumim perfectness: declaring that the stones of
the breast plate were most clear and of perfect beauty: by Vrim also is meant
knowledge, and Thumim holiness, showing what virtues are required in the
Priests. Geneua.

The meaning of these places following.
But the Lord answered him not, neither by dream, nor by Vrim. 1. Re. 28. 6.
Of Vrim is spoken Nu. 27. 21. God would not that the high Priest should give
Saul answer at this time, and therefore suffered not to see his will in Vrim,
as he was wont to do: or happily he saw his will, but saw therewith that he
should not show it to Saul. T. M.

Who shall ask counsel for him by the judgment of Vrim. N^. 27. 31
According to his office signifieng y^ the civil magistrate could execute
nothing but y^ which he knew to be y^ will of God. Ge.

US.
How this word signifies mo persons then one.
LEt us make man in our Image. Genesis 1. 26.
Moses speaks in y^ plural number, signifieng mo persons to be in God, and
that the father in the creation of man consulted with his wisdom and spirit.
The Bible note.

God commanded the water to bring forth other creatures: but of man he says,
Let us make: signifieng that God takes counsel with his wisdom and virtue,
purposing to make an excellent work above all the rest of his creation. Geneua.

The meaning of this place following.
They went out from us, but they were not of us. 1. Ioh. 2. 1^
Hereby do we learn, that they that fall away from among the elect and
chosen of God, yet they be none of the members of them For if they were of them
they would continue and abide with them. Since then that they fall away from the
known truth, they do plainly declare thereby, that they were none of the true
elect and chosen of God, but were plain hipocrites, which for a tune did shine
in the Church with fained holiness, whereas in wardlye they were filled with
all kind of infidelity and unbelief, which they cloaked as long as they
could, till they were by the righteous judgment of God manifested and opened
at length, and such shall the Church have unto the worlds end. I. Veron.

VSVRIE.
The definition of usury.
Usury according to the schoolmen is said to be a gain that comes through
lending by covenant, or by chief intent or purpose. As for example: I do
lend to receive more then I laid out: I do covenant to have more, and my
chief purpose in laieng out my money is, by my principal to increase my
stock, and hope by my lending to receive an overplus: for where these 3. things
concur together, lending, gain and a principal or chief purpose to increse
wel^are, in such deling, usury is always most certainly known. Other define
usury thus: usury is whatsoever is taken for ye love above ye principal: usury
is a certain gain due or exacted for le^ding or by covenant agreed upon. S.
Barnard says that Usury is a lawful theft or a theft in law. The civil law
it self, or rather the Emperor Justinians statute, tells before hand what
is intended, y^ is to rob by order and sufferance of law. Usury is also said to
be ye price of time, or of y^ delaieng or forbering of money. Mela^ctho^ does
define usury on this manner: usury or fenory is a gain demanded above the
principal, only for the benefit or pleasure showed in lending. D. Wilson.
fol. 85.

What usury is.
S. Hierom. li. 6. upon Ezechiel, writes on this wise: Hierom
some folks do surmise that usury does consist only in money, which the
scripture of God did foresee, and therefore takes away the overplus of all
things. Item, others are w^nt to take sundry sorts of rewards or presents for
their lending of their money, and does not understand that the Scripture does
call that an usury and an overplus, whatsoever it be, that they receive again
more then that which they gave. Mus. fol. 579.

S. Ambrose Ambrose
speaking of Naboth says: that many men to avoid the danger of the
commandments of the law when they have given out their money unto occupiers
and merchaunt men, do not demand their vsuries in money, but do take the
commodity and profit of usury upon their wares. Therefore let them hearken what
the law says: Nor you shall not take any usury of meats, nor of any other
thing. So that a dish of meat is usury, and a garment is usury, and whatsoever
comes above the principal is usury, and what name soever ye give it. yet it
is usury. Muscu. fol. 579.

S. Austen defines usury on this sort: In case thou lend out thy money to any
man, Augustine
of whom thou look to receive more then thou deliueredst forth, not money
only, but many thing else, more then thou deliueredst forth, whether it be
Corn, or wine, or Oil or any other thing: if thou look to receive any more
then thou deliueredst, thou art an usurer and worthy to be blamed. Muscu. fol.
579.

Chrysostom does compare the joy of them, which do take money upon usury,
Chrisosto^
unto the biting of an Adder: for like as he which is bitten with an Adder,
falls with a certain delight into sleep, and in the sweetness of his deadly
sleep dies by reason that by y^ means of his sleeping, y^ poison passes
over, throughout all y^ parts of his body: so he which receives money upon
interest, does so rejoice for ye present, as if had received a good turn the
usury does in continuance, so suck up his substance, that it turns it all
into debt. Muscu. fol. 580.

Usury is, when more is required then was delivered or given: As if thou
deliuerest ten shillings and seek more. Or if thou deliver a bushel of
wheat, and receiuest above that, that is usury. In the Decrees the. 14. cause.
and 3. question. capite vsura. I. N.

Why God has forbidden usury.
God has forbidden usury, adding this reason: Psalm. 15.
If my people happen to be brought low, thou shall not grieve him with usury.
We see that the law was made to the end that men should not cruelly oppress
the poor, who were worthy to be pit^^ed rather. Now although the law which God
gave to the Jews peculiarly, were but politic: yet not withstanding this
vprightues that we should not devour such as are miserable and bare, is common
to al nations and to al ages. Where upon it follows y^ under unlawful usury is
not comprehended the gain y^ a man makes of the lone of his money, without y^
hurt of any person. Also the name of ( Neshed) which David uses, being derived
of (Biting) declares sufficiently y^ usurers are condemned so far forth as
they draw with the^ a liberty to pil and poll. Surely Eze. y.^ 18. and ve. 17.
and the. 22. ver. 12. seems to condemn any kind of overplus. Notwithstanding
there is no doubt but he had respect to wrongful and polling policies of
gaining, wherewith y^ rich sort did bite ye needy. Now then at a word, if the
rule of uprightness which Christ prescribes. Ma. 7. 12. be graven in our
hearts, so as every man do to his neighbor, as he would be done unto himself,
there should need no long disputation concerning usury. Calvin.

A place of Cato for usurers.
Cato does match usury and manslaughter almost in one degree: Cato
because it is the purpose of such kind of people to suck other men's blood.
For it is a very unmeet thing, that while all other men get their living
painefully by their travail (as the Plowman by tiring himself with daily
woork, the handye crafts men by serving other folks turns with sore
sweating, and the Merchant men not only by busieng themselves with labors,
but also by undertaking many inconveniences and dangers) only the
money-mongers sitting still, should take tribute of every man's labors.

Against the usurer that alleges to have no trade to live by, but only by
the lone of his money.
The usurer also presumes to say: Aug. psa. 128.
I have none other trade to live by: so may the strong thief say when he is
taken by the throat with the manner: so may the buggerer say when he is laid
hand on for committing buggery: so may the bawd say that sells young maidens
to be common harlots: so may the Sorcerer say, when he or she inchaunteth evil
things, and sell their inchauntments. And whatsoever like thing we should go
about to forbid, they might all answer, they had none other way to live by,
and to find themselves, as though this were not chiefly to be punished in
them, because they have learned the art or occupation of wickedness to get their
living by it, and will thereby feed themselves, whereby they offend him, by
whom we are all fed. Thus far Augustine. D. Wilson. fol. 71.

How the decrees of the Canon law, does straightly forbid usury.
NO man shall enter into holy orders or be of the ministry, 33. d. Martis d.
46. seditio.
that by law is convicted and found to put out his money to usury. And in
another place: We do ordeine, that no usurer, shall be made one of the
Clergy.

It was ordained in the Nice. Council, that such of the Clergy as put out
their money for usury, Consiliu^ Nicen. 18
taking twelve in the hundred or less, shall be degraded from all their
degrees of Ecclesiastical office, and made irriguler, because they have sought
to live by filthy gain, contrary to the express word of God.

Pope Martin in the Council he called, Ex conci. Ma. Papa.
says: If a man forgetting the fear of God and the holy scriptures which do
say (He that has not given his money to usury, shall enter into the Tabernacle
of God) do after knowledge had of this general council commit usury, or take
Centesimam vsuram, which is twelve in the hundred, or by any filthy trade does
make his gain, taking for diverse sorts of things, for either wine or corn or
any other thing else by buying and selling, more then he has laid out, shall
be put out of the Clergy for ever.

Pope Leo does also forbid the same in the laity, being very sorry y^ any
christian man should be an usurer, saying: that y^ Clergy ought to be the more
sharply punished for such offense, because all others should be the more afraid
to offend, when the Clergy is not spared. The decree says further, that no
alms ought to be given of evil gotten good, which cannot be worse gotten then
by usury.

A statute made against usury, by a Christian Emperor called Leo.
Although (says this godly Emperor) many of our ancestors have thought that
lending for usury might be admitted, Hermeno polus. li. 3 tit. 7
and only for that the creditours were so hard, and as men loath else to lend:
yet we have thought it most unworthy among the Christians, and to be utterly
abhorred and eschewed as a thing forbidden by the law of God. Therefore our
Majesty does command, that it be not lawful for any man to take usury for
any cause, least whiles we go about to keep the laws and statutes of men, we
do transgress thereby the law of God. But whatsoever any man does take, the
same shall be received into the principal.

Places of scripture against usury.
If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, Exo. 22. 25
thou shall not be an usurer unto him, neither shall thou oppress him with
usury.

If thy brother be waxen poor, Le. 25. 3^.
and fallen into decay with thee, receive him as a stranger or a soiourner, and
let him live by thee, and thou shall take no usury of him, nor yet vantage, but
shall fear thy God, that thy brother may live with thee, thou shall not lend
him thy money upon usury, or lend him of thy food to have an advantage by it,
for I am y^ Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give
you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.

Lord who shall enter into thy Tabernacle: Psa. 15. 1. and. 5
he answers, He that gives not his money upon usury, and takes no reward
against the innocent.

The soul y^ sins shall dye: Eze. 18. 5. and. 6.
If a man be godly, and do that is equal and right, y^ takes not other men's
goods by violence, y^ parts his meat to the hungry, that clotheth ye naked,
that lends nothing upon usury, y^ takes nothing over, this is a righteous
man, he shall surely live says the Lord: but he that greeueth the poor and
needy, y^ robs and spoileth, that gives not the debtor his pledge again,
y^ lends upon usury, and takes more over, shall this man live? no, he shall
not live, seeing he has done al these abominations, he shall dye, and his
blood shall be upon him.

Of whom a man may take usury.
Unto a stranger thou may lend upon usury, De. 23. 20
etc. This was permitted for a time, for the hardness of their hearts.

Ask usury of him only whom thou desire worthily to hurt, and with whom
thou may lawfully wage battle, for of him thou may lawfully demand
usury, and be bold to bite him therewith: because thou may kill him without
offense. He fights without weapon, that takes vsurye, yea, he does revenge
himself of his enemy without any sword, that does exaxt usury of his
enemy. And truly there is no cunninger way to undo a man, then by vsurye,
for under the color of pleasuring him, he is undone before he be aware. D.
Wilson. fol. 23.

Lend one to another, Luke 6. 35
hoping for nothing over and above that you did lend, whereby not only all
contracts and vsuries upon lone in respect of time are forbidden: but the very
hope also to look for a good turn again, or any thing else, over and above
the principal, is utterly barred and clean taken away. Neither is your
exposition sound Master Ciuilian in this behalf, that would have Christ's
meaning to be, Lend.
that men should never look for their principal again, for then Christ might
have said, give freely^ whereby is included a clear renouncing to ask back a
gift given, whereas in ^^nding it was never so meant in common reason, that a
man should never hope to have his own again. Neither will men loose their
principal, except some great matter move them, as the extreme poverty of the
party, or some other like thing, etc.

WAY.
What it is to prepare the way and path of the Lord.
PRepare ye the way of the Lord, Math. 3. 3
make his paths straight. To prepare the way of the Lord, is to receive gladly
his grace being offered unto us, and with repentance and amendment of life,
to pass away those things that may offend the eyes of his divine majesty.

To make his paths Path.
straight, is to interpret or expound his holy law after the spirit, and to
seek Jesus in the spirit. For they y^ do yet stick to the letter of the law,
and seek to be justified by their own works, knowing not the righteousness
of God, which consists in the spirit, faith, and truth, do walk in crooked
paths. Sir. I. Cheek.

Prepare ye the way of the Lord. Esaias. 40. ^
Meaning Cyrus and Darius, which should deliver Gods people out of captivity,
and make them a ready way to Jerusalem. And this was fully accomplished when
John the Baptist brought tidings of Jesus Christ's coming, who was the true
deliverer of his Church from sin and Satan. Math. 3. 3. Geneua.

What the way of sinners is.
That abides not in the way of sinners, Psalm. 1. 1^
etc. The way of sinners is their manner and ordinances in which they walk,
as it were in a way. Way Way.
in the Scripture is taken for whatsoever we do or go about, be it good or
bad, as in the last verse of this Psalm. T. M.

What the way of truth is.
I have chosen the way of truth. Psa. 119. 30
The way of truth is the life that is ordered after the word of truth which is
contained in the Scripture. Way of truth.
Therein says David that he has walked, and not in feined traditions and
holiness, imagined by himself, or by any mortal man. In y^ same
signification uses S. Peter this word. 2. Pet. 2. 1. and 2. There shall be
false teachers, etc. by which the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. T. M.

Take from me the way of lieng. Pas. 119. 29
Instruct me in thy word, whereby my mind may be purged from vanity, and
taught to obey thy will. Geneua.

WALK.
What it is to walk with God.
TO walk with God is to live godly, Genesis 5. 22.
and to walk in his commandments: Enoch walked with God, and was no more
seen, he lived godly and dyed. God took him away, that is, hid his body as
he did Moses and Aaron, least happily they should have made an Idol of him, for
he was a great preacher and an holy man. Tindale.

This walking with God, Job. 34. 9
imports that a man so gives himself to the service of God, as he thinks
continually to give an account, and acknowledges in himself after this
manner: he that has created and formed, governs and guides me, I cannot
shun his hand nor escape his judgment, and therefore I must be present before
his eyes, so as he shall see, not only all my works, but also my thoughts: lo,
what it is to walk with God, etc. It is said that Enoch walked with God, and
why? Because he was not perverted, and although the whole world was at that
time as corrupt as might be, yet notwithstanding Enoch continued uncorrupted,
and whereof came that? Because he gathered his wits to him, and gave not
himself the bridle to deal disorderly: but although iniquity was a waterflud
upon the earth, yet he knew that it behooved him, to walk as in the presence of
God. Calvin upon Job.

How God is said to walk.
God is said to go and walk, Augustine
not by changing of places, for he fills all places, but by occupieng ye
minds of the faithful, as in the Prophet, I will dwell among them, and walk
among them, and be their God: where dwelling, walking, and to be their God,
mean one thing.

WALL.
What this wall was.
Has broken down the wall that was a stop between us. Ephe. 2. 14
Moses law that was the wall and cause of hate between the Jews and Gentiles
is taken away, in whose steed is love come, to love one another, as Christ
loved us. Tindale.

Broken down the wall, etc. That is, the cause of division that was between
the Jews and the Gentiles. Geneua.

VVARRES.
What manner of wars is just.
SUch a war is counted just, which is taken in hand at the comma^ndement of
the magistrate, either to demand things again, or else to put away injuries or
to reueng the^, as it is had in the 23. quest, the 2. chap. iustum, and they
are ye words of Isidorus. For first we must beware y^ war be not taken in hand,
by the authority of a private man. But the causes wherefore war may justly be
made, are these: To require things taken away, or else to repulse injury,
whereunto is agreeable that which Augustine writes in ye same place in the
chapter Dominus. Just war is that which is taken to revenge iniuryes. After
this manner wars is proclaimed against Cities, when they will not either
render things taken away, or amend those things which of theirs was unjustly
done. For if they will not punish the guilty, it is lawful for other to make
war against them. So all Israel took war against the Beniamites, that a
most wicked crime should not remain unpunished. But Augustine adds that
those wars also do especially seem just which are taken in hand by the
commandment of God, as are many which are done in the old Testament. For if
God once command to make war, we may not seek any other cause of justice,
for God knows very well what is best to be rendered to every man. For then
both Captain and soldiers are not so much to be counted authors of the
war, as ministers of God and of his law. And therefore when the people are
after this manner called to war, they ought not neglect the commandment.
Wherefore the same Augustine in his. 205. Epistle to Bonifacius the Earl a man
of war, which at that time governed Afric under Caesar. Thou ought not
(says he) to think, y^ they which with weapons serve ye publik wealth, cannot
please God. This was his proposition, whereof afterward he brings resons. For
David (says he) mode many wars, and yet was he dearly beloved of God. Pet.
Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 186.

What things are to be taken heed of in just wars.
In making of just wars (says Augustine) many things are to be taken heed
of. For it is not sufficient that the war be just except also the world be
justly handled, wherefore he admonishes his Earl: when (says he) thou
put on thine armor, remember that thy strength is the gift of God, and
determine with thy self, not to abuse that gift against God, yea, rather do
this, fight for his laws and name, let promises be kept, even with enemies,
but much more with friends, for whom thou make war, by which words he
reprehendeth those soldiers which are more grievous in Cities then the very
enemies. Of which we see in our days a great many more then we would, which
when they are in their places where they winter, it is wonderful to see how
they handle the citizens and the men of the country it is horrible to see what
filthy and abominable things they commit. He adds also the third Cantion:
Think with thy self that war must not be made, but for necessity,
wherefore let thy mind always be inclined unto peace. Make war because thou
can not otherwise do, but if thou can make peace, refuse it not. Pet. Mar.
upon Iudic. fol. 187.

The Anabaptists reasons against war.
These be their reasons: Deu. 32. 35
Mine is the vengeance, and I will requite thee the Lord.

Christ's kingdom (say they) is like the waters of Siloh, Esaias. 8. 6
which waters do run quietly and without hurly burly.

Their spears shall be turned to shares, Mich. 4. 3.
and swoords into Mattocks.

If a man give thee a blow on the right side, Mat. 5. 39.
turn thou thy left side.

He that smites with the sword, Mat. 26. 52
shall perish with the swoorde.

Let not the Cockle be pulled out till the harvest time. Mat. 13. 30
Our weapons are not carnal but spiritual. 2. Cor. 10. 3


Who that will read S. Austen to Marcellinus in the first Epistle, and to
Faustus Manichaeus the, 22 book, and in Chrysostom upon these words: Do not
resist the evil: shall have all these places answered.

Reasons for war.
A time of war, and a time of peace. Eccles. 3. 8. David says in. 144.
Psalm. Blessed is God which teaches my hands to fight, and my fingers to
battle. David's fingers were fighting fingers, yet David's fingers were holy
fingers. In the book of Kings David says thus to Saul: Thou fightest the
Lords battles: And Abigal says to David: Thou fightest the Lords battles.
If some wars be Gods wars, then all wars are not forbidden. The Baptist
does seem to allow of Soldiers, for he gives them rules of life, as that
they should hurt no man, and that they should be content with their own wages.
Paul would have himself lead to Caesaria by strength of soldiers. Our Savior
does say, give unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. That which was given to
Caesar was tribute, given to find soldiers, as Augustine does often say. Now,
reasons why there should be wepons, there be many. But this is y^ special reason
which ye Cantons, where every man wereth a weapon allege for their so doing,
that the magistrate and country may be assisted and defended. And every man do
wear wepon, and ought to wear wepon for the magistrate, and ought not only to
wear it, but also to draw it at the Magistrates voice, and to do as it is
said in the. 3. book and fourth Chapter of Esdras: If the king alone say, Do
kill, they do kill: If he say: do forgive they forgive: If he say smite, they
do smite: If he say banish: they do banish: If he say cut off, they cut off. I
say, if the people ought thus to do for ye Prince and magistrate, to draw their
weapons in his cause, and to lay down their life at their foot: how much more
ought the magistrate for his own cause and for all their causes to bear
weapon, and not to bear it in vain, but to purpose, etc. T. Draut.

Wars sent of God
And sent forth his warriors to destroy those murderers. Mat. 22. 7.
This was done by the Emperors of Rome, Vespatianus and Titus, which destroyed
Jerusalem, and slew above eleven hundred thousand men: Note that the Romans
are here called the armies of the Lord, even as they of the Assirians, is in
the Prophet, called the servants of God, because that by him, God did punish
his people. Sir. I. Cheek.

WASHING.
Whereunto the washing of feet had relation.
IN those places that are extreme hot, when men have done their journey they
use to wash their beete, and to wipe away the dust, which office was sometime
showed unto Christ our savior. And he again executed the same unto his
Apopostles. Paul also required this of good widows, namelye, to wash the
feet of the Saints, etc. Pet. Mart. upon Iudic. fol. 252.

How this word wash is taken.
If I wash thee not. John. 13. 8.
There are some which refer this word (Wash) unto the free remiss^on of sins.
And there are other foam also which refer the same to newness of life. And a
third forte upon a good consideration refer it to both. For Christ washes
us when he wipeth away our sins, by the offering up himself, least they
should come into judgment. Moreover he washes us, when by his holy spirit, he
abolisheth the wicked and sinful desires of the flesh. Marl. upon John. fol.
461.

Ye also ought to wash one another feet. ^ab. 13. 14.
The Bishop of Rome too apishly foolloweth Christ in many things. And in this
he would seem to follow Christ, washing once in a year, the feet of certain
poor folks, which have been washed before, and not only washed, but also
perfumed, with sweet odours and waters. And thus by a bare and naked ceremony,
they think that they have done very well. And when they have done it, they can
be con^e^ted, to contemn their brethren, and cruelly to tear the members of
Christ and to spit in his face. Wherefore that comminical pomp, is nothing
else, but a filthy scorning of Christ. And verily Christ does not here commend
unto us a yearly ceremony: but commands us all our life time to be ready
to wash our bretherens feet.

When Abigal said to the messengers of David, Behold, let thine handmaide be a
servant to wash the feet of the servants of my Lord: she meant not such a
counterfeit service, as the imitating enemies of Christ do use, but she meant
that she would be so obedient, loyal, and seruable to David, that she would
not refuse to wash, even the feet of his servants. So Saint Paul understood
washing of the feet, when he required the good and virtuous widow to be a
washer of the Saints feet, that is to say, to be serueable to them in each
point, Christ says not, ye ought to wash my feet, but to wash one an others
feet. Marl. upon John. fol. 463.

Saint Augustine ad Iannar. says thus: If thou demand upon what
consideration this ceremony of washing feet first began, notwithstanding I
have well thought of it, How the ceremony of washing came up first.
yet can I find nothing that seems more likely then this. For that the
bodies of them that had appointed to be baptized (at Easter) being ill
cherished by reason of the lenten fast, would have had some loathsomeness in the
touching, unless they ^ad been washed at sometime before. And that therefore
they chose this day chiefly to that purpose, upon which day the Lords supper
is yearly celebrated. Here Saint Austen says it was the fulsomnesse of the
bodies, and loathsomenesse of the senses, that first began this ceremonye, and
not the institution or commandment of Christ.

What is signified by washing of Christ's Disciples feet.
And began to was his Disciples feet. John. 13
He washed their feet to declare that he came to minister unto other, and
not be ministered unto. And further to teach by this washing, that his
ministration was to purge and wash away the ^ilth of sin, which is done by
the shedding of his blood: for the blood of Christ sprinkled into our hearts by
the word of his Gospel, and received by says, cleanses us from all sin.
Tindale.

He that is washed, John. 13.
needs, not save to wash his feet. Whosoever is washed, that is to say,
whosoever believes in the blood of Christ, which does wash away all our sins
he is clean, but yet he has need to wash his feet, that is to say: he has
need with continual watch to came his carnal affections, and fleshly
concupiscenses, daily with a true repentant heart. flieng unto the Lord for
mercy and pardon of his sins.

Here they be confounded that affirm us to be without sin, after we be
regenerate. Sir. I. Cheek.

Save to wash his feet. John. 13. 10
That is to be continually purged of his corrupt affections, and worldly cares
which remain daily in us. Geneua.

VVAST SEA.

Look. Babylon.

VVATCH.
What it is to watch.
WAtch is not only to abstain from sleep, but also to be circumspect, and to
cast all perils, as a man should watch a Tower or Castle: we must remember
that the snares of the devil are infinite and innumerable, and that every
moment arise new temptations, and that in all places meet us fresh occasions,
against which we must prepare our selves and turn to God, and complain to him
and make our move, and desire^ him of his mercy to be our shield, our tower,
our castle, and defense from all evil, to put his strength in us) for with out
him we can do nothing) and above all thing we must call to mind what promises
God has made, and what he has sworn, that he will do to us for Christ's
sake, and with strong faith cleave unto them, and desire him of his mercy, and
for the love he has to Christ, and for his truths sake to fulfill his
promises. If we thus cleave to God with strong faith and believe his words.
Then (as says Paul) God is faithful that he will not suffer us to be tempted
above that we are able, or above our strength, that is to say^, if we cleave to
his promises, and not to our own fantasies and imaginations, he will put might
and power into us, that shall be stronger then all temptations, which he shall
suffer to be against us. Tindale. fo. 81.

What is understood by watchmen.
For his watchmen are all blind, Esa. 56. 10
etc. By those blind watchmen, understand the chief Priests, y^ Scribes and
Pharesies, etc. which were the peruerters and deprauers of the law of God.
These for filthy lucre sake abolished the true service of God, and were the
chief causers of the forsaking of Israel. They were sluggish and sought not
that which was for the edification of the people and for the glory of God, but
that which was for their own private profit and pleasure. They were slothful
to root out vice and to plant virtue, and driven into the profound deep
sleep of ignorance, of idleness, of lecherousnesse, and of pride. As often as
the Prelates of the people, Bishops, Abbots, and they that auaunt themselves
for religious be such, there hangs a great scourge over the whole flock of
Christ. T. M.

He shows that the affliction shall come, through the fault of the governors,
Prophets and pastors, whose ignorance, negligence, avarice and obstinacy,
provoke Gods wrath against them. Geneua.

I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel. Eze. 3. 17.
By this watchman are figured, Bishops, Priests, and Preachers, which must take
the occasion of their speaking and exhorting, at the mouth of God, and speak
not in their own but in his name. T. M.

He shows that the people ought to have continually governors and teach^rs
which may have a care oner them, and ^o warn the^ ever of ye dangers which
are at hand, Eze. 33. 2. Ge.

The meaning of this place following.
The voice of thy watchmen shall be heard. Esaias. 52. 8
The Prophets which are thy watchmen shall publish this thy deliverance. This
was begun under Zorobabel, Ezra and Nehemiah, but was accomplished under
Christ. Geneua.

Of the watchman that Daniel speaks of.
And behold a watchman, Dan. 4. 1^
and an holy one came down from heaven. Meaning the Angel o^ God, which
neither eats nor sleeps, but is ever ready to do Gods will, and is not
infect with man's corruption, but is ever holy, and in that that he commands
to cut down this tree, ^e knew that it should not be cut down by man, but by
God. Geneua.

What the fourth watch means.
And in the fourth watch of the night. Mat. 14. 23
The Hebrews divided the night in^o ^oure parts, which they called the four
watches, wherefore the fourth watch was next to the morning, and was called the
morning watch. As in the. 1. Reg. 11. 11. Tindale.

WATER.
How it is not water that does wash away our sins.
ARise and be baptized, Act. 22. 16
and wash away thy sins. We ought not to think that water washes away our
sins, but ye mercy and grace of God which is signified and represented unto
us by the water. Ye shall note that by a figure named Allocosis, the same is
ascribed unto the outward sign, which does only perteine unto the grace and
election of God. Sir. I. Cheek.

He shows that sins cannot be washed away but by Christ, who is the substance
of Baptime: in whom also is comprehended the father and the holy Ghost. Geneua.

The meaning of this place following.
Whosoe^er drinks of this water, etc. To drink this water, is to believe and
credit the word of God, and to receive ye testimony of Christ, which thing
only can quench the thirst of the soul. Sir. I. Cheek.

What is signified by water and spirit.
Except a man be borne of water and spirit. Water and spirit.
Here by the water he understands the word and grace of God, John. 3. 5
and also the illumination of the holy Ghost, which is that heavenly water that
Esaias the Prophet does speak of, saying, All that be a thirst, come unto the
waters. John. 4. 14. and. 7. 38. Iere. 2. 13. By the spirit he understands
the inspiration of the holy Ghost, and the heavenly working of the spirit of
God. So that this place helps them nothing, that do affirm that the
children of the faithful are damned, and that they shall never enter into the
kingdom of heaven, if they dye before they can be baptized. Sir. I. Cheek.

This place of John is not to be understood of the outward sign of holy
Baptime, but simply of the inward and most spiritual regeneration of the holy
spirit, which when Nichodemus understood not perfectly, the Lord figured and
made the same manifest by Parables of water and of the spirit, that is to say,
of the wind or the air, by Elements very base and familyar, for by an by he
adds, That which is borne of flesh, is flesh, etc. Again, The wind blows
where it lysteth, etc. Which must needs be meant of the air. For the other
part of the comparison follows, So is every one that is borne of the spirit.
Bullinger. fol. 1048.

By this is signified the Baptime which is the mortification of the flesh
preached by John Baptyst, and the renewing of the spirit, which is remission of
sins obtained by Christ. Tindale.

What the water of Siloh does signify.
For So Much as the people refuse the still running water of Siloh, Water of
Siloh.
etc. Esaias. 8. 6
He calls the kingdom of David, which figureth the kingdom of Christ, the
still running water of Siloh, which thing agrees very well unto Christ, that
was meek and lowlye of heart. Math. 11. 29. Zach. 9. 9. Behold thy king
comes unto thee, poor and lowly, etc. He reigns in still and peaceable
consciences. Siloh was a spring at the foot of the hill of Syon, which has
not continally water, but spring^th certain hours and days, and comes with
a great sound, by the bottom of the ground, and rifts and holes of an hard
rock: The manner of speaking is borrowed of the despised littleness of the
water, which signifies the small estimation and poverty of the christen. T. M.

Look. Siloh.

What is meant by the water of the Sea.
The water of the sea shall be drawn out. Esaias 19. 5
Nilus shall sink away and be drunk up. The water of the sea, etc. Aegipt (as
stories show) receives no rain forth of the air, but is ouerflowed with y^
water Nilus, at certain times. 14. 15. or 16. cubits high from the ground, for
if it increse to any less height, the Country scapeth not a dearth says
Pliny. And therefore by the scarceness and want of water is the desolation of
the land described. Nilus is here called by diverse names.

Sometime the Sea, sometime rivers, sometime wells, sometime pondes, etc. For
that fludde runs seven sundry ways, and it is called the Sea, not only
because the Hebrews call all congregations of waters the Sea generallye, but
also because it was of old time a constant opinion after the stories, that it
has his original beginning from the Occean Sea. Ye may also understand by the
dryness of Nilus, Nilus.
that it ouerflowed not the land, contrary to the old accustomed manner
thereof. Some had leauer have this to be figuratively applied. As there be
certain waters of the Gospel, which the holy Ghost gives, so are there also
the troubel^us waters of Egypt, that is, of worldly doctrine. Therefore when
the word of God is ouerheard, those waters dry us. For the holy Ghost
reprehendeth the world of sin, and opens and declares the works of
darkness. In these waters do Reed and Rush grow, that is, vain and trifling
works, such as are the works of hipocrits, which after the outward show and
appearance seem fresh, but are within, vain and naught worth.

He shows that the Sea, and Nilus their great river, whereby they thought
themselves most sure, (...)
should not be able to defend them from his anger, but that he would ^^nd
the Assirians among them, that they should keep them under as slaves. Geneua.

The meaning of this place following.
Jesus Christ that came by water and blood. 1. John. 5. 6
The water and blood that came out of his side, declare that we hau^ our sins
washed by him, and he has made full satisfaction for the same. Geneua.

How water in the Sacrament signifies the people.
The people is anexed in the Sacrament, through the mixture of water, therefore
I meru(...)le much that they are so contentions and will not see, Water in the
sacrament.
that as the water is the people, so the wine is Christ's body, that is to say
in a mystery, because it represents Christ's blood, as the water does the
people. Cipriane ad (...).

Whiles in the Sacrament water is anne^ed with the wine, Eusebius.
the faithful people is incorporate and joined with Christ, and is made one
with him, with a certain knot of per^^ct charity. Now whereas he says, that
we are joined and incorporate with Christ, what fondness were it to contend,
since we are there only in a mystery and not naturallye. I. Frith.

VVAVE OFFERING.
What it signified.
ANd wave them for a wave offering. Ex. ^9. 24
This sort of offering^ after the Priest had lif(...)d up, was moved into every
side of all coasts, to signify that God was Lord of all the earth. The Bible
note.

This sacrifice, the Priest did move toward the East, West, North, and South

WEDDING GARMENT.
What the wedding garment is, and who be clothed therewith.
WHich had not on a wedding garment. Mat. 22. 11
Many do in vain here contend about the wedding garment, whether it be fay
^, or an holy and godly life: Seeing that faith can neither be separated from
good workes^ neither can good works proceed but from faith. But the only
meaning of our Savior Christ was this, that we are called of the Lords upon
this condition, that we should by the spirit be made like unto him. And
therefore that we might continuallye abide in his house, we must put off the
old man, with all his pollutions and defiling spots of sin, and must frame
and give our selves to a new life, that our apparel may answer so
honorable a calling. They therefore are clothed with this wedding garment,
which have put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and the new man, which after God is
shaped in righteousness and holiness, and as the wedding garment does declare
the mind to be joyful affected toward the wedding dinner, and to reverence
the same, even so also by this wedding garment, there is required that the
guest^ be such, which with joy, with reverence of the divine majesty, and with
giving of thanks, should obtain and enjoy the heavenly benefits. Marl. fol
499.

The wedding garment is Christ himself, whom in Baptime we put on through
^aith: where from proceeds love and charity, which is the common badge of
all true faithful christians. Sir. I. Cheek.

They that with their mouths do profess the Gospel, and the true christian
religion, and so do associate and a fellowship them^elues with the church and
congregation, and be not inwardly sanctified with the spirit of God, be
without the bridegromes liu^rie.

Faith in Christ's blood makes the marriage between our souls and Christ and
is properly called the marriage garment or the sign. Tindale.

VVEDLOCKE.
Look. Marriage.

VVEAKE AND SICK.
The meaning of Saint Paul in this place.
FOr this cause many are weak and sick among you. 1. Cor. 11. 30
For this cause, that is, ^or lack of good examining of our selves, many are
weak and sick in the faith, and many asleep, and have lost their faith in
Christ's blood, for lack of remembrance of his body breaking and bloudshedding,
and not y^ only, but many are weak and sick, even stricken with bodily diseases,
for abusing the Sacrament of his body, eating the bread with their teeth, and
not his body with their heart and mind, and peradventure some slain for it by
the stroke of God, which if they had truly judged and examined themselves, for
what intent they came thither, and why it was instituted, should not have been
so judged and chastened of the Lord. For the Lord does chasten to bring us to
repentance, and to mortify our rebellious members, that we may remember him.
Here ye may shortly perceive the mind of Paul. Tindale. fol. 164.

Look. Examine.

WEEKS.
How the weeks in Daniels prophecy be taken.
A Week in Daniels prophecy, Dan. 9. 25.
is not taken for a week of days, but for a week of years, so that every
week is counted for seven years. And the half year that he speaks of, is
taken for ye three years and an half, wherein Christ here in earth stablished
his Testament.

A week is taken for seven years As in Leuit. 25. 8. where the 70. weeks
that Daniel speaks of, are. 190 years. T. M.

Then number 7. weeks of years. Leuit. 25. 8
A week is sometimes taken for ye number of 7. days, as before. 23. 15.
sometime for y^ number of 7. years, as here and in Dan. 9. ver. 24. 25. 26.

WELLES.
What the wells of the Savior are.
WIth joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of the Savior. Esaias. 12. 2
The wells of the Savior are, the word of God, the doctrine of the Gospel and
promises of Christ, wherewith trembling souls and afflicted consciences are
refreshed. Out of these (says he) that they shall draw water: not out of men's
traditions, which are but puddles. T. M.

The graces of God shall be so abundant, Esaias. 12. 3
that ye may receive them in as great plenty, as waters out of a fountain^
that is full. Geneua.

Look. Us.

WEEP.
Causes why we should weep.
AVgustine in his 4. Sermon of the first Sundaye in Lent, writes that there
be two causes of true repentance, that brings forth weeping. One is, for
because we have through negligence omitted many things, which we ought not to
have done. These are commonly called sins of committing and omitting. And in ye
same place he interprets this sentence (Bring forth worthy fruit of
repentance) after this manner, that we should weep for the sins already
committed, and we should take heed that we do not the same again Chrysostom
also upon the Epistle to the Collossians, the. 12. homely complains that the
christians abused tears. And when as otherwise tears are good creatures of
God, they defame them in adjoining them to those things which deserve not
weeping. Sins only (says he) are to be wept for, not only our own sins,
but other men's also. Which Paul performed in very deed, who in the second to
the Corinthians, said, That he was afraid not to come unto them, but so that
he was dejected and compelled to weep for very many, which had fallen and not
repented. Yea, and he exhorted the same Corinthians to weep for other men's
sins, when in the first Epistle he said, Ye are puffed up, and ye have not
mourned, namely, for the grievous crime of an incestuous man. And David in his.
119. Psalm writes: Mine eyes have brought forth rivers of waters, because
they have not kept thy law. That holy Prophet wept, because of y^ public
transgressions of the law, and when he saw the same transgressions
perpretated, he abundantly powered out tears, etc. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol.
63.

How godly men do easilier weep then laugh.
Ezechiel in the. 8. chapter commended certain which wept for the wicked acts
of other men. And hereof it comes that when holy men see horrible spectacles
of sinners oftentimes to happen, they easilyer burst forth into tears, then
into laughter, for so Christ used, whom we read to have oftentimes wept, but
never to have laughed, which self same thing also we must do at this day,
when as so great and evil an harvest of sins does on every side offer it self
unto us. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fol. 63.

WHY.
Why God does this or that, we ought no^ to ask.
WHen it is asked (says S. Austen Augustine.
) why God did this thing or that thing, we must answer that he did it because
y^ it was his will so to do. If thou go any farther asking, why it was his
will so to do, thou do ask a thing which is both greater and higher then
ye will of God, which thing cannot be found out. Aug. cont. Mad. li. 1. cap. 3.

Why God does more for one, then for another.
If a man do ask, why God does show mercy more to one then to another. S.
Austen Augustine.
makes answer by an apt similitude, on this wise: If a man have many debtors
that does owe unto him the like sum of money, does it not lie in his power to
forgive some of them the whole debt, and to call upon the other for the whole
sum, who can lay any thing to his charge for so doing. Then mark (says he) we
are all debtors unto God, and have all deserved everlasting damnation, that he
does then of mere mercy and goodness forgive some, and to some again he does
according to righteous judgment, who shall be so bold to blame him for it? I.
Veron.

Why does not God (will some say) give his grace to all alike, Augustine.
when his word is preached, but suffers some to receive it, and other to
despise it. S. Luke. in the Act. 13. 48. And they (says he) did believe y^
were ordained before to life everlasting. Again he could do it, says S.
Austen, because he is almighty: and why then does he it not? because (says he)
that he will not. And why he will not, that do we leave unto him. Veron.

WHITE.
What is understood by the white horse.
BY the white horse, Apoc. 6. 2.
may be understood the first state of the christian Church without blemish. By
the second seal and red horse, understand the state of the kingdom of Christ,
in y^ time of y^ martirs. By ye third scale, and the beast, y^ black horse,
balance and measure, understand dearth and want of victuals, with ye portion
that was allowed for one man, for his days spending, which happened to all the
world, either when Claudius or ^raianus reigned Emperors. By the fourth seal,
the beast, the voice, and the pale horse, understand the heretics, which
diverse ways vex the holy Church with false doctrine. The fifth seal may
signify, the right godly Christian men. The sixth seal, the great misery and
affliction which shall rise, and be procured through Antichrist. Marl.

Look. Seal.

By the white horse is signified the Apostles, and the first disciples of
Christ, for why y^ scripture does so call them. These horses were white, they
were made pure, righteous and clean, by Jesus Christ, and bare him by their
preaching the world over. Such a white horse to the glory of God was Paul,
when he bare the name of Christ before the Gentiles, the Kings and the Children
of Israel, etc. Bale.

What is meant by the white stone.
And will give him a white stone. Apo. 2. 17.
Arethas writes, that such a stone was wont to be given to wrastlers at games,
or else that such stones did in old time, witness the quitting of a man. Beza.

By the white stone is signified the election before God, and also everlasting
peace and confidence in the grace and favor of God unto everlasting life. Sir.
I. Cheek.

I will also give him for a token of perpetual peace and love, that pure and
precious stone Jesus Christ, so white as the Lily ^loure, innocent and clean
from all contagious vices, to be his only and whole wisdom, righteousness,
light, health, and redemption. Bale.

Look. Burnt offering.

WHOREDOM.
How whoredom is taken in the Prophet Ose.
THe use of whoredom or fornication, Ose. 4.
throughout the Prophet, is to take another God beside the true God, to serve
Images and believe in them. T. M.

How whoredom was punished by death.
Bring ye her forth, and let her be burnt. We see that the law which was
written in man's heart, taught them y^ whoredom should be punished with death,
albeit no law as yet was given Geneua.

How whoredom being suffered, spreads abrod.
Whoredom (says Basil Basil.
) stays not in one man, but inuadeth a whole City. For some one young man
comes to an harlot, and takes unto himself a fellow, and the same fellow
takes another fellow: wherefore even as fire being kindeled in a City, if
the wind blow vehemently, stays not in y^ burning of one house or two, but
spreads far and wide, and draws a great destruction with it, so this
evil being once kindled, spredeth over all parts of the City. Pet. Mar. upon
Iudi. fo. 233.

How whoredom is spued out.
As it spued out the people that were before you. Leu. 18. 28
Both for their wicked marriages, unnatural copulations, Idolatry of
spiritual whoredom with Moloch and such like abominations. Geneua.

What is called spiritual whoredom.
Offering to devils, Leu. 17. 7.
after whom they have gone a whoring. Idolatry is spiritual whoredom, because
faith toward God is broken. Geneua.

Soothsaiers to go a whoring after them. Leu. 20. 6.
To esteem sorcerers or coniurers, is spiritual whoredom or Idolatry. Genesis

WICKED.
What it is to be wicked.
I And my people are wicked. ^xo. 9. ^7.
The wicked confess their sins to their condemnation, but they cannot
believe to obtain remission. Geneua.

To be wicked, is to be without the knowledge and feeling of the goodness of
God, and without hope to receive any goodness at his hand, so that we cannot
patiently hear any of his truths, nor believe the^, neither suffer them to be
taught to other as it appears in all Psalms, and in Esaias. 57. Tindale.

The wicked are like the raging Sea y^ cannot rest. Es^. 57. 20
Their evil conscience does ever torment them, and therefore they can never
have rest. Geneua.

There is no peace (says the Lord) unto the wicked. Esa. 48. 22
Thus he speaks that the wicked hypocrites, should not abuse Gods name, in
whom was neither faith nor repentance. Geneua.

How the wicked are punished for doing wrong to the wicked.
As I have done (says Adonibesech) so God has done to me again. Iudic. 1. 7.
Here note, that the Gentiles had the knowledge of God, as says Paul Romans 1.
and that they knew the law and righteousness natural, of which Moses. Deuteronomy.
19. d. and Exo. 21. c. But in the punishment of Adonibesech, is this chiefly
to be observed, that God not only auengeth the wrong, that the wicked do to
the good, but also that which the wicked do to the wicked. The 70. Kings,
whose thumbes and great toes he cut off were wicked men, yet he is punished
for the injury and cruelty done unto them. Such an example have ye also Amos.
2. What punishment shall they have then, that cruelly slaye the good? Not small
be ye sure. T. M.

How the wicked eat not Christ's body.
He that eats Christ's body, John. 6. 54
has everlasting life: Ergo, then the wicked eat not Christ's body. He that
eats Christ's flesh and drinks his blood, abides in Christ, and Christ in
him: but the wicked abides not in Christ, nor Christ in them, Ergo, the wicked
eat not his flesh, nor drink his blood. I. Frith.

WIDOW.
Objection of the Papists.
Paul (say they) blames the widows, 1. Tim. 5.
which (after the old Jews manner chosen to serve y^ Congregation) when they
were found of the common pursse, had list afterward to marry.

Answer.
This place (says Melanct^^on Melancto^ in a little book he wrote to ^ king
Henry the. 8. in the defense of Priests marriage.
) many of the Papistike votaries, wrast it for their vows, because that there
they are said to reject their first faith, which faith some of them interpret
it of the breaking of their vow. But I will answer theret^ simply and
plainly. That which they call their first faith in that place, ought not to be
understood of such vows, but of their first and principal faith in Christ, as
a little before he says: If any man cares not for his own, and chiefly for
his own household he denies to be a faithful, and is worse then an infidel.
For Paul blames those women, which so long as they were needy, they would be
sad and modest, serving them faithfully: but afterward, when they were found of
y^ common charge, they began to wax wanton and light, and to neglect their
office. For these evil manners (says he) that they rejected their chief
faith or principal promise to God, casting off their faith whereby they should
have pleased God. For their very faith is rejected, when their conscience is
defiled. Beside this, if they contend to be spoken of vows, then are their
own selves condemned with the same text, commanding them to put back young
persons from such vows, and to receive none before 60. years old, and why
then call they it a lawful vow at 21. years? Also if there had been in those
days any such common vows, surely they had been made without any
superstition. Wherefore these new found vows of Monks and Priests are tangled
with full many wicked persuasions, etc. Look. Vow. First.

WIFE.
What a commodity she is to her husband.
ANtipater an Heathen writer, In sermon de Nuptijs, has these words:
Whosoever (says he) has not had trial of a wife and children, he is utterly
ignorant of true mutual good will. Love in wedlock is mutually showed, when
man and wife do not communicate wealth, children and hearts alone, as friends
are wont ^o do, but have their bodies in common also, which friends cannot
do. And therefore Euripides saying a^^de the deadly hate he bare unto women,
writ these verses in commendation of marriage.

The wife that gads not giglot wise.
with every flirting gill:
But honestly does keep at home,
not set to gossip still.
Is to her husband in his cares
a passing sweet delight:
She heales his sickness all, and calls
again his dieng sprite.
By fawning on his angry looks,
she turns them into smiles.
And keeps her husbands secrets close,
when friend work w^ly guil^s.
Bullinger. fol. 224. How this place following is understood.
Come not at your wives. Exo. 19. 1^
That is, when ye will serve the Lord, you shall put from you all lust and
fleshlye concupiscense, giving your selves wholly to prayer and abstinence, as
Paul teaches. 1. Cor. 7. 29. That they that had wives, should be as though
they had none. T. M.

But give your selves to prayer and abstinence, that you may at that time
attend only upon the Lord. 1. Cor. 7 5. Geneua.

The difference between a Wife and a Concubine.
Look. Concubine.

VVILDE BEASTS.
What is signified here by wild beasts.
THe wild beasts shall worship me. Esa. 43. 2^
Under the name of the beasts, signifies he also the heathen which were wild,
rude, and beastly, concerning godly knowledge, these says he, that he will
tame by the preaching of the Gospel (which thing he signifies by waters and
streams) so that they shall not hereafter do hurt in the Church, but shall
put their shoulders under the yoke of faith, and be ruled with the law of
charity. T. M.

They shall have such abundaunce of all things as they return home, even in
the dry and barraine place, that the very beasts shall feel my benefits, and
shall acknowledge them, much more men ought to be thankful for the same.
Geneua.

WILL OF GOD.
How all things come to pass by Gods will.
THese be the great and most exquisite works of God, Augu. in (...). ca. 12^
that whereas the nature of man and Angel had sinned, that is to say, had done
not that he would, but that it would, even by the same will of the creature,
whereby that was done, that the creator would not, he fulfilled that he would,
using well even evil things as good, himself in the highest degree to the
damnation of them, whom he justly fore-ordeined to punishment, and to the
salvation of them, whom he mercifully foreordeined to grace. For touching
themselves, they did that God would not, but touching the omnipotency of God,
they could no way do it. For even in this that they did against Gods will,
Gods will was fulfilled upon them or touching them: for therefore great, and
exquisite are the Lords works throughout all his will, that after a marvelous
and unspeakable manner, that is not done beside Gods will, that is done against
Gods will.

Nothing is done that proceeds not out of the inward and intelligible Court
of the sovereign Emperor, Augu. in the. 3. b. de Trinit.
according to his unspeakable Justice. For where does not the wisdom of
almighty God work that he will, which reaches from end to end strongly,
and disposes all things sweetly.

Again, S. Austen has these wordss: It is than his will only, from which is
sprung whatsoever is. Also, nothing set in man's free will, overcomes ye will
of God. And though man be against Gods will, yet against his will which is
himself, we ought to think nothing to be so done, as though he would have it to
be done, and it is not done, or y^ he would not have to be done, and it is
done. For y^ will is ever fulfilled, either touching us, or of us. Touching us
it is fulfilled, but we fulfill it not when we sin. Of us it is fulfilled when
we do good. Item, so of man also God ever fulfilleth his will, for man does,
whereof God works not, that he will. Item, Gods will is the necessity of all
things.

It is then in the power of the naughty men to sin, Augustine
but y^ in sinning the same naughtiness shall do this or this, it is not in
their power, but in the power of God, who divides darkness and orders it,
that of this also that they do against Gods will, there is nothing fulfilled but
Gods will. Aug. in the 1. bo. of the Predest. of Saints. cha. 16.

Which holy scripture, Augu. in his bo. of freewil and gra. ca. 20
if it be diligently looked into, shows that not only the good wills of men,
which he made of evil wills, and being made good by him, guides to good acts,
but also those wills, y^ continue ye creation of the world, be so in Gods power,
that he makes them to be bowed, whether he will, and when he will, either to
do good to some, or to punish some, as he himself declares by his (most hidden
indeed, but undoubtedly) most just judgment. For we find some sins to be
punishments even of other sins. As in y^ hardening of Pharao, Pharao
ye cause whereof is also declared to show Gods power in him. Wherefore the Lord
says to Joshua, Joshua.
The Children of Israel shall not be able to stand. What is this, they shall
not be able to stand? why did they not stand by their free will, but fled,
their will being troubled through fear, saving that God rules over the wills
of men, and when he is angry, turns whom he will into fear? Did not ye
shameless man that son of Iemini, Simei.
rail upon king David by his own will? Nevertheless, what says David: suffer
him to rail, for y^ Lord has commanded him to rail upon David. Lo, how it
is proved y^ ^od uses ye hearts even of evil men, to y^ praise and aid of
good men.

Who should not tremble (says he) at these judgments of God, In the same boo.
cha. 31.
whereby he works even in y^ hearts of evil men whatsoever he will, rendering
yet to them according to their deserts. And again, by these and such
testimonies of the holy scripture, it is made manifest enough, that God works
in y^ hearts of men, to boow their wills whether soever he will, either to good
things according to his mercy, and to evil according to their deserts,
through his own judgment without doubt, sometimes open, sometimes hidden, but
ever just. Some will babble and say, if all things come to pass according to
Gods ^oresight, providence, and certain, immovable and unchangeable ordiuaunce,
then they will make no provision for meat to satisfy their hunger, they will
use no medicine in their sickness, they will not procure to avoid any danger,
etc. for ye good things y^ God has ordained for them, they shall have, and the
evil y^ God has appointed, they cannot eschew. So that either it shall not
need, or it shall not boot to labor ^or ye obtaining of y^ one, or avoiding
of ye other, since al must be as it is already decreed and determined without
alteration or change

Answer.
O rude rabble, what if God will use your labor, and the wisdom and gifts
wherewith he has furnished you, to serve his providence, will ye refuse to be
his instruments, with all y^ ye have of him? if it be his ordinance to feed you
through your travel, will you lie gaping till meat fall into your mouths from y^
clouds, which you perceive he has not appointed. If it plese him to hele you
by y^ virtue he has given to herbs or other simples, and you will not be
healed, I would ye should be sick still. If he will have you to escape dangers
through y^ wisdom y^ he has planted in your hearts, and you will not use
the^, you are worthy to perish in them, and so God will use your folly to your
own destruction. The godly, ever like that well that pleases God, neither
will they show themselves, so unthankful or so foolish, as to despise or
refuse the means that he has appointed, and though they know that nothing can
come to pass, otherwise then he has ordained, yet they know not whether this
way or y^ way, by this means or that means, he will bring his purpose to
pass, and therefore they use the mean with thanks that seems most lykely,
according to the wisdom that God has given them. For whether God work
things by him, or by those means and instruments, that he has appointed, all
is one to them, and they acknowledge his wisdom and goodness, as well in the
one, as in the other, etc. B. Traheron.

How there is two wills in God.
The will of God is two manner of ways considered in the Scripture. Two wills
in God.
It does ascribe unto God an absolute will, which is hidden from us, and can in
no wise be resisted, for whatsoever God has determined by his absolute will,
it can never be altered. Secondly, Scripture does speak of the divine and
blessed will of God, as it is set forth unto us in Gods holy word, whereby we
do learn, what God will have us to do, and what he will have us to leave
undone: we do all contrary to this will, when we do break his commandment.
And so Adam doing contrary to Gods will, brought himself to naught, and to
utter destruction. I. Veron.

The meaning of this place following.
I will show mercy to whom. Exo. 13. 19
I will show mercy, and will have compassion on whom I have compassion. That
is as much as if he should say, that nothing does move him to mercy, but only
that he will show mercy, that is to say, that the only thing that moves him
to be merciful or to show mercy and compassion, is only his blessed will and
pleasure.

Proves of Gods will out of holy Scripture.
I will harden Pharaos heart, Exo. 7 3.
and multiply miracles and wonders in the land of Egypt.

The Lord has made all things for his own sake, Pro. 16. 4.
yea even the wicked for the day of evil.

I will show mercy, etc. Which is expounded a little before. Exo. 33. 19.

Who has saved us, 2. Tim. 1. 9
and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according
to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us, through Christ before the
world was.

Look. Predestination. Calling. Why.

How we ought in all things to commit our selves to the will of God.
If thou will, thou can make me clean. Mat. 8. 2
In all our troubles and adversities, in diseases and sickness, let us put our
selves wholly unto Gods pleasure and will, which knows best, and will always
do the thing that is expedient for his glory and the salvation of our souls.
Sir. I. Cheek.

WILDERNESS.
What is signified by wilderness.
BUt the desert and wilderness shall rejoice. Esa. 35. 1.
By the desarte and wilderness is signified the country of the heathen, which
were without grace, and without the fruit of good and virtuous living. Psa.
107. 33. It is a borrowed speech, taken of the roughness and unfruitfulness
of the wilderness. T. M.

He prophecieth of the full restoring of the Church, both of the Jews and
Gentiles under Christ, which shall be fully accomplished at the last day: albeit
as yet it is compared to a desert and wilderness. Geneua.

The barraine nature of mankind, shall be made fruitful by grace promised in
Christ. The Bible note.

How the Lord does turn the wilderness into rivers.
I turn the wilderness into rivers. Esa. 41. 17
That is, I make the doctrine of truth so general and so easy to all men,
that whereas were before wast wildernesses (by which understand the errors of
the heathen, wherewith they had made all unfruitful and dry) shall now by the
grace of the Holy ghost, be rivers of the water of verity, where all was full
of Idolatrye, of abomination and of stinking errors, there shall the hearts of
the chosen, be watered with godly wisdom, through the Gospel and glad
tidings, and shall be endued with faith, whereby they may both profit themselves
and other, and so shall they be fruitful. Wilderness is often thus taken, as
before. Esaias. 35. T. M.

The meaning of this place following.
Where shall we get so much bread in ye wilderness. Ma. 15. 33
We are all in a wilderness, so many as be in this vale of misery. Christ is
our Pastor and shepherd, which feeds us with his blessed word, in the
wilderness, that is to say, among so many traditions of wherewith we are
burdened. S. I. Cheek.

WINE.
Of old wine in new vessels.
NEither do we put new wine into old vessels. Mat. 9. 17
A mind that is nourished in blind ceremonies and superstition is not a meet
vessel to receive the pleasant wine of the gospel. S. I. C.

Old wine was wont to be put after the manner of oil, into Goats skins, even
as we do put it into our wine vessels. They therefore that are skillful in
vintage or making of wine, brew their new wine into new vessels, for they which
put new wine into old vessels, suffer double loss, that is to say, when the
new wine works or spourgeth, the vessels break, and the wine perishes.
Marl. fol. 135.

What is signified by wine and oil.
The oil and wine see thou hurt not. Apoc. ^. 6.
The dulcet wine and the fragrant oil, see thou hurt not, says the said
voice, hinder not the word of God, Wine and Oil.
which is the sweet wine y^ replenisheth the heart with gladness, and the
wholesome oil y^ comfort ye soul in trouble, delicious it is in adversity,
and solatious in all weakness. Corrupt not ye text with false gloses, take not
from us the sweetness thereof: defraud us not of y^ fruitful savor, let ye text
be whole, ye fruit vncorrupt, and the judgment right, and that shall well be, if
nothing be added unto it, nor nothing taken from it. Bale.

What is signified by wine and milk.
Come, Esa. 55. 1.
buy wine and milk without any money etc. The word of God is called wine and
milk: wine because it rejoices the heart in that it pacifieth the conscience,
and sets it at rest: milk because it nourishes and increases the little
ones in faith, as ye have. 1. Pet. 2. 2. And as newborn babes desire the
reasonable milk. T. M.

By waters, wine, milk and bread, he means all things necessary to the
spiritual life, as these are necessary to the corporal life. Geneua.

The forbidding of wine and strong drink.
Thou shall not drink wine nor strong drink. ^eu. 10^ 6.
Some think that Nadab and Abiu being overcome with drink did not their
serseruice lawfully, whereupon they think that this law of forbidding wine
and strong drink was made. The Bible note.

How wine remains in the Sacrament.
He took the Cup, M^. 26. 29
and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying: Drink ye all of
it, for this my blood of y^ new Testament, that is shed for many, for the
remission of sins, I say unto you that I will not drink henceforth of this
fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new with you in the
kingdom of my father. Here Christ himself calls it the very fruit and
generation of the grape as it was before.

That it was wine (says Clement Clement.
) that was blessed at y^ supper, Christ himself showed his disciples, saying:
I will no more drink of the fruit of this vine, until I shall drink ^ with
you in the kingdom of my father. Clem. de pedago. li. 2. cap 2.

The wine pressed out of clusters and many ^rapes, Ci^riane.
our Lord called his blood. Cipr. li. 3. Epist 6.

There was wine in the mystery or sacrament of our rec^ption, when our Lord
said: Augustine
I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine. Aug. de eccl. dogmat.
ca. 75. Jewel. fo. 263.

VVINDE.
What the four winds do signify.
^Olding the four winds of the earth. Apoc. 7. 1.
The spirit is compared to wind, and the doctrine also, and though there be one
spirit and one doctrine, yet four are here named, in respect of the
diversity of the four quarters of the earth where the Gospel is spread, and
for the four writers thereof, and the preachers of the same through the whole
earth. Geneua.

They withhold the four winds of the earth, the doctrine of the spirit, which
God has sent to be blown the world over, they withstand, resist, stop, vex
and evermore persecute. Bale.

How the preachers of the Gospel are likened to wind.
That the wind should not blow upon the earth. Apoc^ 7. 1.
Like as the wind raises up clouds, opens the earth, moysteth it, makes it
fruitful, and makes it to look cheerfully with flowers and fruits: even so
the preaching of the Gospel shadoweth y^ hearts of earthly men^ and preserves
them from the wickedness of heresy, and opens them unto repentance, and
makes way through them, that they may receive grace, and makes them to bring
forth the fruit of good works, and beautifieth them with good examples. But
now is this blast of all blasts the pleasantest^ by Satan's subtlety and
naughtiness, forbidden to blow upon the earth. Marl. upon. the Apoc. 105.

The meaning of this place following.
The wind blows where it lists, John. 3. 8.
etc. As y^ power of God is manifest by the moving of the air, so is it in
changing and reviving us, although the matter be hid from us. Geneua.

VVINGS.
How God is said to have wings.
David says: Psa. 17. 8.
Defend me (O Lord) under the shadow of thy wings, likening God unto a bird,
forasmuch as he is no less careful for his chosen, then y^ hen is for her
chickens, as Christ declares very well, crieng: Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often
would I have gathered thy children together, as the hen gathers her chickens
under her wings, and ye would not.

This shadow of his wings here, signifies ye protection and unspeakable
goodness of God, by which only we stand in safety. It is a borrowed speech, of
the nature of an hen, which nourishes, feeds and defends her chickens
under her wings: yea, fights for them, and despises hi^ own life to save
them. Christ borrows a like speech in Mat. 23. 37. T. M.

VVINTER.
The meaning of this place following.
PRay y^ your flight be not in ye winter, Ma. 24. 20
neither on ye Sabbath day. In y^ winter, because it was evil traueling, and
on ye sabbath day, because they were commanded as y^ day they should not go
farther the^ a mile. And in y^ day did Pompeius take the^. Strab. 16. (...) And
so did Titus and Vespasian also, of whom Frontomus writes. T. M.

WISDOM.
How this word wisdom signifies Christ.
I Wisdom was hefore the world of old. Pro. 8. 22.
He declares hereby the divinity and eternity of this wisdom, which he
magnifieth and praises through this book, mening thereby, ye eternal son of
God Jesus Christ our savior, who^ S. John calls y^ word that was in the
beginning. John. 1. 1. Geneua.

When he prepared the Heavens, Pro. 8. 27.
I Wisdom was there. He declares y^ eternity of y^ son of God, which is
meant by this word Wisdom, who was before all time and ever present with the
Father. Geneua.

When he appointed the foundation of the earth, Pro. 8 30.
then was I Wisdom with him as a nourisher. Some read, as a chie^e worker,
signifieng that this wisdom even Jesus Christ was equal with God his father,
and created and preserved, and still works with him, as John. 5. 17. Geneua.

How wisdom is justified of her children.
And wisdom is justified of her children. Mat. 11. 19
S. Luke does add All, and notwithstanding that they do expound this place
sundry ways, yet it is a clear matter, that Christ spoke neither Greek nor
Latin, but Hebrew to the Hebrews, in the holy language and accustomed sense.
Therefore when he said y^ the wisdom of God was justified of all his children,
he meant nothing else, but that he left nothing undone toward his children, that
is to say, the people of the kingdom, which he had trained up as his children,
and in all things y^ might belong to their salvation, and that it was therefore
free and clear from all blame of their destruction and perishing. And so
Chrisostom does also expound it. It were a very unfit thing to expound it: the
wisdom is justified by her children, to say it is from unjust by the benefit
of y^ children changed into just and innocent. By thy words (says y^ Lord)
thou shall be justified, or by thy words condemned: y^ is to say, by thy words
thou shall be declared, either to be just, or condemned of injustice. Words d^e
not make, but declare a man to be just or unjust, etc. Muscul. fol. 223.

This sentence (Wisdom is justified of her children) is sundry ways
expounded. Some by those children do understand the elect and chosen, because
y^ they have embraced the wisdom of God, in John, ^ in Christ, justifying, y^
is to say, allowing and praising it. Chrisostom by the children does generally
understand all me^, whether they be elect or reproved, for by the^ ye wisdom of
g^d is justified, y^ is to say, by their own confession she has oue^^o^med in
judgment, and has omitted nothing y^ pertain to their salvation, so y^ their
perdition cannot be laid to their charge. S. I. C.

They that were wise indeed, acknowledged the wisdom of God in him, whom y^
Phari^ies contemn. But y^ Publicans being baptized with the Baptime of John,
praised him as just, faithful, good and m^rcifull, so that the fruit of their
Baptime, appeared in them.

And wisdom is justified of her children. Luk 7. 39.
That is, the children of wisdom, or the wise which believe the Gospel, do
acknowledge the wisdom of God therein, which the Pharisees condemn, so that
wisdom is then iustifi^d of her children, when the Gospel is received. The
By. note.

WISE MEN.
What these wise men were.
THere came wise men from the East. Mat. 2. 1
These were neither Kings nor Princes, but as Strabo says (which was in their
time) sage men among the Persians, as Moses was among y^ Hebrews. He says
also, y^ they were y^ Priests of y^ Persians. Tinda.

Wise men or Magi in y^ Persians and Chaldeans tongue, signify Philosophers,
Priests and Astronomers, and are here ye first fruits of the Gentiles, that
came to worship Christ. Geneua.

WITH THE HOLY. etc.
The meaning of the Prophet in this place.
Look. Holy.

WITNESS.
How these places following are to be understood.
ANd ye shall bear witness also. Io^. 15. 27
Whereas in the 5. Chapter of John, Christ says that he receives no witness of
man, it is to be understood, that for his own part be needed none^ but for our
cause it was expedient y^ his disciples should testify his truth unto us, and
therefore says he, ye shall bear witness of me also. Ti.

But I have greater witnesses then y^ witness of John. I^h. 5. 36.
Let us note here, how circumspectly and wisely he says not, I have a
testimony much more certain and true, then y^ testimony of John: les^ he might
so ex^ol y^ testimony of his father concerning himself, y^ the testimony of
John thereby should be quite discredited: for whatsoever John did testify
concerning Christ, y^ same was of God, neither was it any whit contrary from y^
which y^ father by his works tes^fied of him. But if ye compare y^ testimony
of the works of Christ which he had received of y^ father with the testimony of
John, ye shall find y^ it is much more excellent and notable. For as Lucifer
or y^ morning star, though it be a true testimony of y^ rising of y^ sun, yet
notwithstanding is (...), and nothing so ^^ide^t as y^ sun beams it self, which
shine throughout y^ whole world. Eue^ so John, though his testim^ny were true
concerning Christ, yet notwtstanding it was far inferior and more obscure then
the bright show of Christ's works. Mar. fol. 176.

Though I bear record of my self, Ioh. 8. 14.
yet my record is true. The sense and meaning is this: Although every man is
suspected in his own cause, and although it be provided by laws that no man
speaking in his own cause should be credited, yet notwithstanding this can take
no place in the son of God, which is above the whole world, for he is not to be
reckoned in the order of men, but has this privilege from his father, to
govern all men with his word alone. Mar. fol. 293.

That which Christ denies. chap. 5. 37. here he grants to declare unto
them their stubburnes: and says, that being God he bears witness to his
humanity, likewise does God the father witness the same, where are two distinct
persons, though but one God. Geneua.

At the mouth of two witnesses, Ioh. 8. 17.
etc. Not that the testimony of two witnesses are always true, but because it
is to be counted true. For otherwise the testimony of men may be false: as it
is to be seen in the 3. of Kings. chapter. 21. 13. Math. 26. 6. Susanna. 13.

VVOE.
What woe is.
THis word (Woe) as Basil says, is a lamentable moan, wherewith all they y^
groan under the cross does utter their grief.

What is betokened by the 3. woes in the revelation of John.
One woe is past, Apo. 9. 12.
and behold two woes come yet hereafter. The first woe betokens the
mischief that is brought into the world by the false prechers and Cloister
men, which advanced Antichrist unto so great authority, y^ he began to be
esteemed for a God and Savior, when notwithstanding he was but a destroier and
rooter out, and lo (says the text) there came yet two woes after this, y^ is
to wit, in ye opening of the trumpets of the sixth and seventh Angels. For the
second woe is meant of the time wherein Antichrist reigns with most cruel
persecutions against the godly through the whole world. And the third is about
y^ end and destruction of Antichrist, whom the Lord shall dispatch with the
breath of his mouth, and rid quite away through the brightness of his coming
2. The. 2. 8. Mar. fol. 135.

VVOOD.
What it is to build on wood, hay, or stubble.
IF any do build on this foundation, wood, hay, or stubble. That is, 1. Cor.
3. 12
if a man of good intent (but yet through ignorance) preach and teach you to
stick unto ceremonies, and men's traditions (although they seem never so
glorious) and to such things as are not grounded on scriptures (as S. Cyprian
taught and defended to rebaptise him that was once baptized, and after fallen
into heresy, yea, and many Bishops consented unto him, yet was it surely a
great error). This is wood, hay, and stubble, that cannot endure the fire of
temptation, and light of Gods word, etc. I. Frith. fol. 43.

WOLF.
How a Wolf is sometime taken in a good sense.
Benjamin is a rauishing Wolf. ^e. 49. 27.
Wolf is here taken in ^ a good sense, and signifies a fervent preacher of
Gods word, as was Paul, in whom the text is verefied. T. M.

The meaning of these places following.
The Wolf and the Lamb shall feed together. Esa. 65. ^5
The meaning is, that the most wicked and cruel men, shall at ye coming of
Christ, agree with the good and peaceable, and that the Gentiles, (which for
their beastly living are often signified under ye name of beasts) shall be at
unity with the faithful, and the one live joyfully with the other without
strife. The very self saying have ye in the 11. Chap. ver. 6. T. M.

The Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb. Esa. 11. 6.
Men because of their wicked affections, are named by the name of beasts,
wherein the like affections reign: but Christ by his spirit shall reform
them, and work in them such mutual charity, that they shall be like Lambs,
favoring and loving one another, and cast off all their cruel affections.
Geneua.

WOMAN.
Of the woman arrayed in Purple.
ANd the woman araied in Purple, etc. Apo. 17. 14
This woman is Antichrist, that is the Pope, with the whole body of his
filthy^ creatures, as is expounded ver. ^8. whose beauty only stands in
outward pomp, and impudency, and craft like a strumpet. Geneua.

The woman's variable garments be tokeneth diverse liueryes of religious orders,
or the Rose color may signify a readiness to shed christen blood. The cup
^ull of abominations, etc. the Popes decrees, decrefalls, Bulls,
dispensations, suspensations, and cursings. The beast she sat on, is the Papal
seat. Sir. I. Cheek.

Of women's apparel.
The Prophet Esaias reckons up their bracelets, Esaias. 3. 19
their tablets, their bonets, their nosegaies, jewels, their vailes, their
wimples, etc. In rehearsing all these things perticularly, he shows the
lightness and vanity of such as cannot be content with comelye apparel
according to their degree. Geneua.

Tertulian Tertulian
in his book of the ^ttire of women, setting forth a better new apparel of
women, says thus: Prodite vos feminae, etc. Come ye forth ye women having your
beauties bettered with the helps and ornaments of the Apostles, taking white
lives of simplicity, and readynesse of shamefastness, having your eyes
painted with shamefastness, and your spirits with secrecy, putting into your
ears the word of God, tieng to your necks the yoke of Christ, put under your
necks to your husbands, and ye shall be well apparelled. Have always what to
do in your hands, and fasten your feet at home, and ye shall be better lyked
of them, and if ye were in gold: Clad you with ye silk of sincerity, with ye
saten of sanctity, with the purple of probitie. Thus prune and prick up your
selves, and God himself shall be your paramour, etc.

How women may not wear man's apparel.
The woman shall not wear that which pertains to man, Deu. 22. ^.
etc. It is not forbidden, but that to eschew or avoid ieopardy, or to pass
the time merely, or to beguile our enemies, a woman may wear a man's harness
or vestiments, and contrariwise a man woman's clothes: but that they be not
earnestly and customably used, that due honor and dignity may be observed of
both kinds, seeing to do contrariwise is uncomely. T. M.

Of the woman taken in adultery.
Neither do I condemn thee, John. 8. 11.
go and sin no more. He says not, neither shall any man condemn thee,
because he would not abrogate the office of y^ lawful judge. Therefore they
which gather hereby y^ adultery is not to be punished by death, by the same it
is necessary that they grant y^ an inheritance ought not to be divided,
because Christ would not make himself an arbitrer or vmper in that business
between two brethren: yea, let every wickedness be exempted from the
punishment of the law, if so be adulterers may escape unpunished, they open
the gate to treason, to murder, to rapine and theft. If the magistrate had
lawfully condemned adulterye, Christ would not have absolved the same. He
absolved her from sin, if she repented, but he took not away the punishment
and public example. Even as also he receives the penitent and faithful
thief, into the favor and grace of God, but yet did not deliver him from the
punishment which he had deserved for theft. Marl. fo. 288.

Go and sin no more. This is the penance that Christ does enjoin to all
sinners: that is to say, that they sin no more. In the mean season we must
mark that if this woman had been condemned by the law, he would not have
quited her from temporal punishment^ for he was not come to break the law.
Sir. I. Cheek.

Of a woman taken in war.
And see among the captives a beautiful woman, D^u. 21. 12
and have a fancy to her, that thou would have her to wife. Heer^ were they
permitted to take a wife of the Gentiles, but first to shave her head, and cut
her nails, etc. which ceremony signified, that she should be instruct to cut
away the wantonness and superfluous decking with the delicate conditions of
the Gentiles, least the clean people of the Jews should in short space
abhor her, if she continued in her old manners. T. M.

How women are called Ministers.
Look Phebe.

How women ought not to baptize.
But how the custom was before that Augustine was borne, first is gathered of
Tertulian, that it is not permitted to a woman to speak in the Church, not to
teach, nor to baptize, nor to offer, that she should not claim to her self
the execusion of any man's office, much less of the Pry(...)s. Of the same
thing Epiphanius is a substantia^ witness, Lib. cont. hera^s. 1.
where he reproves Martion, that he gave women liberty to baptize, neither am
I ignorant of their answer which think otherwise, that is, that common use
much differs from extraordinarye remedy, when extreme necessity en^oreeth.
But when he p^onouncing that it is mockery to give women liberty to baptize,
excepteth nothing. It sufficiently appears that he condemns this corruption
So that it is by no color excusable. Also in the third book, where teaching
that it was not permitted even to the holy mother of Christ, he adds no
restraint. Calvin.

What the woman clothed in the Sun signifies.
A woman clothed with the Sun. In this third vision is declared, how the
Church which is compassed about with Jesus Christ the son of righteousness
is persecuted of Antichrist. Geneua.

Why women are commanded to keep silence in the Church.
Saint Paul both in the Epistle to Timothy, ^. Tim. 2. 11.
and in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, ^. Cor. 14. 3^
commands that a woman should keep silence in the Church. And he assigns
causes of ^his silence so commanded, namelye because they ought to be subject
unto their husbands, but the office of a teacher has a certain authority
over those which are taught, which is not to be attributed unto women over men,
for she was made for the man, whom she ought always to have a regard to
obey, which thing is also appointed her by the sentence of God, whereby after
sin committed he said unto the woman, Thy lust shall perteine unto thy
husband. Farther the Apostle gives another reason, drawn from the first
front, because he says: Eve was seduced and not Adam, wherefore if women should
ordinarily be admitted unto the holy mystery of the Church, men might easily
suspect that the Devil by his accustomed instrument would deceive the people,
and for that cause they would the less regard the ecclesiastical function, if
women should be believed. It ought therefore to be committed only unto men, and
that by ordinary right, and the Apostles rule, etc. Pet. Mar. upon Iudic. fo.
93.

Let your women keep silence in the Churches. ^. Cor. 14. 34.
Because this disorder was in the Church, that women usurped y^, which was
peculiar to men. The Apostle here shows, what is meet to be done, and what
is not. And albeit he mentioned this abuse before, yet he reserueth it to this
place to be reproved, because there he brought it in for an other purpose. Genesis
3. 16. Geneua.

What is meant by the foolish woman.
A foolish woman is troublesome. ^ro. 9. 13.
By the foolish woman Foolish woman.
some understand the wicked Preachers, who counterfeite the word of God, as
appears, verse. 16. where he says: Who so is simple let him come hither, and
to him that is destitute of wisdom he says: Which are the words of the true
preachers, ver. 4. but their doctrine is but as stolen water, meaning that they
are but men's traditions, which are more pleasant to the flesh then the word of
God, and therefore they themselves boast thereof. Geneua.

What is meant by the strange woman.
And it shall deliver thee from the strange woman, etc. Pro. 2. 16
Meaning that wisdom which is the word of God, shall preserve us from al
vices, naming this vice of whooredome, whereunto man is most pro^e. Geneua.

The meaning of this place following.
A woman shall compass a man. Ie^^. 31. 22
This do they commonly expound of the redemption of Israel, by the similitude
of a woman searching her husband: as though the Prophet aadde said, The people
of Israel, after they have of long time forsaken their spouse God, shall yet at
the last return and embrace him with the arms of faith, charity and
obedience. Some expound it of the virgin Mary, and some of the Church the
spouse of Christ. T. M.

Because their deliverance from Babylon was a figure of their deliverance from
sin, he shows how this should be procured, to wit, by Jesus Christ, whom
a woman should conceive and bear in her womb, which is a strange thing in
earth, because he should be borne of a woman without man: or (...) means that
Hierus^l^m which was like a barren woman in her captivity should be fruitful,
as she that is joined in marriage, and whom God blesses with children. Geneua.

WORD OF GOD.
What the word of God is.
THE word of God does signify the virtue and power of God. It is also put for
the son of God, which is the second person in the most reverent Trinity, for
the saying of the holy Evangelist is evident to all men. The word was made
flesh. Bullinger. fol. 2.

How the word was made flesh.
And the word was made flesh, etc. John. 1. 14
That is to say, the everlasting word, which is the only begotten son of God,
did take our frail nature and flesh upon him, in the which (being equal with
the father touching his Godhead) he was made a curse for us, that is to say, he
did take upon him that malediction and curse that was due unto us, for the
breaking of the law of God. Sir. I. Cheek.

He was formed and made man by the operation of the holy Ghost, without the
operation of man. Geneua.

That is, the word, the second person of the Godhead Jesus Christ came down
and was made flesh, that is to wit, received the nature of man wholly and
perfectly both body and soul, uniting the same to the person of his Godhead.
S. John says not: Caro verbum facta est, as the Arrians expound it and say,
the flesh received the word, but he says: Verbum caro factum est. The word
was made flesh. I. Proctour.

In that he says the word became flesh and not man, he shows how far Gods
son humbled and abased himself. For the Scripture calls man flesh, when he
will signify the poverty, vileness, and misery of man. As when it is said,
All flesh is grass, and he remembered that we were but flesh, and my spirit
shall not ever strive in man, for he is flesh. But when y^ Evangelist says,
The word became flesh, we may not imagine that Gods son joined to his divine
nature flesh only and not man's soul, as Appolinaris thought in his trance,
that flesh and the Godhead made one person without man's soul. For he imagined
that the divinity was in steed of a soul. But so it should follow that the
Lord Jesus was not a very man. For flesh is not a man. For the soul is the
formal part of a man, namely, that whereby a man is a man, and without which a
man cannot be. And that the Lord had a man's soul beside his divinity, he
himself testifies where he says, My soul is heavy unto y^ death. Neither
can Appol(...) is aid himself with this place. For when the Scripture calls
men flesh, it means not that they are without soul, for then they were no
men indeed. Trahe^on.

What the Evangelist means by the word in this place of John.
In the beginning was the word, John. 1. 1.
etc. By the word, the Evangelist means the second person in the holy
Trinity, namely our Lord Jesus Christ touching his divine nature, as it
appears afterward, when he says, And the word became flesh. word taken 2.
ways.
Here we must consider why Gods son is called a word. Ancient writers
consider a word two ways. For they teach that there is an outward word, and
an inward word. The outward word is that foundeth and passes away. The
inward word is, How Christ is the fathers word.
the conceit of the heart, which remains still in the heart, when the sound
is past. So they say that God has an outward word, which is sounded,
pronounced and written in books: And that he has an inward word, which
remains within himself, whereof the outward word is an Image, effect and
fruit. This inward word ever remaining in him is called his son, as the
conceit of the heart may be called the ingendered fruit of the heart, and
the hearts child. They think also that he is called the word of God,
because that as a word is the Image of man's mind, and represents it unto
us, so the Lord Jesus is Gods Image, and most lively represents unto us, his
power, his Godhead, and his wisdom. For whatsoeeuer is in the Father, shines
in the Son. Some other think that the word here, Word, for ^ thing.
is taken for a thing, after the Hebrew manner of speaking. For the Hebrews
use (Dabar) which signifies a word for a thing. When Esaias the Prophet asked
king Ezechias, what the Babylonians had seen in his house, he answers thus:
They saw all that was in my house, Iohaial dabar, there was not a word, that
is to say, any one thing that I showed not unto them in my treasures. The
Prophet replyeth, Behold the days come, that whatsoever is in thine house
shall be taken away, and whatsoever thy father have laid up in store unto this
day, shall be carried to Babylon, Ioij vather dabar, there shall not a word
remain says the Lord, that is to say, there shall not one thing be left
behind. The Angel also in S. Luke, when the virgin Mary meruailed how she
should coceiue a child without man's help, said unto her: No word shall be
impossible unto God, y^ is, nothing shall be impossible for him to do. So that
after this understanding, S. John's mening is, that in the beginning there was a
divine and heavenly thing with God. Traheron.

How the word of God is called the light.
Thy word (says David) is a lantern unto my feet. Psa. 119. 105 Again, Theo.
in Luke ca. 16
the commandments of the Lord is lightsome, giving light to the eyes. Psalm.
19. 7. Theophilact says: Verbum Dei est lucerna, etc. The word of God is the
candle whereby the thief (or false preacher) is espied.

How the word of God endures for ever.
S. Hierome says: Hiero. in Ioh. ca. 27
Quomodo eternae erunt Scripturae diuin^, etc. How shall the holy Scriptures be
everlasting, seeing the world shall have an end? True it is that the parchment
or leaves of the books with the letters and all shall be abolished, but
for so much as the Lord adds, My words shall never pass, doubtless (though the
papers and letters perish, yet) the thing that is promised by the same letters,
shall last for ever.

Of the nature and strength of the word of God.
For the word of God is lively and mighty in operation, Heb. 4. 12^
and sharper then any two edged swoorde, and enters through even to the
dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit, and of the joints and of the
marrowe, and is a discouerer of the thoughts and the intent of the heart,
neither is there any creature which is not manifest in his sight, but all
things are naked and open unto his eyes, with whom we have to do.

Surely as the rain comes down, and the Snow from heaven, and returns not
thither, but waters the earth, and makes it to bring forth and bud, that it
may give seed to the sower, and bread to him that eats, so shall my word be,
that goes out of my mouth, it shall not return unto me in vain, but it shall
accomplish that which I will, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent
it.

How the word of God has sundry names.
The word of God according to the sundry effects and propertyes thereof, has
sundry names, as thus: It is called seed, for that it increases and
multiplyeth: It is called a sword, for that it cutteth the heart, and divides
the flesh from the spirit: It is called a net, for that it takes us and
encloseth us together: It is called water, for that it washes us clean: it is
called fire, for that it inflameth us: It is called bread, for that it feeds
us. Even so it is called a key, for that it gives us an entrye into the house:
The house is the kingdom of heaven, Christ is the door, the word of God is
the keye. Jewel. fo. 144.

How the word of God is the key.
Look. Key.

How the word of God is plain.
They are all plain unto him that will understand. Pro. 8. 9.
Meaning that the word of God is easy to all that have a desire unto it, and
which are not blinded by the Prince of this world. Geneua.

The more that Gods word is trodden down, the more it grows.
The Pharesies said thus of Christ: John. 13. 19
Videtis nos nihil proficere, etc. Ye see we can do no good, lo, the whole
world (for all that we can do) is gone after him.

Tertulian Tertulian
says, The greatest cruelty that ye can devise, is an entisement to our sect:
how many of us so eu^r ye murder, when ye come to the view ye find us more and
more. The seeds of this increase is christian blood. For what man (says he)
beholding the paineful torments and the perfect patience of them, will not
search and inquire what is the cause? And when he has found it out, who will
not agree unto it, who will not desire to suffer for it? Thus (says he) this
sect will never dye, which the more it is cut down, the more it grows. For
every man seeing and wondering at the sufferance of the Saint, is moved the
more thereby to search the cause, in scarching he finds it, and in finding he
follows it.

says, they were scattered, they were imprisoned, they were beaten, they were
ract, they were burnt, and yet they multiplied. Aug. de ciuit. li. 12. cap. 6.

How the word and flesh be not both of one nature.
If the word and flesh Word and flesh.
were both of one nature, seeing that the word is every where, why is not the
flesh then every where, for when it was in earth, then verily it was not in
heaven, and now when it is in heaven, it is not surely in earth. And it is so
sure that it is not in earth, that as concerning it we look for him to come
from heaven. When as concerning his eternal word: we believe to be with us in
earth. Therefore by your doctrine (says Vigelius unto Eutiches, who defended
that the divinity and humanity in Christ was but one nature) either the word
is contained in a place with his flesh, or else the flesh is every where with
his word. For one nature cannot receive in it self two natures, 2. Nature in
Christ.
and contrary things. But these two things be diverse and far unlike, that is
to say to be contained in a place, and to be every where. Therefore insomuch as
the word is every where, and the flesh is not every where, it appears
plainly, that one Christ himself has in him two natures, and that by his
divine nature he is every where, and by his humanity he is contained in a
place, that he is created and has no beginning, that he is subject to death
and cannot dye. Whereof one he has by the nature of his word (whereby he is
God) and the other he has by the nature of his flesh, whereby the same God is
made man also. Therefore one son of God, the self same was made the son of
man, and he has a beginning by the nature of his flesh, and no beginning by
the nature of his Godhead. He is comprehended in a place, by the nature of his
flesh, and not comprehended by the nature of his Godhead. He is inferior to
Angels in the nature of his flesh, and is equal to his Father in the nature
of his Godhead: He died by the nature of his flesh, and died not by the nature
of his Godhead: This is the faith and catholic confession, which the Apostles
taught, the martirs did co^oborate, and faithful people keep unto this day.
Cranmer. fol. 113.

How the word of God ought not only to be read to the people, but also to be
expounded unto them.
Esdras the Priest brought the law the book of Moses, 2. Esd. 8. ^.
and stood upon a Turret of wood, that is in the holy Pulpet. And Esdras opened
ye. book before the congregation of men and women, and whosoever else had any
understanding. And the Levites stood with him, so that he read out of the
book, and the Levites instructed the people in the law, and the people stood
in their place, and they read in the book of the law distinctly, expounding
the sense, and causing them to understand the reading. Here it appears that
the lawful and holy ministers of the church of God, Luke. 4. 17
did not only read the word of God, but also expound it. And this our Savior
Christ practiced himself when he entered into the Sinagogue at Nazareth, and
expounded a certain place out of the. 61. Chapter of Esaias. And also after his
rising from death, he appeared to the two Disciples which went to Emaus,
expounding to them whatsoever was written of him in the Scriptures, which
example (in expounding the word of God) all the Apostles followed, etc.
Bullinger. fo. 24.

WORKS.
How the deeds and works of the law justify not.
BY the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified. Romans 1. 20
God in his law does not only require of us outward righteousness, but also
an inward perfection, that is to say, we are not only bound to fulfill the
works of the law outwardly in our livings, but also inwardly in our hearts, to
be most sincere, to love entirely above all things, and our neighbor as our
self. But our nature is so corrupted that no man living is able to do the
same, wherefore no man can be justified by the works of the law. Sir. I.
Cheek.

He means the law either written or unwritten, which commands or
forbids any thing, whose works cannot justify, because we cannot perform
them. Geneua.

He includes here ye whole law, both the ceremonial and mor^all, whose works
cannot justify, because they be imperfect in all men. The Bible note.

No man is justified by the deeds of the law, Gal. 2. 25
but by y^ faith of Jesus Christ. This S. Paul proves by the words of the
Prophet Abacucke. 2. 4. A righteous man lives by faith. If he live by any part
of works, then lives he not by faith, but partly by works, and then were
Saint Paul's probation imperfect, which cannot be. With this agrees
Athanasius, proving that faith alonely has the virtue in him to justify
before God. Before man peradventure they may (says he) be reckoned righteous
that stick to the law, but not before God. D. Barnes.

Good works make not men righteous, but follows him that believes, and is
already become righteous in Christ. Like as good fruit makes not a tree to be
good, but a tree is known to be good by the good fruit of it. Beza.

Ye see then how that of deeds a man is justified, Iame. 2. 2^
and not of faith only. When we read in S. Paul that we are justified
through faith without the works of the law, it is to be understood, that
through faith whereby we take hold of the mercy of God, so plentifully
declared unto us in our Savior Jesus Christ, we are without any demerites or
deseruings of ours, counted just and righteous before God, so that our sins
shall be no more imputed unto us. Here in Saint James to be justified, is to
be declared righteous before men, and that by good works, which are infallible
witnesses of the true justifying faith, and therefore he says: Show me thy
faith by thy deeds. Again, he brings the example of Abraham, of whom it is
written (30. years before he offered his son Isaac) Abraham believed, and it
was reckoned unto him for righteousness. Genesis 15. 6. whereby we do evidently
see, that Saint James meaning is, that Abraham's faith was no idle faith, but
such faith as made him obedient to God, which thing he did well declare, when
he did so willingly offer his son at Gods commandment. All that S. James
goes about then, is to prove, that faith cannot be without good works. And as
by faith only we are justified before God, so by good works proceeding from a
lively faith, we are justified before men.

Here we learn also, that where no good works be, there is no true
justifying faith, but a light unprofitable believe, such as is in devils: and
yet we must beware, that we ascribe no part of our justification before God,
unto our good works. Sir. I. Cheek.

There can be no good work reckoned to be in any man, John. 5. 29
but in him alone whose sins God has forgiven: Forasmuch as our best deeds
are lame and corrupt. Therefore they are here called the doers of good works,
whom Paul calls zealous and lovers of good works: Ti^. 2. 14.
But this estimation and judgment depends upon ye fatherly clemency and
acceptance of our God, who allows that freely for good, which deserves to
be rejected as evil and imperfect, etc. Marl. fol. 170.

Indeed works do justify, taking justify to be, to declare just: Even as
white hairs do make a man old, because they be a sign of age. But works do
this before men, and not before God. Nor they cannot take hold of forgiveness
of sins and deliverance from their deserved condemnation. For then it should be
false that ye Apostle says, we be justified freely by his grace, for to him
that works, the reward is imputed unto him for a duty, and not upon grace
and favor. Wherefore the errors of those men is too gross to deceive any of
them which has looked over the holy Scriptures never so slightly. Nor it does
not agree with the sense neither, when they will have justify, to be as much
as to make just. For works do not go before him, that is to be justified,
^but do follow him which is already justified, witness Augustine, and
works do come of grace, and not grace of works, witness the same Augustine.
de fide and opere. cap. 14. Musculus. fol. 227.

Of works done before faith.
Saint Austen condemns all our good works before faith, as vain and nothing
worth. Read him In probo. Psalm. 31.

That works not, how it is understood.
To him that works not, Romans 4. 5.
but believes. That depends not on his works, neither thinks to merit by
them. Gene.

That is, which means not to obtain salvation, through the worthiness of
his works. The Bible note.

How works are not the causes of felicity.
Works indeed are to be had, but not as causes, wherefore Christ admonished us,
saying: When ye have done al these things, say: we are unprofitable servants,
we have done but ye thing which we ought to do. Neither pass we any thing
upon their caueling, which say, y^ therefore we are unprofitable servants,
because our good works being no commodity unto God: forasmuch as God needs
none of our good works, but say they, it cannot be denied but y^ we are by good
works profitable unto our selves. We grant indeed, that it is profitable unto
us to live well. But that utility is not to be attributed unto our works,
that they should be the causes of our blessedness to come. We have nothing in
us whereby we can make God obstruct or bound unto us. For whatsoever we do,
the same do we wholly owe unto God, and a great deal more then we are able to
perform. Wherefore as Christ admonishes: The Lord gives not thanks unto his
servant, when he has done his duty. And if the servant by well doing cannot
bind his Lord to give him thanks, how shall he bind him to render unto him
great rewards. Pet. Mar. upon the Romans fol. 29.

Of works, love, and faith.
Works are the outward righteousness before the world, and may be called the
righteousness of the members, and spring of inward love. Love is the
righteousness of the heart, and springs of faith. Faith is the trust in
Christ's blood, and is the gift of God. Ephe. 2. 8. Tindale.

How our good works, are the works of God.
Although it be written that God will render to every man according to his
works, yet is y^ so to be understood, y^ if they be good works, they are for
none other cause caled any ma^s works, but for that they are wrought in him,
namely by the power of the spirit of God, whereby they are in very deed the
works of God. S. Austen most truly says, that God crowns in us his own
gifts, for as touching us, we deserve nothing but death. Pet. Mar. upon the
Romans fol. 367.

How we deserve nothing by our good works.
Woe be to all our justice (says S. Austen) if it be judged setting mercy a
part. Therefore this is a christen sentence, worthy to be beaten in all men's
heads: Let not thy left hand know what ye right hand does. Let our right hand
work those things which be good and pleasant unto God. And in the mean season
let our hearts depend upon the grace of Gods goodness only, and not thy left
hand write into thy calendar those things which be somewhat well done by the
right hand. Let the note of our own good works be in Gods hand, and not in our
own. Whatsoever he does reward us, either in this life either in the life to
come, let us thank his grace for it, and not our deserts. Musculus. fol. 234.

Of the unableness of our works.
If the seeking of righteousness and forgiveness of sins by the keeping of
the law, which God gave upon mount Sinai with so great glory and majesty, by
the denyeng of Christ and of his grace: what shall we say to those y^ will
needs justify themselves before God by their own laws and obseruances: I would
wish that such folks should a little compare the one with the other, and
afterward give judgment themselves. God minded not to do that honor, nor to
give that glory unto his own law, and yet they will have him to give it to
men's laws and ordinances. But that honor is given only, to his only begotten
son, who alone by the sacrifice of his death and passion, has made full amends
for all our sins past, present, and to come, as says S. Paul. Heb. 7. 25.

The meaning of this place following.
Work out your own salvation with fere and trembling. Phi. 2. 12.
S. Paul says we must work out our salvation with fear and trembling. But
this fear rises in consideration of our weakness and unworthiness, not of
any distrust or doubt in Gods mercy, but rather the less cause we have to
trust in our selves, the more cause we have to trust in God. Jewel. fol. 76.

Look. Salvation.

Of the works of darkness, and of the spirit.
For ye were sometimes darkness. Ephe. 5. 8.
They are called darkness, that walk yet in the night of incredulity and
misbeleefe, doing the works of darkness, which are whooredome, adultery,
wantonness, etc. but they are contrariwise called the children of light, that
bring forth the fruits of the spirit. Gal. 5. 21.

How they know not God that denies him in deeds.
They confess they know God: Tit. 1. 16
but with works they deny him. As infidelity is the headspring of all
wickedness and vice, so on the contrary side, faith is the original well and
fountain of all virtue and godliness. Which faith is declared, not only by
works, but by such deeds and works, as God has commanded us in his holy and
sacred Scriptures. And where no such works be, speak they never so godly, there
is no true lively faith. Sir. I. Cheek.

WORLD.
What the world signifies in this place.
ANd the world knew him not^ The world in this place signifies all men: John.
1. 10
for it cannot be taken in a straighter sense. In the sentence going before,
the world was made by him. In other places of Scripture, the world signifies
y^ reprobate only. Here the world is condemned of unthankfulness and
unkindness, that it has not embraced but shamefully refused and rejected his
maker. It is unnatural, it is horrible and abominable that men should not
acknowledge him by whom they have even this, that they be men. Trah.

Why Paul does call this world present and evil.
To deliver us from this present and evil world. Gal. 1. 4
He calls this whole world, which has been, is, and shall be, the present
world, to put a difference betwixt this, and that everlasting world which is to
come. Moreover he calls it an evil world, because that whatsoever is in this
world, is subject to the malice of the Devil, reigning over the whole world^
For this cause the world is said to be the kingdom of the Devil, for there is
nothing else in this world but ignorance, contempt, blasphemy, and hatred of
God. Also disobedience against all the words and works of God. In, and under
the kingdom of this world are we, etc. Luther upon the Gal. fol. 20.

Of the disputers of this world.
Where is the disputer of this world. 1. Cor. 1. 20.
He that is so subtle in discussing of questions, and herein Paul reprocheth
even the best learned, Disputer.

Christ revealed in the Gospel. Geneua.

The meaning of this place following.
We have received, not the spirit of the world. 1. Cor. 2. 12
We are not moved with that spirit which techeth things wherewith the world is
delighted, and which men understand by nature^ Ge.

WORM.
How Christ compares himself to a worm.
EGo sum vermis and non homo. Psalm. 22. 6.
I am a worm and no man. The scorn of men, and the outcast of the people. How
truly and how justly Christ might say, I am a worm and no man, every man
knows that has read either the. 26. of Matthew, or the. 14. of S. Mark, how
the Jews did spit in his face, and did buffet him with fists, and so vilely
entreated him, as no man could be worse: and therefore it is very properly said
of the Prophet^ I am a worm and no man. A worm is a vile thing, in danger of
treading on, and killing with every man's foot. No man regards it, no man
loves it nor pittieth it, though he be a right good man. To express therefore
lively and properly the vile reputation of Christ at the time of his passion,
Aug. de expo. simbo. ser. 1.
it is very aptly said. Ego sum vermis and non homo, etc. Beside this, Saint
Austen supposes him to be called Vermis, for an higher consideration. Why is
Christ called Vermis, says he. Because (he answers) he was mortal, he was
borne of the flesh, and begotten without the companieng together of man and
woman in the act of generation. And therefore he says thus: Sicut vermis
calefaciente sole de puro limo formatur, sic spiritu sancto, etc. As the worm
is ingendered of the pure and only slime or mudde, being made hot with the
warm Sun: Even so the holy Ghost illustrating and halowing the heart of the
virgin: She was conceived with child, without any humane act of ingendering
wrought therein: In consideration whereof, Christ comparing himself to a
worm, says by David: I am a worm and no man, that is, I am not conceived
after the manner and fashion of man. Thus far Saint Austen. Ric. Turnar.

VVORMEVVOOD.
How false teachers and heretics, be compared to wormwood.
THe name of the star was called wormwood. Apoc. 8. 11
Wormwood is an herb, fair enough unto the eye^ but very bitter to the
taste: Even so be heretics, and as many as favor Antichrist, the more they
seem to excel in holiness, the more do they annoy. Marl.

The nature of wormwood is to withdraw all sweetness. These (meaning
pernicious heretics) with their bitter heresies and their noisome doctrine
destroyed y^ pits of Abraham, they troubled the text, they mixed the truth with
falshoode, they poisoned the waters, they took away the louesomnes of them,
they left them vnpure and imperfect (not that they can be so of themselves but
of their false working) they made them unpleasant, unprofitable, yea, and most
perilous unto many, etc. Bale.

The third plague came upon the stars of heaven, that is, upon the most
holiest people, which were taken for the spiritual state and order, as Monks,
Friars and Priests: which through their hypocrisy have heaped unto themselves,
money, goods, and treasures, and have gotten lands and dominions, for the which
great division was among them. And whereas the world should have learned of
them, faith, love and knowledge, it was nothing but slaundered, offended,
deceived, seduced and sore hindered by them, both in faith and in godly living
and behavior: both which were utterly decayed in these persons, to the great
undoing and destruction both of body and soul. And thus the sweet honnye of
Christian love and concord among these Orders, is turned into bitter wormwood,
by the which many souls are destroyed. Erasmus in his Paraphrase.

WORSHIP.
What is meant by worshipping.
BY worshipping, whether it was in the old Testament or new, understand the
bowing of a man's self upon y^ ground, as we oftentimes, as we kneel in our
prayers, boow our selves, and lie on our arms and hands with our faces to the
ground. Tindale. fol. 11.

Whereas the Latin word of worshipping, is of that nature that it signifies
both to serve and observe and honor, it is aptly referred to God: so that all
that service, observation, reverence and devotion, whereby we do worship God
as well inwardly in our hearts as outwardly in deed, is called the worship of
God. Muscul. fol. 351.

To worship God is the first precept, even to believe him to be our God, and to
have no strange Gods in his sight, that is, to hear the Gospel, to believe it
with heart, to confess God with mouth: which worship Paul lays it as the
foundation of all righteousness and salvation, saying: Nigh is ye word unto
thee, even in thy mouth and heart: and this is the word of faith which we
preach. For faith in our hearts justifies, and the confession with our mouth
brings salvation, etc. Melancthon upon Dan.

How God only is to be worshipped.
Thou shall worship the Lord thy God, Mat. 4. 10
and him only shall thou serve (says our Savior Jesus Christ). Whereupon it
may be argued thus: Whosoever is neither our Lord nor our God, to him ought we
in no wise to give godly honor, nor yet to worship him: but neither the Angels
nor the dead Saints are our Lords and Gods, but are ministers of our Lord God,
and under him our fellow servant. To them therefore ought we in no wise to
give godly honor, nor yet to worship them: neither do we honor and worship
Christ, because he is holy and righteous, or because that he is beloved of God,
but because he is true and natural God, of one substance with the Father and
the Holy ghost. Veron.

Of the worshipping of Saints.
Look. Saints.

WRATH.
What wrath is in God.
BY wrath is understood, not a disturbaunce or perturbation of mind, for these
things can have no place in God, but as Augustine has well interpreted, in his
Book of the Trinity: Wrath in God signifies a just vengeance. And God is
said to be angry, when he shows forth the effects of an angry man, which are
to punish and avenge. So he is said to repent himself that he had made man,
because like a man that repents himself, he would overthrow his work. Pet.
Mar. upon the Romans fol. 107.

Look. Anger.

WRITTEN.
So much is written, as is necessary for our salvation.
I Suppose the world could not contain the books y^ should be written. Ioh.
21. 25
This is a figurative speech, which does signify y^ there was many things mo
to write, but there remains so much written, as is necessary and sufficient
for our salvation. Ti.

But God would not charge us with so great an heap: seeing therefore that we
have so much as is necessary, we ought to content our selves and praise his
mercy. Geneua.

These things are written, which being well weyed, are plentiful enough to
instruct us in all godliness. I would to God they were so exactly discussed to
embrace godliness, as they are narrowly sifted and stretched to maintain
contention and brawle. Marl. upon Ioh. fo. 613.

S. Austen plainly declares and says, True it is that the Lord has done many
things, the which be not all written, but they have written those things which
ought to be written, and which is sufficient for all believers. Aug. upon the
11. of John. tract. 49.

I am not ignorant (says Bullinger) but that I know that the Lord Jesus both
did and spoke many things which were not written by the Apostles, but it
follows not therefore, that the doctrine of the word of God taught by the
Apostles, is not absolutely perfect. For John the Apostle and Evangelist does
freely confess, that the Lord did many other things also, Ioh. 20. 3^
which were not written in his book, but immediately he adds this and says:
But these are written that ye might believe ye Jesus is Christ the son of
God, and that in believing ye might have life through his name. He affirms by
this doctrine which he contained in writing, that faith is fully taught, and
that through faith there is granted by God, everlasting life. Bullinger. fo.
17.

What it is to be written in the ear^h.
Domine, omnes qui te derelinquunt confundentur, Ier. 17. 1^
recedentes a te in terra scribentur, quoniam derelinquerunt venam aquarum
vi^entium Domini. Lord, all they that forsake thee, shall come to shame: all
they that run from the trust in thy governance and divine providence, hoping
and trusting in the policies of Princes and might of men, they shall be
written in the earth, that is, their name shall be spoken off here in the
earth amongst men, they shall have cappe and knee, and many gaye good morrowes
in this life: In terra scribentur, but in Heaven and in the book of life they
shall not come: Why so? For they have forsaken the vain of living waters, I
mean the Lord and his word. Ric. Turnar.

Whose names are written in the book of life, and whose in earth.
Whose names are not written in the Lambs book of life. Apo. 21. 27
The names of the Apostles and all believers are written in heaven, and the
names of the wicked are written in the earth, according to this saying: They
that depart from thee shall be written in the earth. Iere. 17. 13. that is to
say, they shall be forgotten before God, and before the Congregation of the
righteous: which thing is expressed, under another borrowed speech: The ungodly
are not so, but they be as chafe, which the wind tosseth about. Psalm. 1. 4.
Marl. fol. 191.

They only shall possess that, which are written in the Lambs book of life,
y^ were predestinate thereunto in Christ before the worlds constitution, to be
holy and unspotted in his sight. These are they whom he has in a perpetual
remembrance, whom he has ord^ined of goodness, chosen of mercy, called by
the Gospel, justified through faith, and glorified in the perfourmaunce of his
commandments, that they should be like fashioned to the shape of his son.
Though these of frailenesse offend many times (as the flesh can do none other)
yet deny they not the verity, they abhor not ye scriptures. But after they
have fallen, they repent from the heart, they seek y^ remedies, they hate
their own deeds, they call unto Christ, they lament their chance, they hunger
and thirst continually for the righteousness of God, and such other like. Bale.

Year.
How the year is now, as it was in the old time.
THat which Macrobius does only attribute unto the Egyptians, should have been
more better attributed to the Hebrews: among whom there was always a certain
course of y^ year, which by the circuit of the Sun was observed. The year
was then of twelve months as it is now. The month contained that time as it
does now ye whole course of the Moon, the day like of 24. hours. Whereby
worthily is refused the error of them, which would the years of that age to
be ten times shorter then they be now, which the holy scripture testifies to
be false. The flood began in the 600. year of the life of Noe, in the 17. day
of the second month, and ceased the 30. day of the same month in the year
following, in which place the 11. months is read, whereby it appears that
there were no fewer months in a year, then there be now, and as they lyned then
much longer then we do now, so is it plain that they had far greater bodies
then we have now. Lanquet.

How the year was divided.
Josephus writes that Adam and Seth divided the year into twelve months, and
first observed and taught the course of the celestial bodies. Lanquet.

YOKE.
How the yoke of Christ is to be understood.
TAke my yoke on you and learn of me. We must so shake of the yoke of men's
traditions, Mat. 11. 29
that in the mean season we do not refuse to submit our necks unto the
sweet and pleasant yoke of our Savior Christ, that is to say, we must so put
the intolerable burdens of Antichrists dreams, that in the mean season we
seek no carnal liberty in the Gospel. S. I. Cheek.

Take my yoke upon you (says Christ) for my yoke is sweet and my burden is
light. Mat. 11. 29
By which words they argue the commandments of God to be easy and possible
to be kept. I answer, that these words of Christ mean not the law of Moses,
but are to be understood of the receiving to be our Messiah and Savior, and
that we should become subjects under his kingdom, that is to believe in him,
and to be his Disciples, who in so doing shall find his yoke and subjection
under him to be plesaunt and sweet. For there shall we have remission of all
our sins, shall overcome the Devil and the world, shall be free from death,
shall be eased of ceremonies, shall be raised in the resurrection to everlasting
life, and^ in the mean time shall taste y^ sweet comfort of the Holy ghost in
our hearts. Fox.

In that Christ calls it Iugum meum, my yoke, he means a difference between
his doctrine and the law, and that in respect of the straitness of the law
and the easiness of his doctrine, and of that he requires of his children and
scholars: but how heavy a lump the law is, S. Peter describes in the 15. of
the Acts, where he says thus: Nunc ergo, etc. Now therefore why tempt ye God,
to put on the disciples necks the yoke, which neither our fathers nor we were
able to bear. I. Gough

What the yoke of servitude is.
The yoke of servitude is, to believe that Circumcision and the fulfilling of
the law is necessary to obtain everlasting salvation. D. Heynes.

What this yoke signifies.
For thou shall break the yoke of the peoples burden, Esa. 9. 4.
the staff of his shoulder, etc. This yoke figureth the yoke and burden of
the law, which so oppressed the people, that Saint Peter could say to the
Apostles, y^ neither they nor their fathers were able to keep it. Act. 15. 10.
This yoke has Christ broken according to the Prophecy of Esaias and utterly
discharged the burden thereof. For we know now, that God is satisfied and
contented in the blood of his son Christ, and that the many thousand fold
punishments which are due to our sins, are clean pardoned and forgiven for
the merits of the same Christ. 1. John. 2. 2. The Hebrews expound this of the
destruction of the host of Sennacherib, which was done by the Angel: of the
which in the 37. ver. 36. And call the host of the Assyrians the yoke of the
peoples burden, the staff of the shoulder, the rod of the oppressor. But it
is a more grievous bondage, wherewith the spiritual Sennacherib, of whom the
Assyrians was a certain figure and shadow bound us, and from which Christ has
delivered us. T. M.

What the yoke of transgression is.
The yoke of my transgression is bound upon his hands. Tree. 1. 14.
Mine heavy sins are continually before his eyes, as he that tyeth a thing
to his hand for a remembrance. Geneua.

What is meant by the yoke in this place.
It is good for a man, that he ^eare the yoke of his youth. Tree. 3. 27.
He shows that we can never begin too timely to be exercised under the
Cross, that when the afflictions grow greater, our patience also by experience
may be stronger. Geneua.

IRON FVRNACE.
What is meant by this iron furnace.
ANd brought you out of the iron furnace of Egypt. De^. 4. 20
By this iron furnace is understood anguish and grief, sorrow and carfulness
of heart. 3. Reg. 8. 51. for Egypt was to them an iron furnace, for the great
anguish, sorrow and carfulness of heart which they there suffered. T. M.

Zachary.
How Zachary and his wife are counted just in Scripture.
SCripture commends Zachary and Elizabeth to be both just before God, Luke.
1. ^.
and to walk in all the commandments and iustifications of the Lord. To this
(says Master Fox) I could answer thus: y^ if Zachary and Elizabeth his wife,
were both just before God, it was not because God could not, but because he
would not find fault with them. But to let mine own answer go, I will set
S. Hierome to answer thereunto, where he declares two manner of perfections
to be in holy Scriptures. One which is agreeable to the virtues of God, and is
void of all sin and immutable. And this (says he) is appropriate only to
God, and was here declared in Christ: The other which agrees to our
fragilitie, and is not pure from all sin, and is called perfect, not by
comparison to Gods justice, but so accounted in the knowledge of God, who sees
the good endeavor of ye frail creature, and accepts ye same: and in the
same, produces this example both of Zachary and Elizabeth, and also of Job.
The like answer may be gathered out of S. Austen, who speaking of the
worthiness which is in just men here, says, y^ it may be called perfect, so
far as they both truly acknowledge and humbly confess their own imperfection
going wtall, etc. So y^ of the righteousness of Zachary, we may say as S. Paul
said by ye righteousness of Abraham: y^ if he have any thing to glory, he has
to glory with men and not with god, in whose judgment (says David) no flesh
shall be justified, etc. only y^ flesh of the son of God excepted, who only
being just died for y^ unjust, as Saint Peter witnesses, whereupon I ground
this reason: Christ dyed for the unjust: Zachary and Elizabeth were not unjust
before God (as they say) Ergo Christ died not for them, which is absurd to
grant: so that rather this argument is to be holden, A sensu contrario: Christ
dyed for the unjust: Christ dyed for Zachary and Elizabeth: Ergo Zachary and
Elizabeth were unjust. Again, They that do the commandments do live
therein: Zachary and Elizabeth lived not in the commandments but died: Ergo,
Zachary and Elizabeth did not all the commandments so justly as they should.
Master Fox in his sermon of Christ crucified. fo. 36.

They were both righteous before God, and walked in all the laws and
ordinances of the Lord without reproach. These words are not to be understood
as though Zachary and Elizabeth absolutely fulfilled the law, for then they had
no need of Christ, and Christ had not then said truly in ye 17. of Luke:
Dicite, etc. Say ye, we are unprofitable servants, etc. But therefore they are
said to be just, because God in Christ imputed not to them their sins, for they
were not without their faults. And David is true, who says. Psa. 14. Omnes
declinauerunt: They are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become
abominable, there is no man that does good, no not one. And in this number I
am sure, are also comprehended both Zachary and Elizabeth. And the same Prophet
in the 142. Psa. has thus: Non intres: Enter not into judgment with thy
servant O Lord, for no man living shall be justified in thy sight. And it is to
be supposed, that in these words the Prophet meant not only such as lived in
his time, but also in times both past, then present and to come. I. Gough.

How this place of Zachary, confirms Priests marriage.
A certain Priest named Zacharias of the course of Abia. Luke. 1. 5.
Zachary was a Priest and walked in all the precepts and commandments of God
without blame, and yet he had a wife. Therefore wives do not let, but that we
may both please and serve God in this our ministry. Sir. I. Cheek.

ZEAL.
A definition of this word zeal.
Zeal, is an affection, which consists in that part of ye mind which lusts
or desires, after which by reason of the vehemency follows grief, both
because of y^ fellowship of others, and also for the want of the thing which is
desired. Pet. Mar. upon the R^. fo. 313.
