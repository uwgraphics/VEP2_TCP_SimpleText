To the courteous and friendly Reader.
AS it fares in the estate of al things that are so changed from their first,
as if the Fathers of the first world lived to reuise this last, they should
hardly learn to know that wherein then they lived. So fares it in this use of
these triuiall toys, which men were wont to call by the names of some
personages, whose lives or deaths were deciphered therein: but now framing
their fancies to a new fashion, they will needs have them named according to
their natures, Sicut trahit sua quemque voluntas. And for my self was loath to
break square, I have entitled this History, The nature of a Woman: which
though therein it answer not every man's private expectation in what they mean,
yet could not I fit it better to the matter, containing indeed nothing but the
envious practices of two wicked women: wherein if any take offense, let him for
this time wink at my fault, as rather affecting to frame my self to the new
fashion, that it should be accounted new stuff, then following the old be
esteemed as too stale.

Yours. C. M.

The second part of the History, called the nature of a Woman: containing the
travail of Perseus, after he had fled from his Army.
CHAP. 1.
AFter that the unconstant state of never stayed fortune, had thrown down
these unfortunate people from the height of those heavenly pleasures (which
before they inioyed in prosperity) down even to the lowest degree, of black
bottomless adversity. First, in rooting out the hope of their succeeding
remembrance, likely to live long after they should dye, in their happy
children. Then, with ye eating canker of al undoing envy, seuering asunder by
their wars their well grounded commonwealth, which they so long had governed
in peace. And lastly, laying upon themselves, that which their dissension had
ouerloaded their poor countrime^ withal, the hard sentence of exiles
extremity, more grievous then the coldest kind of bitter pinching poverty; a
more dismal diuorsiue sentence, then is the separation of a secure soul from
an earthly blessed body: for that the one ends all adversity, the other
begins their after misery: the one changes the stinking state of this loathsome
life into the never dying joys of heavenly felicity: but the other with a
countermanding course pulls back the forward fortune of men's still mounting
minds, whom nature feeds with the hope of more and more happy blessings,
into the despayring gulf of all undoing extremity. This is the bridle where
with foul fortune binds in the strong headed state of many mighty
Monarchies, when neither love of virtue, nor hate of vice, fear of their
friends ill, nor care of their own weal, plagues at home, nor other
punishment abroad, can pull back to behold the wicked ways they have over
walked: then suffers she them to persevere in their peevish penance meriting
purpose, till unawares they be assailed with the envious incounters of
unlooked for exile, where they must wear out their age with sorrow, whose
youth was wasted in all joy, and learn to eat the bitter bread of banishment
abroad, that could not satisfy themselves with the abundant pleasures of their
countries content at home, and let their death conquering deeds dye in
desolation, which should after death eternize their everliving names, to their
yet unthought of generation, where no pen shall paint out their perfect
picture, nor any tongue shall tell their true stories: but dye like the soul
(wanting bodies) of brutish beasts; the process of whose forespent life, no
man's memories admits.

Such was the harmefull hap of these now hopeles Kings, who whilst with the
sunshine of their luckie love, they blessed the furthest borders of this their
then thrice renowned regiment, made fortune proud that it lay in her power to
advance them. But now they unadvisedly have broake down the force of their
brotherly affections, entering as nakedly into woe, as whilome when they were
borne into the world, gins like a guideles ship to turn with every tossing
sea, that were wont to stand steady like two sturdie rocks, till at length
severed asunder to go seek their several punishment. Perseus that for his
safeguard had taken his way to the desert hills, that with their height compasses
that country, wasting many a weary day in the sad remembrance of his
shipwreck, gins now by the sour sauce of fortunes adversity, judge with
himself the pleasure of his former prosperity: and like a man that settled
with himself to try the hardest brunts of this envious ill luck, now in
stead of comfortable company, to whom he might complain his case, expels
sorrow with sorrow, and quench the fire of his inward foggie sighs, by
uttering to the ears of those unacquainted echoes, the harsh history of his
ill ending days, delighting in stead of the reply of a favorable friend, to
hear the aggravating echo resounding from the craggie caves of those hollow
hills, the sorrowful sound of woe ending words. Whereat the poor soul sat
down and sighed, till the ouer-charged burden of his heart forcibly breaking
out in abundance of crystal tears, did with sacietie of sorrow make show of
ease to evil, which indeed had no end: whose daily plaints moved with their
mo^es, as the Thracian with his music the hard and ruinous rocks, that
underpropped the skie-brauing tops of those mighty mountains, to melt their
marble sides into the show of melting tears, plaining of him that could not
pity himself, and in stead of helping hands moves their senceles heads, as
willing (though wanting power) to ease his agony. Many days did he spend in
this careful course, cutting out in capital letters upon the barks of those
adjoining trees, the dismal discourse of this his pitiful plight, writing the
records of his woes in the stony tables of hard marble rocks, that might incite
the eyes of every trauailer to tears, and pity his woes, whose wrack they
could not prevent. At last, when even weary with weeping, though still full of
tears, as is the nature of man greedy of novelties, gins with himself devise
how in despite of that distress, he might invent some newfound form to
lament, whose sorrows might satisfy the effect of his intent, and change the
outward semblance of his sorrowful show: and sitting him sadly down by a
bubling spring, wherein he might see the reflexe of his sorrowful face, he
thus begins in a song, to brave the hard brunts of his haples heart, that still
affoorded new fuel for his sorrows fire, fresh springs of tears for his
watrie eyes, and still replying words for his tragic tatling tongue.

Ye merry Muses whose delightful wits,
Busied in framing several pleasing songs,
Come here and dwell by me where sorrow sits,
Studying what tunes to woeful strains belongs:
I Will fit what ever instrument they bring,
And by my voice teach them how they shall sing.
The Bace a tragic touch of my heart strings:
The Tenor troubled sighs that sadly grows:
Next that, my words where lively sorrow sings:
Then doleful thoughts from whence despair still goes:
And last in consort shall my eylids go.
Whence tears destils like little worlds of woe.
The manner how he met with his son, who was supposed to be slain, and what
passed betwixt them two. CHAP. 2.
AS thus he sat singing to himself, (for save himself there was none to rue
with remorse the pitiful tale he so dolefully told) suddenly he might epsy
out of the thickes of a neighboring wood, that grew up in the bosom of a
fair forest, that was round about environed with a circle of mighty
mountains, like the form of an artificial Theater) whence from every several
side the idle beholders sits, and sees the art of imitating acters) a big
boned man, whose sight was somewhat displeasing to him at the first: for that
such is the composition of a melancholy complexion, as that fills the mind with
a thousand several sorts of vain suppositions: whereon the more he thinks, the
more he finds himself to fall short from his thought: and yet wanting
indeed what he supposes to himself, and desires that he had, he contents
himself to think that he were, that he vainly supposes he is: and so
oftentimes expelling the substance of sorrow with the bare imagination of
better fortune, he is as loath to break his conceit, as a king to forgo his
Crown. Yet at the length, seeing the man to frame his journey to the place
where himself then solitarily sat, begins steadfastly to look upon his
limbs, to see how nature did differ in her self, in distinguishing the shapes
of savage Satyrs, borne in the bare bosom of unknown plains, and civil
subjects framed in the pampering palaces of courtly Kings, which he found not
so far off, as he supposed he saw: for the nearer he drew, the fairer was his
show. Naked he was, save that for himself he had framed an unorderly coat of
beasts skins, that covered those secrets which savage creatures abhorres to
see: his hair for want of curious koming, hung long dishiuered about his head,
naturally curled in more cunning knots, then imitating arts, arms other men
withal, whose sable color played with the glorious beams of the all guilding
Sun, as when he rises from his watrie couch he guilds the Eastern seas with
deceiving shows. In his face had nature cunningly co^bined two contrary shows
in one self same subject love and fear, smiling as smoothly on his friends,
as amorous Adonis on his vain intising Venus, and frowning as fiercely on his
enemies, as mighty Mars on his feare-falling foes. Beauty had builded up her
bower, and in pride plumed her feathers in his face: but that for want of a
sunne-shadowing veil, her varnish was somewhat decayed. Young and lusty was
all his lims, strong in the outward show of constitution, and in his every part
dwelt all parts of peereles perfection, which drew the aged King into a wonder,
that those foul unpeopled fields should afford such fair framed forms. On
the other side, the savage man (who till yt time had not been acquainted with
such company, nor before, that he could remember did ever see any one like
himself) makes more haste unto him then before it should seem he intended.
This man was Adrianus, son to this forenamed Perseus, of whom we told you in
the other part of this history, yt in his infancy he was by his wicked working
Aunt sent forth into those forests, with an intent to be betrayed to death:
who by ye unnatural love of a Lioness, had been all this while brought up in
that desert, ignorant what he was, because he wanted those ordinary
directions to tell him the truth: but that the instinct of nature had persuaded
him there were other creatures, then those ordinary company wherewith he daily
dwelt, from whom he must naturally descend: for that he seeing in the common
course of natural increase every beast bring forth his like, it powerfully
persuaded him there were comely creatures like himself, though it never till
then was his luck to see them: and glad in himself that he had at last won
what he long had wished, he made great haste to climb up the weary way, cut
off the side of a hill to get up to the place where he might see him sit: to
whom when at last he came, looking steadfastly in his face, pausing long before
his speech, as unacquainted with cunning salutations, wherewith commonly men
curiously use to resalute one another, gins with wild, and yet witty words,
rudely, and yet rarely in his unacquainted kind demand what he was, that had
hit upon that plain, in which place in twenty long years (for that space had
he there spent) never save himself any such creature came. To whom this cursed
king, after he had thoroughly viewed his perfect proportion, wondering that so
beautiful a body, adorned with so pregnant a wit, should spring from those
unfurnished fields: for as the Diamond that obscured in an uneven rock,
through the thick slough of many slimie shadows shows as it is what it
should be: Roses through transparant lawne sets out their sweet substance by
their fair shows: piercing stars though obscured often with the covert of
some ouer-shadowing cloud, yet through those shadows seems no less
themselves: so fared in the forelorne state of this yet wild man, in whose face
was engraven the characters of far fayrer fortune, then is found in such
desolate dwellings, whose words though wanting that flattering form wherewith
other men use to paint their speeches withal, yet with more discretion did
they proceed from this vntutered truant, then usually we see from many of our
best brought up scholars: for in him was the picture of a perfect man, his
body not bolstered with the apish trims of conceited attire, his mind not
nusled up in the slavish shadow of vain and fruitles folly, his tongue had not
tasted of that intising stream that tips with several tunes the state of
sundry tongues, turning them from the mould wherein nature first had made them
to a new form, wherein art will needs fashion the^, as some for fear, and
other for falsehood to flatter: some for bribes with bitter words to betray, and
other for folly to say and gainsay: some with fair fawning words to undermine
their friends, and others with Synons subtlety to outreach their foes: some
with tatling tales to tell the surest secrets of their firmest friends, and
others with evil endeavors to devise slanderous speeches to spiteful ends.
What should we say on these sorts that dims my mind, more with multitudes the^
the several stars in a winters frostie night dazles the eyes with their
numbers, passes the sands on the shore, the drops in ye sea, the several pebles
in a shewer of hail, or ye infinite abundance of several grains ripe Autumn
reapes from the earths fair face. To be short, there was perfection of body
without the pampering of pride, virtue of mind without the variety of
misleading manners, a true telling tongue that never tasted of a trifling tale:
so here was deciphered the difference betwixt the intent of nature in our
first creation, and the event of use in our education: for that the one first
forms all things to the best, the other in the end frames them commonly to the
worst.

Well, after these two had with such greetings saluted one another, as beseemed
the melancholy disposition of the one, and the rude bringing up of the other,
they with friendly courtesy company together, where the sanage man first
begins earnestly to ask of the others estate: which the king fearfully fained
to be but mean, and that he having trod ye tract of an almost vnworne way,
had by hard hap hit upon that place: and being ignorant what way to escape, had
there long lingered, as is the common use of such distressed men, carefully
considering with himself what way were best to work his own release from that
wast way wanting wilderness. To whom the savage man began thus answer. I that
know not from whence thou came, am far unable to direct thee whither thou
should back again go, and save myself lives there none here like to thee.
Twenty fair Summers flowers have I seen fade in these fields, and sustained
the stubborn brunts of as many winter blasts, seen the several shapes of
sundry beasts, and marked their manners in their several kinds, how the
stately Lion proudly commands the other poor crouching creatures, and they in
their kind dutifully demean themselves to his sovereignty: mine ears have
heard the several sounds of their sundry voices, but could not distinguish
them. Often have I spoke to the cruel beasts, thinking they could skill of my
words: but they all rudely runs away without answering again: then fearing
least that threatening words had with fear forced their flight, began I with
submisse entreaties to crave their companies: but that as did the first
perished without hope, and left me still to mine ill hap, which often urged me
to consider with my self what my self might be, differing in making,
disagreeing in manners, and failing of every means that I made for my further
instruction. No place is here that I have not often sought, to see of whom I
might issue: for that thus much has nature taught me, that needs I must come
from a like kind as do all creatures else. Little I remember my self as I
have seen the young whelps of these careless creatures that possess these
plains, and by the process of time am by degrees grown to this state,
wherein now thou see I stand. And thus with a long discourse gins he debate
unto him, how from his infancy to that age, he had lived in those unpeopled
lawnes. At last, when they with much interrogatory talk had passed away a long
summers day, and that now the shadow of the silent night began sommon every
creature to their quiet rest, the savage man loath to leave his new found
companion alone, to spend the solitary night in that uncomfortable case,
persuades him to accompany him down into the bottom of a declining valley, yt
a far off he showed him: who for that he had marked the trueth-shewing tales
of his former talk, and being comforted by his well-wishing words, not to
fear the furious onsets of outrageous beasts: for that such was his
acquaintance amongst the unreasonable rulers of that foretold forest, as that
like the quiet citizen within the peaceful walls of his house, is in the
stealing silence of the quiet night (by the watchful means of a well meriting
Magistrate) defended from the forcible invasions of ill meaning enemies: so he
in his quiet Cave securely sleeps, little fearing the fury of these bold
beasts, in whose company he had always conuersed. At last, won with the
words of this fair foretelling friend, the king weary with solitary sitting
there alone, and willing also to ease his head of those cruel cares that
solitary discontent had clogged him withal, he willingly condescends to the
others wish. These two travailing thus together, at the last comes down again
into the bottom of the plain, where (for it was now almost night) were
assembled diverse sorts of sundry wild beasts ready addressed to go seek
their pray: amongst whom when they came, as does the silly sheep to their
acquainted shepherd, gently give him way to travail where ever he will: so
fares it with these two, that at their pleasure trace these deserts up and down
through many dangerous dark shades, that ouerspreads the hidden caves of
sundry subtle devouring beasts. At last they came down into a long valley,
where out of the side of a rockie cliffe was naturally hewed a deep hollow
Cave, into which was a conueiance of light through the clift of a rock that
ouer-roofed this house: where the wild man not used with curious welcomes to
entertain any such guests, gins plainly perform the duty of a well-meaning
man, telling him that his good will wished him better then his power was able
to perform.

Not long had these two sitten alone in this loathsome beastly den, ere there
comes in a bloody mouthed Lioness, bearing in her tearing teeth the quarter
of a new killed Kid. This was that Lioness that in the former part of this
history we told you of found this young prince, desolately forsaken in the
desert, whom she in his infancy carefully brought up, nursing him with that
milk wherewith she should have sustained her young ones, till the ripenes of
years had strengthened his stomach, and made him now able with use to feed
on raw flesh with those ravenous beasts: for whose provision this careful
nurse had provided that filly supper: who coming to her den, and finding there
unaccustomed company, gins sternly to stare in his face, as though she meant to
prosecute her angry countenance, and terribly tear him in pieces with her
unmerciful claws: till when she saw the savage man (that had for his better
safeguard brought him down into the depth of that dungeon) friendly embrace him
in his arms, as though thereby he meant to rescue him from all ensuing harms:
then gins she turn her frowning countenance to fawning compassion, her
terrible threats to a tractable truce, kindly with her dumb demeanor (such as
nature has furnished these reasonles creatures withal) entertaines this
trauailer, licking kindly his hands, which otherwise she could not kiss,
softly touching him with her hard talens as loath to hurt him ^ow, whom before
she intended to harm. Thus with what courtesy their unkindly cottage did
afford, do they intertaine this their new com'd companion: who not used to
eat such undressed dishes, as their hungry stomachs gently digested, was
content that night to live only with looking on their kind of life, still
thinking to himself, what and how great was his own fall, that whilome being
the commander of so many men, was now thus at the command of one silly beast.
But for that necessities extremity is comprehended within no bounds of
civility, as also because he feared if he should again fall into his old
frantic fury, it would alter the minds of these kindly using creatures to the
execution of some other act: force of the one, and fear of the other, so
brideled his boundles grief, that perforce he must needs refrain from
sheading those mercie-mouing tears, which for all that he was scarce able to
detain. At last, after the many terrors of that tedious night, gins the golden
Sun, by the forerunners of his fiery carre, tell to the world the gladsome
approach of his coming, when as Aurora gins with her searching show enter
through the close crannies of that clifted rock: at whose approach wakens this
savage man from his unnatural nurse, and greeting his guest with such
salutations, as then for want of better served their turns, he leads him from
thence down lower to the side of a fair fountain, that issued from the root
of a crystal rock, whose water cleerer then the crystal from whence it
came, reuiues the dead senses of drooping beholders to look upon ye swift
stream, that with his bubling melody (far passing the murmuring musickes of
Aganippus wels, that waters the Arcadian meades) were able to draw the floting
Dolphins from the watrie bosom of the sea, to stand amazed at their music, as
whilome they did at the well tuned strings of sweet Orions harp, when from the
cruel means of massacring mariners, they surely shielded him to the safe
shore. There these two sits them down to wash their weary bodies in that
purifying spring, where the savage man still urging this unfortunate King
further to relate the manner of his life. At last, whether urged by inward
grief, that most delights in despairing it self, or forced thereunto by the
persuasions of this his savage son, gins at last to declare the whole story
of his ill ending reign: first recounting the surpassing pleasures that are
compassed within the Crowns of Kings: then the honor they every day receive
from many millions of serviceable subjects. And when he had largely related
all these forepassed pleasures, then like AEneas, when he described to woe
weeping Dido, the sunerall flames yt had fired fair Ilions glory, with sad
faced sighs he the^ settles him down to tell the tragic story of his own
fall. Which when this wild man had attentively heard, considering with himself
the great occasion, that should draw down so many distilling tears from the
eyes of so patient a creature, as he seemed to be, began thus answer his yet
unknown father. If (quoth he) with the unstable storms of wind, the strong
Cedars that stoutly stands on the tops of high mountains firmly rooted in
flintie rocks, be so suddenly thrown down, what shall small shrubbes shroode
themselves withal, who yet scarce recovered, but entering the superficies of
the earth, is hardly able to abide the sweet breathed Southern blast? If such
be the unconstant state of your greatest Kings, what is the fickle fortune of
your seruill subjects? Then see I my self here happy in despite of fate,
having naught wherein to joy, I shall lose nothing which should urge me to
weep. Much talk passed betwixt them to this effect, when as the King willing
to be again released from that prison, wherein he was perforce detained, fell
in persuading this wild man to accompany him into the peopled world, where he
might live with men, and leave these wild woods where was no company but
beasts, telling him the pleasure was like to proceed from the one, and the
lasting pains he should still be put into by the other. But so far had the
former tale of his rising and sudden falling dissuaded him from dwelling in
that Icie stay, where he that is surest is uncertain how long he shall stand,
that he thought it better dwelling in a lowly valley, from whence lower he
could not fall, then climbing to the height of a hill, where his fortune was
ever in danger to fade. At last when the King perceived all his labor lost, he
desired his companion again to conduct him to the place where before he found
him solitarilie sitting by himself: which though he was loath to do, fearing
least by that means he should lose his company, yet notwithstanding enforced
by the earnest entreaty of this his new found friend, he condescended to his
request. And they two together travailed so long that at length they came down
into another dale on the other side of that hill where the morning before they
met, through which lay many fair pleasant paths that directed the way to every
adjoining place, where the savage man loath to stray too far, least he should
not happily hit back again on his own way, leaves his friend to his better
fortune, where for a while we must also leave them both, Perseus in travailing
into the world to seek some more faithful friends, and Adrianus returned
back again into the forest, to his accustomed company.

How Theseus in his flight was intercepted by the thieves that first saved his
daughter, and what followed of that. CHAP. 3.
IN this time Thesers, that was the other brother, who after the overthrow of
his army, had taken his way toward those plain forests yt borders upon the
banks of the sea, was in his travail circumuented by many outlawes, that
houering upon the high ways accustomably used to spoil poor passengers, who
seazing upon that bootles pray, pulls him perforce home to their cave, which was
in that place where before we told you his daughter was surprised by those
thieves, when her Aunts servant intended to drown her in that sea that now
seuers the Christian coast from the bounds of over burned Barbary. Where when
he came, he begine cunningly to dissemble his estate, least by that means he
might be prevented of his further purpose, faining himself to be a poor
country peasant that had thither wandered from his way, alleging simplicity
for his excuse. And for that there remained now about him no tokens that might
tell from whence he came: for to prevent that purpose, he had exchanged all
his kingly robes with a base slave, that in his flight he met by the way:
whereby being believed by them to be what he barely affirmed himself, and
destitute of such purchase as they promised themselves he had been possessed
of, seeing him a goodly man like to stand them instead, they begin to persuade
him to follow that lewd life themselves did there profess, which was the
robbing and dispoyling of poor people, the neighboring inhabitants of that
cursed country. Whereto he for fear condescended, least if he should have
denied, their cruelty might have cut away the hope of his after harvest, which
for all this trouble he hoped in the end to atchieue. And so walking
homewards, in their way they began to instruct him in their theeuish
occupatio^, he should mercilesly spoil the poor, rob the rich, without
remorce bereave them of their lives, that stubbornly stand out against their
endeavors. Spending ye time in these villainous practices, at length they drew
near home, where ready to intertaine them was the Captain of these
co^federates walking with his wife, a goodly woman, richly attired with the
precious spoils that these unthrifty villains had forcibly taken away from
many true men in their travail. This woman was that Liuia that we told you
before was taken away from her friends, with an intent to have bin slain: but
rescued by those Outlawes, had a long time made her abode amongst them, and as
growing in years, so in beauty and commendable qualities, was at the length
beloved of him that was chief Captain of that cruel company, and at last
were married together, of whom he begot a fair daughter, whose name was
Larina, which they tenderly brought up, thinking that one day fortune would so
favorably smile upon them, as to grace their government, as that they should
by some means reduce it from barbarous outlawed cruelty, to authentic well
governed civility. To these two their factors present this spoil, which
though he were poor, yet did hope persuade them that he would supply their
necessity in another matter, though he deceived their expectations in the
present possession of such rich prize, as commonly they were accustomed to
find of such as they suspected him to be. To be short, they entertained him
well, because they would encourage him to serve them with the like: where for a
while he changed his sometimes happy estate, to the inforciue fury of their
more then brutish behavior, where with they accustomed to handle all that came
in their hold. At length, after he had long time inured himself to this kind
of company, walking one day under the solitary shadow of a sheltring rock,
upon whose top those people for their pleasure had framed the form of a
gorgeous garden, and with great labor (for what will not pains perform)
planted diverse springs of several trees, that with their continual comforting,
with supply of such things as added more moisture to their roots, then the
barren rock, were grown up very high, under whose shadow one d^y to shelter
her self from the heat of the sun, was solitarily set. This Lady where
tuning the strings of a sweet sounding Lute, she to their trembling strain
warbles forth this dittie.

If every creature make such mirth
To see his kindred in their kind,
How then may I bewail my birth,
Which wants that means to cheer my mind?
No tongue can tell where I was bred,
Nor any happy man relate
The place from whence I first was led,
To wear here in this woeful state.
Unto whom he that all this while had heard her sad song, begins thus to answer
her in another sort.

And I must sing another note,
Whom fortune has cast down
From fames fair top, where I did flote,
In sorrows lap to drown.
Whence she looking down to see what echo should readily in her own vain
answer her again, espies this new entertained servant of theirs sitting so
solitarily under the side of a rock, to whom she calls to come up unto her into
the garden, that she might further confer with him about his estate, which
yet he made so strange. To whom when he came, he begins rufully to lament his
forelorne estate, telling her all the story of their vnbrotherlike strife,
even until that present place wherein they were: whose many tears moved such
mercy in the ear of this passionate Lady, as the promising her aid to
release him from that thraldom, he boldly goes forward to disclose the drift
of his devise, telling her that the scope of his intent was either to depart
far from the remembrance of that country, or else to stir up some
neighboring friends of his that dwelt in an adjoining Island to those confines,
to rise with him in arms for the recovery of his kingdom: to the furtherance
whereof, would she but work some means for his release, if fortune and his
forward stars did but further his friends, he would so remunerat that good
turn, as she should bless the time wherein she first intended such an
enterprise. Which when he had vehemently vowed, she to avoid suspicion sends
him away: and afterward gathering from her husband, and the rest of their
servants, which way they meant the next day to address themselves, and so
plotting her purpose, shift his escape by a contrary way, that night furnishes
him with all such necessaries, as her poor provision could afford, and so
secretly sends him away: where we must a while leave him in his travail to try
his friends, and she with her husband in his homely rockie house, and come once
more to those wicked women, by whose means was grown all their misery.

How the two Queens met both together in the Lions den where Adrianus was
brought up, and how by his means they were rescued. CHAP. 4.
THey by the censure of the just judging senate, that had secretly searched
almost the depth of their devise, and by such circumstances, as the process of
that little proof they had did afford them, sound the greatest fault of that
fury in these worse then wicked women, had for ever forbidden them further
abode within the bounds of that kingdom, until they could by their accord
join those again that their discord had disseuered, and be themselves the
means of their peace, that of themselves had bred their wars: who taking
them to this several search, gins now frame themselves to be obedient to all
that before were second to none, clad in course sackcloath that were not
contented with rich silks, spending the dark nights under the doleful shades
of Cipresse bows, that had scorned the pleasure of princely beds; in stead of
those choice dainties whereon before they fed, now content with ye meanest
meat that the earth did afford. Doriabella that was wife unto Perseus the
eldest brother, she wandering through the unknown ways of a wide forest, was
there suddenly incountred in ye same place, where by her means her son
Adrianus sho ulde have been murdered by the like luck with a fierce
Lioness, of whom she being afraid, made means to escape away: but all in
vain, for the beast seazing upon her body, countermands her course, and
perforce carries her down to the same den where she fostered her child: for
this was the same Lioness that saved Adrianus from the cruelty of that
cutthrote caitiffe that had cunningly contrived his end: where, for that the
beast had some extraordinary intent, to provide for her fostered child some
company of his own kind for him to consort withal, or that the Gods in their
great unsearchable wisdom had lengthened out her life to a worse intended
end. This brute beast without offering her violent injury, which is a thing
not commonly found in their kind, sets her safely down in her cave, where she
quietly kept her till such time as her companion came in, to whom with her
fair wonted fawning she presents her prize. The woman better imboldened at the
show of a man, then she was of the still fearful sight of the beast, begins
somewhat to recover her lost color, and with fearful cries gins suddenly
implore his aid against the envy of that her natural enemy. At whose sight
the man somewhat joyful to see the shape of another, in whom was represented
the show of himself, gins with his ordinary intertainment to welcome her to
that homely house, telling her that such was the extraordinary nature of that
beast, that she would never harm any creature: and then falling into further
talk, he begins to enquire of her what drowe her down into those melancholy
meades, where save himself seldom or never comes any such creatures. To whom
she begins to relate a contrary course of her foreled life, fearing least the
very sound of her voice in reiterating the remembrance of her death-meriting
deeds, would not only incur his anger, but stir up that senceles beast to
wreake their woes, whom she so unworthily had wronged, and therefore tells him
that she was a woe wearied woman, that in her melancholy moodes bad left the
poor place where she dwelt, to soiourne in some uncouth unfrequented shade,
where no delightful day might solicit to her sad memory, the love of her
forepassed life no cheerful sun might cherish her cold chilled limbs, nor
pleasant news of never dying joy might bring her back again to her former
felicity. At which tale the wild man, though himself had never felt the force
of powerful passions, that winds men's bodies like a workmanship in wax: yet
pitying that in her he never tasted in himself, tells what truth told him,
that hard was her hap to change her cheerful consorting company of friends,
to desolations sad discomforture amongst her foes, to come from whence she was
first brought up, to that place where she was finally cast down, except (quoth
he) you can frame your fancy to undergo the beastly behavior of these
uncivil creatures, amongst whom I now live, and with whom I mean to dye: for
such a rumor hear I to run of the inconstant course of mightiest
monarchies, which also in some I have seen true, that from the highest branch
they are often bowed down even to the lowest bark of the bulk, that I find
more sweet content in this unchangeable stay, then they in their stedfastest
state. In which talk they beguiled the time, till night ouertaking them both,
admits no more interpassage of friendly speech, where he to his ordinary rest,
and she to her accustomed complaints, betakes themselves, she telling in
secret to her sad heart the heavy burden of her groaning griefs, whose heavy
soul melted with the inforciue fury of her still crying sorrow, destils in
amber tears: sometimes she thinks of her husband, and then hope helps her up
with this thought, that though long, yet they shall again meet at last. Then
remembers she the children, as well that of her own as the other, that by her
means was massacred, supposing heavens had heaped just vengeance upon her for
her former sins. And lastly, when she thought upon her self, then comes
dead death with his crasie colored countenance, and inforces her not to blush
for shame, as do the outward shows of offenders, but look pale for pity as
the use of such guilty guides, that not only leads themselves into that
recureles gulf of never recovering grief, but also intises other into a world
of woes, from whence there is no retiring. Thus did she prevent that which ever
was assaying to prevent her, the all stilling state of secure sleep, where her
thought was still stumbling of some sin, whose just judgment was likely to
ensue upon her after life, till in the secret of the silent night there
suddenly sounded over their heavy heads ye noise of a fearful pursuit, as
though some angry beast had insolently risen upon another simpler sort, where
suddenly into the Cave where they then lay, descends down the likeness of a
lively creature, not such as was wont to accompany them in their Caves, but
others that elsewhere, with untimely disturbance waken the sleeping wits of
watchful men, at which they were all afraid. The Lioness for that she these
many days had never been in any such sort disturbed; the man for that since
his first coming thither, he never viewed any such thing; the woman for that
she dreamed of some extraordinary event that should ensue of that sudden
uproar: but as every wonder becomes at last more ordinary then it shows at
the first, so in the end by the shadow searching Moon, they might more easily
epsy that which had driven them all into this extraordinary doubt, the
substance of the other sister, whose fault was equal with the first, and so was
her repentance as ready as any of the rest. But how sudden sorrow ouertooke
her heavy heart, in finding that in the end from which she fled in the
beginning, a Lion from whose claws she thought she had cleared her self. But
as it fares in the ever swelling surges of the senceles seas, that the weary
water working men fall from the greedy gripe of Sillaes shiuering shores, into
the covert of Charibdes cruel course: so fares it with her that flying from the
bare show of death, was fallen into darkness it self. Where when she saw so
many contraries coupled in one subject, as cruelty with courtesy, fell
inforciue fury with friendly for bearing fellowship, reasonable caitiues there
subject to unreasonable creatures, soul possessing bodies with savage
professing beasts. But at length she satisfied with the show of them, and they
glutted with gazing on her, the savage man as courteously begins to welcome her,
as he gave gentle greetings to the other, and with such words as his yet
unkindly courtesy did afford, intertaines her. And for that the trouble some
time of the night did not afford such show of further favor, as by his promise
he purposed to perform in the day: she by the other softly sits down her
self, betwixt whom you must now imagine such dumb demeanes of friendship, for
fear to proceed, as whilst they were, well could not come from courteous love.
There do these two with outward shows display ones plaints to the others
passions. Many dumb demeanes passed betwixt these two, till after long
lingering shows, that with their dissembling shadows, had lulled again into
a slumber these two careless creatures, whose nature suspecting nothing else but
naked truth, without all further inquisition falls again fast asleep: which
when these two woeful women had warily weyed, they taking this advantage of
time, gins quickly one to murmur to another the events of their several
iournies. And here must I now leave further to enuey against their enmity, and
talk now of their solemn contrition, wherein we must not wey the ruin of
their childrens rape, but the remorce of their sins remembrance: faults that
are peeuishly persecuted, deserves the pity of no one: but crimes wilfully
committed, with the remedy of repentance are mightlly amended. Which in these
two proved most true: for there each other confessing to themselves in these
perils the dangers they did one to another in their peace, with womanish woe
that ofter in tears more bewayles their unfortunate ends, then they foresec
their two forward beginnings, and then with many tears torments themselves too
much, which they might well have prevented with a little, cursing too late that
which is come at last upon those crimes they committed at the first. And here
let me show their unconstant state, not standing always in a stay, but
wavering like the wind, sometimes prosecuting with loathed disdain, them
which once they did follow with loving desire: then changing their copy as
cowards do their countenance, that waver with the wind of every buzzards blast,
they again begin to desire what before so deeply detested: sometimes with
hasty men too soon breeding their own sorrow, and then with sloathfull
siuggards deferring too long to salve their own sores, oftentimes weauing
their own woe, when they suppose they work another wrack. For so unwary
are their wits, that they never think of that should follow, from the force of
that which goes before: but like the unfortunate Lark that drawn down with
the dazeling glide of a deceiving glass, delighting so long in his game till
he be catched in the gin: so fares it with these fond fools, that God knows
are too greedy of some silver deceiving shows, and yet busy enough to bite
off others golden baits. Yet not so provident as the poor Sparrowe, that
having escaped the foulers fetter, with her cheerful chirping gives notice to
the rest of her neighbors: but where themselves have seen many fall, they yet
desperately follow.

Here might I extend this Satyricall vain, but that I will not be accounted as
one that loathes what other me^ loves: and therefore wish they could amend what
even themselves sees plainly amiss, and in themselves learn to fear that,
which by example of their own sex they cannot beware. And thus pitying them,
whose hurt rests only in themselves to help, I will refer you to wonder at
these two wicked women, whose deeds had so far divided the^, till that
unlooked for luck had met them together again in that desolate place, whom
deserving divorce had parted in their peopled palace: there gin they one to
another relate the tragic story of their forepassed purposes in their diverse
imaginations of each others injury, till at last according in one consent they
mutually move what they had maliciously meant, till that lamenting each to other
their lewd lives, they with instant iutreaties solicites the neuersayling
forces of all helping heavens, that with favor they would look upon their
faults that had indeed deserved their just frowns. For such must I needs say
is the composition of those, though often careless, yet more usual comfortable
creatures, that if for want o^ well guiding government they sometimes fade, yet
seldom do they for ever fall. For such is their flexible nature, as like the
Philosophers table they willingly impose upon themselves every several
impression, but commonly their nature nourishes but one: as when the profit
proving merchant viewes the several sorts of sundry commodities, though there
be many that he well could like of, yet is there but some few that especially
he can love: so is it in the seldom security of this sex, that busying
themselves with many, they bind themselves but to a few. Nay, shall I compare
them to a fitter form of reason resembling creatures, as when the Lapwing
houering far from her nest, seems to descry the danger of her young near
hand, which he that suffers his patiens to search shall find far off: so
have I heard it proved true of them, whose policy in this I must needs
approve, if well performed to be perfect: for that they color thereby the
cunning of their own skill, and withdraw the otherwise beholders affections
far off, not to look to that practice they in such secret perform. But now
leave we the^ in this inforciue peace, y^ end of their selfe-wrought war,
learning to live like the Lion in fear, that lightly before regarded the
liberty of love, and look back again to our first painful pilgrim.

How Perseus came to the Court of Ferdinand the French King, and of him got
aid for the recovery of his country. CHAP. 5.
PErseus seeking some refuge after he had forsaken the company of his
unsuspected son, at last directs his course to clime the mighty Alps, and
go renew his acquaintance now in France in his age that he had got there in
his youth, where his old father had kept him long at school to learn there
the rudiments of art, whereof their own country was not then so well stored:
where coming to the Kings court, was at the first lightly received of them,
whom sometimes he had graced with his company: imitating the example of
unmerciful masters, that when a silly servant, wherein was sometimes their
treasure, falls by mishap to any sudden mischance, the^ presently accounts he
not of him so w^ll as of a slave, who^ he was wont to use familiarly as his
friend. Yet at the last uncovering the cause of his care, and with tears
telling them the truth of two true stories, Ferdinand (for so was then that
French kings name) pitying the ill hap of his age, of whom there was such
great hope in his youth, answers him again in tears, the ensigns of grief,
and comforting on him up with the presages of more favorable fortune, gins bid
him but devise with himself how he might any wise do him good, and he would
willingly not only employ his country and kingdom, but hazard his own
health to do it, though now death had displayed his colors on his hoarie
head, and currishly counterchecks his courage. Which reply so relieved the
dying countenance of this other worse then captive king, as that calling back
his de^aying senses, whose vigores were now all mustering about the laboring
heart, every one expecting a sundry answer for their several release, makes
him begin again to look for longer life, who before desired nothing more then
a speedy death. And first with humble thanks rendering to the king he begins
to explain unto him his intended purpose, which was, that if he could by his
friendly favor get but again together a moytie of those men which before he
had missed, and by his own negligence undone, his intent was again to invade
his country, and set himself once more in his kingdom. To whom the old king
offered all speedy aid he was able to perform, whom we leave a while
mustering their soldiers to send over the Alps into Italy, and now talk of
Theseus.

How Theseus persuading the King of Barbary to the spoil of his country,
obtained the aid of the Moors. CHAP. 6.
THeseus, who after by the means of his unknown daughter had freed himself
from that danger, shipping himself in a little gallie that was then going over
into Africa, he commits himself to y^ mercy of the seas, from whom the
well wishing winds had soon set him free. Where when he came, he politikely
begins to consort himself with a noble man, whom the black king of that
country had before (whilst these two brethren did together lovingly sway the
Scepter of their quiet kingdom) employed upon embassage unto them, and unto
him delates his drift, telling how he by the means of mutinous subjects, was
wrested out of his country and kingdom, and driven to seek relief in that
strange soil, protesting that if he could by any means come by sufficient
supply of men and munition, that would but in revenge of these injuries ouerrun
his countries, he not looking again to possess his Crown, would yield up
both the spoil of his country and the possession of his kingdom to the
conqueror. To which pleasing tale the Moore giving some ear, for that in them
was rooted an old grudge against the Italians, spurs speedily to the King to
certify him of this offered occasion of rigorous revenge upon their old
enemies. To whom he listening, desirous both to scourge that country that had
often scourged him, and also to enlarge the bounds of his kingdom beyond the
border of the binding sea that separates those several parts of the world, and
keeps the inhabitants within the compass of their own country, offers
hasty help to the performance of the others request, and in the mean time
whilst all these things were making ready, they contrary to their former sort
of civility, ge^tly entertain him, under whose color they were in such hope
of success in those wished wars. Now begins the coal black curres rejoice
within themselves in very conceit of conquest, dividing the spoils before they
were about to begin the battle, telling of their triumphs before they well
knew what it was they should win: here are whole Dukedomes cast away at dice
upon a drums head, before they almost dreamed what it was that should be had:
where we will a while leave them two providing their pretended forces for
Italy, and come again to the Outlawes, where we left Liuias daughter coupled
in marriage with their chief Captain.

How the Outlawes seeking their pray, by chance met with Adrianus the wild man,
and how they persuaded him to leave that place, and what followed thereof. CHAP.
7.
THey after their custom, dividing themselves into diverse companies, searches
al ye conueying ways of their country for to find some fit pray, where some
of them travailing further the^ their accustomed compass, because fortune had
not affoorded them such favor as at the first to speed themselves, they were
therefore enforced to follow the trace of some way, in which they hoped at
last (though it were too long) to meet with some or other booty that would
bountiously guerdon their travail. So long they traced to and fro that they
got up to the top of a high hill, whence they might see down below in the
dale a man alone, whose show was not such as they wished, trimmed up in
gorgeous golden apparel, but covered with a beasts skin on his back,
bearing a knottie club, such weapons as nature there had framed for him, and
walking up and down in these deserts, made the silly beasts with obeisance
crouch to his countenance, as did Alcides terrify the furies in the bosom of
burning hell. This was Adrianus that was there alone walking the wide circute
of those melancholy meades, to whom they posting apace, thinking by surprising
him, though of himself they should reap small commodity, yet by his means
they might be directed to some more profitable place. This savage man looking
back, and seeing so many suddenly descend from the top of ye hill, whose
unorderly approach as he supposed, pretended little good: he naturally
foreseeing what inconveniences might follow, addressing himself to his
defense with his natural wrought weapon, which was a young oken plant, and
perceiving them especially to shape their course to him, stoutly stands still
to see some end of their actions. To whom when they came near, his fierce
countenance half afrighted them, that standing all still like the star
gazers at the transforming head of Gorgon, durst not once so much as enquire
what he was, till one hairebraine companion taking the advantage of his weapon,
that was not used to the cunning sleights of fence, got quickly within him, and
shifting himself from the weighty fall of his club, supposed with some nimble
slight to overcome him: which when the savage man perceived, getting hold of
him with one of his hands, before the other had performed his purpose, gives
him such gripe as squisies perforce the pithie marrow from most of his strength
bearing bones, and so leaves him suddenly slain, that intended such
unacquainted injury to him. Which when the rest of his fellows saw, being
about forty in number, though half afraid all of them to set upon that silly
one, yet loath to leave their fellows ruin unrevenged, they begin altogether
to assault him, who with the weight of his weapon dealt such right down blows
amongst them, as whosoever it lighted on it quite killed, or at the least lamed
them. Long continued their combat, for that they sustained the foil, and
therefore were loath for their credits to leave the field: yet at ye length
being almost half of them spoiled, or quite spilled, the rest dispayring to
run away, least he should overtake their flight, in all humility suddenly
throws down themselves at his feet, entreating favor for their rash
offense, and that their fellows death might satisfy his desire: on whom his
gentle nature could not inflict further fury, but with a good will accepts
their homage as they offer their humility. And then falling into further
conference, begins discourse unto him what they were, and to what end they
were come thither, whom he handles with all humility, laying open unto them
his own estate, his manner of life in those peopleles places, and what ever
had happened unto him since his first remembrance, carrying them home to his
Cave, and there letting them see the manner of his life, where they found
sorrowfully sitting these two sad sisters, whose fore ill spent lives had
brought upon them this loss, to whom he also begins to relate the strange
manner of their arriual. At last, after they had walked with him round about
the borders of his bounds, they begin to dissuade him from that beastly place
of abode to go abroad into the world, and there learn to live like a man,
showing what danger was in the one, and what delight in the other, persuading
him that by ye means time would try the truth of this his fedious search, in
be wraying the means by which he was brought thither. Unto whom a great while
he would give no ear, because it should seem that contented estate wherein he
then stood so fitted his humor, as that he little regarded all the gay
stories they could tell him of glory or dignity, wealth, or whatsoever good
thing this world does give. Yet at the last with their incessant persuasions,
he determined a while to go try the truth of their story: but with this
promise, that as they proffered honestly to use himself, so should they also
kindly comfort those two distressed women, that had unhappily straied from
their homes, and rely them only upon his relief. Which they with many
protestations solemnly promised to do. And so in the end taking away with him
those two, by whose means he was made the subject of that nuscha^ce, departed
altogether from that place, and iournied toward their homes again. In which
way nothing was done, save that they still were telling one to another the
story of their foreled lives: and with that tattle beguiling the time, till
they came to the place where was their abode, and there presenting to their
Captain their pray, they begin to relate what happened them in their journey.
Thus with many salutations was he entertained, and often employed in their
affairs, wherein he so prosperously proceeded, as that he was not only
beloved of all the company, but dearly esteemed of their chief Captain, and
so still employed abroad. In the mean time were the poor Queens, whom
fortune had thus baned to and fro, busied at home: for by this time were these
Outlawes waxen exceeding rich, and their Captain entirely affecting Liuia his
wife, daughter to one of these unknown Queens, had carefully provided her of
the curiousest conceits that all that country did afford: where, for that
these two women that had sometimes been Princes over many people, could well
skill of that kind of pa^pering pride which women are wonted to use, grew in
such great request with their Lady, that above all her attendants they
especially were honored. Here hence grew they again into a new mutiny which
of them should best deserve to be desired, one privily seeking to spoil what
another had curiously conceited, the other practizing means to hinder her
sisters work, that it might prove of little worth. Long in this sort began they
disagree, till at last with their envious emulation they stirred up all the
assembly to such strife, as had not the care of the charie Captain in time
reformed, it had brought selfe-working harm upon their own heads. Such was
the grounded malice of these two cruel creatures, as that though fear in
extremity made them agree as friends, yet in the least show of peeping
prosperity they begin again the fierce assaults of deadly foes. Who for the
better agreement of their whole house, they were glad to separate in twain, to
see if that bred friendship being asunder, that brought out nothing but hatred
betwixt them whilst they were together.

How both the Kings brought their borrowed armies both together into the
country, and how the citizens levied arms against them, and what was the end
of that war. CHAP. 8.
IN the mean time whilst these things had thus happened, the two disseuered
Kings (of who^ before we told you) had brought in both their several
supplies of men and munition for the conquering of their lost kingdoms, and
pitching their tents upon the territories of that careful kingdom, begins
with intermissiue messages to sommon the inhabitants, to render over again
that rule which so long they had retained. Where in the Senate house at one time
meets both these messengers, craving the kingdom for their several masters:
yet till that time those cursed Kings had not heard what was become one of
another. To whom the Senators wisely with courteous countenances gave this
answer: That for so much as they were there met to challenge the kingdom
severally to themselves which should be jointly inioyed of them both, pleased
but their Lordships to give them leisure for these few days to consider of
this case, and then they would answer them both to their own contents. With
which answer the messengers departed back again to their several masters.
After whose absence, these careful pillars of that craft Commonwealth,
begins to consider with themselves what were best to do in these dangerous
days. At length they thought good themselves, that to avoid the
inconveniences which was likely to light upon them by this purpose, it were
best for them, as they did at the first, to gather forces together: for by
other means they would not be appeased, and by that devise assay to drive
them back again. Which the better to effect (for that country was scarce
able of it self to afford sufficient force for that fight) they presently
dispatch assurance of pardon, and promise of rich reward and great dignities
to the Captains of all those Outlawes, that were encamped in several places
of that country, if but by such a day they would bring in their several
powers, to the end they might augment their army against these home-borne
enemies. Which proclamations was so effectually performed, as that within a
short time there were gathered together an infinite number of such people as
lived in the mountains, and other remote places of that country, upon the
spoil of other people: amongst whom was the band of Outlawes, wherein Adrianus
was entertained: who being gathered altogether, began to address themselves to
the several functions in furnishing themselves to the field. In the mean time
came the day wherein they were to give answer to their several demands. At
what time comes back both the Harolds to know their determinations. To whom
the Senators foreappoynted for that purpose, begins thus mildly to resolve
them in their requests. Since (quoth he) the state of these times wherein we
now live, requires such surety of safeguard, as may withstand the envious
force of any froward fortune, we to prevent the purpose your ill meaning
masters intend, which is no less then the ruin and decay of our whole
Commonwealth; as strongly as we may have here furnished our selves with such
forces, as this time and place could afford. But for that once (which we must
ever confess) they were our happy Kings, though now they be unhappy people,
and that of right to them does belong this government that we now guide, if
they setting aside all sinister hate, will come and friendly again repossesse
this Crown and kingdom, and with mutual love strive to maintain that, which
with their envious emulation they now massacre and maime, then on our shoulders
will we bear their burdens, and with according strength help them to stay
this tottering state, which their deeds have almost brought to decay: but if
incensed with the fire of furious flaming envy, they will not work their
thoughts conformable to this thing, but with fire and sword will needs lay
waste this sometimes worthy Commonwealth, then will we oppose our selves
against their threats, and seek such a mends for this mischief, as shall with
just judgment pull down their puffed up plumes, and turn them out again
into the wide world to become a worser skorne of mischance. With this answer
the messengers departing: and having told at home their several tales, it so
displeased the Princes, that presently without further delay they would the
next morning furiously with both their forces set upon the governors of their
country, and when they had conquered them, then be take themselves to strive
whether should be sole conqueror. Word whereof being speedily brought to the
Senators, they against ye next morning gins prepare all their power, and
pitching their battle upon the bosom of a broad plain that lay betwixt the
enemies leaguers, made offer to fight with them both at once. Which when the
enemies saw, they as ready to take the occasion as the other to offer, gins
furiously to set upon them, where joining straight at handie strokes, there
followed a long and furious fight, the victory to neither part declining, till
at last Adrianus that then had the charge of a Cornet of horse, breaking into
the bowels of the enemies battles, wrought such wonderful atchiuements, as
made him justly accounted for the best approved soldier that that country did
ever contain, with whose worth the foes were so disco^fited, that on a sudden
affrighted they betook themselves to flight, whom he eagerly following
ouertooke the two Kings, that by chance had met in the battle, eagerly
occupying their seete to escape y^ scourge of their enemies hands, whom he
surprising brought back again to their homes, and presented them to the
Senate as the first fruits of his fortune. Where by this time were gathered
together the most of those governors, to gratulate their forward friends that
were returned safe from the fight, who wondering at his worth, could not
sufficiently commend his courage: but consulting now with themselves what were
best to be done in this dangerous business.

How after that these two Kings were overcome, Adrianus was chosen king of that
country, and how he came to know his father and mother, by which the former
falsehood was descried. CHAP. 9.
AT last they thought it best, that since these two balefull brethren did even
in their captivity still deny to take upon them the mutual government of that
kingdom, intended for their after quiet to choose some one of these worthies
yt had there wrought their release. And for that they would not incur the
displeasure of any of those coequall Captains, that had so bravely demeaned
themselves, a motion was made amongst them, that for so much as there was no
lineall succession left for the inheritance of their kingdom, they then had
thus determined to cast lots amongst them all so to choose their King: which
fell upon Adrianus, of whom they were as glad as his own hap was good, who
with every several ceremony belonging to the coronation of such a King
established in that country, he first recals from their banishment all those
Outlawes by whom he was brought thither, and preferring of his friend and
sometimes his Captain, to a place of great authority in his kingdom, taught
him to employ his wit in the building of that Commonwealth up again, the
which before he labored to pull down. This Captain we told you before had by
Liuia his wife a fair daughter named Laryna, to whom Adrianus in the time of
his abode in her fathers house had oftentimes made love, and she with like
favor requited him, who but for the sudden sound of these new wrought wars,
had by the consent of their parents before inioyed the pleasure they both so
instantly desired, who then coming to the Court with her mother, the two
captive Queens, and the rest of their retinue, was presently by the consent of
the Senate, who desired nothing more then some issuing heirs that might
successively follow in the possession of this kingdom, coupled in marriage
with this new King. After which joyful day, the King and the Queen, with the
rest of the Nobles gathered together, calls in those captive brethren to know
the cause whence grew their discord, and the two women to inquire of them what
had been the manner of their former lives. Where when they were all met, the
old Queens seeing their husbands there fast in fetters, touched with a remorce
of conscionce, falls down before them, and there confessed the whole course of
their lives, and the murdering of their children. By the circumstances of
whose tale and the time thereof, these two lost children there found out their
several parents: and so faults on both sides forgiven, and injuries on every
part made even, they spent the rest of their days in solemn contrition for
their former faults.
