IMPRINTED AT London by Henry Sutton for Edward Sutton, dvvellyng in Lumbarde
street, at the sign of the Cradell.

A SECOND DECLARATION OF THE PRINCE of Conde to make known the causers of the
troubles which are at this day in this realm, and the duty wherein he has
and yet puts himself in at this present for the pacifieng of the same.
ALTHOUGH the prince of Conde have by good proof sufficiently enough declared
not alonely the great zeal and devotion which he has to ye service of ye king
and queen, with the full obedience he bears to their majesty's: but also ye
singular affection he has to ye quiet and wealth of this realm, chiefly
herein, that not long sens he has deferred even to the uttermost extremity
and need, to put armor upon him, for to resyst the violence of these, who
yet being full of blood and threats, have sent for and assembled people on
every side: having armed them selves against their majesty's commandments,
and did with force enter Paris. Where at that time the said Prince was, who had
never the less long before perfect understanding of their ententes and
purposes. And after that, having no respect either to the degree he is of in
this Realm, neither yet to this, that he was not the first that armed him
self, was yet contented simply at the queen's commandment to depart the said
town with his train, and repair to his house mynding forthwith to break up
his company, upon trust that the others should do the same: The which all
contrary remained at the said Paris some days, and there renforced them
selves: And after they had there done sundry gorgeous acts, went with all
their force where their majesty's were, whom they have enuironned therewith,
and thereby brought their bodies and wills into a captivity.

Nevertheless the said prince who having nothing derer unto him than ye public
tranquillity, has always ben most wylling to submit him self to such
reasonable conditions of layeng down that weapon which he for most just
considerations so nedefully took in hand: That all they eue^ very those whom
the other side has dispatched unto him on the behalf of the King and Queen,
have always said, that whosoever should refuse the conditions that he offered,
should be in a great wrong Whereof at this present, the said prince neither
makes mention nor recital, because the same have been already declared in his
former declaration. And fearing least his reasons and answers, that ^ithe the
offer of his conditions he has made touching that message which was sent unto
him and persuaded him on the behalf of the queen at the desire of those
others, have not been faithefully reported unto her majesty: or else that these
who have power about her, might ^appilye disguise the same, to make right
appear on their side: whereby they might nourishe and continue this trouble,
preferryng their particular faccions before the conservation and quietness of
this estate: The said Prince would by no means omytt the putting of the same
into writing, to the(...)de they might be truly understand of their
majesty's, published through all christendom and known to all the princes,
potentates, allies, friends and confederates to this crown, and to all the
courses of parliamentes of this realm, who^ the said prince requires (but
chiefly the parlyament of Paris) to the which he has of late sent his former
declaration, to enregester the same with this his second also, to the end he
may hereafter render the better account of these his doings, by a most
certain and perpetual witness unto his prince, when he shall come to the age
of judgment between the fault or service that he shall have done him in this
his minority. The said Prince so much assuring him self of the so rare
integrity of that notable company so well esteemed of the whole world, that
it will examine and way all things with the balance of justice reason and
equity without inclinyng to any passion or affection of any particular party.

AND first and foremost to begin with all they are not able nor may lay unto the
princes charge either to have begun the trouble which at this day is in this
realm, either to have been the cause or continuance thereof: in as much as it is
manifest, he was not the first that put on armor. And for that he took
weapon after them, which armed themselves against the king and queen's
commandment: he had therein just occasion, and such as by nature belo^ged unto
him: to wete the defense of his prince to the vtmoste of his power, the
subjects likewise of his majesty, and himself from violence. In as much also
as syns that time he has always submytted him self to the laying down of
weapon under reasonable condytions, such as might tend to a good and sure
peace for either party, and the liberty of the king and queen. Whereby men may
easily know that these be thonly causes which have rejected the said conditions
(who not being able to suffer the rule of the Queen which governed without
force or violence keepyng each manne in quiet, and lookyng carefully for
payement of the king her sons debtes, have armed them selves, have entered
the court, have passed even to the kings chaumber with their force contrary to
his commandment to dispose of this realm at their pleasure, have made
slaughter of his majesty's subjects, who lived under the sufferaunce of his
Edictes: And consequently have put all France in an uproar, even than when it
grew toward great quietenesse, chiefly for the matter of religion, wherein
either party deemed much cause of contentation.

And without taryeng only upon this which men see at this present, if they
would enter a little further into the matter, and consider the humors and
doings that have paste each manne from time to time, and look yet further
before them, who they be that have heretofore raised and maynteyned the troubles
sprung in this realm: They shall find that even those, who of late have begun
to put on armor and styrred up this Civil war, have almost from their
birth up, conspired to trouble the commune quiet of this kyngedome, and that
restfulnesse whereof they be thennemies, because it is contrary to the mark
they shoot at, and cuttes away the mean of their ambicion, who think them
selves in prison, and never in good order, but when there is occasions of
changes and enterprises. And without any mention making, concerning this matter
of a judgment which king Frauncis the.i. that great and wise king made of
them, neither yet of sundry other particularities of their doings. Who knows
not the self same men because they could not away with the benefyte of a
commune quiet were the cause of breach of that honorable and most
profitable Truce made between king Henry lastly departed, the Emperor Charles,
and the Spanyshe king? (whereby not only we feel the smarte, but all our
posterity shall feel the same. They putting by this means al Europe in
trouble and confusion, and all France in ruin, that they mights thereby come
to their ends and intentes well enough understood? And who when they had
ones embraced the handlynge of matters and the money, after the journey of saint
Laurence, when sundry greefes one after an other had happened by reason of that
overthrow, began by times to make such unquietness in this realm, as the
said king Henry departed, who was not able to suffer any more such violent
sprights about him, determined to send them home to their houses, had he not
ben prevented by death.

After that during the reign of king Francis the second of that name, when
these stranger governors had contrary to all right, yea against the laws and
customs of France, usurped unto them selves the whole gouernemente, was not
this poor realm in troubles and in arms? Did they not in the sight of every
man flesh the said young king upon his own prepre subjects (who yet otherwise
was both good and virtuous of himself) and have they not done what in them lay
to defile his memory and cronicle with their excedyng cruelties? Did they not
cause him to arm him self and make a camp in the mids of his realm
against his own servants with so horrible a show of myserye and heaviness
through all his realm, that every manne yet does abhor to talk thereof, and
bring it thereby to remembrance? And to make an end of this their Tragedye:
have not all men seen after the death of the said king Frauncis when their
violente rule ceased: the Queen and the king of Navarre, by one consent and
correspondence to have ruled together all this estate peasybly and with all
Justice and clemency, thirtene whole months? till such time as their
ambition (which will never suffer them to keep in, and live in rest) had
styrred them up, and pusht them forewardes with their good agentes and
ministers to trouble heaven and earth, as all men may see, and that to the
great sorrow of the said prince who doubts not but all persons of good and
sound judgment, do right well know those that have been the occasion of
beginning, maintaynyng, and continuyng the troublyng of this realm: Whereby men
can not without slander, charge them, that have always by good proof showed
them selves as well the shunners of such means and inventions, as also of
those honors and riches which contrary wise these others have obtained, by
such gaye means as is most evident.

Secondarily, so little ought men to marvel, if the said prince in this
case work surely with those that have the King and Queen at this day in their
possession, that rather men might think it a great folly in him, if he should
otherwise use the matter, and should so far forgette himself, as to putt him
to their mercy, remembering the strange manner of dealing, wherewith he was
entreated by them not long ago, when through their taken on authority they
commanded all in this realm. In as much also as it is most certain, the
mark they shoot at, tends to none other end, than to the whole ruin of
the more part of the nobility, and of all other estates what soever, that
make profession of the reformed Religion, chiefly that, of the prince and al
his company. Which thing is most evidently to be wytnessed by the very
mouths of the duke of Guyse, and the Constable themselves, and by such talk
as they held in the full court of the parliament of Paris, using these propre
terms, That first of all, they must begin with Paris, and that afterward
they would well enough rule the rest, and so would deal, that men should know of
what religion each man was, chiefly such as had any authority, and that the
principal meaning of the king was, to depart the company that was at Orleance
and after that he would not have his hands tied up. But in as much as it has
lain in the power of some, through their particular affections, to break a
law so solemnly made, as was the Edict of January last past, whereby all this
Realm grew to a quietness: And further that which of late was resolved on
upon a saturday not long sens in full council, which was, that the said Edict
should be published without any exception or restraint of the town of Paris,
and that precinct: if this I say were broken and violated and the restraint
for Paris passed in the court of parliament by their practices and thorough
thautoritie they take upon them: men may thereby easily perceive how the
queen is obe^ed, What power she is of, and how their wylles, passions and
particular affections ar above her pleasure, and the determination of the
council: and it is likewise easy to judge by all their sayings and doyngs
that as spedely as they may they will cause the whole realm to do as they
have begun with Paris and that liberty or baylywick: and so consequently there
is no trust nor assurance to be had to their letters of proclamation, as may
very well be witnessed by the cry, that since that time was made the xx. of
this monthe, in the four quarters or qua^^foulx of Paris for the calling
together of all the gentlemen of this realm to go fight against and punish
the sedicious and new christians* and here it has no likelyhode of truth to
say that the people of Paris could never have endured the edict, nor have
submitted themselves thereunto. For every man saw three months together,
first the prince de la roche sur Yon, and afterward the marshall Montmerency
with only x. or xii. harque busiers, so to have kept in order ye whole people
there, as there was no word nor question of brawling the one with the other.
which thing peasably endured till the coming of the said Duke of Guise to
Paris. Wheruppon it is good is mark that when toward the end, the said
marshals band was increased and made stronger with certain horsemen and
footmen, to let such metinges as men saw were appointed purposelye to
stir up the people: it was then persuaded by the provost of the merchants,
and by those of the town, yt it was not needful to keep such a force there,
which served to none other purpose, tha^ to grieve the people, whom it was easy
without any such number, to keep in order: and yet notwithstanding since the
coming of the said Duke of Guise, the said people have so changed their
humor and it has been so hard a matter to keep them in (as these men at least
would make us believe) that of necessity they must levy such nombres of
enseignes of foot men, as men have seen, and that without making the Queen
privy thereto, yea and against her pleasure also. Lastly the said Prince
knows it to be the work of God, that the said Duke of Guise and Constable,
have not been able in public and in so great a company to dissemble their
meaning, and that they have no more said than they think for: a matter surely
that much confirms such talk as is ordinary among their familiers and
household servants, which also has been well known by an infinite number of
letters taken up by the way: that is, that they desire no more than to dissolve
the company at Orleance, as they may afterward do execution as well on the
great as the small, according to their long devised meaning. Whervppon they
make oftentimes such slaughters and cruelties as of late has been exercised in
Paris as well in the presence of the said Constable and under his private
authority, as also such as are daily committed in sundry places against
those of the reformed Religion, namely that horrible and detestable murder
made at Sens, an archebyshoprike appertaynynge to the Cardinal of Guyse,
which had never come to pass without this their new enterprise, and the
auowed example that these men have given. Of which calamity with all other
desolations that France is thretned withal, the fault can not be imputed to
other than them selves only. And concerning that message, which the Queen
sent unto the said Prince, to wete: That he should unarm himself upon her
word and affiaunce, that he should come to the court, where he should be
well received, and that further she would by writing, make him all such
assurance as him self would: The said Prince gives to understand, yt he
has none other desire than to obey the will and pleasure of that good Lady,
and to see every man in quiet: but he right well understands, that those
dispatches and all others are at this day at thonly appetite of thabouesaid,
and can not perceive that her majesty (how good will soever she have) can make
him any surety, so long as she remains in their powers, and while they shall
abide about the king and her. For what mean has she to resist them, or any
enterprise they shall attempt, being enuironned with their force and armor
which they themselves have levied and assembled, and which they have presumed
to bring into the kings house and chamber against his pleasure, and express
inhibition? As litell surety is it also to say, the king of Navarre (whom the
said Prince and al those of his company, do acknowledge next after the king
and queen) shall only have the force of the Kings Lieutenant general, if a
man mark their enterprise of possessyng him, and the abusyng of his goodness.
Withal it is not to be douted, but that the force and people which they have
assembled (in whose hand so ever they shall come) will be at their devotion,
and will be obedient to their wills and intentes. Whereby they shall alwais
be able to serve them selves with them against the will and pleasure of the
said queen and king of Navarre, yea against their persons when so ever they
will, as they have right well already made that to be known unto that good Lady,
and the aforesaid king wha^ they had power, authority and mean to hurt within
their rule (whereof if it would please them but a little to think on) they should
find that thonly goodness of God has hitherto preserved them. To be short,
the said prince can not with reason see any other surety than their withdrawing
from the court. And first of all the full liberty of ye queen, assuring himself
yt as often as there shall remain presentely any other force in this realm
(chiefly at this time of an universal peace, tha^ thordinarie guard of the king
with ye frontier places accustomed, it can not be (consydering their dealings
and councels sufficiently discovered) but the same is to do some forcible and
violent execution: for he doubts not but as they have presumed to assemble
their said force, so will they as little fear to employ them for the bringing
to pass of their purpose. which thng makes those that must keep them selves
from such snares, not over hastyly to believe words, unless some good proves
did ensue, which they see euidentely to be all contrary. For it appears,
that the abouesayde utter all tokens of stomach and ennemit^e that they can
deuyse, against the said Prince and these of his company, whom they proclayme
thorough out all the world rebels, and thennemies of the king. They make
prouisyons for their chief houses, they threatten them with no less than
life, they cause many false brutes and slanders to be sown against the deeds
of the said Prince, they do moreover make leuies of footmen, as well within
as without the Realm, they practice with strangers and ambassadors, partly
under the name of the king and queen, and partly without the knowledge of any
their majesty's. They make no difficulty in causyng the king to arm him self
against those of his Subjects, of whom he was before their gay enterprise and
arriual, obeyed faithfully and wyllyngely, and so shall always be to their
last. And for this purpose cause his Majesty to enter into a charge that
evil comes to pass, they think it good to bestow the money appointed for
his debts (which yet be such as each man knows) upon the driuyng out and
destroyeng of the more part of his nobility and all other estates, which is,
as though a man would cut of his own arms and legs, and would make an end
of the ruinyng of this realm, which by their goodly council, conduict and
government, is brought to the state that all men see. Finally, these wise
heads of this realm care not to lay out this land to the pray, deuisyng with
them selves how to bring in strangers, and to withdraw the bands and most
notable soldiers from the places of most importance, as namely Caleys and
Mets, unto the which it is not to be douted, but our ennemies look narowly
enough. And all this to serve their private passion, likyng better to follow the
course of their ambition, and comme to to their appointed end what ever it
cost, yea were it with ye loss of al ye realm, tha^ to fail any whit of their
intent. What surety tha^ would a man look ye prince should find having such
demo^stratio^s and effects of their most wicked wills and meanings?

As touching the persuasion used to the prince wherein it is said, yt he ought
to for get his particular profit for ye common: he thinks yt were fitter to be
persuaded unto the^, who having first and most grievously fauted hole on so
welfauoredly that they had rather see a great part of the realm perish than
(for the co^seruation thereof, and to give surety to those that have occasion
to seek it) they would once stir from the court, where as yet there is no good
subject that had not rather choose to absent him self thens all his life for to
redeem such an inconvenient than to see (thorough his presence) his country
in danger, and his king anoyed. But to color their obstinate will in biding at
the court they allege their offices and estates, saying yt for so much as they
be officers unto the croune, no man ought nor can cause them ^o withdraw
themselves from about ye kings person, being specially in his minority. Nay
they have been so lofty as they have not let to say, that the king in his under
age had none authority to cause them to depart as though the queen did not
supply the tender age of the king: yea and have thought it more mete by
reason of their callyngs to tarry still at the court to disobey and trouble the
state than by their departing to leave good example, to give authority unto
the kings commandment, and to allow the government of the Queen, wherein
they lack all good and just ground if they would well wey the present necessity
and occasion. For it is most certain they never had rule given the^ over their
charges, to employe them at their pleasure, nor to unquiet the realm, by
transgressyng the laws, armyng themselves not only without the kings
commandemente, but against his pleasure, nor to do such violences, but to
mainteyn the land in peace and quietenesse, as it was before their coming, and
before they put on armoure by their own commyssion, abusing their charges,
and presuming more than at any time durst any of the propre brethern of any of
our kings, who yet though they returned from the battle, durst never enter
the court, but they were first disarmed. Now forasmuch as through their arriual
and presence at the court together, with their goodly behauior, they se they
have made such a stir as thereby they have set all France in trouble and
fire, and have moved a Civil war, and that contrarywyse thonely atonement
and quiet of this land depends upon their withdrawyng from the court, in
as much as the said prince can see no another mean neither for the common
surety, nor for the liberty of the king and Queen. And that for his part he
is resolved never to commytte himself to their mercy (as no man would think
it reasonable he should) it is most certain, that if they be good and
loving servants and officers to this croune, they will in this case forget
all particularitie: In as much as the said prince also, who is not only an
officer and servant, but has this honor to be accounted a kynsemanne, and is
issued of the house and bloudde: who by this occasyon has greatter pryuiledge
and right to tarry about his majesty. besides this also that he was not the
first in arms: And that contrariwise the other side have nothing satisfied the
request of the estates as they be bound before they should be admitted of the
kings council does notwtstanding offer to wtdraw him self into his house and
government, and likewise to procure that all the other lords and officers of
the croune which be in his company shall do the like. Whereunto if the
abouesaid do not condescend, The said prince assures himself that there is
no man onelesse he be to much passionate, but will think that it is not he,
but only they that profer the private before the public cause.

Now if those good officers of the croun shall not content themselves with
this reasonable offer, and will needs urge examples, they must than in spite of
their bearde confess this mean offered to be reasonable expedient and
acustomed, in as much as it is the same way which me^ know by a number of
examples past, yt our predecessors kings have followed, who when there arose
any such controversy between ye princes their subjects as y^ thereby they took
arms ye one prince against the other of their private authority: by and by they
were commanded to lay down weapon on either side, and to wtdraw themselves into
their houses, yt afterward they might come and give account of their doings,
and their controversies and reasons to be heard when they should be called
thereunto. At the least if against all reason and custom they have determined
to suffer those at the court, which are but offcers of the croune withal the
force they have assembled of their own private authority: They can not then
deny, but that they shall do an evident wrong unto the said prince (who has
this honor to belong to the king, and who did not first arm himself but put
them on after the other for none other purpose tha^ to keep their majesty's,
and himself from violence) if he may not have the like privilege to be at
the court with those of his band who owe as well their oath to the king as the
others, and who he will assure of his honor and life, to be the most faithful
and obedient servants and subjects of his majesty (as they both have and
hereafter will make it right well to be seen) And than being there they may
receive the king of Nauars commandments as the kings lieuetenant general,
and assist him as well as the others, and withal help him to maintain the
liberty and authority of the king and Queen with all their power, for whose
service they are ready to bestow their bodies and goods to the last penny and
uttermost breath. But if it happen that ye abouesaid will not suffer the queen to
use this equality most reasonable without it may appear that there is more
partiality toward the one tha^ ye other (although in deed if there be any
affection born, ye same were chiefly due to ye prince, who has this honor to be
of ye blood) and yt for ye meting with so present a desolatio^ the said lady do
not with so just a cause otherwise e^termedle her auctoriti tha^ hitherto she
has, me^ cannot sai yt there has lacked any good will in her to do the same,
being so wise and virtuous a lady as she is, and one that so coueteth ye
greatness of her sun and the preservation of his estate and surety, that she
would not spare any person in a matter of such importance and that threateneth
so great a ruin: but yet they will put them selves out of all doubt, that it
is the fear she has of them, who keep their force continually about her, and
will not suffer her to do a thing so needful, which thing they have
sufficient prove enough of that her majesty is brought into such terms yt she
leaves to do sundry things, and passes a mayny against her pleasure, as it
may right well appear by the new election of those which have lately ben called
to ye privy council: which men right well know to have been chosen to make
up a number, and to keep the said Lady in subjection under pretense of a
council: For men do otherwise sufficiently enough understand the said lady to
be very choice in admitting any person to the degree of a counceler. Men do
also know the small respect these persons have toward her, which at this time
make their councels to gether aparte, and afterward cause her to set forth
those things themselves have agreed on: they send out the dispatches, and
after tell her the matter: they force the court of parliament to pass at
their pleasure, whatsoever they enterprise, and what so seems good to them
manifestly showing to have more credit and authority therein than ever the king
and queen could have. To be short, who is he that will not think it at this
present more than meet, that the said lady should take upon her again her
authority without being any longer thus compassed with these men of war, and
that the above named do withdraw themselves with all their force, for the
remeuyng of that fear and suspicion that they have (not without occasion)
given to so many and withal to remedy those miseries, wherewith this state is
threatened: and this the rather because the said prince being assured of his
company, who be of the best servant of this croune, and others with him of
all other estates, are determined once for all, to prove their fortune, and to
bestow their lives even to the last drop of their blood, rather thanne to
see the force of this realm in the hands of such as it nothing beelongeth
unto, who have abused the same before time with so great loss of the kings
subjects, and now of late have made such boucheries and oultrages against
those of that religion, which the Prince is of, without any regard had to
the kings decrees, that at the least he will be well ware while he lives how
he shall commit him self to their mercy, wherewith he has before time found
himself evil apayd.

And for the remeuing of all such slanders and complaints as the abouesaide
cause to be made against the said prince (chiefly this which they greatly set
forwards) that he and those of his company arest and open the pacquets of ye
king: he heartily wishes men would understand that he has alwais born such a
reuere^c^ and will do all his life, to that which belongs unto his majesty:
As he has from the beginning expressly forbidden any man to lay hands on the
kings, the Queen's or the King of Nauarres letters. True it is that the same
has not been observed, (as also it were not reasonable) with the pacquets of
the other particulers which have both ben stayed and opened: In the which
men have seen a world of iniquitye of untrue reports, slanders, false
Brutes, practices, pourposes, and enterpryses incredible, all contrary to that
goodlye talk of suretye, wherewyth they dayelye feed the said Pryrnce, who
no whytte repents him of that he has done, neither would for this respect
the thing should have been otherwise used. In as much as thereby he has
the more depely known their cankred wills.

Touching the breakyng down of images committed at Tours and Blois, the said
prince and those of his company have benmuch offended therewith, in such sort as
he has sent word to the kings officers in the said tounes that he will help
the^ and assiste with strong hand to see those punished, in the example of
others that have committed that crime. His behauior that he has used, in this
town of Orleans with the commendation of all ecclesiastical persons and the
publyke thanks given him by all sorts of men here, and other estates do
right well witness the good order of his life, with that modesty and
myldenesse which both he, and all his company have, and do use, without
any blasphemy, without any rigor, wrong, or violence offered to any person,
or transgressyng the Edict of January last paste. And even now of late, upon
the breakyng of an Image, he has caused those that stand charged therewith,
to be putt into the hands of Justice to be punysshed out of hand. And as
concerning the complaynte made against such tounes as the inhabitauntes them
selves keep and are seized and assured of, the meaning is none other thanne
the service of the King and Queen, and to let those who abuse the
authority of their majesty, and compass them about with arms, from the
possession of them, whereby they might force the same to serve their tournes
and particular passions. For as soon as the said lady shall be restored to
that former liberty which she enjoyed two months paste, she shall well
understand the said tounes to remain in the like obedience and subjection
that before time they have done, and will do for ever: and that they will
give place to none in all this Realm in their fydelitie toward their
Majesty's: And least of all, to them, whom they have known a long while since
to have practiced the beginning and maintenance of this civil wars, under
the pretense of religion even with particular promise to furnishe money to that
intent.

As touching the rest, the said Prince, and all his company, are so far
from layeng under foot, and keeping in silence that which has passed in
this matter (which thing yet he has been persuaded to do, and that he
should also without any doubt or dread, speedyly comme to the Court, that
rather they will make a memorial thereof for ever, and paynte it (...)
Tables, write it in Letters of gold, make it be proclaimed and cried loud,
thorough all Christendom of the duty and fidelytie they, to so good purpose,
have yealden to their king, (a Prince laid abroad in this his tender age, to
all injury and violence) to make thereof an examuple and a perpetual
testimony of the manner, wherewith the said Prince and the nobilytie of France
were so readily, in so good number, and so with one accord assembled together,
for the surety and liberty of their Lord, and for the preservation of his
person, and estate. Neither can the said prince think, that hereafter
there may be offrred unto him a more goodlye and woorthye to be thought on
occasion to do his majesty service, neither a better or worthier mean to
pourchase unto him self true honor and praise. At the least he hope the to
obtain the favor of God, and of his prince, for this faicte when he shall
attain to that age, wherein he shall be able to judge, know, and understand
this act, of true and faithful affection, which his Subjects have borne him
at this time.

THESE things considered, the said Prince who has done all duty to
pacifye this trouble, which seems to tend to none other end than to a
manyfeste ruin and subuersyon of this state: Who has also submytted himself
to all the reasonable conditions that in him lie, to lay down al weapon as
well on the one side as the other, without having regard to any thing, other
than the liberty of the King and Queen: And the common surety which he has
good cause to seek, does again protest, before the King and Queen, and all the
courts of parliament, with all the estates of this Realm, that of the
mischiefs, miseries and desolations that may hereafter come to pass, the
fault thereof ought to be imputed to those that be the aucthors and thonely
cause, who have determined rather to trouble all this state, by taryenge in
court, and in the counsel (where as yet they neither can nor ought remain,
neither be admytted) if they would follow the request of the estates) till
such time as they had satisfied them) than by departing thence to leave there
a common quiet and rest.

The said prince further requires all the said courts of parliament, all
the tounes and communaltes of this realm that they will diligently way all
the abouesayde, and to do all the duetye they owe and that shall be possible
unto them to do for the service of the king, the suretye of his person and
state, and to maynetayne the auctoritye and rule of the Queen: to the end
they may hereafter render so good a compte, and sufficient witness of their
doings in this present necessity (as the said prince also myndeth to do of
his unto the king being comme to the age of commaundyng by him self) that his
majesty may have occasyon rather to praise them, esteem them and thancke
them, than to blame them for their lack of duty, or for the to much following
their passions for flatering or gratyfieng any particular persons, who would at
this time rather color, autorise and make ratified their fautes than look to
the conservation of his estate.

Further the said prince heartily beesecheth all the good and laufull subjects
of this croune to lend him aid, favor and assistence in a cause so good and
just: calling GOD to witness, that only the grief he has to see the
King and Queen so unworthily handeled by their own proper subjects, and
compassed with their force and arms, otherwise than ever before this time has
been seen in this realm, and the desire to maintain the honor of God, the
government of the said laid together with the conseruacion of this estate,
and the more part of the kings good subjects, have constrained him to set
him self against their violence. Which thing at the least ways hitherto
has so prevailed that as yet they never durst execute their enterprises
sufficientlye enough discovered, which surely would have brought her said
majesty in such extremity and thraldom as of long time no Queen has been
seen, and the most part of the said subjects of the king in most pityfull
estate and grievous oppression. He thanketh almightye GOD greatly, that it
has pleased him of his infinite goodness and providence to put into his hand
the mean to resist them hitherto, which he trusts and assures him self he
will give him the grace to being to a good and happy end for his service sake
and that of both their said majesty's

Lois de Burbon.
