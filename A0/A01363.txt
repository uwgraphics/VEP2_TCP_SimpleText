A Supplication to Eldertonne, for Leaches vnlewdnes:
Desiring him to pardone, his manifest vnrudenes.

GOod gentle master Eldertonne,
may I not you intrete?
To pardon Leache yt he has do^ne,
and not with him to frete?
For I confess and know the same,
It was for lack of lewdnes:
That he so blasde abroad your name,
therefore forgive his rudenes.
For you may see he is in deed,
an vnrude simple man:
Therefore of him take you no heed,
sith nurture none he can.
A seely simple man he is,
as proof may well be made:
For no more wit he has ywis,
but to call a spade, a spade.
Therefore though that your filthy rymes,
he filthy name to be:
Accuse him not I say of crimes,
you hear his quality.
It was no doubt vnhomely done,
to challenge in such case:
So fine a fellow as Eldertonne,
that has so fair a face.
But though your face be never so rich,
so precious or so gay:
Yet will he scratche it if it itche,
the pains for to delay.
Wherefore you ought him thanks to give,
that works you such good:
And not to shake him by the sleeue,
to wreke your angry mood.
I may well muse and meruel much,
what might be your intent:
Since that you prove your self one such,
as truth cannot content.
You show that Leache you do contemn,
even by the self same reed:
Wherein you do your self condemn,
I wish you would take heed.
You bind it up with oaths inow,
in faith, in faith, say ye:
But by such fruits a man may know,
the goodness of the tree.
A shame it is that you should bring,
the rample of Christ I say:
And eke forthwith the self same thing,
so sore to disobey.
For with the breach of charity,
you do him sharply charge:
And by and by outragiously,
you rail on him at large.
Thus Satan also for his turn,
the scriptures can out pike:
And as you well his lesson learn,
so are your deeds a like.
Your heart is vain and bent to evil,
your tongue also is naught:
How can it be then but the devil,
must rule both tongue and thought.
But hereby men may easily spy,
how you do Leache abuse:
Since that your quarrel for to try,
by scripture you refuse.
Therefore you go about I see,
the scripture set aparte:
Unto your toies and vanity,
his pen for to conuart.
And if in deed you could him cause,
from scripture for to fly:
No doubt for soth but clause by clause,
much bravery should we see.
Then would you leke then would you laffe,
as you do make report:
Then would you answer every staff,
and that in sugared sort.
In sugared sort? nay poisened then,
I might it better call:
Although it sugared semes to men,
which are in sinful thrall.
A worthy work it is doubtless,
and full of learned skill:
Whereby appears your shameless,
and wilful wicked will.
And where you write that secretly,
your fault he should have told;
That might not be since openly,
your self did it uphold.
And where as he full skilfully,
takes scriptures for his stay:
You say in deed that wickedly,
he uses them alwaie.
It is not straight way proved so,
when that you have it said:
Except you bring a proof thereto,
which cannot be denaid.
As if, that I should say in deed,
you were an honest man:
All wise men might me then deride,
since prove it not I can.
I would now wish you should forget,
his science to deface:
For honestly a man may get,
his living in that race.
Much better then the wit to spend,
a Parasite to play:
The bad to please, the good to offend,
and play the fool all day.
And him me thinks you should not blame,
that can well shape a hose:
For he may likewise cut and frame,
a case for your rich nose.
To make a hose is no such shame,
to Leache in his degree:
As is your nose a glorious fame,
upon your face to see.
It does become you very ill,
to talk so of your tail:
But you shall there your tongue hold still,
as fit for tounges that rail.
And if you still thus do deny,
your knauerie to forbear:
You shall therein have victory,
the garland you shall wear.
But here I must full sore lament,
the counsel you still give:
To your vile Jone, not to repent,
but beastly still to live.
O wicked man darste thou be bold,
such sinful seed to sow?
And eke the same for to uphold,
in sinful hearts to grow?
Oh Lord shall whoredom thus prevail?
shall men thus sin maintain?
Is this a christen common weal,
and can such filth sustain?
O magistrates play Phinehes part,
toward such be not to mild:
Which may procure most grievous smart,
to many a mothers child.
The whoredom of one heretofore,
Great plagues to many has brought:
Although the lord eftsoon therefore,
in him repentance wrought.
What shall our lot be then Oh Lord?
which foster such foul swine:
As live a life to be abhorde,
yet glory and joy therein?
Repent (O wretch) and call for grace,
leave of these wicked toys:
Lest Satan reach thee sower sauce,
to these thy pleasant joys.
Now sir, if Leache, as you do tell,
semes fondly things to knit:
It is because you cannot well,
them home with reason hit.
A homely cloak would serve full well,
is there none to be had?
If Eldertonne of none hear tell,
I doubt he will go mad.
But if as you do threaten, so
you fall for to be wood:
You shall straight ways to Bedlem go,
to tame your madding mood.
Now Eldertonne I must desire,
you to hold Leache excusde:
For that no reason does appear,
why he should so be used.
And since that I thus courteously,
for Leache do you entreat:
Your frenzy so to satisfy,
you need no more to freat.
Wherefore gentle Maiste Elderton,
as I may do you pleasure:
Grant this my supplication,
which is not out of measure.
And thus subscribed,
The first day of June:
At which time you said,
Begins your fume.
