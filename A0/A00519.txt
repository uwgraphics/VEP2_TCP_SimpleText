A Fools Bolt is soon shot.
Good Friends beware, I Am like to hit ye,
What ere you be here is that will fit ye;
Which way soever that you go,
At you I aim my Bolt and Bow.
To the Tune of, Oh no no no not yet.


STand wide my Masters, and take heed,
for fear the Fool does hit ye,
If that you think you shall be shot,
Id'e wish you hence to get ye;
My Bow you see stands ready bent,
to give each one their lot,
Then have amongst you with my Bolts,
for now I make a shot.
He that does take delight in Law,
and ever to be brangling,
Would he like to the Bells were hanged,
that loves still to be iangling;
His Lawyers purse he fills with Coin,
himself has nothing got,
And proves a beggar at the last,
at him I make a shot.
Who all the week does work full hard,
and moyle both night and day,
Will in a trice spend all his coin,
and fool his means away,
In drinking and in rioting,
at pipe and at the pot,
Whose brains are like an adled egg,
at him I make a shot.
The Prodigal that is left rich,
that wastes his state away,
In wantones and surfeting,
in gaming and in play,
And spends his means on Whores and Qeanes,
does make himself a sot,
May in a Spittle chance to dye,
at him I make a shot.
He that is apt to come in bands
for every common friend,
May shake a beggar by the hand,
and pay the debt in the end,
By selling Goods and Lands away,
or in a Prison rot,
Where none will pity his poor case,
at him I make a shot.
The Man that wedds for greedy wealth,
he goes a fishing fair,
But often times he gets a Frog,
or very little share;
And he that is both young and free,
and marries an old Trot,
When he might live at liberty,
at him I make a shot.
The Second Part.
To the same Tune.


THe Miser that gets wealth great store,
and wretc^edly does live,
In's life is like to starve himself,
at's death he all does give
Unto some Prodigal, or Fool,
that spends all he has got,
With griping usury and pain,
at him I make a shot.
He that does early rise each morn,
and works hard all day,
When he comes home can not come in,
his Wife is gone to play;
And lets her to drink and spend all
the moneys which he got,
Shall wear my Coxcombe and my Bell,
and at him heers a shot.
An Old Man for to dote in age
upon a Wench that's young,
Who has a nimble wit and eye,
with them a pleasing tongue,
Acteons plume I greatly fear
will fall unto his lot,
That stoutely in his crest he will bear,
at him I make a shot.
A Widow that is richly left,
that will be Ladifide,
And to some Gull or Roaring-boy
she must be made a Bride,
His Clothes at Broakers he has hired
himself not worth a groat,
That basts her hide and spends her means
at her I make a shot.
A Maiden that is fair, and rich,
and young, yet is so proud,
That ^auour unto honest men
by no means can be lowed;
And thus she spends her chiefest prime,
refusing her good lot,
In youth does scorn in age is scornd,
at her I make a shot.
But she that wanton is and fond,
that fast and loose will play,
When that her reconings are cast up,
must for it soundly pay,
And may the Father chance to seek
of that which she has got,
Besides her standing in a sheet,
at her I make a s^^t.
Who spends his time in youth away,
to be a Seruing-man,
Dotd seldom grow for to be rich,
do he the best he can;
And then when age does come, God knows
this Man has nothing got,
But is turned out amongst the dogs,
at him I make a shot.
He that does sell his Lands away,
an Office for to buy,
May keep a quarter for a time,
but will a beggar dye;
For he has sold his Lambs good man,
and younger Sheep has got,
Although he think himself so wise,
at him I make a shot.
He that will go unto the Sea,
and may live well on shore,
Although he venture life and goods,
may hap to come home poor,
Or by the Foe be made a Slave,
with all that he has got,
Whose Limbs in pieces are all torn,
at him I make a shot.
Those that their Parents do reject,
and makes of them a scorn,
Who wishes then with grief and woe
they never had been borne;
For portion they may Twelue-pence have
beside a heavy lot,
For disobedience ordaind,
at them I make a shot.
The Parents which their Child brings up
to have their own free will,
The wise and ancient Solomon
does say they them will spill:
And when correction comes too late,
they wish they would nere been got:
But for their folly which is past,
at them I make a shot.
They that continue still in sin,
and think they nere shall dye,
Deferring off repentance still,
and lives in iollitie,
Death quickly comes and ceases them,
and then it is their lot
In hells hot flame for to remain,
at them I make a shot.
And so farewell my Masters all,
God send's a merry meeting;
Pray be not angry with the Fool
that thus to you sends greeting:
And if that any have (...)
and says I did not hit them,
It is because my Bolts are spent,
but I Will have more to fit them.
FINIS.
