Further News of Ostend.
Wherein is declared such accidents as have happened since the former Edition,
dilligently Collected out of sundry Letters and aduertisments, as have been
from Zeland, Callice, and other places, lately received.
IT has been declared in the former Book, Entitled, The Oppugnation of
Ostend, that this Town has heretofore diverse times been attempted and
beseeged by the common enemy, but (Gods name be praised therefore) all was in
vain, first it was besieged by the Prince of Parma, in the year of our Lord
God 1583. then by Monsieur la Motte, Governor of Graueling, in the year of our
Lord God 1585, who were long before solicited and importunated thereunto by
the continual suit and exclamations of the Flemings, who forgot not to labor
and instigate the Duke of Burgundi also, ever since his coming into the low
Countries to this piece of work, specially in the year 1596. after he had
taken the strong Town of Callice, promising great sums of money toward the
same charge, and paying some part thereof into the Dukes treasury before hand.
But the duke knowing that others had attempted the same before him with ill
success, doubted the like might happen to himself, whereby the glory of his
former victories might be darkened: and therefore suffered the matter, at that
time, to sleep. Wherefore they of Flaunders (to avoid the incursions of the
soldiers of Ostend, and payment of contribution) took apportunitie of the
present time, whilst the States forces were employed at Bommel* in the year
of our Lord 1599, and made round about the Town sundry fortes and trenches for
the better assurance of the passages. Yet finding (since the making of them)
that the charges of those garrisons, and spoil made in all places of
Flaunders, by their own soldiers, did far exceed their former losses
sustained by their ennemies, have (with much more importunacie than at any time
before) solicited their Duke to entertain this their honorable suit,
promising (besides many other necessary services during the time of the
siege) to pay him thirty thousand pounds starling monthly toward his charges,
and afterward (if he took the Town) nine thousand pounds starling every
month for the space of two years next following. And while they made all
these gay and liberal promises, they forgate not to allege unto the Duke
also, that now, even at this present was the fittest time to take in hand this
most glorious enterprise, that had been offered these many years, and might
be accomplished by his Highness with much less difficulty, than by any other
Governor before him, and that therefore he ought in no wise to let slip so
fit opportunity, the like whereof, without all doubt, was not to be hoped
for in many years to come, and perhaps, not so long as he lived: for they
had certain intelligence, that the Town was slenderly furnished with
soldiers, and much worse with powder, shot, and ordonance, and no
victualles in the Town to serve those few soldiers eight days: and further
(which was the cheesest matter, and of greatest consequence among all other)
Grave Maurice with all the States forces was now before the Town of Bercke in
Dutchland, which his Highness had, with great foresight sufficiently
provided for, with more than a competent garrison, and al other necessaries
fit for the defense thereof, from whence the States forces, nor any part
thereof could be brought in so short a time, but that by a sudden attempt
against Ostend, he might, not only break, and make frustrate, the designs of
the ennemy before Bercke, who (without all question) would, in all haste,
raise his siege there, with imagination, to speed himself toward Flaunders)
and yet loose Ostend, before he should be able to come so far with his
forces, in any due time to succor the same.

And further added here unto, that he was sure of one advantage in this siege,
for that they of Ostend, neither had, nor could have any horse, to encounter
with his forces, and therefore his horsemen would so bridle the town, that
they should not once dare to issue out of the Gates, nor to offer skirmish, or
if they did, his horsemen would easily ouerrunne them, and cause them to retire.

The Duke not ignorant how commodious and honorable the taking of this Town
would be unto him, moved partly by these reasons, but especially by the want
of money to pacify the mutined soldiers of diverse places, and fearing the
greater likelihood of greater coffeehouse to happen among his other
soldiers and garrisons (with whom he was behind hand for above thirty months
pay) thought it sit for the present time, and most acceptable to his
subjects generally, to employ his soldiers in this half hopeless attempt,
where he might (not with money) but with his ennemies sword pay a great many
of these mutinous companions their wages, and preserve the rest from the like
danger.

And because such manner of payment may be the better understood, it shall not
be impertinent, to show briestly, the manner thereof used by the Priests,
Friars, and race of the most cursed and diabolical order of Jesuits, who for
the maintenance of their Romish Church, persuade the common soldiers (as they
do all others in their shriftes, and when they lie on their deathbeds) to
give liberally to the Church, to the end, that Praters and Dirges may be made,
and sung for their souls: such soldiers therefore as die, or are slain
before they go to any service, bequeathe their pay to one monaste^rie, church,
or other chapel, all which the Clergy gives to the King, or to their Duke,
for the maintenance of the wars: and if any soldiers bequeathe their pay to
their wives, and children or other friends, the same is never, or but very
seldom paid.

The Duke of Ossuna, being Gennerall of the Dukes army was presently sent
toward Ostend, and coming before it the fifth day of July stilo nouo, or
rather, the five and twenty day of June, as we write here in England, planted
his ordonance against the east end of the Town, and the next day began to
shoot and batter down the houses: whereupon Monsieur Vander Noote, Governor
of Ostend, gave present order, that many of the houses and buildings, should be
taken down and defaced, and the streets vnpaued, to the end that the enemies
shot might the less offend the people and soldiers within the walls: and
commanded also, that all the women and children should be sent out of the town
into Zeland.

The nine and twenty day were 28. companies of soldiers sent into the town
from Zeland, with great plenty of victualles, and all other munition, fit for
the defense of the Town. And the next day following, sir Francis Vere came to
Ostend with eight companies of English men, who presently entrenched himself
without the Town on the south side under the walls, which was the only place
and fittest piece of ground, from whence the enemy might, with his canon,
batter the walls, and has ever since kept the same in despite of all the
ennemies force, with eighteen or twenty companies, who daily have given, and
do give the ennemy sufficient work, to his great loss, and slaughter of his
best and brauest soldiers, as has partly been before declared in the former
Edition, whereunto I refer the courteous Reader: yet thus much I thought good
briefly to note by the way, for the better satisfaction of all such as have not
read the same. Since which time has been written sundry aduertisements, as
well from Antwerpe, and Callice, as also from Zeland and other places, which I
have collected in this present Pamphlet, for the further contentment of all
such as are desirous to read and understand the same.

THe enemy obstinately continuing his slege before Ostend, and they likewise of
the Town with like resolution defending the same, all means possible, and
warlike stratagems, to anoy, or defend, are daily put in practice: the enemy
with his ordonance thinks to weary them of the Town, killing sometimes
5.6.7. and 8. men in a day, for he sees it a thing impossible to bring his
ordonance so near the walls as to make a breach: they of the Town forget not
to repay him triple interest with their cannon, though not with so many shot,
yet with the death of four and five of their enemies for one slain of theirs.

The Duke of Ossuna vexed daily with the continual issuings and skirmishings
more then he desires, and great slaughter of his people: and finding the great
inconvenience of the ground, for the speedy bringing of his people from the
East fort to the west fort to succor each other, as need requires, has with
straw, fagots, haven, and earth, made a cawsey from Albertus forte to the east
fort, between the walls of the Town and his fortes, yet far without danger of
the shot from the Town, and has also brought all his ordenance from the
east side, and planted the same against the west side of the Town.

The States horsemen which came from the slege of Berk, understanding that 500
Spaniards were sent out of Die, and were marching toward the Dukes camp,
made such haste after them, that they over took them, and fiersly assailing
them on al sides, put them all to the sword, except some few which escaped by
flight to carry news of their ill hap.

Sir Frances Vere was hurt in the neck, and bruised above his shoulder, so
that his forehead was therewith swollen, which happened with the splinter of a
carriage that was broken by a shot from the enemies: but the hurt (as God
would) is not great, neither is his person in any danger thereby, although it
was at the first somewhat troublesome unto him. But within few days after he
departed from Ostend, to Middleborough, to confer with his Excellency, and
the States, about these affairs, who are daily looked for to come thither,
where they mean to make their abode, during the time of this seege, to the end
they may with more expedition give order in these weighty affairs.

The 1200. men that were pressed out of Kent, Essex, and other places of
England, and had lain at Vlushing, are sent to Ostend, with 3000. other old
soldiers, all Wallons, and Scots, so that there lies within the town, and in
the trenches without, some 8000. men besides 3000. more, which lie in ships
of war before the town, ready to be landed upon any occasion, who are daily
supplied with all kind of Munition, and fresh victualles, in so much, that all
victuals sit for soldiers, are there sold very abundantly, and at
reasonable prises, neither do the soldiers want money, but are very well
paid, whereby they may provide themselves of all such necessaries as they
want, and if any fall sick, or are hurt, they are presently sent out of the
town, to Vlushing, Middleborough, and other places of Zeland, where they are
placed in the Hospitalles, and are so dilligently attended, and carefully
looked unto, as themselves can wish or desire, wanting neither meat, drink,
wine, physic, nor surgerie, nor whatsoever else is fit and requisite for
their health and recovery, but are cherished as if they were in their fathers
houses: surely a most godly, and christian deed of the people of those
countries, who (notwithstanding their continual taxations laid upon them for
the maintenance of these long wars) do most liberally, and freely contribute
every man according to his estate and abillity in this most charitable action,
which is a worthy mirror to us, and to all other christians, teaching us to
esteem of the poor, and specially to have a fatherly care of the soldier,
who (while we sleep quietly in our beds, and go without fear about our
worldly affairs at home) must watch and ward day and night in all wethers, and
as often as he shall be by his captain commanded, venture his life against
the enemy, and as a bulwark, stand between the enemy and us for the defense
of our lives, wives, children, goods, and cuntry.

Sir Horatio Vere having command in his brothers absence, upon Tuesday being
the ninth day of August, offered skirmish to the ennemy which was long and
fiercely continued on both sides, and diverse times supplied with fresh
supplies, wherein the enemy lost 400 men, besides many that were hurt: and but
ten soldiers of the Town slain, and such as have lately come from Callice,
say, that the Flemmings themselves reported there, that there were seen 84
wagons with sick and hurt men carried out of the camp. In this fight the
ordonance of the Town slew many, both horsemen and footmen, and as it was
reported by merchants of good credit, there were in this fight seen 4 and 5
horsemen killed with one shot from the Town, and sometimes, 10 and 12 footmen
and more, were seen to be torn and carried away with one bullet.

If the enemy find many such banquets before Ostend, I think he will quickly
be weary of his fare, and seek a more friendly host elsewhere: and
furthermore they report, that it is incredible, to see and hear what great
numbers of dead men are daily brought from the camp, to all the Towns and
Villages near adjoining to the Camp to be buried, most of them being
Spaniardes, and Italians, Captains, Alferoes, and other Commanders, whereof
many are buried in Friars weeds with great solempnitie, saying and singing of
Masses and Dirges for their souls, God grant we hear no worse news of
their fellows.

They of Flaunders (understanding that the horsemen of the States were come to
Bargen up Zome, and some of the footmen into Zeland, where the count Maurice
was daily expected, doubting that his Excellency was purposed to land his
forces in the land of Waste, with intent to ouerrun the country thereabout with
fire and sword) gathered together all the Boores and Pesants of the country in
Arms, and have carried what they could into the towns and places of strength.

The twelfth day of August was an other great fight with the enemy, the same
continued an hour and more, and seconded with fresh supplies on both sides,
sometimes the one part, sometimes the other giving ground, and the ordonance
of the Town playing upon the enemies where they were seen to be thickest: in
all men's judgment there were slain three hundred and more of the ennemy,
besides many that were hurt, and there were 32. of our men slain, and some few
hurt.

There was a Mariner of Zeland in Ostend, that had his leg stricken off with
a great shot, who was taken up to be carried to the ship, but before he
could be brought to the boat, he was with an other shot struck through the
body, that he presently dyed, and so was rid of his pain. The like happened at
an other time to a soldier that was likewise slain with the enemies great
shot, and being carried on four men's shoulders to the grave, the coffin and
corse were shot through with an other bullet, the men presently set the coffin
on the ground, and ran as fast as they could, striving who should first get
the shot.

Thurseday the 13. day was a ship caled the Globe of Amsterdam met before
Ostend, laden very richly, and is reporported, to be worth 4. millions, which
came from the river of Plate, and straights of Magellanes, the same ship had
been out three years: and such as met this ship in their way from Vlushing,
report that two M. men more shall be sent out of Zeland to Ostend, which will
make up the number of 13. M. men, besides the voluntary, and others lately
gone out of England, so that it seems some great and extraordinary piece of
service is meant: God grant courage and good success to our people.

It is written from Antwerpe, that the Duke does woonders against the Town,
and has so besieged it both by sea and land, that there is no way left to
succor the same, and that their Galleys lying before the haven, have drouen
all the ships of war from thence, and suncke many: and yet (God knows) the
Galleys dare not once peep out, or show themselves, for the last time they
were at sea, they found (in their return from Sluice) their way so dangerous
to escape their enemies hands, that they have since, had small desire to hazard
themselves abroad.

There has been some speeches, that the enemy made a rolling trench, to fill
up the ditches of the Town, and so meant to enter the Town over the walls,
after he had made the same of equal height with the walls of the town, but
in truth that supposed work, was partly, for the repayring of his mount, and
making passage to free his souloiers from the waters, which mount was so
continually beaten with the ordonance from the town, and the workmen so
troubled with the issuings and skirmishings from sir Frauncis Veres trenches,
and the town, that the same could never be finished: but specially to defend
his trenches on the north west side of the town from the fireworks, which they
of Ostend did continually cast into those trenches, to the great annoyance of
the enemy and destruction of the soldiers therein, which trenches lie within
four or five pikes lengths of the counterscarps of the town: but if it were
so, that the enemy could bring such a supposed trench, without let of waters
and lay the same level with the wall (which great pains the Duke need not to
put his people unto, for that the Governor has offered to set open the Gates,
and to let his people enter if they durst) the Town being furnished with such
a number of men, and many of them old soldiers, the enemy would quickly be
weary of that enterprise: for without all question, they are so strong of men
within the town, that if they had but one M. horse, and fit ground without
the town, they would not fear, but (with Gods help) to hazard a battle, and
peradventure give the Duke as hard entertainment as they did the last year
before Newport.

There passes few days, but there are some sallies and enterprises made upon
the enemy, and many men slain on both sides, but all men that come from
thence, Callice, and other places, agree in this, that thee enemy loses 4, 5,
6, 7, and 8. for one lost on our side: notwithstanding it is (by good account
kept) written from Vlushing, that there has been above forty M. great shot
discharged against the sown since the first beginning of this siege, so that
the weast side of the wall of the town slicketh so full, and so thick of
great shot, as the like has not at any time before been known in any siege,
and yet the Duke is no more likely to obtain his purpose, than he was at his
first coming before the town.

The 21. day there came to London a French man from Callice, who reported for
certain, that the King of France was, in poast, come to Boloigne the
Wednesday before, and had appointed to be at Callice the next day following,
being the twentieth day of this month of August, which report has since
been by diverse confirmed, and that it was the 22 day in the evening before he
came into Callice, and also, that charge was given by the King, that every
townesman of the sea towns should have, and furnish himself with ten pound of
powder, and ten pound of lead or shot. The Frenchman abouesayd being demanded
concerning Ostend, answered, that (thanked be God) al was well, that there was
no fear or doubt to be made of the town, for they wanted nothing, but had all
things plentifully fit for their defense and sustenance, and at very reasonable
prices: adding further, that (if any man would accept his offer) he would wager
a hundred crowns against three hundred, that the Duke should not get Ostend,
and be master thereof these four months.

It is also written from Callice, and confirmed by sundry which come later from
Vlushing, that upon saturday being the fifteenth of August, the enemy
attempting some works nearer to the town than heretofore, had many pioners
and soldiers, to the number of about a thousand, or more to guarde them,
whereupon they sallied out of sir Francis Veres trenches, and began a very
hot fight, and were seconded presently with a thousand footmen out of the
Town, the fight was very hot, and with great fury maintained on both sides,
neither side sparing the other, but every one doing his best to kill his next
enemy: but in the end, the enemies were forced, by the means of the artillery
of the town, to give back, whereupon our men followed with such fury, that
they forced the enemy, even to his trenches, with slaugh ter of many of them,
and followed so hard upon them, that they seized seven pieces of ordonance,
which though the enemy a good while defended, yet in the end, he was compelled
pelled to abandon the place. But while our soldiers were earnestly busied to
nail and choke the pieces, a barrel of gunpowder standing near the
ordonance, took suddenly fire by reason of a match which the enemies had
secretly laid of purpose to mischief our people, whereby some 150 of our
soldiers were blown up, and scorched, yet not so sore hurt thereby, but that,
with Gods help, many of them will agame recover, and be able to do good
service. Some report that this mischance happened by one of the pressed
soldiers, coming too near the powder with his match, but howsoever it
happened, the enemy presently hereupon came afresh upon our soldiers, who being
amazed with this suddayne mishap, and many not knowing what it meant, were
forced to retire, but there were slain of the enemies in the fight 2000. men
whereof three. C. and more were horsemen, besides three C. pioners, neither was
this victory gotten without loss on our side, for there were slain of our
men about 4. hundred, and near three hundred hurt and scorched.

The governor of the Town seeing the enemy to use all means possible to
approach nearer to the walls, has caused the haven ditch or bank on the
southwest side of the Town to be cut, through which flows such abundance of
water at full sea, that the same runs a league into the land, even to the
forte of Isabella, which does so amaze and terrify the enemy, and all the
cuntry thereabouts, that it is coniectured the enemy will not lie long before
Ostend, for the first northwest wind that blows with any great gale, will
cause the water to spread and ouerflow the cuntry much farther, and the cutting
of the bank, causes such a separation between the trenches of both sides, at
hie water, that they can not come one to the other by eight or nine score, for
six hours space, neither with horse nor footmen.

It is reported by a soldier which came the foureteenth day of this month out
of Ostend, that they fight and issue out of the town upon the enemy daily, and
that there is no want of any thing in the town: that the new way made for
small shipping to come to the town cut out of the head, was again stopped and
made* up, for fear of such inconvenience as might thereby happen to the town
through tempestuous weather. And that for the better assurance of shipping
coming in by the old Haven, sir Frauncis Vere had caused a mount to be raised
joining unto the Haven, whereupon the enemies ordonance plays continually:
but they of the town do likewise continually repair and make up the same
again. And also he reported that some part of the enemies trenches toward
the northwest, lay within four or five pikes lengths of the towns
counterscarps, as is before declared, and some other part of the trenches
within eight or ten score of ours, the greatest part lay much farther off. That
the water ran every tide a great breadth between the town, and the enemies,
so that in many of their trenches the ennemie stood above the knees
continually in water, and at a spring tide the waters reached above their
nauilles, even to their breasts, which waters, they of the town with a sluice
had devised to keep in, that with the ebb the same could not return: at the
first the trenches of the town were annoyed with the same waters, as well as
the enemies: but since, they have found remedy to keep the waters out of their
own trenches. But the enemies are so greatly vexed with these waters, that they
are oftentimes forced to go out of their trenches, and to sit or lie upon the
banks and perapets: and then the ordonaunce of the Town plays so vehemently
upon them, that many of their carcasses are carried into the air: and further,
the said soldier affirmed, that it was a thing impossible for the enemy to
get the town, as long as men, victualles, and munition might be brought in,
which the enemy should never be able to let, though his shot might cause
some small danger in the day time, saying, that if once rain and foul weather
came, it was not possible that the enemy could keep his trenches, but must be
forced to abnandon the same.

The five and twentieth day of August were two sallies made upon the enemy,
with great slaughter, for after the enemies were drouen out of their trenches,
and with great fury followed, the horsemen came in so great troops upon our
people, that they were forced to retire: but within two hours after, they
issued the second time (after they had caused the ordonance of the town to be
laden with musket shot, and dice or square shot, imagining that the horsemen (as
they did before, would with great troops succor their footmen) and with
great resolution charged the enemy, and as they had done before, caused them to
forsake their trenches: and following hard upon them, the horsemen (as was
imagined) came upon our people, who with their pikes and muskets galled them
shrewdly: but retyring in order, to bring them within the danger of the towns
ordonaunce, which were so well bestowed upon them, that lanes were made
amongst the thickest, and at last four hundred horsemen slain.

The count Maurice came to Middleborough the one and twentieth day of this
month, the rest of his forces came from Dort in Holland with eight hundred
sail great and small, but where he minds to employ the same, is unknown:
God for his mercy sake (who is the giver of all good things) grant him
victory and good success wheresoever he goes, and to all his enterprises:
and contrariwise, confound the tyrannical attempts of the bloody Papists, and
of all their diabolical and most wicked proceedings. Amen.
