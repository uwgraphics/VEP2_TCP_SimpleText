INIVNCTIONS GYVEN BY THAVCtoritie of the kings highness to the clergy of this
his cealius.
IN THE NAME OF GOD AMEN. In the year of our lord god a thousand five
hundredth.XXXVI. and of the most noble reign of our sovereign lord Henry
the.viii. king of England and of France, defensour of the faith, lord of
Irelande, and in earth Supreme heed of the church of England, the.XXVIII.
year and the (...) day of (...) I Thomas Crumwell knight, lord Crumwell keeper
of the privy seal of our said sovereign lord the king, and vicegerent to
the same, for and concerning all his jurisdiction ecclesiastical within this
realm, visitinge by the kings hyghnes supreme authority ecclesiastical, the
people and clergy of this deanery of (...) by my trusty commissarye (...)
lawefully deputed and constitute for this part, have to the glory of almighty
god, to the kings highness honor, the publyke weal of this his realm, and
increase of virtue in the same, appointed and assigned these injunctions
insuinge, to be kept and observed of the deane, persons, vicars, curates, and
stipendiaries, restant or having cure of soul, or any other spiritual
administration within this deanery, under the peynes hereafter lymitted and
appointed.

The first is, that the deane, persons, vicars, and other having cure of soul
any where within this deanrie, shall faithfully keep and observe, and as far
as in them may lie, shall cause to be kept and observed of other, al and
syngular laws and statutes of this realm, made for the abolysshynge and
extirpation of the bishop of Romes pretensed and usurped power and
jurisdiction within this realm: and for the establyshement and confirmation of
the kings authority and jurisdiction within the same, as of the supreme heed
of the church of England: And shall to thuttermoste of their wit knowledge
and learning, purely, syncerely, and without any color or dissimulation,
declare, manifest, and open for the space of one quarter of a year now next
ensuyng, ones every sunday, and after that at the least wise twice every
quarter of a year, in their sermons and other collatio^s, that the bishop of
Romes usurped power and jurisdiction, having no establyshement nor ground by
the law of god, was of most just causes taken away and abolyshed, and that
therefore they owe unto him no manner of obedience or subjection, and that the
kings power is within his dominion the highest potentate and power under god,
to whom all men within the same dominion by goddis commandment owe most
loyalte and obedience, before and above all other powers and potentates in earth.

ITEM where as certain articles were lately devised and put forth by the
kings highness authority, and condescended upon by the preiates and clergy of
this his realm in convocation, whereof part are necessary to be holden and
believed for our salvation: and the other part do concern and touch certain
laudable ceremonies, rites, and vsages of the church, mete and convenient to
be kept and used for a decent and politic order in the same, the said deane,
persons, vicars, and other curates, shall so open and declare in their said
sermons and other collations, the said artycles unto them that be under their
cure, that they may plainly know and discern, which of them be necessary to
be believed and observed for their salvation, and which be not necessary, but
only do concern the decent and polityke order of the said church according
to such commandment and admonytion as has been given unto them heretofore by
auctorite of the kings highness in that behalf.

MORE OVER that they shall declare unto all such as be under their cure,
tharticles likewise devised, put forth, and authorized of late, for and
concerning thabrogation of certain superfluous holy days, according to
theffecte and purporte of the same articles, and persuade their parysshioners
to keep and observe the same inuiolably, as things holsomely provided,
decreed, and establyshed, by common concent and publyke auctorite, for the
weal commodity and profit of all this realm.

Besides this, to the intent that al superstition, and hipocrisy, crept into
diverse men's hearts, may vanyshe away, they shall not set forth, or extol any
images, relyques, or miracles, for any superstytion or lucre, nor allure the
people by any inticementes to the pilgremages of any saint, otherwise than is
permitted in the articles, lately put forth by thauctorite of the kings
majesty, and condescended upon by the prelates and clergy of this his realm,
in conuocaiton, as though it were propre or peculyar to that saynct, to give
this commodity or that, Saying all goodness, health, and grace, ought to be both
asked and looked for, only of god, as of the very author of the same, and of
none other: For without him it can not be given. But they shall exhort as well
their parishoners as other pilgrims, that they do rather apply them self to
the keeping of gods commandments, and fulfilling of his works of charity,
perswadinge them, that they shall please god more by the true exercysynge of
their bodyly labor, travail, or occupation, and providing for their families,
than if they went about to the said pilgrimages, and that it shall profit more
their soul health, if they do bestow that on the poor and nedy, which they
would have bestowed upon the said images or relyques.

ALSO in the same their sermons and other collations, the persons, vycars, and
other curates aforesaid, shall diligently admonish the fathers and mothers,
masters, and governors of youth, being within their cure, to teache or cause
to be taught their children and servants, even from their infancy, their Pater
noster, tharticles of our faith, and the ten commandementes in their mother
tongue: And the same so taught, shall cause the said youth often to repete and
understand. And to the intent this may be the more easily done, the said
curates shall in their sermons deliberately and plainly recite of the said pater
noster, articles, or commandementes, one clause or article one day, and an
other an other day, till the hole be taught and learned by little and little
(And shall deliver the same in writing, or show where printed books
conteyninge the same be to be fold, to them that can reed, or will desire the
same) And thereto that the said fathers and mothers, masters and governors, do
bestow their children and servants, even from their childehode, other to
lernyng, or to some other honest exercise, occupation, or husbandry,
exhortinge, counsayling, and by at the ways and means they may, as well in
their said sermons and collations, as other ways, perswadynge the said
fathers, mothers, masters, and other governors, being under their cure and
charge, diligently to provide and forsee, that the said youth be in no manner
wise kept or brought up in ydelnes, lest at any time after ward they be
driven for lack of sum mystery or occupation to live by, to fall to beggyng,
stealing, or some other vnthriftynes. For as much as we may daily see,
through sloth and ydelnes, diverse valiant men fall, some to beggynge, and some
to theft and murder, which after brought to calamity and mysery, impute a
great part thereof to their friends and governors, which suffered them to be
brought up so idelly in their youth, where if they had been well educated and
brought up in some good litterature, occupation, or misterye, they should
(being rulers of their own family) have profyted as well them self, as
diverse other persons, to the great commodity and ornaments of the common
weal.

ALSO that the said persons, vicars, and other curates shall diligently
provide, that the sacraments and sacramentalles, be duly and reverently
ministered in their parishes. And if at any time it happen them other in any of
the cases expressed in the statutes of this realm, or of special license
given by the kings majesty, to be absent from their benefices, they shall
leave their cure not to a rude and unlearned person, but to an honest, well
learned and expert curate, that may teach the rude and unlearned of their cure,
wholesome doctrine, and reduce them to the right way that do err. And always
lett^ them se, that another they nor their vycars do seek more their own
profit, promotion, or advantage, than the profit of the souls, that they
have under their cure, or the glory of God.

ITEM that every person or proprietary of any parysshe church within this
realm, shall on thisside the feast of saint Peter ad vincula next coming,
provide a book of the hole Bible, both in Latin, and also in English, and
lay the same in the quiere for every man that will, to look and read thereon,
and shall discourage no man from the reding of any part of the Bible, either in
Latin or in English, but rather comfort exhort, and admonish every man to
read the same, as the very word of God, and the spiritual food of man's
soul, whereby they may the better know the duties to god, to their
soueraygne lord the king, and their neighbor. Ever gentylly and charitably
exhorting them, that using a sobre and a modeste hauiour in the redynge and
inquysition of the true sense of the same, they do in no wise styffely or
eygrely contend or strive one with an other about the same, but refer the
declaration of those places, that be in controversy, to the judgment of them
that be better learned.

ALSO the said deane, persons, vicars, curates, and other priests, shall in no
wise, at any vnlaufulle time, nor for any other cause, than for their honest
necessity, haunte or resort to any tauernes or alehouses, and after their
dinner and supper, they shall not give them self to drinking or riot, spending
their time idelly by day or by night, at tables or cards playenge, or any
other unlawful game: But at such times, as they shall have such leisure,
they shall read or here somewhat of holy scripture, or shall occupy them self
with some other honest exercise. And that they always do those things, which
apperteyne to good congruence and honesty, with profit of the common weal:
having always in mind, that they ought to excel all other in purity of
life, and should be example to all other to live well and christenly.

Furthermore, because the goods of the church are called the goods of the
poor, and at these days nothing is less seen, than the poor to be sustained
with the same, all persons, vycars, pensionaries, prebendaries, and other
beneficed men within this deanrie, not being resident upon their benefices,
which may dispende yearly.xx.li. or above, other within this deanrie, or else
where, shall distribute hereafter yearly among their poor parisheners, or
other inhabitants there, in the presence of the church wardens, or some other
honest men of the paryshe, the.xl. part of the fruictes and revenues of their
said benefices, lest they be worthily noted of ingratitude, which reserving
so many parts to them self, can not vouchsafe to empart the.xl. portion
thereof among the poor people of that paryshe, that is so fruictfull and
profitable to them.

AND to the intent that learned men may hereafter spring the more for the
execution of the premises, every person, vicar, clerk, or beneficed man
within this deanrie, having yearly to dispende in benefices and other
promotions of the church an hundredth pounds, shall give competent exhibition
to one scholar, and for as many hundredth pounds more, as he may dispende, to
so many scholars more, shall give like exhibition, in the university of
Oxenford or Cambrige, or some gra^mer schole, which after they have profited
in good learning, may be parteners of their patrones cure and charge, as well in
preaching as otherwise in thexecution of their offices, or may when need shall be
otherwise profit the common welthe, with their counsel and wisdom.

ALSO that all persons, vicars, and clerks, having churches, chapels, or
mansions, within this deanrie, shall bestow yerelye hereafter upon the fame
mansions, or chauncels of their churches, being in decay, the.v. part of that
their benefices, till they be fully repaired, and the same so repaired, shall
always keep and maynteyne in good state.

ALL which and singular injunctions, shall be inuiolably observed of the said
deane, persons, vicars, curates, stipendiaries, and other clerks and benefyced
men, under the pain of suspention and sequestration of the fruictes of their
benefices, until they have done their duty, according to these injunctions.
