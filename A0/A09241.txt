LONDON:

Printed by Thomas Snodham, 1620.

To the right Virtuous, Beauteous, and accomplished Gentlewomen, Mistress MARY
HOLDER, daughter to the worshipful Cle: Holder Prebend Residenciary of the
Collegiat Church of Southwell. And Mistress SARA HEART, daughter to the
worshipful JOHN HEART of London Esquite.
THree occasions did somewhat move me to the publishing of this private
Music; I call it private, for that here are Songs for one with a Violl, or 2.
or 3. 4. 5. or 6. besides the portablenesse of the Book: The first occasion
was, the wandering of diverse of these Dialogues from hand to hand in imperfect
Coppies, neither as I meant, or made them: The second, they falling thus
imperfectly into the hands of some imperfect practitioners, they have taken
upon them to mend them, (or indeed rather mard them) and have put their names
unto them, as the original authors of them: The third occasion was, that some
of my Labors in this kind, have thus imperfectly stolen unto the Press,
without my will or knowledge; by means whereof, neither the hearer, nor the
Author had or has their due right. These occasions did a little stir me to
the delivery of my true meaning in this little work. But a fourth occasion I
confess, did more powerfully prevail with me then these before recited, and
that was, your graceful good likings, and loving favors to these, and other
of my harsh and vnformall Tones; following herein your honored Parents steps,
no less gently and mildely respecting the poverty of the Compositions, then
not neglecting the good will of the Author; gracing me and these with your
often hearing, and sundry times performing them with your own voices and
fingers: you both being so equally judicious and exquisite in this admirable
Art of Music, surpassing the most, and inferior to none that ever I heard of
your sex, and in 3. or 4. several sorts, besides all other your excellent
gifts and parts of learning, fitting your places and callings, as I protest I
was not a little troubled, (save that there must be in each number a priority
of order, you being in every degree of perfection equal) which of your Names I
should first write in this Book.

These favors I freely acknowledge, to be the true causes of this undertaking,
I hating ingratitude, and having no other means in part to require your
goodness but this, do in all humility and thankfulness, (and to the rich
worth of your rarest perfections) dedicate this poor work to your kind
acceptances as a testimony of my thankful heart, for all your graces and good
regards had of me for these, and these for me from time to time And if it
please you, still to respect and accept my humble heart (in this Action)
according to my hope, in protecting this poor and unpolished piece, it shall
be none of the least of your loves, you gracing this endeavor with your Names,
I shall not doubt but that your reputations (being known to be full of all
virtue and modesty, as also of judgment equal to your practice in this
learned science,) will stop the black mouth of each rashly forward ignorant,
who being not able to do any worthy thing himself, will not be pleased with
others that strive to do their best; and out of pride and arrogant boldness
would assume his own greatness, with pressing other men's supposed disgraces.
Thus, presuming of your gentle mildness, together with your sweetest tempered
construction of this my bold adventure, I leave you to the ensuing sounds, as
also to the hope of the heavenly harmonies hereafter; never leaving to be the
true admirer of all your real virtues

I.
CANTVS.
^OPen the door, Whose there within? The fairest of thy ^ Mothers kin, O come,
come, come abroad, And here the shrill birds sing,^ The Air with tunes that
load, It is too soon to go to rest, The Sun not^ midway yet to West, The day
does miss thee, And will not part vn-^ till it kiss thee.^

Bassus.
^ And will not part ^ until it kiss thee.

Were I as fair as you pretend,
Yet to an unknown sild-seene friend
I dare not open the door.
To hear the sweet birds sing,
Often proves a dangerous thing.
The Sun may run his wonted race,
And yet not gaze on my poor face,
The day may miss me:
Therefore depart,
You shall not kiss me.
Contra-Tenor.
Open the door:^ And will not part until it kiss thee.

TENOR.
Open the door:^ And will not part until it kiss thee.

II.
CANTVS.
^REsolu'd to love, unworthy to obtain, I do no favor ^ crave, but humble
wise, To thee my sighs in verse I sacri- fice, ^ Only some pity and no help
to gain.^

Bassus.
^ Only some^ pit- ty and no help to gain.

2.
Much sorrow in ^ self my love does move,
More my despair to love a hopeless bliss:
My folly most to love when sure to miss,
Oh help me but this last grief to remove.
3.
All pain if you command it, joy shall prove,
And wisdom to seek joy: then say but this,
Because my pleasure in thy torment is,
I do command thee without hope to love.
Contra-Tenor.
Resolved to love:^ Only some pity and no help to gain.

TENOR.
Resolved to love:^ Only some pity and no help to gain.

III.
CANTVS.
^AH were she pit-tifull, as she is fair, Or but so ^ mild as she is seeming
so, Then were my hopes greater then my despair, Then all the^ world were
heaven, and nothing woe.^

Bassus.
^ Then all the^ world were heaven, and nothing woe.

But beauty being pitiless and stern,
Cruel in deed, though mild in outward show:
Will neither hopes, or my dispaires discern,
But leads me to a hell of endless woe.
Contra-Tenor.
Ah were she pitiful:^ Then all the world were heaven, and nothing woe.

TENOR.
Ah were she pitiful:^ Then all the world were heaven, and no- thing woe.

IIII.
CANTVS.
^DIsdaine that so does fill me, Has surely sworn to kill me, ^ And I must
dye, Desire that still does burn me, To life again will turn me, And^ live
must I, O kill me, O kill me, O kill me then despair, That I may^ live, that I
may live again.

Bassus.
^ O kill me then despair, ^ that I may live again.

2.
Thy looks are life unto me,
And yet those looks undo me:
O death and life.
Thy smile some rest does show me,
Thy frown with war or ethrow me,
O peace and strife.
Nor life, nor death is either,
Then give me both, or neither.
3.
Life only cannot please me,
Death only cannot ease me:
Change is delight.
I live that death may kill me,
I dye that life may fill me,
Both day and night.
If once despair decay,
Desire will wear away.
Contra-Tenor.
Disdain that:^ O kill me then despair, that I may live a- gain.

TENOR.
Disdain that:^ O kill me, O kill me, mee^ then despair, that I may live

^ O Precious time, created by the might of his blessed word, That And wise- ly
par-ted into day and night, For his best use and ^ made all comely features, Oh
woe is me, oh woe is me that have misspent ser- uice of the Creatures. ^ this
treasure, In vain delight of fond and wicked pleasure. ^

Bassus.
^ that have misspent this treasure ^ in vain delight of fond, of fond and
wicked pleasure.

O precious time,
Created by the might of his blessed word,

VI.
CANTVS.
^ CAn a Maid that is well bred, Has a blush so lovely ^ red, Modest looks,
wise, mild, discreet, And a nature passing sweet, Break her ^ promise, untrue
prove, On a sudden change her love, Or be won ere to neglect, ^ him to whom
she vowed respect, him to whom she vowed respect?

Bassus.
^ Him to whom she vowed, she vowed respect?

Such a Maid alas I know,
Oh that weeds among Corn should grow:
Ora Rose should prickles have,
Wounding where she ought to save.
I that did her parts extol,
Will my lavish tongue control:
Outward parts do blind the eyes,
Gall in golden pill^ often lies.
Reason, wake and sleep no more,
Land upon some safer shore:
Think on her and be afraid,
Of a faithless fickle Maid.
Of a faithless fickle Maid,
Thus true love is still betraide:
Yet it is some ease to sing,
That a Maid is light of wing.
Contra-Tenor.
Can a Maid: ^ Him to whom, to whom she vowed respect.

TENOR.
Can a Maid: ^ Him to whom she vowed, she vowed respect.

VII.

ardent clips, I Will lay thee a the lips, I Will lay thee a the lips, And make thee^
ever swear, farewell, farewell, farewell, farewell, farewell old Batcheler.

Bassus.
^ I Will lay thee a the lips, And make thee ^ ever swear, farewell, farewell,
farewell, farewell, farewell old Batcheler.

O I do love, then kiss me,
And after I Will not miss thee,
With bodies lovely meeting:

And make thee ever swear,
Farewell old Batcheler.

VIII.
CANTVS.
^SInce just disdain began to rise, and cry revenge for spiteful wrong, ^
What erst I praised, I now despise, and think my love was all too long, I^
tread in dirt that scornful pride, which in thy looks, thy ^ I have
discry'd,^ Thy beauty is a painted skin, for fools to see their faces in,^ for
fools, for fools to see their fa- ces in.

Bassus.
^ For fools, for fools to see their faces in.

Thine eyes that some as stars esteem,
From whence themselves they say take light:
Like to the foolish fire I deem,
That leads men to their death by night.
Thy words and oaths are light as wind,
And yet far lighter is thy mind:
Thy friendship is a broken reed,
That fails thy friend in greatest need.
Contra-Tenor.
Since just disdain:^ for fools, for fools to see their fa- ces in.

TENOR.
Since just disdain:^ For fools, for fools to see their faces in.

she will not be converted, Say shall she go, O no, no, no, no, no, O no, no,
no, no, no,^ She is most fair though she be marble hearted.

Bassus.
^ No, no, O no, ^ though she be marble hearted.

How often have my sighs ^eclar'd mine anguish,
Wherein I daily languish?
Yet does she still procure it,
Hark, let her go for I cannot endure it:
Say, shall she go,
Oh no, no, no, no,
She gave the wound, and she alone must cure it.
Contra-Tenor.
At her fair hands:^ O no, no, O no, no, Though she be marble hearted.

TENOR.

Upon this merry day:
The Country Lasses throng,

Bassus.
^ The horn, the horn, the horna, The horn, the horn, the horna.

If Vulcan have the horna,
then Venus is to blame:
And Mars that did entice her,
unto that wanton game.
Yet Vulcan needs must keep it,
to set all well in frame:
The horn, the horn, the horna.
The horn, the horn, the horna.

sense too weak to bear her spirits might.

Bassus.
^Her sense too weak to bear her spirits might.

And while, O sleep, thou closest up her sight,
Her light, where love did forge his fairest dart:
O harbor all her parts in easefull plight,
Let no strange dream make her fair body start.
But yet, O dream, if thou will not depart,
In this rare subject from thy common right:

Till her eyes shine, I live in darkest night.
