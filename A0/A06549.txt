The Churl and the Bird.

depiction of man and bird

PRoblemes of old likeness and figure
Which proved ben, fructuous of silence
And have auctorites, grounded in scripture
By resemblaunce, of notable aparaunce
with moralities, concludynge on prudence
Like as the bible reherseth by writing
How trees sometime chose them a king.
First in their choice, they named Olyue
To rain among them, iudicu^ does express
But he hymsefle began excuse blyue
That they might not forsake the fatness
Nor the fygge tree, her amorous swetnes
Nor the vine tree, his wholesome fresshe courage
which gives comfort, to all manner of age
And semblable poytes laureate
By dark parables full convenient
Feign that birds and beestes of estate
As royal Egles, and lions by assent
Sent out writtes to hold a paralyment
And made the cry, breuely for to say
So^^ to have lord ship, and some to obey.
Egles in the air, highest to take their flight
Power of lions, on the ground is seen
Cedre among trees, highest in sight
The laurel of nature, is aye grene
Of flowers all Flora, aye goddess and queen
Thus in all things, there ben dyuersyti^^s
Churl and bird.
Some of estate, and some of low degrees.
Poytes write, wonderful likeness
And under covert, keep them self full close
They take beestes, and fowls to witness
Of whose sayenges, fables first a rose
And here I cast on my purpose
Out of french, a tale to translate
which in a pamflete, I saw and read but late
This tale, which I make mencyon
In gross reherseth plainly to declare
The great proverb, paid for the raunson
Of a little bird, taken in a snare
wonderful desirous, to escape out of care
Of mine auctor following the process
So as it fell, in order I shall you express
Sometime there dwelled in a small vylage
As mine anctor makes mencyon
A churl, which had lust and courage
within him self, by dyligent travail
To array his garden, with notable aparayle
Of length and bread, in like square and long
Hedged and dytched, to make it sure and strong
All the alayes, were maid plain with sand
The benches covered, which new turues grene
with the sweet yerbes, and condytes at hand
Than welled up against the son shynynge
Like unto silver, or any crystal clear
The byrbyll wawes, in their up boylynge
Round as byrrall, their beams out shyuynge.
In mids of the garden, stood a fresshe laurere
Thereon a bird singing day and night
with shyni^ge feathers, bryghter than the gold wyr^
which with her song, made heavy hertes light
that her to behold, it was an heavenly sight
Now toward even, and in the dawning
She did her pain most amerously to sing
Esperous enforced her courage
toward even, when phoebus went to the west
Among the branches, to take her advantage
To sing her complaynte, and than to go to rest
And at the rysynge of the queen Alcest
to sing again, as it were her deu
Early on the morrow, the day after to salve.
It was a very heavenly melody
Even and morrow to hear the birds song
And the sweet sugared ermony
with uncouth warbles and tunes draw alonge
That all the garden, of the noise tongue
Till on the morrow, when tytan did shine clear
the bird was trapped, and caught in a pantere
The churl was glad, that he y^ bird had take
Merry of chere, of look and vysage
And in all have, he cast for to make
Within his house, a little pretty cage
And with her song, to rejoice his courage
till at the last, the cely bird a brayde
And soberly to the churl she said
I am take and stand under daungere
Holden strayte, that I may not fle
A due my song, my lusty notes clear
Now have I lost my lyberte
Now am I thrall, that sometime was fre
And trust me well, while I stand in distrisse
I can not sing, nor make no gladness?
And though my cage forged were of gold
And the pynacles, of byrrall and crystal
I remember a proverb of old
who leseth his fredome he leseth all
For I had leauer, upon a branch small
Merely sing, among the leaves grene
Than in a cage of silver bright and shine
Sothe and prison, have none accordaunce
Trowest thou I wyle sing in prison
Nay, for song proceeds of joy and plesaunce
And prison causes does and destruction.
Redynge of letters makes no merry sound
Or who should be merry or iocounde
Against his will that lies in chains bound
What avails a Lion to be a king
To be shyt up in a tower of stone
Or an Egle under streyte keeping
Calle^ king of fowls euery^hone
Fie on lordshyp, when lyberte is gone
Answer hereto, and let it not astarte
who syngeth merely, y^ syngeth not at the her^e
But and thou wylt rejoice of my singing
Suffer me to go fre from all danger
And every day in the grieve morning
I will repair unto the la^rere
And merely sing with lusty note clear
Under the chamber, or a fore thine hall
Every season, when thou list me to call.
To be shyt up and pynned under dread
Nothing accords to my nature
Though I were fedd with milk and wastell bread
And sweet curdes brought to my pasture
yet had I lever to do my busy cure
Erly on the morrow to scrapt in the wall
To find my dinner, among the worms small.
The labourer is gladder at the plough^
Erly on morrow to feed him with bacon
Than some man is, that has treasour ynough^
And of all dei^ties plente and foyson
And no fredome with his possessyon
To go at large, but as a bear at a stake
To pass his bonds if he leave take.
Take this answer for a short conclusyon
to sing in prison thou shalt me not (...) streyne
Till I have fredome in wodes up and down
to fly at large, on boughe roughe and plain
And of reason thou should not disdain
Of my desire, but laughe and have good game
But he yt is a churl, would each man were the same
well quod the churl, sith it will not be
That I desire as by thy talking
Maugry thy will, thou shalt chose one of three
within a cage merely to sing
Or to the kechyn I shall thy body bring
Pluck thy feathers, that been bright and clear
And after roast or bake the to my sopere
well quod the bird, as to reason I say not nay
thouchynge my song, a full answer thou have
And when my feathers ben plucked away
If I be roste and baken in past
On me thou shalt have but a small repaste
But and if thou will work after my counsel
By me may thou have great avail
If thou will unto my reason assent
And suffer me to go fre from prison
without raunsom, or any other rent
I shall the give a notable guerdon
Three great wysdome^, according to reason
More of value, take heed what I profer
Than all thy gold that is shyt in thy cofer
Trust me well, I will the not disceyue
well quod the churl, tell on let se
Nay quod the bird, thou must before conceive
who that shall teache of reason must go fre
It sytteth, a master to have his lyberte
And at large to teache his lesson
Have me not in suspecte I mean no treason
well quod the churl I hold me content
I trust thy promise which thou make me
The bird flewe forth, the chorle was of assent
And took her flight, unto the laurer tree
than thought she, now stand I fre
with no panters I cast not a I my life
Nor with lyme twigs, any more to strive.
He is a fool that escaped is daungere
Broken his fetters, and fled out of prison
To resort, for the brent child dredeth fire
Each man beware of wisdom and reason
Of sugre strewed, which hydeth false poison
There is no poison venim so per^llus of sharpness
As is, when it has of tryacle a likeness
Who dredeth no peril, in peril he shall fall
Smothe waters ben oftentimes deep
The quayle pype can most falsely call
till the quayle under the net does crepe
A blerecyed fouler, trust not though he weep
Eschew his tomb, of weeping take no head
That simple birds can nype vy the head.
And I that now such daungere am escaped
I will beware, and before provide
That of no fouler I will no more betaked
From their lyme twigs, I will flee fer a side
where paryll is, great paryll is to abide
Come nere thou churl, harken to my speech
Of three wysdomes that I will the teache
Give not of wisdom to hasty credence
To every tale of each tydynge
But consydre of reason and prudence
Among many tales, is many a great lesynge
Hasty credence, has caused great hindering
Report of tales and tidings brought up new
Caused many a man, to behold untrue
For o^e part take this of my raunson
Learn the second, grounded on scripture
Desire thou not by no condycion
thing, which is impossible to recure
worl^ly desire stand^ in adventure
As who desires, to clym hye on lofte
By sodeyne turn, he ^alleth vnso^te
the third is this beware both even and morrow
Forget it not, ^u^ ^^r^e this of me
For treasour lost, make never to great sorrow
Which in no wise, may recovered be
For who so takes sorrow, for love of any degree
Reken his love and after his pain
And of one sorrow, he makes sorrows twain
After this lesson, the bird began a song
Of her escape greatly reioysynge
And she remembered also the great wrong
Done by the churl, first at her taking
O^ her afray, and her emprysoninge
Glad that she was out of dread
Said unto him, houerynge above his head
Thou were quod she a natural fool
To suffer me depart of lewdenesse
thou ought to complaynt and make dole
And in thy heart to have great heaviness
That thou lost so passing great richesse
which might suffyce by value in reckoning
To pay the raunson, of a mighty king
There is a stone which is called a Iaconn^^
Of gold engendered in mine entraile
which of fine gold, passes a great ounce
Cytryne of color like a granet of entayle
which makes men vyctoryous in battle
And who so ever bears on him this stone
Is fully assured against his mortal fone.
who that has this stone in possessyon:
Shall suffer no pouertye ne no indygence
But of all treasour, have plente and foyson
And every man shall do him reverence
And none enemy shall do to him offense
But fro thy hands, now that I am gone
Plain if thou wylt, for thy part is none
It causes love, and makes men gracyous
And favorable in every man's sight
It makes acorde, between men Enuyous
It comforts sorofull, it makes heavy hertes light
Like to poison in color shyneth bright
I am a fool to tell all at ones
Or to teache a churl, ye precious stones
Men should not put a precious margaryte
As rubyes sapphires, and other stones Inde
Emeraudes, nor round perles white
A^ore rude swyne that love draffe of kind
For a sow delyteth as I find
More in foul draffe her pigs for to glade
Than in all the p^ry, that comes of garnerd
Each thing draws to his semblable
Fysshe in the sea, beestes on the ground
The air for fowls is most comendable
And to the ploughe man to till the land
And a churl to have a mucforke in hand
I lose my time, any more to tarry
Or to teache a churl of the lapydary
That thou had, thou gettest no more a geyne
thy lyme twigs and thy panters I defye
To let me go, thou were foul ouersene
to lose thy richesse, only of folly
I am now fre to sing and to fle
where that my list, he is a fool at all
that goes at large, and makes himself a thrall
To here of wisdom thine ears ben defe
Like to an ass, that lysteneth to an harp
Thou may go pype, in a rue lefe
For better it is to sing on thorns sharp
than in a cage, with a churl to carpe
For it was said of folks long a gone
that a churles bird, is often woe be gone
The churl felt his heart atwayne
For very sorrow, and a sonder ryue
Alas quod he, I may well weep and plain
As a wretch never like to thryue
But to mourn in pouertye all my live
For of folly, and of wylfulnesse
I have lost hoyly all my richesse.
I was a lord I cried out on fortune
And had great treasour late in my keeping
which might have made me long to continue
with that stone to have lived like a king
Or if that I had set it in a ring
Borne it upon me, I have good enough
Me neded no more, to have gene to the ploughe
when the bird hard the churl thus mourn
And how that he was heavy of his chere
She took her flight, and began again return
toward him and said as ye shall here
O thou dull churl wysdom for to lere
that I the taught, all is left behind
Raced away and clean out of thy mind
Taught I the not this wisdom in sentence
To every tale brought up of new
Not to hastily to give credence
Unto the time, thou know that it be true
All is not gold, that shows goldysshe hew
Nor stones all, by nature as I find
Be not sapphires, that show colors ynde.
In this doctrine I have lost my labor
To teache the such proverbs of substance
Here may thouse, thy lewd blind error
For all my body peysed in a balaunce
weyeth not an ounse, rude is thy remmebraunce
I to have more peyse closed in mine entrayle
Than all my body, set to the contertayle
All my body weyeth not an ounce
How might I than have in me a stone
That peyseth more than does a great Iacou^ce
thy brain is dull, thy wit is almost gone
Of three wysdomes thou have forgotten one
For thou should not after my sentence
To every tale, give to hasty credente.
I bade also beware, both even and morrow
For thing lost, by soden adventure
thou sholdest not make to much sorrow
when thou see, thou may it not recure
And there thou faylest that thou do thy busy cure
In thy snare to catch me again
Thou art a fool, thy labor is in vain.
In the third, thou do also rave
For I bade, thou sholdest in no wise
Couete thing, which thou may not have
In which thou have forgotten mine empryse
Thus I may say, plainly to deuyse
that thou have of madness forgotten all three
Notable wysdomes, that I taught the
It were folly, more with the to carpe
Or preche of wisdom more or less
I hold him mad, that brings forth an harp
Thereon to teache a rude dull ass
And madder is he, that syngeth to a fool a mass
And he is most mad, that does his busyness:
To teache a churl, terms of gentylnesse.
And semblably, in April and in May
when gentle birds make most melody
The cuckoo syngeth but on lay
Of other tunes she has no fantasy
Thus every thing, as books specifye
As fowls and bestes of every age.
From whens they came they take talage
The Vintener treats of his wholesome wynes
Of gentle fruits bostteth the Gardener
The Fissher casts his hokes and his lyens
to catch fysshe, in every fresshe river
Of tylthe of land, treats the Labourer
the Gentylman, treats of gentrye
And the Churl delyteth him all in rybandry.
All one to thee, a Fa^kon as a Kyfe
As good an Owl as a Popingay
A donghyll ducke, as daynty as a Snyte
Who serves a churl, has many a careful day
A due sir Churl, fare well I fly my way
For I cast me never hensforth in my likynge
A fore a churl, any more to sing.
Ye folk that shall this fable se or read
New forged tales I counseyle you to fle
For loss of gooddes, take never to great head
Nor be not sorry for none aduersyte
Nor couete thing, that may not recovered be
And remember where ever ye gone
That a churles bird, is ever woe begone
Unto my purpose, this proved is fully ryue
Read and report by old remembrance
That a churles bird and a knaves wise
Have oftentimes, great sorrow and myschaunce
And who that has fredome, has all suffysaunce
For better is fredome, with little in gladness
Than to be thrall, with all worldly richesse
To little queyer, and recommende me
Unto my master, with humble affection
Besechynge him lowly of mercy and pity
Of this rude making, to take compassyon
And as touching the translacion
Out of french, how it englisshed be
All thing is said under correction
with supportacyon, of your benygnite.
