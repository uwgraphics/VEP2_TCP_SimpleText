A Christen exhortacion unto customable swearers

What a right and lawful oath is: when / and before whom / it owght to be.

Item. The manner of saying grace / or geuynge thanks unto God.

Who so ever hears Gods word / believe it / and do thereafter shall be saved.

Unto the reader.
GRace and increase of knowledge from God the father / through owre Lord
Jesus Christ / be with the Christian reader / and with all other (...) ^untremen
that love the Lord vn^aynedlye. In the Lords byneyarde / (dear frynde) I se
men in this age busylye occupied to root owte ^^wedes of inueterate vices and
old can^^ed customs. Some has preached against supersticions. Some has
written against Purgatory and Pardons. Some has inueyed against Pylgrimage^
and sects. Some has beatten down Monasteries and Shrynes / Idolles and their
aulters* Some seaketh yet to this day to de^^roy^ Popyshe decrees / to
abolyshe vain Ceremonies / to restore necessary rytes / and to bring again
all things to Cristes first inst^^^cion. All these things are Godly / I
deny it not / and men vertuouslye exercised in so doing. But these for the
more part has parteyned / and yet still does par^eyne / to the monstrous
kingdom of Antecrist or disgysed church of hypocrites. Which has evermore had
a great show or glytterynge pretense of godliness / though they have (after
S. Paul) denied the power thereof. But the abho^^nable custom of swearinge or
daily blaspheming of the blessed name of god (which is of the de^ylles
kyngedome right out / without any colors to the contrary) has very few or
none re^uked / specially in there wrytinges. Wherefore I have conceived it a
thing most necessary to setforth sumwhat concerning the rebuke thereof / to
put me^ in remembrance of them selfs / least they should through custom
forgett God. So has this execrable abusyon increased among the people / that
rather it has been co^nted a virtue than a vice / ^^^ynge the open door unto
dampnacion. yea so depelye has this pestilent poison infected the wits of
men / that nothing seameth pleasant unto them / fresh / or worthy to be
lawghed at / unless it be joined with the blasphemye of gods holy name. The
tale shall lack his dew circumstance / unless it be myred with oaths. As
with blood / wounds / death / and sides / with cursinges and bannynges / as
pox / pestil^ce / foul evil / shame / vengeance / and myfchef / to badde to
be uttered among the deuyls in hell. Oh merciful God / how can they think
themselfes worthy of the name of cristianes / vsinge such deuyllishnes? how
can they hope to be saved in Crist / vtteringe out of all christian order such
owtragio^s blasphemye? much more godly should the cristyan be / than either
Jew or pagane / yet is he a thousand times worse in his conversation and life.
Among all vices whereunto the corrupt nature of owre nation is given (for the
more part) is blasphemye and whoredom / though the first of them be
dyrectelye against the thread commandment of God in the first table / and the
other against the thread in the second table (which is the seventh in number)
yet are they in daily custom / God not feared / nor yet there danger
considered. And why? They that should be the salt of the earth / are become
vnsaverye / and where as they ought to give us the light of good lyuinge / they
offer us darkness. Neither is the corrupcio^ of execrable swearinge taken
from us by the seasonable doctrine of owre prelates / and prestes / nor yet by
there shyninge examples away left us to forsake stinking whoredom. Rather do
they show us a plain pathe unto them both. For no where shall you find more
oaths / nor of more diverse kinds / than in bisshoppes howses. And as for
common whores / you shall have so many / not far from some of there howses /
as are able to serve the filthy flock of an whole contree. There eyes are so
spiritual / that they can not see the^ blottes. These sauers can they not
smell though they go by them every day. So small fear have they to God / and
so little good will bear they / ^o the honorable state of matrimonye. But if a
poor man begins to fauer the verite of the lord / they cane smelle him out
though he be.xl. mile of. But with these things will they not meadle. And why?
they are both necessary for a common wealth. By good hansome swearinge men
appear valeaunte / and no faint hearted cowerdes. The stews ar permitted / as
an wholesome polytique ordinance / to auoyed a greatter inconvenience. For
else (say they) honest mennys wyfes should not live in rest. Oh beastlye belie
gods / may you by your polytique ordinances (contrary saint Paul's
doctrine) s^ffer an evil thing that good may come thereof? Faithful wyfes
will continue in there honest / when you / and all whorehu^ters shall go to the
devil. It gives rather an occasion to wyfes / and mayde^s to be nowght. For
when the wife is disposed to be an whore / she knows where to be received.
Many a maid likewise / when a wanton fellow has gotten vpehure bealye she
must straight way to the stews. If hure master or maystres see any wanton
towch with hure^ and than (as it becomes them) tell hure of it / she set the
less by them / and all because of the stews. And it is a common saying / ware
there no receyuer there should be no thief. So ware there no stews / there should
not so many honest mennis daughters rune away from there fathers and play the
whores as does. Oh ^^testable hypocrites / what honest man can think the
breaking of gods commandementes to further a Christen land? why are princes /
magistrates / and judges / put in aucthorite but only to se them observed? why
are you made bisshoppes / but only to persuade them to the same? Never bring
you an owtragious blasphemer / nor a common aduowtere^ to open shame before the
world / at Paul's cross / though there be never so many. Never labor you to
the king and his counsel for a refourmacion to be hadd of these most
execrable vices / though you know them to be most hurtefull / to a Christen
common wealth. you can wy^he at such greauous euylles / and suffer the^ to be
taken as no sins. It was not without a cause that Christ called you a
blasphemous / and an aduouterous generation. It is not for nowght / that the
scripture gives you so many odyous names. As strangers / beasts /
adversaries / dreamers / colubers / belyals / dome dogs / ra^onynge wolves /
serpents / le ^athans / bastardes / traitors / destroyers / thieves / idolles /
men of sin / sons of perdicion / unshamefast liars / wicked doers / enemies
to the truth vncle^ne fowls / deuilles incarnate blind leaders of the blind
/ hypocrytes / hy ^^linges / false prophettes / ill sede / with an.C. more. you
will make gods commandementes of no effect / to auoyed greatter
inconvenience. Oh detestable enemies to the truth / what inconvenience can be
greatter / than to neglecte the laws of god does he not thretten to them that
break his commandementes all these fearful plages? As derth / barennesse /
scarsenes / need / hunger / thurst / ^o^ertie / penurye / the plages and
sycknesses of Egypt / pestilence / pox / botch / fevers / collycke / heat /
em^odes / scalle / mange / meselles / madness / loss of goods / wyndes /
blastes / waters wythering / wastyng / burning / drought / rain oppressyon /
robberye / thieves / rape / ill fortune / captyuite / e^ile / wrechednes /
subieccion / danger / prison / syckenes / strypes / shame / cowardnes /
blyndnes / error / dasynge of heart / desperacion / thou ^ht / unquietness /
toil / bondage / war / fire / swearde / battle / fear / tremelynge /
sorowgh / schorte ^ life / and sodene death both of body and soul. And all
this you weye not at all. you are so vnmarcyfull / that you care not to se them
drop headelinges in to hell. So that you have the flees / you pass not what
become neither of body nor soul. Well is that people / whom God has delivered
from such vnpitefull g^ydes. Therefore we pore wreches / owght to give most
hartye thanks unto the lord / (seeing the salt is become so unsavory) which
has geu^e us such a prince / such a feythfull Iosyas / and godly ^ynister /
that has restored again the pure word of God / and has granted us all free
passage unto it / wherein we may learn to a voyed these vices / with all other.
This word of God / is the mother perle / that we owght with all dilige^s to
seek / the pappe that we ought to suck / and the table that we should eat
upon. From thence should we fetch the sustenance of health / the bread of life
/ the wy^e of gladness / the refresshing waters / the feadinge of the sprete /
the light of the soul / yea it is the very towche stone that tries all
things. And this before time / was hydden from us / by the frye of the the
serpent / the satellytes of antichriste / the sorcerers of Egypt / with there
mynysters. Give thanks therefore yet ones again unto God^ which has in these
latter days so marcyfullye vysyted us from above / and has set owre feet in
the pathwayes of his peace. So be it.

A Christen exhortacion
IN one natural being has the lord from the beginning constitute all men to
this end / that they should naturallye love / help* / and counforte one an
another. And to the perfourmance of that his pleasure / added he this natural
law / that they should co^sydre within them selves what they would have done to
there own bodies / children / goods / or cattle / and upon that ground to
conceive a rewle how to use all other particular persons. A necessary
doctrine of love.
If they would not that men should oppress them / ill report them / shame them
before the world / hyre there howses over there heads / sell them ill wares /
begyle them by false wayght and measure / with such like / that they should in
any wise beware / least they do the same unto the. This natural law was unto
Adam / Seth / Enoch / Noe / Abraham / Moses / and other godly men / a
grounded precepte of lyuinge / who^ they evermore followed in there owtward
occupyenges. Examples of the holy fathers.


Another sort there ware which minded nothing less / and they contrary wise
/ for want of that rewle / fell in to all manner of abominable sins.
Contempners of these holy fathers.
As Ca^^ in to the unnatural murder of his brother. Genesis 4.
The gyauntes in to filthy desires of the flesh. Genesis 9. 10.
Nimroth in to cruel oppressyon and tyranny. Cham in to a scornful dysdayne
of his father. Ismael into a stubberne wickedness against all men. Esau into a
mortal hate of Jacob his brother. And such like. So that daily more and more
for decay of that law (which god hade inwardlye wryte^ in the hearts of men)
great myschefes increased. Osee. 4
And as Oseas the prophet co^playneth / there was no faythfulnesse / no
brotherlye love / no truth among men / but bytternesse / lyenge /
manslawghter / theft / and aduowterye has gotten the ouerhande. What so loved
that contempt
In there daily occupyenge was much falsehed used / and that was thought well
won good / that was gotten by deceyte. Uerye seldom in there bargaynes ware
promises performed / and more seldom a great deal / was faithful honest
regarded. In process of time therefore / were very few or none believed /
unless they took God to witness that there matter was true / where upon first
of all came vpe the swearing of oaths among men to confirm there saynges with.

An oath is no ill matter / godly used and done in love / though the f^eshe
from the beginning has abused it. What is an oath and to what end it serves.
For what is there in the world be it never so clean and good / but mennys
corrupt nature does most abhominablye de^yle. Psalm. 13.


An oath is away or mean whereby Exo. 22.
controuersyes are ended / and promyses Heb. 6
performed / by the calling upon the name of God. For it is written in the
law / if a man deliver unto his neyboure / ox / ass / or sheep / to pasture
/ and it dye / or be hurt / or driven away (no man seeing it) than shall an
oath of the lord go between them / and he shall swear whether he has put
any hand to the taking away of his neybours good or not / and the owner of
the good shall receive the oath / and if he / by the oath that he has taken
says / that he has put no hand to it / than shall he not make it good etc. And
this must be done before the gods / that is to say before the judges or
magistrates. judges ar called gods in scripture.
Here is the controuersye ended between neyboure and neyboure / through an oath.
It is also a mean whereby promyses ar performed. Genesis 21.
As we find in Genesis the.21. chapter / the words of Abimelech unto Abraham /
that he should neither hurt him / nor his posterite / unto whom Abraham said /
I will swear. And the text says / that they swear both. And Abraham ded not
only swear / but also performed it indede. This is called a right or lawful
oath / and none else. A laufull oath.
This oath is a certain kind of religion / wherewith god is not only honored /
but also / well contented and pleased. This is a sure anchore / whereunto judges
may lawfully stycke / when there wits can go no further. For who knows what
is in man / but God only? This right and lawful oath was commanded of god for
the conforte / help / and secoure of owr neyboure. And it is called the oath
of the lord / not only because he commanded it / but also when he made his
mighty promise unto Abraham he swear him self / to cause him to believe it /
not to be impossyble / at the time appointed. Genesis 22.
When a matter is in strife before a judge / necessary it is to swear / if i^
be re^red / to bri^ge it to a co^clusio^. Magistrates may on lie require it.
And in like case is it with demandinge of an oath / as with stryking with the
swearde. Lawful is it not for every private person at his own lust to slay.
Deuteronomy. 24.
But to the magistrates / when they se just cause / it is not only lawful /
but also an office of duty belonging unto them under pain of gods high
displeasure. A just comparyson.


Hely was ponnished of God / for not correctinge his children / and so was
king 1. Reg. 4. and. 15.
Saul for sparinge the people of a Malech. Luc. 22.
The princes of regions have the sword given them by gods aucthorite / not
to revenge there own private quarrel / but the just. Leuit. 19
quarrel of God and his people. For the common wealth only.
In like condition is it with swearinge. Deuteronomy. 6.
If the cause be not there is but there neybours / they may lawfullye receive an
oath / and the other required / may likewise swear in trial of the truth and
not sin. Who swears a right.
yet ought it non otherwise to be done than in the name and fere of the lord /
least we should ascribe the verite to enye other than to him. And they iustelye
swear by his name and without reprove / which myndinge neither frawde nor
deceyte / witnesses only the trewthe / which seaketh no percyalite / but the
right / not them selfs / but the glory of god / the profytt of there neyboure
/ and the common welthe of gods people. When anothe is lawful.


Lawful it is also for the magistrates / when they put enye manne in office /
to take an oath of him / that he shall be true / diligent / and feythfull
therein / as Jacob / for the co^modite and profytt of his posterite / took an
oath of Laban the idolatrer. Likewise Judas Machabe^s / of the Romans / for
the same purposse. And this is because there has been / and yet are daily
fownde so many vnfeythful. An oath of allegeaunce.
Of there subjects and commons may princes demand an oath of allegyaunce / for
the sauegard of there lands and people. And that should not need / ware there no
false traitors abroad. yet is it dyscretlye to be co^sydered in all such
publyque oaths / whether they have the.iij. aforenamed things or not. To
swear to do ill / as to slay / to rauishe / or to rob / is dampnable without
fail / and to perform such an oath / or to do those wyckednesses in deed is
a dowble dampnacion / both to him that so swears / and also to the judge that
causes him to swear. A dampnable oath.
Such a one was the cursed oath / that king Herod made / unto the dowghter
of Herodyas his harlott / for the head of holy John baptist / whom Christ
calls a vylye fox for his craftye con^^yaunce. Mar. 6.
A color was this oath / of his cruel tyranny / and a cloak to his most
spyghtfull murder. Luc. 13.
For through that means was John done unto death. Neither was an oath ordained
(after the mind of saint Austen) to bind to the perfourmaunce of manslawghter
/ robberye / idolatrye / or other sins. Ad seueru^ nuleu^anum.
Rather hade David break his oath / then to fulfill it with blood shedi^g.

A saying there is among men / that the word / promise or oath / of a king
should stand. A kings word ought to stand.
We grant the same / in case it be true / lawful / and expedient. Else
were it much better / to be broken than kept. Better were a king to eat his
word an.C. times / or to call it home again / than ones to be dampened for the
perfourmance of it / if it be wicked. For a king or rewler is not ordained to
do his own lust / but to judge according to right and equite. Psalm. 2
As open is hell for him / as for a pore mane / if he rewle not his people
godly. David brake his oath
David made a solemn oath / to slay Nabal / and to distroye all that
perteyned unto him / but he never ded perform that oath / and yet he was a
king. He put up his swearde again (says Bid) and never repented him of
any fawte done. Home. 45. Oaths are to be observed / when there end is nor
evil / nor un o^the hynderaunce of sowles health. In sinonimis 11. 2
In wicked promyses (says Is^dorus) let faythfulnes have no place. Filthye
vows ought to be broken
In a filthy vow / change thy decreed purposse. Do not the thing in effec^e
/ that thou have without consyderacion sworn unto. For the promise is
evermore wicked / that can not be performed without sin. Therefore if the
judges or rewlers should enforce the inferioure subjects to swear to that
thing that ware against sowles health or gods honor as to w^rchipe an
idolle or to an innoce^tes undoing / they ought rather to dye / than to obey
it. 2. Match. 6 and. 7.
As ded for an example the discrete man / and honorable father Eleazarus / with
the.vij. feythfull brethern and there mother in the Machabees. For much better
is it in such case to obey God than man / as witnesses Peter and the other
apostles. Act. 5.


Neither ought a judge by the law Leuit. 19
/ to compel a man to swear against himself Prou. 30
/ least he enforce him wyckedlye to sin in for swearinge himself / and so to
despair of the mercy of God. But when he takes an oath of a pore simple
soul / or of a craftye subtle fellow / he owte to consydre all circumstances
re^syte. And all such as swear oaths / ought likewise to be circumspecte and
ware. And to see always that this cla^se be added unto them. If my lord God
will or if I have no lawful imped^^^^ to the contrary. This must be added /
if god will Romans 1.
And than shall we make o^r promyses perfyght. If I should chance to appoynte
with the magistrates to come before them at ^^che an hour / and in the mean
time be let by terrible sycknesse / I should thus break no just promise
made with the / if I come not. August. de sermon d^^ in monte.
Neither should I break conuenau^te (as says saint Austen) If I promised a
payment at a day / and were ^^bed of my money by the way / comy^^e thither
ward. With such other lyke^ Never am I for sworn nor unjust of my promise
/ so long as my heart m^^deth no deceyte. God holds necessyte excusyd.
Many other such doubts and perplexe cases there be / but these I supposse for
this time suffycient. By these may all other be perceived and christianlye
ordered. Thus do we not deny / all manner of swearing / though we would non oaths
to be used betwyne neyboure and neyboure / nor yet in owre private
communicacions and daily busynesses. As herafter we shall declare more at
large. I would have written much more of this right and lawful oath / which
is commanded of God for the wealth and health of men / if other christian
learned men had not written suffycientlye thereof before. Again for so much as
the matter of it self belongs rather unto the office of rewlers and judges /
then to such private persons as I here write unto yet let both the judges /
and (...) subjects / mar^^ and observe these lessons folowinge.

First a judge / owght never to demand / or require an oath of enye man /
withca ^^e great heaviness of conscyens / for (...) at the party re^red to
swear / should for swear him self. Wha^ a iu^^ge may require all oath.
Such love and pity ought there to be in judges / that the loss of there
neyboures soul / should be esteemed equalle with the detriment of there own
sowles. Judges ought to be piteful.
Therefore before they bring them unto an oath / they owte to seek all ways and
means how to try the truth without an oath / and not immediatlye and in all
the have to cause them to swear.

Secondlye. The judge may demand an oath / and the inferioure subject
likewise swear / when it is either to the glory of god / the profyt of owr
neyboure / or for the common welthe.

Thirdly / though men be fully persuaded to have lawful and just occasions
to swear / as for the glory of god the profyt of owre neighbor / and the
commonwealth / yet may they not be i^dges in their own causes / nor take
ought here in hand / by their own aucthorite / but let the ma^ter come before
their judges for no law suffers the here to do after thine own pleasure /
and what thou thlnkest best. Mat. v. No man may be his own judge.
After this sort did Christian judges use them selves in requiringe of an oath
/ and likewise faithful subjects with a glade heart in renderinge their oath
demanded of them.

If thou be capcio^s thou will paraue^ture find cauilla^ion of contrariete in
the scripture? And say / that Moses here seems to speak contrary unto that
Christ has spoken in Matthew / the.v. Chap. Mat. 5.
Because it is said here / if any man gives to keep / ass / ox / or sheep
etc. than the oath of the Lord shall go between them / and there thou shalt
in no case swear. this was first the error of the Manacheis / whose folowers
ar now the Anabaptists. The error of the Anabaptists.
And all this comes because they understand not the sentence of Christ in
the.v. of Matthew. This word / iurare / has an other manner of signification /
than they do perceive / and is otherwise taken in the said.v. of Matthew / than
they do teach. for this is to be believed of all men / that God the father
commanded nothing that should be prejudicial or contrary his son / nor yet
that the son tawght any thing contrary his father. The agreement of Christ and
Moses.
therefore there is a swearinge which is lawful approved and commanded of God
/ of the which we have made mention before / called in latyne ius^urandum.
There is also a swearinge which is not lawful discommended / and clearly
forbyden of Christ / which What a te^erous he is.
is called / deiurium / that is temerously to swear in owre private
communication / be it true or false. And wha^ Christ says / thou shall not
swear at al / he means nothing less / than by it / to destroy all manner of
lawful swearinge before a judge / but that we should never in our private
communicacion swear. and as all manner of oaths ware not disalowed of Christ /
no more ware all oaths allowed of God the father / but such only as had either
the glory of God / the profyt of owre neyboure / or the common wealth upon
their sides. And that this is the very meaning of Christ's words / we shall
well perceive / by the weynge of the text. you have hard says Christ / how
it was said to the^ of the old tymene deteres / Where as owre translacion has
/ non periurabis / thou shalt not for swear. How periurare is taken in the.5.
of Matthew.
And not al without cause / for as periurare can never be taken in a good sense
/ so is it not always taken for the transgressinge or breakinge of a lawful
oath made before a judge. But often times it is taken for deierare / which is
to take God ^d witness / to lie / or to deceive. And periurate / is likewise
to abuse the name of God / which is the truth and righteousness / to lie / and
deceive. And what so ever he be / that either require his neyboure to swear /
or swear lightly him self / it is a sufficient prove / that he is a pariure /
ill / light / and one that little regards Gods truth. now when Christ says
/ it is said to them of the old time / non periurabis / thou shall not
forswear Exo. 20.
you shall never find in the Hebrew nor in the Greketerte that word / but so
shall you find in Moses Thou shake not take the name of thy Lord Leuit. 19.
God temerously / where as owre interpreter has so. Thou shall not take his
name in vain. ^n another place also you have after this sort. Thou shall not
swear in my name to lie. Which the Greeks interpretat after this facio^. thou
shall not swear fal^y in my name And the La^ynes has / non periurabis / Thou
shall not forswear in my name. Here you may se how saint Jerome use this word
/ to forswear / for deterare / which is to swear false. And not for the
transgressinge of a right and lawful oath It was forbidden to them of the old
time / (as you have partly hard) that they should in no case / temerouslye
take the name of God to record / which is expounded in the said.xix. of Leuit.
that they should not swear in his name to lie. The Iues thought it no sin to
swear truly
Wherout sprange this opinion among them / that if they did take the name of
God to wirnesse in the truth / and that in their daily busynes between
neighbor and neighbor) was no manner of sin. but in a false feigned matter
they thought they ought in no case to swear / nor yet compel any other man
thereunto* And this is the thing that Christ speaks here against / and
utterly reproves. that is to say / that neither in the troth nor otherwise /
they ought to take the name of God to record in their familiar and daily
communicacion. but to speak so truly / and to deal so faithfully one with
another / that if he said / yea / then his neighbor should believe him to say
truth / if he said / nay / likewise to believe it not to be truth. A Christen
ought not to speak one thing and think another.
Here you se well / is no manner of mention made of a right and lawful oath.
for Christ says / audistis / ye have hard how it was said unto them of the
old time / non periurabis / thou shall not forswear Where is this spoken? even
there whereas is nothing spoken at all / of the tra^sgressinge or breakinge of
a lawful oath made before a judge. as it shall appear^ more plainly to him that
will search the places. Therefore it is manifest that Christ spoke of such
oaths / whereby we bynd our selves temerously / to do or perform any manner of
thing. They of the old time were suffered to swear in the truth.
It follows in the terte / I say unto you / swear not at all, mark now of
what swearinge he speaks / even of such swearinge as was (for their weakness
sake) permitted unto them of the old time / by the law. for as the Iues were
suffered by the law (for their weakness sake) to be deuorced from their wives
(gyuinge them a testimonial in their hands) to avoid a further inconvenience
/ that was lest when they were moved or angrye with them / they should either
have poysonned or killed them. Deuteronomy. 6
So was it likewise permitted to the^ of the old time / to swear (but not by
all manner of creatures / but only in the name of god) least they dwellinge
among the heythen / and accustominge their oaths / should by contynuan^ce of
time fall unto the filthy worshippinge of their Idols / forgettinge him.
Exodus 23.
swear by his name (says Moses) and se that you walk not after stran^ge
gods of the nations that you remain among. Iosue. 23
S^ that you neither make mention (says Iosue) nor yet swear by the names of
their gods. Thus in the old time were they suffered to swear in an ernest
just or wayghtye cause. We may not swear if the matter be never so true
but now comes Christ and says / that neither in a t^ewe matter / be it
never so great ernest and wayghtye / we shall not of our own selves / nor by
our own aucthorite and private power / swear or promise any manner of thing.
Where as yet no manner of mention is made of a demanded oath by publyque
aucthorite. And the words that follow make the matter more p^^yne. neither by
heaven (says Christ) for it is the throne of God / neither by earth etc. Where
read you that at any time the Hebrwes did use to swear by any of these
things? And contrarywyse who now adays does not for every tryfle swear by
them all. one promise a gift by Christ's Cross / another by heaven / the
third by the earth. All this does Christ clearly forbid / and this is the
sum of all his communicacion. And where as the Anabaptists expound this to
be spoken of periurye / which is taken for the transgression or breakinge of
that oath / which is made before a judge: they are greatly deceived. for
there is no mention made / neither of the place / of the judicial seat / nor
yet of any magistrate or judge. he spoke therefore of the oaths / which we use
one with another in our familiar communicacion and language. And he that will
search the aforesaid places of Exodi and Leuitici / both in Hebrewe Greek / and
Latin / shall find it true that here is written. other reasons and arguments
they have / to take from the congregation / this lawful oath / which at an
other time shall be answered unto. The Pharise is also had blinded and
corrupted this commandment. for like as to hate in the heart / or cover another
ma^s wife / was no sin with them / no more was it to think one thing in the
heart and to speak another with the mouth. Although Moses said lie not: nor
deceive any man his neighbor. Leuit. 19
They did interpretate it but for good council / and that it did bynd no man /
under pain of da^nacion. so by that means were there none believed / onles
they took god to witness. when false / sotel and craftye merchauntes ones
perceived that for taking of Gods name to record / they were believed /
whatsoever their cause was. To bring their matter to pass they little cared to
forswear them selves. under that color cloked they all manner of
dissimulacion / falshede / and ungodliness. so that the name of God (which
ought to have been had in most reverence) was commonly than used / for a
coueringe of all their myschefes. in so much the Prophet complained and said
/ how they cowed say the Lord lives / yet did they swear to deceive. Ierem.
5.
Christ comes / and brings salt and light unto the commandementes /
restoringe them again to their own natural meaning / and right understanding
/ and as his father would have them kept / of every Christen man. for as God is
but one / so has his word or commandments but one right and true meaning
/ how so ever we turmoyle or handle them. Gods word has but one true
meaning.
And where as they had taught to hate in heart / to cover another man's wife /
and to deceive his neighbor with a lie / was not forbidden of God / under
pain of damnacion but only the outward act. But Christ says / he that is
angrye with his brother / is in danger of judgment. ^ur word and heart / ^ust
be al^ne.
He that sees a woman and lusts after. her / shall taste the punishment that
belongs to a horemonger: he that thinks one thing / and speaks another /
deceyueth his neighbor with a lie / or promise / shall have the punyshement
of a periurer. therefore I say unto you / that ye swear not at all / but let
your communicacion be / yea / yea / nay / nay. he says twyes yea / and twyes
nay / that is yea in heart / and yea in mouth / nay in heart and nay in
mouth. And if men / when that you mean truly will not believe you by your yea
and nay / let them take heed (says Basyle) for they shall taste the pain that
belongs to the unbelievers. Basyle
therefore it is both folysh and damnable / when a man can not be believed by yea
and nay / without an oath / because he would be believed to swear. Hierome
The gospel (says saint Jerome) permits no manner of private oath / because
the hole language of a Christen / should be so faithful / true and perfyt /
that every sentence thereof should be able to stand for an oath. Ioh. 3
very vnseminge is it to Christ's sworn souldyoure / more to regard the
darkness than the light. for the love that thou bear to a worldly vanite
(which thou ought not somoch to esteem) thou will take thy Lord God to
witness. And so do thou throw thy self into double danger / offending also
in an other commandment / for so can thou not do / unless thou vaynely
couete. He that swears coueteth.


And the law says / thou shall not couete. Exodus 20 Psalm. 6
Do thou not covet when thou inforcest thy self to swear for a worldly
thing? and for a vile creature take God to witness? yes trewly do thou /
and for it forsakest thy master with Judas. Psalm. 38
oh to ouermoche vanice is all the world given. Besides that is said / for
this consyderacion does Christ inhibite the all manner of private swearinge /
because thou can not do it / without some dishonor to his heavenly father.
mark the nature of thine oath / when thou does swear / and thou shall well
perceive it. He that swears dishonors God.
In tsy communicacion parauenture thou say / by God it is true that I have
said / or by the Lord that made me it is so / Here cowplest thou thy Lord God
/ with thy wyckednes / and thy heavenly maker with thy sin / without all
reverence / to shyfte the matter between the^. Psalm. 9.
se now how worshiply thou have married him. Besides all this / intaking god to
witness / thou makeste him judge of the thing to aue^ge it of the if it be
false but in the least point: Job. 34. and. 36
Thou braggest also after this sort / by my faith I will perform / that I
have promised / or by Jesus Christ I will do this thing or that thing. markewel
this short sentence of mine. God will not gyne power to any man to do or
perform that thing which is not done after his word / and here by an oath
contrary gods commandment do thou bind thy self / to do that thing
which is not in thy power to do / neither have thou God upon thy side to give
the strength to do it / because it is not done (although it were never so
true) before a judge / which Gods word requires. And so do thou lose
thy salvation / and fredome in Christ. with his name sealest thou an
obligacion / to do that thing / whereby thou art defeated of all thine
inheritance. Is this thinkeste thou a pleasant thing unto him? All this set
a part / if it should chance that some worldly troth were not in thy words /
(besides conscience) thou should utterly bleamishe the opinion of thy faith /
and to shame thy Lord Jesus / whom thou have taken to wytnes with the / for thy
truth and honest. 1. Tim. 6.
In this also do thou testify / that thou beleuest him to be no righteous
God / nor yet a judge that will ones before all the world condemn thy suttel
trade of falshed and hypocrisy.

Finally thou make as though God were well contented with thy dissimulacion /
and as though he had a great sport at the matter / to se thy crafty
conueyaunce and legerdemayne in compassinge thy Christen brother or neighbor
to deceive him with an oath / for whom Christ spared not to give his life / and
to bestow his most precious blood. Romans 14
And thus where so ever thou becomest / these.iiij. discommodites goth with the
The holy name of God is dishonored / his Esaie. 51.
Gospel of salvation is contempned 1. Cor. 1.
his sweet promyses are not believed / nor yet his sharp thre^tninges feared.
Ioh. 6
Psalm. 13
Whereas thou art in place / these ungentle fruits do thou ministre and none
other / to do thy master the deuy^^ (...) pleasure with. such a true
servant art thou unto him / that where as thou accompaniest / Christ shall
have but dishonor. Consequently when thou swearest upon the Bybel or Gospel
conteyninge the scriptures and words of God / thou comparest the truth of thy
matter / to the truth of them / and would have it so allowed. than if thou be
a liar / thou heartily desire him / not to accomplish unto thy behoue his
promyses of mercy therein contained. Deute. 28.
But contrary unto it / to bring upon the / the hole vengeance / curses and
plages therein threttened / to all ill doers. wha^ thou swearest by the body of
Christ / thou greatly dishonourest his glorified nature / includinge thy hole
health / justification / redemption / and attonemente in God. And thou do as
much as in the lies (like as the holy doctors confess) to pluck him out
of heaven with violence / and to crucify him again a fresh. When thou
swearest also by the Sacrament of God (as it is a common oath with the) both
the sweet fruits of thy Baptyme / and of the holy soupper of the Lord do
thou handle so irreverently / as thou ware at defy^unce with them both.

In like case when thou swearest by any creature / as by this son / by this
air / by this light / or by this good day / thou do not only break the
commandment of (...) Lord God / but also thou do bind those creatures
which he has mouyded to serve thy neades / to serve thy wicked vanite /
rendering him no thanks but blasphemye for his gifts. When thou swearest by
other creatures of God / as by this bread / drink / meat / or salt / with
such like. Do thou any other than blaspheme the gyuer of them? my surely. And
besides that thou destreste him to avenge them of the / if thou lie.
Peraue^ture thou will yet ask me this question / may I than swear no manner of
oath for my pastyme? yes / and if thou will in thy pastymee give thy self
hole unto the devil. We may not swear for our pastyme
But Christ has given the a straight commandment to the contrary / that
thou shall not swear at all / and showed the that if thou he his servant /
thy communicatio^ shall be none other / but yea yea / and nay nay. All other
(says he) is of evil.

Now if thou think thy wit better than his / or that he is no wholesome
teacher for the / thou may do it for thy pleasure and go to the devil for
it: who can let the. not thus contented / hapely thou will yet reason further /
and say. For so much as I know swearinge is a blasphemye / I will for my
pleasure swear by the deuylt / or by an Idolle / to spyght them with it. We
may not swear by the Devil.
I am glad thou haste ones granted me that swearinge is a spytefull blasphemy:
let it not than defyle thy Christen lips / neither spyght thy lord God with
it from henceforthe / nor yet his holy saints and creatures / consydre
first that it is thy Christen duty to be no blasphemare. And next unto this
/ that God by his express commandment has utterly forbidden the that kind
of swearing. you shall nor swear (says your lyuinge God) by the names of
strange Gods / neither let any man hear the^ proceed out of your mouths.
Deuteronomy. 6.
Exodus 23.
Neither make mention (says Iosue) nor yet swear by the names of their Gods
etc. God will refuse them for his children (says Hieremye) yea and utterly
forsake them / which swear by the^ that are no Gods. Iosue. 2.
I will destroy all them (says God by his Prophet Sophonye) that swear in
Melchon etce. Sopho. 1.
Think tha^ it is lawful for the to swear by no manner of thing / for thy
pleasure / neither by heaven nor earth devil / nor Idolle. for all that is
more than yea and nay is plainly of wyckednes. Our words are the outward
testimonies of our inward hearts. And therefore they ought to be so substanciall
/ as to be worthy a believe without an oath. So syngle and pure ought our love
to be toward our neighbor in our daily occupyenge / that no manner of
craft should be found therein. Damnable it ware to deceive our brother with
alye / and much more dampnable to seal it with a false oath. We ought to be
no longer babes.
They of the old time thought it no fault to swear in a matter of truth / but
we have now a new scole master / and ought by his own doctrine / to be no
longer babes / but to be much more perfyght then they ware. Now ought such
brotherly love to reygne among us / that one should have no stomach / heart /
nor desire / to hyndre / hurt / or displease another. The eye should seek the
profit of the hand / and the hand the commodite of the foot / as members of
one body in Christ / the one being careful for the other. The frutis of a
right Christer.
The one should be so faithful to the other / that neither should he need to
swear / nor the other need to put him to an oath. And suerlye there is none
oath made between neyboure and neyboure / but one of them / or both offends
dedly. And it is he that hears the truth and will not believe him without an
oath / and so compels him to swear / or else the other that without all
occasyo^ / inforceth him self lyghtlye to swear / or both for company sake.

Customable swearinge is very dangerous / though we ded not lie at al / for so
much as it does deprive the name Eccle. 23
of the lord of his dew reverence and fear. And so much vanite of words is
in our daily commoninge and occupienge that we have one with another / that we
can not chose but lie in many things. Prouer. 10
Which to confirm with an oath / though we intend no fraud / is to take the
holy name of God in vain / and irreverently to use it against the second
commandment. If it be dampuable of it self to lie of purposse to deceive /
how much m^^e dampnable is it than blasphemous^^e to color it with with the
name of God / besides the calling unto him for swyfte vengeance upon our
own selves for so doing. truly we little know what we do i^ such customable
swearinge. Therefore account we it necessary to admonysh you yet farther as
concerning your private swearinge. For according unto that is said before /
willed us Jesus the son of Sirach (which wrote the book of Ecclesiasticus)
that we Eccles. 23.
should in no case accustom our selves Sap. 14.
in swearing / least we fall into more deep inconuenientes / and so taste the
plages belonginge thereunto. For of custemable swearinge comes the damnable
vice of peruicy.

If a man shall use commonly to swear / he can not chose but many times
da^nably forswear him self. As he that customablye ^^nyteth / sometime he
shall smyre unto dea^he. That a man has in custom he shall do at all times /
but he shall not at all times refrain it. What the fearful sentence of God is
against swearers / the scriptures plentuously shows. The Lord (says Moses)
Deuteronomy. 5.
will not hold him giltlesse that takes his name in vain. Ero. 2.
The man that uses much swearinge (says Jesus Syrach) Eccl. 23.
shall be full of iniquire / and never shall the plage depart from his house.
All thieves and swearers are under one curse of God after zachary. Zach. 5.
Stoned was he by the law / that blasphemed the name of the Lord / in Israel.
Leuit. 24.
If the plage goes never from them which are continual swearers / how can it
go from them that are continual periures?

Tell unto me my frynde (says Ioha^ Chrysostom) what do thou profyt by thy
swearing? Homi. 44 sup Math.
If thine adversary should think the to swear aright / he would never compel
the to it. But because he thinks the thereby to become a periure therefore
enforces he the to an oath. Seldom has the private oath a good conclusion.
But happly thou will say. I cannot sell my wares / unless I do swear / or my
detter believes me not / onless I make him an oath. An obiecc^^on.
Whereunto I answer, Rather be contented to have thy wares unsold and to lose
thy money / than thy salvation in Christ. Mat. 16.
Luc. 12.
Reason faithfully with thy conscience / and let thy soul be more dear unto
the / tha^ thy corruptible substance. The soul is better tha^ wares
For though thou lose part of thy substance / yet may thou line / but if
thou lose God thou can not live. John. 5. (...). 17
A greater reward shall thou have for losinge of it in the fear of God / than
if thou had given it in alms. For that is done with pain for the love of
the Lord requires a more worthy crown than that is done without pain. 2.
Tim. 2. Apoc. 2.


Moreover I council the as my frinde (says Chrysostom) if thou be a true
Christen / that thou never compel any other man to swear. For whether he
swears right or wrong / thou art not without danger before God /
co^sydering that Christ (whose ^eruaunt thou ought to be) has given the
here a sore commandment to the contrary. Chryso^^. (...). 44.
Besides that / though his othewere true / yet is not thy conscience clear
from peruiry for so much as the matter being doubtful unto the / thou put
him to the dan^ger thereof. A great danger to swear.
And if it were false / tha^ have thou enforced him to perjury / and so for
lack of Christen charity lost both his soul and thine own / for whom Christ
suffered his death. De sermo^e domini^^n monte.
Worse is he (says S. Austyn) than an homicide / that compels a man to
swear / who^ he knows to forswear him self. For the homicide sleeth but
the body / whereas he sleeth the soul / yea two sowles rather. That is to say
/ his soul whom he compelled to swear / and his own soul for so co^pellinge
him.

O indiscreet person / what so ever thou art that compellest an other man to
swear. Little know thou what thou do thereby. Much more is it to his
profyt than to thine. Chrysos^. vbi prius.
For that periurye is to his lucre / and to thy loss. For he has the money /
nothing remaining unto the but thy part in the per^urye / with the curse and
plage thereof. He that cares not to lie / regards as little to forswear him
self. And like as he that lies offends sore the verite / so does he that
is perjured forsake both God and all godliness. Thus are the commaundmentes
neglected / and neither God nor our neighbor regarded. Why Crist forbode
swearing.
No maruele therefore though the Lord knowinge our infirmite / and how swyst
we are to cast away our sowles / did first inhibite us perjury / and than all
manner of swearinge. Gregorius in homil. quadam.
He has forbidden swearinge (says Saint Gregory) that we should the more
easily avoid all manner of occasion to periurye. He that fears God / without
an oath confesses the verite. He that fears him not / will not with an oath
confess it.

He therefore that doubts not to break Gods commandment in swearinge /
doubts not to forswear him self for a vauntage. The prestes.
Take heed also (says Chris^stome) you that will be rekened for spiritual
men. Uery swyft ye are to offer the sacred Gospel unto the^ that sweat /
where as ye ought to reach the contrary. Chrysostom. ^^prius.
If a man may not (says Origene) in every light matter swear / no more may
they that have aucthorite for every light matter compel a man to swear. How
can you be clear from perjury / that ministre the occasion? May he that
bears fire to the burninge of an house be fre from the burning of it? Or he
from the slaughter of a man that brings the weapon wherewith he is slain?
Nay surely. But he that gives occasion to perjury / must needs be a partener
in the same. Withdraw the fire / and there shall be no burninge. Co^uaye away
the swearde / and there shall be no murder committed. Seqnestor swearinge / and
there shall be no periurye. Often swearinge (says Iu^dorus) brings man to an
use. ^. 2. sol^ ^oquioru^.
And that use leads to a custom which brings in periurye. No need has the
verite of an oath / where the promise is faithful and sure.

All this is spoken for the^ that swear by the Lord temerously. ^o swear by
(...).
Much more erectable is the wickedness of them that swear by the creatures /
and more grievous the offense / than of them that swear by him only. Hiere. 5.
For heaven / earth / the elements / and creatures has he made to serve him
in man's occupienge / and not that men should swear by the^. Deuteronomy. 32.
Col. 1.
In the law is it also straightlye commanded / that Duut. 6
non should be taken to witness in the truth but God the auctor of all truth.
He therefore that swears by heaven / by earth / or by any other thing else /
he makes it equal to the verite / and so allows it for his god. For of no
less value may that thing be that is taken to witness / than is the verite
yt self which stands in trial. Hiere. 5.
A shame full idolatour therefore becomes he / that takes any other thing
than God to witness in the verite yea / though it be never so true that he
swears. Idolatrye.


For he perfourmeth not unto the lord his oath / but unto the elements and
creaturs / and so synneth double. Nu. 30
First he offends in breakinge the commandment / secondlye in that he
makes a god of that he swears by. This caused S. Hierome to say in his
co^mentarye upon saint Matthewes Gospel / that our savior ded not inhybitt
swearing by god / before a judge so that it were in a faithful cause / but by
heaven and earth by Jerusalem and our head / with such like. Hieronimus
sup^^ Matthew.
For it was granted to the people in Moses law for a rule / that like as they
were commanded to offer there sacrifyces unto God / because they should not
offer them to idols / so were they permitted to swear by there lord God.
Because it was thought better for them to geu^ there faith (which is therein
required) unto God than unto deuyls. For the Jews upon a corrupt custom /
were in^che given to swearinge by the elements.

Consydre therefore that it was not for naught that Christ commanded you
neither to swear by heaven nor earth / cy^ye nor temple / nor yet by the
hear of your own heads. Mat. 5 and. 23.
Where as the bisshoppes and spiritual lawers sytteth in consystorye / a small
matter is it rekened to swear by the lord / and therefore compel they men to
swear by the gospel as by an higher thing. To swear upon the gospel book.
As though the creature were above the creator. Not unlike to the pharisees /
which esteemed Mat. 23.
the gold offered in the temple much greatter than the temple that sanctified
the gold / and the offeringe upon the altar much better than the altar that
sanctyfyed the offeringe. In this prove they themselves not only blind / but
also blind leaders of the blind. Much more passes those beastlye bellye
Mat. 15
gods upon the feadinge of there Phil. 3.
wreached bodies than upon God which is the life of there souls. There masses
and monye sacrifyes are the cause why they esteem an oath made upon the gospel
book to be far. about that oath which is made upon the eternal God / and not
the ^eryte which the gospel contains.

O wretched idiotes Hom. 44. ^up Math.
(says Chrisostoine the scriptures are ordained for god / and not God for the
scriptures. Greatter is the lord that sanctifyeth the gospel / than the
gospel that is of the lord sanctified. The Turks or Mahometanes (whom we
reken to be a very execrable sect) has the holy name of god in such
reverence / that they never swear by it / unless they be by mos^ vrge^t
necessyte compelled. Guishelnias tripo^tanus.
Neither co^mitt they the administracion of there common welthes to any manne
whom they know to be a swearer / be he never so rich / valeaunt / wise /
learned / courragyous / or of noble birth. How that matter passes among us
Christyanes / all the world knows yea / though we say nothing of the
periurye which daily regneth among us to far and to broad. And surely this
dare I be bold to say / that all we know it is contrary to the
commandment / will / and pleasure of God. yet does the most part of us
committ it.

And they that do it not / are not ones moved with pity (as it would become al
christen men) to se there brethren so peryshe / or to se a lawful and
charitable redress for it. 1. Cor. 1^. Heb. 4.
They also which has the laws in governance / and unto who^ the judgments
are committed / seeks not by hard correccio^s the amendeme^t of it / but
every where it regneth vnponnished. A very light matter is swearige accounted
now adays in every mannys mouth / high and low / rich and poor / ruler
and comonner / pryst and clarke / woman and child / to the utter contempt of
god. Ioannes Ealisburi^ensis in po ^icra^ico.
If they be in dallyannce / play / and sport / nothing seems unto them
pleasant / fresh / nor any thing worth / no thing cherefull or fytt to be
lawghed a^ / unless the co^municacio^ be mixed with the blasphemye of gods

If a matter shall be reasoned or a storre rehearsed in a company / the tale
shall want his due circumstance / unless it be garnished with oaths.

Among the ruffeling rutters and galauntes of the world is not he rekened for
a man of noble blood / that can not swear by heaven / by the elements / by

This is the common rhetoryck / the florishinge manner of speakinge / the clean
/ fine / pure / and bewtifull language of our baptized broad / of our holy
christen commynnalte / both in lords howses and bysshoppes howses / more like
bedlem beasts than christianes / yea / more like denyls of hell than men of
reason and grace. Petrus Blesenss.
No fault fyndeth our prelates in this / nor break of christen religion /
no more than they do in the daily hauntinge of the stews and other shameful
abhominacions. But these they releace with there mass saynges for monye.
Bysshoppes.
For them that read the scriptures they can find out grenous ponnyshmentes /
but not for these enormyous excesses. This presumptuose sacrilege / this wicked
knauerye / this malignaunt myschefe against God offends them nothing at all.

The Jews tare there garments customablye when they hard gods name
blasphemed. Mat. 26.
Mar. 14.
But who among us shows any manner of toke^ that he is ones but discontented
with it? Tearinge of garments.
where are those godly laws become that were wont to be head the blasphemer
or else stone him unto death? where are the epytomes / pandectes / and
institutes of Iustiniane The swearer was be headed.
the emprour that would suffer no such offenses remain vnponnyshed? where are
the statutes ryall / that king Henrye the fyft made also for swearers with in

is now forgotten and gone.

The old philosophers abhorred the the philosophers abhorred swearing.
blasphemye of god / the poets and orators thought them worthy of greatt
ponnyshementes / and we think no thing less. Cicero wylled that neither
swearing nor promise made by oath should be used for fear of periurye. Cicero in
li. de Off.
Swear in no wise (says Periander) if thou cannist by any means avoid it.
If thou be wise (says Phocylydes) thou shall not swear with thy will / though
the cause be never so good. If the matter lies so (says Pythagoras) that thou
must needs swear / do it with greattreuerence. Periurye (says Menander) can
never be hid from God. Therefore rather lose thy matter than swear. For of
hydden periurye (says Tibullus) will a myschefe follow either at one time or
other. Tibullus li. 1. elegia 9.
Se what a dangerous matter the profane philosophers accounted swearinge that
never knew Christ / and we account i^ nothing at all. They abhorred the
wickedness of it / and we take it for a myrte pastyme.

Mean can seek out penaltees / and make new constitucions for them that
labor to know God and to live after his laws / but for them that
spyghtfullye abuse the name and glory of God / we can find non at all.
Quotidiana experiencia.
And no maruele consydering we are the right sworn children of periurye. Who
has so largely been perjured as prelates / prestes / and religious? which at
the receyiunge of there p^pishe degrees has forsworn the veryte of god / whom
in baptym they faithfully promised to stand by against all the de^yls in
hell? 1. Joan. 4.
yea / bring there laws / doctrynes / and doings unto the Galat. 6.
touch stone (which is gods word) and thou shall find that they labor
nothing else but the breakinge of that promise. Gods word tries al things.
How irreverently they have used there oath of allegeau^ce to there princes and
magistrates / I think the cronicles keeps not in silence.

When paschal^s the bishop of Rome had sworn to be true unto Henry the fort
emproure / he gave him thereupon a wrytinge / which contained also the
in^estiture of prelates. Ranulphus Cestre^sis i^ polycronica.
Not long after that / when he se his time / he called in Rome a general
synod / where as he by counsel of his spiritual sorcerers breakinge both oath
and privilege / ded excommunicate the good emproure / raised up his son
against him / deposed him / empresoned him / and fynallye caused his body to
be taken out of the ground at Leodium / and in a profane place to be beryed.
yea / after his death / the son (whom he made to persecute the father) ded
he also excommunicate and greuouslye vere. A like tragedye we have of
Fredericus Barbarossa / who^ pope Alexander the third made his fo^e stole at
venys in the church of saint Mark / in the sight of the whole multitude to
the rudiculous shame and rebuke of all the world. Abbas U^spergensis in

That he which blasphemeth should be stoned / and then hanged up by the space
of one day / and so taken down and buried without all manner of honor. In
paralipomena rerum memo rabilium.
Maximi lianus the emperor made also a decree / that what so ever he ware /
that was a common swearer should for the first time lose a mark / and if he
ware not content with that / should lose his head / which act he and the
states of the empire commanded to be publyshed.iiij. times in the year at
estern / whytsontyde / assumpcion of our lady and at cristemas.

In certain regions are yet to this day oaths so restrained / that what so ever
he be that swears / he shall either lose a fyngar / an ear / or else his
tongue. For periurye was the noble cite of Troy lost / as witnesses not only
Uirgyle with other profane auctors / but also S. Austyn in his third book and
second chapter de cuntate Dei / and so has many other cytees else. Many
cytees has been destroyed for periurye. Ide^ Augustinus.
Tullius cicero has in his first book de officijs / that Marcus regulus a
Ramane and a Pagane regarded so much an oath that he ones made / that he had
rather to throw him self into most miserable captivity and cruel death of
his enemies tha^ to break it / and so to become a periure. Saint Aus^yn
affyrming the same also in his first book / and.xv. chapter de cuntate dei.

A wonderful narracio^ has S. Greg. in the ^or^ book of his dyaloges / of a
child of.v. years of age being in his fathers arms possessed of a denyll
for swearinge and blasphemynge the name of God. Besides the terryble examples
of the scripture / in Nemroth / Pharao / Hieroboam / Sennacherib / Benedab /
Achab / Nab^chodouosor Holofernes / Antiochus / Nicanor / Herod / and s^che
like. The son of the Israelytishe wydowe was for blasphemynge of the name of
God stoned unto death in the desert. Leuit. 24. The blasphemer was stoned
For blasphemye of the servants of Sennacherib the king of the Assyrianes
ded the angel of the lord (...) h^ndred and.iiij. 4. Reg. 19
score thousand of his hoos^e. 4. Reg. 10.
The wicked queen Iesabel was for the same vice thrown out of a wyndowe /
trodde upon with horses / and had her flesh deu^wred of dogs. Herodes
antipas for be headinge Johan baptist Mar. 6,
to perform his wicked oath / was eryled into leons / and there departed in
most miserable periurye. Mar. 19.
In swearinge ded Peter both deny and forsake his lord and master Jesus
Christ. Consydre by these and by other like examples / what the abomination of
swearinge is / and what vengeance of the lord hangs over it.

The Seytheanes and Partheaues with other Heythen people had laws against
lyenge and swearinge / whom they would in no wise dysobeye. We have the great
commandment of God with the gospel of Jesus Christ / which are laws far
passying there laws. Exo. 20. Leuit. 19. Mar. 5.
What devil of hell shall hold us back more than them / that we shall not
regard them? If we have a lord God which create al at the beginning / and
now gouer^eth all to our behoue. If we have a father which has loved us / a
Christ which has redeemed Romans 8.

conforteth us / where is the faithful obedience we owe them? Joan. 15.
If he be our god / why do we not fear him. If he be our heavenly lord /
why do we not honor him? If he be our father / why do we not hartelye love
him? If he be omnipotent / why do we not reverence him? If he be wise / why do
we not learn of hi^? If he be just of his promise / and true of Plsa. 10.

If he be a master / why do we not serve him? Joan. 13.

yea / why do we not ones amend / at his most fearful thretteninges? Is it in
the gospel ernestlye spoken unto us Christyanes / or unto dead stones? Let
your communicacion be yea / yea / and nay / nay. What so ever is more than
that / (...) comes of the very devil. Not unto a rotten post / nor yet unto
a dumme beast was it said. Deuteronomy. 5.
Thou shall not usurp the name of the lord God in vain. Exo. 20.
For the lord will not hold him gyltlesse that blasphemeth his name. Eccl. 23.
The plage shall not depart from the house of the swearer. But it was spoken
unto us / to whom God has given reason / discression / remembrance /
understanding / wit / conscience / faith / and grace / if we will apply our
selves to the occupyenge of them. A man that were in trauase of land and
should lose it unless he told his tale wisely / would take good head unto his
words rather than he would lose it. And we for losing our sowles / (which
Christ to witness / are much more precious (will take no head at all / but
Mat. 6.
through cure blasphemous language / and Luc. 12
daily swearinge suffer all to go unto naught.

We much maruele many times that Derth / wa^rre / and pestilence.
the lord does ponnishe us with derthe / war / pestilence / and cruel
ex^^cio^s of tyrauntes. But we ought much more to maruele / that heaven
reyneth not wyldefyre and brymstone upon us as upon Genesis 19.
Sodom and Gomorre / and that the earth Number. 16.
opens not upon us and swalowe us in with Chore / Dathan / and Abiron / for
so irreverently using the name of God with our outragynge tongues / as the
filthy mire in the streets that we spurn forth with our fe^e. Plsa. 85.
Oh / how could the lord suffer soche iniurye / were he not eternally^
mercyful? Iohel. 2.
how could he patiently bear it / were he not gracious / pytefull / long
sufferinge / and rydye to pardone wickedness? Soche contynuall swearers may
well be compared unto those spyghtfull torme^tours that spailed in Christ's
face / that mocked Mat. 26.
him with a read / crowned with Mar. 14.
thorn / and saluted him with / Aue ra^bbi. Nor unlike also are they unto
those pratlynge Jews and scornful hypocrytes / prestes Luc. 23.
and pharisees / that went Mat. 27.

Receive your meat without grudging
Take heed ye never abuse the same.

What so ever ye do in word or deed / do all en the name of our lord Jesus

A short instruction to the world.
To Kings and Princes.
Be letned ye kings and understand
Enbrace the truth of Christ's word
your hertes be all in Gods hond
He is your king / your prince / and lord.
Stablish no law that makes discord
But do as did king Ezechias /
David / Iosaphat / and Josias.
To Judges.
Accept no person in judgment
Wrest not the law / keep well your syse
To wrong for brybes do not consent.
For they do blind the eyes of the wise.
Thus scripture bids you more then twyse
And for to have such properties
As Iethro told to Moses.
To Councelours.
A faithful man will keep council
And there is wealth where many such be.
Beware of false Achitophel.
The council of God must stand truly.
ye can it not destroy verily.
Keep truth and faith with secretnesse
And further the cause of godliness.
To Chamberlaynes.
Beware of Thares and Bagathan
Lest treason in the chamber be sown.
For if the court be ruled by Aman
Poor Mardocheus is overthrown.
but wha^ the truth is thoroughly known
He shall be found a faithful iue
And to his prince a subject true.
To Stewardes.
Spend not your masters goods i^ vain
But be faithful in your office
For though ye take therein some pain
ye have of Christ a sweet promise
Keep well your reckoning more and less
Be faithful ever in great and small
And Christ will you good stewardes call.
To Treasures.
ye that have treasure in your kepinge
Committed to you for a season.
Be always sure of your reckoning.
As equity wylleth and good reason
Jesus Syrac taught this lesson.
To set a lock where many hands be /
It is no shame ner dishonestie.
To Controllers.
Go through the court for Christ's sake.
And where ye spy any thing abused.
Do your office / and some pain take
That ydilnesse may be refused
Great men's howses are accused.
To be infecte with uncleanness.
With pride / with oothes / and with excess.
To Prestes.
Flatre not at al / but preach gods word
Rebuke every evil condition
Thynk on your duty to god the lord
And forget not his commissyon.
Hyde not the truth for promocyon
Be true apostles in word and heart
And play not secretly Judas part.
All other officers great and small
Whose whole dewtyes I do not know
Does gods word ascyte and call
Whether their estate be hye or low
None in his calling to be slow
But every man in his business
To watch and work with faythfulnesse
And within the foresaid doctrine
Is contained the whole duty
How all subjects should draw the line
Of faith / of truth / and honestye
And no man for to go awrye
But every one in his living.
To show the fruit of gods learning.
Where any vice now is occupied
Within this world as there is much
It should rightwell be amended.
If all rulers would rebuke such.
And if preachers the quyck would touch
Where men are now in sin so ryfe
They should right gladly me^de their life
And if all other officers
Will do their best / and be diligent.
Then shall they have right good lyuers
And folowers of gods commaundment
Of good warnyng follows amendme^t
Which I pray god us grant and give
That we with him in heaven may live.
Amen.
