ISAACKS PILGRIMAGE A brief and short Treatise, of the strife that Isaac had
with his heard-men, living in the Land of the Philistims, with Abimeleck and
his heard-men, shadowing out the strife which Christ our Lord had with his
heardders, and with the Romayne Philistims, which has continued unto this day,
though now in a deep consumption.

ALSO A testimony from the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles, of the
abolishment of Antichrist, the man of sin, whereby the Godly shall behold as
in a glass, how the work of God goes forth, for the accomplishing of the
same, which in due time shall be finished.

The Law does Paull a Shadovv call,

Whose substance was in Christ,

Isaac no doubt, typed him out,

Of types one of the Highest.

To the Christian Reader in general, grace and good understanding from God the
Father of mercy, through Christ our Lord and Savior, Amen.
OUR loving Lord and Savior sitting now at the right hand of his Father,
having all power in Heaven and earth, according to his promis made here on
earth, powereth out of his Spirit upon all flesh in these last days; but not
to all alike, to one he gives five tallents, another two, and to some but one,
yet would not that one should be buried, for he will ask proffit of all: And
his worthy Apostle and chosen vessel Paul uses these words for counsel,
saying; As every one has received, as a good disposer, distribute of the
manifold gifts and graces of God. Which words with other the like in the
Scripture, have emboldned me to bring that my small tallent to the bank,
beseeching the Almighty to make it proffitable to his glory, and comfort to so
many as it shall please him; desiring the friendly Reader to try all things by
his Word, and keep the best, and through love bare with my weakness. And thus
end the Epistle.

Isaacks Pilgrimage.
AS Isaac typt the Prince of peace,
He had great trouble in his life,
Though God him blessed, gave him increase,
Yet he had almost lost his wife,
Rabeckas bewty stirred strife,
Those people thought she was a maid;
And Isaacks words they were so rise,
Which to this King so much had said,
Because be dwelt by them in fear,
Told him that she his sister were.
But at the last truth came to light,
As he out of his window lay,
Had these two persons in his sight,
And did behold their sport and play.
Then he to Isaac thus did say,
Why toldest thou me such a thing,
One of my folk had almost lay
With this thy wife. And then this King
Told his men, it would cost his life
That touched Isaac or his wife.
Then Isaac he did sow his land,
Found hundredfold increase that year,
God blessed all things he took in hand
Whereat this people angry were,
And King Abimeleck did fear,
Said, thou art mightier then we.
So Isaac went to Gerar there
At his returning back did see
The wells full earth his father made,
Which is the Romish heardmens trade.
Those heardmen gave them other names
Then Abraham had given before,
Which after turned to their shames.
These wells brought Isaac trouble more
Then all his wealth, though he had store
For water he could hardly want,
His cattle would be quickly poor,
For water in that land was scant,
He got these wells, again was glad,
Gave them the names before they had.
Then Isaacks servants dig'd a new,
And found a living water spring,
Which troubled that cursed crew,
Great strife arose about this thing,
The men of Gerar there stryving,
Told Isaacks men this was their own,
But seeing they no proof could bring
By name of strife this well was known,
Yet after this dug another,
Strived for it as for the other.
So Isaac did remove from thence
Dug one for which they strived not,
He saw Gods helping hand from whence
He larged was, and room had got,
A fruitful place fell to his lot,
Who said that now he should increase,
Thereof he wanted not a jot,
For afterward he lived in peace
From thence went to Bersheba right,
And God appeared to him that night.
And thus the Lord to Isaac said,
I am thy Fathers God said he,
And therefore be thou not afraid,
For I will bless and bide by thee,
Increase thy seed this shall thou see,
Who did which him a Covenant make,
With many words that did agree,
That this was all for Abraham's sake.
Then Isaac did these things record,
An Altar built called on the Lord.
Abimeleck then to Isaac went,
Which Captain Phicall called by name,
And Isaac asked his intent,
Because for strife from them he came;
These words might make him blush for shame.
He saw the Lord with Isaac was,
He came for peace, and sought the same,
Isaac agreed, it came to pas,
In feast they each to other swore,
And after fell at strife no more.
An Answer with APPLICATIONS.
LEast some should say, from former words,
From Isaacks strife we see no light,
There is no mention made of swords,
Or how to use the same aright.
For answer here we shall resight,
His father Abraham took pain,
Went forth against 4 Kings to fight,
And brought his kinsman Lot again,
For Abraham shadowed out the Highest
But Isaac was a type of Christ.
Christ was indeed the Prince of peace,
And yet was drive from place to place,
Who came his captives to release,
Which then did lie in woeful case,
He shed his blood to purchase grace,
For such as would obey his word,
From poor in spirit, turned not his face,
Nor against his foes used temp'rall sword,
Isaac was on the Altar laid,
But Christ the Lamb the debt has paid.
And as Abram for to refresh
Isaac his son diged wells store,
Even so ere Christ came in the flesh,
His Father had provided more,
The Prophets all did labor sore,
Which were the wells that did much good,
Who long had told of Christ before,
That he should open by his blood,
The fountain of eternal life,
For which now at this day is strife.
When Christ his work had finished,
For which he came down here beloe,
And had all power obtained,
His holy Spirit did bestoe,
Endued his Disciples so
With heavenly wisdom from above
Which learned men his will to know,
And how to live in peace and love,
Which brought dead me^ unto new birth,
Then was a Paradise on earth.
Like wells were his Disciples all,
From whom came much good water forth,
But 4 of them were principal,
Like Eden Rivers of great worth:
From East to West, from South to North,
Like lively fountains did refresh
Each thirsty soul throughout the earth,
And were great comfort to all flesh.
Christ garden thereby was then green,
Sweet erbs and flowers there were seen.
Then came the Philistims of Rome
Like those that stopped each former well,
Who when so soon as they were come
And these wells saw, at strife they fell,
For they did then Christ's heard-men tell
These wells were theirs, and did belong
To them, lo thus they did rebel,
And in short time they grew so strong,
They drove Christ's heard-men all away,
And stopped these wells with earth and clay.
Lo then the Gospel was near gone,
Which had the Lord great labor cost,
By Matthew, Mark, by Luke and John
Was written through the holy Ghost,
Of Christians grief this was the most,
To see their Bibels burnt with fire,
And also their life water lost
For Rome had then got her desire
For thirsty soul their was no sup,
But dye or drink of Babels cup.
Yet were their many waterstreames,
That ran from Rome to every place,
For Gospels truth they sent forth dreams
Which were excepted in like case.
Until such time the Lord by grace
Brought his Gospel again to light,
Which their inventions did deface,
Lo then they fell again to fight,
For to suppres his holy word,
And to mainteyne their cause by sword,
Of late he sought to quench the light,
In such as lived in his land,
Or else to put them all to flight
That would not take his mark in hand,
And also be at his command,
And walk with sered conscience,
But he shall see and understand
The Lord comes forth for their defense,
His captives now shall be releast
From this tyrant and bloudly beast.
His wise do make him still so blind,
He cannot see Gods heavy hand,
Seeks many means, but none shall find
To keep Christ's captives in his lands,
Still brakes his cords and lovely bands
His wells are full of earth and clay,
No Gospels truth he understands,
And drives his heard men still away.
This cause makes Christians Kings to fight,
For it does ask the sword aright.
God gives the same into their hand
His Church and people to defend,
And David lets them understand
Their great reward at their works end,
Wills Kings and Judges ear to lend,
And shows to them Gods decree,
To kis the son he does them send,
That from his wrath ye may be free.
When it shall burn as flaming fire
To give his enemies their hyer.
Thus Isaac strife did shadow forth
The strife which now we hear and see,
And Daniel a man of worth,
Declares a dream that does agree,
The Apostle Paul and John those three,
Do well describe that bloody beast,
His life and course and how that he
Shall end, and Christ's captives releast,
And so this story here we end,
The Reader to another send.
WIth loves intent I here present
To Queen Elyzabeth,
For whom I pray from day to day,
And shall while I have breath.
Trusting to see your Majestee
Led by the God of grace,
From here to part with joyful heart
Unto your resting place.
The time is near by sins appear,
Which here we shall make known,
Christ does arise, whose enemies
Must all be overthrown.
That man of sin, who did begin
To quench the Gospels light,
Who in Paul's time begun to clime,
True Christians put to flight.
Come to his heigh, yet by Christ's breath
Consume and perish shall,
Who now does fume, and yet consume
True are the words of Paull.
Who does profes Christ in brightness
Of Gospel shall appear,
And by his word, as with the sword,
Shall him abolish clear.
The Prophets old these things foretold,
And chiefly Daniell,
Whose prophesy this mystery,
Does touch, and open well.
His king had sight of things by night,
Whereat he was dismayed,
Which he forgot, and did thereat
Make all his wise afraid.
This King was great, Babell his seat,
It was Nebugadnezer,
We write here short, for your comfort,
The story read at leyzer.
The Lord then told, and did unfold
To Daniell this dream,
Which at this day does keep his way
Like to a running stream.
This Daniell the King did tell,
That he upon his bed
Could take no rest, but was oppressed,
Strange things came in his head.
His might and seat was large and great,
He was exalted hie,
And feign would know how it should go,
When as he came to dye.
The Prophet than forthwith began
His vision to unfold,
Said he saw stand one like a man,
Whose head was of fine gold.
His arms and breast of silver best,
His thyes and belly brass,
His legs iron, he stood upon,
His feet and tooes alas.
Iron and clay that could not stay,
Or make it long to stand,
For from a mount, a stone of count
Was taken without hand.
Fell on his feet, as it was meet,
For then he needs must fall,
Then were they found, to powder grong
These mighty Monarks all.
Thus broken all in pieces small,
Long there they did not stay,
For then the wind thereto assynd,
Did drive them quite away.
Which being gone, this worthy stone,
Became a mighty mount,
That filled the earth brought in new birth,
A work of great account.
The dream here ends, and this depends
Which Daniell did unfold,
He did relate, this Kings estate,
Who was this head of gold.
O King, said he, now after thee
Another Kingdom shall
To silver he may likened be,
That third rulles over all.
Although but brass, it comes to pas,
He rulls over the earth,
The fourth shall be stronger then he,
But not of so great worth.
He is Iron, regards none,
But treeds all under foot,
In pieces break, and spoils the weak,
And seeks all out to root.
But that his strenght, begun at lenght
To fall into decay,
For why his feet were macht unmeete,
As Iron is with clay.
This clay was then the seed of men,
Which he did join withal,
And suffered them to live by him,
Least they should work his fall.
For it is found, he had a wound,
That came from Gospels light,
Who brought to pas, it healed was,
Through this his subtle flight.
Whose present state, we shall relate
He lately changed his mind,
With clay could he no longer gre,
His wise had made him blind.
Of that image, in this our age,
The feet alone remain,
And at this day, we see the clay,
Does fall from him again.
Like Eagle he, begins to flee,
Is driven from place to place,
His fothers fall, both great and small,
His young in woeful case.
He must feel smart, he is last part
Of that red bloody beast,
For his works all, reward he shall
Receave at Hesters feast.
The time near is, an end of his,
By sins that do appear,
Which Christ has told, that makes us bold,
To say the time is near.
This stone is Christ, Son of the Highest,
Who now comes forth to fight,
With his own word, as with a sword,
To bring again the light.
This stone shall grind the wilful blind
The Iron with the clay,
The Gospels wind, that shall they find,
To drive them all away.
For then forewindes, shall in their kinds
Bloe over all the earth,
To waken such, as fleepe too much.
And bring them to new birth.
Christ is the stone, we build upon
Who will perform this all,
There shall not mis, one word of his
The heavens shall rather fall.
He to the Jews these words did use,
From David's words of old,
He them asked, how they had read,
And did this thing unfold.
Told them anon, how that the stone
The builders did refuse,
Was chosen forth, and of great worth,
In house of God to use.
He told them well, who thereon fell
Should geat a deadly wound,
But every one, it fell upon,
Should be to powder ground.
He fallen is, for good of his,
And does like milestone grind,
Search in his word, which gives record,
For truth you shall it find,
And mind withal, the words of Paull,
Which we before resight,
They are so strong, Christ's foes er long
Shall be abolish quite.
Some may ask who this work shall do,
The which we shall declare,
This to fulfill, and do Christ's will,
Ten horns appointed are.
These we horns call, are not Kings all,
Though Christ the name afords,
Kings did begin, this work werein
Are Princes, Dukes and Lords.
Which heretofore the beast upbore,
Their power did abuse,
Whom he releast, took from the beast,
In this his work to use.
He them converts, put in their hearts,
For to perform his will,
Which did consent incontenent,
And shall the same fulfill.
These hate the whore, and will no more
Drink out of Babels cup,
But eat her flesh, which is the trash
That must be burned up.
And naked she, at least must flee,
Her wealth consumed quite,
Both spiritual, and temperall,
And forced to take her flight.
The beast were on she sat upon,
With all his bloody train,
Her false prophet, shall none unset,
For they shall both be tayne.
Yet some shall fear, and drove Christ near,
And leave that wicked race,
Won by his word, that lovely sword,
Which he will save by grace.
The others al, both great and small,
What favor can they cleme,
Sixth plages no doubt, one them cast out,
And yet they do blaspheme.
Now these horns ten, Kings and great men,
Are not all in one land,
God does such call, in Kingdoms all,
To take his work in hand.
The whore her seat, is large and great,
As Nations peoples tongues,
In places all the Lord bring shall
What to this work belongs.
The Denmarks King, begun this thing
And his labor much cost,
One feigned friend, did at the end,
Make all his labor lost.
Yet for all this, he would not cease,
But sent his son for aid,
Which lost his life their in the strife,
Which shortly was betrayed.
The King of Swede came forth to aid,
The captives their distressed,
Who sought each way from day to day,
To bring them to their rest.
This worthy horn like unicorne,
Did lead the others one,
That they went forth like men of worth,
With currage have they gone.
This King at rest, and doubtless blessed,
This changes not the case,
Want of one man not hinder can,
Another comes in place.
His Kingdom still strive to fulfill
The work which he begun,
So shall each horn the like perform,
Until this work be done.
This work of worth, shall still go forth,
The horns have took in hand,
Which is we see for to set free
Christ's captives in each land.
For Pooll nor Spain shall long remain,
Nor yet the Eag'ls grace,
Chief members in that man of sin,
Which would Gods truth deface.
Nor Rome the seat, though it be great
For it must have a fall,
Gods work of grace shall now take place,
And overthrow them all.
Though they cry peace, they do not cease,
But seek with treachery,
To win the prise, but all their lies,
God daily does discry.
With that their net, which now they set,
They will be taken all,
They dig a pit, and into it,
Themselves shall shortly fall.
Except they cease, and seek true peace,
With King Abimeleck,
But this we know, they will not do
Till Christ do bow their neck.
That work to end, we do commend,
Unto the Lord of life,
VVishing that we, an end might see
Of this their bloody strife.
True Christians all both great and small
Ought for this thing to pray,
That God these rocks, and stumbling blocks,
Would take out of the way.
That his Gospel, might prosper-well,
And bring in peace and love,
Which we must seek with prayer meek
It comes from God above.
O might we see the Teachers gree,
Which long have left the whore,
Labor with love, things rightly prove,
And so Christ's truth restore.
Paull having told how manifold
Gods gifts are from above,
And says withal the principal
Is faith that works by love.
True love this day is in decay,
Men seek for worldly wealth,
Stryving for it, their souls forget,
Seek not Gods saving health.
True love says John found in each one
Their faith will God approove,
He dwells in them, and they in him,
For God himself is love.
Sought of him then like childeren,
This gift for to inherit,
He would it give, that we might live,
And worship him in spirit.
Community, in unity,
Would then confirm our faith,
The bands of love, then we should prove,
Would hold it fast Paul says.
Knowledge without love, makes men stout,
It makes them spiritual blind,
Love is lowly, and not lofty,
Her speeches very kind.
Her prophesy will edify,
Whereby she may be known,
Her words are food, seeks each one good,
So ernest as her own.
This love in heart, shall not depart
From such as love the Lord,
But love in tongue, cannot last long,
This like a rotten cord.
And such their be, this day we see,
In this course cannot stay,
Whose words are fair, yet like a snare
To draw men's hearts away.
From Gospells truth, in age or youth,
Or else give them no rest,
But wise will try, things carefully,
And keep that which is best.
Leave of this toil, and rest a while,
This strife shall likewise end,
There shall come peace, this strife shall cease,
With such as now contend.
When God has laid, as he has said,
Christ's fooes at his foot stoelle,
Then those now learn, shall then deserne
The wise man from the fool.
And hear new things, for all plantings,
Not planted by the Lord,
He will root out, there is no doubt,
For Christ has spoke the word.
His testament, must us content,
As it was given at first,
Who puts to, or takes fro,
Shall find himself accursed.
The Gospel says, how that Moses
Was faithful found in all,
How much more Christ, in his house highest,
A Prophet principal.
Our talent small, now showed all,
This is our hearts request,
That each would try, it lovingly,
And keep those things are best.
FINIS.
