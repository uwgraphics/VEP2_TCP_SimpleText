A true Relation of the Travels of M. Bush. a Gentleman: who with his own
hands without any other man's help made a Pynace, in which he past by Air,
Land, and Water: From Lamborne, a place in Barkshire, to the Custom house Key
in London. 1607



London printed by T. P. for Nathaniel Burter, 1608.

To the Reader.
IN different Readers, whose judgments are sophistically mixed with humors, or
conceits, as many are now a days, who are more ready to condemn with their
turbulent tongues, then to amend with sensible judgments: As for them, or any
such carpers, I am reasonably persuaded to set as lightly by their censures, as
they are far from conceiving well of any thing, but what agrees with their
own humors, or fictions. To those that are of more plausible spirits, who (for
the most part either say little, or conceit the best, and either applaud what
is good, or pass over with silence what is not hurtful: And to those that
having some understanding themselves in this Art, as either Nauigators, or
Shipwrights, and are desirous to be partakers of the Experiments and Practices
of other men's knowledge. To the one I commit the censure, to the other the
profitte of this Trauellors labors: knowing that such as are wise, will rather
wink at samll faults, then rashly reprove what may pleasure others. Though
such as are curious, and think themselves sufficiently expert in this Art,
find nothing herein contained that may satisfy their expectation: yet the
Gentleman's hope is, they will judge favorably of his intentions and
proceedings, and pass it over with patience, for affections sake to the Art
it self: and hereafter doubts not but to do them more profit and pleasure in
matters of some other deep performances. If any think, that what this book
speaks, is very strange; he may see the very title says as much: And it is
good for an Author to be as good as his title. If any think it is but a Tale,
and no truth, I cite you my Talesmaister, (which is more then most men will
do.) And he to avoid every such imputation, has his confirmation hereof,
under the hands and seals of the chiefest of the Custom house in London,
besides many thousand witnesses in the Country. Then sit down and read it, if
it do not profit thee, yet his trust is, it shall not displease thee.

A. N.

A True relation of the travels of William Bush gent: that without more help
then his own, made a Pynace, by which he past by Air, Land, and Water: No man
ayding, or assisting him.
THe Be, by serious industry, gathering a certain hidden virtue from sundry
sorts of flowers and herbs, and making thereof (by labor and travel,) a
material lump, namely, the Honny-combe; is not therefore to be condemned of
any, but rather highly to be commended of all. The Physician of many simples,
making one compound medicine, does not only reap profit to himself by the
same, but purchases commendations, and applaudities of others. And the
studious Reader, out of sundry Authors does select some chief principles,
which he records as memorials, either to advantage himself, or to add
pleasure to others.

Of these three comparisons: The first is excellent for imitation in general.
The second very necessary for diverse in particular. And the last, though not
so highly esteemed of the common sort of people, by reason of their ignorance
in Arts, and Sciences: yet for the good that may come thereby to a common
wealth, nothing inferior to the best: Especially where the study tends to
good and vertuons exercises, or the practice and contemplation thereof to
laudable Arts, and experiences: Of which Arts, namely, Mathematical; the
practice of Navigations is a principal member: as having participation in
Arithmeticke, Geometry, Geography, Cosmography, and Astronomy, or rather (to
say the truth) the quintessence, yea the very proof and trial of them all:
For albeit men read or here never so much of Cosmography, or Astronomy, yet
without practice and experience it is imperfect. And how can perfection be
attained, but by making use and transporting from place to place, thereby
beholding the diversities of days and nights, with the temperature of the
Air in sundry regions, by which the whole course and revolution of the
sphere, is made apparent to man's capcity? Seeing therefore that the same Art
and skill is not performed, either by rashness of chance, or strangenes of
miracle, but according to certain universal precepts, or documents derived
from the mathematical fountains, being the very essential matter and
substance thereof; I thought good (being entreated thereunto) not to omit a
most strange, and well deserving labor, of no less worth than wonder, effected
and brought to pass by a Gentleman of our own country: The which (but that
we are very much adicted to admire strange, and contemn our own, according to
the old proverb: Forsooth it must needs be true:
For I have learned it of a Jew.)
would beget as good an opinion amongst us: for first inuenting the same, as
that same miraculous instrument did amongst them of Amelphis, reported of by
Pandulphus Collenutius, in his Neapolitane history.

Not therefore to beguile Expectation, without any longer continued prea^ble of
his practices, I make no doubt but upon relation of his aduenturous and strange
Uoyage, you will join in admiration of his skill, and fortune.

Insomuch, as such as have conferred with the skilfullest Nauigators of our
Land: with such as have been principal Actors in our furthest North-east, and
North-west discoueries: with such as have been in the South Sea, and at the
Cape of Bona Speranza, could never report of such a performance as this
gentleman's, which for rarenes, has the wonder and approbation of all men, and
for truth, the confirmation of many thousand eyewitnesses.

And it was this.
With a few tools, or instruments, and with his own hands (no man in the
least measure ayding or assisting him) he framed and fashioned a Pynace by his
cunning and skill Mathematique and Geometrical, which without the help either
of man, or beast to move the same forward, past by Air, Land, and Water, only
by his own industry, and labor, viz. Threescore yardes in the Air, Six and
Twenty miles upon the Land, and an hundredth miles upon the water.

The true manner of this Pynaces devises for her proceedings in the Air.
FOr her passage in the Air she had two strong Cables almost of Threescore
and six yardes in length, and an hundredth weight a piece, straned by
wyndlesses, and other strange, and unheard of devises very stiffely from the
battlements of the Church Tower of Lamborne in the County of Berke: being a
Tower of great height, above an hundredth foot distant one from the other, just
the breadth of the Pynace, to two trees in the same Churchyard an hundredth
foot likewise distant from the Tower: On which Cables or Ropes the Pynace did
slide, with certain iron ringes on either side the same framed for that
pupose, and diverse other engines that caused her (by one man's strength in her)
without other help to mount up to the top of the same Tower, and to descend
again to the ground at his pleasure: and that with great facility, although
the beholders judged it at first as possible as to quench fire with fuel,
drown an Eagle with water, or extinguish a burning ague with hot wines.

There was likewise a frame of Timber upon the top of the Tower, to which
the maine great Cables were fastened with windlesses, and other devises in it;
Another frame also of Timber was fastened deep in the earth with windlesses,
and other Engines to strain the ropes, and assist the Pynace in moving by
other devices: Two ropes turned in the windlesses upon the top of the Tower
and in the foresaid frame with counterpoises in pullyes, to assist the motion
of the Pynace, and to cause her to move by degrees either ascending, or
descending. Thus, Art joined with industry and labor, turns to good effect
and purpose, exercises of most ambiguous doubts and difficulties. The skillful
Marryner who has read many books of Navigations, unto his skill must of
necessity add labor and frauell, else it nothing avails: But compared to a
burning candle, that (hild under a bushel) yeeldes no light, or comfort. Art
is the induction, and plat-forme: But Travel, and Labor bring all things to
good end, and perfection.

The manner of her proceeding by land.
THis Pynace that thus serves to such several uses, as Air, Land, and Water,
might seem to perform things not to be marshalled within the lymits and
bounds of humane reason, and to be incomprehensible unto man's sense, and to
lead and carry it away captive to astonishment and admiration; but that he,
that distributes knowledge and understanding among men, according to such
measure, times, and means, as seem best unto himself, opens the eyes of
belief. The causes therefore known, the wonder may cease.

For the Pynaces passage by land she had four wheels, all made and framed by
this gentleman, whereof three served to carry her, and the fourth turned in
her, with diverse other Engyns that caused her by one man's labor and strength to
pass forward either up a hill, or in deep way, and he himself in her.

Her wheels were thus placed, two of them being four foot and an half high,
were set in the forepart of the Pynace on either side one, upon a square iron
axeltree: The third turned in a frame of three foot high, and was fastened by
devises at the hinder part of the Pynace, directly under the Stern, with which
he would make such swift speed on land, as many followed to behold him, and to
witness with their eyes, what their thoughts could not conceive to be
credible. But as, Ea habentur optima, quae and iucunda, honesta, and vtilia, So
this workman, so highly commended, and respected for this piece of
workmanship, traveled up and down with as great a troop after him, as are
commonly congregated upon any feriall* or festival assembly, which may happily
work such good effects in some of them, that (as Tacitus reports the
Germans to have encouraged themselves to the wars, with seeing, and singing
the worthy wonders and heroical exploytes of Hercules.) So some may be drawn
by example of his industrious endeavors, and labor to lay aside, and shake of
the fruitles imbracementes of Idleness, and betake themselves to such necessary
experiments as may worthyly tend to praise, profit, or pleasure.

The manner of her proceeding by Water.
TWo things, are in every instrument or vessel of special and most necessary
consideration: The one, The body (as it were) and substance of it: The other,
The end, and purpose whereunto it serves: The body and substance of every one,
as namely of this little Pynace (whereof is now spoken) we may call the
Material parts of which it consists, with their particular forms, such* as
whereby that end may be best attained: I mean best, both with the greatest
certainty, and most possible facility: The Purpose, or end, we may term,
either the commodities to be reaped thereby, or the sin guler and pleasant
uses whereunto it is or may be applied. The material parts of this little
Pynace being already set down, with some parts of the uses, the rest follow
thus.

For her passage by water, she was very carefully calked, and pitched to keep
the water forth: She had also a seat placed in her, just in her middle part,
and doubtless right opposite one against the other: she had oars likewise of an
equal length and weight to row her with, and four mastes and yardes of the
most fine light timber that might be had, or procured: she was orderly rigged
with ropes and sails, and in all points had all manner of tacklings provided
for her as fit and necessary, as belongs to a ship of her burden: She had
twelve pieces of Ordinance in her, that went off by a strange devise in just
order one after the other; They were planted on a platform framed for that
purpose upon the Tower-decke in their equal proportions, and no man near
them at their discharging: Her forecastle was framed lower then the stern by a
foot; upon every top, and yard arm she was garnished, and set forth with
flagges, ancients, streamers, and pendents of rich Taffetie, the colors
sable, and argent, according to the colors of him that made and framed her:
Her several flagges were beautified with diverse Coats of Arms, as the Arms
of England, the Essex coat, the Harecourtes, and the Waynemans: And the coat
of the Shippewright, and his ancestors, with diverse other Gentlemen of woorthe,
and worship in that Country. Had the speculation of this matter come to our
imagination by sense, or memory. The respect hereof had not so deeply resided
in men's contentments, for ignoti nulla Cupido, But being an object presented to
the eyes, and ratified to be true by the Testimony of many thousand witnesses
(all one man's labor and workmanship) it has or own many men's humors and
affections to concur in pleasure, and admiration, and (but that it has bin
seen) it might be thought a thing impossible to be compassed by humane
understanding. And yet it may be that some superficial shippe-wrights, or
ungrounded Scholars in that Art, who, ad pauca respicientes de facili
iudicant, will think this easy to be performed, because they can say, they
know it: But that will not suffice, because the sphere of knowledge does
infinitely exceed the limits of conjecture, or not deep, and profound
capacities: yet they will oftentimes go about to derogate from others worth,
for that they themselves hunt greedily after admiration.

I have heard a merry report: That ships of sundry Nations, lying in harbor in
fair weather, The young Mariners were climing, and showing feats of
Actiuitie, one of one Nation to outbragge the other, At length a nimble
yonckster gets him to the very top of the foremast, and raising himself bolt
upright* turned round upon his foot without any stay, challenging his
Antagonist or any of the Nation to do the like: His Antagonist presently
undertakes the challenge: But having turned scarce half about, fell down,
and (as god would) in his tumbling by good hap, caught hold of the shrowds: And
as soon as ever he had a little recoured his spirits, being half dead for
fear, yet set a bold countenance on the matter: and he also again with a loud
voice dared his adversary or any other of that Nation to do the like: as
though that which befell him by his error, he had done of very purpose: Even so
diverse that have performed some slight matters, or voyages, will take upon
them, and crack and boast they have done great things, and according to Arts
and happily will speak and talk of strange wonderes such as have never been
heard of, and of gulfes* and currents, more by many then ever God made, when
indeed these shifts are but to shadow their ignorance, and when all savors
of as much Art, as that was which the fellow before specified wrought his fear
by.

To such I could with they would have in remembrance a saying of Apelles unto
Megabysus a noble man of Persia, who coming into his shop, although his
knowledge was but small, yet was he loath to have it, appeae that he was
ignorant of any thing. And therefore began to question, a dispute of lives, of
shadows, and of such like matters belonging to the Art: But Apelles entreated
him to make more spare of his speech, for (says he) my youths which grind my
colors, hearing your idle discourses, do derive them, which before had you in
great admiration for your gallant show, and presence: Now to the manner of his
further proceedings.

The manner of the Pynaces travel.
I do not think there is any man that either regards Gods glory, or
esteems of humane society, but holds this Art and faculty of Navigations
and Shipwrights, (for this Gentleman's practice participates of both) the most
excellent that are exercised amongst men. And therefore it is of very due
right, that the practisers thereof, should be had in deserved reputation:
Neither is there any other Art wherein God shows his divine power so
manifestly, as in this: permitting unto them certain rules to work by, and
increasing them from time to time, growing still onwards toward perfection, as
the world does toward his end: and yet reserueth unto himself the managing of
the whole: That when the practices of this faculty have done what they can
according to the skill they have, or shall learn hereafter, he yet always
makes manifest, that none but he alone is Lord of the Air, Land, and Water,
that all storms and tempests do but fulfill his will and pleasure, and all the
waves of the waters are continually at his commandment: Sufficiently verified
by the several occurrents that befell in this adventurers voyage, which was
thus begun and proceeded.

Upon Monday being the twentieth day of Iulie last past, between the hours of
nine and ten of the clock in the forenoone, This said Pynace was brought
forth of the house of the right worshipful William Essex Esquire, of Lamborne
aforesaid, being near unto the Church, to proceed and pass forwards in her
journey, viz. From the battlements of the Church tower of Lamborne, by Air,
Land, and Water under LONDON bridge to the Custom house Key of the City of
London, by the industry and labor of one only man that framed her. Being
brought into the Church yard, she shot of her ordinance, being twelve pieces,
in order one after another, to the wonderful admiration of the multitude of
people that were there assembled to behold her, for the most part of them never
saw ship, or pynace before, except it were some few of the better sort.
There the multitude of people was so great, that by reason of the throng, and
press amongst them, one whole hour was spent before the Pynace could be
brought to the ground platform; and settled upon the Cables to ascend up to the
battlements of the Tower,

She was no sooner set upon the Cables, but was ascended by degrees up into
her place upon the battlementes, not having any man in her: where she
continued till two of the clock in the afternoon: At which time she was let
of from the Tower, the distance of twenty foot to hang in the air, in the
full view, and sight of all the people there present: As she so hunge in the
Air, her Ordinance went of, and no man near her by Twentye foot with many
fire works, and other strange and worthy devises, to satisfye the peoples
expectation for that day, for the voyage was determined to begin the next day
following. But the vngouern'd vulgar sort of people not content with these
shows (albeit they came Gratis) began to gather together in a tumultuoue and
unruly head, as if they meant sour hurt or prejudice to the work, or
workman, for they pretended themselves not satisfied with all this, except they
might see one come down from the top of the Tower in the same boat or
Pynace: which the framer of the work perceiving, and knowing the multitude to
be compared to a beast of many heads, unstayed in respect of many guides,
unconstant in respect of many minds, and unruly in respect of many members,
thought good to prevent by satisfying their murmuring minds with the effect of
their desires: For the Author of all that business, to please the incredulous
people, and to fulfill the insacietie of the Common sort, went up to the
battlementes and down again in her, to the astonishment of many, and to the
full satisfaction and content of all, being two thousand in number at the
least: and about six of the clock in the afternoon she returned into the
place from whence she came.

Upon Tuesday the one and twenteth day of July, between the hours of twelve
and one of the clock that day, this Pinace was prepared to set forward on her
voyage, little thinking that the concourse of people had bin so great, as was
there the day before to hinder her passage: but when she was brought forth
into the Churchyard, she found there the number much increased, and the company
as troublesome and unruly, as the day passed: yet that did not let, or
withold the determinate purpose of her proceedings, but with the great labor
and pains of twenty men at the least that were helping, she was brought to
be set upon the Roapes, and there rested forty foot from the ground, out of
the peoples reach, until such time as al things were sufficiently viewed by him
that was to travail in her: for it behooued him to extend his care in a case
of such danger, where he had so great a wager, as the venture of his life, in
the performance of his undertaken voyage; and the rather, for that the love,
the demeanor and disposition of the people that were there, were altogether
unknown unto him, whose rule and indiscreet behauiors afterward appeared to
be such, as by their negligence they had purchased to themselves and others,
an untimely ruin and overthrow, had not Gods love, and mercy been beyond all
hope, measure, and expectation. For this Aduenturer having many friends (for
he was very well beloved) to the number of threescore persons, men, women and
children being assembled together, and got upon the top of the Tower, contrary
to his knowledge, where the platform was, and where diverse other ropes
belonging to the pullies, and counterpoises were fastened to the maine
pynnacles thereof: the common multitude little regarding, and less knowing to
what uses they were made, some leaned, some hung, and some sat upon the ropes,
othersome gate up to the top of the pynnacles to which the ropes were fastened,
and there stood holding the iron (whereon the Uane was sixth) in their hands,
that they might the better, have full sight of the coming up of the Pynnace:
But as Mala minus expectaeta grauiora, so the mischief that then suddenly
befell was the more grievous, by how much it was the less expected, or dreamed
upon. For at the first motion of the Pynace having her Commander in her,
determined to ascend toward the top of the tower, 2. of the maine pynnacles,
with men upon them, fell down into the tower, amongst the people yt was there
standing as thick as might be, that every one was in great hazard and danger.
But here God showed his wonderful mercy, for neither they upon the pinnacles,
nor upon the ropes, nor any of them that were standing upon the leads under
the fall of the pinnacles had any harm or hurt, or received any bruise by the
fall thereof, although by estimation they were either of them judged 2000.
weight.

There might you have heard a grievous stir and lame^tation of the people for
the suspected loss of friends, some crying for the loss of their husbands,
some for the lack of wives and children: other some for their friends, and
kinsfolk, all greatly doubting, and mistrusting that a great part of the
people in the Tower, had by that fall bin utterly killed, or at least
grievously hunt or maimed: but when an happy voice gave notice from the top of
the Tower, that no person had sustained either loss of life or limb, or
received any hurt or bruise, the people all wondered at so strange a miracle,
and gave God the glory: yet some of the most incredulous sort remained
doubtful and would not be confident of such happiness or good fortune,
until they might see their husbands, wives, and children come down and
descend from the top of the Tower: which was not long a doing, for every man
striued to make most have, and he thought himself most fortunate that could
attain to be foremost.

All this time, he that had undertaken this journey sat ready in the Pynace to
proceed in her, and beheld all that disasterous chance which had happened,
But when he saw that all was in safety, and that neither man, woman, nor
child had received the least hurt by that accident, he was much joyful for
them, greatly comforted in himself, and gave God hearty praise, and thanks,
for sending consolation in such hopeless extremity. But as the musition
neither strayneth the string of his instrument too high for fear of breaking,
nor lets it too low for fear of bistuninge: So God still keeps a mean,
neither suffering men to be carelessly secure, nor driving them for want of
comfort to despair.

After this, the Governor of the Pynace came forth of her, and went up into
the Tower to be an Eye-witnes of what had happened, and finding all things
sufficient, and strong for his proceeding, notwithstanding this misfortune, he
came down cheerfully, and with a resolute heart to go forward on his journey,
But many of his friends both learned Preachers, and others went about to
dissuade him from this aduenturous enterprise: Alleging his attempt too
venturous, his purpose dangerous; and his presumption egregious, and to be a
great sin in tempting the mercy of God in so strange and vnhearde-of manner
of boldness. WHO sodainelye made answer that this president being so
wonderful, and beyond hope, did more encourage and anymate his proceedinges,
than any man's persuasions could possiblye prevail to the contrary: For now
he felt the helping hand of his merciful God to be ready to assist him in
all his actions, especially in this his journey: So in the name of God he
ascended up to the battlementes of the Tower in the Pynace, where standing up
he turned himself to salute all his friends, and taking them all by the
hands, he sat down in the Pynace, and by his own industry, and labor let
himself down by degrees to the ground to the joy and wonder of all the
beholders.

At the lower end of the ropes were the wheels, and diverse other Engyns,
provided for his travel by Land, ready attending his coming down: On which
wheels after some little time he placed the Pynace; and all their other
Engyns in their several places; and sitting in her, made her pass too and fro
in the church-yarde, as well to see that all things should be fit, and well
appointed for his travel, as to content the people that stood desirous to see
the rest performed of that novel adventure: From thence he proceeded to the
place from whence she came in the morning, being partlye in his way to
London, yet that small part of his journey did more vex and trouble him, than
a whole days travel in the rest of his voyage, by reason of the multitude of
people, that did so follow, and pester him, and the deepenesse and
straightness of the way that did so exceedingly hinder him, that he was
constrained to rest the hbest part of the next day from the traveling any
further. Thus although his beginninges as well in respect of the former
mishappe, and unexpected accident, the unruly concourse of the common people,
and the badnesse of the way, were very combersome and might have ministered much
cause of discouragement, yet his resolutions were so settled, and his hopes so
fully bent upon gods help in those his businesses, that his procedings proved
exceeding prosperous, and the end was concluded with the fulness of all content
and expectation both of himself, and all his welwillers; as appears by his
further progress in the same.

Upon Wednesday the two and twentieth of July, between the hours of four and
five of the clock in the after noone, this gentleman enterprised by degrees to
make prosecution of his travel, which notwithstanding it was laboursome unto
him, yet seemed it sweet and pleasing in that his mind was led with a desire,
and delight to see the performance and execution of the same; for a firm hope
and assurance of those things we love, and labor to bring to pass, always
causes delight: Spes alit agricolas: Hope nourishes the Countrymen. The hope
of gain causes the laboring husbandman, not to feel the scorching heat of
the summer, nor the hoary frosts of winter. Hope of glory enritcheth the
Soldier with a certain sweetness in all his dangerous encounters: and the
Merchant, although he lie tossed with billows, and tempest-shaken in the
midst of the Ocean, yet is he made merry at midnight with the hope of
Lucre. He that is moved with delight in this matter of hope exactly declares
his certain confidence of apprehending the subject of his hope, and the
undoubted grounds, and probable security of obtaining the things expected.

So fared it with this Traveler, who moved with this passion of hope, or
rather certain persuasion of his prosperours proceeding, began now to
address himself to the apt disposing of his Pynace, and to the making of her
go upon the maine land, and so traveled from Church Lamborne, to Vp-Lamborne,
being by judgment and estimation some quarter of a mile distant the one from
the other. In every Virtue, there is a low degree, a mean, and an Excellent:
There be beginners, goers forward, and perfect, Incipientes, perficientes, and
perfecti: In every virtue there is a supreme Excellency, rare, singular, and
admirable, as in Fortitude, apert perils of death, in Prudence, present
Resolutions, etc. which degries this pratitioner had brought to such perfection
in his Art, that he effected the same to the great commendation of his Virtue,
and the deep contentment of all the beholders. And about seven of the clock
in the evening of this same day, he ceased from his labor for that time, and
the next day following being Thursday he there rested, and took his repose.
For* -- inter iecta vigorem
for^ requies, reparant tempestius atia vires.


Upon friday being the 24. day of July between the hours of three and four
of the clock in the afternooone, he began to travel with his boat from
Vp-Lamborne* where he had well rested, and refresht his wearines, up an
exceeding high hill toward Childerie downs, which he could very hardly
attain the top of, but with great enforcement of pains, and labor. And then
descended into the next vallye, The passage to which he found to be so easy,
that he was thereby encouraged to attempt the climing to the top of the next
hlll, being far higher, and steeper than the first, but that proved so
difficult, and full of toil to him in the travel, that it was full night
before he could attanie to the top thereof; and his bones were so ouerwearied,
and grieved with the extremity of that labor, That having then traveled a
Mile, and an half he was there constrained to rest and to proceed no further,
but to put a deep cross into the earth, where he left his boat, and some
people with her there that right, and he with diverse others returned to
L^mbborne where he rested.

Upon Saturday the five and twentieth of Iulye between the hours of seven
and eight a clock in the morning, he began to proceed forward on his
Journey, and traveled from the foresaid Cross on Childerie Downs to the
lodge of the right worshipful Sir Edmond Fetiplace, being from thence distant
some two miles and an half, and there by reason of the tempestuous weather, as
extremity of Lightning, Thunder, and Rain, he was constrained to rest from
passing any further, and there being about the hours of Two and Three of the
clock in the afternoon, he ceased and left of to labor. The rain having
fallen so wonderfully fast, that the Pynace (had she been from the wheels)
might have swome upon the downs, for (the shower being ended) there was in her
by estimation forty gallons of water. At that place he rested the next day
being Sunday.

Monday the seven and Twenty day of July.
If any man should inquire why the Vine so loves the Elm by nature that it
wrappeth more kindly about it, and brings forth more plenty and better
Grapes, then planted at the root of any other Tree, no other reason
questionles could be given, than a certain secret simpathye of nature, a
proportionate agreeableness, and natural conueniencye. If any should demand,
why this traveler has so bended his studies and endeavors in this Art,
seeing there is such peril, both in the proof and practice, I think no
better reason can be yealded than this, that if proceeds from a certain love
he has thereunto, grounded upon the agreeableness, and concordance with his
Nature: For neither fears, misfortunes, nor bad weather, or tempests could
disanimate or deter him from his further proceedings, but that as before, so
upon Monday being the Seven and Twentieth day of July between Seven and eight
of the clock in the forenoone, taking time by the forehead, and desirous not
to be idle, but always in action, he began to travel from Sir Edmond
Ferryplace his lodge, but by reason of the multitude of people that in a
distracted desire, came and followed him to behold this unheard of manner of
traveling, which was a thing so incredible and strange unto them, That a
Pynace should pass over the the top of the downs, he was in some sort by
the peoples importunity, enforced to rest and remain here three hours after
he had traveled three miles.

Here Virtue was encouraged by the vulgar sort, as it was remembered by the
better, for every one that had been Spectator of this strange enterprice,
caused such sustenance to be brought unto him, as either that place or their
store and provision could afford him, and that in such timely manner, that as a
shower of rain after a long droughte is more worth than ten showers another
time: and money lent to a Merchant falling Banckrupt to uphold his credit, may
be acounted so much money given: So the same was the more pleasing and
acceptable unto him, in that it was so needful by reason of the greatness of
his former labor and travel. After he had well received, and refreshed
himself with such provision as they had plentifully bestowed upon him, he
addressed his course toward Catimslow hill, being about a mile from the place
he thus rested at, and there took his repose that night, having traveled
five mile the same day.

The next morning being Tuesday, the eight and twenty day of Iulie, between
the hours of nine and ten of the clock in the fore noone, he desisted not to
go forward* and proceeded in his wearisome journey, finding it now very
painful, and irksome unto him, as well by reason of the extremity of the
hot weather, as by means of the infinite company of people, which greedelie
followed after him in such great troops, being two miles from any Town, or
Uillage, that he was almost stifled, and pestered for want of air, for
notwithstanding he himself many times entreated them to forbear, yet neither
he, nor all his friends or follewers could prevail, or persuade them to
refrain from pressing so near him, and the boat. So incapable oftentimes are
the actions of the common multitude, either sense, order, or measure: but that
for the most part, they more earnestly pursue that which they are must
forbidden and desired to leave. According to that, Nitimur inuetitum, semper
cupimusque negatum.

About two of the clock in the afternoon, by a sinister accident and
misfortune, the chiefest key of his work brake suddenly, by which the Pynace
was guided, and governed: by reason whereof, he was forced to cease going
forward any further, having not travailed above a mile that day.

Upon Wednesday the nine and twentieth of Iulie, between the hours of nine and
ten of the clock in the morning, after the iron engine was mended, (...) the
day before was broken, he began to proceed on his journey, from Cutchinglow
hill upon the downs with as much speed as he might. And after he had
traveled almost three miles be practiced in his boat, The concealed Art for
swift speed in running. Which he performed with inexpected admiration, for in
twelve score, he outran all the people twenty yardes, being of men, women and
clildren, to the number of five hundred. This day he travailed further to Alse
worth Parish, to a place called Harberts lodge, where perforce he was
constrained to rest, by reason that the engine so lately mended, was newly
broken again, about four of the clock in the afternoon, having travailed
that day six miles, and better. This day he passed the highest and steepest
hill, that was in all his journey, being from the foot to the top thereof,
by estimation a long mile.

Thursday the thirtieth of Iulie.
ARistotle (Eth: 2. Cap. 3.) reduces all our motions of the mind, to
Pleasure, and Pain: For as we see (says he) there is no wickedness but men
will attempt for Pleasures: So we try many to be deterred from the study of
Virtue only for the fear of Pain. Some other modern Philosophers (aiming
almost at the same mark) distinguish in general, All Affections into two
Members, (that is) Some consist in procuring, and prosecuting some good thing,
either pleasant, or profitable unto them. Others, in flying or eschuing some
ill thing that might annoy them: They aimed (I say) both almost at one mark,
because who prosecuteth any matter that conduces to his nature, receaueth
thereby pleasure; So he that shunneth any thing disagreeing to nature,
shunneth consequently Pain. With these divisions consent the proceedings of
this Traveler, who prosecuting with all vehemency his motions of mind, and
affections of Desire, and Hope, was strengthened, and encouraged to attempt any
difficulties, and was not disanimated by any pain, to prosecute the end of his
profit, and pleasure.

Insomuch that upon Thursday the thirtieth of Iulie, between the hours of
nine and ten of the clock in the forenoone, after the remending of the said
Engine of iron this industrious gentleman no way variable in his resolution,
or swaruing any whit from his determinate purpose, addressed himself and his
course from Harberts lodge, to a place called Streatly, being some two miles
distant from the lodge, To which place he came about twelve of the clock of
the same day, where he rested that day, and the day following being Frydaye,
only to calke, pitche, and trim his Pynace, because she was so maruellously
shaken by the long and weari-some journey she made upon the land: Launching her
forthwith into the water, to make trial whether (without further reparation)
she was able to endure her travel upon the Water: which upon search he
found so sufficient, as that her former shaking by Land, had not much hurt, or
annoyd her.

Upon Saturday being the first of August, about twelve of the Clock, this
Gentleman intended to commit both himself, and his Pynace to the mercy of
the water, and very early in the morning prepared diverse great waights, and
put them into her, so by the greatness of the waights caused the Pynace to sink
under the water, to enable her by the swelling of the Timber and planckes to
defend any breach that might happen by her going upon the water in that
journey, and that with more speed and safety he might ariue at the end of
his determined voyage: being in good hope he should receive less damage upon
the water then he had sustained upon the land. This done, he thought himself
in such security as if he did in Portu nauigare. But it fell out clean
contrary; for a company of rude persons, being Bargemen, (a kind of people by
nature, and education immoderate, barbarous, and uncivil) wading in the water
to the Pynace, with great violence haled, and pulled her up and down, as if
they intended nothing else but to have shaken her asunder. Which when the
Commander of her heard of, and perceived, with what kind and mild speeches and
entreaties as he could, he persuaded them to disist from their rude and
uncivil manner of behavior. But all prevailed not, they were so far from
leaving of to continue these wrongs and injuries, as they returned vild and
uncivil speeches to the Gentleman: and not contented with that, their company
increased to the number of ten, or twelve persons, all Bargemen, some with
long Pike staves, some with long hooks, and other weapons, and barbarously
assaulted this distressed Uoyager, having but two men with him, attendants in
his company, who were both grievously wounded and hurt in their heads and
other places, by these ryotous persons: for all this these rude fellows were
not satisfied, neither for the abuse offered to himself, nor the hurtes done
to his men, but they manifested their further cankred stomachs and malice,
(after the hurt men were retired into their lodgings, for safeguard of their
lives) and went unto the Pynace where they had left her, and with great stones,
hookt staves, and other weapons, maliciously rent and spoiled her, and beat
great holes through her, not forbearing to continue this violence and outrage,
until they thought they had sufficiently torn her for travailing any more,
either by land or water. Thus to be led by the brainsick resolutions of idle
humors, and to follow the multitude, (which the Philospher terms to be
Monstru^ multorum Capitum, A Monster with many heads) is but to delight in
sturbance, to take pleasure in doing injuries, and to heap one mischief on
the neck of another.

This was a great overthrow, and hinderance to this Travelers voyage, and
might have been his utter undoing, if their devilish purposes had taken their
full effects: for by this misfortune he was constrained to stay at Streatley,
Satterday, Sunday, and part of Monday, as well to cure and recover his men, as
to mend and repair his boat; which (God be thanked) were both reasonably well
performed by the Monday following: so that by this time his men were somewhat
recovered, and enabled in the afternoon to pass in a boat which he had hired
of purpose, to carry them some four miles a day, as they were able to endure
the air, with drums and sorts of Music, by which both himself, and his
men received much consolation and comfort.

The first, second, or last occasions of fear did not cause him to distrust of
hopeful end: but as a wise ship-master when he sets forth from the
shoarer and goes to Sea, laying aside the remembrance of wife, children,
house, and family, imployeth his body and mind only to the due performance of
his ship to a gainefull haven: So notwithstanding all dangers that befell
him, either by misfortune or disorder, he patiently under went them, and still
carried his mind and intendments ready and prepared to do their best to bring
his business to happy and succesfull conclusion: And so upon Monday being the
third of August between the hours of one and two of the clock in the
afternoon, he began to travel by water at the place where he left the
Thursday at his coming thither, for his Pynace was water-borne being upon
wheels, as she traveled upon the land: From thence he directed his course
from Streatley to Pangbornelocke, being distant from Streatley by water four
miles: And coming thither about six of the clock, rested there that day.

Upon Tuesday being the fourth of August beetweene the hours of eight and
nine of the clock in the afternoon he proceeded forward on his Journey, and
passed from the place where he left the night before, over the banckes of the
said Lock upon his wheels into the water on the other side of the lock,
until he was water-borne, and then he cast the wheels with other devises
from him, and so being clear in the water, rowed with his oars, going softly
forward until he came to Maple Dirrham-locke, bing distant from
Pangbornelock, some three miles, where he came a shore in his boat again,
upon the wheels, and passed through a long Wood wharfe, there by land a very
deep and troublesome passage, which was so painful by reason of the bad way,
and the extremity of heat, that the people (being very many of the better
sort, pitied him much, and were greatly sorry for his painful labor. All
which he did by his own toil and industry: and yet not so relying upon his
Art, but that he ascribed the means to Gods will and pleasure, without which
he could not have done any thing. Two things therefore are wished to be
increased in men of his Profession: the first is, the true fear of God, and
then a careful diligence in all things belonging to their Art; where the
fear of God is not, no art can serve the turn, for that were to make of art
an Idol; yet those that fear God, must take heed they tempt him not: they
ought therefore to use art as the means that God has ordained for their
benefit, and be thankful.

After he had rested himself about two hours, and well recreated and refresht
his body at Sir Michael Bluntes, he prepared to proceed forward passing in the
boat upon the wheels below the lock into the water, and when she was
water-borne again, he cast the wheels from him, and passed forward with his
Dares toward Reading-locke. Unto which place before he came, he might discry a
far off a whole army of people, upon Causum-bridge, ^ upon the banks of the
river, which followed the Pynace with her drumms and music, until she came
to the Lock. There might you have seen the number of the people double
increased, and the Trauailer with diverse Gentlemen, and others in his company
(all strangers) very kindly received and entertained by Knights, Ladies,
Esquiers, and sundry persons of the best rank and fashion, to the number of
two thousand people and vp-ward, of men women, and children, being half a
Mile from the town, whether with great pains the Pynace was brought, and
placed in the Kings forge at the Pryorie: and such as were in the Trauailers
company passed into the town, coming thither about six of the clock, and
rested there, having trauialed that day eight miles.

Upon Wednesday being the fifth of August, between the hours of ten and
eleven of the clock in the fore-noone, he conuayed his Pynace as privily as
might be to the water, to avoid and beguild the press of people, being then
dinner time: at which time he thought that people would have least mind to
look after his proceeding. Notwithstanding upon the least news of his
departure muttured, the people instantly increased, and flocked together in
greater troops and abundance, then were there the day before, with their drums
and several instruments music, of as well to show their own gladness and
content of mind, as to add comfort to the Trauailer, for Music does iubilate
the heart with pleasure, excites and stirs up humors and inuites so
magnanimity: and no other cause can be yeiled then this, that betwixt men's
hearts and music, there is a certain symphatie, correspondencie, and
proportion. Who can give any other reason why the Loadstone draws iron, but a
sympathy of Nature? why the needle touched but with such a stone, should never
leave looking toward the North Pole? who can remember other reason then
Simpathie of nature? So we may say, that such is the nature of men's minds, as
music has a certain proportionate Simpathye with them: As our tastes have
with variety of dainty cates: our smelling with variety of odours, etc. But
not to insist upon this, they followed (I say) this traveler all along upon
the shore, a mile and better upon Sunning-Locke, where (but that God
miraculously protected, and defend him) both the Pynace and he in her had
been cast away and drowned: for vnaduisebly by the counsel of a Miller he
presumed to shut a narrow straight, which had a great fall joining to the
Lock: where a stumpe had almost over whelmed the Pynace, but she escaped that
danger, only receiving some quantity of water near about three or four
gallons. About four, or five of the clock in the afternoon he came to
Sunning, where by diverse people of the better sort and condition with him and
his company were very kindlye entertained. There he rested that night,
casting in his mind, how he might escape the like troublesome locks and
dangers.

Upon Wednesday being the sixth of August, between the hours of ten and
eleauen of the clock in the forenoone, he prepared his Pynace to travel upon
her wheels by land to Maydenhead, understanding it to be thither thirty miles
by water, and but eight miles by land, besides many dangerous locks which
might put him in great hazard: so he proceeded to travel by land to Twyford,
but had not passed half a mile, when the maine Exe of the pron-worke brake: by
reason whereof, he could pass no further then Twyford, for it was four hours
before it could be mended again: So there he rested that night, coming
thither about six of the clock.

These crosses and impediments would have wearied many, and moved them to
coffeehouse as well for the often exercising of one thing which eng^^^^th
satiety, and for that by nature men affect to be various: As for that also
they found such discouragements in the estate and condition of the exercise and
business which they had in hand: yet these could not set war and battle in
his thoughts, or hinder the progress of his intendments. But that on Friday
being the seventh of August, between the hours of nine and ten of the clock
in the forenoone, he began to proceed and go forward on his painful journey,
which he found to be full of tail and labor, by reason of the deepenesse of
the sand, which caused the Pynace to travel very sad and heavily. That day
she travailed to little Week, in Maydenhead thicket, being distant from
Twyford four miles, and there rested about six of the clock.

Upon Saturday the eight of August, between the hours of nine and ten of the
clock that day, he traveled from little Week in the Thicket aforesaid, to
Maydenhead: Through which Town, he endured the most painful toil and
travel, that he had in all his journey, by reason of the deepenesse of the
mire in the street, wherein the wheels pierced a foot deep at the least: and
so forward to Maydenhead Bridge, over the Thames. Into which River he passed
with his wheels, until he was water-borne, where he purposed to proceed on
his journey on Monday following: So for that day he returned to Maydenhead
about four of the clock, having travailed the same day some three miles, and
there rested he that night, and the next day being the Saboth day.

Upon Monday, being the tenth of August, between the hours of nine and ten in
the morning, he began to travel from Maydenhead Bridge by water, to which
place he came from Maydenhead upon his wheels, being entreated by diverse
Knights and Esquires, that were there assembled, that they might see the manner
of his travel by land, which after they had fully viewed at their pleasure,
he took off he wheels, and lanched her at the place where the was
water-borne the Saturday before upon her wheels: and so passed by water to
Winfor, and there stayed to refresh himself two hours, and from thence rowed
to Staynes with his oars attending him, having a set of loud Instruments of
music in them, from Maydenhead to London, to do him comfort and encouragement
in his journey. And having travailed eighteen miles this day, he rested at
night at Staynes, coming thither about six of the clock.

Upon Thursday being the eleauenth of August, between the hours of six and
seven of the clock that morning, he began to proceed forward toward
Kingstone, and arrived there between 10 and 11 of the clock the same
forenoone, Notwithstanding he stayed at Hampto^ Court half an hour by the
entreaty of Sir Charles Manners, where he refresht himself: So by estimation
he rowed his Pynace above five miles an hour, for four hours together: by
which the watermen were brought into a wondrous distraction, and admiration,
one while conceiving the best of it; another while the worst: Sometimes
thinking it might be done by art and cunning; and sometimes again, judging it
a thing impossible: So as the earth being unmanured, brings forth brambles,
and briers, with many stinking weeds; and manured also, springs forth here
and there darnell, and cockle; Even so their understandings were so ill guided,
that sometimes they did not only yield vain imaginations, but in the midst
of their best conceits, many times unjust surmises, and impertinent
distractions. He stayed at Kingston three hours, and from thence passed to
Braineford, he landed at master Harrions keye there dwelling, and rested there
Wednesday, and Thursday, coming thither about 5 of the clock in the
afternoon, and having rowed that day thirty miles.

Upon Thursday being the 13. of August between the hours of seven and eight
of the clock in the evening, he privately bended his course toward London,
only with one pair of oars in his company to carry sufficient witnesses of
his landing at the Custom House Key, leaving his musitions, and the rest of
his company behind him, doubting the multitude of boats, and people might much
annoy him, if he should attempt to land there by day. So between the hours
of 12 and 1 of the clock that night he landed at the Custom House Key, in the
presence of 4 of the kings servants of the Custom House, and diverse other
witnesses that saw the whole performing of the journey, and came with him
thither.

From thence he returned again to Braineford with his Pynace, and there landed
by 4 of the clock in the morning intending to prepare his Pynac^ and his
company in some better fashion, understanding the peoples expectation of his
coming to London, and of his landing at the Custom house Keye, which had
been performed again, but for the misbehauiour, and vnrulynes of the boats,
that with such a multitude and throng pressed so near the Pynace, that she
could not any way have free passage.

The most part of Frydaye, Saturday, and Monday he spent in painting and
rigging her with masts, yardes, Sails, Flagges, Ancients Streamers, and
pendents: And all other provision for her ordinance, and fire works, in as
laudable a sort, and fashion, as for a ship of greater burden: which the
knights, Ladies, and gentlemen near Braineford, and all sorts of the common
people, round about that place, hearing, and understanding of, resorted
thither upon the Mondaye, expecting the Pynace should that day have departed,
but she intended not to proceed till the morrow following. Then the better
sort entreated the commander of her to do them that especial favor that
they might see the manner of his travel both by Land and Water: which request
made by so worthy personages, he willingly subscribed to, and with all
expedition placed the Pynace on her wheels, and brought her from whence she
stood private, into a large Court, where there stood private so many Coaches,
and the great gates were so low, as she could not that way have passage into
the street, But another way being found by which she was brought forth,
there wanted no Spectators to attend her coming, but the street was full of
people, and most of the better sort, for there were two hundredth knights.
Ladies, and Gentlemen, who having seen the Pynace pass by Land, desired also
that they might see her swymme on the water: This was likewise granted by the
traveler. And they all satisfied to their full contents and pleasure.

Upon Tuesday being the Nyneteenth of August between the hours of Four and
Five of the clock in the morning, the Pynace was brought and launched into the
water, and passed forwards toward LONDON, with Drums, and loud
Instruments of Music, shooting off her ordinance at her departure from
Brayneforde: She came before Westminster between 7 and 8 a clock in the
morning, which being discried a far of, there came such a multitude of all
sorts of boats, that neither she, nor any of her company could row, or
stir any way, by reason of their rude thrusting upon her: So she was
constrained to press by all means she could to Sumerset Court at the wall,
not being able to come near the stairs, at which place she was drawn up by
roapes with force of men, and by them carried into a house in the Strande,
where we now leave her until her further proceedings.

Upon Wednesday being the nineteenth of August, between the hours of ten and
eleauen of the clock in the forenoone, the commander of the foresaid Pynace
shaped his course to the Custom House of the City of London, with diverse
witnesses for the performance of his journey with him. Who in the presence of
the Customer, Controller, and Surueyor there, did offer to make oath of the
performance of the voyage, entreating a certificate of what he had effected:
which was willingly granted, and delivered under these Officers hands, and
seals. And he himself very kindly entertained by all the officers, and feasted
at the Customers house and all his company.

FINIS.
