A Lovers newest Curranto, or the Lamentation of a young man's folly.
To a pleasant new tune.




AS it fell upon a day,
in the merry month of may:
Sitting in a pleasant shade,
with a gown of mertle made?
Beasts did leap and birds did sing,
trees they grow and plants they spring*
Every bird sings bannish moan,
save the Nightingale alone:
She poor bird as all forlorn
leanes her breast unto a thorn:
Where she sung this mournful ditty,
that to here it it was great pity:
Fie, fie, fie, now can she cry.
t^-ra-ra-ra-ra-tat^-by and by:
For to hear her thus complain.
scarce from tears I could refrain,
For her grief so lively shown,
makes me think upon my own.
O thought I thou monest in vain,
none takes pity of thy pain:
Senseless trees they cannot here thee:
retchles birds they will not cheer thee,
King anoy he is dead,
and all thy friends are clad in lead,
All thy fellow birds do sing,
careless of thy sorrowing:
While that fickle fortune smiled,
thou and I were both beguiled:
Every one that flatters thee,
is no ^^iend in misery,
When that I was prodigal,
bountiful they did me call:
And with such flattering,
pity but I were a King,
But when fortune chanced to frown,
then farewell thy high renown,
He is thy friend and friend in deed,
that sticks to thee in time of need,
When thou sorrowest he will weep:
when thou wakest he will not sleep,
Thus with every grefe in heart,
he with thee will bear a part.
First entised by many wiles,
and by fortunes fickle smiles:
Grief it is my cheifest song,
sorrow to me does belong,
Still I wait and moan to see,
my hard hap and misery.
When all my money it was spent,
no credit unto me be lent:
But straight they turned me out of door,
to beg my bread among the poor.
Thus fortune first on me did smile,
and afterward did me beguile,
Wherefore I wish all youths that see,
to take war^^ng here by me.
How that they follow Venus trace.
fear least they come to great disgrace,
For the like Sirens will them entice,
and afterward will them despise,
FINIS.
