Prologue
tOrpor hebes seusus scola perua labor minimusque / Causant quo minimus ipse
minora canam / Qua tum eugisti lingua canit insula bruti / Anglica carmente
metra iuuante loquar / Ossibus ergo carens / que conterit ossa loquelis / Absit
et jnterpres stet procul oro malus*

Hic in principio libri declarat qualiter in Anno Regis Ricardi Secundi
Sextodecimo Johannes Gower presentem litellum conposuit et finaliter compleuit
/ quem streunuissimo domino suo. Domino Henrico De Lancastria tunc Derbie
Comiti cum omni reuerencia sp ^^ialiter destinauit /

oF hem that written us to fore / The books duesbe and we therefore Ben taught
of yt was written thoo For thy good is that we also / In our time among us here.
Do write of new sum matter

Ensampled of the old wise
So that it might in such a wise
When we be deed and else where
Believe to the worlds ere
In time comend after this
But for men seyn and s^the it is
That who that al of wysedom write
It dulleth often a man's wit
To him that shall it al^ay read
For thylke cause if that ye read
I wol goo the myddel wey
And write a book between the twey
Somewhat of lust / and somewhat of lore
That of the less or of the more
So^me man may like of that I write
And for that few men en dyte
In our en glysshe for to make
A book for englondes sake
The year xvj of king Richard
What shall byfalle here afterward
God wot / for now upon this tide
Man see the world on every side
In sundry wise so dyuersed
That it well nygh stant al reuersed
Als for to speak of time a goo
The cause why it changes so
It needs naught to specyfye
The thing so open is at the ^ye
That every man it may behold
And netheles by days old
When that the books weren lever
Writing was byloued ever
Of hem that weren virtuous
For here in earth among us
I^ noman write how it stood
^he prys of hem that were good
Should as who says a great party
Be lost so for to magnyfye
The worthy princes that tho were
The books shown here and there
Whereof the world ensampled is
And tho that dyden then ne amys
Though tyranny and cruelte
Right us they stonden in degree
So wa^ the writing of the werk
Thus I which am a borell clerk
Purpose for to write a book
After the world that whylome took
Long time in old days passyd
But for men seyn it is now lassed
In wers plyght than it was tho
^ thenke for to touch also
The world which neweth every day
So as I can / so as I may
Though I sickness have upon hond
And long have had yet wol I fond
To write and do my business
That in some party so as I guess
The wise man may be aduysed
For this prologue is so assised
That it to wisdom al bylongeth
That wise man that it vnderfongeth
He shall draw in to remembrance
The fortune of the worlds chance
The which noman in his person
May know but the god allone
When the prologue is so dispended
The book shall afterward be ended
Of love which does many a wondre
And many a wise man has put under
And in this wise I thenke trele
Toward them that now be great
Between the virtue and the vice
Which longs unto this office
But for my wits ben to small
To tell every mannys tale
This book upon amendment
To stond at his commandment
With whom mine heart is of acorde
I send unto mine own lord
Which of lancastre is henry named
The high god has him proclaimed
Full of knyghthode and al grace
So would I now this werk embrace
With hoole trust and hoole believe
God grant I mote it well acheue
t Empus preteritum presens fortuna beatum. Liquit and antiquas vertit in vrbe
vias / Progenuit veterem concors dilectio pacem

Dum facies hominis nuncia mentis erat / Legibus vnicolor tunc temporis aura
refulsit / Iustici^ plane tunc que fuere vie / Nunc que latens odium vul tum
depingit amoris / Pace que sub ficta tempus ad arma tegit / Instar and ex
varijs mutoble Cameliontis / Lex ge rit and regnis sunt noua iura noius /
Climata que fuerant solidissima sic que per orbem / Soluuntur nec eo centra
qietis habent

E statu regnoque vt dicunt secundnm temporalia / videlicet tempore Regis
Ricardi secundi / Auno Regni sui Sextodecimo

i Shall draw in to my mind* The time passed than I find / The world stood
in all his welthe Tho was the life of man in health / To was plente tho was Ry
chesse / Tho was fortune tho was prowess / Tho was knyghthode in prys by name
/ Whereof ye wide worlds fame Write in Chronicles is yet withhold Justice of
law tho was hold

The pryuelege of Regalye
Was fast / and all the Baronye
Worshipped was in his astate*
The Cytees knew no debate
The people stood in obeysaunce
Under the reule of governance
And pees with rightwysenesse keste
With charity tho stood in rest
Of mannys heart the courage
Was showed then in the vysage
The word was lyche to the conceyte
Wtthout semblaunt of deceyte
Tho was there vnenuyed love
Tho was virtue set above
And vice was put under foot
Now stant the crop under the rote
The world is changed oueral
And thereof most in specyal
That love is fall in to discord
And that I take in to record
Of every* land for his party
The common voys* which may not lie
Naught upon one but upon all
Is that men now clepe and call
And seyne that regnes ben divided
Instead of love is hate guyded
The werre wol no pees purchase
And law has take her double face
So that Justice out of the way
With ryghtwysenes is gone awey
And thus to look on every halue
Men seen the soore without salve
Which all the world has overtake
There is no reygne of al out take
For every clymat has his dyele
After the tornynge of the whele
Which blyude fortune overthrows
Whereof the certain noman knows
The heuene wot what is to done
But we that duelle under the moon
Stond in this world upon a were
And namely but the power
Of hem that been the worlds guydes
With good counseylle on every sides
Ben kept upright in such a wise
That hate break naught thassise
Of love which is all the chyef
To keep a reygne out of meschyef
For all reason would this
That unto him which the heued is
The members buxom shall bo we
And he should eke her troth allow
With all his heart and make hem chere
For good counseyl is good to here
Al though a man be wise him selue
Yet is the wysedom more of tivelue
And if they stand both in one
To both it were then anon
That god his grace would send
To make of thylk werre an end
Which every day now grows new
And that is gretely for to rewe
In specyal for cristes sake
Which would his own life forsake
Among the men to yeuen pees
But now men tellen netheles
That love is from the world departed
So stant the pees vneuene parted
With hem that lyuen now a days
But for to look at al assayes
To him that would reason seche
After the common worlds speech
It is to wonder of thylk werre
In which none wot who has yt werre
For land him self deceyueth
And of dysese his part receives
And yet take men no keep
But thylk lord which al may keep
To whom no counseyl may be hyd
Upon the world which is be tyd
Amend that whereof men pleynen
With true hertes and with pleyne
And reconsyle love ayene
As he which is king sovereign
Of all the worlds governance
And of his high purucaunce
Afferme pees between the lands /
And take here cause in to his hondes
So that the world may stand appesed
And his godbeede also be plesed
Quas coluit moises vetus aut nouus Ipse Johannes / Hesternas leges vix colit
ista dies / Sic prius ecclesia bina virtute rokta / Nunc magis inculta p^llet
vtraque via / Pacificam petri vagi nam mucro resumens / Horruit ^^d x^i verba
cruoris Iter / Nu^c tamen assiduo gladium de sangiune tinctum / Vi^rat auaricia
bege repent sacra / Sic lupus ^^t pastor pater hostis mors miscrator / Prede
que largitor pax and in orb timor /

O thynk upon the days old
The life of clerkys to be hold.
Men seyn how yt they were tho
Ensample and (...) wle of al tho
Which of wysedom the virtue souten
Unto the god first they bysoughten
As to the substance of here scole
That they ne should not be fool
Her wit upon none erthly works
Which were ayene the astate of clerkis
And yt they myghten flee the vice
Which Simon has in his office
Wrerof he takyth gold in hand
For thyke time I understood
The lumbard made none exchange
The bisshopryches for to change
Ne yet a letter for to send
For dignyte ne for prouende
Or curyd / or without cure
The church kay in adventure
Of arms and of brigantaylle
Stood no thing then upon bataylle
To fight or for to make cheste
Yet thought hem then not honest
But of symplycyte and pacyence
They maden then no defense
The court of worldly regaille
To hem was then no bataylle
The vein honor is naught desired
Which has the proud heart fyred
The humylyte was tho withholde /
And pride was a vice hold
Of holy church the largess /
Yafe then and did great alms
The pour men that had need
They were eke chaste in word and deed
Whereof the people ensample took
Her lust was al upon the book
Or for to preche or for to pray
To wise men the right way
Of such as stood the troth vnlered
Lo thus is petrus barge stered
Of hem that ylke time were
And thus came first to mannys ere
The feyth of christ and al good
Through hem that then ware good
And sobre and chaste large and wise
And now men seyn is other wise
Simon the cause has under take
The worlds swerd in hond is take
And that is wonder netheles
When crist him self has bode pees
And set it in his testament
How now that holy church is went
Of that her law posyzyf
Has set to make werre and stryf
For wordly goods which may not
last / God wot the cause to the last
Of every right and wrong also
But while the law is rewlyd so
That clerks to the werre intend /
I not how that they shall amend
The woeful world in other things /
To make pees between kings
After the law of charity
Which is the propre dewte /
Belonged unto the preesthode
But as it thinks to make manhood*
The heaven is for the world is nyghe
And vain glory is eke to sleygh
Which couetyse has now withhold
That they none other thing behold
But only that they myghten win
And thus the werres they begin
Whereof the holy church is taxed
That in the point as it is axed
The dysme goth to the bataylle
As though crist might not avail
To do hem right by other way
In to the swerd the church kaye
Is turned and the holy bid
In to cursyng and every stead
Which should stand upon the feyth
And to this cause an ere leyth
Astonyd is of the quarrel /
That should be the worlds heel
Is now men sayn the pestyle nce
Which has expellyd pacyence
Fro the clerge in specyal
And that is showed oueral /
In every thing when they be greuyd
But if gregory be believed
As it is in the books write
He does us somdele to wete
The cause of thylke Prelacye
Where god is naught of company
For every work as it is foundyd
Shall stand / or else be confoundid
Who that only for cristes sake
Desires care for to take
And naught for pride of thylk astate
To bear a name of a prelate
He shall by reason do proufyte
In holy church upon the plyte
That he has set his conscience
But in the worlds reverence
There be of such many glad
When they to sylke astate be made /
Naught for the merit of the charge
But for they would hem self discharge
Of pouerte and become great /
And for pomp and for beyete
The scry^e and eke the pharysee
Of moses upon the sea
In the chair on high ben set
Whereof the feyth is often let
Which is bytake hem to keep
In crystes*cause al day they sleep
But of the world is naught foryete
For well is him that now may get
Office in court to be honouryd
The strong Coffre has al deuouryd
Under the kaye of auaryce
The tresour of the benefyce
Whereof the pour shulne clothe
And* ete and drink and house both
The charity goth al unknow
For they no greyne of pity know
And slouthe kepyth the lybrarye
Which longs to the sayntuarye
To study upon the worlds lore
Suffisith no^ght without more
Delycacye his sweet tothe
Has it suffryd / so that it fordoth
Of abstynence all that there is
And for to loken over this
If ethna brenne in the clergy
Al openly to the man's eye
At Auynyon they peryence
Thereof has youen an euydence
Of that men seyn hem so divided
And yet the cause is naught decyded /
But it is said and ever shall
Between two stoles lyth the fall
When that men wenen best to sytte
In holy church of such a flytte
Is for to rewe unto us all
God grant it mote well byfalle
Toward him which has ye troth
But often is seen that mochel sloth
When men ben drink of the cup
Does much harm wha^ ye fire is up
But if somwho the flamme stau^che
And so to speak upon this brau^che
Which proud envy has made to spring
Of scysme causes for to bring
This new sect of lollardye
And also many an heresye
Among the clerks in hem selue
It were better dyke and delue
And stand upon the right feyth
Than know al yt the bible says
And err as some clerks do
Upon an hond to were a sho
And set upon the foot a glove
Acordeth not to the behoue
Of reasonable man's use
If men bebelden the vertuse
That crist in earth taught hyere
They should not in such manner
Among hem that be hold wise
The papacye so desguyse /
Upon diverse electyon
Which stant after thaffection /
Of sendry lands al about
But when god wol it shall weve out
F^^ truth mote stand at last
But yet they argumenten fast
Upon the pope and his astate
Whereof they fallen in great debate
This cl^rk said ye / that other nay
And this ^^ey drive forth the day
And each of hem him self amendeth
^^ worlds good but none entendeth
To if at which common proufyte were
They seyen that god is mighty there
And shall ordeyne what he will
There make they none other skylle
Where is the peril of the feyth /
But every clerk his heart leyth
To keep his world in specyal
And of the cause general
Which unto holy church longs
Is none of hem that vnderfongeth
To shapen any resystence /
And thus the right has no defense /
But there I love there I hold
^o thus to broke is Cristes fold
Whereof the flok without guide
Devoured is on every side
In lak of hem that be vnwar
Shepeherdes which her wits beware
Upon the world in other halue
The sharp pryk instead of salve
They vsen now / whereof the hele
They hurt of that they should hele
What sheep that is full of wulle
Upon his bak they tose and pulle
While there is any thing to pylle
And though there be none other skylle
But only for they would win
They leave naught when they begin
Upon her act to proceed
Which is no good shepeherdes deed
And upon this also men seyn
That fro the lose / which is pleyn
In to the breres they forcatche
Here of for that they wolden lache
With such duresse and so bereue
That shall upon the thorns leave
Of wolle which the brere has tore
Whereof the sheep ben al to tore
Of that the herdes make hem lose
^o how they feynen chalk for chese
For though they speak and teache well
They done ^em self / thereof no dele
For if the wolf come in the wey
Here goostly staf is then aweye
Whereof they should here flok defend
But if the pour sheep offend
In any thing though it be lyte
They ben al*redy for to smite
And thus how ever that they tale
The strokes fall upon the small
And upon other that been great
Hem lacks heart for to beat
So that under the clerks law
Men seen the merel al mysdrawe
I wol not say in general
For there be sum in specyal
In whom that al virtue duelleth
And tho ben as thappostel tells
Qiu vocatur a deo tanquam Aaron
That god of his electyon
Has cleped to perfectyon
In the manner as Aawn was
They be nothing in thylk caas
Of Simon which the foldes gate
Has let and goth in other gate
But they gone in the right weye
There ben also sum as men say
That folowen Simon at heles
Whose carte goth upon wheles
Of couetyse and worlds pride
And holy church goth beside
Which she weth out ward a vysage
Of that is naught in the courage
For if men look in holy church
Bitwene the word and that they werche
There is a full great difference
They prechen us in audyence
That noman shall his soul empeyre
For all is but a chery feyre
This worlds good so as they tell
Also they fayen there is an hell
Which unto mannys sin is due
And bydden us therefore eschew
That wykked is / and do the good
Who that here words understood
It thenketh they would do the same
But yet between ernest and game
Full oftyme it turned other wise
With holy tales they deuyse
How merytory is thylke deed
Of charity to clothe and feed
The pour folk and for to part
The worlds good / but they depart
No thing naught / for that they have
Also they feyn good is to save
With penance and with abstynence
Of chastyte the contynence
But pleynly for to speak of that
I not how that ylke body fat
Which with that deynte metes keep
And leyen it soft for to sleep
When it has else al his will
With chastyte shall stand stylle
And netheles I can not say
In aunter that I myssay
Touchend of this*how ever it stand
I here and will naught understand
For thereof have I naught to done
But he that made first the moon
The high god of his goodness
If there be cause he it redress
But what as any man can accuse
This may reason of truth excuse
The vice of hem that been vngood
Is no repreef to the good
For every man his own works
Shall bear / and thus as of the clerks
The good men ben to commend
And al these other god amend
For they be to the worlds eye
The myrrour of examplarye
To reulen and taken head
Bet wene the men and the godbede
Vulgaris populus regali lege subactus Dum iacet vt mitis digna subibit onus Si
caput extollat and lex sua frena relax at / Vbi sibi velle iubet rigridis
Instar habet / Ignis aqua dominans duo su^t pietate carentes / Ira tamen plebis

dEstatu plebis vt diaint secu^du^ actidencia mutabilia

nOw for to speak of yt comune
It is to dread of that fortune
which has bifalle in so^dry lo^ des /
But often for defaute of bonds
Al sodenlyche or it be wist
A tonue when his lie aryst
To breken and run al about
Which endless should naught gone out
And eke full often a little skare
Upon a bank or men be ware
^ete in ye streme which with great peyn^
If every man it shall restreyne
where law faylleth / error grows
He is not wise who that ne troweth
For it has proved often er this
And thus the common clamor is
In every land where people duelleth
And each in his compleynt tells
How that the world is myswent
And thereupon his Judgment
Yeueth every man in sundry wise
But what man would him self auyse
His conseyence and naught mysuse
He may well at the first excuse
His god which ever stant in one
In him there is defaute none
So must it stand upon us ^elue
Naught only upon ten ne twelve
But plenerlyche upon us all
For men is cause that shall byfalle
Nota contra hoc quoth aliq^a sortem fortune aliqui influenciam planetaru^ penunt

est / quoth ea que nos pros^er^ (...) aduersa in hoc mundo vocamus / secu^dum
merita et demerita hominum dig no der iudicio proueniunt

aNd netheles sum men write
And sayn fortune is to wit /
And some men hold oppinion.
That it is constellacion /
Which causes all that a man does
God w^te of both which is sothe /
The world as of his propre kind
Was ever vntre w and as the blind
Inproperlyche he demeth fame
He blames that is naught to blame
And preyfeth that is naught to preyse
Thus when he shall the things peyse
There is deceyt in his balaunce
And al is that the varyaunce
Of us that should us better auyse
For after that we fall and rise
The world aresteth and fallith with all
So that the man is over al
His own cause of well and woe
That we fortune clepe so*
Out of the man him self it grows
And who that otherwise troweth /
Behold the people of Israel /
For ever while they dyden well
Fortune was hem debonayre
And when they dyden the contrayre
Fortune was contraryende
So it proves well at the end /
Why that the world is wonderful
And may no while stand full /
Though that it seem well beseyn /
For every worlds thing is vain
And ever goth the whele about /
And ever stant a man in doubt /
Fortune stant no while stylle
So has there no man his will
Als fer as any man may know
There lasts no thing but a throw
Boecius O qm^ dul^edo humane vite multa amaritudine aspersa est

He world sta^nt ever upon debate
So may be syker none astate /
Now here now there* now to and fro
Now up now down the world goth so
And ever has done and ever shall
Whereof I find in specyal
A tale written in the bible
Which must needs be credible
And that as in conclusyon /
Seyth that upon deuysyon
Stant / why no worlds thing may last /
Til it be drive to the last
And fro the first regne of al
In to this day how so befall
Of that the regnes be meuable
The man him self has be culpable
Which of his governance /
Fortuneth all the worlds chance

Of bras they were upon to see

De lapide statua co^fringente

tHe ston^ which from ye hully stage
He saw done fall on ye image
And bath it in to poudre broke
That sueuene has danyel vnloke
And said that it is gods might
Which when men wene most vprit
To stand shall hem over cast
And that is of this world the last
And than a new shall begin
From which a man shall never twynne
Or al to pain or al to pees
That world shall last endless
h^^ scribit qualiter huius seculi regna var^s mutacionibus prout in dicta

^O thus expowned Danyel
The kings sueuen fair and well
In Babyloyne the Cite
Where that the wysest of chaldee
N^ ^^uden wit what it mente
But he told all the hool intent
As in party it is byfalle
Of gold the first regne of all
De seculo aureo quod in capite statue designatum est a tempore ipsius
Nabugodonosor regis Caldee vsque in Regnum Ci^ regis persarum

wAs in the kings time tho
And last many days so
There whiles that the monarchye
Of all the world in that party
To Babyloyne was subgette
And held him still in such a plit
Til that the world bygan diverse
And yt was when the king of perse
Which Cyrus hight ayene the pees
Forth with his sone cambyses
Of Babyloyne all that Empire
Right as they would hem self desire
Put under in subjection
And took it in possession
And slain was baltazar the king
Which lost his regne and al his thing
De seculo argenteo quod in pectore designatum est a tempore ipsius regis Ciri
vsque in reg^um Allexandri Regis Macedonie

aNd thus when they had it wo^ne
The world of silver was bigo^ne
And that of gold was passed out
And in this wise it goth about
In to the regne of Darius
And than it fell to perse thus
There Alysander put hem under
Which wrout of ar^es many a wonder /
So that the monarchye left
With g^eces and here astate up left
And Persiens gone under foot
So suffer they that needs mote
De seculo en^o quod in ventre desig natum est a tempore ipsiue Allexandri
vsque in regnum Iulij Romanoru^ Imperatoris /

aNd tho the world bigan of brus
And that of silver ended was
But for the time thus it last
Til it befelle that at the last
This king when that his day was
come / with strength of death was ourcome /
And netheles yet or he dyed
He shope hi^ regne to deuyde
To knights / which him had served
And after that they have deserved
Yaf the conquestys that he wan*
Whereof great werre tho bygan
Among hem that the regnes had
Thorugh proud ennye / which hem lad
Til it bifell ayene hem thus
The noble Cezar Inlius
Which tho was king of Rome ^ond
With great bataylle and strong hond
Al Greece / Perse / and Chaldee
Wan* and put under so that he
Not al only of thoryent
But all the march of thoccydent
Gouerne^h under his Empire
As he that was lord and Sire
And held thorugh his chyualrye
Of all the world the monarchye
And was the first of that honor
Which takes name of the Emperor
De seculo ferreo quod in tibeis de signatum est a tempore Iulij Cesaris vsque
in Regnum Caros^ magni Regis Fran^orum

wHere Rome than would assaylle
There myt no thing contreua^^^e
But every country must obey
Tho goth the regne of bras aweye
And comen is the world of steel
And stood above upon the whel^
As steel is hardest in his kind
Above al other that men find
Of metalles such was Rome tho
The myghtyest and last so
Long time among the Romans
Till they bycome so vyleyns
That the false emperor leo
With Constau^ce his sone also
The pat^mon^^ and the Richesse
Which to syluester in pure Alms
The first Constantinus left
Fro holy church they be refte
But Adryan which pope was
And saw the meschyef of this caas
Goth in to France for to plain
And prayth the great Char^emayne
For Crystes sake and soul hel^
That he would take the quarele
Of holy church in his defense
And Charles for the reverence
Of god / the cause has undertake
And with his host the way take
Over the Mou^tes of Lumbardye
Of Rome and all the Tyranny
With bbody swerd he overcome
And the strength of the Cite nome
In such a wise and there he wrought
That holy church ayene he brought
In to, Fraunchyse and d^thr restore
The popes lust and yaf him more
And thus when he his god has served /
He took as he has well deseruyd
The dyademe and was ^orouned
Of Rome / and thus was abandouned /
Thempyre which came never again
In to the hon^ of no Romayn
But a long time it s^oode stylle
Under the Frens^he kings will
Til that fortune her whele so lad
That afterward the lumbardes it had
Nout by ye swerd. but by ye suffrau^ce
Of him that was king of France
Which Carl Caluu^ clepyd was
And resygned in this caas
Thempyre of Rome unto Lowys
His Cosyn which a lumbard is
And so it last in to the year
Of Alberte and of Berenger
De seculo nou^ssimis iam temporibus ad similitudinem pedum in discordiam lapso

But than vp^n discencion
They fell and in dyuysyon
Among hem self that were great.
So yt they lost ye beyete
Of worship and of Worlds pees
But m proverb netheles
Men seyn* full selde is that welthe
Can suffer his own astate in health
And that was in the lumbardes seen
Such common stryf was hem bytween
Thorough couetyse and thorugh ennye
That every man drough his party
Which might led any route
Within Burgh and eke without
The comen right has no feloowe
So that the governance of law
Was l^st and for necessyte
Of that they stood m such degree
Al only through deuysyon
Hem needs in conclusion
Of strange lands help beside
And thus for they hem self deuyde
And standen out of re^le uneven
Of Almayne Princes seven
^^^ chosen m this condycyon
That upon her electyon
Thempyre of Rome should stond^
And thus they left it out of hand
For lak of grace and it forsook
That Almayns upon hem took
And to confermen here astate
Of that they stoden in debate
They took it the possession
After the composicion
Among hem self and thereupon
They made an Emperor and that anon
Whose name the Cronycle tells
Wae Othee / and so for^^ it duelleth
For fro thylk day yet unto this
Thempyre of Rome has be and is
To thalamans and in this wise
As to fore ye hane herd deuyse
How Danyel the sweuene expouneth
Of that image whom he foundeth
The world which afterward should fall
Comen is the last token of all
Upon the feet of earth and stele
So stant the world now every dele
Departed which bygan right tho
When Rome was divided so^
And that is for to rewe sore
For alwey sith more and more
The world empeyreth every day
Whereof the soth she we may
At Rome if we begin
The wall and the Cite withynne
Stand m ruin and in decaas
The feld is where the paleys was
The tonne is wast and over that
If we behold thylke astate
Which whylome was of ye romans
Of knyghthode and of Cytezeyne
To peyse now with that byforne
The chaf is t^ke from the corn
And for to speak of Romes might
Uneaths stant there ought vpryght
Of worship or of worlds good
As it before time stood
And why the worship is away
If that a man the sothe say
The cause has been deuysyon
Which mother of confusyon
Is where she comyth oueral
Naught only of the ^^mporal
But of the spyrytual also
The deed proves it ie so
And has do many a day or this
Thorugh venym which that meddled is
In holy church of erthely thing
For Christ him self makes knowlechyng /
That noma^ may to geder serve
God and the world bnt he swerue
Froward that one and stond unstable
And Crystes word may not be fall
The thing so open is at the eye
It needs naught to specyfye
Or speak ought more in this matter
And in this wise a man may tere
How that the world is gone about
The which well nyghe is wered out
After the form of that figure
Which danyel in his scupture
Expowned as to fore is told
Of bras of silver and of gold*
The world is passed and a gone
And now upon his old tone
It stant of brutel earth and stele
The which acorden never a dele
So mote it needs swerue a side
A thing which men seen deuyde
Hic dicit secundu^ apl^m quod nos sumus In quos fines seculi deuenerunt*

tHappostel writes unto us all.
And says yt upon us is fall.
The End of ye world so may we know /
This image is nyghe overthrow
By which this world was sygnefyed
That whysome so was magnyfyed
And now is old feeble and vile
Full of meschyef and of peril
And stant divided eke also
Lyche to the feet that were so
As I told of the statue above
And thus men seyn for lak of love
Where as the land divided is
It more algace fare amys
And now to look on every side
A man may see the world deuyde
The werres ^en-so general
Among the Crystene oueral
That every man now secheth wreche
And yet these clerks alday preche
And seyn good deeds may none be
Which stant naught upon charity
I not how charity should stand
Where dedely werre is taken on hand
But all this woe is cause of man
The which that wit and reason can
And in tokne and in witness
That each image bare lykensse
Of man and none other beeste
Fro first unto the mannys heste
Was every creature ordained
But afterward and was restreyned
When that he fell they fellen eke
When he was seek they wexen seek
For as the man has passion /
Of sekenes in comparyson
So suffryn other creatures
Lo first the heavenly fygures
hIc scribit quod ex diuisionis passione singula creata detrimentum
corruptibile paciuntur

tHe son and the moon eclypsen to the /
And ben with mannys sin wroth
The purest air for sin alofte /
Has be and is corrupt full often /
Right now ye high wyndes blow.
And anon after they ben low
Now cloudy and now clear it is
So may it well prouen by this
A man's sin is for to hate
Which makes the welken to debate
And for to see the properte
Of every thing m his degree
Bynethe here among us here
Al stant a lyche in this matter
The sea now ebbeth and now it flows
The lo^d now welketh and now grows
Now the trees* with leaves grene
Now they be bare and nothing seen
Now be there lusty somer flowers
Now be there stormy winter shoures
Now be the days, now be the nytes
So stant there no thing vpryghtes
Now is it light now is it derke
And thus stant all the worlds work
After the disposicion
Of man and his condycyon
For thy Gregory in his, moral
Seyth that a man in specyal
The less world is properly
And that he proves redyly
For a man of soul reasonable
Is to an Angel resemblable
And lyche to best he has felyng
And lyche to trees he has growyng
The stones ben and so is he
Thus of his propre qualyte
The man as tellyth the Clergy
Is a world in his party
And when this world mystorneth
The a rete world al ouertorneth
The land the set the fyrmament
They axen all jugement
Ayene the man and make him war
There while him stant al out of harre
The remenaunt would naught acord
And in this wise as I record
The man is cause of al woo
Why this world is divided so
Dyuysyon the gospel says
One hows upon an other lay^h
Till that the Reygne overthrow
And thus many a man does know
Dynysyon abouen all
Is thing which makes the world
^alle*And ever has sith it began
It may first prove upon a man
Quod ex sue complexionis mate (...) diuisus homo mortalis existat

tHe which for his co^plexyon
Is made upon deuysyon
Of cold hot moist and dry
He mote by verray kind deye
For the contrary of his estate
Stant evermore in such debate
Till that a part be overcome
There may no fynal pees be nome
But ^therwyse if a man were
Made al to geder of one matter
Without jnterupcion
There should no corrupcion
Engen dyr upon that unity
But for there is dyuersyte
Within him self he may not last
That he ne dies at the last
But in a man yet over this
Full great dyuysyon there is
Thorugh which that he is ever in strif
While that him last any life
Quod homo ex corporis and anime condicione diuisus sicut saluacionis ita
dampnacionis aptitudinem ingredituz

tHe body and the soul also
Among hem ben divided so
That what thing that the body hates
The soul loves and debateth
But netheles full often is seen
Of werre which is hem between
The feeble bath the vyctorye
And who so draws in to memory
Qualiter Adam a statu innocen cie diuisus a Paradiso voluptatis in terram
laboris peccator proiectus est

wHat has bifalle of old and new
He may that werre^sore rewe
Which first byga^ in paradys
For there was proved what it is
And dysese there is wrought
For thylke werre tho forth brought
The vice of al dedly sin
Thorugh which dyuysyon came ynne
Qualiter populi per vniuersum orbem a cultura dei diuisi Noe cum sua sequela
duntaxat exceptis dilu^io interierunt
Among the men in earth here
And was the cause and ye matter
Why god the great flodes send
Of all the world and made an end
But Noe with his felauship
Which only was sauf by ship
And over that thorugh sin it come
That Nembroth sith thempyre nome
Qualiter in edificacione Turris Babilonis quam in dei contemptum Nembroth
erexit lingua prius hebreica in varias linguas celica vindicta di uidebatur

When ye toure babylon hit
Lat make as he yt would fit
Ayene ye high gods myt
Whereof divided anon ryt
Was the langage in such eutent
There wist none what other meant
So that they might naught proceed
And thus it stant of every deed
Where sin takes the caas on hond
It may vpryght not long stand
For sin of her condycyon
Is mother of al deuysyon
Qualiter mundus qui in statu diuisionis quali cotidianis presenti tempore
vexatur flagellis a lapide superuenien te id est a diuina potencia vsque ad
resolucionem omnis carnis subito contere tur

aNd tokne when the world shall fail /
For so says crist without ^nyle.
That nyghe the worlds end
Pees and acord a wey shall wend
And al charity shall seace
Among the men and hate encrece
And when these tokenes fall
Al suddenly the stone shall fall
As Danyel it has byknowe
Which all this world shall overthrow
And every man shall than arise
To joy or else to iuise
Where that he shall for ever duelle
Or streyt to heaven or streyt to hell
In heaven is pees and al acorde
But hell is full of such discord
That there may be no love day
For thy good is while a man may
Echone to set pees with other
And louen as his own brother
So may he win worlds welthe
And afterward his soul health
hIc narrat exemplum de concordia et vnitate inter homines pro uocanda / Et
dicit quida in Arion^ uu^ Citharista ex sui cantus Cithare que consonam
melodia^ tante virtutis extiterat vt ipsum non solum virtum cum viro Sed eciam
Leonem cum Cerua. Lupu^ cum agno / Canem cum lepore jpsum audientes vnanimiter
absque vlla discor dia ad inuicem pacificauit

bUt would god yt now were one
Another such as Aryone
Which had an^harp of such temp^ire
And thereto of so good mesure
He song that the bestes wild
Made of his note tame and mylde
The hynde in pees with the lion
The wolf in pees with the Moto^
The hare in pees stood with the hou^d
And every man upon this ground
Which Aryon that time herd
As well the lord as the Shepeherde
He brought hem al in good acord
So that the Common with the lord
And lord with the Common also
He set in love both two
And put a wey melancolye
That was a lusty melodye
When every man with other louz
And if there were such one now
Which could harp as he did
He might avail in many a stead
To make pees where now is hate
For when men thynken to debate
I not what other thing is good
But where yt wysedom wa^eth wood
And reason turned in to rage
So that mesure upon outrage
Has set his world it is to dread
For that brings in the common dread
Which stant at every man's door
But when the sharpnes of the spore
The ^hors side smyteth to sore
It greueth often and now no more
As for to speak of this matere
Which none but only god may stere
So were it good at this tide
That every man upon his syd^
Besought and prayed for the pees
Which is the cause of al encrees
Of worship and of worlds welthe
Of hertes rest and souls health
Without pees stond nothing good
For thy to christ which shed his blood
For pees byseketh all men
Amen / Amen / Amen / Amen

j May not stretche unto ye heuene /
Mine ho^d and set al in euene /
This world which is ever in balau^ce /
It sta^t not in my suffysau^ce /
So great things to compass
But I mote let it over pass
And treten upon other things
For thy the style of my wrytynges
Fro this day forth I thenke change
And speak of thing is not so strange
Which every kind has upon hand
And thereupon the world mote stand
And has done sith it began
And shall while there is any man
And that is love of which I mean
To trete as after shall be seen
In which there can noman him reule
For laws love is out of reule
That of to much or of to lyte
Well nyghe is every man to wit
And netheles there is no man
In all this world so wise that can
Of love temper the mesure
But as it fallyth in adventure
For wit ne strength may not help
And which else would he him yelpe
Is rathest thrown under foot
There can no wight thereof do bote
For yet was never such couyne
That couthe ordeyne a medycyne
To thing which god in law of kind
Has set / for there may noman find
The right salve for such a soore
It has and shall be evermore
That love is master where he will
There can no life make other skylle
For where as ever him list to set
There is no might which may him
let / But what shall fallen at the last
They can no wisdom cast
But as it falls upon chance
For if there ever was in balaunce
Which of fortune was gonerued
I may well leave as* I am learned
That love has that balau^ce on hand
Which wol no reason understand
For love is blind and may not see
For thy may no certeynte
Beset upon his judgment
But as the whele about went
He yeueth his graces undeserved
And fro ye man which has him served
Full often a wey he has taken his fees
As he that plays at the dies
And thereupon what shall byfalle
He not till that the chance fall
Where he shall lose or he shall win
And thus full often men begin
That if they wysten what it meant
They would change al her jugement
hIc quast in persona alioru^ quos amor alligat fingens se Auctor esse amantes
varias eorum passiones varijs huius libri distinctionibus per singula scribere

aNd for to preue it is so
I am my self one of tho
Which to the scole am vnderfonge
For it is soth go not long
As for to speak of this matter
I may you tell if ye wol here
A wonder hap which me befelle
That was to me both hard and fell
Touchend of love and his fortune
The which me lyketh to comune
And pleynly for to tellen out
To hem that lovers be about
Fro point to point I wol declare
And written of my woeful care
My wofnl day my woeful chance
That men may take remembrance
Of that they shall here after read
For in good feyth this would I read
That every man ensample take
Of wisdom which is him bytake
That he wot of good appryse
To teache it forth / for such empryse
Is for to preyse and therefore I
Will write and show al openly
Hou love and I to gedre met
Whereof the world ensample fette
May after this when I am go
Of thylke vnsely iolyf woe
Where r^ule stant out of the wey
Now glad and now gladness awey
And yet it may not be withstonde
For ought that men may understood
Non ego sampsonis vires non he^ulis arma. ^inco sum sed vt hij victus amore

hIc declarat materia^ dicens qualiter Cupido ignito iaculo sui cordis memoriam
graui vlcere perforauit quoth Genius percipiens jpsum vt dicit quasi in mortis

semiuiuum speciali ter commendauit

Upon the point that is byfalle
Of love in which yt j am fall
I think tell my matere
Now herkne who that wol it here
Of my fortune how it has ferde
This endyrday as j forth ferde
To walk as you tell may
And that was in the month of may
When every ^ryd has chose his make
And the^keth his myrthes for to make
Of love that he has acheued
But so was I nothing releued
For I was forther fro my love
Than earth is from the heuene above
And for to speak of any speed
So wist I me none other read
But as it were a man for fare
unto the wode I began to fare
Not for to sing with the birds
For when j was ye wode amyddes
I fond a soote grene pleyne
And I began my woe there complain
Wysshyng and weeping al mine one
For other myrthes made I none
So hard me was that ylke throw
That often sythes overthrow
To ground I was without breath
And ever I wysshed after death
When I out of my pain awoke
And cast up many a pytous look
Unto the heuene and said thus
O thou cupyde / O thou venus
Thou god of love and thou goddess
Where is pity where is meekness
Now does me plainly live or dye
For certes such a maladye
As I now have and long have had
It might make a wise man mad
If that it should long endure
O venus queen of loves cure
Thou life thou lust thou man's hele
Behold my cause and my quarelle
And give me sompart of thy grace
So that I may find in this place
If thou be gracious or none
And with that word I saw anon
The king of love and the queen both
But he that king with eyes wroth
His chere aweyward fro me cast
And forth he passed at the last
But netheles or he forth went
A fyry dart me thought he sent
And threw it thorugh mine heart rote
In him fond I none other bote
For benger him list no^ to duelle
But she which is the source and well
Of well and woe that shall betyde
To hem that louen at that tide
Abode for to allen here
She cast on me uoo goodly chere
Thus netheles to me she said
What art thou sone and I abrayde
Right as a man does out of sleep
And thereof she took right good keep
And bad me^nothyng be adrad
But for all that I was nothing glad
For I ne saw no cause why
And efte she axed what was I
I said a Caytyf that lies here
What would ye my lady dear
Shall I be hool or else deye
She said tell thy maladye
What is thy soore of which thou pley nest /
Ne hyde it nout for if thou feynest /
I can do the no medycyne
Madame I am a man of thine
That in thy court have long served
And ask that I have deserved
Some well after my long woe
And she bygan to loure thoo
And said there be many of you
Faytours and so may be that thou
Art right such one and by feyntyse
Seyst that thou have me do seruyse
And netheles she wist well
My word stood on an other whele
Without any feyterye
But algate of my maladye
She bud me tell and say her truth
Madame if ye would have routhe
Quod I then would I tell you
Sey forth quod she and tell me hou
She we me thy sekenes every dele
Madame that I can do well
Be so my life thereto wol last
With that her look on me she cast
And she said in aunter if thou live
My will is first that thou be shryue
And netheles how that it is
I wot my self but for all this
Unto my priest which comes anon
I wol thou tell it one and one
Both of thy thought and al thy werk
O Genius mine own clerk
Come forth and here this man's shryft
Quod venus tho and I vplyft
My head with that and began behold
The self priest which as she would
Was ready there and set him down
To here my confession
Confessus Genio si sit medicina salutis / Experiar morbis quos tulit ipsa
venus / Lesa quidem ferro medicantur membra saluti / Raro tamen medicum vulnus
amoris habet

Ic dicit qualiter Genio pro confessione sedenti prouolutus ama^s ad
confitendum se flexis genibus incuruatur supplicans tamen vt ad sui se^sus
informacione^ confessor ille in dice^ dis opponere sibi benignus dignaretur

tHis worthy priest this holy man
To me spekend thus began
And seyde Benedicite
My sone of the felycyte
Of love and eke of woe also
Thou shall be shryue of both two
What thou or this for loves sake
Have felt. let nothing be forsake
Tell pleynlyche as it is byfalle
And with yt word I began down fall
On knees and with devotion
And with full great contrycyon
I said than Domiuus
Mine holy fadre Genius
So as thou have experyence
Of love for whose reverence
Thou shall me shryne at this time
I pray the let me not mystyme
My shryfte for I am dystourbed
In all mine heart and so conturbed
That I ne may my wits get
So shall I much thing foryete
But if thou wolt my sin oppose
Fro point to point than I suppose
There shall no thing be left behind
But now my wits be so blind
That I ne can my self teache
Tho he bygan anon to preche
And with his words debonayre
He said to me soft and fair
In this place I am set here
Thy shryfte to oppose and here
By venus the Goddess above
Touchend whose priest I am of love
Sermo Genij sacerdotis super confessione ad amantem

But netheles for certain skylle.
I mote algate and needs will
Naught only make my spekynges
Of love / but of other things
That touchen to the cause of vice
For that bylongeth to thoffyce
Of prestes whose order that I bear
So that I wol nothing forbere
That each vices one and one
Me shall the show euerychone
Whereof thou might take euydence
To rewle with thy conscience
But of conclusyon fynal
Conclude I would in specyal
For love whose servant I am
And why the cause is that I came
So think I to do both two
First that mine order longs to
The vices for to tell on rewe
But next abouen al other show
Of love I wol the propyrtees
How that they stond by degrees
After the disposicyon
Of veuus whose condycyon
I must follow as I am hold
For I with love am al withholde
So that the less I am to wit
Though I ne conne but a lyte
Of other things that be wise
I am not taught in such a wise
For it is naught my common use
To speak of vices and of vertuse
But al of love and his lore
For Venus books of no more
Me techen nether text ne gloss
But for as much as I suppose
It sit a priest to be well the wyd
And shame it is if he be lewed
Of my presthode after the form
I wol thy shryfte so inform
That at the last thou shall here
The vices and to thy matere
Of love I shall hem so remeue
That you shall know what they meue
For what a man shall axe or seyne
Touchend of shryft it mote be pleyne
It needs naught to make it queynt
For troth his words wol not peinte
That I wol axe of the for thy
My sone it shall be so pleynly
That thou shall know and understand
The points of shryfte how they sto^de
Visus et auditus fragiles su^t ostia me^tis Que viciosa manus claudere nulla pt

Est ibi largo via graditur qua cordis ad antrum / Hostis and ingrediens fossa
talenta rapit / Hec michi confessor Genius pamordia profert / Dum sit in
extremis vita remorsa malis / Nunc tn^ vt potent feminina loquela fateri / Ver
ba per os timide conscia mentis agam

hIc confessio amantis cui de duobns precipue quinque sens^bus / hoc est de
visu and auditu confessor pre ceteris opponit

bYytwene life and death I herd
This prestes tale er I a^suerd
And than I prayed him for to say /
His will and I it would obey
After the form of his appryse
Tho spak he to me in such a wise
And bad me that I should shryue
As couchend of my wits five
And share that they were amended
Of that I had hem myspended
For tho be properly the gates
Thorugh which as to the heart algates
Comes al thing unto the feyre
Which may the ma^nys soul empeyre
And now is this matter brout ynne
My sone I thynk first begin
To wyce how thyn eye has stand
The which is as I understand
The most princypal of all
Thorugh whom ye peril may befalle
And for to speak in loves kind
Full many such a man may find
Which ever cast about her eye
To look if that they might aspye
Full often thing which he in ne touches
But only that here heart soucheth
In hyndrynge of another wight
And thus full many a worthy kynt
And many a lusty lady both
Has be full often sithe wroth
So that an eye is a thief
To love and does full great meschyef
And also for his own part
Full often that ylke fyry dart
Of love which that every man brenneth
Thorugh him in to the heart renneth
And thus a man's eye first
Him self greueth alder werst
And many a time that he knows
Unto his own harm it grows
My sone herkne me now for thy
A tale to be ware thereby
Thyn eye for to keep and ward
See that it pass naught the ward
hIc narrat Confessor exemplum de visu ab illicitis preseruando dicens qualiter
Acceon Cadmi Regis Thebarum nepos dum in quadam foresta venacionis causa
spaaretur accidit vt ipse quendam fontem nemorosa arborum pulcritudine circu^
uentum superueniens vidit enim Dia nam cum suis Nimphis nudam in flu mine
balncantem / quam diligencius intuens oculos suos a muliebri nudita te
nullatenns auertere volebat / vnde indignata Diana ipsum in cerui figuram
transformauit

Vyde says in his book
Ensample touchend mysloke
And says whilome there was one
A worthy lord which Acceone
Was hot and was Cosyn nyghe
To him that The bes first on high
Vpset / which king Cadme hight
This Acceon as he well might
Above al other cast his chere
And used it from year to year
With hounds and with great horns
Among the wodes and the thorns
To make his huntyng and his chase
Where him best thought in every place
To fyude game in his way
There rood he for to hunte and play
So him by fell upon a tide
On his huntyng as he came ride
In a forest all one he was
He saw upon the grene gras
The fair fressh flonres spring
He herd among the leaves sing
The throstel with the nyghtyngalc
Thus er he wist in to a dale
He came where was a little pleyne
Al round about well beseyn
With bnsshes grene and Cedres high
And there within he cast his eye
A mids the pleyne he saw a well
So fair there might noman tell
In which Dyana naked stood
To bathe and play her in the flood
With many a nimphe which her serves
But he his eye awey ne suerueth
Fro her which was naked al
And she was wonder wroth with all
And him as she which was goddess
Forshoop anon and the likeness
She made him take of an heart
Which was to fore his hou^des sterte
That run besylyche about
With many an horn and many a route
That maden much noise and cry
And at the last vnhappelye
This heart his own hou^des slough
And him for vengeance al to drough
lO now my sone what it is
A man to cast his eye amys
Which Acceon has dear abought
Beware for thy and do it naught
For often who that head took
Better it is to wynke than look
And for to prove it is so
Ouyde the Poet also
A tale which to this matere
Acordeth and says als thou shall here /
hIc ponit aliud exemplum de eo de^ vbi dicit quod quidam princeps nomine
Phorceus tres progenuit filias Gorgones a vulgo nuncupatas / que vno partu
exorte deformitatem monstrorum serpentinam obtinuerunt qui bus citra in etatem
peruenerant talis destinata fuerat natura. quod quicumque in eas aspiceret in
lapidem subito mutabatur / Et sic quod plures incaute respicientes visis illis
perierunt / fed perseus Miles Clipeo palladis gladio que mercu rij munitus eas
extra montem Athelantis cohabitantes auimo audaci abs que sui periculo
interfecit

IN Methamor it tells thus
o How yt a lord which phorcheus
a Ws hot had daughters three
Bnt upon her natyuyte
Such was the Constellacyon
That out of man's nacyon
Fro kind they be so myswent
That to lykenes of a serpent
They were both and that one
Of hem was cleped stellybone
That other suster Snryale
The third as tellyth in the tale
Me'ousa hight / and netheles
Of Common name Gorgones
In every country there about
As monstres which as men doubt
Men clepe hem and but one eye
Among hem three in pour party
They had of which they might see
Now has it this / now has it she
After the cause and need it lad
By throws each of hem it had
A wonder thing yet more amys
There was whereof I tell all this
What man on hem his chere cast
And hem byhelde he was als fast
Out of a man in to a stone
For shape / and thus many one
Deceived were of that they would
Mysloke where they ne should
But Perseus that worthy knight
Whom pallas of here great might
Halpe and took him a sheld thereto
And eke the god mercurye also
Lent him a swerd he as it fell
Beyond Athlans the high hylle
These monstres fought and there he fond
Diverse men of thylk land
Thorugh sight of hem mystorned were
Standed as stones here and there
But he which wisdom and pro wesse
Had of the god and of the goddess
The sheld of pallas began embrace
With which he couerd sauf his face
Mercurius swerd out he drough
And so he bare him that he slough
These dredeful monstres al three
Confessor
^O now my sone auyse the
That thou thy sight not mysuse
Case not thyn eye upon meduse
That thou be turned in to stone
For so wise man was never none
But if he wol his eye keep
And take of foul delight no keep
That with lust nys often nome
Thorugh streugthe of love and o^come
Of myllokyng how it has ferd
As I have told now have thou herd
My good son and take good head
And over this yet I the vede
That thou beware of thine heryng
Which to the heart the tydynge
Of many a wnyte has brought
And tarry with a man's thonght
And netheles good is to here
(...) thing whereof a man may lere
That to virtue is accordau^t
And toward all the remenaunt
Good is to torn his ere fro
For esses but if a man do so
Him may full often mysbefalle
I read ensample among all
Whereof to keep well an ere
It ought put a man in fere
hIc Confessor exemplum narrat vt non ab auris exaudicione fatua animus
deceptus inuoluatur / Et dicit qualiter ille serpens qui aspis wcatur quendam
preciosissimum lapidem nomine carbunculum in sue frontis medi o gesta^s contra
verba i^ cantantis aure^ vnam assigendo promit / et aliam sue caude stimulo
firmissime obturat

aSerpent which that aspydis
Is cleped of his kind has this /
That he the stone noblest of all /
Which that me^ carbu^cle call
Bears in his head above on hight
For which that a man by sliyghte
The stone to win and him to daunte
With his corecte him would enchau^te
Anon as he perceyueth that
He leyth down his one ere al plat
Unto the gronnde and hold it fast
And eke the the other als fast
He stops with his taylle so sore
That he the words less ne more
Of his enchauntement ne heveth
And in this wise him self he skyeveth
So that he has the words wayued
And thns his ere is naught deceived
Aliud exemplum super eodem qualiter Rex vlixes cum a bello Troiano versus
Greciam nauigio remearet et prope illa monstra maxima Sirenes nuncupata
angelica voce canorano ipsum ventorum aduersitate nauigare oporteret omnium
nautarum suorum aures obturari coegit

iN other thing who yt records
Lyche unto this sample acordeth
Which in the Tale of Troy I find
Syrenes of a wonder kind
Ben monstres as the books bellen
And in the greet see they duellen
Of body both and of vysage
Like to the women of young age
Up fro the nauyl on high they be
And down bynethe as men may see
They bear of fysshes the figure
And oner this of such nature
They be that with so sweet a steuene
Like to the melodye of heuene
In women's wys they sing
With notes of so great lykyng
Of such mesure of such mysyke
Whereof the ships they beswyke
That passen by the costs there
For when the shipmen lay an ere
Unto the wyce in here advyce
They wene it be of paradys
Which after to hem is an hell
For reason may not with hem duelle
When they the great lusts here
They can not here ships stere
So besylyche upon the note
They herkene and in such wise assote
That they her right course and weye
Foryete / and to here ere obey
And saylen till it so byfalle
That they in to peril fall
Where as the ships be to draw
And they be with the monstres slawe
But fro this peril netheles
With his wysedom king vlyxes
Escapes and it over passes
For he to fore her hand compasses
That noman of his company
Has power unto that folly
His ere for no lust to cast
For he hem stopped als fast
That none of hem may here hem sing
So when they forth come saylyng
There was such governance on hand
That they the monstres have withsto^d
And slough of hem a great party
Thus was he saut with his nauye
This wise king thorugh governance
Confessor
Whereof my sone in remembrance
Thou might ensample take here
As I have told and what thou here
Be well ware and give no credence
But if thou see more euydence
For if thou would take keep
And wisely couthest ward and keep
Thine eye and ere as I have spoke
Than had thou the gates stoke
Fro such felye as comyth to win
Thyn hertes wit which is within
Whereof that now thy love excedeth
Mesure and many a pain bredeth
But if thou couthest set in rewle
Tho two the three were ethe to rewle
For thy as for thy wits five
I wol as now no more shryue
But only of these ylke two
Tell me therefore if it be so
Have thou thine eye ought myschrow*
Amans
mY fader ye I am bekuowe
I have hem cast upon meduse
Thereof I may me naught excuse
Mine heart is grown in to stone
So that my lady thereupon
Has such a prynte of such a grave
That I can naught my self save
Opponit Confessor
wHat say you sone as of thyn ere
mY fader I am gyltyf there
For when I may my lady here
My wit with that has lost his steve
I do naught as Ulyxes deed
But fall anon upon the stead
Where as I see my lady stand
And there I do you understand
I am so pulled in my thought
So that of reason leueth naught
Whereof that I may me defend
-- Confessor
mY good son god the amend
For as me thinks by thy spech
Thy wits be right for to seche
As of thyn ere and of thine eye
I wol no more specyfye
But I wol axen over this
Of other things how that it is
Celsior est aquila que leone forcior ille / Quem tumor elati cordis ad alta
mouet / Sunt species quinque / quibus est superbia ductrix / Clamat et in
multis mundus adheret eis / Lauando faciem ficto pallore subornat. Fraudibus
Ipocrisis melle verba suis / Sic que pios animos quod sepe ruit muliebres / Ex

hIc loquitur quod septem sunt peccata mortalia / quorum caput superbia vanas

vicium Confessor Amanti declarat /

mY sone as i shall the inform
There ben yet of another form
Of dedly vices seven applied
Whereof the heart is often plied
To thing which after shall him grieve
The^ first of hem thou shall believe
Is pride which is princypal
And has with him in especyal
Mynystres syue full diverse
Of which the I shall reherce
The first is said Ipocrysye
If thou art of his compauye
Tell forth my sone and shryue the clean
Amans
iWote not fadre what ye mean
Bnt this I would you beseech
That ye me by somwey teache
What is to ben an Ipocryte
And if I be for to wit
I wol beknowe as it is
mY sone an Ypocryte is this
A man which feyneth co^seyen
As though it were al innocence
Without and is not so within
And does so for he would win
Of his desire the wine astate
And anon when he come there at
He she weth than what he was
The corn is turned in to gras
That was a Rose is than a thorn
And he that was a lamb byforne
Is than a wolf and thus malice
Under the color of Justice
As had / and as the people tells
These ordres wyten where he duelleth
As he that of her counseyll is
And thylk world which they or this
Forsakes and drawn in ayene
He cloteth riches as men seyn
Under the symplest of pouerte
And does to seem of great deserte
Thing which is little worth within
He seyth in open fie to sin
And in secreet there is no vice
Of which that he nys noryce
And ever his chere is sobre and soft
And where he goth he blessed often
Whereof the blind world he dretcheth
But yet al only he ne stretches
His rewle upon Relygyon
But next to that condicyon
In such as clepe hem holy church
It shows eke how he can worche
Among the wide furred hodes
To get hem the worldly goods
And they hem self by thylke same
That setten most the world in blame
But yet in contrary of his lore
There is nothing they louen more
So that seemed of light they work
The deeds which are inward derke
And thus this double ypocrysye
Which is devout apparancye
A byser set upon his face
Whereof toward the worlds grace
He seems to be well right thewed
And yet his heart is al beshrewed
But netheles he stant byleued
And has his purpoos often acheued
Of worship and of worlds welthe
And takyth it as who said by stelthe
Thorugh couerture of his fallas
And right so in semblable caas
This vice has eke his officers
Among these other seculeres
Of great men for of the sinale
As for to account he set no tale
But they that pass the comune
With such hem like to comune
And where he says he would socoure
The people there he wol devour
For now a day is many one
Which speaks of Peter and of John
And thinks Judas in his heart
There shall no worlds good astert
His hand and yet he gives Alms
And fasteth often and hereth mess
With mea culpa which he seyth
Upon his breast full often he leyth
His hond and case up ward his eye
As though Crystes face he syghe
So that it seems at the sight
As he alone al other might
Rescue with his holy deed
But yet his heart in other stead
Among his bedys most devout
Goth in the worlds cause about
How that he might his waryson
Encrese / and in co^paryson
hIc tractat confessor cum ama^te super illa jpocrisia que sub amoris facie
fraudulenter lati tando mulieres ipsius ficticijs credulas sepissime decepit
innocents

There be lovers of such a sort
That feyne^ hem an humble port
And al is ypocrysye
Which with deceyte and flaterye
Has many a worthy wight begyled
For when he has his tongue be fyled
With soft speech and with lesyng
Forth with his false pytous lokyng
He would make a woman wene
To gone upon the fair grene
When that she fallyth in the mire
For he may have his desire
How so falls on the remenaunt
He halt no word of covenant
But or the time that helspede
There is no sloygthe in thylk deed
Which any lones faytour may
That he ne put it in assay
As him belonged for to done
The color of the reyny moan
With medycyne upon his face
He set / and than he axeth grace
As he which has sykenes feyned
When his vysage was so desteyned
With eye up cast on her he syketh
And many a contenaunce he pyketh
To bryngen her in to believe
Of thing which that he would acheue
Whereof he bears the pale hew
And for he would seem true
And makes him seek wha^ he is heyle
But when he berest lowest seyle
Than is he swyfeest to begyle
The woman which that ylke while
Set upon him faith or credence
mY sone if thou thy conseyence
Entamed have in such a wise
In shryfte thou might the auyse
And tell it me if it be so
Amans
Mine holy fadre certes no
And for to feyne such sykenesse
It needs naught for this witness
I take to god that my courage
Has be more seek than my vysage
And eke thus well I may auowe
So low couthe I never bo we
To feyne humylyte without
That me list better to loute
With all the thoughts of mine heart
For that thing shall me never sterte
I speak as to my lady dear
To make her any feyned chere
God Wot well there I lie naught
My chere has be such as my thought
For in good feith this leueth well
My will was better a thousand dele
Than any chere that i couthe
But Sire I have in my yougthe
Done otherwise in other place
I put me thereof in your grace
For this excusen i ne shall
That I have else oueral
To love and to his company
Be pleyne without ypocrysye
But there is one which that I ser^e
Al though I may no thank deserve
To whom yet never unto this day
I said onlyche ye or nay
But if it so were in my thought
As touchend other say I naught
That I am somdele for to wit
Of that ye clepe an Ipocryte
Confessor
mY sone it sit well every wight
To keep his thont in troth up right /
Toward love in all wise
For who that would him well advise
What has byfalle in this matere
He should naught with feyned chere
Deceive love in no degree
To love is enery heart fre
But in deceyt of that thou feynest
And thereupon thy lust atteynest
That thou have won with thy wyle
Though it be like for a while
Thou shall it afterward repent
And for to prove mine entente
I find ensample in a Cronyque
Of hem that love so beswyke
Quod Ipocrisia sit in amore pericu losa narrat exemplum qualiter sub reg no
Tiberij Imperatoris quidam miles nomine Mundns qui Romanoru^ dux milicie tune
prefuit Dominam Paulinam pulcherrima^ castitatis ^ famosissimam mediantibus
duobus falsis Presbiteris in Templo Isys domini sui se esse fingens sub fic^e
sauctitatis Ipocrisi nocturno tempore vicia^^t vn^ idem dux in exilium
presbiteri in mortem ob sui criminis enormitatem damp nati extiterant

IT byfesse by old days thus
Whylome the emperor Tiberius
The Monarche of Rome thus lad
There was a worthy Romayn had
A wife and she Pauline hight
Which was to every mannys sight
Of all the Cite the fairest
And as men sayden eke the lest
It is and has been ever yet
That so strong is that no man's wit
Which through beauty ne may be with
draw / To love and under the law
Of thylke frele bore kind
Which makes the heart eyes blind
Where no reason may be comuned
And in this wise so fortuned
This tale of which I wol mean
This wife which in her lusts grene
Was fresshe and tender of age
She may not let the courage
Of him that wol on her assote
There was a duk and he was hot
Mundus which had in his bayllye
To lead all the chyualrye
Of Rome and was a worthy knight
But he was naught of such might
The strength of love not to withsto^de
That he ne was brought to hand
That maulgry where he would or no
This young wife he loves so
That he has put al his assay
To win thing which he ne may
Get of her grant in no manner
By yefte of gold ne by prayer
And when he sa we that by no mede
Toward her love he might speed
By sleyght feyned than he wrought
And thereupon he him bythought
How that there was in the Cite
A temple of such auctoryte
To which with great devotion
The noble women of the town
Most comonlyche on pylgremage
Gone for to pray thylke image
Which the goddess of Chyldyng is
And cleped was by name Isys
And in her temple than were
To rewle and to mynystre there
After the law which was tho
Abouen al other prestes two
This duk which thout his love get
Upon a day hem two to mete
Has bid and they come at his haste
Where they had a rich feste
And after mete in preuy place
This lord which would his thank pur
chase / To each of hem than gaf a gift
And spak so that by way of shryfte
He drough hem in to his couyne
To help and shape how paulyne
After his lust deceive might
And they her trouthes both plyght
That they by night her should win
In to the temple and he therynne
Shall have of her al his intent
Thus acorded forth they went
Now list thorugh which Ipocrysye
Ordained was the trecherye
Whereof this lady was deceived
These prestes hadden well conceived
That she was of great holiness
And with a counterfeyt symplenesse
Which hyd was in falls courage
Feyned an heavenly message
They come and said to her thus
Paulyne the God Anubus
Has sent us both prestes here
And says he wol to the appear
By nyghtes time him self allone
For love he has to thy person
And thereupon he has us bid
That we in Isys Temple a stead
Honestly for the purueye
Where thou by night as we the seye
Of him shall take a vysyon
For upon thy condycyon
The which is chaste and full of feyth
Such price as he us told he leyth
That he wol stand of thyn acord
And for to bear hereof record
He send us hyder both two
Glad was her Innocence tho
Of such words as she herd
With humble chere and thus ansuerd
And said that the gods will
She was al ready to fulfylle
That by her housbondes leave
She would in Isys Temple at eve
Upon her gods grace abide
To seruen him by night tide
The prestes gone home tho again
And she goth to her sovereign
Of gods will and as it was
She told him all the pleyne cas
Whereof he was deceived eke
And bad that she should her meke
Al hoole unto the gods heeste
And thus she which was honest
To god ward after her intent
At night to the temple went
Where that the false prestes were
And they receyuen her there
With such a tokue* of holiness
As though they sawen her Goddess
And al within a preuy place
A soft bed a large space
They had made and enterc^rteyned
Where she was afterward engyned
But she which al honor supposes
The false prestes than opposes
And axeth by what obseruaunce
She might most to the plesau^ce
Of god that nyghtes reule keep
And they her bydden for to sleep
Lyggend upon the bed a lofte
For so they sayden al stylle and soft
God Anubus her would awake
The counseylle in this wise take
The priests fro this lady gone
And she that wist of gyle none
In the manner as it was said
Tho to sleep upon the bed is leyd
In hope that she should acheue
Thing which stood than upon bileue
Fulfilled of all holiness
But she has failed as I guess
For in a closet fast by
The duk was hyd so pryuely
That she might not perceive
And he that thought to deceive
Has such array upon nome
That when he would unto her come
It should seem at her eye
As though she verily syghe
God Anubus and in such a wise
This ypocryyte of his queyntyse
Awayteth ever till she slepte
And than out of his place he crepte
So stylle that she nothing herd
And to the bed stalkynge he ferde
And suddenly or she it wist
Beclypt in arms he her kyst
Whereof in womannysshe ^rede
She wooke and nyst what to read
But he with soft words mylde
Comfort her and said with child
He would her make in such a kind
That all the world shall have in mind
The worship of that ylke sone
For he shall with gods wone
And ben him self a god also
With such words and with moo
The which he feyneth in his speech
This ladies wit was al to seche
As she which al troth weneth
But he that al untruth meneth
With blind tales so her lad
That al his will of her he had
And when him thout it was ynou
Again the day he him withdrough
So pryuely that she ne wyste
Where he bycome as he list
Out of the temple be goth his way
And she bygan to bydde and pray
Vpond the bare ground knelend
And after that made her offrende
And to the prestes yeftes great
She yafe and home ward in the street
The dnke her met and said thus
The mighty god which Annbus
^s hot he save the paulyne
For thou art of his disciplyne
So holy that no man's might
May do that he has do to night
Of thing which thou have ever esche
ued / But I his grace have so pursued
That I was made his lyeutenaunt
For thy by way of covenant
Fro this day for ward I was thine
And if the like to be mine
That stond upon thine own will
sHe herd this tale and bare it stylle
And home she went as it bifelle
In to her chambr^ and there she fille
^^on her bed to weep and cry
And said O derke ypocrysye
Thorugh whose dissimulacyon
Of falls ymagynacyon
I am wykkedly thus deceived
But that I have it apperceyued
I thank vuto the gods all
For though it thus byfalle
I shall never eft whiles I live
And thylk auowe to god I give
And thus wepend she compleyneth
Her fair face and al dysteyneth
With woeful teres her eye
So that upon this agonye
Her housbond is in come
And saw how she was overcome
With sow we and axeth her what her ey
leth, And she with yt her self bewei^eth
Well more than she did therefore
And said allas wyfhode is love
In me which whysome was honest
I am no more than a beeste
Now am I defouled of two
And as she might speak tho
Ashamed with a pytous onde
She told unto her housbonde
The sothe of all the hole tale
And in her speech deed and pale
She swouneth well nyghe to the last
And he her in arms fast
Vphelde and often swore his oath
That he with her is nothing wroth
For well he wot she may there nout
But netheles within his thought
His heart stood in a sorry plyght
And said he would of that despyte
Be auengyd how so ever it fall
And sent unto his friends all
And when they were comen in fere
He told hem upon this matere
And axed hem what was to done
And they auysed were sone
And said it thought hem for the best
To set his wife first in rest
And after pleyne to the king
Upon the matter of this thing
Tho was his woeful wife comforted
By all ways and disported
Till that she was somdele amended
And thus they a day or tuo dispe^ded
The third day she goth to pleyne
With many a worthy Cytezeyne
And he with many a Cytezeyne
When the emperor it herd seyne
And knew the falshede of the vice
He said he would do Iustyee
And first he let the prestes take
And for they should it not forsake
He put hem in to question
But they of suggestion
Ne could not one word refuse
Bnt for they would hem self excuse
The blame upon the duke they laid
But there ayene the cou^seyl said
That they be naught excused so
For he is one and they be two
And two have more wit than one
So thylke excusement was none
And over that was said hem eke
Than when men would virtue seek
Men should it in the prestes find
Her order is of so high a kind
That they be tuterers of the weye
For thy if any man forswey
Thorugh hem they be not excusable
And thus by law reasonable
Among the wise Inges there
The prestes both dampened were
So that the preuy trecherye
Hyd under falls ypocrysye
Was than openly showed
That many a man hem has beshrewed
And when the prestes were deed
The temple of thylke horrible deed
They thoughten purge and thylk image
Whose cause was the pylgremage
They drouen out and also fast
Fer in to the Tyber they it cast
Where the River it has defied
And thus the temple puryfyed
They have of thylke horrible sin
Which was that time do therynne
Of this point was thus advise
But of the duk was otherwise
For he with love was bestad
His dome was naught so hard lad
For love put reason awey
And can naught see the right wey
And by this cause he was respyted
So that the death him was acquyted
But for all that he was exybed
For he his love had so begyled
That he shall never come ayene
For he that is to truth vnpleyne
He may not faylen of vengeance
aNd to taken remembrance
Of that ypocrysye has wrought
On other halue men shall naught
To lightly leave all that they here
But than should a wyseman stere
The ship when such wyndes blow
For first thouh they begin low
At end they be naught meuable
But al to broke mast and cable
So that the ship with sodeyne blast
When men lest wene is over cast
As now fuloften a man may see
And of old time how it has be
I find a great experyence
Whereof to take euydence
Good is and to be war also
Of the peril or him be woe
hIc vlterius ponit exemplum de illa ecia^ Ipocrisia que inter viru^ and viru^
decipie^s periculosissima consistit Et narrat qualiter Greci in obsidione
ciuitatis Troy cum ipsam vi apprehendene nnllatenns potuerunt fallaci animo
cum Troianis vt dicu^t pro perpetuo statuebant and super hoc quendam equm mire
grossionis de ere fabricatum ad sacrificandum in templo Minerue confingentes

oF hem yt ben so derk wit^
At troy also if we begyn^
Ipocrysye it has bytrayd
For when ye greeks had al assayed /
And fond that by no bataill
Ne by no syege it might auayll
The town to win through pro wesse
This vice feyned of symplesse
Thorugh sleyghte of Calcas and Cryse
It wan by such a manner wise
An horse of bras they let do forge
Of such entaylle and of such a forge
That in this world was never man
That such another werk began
The crafty werkman Epius
It made and for to tell thus
The greeks that thoughten to begyle
The king in Troy in thylke while
With Anthenor and with Enee
That were both of the Cite
And of the counseylle the wysest
The rychest and the myghtyest
In pryue place so they trete
With fair byhestes and yeftes great
Of gold that they have engyned
To gedre and when they be couyned
They feynen for to make a pees
And under that yet nevertheless
They shopen the destructyon
Both of the king and of the Town
And thus the false pees was take
Of hem of Greece and undertake
And thereupon they fond awey
Where strength might not awey
That sleyghte should help thanne
And of an ynche a large spanne
By color of pees they made
And telden how they were glade
Of that they stonden in acord
And for it shall ben of record
Unto the king of Troy sayden
By way of love and thus they pra yden
As they that would his thank deserve
A sacryfyce unto myuerne
The pers to keep in good intent
They must offer or that they went
The king counseyled in the cas
By Anthenor and Eneas
Thereto has youen his assent
So was the pleyne truth blent
Thorugh counterfete ypocrysye
Of that they sholden sacryfye
The Greeks under the holiness
Anon with all business
Here horse of bras let fair dyghte
Which was to seen a wonder syghte
For it was trapped of him selue
And had of small wheles twelve
Upon the which men enough
With craft toward ye Town it drough
And goth glystrend against the son
Tho was there joy enough begone
For Troy in great denocyon
Came also with procession
Against this noble sacryfyse
With great honor and in this wise
Unto the gates they it brought
But of here intent when they sought
The gates weren al to small
And thereupon was many a tale
But for the worship of Mynerue
To whom they comen for to serve
They of the Town which understood
That all this thing was do for good
For pees / whereof they be glade
The gates that Neptunus made
A thousand winter there to fore
They have anon to broke and tore
The strong wallys down they break
So that in to the large street
This horse with great solempnyte
Was brought within the Cite
And offered with great reverence
Which was to Troy an euydence
Of love and pees for euermo
The Gregoys token leave tho
With all the hole felauship
And forth they wenten in to ship
And crossen sail and made hem yare
Anon as though they wolden fare
But when the blak winter night
Without Moan or sterre light
Bederked has the water stronde
Al pryuely they gone on land
Full armed out of the nauye
Simon which was made her efpye
Within Troy as was co^spyred
When time was a tokne fyred
And with that their wey they holden
And comen right as they wolden
There as the gates were to broke
The purpoos was full take and spoke
Er any man may take keep
While that the Cite was a sleep
They slowen all that was within
And token what they might wyn
Of such good as was suffysaunt
And brenden up the remenaunt
And thus come out the trecherye
Which under falls ypocrysye
Was hyd / and they that wened pees
Tho myghten find no relees
Of thylk swerd which al devoured
Fulofte and thus the sweet soured
When it is know to the taste
He spylleth many a word wast
That shall with such a people trete
For when he weneth most beyete
Than is he shape most to leese
And right so if a woman chese
Upon the words that she hereth
Some man when he most true appears
Than is he forthest fro the truth
But yet fulofte and that is routhe
They speden that be most untrue
And louen every day a new
Whereof the lyef is after loath
And love has cause to be wroth
But that man that his lust desires
Of love and thereupon conspyreth
With weeds feyned to deceive
He shall not fail to receive
His pain as it is often seen
Confessor
For thy my sone as I the mean
It fyt the well to take heed
That thou eschew of thy manhede
Ipocrysye and his semblaunt
That thou ne naught be deceyuaunt
To make a woman to believe
Thing which is not in thy believe
For in such feynt Ipocrysye
Of love is all the trecherye
Thorugh which love is deceyned often
For feyned semblannt is so soft
Uneaths love may beware
For why sone as I well dare
I charge the to fle that vice
That many a woman it has made nyce
But look thou dele not with all
Iwys fadre no more I shall
Confessor
Now sone keep that thou have swore
For this that thou have herd before
Is said the first point of pride
And next upon that other side
To shryne and speak over this
Touchend of pride yet there is
The point second I the behote
Which Inobedyence is hot
Flectere quod fra^gi melius reputatur and olle Fictilis ad cacabu^ pugna
valere neqit / Que^ nez lex hoi^m nez lex diui^a valebit / / Flectere
multocie^s cord reflectit amor / Que^ non flectit amor non flec tendus ab illo
/ Sed rigor illius plus ele phante riget / Ded gnatur amor poterit quos scire
rebels / Et rudibus sorte^ prestat habere rudem / Sed qui spo^te sui subicit
se cordis amore / Frangit in aduersis omnia fata pius

hIc loquitur de secu^da specie superbie que Inobediencia dicitur / Et primo
illius vicij natural simpliciter declarat Et tractat co^sequente* super illa
obedie^cia que in curia Cupidinis exosa amoris cam^ ex sua i^besillitate
sepissime retardat

it is vice of Inobediencie
Again the reule of co^seyence
Al yt is humble he disaloweth
That he toward his god ne boweth
After the laws of his heste
Not as a man but as a best
Which goth upon his lusts wild
So goth this proud vice vnmylde
That he dysdeyneth al law
He not what is to be felawe
And serve he may not for pride
So is he led on every side
And is that selue of whom me^ speak
Which wol not bow or that he break
I not if love might him plye
For else for to Iustyfye
His heart I not what might duayle
For thy my sone of such entayle
If that thyn heart be disposed
Tell out and let it naught be glosed
For if that thou vnbuxome be
To love I not in what degree
Thou shall thy good world acheue
Amans
My fadre ye shall well believe
The young whelpe which is affayted
Has not his master better waited
To couche when he seyth go low
Than I anon as I may know
My lady will ne bow more
But other while I grutche sore
Of some things that she does
Whereof tha. I wol tell soth
For of two points I am bethout
That I would I might naught
Obey unto my lady hest
But I dar make this byhest
Sauf only of that ylke two
I am vnbuxome of no mo
Confessor opponit
What / ben tho two tell on quod he
My fader this is one that she
Commands me my mouth to close
And that I should naught here oppose
In love of which I often preche
But preuelyche of such a speech
Forbere and suffer her in pees
But that ne might I netheles
For all this world obey I wys
For when I am there as she is
Though she my tales naught allow
Ayene her will yet mote I bow
To seche if that I might have grace
But that thing may I not embrace
For ought that I can speak or do
And yet full often I speak so
That she is wroth and says be stylle
For I that heest shall fulfylle
And thereto ben obedyent
Than is my cause fully shent
For speech les may noman speed
So wot I not what is to read
But certes I may naught obey
That I ne mote algates seye
Somewhat of that I would mean
For ever it is alyche grene
The great love which I have
Whereof I can not both save
My speech and this obedyence
And thus fulofte my silence
I break and is the first point
Whereof that I am out of point
In this and yet it is no pride
Now then upon that other side
To tell my disobeysaunce
Full sore it stant to my greuaunce
And may not synke in to my wytt
For oftyme she me bytt
To leave her and chese a new
And says if I the soth knew
How fer I stand out of her grace
I should love in other place
But thereof wol I disobeye
For also well she might seye
Go take the moon where it sytte
As bring that in to my wit
For there never roted tree
That stood so fast in his degree
That I ne stand more fast
Upon her love and may cast
Mine heart awey as though I would
For god wot though I never should
Seen her with eye after this day
Yet stont it so that I ne may
Her love out of my breast renew
This is a wondre retenue
That maulgre where she wol or none
Mine heart is ever more in one
So that I can none other chese
But whether that I win or lose
I mote her love till I deye
And thus I break as by that weye
Here hestes and here commau^dynges
But trulyche in none other things
For thy my fadre what is more
Touchand to this ylke lore
I you byseche after the form
That ye pleynly me would inform
So that I might mine heart reule
In loves cause after the reule
Murmur in aduersis ita co^cipit ille superbus. ^ena quod ex bina sort pur get
eum / O bina fortune cum spes in amore resistit / Non sine mentali murmr
plangit amans

h Ic loquitur de murmr and pla^c tu qui super oe^s alios inobedie^cie
secreciores vt ministre illi deseruiant

tOward the vice of which we trete /
There be twey of thilk estrete*
Here name is murmur and co^pleynt /
There can noman here chere peynt.
To set a glad se^blaunt therinne
For though fortune make hem win
Yet grutche they and if they lose
There is no weye for to chese
Whereof they might stand appesed
So be they comonlych dysesed
There may no welthe ne pouerte
Attempren hem to the deserte
Of buxomnesse by no wise
For oftyme they despise
The good fortune as the badde
As they no man's reason had
Thorugh pride whereof they be blind
And right of such a manner kind
There be lovers that though they have
Of love all that they would crave
Yet wol they grutche by sum weye
That they would naught to love obey
Upon the truth as do should
And hem lakketh that they would
Anon they shall in such a pain
That ever vnbuxomly they pleyne
Upon fortune they curse and cry
That they would not her hertes plye
To suffer till it better fall
For thy if thou among all
Have used this condycyon
My sone in thy confession
Now tell me pleynly what thou art
My fadre I know well a part
So that ye tell here above
Of murmur and compleynt of love
That for I see no speed comende
Against fortune compleynende
I am as who says for euermo
And eke fuloftyme also
When so is that I see and here
Or heavy word or heavy chere
Of my lady I grutche anon
But words dar I speak none
Whereof she might be displesyd
But in mine heart I am dysesed
With many a murmour god it wot
Thus drink I in mine own swote
And though I make no semblaunt
Mine heart is al disobeysaunt
And in this wise I me confess
Of that ye clepe vnbuxomnesse
Now tell what your counseyl is
Confessor
My sone and I read this
What so byfalle of other weye
That thou to loves lust obey
As fer as thou it might suffyse
Fulofte sith in such a wise
Obedyence in love avails
Where al a man's strength fails
Whereof if thou list to wit
In a Cronyque as it is write
A great Ensample thou might find
Which is now comen to my mind
Ic contra amori inobedientes ad co^mendacione^ obediencie confessor super
eodem Exemplum ponit vbi di at que q^dam Regis Sealie filia in sue iuuentucis
floribus pulcherrime ex eius Nouerce Incantacionibus in vetulam turpissimam
transformata excitit / Flo rencius tunc Imperatoris Claudi Nepos Miles in armis
strennuissimus amorosus que legibus intendens ex sua obediencia in
pulcritudinem pristinam reformauit

There was whylom by days old
A worthy knight as men ^old
He was neue we to them perour
And of his Court a Courteour
Wyfles he was Florent he hyghte
He was a man that mochel might
Of arms he was desirous
Chyualrous and amerous
And fame of worlds speech
Strange auentures for to seche
He rood the marches all about
And fell a time when he was out
Fortune which may every threde
To break and knytte of man's speed
Shope as this knight rood in a pas
That he by strength take was
And to a Castle they him ladde.
Where that he few friends had
For so it fell that ylke stou^de
That he had a dedely wound
Frghtend his own hands slain
Branchus which to the Capytayn
Was sone and heir whereof ben wroth
The fadre and the modre both
That knyt Branchus was of his ho^de
The worthyest of al his land
And seyn they would do vengeance
Upon Florent but remembrance
That they took of his worthynes
Of knyghthode and of gentylnes
And how he stood of cosynage
To the emperor took assuage
And durst not sleyn him for fere
In great despute son they were
Among hem self that was the best
There was a lady the slyest
Of all that men knew tho
So old she might uneaths go
And was grandame unto the deed
And with that bygan to read
And she said she would bring him ynne
That she shall him to death win
Al only of his own grant
Thorugh strength of very covenant
Without blame of any wight
Anon she sent for this knight
And of her sone she aleyde
The death / and thus to him she seyde
Florent hou so thou be to wit
Of Branchus death men shall respyte
As now to take a^engement
Be so thou stand in Judgment
Upon certain condycyon
That thou unto a questyon
Which I shall axe shall ansuere
And over this thou shall eke swear
That if thou of the soth fail
There shall none other thing avail
That thou ne shall the death receive
And for men shall the not deceive
That thou thereof might be aduysed
Thou shall have day and time assysed
And love saufly for to wend
Be so that at thy days end
Thou come again with thyn auyse
This knyt which was worthy and wise
This lady prays that he may wit
And have it under seals write
What question it should be
For which he shall in that degree
Stand of his life in Ieopardye
With that she feyneth company
And says Florent on love it longs
All that to mine axyng longs
What al women most desire
This wol I axe and in thempyre
Where thou have most knoulechyng
Take counceylle of this axyng
Florent this thing has undertake
The time was set and day take
Under his seal he wrote his oath
In such a wise and forth he goth
Home to his emes court again
To whom his adventure pleyne
He told of that him is byfalle
And upon that they were all
The wysest of the land assent
But netheles of one assent
They might not acorde plat
One said this another that
After the disposicion
Of natural complexyon
To sum woman it is plesau^ce
That to another is greuaunce
But such a thing in specyal
Which to hem al in general
Is most plesaunt and most desired
Above al other and most conspyred
Such one can they not find
By Constellacyon ne by kind
And thus Florent without cure
Must stand upon his adventure
And is al shape unto the lyere
And as in defaulte of his ansuere
This knight has lever for to dye
Than break his truth and for to lie
In place where he was swore
And shapith him gone ayene therefore
When time come he took his leave
That longer would he not believe
And prayth his eme he be not wroth
For that is a point of his oath
He says that noman shall him wreke
Though afterward here men speak
That he parauenture dye
And thus he went forth his weye
Alone as a knight auenturous
And in his right was curyous
To wit what was best to do
And as he rode alone so
And came nyghe there he would be
In a forest there under a tree
He saw where sat a creature
A lothly womannyssh figure
That for to speak of flessh and bone
So foul yet saw he never none
This knight byheld her redely
And as he would have passed by
She cleped him and bad him abide
And he his horse head a side
Tho turned and to her he rode
And there he houed and abode
To wit what she would mean
And she bygan him to be mean
And said Florent by thy name
Thou have on hand such a game
That if thou be not better auysed
Thy death shapen is and devised
That all the world ne may the save
But if that thou my counceyl have
Florent when he this tale herd
Unto this old wight ansuerd
And of her counseyl he her prayed
And she ayene to him thus said
Florent if I for the so shape
That thou thorugh me thy death escape
And take worship of thy deed
What shall I have to my mede
What thing quoth he yt thou would axe
I bid never a better tax
Quod she but first or thou be sped
Thou shall me leave such a wed
That I wol have thy troth on hand
That thou shall be mine husbonde
Nay said Florent that may not be
Ride then forth thy wey quod she
And if thou go forth without read
Thou shall be sekerlyche deed
Florent behyght good enough
Of land of rent of park of plough
But all that she compteth naught
Tho fell this knyt in mochel thout
Now goth he^ forth / now comes ayene
He not what is best to seyne
And thought as he rode to and fro
That chose he mote one of the two
Or for to take her to his wife
Or else to lose his life
And than he cast his advantage
That she was of so great an age
That she may live but a while
And thought to put her in an I Will
Where that noman her should know
Till she with death were overthrow
And thus this young lusty* knight
Unto this old lothely wight
Tho said if that none other chance
May make my delyueraunce
But only thylke same speech
Which as thou ^eyst thou shall me
teache / Have here mine ho^d I shall ye
Wedde / And thus his troth he leid to
Wedde^ With yt she frou^ceth up yt browe
This covenant wol I allow
She says if any other thing
But that thou have of my techyng
Fro death thy body may respyte
I wol the of thy truth acquyte
And else by none other weye
Now harken me what I shall seye
When thou art come in to the place
Where now they maken great manace
And upon thy coming abide
They wol anon the same tide
Oppose the of thine ansuere
I wot thou wolt no thing forbere
Of that thou wenest be thy best
And if thou might so find rest
Well is for than is there more
And else this shall be my lore
That thou shall say upon this molde
That al women leuest would
Be sovereign of man's love
For what woman is so above
She says as who says al her will
And else may she naught fulfylle
What thing were here leuest have
With this ansuer thou shall save
Thy self and otherwise naught
And when thou have thy end wrout
Come here ayene thou shall me find
And let nothing out of thy mind
He goth him forth with heavy chere
As ^e that not in what manner
He may this, worlds Joy atteyne
For if he dye he has a pain
And if he live he mote him bind
To such a wytche of old kind
Of women the vnsemelyest
Thus wot he not what is the best
But be him lyef or be him *loath
Unto the Castle forth he goth
His full ansuere for to give
Or for to dye or for to live
Forth with his counseyll came the lord
The things stonden of record
He send up for the lady sone
And forth she came that old moan
In presence of the remenaunt
The strength of all the covenant
Tho was reherced openly
And to Florent she bad par die
That shall tellen his auys
As he that wot what is the prys
Florent says all that ever he couthe
But such word came none to mouth
That he for yefte or for byheste
Might any wise his death areste
And thus he taryeth long and late
Till this lady bad algate
That shall for the dome fynal
Give his ansuere in specyal
Of that she had first opposed
And than he has truly supposed
That he him may of nothing yelpe
But if so be tho words help
Which as the woman has him taut
Whereof he has an hope caught
That he shall be excused so
And told out pleyne his will tho
And when this matrone herd
The manner how this knight ansuerd
She said treson woe the be
That have thus told the pryuyte
Which al women most desire
I would that thou were on fire
But netheles in such a plyght
Florent of his ausuer is quyt
And tho bygan his soro we new
For he mote gone or be untrue
To her which his truth had
But he which al shame drad
Goth forth instead of his penance
And takes the fortune of his chance
As he that was with troth affayted
This old wight him has awayted
In place where* as he her in* left
Florent his woeful head up lift
And saw this where that she sytte
Which was the lothest wyghte
That ever man cast on his eye
Here nose^baas *her brows high
Her eyes small and deep set
Her chekes ben with teres weet
And ryuelyn as in an empty skyn
Hangyng down unto the chyn
Her lyppes ben shronken for age
There* was no grace in her vysage
Her front was narwe her locks hoar
She looks forth as does a more
Her neck is short her shulders courbe
That might a man's lust distourbe
Here body great and no thing small
And shortly for to descryue her all
She has no lyth without a lak
But lyche unto the wolle sak
She profereth her unto this knight
And bad him as he behyght
So as she bath by his warrant
That he her held covenant
And by the brydel she him seseth
But god wot how yt she him pleseth
Of such words as she speaks
Him thinks well nyghe his heart bre
keth / *For sorrow that he may fle
But if he would untrue be
Look how a seek man for his hele
Takes baldemony with canele
And with the myrre the sucre
Right on such manner lucre
Stant Florent in this dyete
He drynketh the bitter with the sweet
He medleth sorrow with lykyng
And lives as who says deyng
His thought shall be cast awey
Upon such one as that the wey
Is old and lothly oueralle
But need he mote that need shall
He would algate his truth hold
As every knight thereto is hold
What hap so ever to him is fall
Though she be foulest of all
The honor of womanhede
Him thought he should take heed
So that for pure gentilnesse
As he couthe her best adresse
In rags as she was to tore
He set her on his horse to fore
And forth he takes his weye soft
No wonder though he sygheth often
But as an oule flees by night
Out of al other birds sight
Right so this knight on days broad
In close him held and shope his rode
On nyghtes time till the tide
That he come there he would abide
And pryuely without noise
He brings this foul great coyse
To his Castle in such a wise
That noman might her shap auyse
Till she in to chamber came
Where he his preuy counseylle name
Of such men as he most trust
And told hem that he needs must
This best wedde unto his wife
For else he had lost his life
The pryue women were assent
That should be of his assent
Her rags they anon of draw
And as it was that time law
She had bath she had rest
And was arrayed to the best
But with no craft of combs broad
They might d^esse her locks shode
And she ne would not be shore
For no counseyl and therefore
With such attire as tho was used
Ordeynen that it was excused
And had so craft lyche about
That noman might seen hem out
But when she was fully arrayed
And her attire was al assayed
Tho she was fouler unto se
But yet it may none other be
They were wedded by night
So woe begone was never knight
As he was than of Marriage
And she bygan to play and rage
As who says I am well enough
But he thereof nothing ne lough
For she took than chere on hand
And clepeth him her husbonde
And said my lord go we to bed
For I to that intent wedde
For thou shall be my worlds bliss
And profereth him with that to kiss
As she a lusty lady were
His body might well be there
But as of thought and memory
His heart was in purgatory
But the strength of matrimonye
Who might make none essonye
That he mote algate plye
To gone to bed of company
And when they were abed naked
Without sleep he was awaked
He torneth on that other side
For that he would his eyes hyde
For lokyng on the foul wight
The chamber was full of light
The curteyne were of sendal thynne
This new bryd which lay withynne
Though it be naught with his acord
In arms she beclypt her lord
And prayed as he was turned her fro
He would him torn ayeneward tho
For now she said we be both one
But he lay stylle as any stone
But ever m one she spak and praide
And bad him think on that he said
When that he took her by the hand
hE herd and understood the bond
How he was set to his penance
And as it were a man in a trance
He torneth him al suddenly
And saw a lady lay him by
Of eyghtene winter age
Which was the fairest of vysage
That ever m all this world he syghe
And as he would have take her nyghe
She put her hand and by his love
Besought him that he would love
And says for to win or lose
He mote one of two things chese
Where he wol have such on night
Or else upon the days light
For ye shall not have both two
And he bygan to sorrow tho
In many a wise and cast his thought
But for all that yet could he naught
Deuyse him self which was the best
And she that would his heart rest
Prayth that he should chese algate
Till at the last long and late
He said O ye my lines hele
Say what ye list in my quarele
I not what ansuer I shall yiue
But ever while that I live
I wol that ye be my Maystresse
For I can not my self guess
Which is the best unto my choys
Thus grant I you mine hole voys
Chese for us both I you pray
And what as ever that ye say
Right as ye wol so wol I
mY lord she said grant mercy
For of this word yt ye now sayn
That ye have made me souerayn
My destyne is ouerpassed
That never here after shall be lassed
My beauty which I now have
Till I be take in to my grave
Both Night and day as I am now
I shall alwey be such to you
The kings daughter of Cecyle
I am / and fell but sith a while
As I was with my fader late
That my stepmoder for an hate
Which to ward me she has bygonne
Forshope me tylle I had won
The love and the soueraynte
Of what knight that in his degree
Al other passes of good name
As men seyn ye be the same
The deed proves it is so
Thus am I your for euermo
Tho was plesaunce and joy Enough
Echone with other played and lough
They live long and well they ferde
And Clerks that this chance herd
They written it in euydence
To teache how that obedyence
May well fortune a man to love
And set him in his lust above
As it byfelle unto this knight
fOr thy my sone if you do right
Thou shall unto thy love obey
And follow her will by all weye
Amans
Mine holy fader so I will
For ye have told me such a skylle
Of this ensample now to fore
That I shall euermo therefore
Here after mine obseruaunce
To love and his obeysaunce
The better keep and over this
Of pride if there ought else is
Whereof that I me shryue shall
What thing it is m specyal
My fadre axeth I you pray
Confessor
nOw lest my sone and I shall say
For yet there is surquedrye
Which stant of pride of company
Whereof that thou shall here anon
To know if thou have gylt or none
Upon the form as thou shall here
Now understand well the matere
oMnia scire / putat sed se presumpci o nescit / Nec sibi consimile quem putat
esse parem / Qui magis astutus reputat se vincere bellum. In laqueos veneris

in vacuas spes redit ipsa vias

h Ic loquitur de tercia specie super bie que presumpcio dicitur cuius naturam
primo secundum vicium confessor simpliciter declarat

s Vrquedrye is thylk vice
Of pride which ye third office
Has in his court and will not know /
The truth til he be outhrowe
Upon his fortune and his grace
Comes had I wist full often a place
For he does al his thing by guess
And voydeth al sykernesse
None other counsel good him seems
But such as he him self demeth
For m such wise as he compasses
His wit al other passes
And is with pride so through sought
That he al three set at naught
And weneth of him seluen so
That such as he there be nomo
And thus he would bear a price
So fair so semely nor so wise
Abouen al other and naught for thy
He says not ones grant mercy
To god / which al grace sends
So that his wits he dispendeth
Upon him self as though there were
No god which might avail there
But al upon his own wit
He stant till he fall in the pytte
So far that he may not arise
h Ic tractat confessor cum amante super illa saltem presumpcione ex cuius
superbia quod plures fatui amantes cum maioris certitudinis m amore spe^ sibi
promittunt inexpediti cicius destituuntur,

a Nd right thus in the same wise
The vice upon the cause of love
So proudely set the heart above
And does him pleynly for to wene
That he to louen any queen
Has worthynes and suffysaunce
And so without purueannce
Full often he heueth up so high
That Chyppes fallen in his eye
And eke fulofte he weneth this
There as he naught byloued is
To be loved al there best
Now sone tells what so the lest
Of this that I have told the here
Amans
hA fader be naught in a were
I trow there be noman less
Of any manner worthynesse
That halt him less worthy than I
To be byloued and not for thy
I say in excusing of me
To al men that love is fre
And certes that may noman werne
For love of him self so derne
It luteth in a man's heart
But that me shall not asterte
To wene for to be worthy
To louen but in her mercy
But sire of that ye would mean
That I should otherwise wene
To be byloued than I was
I am beknowe as in that cas
Confessor
My good sone tell me how

Amans
Now lest and I wol tell you
My good fadre how it is
Full often it has byfalle or this
Thorugh hope and was not certain
My wenyng has be set in vein
To trust in thing that help me nout
But onlyche of mine own thought
For as seems that a belle
Like to the words that men tell
Ansueryth right so no more ne less
To you my fadre I confess
Such will my wit has ever set
That what so hope me behet
Full many a time I wene it sothe
But finally no speed it does
Thus may I tell as I can
Wenyng begyleth many a man
So has it me right well I wot
For if a man wol in a boat
Which is without botome to we
He must needs onerthrowe
Right so wenyng has ferde by me
For when I wend next have be
As I by my wenyng cast
Than was I forthest at last
And as a fool my bow vnbende
When al was failed than I wend
For thy my fadre as of this
That my wenyng has gone amys
Touchend to Snrquedrye
Give me my penance or I dye
But if ye would in any form ^
Of this matter a tale inform
Which were ayene this vice set
I should fare well the bet
hIc ponit confessor exemplum co^ tra illos qui in suis viribus presume^tes
debiliores efficiuntur / Et narrat qualiter ille Capaneus miles m armis
probatissimus de sua presumens audacia inuocacionem ad superos tempore
necessitatis ex vecordia tamen et non a liter primitus prouenisse asseruit vnde
in obsidione Ciuitatis Thebarum cu^ ipse quodam die coram suis hostibus ad
debellan dum se obtulit ignis de celo subito superueniens Ipsum armatum
totaliter in Cineres conbussit

mY sone in all manner wise
Surquedrye is to despise
Whereof I find write thus
The proud knight Capaneus /
He was of such Surquedrye
That he thorugh his chyualrye
Upon him self so mochel trust
That to the gods him ne lust
In no quarelle to beseech
But said it was an ydel speech
Which cause was of pure dread
For lak of heart and for need
And upon such presumpcion
He held this proud oppynyon
Till at the last*vpon a day
About Thebes where he lay
When it of syege was beleyne
This knight as the Cromyque seyne
In all man's sight there
When he was proudest in his gere
And how nothing might him dear
Full armed with his sheld and spear
As he the Cite would assaylle
God took him self the bataylle
Ayene his pride and fro the sky
A fyry thonder suddenly
He send and to poudre him smote
And thus the pride which was hot
When he most in his strength wend
Was brent and lost withouten end
So that it proves well therefore
The strength of man is sone lore
But if that he it well govern
And over this a man may learn
That eke full oftyme it greueth
What that a man him self believes
As though it should him well beseme
That he al other men can deem
And has foryete his own vice
A tale of hem that be so nyce
And feynen hem self to be wise
I shall tell the in such a wise
Whereof thou shall ensample take
That thou no such thing undertake
hIc loquitur Confessor contra illos qui de sua scie^cia presumentes aliorum

I Find upon Surquedrye
How yt whilom of hu^garye
By old days was a king
Wise and honest in all thing
And so byfel upon a day
And that was m the month of May
As thylk time it was vsance
This king with noble purueannce
Has for him self his chaar arrayed
Wheryn he would ride amayed
Out of the Cite for to play
With lords and great arraye
Of lusty folk that were young
Where sum pleyd and sum song
And sum gone and some ride
And sum pryke her horse a side
And brydlen hem now in now out
The king his eye cast about
Till he at last was ware
And saw comend again his chare
Two pylgryms of so great age
That lyche unto a dry image
That weren pale and fade hewed
And as a busshe which is besnewed
Here berdes be hoore and white
There was of kind but a lyte
That they ne semen fully deed
They come to the king and bid
Sum of his good pur charity
And with great humylyte
Out of his chare to ground he lepe
And hem m both his arms keep
And kyst hem both foot and hand
Before the lords of his land
And yaf hem of his good thereto
And when he has this deed do
He goth in to his chare again
Tho was murmour tho was dysdeyne
Tho was compleynt on every side
They sayden of her own pride
Echone to other what is this
Our king has do this thing amys
So to abesse his Royalte
That every man it might se
And humbled him in such a wise
To hem that were of none empryse
Thus was it spoken to and fro
Of hem that were with him tho
Al pryuely behind his bak
But to him self noman spak
The kings brother in presence
Was thylk time and great offense
He took thereof and was the same
Abouen al other which most to blame
Upon his lyege lord has leyd
And has unto the lords said
Anon as he can time find
There shall nothing be left behind
That he wol speak unto the king
Now what fell upon this thing
They were merry and fair ynongh
Echone with other played and lough
And fellen in to tales new
How that the fresshe flowers grew
And how the grene leaves spronge
And how that love among the young
Bygan the hertes than to wake
And every byrd has chose his make
And thus the may day to the end
They lad and home aye ne they wend
The king was not so sone come
That when he had his chamber nome
His brother ne was ready there
And brought a tale unto his ere
Of that he had such a shame
In hyndeyng of his own name
When he him self would dretche
That to so vile a pouer wretch
Him deyneth show such symplesse
Against the state of his noblesse
And says he shall no more use
And that he mote him self excuse
Toward his lords euerychone
The king stood stylle as onystone
And to his tale an ere he leyde
And thought more than he seyde
But netheles to that he herd
Well curtoysly he ansuerde
And told it should be amended
And thus when yt here tale was ended
Al ready was the board and cloth
The king unto his souper goth
Among the lords to the halle
And when they had souped all
They when leave and forth they go
The king bythought him seluen tho
Hou he his brother may chastye
That he thought his surquedrye
Took upon hond to dispreyse
Humylyte which is to preyse
And thereupon yaf such counseylle
Toward his king that was vnheyle
Whereof to be the better lered
Him thinks to make him afered
It fell so that in thylke dawe
There was ordained by the law
A Trompe with a stern breath
Which was cleped the Trompe of death
And in the Court where ye king was
A certain man a Trompe of bras
Has in keeping and thereof serves
That when a lord his death deserves
He shall this dredefull Trompe blow
To fore his gate and make it know
How that the jugement is give
Of death which shall not be foryeue
The king when it was night anon
This man assent and bad him gone
To trompen at his broders gate
And he which mote done algate
Goth forth and does the kings heste
This lord which herd this tempeste
That he to fore his gate blewe
Tho wist he by the law and knew
That he was sekerlyche deed
And as of help he wist no read
But send for his friends all
And told hem how it is byfalle
And they him axe cause why
But he the soth not for thy
Ne wist and there was sow we tho
For it stood thylk time so
This Trompe was of such sentence
That there ayene no resystence
They could ordeyne by no weye
That he ne mote algate deye
But if so be he may purchase
To get his lyege lords grace
Here wits thereupon cast
And len appointed at last
This lord a worthy lady had
Unto his wife which also drad
Her lords death and children five
Between hem two they had on line
That weren young and tender of age
And of stature and of vysage
Right fair and lusty to see
Tho casten they that he and she
Forth with her children on the morrow
As they that were full of sorrow
Al naked but of smok and shyrte
To tender with the kings heart
His grace should go to seche
And pardon of death biseche
Thus passen they that woeful night
And erly when it was light
They gone hem forth in such a wise
As thou to fore have herd deuyse
All naked but her shyrtes one
They wept and made mochel moan
Her here hanged about her eres
With sobbyng and with sorry terys
This lord goth then an humble pas
That whylome proud and noble was
Whereof the Cite sore a flight
Of hem that sawen that ylke sight
And netheles al openly
With such weeping and such cry
Forth with his children and his wife
He goth to pray for his life
Unto the court when thry be come
And men therein has hyed nome
There was no wight if he hem syghe
From water might keep his eye
For sow we they maden tho
The king supposyth of this woe
And feyneth as he naught ne wist
But netheles at his vpryst
Men told him how it ferde
And when that he this wonder herd
In have he goth in to the halle
And al attones down they fall
If any pity may be found
The king which seth hem fell to ground
Has axed hem what is the fere
Why be ye so dispoylled there
His brother said A lord mercy
I wot none other cause why
But only that this night full late
The Trompe of death was at my gate
In tokene that I should dye
Thus we be come for to preye
That ye my worlds death respyte
Ha fool thou thou art for to wit
The king unto his brother seyde
That thou art of so little freyd
That only for a Trompes soune
Has gone dispoilled thorugh ye town
Thou and thy wife in such manner
Forth with thy children that been here
In sight of all men about
For that thou say thou art in doubt
Of death which stant under the law
Of man and man may it withdraw
So that it may per chance faylle
Now shall thou not for thy meruaylle
That I down from my chare alyght
When I beheld to fore my sight
In hem that were of so great age
Mine own death thorugh her image
Which god has set by law of kind
Whereof I may no bote find
For well I wot such as they be
Right such am I in my degree
Of flesh and blood and so shall deye
And thus though I that law obey
Of which that kings be put under
It ought be well the less wonder
Then thou which art without need
For law of land in such a dread
Which for to account is but a iape
As thing which thou myt ouerscape
For thy my brother after this
I read that sethyn that so is
That thou can dread a man so sore
Dread god with all thine heart more
For all shall dye and al shall pass
As well a lion as an ass
As well a beggar as a lord
Toward death in one acord
That shall stand and in this wise
The king with his words wise,
His brother taught and al foryeue
Confessor
For thy my sone if thou live
In virtue thou must vice eschew
And with low heart hu^blesse sewe
So that thou be not Surquedous
Amans
My fadre I am amerous
Whereof I would you beseech
That ye me ensample teache
Which myt in loves cause stand
Confessor
My seen thou shall understand
In love and other things all
If that Surquedrye fall
It may to him not well be tide
Which uses thylk vice and pride
Which torneth wisdom to wenyng
And sothfastnesse in to lesyng
Though foul ymagynacyon
And for thyn enformacyon
That thou three vice as I the read
Esche we shall a tale I read
Which fell whilome by days old
So that the clerk Ouyde told
hIc in specyaali tractat Confessor a^ in Amante contra illos qui de propri a
formositate presume^te amorem Mu hens dedignantur / Et narrat Exemplum qualiter
cuiusdam principis filius Nomine Narcizus estiuo tempore cum ipse venacionis

incurrens necessitate co^pulsus ad bibendum de quodam font pro mis inc^nauit.

^ He: was whilom a lords son
Which of his pride a vice wo^ne /
Has caught yt worthy to his lyche
To sechen al ye worlds rich
(...) was no woman for to love
So ^^ghe he set him self above
Of stature and of beauty both
That him thought al women loathe
So was there no comparyson
As toward his condycyon
This young lord Marcizus hight
No strength of love to we might
His heart which is vnafyled
But at the last he was begyled
For the gods purueaunce
It fell him a day per chance
That he in all his proud fare
Unto the forest began to fare
Among other that there were
To hunte and disporte him there
And when he came in to the place
Where that he would make his chase
The hou^des were within a throw
Uncoupled and the horns blow
The great heart anon was found
With swyfte feet set on ground
And he with spore in horse side
Him hastes fast for to ride
Till al men be left behind
And as he wod under a lynde
Beside a roche as I the tell
He saw where sprung a lusty well
The day was wonder hot with all
And such a thurst was on him fall
That he must other dye or drink
And down he lies and by the brynke
And tide his horse unto a branch
And leyd him low for to staunche
His thurst and as he cast his look
And to the well and heed took
He saw the like of his vysage
And wend there were an image
Of such a nymphe as tho was say
Whereof his love his heart assay
Bygan as it after was seen
Of his stoye and made him wene
It were a woman that he syghe
The more that he the well came nyghe
The ner came she him again
So wist he never what to seyne
For when he wept he saw her weep
And when he cried he took good keep
The same word she cried also
And thus bygan the new woe
That whilome was to him so strange
Tho made him love and heart eschaunge
To set his heart and to begin
Thing which he might never win
And ever among he began to loute
And praith that she to him come out
And other while he goth a far
And other while he draws nerre
And ever he fond her in a place
He wepeth he cries he axeth grace
There as he might get none
So that ayene a roche of stone
As he that knew none other read
He smote him self till he was deed
Whereof the Nymphs of the wells
And other that there weren else
Unto the wodes bylongend
The body which was deed lyggend
For pure pity that they have
Under grave they be grave
And than out of his sepulture
There sprung anon parauenture
Of flowers such a wonder sight
That men ensample take might
Upon the deeds which he deed
And tho was seen in other stead
For in the winter fressh and fair
The flowers ben which is contrayre
To kind and so was the folly
Which fell of his surquedrye
Thus he which love had in disdeyn
Werst of al other was byseyn
And as he set his price most high
He was lest worthy in loves eye
And most beiaped in his wit
Whereof the remembrance is yet
So that thou might ensample take
And eke al other for his sake
Amans
My fadre as touchend of me
This vice I think for to flee
Which of his wenynge ever tro weth
And namlich of thing which grows
In loves cause or well or woe
Yet pryded in me never so
But would that grace send
That toward me my lady wend
As toward her I wene
My love should so bysene
There should go no pride a place
But I am fer fro thylk grace
As for to speak of time now
So mote I suffer and pray you
That ye wo^ axe on other side
If there be any point of pride
Whereof it needs me to be shryue
Confessor
My sone God it the foryeue
If thou have thing mysdoo
Touchend of this for euermo
There is another yet of pride
Which could never his words hyde
That he ne would him self auaunt
There may nothing his tongue dau^t
That he ne clappeth as a belle
Whereof if thou wolt that I tell
It is behouely for to here
So that thou might thy tongue stere
Toward the world and stand in grace
Which lakketh often in many a place
To him that can not sytte stylle
Which else should have his will
Magniloque propria^ minuit iactancia lingue / Fama^ quam stabilem firmat

tHe Vice cleped auauntau^ce
With pride has take his acque intau^ce /
So that his own price he las seth /
When he such mesure ouerpasseth
That he his own herald is
That first was well is than amys
That was tha^k worthy is than blame
And thus the worship of his name
Thorugh pride of his auauntrye
He wineth in to vylonye
I vede how that this pronde vice
Has thylk wind in his office
Thorugh which ye blastys yt he b^o weth
The man's name he ouerthro weth
Of virtue which should else spring
Unto the worlds knoulechynge
But he fordeth it al to sore
And right of such manner lore
There ben lovers for thy if thou
Art one of hem trlle and say hou
When thou have take any thing
Of loves right or ouche or ryng
Or take upon the for the cold
So^me goodly word as the was told
Or friendly chere or tokene or letter
Whereof thyn heart was the better
Of that she sent the gretyng
Have thou for pride of thy lykyng
Made thyn auannt where the list
I Would fadre that ye wist
My Conseyence lies not here
Yet had I never such matere
Whereof might mine heart amend
Not of so much as she send
By mouth and said great him well
And thus for that there is no delo
Whereof to make mine auaunt
It is to reason accordaunt
That may never but I lie
Of love make auauntrye
I wot not what I should have do
If that I had encheson so
As ye have said here many one
But I fond cause never none
But danger which me welny slough
Thereof I couthe tell enough
And none other auantaunce
Thus needs me no repentance
Now axe fadre forther of my life
For thewf am I not gyltyf
Confessor
My sone I am well paid with all
For wyto well in specyal
That love of his vevay Justice
A louen al other ayene this vice
At al times most debateth
With all his heart and most he hates
And eke in all manner wise
Auauntrye is most to despise
By ensample thou might wit
Which I find in the books write
hIc ponit Confessor Exemplum contra illos qui de sua in armis probitate vel de
suo in amous causa de siderio completo se iactant / Et narrat qualiter Albinus
primus Rex Longo bardorum cum ipse quendam alium rege in nomine Gurmundu^ in
bello morientem triumphasset testam capitio de functi au ferens aphum ex ea
gemmis and ouw circumligatum in sue victory memoriam fabricari constituit /
insuper and Ipsius Gurmundi filiam Rosemu^dam vapiens maritali thoro in

vindicauit

oF hem that we lu^bardes call
Albinus was the first of all
Which bare croun of lu^bardie
And was of great chyualrye
An werre against diverse kings
So fell among other things
That he that time a werre had
With Gurmu^d which ^ Geptees lad
And was a mighty king also
But netheles it fell him so
Albinus slough him in the field
There halpe him notherspere ne shield
That he ne smote his heed of than
Whereof he took awey the pan
Of which he said he would make
A cup for Gurmundes sake
To keep and draw in to memory
Of his bataylle the vyctorye
And when he thus the feld had wo^ne
The land anon was over run
And sesed in his own hand
There he gurmundes daughter found
Which maid Rosamund hight
And was in every man's sight
A fair fressh a lusty one
His heart fylle to her anon
And such a love on her he cast
That he her wedded at the last
And after that time long in rest
With her he dwelte and to the best
They love each other wondre well
But she which keeps ye blind wheel
Venue when they be most about
An all the hottest of her love
Her whele she torneth and they fell
An the manner as I shall tell
This king which stood in all his wealth
Of pees of worship and of health
And felt him on no side grieved
As he that has his world acheued
Tho thought he a fest he would make
And that for his wives sake
That she the lords at the feste
That were obeysaunt to his heste
May know and so thereupon
He let ordeyne and sent anon
By lettres and by messagyers
And warned al his officers
That every thing be well arrayed
The great stedes were assayed
For Iustyng and for tornement
And many a perled garnement
Embrouded was again the day
The lords in here best array
Be comen at time set
One Iusteth well another bet
And other while they torney
And thus they cast care awey
And took lusts upon hand
And after thou shall understand
To mete in to the kings halle
They comen as they he beden all
And when they were set and served
Than after as it was deserved
To hem that worthy knyghees were
So as they seten here and there
The price was spoke and you out
Among the herawdes al about
And thus bynethe and eke above
Al was of arms and of love
Whereof about at boordes
Men had many sundry words
That of the myrthe which they made
The king him self bygan to glade
Within his heart and took a pride
And saw the cup stand a side
Which made was of Gurmu^des head
As ye have herd when he was deed
And was with gold and rich stones
Beset and bound for the nones
And stood upon a foot on hyghte
Of borned gold and with great sleyghte
Of werkemanshyp it was bygraue
Of such work as it should have
And polysshed was eke so clean
That no sign of the sculle was seen
But as it were a grypes eye
The king bad bear his cup aweye
Which stood before him on the board
And fette thylk upon his word
The sculle is fet and wyn therein
Whereof he bad his wife hegynne
Drink with thy fadre dame he seyde
And she to his byddyng obeyde
And took the sculle and what her list
She drynketh as she nothing wist
What cup it was and than al out
The king in audyence about
Has told it was her fadres sculle
So that the lords know shulle
Of his vataylle a soth witness
And made auau^t thorugh what prowess
He has his wives love won
Which of the sculle has so bygonne
Tho was there pride mochel alofte
They speken as and she was soft
Thynkend thylk unkind pride
Of that her lord so nygh her side
Auaunath him that he has slain
And pyked out her fadres brayn
And of the sculle has made a cup
She suffered till they be up
And tho she has sickness feyned
And goth to chamber and has co^pleyned
Unto a maid which she trust
So that none other wight it wist
This maid Glodesyde is hot
To whom this lady has byhote
Of sadyshyp all that she can
^o avenge her upon this man
Which did her drink in such a plit
Among hem al for despyte
Of her and of her fadre both
Whereof her thoughts ben so wroth
(...) said that she shall not be glad
(...) that she him so has bestad
that be no more make auaunt
And thus they fell in covenant
that they acorden at the last
With such wyles as they cast
That they wol get of her acord
Some orped knight to slay this lord
And with this sleyghte they begin
How they helmege might win
Which was the kings botyler
A proud and a lusty bachiler
And Glodesyde he loves hot
And she to make him more assote
Here love granted and by night
They shape how they to gedre might
A bed mete and done it was
The same night and in this was
The queen her self the night second
Went in her stead and there she fond
A chamber derke without light
And goth to bed to this knight
And he to keep his obseruaunce
To love does his obeysaunce
And weneth it be Glodesyde
And she than after lay a side
And him axeth what he has do
And who she was she told him tho
And said I am thy queen
Now shall thy love well beseen
Of that thou have thy will wrought
Or it shall sore ben abought
Or thou shall worche as I the say
And if thou wolt by such a way
Do my plesaunce and hold it stylle
For ever I shall ben / at thy will
Both I and al mine heritage
Anon the wyld love rage
An which noman him can govern
Has made him that he can not werne
But fell al hool to here assent
And thus the whele is al myswent
The which fortune has upon hand
For how that ever it after stand
They shope among hem / such a wyle
The king was deed within a while
So slyly come it not about
That they ne ben discovered out
So that it thought hem for the best
To flee for there was no rest
And thus the tresour of the king
Tsxy trusse and much other thing
And with a certain felauship
They fled and went awey by ship
And hel^^ her course from then
Till that they come to Rauenne
Where they the dukes help sought
And he so as they him besought
A place grants for to duelle
But after when he herd tell
Of / the manner how they have do
The duk let shape for hem so
That of a poison which they drunk
They hadden that they have beswu^ke
And all this made auauut of pride
Good is therefore a man to hyde
His own price. for if he speak
He may lyghtelyche his thank break
An arms lies none advantage
To him which thinks his name
auaunce / And be renomed of his deed
And also who that thinks to speed
Of love he may not him auaunte
For what man thylk vpce haunte
His purpoos shall often faylle
In arms he that wol trauaylle
Or else loves grace attryne
His love tongue he mote restreyne
Which beryth of his honor the keye
For thy my sone in all weye
Take right good head of this matere
I thank you my fadre dear
This scole is of a gentyl lore
And if there be ought else more
Of pride which I shall esche we
Now axe forth and I wol show
What thing that ye me wol inform
Confessor
My sone yet in other form
There is a vyor of prydes lore
Which lyche an hawke and he will sore
Flees upon high in his delyces
After the lykyng of his vices
And wol nomans reason know
Till he down fall and ouerthro we
This vice veynglorye is hot
Whereof my sone I the byhote
To trete and speak in such a wise
That thou the might the better auyse
gLoria perpetuos pregnat munda na dolores / Qui tamen est vanus gaudia vana
cupit / Eius amiciciam quem gloria tollit inanis. Non sine bla^ dichis planus
habehit homo / Merbis compositis qui sit stagulare fauellum Scandere sellata
iura valebit eques Sic in amore magis qui blanda subor not in ore / Merba per
hoc bra^^um quoth nequit alter halebit / Et tamen ornato^ cantus varios que
paratus / Let a que corda suis legibus optat amor

hIc loquitur de quinta specie superbie que Inanis gloria vocatur Et eiusdem
vicij naturam primo delscubens super eodem in a moris causa Confessor amanti
consequenter opponit

tHe proud vice of veinglorye
Reme^breth not of purgatory
His worlds joys be so great
Him thinks of heaven no beyete
This lives pomp is al his pes
Yet shall he deye netheles
And thereof thinks he but a lyte
For all his lust is to delight
An new things proud and vein
As ferforth as he may atteyne
I trow if that he might make
His body new he would take
A new form and leave his old
For what thing that he may behold
The which the common use is strange
Anon his old guyse change
He wol and fall thereupon
Lyche unto the Camelyon
Which upon every sundry hew
That he behold he mote new
His color and thus unadvised
Fuloftyme he stant desguysed
More ioylyf than the vytd in May
He makes him ever fessehe and gay
And does al his array desguyse
So that of him the new guyse
Of lusty folk al other take
And eke he can carolles make
Roundel balade and verelay
And with all this if that he may
Of ^^ue ge^e him advantage
A none he waxt of his courage
So over glad that of his end
He thinks there is no death comend
For he has than at al tide
Of love such manner pride
Him thinks his Joy is endeles
Confessor
Now shryue the sone in good pees
And of thy love tell me pleyn
If that thy glory has so be veyn
Amans
My fadre as touchend of al
I may not well ne not shall
Of vein glory excuse me
That I ne have for love be
The better dressyd and arayd
And also I have often assayd
Roundel balades and vyrelay
For hy: love on whom mine heart lay
Tho to make also and for to peynte
^^rollys with my words queynte
To set my purpoos alofte
And ^yus I long hem forth often
In balle ^ eke in Chamber about
And made merry among the ^oute
But yet ne ferd I not the bet
^^^e was my glo: ye in veyn set
I^ all the ^oye that I made
For when I would with her glade
And of ^er love songs make
^^ said it was not for her sake
And ^^^e not my songs here
N^ wyten what the words were
So fo: to speak of mine arraye
Yet could I never be so gay^
^e so well make a song of love
whereof I might ben above
And have encheson to be glad
But rather I am often adrad
For sorrow that she says me nay
And netheles I wol not say
That I am glad on other side
For ^ame that can nothing hyde
Al day wol bring unto mine ere
Of that men speken here and there
How that my lady beryth the pry^^
How she is fair how she is wise
How she is womanlyche of chere
Of all this thing that I may here
What wonder is thaugh I be feyn
And eke when I may here seyn
Tidings of my lady hele
Al though I may not with her dele
Yet am I wonder glad of that
For when I wot of her good estat
As for that time I dar well swear
None other sorrow may me dear
Thus am I gladed in this wise
But fadre of your lores wise
Of whicho ye be fully taught
Now tell me if ye think ought
That I thewf am to wit
Of that there is I the acquyte
My sone he said and for thy good
I wol that thou understood
For I think upon this matere
To tell a tale as thou shall here
How that again this proud vyde
The high / god of / his Justice
Is wroth and great vengeance does
Now harken a tale that is soth
Though it be naught of loves kind
A great ensample thou shall find
This vein glory for to flee
Which is so full of vanyte
hVmani generis cum sit sibi gloria mayor. Sepe sub esse solet poox imis ille
dolor / Men's elata graves descensus sepe subibit / Men's humilis stabile molle
que firmat iter / Motibus Innumeris volutat fortuna per orbem / Cum magis alta
petit inferiora time /

h Ic ponit Confessor Exemplum contra vicium inanis glory norrans qualiter Rex
Nabugodonosor rex Caldeorum cum ^pse in omni magesta it is sue gloria celsior
extitisset deus eius superbiam castigare ^olens ipsum extra formam hominis in
^estiam fenu^ commedentis transmutauit / Et sic perseptennium penitens cum ipse
potenaorem se agnouit, misertus dens ipsum in sui Regni so^^um restituta
sanitate emendatum graciosius collocauit

There was a king yt much mit
Which Nabugdonosor hight
Of whom yt I spak here to fore
Yet in the bible this name is bore
For all the World in thoryent
Was hoole at his commandment
Than of kings to his lyche
Was none so mighty ne so rich
To his empire and to his laws
As who says in thylke dawes
Were obeysaunt and trybute bear
As though he god of earth were
With strength he put kings under
And wrought of pride many a wonder
He was so full of vain glory
That he ne had no memory
That there was any god but he
For pride of his pro^peryte
Till that the high king of kings
Which sees and knows al things
Whose eye may nothing asterte
The pryuyt^es of man's heart
To speak and sown in his ere
As though they ^oude wyndes were
He took vengeance of his pride
But for he would a while abide
To look if he would him amend
To him before token he send
And that was in his sleep by night
This proud king a wonder ^yght
Had (...) his sweuen^ there he lay
Him thought upon a merry day
As he byhelde the world abou^^
A tree grow he saw there out^
Which in the world amyddes even
Whose heyght straut vy to the heaven
The leaves were fair and large
The fouyt it ^ere so ripe a c^arge
That al men it might feed
He saw also the bows sprede
Above al earth in which were
The kind of al birds there
And eke he thought he saw also
The kind of al bestes go
Under the tree about round
And fedden hem upon the ground
As he this wonder stond and syghe
He thought he herd a wys on high
Cryend and said above all
Hew down this tree and let it fall
The leaves let defou^e in have
And does feuyt destroy and wast
And let of shreden every branch
But at rote he beat it staunche
When al his pride is cast to ground
The rote shall be fast bound
And shall no man's heart bear
But every lust shall he forbere
Of man and lyche an Ox his m^te
Of gras he shall purchase and ete
Till that the water of heaven
Have wasshen him by times seven
So that he thorugh know aryght
What is the heuenlyche might
And be made humble to the will
Of him which may al save and spylle
This king out of his sweuene abrayd
And he upon the mow we it said
Unto the clerks which he had
But none of hem the soth arad
Was none his sweuen couth undo
And it stood thylk time so
This king had in subiectyon
Iudee and of affectyon
A bouen al other one Danyel
He loves for he couthe well
Dyuyne that none other couthe
To him were al things couthe
As he it had of gods grace
He was before the kings face
And sent and ^oden that he should
Upon the point the king of told
The fortune of his sweuene expound
As it should afterward be found
When Danyel this sweuene herd
He stood long time or he ansuerde
And made a wondre beuy chere
The king took head of his manner
And bad him tell that he wist
As he to whom he mochel ^^yse
And said be would not be wroth
But Danyel was wonder loath
And said upon the so men all
Sire king thy sweuene might fall
And nethelce touchend of this
I wol the tellen how it is
And what dysese is to the shape
God wot it if thou shall escape
The high tree which thou have seen
Which leaves and f^uyt so well besene
The which stood in ye world amyddes
So that the beestes and the birds
Governed were of him alone
Sir king bytokeneth thy person
Which sto^te above al erthely things
Thus regnen under the the kings
And all the people unto the lovoteth
And all the world thy person douteth
So that with vein honor deceived
Thou have the reverence weyued
Fro him which is thy king above
Thou have yt thou for dread ne love
Wolt nothing kno we of this god
Which now for you has made a rod
Thy vein glory and thy folly
With great peynes to chastye
And of the voys thou herdest speak
Which bad the bows for to break
And bewe and fell down the tr^
That word by^ongeth unto the
Thy Regne shall be ouerthro we
And thou dyspoylled for athro we
But that the rote shall stand,
Thou shall well understand
There shall abide of thy regne
A time again where thou shall regne
And eke of that thou herdest say^
To take a man's heart away^
And set there a bestyal
So that like an ox shall
Pasture and that he be reyned
By times seven and sore peyned
Till that he kno we his gods mytes
Than shall he stand again vprightes
All this bytokeneth thine estate
Which now with god is in debate
Thy man's form shall be lassed
Till seven year be over passed
And in the lykenes of a best
Of gras shall be thy Royal ^^ste
The wether shall upon the rain
And understand that all this pain
Which thou shall suffer thylk tide
Is shape al only for thy pride
Of vein glory and of the ^ynne
Which thou have long stand ynne
So upon this condycyon*
Thy sweuene has exposicyon
But or this thing befalle in deed
Amend the this would I read
Give and depart thyn alms
Do mercy forth with ryghtwysenes
Beseech and pray the high grace
For so thou might thy pees purcha^^
With god and stonden in good acord
But pride is loath to lose his lord
And wol not suffer humylyte
With him to stand in no deg^e
And when a ship has lost his stere
Is none so wise that may him stere
Again the wawes in a rage
This proud king in his courage
Humylyte has so forlore
That for no sweuene he saw to fore
Ne yet for all that Danyel
Him has counseylled every del
He let it pass out of his mind
Thorugh vein glory and as the blind
He sees no weye or him be woe
And fell within a time so
As he in Babyloyne went
The vanyte of pride him hente
His heart aroos of vein glory
So that he drough in to memory
His lordship and his Regalye
With words of surquedrye
When that he him most auaunteth
That lord which glory daunteth
Al suddenly as who says treys
Where that he stood in his paleys
He took him from the men's sight
Was none of hem so war that might
Set eye where he bycome
And thus was he from his kingdom
In to the wyld for^st draw
Where that the mighty gods law
Thorugh his power did transform
Fro man in to a bestes form
And like an ox under the foot
He graseth as he needs mote
To geten his lives fode
Tho thought him cold gras good
That whilome ete the hot^ spyces
Thus was he turned from delyces
The wyn was wont to drink
He took then of the wells brynke
Or of the pyt or of the slough
It thought him then good enough
Instead of chambres well arrayed
He was than of a busshe well paid
The hard ground he lay upon
For other pylowes had he non
The storms and the raynes fall
The wyndes blow upon him all
He tormented day and night
Such was the high gods might
Till seven year an end took
Upon him self tho began he look
Instead of mete gr^s and treys
Instead of hands long cleys
Instead of man a best like
He saw and than he began to syke
For cloth of gold and of perrye
Which him was wont to magny^ye
When he byheld his cote of here is
He wept and with woeful teres
Up to the heaven he cast his chere
Wepend and thought in this manner
Though he no words may win
Thus said his heart and spak withynne
O mighty god that al have wrought
And al myt bring again to nout
Now know I but al of the
This world has no prosperyte
In thyn aspect ben al alyche
The pour man and eke the rich
Without the there may no wight
And thou above al other might
O mighty lord to ward my vice
Thy mercy meddle with Justice
And I wol make a covenant
That of my life the remenaunt
I shall it by the grace amend
And in thy law so dispende
That veyn glory I shall eschew
And bow unto thyn heste and sewe
Humylyte and that I vow
And so thenkend he began down bow
And though him lack boys and speehe
He began with his fete areche
And wenend in his beestly steuene
He made his pleynt unto the heuene
He kneleth in his wise and brayeth
To seche mercy and assayeth
His god which made him nothing
strange. When yt he saw his pride change
Anon as he was humble and tame
He fond toward his god the same
And in a twynkelyng of a look
His man's form again he took
And was reformed to the Reygne
In which that he was wont to reygne
So that the pride of veyn glory
Ever afterward out of memory
He let it pass and thus it showed
What is to ben of pride vnthe wed
Again the high gods law
To whom no man may be felawe
For thy my sone take good head
So for to lead thy manhede
That thou be not like a best
But if thy life shall be honest
Thou must humblesse take on hand
For than might thou syker stand
And for to speak in other wise
A proud man can not assise
For thou a woman would him please
His pride can not ben at ease
There may noman to mochel blame
A vice which is for to blame
For thy men shulden nothing hyde
That might fall in blame of pride
Which is the worst vice of all
Whereof so as it was byfalle
The tale I think of a Cronyque
To tell if it may the like
So that thou might humblesse sewe
And eke the vice of pride eschew
Whereof the glory is false and vein
Which god him self has in dysdeyne
That though it mount for athrowe
It shall fall down and overthrow

Aching was whilom yo^g and wise
The which of his wit set great price
Of deep ymagynacyo^s
And strange Interpretacions
Problemes and demau^des eke
His wysedom was to find and seek
Whereof he would in sundry wise
Opposen hem that were wise
But none of hem it might vere
Upon his word to give ansuere
Out taken one which was a knight
To him was every thing so light
That also sone as he hem herd
The kings words ansuerde
What thing the king axe would
There anon the truth he told
The king somdele had an envy
And thout he would his wits plye
To set some conclusyon
Which should be confusyon
Unto this knight so that the name
And of wisdom the high fame
To ward him self he would win
And thus of al his wit to win
The king bygan to study and muse
What strange matter be might use
The knights wits to confound
And at last he has it found
And for the knight anon he sent
That he shall tell what he meant
Upon the points of the matter
Of questions as thou shall here
The first point of al three
Was this What thing in all degree
Of all this World has need lest
And yet men help it alther mest
The second What most is worth
And of costage is lest put forth
The third is which is of most cost
And lest is worth and goth to lost
The king these three demau^des axeth
To the knight this law he taxes
That he shall gone and come again
The third weke and tell him pleyne
To every point what it amounts
And if so be that he myscounteth
To make in his ansuere a faylle
There shall none other thing faylle
The king says that he shall be deed
And lose his goods and his head
The knight was sorry of this thing
And would excuse him to the king
But he ne would him not forbere
And thus this knight of his ansuere
Goth home to take auyfement
But after his entendement
The more he cast his wit about
Thereof he stant the more in doubt
Tho wist he well the kings heart
That he the death ne should astert
And such a sow we has to him take
That gladship he has forsake
He thought first upon his life
And after that upon his wife
Upon his childee eke also
Of which he had daughters two
The youngest of hem had in age
Fourtene year and of vysage
She was right fair and of stature
Lyche to an heuenlyche figure
And of manner and of goodly speech
Though men would al lands seche
They should not have founden her like
She saw her fadre sorrow and syke
And wist not the cause why
So came she to him pryuely
And yt was where he made his moan
Within a gardyn al him one
Upon her knees she began down fall
With humble heart and to him call
And said O good fadre dear
Why make ye thus heavy chere
And I wot nothing how it is
And well ye know fadre this
What adventure that you fell
Ye might it saufly to me tell
For I have often herd you said
That ye such trust have on me laid
That to my suster ne to my brother
In all this world ne to none other
Ye durst have told a pryuete
So well my fadre as to me
For thy my fadre I you pray
Ne casts naught that heart away
For I am she that would keep
Your honor and with that weep
Her eye may not be forbore
She wyssheth for to ben vnbore
Er that her fadre so mystryst
To tellen her of that he wist
And ever among mercy she cryede
That he ne should his counseylle hyde
From her that so would him good
And was so nyghe flesh and blood
So that weeping at the last
His chere upon his child he cast
And sorowfully to that she prayde
He told his tale and thus he said
The sorrow daughter which I make
Is not al only for my sake
But for the both and for you all
For such a chance is me befalle
That I shall or this third day
Lose all that ever I lose may
My life and al my good thereto
Therefore it is I sorrow so
What is the cause alas quod she
My fadre that ye sholden be
Deed and destroyed in such a wise
And he bygan the points deuyse
Which as ye king told him by mouth
And said her pleynly that he couth
Ansuere to no point of this
And she that hereth how it is
Her counseyl yafe and said tho
My fadre syn it is so
That ye can none other weye
But that ye must needs deye
I would pray of you a thing
Late me go with you to the king
And ye shall make him understand
Hou ye my wits for to fond
Have leyd ansuere upon me
And tell him in such degree
Upon my word ye wol abide
Tho to live or deye what so betyde
For yet per chance I may purchase
With some good word ye kings grace
Your life and eke your good to save
For often shall a woman have
Thing which yt a man may not areche
The fadre herd the daughters speech
And thought there was reason ynne
And saw his own life to win
He reuthe done him self no cure
So better him thought in adventure
To put him and al his good
Than in the manner as it stood
His life in certain for to lose
And thus thynkend he bygan to chese
To do the counseyll of this maid
And eke the purpoos which she said
The day was come and forth they gone
Unto the Court they come anon
Where as the king in his Judgment
Was set and has this knight asent
Arrayed in the best wise
This maiden with her words wise
Her fadre led by the hand
In to the place where he fond
The king with other which he would
And to the king knelend he told
As he informed was to fore
And prayth the king that he therefore
His daughters words wol take
And says that he wol undertake
Upon her words for to stand
Tho was there great meritayl on hand
That he which was so wise a knyt
His life upon so young a wight
Be set would in Ieopardye
And many it held for folly
But at the last nevertheless
The king commanded to be in pees
And to this maid he cast his chere
And said he would her tale here
And bad her speak and she bygan
My lyege lord so as I can
Quod she the points which I herd
They shall of reason be ansuerde
The first I understand is this
What thing of all the world it is
Which men most help and lest need
My lyege lord this would I read
The earth it is which euermo
With mannys labor is vego
As well in winter as in may
The man's hand what he may
To help it forth and make it rich
And for thy men it delue and dyche
And eren it with strength of plough
Where it has of him self enough
So his need is at the lest
For every man byrd and best
And flour and gras and rote and rynde
And every thing by wey af kind
Shall sterue and earth it shall bycome
As it was out of the earth nome
It shall to earth torn again
And thus I may by reason seyne
That therthe is most nedeles
And most men help it netheles
So that my lord touchand of this
I have ansuerd how it is
That other point I understood
Which most is worth and most is good
And costeth a man lest to keep
My lord if ye wol take keep
I say it is Humylyte
Thorugh which the high Trynyte
As for deserte of true love
Unto Mary from above
Of that he knew her humble intent
His own sone a down he sent
Above al other / and her he chese
For that virtue which that bedeth pees
So that I may by reason call
Humylyte is most worthyest of all
And lest it costeth to mayntene
In all the word as it is seen
For who that has humblesse un hende
He brings no wer^e in to land
For he desires for the best
To set every man in rest
Thus with your high reverence
Me thinks, that this euydence
As to this point is suffysaunt
And touchend of the remenaunt
Which is the third of your askynges
What lest is worth of al things
And ^osteth most I tell it pride
Which may not in the heuene abide
For Luafer with him it fell
Bar Pride with him in to hell
There was pride of to great a cost
When he for pride has heaven lost
And after that in Paradyse
Adam for pride he lost his price
In myddel earth and eke also
Pride is the cause of al We
That all the world it may suffyse
So stant of pride the repryse
Pride is the heed of al sin
Which wastes all and may not win
Pride is of every mys the pryk
Pride is the worst of al wyck
And costeth most and lest is worth
In place where he has his forth
Thus have I said that I wol sey
Of mine ansuere and to you prey
Mine lyege lord of your office
That ye shall grace and such Justice
Ordeyne for my fadre here
That after this men it here
The world thereof may say good
The king / which reason understood
And has al herd which she has said
Was inly glad and so well paid
That al his wrath is over go
And he bygan to look tho
Upon this maid in the face
In which he found so mochel grace
That al his price on her he ^eyde
In audyence and thus he seyde
My fair maid well ye be
Of thine ansuere and eke of the
Me lyketh and as thou wylt
Foryeue be thy fadre gylt
And if thou were of such lygnage
That thou to me were of parage
And that thy fadre were a pere
As he is now a bachylere
Thou sholdest then be my wife
So syker as I have life
But this I say netheles
That I wol shape thyn encrees
What worlds good that thou wolt
baue / Axe of my yeft and you shall have
And she the kings words wise
Knelyng thanked in this wise
My lyege lord god mote you quyte
My fader here has but a lyte
Of waryson and that he wend
Had al be lost but now amend
Ye may well thorugh your noble grace
With yt the king right in his place
A none forth in the fressh hete
An Erldom which than was eschete
Was late fall in to his hand
Unto the knight with rent and land
Has you and with his chartre sesed
And thus was all the noise appesed
This maid which sat upon her knees
Before the kings charytees
Comen death and says evermore
My lyege lord right now to fore
Ye said as it is of record
That if my fadre were a lord
And pere unto these other great
Ye wolden not else let
That I ne should be your wife
And thus wot enery worthy life
A kings word mote be holden
For thy my lord if that ye wolden
So great a charity fulfylle
God wot it were well my will
For he which was a bachilere
My fadre is now made a pere
So when as ever that I came
An earls daughter now I am
This young king which plesyd all
Her beauty and her wit with all
As he that wae with love hente
A none thereto yaf his assente
He might not the maid asterte
That she nys lady of his heart
So that he took her to his wife
To hold while that he has life
And thus ye king toward this knyt
Acordeth to him as it is right
And over this good is to wit
In the Cronyes as it is write
This noble king of whom I told
Of Spain by tho days old
The kingdom had in governance
And as the book makes remembrance
Alphons was his propre name
The knight also if I shall name
Dom Petro hight / and as men tell
His daughter wise Petronelle
Was cleped which was full of grace
And that was seen in thylk place
Where she her fadre out of tene
Has breut and made her self a queen
Of that she has so well disclosed
The points whereof she was opposed
Confessor
Lo now my sone as thou might here
Of all this thing to my matere
But one I take and that is pride
To whom no grace may betyde
In heuene he fell out of his stead
And paradys him was forbede
The good men in earth him hate
So that to hell he mote algate
Where every virtue shall be weyued
And every vice be received
But Humblesse is al other wise
Which most is worthy and no repryse
It takes again both soft and fair
If any thing stant in contrayre
With humble speech it is redressed
Thus was this young maid blessed
The which I spak of now to fore
Her fadre life she gat therefore
And wanne with all the kings love
For thy my sone if thou wolt love
It sytt the well to love pride
And take Humblesse on thy side
The more of grace thou shall get
Amans
My fadre I wol not foryete
Of this yt ye have told me here
And if that any such manner
Of humble port may love appaye
Here afterward I thenke assaye
But now over I beseech
That ye more of my shryfte seche
Confessor
My good sone it shall be do
Now herkne and lay an ere to
For as tonchand of pride fair
Als ferforth as I can declare
In cause of vice in cause of love
That thou have pleyne herd above
So that there is no more to seye
Touchend of that but other weye
Touchend envy I thynk to tell
Which has by propre kind of hell
Without cause to mysdo
Toward him self and other mo
Here afterward as I understand
Thou shall the spyces as they stand
Explicit liber primus
Liter secundus
hOw after pride the second
There is which many a woe full stou^d
To wards other beryth a^boute
Within him self and not without
For in his thought he brenneth ever
When that he wot another lever
Or more virtuous than he
Which passes him in his degree
Whereof he takes his maladye
That vice is cleped hoote envy
For thy my sone if it be so
That ye art or have ben one of tho
As for to speak in loves cas
If ever yet thyn heart was
Seek of other men's hele
So god auannce my quarele
My fadre ye a thousand sithe
When I have seen another blythe
Of love and a goodly chere
Ethna which brenneth year byyere
Was than not so hoote as I
Of thylk for which pryuely
Mine hertes thought within brenneth
The ship which on the wawe renneth
And is forstormed and for blow
Is not more payned for athrowe
Than I am than when I se
Another which that passes me
In that fortune of loves yefte
But fadre this I tell in shryfte
That now here but in a place
For who that seche and find grace
In other stead it may naught grieve
But this ye may right well believe
Toward my lady that I serve
Though that I wist for to sterue
Mine heart is full of such folly
That I my self may not chastye
When I the court see of Cupyde
Approach unto my lady side
Of hem that lusty ben and fresshe
Though it avail hem not a resshe
But only that they ben of speech
My sorrow is than not to seche
But when they rownen in her ere
Then grows al my most fere
And namely when they talen long
My sorrows be than so strong
Of that I se hem well at ease
I can not tell my disease
But sire as of my lady selue
Though she have wowers x or twelve
For no mystrust I have of hire
Me greueth nonght for certes sire
I trow in all this world to seche
Nys woman that in deed and speech
Wol better auyse her what she does
Ne better for to sey a soth
Keep her honor at al tide
And yet get her a thank beside
But netheles I am be know
That when I see any throw
Or else if it I may here
That she make any man good chere
Though I thereof have not to done
My thought wol entermete sone
For though I be my self strange
Envy makes mine heart change
That I am sorowfully be stad
Of that I se another glad
With her but of other all
Of love what so may byfalle
Or that he fail or that he speed
Thereof take I but little head
Now have I said my fader all
And of this point in specyal
As ferforthly as I have wist
Now axe fadre what you list
Confessor
My sone or I axe any more
I think somdele for thy lore
Tell an example of this matter
Touchend envy as thou shall here
Though it be not the hounds kind
Write in Cyuyle this I find
To ete chaf yet wol I werne
An ox which comes to the herne
Thereof to take any fode
And thus who that it understood
It stant of love many a place
Who that is out of loves grace
He would another should faylle
And may him self not auaylle
And if he may put any lettr
He death all that he may to let
Whereof I find as thou shall wit
To this purpoos a tale write
hIc ponit Confessor Exemplum contra istos saltem qui in amoris causa aliorum
gaudijs inuidentes ne^uaquam per hoc sibi ipsis proficiunt / Et narrat qualiter
Mundus Miles noi^e Acis quem Galathea Numpha pulcherrima toto cord peramauit
cum ipsi sub quadam rupe Iuxta litus maris colloquium ad inuicem habuerunt /
Polophemus gigas concussa rupe mag nam inde partem super caput Acis ab alto
percipiens Ipsum per inuidiam in terfecit / Et cum ipse super hoc dictam
Galatheam rapere voluisset Neptunus gigantem obsistens Ipsam inuolutum salua
custodia preseruauit / Sed et dij miserti corpus Acis defuncti in fonte^ aque
dulcissime subito transmutarant

There ben of such mo than xij
That be not able of hem selue
To get love and for envy
Upon al other they aspye
And for hem lacks that they would
They keep that none other should
Touchend of love his cause speed
Whereof a great ensample I read
Which unto this matter acordeth
As Ouyde in his book records
How Polyphemus whilome wrout
When that he Galathe bysought
Of love which he may not latche
That made him for to wait and watch
By all weyes how it ferde
Till at the last he knew and herd
How that another had leave
To love there as he mote leave
As for to speak of any speed
So that he knew none other read
But for to wayten upon all
Till he may see the chance fall
That he her might grieve
Which by him self may not acheue
This Galathe seyth the poet
Above al other was unmeet
Of beauty that men than knew
And had a lusty love and true
A bachyleer in his degree
Right such another as was he
On whom she has her heart set
So that it might naught be let
For yefte ne for no byhest
That she ne was al at his hest
This young knight Acis was hot
Which her ageynward also hot
Al only loves and no mo
Hereof was polyphemus woe
Thorugh pure envy and ever aspyede
And wayteth upon every side
When he to geder might se
This young Acis with / galathe
So long he wayteth to and fro
Till at the last he found hem two
In pryue place where they stood
To speak and have here words good
The place where as he hem syghe
It was under a bank nyghe
The great see and he above
Stood and byhelde the lusty love
Which each of hem to other made
With goodly there and words glade
That al his heart has set a fire
Of pure envy and as a fire
Which flies out of a mighty bow
Awey he fled for a throw
As he that was for love wood
When that he saw how it stood
This Polypheme a geaunt was
And when he saw the soth cas
How Galathe him has forsaken
And Acis to here love taken
His heart may it not forbere
That he ne roreth as a bear
And as it were a wild best
In whom no reason might areste
He ran Ethna the hell about
Where never yet the fire was out
Fulfilled of sorrow and great disease
That he saw Acis well at ease
Till at the last he him bythought
As he which al envy sought
And torneth to the bank again
Where he with Galathe has seyne
Acis whom he thought to grieve
Though he him self may not releue
This Geaunt with his rude might
Part of the bank he shoof down right
The which even upon Acis fylle
So that with falling of this hylle
This Polyphemus Acys slough
Whereof she made sorrow enough
And as she fled from the land
Neptunus took her by the hond
And kept her in so fast a plac
Fro Polypheme and his manace
That he with his false envy
Ne might atteyne her company
This Galathe of whom I speak
That of her self may not be wreke
Withouten any semblaunt feyned
She has her loves death compleyned
And with her sorrow and with her woe
She has the goddis moved so
That they of pity and of grace
Have Acis in the same place
There he lay deed unto a well
Transformed as the books tell
With fressh stremes and with clear
As he whilome with lusty chere
Was fresshe his lust for to queme
And with his rude Polypheme
For his envy and for his hate
They were wroth and thus algate
Confessor
My sone thou might understand
That if thou wolt in grace stand
With love thou must leave envy
And as thou wylt for thy party
Toward thy love stand fre
So must thou suffer another be
What so byfalle upon thy chance
For it is a unwise vengeance
Which to none other man's lefe
And is unto him self grefe
Amans
My fader this ensample is good
But how so ever that it stood
With Polyphemus lone as tho
It shall not stand with me so
To worchen any felonye
In love for none such envy
For thy if there ought else be
Now axe forth in what degree
It is and I me shall confess
With shryfte unto your holiness

Which ^nuye takes his glad^^sse.
Of that he sees the heaviness
Of other men for his welfare
Is when he wot^ another care
Of that another has a fall^
He thinks him self arise with all
Such is the gladship of envy
In worlds thing and in party
Full oftymes and eke also
In toues cause it stant right so
If thou my sone have joy had
When thou another saw vnglad
Shryue the thero / my fadre yis
I am vysrno wen to yo w this
Of these lovers that lotten streyte
And fo: that point which they coucite
Ben pursuaunt^s from year to year
In soues court when I may fxr^
Now that they clymbe upon the whele
And when they wene al shall be well
They ben down throw at the last
Than am I fed of that I fast
And laughe when I see hem loure
And thus of that*they brewe loure
I drink sweet and am well ^sed
Of that they wot they ben dysesed
But this which I tell here
Is only for my lady dear
That for none other that I know
Me reheth not to overthrow
Ne who that stand in love vpryght
But be he squire or be he ^nyght
Which to my lady ward pursues
The more he leseth of that he seweth
The more than I think win
And am the more glad withynne
Of that I wot him sorrow endute
For ever upon such adventure
It is a comfort as men seyn
To see another in his peyn
So that they both may complain
Of hem that is so woe beseyne
Where I my self may not^auayle
To seen another man's travail
I am right glad and he be let
And though I fare not the let
Hie sow we is to mine heart a game
When that I know it is the same
Which to my lady stant enclyned
And has his love not termyned
I am right ioyeful in my thought
Of such envy greueth naught
As I ^e know me culpable
Ye that be wise and reasonable
My fadre tell your advise
Confessor
My sone envy to no pryse
Of such a form I understand
Ne might by no reason stand
For this envy has such a kind
That he wol set him self behind
To hinder with another wight
And gladly lose his own right
To make another lose his
And for to know* how it so is
A tale lyche to this matere
I thenke tell if thou wolt here
To show propyrly the vice
Of this ennye and the malice

oF Iubitex thus I find y write
That whilo^ how he would wite
Upon the pleynt which he herd
Among the men how yt it ferd
And of her wrong condycyon
To do Iustyfycacyon
And for that cause down he sent
An Aungel which about went
That he the soth know may
So it byfelle upon a day
This angel which him should inform
Was clothed in a man's form
And ouertook I understand
Two men that wenten over bond
Thorugh which he thought to aspye
His cause and goth in company
This Aungel with his words wise
Opposes hem in sundry wise
Now loud words and now soft
That made hem to desputen often
And each of hem his wason had
And thus with tales he hem lad
With good examynacyon
Till he knew the condycyon
What men they were both two
And saw also well at the last tho
That one of hem was coueyt^us
And his fe law was enuyous
And thus when he has knowlechyng
Anon he feyned departing
And said he mote algate wend
But harken now what fell at end
For than he made hem understand
That he was of gods sonde
And said them for the kyndeship
That they have done him felauship
He would do some grace again
And bad that one of hem should seyne
What thing is him leuest to crave
And he it shall of yefde have
And over that eke forth with all
He says that other have shall
The double that his felawe axeth
And thus to them his grace he taxes
The concytous was wondre glad
And to that other man he had
And seyth that he fyvst ax^ should
For he supposes that he would
Make his axyng of worlds good
For than he knew well how it stood
If that him self by double wight
Shall after take and thus by sleyght
By cause that he would win
He ^ad his felawe first begin
This enuyous though it be late
When that he saw he mot^ algate
Make his axynges first he thought
If he worship or proufyte sought
It shall be double to his fere
That would he chese in no manner
But than he shows what he was
Toward envy and in this ^as
Unto this Angel and thus he said
And for his yef^e and thus he preyd
To make him blind on his own eye
So that his felawe no thing syghe
This word was not so sone spoke
That his own eye was look*
And his felawe forth with also
Was blind on both his eyes two
Tho was that other glad enough
That one wept and that other ^ough
And he set his on^ tie at no cost
Whereof that other two has lost
Of thylke ensample which fell tho
Men tell now full often so
The world empeyreth commonly
And yet wot none the cause why
For it acordeth naught to kind
Mine own harm to s^che and find
Of that I shall my brother grieve
I might never well acheue
What s^yst thou sone of my folly
My fadre but if I should ly^
Upon the point which ye have said
Yet was mine heart never laid
But in the wise as I have told
But ouermore if that ye would
Ought else to my shryft say
Touchand envy I would pray

tOn^hend of enuyous brood
I wot not one of al good
But netheles such as they be /
Yet there is one and yt is he
Which ^l^ped is detractyon
And to conferme his actyon
He has with hold male bouche
Whoos tongue never cross ne crouche
May here so that he prouounce
A pleyne good word without frou^ce
O where behind a man's bak
For though he pr^yse he fynt some lak
Which of his tale is ay the last
That all the price shall over cast
And though there be no cause why
Yet wol he iangle not for thy
As he yt was which has yt herauldye
Of hem that vsen for to lie
For as the nettle which up renneth
The fresshe read Rose brenneth
And makes him fade and pale of hew
Right so this false enuyous hew
In every place where he duelleth
With falls words which he tells
He torneth preysyng in to blame
And worship in to worlds shame
Of such lesynges as he compasses
Is not so good that he ne passes
Byt wene his teth and bakbyted
And thorugh his false tongue endyted
Like to the Sharnebyrdes kind
Of whose nature that I find
That in the hotest of the day
When comen is the merry may
He spret his wynge and up he flees
And under al about he sees
The fair lusty flowers spryng
But thereof has he no lykyng
Where he sees of any best
The filthe there he makes his feste
And thereupon he would alyghte
There lyketh him none other syghte
Right so this iangler enuyous
Though he a man se virtuous
And full of good condycyon
Thereof makes he no mencyon
But else be it not so ly^e
Whereof that he may see a wit
There renneth he with open mouth
Behind a man and makes it couth
But all the virtue which he can
That wol he hyde of every man
And openly the vice tell
As he which of the scole of hell
Is taught and fostred up with ^nuye
Of household and of company
Where that he has his propre office
To set on every man a vice
How so his mouth be comely
His word evermore sit on wry
And seyth the werst that he may
And in this wise now a day
In loves court a man may here
Full often pleyne of this matere
That many enuyous tale is stered
Where that it may not be ansuered
But yet full often it is byleued
And many a worthy love is grieved
Thorugh bakbytynge of falls envy
IF thou have made such ianglarye
In loves court my sone or this
hIc in amoris causa huins vicij ^^i men ad memoriam reducens Co^fesfessor

sHryue the thereof / My fadre yis
But wit ye how not openly
But other while privily
When I my dear lady mete
And think how I am not mete
Unto her high worthynesse
And ese I see her business
Of all this young busty route
Which al day pursues her about
And each of them his time a wayteth
And each of them his tale affayteth
Al to deceive an Innocent
Which wol not be of her assent
And for men seyn vnknow^n vnkist
Her thombe she held in her fist
So close with n^ her own hond
That there may win noman land
She leueth not all that, she hereth
And thus full often her self she skereth
And is al ware of had I wist
But for all that mine heart aryst
When I these common lovers see
That would not hold hem to three
But welny louen oueral
Mine heart is enuyous with all
And ever I am adrad of gyle
In aunter if within any while
They might here Innocence enhaunte
For thy my words full often I haunte
Behynden hem so as I dare
Whereof my lady may be ware
I say what ever comes to mouth
And wers I would if that I couth
For when I come unto here speech
All that I may enquere and seche
Of such deceyte I tell it al
And ay the worst in specyal
So feign I would that she wist
How little they ben for to tryst
And what they would and what they me^t
So as they be of double encent
Thus toward hem that wykked mean
My wykked word was ever grene
And netheles the soth to tell
In certain if it so byfelle
That ^^der trewest man y bore
To chese among a thousand score
Which were al fully for to tryst
My lady loved and I it wist
Yet rather than he should speed
I would such tales sprede
To my lady if that I might
That I wol al his pain unright
And thereto would I do al my pain
For certes though I should feyne
And tell that was never thought
For all this world I might naught
To suffer another fully win
There as I am yet to begin
For be they good or be they bad
I would none my lady had
And that me makes fnlof^e aspye
And vsen words of envy
As for to make them bear a blame
And that is but of thylk fame
The which unto my lady draw
For ever on them I run and gnawe
And hinder hem all that ever I may^
And that is sothly for to say
But only to my lady selue
I celle it naught to and or twelve
Thereof I wol me well auyse
To speak or iangle in any wise
That touches to my lady name
The which in ernest and in game
I would save to my lady death
For me had lever to lakke breath
Than speak of her name amys
Now have ye herd touchend of this
My sndre in Confession
And therefore in detraxyon
In love that I have myspoke
Tesse hour will it shall be wroke
I am al ready for to bear
My pain and also for to lere
What thing that ye wol allow
For who is hounden he must bow
So wol I bow unto your best
For I dar make this byhest
That I to you have nothyug hyd
But told right as it is betyd
And otherwise of no myspeche
My conseyente for to seche
I can not of envy find
That I myspoke have ought behind
Whereof who so ever be myspayd
Now have ye herd and I have said
What wol ye fadre that I do
My sone do no more so
But ever keep thy tongue stylle
Thou myt the more have of thy will
For as thou seyst thy seluen here
My lady is of such manner
So wise so ware in all things
It needs of no bakbytynges
That thou thy lady mys enforine
For when she knows all the form
How that thy self art enuyous
Thou shall not be gracyous
As thou parauentur sholdest be else
There wol no man drynk of the wells
Which as he wot is poison ynne
And often such as men begin
To wards other such as they find
That set hem often fer behind
When that they wenen be before
My good sone and thou therefore
Be ware and leave thy wicked speech
Whereof has fallen often wreche
To many a man before this time
For who so wol his hands time
They must be the more vncleue
For many a mote shall be seen
That wol not else eleue there
And that should every wise man fere
For who so wol another blame
He sekyth often his own shame
Which else might be right stylle
For thy if that it be thy will
To stand upon amendment
A tale of great entendemet
A think to tell for thy sake
Whereof thou might ensample take

And she thereof was glad enough
And under that anon she droughe
With falls words that she spak
Couyne of death behind his bak
And ever upon here ordinance
She made so that when Constaunce
Was comen forth with the Romans
Of Clerks and of Cytezeynes
A Rich feste she hem made
Her close envy tho she sprade
And al tho that hadden be
Or in apert or in pryue
Of connseyll of the marriage
She slough hem in a sodeyne rage
Endelong the board as they be set
So that it might not be let

Making many a woeful moan
When al was slain but she al one
This old fend this Sarazyn
Let take anon this Constancyn
With all the good she thither brought
And ordained as she thought
A naked ship without stere
The which the good and her in fere

But she her would not confess

Upon a day that fast by
In presence of her husbond
Where they go walkyng on the stronde
A blind man which came there lad
Unto this wife cryend he bad
With both his hondes up and prayde
To her and in this wise he said
O Hermegylde which Crystes feyth
Informed as Constaunce seyth
Received have give me my sight
Upon this word her heart aflyght
Thynkyng what was best to done
But netheles the herd his bone
And said in trust of Crystes law
Which done was on the cross and slawe
Thou blind man behold and se
With that to god upon his kne

Whereof they marvel euerychone
But Elda wondreth most of all
This open thing which is byfalle
Coucludeth hem by such a weye

This Elda forth unto the king
A morrow took his weye and rode
And Hermegyld at home abode
Forth with Constaunce well at ese
Elda which thought his king to plese
As he that than vnwedred was
Of Constance all the pleyne cas
As goodly as he couthe told
The king was glad and said he would
Come thither in such a wise
That he him might on her auyse
The time appointed forth with all
This Elda trust in specyal
Upon a knight whom fro childhode
He had up draw in to manhood
To him he told all that he thought
Whereof that after him forthought
And netheles that ylke tide
Unto his wife he bad him ride
To make ready al thing
Against the coming of the king
And says that he him self to fore
Thenketh to come and therefore
That he him keep and told him when
This knight rode forth his weye than
And soth was that of time passed
He had in all his wit compassed
How he Constaunce might win
But he saw tho no speed therynne
Whereof his lust bygan to bate
And that was love is than hate
Of her honor he had envy
So upon his trecherye
A lesyng in his heart he cast
Till he come home he hygheth fast
And does his lady to understand
The message of her husbonde
And thereupon the long day
They setten things in array
That al was as it should be
Of every thing in his degree
And when it came in to the night
This wife her has to bed dyght
Where that this maiden with her lay
This false knight upon delay
Has tarried till they be a sleep
As he that wol time keep
His dedely works to fulfylle
And to the bed he stalketh stylle
Where that he wist was the wife
And in his hond a rasour knyf
He bare with which her throat he cut
And pryuely the knyf he put
Under the other beds side
Where that Constaunce lay beside

And stylle with a pr^uy light

And forth with all she cast a look
And saw this lady blede there

And to the bed with that he yede
After the falsh^de of his speech
And made him there for to seche
And fond the knyf there it said
And than he cried and than he said
Lo see the knyf al blody here
What needs more in this matere
To ^ye and thus her Innocence
He s^laundreth there in audyence
With falls words which he feyneth
But yet for that he compleyneth
Elda no full credence took
And har^ed that there lay a book
Upon the which when he it syghe
This knyt has swore and said on high
That al men might it wit
Now by this book which here is write
Constance is gyltyf well I wot
With that the hond of heaven him smote
In token of that he was forswore
There he has both his eyes lore
Out of his head the same stou^de

A wys was herd when that they fell
Which said O dampened man to hell
Lo thus has god thy s^lau^dre wroke
That thou ageyn Co^stance have spoke

And he told out his felonye
And starf forth with his tale anon

For he the second day at morrow
The king came as they were acorded
And when it was to him recorded
What god has wrout upon this chance
He took it in to remembrance
And thought more than he said
For all his hool heart he laid
Upon Constaunce and said he should
For love of her if that she would
Baptysme take and crystes feyth
Believe and over that he seyth
He would her wedde and upon this
Assured each to other is
And for to make shrot tales
There came a bishop out of wales
Fro Bangor and lucye he hight
Which through ye grace of god almyt
The king with many other mo
He crystned and between hem two
He has fulfilled the marriage
But for no lust ne for no rage
She told him never what she was
And netheles upon this cas
The king was glad how so it stood
For well he wist and understood
She was a noble creature
The high maker of nature
Her has vysyted in a through we
That it was openlyche know

Whereof abouen al other thing
He thanked god and was right glad
And fell that time he was bestad
Upon a werre and must ride

And took his lettres to the king
And when he saw this wondre thing
He makes the messager no chere
But netheles in wise manner

Which says do you for to wit
That thorugh the counsel of you two
It stand in point to be undo
As he which is a king deposed
For every man it has supposed
How that my wife Constance is faye
And if that I feyne the delay
To put her out of company
The worship of my regalye
Is lore and over this they tell
Here child shall not among you dwell
To claymen any heritage
So can I see none advantage
But al is lost if she abide
For thy to look on every side
Toward the meschyef as it is
I charge you and bid this

In which that she took arryuaylle
Theryn and puts both two
Her self forth with her child also
And so forth brought in to the deep
Be takes her the sea to keep
Of four days time set
That ye this thing no longer let
So that your life be not forfete
And thus this letter counterfete
The messagyer which was unware
Upon the kings halue bare
And where he should it have bytake
But when that they head take
And rad that written is withynne
So great a sorrow they begin
As they her own modre seyen
Brenne in a fire before their eyes
There was weeping and there was woe
But finally the thing is do
Upon the sea they have here brought
But she the cause wist naught
And thus upon the flood they wone
This lady with her young sone
And than her hands to the heuene
She straught and with a mylde steuene
Knelend upon her bare kne
She said O high mageste
Which see the point of every troth
Take of thy woeful woman routh
And of thylk child which I shall keep
And with yt word she bygan to weep
Swouned / as deed and there she lay
But he which al things may
Comfort her and at the last
She looks and her eyes cast
Upon her child and said this
Of me no manner charge it is
What sorrow I suffer but of the
Me thinks it is great pity
For if I sterue thou shall deye
So mote I needs by that weye
For moderhode 7 for tendrenesse
With all mine hole business

As she which shall be thy Noryce
Thus was she strengthed for to sto^de
And the she took her child on hand
And yaf it souke / but ever among
She wept and other while song
To rokke with her child on sleep
And thus her own child to keep
She has under the gods cure

aNd so fell upon adventure
When ylke year has made his end
Her ship so as it mote wend
With strength of wynd which god has
yine / Estward was in to spayn drive
Right fast under a castle wall
Where that an hethen admyralle
Was lord and he afterward had
One Thelons which al was bad
A falls knight and a renegate
He goth to look in what estate
The ship was comen and there he fond
Forth with a child upon her hand
This lady where she was al one
He took head on the person
And saw she was a worthy wight
And thought he would upon the night
Demene her at his own will
And in the ship she kept her stylle
That noman saw her not that day
At gods will and thus she lay
Unknow what her shall betyde
And fell so that by nyghtes tide
This knight without felauship
Has take a boot and came to ship
And thought of her his lust to take
And swore if she him danger make
That certeynly she should deye
She saw there was none other weye
And bad him for her comfort
That he look first out at the port
That no man were nygh the stead
Which might know what they deed
And that he may do what he would
He was right glad that she so told
And to the port anon he ferde
She prays god and he her herd
And suddenly he was out through we
And dreynt and then bygan to blow
Wind meuable fro the land
And thus the mighty gods hand
Her has conveyed and defended
And when three year ben full dispended

And bad men to go in and se
This lady tho was ^rope on side

And brought up her child and here
And thereupon this lord to spear

But why the cause wot I naught
But which al things wrought
Yet ay I thank him of his might

But ferthermore for naught he prayde
Of her astate the truth pleyne
She would him else nothing s^yne
But of her name which she feyned
Al other things she restreyned
That a word more she ne told
This lord than axeth if she wold^
With him abide in company
And said he came fro Barbarye
To Rome ^ard and home he w^nte
Tho she supposes what it mente
And says she would with him wend
And duelle to her lives end
If it so be to his plesaunce
And thus upon here acquaintance
He told her pleynly as it stood
Of Rome how that the gentyl blood
In Barbarye was bytrayed
And thereupon he has assayed
By werre and take such vengeance
That none of thylk allyaunce
By whom the treson was compassed

And ^yche the fire which tho^der hence
In such a rage as s^yth the book

And brunt to fore her sons eye

For she it had well deserved

This sorrowful king was so bys^ad
That he shall neuermore be glad
He seyth eftsone for to wedde
Till he wist how that she spedde

And thought he would be releued
Of soul hele upon the feyth
Which he has take than he seyth
That he to Rome on pylgremage
Would go where pope was pelage
To take his absolucyon
And upon this condycyon

Of Ca^odece he said Arcenne

To him goth Elda forth right
And told him of his lord tydyng
And prayed for that his coming
He would assygne him herbergage
And he so did of good courage
When al is do that is to done

But it was for the king Allee
For joy which fell in her thought
That god him has to Town brout
This king has spoke with the pope
And told all that he couthe grope
What greueth in his conscience
And than he thought in reverence

But to Morys her sone told
That he upon the morrow should
In all that ever he couth and might
Be present in the kings sight
So that the king him often syghe
Morys to fore the kings ^ye
Upon the morrow where he sat
Full often stood and upon that
The king his chere upon him cast
And in his face he thought as fast
He saw his own wife Constance
For nature as in resemblaunce
Of face him lyketh for to clothe
That they were of one suyte both*
The king has moeued in his thought
Of yt he saw and knew it naught
This child he loves kyndely
And yett he wot no cause why
But well he saw and understood
That he toward Arcenne stood
And axeth him anon right there
If that this child his sone were
He said ye so I him call
And would it were so byfalle
But it is al in other wise
And tho began he to deuyse
How he the childs modre fond
Upon the sea from every land
Within a ship was stereles
And how this lady he speles
^^orth with her child he has forth draw
The king has understand his saw
The childs name and axeth tho
And what the modre hight also
That he him would tell he preyde
Moris this child is hot he seyde
His modre hat Cust and this
I not what manner name it is
But Allee wist well enough
Whereof somdele smylend he lough
For Cust in Saxon is to seyn
Constance upon the word Romeyn
But who that couthe specyfye
What tho was in his fantasye
And how his wytt about renneth
Upon the love in which he brenneth
It were wondre for to here
For he was neither there ne here
But clean out of him self awey
That he note what to thynk ne sey
So feyn he would it were she
Whereof his hertes pryuete
Bygan the werre of ye and nay
The which in such balaunce lay
That contenaunce for a throw
He lost till he might know
The soth but in his memory
The man which lies in purgatory
Desires not the heaven more
That he ne longs also sore
To wit what him shall betyde
And when the boordes were a side
And every man was rise about
The king has weyued all the route
And with the Senator al one
He spak and prayed him of a bone
To see this Cust where she duelleth
At home with him where as he tells
The Senator was well apayd
This king no longer is delayed
To see this Cust goth the king
And she was warned of the thing
And with Eleyne forth she came
Ayene the king and he tho nam
Good head and he saw his wife
Anon with all his hertes life
He caught her in his arms and kyst
Was never wight that syghe ne wist
A man that more joy made
Whereof they weren al glad
Which herd tell of this channce
The king tho with his wife Co^sta^ce
Which had a great part of his will
In Rome for a time stylle
Abode and made him well at case
But so yet coud he never please
Of her estate the truth pleyne
His wife that she would him seyne
Of what conntre that she was bore
Ne what she was and yet therefore
With all his wit he did seek
Thus as they lay in bed and speak
She prayth him and counseyleth both
That for the worship of hem both
So as here thought it were honest
He would an honorable fest
Make or he went in the Cite
Where the Emperor shall be
He granted all that she him prayed
But in that time as men said
Thylk Emperor from that day
That first his daughter went away
He was than after never glad
But what that any man him bad
Of grace for his daughter sake
That grace would he naught forsake
And thus full great alms he deed
Wher^f she had many a bid
qValiter Constancia que antea per totum tempus exilij sui penes omnes
incognitam se celauit tunc ^^mum patri suo Imperatori se ipsam per omnia

tHis Emperor out of the town
Within a ten mile e^uyroune
Where as it thought him for the best
Has sundry places for to rest
And as fortune would tho
He was duellend at one of tho
The king Allee forth with thassent
Of Cust his wife has thither sent
Moryce his sone as he was taught
To The Emperor and he goth straught
And in his fadre halue he sought
As he which his lordship sought
Tht he of his high worthynes
He would do so great mekenes
His own Town to come and see
And give a time in the Cite
So that his fadre might him get
That be wosd ones with him ete
This ford has granted his request
And when the day was of the fest
An worship of the Emperor
The king and este the Senator
Forth with her wives both two
With many a lord and lady mo
On horse ryden him again
Till it byfell upon a pleyne
They syghe where he was comend
With that Constaunce anon preyend
Spak to her lord that he abide
So that I may to fore ride
To ben upon his bien benu
The first which shall him salu
And thus after her lords grant
Upon a mule white amblaunt
Forth with a few rood his qu^ne
They wondered what she would mean
But ryden after a soft pas
But when this lady comen was
To the emperor in his presence
She said aloude in audyence
My lord my fadre well you be
And of this time that I se
Your honor and your good he le
Which is the help of my quarele
I thank unto the gods might
For t^ye his ^^rt was aflyght
Of that she told in remembrance
And when he wist it was Constau^ce
Was never fadre half so blythe
Wepend he kyst her often sithe
So was his heart al overcome
For though his modre were come
Fro death to life out of the grave
He might no more wonder have
Than he has when he her sight
With that her own lord come night
And is to the emperor obeyed
And when that comfort is be w^eyed
How that Constaunce is come about
So hard an heart was none out
That he for pity tho ne wept
Arcenius which her fond and kept
Was than glad of that is fall
So that with joy among hem all
They ryden in at Rome gate
This Emperor thought al to late
Till that the pope were come
And of tho lords send some
To pray him that he wol have
And he came forth in all have
And when he the tale herd
How wonderly his chance ferd
He thanked god of his miracle
To whom may be none obstable
The king a noble feste hem made
And thuo they were al glade
A parliament or that they went
They setten unto this intent
To put Rome in full espeyre
That morys was apparent heir
And should abide with him stylle
For such was all the lands will
Qualiter Mauricius cum Impera to ^e vt here is imperij remansit / Et Rex Allee
et Constancia in ang^^am regres si sunt

wHen every thing was fully spoke
Of soro we and queynt was al yt smoke
Tho took his leave allee yt king
And with full many a rich thing
Which the emperor him had give
He has a glad life for to live
For he Constance has in his hond
Which was the comfort of his land
For when that he come home again
There is no tongue that might seyne
What joy was that ylke stou^de
Which ^rst was sent of gods sound
By whom the mysbileue of sin
Was left and Crystes feyth came ynne
To hem that whilome were blind
Qualiter Rex All^^ in Ang^a post bicnnium humane carnis resolucionem subiens
nature debitum persoluit / post cuius obitum Co^stancia cum patre suo Rome se

^t he which hyndreth every kind
And for no gold may be forlout
The death coming or he besought
Took with this king such acqueyntau^ce
That he with all his retenau^ce
Ne might not defend his life
And thus he parts from his wife
Which than made sorrow enough
And thereupon her heart droughe
To leave England for ever
And go where that she had lever
To Rome whens that she came
And thus of all the land she nam
Her leave and goth to Rome again
And after that the books seyne
She was not there but a through we
When death of kind has overthrow
Her worthy fadre which men seyde
That between her arms deyde
And after ward the year suend
The god of her has made an end
And fro this worlds fayrye
Has take her in to company
Moryce her sone was coroned
Which so ferforth was abandoned
To Crystes feyth that men him call
Morys the Crystnest of all
And thus the whele meuyng of love
Was at the last set above
And so as thou have herd to fore
The false tunges were lore
Which upon love would lie
For thy touchend of this envy
Which longs unto bakbytyngr
Be ware thou make no lesyng
In hyndryng of another wight
And if thou would be taught aryght
What meschyef bakbytyng does
By other weye a tale soth
Now might thou here anon sewend

IN'a Cronyque as thou shall wit
A great ensample I find write
Which I shall tell upon this thing
Phelyp of Macedonye the king
Two sons had he by his wife
Whose fame is yet in greece ryf
Demetrius the first brother
Was hot and Perseus that other
Demetrius they sayden tho
The better knight was of tho
To whom the land was attendanut
As he which heir was apparaunt
To regne after his fadre day
But that / thing which no water may
Quench in this world but ever brenneth.
In to his brother heart renneth
The proud envy of that he sygh^
His brother should clynne on hyg^^
And he to him than mote obey
That may he suffer by no wey^
With strength durst he no thing sto^^
So took he lesyng upon hand
When he sygh time and spak thereto
For it byfelle that time so
His fadre great werres had
With Rome which he streyt lad
Thorugh myty strength of his ma^hod
As he which has yuough knygthod
And often him had sore grieved
But or the werre were acheued
As he was upon ordinance
At home in greece it fell par chance
Demetaus which often about
Rydend was stood that time out
So that this Perse in his absence
Which bare the tongue of pestylence
With falls words which he feyneth
Upen his own brother pleyneth
In pryuete behind his bak
And to his fadre thus he spak
My dear fadre I am hold
By wey of kind as reason would
That I fro you shall no thing hyde
Which might torn in any side
In your estate to greuaunce
For thy mine hertes obeysaunce
Toward you I thenke to keep
For it is good ye take keep
Upon a thing which is me told
My brother has us al sold
To hem of Rome and you also
For then they behote him tho
That he with them shall regne in pees
Thus has he cast for his encres
That your estate shall go to naught
And thus to prove shall be brought
So ferforth that I undertake
It shall not well mow be forsake
The king upon his tale ansuerd
And said if this thing which he herd
Be soth and may be brought to prove
It shall not be to his behoue
Which us has shapen so the werst
For he him self shall be the ferst
That shall be deed if / that I may
Thus afterward upon a day
When that Demetrius was come
Anon his fadre has him nome
And bad to his brother Perse
That he his tale shall reherce
Of thylk treson which he told
And which al untruth would
Counseylleth that so high a need
Be treted where as it may speed
In common place of jugement
The king thereto yafe his assent
Demetrius was put in hold
Whereof that Perseus was bold
Thus stood the troth under ye charge
And the falshede goth at large
Which thou^gh byhest has overcome
The grettest of the lords some
That preuelyche of his acord
They stond as witness of record
The Judge was made favorable
Thus was the law deceyuable
So ferforth that the fronth fond
Rescouse none and thus the land
Forth with the king deceived were
The gyliles was dampened there
And deyde upon acusement
But such a falls conspyrement
Though it be preuy for a throw
God would not it were unknow
And yt was after ward well proved
In him which has yt death co^troued
Of that his brother was so slain
This Perseus was wondre fayn
As he that*tho was apparau^t
Upon the regne and expectau^t
Whereof he wax so proud and beyn
That he his fadre in dysdeyn
Has take and set at none acompte
As he which thout him to surmou^te
That where he was first de bonayr^
He was tho rebelle and contrayre
And not as heyr but as a king
He took upon him in all thing
Of malice and of tyranny
In contempt of Regalye
Lived his fadre and so wrought
That when the fadre him bethought
And saw to whedyr side it droughe
Anon he wist well enough
How Perse his false tongue
Has so thenuyous belle ronge
That he has slain his own brother
Whereof as then he knew none other
But suddenly the Judge he nome
Which corrupt sat upon the dome
In such a wise and has him pressed
That he the soth him has confessed
Of all that he has spoke and do
More sorry than the king was tho
Was never man upon this molde
And thought in certain that he would
^engeaunce take upon this wrong
But the other party was so strongr
That for the law of no statute
There may no right be execute
And upon this dyuysyon
The land was turned up so down
Whereof his herb is so distraught
That he for pure sorrow has caught
The maladye of which nature
Is queynt in every creature
And when this king is passed thus
This false tonged Perseus
The regyment has vnderfonge
But there may no thing stond long
Which is not upon truth grounded
For god which has al thing bou^ded
And saw the falshede of his gyle
Has set him but a little while
That he shall regne upon depose
For suddenly as the rose
So suddenly down he fell
In thylk time it so byfelle
This new king of new pride
With strength shope him for to ride
And said he would Rome waste
Whereof he made a besy haste
And has assembled him an host
In all that ever he might most
What man that might wepen be re
Of al he would none forbe re
So that it might not be nombred
The folk which was encombred
Thorugh him yt god would overthrow
Anon it was at Rome know
The pomp which that Perse lad
And the Romans that time had
A consul which cleped was thus
The name Panle Emilius
A noble and a worthy knight with all
And he which cheef was of all
This werre on hond has undertake
And when he should his leave take
Of a young daughter which was his
She wept and what cause it is
He axeth and she him ansuereth
That Perseus is deed and he it hereth
And wondreth what she mean would
And upon childehode him told
That Perse his little hound is deed
Withethat he pulls up his head
And made right a glad vysage
And said how that was a presage
Touchend unto that other Perse
How that fortune him shald adverse
He seyth for such a prenostyke
Most of an hound was to him like
For as it is an hounds kind
To berke upon a man behind
Right so behind his broders bak
With falls words which he spak
He has do slain and that is routhe
But he which hates al untruth
The high god it shall redress
For so my daughter prophetess
Forth with her little hounds death
Betokens and thus forth he geth
Conforted of this euydeuc^
With the Romans in his defense
Again the greeks that be comende
This Perseus as naught semende
This meschyef which that him abode
With all his multitude rode
And prayed him upon the thing
Of that he was bycomen a king
And how he had his Royalme get
That he has all the right foryete
Which longs unto governance
Whereof thorugh good ordinance
It fell upon the winter tide
That with his host he should ride
Oner Dauubye thylke flood
Which al be frorn than stood
So hard that he wend well
To pass but the blind wheel
Which torneth often or men beware
Thylk ye which horse men bare
To brak so that a great party
Was dreynt of the chyualrye
The rereward it took awey
Came none of hem to land drey
Paulus the worthy knyt romeyn
By his aspye it herd seyn
And hastes all that he may
So that upon that other day
He came where he this host byheld
And that was in a large feld
Where the baners ben displayed
He has anon his men arrayed
And when that he was enbataylled
He goth and has the feld assaylled
And slough and took all that he fond
Whereof the Macedonye land
Which through king alisa^der is honored /
Long time stood was than devoured /
To Perse and al infortune
^^^y wit so that the comune
Of all the land his heir exyle
And he dyspeyred for the while
Desguysed in a power wede
To Rome goth and there for need
The ^^aft which thylk time was
To worken in lawn^ and in bras
He lerneth for his sustenaunce
Such was the sons purueaunce
And of his fadre it is said
In strong prison that he was laid
In Albe where that he was deed
For honger and for defaulte of bread
The hounde was token of prophecye
That lyche an hound he should dye
Which lyche was of condycyon
When he with detractyon
Bark on his brother so behind
Coufessor
Lo what proufyde a man may find
Which hyndre wol another wight
For thy with all thyn hool might

Amans
My fadre else were I nyce
For ye thereof so well have spoke
That it is in mine heart look
And ever shall but of envy
If there be more in his baylye
Toward love say me what
My sone as gyle under the hat
With sleyghtes of a Tregetour
Is hyd envy of such color
Has yet the fourth deceyuaunt
The which is cleped falls semblaunt
Whereof the matter and the form
Now herkne and I the shall inform
Nil bilinguis aget nisi duplo conci tat ore / Dumque diem loquitur vox sua
vota tegit / Vultus habet lucem tenebras men's sermo salutem / Actus sed morbum
dat suus esse grauem / Pox tibi quam spondet magis est prenostica guerre.
Comoda si dederit disce subesse dolum / Qnodque patet esse fides in eo fraus

oF falls se^blau^t if I shall tell
Above al other it is ye well
Out of yt which deceyt flows
There is no man so wise that knows
Of thylkf lood which is the tide
Ne how he should him self guide
To take sauf passage there
And yet the wynd to man's ere
Is soft and as it seems out
It makes clear weder al about
But though it seem it is not so
For falls semblaunt has ever moo
Of his counseyl in company
The derke untrue Ipocrysye
Whoos word destroys in his thout
For thy they be to gyder brought
Of one couyne of one household
As it shall after ward thus be told
Of falls semblaunt it needs naught
To tell of old ensamples ought
For all day in experyence
A man may see thylk euydence
Of fair words which he hereth
But yet the barge of envy stereth
And halt it ever from the land
Which falls se^blau^t with oore in hond
It roweth and wol not arryue
But let it on the wawes drive
In great tempest and great debate
Whereof that love and his estate
Empeyreth and therefore I read
My sone that thou flee and dread
This vice and what that other seyn
Let thy semblaunt be true and pleyn
For falls semblaunt is thylk vice
Which never was without office
Where that envy thinks to gyle
He shall before that ylke while
Of pryue counseylle be messagere
For when his semblaunt is most clear
Than is he most derke in his thought
Though man him se they know him
nout / But as it shows in the glass
Thing which theryn never was
So shows it in his vysage
That never was in his courage
Thus does al his thing with sleyght
Now lay thy conscience in weight
My good soue and shryue the here
If thou were ever customere
To falls semblaunt in any wise
For ought I can me yet auyse
My good fadre certes no
For I for love have do so
Now axe I would pray you
For else I wot never bow
Of falls semblau^t how yt I have gy^t
My sone and sethyn that thou wylt
That I shall axe gabbe naught
But tell if ever was thy thought
With falls semblaunt and couerture
To wit of any creature
How that he was with love stad
So weary or sorry or he were glad
When thou wystyst how it were
All that he rouneth in thyn ere
Thou toldest forth in other place
To setten him fro loves grace
Of that woman that him best list
Theryn no man his counseyll wist
But thou by whom he was deceive*
Of love and from his purpoos weyued
And thoughtest at his dysturbaunce
Thyn own cause should auaunce
As who seyth I am so secret
There may no man's pryuete
Beh^led halue so well as mine
Art thou my sone of such engyn
Tell on / My good fadre nay
As for the more party I say
But of somdele I am byknowe
That*I may stand in thylk row
Among hem that saundres use
I wol me not thereof excuse
That I with such color ne steyne
When I my best semblaunt feyne
Tell my fela we of that I wot
Al his counseylle both cold and hot
For by that cause I make him chere
Till I his love know and here
And if so be mine heart soucheth
That ought unto my lady touches
Of love that he would me tell
Anon I run unto the well
And cast water in to the fire
So that his carte amyd the fire
By that I have his counseyll know
Full often sith I overthrow
When that he weneth best to stand
But this I do you to understand
If that a man love else where
So that my lady be naught there
And he me tell he wol it hyde
There shall no word escape aside
Forth with deceypt of no semblaunt
To him break I none covenant
Me lyketh not in other place
To let no man of his grace
Ne for to be Inquesyty^
To know another man's life
Where that he love or love naught
That toncheth no thing to my thout
But al it passes thorugh mine ere
Right as a thing that never were
And is foryete and laid aside
But if it touches any side
My lady as I have er spoken
Mine eres be than naught loken
For certes when that by tyt
My will mine heart and al my wit
Ben fully set to harken and spear
What any man wol say of here
Thus have I feyned company
Full often for I would aspye
What thing it is that any man
Tell of my worthy lady can
And for two causes I do this
The first cause whereof is
At that I might harken and seek
That any man of her myspeke
I wol excuse her so fully
That when she wist it verily
Mine hope should be the more
To hane her thank for evermore
That other cause I you assure
Is why that I see couerture
Have feyned semblaunt oftyme
To them that passen al day byme
And ben^ lovers as well as I
For this I wene truly
That there is of hem al none
That they ne louen euerychone
My lady sothelyche I leave
And durst sytten it in preue
Is none so wise that should asterte
But he were lustles in his heart
For why and he my lady syghe
Her vysage and her goodly eye
But he her loved or he went
And for that such is mine intent
That is the cause of mine aspye
Why that I feyne company
And make follow over al
For gladly would I known al
And hold me covert always
That I fulofte ye or nay
Ne list ansuere in any wise
But feynyng semblaunt as the wise
And harken tales till I know
My lady lovers al on row
And when I here how they have wrought /
I fare as though I herd it nout.
And as I no word understood
But that is no thing for her good
For leueth well soth it is
That when I know it so is
I wol but fordren hem a lyte
But all the werst I can endyte
I tell it to my lady plat
For forthryng of mine own estat
And hyndre them all that I may
But for all that yet dar I say
I find unto my self no bote
Al though mine heart needs mote
Though of love all that I here
Dyscouer unto my lady dear
For in good feyth I have no might
To hele fro that sweet wight
If that it touches her any thing
But this wot well the heaven king
That sythen first this world bygan
Unto none other strannge man
Ne feyned I semblannt ne chere
To wit or axe of this matere
Though yt he loves x or twelve
When it was naught my lady selue
But if he would axe any read
Al onlyche of his own head
How he with other love ferde
His tales with mine eres I herd
But to mine heart came it naught
Ne sanke no depper in my thought
Bnt held counseylle as I was bid
And told it never m other stead
But let it pass^as it come
Now fadre say what is thy dome
And how thou wolt yt I be peyned
For falls semblan^t as I have feyned
My sone if reason be well peised
There may no virtue be up raised
Ne vice none be set in pryse
For thy my sone if thou be wise
Do no vyser upon my face
Which wol not thyn heart embrace
For if thou do within a throw
To another man it shall be know
So myt thou lightely fall in blame
And lose a great part of thy name
And netheles in this degree
Full oftyme thou might se
Of such men as now a day
This vice set in assay
I speak for no man's blame
But for to warn the thy shame
My sone as I may here talk
In every place where I walk
I not if it be so or none
But it is many days gone
That I first herd tell this
How falls semblau^t has be and is
Most commonly from year to year
With hem that duelle among us here
Of such as we Lumbardes call
For they be the slyest of all
So as men seyn in Town about
To feyne and show thing without
Which is reuers to that within
Whereof that they often wyn
When they by reason should lose
They ben the last and yet they chief
And we first and yet behind
We gone where as we should find
The proufyte of our own land
Thus gone they fre without bond
To done her proufyte al at large
And other men bear all the charge
Of Lumbardes unto this couyne
Which al lands conne engyne
May falls semblaunt in especyal
Br lykened for they ever al
Where that they thynken for to duelle
Among them self so as they tell
First ben informed for to lere
A craft which cleped is faucrere
For if faucrere come about
Than afterward stant no doubt
To void with a subtyle hand
The best goods of the land
And bring chaf and take corn
Where as faucrere goth to forn
In all his wey he fynt no let
That do^e can none vssher shet
In which him list to take enter
And thus the counseyll most secre
Of every thing faucrere knows
Which in to strange place he blows
Which he wot it may most grieve
And thus faucrere makes believe
So that full often he has deceived
Er that he may ben apperceyued
Thus is his vice for to dread
For who these old books read
Of such ensamples as were ar
Him ought be the more war
Of al tho that feynen chere
Whereof thou shall a tale here

currere pptuit ipsam tamquam propriam in preiudicium Herculis asportare fugiens
conabatur Per quoth non solum ipsi sed eciam Herculi mortis euentum fortuna post
modum causauit

oF falls semblaunt which is believed /
Full many a worthy
wight is grieved.
And was long time or he was bore
To the my sone I will therefore
A tale tell of falls semblaunt
Which falseth many a covenant
And many a fraud of falls cou^seylle
There be honged upon his seylle
And that abouten gylteles
Both Deyanyre and hercules
The which in great dysese fell
Thorugh falls semblau^t as I shall tell
When hercules within a throw
Al only has his heart throw
Upon the fair Deyanyre
It fell him on a day desire
Upon a river as he stood
That pass he would over the flood
Without bote and with him led
His love but he was in dread
For tendrenesse of that sweet wight
For he knew not the forth aryght
There was a geaunt than nyghe
Which Nessus hight and when he syghe
This hercules and Deianyre
Within his heart he began conspyre
As he which thought his trecherye
Has Hercules in great envy
Which he bare in his heart look
And than he thought it shall be wroke
But he ne durst netheles
Ayene this worthy Hercules
Fall in debate as for to fight
But feyned semblaunt al by sleyght
Of friendship and of al good
And comes where as they both stood
And makes hem all the chere he can
And says that here own man
He is / al ready for to do
What thing he may and it fell so
That than upon his semblaunt tryst
And axeth hem if that they wist
What thing were best to done
So that they myghten sauf and sont
The water pass he and she
And when Nessus the pryuete
Knew we of heart what it meant
As he that was double of intent
He made hem right a glad vysage
And when he herd of the passage
On him and her he thought gyle
And feyneth semblaunt for a while
But he thought al another wise
To done hem plesaunce and service
This Nessus with his words slyghe
Yaf counseylle to fore her eye
Which seemed outward prouffytable
And was within deceyuable
He bad hem of the stremes deep
That they beware and take keep
So as they know not the compass
But for to help in such a cas
He says him self that for his ease
He would if yt it might hem please
The passage of the water take
And for this lady undertake
To bear her to that other stronde
And sauf to set her upon the land
And Hercules may then also
The weye know how he should go
And they thereto acorden all
But what as after shall byfalle
Well paid was hercules of this
And this Geaunt also glad is
And took his lady upon lofte
And set her on his shulder soft
And in the flood bygan to wade
And he which no grutchyng made
And bare her oner sauf and sou^de
But when he stood on dry gronnd
And Hercules was far behind
He set his truth al out of mind
Who so there be lefe or loath
With Deianyre and forth he goth
As he thought to dysseuer
The company of hem for ever
When Hercules thereof took head
As fast as ever he might him speed
He hyeth after in a throw
And happens that he had a bow
The which in all have he bend
As he that would an arowe send
Which he to fore had venymed
He has so well his shot tymed
That him thorugh the body smet
And thus the false wight he let
But lest now such a felonye
When Nessus wist he should dye
He took to Deianyre his shert
Which with the blood was of his heart
Thorugh out desteyned over al
Told how she so^t keep shall
And pryuely to her intent
That if her lord his heart went
To love in any other place
This shyrt he says has such a grace
That if she may so mochel make
That he the shyrte upon him take
He shall al other let in veyn
And torn m to her love ageyn
Who was so glad but Deianyre
Her heart her thought was on a fire
Till it was in her Cofer look
So that thereof no word was spoke
The days gone the years pass
The hertes waxen less and less
Of hem that be to love untrue
This Hercules with heart new
His heart has set on Eolen
And thereof speken al men
This Eolen this fair maid
Was as men thylk time said
The kings daughter of Euryce
And she made Hercules so nyce
Upon her love and so assote
That he him clotheth in her cote
And she in his was clothed often
And thus feblesse is set alofte
And strength was put under foot
There can no man thereof do bo^e
When Deianyre has herd this speech
There was no sorrow for to seche
Of other help wot she none
But goth unto her coufer anon
With wepeud eye and woeful heart
She took out thylk unhappy sherte
And as she wend well to do
And brought her work about so
That Hercules this shert on deed
Of such intent and as she was bid
Of Nessus and as I said er
But that therefore was she not ye ner
And no fortune may be weyued
With falls semblaunt she was deceived
Then when she wend best have won
She lost all that she has bygonne
For thylk shert unto the bone
His body set a fire anon
And cleueth so it may not twynne
For the venym that was therynne
And he than as a wyld man
Unto the high wode ran
And as the clerk Ouyde tells
The great trees to the ground he felleth
With strength of his own might
And made an hughe fire vpryght
And lept him self therein at ones
And burnt him both flesh and bones
Which thing came thorugh falls se^bla^t
That falls Nessus the Geant
Made unto him and to his wife
Whereof that he has lost his life
And she also for euermo
For thy my sone or thou be woe
I read be well ware therefore
For when so great a man was lore
It ought to give a great conceypt
To warn al other of such deceypt
Grant mercy fader I am ware
So fer that I no more dare
Of falls semblaunt take acqueyntau^ce
But rather I wol do penance
That I have feyned chere or this
Now axe forth what so there ^s
Of that bylongeth to my shryfte
My sone yet there is the fyfte
Which is conceived of envy
And clepend is supplantarye
Thorugh whose compassement and gyle
Full many has lost his while
In love as well as other wise
Here after as I shall deuyse
Inuidus alte riu s ^ suppla^tator ho^ris Et tua quo vertat cultura subtus arat

Hie tractat Confessor de quinta spe cie Inuidie / que supplantacio dicitur cu
ius cultor pr^usque percipiatur aliene dignitatis and officij multocie^s
intrusor existens

tHe vice of Supplantacyon
With many a falls collacyon
Which he co^spireth'al unknow.
Full oftyme has overthrow
The worship of another man
So well no life awayte can
Ayene his sleyght for to cast
That he his purpoos at the last
Ne has or that it withset
But most of al his heart is set
In court upon these great offices
Of dygnytees and benefyces
Thus goth he with his sleyghte about
To hyndre and shoue another out
And stonden with his slyghe compass
In seed there another was
And so to set him self ynne
He r^ebeth not be so he win
Of that another man shall l^se
And thus full often chalk for chief
He changes with full little cost
Whereof another has the lost
And he the proufyt shall receive
For his fortune is to receive
And for to change upon the whele
His woo with other men's well
Of that another man avails
His astate thus up he hayleth
And takes the byrd to his beyete
Where other men the busshes beat
My sone and in the same wise
There be lovers of such empryse
That shapen hem to be relyeued
Where it is wrong to be achyeued
For it is an other man's right
Which he has take day and night
Ty keep for his own store
Toward him self for evermore
And is his propre by the law
Which thing that axeth no felawe
But they that worchen by supplauut
And take a part of thylk plant
Which he has for him self set
And so fulofte is al vnknet
That some man weneth be right fast
For supplaunt with his sly cast
Full often happens for to mow
Thing which another man has ^owe
And makes common of propyrte
With sleyghte and with subtylte
As men may seen from year to year
Thus cleymeth he the boot to stere
Of which another master is
For thy my sone if thou or this
Have ben of such professyon
Dyscouer thy Confession
Have thou supplanted any man
For ought that I you tell can
Mine holy fadre as of the deed
I am withouten any dread
And gilteles but of my thought
My censcyence excuse I naught
For were it wrong or were it right
Me lacks no thing but might
That I ne would long or this
Of other man's love ^wys
By wey of Supplantacyon
Have made appropryacyon
And hold that I never bought
Though it another man forthought
And all this speak I but of one
For whom I let al other gone
But here I may not ouerpasse
That I ne mote alwey compass
^e rought not by what queynty^e
So that I might in any wise
Fro such that my lady serve
His heart make for to swerue
Without any part of love
For by thegoddes al above
I would it might so byfalle
That I alone should hem all
Supplante and welde her at my will
And yt thing may I naught fnlfylle
And if I should strength make
And that I dar not undertake
Thongh I were as was Alysander
For thereof might rise a sklaunder
And certes that shall I do never
For in good feyth yet had I lener
In any symplesse for to dye
Than worche such supplantarye
Of other wise I wol not say
That if I fond a syker way
I would as for conclusyon
Worche after supplantacyon
So high a love for to win
Now fadre if that this be sin
I am al ready to redress
The gylt of which I me confess
My sone as of supplant
The dar not dread tant ne quant
As for no thing that I have herd
But only that thou have mysferd
Thynkend and me lyketh naught
For god beholt a man's thought
And if thou understood in soth
In loves cause what it does
A man to be a supplantour
Thou would for thyn honor
By double way take keep
First for thyn own estate keep
To be thy self so well be thought
That thou supplanted were naught
And eke for worship of thy name
Toward other do the same
And suffer every man have his
But netheles it was and is
That in wait at al assayes
Supplant of love in other ways
The leef full often for the lever
Forsakes and it has done ever
Ensample I find thereupon
Qualiter Agameno^ de amore Brexeide Achille^ and Diomedes de amore Cri seide
Troilum supplanta^ut /

aT Troy how that Agamenon
Supplanted the worthy knight
Achilles for that sweet wyghte
Which named was Brexeyda
And also of Cryseyda
Whom Troylus to love ches
Supplanted has Diomedes
Qualiter Amphitriun socium suam Geta m qui Almaenam peramauit seipsum loco
alterius cautelosa supplanta cione substituit

oF Geta and Amphitryone
That whilome were both as one
Of friendship and company
I read how that supplantarye
In love as it betyd tho
Begyled has one of hem two
That this Geta of whom I mean
To whom the lusty fair Almene
Assured was by wey of love
When the best wend to be above
And sykerest of that he had
Cupido so the cause lad
That while he was out of the weye
Amphytryon in have the next weye
Has take and in this form has wrou
By night unto the chamber sought
Where she lay and within a while
And counterfeted and did do fyle
The voys of Geet in such a wise
That made her of her bed arise
Wenend that it were he
And let him in and when they be
To gyder a bed m arms fast
This Geta came than at at last
Undo the door and said undo
And she ansuerd and bad him goo
And said how that a bed al warm
Her lyef lay naked in her arm
She wend that it were soth
Lo what supplaunt of love does
This Get^ forth beiaped went
And yet ne wist he what it meant
Amphitryon him has supplanted
With sleyghtr of love and her enchau^trd
And thus put every man out other
The ship of love has lost his rother
So that he can no reason stere
And fo: to skepe of this matere
Touchend love and his supplaunt
A tal^ which is acordaunt
Unto thyn ere I think inform
Now harken for this is the form

^F thylk cite cheef of all
Which men ye noble rome call
Er it was set to crystes feith
There was as the Cronyque seyth
An Emperor which it ladde
In pees that he no werres had
There was no thing dysobeysaunt
Which was* to Rome appertenaunt
But al was turned in to rest
To some it thought for the best
To some it thought no thing so
And that was only unto tho
Whose heart stood upon knyghthode
But most of al of his manhood
The worthy sone of the Emperor
Which would ben a werryour
As he that was chyualrous
Of worlds fame and desirous
Bygan his fadre to beseech
That he the werres might seche
In strange marches for to ride
His fadre said he should abide
And would grant him no leave
But he which would not believe
A knight of his which he tryst
Right even as he thought and list
He took and told him his courage
That he purposyth in vyage
If that fortune with him stand
He said how that he would fond
The great see to pass unknow
And there abide for a throw
Upon the werres to t^auayle
And to this point without fail
This knyt when he has herd his lord
Is swore and stant of his acord
And they both young were
So that in preny counseyl there
They ben assented for to wend
And thereupon to make an end
Tresour enough with hem they token
And when the time is best they loken
That sodenlyche in a galey
Fro Rome land they went* their wey
And londed upon that other side
The world fell so that ylke tide
Which ever his happes has diverse
The great Sultan of Perse
Ayene the Calyphe of Egypt
A werre which that him beclypt
Has in a march costeraunt
And he which was a pursyuaunt
Worship of arms to atteyne
This Romayn anon let ordeyne
That he was ready every dele
And when he was arrayed well
Of every thing which him bylongeth
Straut unto Kayre his wey he fong
geth / where he the Sowdan than fond
And axeth that within his land
He might him for the werre serve
As he which wol his thank deserve
The Sultan was right glad with all
And well the more in special
When that he wist he was Romayn
But what he was else incertayn
That might he wit by no wey
And thus the knight of whom I sey
Toward the Sultan he is be left
And in the marches now and eft
Where that the dedely werres were
He wrought such knyghthode there
That every man spak of him good
And thylke time so it stood
This mighty Sultan by his wife
A daughter has that in her life
Men said there was none so feyr
She should be her fadres heyr
And was of years ripe enough
Her beauty many an heart drongh
To bow to that ylke law
Fro which no life may be withdra we
And that is love whose nature
Set life and death in no mesure
Of hem that knyghthode undertake
This lusty pain has overtake
The h^rte of this Romayn so sore
That to knyghthode more and more
Pro wesse auaunteth his courage
Lyche to the Lion in his rage
Fro whom that al bestes fbe
Such was the knight in his degree
Where he was armed in the field
There durst none abide his shield
Great price upon the werres he had
But she which all the chance lad
Fortune shope the marches so
That by thassent of both two
The Sultan and the Calyphe eke
Battle upon a day they seek
Which was in such awey set
That longer should it not be let
They made hem strong on every side
And when it drough toward the tide
That the bataylle should be
The Sultan in great prynete
A goldryng of his daughter took
And made her swear upon a book
And eke upon the gods all
That if fortune so byfalle
In the bataylle that he dye
That she shall thylk man obey
And take him to her housbonde
Which thylk same ryng to hand
Her should bring after his death
This has she swore and forth he geth
With all the power of his land
Unto the marches where he fond
His enemy full enbataylled
The Sultan has the feld assaylled
They that been hardy sone assemblen
Whereof the dredeful hertes tremblen
That one sleeth / that other sterueth
But abouen all his price deserves
The knight Romayn where he rode
His dedely swerd no man abode
Ayene the which was no defense
Egypt fled in his presence
And they of Perse upon the chase
Pursuen but I not what grace
Byfelle on arowe out of a bow
Al suddenly that ylke throw
The Sultan smote and there he lay
The chaas is left for thylke day
And he was bore in a tent
The Souldan syghe how it went
And that he should algate dy^
And to this knyaht of Romanye
As to him he most tryst
His daughter ring anon twyst
He took him and told him all the cas
Upon here oath what token it was
Of that she should ben his wife
When this was said the hertes life
Of this Souldan departed sone
And thereupon as was to done
The deed body well and fair
They carye till they come at Kayre
Where he was worthelyche bygraue
The lords which as wolden save
The regne which was desolate
To bring it in to good estate
A parliament they set anon
Now herkne what fell thereupon
This young lord this worthy knight
Of Rome upon the same night
That they a morrow trete should
Unto his bachyler he told
His counseyll and the ryng with ^lle
He shows through which yt he shall
He seyth the kings daughter wedde
For so the ring was leyd to wedde
He told in to her fadre hand
That with that man that she it fond
She should ^ym took unto her lord
And thus he seyth stant of record
But no man wot who has this ring
This bachyler upon this thing
His ere and his intent l^yde
And thought more than he seyde
And feyneth with a^fals vysage
That he was glad but his courage
Was s^t in another wise
These old philosophr^s wise
They written upon thylk while
That he may best a man begyle
In whom the man has most credence
And this byfelle in euydence
Toward this young lord of Rome
His bachyler which he nome
When that his lord by night slepte
This ryng which his master kept
Out of his purs awere he deed
And put another in the stead
A morrow when the court is set
This young lady was forth fet
To whom the lords done homage
And after that of marriage
They treten and axen of her will
But she which thought to fulfylle
Her fadre hest in this matter
Said openly that men may here
The charge which her fadre bad
Tho was this lord of Rome glad
He droughe toward his purs anon
But al for naught it was a gone
His bachyler has forth draw
And axeth thereupon the law
That she him hold covenant
The tokne was so suffysaunt
That it might not be forsake
And netheles his lord has take
Quarelle ayene his own man
But for no thing that ever he can
He might as than naught be herd
So that his claim is vnansuerd
And he has of his purpos failed
This bachiler was so counsayled
And wedded and of thylk empire
He was crouned lord and sire
And all the land him has received
Whereof his lord which was deceived
A sekenes or the third morrow
Conceived has of dedely sorrow
And as he lay upon his death
There while him lasts speech and breath
He send for the worthyest
Of all the land and eke the best
And told hem all the soth tho
That he was sone and heir also
Of the emperor of great Rome
And how that they to gyder come
This knight and he right as it was
He told hem all the pleyne cas
And for that he his counseyll told
That other all that he would
And he has failed of his mede
And for the good he takes none head
He says but only of the love
Of which he wend have be above
And thereupon by letter write
He does his fadre for to wit
Of all this matter how it stood
And than with an bertely mood
Unto the lords he besought
To tell his lady how he bought
Her love of which another gladeth
And with that word his hew fades
And said a dieu my lady sweet
The life has lost his kyndely hete
And he lay deed as any stone
Whereof was sorry many one
But none of al so as she
This false knight in his degree
Arested was and put in hold
For openly when it was told
Of the treson which is fall
Thorugh out the land they sayden all
If it be soth that men suppose
His own untruth him shall depose
And for to seche an euydence
With honor and great reverence
Whereof they myghten know an end
To the emperor anon they send
The letter which his sone wrote
And when that he the soth wot
To tell his sorrow is endeles
But yet in have netheles
Upon the tale which he herd
His styward in to Perse ferde
With worthy Romans eke
His lyege traitor for to seek
And when they thither come were
This knight him has confessid there
How falsely that he has him bore
Whereof his worthy lord was lore
Tho sayden some he should deye
But yet they have fou^den such a weye
That he shall not be deed in Perse
And thus the skyles be diverse
By cause that he was coroned
Of that the land was habandoned
To him al though it werr unright
There is no pain to him dyght
But to this point and to this end
They grau^ten well yt he shall wend
With the Romans to Rome again
And thus acorded full and plain
The quyk body with the deed
With leave take forth they led
Where that supplaunt has his Iuyse
Whereof that thou the might auyse
Upon this Informacyon
Touchend of supplantacion
That thou my sone do not so
And for to take heed also
What supplau^t does in other halue
There is no man can find a salve
Pleynly to hele such a sore
It has and shall be evermore
When pride is with envy Joint
He suffers no man in good point
Where that may his honor let
And thereupon if I shall set
Ensample in holy church I find
How that supplaunt is not behind
God wot now if that it be so
For in Cronyque of time a go
I find a tale concordable
Of supplaunt which is no fable
In the manner as I shall tell
So as whylome the things fell
I^ ponit Confessor Exemplum contra istos in causa dignitatis adquirende
supplantatores / Et narrat qualiter papa Bonefacius predecessore^ suu^
celestinu^ a papatu contractata circumuencione fraudulenter supplantauit / Sed
qui potentes a sede deponit hu iusmodi suppla^taco^m fraudem non sus tinens

permisit /

aT Rome as it has often fall
The vyker general of all
Of hem yt lyeuen cristes feyth
Ists al which none with seyth
Has shett as to the worlds eye
Whose name if I shall specyfye
He hight Pope Nycholas
And thus that he passed was
The Cardynals that would save
The form of law in the conclaue
Gone for to chese a new pope
And after that they couthe agrope
Has each of hem said his intent
Till at the last they assent
Upon an holy good recluse
Which full was of gostely vertuse
His pacyence and his symplesse
Has set him in to high noblesse
Thus was he pope canonysed
With great honor and intronyced
And upon channce as it is fall
His name Celestyn men call
Which notyfyed was by bulle
To holy church and to the fulle
In all lands magnyfyed
But every worship is enuyed
And that was thylk time sen^
For when this pope of whom I mean
Was chose and other set a side
A Cardynal was thylk tide
Which the papate has long desired
And thereupon gretely has conspyred
But when he syghe fortune is failed
For which long time had trauayled
That ylke fire which Ethna bre^neth
Thorugh his woeful heart renneth
Which is resembled to envy
Whereof Supplaunt and trecherye
Engendered is and netheles
He feyneth love he feyneth pes
Outward he does the reverence
But al within his conseyence
Thorugh falls ymagynacyon
He thought Supplantacyon
And thereupon a wonder wyle
He wrought for at thylke while
It fell so that of his lygnage
He had Clergyon young of age
Whom he had in his chamber affaited
This Cardynal his time has waited
And with his words sly and queynt
The which he couth lyghtely peynt
He shope this clerk of which I tell
Toward the pope for to duelle
So that within his chamber a night
He lay and was a preuy wight
Toward the pope on nyghtes tide
May no man flee that shall be tide
This Cardynal which thought gyle
Upon a day when he had while
This young clerk to him took
And made him swear upon a book
And told him what his will was
And forth with all a Trompe of bras
He has him take and bad him this
That shall he say when time is
Awayte and take right good keep
When that the pope was fast a sleep
And that none other man be ny
And than that thou be so sly
Thorugh out the Trompe in to his ere
Fro heaven as though a voys it were
To sown of such prolacyon
That he his medytacyon
Thereof may make and understand
As though it were gods sonde
And in this wise thou shall sex
That he do thylk estate awey
Of pope in which he stant honored
So shall his soul be socoured
Of thylk worship at the last
In heaven which shall ever last
This clerk when he has herd the form
How ho the pope should inform
Took of the Cardynal his leave
And goth him home till at eve
And pryuely the trompe be hedde
Till that the pope was a bed
And at mydnyght when that he knew
The pope slepte than he blew
Within his Trompe through out yt wall
And told in what manner he shall
His papacye leave and take
His first estate and thus awake
This holy pope has made thryes
Whereof diverse fantasyes
Upon his great holiness
Within his heart he began impresse
The pope full of Innocence
Conceyueth in his conscience
That it is gods will he cese
But in what wise he may relese
His hye estate that wot he naught
And thus within him self he thout
He have it stylle in his memory
Till he came to the Consistorye
And there in presence of hem all
He axeth if it so byfalle
That any pope chief should
How that the law it suffer would
They seten al stylle and herd
Was none which the point ansuerde
For to what purpoos that he meant
There was no man knew his intent
But only he which shope the gyle
This Cardyual the same while
Al openly with wo^des pleyne
Seyth if the pope wol ordeyne
That there be such a law wrought
Than might he chese and else naught
And as he said done it was
The pope anon upon the cas
Of his papal auctoryte
Has made and you the decre
And when the law was confermed
In due form and al affermed
This Innocent which was deceived
His papacye anon has weyued
Reuounced and resygned eke
That other was no thing to seek
But underneath such a iape
He has for him self so shape
That hou as ever it him be seem
The myter with the dyademe
He has thorugh supplantacyon
And in his confyrmacyon
Upon the fortune of his grace
His name is cleped Boneface
Under the vyser of envy
Lo was hyd the trecherye
Which has begyled many one
But such counseyll there may be non
Which treson when it is conspyred
That it nys like the spark fyred
Up in the roof which for a throw
Lies hyd till when yt wyndes blow
It blaseth out on every side
This Boneface which can not hyde
The trecherye of his supplaunt
Has openly made his auannt
How he the papacye has won
But thing which is with wrong be-
gonne / May never stand well at end
Where pride shall the bow bend
He sheteth full often out of the weye
And thus the pope of whom I seye
When that he stood on high the whele
He can not suffer him self be well
Envy which is loueles
And pride which is lawebes
With such tempests made him err
That charity goth out of herre
So that upon mysgouernaunce
Against lowys the king of france
He took quarrel of his oultrage
And said he should done homage
Unto the church bodily
But he that wist no thing why
He should do so great service
After the world in such a wise
Withstood the wrong of that demand
For naught the pope may command
The king wol not the pope obey
This pope tho by all weye
That he may worche of vyolence
Has sent the bulle of his sentence
With cursyng and enterdyt
The king upon this wrongful plyt
To keep his regne fro seruage
Counseyled was of his baronage
That with might it shall be withsto^de
Thus was the cause take on hand
And sayden that the papacye
They honor and magnyfye
In all that ever is spyrytual
But of the pride temporal
Of Boneface in his person
Ayene that ylke wrong allone
They wolden stand in debate
And thus the man and naught the state
The frensshe shopen by her might
To grieve and fell there was a knight
Sire Gwilliam de langaret
Which was upon this cause set
And thereupon he took a route
Of men of arms and rood out
So long and in awayte he lay
That he aspyede upon a day
The pope was at Auynyon
And should ride out of the town
Unto Ponniforge which is
A castle in a prouynce of his
Upon the weye and as he rood
This knight which houed and abood
Embuysshed upon horsbak
Al sodenlyche upon him brak
And has him by the brydel sesed
And said O thou which have dysesed
The court of france be thy wrong
Thou shall sing another song
Thyn enterdyte and thy sentence
Ayene thyn own conseyence
Here afcer thou shall feel and grope
We pleyne naught again the pope
For thylk name is honorable
But thou which have be deceyuable
And trecherours in all thy work
Thou Boneface thou proud clerk
Mysl^der of the papacye
Thy falls body shall abye
And suffer that it has deserved
Lo thus this suppla^tour was served
For they him lad in to france
And setcen him to his penance
Within a toure of hard bonds
Where he for honger both his hondes
Ece of and dyed god wot how
Of whom the writing is yet now
Regystred as a man may here
Which speaks and says in this manner
Thy enter like a fox was slyghe
Thy regne also with pride on high
Was lyche the lion in his rage
But at the last at thy passage
Thy death was to the hounds like
Such is the letter of his Cronyke
Proclaimed in the court of Rome
Whereof the wise ensample nome
And yet as ferforth as I dare
I read af other men beware
And that they look well / algate
That none his own estate translate
Of holy church in no degree
By fra^ude ne by subtylyte
For thylk Aaron which honor took
Shall none receive as seyth the book
But he becleped as he was
What shall I thynken in this cas
Of that I here now a day
I not but he which can and may
By reason both and by nature
The help of every man's cure
To keep Simon fro the fold
Nota de prophecia Ioachim quanti meranarij sunt in ouile dei tuas aures meis
narracionibus fedare nolo

fOr Ioachym thylk abbot told
How such days sholden fall
That comonlyche in places all
The chapmen of such mercery
With fraud and with supplantary
So many sholden bye and selle
That he ne may for shame test
So foul a sin in man's ^re
But god forbede that it so were
In our days that he seyth
For if the clerk be ware his feyth
In chapmanhode in such a feyre
The remenaunt mote needs empeyre
Of all that to the world bylongeth
For when that holy church wrongeth
I not what other thing shall be
And netheles at man's own eye
Envy for to be preferred
Has conscience so dyfferred
That no man looks to the vice
Which is the modre of malice
And that is thylk falls envy
Which causes many a trecherye
For where he may another see
That is more gracious than he /
It shall not stonden in his might
But if he hinder such a wight
And that is well nyghe oueral
This vice is now so general
Qualiter Ioab princeps milicie david Inuidie causa Abner subdole inter fecit.

Envy thylk unhap in drough
When Ioab by deceypt slough
Abnet for dread he should be
With king dauyd such as was he
And ennye also it fell
Of thylk falls Achitofelle
For his counseylle was not ach^ued
But that be saw Cusy byleued
With Absolon and him forsake
He henge him self upon a stake
Senec witnesses openly
How that envy propyrly
Is of the court the common wenche
And halt tavern for to shence
That drink which makes an heart to bre^ne
/ And does the wytt about re^ne
By every wey to compass
How that he might al other pass
As he which thorugh vnkyndeshyp
Enuyeth every falauship
So that thou might well know and see
There is no vice such as he
First toward god abhomynable
And to mankind vuprofytable
And that been worth but a few
I shall by reason prove and show

Hic describit Confessor naturain inuidie tam in amore quam aliter secundum
proprietatem vicij

Envy if that I shall deseryue
He is not shapely for to wyue
In earth among the women here
For there is in him no matere
Whereof he might do plesaunce
First for his heavy contenaunce
Of that he seems ever vnglad
He is not able to be had
And eke he brenneth withynne
That kind may no proufyte win
Whereof he should his love please
For thylk blood which should have ease
To regne among the moist veins
Is dry of thylk unkindly peynes
Thorugh which envy is fyred ay
And thus by reason prove I may
That toward love envy is naught
And other wise if he besought
Upon what side as ever it fall
It is the werst vice of all
Which of him self has most malice
For understand that every vice
Some cause it has whereof it grows
But of envy no man knows
Fro whens he came but out of hell
For thus the wise clerks tell
That no spyryt but of malice
By wey of kind but on a vice
Is tempted and by such a way
Envy has kind put a way
And of malice has his sturyng
Whereof he makes his bakbytyng
And is him self thereof dyseased
So may there be no kind pleased
For ay the more that he enuyeth
The more ayene him self he plenyeth
Thus stant enuyt in good espeyr
To ben him self the deuels heyr
As he which is the next lyche
And forthest from the heaven rich
For there he may never wone
For thy my good dear sone
If thou would find a syker weye
To lone put envy aweye
Mine holy fadre reason would
That I this vice esche we should
But yet to strength my courage
If that ye would in advantage
Thereof set a recouere
It were to me a great desire
That I this vice might flee
Now understand my sone and see
There is physyk for the seek
And virtues for the vices eke
Who that the vices would esche we
He mote by reason than sewe
The virtues for by thylk weye
He may the vices done aweye
For they to gydre may not duelle
For as the water of a well
Of fire abateth the malice
Right so virtue fordoth the vice
Ayene envy is charity
Which i^ the modre of pity
That makes a man's heart tender
That it may no malice engendre
In him that is incline therein
For his courage is tempred so
That though he might him self releue
Yet would he not another grieve
But rather for to do plesaunce
He bears him self the greuaunce
So feign he would another case
Whereof my sone for thyn ease
Now ^ t^ne a tale which I read
And understand it well I read
hIc ponit Confossor Exemplum de virtute cartatis centra Inuidi am / Et narrat
de Constantino E lene filio suo qiu cum Imperij Romani dig nitatem obtinuerat a
morbo lepre in ^fectus medici pro sanitate recuperanda ipsum in sanguine^
puerorum moseulorum balneare prepe suerant / sed cum in numera multitudo matrum
cum filijs huiusmodi medicine causa in circuitu palacij affuisset / Imperator
que little gemitus and clamores percepisset caritate motus ingemiscens sic agit.
O vere ipse est dominus qui se facit seruum pietatis. Et his dictis statum suum
cuncti potentis medele commuttens sui ipsius morbum pocius quam infancium mor
tem benignus elegit / vnde ipse quo an t^a paganus and lepresus extiterat ex
vnda baptismatis renatus vtrinsque materie ta^ corporis que anime divine
miraculo consecutus est salutem

IMong the books of latin
I find it write of Co^sta^tyn
The worthy emperor of rome
Such infortunes to him come
When he was in his lusty age
The lepre caught in his vysage
And so forth over al about
That he might not ryden out
So left he both shield and spear
As he that might him not bestere
And hold him in his chamber close
Thorugh all the world the fame arose
The great clerks ben assent
And come at his commaaundement
To trete upon this lords hele
So long they to geder dele
That they upon this medycyne
Appoynten hem and determyne
That in the manner as it stood
They would him bathe in childs blood
Within seven year age
For as they sayen that should a suage
The lepre and all the vyolence
Which that they knew of accidence
And not by wey of kind is fall
And thereto they acorden all
As for fynal conclusyon
And tolden her oppynyon
To the emperor and he anon
His counseyl took and therupone
With letters and with seals out
They send in every land about
The young children for to seche
Whoos blood they said should be leche
For themperours maladye
There was enough to weep and cry
Among the modres when they herd
How woefully this cause ferd
But netheles they mote bow
And thus women there come ynowe
With children soukend on their tete
There were many teres let
But were hem lyef or were hem loathe
The women and the children both
In to the paleys forth be brought
With many a sorry hertes thought
Of hem which of her body bore
The children had and so forlore
Within a while should see
The modres weep in her degree
And many of hem a swoune fall
The young babyes cryeden all
This noise arose this lord it herd
And looked out and how it ferde
He saw and as who said abrayd
Out of his sleep and thus he said
O thou dyuyne purueaunce
Which every man in the balaunce
Of kind have formed to be lyche
The pore is bore as is the rich
And dies in the same wise
Upon the fool upon the wise
Seken esse and hele enter comune
May not eschew that fortune
Which kind has in her law set
Her strength and beauty ben set
To every man a lyche fre
That she profereth no degree
As in the dysposycyon
Of bodily complexyon
And eke of soul reasonable
The pore child is bore as able
To virtue as the kings sone
For every man his own wone
After the lust of his assaye
The vice or / virtue chief may
Thus stand al men fraunchysed
But in estate they be devised
To sum worship and richesse
To some pouerte and dystresse
One lordeth another serves
But yet as every man deserves
The world yeueth not his yeftes here
But certes he has great matere
To be of good condycyon
Which has in his subiectyon
The men that been of his semblaunce
And eke he took a remembrance
How that he made law of kind
Would every man to law bind
And bad a man such as he would
Toward him self right such he should
Toward another done also
And thus this worthy lord al tho
Set in balaunce his own estate
And with him self stood in debate
And thought how it was not good
To see so mochel man's blood
Be spylt by cause of him alone
He saw also the great moan
Of that the moders were vnglade
And of the woe the children made
Whereof that his heart tendreth
And such pity within engenders
And that him was lever for to chese
His own body for to lose
Than see so great a mordre wrought
Upon the blood which gylteth naught
Thus for the pity which he took
Al other leches he forsook
And put him out of adventure
Al only in to gods cure
And says who that wol master be
He mote be servant to pity
So ferforth he was overcome
With charity that he has nome
His counseyll and his officers
And bad unto his tresorers
That they his tresour al about
Depart among the pouer route
And of wymmen and of children both
Whereof they might hem feed and clothe
And sothly borne home again
Without loss of any greyne
Thorugh charity thus he dyspendeth
His / good whereof he amendeth
The pouer people and countreuayleth
The harm that he hem so trauayleth
And thus the woeful nyghtes sorrow
To joy is turned on the morrow
Al was thankyng a^l was blyssyng
Which erst was weeping and cursyng
These women gone home glad enough
Echone of joy on other lough
And preyd for this lords hele
Which has relesed the quarele
And has his own will forsake
In charity for gods sake
But now here after thou shall here
What god has wrout in this matere
As he that does al equity
To him that wrought charity
He was ayeneward charytous
And to pity he was pytous
For it was never know yet
That charity geth vnaquit
The night when he was leyd to sleep
The high god which would him keep
Saint peter and saint Poule him send
By whom he would his lepre amend
They two to him slepend appear
Fro god and said in this manner
O Constantyn for thou have served
Pity thou have pity deserved
For thy thou shall such pity have
That god thorugh pity wol the sane
Thou shall so double hele find
For the first bodelyche kind
and for thy woeful soul also
Thou shall be hole of both two
And for thou shall not the despeyre
Thy lepre shall no more empeyre
Till thou wylt send thereupon
Unto the mount of Celyon
Where Syluestre and his clergy
To gyder duellen in company
For dread of the which many a day
Have ben a foo to Crystes lay
And have destroyed to mochel shame
The prechours of his holy name
But now thou have somdele appesed
Thy god and with good deed plesed
That thou thy pity have bywaryd
Upon the blood which you have spared
For thy to thy salvation
Thou shall have Informacyon
Such as Syluestre shall the teache
The needs of none other leche
This Emperor which all this herd
Grant mercy lord he ansuerd
I wol do as ye me say
But of one thing I would pray
What shall I tell unto Syluestre
Of your name or of your estre
And they him told what they hight
And forth with all out offhis sight
They passen up in to the heaven
And he awoke out of his sweuen
And clepeth and men come anon
And told his dreme and therupone
In such a wise as hem tells
The mount where Syluestre duelleth
They have in all have sought
And fou^de^ he was and with hem brout
To the emperor which to them told
His sweuen and else that he would
And when Siluestre has herd ye king
He was right ioyeful of that thyng^
And him bygan with all his wit
To techen upon holy wryt
First how mankind was for^ore
And how the hyghe'god therefore
His sone send from above
Which born was for man's love
And after of his own choys
He took his death upon the / croys
And how in g^raue he was byloke
And how that he has hell broke
And took hem out yt were him lyeue
And for to make us full / byloue
That he was very gods sone
Ayene the kind of man's wone
Fro death he rose the third day
And when he would as he well may
He styghe up to his fadres euene
With flesh and blood in to the heuene
And right so in the same form
In flesh and blood he shall reform
When time comes the quyk and deed
At thylk woeful day of dread
Where every man shall take his dome
As well the master as the groom
The mighty kings retenue
That day may stand of no value
With worldly strength to defend
For every man mote than entende
To stand upon his own deeds
And leave as other men's needs
That day may no counseyl avail
The pledour and the ple shall fail
The sentence of that ylke day
May none appele set in delay
There may no gold the Judge plye
That he ne shall the soth try
And fetten every man up right
As well the plow man as the knight
The lewd man the great clerk
Shall stand upon his own werk
And such as he is fonnde tho
Such shall he be for euermo
There may no peyue be relesed
There may no Joy be encresed
But endeles as they have do ^
He shall receive one of the two
Thus Syluester with his saw
The ground of all the new law
With great devotion he precheth
Fro point to point and techeth
Unto this he then Emperor
And says the high creator
Has under fonge his charity
Of that he wrought such pity
When he the children had no hand
Thus when this lord has understood
Of all this thing how that it ferde
Unto Syluestre he than ansuerde
With all his hool heart and seyth
That he is ready to the feyth
And so the vessel which for blood
Was made Syluestre there it stood
With clean water of the well
In all have he let do fell
And set Constantyn therynne
Al naked up in to the chynne
And in the while it was begone
A light as though it were a son
Fro heaven in to the place come
Where that he took his crystendome
And ever among the holy tales
Like as they weren fysshes scales
They fellen from him now and efte
Till that there was no thing be left
Of al his great maladye
For he that would him puryfye
The high god has made him clean
So that there left no thing seen
He has him cleused both two
The body and the soul also
Tho knew this Emperor in deed
That Crystes feyth was for to dread
And send anon his lettres out
And let do cryen al about
Upon pain of death that no man weyue
That he baptysme ne receive
After his mother queen Eleyne
He send and so between hem tweyne
They treten that the Cite al
Was Crystned and she forth with all
This Emperor which hele has found
Within Rome anon let found
Two chirches which he did make
For Peter and for poule sake
Of whom he had a vysyon
And yaf thereto possession
Of lordship and of worldly good
But how so that his will was good
Toward the pope and his Franchyse
Yet has it proved other wise
To see the worchyng of the deed
For in Cronyque thus I read
Anon as he has made the yefte
A voys was herd on high the left
Of which al Rome was adrad
And said this day venym is shad
In holy church of temporal
Which medleth with the spyrytal
And how it stant of that degree
Yet may a man the soth see
God may amend it when he will
I can thereto none other skylle
But for to go ther^ I bygan
How charity may help a man
To both worlds I have said
And if thou have an ere laid
My sone thou might understand
If charity be take on hand*
^here follows after mochel grace
For thy if that thou wolt purchase
How that thou envy fle
Acqueynte the with charity
Which is the virtue sovereign
My fadre I shall do my pain
For this e^sample which ye told
With all mine heart I have withold
So that I shall for evermore
Eschew envy well the more
And that I have or this mysdo
Ye^e me my penance or I go
And over that to my matere
Of shryfte while ye sytten here
In pryuete between us tweye
Now axe what there is I preye
Confessor
My good sone and for thy lore
I wol the tell what is more
Thou shall so the vices know
For when they be to the full know
Thou myt hem well the better eschew
And for this cause I think sewe
The form both and the matere
As now sewend thou shall here
Which vice stant next after this
And when thou wost what it is
As thou shall here me deuyse
Thou might thy self the better auyse

IF thou the vices lest know /
My sone it has not be unknow
Fro first that men their swerdes ground
That there is none upon ye ground.
A vice foreyn fro ye law
Whereof that many a good felawe
Has be dystraught by sodeyn chau^^^
And yet to kind no plesaunce
It does but where he most acheueth
His pur^^os most to kind he greueth
As he which outr of conscience
Is enemy unto pacyence
And is by name one of the seuene
Which often has set the world vneuent
And cleped is the cruel Ire
Whoos heart is evermore on fire
To speak amys and to do both
For his servants ben ever wroth
My good fadre tell me this
What thing is Ire. Sone it is
That in our English wrath is hot
Which has his words ay so hot
That al a man's pacyence
Is fyred of the vyolence
For he with him has ever five
Servants that helpen him to seryue
The first of hem Melancolye
Is cleped which m company
An honderd times in an our
Wol as an angry best loure
And no man wot the cause why
My sone shryue the now for thy
Have thou be malencolyen
My fadre ye by saint Iulyen
But I untrue words use
I may me not thereof excuse
And al makes love well I wot
Of which mine heart is ever hot
So that I brenne as does a glede
For wrath that I may not speed
And thus full often a day for naught
Sauf onlyche of mine own thought
I am so with my seluen wroth
That how so that the game gothe
With other men I can not glade
But I am well the more vnglade
For that is other men's game
It torneth me to pure grame
Thus am I with my self oppressed
Of thought which I have impressed
That al wakyng I dreme and mete
That I with her alone mete
And prayed* her of some good ansuere
But the wol not gladly swear
She seyth me nay withouten oath
And thus wax I within wroth
That outward I am al affrayed
And so dystempered and so es^^ayed
A thousand times on a day
There sowneth in mine eres nay
The which she said me to fore
Thus be my wits as forlore
And namely when I begin
To rekne with my self within
How many years ben agone
Sith I have truly loved one
And never took of her head
And ever a lyche for to speed
I am the more fool with her dele
So that my hap and al my hele
Me thinks is ay the longer the far
That brings my gladship out of err
Whereof my wits ben empryred
And I as who says al dispeyred
For finally when that I muse
And thynk how she wol me refuse
I a^ with anger so bestad
For all this world might I be glad
And for the while that it lasts
Al up so down my joy it casts
And ^y the forther that I be
When I ne may my lady se
The more I am ready to wrath
That fo: the touching of a lathe
Or for the tornyng of a sere
I wode as does the wild see
And am so melancolyous
That there nys servant in mine house
Ne none of tho that be about
That each of hem ne stant in doubt
And wene that I would rave
For anger that they see me have
And so they wondre more and less
That they seen it ouerpasse*
But fadre if it so betyde
That I approach at any tide
The place where my lady is
And than her lyketh I wys
To speak a goodly word vntome
For all the gold that is in Rome
Ne couth I after that be wroth
But al mine anger over goth
So glad I am of the presence
Of her that I al offense
Foryete as though it were naught
So over glad is my thought
And* netheles the soth to tell
A ^ene word if it so byfelle
That I at thylk time syghe
On me that she myscast her eye
Or that she list naught to look
And I thereof good head took
Anon in to my first estate
I torn and am with that also mate
That ever it asyche wycke
And thus mine hond again the prycke
I hurt and have do many a day
And go so forth as I goo may
Fulofte bytyng on my lyppe
And make unto my self a whyppe
With which in many a chele and he^^
My woeful heart is so to beat
That al my wits ben vnsofte
And am wroth I not how often
And al it is melancolye
Which grows on the fantasye
Of love that me wol not loute
So bear I forth an angry sno wte
Full many times in a year
But fadre now ye sytten here
In loves stead I you byseche
That some ensample ye me teache
Whereof I may my self appese
Confessor
My Sone for thyn hertes ese
I shall fulfylle thy prayer
So that thou might the better ler^
What meschyef that this vice stereth
Which in his anger not forbereth
Whereof that after him for thinks
When he is sobre that him thinks
Upon the folly of his deed
And of this point a tale I read
Hic ponit Confessor Exemplum co^tra istos qcu^ vires amoris no^ su^t realiter
experti contra al^os amantes malen ^ol^^^ s^ueritate ad iracundiam vindicte
prouocantur / Et narrat qualiter rex Eolus filium nomine Marcharium and Filiam
nomine can^^^m habuit / qui cum ab infanci^ ^sque pubertatem inui cem* fuerant
educati / Cnpi^o cum ignito iaculo amborum cordis desideria amo rose penetrauit
/ I^a que natura Canacis cooperan^^ a fratre suo inpregnata parturit / super
quo pater intollerabilem i^ uentutis concupiscenci^m* ignorans ni miamque

interfeci diiudicauit

^Her was a king which Eolus
Was hot and it befell him thus
That he two children had fair
The sone cheped was Machayre
The daughter Canace hight
By day both and este by night
While they be young of common wone
In cha^mbre they to geder come
And as they should pleyd hem often
Till they be grown up alofte
In the yongthe of lusty age
When kind assaylleth the courage
With love and does him for to low
That he no reason can allow
But halt the laws of nature
For whom that love has under c^re
And he is blind him self ryghtso*
He makes his ^lyent blind also
In such manner as I you tell
As they al day to geder duelle
This brother might not asterte
That he with all his hoole heart
His love upon his suster cast
And so it fell hem at the last
So that this Machayre with Canace
When they were in a preuy place
Cupyde bad hem first to ^rysse
And after she which is maystrysse
In kind and techeth every life
Without law posytyf
Of which she takes no manner charg^e
But keeps her laws al at large
Nature took hem in to lore
And taught hem so that ouermore
She has hem in such a wise da^i^^d
That they were as who says enchau^^ed
And as the blind another ledeth
And till they fall nothing dredeth
Right so they had none insyght
But as a byrd which wol a light
And sees the mete and not the net^e
Which in deceyt of him is set^^
These young folk no peril syghe
But that was lykyng in her eye
In that they fell upon the chance
Where wit has lore his remembrance
So long they to geder assemble
The womb a^^os and she began to tremble
And held her in her chamber cloos
For dread it should be discloos
And come unto her fadre ere
Whereof the sone had also fere
And feynend cause for to ride
For long durst he not abide
In aun^et if men wol seyn
That he his suster has forleyn
For yet she had it not be know
Whose was the child at thylke throw
Machayre goth Canace abyt
The which was not delynerd yet
But right sone after that she was
Now lest and herkne a woeful cas
The soth which may not ben hyd
Was at the last know and kyd
Unto the king how that it stood
And when that he it understood
Anon in to Melenoolye
As though it were a frenesye
He fell as he which no thing couthe
How master full love is yougthe
And for he was to love strange
He would not his heart change
To be benign and favorable
To love but vnmerciable
Between the wawe of wode and wroth
In to his daughter chamber be goth
And saw the child was late bore
Whereof he has his oath swore
That she it shall full sore abye
And she bygan mercy for to cry
Upon her bar^ kn^^s and prayde
And to her fadre thus she said
Have mercy fadre thenke I am
Thy child and of thy blood I came
That I mysdede yongthe it made
And m the flodes bad me wade
Where that I saw no peril tho
But now it has byfalle so
Mercy my fadre do no wreche
And wtth yt word she lost her speech
And fell swounend at his foot
As she for sorrow needs mote
But his* horrible cruelte
That might attempre no py^^
Out of her chamber forth he* went
And fnl of wrath in his intent
And took the counseyl in his heart
That she shall not the death asterte
And he which is Melan^^lyen^
Of pacyence has no lyen^
Whereof he may his wrath restreyne
And in this wild wode pain
When al his reason was vntame
A knight he ^leped by his name
And took him as by wey of sonde
A naked swerd to bear on hand
And said him that he should go
And tell unto his daughter so
In the manner as be him bad
How she that sharp swerdes blad
Receive should and do with all
So that she wo^^ where to she shall
Forth in message goth the knight*
Unto this woeful young wight
This sharp sword to her ^e took
Whereof that al her body quook
For well she wyste what it meant
And that it was to thylke intent
That she her seluen should sle
And to the knight she said ye
Now that I wot my fadres will
That I shall in this wise spylle
I wol^o^eye me there to
And as he wol it shall ^e ^^
But now this thing* may be none other /
I wol a letter unto my brother
So as my feeble hand may write
With all my woeful heart endyte
She took a pen on hand tho
Fro point to point and all the woe
As ferforth as her self it wot
Unto her dedely friend she wrote
And told how that her fadre grace
She might for no thing purchase
And over that as thou shall here
She wrote and said in this manner
O thou my sorrow and my gladness
O thou my hele and my sickness
O thou my wanhope and my trust
O thou my dysese and al my lust
O thou my well O thou my woo
O thou my friend O thou my foo
O thou my lone O thou my hate
For the more I be deed algate
Thylk death may I not asterte
And with all mine hole heart
Whyst that me lasts any birth
I wol the love in to my death
But of oo thing I shall the preye
If that my little son deye
^ete him be buried in my grave
Beside me so shall thou have
Upon us both remembrance
For thus it stondeth of my grenaunce
Now at this time as thou shall wite
With (...) and with ynke write
This letter I have in car^^ cold
In my right hond my pen I hold
And in my left my swerd I keep
And in my barme there lies to weep
Thy child and mine which sobbeth fast
Now am I come unto my last
Fare well for I shall sone dye
And think how I thy love abye
The pomel of the swerd to gronnd
She set and with the point a wound
Thorugh out her heart anon she made
And fo^th with that al pale and fade
She fell down deed fro there she stood
The child lay bathend in her blood
Out rolled fro the modre barme
And for the blood was h^te and warm
He basked him about therein
There was no bote for to win
For which he ^an no pity know
The king came in the same throw
And saw how that his daughter dyed
And how this baby al blody cried
But all that might him not suffyse
That he ne bad to do ^uyse
Upon the child and bear him out
And seche in the fo^^st about
So in wild place that it were
To cast him out of hand there
So that some best him may deuou^^
Where as no man him shall socoure
All that he ^ad was done in deed
A who herd ever sing o^ read
Of such a thing as tho was done
But he which lad his wrath s^ne
Has know of love but a lyte
But for all that he was to wit
Thorugh his sodeyn melanoolye
To do so great a felonye
For thy my sone how so it stond
By this caas thou might vnderston^
That if thou ever in cause of love
Shall dem^ and thou be so above
That thou might led it at thy will
Let never thorugh thy wrath spylle
Which enery kind should save
For it sit every man to have
Reward to love and to his might
Against whose streugthe may no wight
And sith an heart is so streyned
That reddour ought to be restreyned
To him that may bet aweye
When he mote to nature obey
For it is said thus oueral
That needs mote that needs shall
Of that a life does after kind
Whereof he may no bote find*
That nature bath set in her law
There may no ma^s might withdraw
And who that wor^heth there ayen^
Full oftyme it has ^e seyne
There has byfalle great vengeance
Whereof I find a remembrance
h Ic narrat qualiter Tiresias in quodam mo^te duos serpents in uenit parite^
commiscentes quos cum virga percussit* ^^ati dij ob hoc quam naturam imped^uit
ipsum contra naturam forma virili in muliebrem transm^tarunt

oVyde after the time tho
Told ensample and said so
How that whilom Tiresias
As he was walkend goth par cas
Upon an high Mounteyn he syghe
Two serpents in his weye nyghe
And they so as nature hem taught
Assembled were and he tho caught
A yerde which he bare on hand
And thought that he would fond
To letten hem and smote hem both
Whereof the gods weren wroth
And for he has dystourbed kind
And was so to nature unkind
Vnkyndelyche he was transformed
That he which erst a man was formed
In to a woman was for shape
That was to him an angry iape
But for that he with angyr wrought
His angyr angerlyche he bought
Lo thus my sone Ouyde has write
Whereof thou might by reason wit
More is a man than such a best
So might it never ben honest
A man to wrathen him to sore
Of that another does the lore
Of kind of which is no maly^^
But only this is a vy^^
And though a man be reasonable
Yet after kind he is m^uable
To love where he wol or none
Think thou my sone therupone
And do melanoolye aweye
For love has his lust to pleye
A^ he which would no life grieve
Amans
My f^dre that I may well believe
And that ye tell it is skylle
Let every man love as he will
Be so it be not my lady
For I shall not be wroth there by
But that I wrath and fare amys
Alone upon my self it is
That with both love and kind
I am so bestad that I can find
No wey how it may asterte
Which stant upon mine own hert^
And touches to none other life
Sauf only to that sweet wife
For whom but if it be amended
My glad / days ben dispended
That I my self shall not forbere
The wrath which I now bear
For there is none other lyche
Nowa^e forth I you byseche
Of wrath if there ought e^^es is
Whereof to shryue Sone yis
^ ^a mouet ^^tem que lingue frena resoluens / Laxa per infam^s ^^rrit vbiquam
vias / Rixarum nutrix quo^ educat ista loquaces / Hos venus a latere linquit
habere vagos / Sed pacient^r agens taciturno qui delet ore / Vincit and optati
carpit amoris iter /

hIc tractat Confessor super secunda specie ^re / que Lis dicitur / (...) cuius
comtumefijs innumerosa do^oru^ occasio tam in ainoris causa ^m^ a^^ter in
quampluribus sepissime exorta est

oF wrath. the second is cheste
Which has the wyndes of tempest
To keep and many a sodeyne blast
He blows whereof ben aghast
That they that desire pees and rest
He is that ylke vngoodlyeste
Which many a lusty has twynned
For ever he bears his mouth vnpynned!
So that his lyppes ben vnloke
And his courage is al to broke
That every thing which he couth tell
It spryngeth up as death a well
Which may no man of his stumes hide
But renneth ou^^ on every side
So boylen up the foul sawes
That chest wot of his felawes
For as a Syue keeps Ale
Right so can chest keep a tale
All that he wot he wol dys^lose
And speak or any man oppose
As a cite without wall
Where men may go out oueralle
Without any resystence
So with his crooked eloquence
He speaks all that he wot withynne
Whereof men lose more than win
For oftyme of his chydyng
He brings to house such tydyng
That makes werre at beds head
It is the leueyn of the bread
Which soureth all the past about
Men ought well such oue to doubt
For ever his bo we is ready bent
And whom he hit I tell him shent
If he may perce him with his tongue
And e^e so loud his belle is ronge
That of the noise and of the soune
Men feren him in all the Town
Well more than they done of thonder
For that is cause of more wondre
For with ye wyndes which he blows
Full of^^ sith he overthrows
The Cytees and the polycye
That I baue herd the people cry
And echone said in his degree
Ha wykked tongue woo the be
Men sayn that the hard bone
Al though him self have none
A tongue breketh al to pyeces
He has so many sundry spy^^^s
Of vices that I may not well
Desc^yue hem by a thousand dele
But when that he to cheste falls
Full many a wondre thing byfalleth
For he ne can no thing forbere
Now t^lle my sone of thyn ansuere
If it has ever so be^yd
That thou at any time have chyd
Tothard thy love Fader nay
Such chest yet unto this day
Ne made I never god forbede
For er I sing such a creed
I had le^er to be lewed
For than were I al beshrewed
And worthy to be put a bak
With all the sorrow upon my bak
That any man ordeyne couthe
But I spak never yet by mouth
That unto chest might touch
And that I durst right well vouche
Upon her self as for wytnes
For I wot of her gentylnes
That she me would well excuse
That I no such things use
And if it should so betyde
That I algates must chyde
It might not be to my love
For so yet never was I above
For all this wide world to win
That I durst any word begin
By which she might have be amoued
And I of cheste also reproved
But rather if it might her like
The best words would I pyke
Which I couthe in mine heart chese
And serve hem forth instead of chose
For that is helpelyche to defye
And would my words plye
That might wrath in chest auale
With tellyng of my soft tale
Thus dar I make a forward
That never unto my lady ward
Yet spak I word in such a wise
Whereof chest sh^ld arise
Thuo say I not that I full often
N^ have when I spak most soft
Parcas said more than enough
But so well halt no man the plough
That he ne balketh other while
N^ so well can no man affyle
His tongue that sometime in ia^^
Him may some light word ouerscape
And yet ne meneth he no ch^ste
But then I have ay^^ her hest
Full often spoke I am byknowe
That hou my will i^ that ye know
For when my time comes about
That I dar speak and say al out
My long love of which she wot
That never in one alyche hot
Me greueth than al my dysese
I tell and though it ^er dysplese
I speak it forth and naught ne leave
And though it bebesyde her leave
I hope and trow netheles
That I do not ayene the pees
For though I tell her al my thout
She wot well that I chyde naught
Men may the high god byseche
And he wol here a man's speech
And be not wroth of that he seyth
So yeueth it me the more seyth
And makes me hardy s^th to sey
That I dar well the better ^^^y
My lady which a woman is
For though that I tell her yt there is
Of love which me greueth sore
Her ought not be wroth therefore
For I without noise or cry
My playnt make al buxoml^^
To putten al wrath away
Thus dar I say unto this day
Of cheste in ernest or in game
My lady shall no thing blame
But oftyme it has be tyd
That with my seluen I have chid
That no man couthe better chyde
And that been at every tide
When I ^^m to my selue allone
Forthan I made a preuy mon^
And every tale by and by
Which as spoke to my lady
I thenke and p^yse in my balaunce
And draw in to my remembrance
And than if that I find a lak
Of any word that I myspak
Which was to much in any wise
Anone^ my wits I despise
And maste a chydyng in mine heart
That any word me should asterte
Which as I should have holden ynne
And so after I begin
And if there was else ought
To speak and I spak it naught
And if I may seche and find
That any word be l^^t behind
Which I should more have spoke
I would upon my self be wroke
And chyde with my self so
That al my wit is over goo
For no man may his time lord
Recover and thus I am therefore
So over wroth in my thouyht
That I my self chyde al to naught
Thus for to much or for to lyte
Full often I am my self to wit
But all that may me not avail
With cheste though I me travail
But oule on stok and stok on oule
Tho more that a man defoule
Men wot well which has the werse
And so to me nys worth a ^erse
But torneth unto mine ^wne heed
Though that I tell that I were deed
Would ever chyde in such a wife
Of love as I to you deuyse
But fadre ye have al herd
In this manner how I have ferd
Of cheste and of dyssencyon
Give me your absolucyon
Confessor
My sone if thou wystest all That cheste does in specyal
To love and to his welwyllyng
Thou would fleen his knowlechyng
For who that most can speak fair
And learn to be debonayre
Is most acordynge unto love
Fair speech has often brought above
Full many a man as it is know
Which else should have be right low
And failed mochel of / his will
For thy hold thy tongue stylle
And let thy wit thy will r^ste
So that thou fall not in cheste
Which is the sour of great dystasice
And taste in to thy remembrance
If thou might ge^e pacyence
Which is the seche of al offense
As tellen us the old wise
For when naught else may suffyse
By strength ne by man's wit
Then pacyence is over sit
And over comes at the last
But he may nen^^ long sast
Which wol not bow or that he brek^
Take heed sone of that I speak
My fadre of your goodly speech
And of the wit which ye me teache
I thank you with all mine hole heart
For that world shall me never astert
That I ne shall your words hold
Of pacyence as ye me told
As ferforth as mine heart thinks
And of my wrath it me forthynketh
But fadre if ye forth with all
Sum good ensample in specyal
Me wolden tell in some C^^nyste
It should well mine heart like
Of pacyence for to he^^
So that I might in my matere
The more unto my love obey
And putten my dysese aweye
^Ic ponit Confessor exemplum de paciencia in amore contra ^tem habenda / Et
narrat qualiter vxor Socratis ipsum quodam die multis sermonibus ^tigauit / Sed
cum ipse abs^^ ^lla responsione omnia probra pacienter sustulit indignat^ vxor
qm^dam ydriam plenam aque quam in manu tenebat super caput viri sui subito

litis contumeliam sua paciencia deuicit

mY sone a man to bye him pees
Behooves suffer as Socrates
Ensample left which is write
And for thou shall the soth wy^e
Of this ensample that I mean
Al though it be now little seen
Among the men thylk euydence
Yet he was upon pacyence
So set that him self to assay
In thing which myt him most
myspay, Desired and a wykked wife
He wedded which in sorrow and stry^
Against his easee was contrayre
But he spak ever soft and fair
Till it byfelle as it is told
In winter when the day is cold
This wife was fro the well come
Where that a pot with water nome
She has and ^^ought it in to house
And saw how hat there sely spouse
Was set and looked on a book
Nygh to the fire as he which ^^^^
His ease as for a man of age
And she bygan the wood ^^ge
And axeth him what deuel he thoug^^
And bare on hond that him ne ^^^^
What labor she took on hand
And says that such an husbonde
Was to a wife not worth a stre
He said another nay ne ye
But held him stylle and le^e her ^^^^^
As she which may her self not hyde
Bygan within for to swelle
And that brought in fro the well
The water pot she ^ent* a^^f^^
And badde him speak and le al soft
Sat stylle and no word ansuerd
And she was wroth that ^e so ford
And axrth him if he be deed
And all the water on his head
She poured out and bad him wake
But he which wol not forsake
His pacyence than fpa^
And said how he fond no last
In no thing which she had do
For it was winter time the
And winter as by wey of kind
Which stormy is as men may find
First makes the wyndes for to blow
And after that within a throw
He tryneth and the water gates
^ondoth and thus my wife algates
Which is with reason well beseyn
Has made me both wind and wyn
After the season of the year
And than he set him ner the fire
And as he might his clothes dried
That he no more no word ne said
Whereof he gat him somdele rest
For that him thought was for the best
I not of thylk ensample yet
Acordeth with a man's wit
To suffer as Socrates deed
And if it fall in any seed
A man to ^ese so his galle
Him ought among the women all
In loves court by Judgment
The name bear of pacyent
To give ensample to the good
Of pacyence how that it stood
That other men it might know
And sone if thou at any throw
Be tempted against pacyence
Take heed upon this euydence
It shall par was the less grieve
My fadre so as I believe
Of that shall be no manner need
For I wol take so good head
That er I fall in such assay
I think* esche we if that I may
But if there be ought else more
Whereof I might take lore
I pray you so as I dare
Now tell that I may beware
Sum other tale of this matere
Sone it is ever good to lere
Whereof thou might thy word restreyne
Er that thou fall in any pain
For who that no counseyl can hyde
He may not fail of woe beside
Which shall byfalle or he it wy^^
As I find in the books write
hIc ponit Confessor Exemplum quod de alterius lite intromittere cauen du^ est
/ Et narrat qualiter Jupiter cum Iunone super quadam questi one litigabat /
videlicet vtrum vir a^n mulier in amous concupiscencia ferue^cius ardebat super
quo Tiresiam eorum Iudicem constituebant / Et quia ille contra Iunonem in dicte
litis causa sm^a diffiniuit irata ipsorum amborum oculorum lumine claritatis
absque remis sione priuauit

yEt came there never good of seryf
To seche in all a man's life
Though it begin on pure game
Full often it torneth in to grame
And does greuaunce on some side
Whereof the great clerk Ouyde
After the law which was tho
Of Iupyter and of Juno
Makes in his books mention
How they fell at dyssencyon
In manner as it were a boorde
As they bygonne for the word
Among hem self in pryuete
And that was upon this degree
Which of the two more amorous is
Or man or wife / and upon this
They might not acorde in to one
And took a Judge thereupon
Which cleped is Tyresyas
And bad him deem in the caas
And he without auysement
Ayene Juno gaf Judgment
The goddess* upon this ansuere
Was wroth and would not forbere
But took a wey for euermo
The light from both his eyes two
When Jupiter this hurt has seen
Another benefete there ayene
He yafe and such a grace him does
That for he wist he said soth
A soth sayer he was for ever
But yet that other had lever
Have had the lokyng of his eye
Than of his word the prophecye
But how so that the soth meant
Strxfe was the cause of that he hent
So great a pain bodily
My sone be thou ware there by
And hold thy ton^ stylle cloos
For who that has his word dyscloos
Or he wot what they mean
He is full often nyhe his tene
And leseth full many time grace
Where that he would his tha^k purchase
And over this my sone* dear
Of other men if thou might here
In pryuyte what they have wrout
Hold counseyle and dyscouer it naught
For cheste can no counseyl hele
Or be it woe or be it well
And take a tale into thy mind
The which of old ensample I find
hIc ponit Confessor Exemplum centra illos qui in amoris causa al^^^^us
consilium reuelare presumunt Et narrat qualiter quedam auis tunc albissima
nomine Coruus Consilium ^^mine sue Cornide Phebo denudauit / ^onde contigit non
solum ipsam Cor^^dem interfeci / sed et Coruum qui an t^a tamquam my albus fuit
in piceum colorem pro perpetuo transmutari

Phoebus which makes yt days light /
A love he had which tho hit /
Cornide which above hem all
He pleseth but what shall befalle
Of love there is noma^ yt knows
But as fortune her happes through weth
So it byfel upon a chance
A young knight to her acquaintance
And had of her what he would
But a falls byrd which she has hold
And kept in chamber of pu^^ youth
D^scoueryth all that ever he couthe
The birds name was as tho
Coruus which was than also
Well more white than any swan
And he that shrewe all that he can
Of his lady to Phoebus said
And for wrath his swerd out braide
The which Cornyde anon be slough
But after him was woo enough
And took full great repentance
Whereof in token and in remembrance
Of hem which used wicked speech
Upon this byrd he took his wreche
That there he was snow white to fore
Ever afterward cole black therefore
He was transformed as it she weth
And many a man yet him beshre weth
And clepen him in to this day
A Raven yet by whom men may
Take euydence when he cries
That some myshap it* sygnyfyeth
Beware therefore and say the best
If thou wolt be thy self in rest
My good sone as I the read
hIc loquitur super eodem Et nar rat qualiter Laar Nimpha de eo quod Jupiter
Iuturnam adulterauit ^unoni Iouis vxori secretnm reuelauit Quapropter Jupiter
ira commotus lin gua Laaris prius abscisa ipsam post^a in profundum Acherontis
exulem pro perpetuo man^pauit

For in another place I read
Of thylk Nymphe which Laar hight
For she the pryuete by night
How Iupyter lay by Iuturne
Has told / god made ^yr ouertorne
Her tongue he cut and her in to hell
For ever he send there for to duelle
As she that was not worthy here
To ben of love a^ Chamberere
For she no counseyl couthe hele
And such a days be now feel
In loves court as it is said
That let her tongues gone vnteyd
My sone be thou none of tho
To li^ngle and tell tales so
And namely that thou ne chyde
For cheste can no counseyl hyde
For wrath said never well
My fadre soth is every dele
That ye me teache and I wol hold
The reule which I am hold
To* flee the chest as ye me bid
For well is him that never chyd
Now tell me forth if there be more
As touching unto wrathes lore
Demoui^ est odium quasi scrib^ cui dabit ira / M^teriam scripti cordis ad
antra sui / Non laxa^it amor odij que frena restringunt / Nec secreta sui iuris
adire sciuit /

Hic tractat Confessor de tercia specie ire que odium dicitur cuius natura om^s
ire inimicicias ad mentem reduce^s illas vsque ad tempus vindicte velut scriba
demonis in cordis pappiro commemorandas inserit

oF wrath yet there is another
Which is to chest his own brother /
And is by name cleped hate /
That suffceth not within his gate /
That there came other love or pes
For he wol make no reles
Of no debate which is byfalle
Now speak if thou art one of all
That with the vice have be witholde
And ^yet for ought that ye me told
My fadre I not what it is
In good feyth sone I too we yis
My fadre nay but ye me leave
Now lest my sone and thou shall here
Ha^^ is a wrath not shewend
But of loug time gaderend
And duelleth in the heart loken
Till he see time to be wroken
And than he shows his tempest
More sodeyn than the wild best
Which wot no thing what mercy is
My sone art thou known of this
My good fadee as I wene
Now wot I sonidele what ye mean
But I dare saufly make an oath
My lady was me never loath
I wol not swear netheles
That I of hate am gylteles
For when I to my lady plye
Fro day to day and mercy cry
And she no mercy on me leyth
But shrote words to me seyth
Though I my lady love algate
Tho words mote I needs hate
And would they were al dyspent
Or so fer out of land went
That I hereafter should hem not here
And yet love I my lady dear
Thus is there hate as ye may see
Between my lady word and me
The word I hate and her I love
What so shall me betyde of love
But forthermore I wol me shryue
That I have hated al my live
These ianglers which of her envy
Ben ever ready for to lie
For with her falls compassement
Full often they have made me shent
And hyndred me full oftyme
When they no canse wyste ^yme
But onlyche of her own thought
And thus full often have I bought
The lie and drank not of the wyn
I would her hap were such as mine
For how so that I be now shryue
Them ne may I not foryeue
Till that I see them at debate
With love and than mine estate
They myghten by her own deem
And look how well it should hem queme
To hyndre a man that loves sore
And thus I hate hem evermore
Tyf love on hem wol do his wreche
For that I shall al^^cy byseche
Unto the mighty Cupydo
That he so much would do
So as he is of love a god
To smy^^ with the same rod
With which I am of love smyten
So that they might know and wyten
How hyndryng is a woeful pain
To him that love would at^^yn^
Thus ever on hem I wait and hope
Till I may seen hem lepe a lope
And halten on the same sore
Which I do now for evermore
I would than do my might
So for to stonden in her light
That they ne sholden have aweye
To that they wolden put aweye*
I would hem put out of the st^de
Fro love right as they me deed
With that they spoke of me by mouth
So would I do if that I ^^uth
Of hem and this so god me save
Is all the hate that I have
Toward the Ianglers every dele
I would al other ferd well
Thus have I fader said my will
Say forth now for I am stylle
My sone of that thou have me said
I hold me naught fully paid
That thou wolt hat^n any man
To that acorden I ne can
Though he have hyndred to fore
But this I tell the therefore
Thou might upon my benyson
Well haten the condycyon
Of tho Ianglers as thou me toldest
But forthermore if that thou would
Hem hyndre in any other wise
Such ha^^ is ever to despise
For thy my sone I would the read
That thou draw in by frendelyhede
That thou ne might not do by hate
So might thou get love algate
And set the my sone in rest
For thou shall find it for the best
And over this so as I dare
I ^^d^ that thou be right ware
Of other men's ha^^ about
Which every wise man should doubt
For hate is ever upon a wait
And as the fyssher on his bayte
Sleeth when he sees the fysshes fast^
So when he sees time at the last
That he may worche an other woo
Shall no man torn him there fro
That hate nyl his felonye
Fulfylle and feyne company
Yet netheles for fal^ semblaunt
Is toward him of covenant
Witholde so that under both
The preuy wrath can him clothe
That he shall seem a great believe
But ware the well that thou ne love
All that thou see before thyn eye
So as the Gregoys whylome syghe
The book of Troy who so ^^de
There may he fyude ensample in deed

sOne after the destructyon
When troy was al beat down
And slain was ^amus ye king
The gregoys which of all this thing
Ben cause tornen home ageyn
There may no man his hop wythseyn
It has been seen and felt full often
The hard time after the soft
By see forth as they homeward went
A rage of great tempest hem hent
Juno let bend her party bow
The s^y was derk ye wynd began blow
The fyry welken bygan to thonder
As though ye world should al a sonder
From heaven out of the water gates
The reyny storm fell down algates
And al her tacle made vnwelde
That noman might him selfbyheld^
There may men here shipmen cry
That stood in aunter for to dye
He that behind sat to stere
May not the for stern here
The ship arose again the wawes
The lodesman has lost his laws
The sea on beat on every side
They nysten what fortune abide
But setten hem al at gods will
Where he would hem self save or spylle
And thylk time fell thus
There was a king which Namplus
Was hot and he a sone had
At Troy which the gregoys ^ad
As he that was made prince of all
Till that fortune let him fall
His name was palamydes
But thorugh an hate netheles
Of sum of hem his death was cast
And he by treson over cast
His fadee when he herd it tell
He swore if ever his time fell
He would him venge if that he might
And thereto his auowe he hight
And thus this king through preuy
hate / Abode upon a wait algate
For he was not of such empryse
To auengyn him in open wise
The fame which goth wide where
Makes know how yt ye gregois were
Home with all her felaushyp
Fro Troy upon the sea by ship
Namplus when he this understood
And knew the tides of the flood
And saw the wynd blow to the land
A great deceypt anon he fond
Of preuy hate as thou shall here
Whereof I tell all this matere
This king the weder he began behold
And wist well that they moten hold
Her course endelong the march right
And made upon the derk night
Of great shydes and of blokkes
Gre^^ fire again the great rokkes
To show upon the hills high
So that the flete of greece it syghe
So it fell right as he thought
This flete which an haven sought
Tho bright fyres saw a far
And they hem drawn ner and nerre
And wyste well and understood
How all that fire was made for good
To show where men should aryue
And thyderward they hasten blyue
And in semblau^t as men seyn is gyle
And that was proved thylk while
The ship which we^d him self accroche
Droof al to pyeces on the roche
And so deden ten or twelve
There might no man help him selue
For there they wenden death escape
Withouten help her death was shape
Thus they that comen first to fore
Upon the Rokkes ben forlore
But through noise and their cry
The other were al ware thereby
And when they began to row
Tho might they the soth kuowe
That where they wend friends find
They fond friendship al behind
The land was than sone weyued
Where that they hadden be de^eyued
And took hem to the high see
Thereto they sayden all ye
Fro that day forth where they were
Of that they have assayed there
My sone whereof thou might auyse
How fraud stant in many wise
Among hem that gyle think
There is no s^ryueyne with his ynke
Which half the fraud write can
That stant in such a manner man
For thy the wise men ne demen
That things after that they semen
But after that they know and find
The myrrour shows in his kind
As has all the word withynne
And is in sothe no thing withynne
And so fares hate for a throw
Till a man has overthrow
Shall no man know by his chere
Which is auaunt and which is ar^re
For thy my sone think on this
Confessor
My fadre so I wol Iwys
And if there more of wrath be
Now axe for charity
As y^ by your books know
And I the soth shall be know
hIc cohiberr nequit manum and sic spe^ ^ius / Naribus hic populo se timendus

homicidium dicuntur* sed primo de impetuositate specialiter intendit ^^ius

mY sone thou shall understand
That yet to ward wrath stand
Of dedely vices other two
And for to tell her names so
It is conte^^ and homicide
That be to geder on every side
Contake so as the books seyn
Foolhast has to his chamberleyn
Whoos counseyl al unadvised
Is pacyence most despised
Till homycyde with him mete
Fro mercy they be al unmeet
And thus be they the worst of all
Of hem which unto wrath fall
In deed both and eke in thought
For they acompten their wrath nout
But if there be shedyng of blood
And thus lyche a best wode
They known not the good of life
Be so they have other swerd or knyf
Her dedely wrath for to wreke
Of pity list hem not to speak
None other reason they ne song
But that they have mygh^^o strong
But ware him well in other place
Where every man behooves grace
But there I trow it shall him fail
To whom no mercy might avail
But wron ^hten upon Tyranny
That no pity might hem plye
Now tell my sone / my fader what
If thou have be culpable of that
My fadre nay christ me forbede
I speak only for the deed
Of which I was never culpable
With no cause reasonable
But this is not to my matere
Of shryfte why we sytten here
For we be set to shryue of love
As we begone first above
And netheles I am beknowe
That as touchend of loves throw
When my wits over wend
Mine hertes contek has none end
But ever stant upon debate
To great dysese of mine estate
As for the time that it lasts
For when my fortune ouercasteth
Her whele and is to me so strange
And I see she wol not change
Than cast I all the world about
And think how I at home in doubt
Have al my time in vein fpended
And see not how to be amended
But rather for to be empeyred
As he that is well nyhe despeyred
For I ne may no thank deserve
And ever I love and ever I serve
And ever I am a lyche nere
Thus for I stand in such a were
I am as who says out of herre
And thus upon my self I werre
I bring and put out al pees
That I fulofte in such a rees
Am weary of mine own life
So that of contek and of stryf
I am byknowe and have ansuerd
As ye my fadre now have herd
Mine heart is wonderly begone
Which counseyl whereof wyt^e is one
Which has reason in company
I again which stand party
Will which has hope at acord
And thus these bryngen up dyscord
Wit and reason counseylen often
That mine heart should soft
And that I should well renew
And put out of retenue
Or ^lles hold him under foot
For as they seyne if that he mote
His own reule have upon hand
There shall no wit be understand
Of hope and so they tellen this
That over al where that he is
He set the heart in champartye
With wysshyng and with fantasye
And is not tr^we of that he seyth
So that in him there is no feyth
Thus with reason and wit auysed
Is wit and hope al day despised
Reason says that I should leave
To love where there is no leave
To speed and will says ag^yn
That such an heart is to vyleyn
Which dar not leave till that he speed
Lat hope serve at such a need
He seyth eke where an heart sit
Al governed after wit
He has his lives lust for lore
And thus mine heart is al to ^^re
Of such a con^^ck as they make
But yet I may not well forsake
That he nys master of my thought
Or that I speed or speak naught
Thou do my sone against the right
But love is of so great might
His law may no man refuse
So might thou the better excuse
And netheles thou shall be learned
That will should be governed
Of reason more than of kind
Whereof a tale write I find
hIc ponit Co^sessoz Exe^plu^ quod oi^s Impetuosa volu^tas sit discrecionis
moderamine gubernanda / Et narrat qua^^ter Dyogenes qui motus sui ammiracione
subiugauerat Regem alexandrum sub isto facto sibi opponente plenins informauit

a Philosopher whylome men told
That whylome by days old
And Dyogenes than he hight
So old he was that he ne might
The worlds trauayll and for the best
He shope for to take his rest
And duellyth at home in such a wise
That nyhe his house he let deuyse
Endelong up an extre
To set a Tonne in such degree
He it might torn about
Whereof an end was taken out
For therein sytte he should
And torn him self as he would
And take the eyer and see the heuene
And deem of the planetes seuene
As he which couthe much what
And thus full often there he sat
To muse in his philosophye
Sool without company
So that upon a morrow tide
A thing which should so betyde
When he was set where him list
To look upon the son vpryst
Whereof the propyrtees he syghe
It fell there came riding nyghe
King Alysander with a route
And as he cast his eye about
He saw this Tonne and what it meant
He would wit and thither sent
A knight by whom he might know
And he him self that ylke throw
Abode and houeth there stylle
This knight after the kings will
With spore made his horse to gone
And to the Tonne he came anon
Where that he fond a man of age
And to him told the message
Such as ye king him had bid
And axeth within thylk stead
The Tonne stood and what it was
And he which understood the cas
Sat stylle and spak no word again
The knight bad speak and said vyleyne
Thou shall me tell or that I goo
It is thy king which axeth so
My king quod he that were unright
What is he than said the knight
Is he thy man that say I naught
Quod he but as I am bythought
My man's man how that he is
Thou lie falls chorl Iwys
The knyt him said and was ryt wroth
And to the king ayene he goth
And told him how this man ansuerd
The king when he this tale herd
Bad that they should all abide
For he him self would thither ride
And when he came to fore the Tonne
He has this tale thus bygonne
Al heyl he seyth what man art thou
Quod he such one as thou see now
The king which had words wise
His age would not despise
But says fadre I the pray
That thou wolt me the cause say
How that I am thy man's man
Sire king quod he that I can
If thou wylt / yes seyth the king
Quod he this is the soth thing
Sith I first reason understood
And knew that was evil and good
The will which of my body moves
Whose works that the god reproves
I have restreyned ever more
As him that stant under the lore
Of reason whose subject he is
So that he may not do amys
And thus by weye of covenant
Will is my man and my servant
And ever has be and ever shall
And will is thy pryncipal
And the lordship of thy wit
So that thou couthest never yet
Take a day rest of thy labor
But for to be a Conqueroure
Of worlds good which may not last
Thou highest ever a lyche fast
Where thou no reason have to win
Thus thy will is cause of sin
And is thy lord to whom thou seruest
Whereof thou little thank deseruest
The king of yt he thus ansuerd
Was no thing wroth but when he herd
The high words which he said
With gooodly words thus he prayde
That he him would tell his name
I am quod be thylk same
Which men Dyogenes call
Tho was ye king right glad with all
For he had herd often to fore
What man he was so that therefore
He said O wise Dyogene
Now shall thy great wit be seen
For thou shall of my yefte have
What worlds good that you wolt crave
Quod he than houe out of my son
And let it shine in to my Tonne
For thou bynemest me thylk yifte
Which lies not in thy myt to shyfte
None other good of the me needs
The king whom every country dredeth
Lo thus he was informed there
Whereof my sone thou might lere
How that thy will shall not believed
Where it is of no wit releued
And thou have said thy self or this
How there thy will thy master is
Thorugh which thyn hertes thought
within / Is ever of contak to begin
So that it is gretely to dread
That it no homycyde bread
For love is of a wondre kind
And has his wits often blind
That they fro man's reason fall
But when that it is so byfalle
That will shall the courage led
In loves cause it is to dread
Whereof I find ensample write
Which is behouely for to wit
Ic in amoris causa ponit Confess sor Exemplum contra illos qui in sua dampna
nimis accelerantes ex impetuositate ipsos multocie^s offendu^t Et narrat
qualiter Piramus cum ipse Tisbe amicam suam in loco inter eosde^ deputato

festinans eiusdem gladio cuspide sui cordis intima per medium penetrauit

I Read a tale and tell this
The Cite which Semeramis
Enclosed has with wall about
Of worthy folk with many a route
Was inbabyted here and there
Among the which two there were
Abouen al other noble and great
Duellyug tho within a street
So nyghe / to gedre as it was seen
There was no thing hem between
But wow to wow and wall to wall
This one lord has in specyal
A sone a lusty bachyler
In all the Town was none his pyer
That other bad a daughter eke
In all the Town that for to seek
Men wysten none so fair as she
And fell so that it should be
This fair daughter nigh this sone
As they to geder than wone
Cupyde has so the things shape
That they ne might the hand escape
That his fire on hem ne cast
And so it fell at the last
To follow his lore and sewe
Which never man might eschew
And that was love as it is shaped
Which has her hertes ouerthraped
That they by all weyes seche
How that they might win a speech
Her woeful pain for to lysse
Who loves well it may not mysse
And namely when there be two
Of one accord how so it goo
But if that they some weye find
For love is ever of such a kind
And has his folk so well affayted
That how so that it be awayted
There may no man the purpoos let
And thus between hem two set
An hoole upon the wall to make
Thorugh which they have her cou^seil take
/ At al time when they might
This fair Maid Tysbe hight
And he whom she loved hot
Was Piramus by name hot
So long her lesson they recorden
Till at the last they acorden
By nyghtes time for to wend
Alone out from the Towns end
Where was a well under a tree
And who so came first be or she
He should there stylle abide
So it fell by nyghtes tide
This maid which desguysed was
Al pryue^y the soft paas
Goth thurugh ye large town unknow
Till that she came within a throw
Where that she lyked for to duelle
And thylk unhappy fresshe well
Which was also the forest nyghe
Where she cemyng a lion syghe
In the field to take his pray
In have and flees so away
So as fortune should fall
For feer and let her wympyl fall
Nyhe to the well upon therbage
This wild be in his rage
A best which he found there out
Has slain and his blody snowte
When he has eten what he would
To drink of the stremes cold
Come unto the well where he fond
The wympel which out of her hond
Was fall and he has to draw
Be bled about and al for gnawe
And he straught him for to drink
Upon the fresshe wells brynke
And after that out of the plain
He torneth to the wode again
And Tysbe durst not remewe
But as a byrd which were in mewe
Which in a busshe she kept her close
So still that she not arose
Unto her self and playneth ay
And fell while that she there lay
This Pyramus came after sone
Unto the well and by the moon
He fond her wympyl blody there
^am never yet to man's ere
Tydyng ne to man's sight
Meruaylle which so sore a fryght
At man's heart as it tho deed
To him which in the same stead
With many a woeful compleynyng
Bygan his hands for to wring
As he which demeth sykerly
That she be deed and suddenly
His swerd al naked out he breyde
In his fool have and thus he seyde
I am cause of thy felonye
So it is reason that I dye
And she is deed by cause of me
And with that word upon his kne
He fell and / to the gods all
Unto the heuene he began to call
And prayed syn it was done so
That he may not his love as tho
Have in this world that of her grace
He myght^ her have in other place
For here would he not abide
He says as it shall betyde
The pomel of his swerd to ground
He set and to his heart a wound
He made up to the hard hylte
And this wise he him self spylte
With his fool have and death he nam
For she within a while came
Where he lay deed upon a knyf
So woeful yet was never life
As Tysbe was when she him syghe
She might not one word on high
Speak for her heart shette
That of her life no prys she set
But deed swownyng deed there she fell
Till afterward it so byfel
That she out of her trauns awoke
With many a woeful pytous look
Her eye alweye among^ she cast
Upon her love and at the last
She caught breath and said thus
O thou which cleped art venus
Goddess of love and thou Cupyde
Which loves cause haste for to guide
I wot now well that ye be blind
Of thylk unhappy that now I find
Only bitwene my love and me
This Piramus which I here se
Bledyng what has he deserved
For he thyn hest has kept and served
And was young and I both also
Allas why do ye with us so
Yet set our hertes both on fire
And made us such thing desire
Whereof that we no skyl couthe
But thus our fresshe lusty youth
Without joy is al dispended
Which thing may never be amended
For as for me this wol I seye
That me is lever for to deye
Then have after this sorrowful day
And with this word there as he lay
Her love in arms embraseth
Her own death and she purchases
That now she wept and now she kyst
Till at the last or she it wist
So great a sorrow is to her fall
Which ouergoth her wits all
And she which might not asterte
The swerdes point against her heart
She set and fell down thereupon
Whereof that she was deed anon
And thus on a swerd bledende
They were found deed lyggende
Now yt my sone have herd this tale
Beware of thyn own bale
Thou be not cause in thy foolhast
And keep that thou thy wit ne cast
Upon thy thought in adventure
Whereof thy lives forfeture
May fall and if thou have so thought
Tell thy tale and hyde it naught
My fad^e upon loves side
My conscience I wol not hyde
How that for love of pure woe
I have full often be moved so
That my wysshes if I might
A thousand times I you plyght
I had storuen in a day
And thereof I me shryue may
Though love fully me ne slow
My will to deye was ynow
So am I of my will culpable
And if she be not mercyable
Which may me give life and hele
But that her list not with me dele
I wot by whose counseyl it is
And him would I long time or this
And yet I would and ever shall
Sleen and destroy in especyal
The gold of nine kings lands
Ne should him save fro mine hondes
In my power if that he were
But yet him stant at no fere
For naught yt ever I couthe manace
He is the hynderer of my grace
Till he be deed I may not speed
So mote I need taken head
And shape how that he were aweye
If I thereto may find a weye
My sone tell me for thy
Which is that mortal enemy
That thou manacest to be deed
My fadre it is such a quede
That where I come he is to fore
And does so that my cause is lore
What is his name he is danger
Which is my lady counseyler
For I was never yet so slyghe
To come in a place nyghe
Where as she was by night or day
That danger ne was ready ay
With whom for speech ne for mede
Yet might I never of love speed
For ever this find I soth
All that my lady says or does
To me danger shall make an end
And yt makes al my world myswe^de
And ever I ask help but he
May be well cleped Sauns pity
For ay the more I to him bow
The less he wol my tale allow
He has my lady so englewed
She wol not that he be remewed
For ever he hongeth on her seyl
And is so preuy of counseyl
That ever when I have ought bid
I find danger in her stead
And mine ansuere of him I have
But for no mercy that I crave
Of mercy never a point I had
And thus danger my fortune lad
That worse might I never be
And thus between danger and me
I ever werre till he dye
But might I be of such maystrye
That I danger might overcome
With that were al my joy come
Thus would I fond for no sin
Ne yet for all the world to win
If that I might find a sleyght
To lay al my state in weight
I would him for the country deseuer
So that he come ayene ward never
Therefore I wysshe and would fayn
That he were on some wise slain
For while he stant in thyl^ place
Ne get I not my lady grace
Thus hate I dedely thylk vyde
And would he stood in none office
In place where my lady is
For if he do I wol well this
That outher he shall dye or I
Within a while and not for thy
On my lady full of^e I muse
How that she may her self exa^se
For if that I dye in such ^ plyght
Me thinks she might not be quyt
That she ne were an homycyde
And if it should so betyde
As god forbede it should be
By double wey it is pity
For I with all my will and wit
Have give and ever served yet
For when I should in such a wise
In towardyng of my seruyse
Be deed me thinks it were routhe
And ferthermore I tell the truth
She that ever has be well named
Were worthy than to be blamed
And of reason to be appeled
When with one word she myt an heled
A man and suffers him for to deye
A who saw ever such a weye
A who saw ever such a dystresse
Without pity or gentylnesse
Without mercy or womanh^de
That wol so quyte a man his mede
Which has ever be to love true
My good fadre if ye ^^we
Upon my tale tell me now
And I wol stynte and herkne you
My sone attempre thy courage
Fro wrath and let thyn heart assuage
For who so wol him vnderfonge
He may his grace abide long
Or he of love be received
And eke also but if it be weyued
There might mochel thing byfalle
That should make a man to fall
Fro love that ever afterward
Ne durst he soke thyderward
In hard weyes men gone soft
And er they clymbe auyse them often
And men seen al day that rape reweth
And who so wykked ale breweth
Full often he mote the werse drynk
Bettyr it is to flede than synke
Better it is upon the brydel chewe
Than if he fell and ouerthrewe
The horse and stykked in the mire
To cast water in the fire
Better is than brenne up all the hows
The man which is malycyous
And foolhasty full often he falls
And seldom is when love him calls
For thy better is to suffer a throw
Than to be wild and over throw
Suffraunce has ever be the best
To wysen him that secheth rest
And thus if thou wylt love speed
My sone suffer as I the read
What may the mous ayene the ca^
And for thylk cause I ask that
Who may to love make a werre
That he ne has him self the werre
Love axeth pe^s and ever shall
And who that fyghteth most of all
Shall lest conquer of his empryse
For this they tellen that been wise
Wicke is to seryue and have the werse
To hasten / is naught / worth a kerse
Thing that a man may not acheue
That may not well be done at eve
It mote abide till the morrow
Ne have not thine own soro we
My sone and take this in thy wit
He has not lost that well abitte
Ensample that it falls thus
Thou might well take of Piramu^
When he in have his swerd out drough
And on the point him self slough
For love of Tysbe pytously
For he hye wymple fond blody
And wend a best had her slain
Where as him ought be right fayn
For she was sauf right beside
But for he would not abide
This meschyef fell for thy be ware
My sone as I the warn dare
Do now no thing in such a rees
For sufferaunce is the well of pees
Though thou to loves court pursewe
Yet sit it well that thou esche we
That thou the court not ouerhas^
For so thou might thy time wast
But if thine hap thereto shape
It may not help for to rape
Therefore attempt thy courage
Foolhast does none advantage
But if it set a man behind
In cause of love and that I find
By old ensamples thou shall here
Touchend of love in this ma^^re

Saw phoebus hasten him so sore
And for him should haste the more
And yet not sp^den at the last
A dart thorugh out his heart he cast
Which was of gold and al a fire
That made him many fold desire
Of love more than he deed
To Daphne eke in the same stead
A dart of leed he cast and smote
Which was al cold and no thing hot
And thus Phoebus in lou^ brenneth
And in have about renneth
To book if that be might win
Thus was he ever to begin
For ever a wey f^o him she fl^d
So that he never his love sped
And for to make him full believe
That no foolhase might acheue
To get love in such degree
This Daphne in to a laurel tree
Was torued which is ever grene
In tokne as yet it may be seen
That she shall duelle a maiden stylle
And phoebus faylen of his will
By such eusamples as they stand
My sone thou might understand
To basten love is thing in veyn
When that fortune is there ageyn
To take where a man may leave
Good is and else he mote leave
For when a man's happes faylen
There is no have may auaylen
My fadre grant mercy of this
But while I see my lady is
No tree but hold her own form
There may no man so on form
To w^edyr part fortune wend
That I unto my lives end
^e would her serve euermo
My sone sith it is so
I / say no more but in this ^^s
Beware how it with Phoebus was
Naught only upon loves chance
But upon every governance
Which falls unto man's deed
Foolhast is ever for to dread
And that a man good counseyl take
E^ he his purpos undertake
For counseyl put foolhast awey
Now good fadre Iyowprey
That for to wysse the more
Sum good ensample upon this lore
Ye would me tell of that is write
That I the better might wit
How I foolhast sho^d esche we
And the wisdom of counseyl sewe
My sone that thou might inform
Thy pacy^nce upon the form
Of old ensamples as they fell
Now understand what I shall tell

wHen noble Troy was byleyn
And overcome and home ageyn
The gregoys turned from ye siege
The kings fond her own lyege
In many places as men seyde
That hem forsook and dysobeyde
Among the which fell this cas
To Demephon and Athemas
That were kings both two
And both were served so
Here syeges would not hem receive
So that they more algates weyue
To seche land in other place
For there fond they no grace
Whereof they token hem to read
And sough^^n friends at need
And each of hem assures other
To help as to his own brother
To vengen hem of thylk oultrage
And win oyene her heritage
And thus they ride about fast
To geten hem help and at the last
They hadden power suffysaunt
And maden than a covenant
That they should no life save
Ne pressed ne clerk ne lord ne knave
Ne wife ne child of / that they find
Which bears vysage of mankind
So that no life shall be socoured
But with the dedely sword devoured
In such a foolhast here ordinance
They shape for to do vengeance
When this purpos was wist and know
Among their host tho was there blow
Of words many a speech about
Of young men the lusty route
Were of this tale glad enough
There was no care for the plough
As they that were foolhastyf
They ben acorded to the s^ryf
And seyn it may not be to great
To vengen hem of such forfet
Thus says the unwise wild tongue
Of hem that there were young
But Nes^or which was old and hoar
The salve saw to fore the sore
As he that was of counseyl wise
So that anon by his advise
There was a preuy counseyl no^e
The lords be to geder come
This Demephon and Anthemas
Her purpoos tolden as it was
They seten al stylle and herd
Was none but Nestor ansuerde
He bad hem if they would win
They sholden see or they begin
Here end and set her first intent
That they hem after ne repent
And axeth hem this questyon
To what fynal conclusyon
They wolden ^egne kings there
If that no people in ^onde were
And seyth it were a wonder wyerd
To seen a king bycomen an hyerd
Where no life is but only best
^onder the lygeaunce of his heste
For who that is of man no king
The remenauut is as no thing
He seyth eke if he the purpoos hold
To slay the people as they two would
When they it might not restore
Al greece it should abye full sore
To see the wild lestes wone
Where whylome duellyd a man's sone
And for that cause he had hem trete
And stynte of the manaces great
Better is to win by fair speech
He seyth than such a vengeance seche
For when a man is most above
Him needs most to get him love
When Nestor has this tole said
Arene him was no word withsayd
It thought hem al he said well
And thus fortune her dedely wheel
For werre torneth in to pees
But forth they wenten netheles
But when the Countries herd seyn
And how here kings be beseyn
Of such a power as they lad
Was none so told that him nedrad
And for to seche pees and ^ryth
They send and prayed forthwith
So that the kings ben a^^esed
And every man's heart is esed
Al was forye^^ and not recorded
And thus they ^en to geder acorded
The kings were ayene received
And pees was take and wrath weyued
And al thorugh counseyl which was good /
Of him that reason understood
By this ensample sone attempre
Thyn heart and let no will dystempre
Thy wytee and do no thing by might
Which may be do by love and right
Foolhast is cause of mochel woe
For thy my sone do not so
And as touchend of Homycyde
Which touches unto loves side
Fulofte it falls unadvised
Through will which is not well assised
When wit and reason ben awey
And that foolhast is in the wey
Whereof has fall great vengeance
For thy take in to remembrance
To love in such a manner wise
That thou dese^^e no iuyse
For well I wot thou might not let
That thou ne shall thyn heart set
To love where thou wolt or none
But if thy wit be ouergone
So that it torn in to malice
There wot noman of thylk vice
What peril that there may byfalle
Whereof a tale among all
Which is great pity for to here
I thenke for to tellen here
That thou such mordre myt withs^^d
When you the tale have understand
Hic ponit Confessor Exemplum co^ tra illos ob sue concupiscencie desid^riu^

ipse a bello Troiano domi redisset consi^io Egisti quem adulte^^ peramauit
sponsum suum in cubili dormiente^ sub noctis silencio tru^dabat. cuius mor ^em
filius eius Horestes ^un^ ^nioris etatis postea dijs admonitus crudelissi ma

OF roTyr at thylk noble town
Whose fame sta^t yet of renoun
And ever shall to man's ere
The syege last long there
Er that the greeks it might win
While P^^amus Was king withynne
But of the greeks that lain about
Agamenon lad all the route
This thing is known oueral
But yet A think in specyal
To tell my matter thereupon
An what wise Agamenon
Thorugh chance which may not be
werued. Of love untrue was deceived
An old saw is who that is syhe
An place where he may be nyhe
He makes the far leef loath
Of love and thus fulofte it goth*
There while Agamenon bataylleth
To win Troy and it assaylleth
From home and was long time there
Egysius drough his queen nere
And with the leyser which he had
This lady at his will he lad
Clymestre was her right name
She was thereof gretely to blame
To love there it may not last
But fell to meschyef at the last
For when this worthy noble knight
Fro Troy came the first night
That he at home a bed lay
Egistus long or it was day
And this Clymestre had him assent
And weren both of one assent
By treson slough him in his bed
But mordre which may not ben head
Sprung out to every man's ere
Whereof the land was full of fere
Agamenon has by this queen
A Sone / and that was after seue
But yet as than he was of youth
A babe which no reason couthe
And as god would it fell him thus
A worthy knight Taltabeus
This young child had in keeping
And when he herd of this tydyng
Of this treson of this mysdede
He began within him self to dread
An aunter if this false Egiste
upon him come or he it wist
To take mordre of this malice
This child which he has to noryce
And for that cause in all have
Out of the land he began him haste
And to ye king of greece he goth straut
And him this young lord betaught
And prayed him for his fadre sake
That he this child would undertake
And keep him till he be of age
So as he was of his lygnage*
And told him oueral the cas
How that his fadre mordred was
And how egistus as men seyde
Was king to whom the land obeyde
And when Adonemeus the king
Has understanding of this thing
Which that this knyt him had told
He made sorrow manyfolde
And took the child unto his ward
And said he would him keep and ward
Till that he were of such a might
To handle a swerd and be a knight
To wngen him at his own will
And thus Horestes duelleth stylle
Snche was the childs right name
Which after wrought n^ochel shame
An ^^neaunce of his fadre death
The time of yerrs over geth
That he was man of bread and length
Of wit of manhood and of strength
A fair person among all
And he began to clepe and call
As he which come was to man
Unto the king of greece than
Prayend that he would him make
A knight and power with him take
For longer would he not believe
He says but prayth the king of leave
To gone and cleyme his heritage
And venge him of thylk oultrage
Which was unto his fadre do
The king assenteth well thereto
With great honor and knyt him makes /
And great power with him betaketh /
And ga^ his journey for to case
So that Horestes at the last
His love he takes and forth he goth
As he that was in heart wroth
His first pleynt to be mean
Unto the Cite of Athene
He goth him forth and was received
So there he was naught deceived
The dust and ^tho that were wise
They proferen hem to his seruyse
And he them thanketh of their profer
And said him self he wol gone offer
Unto the gods for his speed
And al men give him read
So goth he unto the Temple forth
Of yeftes that be mochel worth
His sacryfyce and his offryng
He made and after his axyng
He was ansuerd if that he would
His estate than recover he sh^ld
Upon his mother do vengeance
So crue^ that the remembrance
Thereof might ever abide
As she that ^as an Homycyde
And of her o^ne lord Mordryce
Horestes which of thylk office
Was no thing glad as than ho prayed
Unto the gods there and said
That they the Augement deuyse
How she shall take the juyse
And thereupon he had ansuere
That he her pappes should of t^re
Out of her breast his own hondes
And for ensample of al lands
With horse she should be to draw
Till honndes had her bones gnawe
Without any sepulture
This was a woeful adventure
And when Horestes has al herd
How that the gods have ansuerd
Forth with the strength which he lad
The dust and his power he had
And to a cite forth they gone
The which was cheped Cropheone
Where as Phoieu^ was lord and sire
Which profereth him withouten hyre
His help and all that he may do
As he that was right glad thert^
To grieve his mortal enemy
And told him certain cause why
How that Egyste in marriage
His daughter whylome of full age
Forlay and afterward forsook
When he Horestes modre took
Men seyne old sin new shame
Thus more and more ^^rose the blame
Ayene Egyst on every side
Horestes with his host to ride
Bygan and Phoieus with him went
Atro we Egyste shall him repent
They ryden forth unto Mycene
There lay Clymestre thylk queen
The which Horestes mother is
And when she herd tell of this
The gates were fast shet
And they were of her^ enter let
Anon this Cite was without
Beleyn and beseged al about
And ever it among assail
Fro day to night and so travail
Till at last they it won
Tho was there enough begone
Horestes did his modre call
Anon tofore the lords all
And eke to fore the people also
To her and told his tale tho
And said O cruel best unkind
Hou myghtest thou thyn heart find
For any lust of loves draught
That thou acordest to the slaught
Of him which was thine own lord
Thy treson stant of such record
Thou might thy works not forsake
So mote I for my f^dre sake
Vengeance upon thy body do
As I commanded am thereto
Unkindly for thou have wrought
Vnkyndelyche it shall be bought
The sone shall the modre sl^e^
For that whylome thou saydest ye
That thou sholdest nay have said
And he with yt hie honde^ has laid
Upon his mode^^ breast anon
And rent out from the bar^ bone
Her pappes both and cast a way
A mids in the cart way
And after took the deed corpse
And le^^ it be draw awey with horse
Unto the hound and to the Raven
She was none otherwise grnuen
Egystus which was else where
Tidings come to his ere
How that Mycenes was byleyn
But what was more herd he not seyn
With great manace and mochel bost
He drough power and made an host
And came in the ^^scous of the Town
But all the sleyghte of this treson
Hoo^stes wist it by a spy^
And of his men a gtr^^ party
He made abusshement abide
To wayde on him in such a tide
That he might her hond escape
And in this wise as he has shape
The thing byfel so that Egyste
Was take or he him self it wyste
And was forth brout his ho^des bo^de
And when men have a treytour found
And tho that were with him take
Which of reason were overtake
To geder in one sentence fall
But fale Egyst above be in all
Was demed in diverse pain
The werst that men couthe ^^deyn^
And so after by the law
He was unto the gybet draw
Where he above all other hongeth
As to a traitor it bylongeth
The fame of her s^^yft wings
About flees and bare tidings
And made it couthe in all lands
How that Horestes with his hondes
Clymest^^ his own modre s^^ugh
Sum seyn he deed well enough
And sum seyn he did amys yuers opinion there is
That she is deed they spesten all
But pleynly how it is byfalle
The matter in so little through we
An soth there might noman know
But they that weren at the deed
And comonlyche at every need
The worst speech is rathest herd
And leued till it be ansuerd
The kings and the lords great
Begone Horestes for to thre^^
To putten him out of his regne
He is not worthy for to regne
The child which slough his mother so
They said and thereupon also
The lords of common assent
The time set of parliament
And to Athenys king and lord
To geder^come of one acord
To know how the sothe was
So that Horestes in this cas
They senden after and they come
King Men ^lay the words nome
And axeth him of this matere
And he that al it might here
Ansuerd and told his tale at large
And how the gods in his charge
Commanded him in such a wise
His own hond to do Iuyse
With this tale a Duk arose
Which was a worthy knight of lose
His name was Menesteus
And said unto the lords thus
The wreche which Horestes deed
At was thing of the gods ^ed^
And no thing of his ocuelte
And if there were of any degree
An all this pla^^ such a knight
That wol seyn it was no right
I wol it with my body prove
And thereupon he cast his glove
And eke this noble duk Alleyde
Full many another skylle he seyde
She had well deserved wreche
First for the cause of spouse breche
And after wrought in such a wise
That all the world it ought agryse
When that she for so foul a vice
Was of her own lord Mordryce
They sytten al stylle and herd
But thereto was noman ansuerde
At ought hem all he said skylle
There is noman wythsey it will
When they upon the reason musen
Horestes all they ^^cusen
So that with great solempnyte
He was unto his dygnyde
Receyned and coroned king
And tho byfel a wondre thing
Egyona when she it wist
Which was the daughter of Egyst
And suster on the modre side
To this Horeste at thyla^ tide
When she herd ho whis brother sped
For pure sorrow which her led
That he had len ^xyled
She bath her own life begyled
Anon and henge her self tho
At has and shall be euermo
To mordre who that wol assente
He may not fail to repent
This false Egyona was one
Which to mordre Agamenone
Yaue her acord and her assent
So that by gods Augement
Though none other man it would
She took her Iuyse as she should
And as she to another wrought
Vengeance upon her self she thought
And has of her unhappy wit
A mordre with a mordre quyt
Such is of mordre the vengeance
For thy my sone in remembrance
Of this ensample take good frede
For who that thinks his love speed
With mordre he shall with worlds shame /
Him self and eke his love shame
My fadre of this adventure
Which ye have told A you assure
Mine herti^ fory for to here
But only for A Bold here
What is to done and what to leave
And over this by your leave
That ye me would tell A pr^y
Af there be leful any weye
Without sin a man to slay
My sone in sundry wise ye
What man that is of Traytorye
Of mordre or else Robberye
Atteynt the Judge shall not bet
But he shall sleen of pure def
And does great syune if that he wo^de
For who that law has upon hand
And spares for to do Justice
For mercy does not his office
That he his mercy so be wareth
When for one shrewe which he spares
A thousand good men he greueth
Which such mercy as who yt bileueth
To please god he is deceyned
Or else more reason be weyued
The law stood or we were bore
How that a kings swerd is bore
An sign that he shall defend
His people and make an end
Of such as wolden hem devour
Lo thus my sone to socoure
The law and common right to win
A man may she without sin
And thereof a great alms
So for to keep right wyseuesse
And over this for this contre
An time of werre a man is fee
Him self his ^ous and eke his land
Defend with his own hond
And slain if that he may no bet
After the law which is set
Now fadre than A you byseche
Of hem that dedely werres seche
An worlds cause and shed^n lobod
Af such an homycyde is good
Confessor
My sone upon thy questyon
The truth of mine oppynyon
Ale ferforth as my wit arecheth
And as the pleyn law techeth
A would the tell in euydence
To reule with thy conscience
Quod creat iyse deus n^eat hoc homicida creatum /
^ltor and humano sanguine s^ git humum /
Vt pecoris sic est hominis cruor heu ho^ fusus /
Victa iacet pietas and furo^ vrget opus /
Angelus in term pax dixit and vltima Cristi.
Verba so nent pacem quam m^ guerra fugat
Hic sequitur contra ^^oto^^s guerre que non solum homicidij sed vniuer se
mnndi desolacionis matter existit

tHe high god of his justice
That ylke foul horrible vice
Of Homycyde he has forbede
By Moses as it was bid
When gods sone also was bore
He sent his Aungel down therefore
Whom the shepeherdes herd sing
^^es to the men of welwyllynge
In earth among us here
So for to speak in this matere
After the law of charity
There shall no daily werre be
And eke nature it has defended
And in her law pees commended
Which is the chyef of man's welthe
Of man's life of man's health
But dedely werre has this couyne
Of pestylence and of famyne
Of pouerte and of al woo
Whereof this world we blamen so
Which now the werre has underfoot
Till god him self thereof do bote
For all thing which god has wrout
In earth werre it brings to naught
The church is brent the pressed is slain
The wife the maid is the forlayn
The law is lord and god unserved
I not what mede he has deserved
That such werres ledeth Inn
If that he do it for to win
First to acompte his great cost
Forth with the folk that he has los^
As to the worlds rekenyng
There shall he find no wynnyng
And if he do it to purchase
The heaven mede of such a grace
I can not speak netheles
Christ has commanded love and pe^^
And who that worcheth the reuers
I trow his mood is full dyuers^
And sythen* that* we find
The werres in her own kind
Ben toward god of no deserte
And eke they bryngen in pouert^
Of worlds good it is merueyle
Among the men what it may eyle
That they us a pees ne conne set
I trow sin be the let
And every mede of sin is death
So wot I never how it geth
But we that be of one believe
Among our self this world I leave
That better it were pees to chese
Than so by double weye lose
I not if that it now so stand
But this a man may understand
Who that these old lokes redeth
That one is Couetyse which ledeth
And brought the first werres inn
At greece if that I shall begin
There was it proved how it stood
To Perse which was full of good
They maden werre in especyal
An^ so they dyden o^eral
Where great richesse was in land
So that they left no thing stond
^n werred but only Archade
Nota quod greci omnem terram de^ellabant fertilem sed tantum Archadia^ pro eo
quam pauper et steri^^s fuit pacifi^^ dimiserunt

For there they no werres made
By cause it was bareyn and pouer
Whereof they might not recover
And thus pouerte was forbore
He yt naught had naught* has lore
But yet it is* a wondre thing
When that a rich worthy king
Or other lord what so he be
Wol axe and claim propyrte
In thing which he has no right
But only of his great might
For this may every man well wit
That both kind and law write
Expressly stand there ageyn
But he mote needs somewhat seyn
Al though* there be no reason ynne
Which seche cause* for to win
For wit that his will oppressed
When couetyse him has redressed
And al reason put awey
He can well find such a wey
To werre where as ever he lyketh
Whereof that he the word entryketh
That many a man of him co^pleyneth
But yet alwey sum cause he feyneth
And of his wrongful heart has demed
That al is well that ever him seemed
Br so he may win enough
For as the true man to the plough
Only to the gaygnage entendeth
Right so the werryour dyspendeth
His time and has no conscience
And in this point for euydence
Of hem that such werres make
Thou might a great ensample take
How they her tyranny excusen
Of that they wrongful werres vsen
And they stand of one acord
The S^udyour forth with the lord
The pour man forth with the rich
As of courage they ben lyche
To make werres and to pyle
For lucre and for none other skyle
Whereof a propyr tale I read
As it whylome byfell in deed
hIc declarat per Exemplum co^tra istos principes seu alios quos cumque
illicite guerre motores / Et narrat de quodam Pirata in parti^us mari nis
spoliatore / qui cum captus fuisset. and in iudicium coram Rege Alexandro
productus and de latricinio accusatus dixit / O Alexandre vere quia cum pau cis
socijs spoliorum causa naues tantu^ exploro*ego latrunculus v^oo^. tu aute^
q^^a cum infinita bellatorum multitu dine vniuersam terram subiugan^o
spoliasti. Imperator diceres / Ita quam sta tus tuus a statu meo differt / sed
eode^ animo condicionem pa^^lem habemus Alexander vero eius audaciam in
responsione comprobans penes se familiarem retinuit / Et sic bellicosus
bellatori compla^^t

oF him all this earth drad
When he the world so ouerlad
Through werre as it fortuned is /
King Alysaunder I read this
How in a march where he lay
It fell par chance upon a day
A Rouer of the sea was nome
Which many a man had overcome
And slain and take her good away
This Pylour as the boks say
A famous man in sundry stead
Was of the works which he deed
This prisoner before the king
Was brought and thereupon this thing
In audyence was he accused
And he his deed has naught excused
And praid the kyng^ to done him ryt
And said Sire if I were of might
I have an heart lyche unto thyn
For if thy power were mine
My will is most in especyal
To ryfle and to get oueral
The large worlds good about
But for I led a pour route
And am as who says at meschyef
The name of Pylour and of thyef I bear /
and thou which Routes great
May led and take thy beyete
And do right as I would do
Thy name is nothing cleped so
But thou art named Emperor
Our deeds ben of one color
And in effect of one deserte
But thy Richesse and my pouerte
They be not taken even lyche
And neth^l^^ he that ^s rich
This day to morrow he may by pour
And in contrary also receuer
A pouer man to great riches
Men seyn for thy ryghtwysenes
Be peyced even in the balaunce
The king his hardy contenaunce
Beheld and his words wise
And said unto him in this wise
Thine ansuere I have understand
Whereof my will ^e that thou stand
In my service and stylle abide
And forth with all the same tide
He has him ^^^me of life witholde
The more and for he shall behold
He made him knight and yaf him land
Which afterward was of his hond
A^ orped knight in many a stead
And great prowess of arms deed
As the Cronyke it recorden
And in this wise they acorden
The which of one ^^ndycy^n
Be set upon destructyon
Such Capytayne such retenue
But for to see what issue
The king befallyth at the last
In his great wondre what men cast
Her ^^^t upon such wrong to win
Where no be^^^e may be Inn
And death dy^^se on every side
But when reason is put a side
And will g^nerneth the courage
The fau^^n with that flees ramage
And suffers no thing in the weye
Whereof that he may take his preye
Is not more set upon rauyne
Than ylk man which his couyne
Has set in such manner wise
For all the world ne may suffyse
To will which is not reasonable
Whereof ensample concordable
Lyche to this point of which I mean
Was upon Alysander seen
Which had set al his intent
So as fortune with him went
That the reason myt him not govern
But of his will he was so stern
That all the world he ouer^an
And what him list he took and wan
In inde the superyour
When that he was full conqueror
And had his wylful purpoos won
Of all this earth under the son
This king homeward to Macedoyne
When that he came to Babyloyne
And wend most in* his empire
As he which was lord and sire
In honor for to be received
Most sodenlyche he was deceived
And with strong poison enuenyn^^d
And as he has the world mystymed
Not as he should with his wit
Not as he would it was acquyt
Thus was he slain yt whylome slongh
And he which rich was enough
This day / to morrow had naught
And in such wise as he was wrout
In dysturbaunce of worlds pees
His werre he fond than endeles
In which for ever dyscomfyte
He was* lo now for what proufyte
Of werre it helps for to ride
For couetyse and worlds pride
To slay the worlds men about
As bestes which gone there out
For any life which reason can
Ought well* to know that a man
Ne should thorugh no tyranny
Lyche to these other bestes dye
Till kind would for him send
I not how he it might amend
Which takes awey for evermore
The life that he may not restore
For thy my sone in all weye
Be well auysed I the preye
Of slaught or that thou be culpable
Without cause reasonable
My fadre understand it is
That ye have said but over this
I pray you tell me nay or ye
To pass oue^ the great see
To werre and slay a Sarayn
Is that the law Sone mine
To preche and suffer for the feyth
That I have herd the gospel seyth
But for to slay that here I naught
Christ with his own death has bought
Al other men and made hem fre
In tokne of parfyte charity
And after that he taught him selue
When he was deed these other twelve
Of his apostles went about
The holy feyth to preche out
Whereof the death in sundry place
They suffer and so god of his grace
The feyth of Christ has made arise
But if they would in other wise
By werre have bought in the creau^ce
It had yet stand in balaunce
And that may prouen in the deed
For what man the Cronykes read
First that holy church has weyued
To preche and has the swerd received
Whereof the werres be begone
A great party of that was won
Of Crystes feyth stant now myswent
God do thereof amendment
So as he wot what is the best
But sone if thou wylt live in rest
Of conscience well assysed
Er that thou slay be well auysed
For man as tellen us the clerks
Has god above al erthely works
Ordained to be pryncypal
And eke of soul in specyal
He is made lyche to the godhede
So sit it well to taken head
And for to look on every side
Er that thou fall in homycyde
Which sin is now so general
That it well nigh stant oueral
In holy church and else where
But all the while it is so there
The wdorl mote need fare amys
For when the* whele of pity is
Thorugh couetyse of worlds good
Defouled with shedyng of blo^d
The remenaunt of folk about
Uneath stonden in any doubt
To werre each other and to slay
So is it al not worth a stre
The charity whereof we prechen
For we do no thing as we techen
And thus the blind conscience
Of pe^^ has lost thylk euydence
Which christ upon the earth taught
Now may me^ see mordre and manslaut
Lyche as is by days old
When men the sins bought and sold
In greece before Crystes feyth
I read as the Cronyke seyth
Touchend af this matter thus
In thylk time how peleus
His own brother Phocus slough
But he had gold enough
To them his sin was dyspensed
With gold whereof it was compensed
Achastus which with Venus was
Her pryest assoylled in that cas
Al were there no repentance
And as the books make remembrance
It tellyth of Med^e also
Of that she slough her sons two
Egeus in the same plyte
Has made her of her sin quyte
The sone eke of Amphyoras
Whose right name Almeus was
His mother slough Eryphele
But Achylo the pressed and he
So as the books it recorden
For certain sum of gold acorden
That thylk horrible synful deed
Assoylled was and thus for mede
Of worlds good it fallyth often
That homycyde is set alofte
Here in this life but after this
There shall be know how that it is
Of hem that such things wyrche
And how also that holy church
Let such sins pass quyte
How they wol hem acquyte
Of dedely werres that they make
For who that would ensample take
The law which is naturel
By weye of kind the weth well
That homycyde in no degree
Which werreth ayene charity
Among men should not duelle
For a foer that the books tell
To s^che in all the world rich
Men shall not find one his lyche
No best that will take his preye
And sith kind has such a weye
Than it is wondre of a man
Which kind has and reason can
That he wol either more or less
His kind and reason ouerpasse
And slay that is to him semblable
So is the man not reasonable
He kind and that is not honest
When he is worse than a best
Nota secundum Solinum contra ho^^iadium de natura cuiusdam aius faci^m ad
similitudinem humanam habentis qiu cum de preda sua hominem myta flauium
occident* vident que in aqua sunile sibi occisum statim pro delo (...) moritur

aMong the books which I find
Solinus speaks of a wo^dre kind
And seith of fowls there is on
Which has a face of bloood and bone
Which to a man in resemblaunce
And if it fall him so par chance
As he which is a foul of pray
That he a man find in his way
He would him slay if that he may
But after ward the same day
When he has eten al his fell
And that shall be beside a well
In which he wol drink take
In which visage he sees the make
That he has slain anon he thinks
Of his mysdede and it forthynketh
So gretely that for pure sorrow
He lives not till on the morrow
By this ensample it may well se we
That men shall homycyde eschew
For ever is mercy good to take
But if the law it has forsake
And that Justice is them again
Fnl oftyme I have herd seyne
Among that werres hadden
That they some while her cause ladden
By mercy when they myt have slain
Whereof that they were after fayn
And sone if that thou wolt record
The virtue of myserycorde
Thou syghe never thylk place
Where it was used lak grace
For every law and every kind
The man's wit to mercy bind
And namely the worthy knights
When they stand most vpryghtes
And ben most mighty for to grieve
They sholden then most releue
Him whom they myten overthrow
As by ensample may men know
Hic ponit Confessor Exemplum de pietate contra homicidium / Et narrat qualiter
Achilles vna cum Thephalo filio suo contra Regem Mesee qui tunc Theucer
vocabatur bellum inicrunt / Et cum Achilles dietum Regem in bello prostratum
occidere voluisset / Thephalus pietate motus ipsum Clipeo cooperiens veniam pro
Rege a patre postulauit, pro quo facto ipse Rex adhuc viuens Thephalum Regni
sui heredem libera volu^tate constituit

hE may not faylen of his mede
That has mercy for this I read,
In a Cronyke I find thus
When Achilles with Telaphus
His sone to ward Troy were
It fell hem or they come there
Ayene Thoucer the king of mese
To make war and for to lose
His land as they that would regne
And Theucer pnt out of his regne
Thus the marches they assaylle
But Theucer yaf to hem bata ylle
They foughten on both sides fast
But so happeth at the last
This worthy greek Achilles
The king among al other ches
As he that was cruel and fell
With swerd on hond on him he fell
And smote him with a dethes wound
That he vnhorced fell to ground
Achilles upon him alyght
And would anon as he well might
Have slain him in the place
But Thephalus his fadre grace
For him besought and for pity
Prayth that he would late him be
And cast his sheld between hem two
Achilles axeth him why so
And Thephalus his cause told
And seyth that he is mochel hold
For whylome Theucer in a stead
Great grace and socour to him deed
And says that he him would acquyte
And prayth his fadre to respyte
Achilles tho withdrough his hond
But all the power of the land
When yt they saw her king thus take
They fled and has the f^ld forsake
The greeks unto the chaas fall
And for the most part all
Of that country the lords great
They took and won a great beyete
And anon after this vyctorye
The king which had memory
Upon the great mercy thought
Which the laphus toward him wrout
And in presence of all the land
He took him fair by the hand
And in this wise he began to seye
My sone I mote by double weye
Love and desire thyn encrees
First for thy fadre Achilles
Whylome full many a day or this
When I should fare amys
Rescouse did in my quarele
And kept al mine estate in hele
How so there fall now dystaunce
Among us yet remembrance
I have of mercy which he deed
Than* and thou now in this stead
Of gentylnes and of fraunchesse
Have do mercy the same I guess
So wol I not that any time
Be lost of that thou have do byme
For how so this fortune fall
Yet stant my trust abouen all
For the mercy which I now find
That thou wolt after this ^e kind
And for that such is mine espeyr
And for my sone and for mine he ire
I the receive and al my land
I give and sese in to thyn hand
And in this wise they accord
The cause was myserycorde
The lords do her obeysaunce
To Thelaphus and purueaunce
Was made so that he was coroned
And thus was mercy reguerdoned
Which he to Theucer did to fore
Loo this ensample is made therefore
That thou might take remembrance
My sone and when thou see a chance
Of other men's passion
Take pity and compassyon
And let no thing to the be leef
Which to another man is greef
And after this if thou desire
To stand ayene the vice of Ire
Counseyl the with pacyence
And take in to thy conscience
Mercy to be thy governor
So shall thou^fynde no rancour
Whereof thyn heart shall debate
With homycyde ne with hate
For cheste or melancolye
Thou shall be soft in company
Without conteck or foolhast
For else / might thou long wast
Thy time or that thou have thy will
Of love for the wedyr stylle
Men preyse and blame the tempests
My fadre I wol do your hestes
And of this point ye have me taut
Toward my self the better saught
I thenke bewail while that I line
But for as much as I am shryne
Of wrath and al his circumstaunce
Give that ye list to my penance
And axe forther of my life
If other wise I be gyltyf
Of any thing that touches sin
My sone or we depart a twynne
I shall behind no thing leave
Amans
My good fadre with your leave
Than axe forth what you list
For I have in you such tryste
As ye that be my soul hele
That ye fro me nothing wol hele
For I shall tell you the truth
My sone art thou culpable of slouthe
In any point which to him longs
My fadre of tho points me longs
To wit pleynly what they mean
So that I may me shryue clean
Now herkne I shall ye points deuyse
And understand well mine appryse
For shryfte stant of no value
To him that wol him not virtue
To leave of vices the folly
For wynd is word but the maystrye
Is that a man him self defend
Of thing which is not to comende
Whereof ben few now a day
And netheles so as I may
Make unto thy memory know
The points of slouthe you shall know

bPon the vices to proceed /
After the cause ofema^nes deed /
The first point of slouthe I call
Lachesse and is the chyef of all
And has this properly of kind
To leven al thing behind
Of that he might do now here
He taryeth all the long year
And evermore he says to morrow
And so he wol his time borowe
And wyssheth after god me send
Than when he weneth to have an end
Than is he forthest to begin
Thus brings he many meschief Inue
Unware till that he be mescheued
And may not than be releued
And right so another more ne less
It stant ofloue and of lachesse
Sometime he slouteth on a day
That he never after get may
Now sone as of this ylke thing
If thou have any knoulechyng
That thou to love have done or this
Tell on. my good fadre yis
As of laches I am be know
That I may stand upon his row
As I that am clad of his suit
For when I thought my pursuit
To make and thereto set a day
To speak unto the sweet may
Lachesse bad abide yet
And bare on hond it was no wit
Ne time for to speak as tho
Thus with his tales to and fro
My time in taryeng he drough
When there was time good enough
He said another time is better
Thou shall now send here a letter
And par caas write more pleyn
Than thou by mouth durst seyn
Thus have I let time slide
For slouthe and kept not my tide
So that laches with his vice
Full of be has made my wit so nyce
That what I thought speak or do
With taryeng be ^eld me so
Till when I would and might naught
I not what thing is in my thought
Or it was dread or it was shame
But ever in ernest and in game
I wot there is no long time passed
But yet is not the love lassed
Which I unto my lady have
For though my tongue is slou to ocaue
At al time as I have bid
Mine heart stant ever in one stead
And axe besylyche grace
The which I may not yet embrace
And god wot it is maulgre mine
For this I wot right well afyn
My grace comes so selde about
That is the slouthe which I doubt
More than of all the remenaunt
Which is to love appertenaunt
And thus as touchend of lachesse
As I have told I me confess
To you my fadre E^byseche
That ferthermore ye wol me teache
And if there be of this matere
Some goodly tale for to lere
How I may do lachesse awey
That ye it would tell I prey
To wysse the my son and read
Among the tales which I read
An old ensample thereupon
Now herkne and I wol tell on
hIc ponit Confessor Exemplum contra Istos qui in amoris causa tardantes
delinquunt / Et narrat quali ter Dido Regina Eartaginis Eneam ab Incendijs
Troie fugitiuum in amo rem suum gaiusa suscepit / qui cum postea in parts
Italy a Cartagine bella turum se transtulit / ninuam que ibidem moram faciens
tempus redditus sui ad Didonem vltra modum tardauit Ipsa intolieravili gaudio
concussa sui cordis intima gladio transfodit

Again lachesse in loves caas
I find how whylom Eneas
Whom Anchyses to sone had
With greet nauye which he lad
Fro Troy arryueth at Eartage
Where fo: a while his herbergage
He took and betyd so
With her which was queen tho
Of the Cite his acquaintance
He wan whose name in remembrance
Is yet and Dydo she was hot
Which loves Eneas so hot
Upon the words which he said
That al her heart on him she laid
And did al holy what he would
But after that as it be should
Fro then he goth to Itayle
By ship and thew his arryuayle
Has take and shope him for to ride
But she which may not long abide
The hot pain of loves throw
Anon within a little throw
A setter unto her knight has write
And did him pseynsy for to wit
If he made any tarying
To dretche of his ayene coming
That she ne might him feel and see
She should stand in such degree
As whylome stood a swan to fore
Of that she had her make ^ore
For sorrow a fether in to her brain
She shoof and has her self slain
As king Menander in a lay
The soth has fond where she lay
Spraulend with her wings tweye
As she which should than deye
For love of him which was her make
And so shall I do for thy sake
This queen said well I wot
Lo to Enee thus she wrote
With many another word of co^pleynt
But he which had his thoughts feint
Toward love and full of slouthe
^^s time let and that was routhe
For she which loves him to fore
(...) ever more and more
And when she saw him tarry so
Her heart was so full of woe
That compleynend manyfolde
She has her own tale told
Unto her self and thus she spack
A who fond ever such a lack
Of slouthe in any worthy knight
Now wot I well my death is dyght
Through him which should have be my
^yf / But for to stynten all this stryf
Thus when she syghe none other bote
Right even unto her heart rote
A naked sword anon she threste
And thus she got her self rest
In remembrance of al slow
Whereof my sone thou might know
Hou taryeng upon the need
In loves cause is for to dread
And that has Dydo sore abought
Whoos death shall ever be bethought
And evermore if I shall seche
In this manner another speech
In a Cronyke I find write
A tale which is good to wit
His loquitur super eodem qualiter ^enolope vlixum maritum suum in obsidione
Troie diucius morantem ob ipsius ibidem tardacionem epistola sua redargiut

aT Twye when king Vlyxes
Upon the sege among ye pres
Of hem ye worthy knites were
Abode long time stylle there
In thylke time a man may see
Hou goodly that Penolope
Which was to him his true wife
Of his lachesse wa^ pleyntyf
Whereof to Troy she him send
Her will by letter thus spekende
My worthy love and lord alsso
It is and has be ever so
That where a woman is alone
At makes a man in his persoue
The more hardy for to wowe
In hope that she would bow
To such thyuge as his will werr
While that here lord were else where
And of my self I tell this
For it so long passed is
Sith first that ye from home went
That well nyhe every man is went
To come there I am while ye be out
And besyly each of hem about
Which love can / my love secheth
With great prayer and me bysecheth
And sum maken great manace
That if they might come in place
Where that they might here will have
There is no thing me should save
That they ne would worche things
And sum tell me tidings
That ye he deed and sum seyn
That certeynly ye be beseyn
To love a new and leave me
But holle as ever that it be
I thank unto the gods all
As yet for ought that is byfalle
May no man do my chekes read
But netheles it is to dread
That lachesse in contynuaunce
Fortune might work such a^chaunce
Which noman^ after shall amend
Loo thus this lady compleynend
A letter unto her lord has write
And prayed him that he would wit
And think how that she was al his
And that he tarry not in this
But that he would his love acquyte
To her ayeneward and not write
But come him self in all have
That he none other paper wast
So that he keep and hold his truth
Without let of any slouthe
Unto her lord and love lyege
To Troy where the great syege
Was leyd / this letter was conveyed
And he which wysedom has purueyd
Of all that to reason belongs
With gentyl heart it vnderfongeth
And when he has it over rad
In part he was right Inly glad
And eke in part he was dysesed
But love his heart has thorugh sesed
With pure ymagynacyon
That for none occupacyon
Which he began take on other side
He may not flyt his heart aside
For that his wife him had informed
Whereof he has him self conformed
With all the will of his courage
To shape and take the ^yage
Homeward what time that he may
So that him thinks one day
A thousand year till he may see
The ^ysage of Penolope
Which he desires most of all
And when the time was so byfalle
That Troy was destroyed and brent
He made no delayment
But goth him home in all high
Where that he fond to fore his eye
His worthy wife in good estate
And thus was seced the debate
Of love and slouthe was excused
Which does great harm where it is bsed
And hyndreth many a cause honest
Nota ad huc de quodam Astrologo super eodem qui quondam opus ingeniosum quasi
ad complementum septennius perducens vnius momenti tardacione omnem sui operis
diligenciam pe nitus feustrauit /

For of the great clerk Grostest
I read how ready that he was
Upon clergyr an head of bras
To make and forge it for to tell
Of such things as befelle
And seven years business
He laid but for the lachesse
Of half a mynute of an hour
Fro first that he began labor
He lost all that he had do
And other while it fares so
In loves cause who is slow
That he without under the wowe
By night fue often stant a cold
Which might if that he had would
His time have kept have been Inn
Nota ad huc contra tardacionem de virginibus fatuis que ni^^iam mora^
facientes intrante sponso ad nupa^^s cum ipso non introterunt

But slouthe may no profyt win
But he may sing in his Carole
How late ware come to the dole
Where he no good receive might
And that was proved well by night
Whylome of the maidens five
When thylk lord came for to wyue
For that her oy^e was awey
To light her lamps in the wey
Here slouthe brought it so about
Fro him that they be shet out
Whereof my sone that thou beware
As ferforth as I the tell dare
For l^u^ must be awayted
And if thou be not well affayted
In love to esehewe slouthe
My sone for to tell truth
Thou might not of thy self be able
To win love or make it stable
As though thou mytest love acheue
My fadre that I may well leave
But me was never assygned place
Where yet to get any grace
^e me was no such time appointed
For than I would I were unjointed
Of every lyme that I have
If I ne should hepe and save
Mine our bethe and eke my seed
If my lady it had ^^de
But she is otherwise auysed
Than grant such time assysed
And netheles of my lachesse
There has be no defaulte I guess
Of time lost if that I might
But if her lyketh not alyght
upon no lure which I find and cast
For ay the more I cry fast
The less her lyketh for to here
So for to speak of this matere
I seche that I may not find
I have and ever I am behind
And wot not what it may amounte
But fadre upon mine acompte
Which ye ben set to examyne
Of shryft after the diseyplyne
Say what your best counseyl is
My son my counseyl is this
How so it stand of time a goo
Do forth thy besynes so
That no lachesse in the be found
For slouthe is mighty to confound
The speed of every man^ work
For many a vice as says the clerk
There hongen upon slouthes lap
Of such as makes man myshappe
To pleyne and tell of that I wist
And thereupon if that the list
To know of slouthes cause more
In specyal yet ouermore
There is a vice full greuable
To him which is thereof culpable
And stant of al wrtues bare
Here after as I shall declare
Qui nichi^^attempt^t nichil expedit ore que muto / Munus amicicie vir sibi
caro capit / Est modus in verbis sed et qui parcit amori / Verba refer sua
^o^ fauet vllus amor

Hic loquitur Confessor de quadam specie Accidie que pusillanimitas dicta est
cuius Imaginatiua formido neque virtutes aggredi neque vicia f^gere au det /
sic quam vtriusque vite tam active quam co^ templatiue premium non attingit

Ouchend of sloth in his degree t
There is yet pusillanymyte
Which is to say in this langage
He that has little of courage
And dare not man's work legynne
So may he not by reason win
For who that dare naught undertake
By right he shall no profit take
But of this vice the nature
Dare no thyug set in adventure
Him lacks both worth and deed
Whereof he should his cause speed
He wol no manhood understand
For ever he has dread upon hand
Al his peril that he shall say
Him thinks the wolf is in the way
And of ymagynacyon
He makes his excusacyon
And feyneth cause of pure dread
And ever he fails at need
Till al be spylt that he with deleth
He has the sore which no man heleth
The which is cleped lak of heart
Though every grace about him sterte
He wol not ones stew his foot
So that by reason lose he mote
That wol not aunter for to win
And so forth sone if we begin
To speak of love and his service
There ben truantes in such a wise
That lakken heart vhan best were
They speken of love and right for fere
They wexen dombe and dare not tell
Without soune as does the belle
Which has no claper for to chyme
And right so they as for the time
^^on herteles without speech
Of love and dare no thing byseche
And thus they lose and win naught
For thy my sone if thou art ought
Culpable as touchend of this slouthe
Shryue the thereof and tell me truth
My sadee I am al beknowe
That I have been one of the slow
As for to tell in loves ^^as
Mine heart is yet and ever was
And though the world should to break
So ferful that I dar not speak
Of what purpoos that I have nome
When I toward my lady come
But let it pass and over goo
My sone do no more so
For after that a man pursues
To love so fortune seweth
Full often and yeueth her happy chance
To him which makes contynuaunce
To preyse love and to byseche
As by ^nsample I shall the teache
Hic in ^moris causa loquitur contra (...) / Et dicit quod Amons pre timore

preces continuauit quandam imaginem e^urneam cuius puleritudinis concupiscencia

I Find hou whilome there was one
Whose Iname was Pygmalyone
Which was a lusty man of youth
The works of entayll he couthe
Above al other men as tho
And though fortune fell him so
As he whom love shall travail
He made an Image of entayle
Lycho to a woman in semblaunce
Of feture and of contynaunce
So fair was never figure
Right as alyues creature
She seems for of yuor white
He has her wrout of such delight
She was rody on the eheke
And rody upon her lyppes eke
Whereof that he him self begyleth
For with a goodly look she smyloth
So that through pure Impressyon
Of his own Imagynacion
With all the heart of his courage
His love upon this fair image
He set and her of lone he preyde
But she no word ayeneward seyde
The long day what thing he deed
This Image in the same stead
Was ever by and at mete
He would her serve and prayde her ete
And put unto her mouth the cup
And when the board was taken up
He has her in to his Chamber nome
And after when the night was come
He leyd her in his led al naked
He was for wept he was for wasted
He kyste her cold lyppes often
And wyssheth that they were soft
And often he ronneth in her ere
And often his arm now here and there
He s^yd as he would her embrace
And ever among he axeth grace
As though she wist what he meant
And thus him self he began torment
With such dysese of loves pain
That noman might him more pain
But how it were of his penance
He made such contynuaunce
Fro day to night and prayed so long
That his prayer is vnderfonge
Which Venus of her grace herd
By night and when that he werst ferd
And it say in his naked arm
The cold image he felt warm
Of flessh and bone and full of life
^o thus he wan a lusty wife
Which obeysaunt was at his will
And if he would have hold him stylle
And no thing spoke he should have
faysed / But for he has his word tra
uayfed / And durst speak his love he
spedde / And all that he would abedde
For or they went than a two
A man child between hem two
They ga^^e which that hight
^aphus after the whom yet full ryt
A certain y^^ which paphos
Men clepe and of this name aros
By this ensample thou myt find
That word may worche above kind
For thy my sone if that thou spare
To speak lost is al thy fare
For slouthe brings Inn al woe
And over this to look also
The god of love is favorable
To hem that be of love stable
And many a wondre has byfalle
Whereof to speak among all
If that ye list to taken head
Whereof a solemn tale I read
Which I shall tell in remembrance
Upon the sort of loves chance

great* He swore it should not be let
That if she had a daughter ^ore
That it n^ should be forlore
And slain whereof she sorry was
So it vyfel upon this cas
When she delyuerd shld be
Isys by night in pryne^e
Which of childyng* is the goddess
Came for to help in that dys^r^sse
Till that this lady was al small
And had a daughter forth with all
Which the goddess in all weye
Bad keep and that they should seye
It were a sone and thus Iphys
They named him and upon this
The fadre was made for to wene
And thus in chamber with the qu^^^
This Iphis was forth draw tho
And clothed and arrayed so
Right as a kings sone should
Till after as fortu^e it would
When it was of a ten year age
Him was bytake in marriage
A dukes daughter for to wedde
Which Daun^e hight and often a bed
These children lay she and she
Which of one age both be
So* that within time of yere^
To gede^ as they ben pley fer^s
Lyggend a bed upon a night
Nature which does every wight
Upon her law for to muse
Constreyneth hem so that use
Thing which to hem was al unknow
Whereof Cupyde thylk throw
Took pity for the great love
And let do set kind above
So that her law may be used
And they upon her lust e^cused
For love ha^eth no thing more
Than thing which stant against ye ^ore
Of that nature ^ kind has s^t
For thy Cupyde has so beset
His grace upon this adventure
That he acordaunt to nature
When that he saw the time best
That each of hem has other ^est
Transformeth Iphe in to a man
Whereof the kind love he wan
Of lusty yongthe Iante his wife
And tho they led a merry life
Which was to kind none offense
And thus to take an euydence
It seems love is well wyllend
To hem that be contynuend
With ^esy heart to pursue
Thing which is to love due
Whereof my sone in this matere
Thou might ^nsample taken here
That with thy gre^e business
Thou might at^^yne to rych^sse
Of love if that there be no slouth^
I dar well say by my troth:
As fe^ as my wit can seche
My fadre as for lak of speech
But se as I me sh^oof to fore
There is none other time lore
Whereof there might be obstacle
To let^ love of his miracle
Which I bys^ch^ day and night
But fadre so as is right
In form of shryf^e to be know
What thing be^^ngeth to the slow
Your faderhode I wol prey
If there be forther any weye
Touchend unto this ylk vice
My sone ye of this office
There serves one in specyal
Which has lost his memoryal
So that he can not withholde
In thing which to keep is hold
Whereof him self full often agreueth
And who that most upon him leueth
When that his wits ^en so weyued
He may full little be deceived

Hic tractat Confessor de vicio obliuionis qua^ matter eius Accidia ad o^s

tO serve Accidie in his office
There is of sloth another vice
Which cleped is foryet ylness^
That may not in his heart impresse
Of virtue which reason has set
So clean his wits he foryede
For in the tellyng of his tale
No more his heart than his male
Has remembrance of thy^k form
Whereof he should his wit inform
And than yet ne wot he why
Thus is his purpoos naught for thy
Forlore of that he would abide
And scarsely if he sees the tide
To love of that he had meant
Thus many a lover has be shent
Tell on therefore have thou be one
Of hem that has slouthe so begone
Y^ fader it has often be so
That when I am my lady fro
And think unto ward her draw
Then cast I many a new law
And all the world torn up so down
And so decorde I my lesson
And write in my memoral
That I to her tell shall
For when I come there she is
I have it al foryete ^wy^
Of that I thought for to tell
I can not than uneaths spelle
That I wend alther best have red
So sore of her I am adred
For as a man that suddenly
A ghost byhelde so fare I
So that for fere I can not get^
My wit but I my self foryete
That I wo^^ never what I am
N^ whether I shall ne when I came
But muse as he that were amassed
^yche to the book in which is rased
The letter and may no thing be rad
See ben my wits over lad
That what as ever I thout have spo^e^
It is out fro mine heart stoken
And stand as who says dombe and deef
That al nys worth an Iuy leef
Of that I wend well have say^
And at last I make abrayd
^ast up mine heed and look about
^^ght as a man that were in doude
And wot not where he shall bycome
Thus am I often al overcome
There as I wend best for to stand
But after when I understand
And am in other place alone
I make many a woeful moan
Unto my self and speak so
A fool where was thyn heart tho*
When thou thy worthy lady syghe
Were thou ^ferd than of her eye
For of her hond there is no dread
So well I know her womanly de
That in her is no more oul^^age
Then in a child of three year age
Why have thou dread of so good one
Whom al virtue both begone
That in her is no vyolence
But goodlyhede and Innocence
Without spot^e of any blame
A nyce heart Fie for shame
A coward heart of love vnlered
Whereof art thou so sore afered
That thy ^ong thou suffcest frese
And wolt thy goodly words lose
When thou have fond time and space
How sholdest thou deserve grace
When thou thy self dare axe none
But al thou have foryete anon
And thus despute in loves ^ore
But help I find none the more
But stomble upon mine own treyne
And make an akynge of my pain
For ever when I thynk among
Ho^ al is on my self along
I say O fool of al fools
Thou farest as between two stole^*
That would syt^e and goth to grou^^^
It was ne never it shall be found
Between foryetylnes and dread
That man should any cause speed
And thus mine holy fadre dear
Toward my self as ye may hare
I pleyne of my fo^yetylnesse
But else all the business
That may be take of man's thought
My heart takes and is through sough^
To thynken ever upon that swe^^
Without slouthe I you byhete
For what so fall or well or woe
That thought foryete I neuerm^
Where so I laugh or where so I loure
Naught half a mynute of an our
Ne might I let out of my mind
But if Itho^ght upon that hende
Thereof ne shall no slouthe let
Till death out of this world me fet^e
Al though I had on such a ryng
As moses thorugh his enchauntynge
Sometime in Ethyope made
When that he Tharbys wedded hade
Which ryng bare of oblyuyon
The name and was by reason
That where on a finger it sat
Anon his love he so forya^e
And that he had it never know
And so it fell that ylke throw
When Tharbys had it on her hond
No knowlechyng of him she fond
But al was clean out of memory
As men may read in his storye
And thus he went quyte aweye
That never after thylk day
She thought that there was such one
Al was foryete and over gone
But in good feyth so may not I
For she is ever fast by
So that mine heart touches
That for no thing yt slouthe voucheth
I may foryete her leef ne loath
For oueral where as she goth
Mine heart follows her about
Thus may I say without doubt
For ^e^ for werse for out for nout
She passes never fro my thought
But when I am there as she is
Mine heart as I you said or this
Somtym^ of her is so sore adrad
And sometime is ouerglad
And once of reule and o^^e of space
For when I see her goodly face
And think upon her high prys
As though I were in paradys
I am so ^^uesshed on the sight
To speak unto her I n^ might
As for the time though I welde
For I ne may my wit unfold
To find one word of that I men^
But al is it forye^^ clean
And though I stand there a mile
Al is foryerte for the while
A tong^e I have and words none
And thus I stond^ and think alone
Of thing that h^lpeth often naught
But what I had before thought
To speak when I come there
It is fory^^^ as naught ne were
And stand ^mased and asso^ed
That of no thing which I have noted
I can not than a note sing
But al is out of knoulechynge
Thus what for joy and what for dread
Al is forye^e at the need
So that my fader of this sloth
I have you said the pleyn troth
Ye may it as ye list redress
For thus stant my foryetylnesse
And eke my pusyllanymy^e
Say now forth what ye like to me
For I wol only do by you
My sone I have well herd hou thou
Have said and thou must amend
For love his grace wol not send
To that man which dare axe none
For this we known euerychone
A man's thought without speech
God wot and yet men byseche
His will is for without bedys
He does his grace but in few stedys
And what man that foryete him selue
Among a thousand be not twelve
That wol him take in remembrance
But let him fall and take his chance
For thy pull up a besy heart
My sone and let no thing aster^e
Of love fro thy besynesses
For touching of foryetylnesse
Which many a love has set behind
A tale of great ensample I find
Whereof it is py^e for to wit
In the manner as it is write
Hic in amoris causa contra obliuiosos ponit Confessor Exemplum / qualiter
Demophon versus bellum Troia number itinerando a Philli de Rodepey re gina non
tantum in hospicium sed ecia^ in amorem gandio magno susceptus e^ qui postea a^
ipsa Tro^^ descendens rediturum infra certum tempus fide^^ss^ me se compromisit
/ sed qiua huiusmodi promissiones diem statutu^ oblitus ^ Phillis obliuionem
Demephontis lacrimis primo deplangens tandem cordula collo suo circumligata* se
mortua^ suspendit

King demophon when he by ship
To Troy ward with felauship
Seylend goth upon his weye
It happens him at Rodepeyr
As Eolus him had blow
To l^nd and rested for a throw
And feste that ylke time thus
That the daughter of Lygurgius
Which queen was of the country
Was soiourned in the Cite
Within a Castle in the stronde
Where Demophon came up to the land
^hylles she hight and of young age
And both of stature and of ^ysage
She had all that her best vesemeth
Of Demophon ryt well her quemeth
When he was come she made him chere
And he that was of such manner
A lusty knight ne might asterte
That he ne s^t on her his heart
So that within a day or two
He thought how ever that he go
He would assaye the fortune
And began with this queen comune
With goooly words in her ere
And for to put her out of fere
He swore and has his truth plyght
To be for ever her own knight
And thus with her he stylle abode
There while his ship on anchor rood
And bad enough of time and space
To speak of love and seek grace
This lady herd all that he said
How he swore and how he prayde
Which was an enchauntement
To her that was an Innocent
And though it were truth and feyth
She leueth all that ever he seyth
And as her fortune should
She grants him all that he would
Thus was he for the time in joy
Till that he should go to T^o^e
But tho she made mochel sorrow
And he his troth leyd to sorrow
To come and if that he live may
Again within a month day
And thereupon they kysten both
But were him leef or were him loath
To ship he goth and forth he went
To Troy as was his first intent
The days gone the monethe passes
Her love encreseth and his lasseth
For him she lost sleep and mete
And he his time has al foryete
So that this woeful young queen
Which wot not what it might mean
A letter send and prayed him come
And said that she was overcome
With strength of love in such a wise
That she not long may suffyse
To lyuen out of his presence
And put upon his conseyence
The truth which he has (...)
Whereof she loves him so hot
She says if that he longer let
Of such a / day as she him set
She should ste^^en in his slouthe
Which were a shame unto his troth
This letter is forth upon her fond
Whereof somdele comfort on hand
She took as she that would abide
And wayteth upon that ylke tide
Which she has in her letter write
But now is pity for to wit
As he did erst / so he forgate
His time eftsone and forsate
But she which might not do so
The tide awayteth euermo
And cast her eye upon the se^
Sometime nay sometime ye
Sometime he came sometime naught
Thus she dysputeth in her thought
And wot not what she think may
But fastend all the long day
She was in to the derk night
And tho / she has do set up light
In a lantern on high (...)
Upon a toure where she goth often
In hope that in his coming
He should see the light brennyng
Whereof he might his weyes right
To come where she was by night
But al for nonght she was deceived
For Venus has her hope weyued
And showed her upon the sky
How that the day was fast by
So that within a little throw
The days light she might know
Tho she byhelde the sea at large
And when she saw there was no barge
^e ship (...) fer as she may kenne
Down fro the tour she began to run
In to an herber al her one
Where many a wonder woeful moan
She made that no life it wist
As she which al her joy mist
That now she swouneth now she pleyneth
And her face she dyst^yneth
With teres which as of a well
The stremes from her eyes fell
So as she might and ever in one
She cleped upon Demephon
And said Allas thou slow wight
There was never such a knight
That so thorugh his vngentylnesse
Of slouthe and of foryetylnesse
Against his truth breketh his steuene
And tho her eye up to the heuene
She cast and said O thou unkind
Here shall thou for thy slouthe find
If that the list to come and see
A lady deed for love of the
So as I shall my selue spylle
Whom if it had be thy will
Thou myghtest save well Enough
With that upon a grene bough
A (...) of syle which there she ha d
She knyt and so her self she lad
That she about her white swear
Hit deed / and henge her self there
Whereof the gods were amoued
And Demephon was reproved
That of the gods prouydence
Was shape such an euydence
Ever afterward ayene the slow
That ^hillis in the same throw
Was shape in to a note tree
That al men it might see
And afterward ^hyllys ^hyllerd
This tree was cleped in the yerd
And yet for Demophon to shame
In to this day it bears the name
This woeful chance and how it ferde
Anon as Demephon it herd
And every man it had in speech
His sorrow was not tho to seche
He began his slouthe for to banne
But it was al to late thanne
Lo thus my sone might thou wit
Ayene this vyde hou it is write
For no man may the harms guess
That fallen through foryetylnesse
Whereof that I thy shryft have herd
But yet of slouthe hou it has ferd
In other wise I thenke oppose
If thou have gylt as I suppose
Dum plantare licet cultor qui n^cli git ortum / Si desint feuctus imputat ipse

fVlfylled of slouthes exe^plair
There is yet one his secretayr
And he is cleped Necligence
Which wol not look his euydence
Whereof he may beware to fore
But when he has his cause lore
Than is he wise after the hond
When help may no manner bond
Than at first would he bind
Thus evermore he stant behind
When he the thing may not amend
Than is he ware / and seyth at the end
A would god I had know
Whereof beiaped with a mow
He goth / for when the great stead
Is stole than he takes head
And makes the stable door fast
Thus ever he pleyth an after cast
Of all that he shall say or do
He has a manner ^ke also
Him list not learn to be wise
For le set of no virtue pryse
But as him lyketh for the while
So fails he full often gyle
When that he weneth seker to stand
And thus thou might well understood
My sone if thou art such in love
Thou might not come at thyn above
Of that thou would well acheue*
Amans
Mine holy fadre as I leave
I may well with sauf conscience
Eycuse me of negligence
Toward love in all wise
For though I ^e none of the wise
So truly I am amerous
That I am ever curyous
Of hem that can best inform
To known and wyten all the form
What falls unto loves / craft
But yet ne fond I naught the haft
Which might unto the blade acorde
For never herd I man record
What thing it is that might avail
To win love without fail
Yet so ferforth couthe I never find
Man that by reason ne by kind
Me conthe teache such an art
That he ne failed of a part
And as toward mine own wit
Contryue I couthe never yet
To find any se^yrnesse
That me might other more or less
Of love make me for to speed
For leueth well withouten dread
That if there were such a weye
As certainly as I shall deye
I had it learned long a go
But I wot well there is none so
And netheles it may well be
I am so rude in my degree
And eke my wits ben so dull
That I ne may naught to the full
Atteyne unto so high a love
But this I dar seye ouermore
Al though my wit be not strong
It is not on my will along
For that is ^^sy night and day
To learn all that I lern emay
Hou that I might love win
But yet I am as to begin
If I would make an end
And for I not hou it shall wend
That is to me my most sorrow
But I dare take god to borowe
As after mine entendeme^t
None other wise neclygent
Than I you say have I not be
For thy pur saint charity
Tell me my fadre what you seems
Confessor
In good feyth sone well me quemeth
That thou thy self have thus acquyte
Toward this vice in which no wit
A bide may for in an hour
He lost all that he may labor
The long year so that men seyne
What ever he does it is in vein
For thorugh the slouthe of neclyge^ce
There was never such a science
Ne virtue which was bodily
That nys destroyed and lost thereby
Ensample that it has be so
In books I find write also
Hic contra vicium necligencie ponit Confessor Exemplum Et narrat quod cum
Pheton filius solis currum pa^^is sui per (...) Regere debuerat ad monitus a
patre vt equos ne deuiarent equa manu dilige^cius (...) ipse co^s^ liu^ pris
sua neclige^cia pret^^e^s equos curru nimis basse errare permisit / un de non
solum incendio orbem inflammauit / sed and ipsum de curru cadendem in quoddam
fluuium demergi ad inte^^tum causauit

Phoebus which is ye son hot
That shyneth upon earth hot
And causes every lives health
He had a sone in all his welthe
Which Pheton hight and he desires
And with his modre he conspyreth
The which was cleped Clemene
For help and counseyl so that he
His fadre cart led might
Upon the fair days light
And for this thing they both prayde
Unto the fadre and he said
He would well but forth with all
Three points he bad in specyal
Unto his sone in all wise
That he him should well auyse
And take it as by weye of lore
The first was that he his horse to sore
Ne pryk and after that he told
That he the reins fast hold
And also that he be right ware
In what manner he ledeth his chare
That he mystake not his gate
But up auysement algate
He should bear a syker weye
That he to low ne to heye
His cart drive at any throw
For dread lest he should be overthrow
And thus by Phoebus ordinance
Took Pheton in to goueruaunce
The sons cart which he lad
B^t he such veyn glory had
Of that he was set upon high
That he his own estate ne sygh
Thorugh negligence and took none head
So might he well not long speed
For he the horse withouten law
The cart let about draw
Where as him lyketh wantonly
That at the last suddenly
For he no reason would know
This fyry cart he drove to low
And fyreth all the world about
Whereof they weren al in doubt
And to the god for help cryden
Of such vnhappes as betyden
Phoebus which saw the negligence
How Pheton ayene his defense
His chare has drive out of the weye
Ordeyneth that he fell a weye
Out of the cart in to the flood
And drowned lo now how it stood
With him that was so neglygent
That fro the high fyrmament
For that he would goo to low
He was anon down overthrow
In high estate it is a vice
To goo to low and in service
It greueth for to goo to high
Whereof a tale in ^eesye
Exemplum super eodem de Icharo filio Didali in carcere minotau^ existente /
cui Dedalus vt inde eu^faret alas componens firmite^ imunxit / ne nimis alte

I Find how whylome Dedalus
Which had a sone / and Icharus
He hight and though him thought loath
In such prison they were both
With mynotaurus that about
They myghten nowher wenden out
So they bygonnen for to shape
How they the prison might escape
This Dedalus which fro his youth
Was taught and many crafts couthe
Of feathers and of other things
Has made to flee diverse wings
For him and for his sone also
To whom he yafe in charge tho
And bad him think thereupon
How that his wings be set on
With wax and if he took his flight
To high al sodenlyche he might
Make it to melte with the son
And thus they have her flyt lego^ne
Out of the prison fair and soft
And they were both alofte
This Icharus began to mount
And of the good counseyl none aco^pte
He set which his fadre taught
Till that the son his wings caught
Whereof it melt and from the hight
Withouten help of any flight.
He fell to hi^ destructyon
And lych^ to that condycyon
There fallen oftymes feel
For lok of governance in well
Als well in love as other weye
N^w good fadre I you preye
If there be more in the matere
^f s^uthe that I might it here
M^ seen and for thy dylyg^nce
Which every man's comeyence
^y reason should reule ^ keep
And if that the list to take keep

Which yeueth unto the vices rest
And is of sleuthe the slowest

aMong these other of ^louthes
kind / Which al labor set behind.
And hates al besynes
T^^re is yet one which Idelnes
Is cleped and is the noryoe
In man's kind of every vice
Which secheth cases many fold
In winter does he naught for cold
In somer may he naught for hete
So whether that he feese or sweet
Or be he in or be he out
He wol ben ydel al about
But if he pley ought at the dies
For who that ever takes fees
And thinks worship to deserve
There is no lord whom he wol serve
And for to duelle in his service
But for it were in such a wise
Of that he sees parauenture
That by lordship and by oeuerture
He may the more s^onde stylla
And use his Idelnesse at will
For he ne wol no trauaylle take
To ride for his lady sake
But lives upon al his wysshes
And as a Catt would ete Fysshes
Without wetyng of his clees
So would he do but netheles
He fails of that he have would
Confessor
My sone if thou of such a molde
Art made tell me pleyne thy shryft
Amans
My fadre god I give a yift
That toward love as he may wytt
Al ydel was I never yett
Ne never shall while I may goo
Now sone tell me than so
What have thou done of besyshyp
To love and to the ladyshyp
Of her which thy lady is
My fadre ever yet or this
In every place in every stead
What so my lady has me bid
With all mine heart obedyent
I have thereto be dylygent
And if so be that she bid naught
What thing in to my thought
Comes first of that I may suffyse
I bow and profre my service
Sometime in chamber sometime in halle
Right so as I see the times fall
And when she goth to here mass
That time shall not me ouerpasse
That I ne approach her ladyhede
In aunter if I may her led
Unto the chapel and again
Than is not al my wey in vein
Somdele I may the better fare
When I that may not feel her bare
May led her clothed in mine arm
But afterward it does me harm
Of pure Imagynacyon
For than there a collacyon
I make unto my seluen often
And say O lord how she is soft
How she is round. how she is small
Now would god / I had her al
Without danger at my will
And than I syke and sit full stylle
Of that I see my besy thought
Is turned Idel in to naught
But for all that let I ne may
When I see time another day
That I ne do my besynes
Unto my ladies worthynes
For I thereto my wit affayte
To see the time and awayte
What is to done and what is to leave
And so when time is by her leave
What thing she bydde me do I do
And where she bydde me go ^ goo
And when her list to clepe I come
Thus has she fullyche overcome
Mine Idelnesse till that I sterue
So that I mote her needs serve
For as men seyn need has no law
Thus mote I nedely to her deawe
I serve I bow I lofte I lowte
Mine eye follows her about
What so she wol so wol I
When she wol sit I knele her by
And when she sto^deth than wol I sto^d
But when she takes her werk on ho^d
Of weuyng or of brouderye
Than can I not but muse and prye
Upon her fyngers long and small
And now I think and now I tale
And now I sing and now I syke
And now my contenaunce I pyke
And if it fall as for a time
Her lyketh naught abide byme
But occupyeth her on other things
Than make I other taryenges
To drive forth the long day
For me is loath to depart a way
And than I am so simple of port
That for to feyne sum dysport
I play with her little hounde
Now on the bed now on the ground
Now with the birds in the cage
For there is none so little page
Ne yet so simple a Chamberere
That I ne make hem all chere
And al for they should speak well
Thus may ye see my besy whele
That goth not ydelyche about
A(...) her list to ryden out
(...) or other stead
I come thus though I be not bid
And take her in mine arm alofte
And set her in her sadel soft
And so forth led her by the brydel
For that I would not ben ydel
And if her list to ride in chare
And that I may thereof be ware
A none I shape me for to ride
Right even by the chares side
And as I may I speak among
And otherwhyle I sing a song
Which Ouyde in his book made
And said O what sorrows glade
O what woeful prosperyte
Belongs to the propyrte
Of love who so wol him serve
And yet there fro may no man swerue
That he ne mote his law obey
And thus I ride forth my weye
And am right besy oueral
With heart and with my body al
As I baue said you here to fore
My good fadre tell me therefore
Of ydelnes if I have gylt
My sone but if thou all wylt
Ought else than I may now here
Thou shall have no penance here
And netheles a man may see
How now a days that there be
Full many of such hertes slow
That wol not besyen hem to be know
What thing that love is till at the last
That he with strength hem ouercast
That maulgre hem they mote obey
And done al ydelshyp aweye
To serve well and besylyche
But sone than art thou none of such
For love shall the well excuse
But otherwise if thou refuse
To love thou might so par ca^s
B^n Idel as sometime was
A kings daughter unadvised
Till that Cupyde her has chastysed
Where of thou shall a tal^ here
Acordaunt unto this matere
Hic ponit Confessor Ex^mplum ^^os qui in amoris occupacionem omit (...)
grauioris infortunij casus expectant / Et narrat de quadam Armennie Regis filia
que huiusmodi condicionis in ^anapio iuuentutis ociosa persiste^s micabili
postea visione castigata in amoris obseqiuum pre ceteris diligencior efficitur
/

oF armenye I read thus
There was a king which herupus /
Was hot and he a lusty maid.
To daughter had and as men said
Her name was Rosiphele
Which tho was of great renome
For she was both wise and feyre
And should be her fadre heir
But she had one defaulte of slouthe
Toward love and that was routhe
For so well couthe noman seye
Which might her set in the weye
Of loves occupacyon
Thorugh none Imagynacyon
That seole would she not know
And thus she was one of the slow
As of such hertes business
Till when Venus the goddess
Which loves court has for to reule
Has brought her in to better reule
Forth with Cupyde and his might
For they marvel how such a wight
Which tho was in her lusty age
Desires nouther marriage
Ne yet the love of peramours
Which ever has been the common course
Among hem that lusty were
So was it showed after there
For he that hye hertes loweth
With fyry dart which he throws
Cupyde which of love is god
In chastysynge has made a rod
To drive awey her wantonness
So that within a while I guess
She had on such a chance sporned
That al her moo^ was ouertorned
Which first she had of slow manner
For this it fell as thou shall here
When come was the month of may
She would walk upon a day
And that was or the son aryst
Of women but a few it wist
And forth she went pryuely
Unto the park was fast by All soft walkend upon the gras
Till she came there the lau^de was
Thorugh which there ran a great river
It thought her fair and said her
I wol abide under the shawe
And badde her women to withdraw
And there she stood alone stylle
To think what was in her will
She saw the sweet flowers spryng
She herd glad fowls sing
She saw bestes in her kind
The buk the do the heart the hynde
The male go with the femele
And so bygan there a quarele
Between love and her own heart
For which she couthe not astert
And as she cast her eye about
She saw clad in one suit a route
Of ladies where they come ride
A long under the wode side
On fair ambulend horse they sete
That were al white fat and great
And they echone ride on side
The sadeles were of such a pride
With perles and gold so well begone,
So rich saw she never none
In kyrtels and in copes rich
They were clothed al alyche
Departed even of white and blewe
With all lusts that she knew
They were embroudred oueral
Here bodies were long and small
The beauty fair upon her face
None erthely thing it may deface
Corownes on their hedes they bear
As each of hem a queen were
That all the gold of Cresus halle
The lest coronal of hem all
Myt not have bought after the worth
Thus come they rydend forth
The kings daughter that saw yt tide
For pure abasshede drew her aside
And held her cloos under abough
And let hem stylle ride Enough
For as her thought in her auyce
To hem that were of such a price
She was not worthy to axe there
Fro when they come and what they were
Bnt lever than this worlds good
She would have wist how it stood
And put her head a little out
And as she looked her about
She saw comend under the lynde
A woman upon an horse behind
The horse on which she rood was blak
Al ^ene and galled upon the back
And halted as he were enc^oyed
Whereof the woman was annoyed
Thus was the horse in sorry plyght
But for all that a sterre light
Amyddes in the front she had
Her sadel este was wonder bad
In which the woeful woman sat
And netheles there was with that
A rich brydel for the nones
Of gold and precious stones
Here cote was somdele to tore
About her myddel tweuty score
Of horse halters and well mo
There hangen that time tho
Thus when she came the lady nyghe
Then she took better head and syghe
This woman was fair of vylage
Fresshe lusty young and tender of age
And so this lady there she stood
Bethought her well and understood
To this which come rydend tho
Tidings couthe tell of tho
Which as she saw to fore ride
And put her forth and prayed her abide
And said O suster let me here
What ben they that ryden now here
And ben so rychely arrayed
This woman that so came esmayed
Ausuerde with full soft speech
And said Madame I shall you teache
These ar of tho that whylome were
Servants to love and truth bear
There as they had their hertes set
Fare well for I may not let
Madame I go to my seruyor
So must I have in all wise
For thy madame give me leave
I may not long with you leave
A good suster yet I preye
Tell why ye be so beseye
And with these haltres thus begone
Madame whilome I was one
That to my fadre had a king
But I was slow and for no thing
Me list not to love obey
And that I now full sore obey
For I why lome no love had
My horse is now feeble and bad
And al to tore is mine array
And every year this fresshe may
These lusty ladies ride about
And I must needs sewe her route
In this manner as ye now see
And trusse her haltres forth with me
And am but her horse knave
None other office I ne have
Hem thinks I am worthy no more
For I was slow in loves lore
When I was able for to lere
And would not the tales here
Of hem that couthe love teache
Now trsse me than I you byseche
Where fore that rich brydel serves
With that awey her chere she swerueth
And began to weep and thus she told
This rich brydel which ye behold
So rich upon mine horse head
Madame before or I was deed
When I was in my lusty life
There fell in to mine heart a stryf
Of love which me overcome
So that thereof head I nome
And thought I would love a knight
That last well a fonrtenyght
For it no longer might last
So nyghe my life was at the last
But now allas to late ware
That I ne had him loved are
For death came so have vyme
^r I thereto had any time
That it ne might ben acheued
But for all that I am releued
Of that my will was good thereto
That love suffers it be so
That I shall such a brydel were
Now have ye herd al mine ansuere
To god madame I you betake
And warns al for my sake
Of love that they be naught ydel
And bid hem think upon my brydel
And with that word al suddenly
She passes as it were a sky
Al clean out of the lady sight
And tho for fore her heart aflyght
And said to her self Allas
I am right in the same caas
But and I live after this day
I shall amend it if that I may
And thus homeward this lady went
And changed al her first intent
Within her heart and began to s^bere
That she no haltres would bear
Lo sone here might thou take heed
How / Idelnes is for to dread
Namelyche of lone as I have write
For thou might understand and wit
Among the gentyl nacyon
Love is an occupacyon
Which for to keep his lusts save
Should every gentyl heart have
For as that lady was chastysed
Right so the knight may be auysed
Which ydel is and wol not serve
To long he may per caas deserve
A gretter pain than she had
When she about with her lad
The horse haltres and for thy
Good is to be ware there by
But for to loken abouen all
These maidens hou so it fall
They should take ensample of this
Which I have told forsothe it is
My lady Venus whom I serve
What wommen wol her thank deserve
She may not thylk love eschelbe
Of peramours but she mote sewe
Cnpydes law and netheles
Men seyn such love selde in pees
That it nys ever upon afpye
Of Iange lyuge and of falls envy
Full often meddled with dysese
But thylk love is well at ease
Which set is upon marriage
For that dare shown the vysage
In all places openly
A great meruaylle it is for thy
How that a maid wol let
That she her time ne besette
To have unto thylke feste
Whereof the love is al honest
Men may recover loss of good
But so wise a man yet never stood
Which may recover time lore
So may a maiden well therefore
Ensample take of that she straungeth
Her love and long or that she changes
Her heart upon her lusts grene
To marriage as it is seen
For thus a year two or three
She left / or* that she wedded be
While she the charge might bear
Of children which the wo^ld forbere
Ne may but if it should fail
But maiden that in her spousayle
Would tarry when she take may
She shall per chance an other day
Be let when that her leuest were
Whereof a tale unto thyn ere
Which is culpable upon this deed
I thenke tell of that I read
Ic ponit Exemplum super eode^ ^ Et narrat de filla Iepte quc aim ^x sui patr^s
voto in holocaustum deo oc cidi and offerri deveret ipsa pro eo quod virgo fuit
and prolem ad augme^tacione^ populi dei nondum genuisset. xl. dieru^ spacium vt
cum suis sodalibus virginibus suam defleret virginitatem priusquam moreretur in
exemplum aliorum a patre postulauit

^ Mong the Jews as me^ told
There was whylome by days old*
A noble duc which Iepte hight /
And fell he should go to fight
Again Amon the cruel king
And for to speak upon this thing
within his heart he made a vow
To god and said O lord if thou
Wol grant unto my men vyctorye
I shall in tokne of thy memory
The first life that I may see
Or man or womman where it be
Anon as I come home again
To the which art god souereyne
Sleen in thy name and sacryfye
And thus with his chyualrye
He goth him forth where yt he should
when be had won what he would
And ouercam his fomen all
May noman know that shall fall
This duk a lusty daughter had
And fame which the world sprad
Has brought unto this ladies ere
How that her fadre has do there
She wayteth upon his coming
with daunsyng and with carolyng
As she that would be to fere
Al other and so she was therefore
In masphat at her fadres gate
The first and when he comes there ate
And saw his daughter he to brayde
His clothes and wepend he said
O mighty god among us here
Now wot I not in what manner
This worlds joy may be pleyne
I had all that I couthe seyne
Ayene my fomen by thy grace
So when I came to ward this place
There was no gladder man than I
But now my lord al suddenly
My joy is turned in to sorrow
For I my daughter shall to morrow
To he^e and brenne in thy service
To loving of thy sacryfyce
Though mine auowe so as it is
The maiden when she wist of this
And saw the sorrow her fader made
So as she may with words glade
Comforted him and bad him hold
His covenant as he was behold
Toward god as he behyght
But netheles her heart aflyght
Of that she saw her death comend
And than unto the ground knelend
To fore her fadre she is fall
And says so as it is fall
Upon this point that she shall dye
Of one thing first she would him prey
That forty days of respyte
He would her grant upon this plyt
That she the while may be weep
Her maydenhede which she keep
So long has had and not beset
Whereof her youth is let
That she no children has forth draw
In marriage after the law
So that the people is not encreced
But that it might be releced
That she her time has lore so
She would by his leave go
With other maidens to compl^yne
And after ward unto the pain
Of does she would come again
The fader herd his daughter seyn
And thereupon of one assent
The maidens were anon assent
That sholden with this maiden wend
So for to speak unto this end
They gone the dounes and the dales
With weeping and woeful tales
And every with her maydenhode
Compleyneth upon thilk need
That she no childer had bore
Whereof she has her youth lore
Which never she recouere may
For so fell that her last day
Was come in which she should take
Her death which she may not forsake
^^ thus she deyde a woeful maid
For thylk cause which I said
As thou have understand above
My fader as toward the love
Of maidens for to tell truth
Ye have thylk vice of slouthe
Me thinks wonder well declared
That ye the women have not spared
Of hem that tarry so behind
But yet it falls in my mind
Toward the men hou that ye speak
Of hem that wol no trauayl seek
In cause of love upon desert
To speak in words so couuert
I not what trauayl that ye meant
My sone and after mine intent
I wol the tell hou that I thought
Hou whilome men her loves bought
Thorugh great trauail in strange lo^des
Where yt they wrought with her ho^des
Of arms many a worthy deed
In sundry places as men may read
Quem probat armorum probitas venus approbat and que in / Torpor habet reprobu^
reprobat illa virum / Vecors segnicies insignia nescit amoris Nam piger ad
brauium tardius ipse venit

Hic loquitur quod in amoris causa milicie probitas ad armorum laboris
eyercicium nullatenus torpescat

tHat every love of pure kind
Is first forth draw well I find /
But netheles yet over this,
Deserte does so that it is
The rather had* in many place
For thy who so seche loves grace
Where that these worthy women ar^
He may not than him selue spare
Upon his travail for to serve
Whereof that he may thank deserve
These men of arms there as they be
Sometime over the great see
So that by land and eke by ship
He mote travail for worship
And make many hasty rodes
Sometime in pruys sometime in Rodes
And sometime in to Tartarye
So that these herauldes on him cry
Vaylant Vaylant / lo where he goth
And he yeueth hem gold and clothe
So that his name might spring
And to his lady ere bring
Sum tydyng of his worthynesse
So that she might of his prowess
Of that she herd men record
The better unto his love acorde
And danger put out of her mood
When al men recorden good
And that she wot well for her sake
That (...) no trauayl would forsake
My sone of this travail I mean
Now shryue the for it shall be seen
If thou art ydel in this cas
My fader ye and ever was
For as me thinks truly
That every man does more than I
And of this point and if so is
That I have ought done or this
It is so little of acompte
As who says it may not amonnte
To win of love his lusty yift^
For this I tell you in shryft^
That me were lever her love win
Than Prayre and all that is therynne
And for to slay the hethen all
I not what good there might fall
So much blood though there were shad
This find j so written that Christ bad
That no man other should sle
What should I win over the sea
If I my lady left at home
But pass they the salt foam
To whom christ bad should preche
To all the world and his feyth teache
But now they rucken in her nest
And resten as hem lyketh best
In all the swetenes of delyces
Thus they defenden us the vices
And sytten hem self al amy^de
To slay and fight they us bydde
Hem whom they should as ^ book seith
Connerten unto Crystes feyth
But here of have I great marvel
Hou they would me bid travail
A Sa^^syn if I slay shall
I slay the soul forth with all
And that was never Crystes lote
But now hoo thereof I say no more
Hic allegat Amans in sui excusacionem qualiter Achilles apud Troiam propter
amorem ^olixene^^ arma sua per aliquod tempus dimisit

But I wol speak upon my shri^^^
And to Cupyde I make a yefte
That who as ever price deserve
Of Arms I wol love serve
As though I should hem both keep
As well would I take keep
When it were time to abide
As for to travail and for to ride
For hou as ever a man labor
Cupyde has ever his hour
For I hane herd tell also
Achilles left hs arms so
Both of him self and of his men
At Troy fro Polyxenen
Upon her love when he fell
That for no chance that be fell
Among the greeks up or down
He would naught ayene the touus
B^ armed for the love of her
And so me thinks leave sir
A man of arms may him rest
Sometime in hope for the best
If he may find a wey nerre
What should I than go so far
In strannge lands many a my^^
To ride and lose at home the while
My love it were a short beyete
To win chaf and lose whete
But if my lady bid would
That I for her love should
Trauaylle me thinks truly
I might flee thorugh out the sky
And so thorugh out the deep see
For all ne set I not a s^re
What thing that I might else get
What helps a man to have mete
When drynk lakketh on the board
What helps any man's word
To sey hou I travail fast
Where as me fayllith at the last
That thing which I trauaylle fore
O in good time were he ^ore
That might atteyne such a need
But certes if I might speed
With any manner business
Of worlds trauayl than I guess
There should me none ydelshyp
Depart from her ladyshyp
But this I see on days now
The blind god I wot not hou
Cupyde which of love is lord
He set the things in dyscord
That they that love lest attend
Full often he would hem give and send
Most of his grace and thus I find
That he that should goo behind
Goth many a time fer to fore
So wot^ I not right well therefore
On wheder board that I shall sey^e
Thus can I naught my self counseyle
But al I set on adventure
And am as who seyth out of cure
For ought that I can sey or do
For euermo I find it so
The more besynes that I lay
The more that I knele and pray
With good words and with soft^
The more I am refused often
With besynes and may not win
And in good feyth that is great sin
For I may sey of deed and thought
That ydel man have I ^e naught
For hou as ever that I be slayde
Yet evermore I have assayde
But though my besynes last
Al is but ydel at the last
When theffect is ydelnesse
I not what thing is business
Say what avails all the deed
Which helps no thing at need
For the fortune of every fame
Shall of his end lere a name
And for ought that is yet befalle
And ydel man I wol me call
And after mine entendement
But upon your amendment
Mine holy fadre as yen seems
My reason and my cause demeth
Mine sone I have herd the m^^^^
Of that thou haste the shryn^n here
And for to speak of ^ydel fare
Me seems that thou tharst not ^^^^
But only that thou might not speed
And thereof sone I wol the read
Abide and haste not to fast
Thy dies ben every day to cast
Thou nost what chance shall bety^^
Better is to wait upon the tide
Than row against the stremes strong
For though so be ye think long
^er caas the reuolucyon
Of heuene and thy condicyon
Ne be not yet of one acord
But I dar make this record
To venus whoos priest that I am
That sythen that I thither came
To here as she me bad thy life
Whereof thou else be gyltyf
Thou might hereof thy conscience
Excuse and of greet dylygence
Which thou to lone have so dyspended^
Thou ought well to be commended
But if so be that there ought fay^^
Of that thou slouthest to trauaylle
In arms for to be absent
And for thou make an argument
Of that thou saydest here above

Which is contrayre as thou shall wi^^
For this a man may find wryde

Whereof so as it comes to hand

Hou that a knight shall arms sewe
And for the while hi^ ^ase eschew

^on knythode I need thus
How whylome the king Na^ plus /
The fader of ^alamydes
Came for to preyen ^lyxes
With other Gregoys eke also
That he with hem to Troy goo
Where that the^syege* should be
Anon upon ^enelope
His wys whom that he loves hot
Thynkynde would not hem behote
But he shope than a wonder wyle
Hou that he should hem begyle
So that he might du^lle stylle
At home and weld his love at will
Whereof erly at the morrow day
Out o^^his bed where that he lay
When he was up / he began to fare
In to the field and look and stare
As he which feyneth to be wood
He took a plough where that it stood
Wheryn anon instead of Oxes
He let do yoken great Foxes
And with great salt the land he sewe
But Namplus which the cause knew
Ayene the sleyghte which he feyneth
Another sleyghte anon ordeyneth
And fell that time vlyxes had
A child to sone and namplus ^ad
Hou men that child take should
And set him upon the mold
Where that his fader held the plough
In thilk forugh which ^e tho drough
For in such wise he thought ossaye
Hou it vlyxes should pay
If that he were wood or none
The knights for the child forth gone
The lamacus anon was fett
To fore the ylough and even set
Where that his fadre should drive
But when he saw his child blyue
He droof the plough out of the weye
And Namplus tho bygan to seye
And has half in a iape cried
O vlyxes thou art aspyed
What is all this thou would mean
For openlyche it is now seen
That thou have feyned all this thing
Which is great shame to a king
When that for lust of any slouthe
Thou wylt a quarrel of truth
Of arms thylk honor forsake
And duelle at home for loves sake
For better it were honor to win
Than love which lykyng is inn
For thy take worship upon hand,
And else thou shall understand
These other worthy knights all
Of Greece which unto the call
Toward the wol be right wroth
And grieve the per chans both
Which shall be to the double shame
Most for the hyundrynge of thy name
That thou for slouthe of any love
Shall so thy lusts set above
And leave of Arms the knyghthode
Which is the price of thy manhood
And ought first to be desired
But he which had his heart fyred
Upon his wife when he this herd
Naught one word there ayeue ansuerd
But torneth him haluyng ashamed
And within him self so tamed
His heart that all the soty^
Of love for chyualrye
He left and be him leef or loath
To Troy with hem forth be goth
That he might not excuse
Thus stant it if a knight refuse
The lust of arms to travail
There may no worlds ease avail
But if worship be with all
And that showed has oueral
For it sit well in all wise
A knight to be of high empryse
And put al dread aweye
For in this wise I have herd seye

The worthy king Prothesalay
On his passage where he lay
Toward Troy thylk syege
She which was his own lyege
^^^domye his lusty wife
Which for his love was pensyf
As she which al her heart he had
Upon a thing which she^drad
A letter for to make him duelle
Fro Troy send him thus to tell
Hou she has axed of the wise
Touchend of him in such a wise
That they have done to understand
Toward other hou so it stand
The destyne it has so shape
That he shall not the death escape
^n c^^^ that he at^yue at Troy
For thy as to their worlds joy
With all her heart she him preyde
And many another cause alleyde
That he with her at home abide
But he has cast her letter a side
As ^e which tho no manner head
Took of her wommans dread
And forth he goth as naught ne were
To Troy and was the first there
Which ^ondeth and took ar^yuayle
For him was lever in the bataylle
He seyth to deyen as a^ knight
Than for to live in all his might
And be reproved of his name
Lo thus upon the worlds fame
Knyghthode has ever yet beset
Which with no cowardye is let

This worthy knight of his courage
Has undertake the vyage
And would naught his knyghthode let
For no peril he couthe set
Whereof that both his son and ^e
Upon the Mount of Gel^oe
Assemblen with here enemies
For they knyghthode of such a prys
By old days then helden
That they none other thing beh^lden

As men may in the bible read

aNd for to loken ouermore
It has and shall le evermore
That of knythode yt prowess
Is grounded upon hardynesse
Of him and that he wol undertake
And who that would ensample take
Upon the form of knights ^awe
Hou that Achilles was forth deawe
With Chyro which Centaurus hyt^
Of many a wonder lere he myght^
For it stood thylk time thus
That this Chyro this Centaurus
Within a large wilderness
Where was lion and Leoness:
The leopard and the Tygre also
With heart / hynd / buk / and do
Has his duellyng as tho byfelle
Of Pyleon upon the hell
Whereof was than mochel speech
There has Chyro this child to teache
What time he was of^^ twelve year age
Wherefore to maken his courage
The more hardy by other weye
In the forest tho to hunte and pleye
What time Achilles walk would
Cent^nrus bad that he ne should
After no be make his chaas
Which would fleen out of his place
As ba^^ do heart and Hynde
With which he may no we^^e find
But tho that would him withstonde
There should he with his dart on hand
Upon the Tygre and the Lion
Purchase and take his venyso^
As to a knight is acordaunt
And thereupon a covenant
This Chyro with Achilles set
That every day without let
He should seche a cruel best
Or fle or wounden at the lest
So that he might a tokne bring
Of blood upon his home coming
Thus that of Chyro him taught
Achilles such an heart caught
That he no more a lion drad
When be his dart on hond ^ad
Than if a lion were an ass
And that has made him for to pass
Al other knights of his deed
When it came to the great need
As it was afterward well know
Confessor
^o thus my sone thou might know
That the courage of hardyesse
Is of knyghthode the prowess
Which is to love suffysaunt
Abouen all the remenaunt
That unto loves court pursu^
But who that would no sloth eschew
Upon knyghthode and not travail
I not what love him should avail
But every labor a^eth why
Of sum reward whereof that I
Ensamples couthe tell enough
Of hem that toward love d^ough
By old days as they should
My fadre thereof here I would
My sone it would be reasonable
In place which is honorable
If that a man his heart set
That than he for no slouthe le^t
To do what longs to manhood
For if thou wolt the books read
Of ^auncelet and other mo
There might thou seen how it wa^ t^^
Of arms for they would atteyne
To love which is withouten pe^n^
May not be get of Pelnesse
And that I take to witness
An old Crony^^e in specyal
The which in to memoryal
Is write for his loves sake
Hou that a knight shall undertake
Hic dicit quod Miles priusquam amoris amplexu dignitatis efficiatur euentus
bellicos victoriosus amplecteve debet / et narrat qualiter Hercules et
achillous propter De^anitam Calidonie Regis Filiam singular duellum ad inuicem
^merunt* a^us victor Hercules existen ti^ armorum me^tis amorem virginie
^audabiliter conquestauit

hHer was a king which O^ne^
Was hot and he under pees
Held Calydonye in his empire
And had a d^ughter Deyanyre
M^n wist in thylk time none
^^ f^yre a wight as she was one
(...) she was a lusty wight
(...) ^o was than a noble knight
(...) mercurye fader was
This ^nyght the ^^o pylers of bras
T^^ which yet a man may find
Set v^ in the deserte of Inde
That was the worthy Hercules
Wh^s name shall be endeles
For the meruayles which wrought
This Hercules the love sought
Of Deyanyre and of this thing
Unto ^^r fadre which was king
He s^a^ touchend of marriage
The king knowend his hye lygnage
And drad also his myghtes stern
To him ne durst his daughter werne
And netheles this ^e him seyde
Hou Achylous or he first preyde
To wedden her and in acord
They stood as it was of record
But for all that this he him grau^teth
That which of hem that other dau^teth
In arms him she should take
And that the king has undertake
This Achy^bus was a geaunt
A subtyl man a deceyuaunt
Which thorugh magyke and sorcerye
Couthe all the world of Trecherye
And when he this tale herd
How that upon that the king ansuerd
With Hercules he must fight
He trusts naught upon his sleyght
Al only when it comes to need
But that which voydeth al dread
And every noble heart steryth
The love that no life forbereth
For his lady whom he desires
With hardyesse his heart fyreth
And send him word without fail
That he wol take the battle
They setten a day they chosen fesd^
The knights covered under shield
To gyder come at time set
And each one is with other met
It fell they foughten both on foot
There was no stone there was no rote
Which might letten hem the weye
But al was void and take a weye
They smyten strokes but a few
For Hercules which would show
His great strength as for the nones
He stert upon him al at ones
And caught him in his arms strong
This geaunt wot he may not long
Endure under so hard bonds
And thout he would out of his ho^des
By sleyghte in some manner escape
And a^s he couthe him self for shape
In likeness of an adder he slypt^
Out of his hond and forth he skypte
And efte as he that fight wole
He borneth him in to a bole
And began to belwe in such a soune
As though ye world should al go down
The ground he sporneth and he traunceth
His large horns he auaun^^th
And cast him here and there about
But he which stant of him no doubt
A wayteth well when that he came
And him by both horns nam
And al at ones he him cast
Upon the ground and held him fast
That he ne might with no sleyghte
Out of his hond get on heyghte
Till he was overcome and ^olde
And Hercules has what he would
The king hy^^ granted to fulfylle
His axyng at his own will
And she for whom he had served
Her thought he had well deserved
And thus with great deserte of arms
He wan her to lygge in arms
As he which has her dear abought
For otherwise should ^e naught
Not^ de pantasilia Ama^onie Regina que Hectoris amore colligata contra Pireum
Achillis filium apud Tro ^am arma far eciam specialiter non recusauit

And over this if thou wylt here
Upon knyghthode of this matere
Hou love and arms ben acqueynted
A man may see both write and peynted
So ferforth that pantasile
Which was the queen of Femyne
The love of Hector before to seek
And for thonou^ of arms eke
To Troy came with spear and shield
And rode her self in to the field
With maidens armed al a^oute
In rescous of the Town al about
Which with the greeks was byleyn
Nota qualiter Pholiphemeus propter mi^^cie famam a finibuo terre in
defensionem Troie veniens tres puellas a Regno Amaz^nie quoli^et anno perci

Fro paphagonye and as men seyn
Which stant upon the worlds end
That time it lyked eke to wend
Polyphemus which was king
To Troy and come upon this thing
In help of thylk noble Town
And al was that for the renoun
Of worship and of worlds fame
Of which he would bear a. name
And so he deed and forth with all
He wan of love in specyal
A fair Trybute for euermo
For it fell thylk time so
Pirrus the sone of Achilles
The worthy queen among the pres
With dedely swerd sought out and fond
And slough her with his own hond
Whereof this king of Paphagonye
Pantasile and to Amazo^ie
Where she was queen with him lad
With such maidens as she had
Of hem that were left alive
For in this ship till they aryue
Where that the body was bygraue
With worship and the women save
And for the goodness of this deed
They graunten him a lusty mede
That every year as for truage
To him and to his heritage
Of maidens fair he shall have three
And in this wise spedde ^e
Which the fortune of arms sought
With his travail his ease he bought
For other wise he should baue failed
If that he had naught trauayled
Nota pro ^o quod Eneas Regem Tur number in bello deuicit non folum amor^ ^auine /

Eneas eke within Itayle
Ne had wonnen the bataylle
And done his might so besyly
Ayene king Turn his enemy
He had naught soueyne won
But for he has him over run
He gat his p^ys and wan her love
By this ^nsample here above
^o now my sone as I have told
Thou might well see who that is bold
And dar travail and undertake
The cause of love he shall be take
The cather unto loves grace
For comonly^he in worthy place
The wommen louen worthynesse
Of manhood and of gentylnesse
For the gentyls be most desired
My fader but I were Inspyred
Thorugh low of you I wot no weye
What gentylnesse is for to seye
Whereof to tell I you beseech
Hic dicit quod Generosi in amoris can s^ se^ius preferuntur super quo querit
Amans quid si generositas / cuius veritatem questioni^ Confessor per singula
dissoluit

The ground my sone for to seche
^^^n this dyffynycyon
The ^^^ldes constytucyon
^ath sei the name of gentylnesse
^^^n the fortune of Richesse
Which of long time is fall in age
that is a man of high lygnage
Af^^r the fortune as thou might here
But no thing of the mat^re
For who that reason understand
V^on riches it may not stand
For that is thing which fails often
For he that stant to day alofte
And all the world has in his wones
To morrow he fallyth al at ones
Out of riches in to pouerte
So that thereof is no deserte
Which gentylnesse makes abide
And for to look on other side
Hou that a gentylman is bore
Adam which was al tofore
With Eve his wife as of hem two
Al was alyche gentyl tho
So that of generacyon
To make declaracyon
There may no gentylnesse be
For to the reason if we se
Of man's birth the mesure
It is so common of nature
That it y^ueth every man alyche
As well to the pour as to the rich
For naked they ben bore both
The lord has no more to clothe
As of him self that ylk through we
Than has the pourest of the row
And when they shall both pass
I not of hem which has the less
Of worlds good but of charge
The lord is more for to charge
When he shall his compte here
For he has had his lusts here
But of the body which shall deye
Al though there be diverse weye
To death yet is there but one end
To which that every man wend
As well the beggar as the lord
Of one nature of one acord
She which our elder mother is
The earth both that and this
Receives and al alyche denoureth
That she to another part favors
So wot I no thing after kind
Where I may gentylnes find
For lak of virtue lak of grace
Whereof Richesse in many place
When men wene best to stand
Al suddenly goth out of hand
But virtue set in the courage
There may no world be so saluage
Which might it take and done aweye
Till when that the body deye
Then he shall be ryched so
So that may fail neuermo
That it may well be gentylnesse
Which yeueth so great a sykernesse
For after the condycyon
Of reasonable intencyon
The which out of the soul grows
And the virtue from vice knows
Whereof a man the vice escheweth
Without slouthe and virtue seweth
That is very gentylman
And no thing else which he can
Ne which he has ne which he may
But for all that yet now a day
In loves court to taken head
The pour virtue shall not speed
That where the rich vice woweth
For selde it is that love allows
The gentylman without good
Though his condycyon be good
But if a man of both two
Be rich and virtuous also
Than is he well the more worth
But yet to put him self forth
He muse done his besynesses
For another good ne gentylnesse
May helpen hem which ydel be
But who that wo^ in his degree
Travail so as it belongs
It happeth often that he fongeth
Worship and ease both two
For ever yet it has be so
That love honest in sundry weye
Profyteth for it does aweye
The vice and as the books seyn
It makes curteys of the vyleyn
And to the Coward hardyesse
It yeueth so that very prowess
Is caused upon loves reule
To him that can manhood reule
And eke toward the womanhede
Who that thereof would taken head
For they the better affayted be
In every thing as men may see
For love both ever his lusts grene
In gentyl folk as it is seen
Which thing there may no kind arest
I trow that there is no best
That he with love should acqueynte
That he ne would make it queynte
As for the while that it last
And thus conclude at the last
That they ben ydel as me seems
Which unto thing that love demeth
For slouthen that they should do
And over this my sone also
To speak of love if I shall seek
After the virtue moral eke
Among the holy books wise
I find write in such a wise
Who loves not is here as deed
For love above al other is head
Which bath the virtues for to lead
Of all that unto man's deed
Belongs for of ydelshyp
He hates all the felaushyp
For slouthe is ever to despise
Which in dysdeyne has al appryse
And that acordeth not to man
For he that wit and reason can
It sit him well that he travail
Upon some thing which myt avail
For ydelshyp is not commended
But every law it has defended
And in ensamples thereupon
The noble wise Salamon
Which had of every thing insyght
Seyth as the birds to the flight
Be made so the man is bore
To labor which is naught forlore
To hem that thynken for to thryue
For we which are now alive
Of hem that besy whylome were
As well in scoles as else where
Now every day ensample take
That if it were now to make
Thing which first they founden out
It should not be brought about
Her lives then were longg
Here wits great her myghtes strong
Here virtues full of business
Whereof the worlds redynesse.
In body both and in courage
Stant ever upon his advantage
And for to draw in to memory
Her names both and her storye
Upon the virtue of her deed
In sundry books thou might read
Expedit in manibus labor vt de cotidiams* Actibus et vita viue^^ poseit homo /
Sed qui doctrine causa fert men te labores / Preualet et merita perpetu ata

Hic loquitur centra ^ciosos quoscu^que / et mayime co^tra istos qui

oF every wisdom the parfyt
The high god of his spyryt
Yafe to the men in earth here
Upon the form and the matere
Of that he would make him wise
And thus came in the first apryse
Of goods and of al good
Thorugh hem that whylome understood
The lore which to hem was give
Whereof these other that now live
But every day to learn new
But all the time that men sewe
And that the labor forth it brought
There was no corn though me^ it sout
In none of all the feldes out
And or the wisdom came about
Of hem that first tho books write
This may every wise man wit
There was great labor ^^e also
Thus was none ydel of the two
That on the plough has undertake
The labor which the land has take
That other took to study and muse
As he which would not refuse
The labor of his wits all
And in this wise it is befalle
Of labor what that they bygonne
We be now ^ought of that we conne
Here besynes is yet seen
That it stant ever alyche grene
Al be it so the body deye
The name of hem shall never aweye
In the Cronyke as I find
Cham whose labor is yet in mind
Was he which first the lettres fond
And wrote in bebrewe with his hand
Of naturel philosophye
He fond first also the clergy
Cadmus the lettres of gregoys
First made upon his own choys
Theges of thing that shall byfalle
He was the first angnrre of all
And Philemenon by the vysage
Fond to descryue the courage
Cladius Eldras and Sulpyces
Telmegis Panulf and Frigidylles
Menander Epyloquorus
Solius Pandar and Josephus
The first were of endytours
Of old Cronyke and eke auctours
And Heredot in his science
Of meter / of Ryme and of Cadence
The first was which men note
And of Musyke also the note
In man's voys / or soft or sharp
That fend Iubal / and of the harp
The merry soune which is to like
That fond polius forth with phisike
Zeuers fond first the portrature
And Promotheus the seulpture
After what form that hem thought
The resemblaunce anon they wront
Tubal in yren and in steel
Fond the forge and wrought it well
And Iadael as says the book
First made net and fysshes took
Of huntyng eke he fond the chase
Which now is know in many place
A tente for cold with cord and stake
He set up first and dyd'it make
Verconius the Coke^ye
First made the delycacye
The craft Myn^rae of wolle fond
And made clothe her own hand
And Dellora made it of line
Tho women were of great engyne
But thing which yeueth mete and drink
And does the labor for to swynk
To tylle the lands and set vynes
Whereof the corns and the wynes
Ben sustenaunce to mankind
In old books as I find
Saturnus of his own wit
Has found first and more yett
Of chapmenhode he fond the weye
And eke to coygne the money
Of sundry metal as it is
He was the first man of this
But hou that metal came a place
Thorugh man's wit and gods grace
The Route of Philosophres wise
Contreueden by sundry wise
First for to get it out of mine
And after for to try and fine
And also with great dylygence
They fond thylk experyence
Which cleped is Alconomye
Whereof the silver multyplye
They made and eke the gold also
And for to tell hou it is so
Of bodies seven in specyal
With four spyrytes joint with all
Stant the substance of this matere
The bodies which I speak of here
Of the planettes ben bygonne
The gold is tytled to the son
The moon of silver has his part
And Iren that stond upon Mart
The leed after Saturn grows
And Inbiter the ^ras bes^o weth
The Coper set is to Venus
And to his part Mercurius
Has the quyk silver as it falls
The which after the book it calls
Is first of ^hylk four named
Of spyrytes which ben proclaimed
And spyryte which is the second
In Sal Armonyak is found
The third spyryt Sulphur is
The fourth sewend after this
Antimonium by name is hot
With blowyng and with fyres hot
In these things which I say
They wo^then by diverse way
For as the Philosophre told
Of gold and silver they ben hold
Two pryncypal extremities
To which al other by degrees
Of the metalles ben acordyng
And so thorugh kind resemblyng
That what man couthe awey take
The ruste of which they woxen blake
And the savor of the hardness
They sholden take the likeness
Of gold and silver parfytely
But for to worche it sekerly
Between the corpse and the spyryte
Ex that the metal be parfyte
In seven forms it is set
Of al and if that one be let
The remenannt may not fail
But otherwise it may not avail
For they by whom this art was found
To every point a certain bound
Ordeynen that a man may find
This craft is wrout by wey of kind
So that there is no fable ^nne
But what man yt this werk legynne
He mote awayte at every tide
So that no thing be left a side
First of the dystyllacyon
Forth with the congellacyon
Solucyon Dyssencyon
And keep in his entencyon
The point of sublymacyon
And forth with Calcynacyon
Of very approbacyon
Do that there be fyxacyon
With temporat letre of the fire
Till be the parfyte Elyxer
Of thylk Philosophres stone
May get of which that many one
Of philosophres that whylome write
And if thou wolt the names wit
Of thylk stene with either two
Which as the clerks maden the
So as the books it recorden
The kind of hem I shall recorden
Nota de tribus lapidibus quos phi lcsophi compesuerunt. quorum primus ^apis
vegetabilis qiu sanitatem conser uat / Secundus dicitur lapis Animalis que
membra and virtutes sensibiles fortificat / Tercius dicitur lapis minera^^s que
omnia metalla purificat / et in suum perfectum naturali potencta de ^ucit /

tHese old Phylosophres wise
By weye of kind in sundry
Wise The stones made through clergy
The first I shall specyfye
Was Lapis Vegetabilis
Of which the propre virtue is
To man's bele for to serve
As for to keep and to preserve
The body fro sickness all
Till death of kind upon him fall
The second stone I the behote
Is ^apis Animalis hot
Wh^s virtue is propre and couthe
For erc and eye nose and mouth
Whereof a man may here and see
And smelle and taste in his degree
And for to feel and for to go
It helps a man of both two
The wits frue he under fongeth
To keep as it to him belongs
The third stone in fpecyal
By name is cleped myneral
Which the metals of every mine
Attempreth till that they be fine
And puts hem by such a weye
That all the vice goth aweye
Of rust of stynk and of hardness
And when they ben of such clennesse
This mynetal so as I find
Transformeth all the first kind
And makes hem able to conceive
Thorugh his virtue and to receive
Both in substance and in figure
Of gold and silver the nature
For they two ben thextremytees
The which after the propyrtees
Has every metal his desire
With help and comfort of the fire
And with this stone / as it is said
Which to the son and moan is laid
For to the read and to the white
This stone has power for to profit
It makes multyplycacyon
Of gold and the fyxacyon
It causes and of his habyte
He does the work to be^parfyte
Of thylk Elyxer which men call
Alconomye as it is byfalle
To hem that whylome were wise
But now it stant al other wise
They speken fast of thylk stone
But hou to make it know none
After the soth experyence
And netheles great dylygence
They setten upon thylk deed
And spyllen more than they speed
For alwey they find a let
Which brings in pouerte and debt
To hem that rich were to fore
The loss is had the lucre is lore
To get a pound they spend fyu^
I not hou such a craft shall thryue
In the manner as it is used
It were better be refused
Than for to worchen upon wene
In thing Which sta^t not as they went
But not for thy who that knew
The science of him self is true
Upon the form as it was founded
Whereof the names yet be grounded
Of hem that first it founded out
And thus the fame goth at about
To such as soughten business
To virtue and of worthynesse
Of whom if I the names call
Hermes was one of the first of all
To whom this art is most applied
Geber thereof was magnyfyed
And Ortolan and Maryen
Among the which is Auycen
Which fond and wrote a great party
The practyke of Alconomye
Whose books pleynly as they stand
Upon this craft few understand
But yet to putten in assay
There ben full many now a day
That known little what they mean
It is not one to wit and wene
In form of words they it trete
But yet they faylen of beyete
For of to much or of to lyte
There is algate found a wit
So that they follow not the line
Of the parfyte medycyne
Which grounded is upon nature
But they that written the scripture
Of Greek Arabe and Caldee
They were of such auctoryte
That they first founden out the weye
Of all that thou have herd me seye
Whereof the Cronyke of her lore
Shall stand in price for evermore
But toward our marches here
Of the latyns if thou wolt here
Of hem that whylome virtuous
Were and thereto laboryous
Carment made of here engyne
The first lettres of latyne
Of which the tongue Romayne came
Whereof that Arystarchus nam
Forth with Donat and Dyndymus
The first reule of scole and thus
How that latin shall be compowued
And what wise it shall be souned
That every word in his degree
Shall stand upon congruyte
And thylk time of Rome also
Was Tullyus with Cythero
That written upon Rethoryke
How that men shall the words pyke
After the form of eloquence
Which is men seyn a great prudence
And after that out of he bre^^e
Jerome Which the langage knew
The bible in which the law is closed
In to latin he has transposed
And many another writer eke
Out of Caldee Arabe and Greek
With great labor the books wise
Ttanslateden and another wise
The latyns of hem self also
Here study at thylk time so
With great trauayl of scole took
In sundry form for to look
That we may take here euydence
Upon the lore of the science
Of crafts both and of clergy
Among the which in poesye
To the lovers Ouyde wrote
And taught of love to be hot
In what manner it should akele
Confessor
For thy my sone if that thou feel
That love bring the tofore
Behold Ouyde and take his lore
My fadre if they might speed
My love I would his books read
And if they techen to restreyne
My love it were an ydel pain
To learn a thing which may not be
For lyche unto a grene tree
If that men took his rote aweye
Right so my heart should deye
If that my love be withdraw
Whereof touchend unto this saw
There is but only to pursewe
My love and ydelshyp to esche we
My good son soth to seye
If there be syker any weye
To love thou have said the best
For who that wol have al his rest
And do no treuayle at need
It is no reason that he speed
In loves cause for to win
For he Which dare no thing begin
I not what thing he should ^cheue
But over this thou shall believe
So as it sit the well to know
That there ben other vices slow
Which unto love done great let
Is thou thyn heart upon hem set
^erdit homo causam linquene sua iu^^ seperi / Et quasi dimidtum pars su^
mortis habet / Est in amore vigil venus et quam habet vigilanti / Obsequium
thalamis fert vigilata suis

Hic loquitur de Sompnelencia que Ac^idie Cameraria dicta est / cuius natura
semunortua alicuius negocij vigi l^as obser^are seperi fero torpere recus^r /
vnde quatenus amorem concernit Confessor Amanti diligencius opponit

tOward the slow progenye
There is yet one of Company
And he is cleped So^pnole^ice
Which death to slouthe his reverence
^^ he which is his Chamberleyn
That many an honderd time has leyn
To sleep when he sheld wake
He has with love tre^^es take
That wake who so wake will
If he may couche a deune his bylle
He has al what him list
That often he goth to bed vnkyst
And says that for no druerye
^^ wol not leave his sluggardye
For though yt noman it would allow
To sleep lever than to wowe
Is his manner / and thus on nyghtes
When he sees the lusty knights
Re^^len where these women are
Awey he seulketh as an hare
And goth to ^^dde and leyth him soft
And of his sleuthe ^e dremeth often
Hou that he siyketh in the mire
And hou he sytteth by the fire
And claweth on his bare shankes
And hou he clymeth up the banks
And fallyth in the slades deep
But than who so takes keep
When he is fall in such a dreme
Right as a ship against the streme
He routeth with a slepy noise
And brustleth as a monks froyse
When it is throw in to the pan
And other while selde when
That he may dreme a lusty sweuene
Him thinks as though he were in
heuene / And as ye world were holy his
And than he speaks of that and this
And makes his exposycyon
After his dysposycyon
Of that he would and in such a wise
He does to love al his service
I not what thank he shall deserve
But sone but if thou wolt love serve
I read that thou do not so
A good fadre certes no
I had lever by my truth
Er I were set on such a slouthe
And bear such a slepy snoute
Both eyes of my head were out
For me were better fully dey^
Than I of such sluggardye
Had any name god me shield
For when my modre was with chil^e
As I lay in her womb cloos
I would rather Antropos
Which is goddess of death
Anon as I had any breath
Me had fro my mother cast
But now I am no thing aghast
I thank god for lachesys
^e cleto which here felawe is
Me shopen no such destyne
When they at my Natyuyte
My werdes setten as they would
But they shopen that they should
Eschew of sleep the truandyse
So that I hope in such a wise
To love for to ben excused
That I no sompnolence have used
For certes fadre Genius
Yet unto now it has be thus
At al time if it befelle
So that I might come and duelle
In place there my lady were
I was not slo^^e ne slepy there
For than I dar well undertake
That when her list on nyghtes wake
In chamber as to carole and dance
Me thinks it may me more auaunce
If I may gone upon her hand
Than if I win a kings land
For when I may her hond beclyppe
With such gladness I dau^ce and skyppe
Me thinks I touch not the floor
The Roo which renneth on the moor
Is than naught so light as I
So mow ye wyten al for thy
That for the time sleep I hate
And than it fallyth other gate
So that her lyketh not to dance
But on the dies to cast the chance
Or axe of love sum demand
Or else that her list command
To read and here of Troylus
Right as she wol or so or thus
I am already to consent
And if so is that I may hente
Sometime among a good leyser
So as I dar of my desire
I tell a part but when I preye
Anon she byddeth me go my weye
And seyth it is far in the night
And I swear it is even light
But as it falls at the last
There may no worlds joy last
So mote I needs fro her wend
And of my watch make an end
And if she than head took
How pytously on her I look
When that I shall my leave take
Her ought of mercy for to slake
Her danger which says ever nay
But he seyth often have good day
That loath is for to take his leave
Therefore while I may believe
I tarry forth the night a long
For it is naught on me along
To sleep that I so sone go
Till I mote need algate so
And that I bid god her see
And so down knelend on my knee
I take leave / and if I shall
I kiss her and goo forth with all
And otherwhyle if that I door
Er I come fully to the door
I torn ayene and feyne a thing
As though I had lost a ryng
Or somewhat else for I would
Kiss her eftsoon if I should
But seldom is that I so speed
And when I see that I mote need
Depart I depart and thanne
With all my heart I curse and banne
That ever sleep was made for eye
For as me thinks I mote dry
Without sleep to Waken ever
So that I should not dysseuer
Fro her in whom is al my light
And than I curse also the night
With all the will of my courage
And say awey thou black image
Which of thy derck cloudy face
Makes all the worlds light deface
And causes unto sleep awey
By which I mote now gone aweye
Out of my lady company
O slepy night I the defye
And would that thou lay in press
With Proserpyne the goddess
And with Pluto the hell king
For till I see the day spryng
I set by sleep not a rysshe
And with that word I syghe and wysshe
And sey why ne were it day
For yet my lady than I may
Behold though I do no more
And efte I think forthermore
To sum man hou the night does ease
When he has thing yt may him please
The long nyghtes by his side
Where as I fail and goo beside
But sleep whereof I not it serves
Of which noman his thank deserves
To get hem love in any place
But it is an hynderer of his grace
And makes hem deed as for a throw
Right as a stok were overthrow
And so my fadre in this wise
The slepy nyghtes I despise
And ever a mids of my tale
I think upon the nyghtyngale
Which slepeth not by wey of kind
For love in books as I find
Thus at the last I goo to bed
And yet mine heart lies to wedde
With s^r ^bere as I came fro
Though I depart I w^l not so
There is no bock may shet him out
Him needs naught to gone about
That perce may the hard wall
Thus is ^e with her oueral
That be her ^ef or be it both
In to her bed mine heart goth
And softely takes her in his arm
And feleth hou that she is warm
And wyssheth also his body were
Tho to feel that he felyth there
And thus my self I tormente
Till that the deed sleep me hente
But than by a thousand score
Well more than I was to fore
I am tormented in my sleep
But what I dreme is not on sheep
For I ne thynk on no wulle
But I am dretched to the fulle
Of love that I have take to keep
That now I laugh and now I weep
And now I lose and now I win
And now I end and now begin
And otherwhyle I dreme and m^te
That I alone with her mete
And that danger is left behind
And than I sleep such joy I find
That I ne bid never awake
But after when I heed take
And shall arise upon the morrow
Than is al turned in to sorrow
Naught for the cause I shall arise
But for I met in such a wise
And at the last I am bethought
That al is wine and helps naught
But yet me thinks by my will
I would have ley and sleep stylle*
To meten ever of such a sweuen^
For than I had a slepy heuene
Confessor
My sone and for thou tellyst so
A man may find of time ago
That many a sweuene has be certain
Al be it so that some men seyn
That sweuenes be of no credence
But for to show in euydence
That they full often soth things
By tokne I thynk in my wrytynges
To tell a tale thereupon
Which fell by old days gone
hIc ponit exemplum qualiter pre nostice veritatis quandeque certitudine^
figurant / Et narrat quod cum Ceix Rex Trocinie pro reformacione fratr^s sui
Dedalionis in Ancipit^em transmutati peregre proficiscens m^^ar^ lo^giue a
patria dimersus fucrat / ^uno mittens ^ridem nunciam suam in parts Chimerie ad
domum sompni iussit quod ipse Alceone dicti Regis vxori huius rei euentum per
sompnia certificaret / Quo facto Al^^ona rem perscrutans / corpus mariti suij
vbi super fluctus mortuus iactabatur inuenit / que pro do lore augustiata
cupiens corpus amplec tere in altum mare super Ipsum prosi^^it, vnde dij
miserti amborum corpora in aues que ad huc Alceones dicte sunt / subito
conuerterunt

tHis find I written in poesy
Ceyx the king of Trocenye
Had Alceon to his wife
Which as her own hertes life
Him loves and he has also
A brother which was cleped tho
Dedalyon and he par caas
Fro kind of man forshape was
In to a goshauk of likeness.
Whereof the king great heaviness
Has take and ^thought in his courage
To gone upon a pylgremage
In a strange Regyon
Where he has his devotion
To done his sacryfyce and preye
If that he might in any weye
To wards the gods find grace
His broders hele to purchase
So that he might be reformed
Of that he has been transformed
To this purpos and to this end
This king is ready for to wend
As he which would go to ship
And for to done him felaushyp
His wife unto the sea him brought
With all her heart and him besought
That he the time her would seyn
When that he thought come again
Within he says two monethis day
And thus in all the have he may
He took his leave and forth he sayleth
Wepend / and she her self bewayleth
And torneth there she came fro
For when the months were ago
The which he set of his coming
And that she herd no tydyng
There was no care for to seche
Whereof the gods to byseche
Tho she bygan in many wise
And to Juno her sacryfyce
Above al other most she deed
And for her lord she has so bid
To wit and know hou that he ferd
That Juno the gods herd
Anon and upon this matere
She Irys bad her messagyer
To slepes house that she should wend
And bid him that he make an end
By sweuene and shown all the caas
To this lady hou it was
This Irys fro the high stage
Which undertake has the message
His reyny cope deed upon
The which was wonderly begone
With colors of dyners hew
An honderd mo than men knew
The heuene lyche unto a bow
She bend / and she came done low
The god of sleep where that she fond
And that was in a strange land
Which marches upon Chymery^
For there as seyth the poesye
The god of sleep has made his house
Which of entaylle is meruaylous
Under an hylle there is a cave
Which of the son may not have
So yt no man may not know ary^t
The point between day and night
There is no fire there is no spark
There is no door which may chark
Whereof an eye should vnshet
So that inward there is no let
And for to speak of that without
There stant no great tree nyhe about
Whereon there might crow or pie
A light for to clepe or cry
There is no cost to crow day
Ne best none which noise may
The hylle / but al about round
There is growend upon the ground
Popy. which bears the seed of sleep
With other herbs such an hepe
A stylle water for the nones
Rennend upon the small stones
Which hight of ^ethes the River
Under the hylle in such manner
There is which yeueth great appetyte
To sleep and thus full of delight
Sleep has his house and of his couche
Within his chamber if I shall touch
Of Hebenus that slepy tree
The boordes al about be
And for he should sleep soft
Upon a fether bed alofte
He lies with many a pylwe of down
The chamber is strowed up and down
With sweuenes many a thousand fold
Thus come Irys in to this hold
And to the bed which is blak
She goth and therewith sleep she spak
And in this wise as she was bid
The message of Juno she deed
Full o^^ her words she reherseth
Er she his slepy eres perseth
With much woo. but at the last
His slomerend eyes he vpcast
And said her that it shall bedoo
Whereof among a thousand tho
Within his house that slepy were
In specyal he chese out there
Three which should do this deed
The first of hem so as I read
Was Morpheus the whose nature
Is for to take the figure
Of what person that him lyketh
Whereof that he thereof entryketh
The life which sleep shall by night
And Ithecus that other hight
Which has the voys of every soune
Their chere and their condycyoun
Of every life what so is
The third / sewend after this
Is Pantafas which may transform
Of every thing the right form
And change it in another kind
^^on hem three as I find
Of sweuenes stant al thapparence
Which otherwhyle is euydence
And other while but a iape
But netheles it is so shape
That Morpheus by night allone
A wereth unto Alceone
In likeness of her husbond
Al naked deed upon the stronde
And hou he dreynt in specyal
These other two it she wen shall
The tempest of the blak cloud
The wode see the wyndes loud
All this met she and saw him dyen
Whereof that she bygan to cryen
Slepend a bed there she lay
And with that noise of her affraye
Her women stert up about
Which of her were in doubt
And axen her hou that she ferde
And she right as she saw and herd
Her sweuen has told hem every dele
And they it halsen al well
And seyn it is a tokne of good
But till she wist hou it stood
She has no comfort in her heart
Upon the morrow and up she sterte
And to the sea where as she met
The body lay without let
She drough and when that she came nygh
Stark deed his arms sprad she syghe
Her lord fletend upon the wawe
Whereof her wits be withdraw
And she which took of death no keep
Anon forth lepte in to the deep
And would have caut him in her arm
This infortune of double harm
The gods from the heaven above
Beheld / and for the truth of love
Which in this worthy lady stood
They have upon the salt flood
Her dreynt lord and her also
Fro death to life turned so
That they be shapen in to birds
Swymme^d upon the wawe amyddes
And when she saw her lord lyuend
In likeness of a byrd swymmend
And she was of the same sort
So as she might do dysport
Upon the joy which she had
Her wings both anon she sprad
And him both so as she may suffyse
Be^lypte and kyst in such a wise
As she was whylome wont to do
Her wings for byr arms tho
She took and for her lyppes soft
Her hard bylle and so full often
She fondeth in her birds form
If that she might her self conform
To do the plesaunce of a wife
As she did in that other life
For though she had her power lore
Her will stood as it was to fore
And serves so as she may
Whereof in to this ylk day
To geder upon the sea they wone
Where many a daughter and a sone
They bryngen forth of birds kind
And for men should take in mind
This Alceon the true queen
Her birds as it is seen
Of Alceon the name bear
Lo thus it may the stere
Of sweuenes for to take keep
For oftyme a man a sleep
May see what after shall betyde
For thy it helps at some tide
A man to sleep as it belongs
But slouthe no life vnderfongeth
Which is to love appertenaunt
My fader upon covenant
I dare well make this auo we
That al my life in to now
As ferforth as I can understand
Yet took I never sleep on hand
When it was time for to wake
For though mine eye it would take
Mine herd is ever there again
But nevertheless to speak it pleyne
All this that I have said you here
Of my wakyng as ye may here
It touches to my lady sweet
For otherwise I you byhete
In strange place when I go
Me list no thing to wake so
For when the women list to play
And I her see not in the way
Of whom I should myrthe take
Me list not long for to wake
But if it be for pure shame
Of that I would eshewe a name
That they ne should have cause none
To seye / A loo where such one
That has forlore his contenaunce
And thus among I sing and dance
And feyne lust there none is
Fulofte sith I fete this
Of thought which in mine heart falls
When it is night mine heart appallyth
And that is for I see her naught
Which is the waker of my thought
And thus as tymelyche as I may
Full often when it is brood day
I take of al these other heue
And goo my wey and they believe
That seen pe^ caas her loves there
And I goo forth as naught ne were
Unto my bed so that alone
I may there lygge syghe and groan
And wysshen all the long night
Till that I see the days light
I not if that be sompnolence
But upon your conscience
Mine holy fader demeth ye
My sone I am well paid with the
Of sheep that thou the sluggardye
By night in loves company
Esche west have and thy pain
So that thy love dare not pleyne
For love upon his lust wakend
Is ever and would that none end
Thereof the long night is set
Whereof that thou be ware the bett
To tell a tale I am bethought
How love and sleep acorden naught
Hic dicit quod vigilia in Amantibus and non sompnolencia laudanda est Et ponit
Exemplum de Cephal^ filio Phebi qui nocturno silencio Auroram amicam suam
diligencius amplectens solemn and lunam interpellabat * videlicet quod sol in
circulo ab orie^te distanciori currum cum luce sua retardaret et quod luna
spera sua longissima orbem circuiens noctem continuaret / Ita vt Ipsum Cephalum
amplexibus amore volutum priusquam illa dies illucesceret suis deliciis
adquiescere diucius permittere dignarentur

fOr love who that list to wake
By nyt he may ensa^yle take
Of Cephalus when yt he lay
With Aurora the sweet may
In arms all the long night
But when toward the light
That he with in his* heart sye
The day which was the morrow nyhe
Anon unto the son he preyde
For lust of love and thus he seyde
Phoebus which the days light
Governs till it be night
And gladest every creature
After the law of thy nature
But netheles there is a thing
Which onlyche to thy knoulechyngr
Belongs / as in pryuete
To love and to his dute
Which oxeth not to ben a part
But in silence and in covert
Desires for to be shadyd
And thus when that the lyt is faded
And vesper she weth him alofte
And that the night is long and soft
Under the clouds derste and stylle
Than has thing most of his will
For thy unto thy myghtos high
As thou which art the days eye
Of love and might no counseyl hyde
Upon this derk nyghtes tide
With all mine heart I the byseche
That I plesaunce might seche
With her which syeth in mine arms
Withdraw the baner of thyn arms
And sete thy lyghtas ben unborn
And in the sign of Caprycorne
The house appropred to Saturn
I preye the that thou wolt soiourne
Where ben the nyghtes derk and long
For I my love have vnderfonge
Which lies here by my side naked
As she which would ben a waked
And me list no thing for to sleep
So were it good to take keep
Now at this time of my prayer
And that the like for to stere
This fyry cart and so ordeyne
That thou thy swyft horse restreyne
Low under earth in occydent
That they toward thorrent
By scr^le go the long were
And eke to the Dyane I preye
Which cleped art of thy noblesse
The nyghtes moan and the Goddess
That thou to me be gracyous
And in Can^eo thyn own house
Ayene Phoebus in opposyte
Stond all this time and in delight
Byholde Venus with a glad eye
For than upon Astronomye
Of due coustellacyon
Thou makeste profyfycacyon
And do that children be begete
Which if that I might get
With all mine heart I wolserue
By night and thy vygylle observe
Loo thus this lusty Sephalus
Prayed unto Phebe and to Phoebus
The night in length for to draw
So that he might do the law
In thylk point of loves heste
Which cleped is the nyghtes feste
Withouten sleep of sluggardye
Which Venus out of company
Has put awey as thylk same
Which lustles fer from game
In chamber does full often woo
A bed when it falls so
That love should be awayted
But slouthe which is evil affayted
With sleep has made his retenue
That what thing is to love due
Of al his debt he pays none
He wot not hou the night is gone
Ne hou the day is come about
But only for to sleep and route
Till high mydday that he arise
But Sephalus did otherwise
As thou my son host herd above
Amans
My fader who that has his love
A bed naked by his side
And would than his eyes hyde
With sleep / I not what man is he
But certes as touchend of me
That fell me never yet or this
But other while when so is
That I may catch sleep on hand
Lyggend alone than I fond
To dreme a merry sweuene or day
And if* so fall that I may
My thought with such a sweuen plese
Me thynst I am somdele in ese
For I none other comfort have
So needs naught that I shall crave
The sons carte for to tarry
Ne yet the moon that she carye
Here course a long upon the heuene
For I am naught the more in huene
To worlds good in no degree
But in my sleep yet than I see
So^what in sweuene of that me lyketh
Which afterward mine heart enteyketh
When that I find it otherwise
So wot I not of what service
What sompnolence to man does
My sone certes thou say soth
But only that it helps kind
Sometime in Physyk as I find
When it is take by mesure
But he which can no sleep mesure
Upon the reule as it belongs
Full often of sodeyne chance he fongeth
Such infortune that him greueth
But who these old books leueth
Of Sompnolence hou it is write
There may a man the sothe wit
If that he would ensample take
That other while is good to wake
W^^rof a tale in Poesye
I think for to specyfye
Hic loquitur in amoris causa co^ tra istos qiu so^pnolencie dediti ca que
seruare tenentur amittunt / Et narrat ^ cum Yo puella pulcherrima a Iunone in
vaccam transformata and in argi custodiam sic deposita fuisset / superuemens
mercurius Argum dormientem occidit vt ipsam vaccam a pastura rapiens quo voluit
secum perduxit

oVyde thus tells in his sawes
Hou Jupiter by old days
Lay by a maid which is
Was cleped whereof that Juno
His wife was wroth and the goddess
Of yo turned the likeness
In to a Cow to goo there out
The large feldes al about
And get her mete upon the grene
And thereupon this high queen
Betook her Argus for to keep
For he was seldon wont to sleep
And yet he had an honderd eyes
And al alyche well they sym
Now herkne hou he was begyled
Mercurye which was al affyled
This Cow to stele he came desguysed
And had a pype well devised
Upon the notes of musyke
Whereof he might his eres like
And over that he had affayted
His lusty tales and awayted
His time and thus in to the field
He came where Argus he beheld
With yo which beside him went
With that his pype anon he hent
And began to pype in his manner
Thing which was slepy for to here
And in his pypyng ever among
He told him such a lusty song
That he the fool has brought a sleep
There was none eye that might keep
His head which mercurye of smote
And forth with all anon foot hot
He stal the Cow which Argus kept
And all this fell for that he slept
Ensample it was to many mo
That mochel sleep does often woe
When it is time for to wake
For if a man this vice take
In sompnolonce and him delight
Men should upon his door write
His Epytaphe as upon his grave
For he to spylle and naught to save
Is shaped / and though he were deed
For thymy sone hold up thyn heds
And let no sleep thine eye englue
But when it is to reason due
My fader as touchend of this
Right so as I you told it is
That often a bed when I should
I may not sleep though I would
For love is ever fast byme
Which takes none head of due* time
For when I shall mine eye close
A none my heart he wol oppose
And hold his scole in such a wise
Till it be day that I arise
That selde it is when that I sleep
And thus fro sompnolence I keep
Mine eye / and for thy if there be
Ought else more in this degree
Now axe forth my sone yis
For slouthe which as mother is
The forth drawer* and the Noryce
To man to many a dredeful vice
Has yet another last of all
Which many a man has made to fall
Where that he might never arise
Whereof thou the shall auyse
Er thou so with thy self mysfare
What vice it is I wol declare
Nil fortuna iuuat vbi desperacid ^^dit / Quo desiccat humor non viridesat
humus / magnanimus sed amor s^em ponit and inde salutem* Co^sequitur ^ (...)
prospera fata fauent

Hic loquitur super vltima specie acadie / que Tristicia sieve desperacio
dicitur / auus olstinata condicio tocius con solacionis spem deponens alicuius
remed^ quo kberari poterit fortunam sib^ euenire impossible credit

When slouthe does al yt he may
To drive forth the long day
Till he bycome to the need
Then at last upon the deed
He laketh hou his time is lore
And is so woo begone therefore
That he within his thought conceyueth
Trystesse and so him self deceyueth
That he wanhope brings Inn
Where is no comfort to begin
But every joy him is dylayed
So that within his heart affrayeth
A thousand time with one breath
Wepend he wyssheth after death
When he fortune fynt adverse
For than he wol his hap reheree
As though the world were al forlore
And says Allas that I was lore
How I shall live how shall I do
For now fortune is my foo
I wot well god me wol not help
What should I than of joy yelpe
When there no bote is of my care
So over cast is al my welfare
That I am shapen al to stryf
Allas that I never of this life
Or I be fullyche overtake
And thus he wol his sorrow make
As god him might not avail
But yet ne wol he not travail
To help him at such a need
But slouteth under such a dread
Which is affermed in his heart
Right as he might naught asterte
The worlds woo which he is Inn
Also when he is fall in sin
Him thinks he is so fer culpable
That god wol not be mercyable
So great a sin to foryeue
And thus he leueth to be shryue
And if a man in thylk throw
Would him counsel, he wol not know
The soth though a^man it find
For trystesse is of such a kind
That for to mayntene his fely
He has with him obstynacy
Which is within of such a slouthe
That he forslaketh al truth
And wol not to no reason bo we
And yet he can not allow
His own skylle / but of head
Thus dwyneth he till he be deed
In hyndryng of his own estate
For where a man is obstynate
When hope follows at the last
Which may not long after last
Till slouthe make of him an end
But god wot whether he shall wend
My sone and right in such manner
There be lovers of heavy chere
That sorowen more than it is need
When they be turned of their speed
And can not them self read
But lesen hope for to speed
And stynten love to pursewe
And thus they faden hyde and hew
And lustles in her hertes wax
Hereof it is that I would axe
If thou my sone art one of tho
A good fadre it is so
Out take a point I am be know
For else I am overthrow
In all that ever ye have said
My sorrow is evermore vnteyd
And secheth oueral my veins
But for to counseylle of my peynes
I can no bote do thereto
And thus withouten hope I goo
So that ^y wits ben empeyred
And I am as who said despeyred
To win love of thylke sweet
Without whom I you behete
Mine heart that is so bestad
Right only may never be glad
For by my truth I shall not lie
Of pure sorrow which I dry
For that she says / she wol me naught
With dretchyng of mine own though
In such a wanhope I am fall
That I ne can uneaths call
As for to speak of any grace
My lady grace to purchase
But yet I say naught for this
That al in mine defaulte it is
For I am never yet instead
When time was that I me bid
Ne said and as I dorst told
But never fond I that she would
For ought she knew mine intent
To speak a goodly word assent
And netheles this dar I seys
That if a synful would preys
To god for his foryeuenesse
With half so great a business
As I have do to my lady
In lak of axyng of mercy
He should never come in hell
And thus I may you sothly tell
Sauf only that I ceye and bid
I am in trystesse al amydde
And fulfilled of dysperaunce
And therefore give me my penance
Mine holy fader as you lyketh
My sone of that thy heart syketh
With sorrow might thou not amend
Till love his grace wol the send
For thou thine own cause empeyrese
What time yt thou thy self dyspeyrest
I uot what other thing avails
Of hope when the heart fails
For such a soor is Ina^rable
And eke the gods ben vengeable
And that a man may right well feed
These old books who so read
Of thing which has byfalle or this
Now here of what ensample it is
Hic narrat qualiter Iphis Re gis Theucri filius ob amore in cuuisda^ puelle
nomine Araxarathen quam ne que donis aut precibus vincere potuit / des perans
ante patris ipsius ianuas noctanter se suspendit / vnde dij comoti dic tam
puellam in lapidem durissuuam transmutarunt / quam Rex Theucer vna cum filio
suo apud ciuitatem Sala minam in Templo veneris pro perpetua memoria sepeliri
and locari fecit

wHylome by old days fer
Of mese was ye king theucer
Which had a knyt to son iphis
Of love and ^e so mastred is
That he has set al his courage
As to regard of his lygnage
Upon a maid of low astate
But though he were a potestate
Of worlds good he was subgett
To love and put in such a plyte
That excedeth the mesure
Of reason that him self assure
He can naught / for the more he prayed
The less love on him she laid
He was with love un wise co^streyned
And she with reason was with streyned
The lusts of his heart he seweth
And she for dread shame esche weth
And as she should took head
To save and keep her womanhede
And the thing stood in debate
Between his lust and here estate
He yaue / he send / he spak by mouth
But yet for ought that ever he couth
Unto his speed he fond no weye
So that he cast his hope aweye
Within his heart he began dyspeyre
Fro day to day and so^ empeyre
That he has lost al his delight
Of lust of sleep of appetyte
That he through strength of sone lasseth
His wit and reason over passes
As he which of his life ne tought
His death upon him self he sought
So that by night his weye he nam
That wist none where he bycam
The night was derk the moon shone
To fore the gates he came sone
Where that this young maid was
And with this woeful word allas
His dedely pleyntes he bygan
So stylle that there was noman
It herd and than he said thus
O thou Cupyde / O thou Venus
Fortuned by whoos ordenaunce
Of love is every man's chance
Ye known al mine hole heart
That I ne may your hondes asterte
On you is ever that I cry
And yet you deyneth not to plye
Ne toward me your ere enclyne
Thus for I see no medycyne
To make an end of my quarele
My death shall be instead of hele
Ha thou my woeful lady dear
Which duellest with thy fadre here
And slepest in thy bed at ese
Thou wotest no thing of my dysese
How thou and I be now unmeet
A lord what sweuene shall thou mete
What dremes have thou now on hond
Thou slepest there and here I stond
Though I no death to the deserve
Here shall I for thy love sterue
Here shall I a kings sone* deye
For love and for no felonye
Whether thou thereof have joy or sorrow
Here shall thou me see deed to morrow
O hard heart abouen all
This death which shall to me fall
For that thou wolt not do me grace
It shall be told in many place
That I am deed for love and truth
In thy defaulte and in thy slouthe
Thy danger shall to many mo
Ensample be for euermo
When they the woeful death record
And with that word he took a cord
With which upon the gate tree
He henge him self that was pity
The morrow came the night is gone
Men come out and syghe anon
Where that this young lord was deed
There was an house without deed
For noman knew the cause why
There was weeping there was cry
This maiden when she it herd
And saw this thing hou it mysferd
Auone she wist what it mente
And all the cause hou it went
To all the world she told it out
And preyth hem that were about
To take of her the wngeaunce
For she was cause of thylk chance
Why that this kings sone is spy^t
She takes upon her self the gylt
And is al ready to the pain
Which any man her wol ordeyne
But if any other would
She says that her self she should
Do wreche with her own hond
Thorugh out the world in* every lo^d
That every life thereof shall speak
Hou she her self it should wreke
She wepeth she cries she swouneth often
She cast her eyes up alofte
And said among full pytously
A god thou wost well it am I
For Iphis is thus byseyn
Ordeyne so that many may seyn
A thousand winter after this
Hou such a maiden did amys
And so as I did do to me
For I ne did no pity
To him which for my love is lore
Do no pity to me therefore
And with this word she fell to grosid
A swoune and there she lay astound
The gods which her pleyntes herd
And saw hou woefully she ferde
Here life awey they took anon
And shopen here in to a stone
After the form of her image
Of body both and of vysage
And for the meruaylle of this thing
Unto the place came the king
And eke the queen and many mo
And when they wysten it was foo
As I have told it here above
Hou that Iphys was deed for love
Of that he had be refused
They helden al men excused
And wondren upon the vengeance
And for to keep remembrance
This fair image maiden lyche
With company noble and rich
With torches and with great solempnyte
To Salamyne the Cite
They led and carye forth with all
This deed corpse and seyn it shall
Beside thylk Image have
His sepulture and be begraue
This corpse and this Image thus
In to the Cite to Venus
Where that goddess her Temple had
To geder both forth they lad
Thylke Image as for miracle
Was set upon an high pynacle
That al it might know
And under that they maden low
A tomb rich for the nones
Of marble and eke of Iaspre stones
Wheryn this Iphys was byloken
That evermore it shall be spoken
And for men shall the sothe wit
They have here Epytaphe write
As thing which should abide stable
The lettres granen in a Table
Of marble were and said this
Here lies which slou him self Iphis
For love of Araxarathen
And in eusample of tho women
That suffren men to dyen so
His form a man may seen also
Hou it is turned flesh and bone
In the figure of a stone
He was to nesshe and she hard
Beware for thy here afterward
Ye men and women both two
Ensampleth you of that was tho
Loo thus my sone as I the seye
It greueth by diverse weye
In despeyr a man to fall
Which is the last branch of all
Of slouthe as thou have herd deuyse
Whereof that thou thy self auyse
Good is or that thou be deceived
Whereof the hope of grace is weyued
My fadre hou so that it stand
Nou have I pleynly understand
Of slouthes court the propyrte
Whereof touchend in my degree
For ever I thynk to be ware
But over this so as I dare
With all mine heart I you byseche
That ye me would inform and teache
What there is more of your apryse
In love als well as other wise
So that I may me clean shryue
Confessor
My son while thou art alive
And have also thy full mind
Among the vices which I find
There is yet one such of the seuene
Which all this world has set vneuene
And causes many times wrong
Where he the cause has vnderfong
Whereof here after thou shall here
The form both and the matere
Expliat Liber Quartus
Incipit Liber Quintus
o^stat Auaricia nature legibus et que / Largue amor poscit strict^^e illa
vetat / Omne quod est nimium vi c^osum dicitur auru^ / Vellera sicut oues
seruat auarus opes / Non decet vt soli ser^abitur os sed amori / Debet homo so
lam solus habere suam /

fIrst when the high god began /
This world and that the kind of man /
Was fall in to no great encrees /
For worlds good was tho no prees /
But al was set to the comune /
They speken than of no fortune
Or for to lose or for to win
Till Auaryce brought Inn
And yt was when ye world was woye
Of man of hoar of sheep of Ox
And that men knewen the money
Tho went pees out of the weye
And werre came on every side
Which al love leyd aside
And of common his propre made
So that instead of shouel and spade
The sharp was take on hand
And in this wise it came to land
Whereof that men made dyches deep
And high walls for to keep
The gold which auaryce encloseth
But al to little him supposes
Though he myt all the world purchase
For that thing that may embrace
Of gold of catel or of land
Let it never out of his hond
But get him more and halt it fast
As though the world should ever last
So is he lyche unto the hell
For as these books tell
What comes there in less or more
It shall depart neuermore
Thus when he has his Cofer loken
It shall not after ben vnstoken
But when him list to have a sight
Of gold hou it shyneth bright
That he thereon may look and muse
For other wise he dare not use
To take his part or less or more
So is the power for evermore
Him lakketh that he has Enough
An ox draws in the plough
Of that him self has no profit
A sheep right in the same plyte
His wulle bears upon a day
Another takes the flees aweye
Thus has he yt he naught ne has
For he thereof his part ne tath
To seye hou such a man has good
Who so that reason understood
It is inproperlyche said
That good has him and halt him taid
That he ne gladeth naught with all
But is unto his good a thralle
And as a subget thus serves he
Where that he should Master be
Such is the king of Thauarous
My sone as thou art amerous
Tell if thou farest of love so
My fadre as it seems no
That auarous yet never I was
So as ye setten me the caas
For as ye tolden here above
In full possessyon of love
Yet was I never here to fore
So that me thinks well therefore
I may excuse well my deed
But of my will without dread
If I that tresour might get
It should never be foryete
That I ne would fast hold
Till god of love him selue would
That death us should depart a two
For leueth well I love her so
That even with mine own life
If I that sweet lusty wife
Might ones welden at my will
For I would hold her stylle
And in this wise takes keep
If I her had I would her keep
And yet no frydaye would I fast
Though I her kept and hold fast
Fie on the bags in the kyst
I had enough if I her kyst
For certes if she were mine
I had her lever than a mine
Of gold for all this world rich
Ne me might make so rich
As she that is so Inly good
I set naught of other good
For might I get such a thing
I had Tresour for a king
And though I would it fast hold
I were thereto mochel byholde
But I myt pype now with less
And suffer that it ouerpasse
Not with my will / for thus I would
Ben auarous if that I should
But fadre I you herd sey
Hou the auarous has yet sum wey
Whereof he may be glad for be
May when him list his tresour se
And grope and feel it al about
But I full often am shet there out
There as my worthy Tresour is
So is my life lyche unto this
That me tolden here to fore
Hou that an Ox his yok has bore
For thing that should him not avail
And in this wise I me travail
For who that ever has the welfare
I wot well that I have the care
And I am as who says loves knave
For I am had and naught ne have
Now deem in your own thought
If this be auaryce or naught
My sone I have of the no wonder
Thongh thou to serve be put under
With love which to kind acordeth
But so as every book records
At is to kind no plesaunce
That man above his sustenaunce
Unto the gold shall serve and bow
For that may no reason auowe
But Auaryce netheles
If he may geten his encrees
Of gold that would he serve and keep
For he takes of naught else keep
But for to fylle of his bags large
And al is to him but a charge
For he ne parts naught with all
But keeps as a servant shall
And thus though that he multyplye
His gold without Tresorye
He (...) / for man is naught amended
With gold but if it be dyspended
To man's use whereof I read
A tale and take thereof good heed
Of that byfelle by old tide
As tells us the c^erk Ouyde
^ Achus which is god of wyn
Acordannt to his dyuyn
A priest which Cillenus hit
He had and fell so that he by night
Th^^ priest was dru^ke and goth a straid
^^^rof the men were evil apayd
^^ Fryg^^ond where as he went
^^^ at the last a chorle him hent
(...) strength of other felaushyp
^^ that upon his drunkeshyp
(...) bounden him with cheynes fast
And forth they lad him also fast
^^to the king which hight Myde
But he that would his vice hyde
(...) curtoys king took of him head
And bad that men should him led
^^ to a chamber for to keep
^^^ ^e of leyser had a sleep
And tho this priest was sone vnbou^d
And upon a couche fro the ground
To sleep (...) was le^d soft Enough
And when he woke yt king him drou
To his presence and did him chere
So that this priest in such manner
Whose yt him lyketh there he duelleth
And all this he to Bachus tells
When that he came to him again
And when that Bachus herd seyn
Hou myde has done this curtesye
Him thinks it were ^ vylony^
But he reward him for his deed
So as he might of his godhede
Unto this king this god appears
And clepeth and that other hereth
This god to Myde thanketh fair
Of that he was so debonayre
Toward his pressed and bad him sey^
What thing it were he would preye
He should it have of worldly good
This king was glad and stylle stood
And was of his axyng in doubt
And all the world he casts about
What thing was best for his ^state
And with him self stood at debate
Upon three points which I find
Ben leuest unto man's kind
The first of hem it is delight
The two ben worship and profit
And than he thought if that I crave
Delight though I delight may have
Delight shall passen in my age
That is no syker advantage
For every joy bodily
Shall end in woo / delight for thy
Wol I not chese / and if I worship
Axe and of the world lordshyp
That is an occupacyon
Of proud Imagynacyon
Which makes an heart veyn within
There is no certain for to win
For lord and knave is al one weye
When they be bore and when they deye
And if I profit axe would
I not in what manner I should
Of worlds good have sykernesse
For every thief upon richesse
A wayteth for to rob and stele
Such ^^ood is cause of harms feel
And also though a man at ones
Of all the world within his wones
The Tresour might have every deele
Yet had he but one man's dele
Toward him self so as I think
Of clothing of mete of drink
For more out take vanyte
There has no lord in his degree
And thus upon the points diverse
Dyuersly he began reherce
What point him thought for the best
But pleynly for to get him rest
He can no syker weye cast
And netheles yet at the last
He fell upon the couetyse
Of gold / and than in sundry wise
He thought as I have said to fore
How Tresour may be sone forlore
And had an Inly great desire
Touchend of such recover
Hou that he might his cause avail
To get him gold without fail
Within his heart and thus he preyseth
The gold and says hou that he peyseth
Above al other metal most
The gold he says may led an host
To make werre ayene a king
The gold put under al thing
And set whom him list above
The gold can make of hate love
And werre of pees. and right of wrong
And long to short and short to long
Without gold may be no fest
Gold is the lord of man and best
And may hem both bye and selle
So that a man may sothely tell
That all the world to gold obeys
For thy this king to bachus preyth
To grant him gold / but he excedeth
Mesure more than him needs
Men tellen that the maladye
Which called is Ioropesy^
Resembled is to this vice
By weye of kind and Auaryce
The more Idropesye drynketh
The more thyrsteth for him thinks
That he may not drink his fylle
So that there may no thing fulfylle
The lusts of his appetyte
And right in such manner plyte
Stant ever Auaryce and ever stood
The more he has of worsdes good
The more he would keep streyte
And ever more and more coueyte
And right in such condicyon
Without good discrecyon
This king with auaryce is smete
That all the world it might wete
For he to Bachus then preyd
That whereupon his hand he leid
It should thorugh his touch anon
Become gold / and thereupon
This god him grants as he bad
Tho was this king of Fryge glad
And for to put it in assaye
With / all the have that he may
He touches that he touches this
And in his hond al gold it is
The stone / the tree / the leef / the gras
The Flower the fruit al gold it was
Thus touches he while he may last
But hongre at the last
Him took so that he mote need
By wey of kind his hongre feed
The clothe was leyd / the board was set
And all was forth before him set
His dissh / his drink / his cup his meet
But when he would drynk or ete
As to his mouth anon came nyghe
It was al gold and then he syghe
Of Auayrce the folly
And he with that bygnne to cry
And preyde Bachus to foryeue
His gylt and suffer him for to live
And be such as he was to fore
So that he were naught forlore
This god which of this greuaunce
Herd / took routhe upon his repentance
And bad him goo forth redyly
Unto a flood was fast by
Which paceole than hight
In which as soon as ever he might
He should him wasshe oueral
And said him than he shall
Recouere his first astate ageyn
This king right as he herd seyn
In to the flood goth fro the land
And wesshe him both foot and hond
And so forth all the remenaunt
As him was set in ^^uendunt
And than he saw meruayles strange
The flood his color began to change
The grauel with the small stones
To gold they torn al attones
And he was quyte of that he had
And thus fortune his change lad
And when he saw his touch gone
He goth him home right forth soon
And lives forth as he did er
And put al Auaryce a fer
And the riches of gold despyseth
And seyth that mete and clothe suffyseth
Thus has this king experyence
Hou fools done the reverence
To gold which of his own kind
Is less worth than is the rynde
To sustenaunce of man's fode
Then he made laws good
And al his thing set upon skylle
He led his people for to tylle
Her l^nd and live under the law
And they also should forth draw
Bestayl and seche none encrees
^f gold which is the breche of pees
For this a man may find write
To fere the time that gold was smite
In coygne that men the floren knew
There was well nyhe noman untrue
There was another shield ne spear
Ne dedely wepen for to be bear
T^o was the town without wall
The which now is closed over all
Tho was there no bro^^ge in land
Which now takes every cause on ho^d
So may yt man know hou the floreyn
Was mother first of malengyn
And brynger in of all werre
Whereof this world stant out of herre
Thorugh the counseyl of auary^^
Which of his own propre vice
Which as the hell wonderful
For it may neuermore be full
That what as ever comes therynne
Awey it ne may never win
But sone mine do thou not so
Late al such auaryce go
And take thy part of that thou have
I bid not that thou do wast
But hold largess in mesure
And if thou see a creature
Which thorugh pouert is fall in need
Give him sum good for this I read
To him that wol not yeuen here
What pain he shall have else where
There is a pain among al
Bynethe in hell which men call
The woeful pain of Tantaly
Of which I shall the redely
Deuyse hou theryn men stond
In hell thou shall vnderst^nd
There is a flood of thylk office
Which serves al for auaryce
What man that stand shall therein
He stant up even to the chynne
Above his head also there hougeth
A fruit which to that pain longs
And that fruit touches ever in one
His ouerlyppe / and thereupon
Such thyrst and honger him assayleth
That never his appetyte ne fails
But when he wend his hongar feed
The fruit withdraws him at need
And though he have his head on high
The fruit is ever alyche nyghe
So is the honger well the more
And also though him thurst sore
And to the water bow adoune
The flood in such condycyon
Aualeth that his drink areche
He may not / loo now which a wreche
That mete and drynk is him so couthe
And yet there comth none in his mouth
Lyche to the peynes of this flood
Stant Auaryce in worlds good
He has Enough and yet him needs
For his scarcenes it him forbedeth
And ever his honger after / more
Trauayleth him alyche sore
So is he peyned oueral
For thy thy goods oueral
My sone look that thou dyspende
Whereof thou might thy self amend
Both here and eke in other place
And also if thou wolt purchase
To be loved thou must use
Largess for if thou refuse
To give for thy loves sake
It is no reason that thou take
Of love that thou would crave
For thy if thou wolt, grace have
Be gracyous and do largess
Of Auaryce and the sickness
Esche we above al other thing
And take ensample of Myde the king
And of the flood of hell also
Where is Enough of al woe
And though there were no matere
But only that we fynden here
Men ought Auaryce esche we
For what man thylk vice sewe
He get him self but little rest
For though so that the body rest
The heart upon the gold trauayleth
Whom many a nyt^s dread assaileth
For though he lygge a bed naked
His heart is evermore awaked
And dremeth as he lies to sleep
Hon besy that he is to keep
His Tresour that no thief it stele
Thus has he but a woeful well
And right so in the same wise
If thou thy self wolt well auyse
There be lovers of such Enough
That wol unto reason bough
If so ^e they come above
When they be maystres of her love
And that they sholden be most glad
With love they ben most bestad
So fayn they wolden it holden all
That her heart / her eye is ouerall
And wenen every man be a thief
To stele awey that hem is leef
Thus thorugh her own fantasye
They fallen in to Ielousye
Than has the ship to broke his cable
With every wind and is meuable
Amans
My fader for that ye now tell
I have herd oftyme tell
Of Ielousye but what it is
Yet understand I never or this
Wherefore I would you byseche
That ye me would inform and teache
What manner thing it might be
My sone that is hard to me
But netheles as I have herd
Now herkne and thou shall be ansuerd

aMong the men lak of manhod
In marriage upon wyshode
Makes that a man him self deceyueth
Whereof it is yt he conceyueth
That ylke vnesy maladye
The which is cleped Ielousye
Of which if I the propyrte
Shall tell after the nyorte
So as it worcheth on a man
A fever it is cotydyan
Which every day wol come about
Where so a a man be in or out
At home if that a man wol wone
This fever is than of common wone
Most grievous in a man's eye
For than he makes him tote and prye
Where so his love ever go
She shall not with her little too
Mysteppe but he sees al
His eye is walkend oueral
Where that she sing or that she dau^ce
He sees the lest countenance
If she look on a man a side
Or with him rowne at any tide
Or that she laugh or that she ^oure
His eye is there at every hour
And when it draws to the night
If she so than be without light
Anon is all the game shente
For than he set his parliament
To speak it when he comes to bed
And says if I were now to wedde
I would neuermore have wife
And so he torneth in to stryf
The lust of loves dute
And al upon dyuersyte
If she be fresshe and well arrayed
He says her baner is dysplayed
To cle^e in gestes fro the weye
And if she be not well beseye
And that her list not to be glad
He beryth on hond that she is mad
And loves not her husbond
And says he may well understand
That if she would his company
She should than before his eye
She we all the plesaunce that she myt
So that by day ne by night
She not what thing is best
But lives well out of al rest
For what as ever him list seyn
She dare not speak one word ageyn
But wepeth and hold her lyppes cloos
She may well write Saunce ^^poos
The wife which is to such one married
Of al women be he waryed
For with his fever of jelousye
His each days fantasye
Of soro we is ever alyche grene
So that there is no love seen
While that him list at home abide
And when so as he wol out ride
T^^^ has he ready his ^spye
Abydyng in her company
A jangler an evil mouthed one
That she ne may no^^he there gone
Ne speak one word ne ones look
But he ne wol it wend and croke
And torn after his own intent
Though she no thing but honor meant
When that the lord comth home ageyn
The jangler must somewhat seyn
So what without and what withynne
This fever is ever to begin
For where he comes he can not end
Till death of him has made an end
For though so be that he ne here
Ne see nor wit in no manner
But al honor and womanhede
Thereof the Ielous takes none ^ede
But as a man to love unkind
He cast his staf as does the blind
And fynt defaulte where is none
As who so dremeth on a stone
Hou he is leyd and groneth often
When he lies on his pylowe soft
So is there naught but stryf and chest
Where love should make his rest
It is great thing if he her kiss
Thuo has she lost the nyghtes bliss
For at such time he grutcheth ever
And beryth on hond there is a lever
That she would another were
Instead of him abedde there
And with tho words and with mo
Of jelousye he torneth her fro
And lies upon his other side
And she with that draws her aside
And there she wepeth all the night
A to what pain she is dyght*
That in her thought has so beset
The bond which may not be vnknet
I wot the time is often cursed
That ever was the gold vnpursed
The which was leyd upon the book
When that al other she forsook
For love of him but al to late
She pleyneth for as than algate
She mo^e forbere and to him / ^owe
Though he ne would it allow
For man is lord of thylk feyre
So may the woman but empeyre
If she speak ought again thy will
And thus she beryth her pain stylle
But if this Fever a woman t^ke
She shall be well the more hard sha^^
But if she both see and here
And find that there is matere
She dare but to her self pleyne
And thus she suffers double pain
Loo thus my sone as I have ^ryt^
Thou might of jelousye wit
His fever and his condycyon
Which is fall of suspectyon
But whereof that this fever grows
Who so these old books too weth
There may he find hou it is
For they us teache and tell this
Hou that this Fever of jelousye
Somdele it grows of sotye
Of love and somdele of untrust
For as sekeman left his lust
And when he may no sauoure get
He hates than his own mete
Right so this feuerous maladye
Which caused is of fantasye
Makes the jelous in feeble plyght
To leave of love his appetyt
Thorugh feyned Informacyon
Of his Imagynacyon
But finally to taken heed
Men may well make a lykelyhede
Between him which is auarou^
Of gold and him that is Ir^^us
Of love for in one degree
They stand both as seems me
That one would have his bags still
And naught departen with his will
And dare not for the thieves sleep
So feign he would his tresour keep
That other may not well be glad
For evermore he is adrad
Of these lovers that gone about
In aunter if they put him out
So have they both little Joy
As well of love as of money
Now have thou sone at my techyng
Of Ielousye a knowlechyng
That thou might understand this
Fro when he comes and what he is
And eke to whom that he is like
Beware for thy thou be not syke
Of thylk fever as I have spoke
For it wol in him self be wroke
For love hates no thing more
As men may find by the lore
Of hem that whylome were wy^^
Hou they speak in many wise
My fader sothe is that ye seyn
But for to look there ageyn
Before this time hou it is fall
Whereof there might ensample fall
To such men as ben Ielous
In what manner it is grievous
Right fayn I would ensample here
My good sone at thy prayere
Of such ensamples I find
So as they comen now to mind
Upon this point of time gone
I think for to tellen one
hIc ponit Confessor Exemplum contra istos maritos quos Ielousia ma^^la^^t / Et
narrat qualiter vul canus cuins vxor venus extitit suspicionem inter ipsam and
martem concipie^s eorum gestus diligencius explorabat / Vnde contigit quod cum
ipse quadam vice ambos inter se pariter amplexantes in lecto nudo inuenit / et
exclama^s omnem cetum deorum et deatum ad ta^tum spectaculum conuocauit / super
quo tamen derisum pocius quam remedium a tota cohorte consecutus est

oVyde wrote of many things
Among ye which in his wrytinges
He told a tale in poesy
Which touches in to Ielousye
Upon a certain caas of love
Among the gods al above
It fell that ylke time thus
The god af fire which Vulcanus
Is hot and has a craft forth with
Assygned for to be the Smyth
Of Iupyter and his figure
Both of vysage and of stature
Is ^othly and malgracyous
But yet he has within his house
As for the lykyng of his life
The fair Venus to his wife
But mars which of bataylles is
The god an eye had unto this
As he which was chyualrous
It fell him to ben amerous
And thought it was great pity
To see so lusty one as she
Be coupled with so hard a wight
So that his pain day and night
He did if he her win might
And she that had a good insyght
Toward so noble a knyghtly lord
In love fell of his acord
There lakketh nout but time and place
That he ny^ syker of her grace
But when two hertes fallen in one
So wise a wait was never none
That at sometime they ne mete
And thus this fair lusty sweet
With Mars has often company
But thylk unkind Ielousye
Which evermore the heart opposes
Makes Vulcanus that he supposes
That it is not well ouerall
And to him self he said he shall
A s^y^ better if that he may
And so it fell upon a day
That he this thing so slyghly led
He fond hem both a ^edde
Al warm / echone with other naked
And he with craft al ready maked
Of strong cheynes has hem bound
As he to geder hem had found
And left hem both lygge so
And began than to cry tho
Unto the gods al about
And they assembled in a route
Come al at ones for to see
But none amends had he
Bat was rebuked here and there
Of hem that loves friends were
And said that he was to blame
For if there fell him any shame
It was thorugh his mysgouernau^ce
And thus he lost contenaunce
This god and let his cause fall
And they to scorne^^owen ^^^e
And lo^en mars out of his hondes
Whereof these erthely husbondes
For ever might ensample take
In such a chance hem overtake
For Vulcanus his wife bewrayd
The blame upon him self ho layd^
Whereof his shame was the more
Which ought for to be a lore
For every man that leueth here
To reulen him in this matere
Though such an hap of love asterte
Yet should he not apoynte his heart
Of Ielousye of that is wrought
But feyne as though he wist it nout
For if he ^ete it ouerpasse
The sklaunder shall be well the less
And he the more in ese stand
For this thou might well understand
That where a man shall needs le^^
The less harm is for to chese
But Ielousye of his vntryst
Makes that full many an harm aryst
Which else should not arise
And if a man would him auyse
Of that byfelle* to Vulcanus
Him ought of reason think thus
That sith a god was thereof shamed
Well should an erthely man be blamed
To take upon him such^ a vice
For thy my sone in thine office
Beware that thou be naught Ielous
Which oftyme has shent the house
My fadre this ensample is bard
Hou such thing to the heaven ward
Among the gods might fall
For there is one god of all
Which is the lord of heuene^^ hell
But if it like you to tell
Hou such gods come a place
Ye might mochel thank purchase
For I shall be well taught with all
Confessor
My son it is so ouerall^
With hem that stonden mysbyleu^d
That such gods ^en byleued
In sundry place in sondey wise
Among hem which be vnwyst
There is bytaken of credence
Whereof that I the dyfference
In the manner as it is write
Shall do the pleynly for to wit

oRcrist was ^ore among b^ here
Of the byleues that tho were
In four forms thus it was
They of chaldee as in this cas
Had a believe of hem selue
Which stood upon the signs twelve
And eke with the planetes seuene
Which as they saw upon the henen^
Of sundry constellacyon
In her Imagyuacyon
With son^ry ^rerf and portrature
They made of gods the figure
In Elements and eke also
They hadden a believe tho
And al was that unreasonable
For the elements ben seruysable
To man for often of accydence
As men may see the experyence
They ben corrupt by sundry weye
So may no man's reason seye
That they ben god in any wise
And eke if men hem well auyse
The son and moan eclypsen both
Or be hem leef or be hem to the
They suffer and what thing is passyble
To ben a god is inpossyble
Et quod Nembroth quartus a Noe ignem tanquam deu^ in Caldea primus adorari

These elements ben creatures
So ben these heavenly fygures
Whereof may well be iustyfyed
That they may not be deifyed
And what takes awey the honor
Which due is to the creator
And yeueth it to the creature
He does to great a forteture
But of Caldee netheles
Upon this feyth though it be les
They hold affermed the creaunce
So that of hell the penance
As folk which stant out of believe
They shall ^ceyue as we believe
Of the Caldees loo in this wise
Stant the believe out of assyse
But in Egypt worst of all
The feyth is false hou so it fall
For they diverse beestes there
Honor as though they gods were
And netheles yet forth with all
The gods most in specyal
They have forth with a goddess
In whom is al her sekernesse
The gods yet be cleped thus
Orus Cyphon and Isyrus
They were brethren al three
And the gods in here degree
Her suster was and Isys hight
Whom Isyrus forlay by night
And held her after as his wife
So it by fell that upon stryf
Typhon has Isire his brother slain
Which had a child to sone Orayn
And he his fader death to heart
So took that he may not asterte
That he Typhon after ne slough
Than he was ^ype of age Enough
But yet the Egypcyens trowen
For all this error that they known
That these brethren ben of might
To set and keep Egypt up right
And over through if that hem like
But Isys as seyth the Cronyke
Fro Greece in to Egypt came
And she then upon hand nam
To teache hem for to sow and ^re
Which noman knew to fore there
And when the Egypcyans syghe
The field full a fore here eye
And that the land bygan to greyne
Which whysome had be bareyne
For the earth bare^ after the kind
His due charge this I find
That* she of birth the goddess
Is cleped / so that in dystresse
The women there upon chyldyng
To her clepe and here offryng
They ^ere when; that they be lyg^ht
Loo hou Egypt al out of sight
Fro reason stant in mysbyleue
For lak of bore as I believe
De secta Grecorum
Among the greeks out of the weye
As they that reason put aweye
There was as the Cronyke seyth
Of mysbyleue an other feyth
That ^ere gods and here goddess
As who seyth taken al to guess
Of such as weren full of vice
To whom they made sacryfyce
^he high god so as they said
To whom they worship laid
Nota qualiter Saturnus deoru^ summns appellatur

Saturnus hight and king of Crete
He had be put out of his sete
He was put down as he which stood
In frenesye and was so wood
That fro his wife which Rea hight
His own children he to plyght
And ete hem of his common wone
But Iupyter which was his sone
And of full age his fader bond
And kyt of with his own hand
His genytalles which also fast
In to the deep see he cast
Whereof the greeks afferme and seye
Thus when they were cast awey
Came Venus forth by wey of kind
And of Saturnus also I find
Hou afterward in to an isle
This Iupyter him did exyle
Where that he stood in great meschyef
Loo what a god they maden cheef
Which stood most in his degree
And sythen that such one was he
Among the gods thou myt know
These other that been more low
Ben little worth as it is found
Jupiter ^eus deliciarum
For Iupyter was the seconds
Which Juno had unto his wife
And yet a lechour al his life
He was and in auoutrye
He wrought many a trecherye
And for he was so full of vices
They cleped him god of delyces
Of whom if thou wolt wit
Ouyde the poet has write
But yet here sterres both two
Saturn and Iupyter also
They have although they be to blame
Attytled to her own name
Mars deus belli
Mars was another man in that last
The which in trace was forth draw
Of whom the clerk Vegecius
Wrote in his book and told thus
Hou he in to Italye came
And fortune there he nam
That he a maiden there oppressyd
Which in her order was professed
As the which was the P^yo^esse
In bestes Temple the goddess
So was she well the more to blame
Dame Ilya this lady name
Men clepe and she was also
The kings daughter that was tho
Which mynyter by name hight
So that ayene the laws right
Mars thylke time upon her that
Remus and Romulus he vygat
Which after when they come in age
Of knyghthode and of bessellage
Italye al hoole they overcome
And foundeden the great Rome
In arms and of such empryse
They weren that in thylk wise
Her fader mars for the marvel
The god was cleped of the battle
They were his children both two
Though hem he took his name so
There was none other cause why
And yet a sterre upon the sky
He has unto his name applied
In which that he is ^^guyfyed
Another god they hadden eke
To whom for counseyl they byseke
The which was brother to Venus
Appollo men him clepe thus
He was an hunte upon the helles
There was with him no virtue else
Whereof that any books carpe
But onlyche that he couthe harp
Which when he walked over land
Full of time he woke on hond
To get him with his sustenaunce
For lak of other purueaunce
And other while of his falshede
He feyneth him to conne a read*
Of thing which afterward should fall
Whereof among his sleyghtes all
He has the leude folk receyned
So that the better he was received
Loo now thorugh what* creacyon
He has deyfycacyon
To such as be the foles yet
And cleped is the god of wit
Another god to whom they sought
Mercurye hight / and him ne rought
What thing he stale ne whom* he slou
Of s^r^^rye he couthe enough
That when he would him self transfor
me / Full oftyme he took the form
Of woman and his own left
So did he well the more theft
Agrete speker in all things
He was also and of lesynges
An Author that men wist none
An other such as he was one
And yet they maden of. this thief
A god which was vuto him leef
And cleped him in tho vyleues
The god of merchants and of thieves
But asterre upon the heuene
He has one of the planetes senene
But Vulcanus of whom I spa
Ho had a courbe upon the bak
And thereto he was hyppe halt
Of whom thou understand shall
He was a shrewe in all his youth
And he none other virtue couthe
Of virtue to help him self with
But only that he was a smyth
Which with Iupyter in his forge
Diverse things made him forge
So wot I not for what desire
To clepe him the god of fire
King of Cecyle Ipolytus
A sone had / and Eolus
He hight of his fader grant
He held the weye of covenant
The governance of every I Will
Which was longed unto Cecyle
Of hem that fro the land foreyn
Lie upon to the wind al pleyn
And fro thylk Isles to the land
Full often came the wynd to hond
And after the name of him for thy
The wind is cleped Eoly
And is cleped the god of wynd
Loo no whou this believe is blind
The king of Crete Iupyter
The same which I spast of er
Unto his brother which Neptune
Which was hot him list comune
Part of his god so that by ship
He made him strong of the lordshyp
Of a^l the sea in tho parties
Where that he wrought his tyrannyes
And the strange Isles al about
He wan that every man has doubt
Upon his march for to sail
For he anon hem would assail
And rob that thing that they ladde^
His sauf conduyt but if they hadden
Whereof the common voys aroos
^n every land that such a loos
He caught al nere it worth a stre
That he was cleped of the sea
The god by name and yet he is
With hem that so believe amys
This Neptunus which was thylk also
Which was the first founder tho
Of noble Troy and he for thy
Was well the more let by
The boresman of the shepeherdes
And eke of hem that Netherdes
Was of Archade and hight pan
Of whom has spoke many a man
For in the wode of Nouertyne
Enclosed with the trees of pygne
And out of the mount of parysye
He bade of beestes the baylye
And eke bynethe in the valeye
Where thylk river as men may seye
Which Ladon hight made his course
He was the cheef of governors
Of hem that kepen tame beestes
Whereof they make yet the festes
In the cite of Stursalydes
And forth with all yet netheles
He taught men the forth drawyng
Of bestaylle and eke the making
Of Oxen and of horse the same
Hou men hem should ride and tame
Of fowls eke so as we find
Full many a subtyle craft of kind
He fond which noman knew to fore
Men did him worship eke therefore
That he the first in thylk land
Was / which the melodye fond
Of reeds when they were ripe
With double pypes for to pype
Thereof he yafe the first lore
Till afterward men couthe more
To every cra^ft of man's help
He had a ready wit to help
Thorugh natural experyence
Thus the nyce reverence
Of fools when he was deed
The foot was turned to the head
And clepen him god of nature
For so they maden his figure
Another god so as they feel
With Iupyter upon Semele
Bygate in his auoutrye
Whom for to hyde his lecherye
That none thereof shall take keep
In a montayne for to keep
Which Dyon hight and was in Inde
He sent in books as I find
And he by name Bachus hight
Which afterward when that he myt
A wastor was and al his rent
In wyn and bordel he dyspente
But alweye he wonder bad
Among the greeks a name he had
They cleped him the god of wine
And thus a gloton was dyuyne
There was yet Esculapius
A god in thylk time as thus
His craft stood upon Surgerye
But for the lust of lecherye
That he to Dayres daughter drough
It fell that Iupyter him slough
And yet they made him nout for thy
A god and wist no cause why
In Rome he was long time so
A god among the Romans tho
For as he said in his presence
There was destroyed a pestylence
When they to the isle of Delphos went
And Appollo with hem sent
This Esenlapius his sone
Among the Romans for to wone
And there he duelte for a while
Till afterward in that isle
Fro when he came ayene he torneth
Where al his life that he soiourneth
Among the greeks till he deyde
And they upon him than leyde
His name and god of medycyne
He ^at^e after that ylk line
Another god of Hercules
They made which was netheles
A man but that he was so strong
In all this world that brood and long
So mighty was no man as he
Merucyles twelve in his degree
As it was couthe in sundry lands
He did with his own hondes
Again geauntes and monstres both
The which were horeyble and loathe
But he with strength hem ouercam
Whereof so great a prys he nam
That they him clepe among all
The god of strength and to him call
And yet there is no reason Inn
For he a man was fulfilled of sin
Which proved was upon his end
For in a rage him self he brende
And such a cruel man's deed acord
Acordeth naught to the good lord
They made of gods yet another
Which Pluto hight / and was the brother
Of Iupyter / and he fro youth
With every word which came to mouth
Of any thing when he was wroth
He would swear his common oath
By Lethen and Flageton
By Cocheton and Acheron
The which after the books tell
Ben the chyef flodes of hell
By Segne and Styge he swore also
That by the deep pyttes two
Of hell the most pryncypal
Pluto these oaths oueral
Swore of his common custumounce
Till it fell upon a chance
That he for Iupyters sake
Unto the gods late do make
A sacryfyce / and for that deed
One of the pyttes for his mede
In hell which I spak of er
Was granted him / and thus he there
Upon the fortune of this thing
The name took of hell king
Loo these gods and well mo
Among the greeks they had tho
And of gods many one
Whoos names thou shall here anon
And in what wise they deceyuen
The fools which her feyth receyuen
Oo as Saturn is souerayn
Of al gods as they sayn
So is Cybylle of goddesses
The mother whom without gesses
The folk preyn honor and serve
As they the which her law observe
But for to known upon this
Fro when she came and what she is
Bethnicia the country hight
Where she came first to man's sight
And after was Saturnus wife
By whom three children in her life
She bare and were cleped tho
Juno Neptunus and Pluto
The which of Nyce fantasye
The people would deyfye
And for her children were so
Cybelle than was also
Made a goddess and they her call
The mother of the gods all
So was that name bore forth
And yet the cause is little worth
A voys unto Saturn told
Hou that his own sone him should
Out of his reygne put awey
And he by cause of thylk wey
That him was shape such an hate
Cybelle his wife began to hate
And eke her progenye both
And while that they were wroth
By Phyberem upon a day
In this auoutrye he lay
On whom he Iupyter vygat
And this child was after that
Which wrout al yt was prophesied
As it to fore was specyfyed
So when that Jupiter of / Crete
Was king / a wife unto him mete
The daughter of Sybell he took
And that was Juno says the book
Of his deyfycacyon
After the f^ls oppynyon
That have I told so as I mean
And for this Juno was the queen
Of Iupyter and suster ^ke
The fools unto her seek
And seyn that she is the goddess
Of Regnes both and of Ry^hesse
And ^ke she as they understand
The water Nymphs has in hond
To leden at her own heste
And when here list the sky tempeste
The Reynbowe is her messagere
Loo which a mysbyleue is here
That she goddess is of the sky
I wot none other cause why
Another goddess is Myn^rue
To whom the gr^kes o^^ye and serve
And she was nyhe the great lay
Of Tyton fond where lay
A child for cast / but what she was
There knew noman the soth cas
But ^n Affryke she was leyde
In the manner as I have seyde
And carried from that ylke place
In to an I Will for in Trace
T^^ which Palene than hight
Where a Noryce her kepee and dyght
And after for she was so wise
That she fond first in her auyse
To clothe making of wolle and line
Men sayden that she was deuyne
And the goddess of sapyence
They clepen her in that credence
Of the goddess which pallas
Is cleped sundry speech was
One seyth her fader was pallaunt
Which in his time was a geaunt
A cruel man a batayllous
Another says how in his house
She was the cause why he deyde
And of this pallas eke some seyde
That she Martes wife was and so
Among the men that were tho
Of mysbyleue m Ryote
The goddess of bataylles she hot^
Was / and yet she bears the name
Now look hou they be not for to bl^me
Saturnus after his exyle
Fro Crete came m great peryle
In to the lands of Itayle
And there he did great marvel
Whereof his name duelleth yet
For he fond of his own wit
The first craft of plough tyllyng
Of eryng and of corn sowyng
And hou men should sette^ vynes
Of the grapes for to make wynes
And this he taught / and it fell so
His wife which came with him tho
Was cleped Ceres by name
And for she taught also the same
And was his wife that ylke throw
As it was to the people know
They made of Ceres a goddess
In whom in their ^ilthe yet they bless
And says that Try^olynus
Here sone goth among us
And makes yt corn good chepe or dear
Right as her list from year to year
So that this wife because of this
Goddess of corn cleped is
King Iupyter which his lykyng
Whilome fulfilled in all thing
So pryuelyche about he lad
His lust that he his will had
Of Lat^na and of her that
Dyane his daughter he bygat
Unknown of his wife Juno
And afterward she knew it so
That Latona for dread fled
In to an I Will where she hyd
Her womb which of child aroos
Thylk I Will was cleped De^^os
In which Dyana was forth brou^t
And kept so that her lakketh nout
And after when she was of age
She took none head of marriage
But out of man's company
She took her al to lecherye
In forest and in wilderness
For there was al here business
By day and eke by nyghtes tide
With arowes broad under the side
And bo we in hond of which she slough
And took all that she lyked Enough
Of bestes which ben chaceable
Whereof the Cronyke of this fable
Says that the gentylnes most of all
W^rshyp her and to her call
And the goddess of high helles
Of grene trees and of fressh^ wells
They clepen her in that believe
Which that no reason may acheue
Proserpyna which daughter was
Of Cereres byfel the cas
While she was duellyng m Cecyle
He mother in that ylke while
Upon her blyssyng and her hest
Bad that she should be honest
And lere for to weue and spynne
And duelle at home and keep her Inn
But she cast all that lore awey
And as she went her out to pley
To gader flowers in a plain
And that was under the Montayne
Of Ethna fell the same tide
That pluto came that way ride
And suddenly or she was ware
He took her up in to his chaar
And as they ryden in the field
Her great beauty he byhelde
Which was so plesaunt in his eye
That for to hold in company
He wedded her and held her so
To ben his wife for euermo
And as thou have to fore herd tell
How he was cleped god of hell
So is she cleped the goddess
By cause of him ne more ne less
Lo thus my sone as I the told
The greeks whylome by days old
Her gods had in sundry wise
And thorugh the lore of her apry^^
The Romayne held ^ke the same
And in worship of her name
To every god in specyal
They made a Temple forth with all
And eke of hem her years day
Attytled had and of array
The temples were then ordained
And eke the people was constreyned
To come and done her sacryfyce
The priests ^ke in her office
Solemn made thylk festes
And the greeks thus like the beestes
The men instead of god honor
Which might hem naught so coure
While that they were alive here
And over this as thou shall here
The greeks fulfilled of fantasye
Seyne eke that of the helles hye
And the gods ben in specyal
But of her name in general
They hoten al Satyry
There ben of Nymphs propyrly
In the believe of hem also
Oreades they sayden tho
Attytled ben to the Montaynes
And for the wodes in demeynes
To keep tho ben Dryades
Of fresshe wells Nayades
And of the Nymphs of the sea
I find a tale m propyrte
Hou Dorus whilom the king of greece
Which had of Infortune a p^ce
His wife forth with his daughter all
So as the happes sholden fall
With many a gentyl woman there
Dreynt in the salt see they were
Where of the greeks that time seyden
And such a name upon leyden
Nereydes that they ben ho^e
The Nymphs which that they note
To reygne upon the stremes salt
Lo now if this believe halt
But of the Nymphs as they tells
In every place where they duelle
They ben al ready obeysaunt
As Damoyselles attendaunt
To the gods whose ser^yse
They mot^ obey in all wise
Whereof the greeks to hem beseke
With tho that been gods eke
And have in hem a great credence
And yet without experyence
Sauf only of Illusyon
Which was to hem dampnacyon
For men also that were deed
They hadden gods as I read
And tho by name Manes hyghten
To whom full great honor they dite^
So a^ the greeks law seyth
Which was ayene the right feyth
Thus have I told a great party
^u^ all the hole progenye
O^ gods m that ylke time
To long it were for to ryme
But yet of yt which thou has^ h^rd
Of mysbyleue how it has ferd
There is a great dyuersyte
My fader right so thinks me
But yet one thing I you byseche
Which stant in all men's speech
The god and the goddess of love
Of whom ye no thing here above
^aue told ne spoken of her fare
That ye me would now declare
H^u they first come to that name
My son I have left it for shame
By cause I am her own p^eest
But for they stonden nyhe thy breast
V^on the shryfte of thy matere
Thou shall of hem the soth here
And understand now well the caa^
Venus Saturnus daughter was
Which al danger put awey
Of love and fond to lust a wey
So that of her in sundry place
Diverse men f^lle in to grace
And such a lusty life she lade
That she diverse children hade
Now one by this now one by that
Of her it was that ma^s bygat
A child which cleped was Armen^
Of her also came Andragene
To whom mercurye fader was
Anchyses bygate Eneas
Of her also and Herycon
Byten bygat and thereupon
When yt she saw there was none other
By Iupyter her own brother
She lay and he bygat Cupyde
And thylke sone upon a tide
When he was come unto his age
He had a wonder fair vysage
And fond his mother amerous
And was also lecherous
So when they were both alone
As he which eyes had none
To reason his mother kyst
And she also that nothing wist
But yt which unto his lust bylongeth
To ben her love him under fongeth
Thus was he blind and she vnwys
But nevertheless this cause it is
Which cupyde is the god of love
For he his mother durst love
And she which thout her lusts fo^de
Diverse loves took on hand
Well more than I the told here
And for she would her self skere
She made common that dysport
And set ^ law of such a port
That every woman might take
What man her list and naught forsake
To ben as common as she would
She was the first also which told
That women should her body selle
Semyramys so as men tell
Of Venus kept thylk apryse
And so did in the same wise
Of Rome fair Neabolye
Which sold her body to Regolye
She was to every man felawe
And held the lust of thylk law
Which Venus of her self began
Whereof that she the name wan
Why men her clepen the goddess
Of love and eke of gentylnesse
Of worlds lust and of plesaunce
See now the foul myscreaunc^
Of greeks in thylk time tho
When Venus took her name so
There was no ca^se under the moon
Of the which they hadden tho to done
Of well or woo where so it was
That they no token in that ca^
A god to help or a goddess
Whereof to take my witness
Nota de epistola Dindimi Regis Bragmannorum Alexandro magno directa vbi dicit
quod Greci tunc ad corpo ris conseruacionem pro singulis membris singulos deds
specialiter appropri ari credunt

The king of Bragma^s Dyndymus
Wrote unto Alysander thus
In blamyng of the greeks feyth
And of the mysbyleue he seyth
How they for every membre hadden
A sundry god to whom they spradden
Here arms and of help besoughten
Mynerue for the head they soughten
For she was wise and of a man
The wit and reason that he can
As in the celles of the brayn
Whereof they made her souerayn
Mercurye which was in his dawe^
A great speker of falls laws
On him the keeping of the tongue
They laid when they speak or song
For Bachus was a gloton eke
Him for the throat they byseke
That he it would wasshen often
With soote drynkes and with soft
The god of shulders and of arms
Was hercules for he in arms
The myghiyest was to fight
To him the ^ymmes they behyght
The god whom they cle^^n mart
The br^^t to keep has for his part
For with the heart in his image
That he adresse to his courage
And of the galle the goddess
For she was full of hastynesse
Of wrath and light to grieve also
They made and said it was Juno
Cupyde which the brond of fire
Bare in his hond he was the sire
Of the stomach which boyleth ever
Whereof the lusts ben the lever
To the Goddess Cere^es
which of the corn yafe her encrees
Upon the feyth that tho was take
The wombes cure was betake
And Venus thorugh the lecherye
For which they her deyfye
She kept al down the remenaunt
The which be to thylke office appertena^unt
Nota de prima Idolorum cultura que ex tribus precipue statuis exorta e^ quarum

Thus was dyspers in sundry wise
The mysbyleue as I deuyse
with many an Image of entaylle
Of such as might not hem avail
For they without lives chere
Vnmyghty be to see or here
Or speak or do or else feel
And yet the fools to hem knele
which is her own hand work
A lord hou this believe is derke
And fer fr^ reasonable wit
And netheles they done it yet
That was this day a raggyd tr^

That such a stok may help or grieve
But they be of such believe
And unto such gods call
It shall to hem right so byfalle
And fayl^ hem at most need
But if the list to taken heed
And of the first Image wit
Petorynu^ thereof has write
And eke Nygagorus also
And they afferme and write so
That promotheus was to fore
And fond the first craft therefore
And Cyre phanes as they t^lle
Through cou^scil which was take in hell
In remembrance of his lygnage
Let setten up the first Image
Of Cyrophanes seyth the book
That he for sorrow which he took
Of that he saw his sone deed
Of comfort kne we none other read
But let do make in remembrance
A fair Image of his semblaunce
And set it in the market place
Which openly to fore his face
Stood every d^y to dene him case
And they that than would please
The fader should it obey
When that they comen thylk wey^
Sta^nda siatua fuit ill^ ^ua^ ad sui patris ^eli culture in Rex Ninus ^^eri et
adorari decreuit / Etsic de nomi^e ^^li posica Bell and Beelzebub Idolum ^^^^^uit

And of Ninus king of Assyvr
Arede hou that in his Empire
^e was noet after the second
Of hem that first Images found
For he right in semblable caas
Of Belus which her fader was
From Nembroth in the right line
Let make of gold and stones fine
A precious Image rich
After his fader evenlyche
And thereupon a law he set
That every man of pure debt
With sacryfyce and with truage
Honor should thylk Image
So that within time it fell
Of Belus came the name of Belle
Of Bell can Belsabub and so
The mysbyleue went tho
Tercia statua fuit illa que ad honorem Apis Regis Grecorum sculpta fu it / cui
nomen postea Scrapis inponentes quasi deum pagani coluerunt

The third Image next to this
When the king of Greece Apys
Was deed they made a figure
In resemblaunce of his stature
Of this king Apys seyth the book
That Serapys his name took
In whom thorugh long contynuau^ce
Of mysbyleue a great creaunce
They hadden and the reverence
Of sacryfyce and of encence
To him they made and they tell
Among the wondres that byfelle
When Alexander fro Candace
Came rydend in a wild place
Under an hylle a cave he fond
And Candalus which in that land
was bore / and was Candaces sone
Him told hou that of common wone
The gods were in thylk cave
And he that would assaye and have
A knoulechyng if it be soth
Light of his horse and in he goth
And fond therein that he sought
For thoru ye fendes sleyt him thout
Among other gods mo
That Scrapys spak to him tho
whom he saw there in great array
And thus the fend from day to day
The worship of Idolatrye
Trough forth upon the fantasye
Of hem that were than blind
And couthen naught the truth find
Thus have thou herd in what degree
Of Greece Egypt and Chaldee
The mysbylene whylome stood
And hou so they be not good
Ne true yet they sprongen out
Whereof the wide world about
His part of mysbyleue took
Till so by fell as seyth the book
That god a people for him selue
Has chose of the lygnages twelve
Whereof the sothe redyly
As it is written in Genesy
I think tell in such a wise
That it shall be to him a pryse
De Hebreorum seu Iudeorum secta quorum Sinagoga coclesia Cristi superueniente
defecit

aFter the flood fro which Noe
Was sauf ye world in his degree
Was made as who seyth new agein
Of flour of fruit of gras of grein
Of be of bird and of mankind
Which ever has be to god unkind
For not with stondynge all the fare
Of that this world was made so bare
And afterward it was restored
Among the men was nothing mored
Toward god of good living
But al was turned to lykyng
After the flesh so that foryete
Was he which yafe hem life and mete
Of heuene and earth creator
And thus came forth the great error
That they the high god ne knew
But maden other gods new
As thou have herd me said to fore
There was no man that time bore
That be ne bad after his choys
A god / to whom he yafe his voys
whereof the mysbyleue came
In to the time of Abraham
But he fond out the right weye
How only men should obey
The high god which weldeth al
And ever has done and ever shall
In heaven / in earth / and eke in hell
There is no thing his might may tell
This Patryarche to his lygnage
Forbad that they to none Image
Enclyne should in no wise
But her offrend and sacryfyse
With all the hoole hertes love
Unto the mighty god above
And they should him and no mo
And thus in thylk time tho
Bygan the feyth upon the earth
Which of byleues was the ferthe
Of ryghtwysenes it was conceived
So must it needs be received
Of him that al right is Inn
The high god which would win
A people unto his own feyth
On Abraham the ground he leyth
And made him for to multyplye
In to so great a progenye
That they Egypt al over sprad
But Pharao with wrong hem lad
In seruytude ayene the pees
Till god let send Moses
To make the delyueraunce
And for his people great vengeannce
He took / which to here a wonder
The king was slain ye lo^d put under
God bad the reed see deuyde
Which stood vpryght on every side
And yafe unto his people a weye
That they on foot it passed dreye
And gone so forth in to desert
Where for to keep hem in covert
The days when the son brent
A large cloud hem over went
And for to wyssen hem by night
A fyry pyler hem alyght
And when that they for hongre pleyn
The mighty god began to reyne
Manna fro heaven down to ground
Whereof that each of hem has fonnde
His fode such right as him list
And for they should upon him tryst
Right as who set a tonne a broche
And perced the hard roche
And spronge out water al at will
That man and best has bronke at will
And afterward he yafe the law
To moses that hem withdraw
They should not fro that he bad
And in this wise they be lad
Till they took in possessyon
The land of promyssyon
Where that Caleph and Iosue
The marches upon such degree
Departen after the lygnage
That each of hem as heritage
His pourpartye has vnderfonge
And thus stood this believe long
Which of prophets was governed
And they had eke the people learned
Of great honor that should hem fall
But at most need of all
They fayleden when Christ was bore
But hou that they her feyth have lore
It needs naught to tellen all The matter is so general
When Luafer was best in heuene
And ought most have stond in euene
Toward god he took debate
And for that he was obstynate
And would naught to truth enclyne
He fell for ever in to ruin
And Adam eke in paradys
When he stood most in all his prys^
After the state of Innocence
Ayene the god brake his defense
And fell out from his hye place a wey
And right by such manner weye
The Jews in her best plyght
When they should most parfyght
Have stand upon the prophecye
Tho fellen they to most folly
And him which was from heaven come
And of a maid his flesh has nome
And was among hem born and fed
As men that would naught be sped
Of gods sone with one voys
They henge and slough upon the croys
Whereof the parfyte of her law
Fro then forth was forth draw
So that they stand of no merit
Bnt in truage as folk subgect
Without propyrte of place
They lyuen out of gods grace
Dyspers in all lands out
And thus the feyth is come about^
That whylome in the Jews stood
Which is nonght parfytely good
To speak as it is now be fall
There is a feyth abouen all
In which the truth is comprehended
Whereof that we ben al amended
De fide Cristiana in qua perfect le gis complementum summi ^isterij
sacramentum nostreque saluacionis fundamentum infallibiliter consistere credimus

tHe high Almighty mageste
Of right wysenes and of pity
The sin / which that Adam wrout
When he saw time than he sout
And send his sone fro ye heuene
To set man's soul in euene
Which than was so forfalle
Upon the point which was so byfalle
That he ne might him self arise
Gregorye says in his apryse
It helps naught a man be bore
If gods sone were vnbore
For than through the first sin
Which whilom Adam brout us Inn
There sholden al men be lost
But Christ restores thylk lost
And bought it with his flesh and blood
And if we thynken hou it stood
Of thylk raunson which he paid
As saint gregorye it wrote and said
Al was behouely to the man
For that whereof his woo bygan
Was after cause of al his welthe
When he which is the well of health
The high creator of life
Upon the need of such a stryf
So would for his creature
Take on him self the forfeture
And suffer for the man's sake
Thus may no reason well forsake
That Ilke sin orygynal
Ne was the cause in specyal
Of man's worship at the last
Which shall withouten end last
For by that cause the godhede
Assembled was to the manhede
In the vyrgyne where he nome
Our flesh and very man become
Of bodily fraternity
Whereof the man in his degree
Stondeth more worthy as I have told
Then he did erst a thousand fold
Thorugh baptysme of the new law
Of the which Crist is lord and felawe
And thus the high gods might
Which was in the vyrgyne alyght
The man's soul has reconsyled
Which had long ben exyled
So stant the feyth upon the believe
Without which may no man acheue
To get him paradys ageyn
But this believe is so certain
So full of grace and of virtue
That what man that clepeth to Ihesu
In clean life forth with good deed
He may not faylen of heaven mede
So that it stand upon believe
That every man may well acheue
The which taken has the right feyth
For else as the gospel seyth
Salvation there may be none
And for to preche therupone
Thus Christ bad to his Apostles all
Whose power as now is fall
On us that be of holy church
If we the good deeds do wirche
For feyth only suffyseth naught
But good deed also be wrought
Now were it good that thou for thy
Which thorugh baptysme propyrly
Art unto Crystes feyth professed
Be wa^e that thou be not oppressed
With Antecrystes lollardye
For as the Jews prophecye
Was set of god for advantage
Right so this new tapynage
Of lollardye goth about
To set Crystes feyth in doubt
The saints that were us to fore
By whom the feyth was first up bore
That holy church stood releued
They oughten better be byleued
Than these which men know
Not holy though they feyne and blow
Here lollardye in man's ere
But if thou wylt live out of fere
Such new lore I read eschew
And hold forth the right weye and sewe
As thyn Auncestres did or this
So that thou believe naught amys
Christ wrought first / and after taught
So that the deed his word araught
He yafe ensample in his person
And we the words have alone
Like to the tree with leaves grene
Upon the which no fruit is seen
Nota quod cum Anthenor palladium Troie a Templo Minerue abstulit Tho as ibidem

The priest Thoas which of Mynerue
The Temple had for to serve
And the palladyon of Troy
Kept under keye for money
Of Anthenor which he has nome
Has suffered Antherior to come
And the palladyon to stele
Whereof the worship and the well
Of the Trojans ben overthrow
But Thoas at the same throw
When Anthenor the Iewele took
Wynkend cast awey his look
For a deceyte and for a wyle
As he that should him self begyle
He hyd his eyes fro the sight
And wend well that he so might
Excuse his false conseyence
I wot not if thylk euydence
Now at this time in here estates
Excuse might the prelates
^nowend hou the feyth dyscresyth
And al moral virtue ^^cyth
Whereof that they the keys bear
But yet hem lyketh not to stere
Here goos^ly eye for to see
The world in his aduersyte
They wol no labour^ undertake
To keep that hem is bytake
Christ dyed him self for the* feyth
But now our ferful prelate seyth
The life is sweet and that he keeps
So that the feyth vnholpe slepyth
And they under her ease entende
And in her lust her syf dyspende
And every man do what him list
Thus sta^t this world fulfilled of mis^
That noman sees the right weye
The wards of the church keye
Thorugh myshandelyng be mys wreynt
The worlds wawe has ny dreynt
The ship which Peter has to stere
The form is kept but the matere
Transformed is in other wise
But if they were gostly wise
And that the prelates weren good
As they by old days stood
It were than little need
Among the men to taken head
Of that they here pseudo tell
Which now is come for to duelle
To sow Cokkyll with the corn
So that the tylthe is nere hand lo^n
Which Christ sewe first his own hond
Now stant the Cokkylle in the land
Where stood whylome the good greyne
For the prelates now as men seyne
For slouthen that they should tylle
And that I tro we be the skylle
When there is lak in hem above
The people is straunged fro the love
Of truth in cause of Ignorance
For where there is no pnrueaunce
Of light men arn in the derk
But if the prelates would werk
Upon the feyth which they ve t^c^^
Men should naught her weye seche
Without light as now is used
Men see the charge al day refused
Which holy church has undertake

Where Christ him self is audytour
Which takes none head of wyn honor
The office of the Chauncellery
Or of the kings tresorye
Ne for the wryt ne for the will

The world which now so well we ^row
Shall make us than but a mow
So pass we without mede

But as we read that he spedde
The which his ^o^des besauntes he dde
And thereupon gat none en^rees
But at this time netheles

The world so lusty is to serve
That we with him ben al acorded
And that is wist and well recorded
Thorugh out this earth m al lands

For our tongues shall be stylle
And stand upon the Flesshes will
It were a trauayl for to preche
The feyth of Christ as for to teache

But every prelate hold his see
With all such as he may get
Of lusty drynk and lusty mete
Whereof the body fatt and full
Is unto gostely labor dull
And slough to handel thylk plough
But else we be swyft Enough
Toward the worlds auaryce
And that is as a sacryfyce
Which after the Apostel seyth
Is openly ayene the feyth
Unto the Idols you and granted
But netheles it is now haunted
And virtue changed in to vice
So that largess is Auaryce
In whose chapter mow we trete

So fer that ever while I live

Unto my self by many weye
But over this now would I prey^
To wit what the branches are
Of Auaryce and hou they fare
Als well in love as other wise
My sone and I the shall deuyse
In such a manner as they stand

There is no day which hem bedaweth
No More the son than the moon

But ever somewhat he over hyppeth

wHen Rome stood ^ noble plite
Virgile which was tho parfite
A myrrour made of his cler^^ /
And set it in the To wnes eye
Of marble upon payler without
That they by thyrty mile about
By day and eke also by night
In that my^our behold might
^yr enemies if any* were
With all here ordinance there
Which they ayene the cite cast
So that while thylk myrrour last
There was no land which myt acheue
With werre Rome for to grieve*
Whereof was great envy tho
And fell thylk time so
That Rome had werres strong
Again Cartage and stand long
The two cytees upon debate
Cartage saw the strong astate
Of Rome in thylk myrroure stand
And thought al pryuely to fond
To overthrow it by sum wyle
And hanybal was thylk while
The prince and leder of Cartage
Which had set al his courage
Upon knyghthode in such a wise
That he be worthy and be wise
And by none other was counseyled
Whereof the world is yet merueyled
Of the maystryes that he wrought
Upon the marches which he sought
And fell in thylke time also
The king of puyle which was tho
Thought ayene Rome to rebelle
And thus was take the quarelle
Hou to destroy this Emperor
Of Rome that tho was governor
Crassus which was so covetous
That he was ever desirous
Of gold to get the pyllage
Whereof that puyle and eke Cartage
With philosophres wise and great
Begynne*of this matter trete
And at last in this degree
There were Philosophres three
To do this thing which undertake
And thereupon they * with hem took
A great tresour of gold in cofres
To Rome and thus these philosophres
To gedre in company went
But noman wise what they meant
When they to Rome come were
So pryuely they duelt there
As they that thoughten to deceyne
Was none that myt of hem perceive
Till they in sundry stedes have
Her gold under the earth begraue
In tresours that to be hold
They sheld seem as they were gold
And so forth then upon a day
Al openly in good array*
To the emperor they then present
And tolden it was her entente
To duelle under his seruyse
And he hem axeth in what wise
And they him told in such a plyte
That each of hem had a spyryt
The which sle^end a night appears
And hem by sundry dremes lereth
After the world that has betyd
Under the ground if ought be hyd
Of old tresour at any throw
They shall it in sweuene know
And upon this condycyon
They*seyn what gold under the town
Is hyd of Rome they wol it find
There shall naught be left behind
Be so that he haluen dele
Hem grants and he assenteth well
And thus came sleyghte for to duelle
With couetyse as I the tell
This emperor bad redyly
That they be lodged fast by
Where he his own body lay
And when it was at morrow day
That one of hem says that he met
Whele he a gold hoord should fette
Whereof this Emperor was glad
And thereupon anon he had
His ^^nours for to goo and mine
And he him self of that couyne
Goth forth with all and at his hond
The tresour ready there he fond
Where as they said it should be
And who was than glad but he
Upon this other day second
They have another gold hoord found
Which the second master took
Upon his sweuene and undertook
And thus the sothe ^^peryence
To the emperor yafe such credence
That al his trust and al his feyth
So sekyrlyc^e on hem he leyth
Of that he fond him so releued
That they be parfytely believed
As though they were gods three
Now herkne the subtylyte
The third master should mete
Which as they saiden should mete
Above hem al and couthe most
And he without noise or bost
Al pryuelycho so as he would
Upon the morrow his sweuene told
To the emperor right in his ere
And said him that he wist where
A Tresour was so plentyuous
Of gold and eke so precious
Of Iewelles and rich stones
That unto al his horse at ones
It were a charge suffisaunt
This lord upon this covenant
Was glade and axeth where it was
The master said under the glass
He told him eke as for the mine
He would ordeyne such engyne
That they the werk should vndersett
With timbre and without let
Men may the Tresour sauely delue
So that the myrrour by him selue
Without empeirement shall stand
And thus the master upon hand
Has undertake in all weye
This lord which had his wit alweye
And with couetise blent
Anon thereto yafe his assent
And thus to mine forth with a^
The tymbre set up oueral
whereof the pyler stood up right
Til it byfelle upon a night
These clerks when they were ware
Hou that the Tymbre only bare
The piler where the myrroure stood
Here slight no man understood
They go by night unto the mine
with pitche with sulphir and with ^^syne
And when the cite was a sleep
A wild fire in to the deep
They cast among the tymbre werk
And so forth while the night is derk
Desguysed in a pouer array
They passeden the Town or day
And when they comen upon an hell
They sawen hou the myrrour fell
Whereof they made joy enough
And each of hem with other lough
And said / Loo what Couetyse
May do with hem that be not wise
And that was proved afterward
For every land to Rome ward
Which had be subgett to fore
When that myrrour was forlore
And they the wonder herd seye
Anon begone dysobeye
With werres upon every side
And thus has Rome lost his pride
And was defouled oueral
For this I find of Hanybal
That he of Romans in a day
When he hem out of away
So great a multitude slough
That of gold rings which he drou
Of gentyle hands that been deed
Busshellys full three I read
He feld / and made a bridge also
That he might over Tyber goo
Upon the corpse tha^t deed were
Of the Romans which he slou there
But now to speak of the Iuyse
The which after the couetyse
Was take upon this Emperor
For he destroyed the myrrour
It is a wonder for to here
The Romans made a chayere
And set her Emperor therein
And sayden for he would win
Of gold the superfluyte
Of gold he should plente
Receive till he said ho
And with gold which they had tho
Boylend hot within a pan
In to his mouth they pour thanne
And thus ye thirst of / gold was queint
With gold which had been atteynt
Whereof my sone thou might here
When couetyse has lost the stere
Of reasonable governance
There falls often great greuaunce
For there may be no werse thing
Then couetyse about a king
If it in his person be
It does the more aduersyte
And if it in*his counseyl stond
It brings al day meschyef to hond
Of common harm and yf*it grow
Within his court it wol be know
For than shall the king be*pyled
The man which has his land tyled
Awayteth naught more redyly
The heruest than they gredely
Ne maken then ward and watch
Where they the profit myten catch
And yett full often it falls so
As men may seen among hem tho
That he which most coueyteth fast
Has lest advantage at last
For when fortune is there again
Though he coueyte it is in vein
The happes ben naught al alyche
One is made pouer another rich
The court to some it does profit
And some ben ever in one plyte
And yet they both alyche sore
Coueyte but fortune is more
Unto that one part favorable
And though it be naught reasonable
This thing may a man seen al day
Whereof that I the tell may
After ensample in remembrance
Hou every man may take his chance
Or of Richesse or of pouerte
Hou so it stand of the deserte
Here is nought*euery thing aguyte
For often a man may see this yet
That who best does lest shall have
It helps naught the world to crave
Which out of / reule and of mesure
Has ever stand in adventure
As well in court as else where
And hou in all days there
It stood so as the things fell
I think a tale for to tell
Ic ponit ^xhemplum contra illos qui in domibns Regum seruientes pro eo quam
ipsi secundum eorum cupidita tem promoti non existunt de Regio ser uicio Puis
in e^^nm defectu indiserete murmurant

IN a Cronyke this I read
About a king as must need
Thereof was knights and squyers
Great route and eke officers
Some of long time him had served
Ano thouten that they have deseruid
Auauncement and gone without
And some also ben of the route
That comen but a while agone
And they auaunced were anon
These old men upon this thing
So as they durst ageyn the king
Among hem self compleynen often
But there is no thing said so soft
That it ne comes out at last
The king it wist and als fast
As he which was of high prudence
He shope therefore an euydence
Of hem that pleynen in that cas
To know in whose defaute it was
And al within his own intent
That noman wist what it meant
Anon he beat two cofres make
Of one semblaunce of one make
So lyche that no life thylk throw
That one may fro that other know
They were in to his Chamber brought
But noman wot why they be brout
And netheles the king has bid
That they be set in pryue stead
As he yt was of wisdom sly
When he thereto his time sygh
Al pryuelyche that none it wist
His own hondes that one kyst
Of fyn gold and fine perrye
The which out of his tresorye
Was take anon he feld full
That other cofre of straw and mull
With stones meuyd he feld also
Thus be they full both two
So that erlyche upon a day
He bad within there he lay
There should to fore his bed
A board up set and fair spread
And than he let the cofres fette
Upon the board and did hem set
He knew the names well of tho
The which ayene him grutched so
Both of his chamber and of his halle
Anon and sent for hem all
And said to hem in this wise
There shall no man him despise
I wot well ye have long served
And god wot what ye have deserved
But if it is on long on me
Of that ye bnauaunced be
Or else if it be long on you
The soth shall be preued now
To stop with your evil word
Loo here two Cofres on the board
These which you list of both two
And wyteth well that one of tho
As with Trosour so full bygone
That if ye hap therupone
Ye shall be rich men for ever
Now chese and take which you is lever
But be well ware or that ye take
For of that one I undertake
There is no manner good therein
Whereof ye myghten profit win
Now goth to gyder of one assent
And makes your auysement
For but I you this day auaunce
It stant upon your own chance
Al only in defaulte of grace
So shall be showed in this place
Upon you all well ofyne
That no defaute shall be mine
They knelen al and and with one voys
The king they thanken of this choys
And after that they up arise
And gone aside and hem auyse
And at last they acorde
Whereof her tale to record
That to what yssu they befalle
A knight shall speak for hem all
He kneleth down to the king
And says that they upon this thing
Or for to win or for to lose
Ben al auysed for to chese
Tho took this knyhht a yerd on hond
And goth there as the cofres stond
And with thassent of eueryehone
He leyd his yard upon one
And seyth the king hou thylk same
They chese in reguerden by name
And preyth him yt they myt it have
The king which would his honor save /
When he has herd the common voys
Has grants hem her own choys
And took hem thereupon the keye
But for he would it were seye
What good they have as they suppose
He bad anon the cofre unclose
Which was fulfilled of straw and stones
Thus be they served al at ones
This thing than in the same stead
Anon that other Cofre vndede
Where as they sawen great Richesse
Well more than they couthen guess
Loo serth the king now may ye see
That there is no defaute in me
For thy my self I wol acquyte
And bears ye your own wit
Of that fortune has refused
Thus was this wise king excused
And they left of here cuyl speech
And mercy of here king byseche
Nota hic de diuiciarum accidencia vbi narrat qualiter Fredericus Imperator
Romanorum duos pauperrs auditut litigantes, quorum vnus dixit / been potest
ditari quem Rex vult ditare Et alius dixit quem deus vult ditare dives erit /
que Rex cum ad experimentum postea probata fuisset ille qui deum inuocabat
pastellum auro plenum sortitus est, alius vero caponis pastellum sort preelegit

sOmdele to this matter like
I find a tale hou frederyk
Of Rome that time emperor
Herd as he went a great clamor
Of two beggars upon the weye
That one of hem bygan to seye
A lord well may the man be Rich
Whom that a king list to rich
That other said no thing so
But he is rich and well begoo
To whom that god wol send well
And thus they maden words feel
Whereof this lord has head nome
And did hem both for to come
To the paleys where he shall ete
And bad ordeyne for her mete
Two pasteyes which he let do make
And a capon in that one was bake
And in that other for to win
Of floreyns all that* may within
He let do put a great Richesse
And even as lyche as might guess
Outward they were both two
This beggar was commanded tho
He that which held him to the king
That he first chese / upon this thing
He saw hem but he felt hem naught
So that upon his own thought
He chese the capon and forsook
That other / which his felawe took
But when he wist hou that it ferde
He seyth aloude that men it herd
Now am I certainly conceived
That he may lightly be deceived
That trysteth unto man's help
But well is him that god wol help
For he stant on the syker side
Which else should goo beside
I see my felawe well recover
And I mote duelle stylle pouer
Thus spak the beggar his intent
And pouer he came and pouer he went
Of that he has Richesse sought
His infortuue it would naught
So may it show in sundry wise
Between fortune and couetyse
The chance is cast upon a dee
But yet a man may full often see
Inowe of such netheles
Which put hem self ever in pres
To get hem good / and yet they fail
And for to speak of this entayle
Touchend of love in thy matere
My good sone as thon might here
That right as with tho men stood
Of infortune of worlds good
As thou have me herd tell above
Right so full often it stant by love
Though thou coueyte it evermore
Thou shall have no dele the more
But only that which the is shape
The remenaunt is but a iape
And netheles I now of tho
There ben that now coueyte so
That where as they a woman see
Ye ten or twelve though there be
The love is now so unadvised
That where the beauty stant assysed
The man's heart anon is there
And rouneth tales in her ere
And seyth how that he loves streyte
And thus he set him to coueyte
An honderd though he saw a day
So should he more than he may
But for the great couetyse
Of sotye and fool empryse
In each of hem he fynt somewhat
That pleseth him or this or that
Some one for she is white of kyn
Some one for she is noble of kyn
Some one for she has a rody cheke
Some one for that she seems meke
Some one for she has eyes greye
Some one for she can laugh and pleye
Some one for she is long and small
Some one for she is lyte and tal
Some one for she is pale and bleche
Some one for she is soft of speech
Some one for that she is camused
Some one for that she has not be used
Some one for she can dauuce / and sing
So that some thing to his lykyuge
He fynt and though no more he feel
But that she has a little hele
It is Enough that he therefore
Her love and thus an honderd score
While they be new he would he had
Whom he forsakes she shall be bad
The blind man no color demeth
But al is one right as him seems
So has his lust no judgment
Whom couetyse of love blent
Him thinks that to his couetyse
How all the world ne may suffyse
For by his will he would have all
If that it might so byfalle
So is he common as the street
I set naught of his beyete
My sone have thou such couetyse
Nay fader such love I despise
And while I live shall done ever
For in good feyth yet had I lever
Than to coueyte in such a weye
To ben for ever till I deye
As pour as Job and loueles
Out taken one for haules
His thanks is noman a live
For than a man should al vnthryue
There ought no wyseman coueyte
The law was not set so streyte
For thy my self with all to save
Such one there is I would have
And noue of al these other mo
My sone of that thou would so
I am naught wroth bnt over this
I wol the tell hou it is
For there be men which otherwise
Right ouly for the couetyse
Of that they see a woman rich
There wol they al her love affyche
Nonght for the beauty of her face
Ne yet for virtue ne for grace
Which she has else right Enough
But for the park and for the plough
And other things which thereto lo^geth /
For in none otherwise there longs /
To love but if they profyt find
And if the profit be behind
Her love is ever less and less
For after that she has richesse
Here love is of proporcyon
If thou have such condycyon
My sone tell right as it is
Mine holy fader nay Iwys
Condycyon such have I none
For truly fader I love one
So well with all mine hertes thoug^ht
That certes though she had naught
And were as pour as Medea
Which was exyled for Creusa
I would her naught the less love
Ne though she were at her above
As was the Rich queen Canda^e
Which to deserve love and grace
To Alysander that was king
Yofe many a worthy rich thing
Or else as Pantasylee
Which was the queen of Femyne
And great Richesse with her nam
When she for love of Hector came
To Troy in rescous of the town
I am of such condycyon
That though my lady of her selue
Where also rich as such twelve
I couthe not though it were so
No better love her than I do
For I love in so pleyne a wise
That for to speak of couetyse
As for pouerte or for richesse
My love is nouther more ne less
For in good feyth I tro we this
So covetous no man is
For why and he my lady syghe
That he thorugh lokyng of his eye
Ne should have such a stroke withyn
That for no gold he might wyn
He should naught her love asterte
But if he left there his heart
Be so it were such a man
That couthe-skylle of a woman
For there be men so rude some
When they among the women come
They gone under protectyon
That love and his affectyon
Ne shall not take hem by the sleue
For they ben out of that believe
Hem lusts of no lady cheer
But ever thynkend here and there
Where as the gold is in the Cofte
And wol none other love profre
But who so wot what love amou^teth
And by reason trulyche acompteth
Then may he know and taken head
That all the lust of womanhede
Which may ben in a lady face
My lady has and eke of grace
If men should yeuen here apryse
They may well seye hou she is wise
And sobre and simple of contenaunce
And all that to good governance
Belongs of a worthy wight
She has pleynly for thylk night
That she was bore as for the nones
Nature set in her al at ones
Beauty with bounte so byseyn
That I may well afferme and seyn
I saw yet never creature
Of comlyheede and of feture
In any kings Regyon
Be lyche her in comparyson
And thereto as I have you told
Yet has she more a thousand fold
Of bounte and shortly to tell
She is pure heed and well
And myrroure and ensample of good
Who so her virtues understood
Me thinks it ought enough suffyse
Withouten other couetyse
To love such one and to serve
Which with her chere can deserve
To be byloued better ywys
Than she par cas that rychest is
And has of gold a mylyon
Such has be mine opinion
And ever shall / and nevertheless
I say naught she is haueles
That she nys rich and well at ese
And has Enough where with to plese
Of worlds good whom that her list
But one thing I would well ye wist
That never for no worlds good
Mine heart unto her ward stood
But only right for purr love
That wot the high god above
Now fader what ye say thereto
Confessor
My sone I say it is well do
For take of this right good believe
What man that wol him self releue
To love in any other wise
He shall well find his couetyse
Shall sore grieve him at last
For such a love may not last
But now men seyn our days
Men taken but a few assayes
But if the cause be richesse
For thy the love is well the less
And who that would ensamples tell
By old days as they fell
Than might a man well understand
Such love may not long stand
Now herkne sone and thou shall here
A great ensample of this matere
Hic ponit Exemplum contra istos qui non propter amorem sed propter diuicias
sponsalia sumunt! Et narrat de quodam Regis Apubic Senescalla qui non solum
propter pecuniam vxorem duxit / sed eciam pecunie come^cis vxorem sibi
desponsatam vendidit

tO trete upon the cas of love
So as we tolden here above
I find write a wonder thing
Of puyle whysome was a king
A man of high complexyon
And young but his affectyon
After the nature of his age
Was yet not fall in his courage
The lust of women for to know
So it betyd upon a throw
This lord fell in to great sekenes
Phisyk has done the hesynes
Of sundry cures many one
To make him hoole and thereupon
A worthy master which there was
Yafe him counseyl upon this cas
That if he would have parfyte heel
He should with a woman dele
A fresshe a young a lusty wight
To done him compauye a night
For than he said him redely
That he shall be al hole there by
And otherwise he knew no cure
This king which stood in adventure
Of life and death for medycyne
Assented was and of couyne
His styward whom he trusts well
He took and told him every del
Hou that this master has said
And thereupon he has him prayed
And charged upon his lygeaunce
That he do make purueaunce
Of such one as be couenable
For his plesaunce and delytable
And bad him hou that ever it stood
That he shall spare for no good
For his will is right well to pay
The styward said he would assaye
Bnt now here after thou shall wit
As I find in the books write
What couetyse in love does
This styward for to tell soth
Among all the men on live
A lusty lady has to wyue
Which netheles for gold he took
And nout for love as seyth the book
A rich merchant of the land
Her fader was and her fond
So worthily / and such Richesse
Of worlds good and such largess
With her he yafe in marriage
That only for thylk advantage
Of gold the styward has her take
For lucre and naught for loves sake
And that was in the stiward well seen
Now herkne what it wol mean
The styward in his own heart
Sow that his lord may not asterte
His maladye but he have
A lusty woman him to save
And though he would give Enough
Of his tresour whereof he drough
Great couetyse in to his mind
And set his honor fer behind
Thus he whom gold has ouerset
Was trapped in his own net
The gold has made his wits lame
So that sechend his own shame
He rouneth in the kings ere
And said that he wyste where
A gentyl and a lusty one
Tho was and thither would he gone
But he mote yiue yeftes great
For but if it be through great beyete
Of gold he said he should not speed
The king him bad upon the need
That take an honderd pound he should
And give it where that he would
Be so it were in worthy place
And thus to stand in loves grace
This king his gold has habandouned
And when this tale was full rouned
The Styward took the gold and went
Within his heart and many a went
Of couetyse than he cast
Whereof a purpoos at the last
Ayene love and ayene his right
He took and said hou thylk night
His wife shall lygge by the kyng^
And goth thynkend upon this thing
Toward his Inn till he ca in home
In to the chamber and there he nome
His wife and told her all the cas
And she which read for shame was
With both her hands has him praid
^enelend / and in; this wise said
That she to reason and to skylle
In what thing that he bydde will
Is ready for to done his heste
But this thing were not honest
That he for gold her should selle
And he tho with his words fell
Forth with his gastely contenaunce
Seyth that she shall done obeysaunce
And follow his will in every place
And thus through strength of his ma
nace / Her Innocence is ouerlad
Whereof she was so sore adrad
That she his will mote need obey
And thereupon was shape a weye
That he his own wife by night
Has out of al men's sight
So pryuely that none it wist
Brout to the king which as him list
May do with her what he would
For when she was there as she should
With him a bed under the cloth
The styward took his leave and goth
In to the chamber fast by
But hou he slepte that wot not I
For he saw cause of Ielousye
But he which has the company
Of such a lusty one as she
Him thought that of his degree
There was noman so well at ese
She does all that she may to plese
So that al / his heart she had
And thus this king his joy lad
Till it was nyhe upon the day
The Styward than where she lay
Came to the bed and in his wise
Has bid she should arise
The king said nay she should not go
His styward said again naught so
For she mote gone er it be know
And so I swore that ylke throw
When I her fette to you here
The king his tale would not here
And seyth hou that he has her bout
For thy she shall depart naught
Till the bright day be hold
And in his arms he began her fold
As he which list for to pleye
And bad his styward gone aweye
And so he did ayene his will
And thus his wife a bed stylle
Lay with the king the long night
Till that it was high son light
But who she was he knew no thing
Tho came the styward to the king
And prayed him that without shame
In saving of her own name
He might leden home ayene
This lady and told him pleyne
Hou that it was his own wife
The king his ere unto his stryf
Has leyd and when that he it herd
Well nyhe out of his wit he ferde
And said A caytyf most of al
Where was it ever or this byfalle
That any Coward in this wise
Betoke his wife for conetyse
Thou have her and me begyled
And eke thine own estate reuyled
Whereof that buxome unto the
Here after shall she never be
For this auowe to god I make
After this day if I the take
Thou shall be honged and to draw
Now look anon thou be withdraw
So that I see the never more
This Styward that drad him sore
With all the have that he may
And fled awey the same day
And was exyled out of land
Loo there a nyce hysbond
Which thus his wif has lost for ever
But netheles she had a lever
The king her weddeth and honors
Whereof her name she secoureth
Which erst was lost through couetyse
Of him that lad her other wise
And has him self also forlore
My sone be thou ware therefore
Where thou shall love in any place
That thou no couetyse embrace
The which is not of loves kind
But for all that a man may find
Now in this time of thylk rage
Full great dysese in marriage
When venym medleth with the sucre^
And marriage is made for lucre
Or for the lust or for the hele
What man that shall with other dele
He may not fail to repent
My fader such is mine entente
But netheles good is to have
For good may oftyme save
The love which should else spylle
But god which wot my hertes will
I dar well take to witness
Yet was I never for Richesse
Be set with marriage none
For all mine heart is upon one
So freely that in the person
Stant al my worlds joy alone
I axe another park ne plough
If I her had it were Enough
Her love should me suffyse
Withouten other couetyse
Loo now my fader as of this
Touchend of me right as it is
My shryfte I am be know pleyn
And if yr wol ought else seyn
Of couetyse if there be more
In love agropeth out the sore
Fallere cum nequeat propria vir fraud subornat / Testes sic que eis vera
retorta fides / Sicut Agros cupidus du^ querit amans mulieres / Vult testes
falsos falsus habere suos / Non sine vi dicta periurus abibit in eis / Visu qui
cordis intima cuncta videt / Fallere per iuro non est laudanda puella in /
Glory a set falso condicionis opus

hIc tractat super illis auaricie speciebus que falsum testimonium et periurum
nu^cupantur quorum fraudulenta circumuencio tam in cupiditatis que in amoris
causa sui desiderij propositum quam sepe fallaciter attingit

mY sone thou shall understand
Hou couetyse has yet on ho^de
In specyal two cou^seyllours
That been also his procurours
The first of hem is false witness
Which ever is ready to witness
What thing his master wol him hot
Periure is the second hot
Which spares naught to swear an oath
Though it be falls and god be wroth
That one shall falls wytnes bear
That other shall the thing for swear
When he his charged on the book
So what with hepe and what with croke
They make here master often win
And wol not know what is the sin
Of couetyse and thus men seyn
They make many a falls barg^eyn
There may no true quarrel arise
In thylk queste and thylk assyse
Where as they two the people inform
For they keep ever one manner form
That upon gold here conscience
They found and take here euydence
And thus with falls wytnes and oaths
They win hem mete drynk and clothe^
Right so there be who that hem knew
Of these lovers full many untrue
Now may a woman find ynowe
That each of hem when he shall wowe
Anon he would his hand down leyn
Upon a book and swear and seyn
That he wol feyth and truth bear
And thus he profereth him to swe^e
T^ se^uen ever till he deye
And al is very trecherye
For when the soth him self tries
The more he sw^reth the more he lies
When he his feyth makes al there m^st
Then may a woman trust him lest
For till he may his will acheue
He is no l^nger for to leave
Thus is the truth of love exyled
An^ ma^y a good woman begyled
And eke to speak of falls witness
There be now such many I g^sse
That lyche unto the prouysours
They make hem her preuy procura
tours To tell hou there is such a man
Which is worthy to love and can
All that a good man should conne
So that with lesyng he has bygo^ne
The cause in which he wol proceed
And also syker as the creed
They make of that they known falls
And thus full often about the hals
Love is of falls men embraced
But love which is so purchaced
Come afterward to little pryse
For thy my sone / if thou be wise
Now thou have herd this euydence
Thou might thine own conscience
Oppose if thou have be such one
Nay god wot fader I am none
Ne never was / for as men seyth
When that a man shall make his feyth
His heart and tongue must acorde
For if so be that they dyscorde
Then is he falls and else naught
And I dare say as of my thought
In love it is not dyscordable
Unto my word but a^ordablo
And m this wise fader I
May right well swear and saufly
That I my lady love well
For that acordeth every del
It needs naught to my soth saw
That I witness should draw
In to this day for never yett
Ne might it synke in to my wit
That I my counseyl should seye
To any wight or me bewreye
To sechen help in such manner
But only of my lady dear
And though a thousand men it wys^
That I her love and than ^em list
With me to swer^ and to witness
Yet were that no falls witness
For I dare unto this truth dwell
I love her more than I can tell
Thus am I fader gylteles
As ye have herd / and nethele^
In your dome I put it al
My sone wit in specyal
It shall not comonlyche fail
Al though it for a time faylle
That falls witness his cause speed
Upon the point of his falsheede
It shall afterward be kyd
Whereof so as it is betyd
Ensample of such things blind
In Cronyke write I find
Hic ponit Exemplum de illis qui falsum testificantes amoris Innocenciam
circumu^niunt / Et narrat qualiter The^is Achillem filium suum adolesce^ tem
muliebri vestitum apparatu asserens esse puellam inter Regis Lichomedis filias
ad educandum produxit / Et si^ Achilles d^cepto Rege filie sue Deidamie socia
et cubicularia effectus super Ipsam Pir^um geniut* qui post a mire probitatis
mil^iciam assecutus mortem patris sui apud Troiam Polix ene Tirannice vindicauit

tHe goddess of the sea Thetis
She had a sone and his name is
Achilles whom to keep and ward
While he was young and in to ward
She thought him saufly to be take
As she which drad for his sake
Of that was said in prophecye
That he at Troy^ should dye
When that the cyt^ was byleyn
For thy so as the books seyn
She cast her wit in sundry wife
Hou she him might so desguyse
That no man should his body know
And so byf^lle that ylke throw
While that she thou^t upon this deed
There was a king which Lychomede
Was hot / and he was well begone
With fair daughters many one
And duelt f^r out in an isle
Now shall thou here a wonder wyle
This queen which the mother was
Of Achilles upon this cas
Her s^^e as a maiden were
Let cloth^^ in the same gere
Which longs unto womanhede
As he was young a took no^^ head
But suffers al that she him deed
Whereof she has her women bid
And charge by her other all
Hou so it afterward byfalle
That they dyscouer naught this t^^ng
But feyne and make a knoulechyng
Upon the counseyl which was nom^
In every place where they come
To tell and to witness this
How he her lady daughter is
And right in such a manner wise
She bad they should done her seruyse
So that Achilles vnderfongeth
As to a young lady belongs
Honor service and reverence
For Thetys with great dylygen^^
Him has so taught and affayted
That hou so (...) were awayted
With sobre and go^tely contenaunce
He should his womanhede auaunce
That none the soth know might
But that in every man's sight
He should seem a pure maid
And m such wise as she him said
Achilles which that Ilke while
Was young upon him to smyle
Bigan when he was so besein
And thus after the books sein
With frette of perle upon his head
Al fresshe bitwene the white and read
As she which tho was tender of age
Stood the color in his visage
That for to look upon his cheke
And seen his childy manner eke
He was a woman to behold
And than his mother to him told
That she him had so begone
By cause that she thought gone
To Lichomede at thilke tide
Where that she said he should abide
Among his daughters for to duelle
Achilles herd his mother tell
And wist nonght the cause why
And netheles full buxo^^ly
He was ready to that s^e bad
Whereof his mode^ was right glad
To Lychomede and forth they went
And when ^he king knew her intent
And s^we this youg daughter there
And that it came unto his ere
Of such record of such witness
He had right a great gladness
Of that he soth saw and herd
And he that wot not hou it ferde
Upon the counseyl of the need
But for all that king Lychomede
Has toward him his daughter take
And for Thetys his mother sake
He put her in to company
To duelle with Deydamye
His own daughter the eldest
The fairest and the comlyest
Of al his daughters which he had
Loo thus Thetys the cause lad
And left there Achilles feyned
As he which has him self restreyned
In all that ever he may and can
Out of the manner of a man
And took his womannyssh chere
Whereof unto his bedfere
Deydamye he has by night
Where kind would him selue ^yght
After the Philosophers seyn
There may no wight be there ageyn
And that was thylk time seen
The long nyghtes hem between
Nature which may not forbere
Has made hem both for to stere
They kyssen first / and ouermore
The high wey of loves lore
They gone and al was done in deed
Whorof lost is the maydenhede
And that was afterward well know
For it byfel that ylk throw
As at Troy where the syege lay
Upon the cause of Menelay
And of his queen Dame Eleyn^
The greg^ys hadden much p^yne
Al day to fight and to assail
But for they might naught avail
So noble a cite for to win
A pryue counseyll they begin
In sundry wise where they tret^
And at last among the great*
They fellen unto his acord
That Phor^eus of his record
Which was an Astronomyen
And eke a great magycyen*
Should of his calculacyon
Search after constellacyon
Hou they the cite myghten get
And he which had naught foryet^
Of that belongs to a clerk
His study set upon this werk
So long about his wit he cast
Till that he fond oute^at last
But if they hadden Achylles
Here^werre shall be endeles
And oner that he told hem pleyn
In what manner he was byseyn
And in what place he shall be found
So that within a little stounde
Vlyxes forth with Dyomede
Upon this point to Lychomed^
Agamen on to geder sent
But vlyxes or he forth went
Which was one of the most wise
Ordained has in such a wise
That he the most rychest array
Whereof a woman may be gay
With him he took manyfolde
And ouermore as is told
An harnoys for a lusty knight
Which burued was as silver bright
Of sword of plate and eke of mayle
As though he should do battle
He took also with him by ship
And thus to geder in felaushyp
Forth this Dyomede and he
In hope till they myghten see
The place where Achylles is
The wind stood not than ^mys
But every topseyle cole it blewe
Till Vlyxes the marches knew
Where Lychomede his regne had
The styresman so well him lad
That they be comen sauf to land
Where they gone out upon the stronde
In to the burgh where that they found
The king / and he which has facounde
Vlyxes did the message
But the counseyl to his courage
Why that he came he told naught
But underneath he was bethought
In what manner he might aspye
Achilles from Deydamye
And fro these other that there were
Full many a lusty lady there
They pleyd them there a day or two
And as it was fortuned so
It fell that time in such a wise
To Bachus that a sacryfyce
These young ladies should make
And so the strange men's sake
That come fro the syege of Troy
They maden well the more joy
There was revel there was daunsyng
And every life which couthe sing
Of lusty women in the route
A fresshe carolle has song about
But for all this netheles
The greeks unknow of Achilles
So weren that m no degree
They ^outhen wit which was he
Ne by his voys ne by his paas
Vlyxes than upon this caas
A thing of high prudence has wrout
For thylk array which he has bout
To give among the women there
He let^ do fetten all the gere
Forth with a knights harnoys eke
In all a country for to seek
Men sholden naught a fay^er see
And every thing in his degree
Endelong upon a boorde he leyde
To Lychomede and than he preyde
That every lady ches^ should
What thing of all that she would
And take it as by wey of yefte
For they hem self it should shefte
He said after her own will
Achylles than stood naught stylle
When he the bright hel^e beheld
The sword the hauberk and the shield
His heart fell thereto anon
Of al* that other would he none
The knights ge^e he vnderfongeth
And thylk array which that belongs
Unto the women he forsook
And in this wise as seyth the book
They known than which he was
For he goth forth the great paas
In to the chamber where he lay
Anon and made no delay
He armeth him in knyghtely wise
That better can no man deuyse
And as fortune should fall
He came forth to fore hem all
As he which tho was glad Enough
But Lychomede no thing lough
When that he saw how that it ferde
And than he wist well and herd
His daughter had be forleyn
But that he was so / ouerseyn
The wonder ouergoth his wit
For in Cronyke is wreton yet
Thing which shall never be foryete
Hou that Achilles has byge^e
Pyrrus upon Deydamye
Whereof came out the trecherye
Of falls wytnes when they said
Hou Achylles was a maid
But that was no thing seen tho
For he is to the syege go
Forth with Vlyxes and Dyoinede
Loo thus was proved m the deed
And fully spoke at thylk while
If one woman another begyle
Where is there any sekyrnesse
When Thetys which was the goddess
Deydamye has so beiaped
I not hou it shall ben escaped
With tho women whose Innocence
Is now al day thorugh such credence
Deceived often as it is seen
With men that such untruth mean
For they ben slye in such a wise
That they by sleyghte and by queyntyse
Of falls witness bryngen Inn
That does hem often for to win
Where they be not worthy therw
For thy my sone do not so
My fader as of falls witness
The truth and the manner express
Touchend of love hou it bath ferd
As ye have told I have well herd
But for ye sayden otherwise
Hou thylk vice of couetyse
Has yet periure of his acord
If that thou list of some record
To tell another tale also
In loves cause of time ago
What thing it is to be forswore
I would preye you therefore
Whereof I might ensample take
My good sone and for thy sake
Touchand of this I shall fulfylle
Thyn axyng at thine own will
And the matere I shall declare
How the women deceived are
When they so tender herb be re
Of that they here men so swear
But when it comes to thassay
There find it falls another day
As Jason did to Medee
Which stant yet of auctoryte
In tokne and in memoryal
Whereof the tale in specyal
Is in the book of Troy write
Which I shall do the for to wit
hIc in amoris causa ponit exemplum contra perinros Et narrat qualiter Jason
priusquam ad Insulam col chos pro aureo vellere ibidem conquestando transmearet
in amorem and couiugium Regis Othonis filie iuramento firmius se astrinxit /
sed suo postea completo negocio cu^ ipsa^ secu^ nauigio i^ grecia^ perduxisset

dictam Medeam pro quadam causa Regis Creontis filia periurus dereliquit

IN greece whylome was a king
Of whom the fame and knoulechyng
Byleueth yet and peleus
He hyghte but it fell him thus
That his fortune her whele so lad
That he no child his own had
To regne after his decesse
He had a brother netheles
Whose right name was Eson
And he has the worthy knight Jason
Bygoten / in which in every land
Al other passed of his hond
In arms so that he the best
Was named and the worthyest
He sought worship oueral
Now herkne and I the tell shall
An adventure that he sought
Which afterward full dear he bought
There was an I Will which Colchos
Was cleped and thereof awos
Great speech in land about
That such marvel was none out
In all the wide world nowhere
As tho in that I Will there
There was a sheep as it was told
The which his flees bare al of gold
And so the gods had it set
That it ne might a wey be fette
By power of no worlds wight
And yet full many a worthy knight
At had assayed as they dorst
And ever it fell hem to the worst
But he that would it naught forsake
But of his knyghthode undertake
To do what thing thereto belongs
This worthy Jason sore alongeth
To see the strange regyons
And know the condycyous
Of other / marches where he went
And for that cause his hoole intent
He set Colchos for to seek
And thereupon he did* speak
To Peleus his eme the king
And he well paid was of that thing
And shope anon for his passage
Such as were of his lygnage
With other knights which he chees
With him he took and Hercules
Which full was of chyualrye
With Jason went in company
And that was in the month of may
When cold storms were away
The wynd was good ye ship was yare
They took her leave and forth they fare
Toward Colchos but on the weye
What hem byfelle is long to seye
Hou Lamedon the king of Troy
Which ought well have made hem ioyr
When they to rest a while him preide
Out of his land he hem congeyde
And so fell the dyssencyon
Which afterward was destructyon
Of that cite as men may here
But that is not to my matere
But thus this worthy folk gregoys
Fro that king which was not curtois
And fro his land with seyl vpdrawe
Then^e went hem forth and many a saw
They made and many a great manace
Till at last in to that place
Which as they sought they arryue
And stryken seyle and forth as blyue
They senten unto the king and tolden
Who were there and what they wolden
Oetes which than was king
When that he herd this tydyng
Of Jason which was comen there
And of these other what they were
He thought done hem great worship
For they anon come out of ship
And strayt unto the king they went
And by the hand Jason he hent
And that was at the paleys gate
So fer on the king came on his gate
Toward Jason to done hem chere
And he whom lakketh no manner
When he the king saw in presence
Yafe him ageyn such reverence
As to a kings state belongs
And thus the king him vnderfongeth
And Jason in his arm he caught
And forth in to the halle he straught
And there they sat and speak of thyngis
And Jason told him tho tydyngys
Why he was come and fair him prayde
To haste his time and the king said
Jason thou art a worthy knight
But it lies in no man's might
To done that thou art come fore
There has be many a knight forlore
Of that they wolden it assaye
But Jason him would not esmaye
And / said of / every / worlds cure
Fortune stant in adventure
Parauenter well parauenter woo
But hou as ever that it goo
It shall be with mine hond assayed
The king tho held him not well paid
For he the greeks sore dredde
In aunter if Jason ne spedde
He might thereof here a blame
For tho was all the worlds fame
In Greece as for to speak of arms
For thy he drad him of his harms
And began to preche him and to preye
But Jason would not obey
But said he would his purpoos hold
For ought that any man him told
When the king these words herd
And saw how that the knyt ansuerde
Yet for he would make him glad
After Medea gone he had
Which was his daughter and she came
And Jason which good head nam
When he her saw ageyn her goth
And she which was him nothing loath
Welcomed him in to that land
And soft took him by the hand
And down they seten both same
She had herd spoke of his name
And of his great worthynes
For thy she began her eye inpresse
Upon his face and his stature
And thought hou never creature
Was so welfarend as was he
And Jason right in such degree
Nc might not withholde his look
But so good head on her he took
That him ne thout under the heuene
Of beauty saw he never her euene
With all that fell to womanhede
Thus each of other took head
Though there was no word of record
Here hertes both of one acord
Ben set to love but as tho
There myghten be no words mo
The king him made great joye and fest
To al his men he yaf an hest
So as they wol his thank deserve
That they should al Jason serve
While that he would there duelle
And thus the day shortly to tell
With many myrthes is dyspent
Till night was come and tho they went
Echone of other took his leave
When they no longer myghten leave
A not hou Jason that night sleep
But well I wot that of the sheep
For which he came in to that isle
He thought but a little while
Al was medea that be thought
So that m many wise he thought
His wit wakend or it was day
Sometime ye sometime nay
Sometime thus sometime so
As he was styred to and fro
Of love and eke of his conquest
As he was hold of his heste
And thus he roos up by the morrow
And took him saint John to borow
And said he would first begin
At love and after for to win
The flees of gold for which he come
And thus to him good heart he nome
Medea right in the same wise
Till day came that she must rise
Lay and bythought her all the night
Hou she that noble worthy knight
By any weye might wedde
And well she ne wist if he ne spedde
Of thing which he had undertake
She might her self no purpoos take
For if he deyde of his bataylle
She most than algate fail
To geten him when he were deed
Thus she vygan to set read
And torn about her wits al
To look hou it might fall
That she with him bad a leyser
To speak and tell of his desire
And so it fell the same day
That Jason with that sweet may
To gyder set and had space
To speak and he besought her grace
And she his tale goodly herd
And afterward she him ansuerd
And said Jason as thou wylt
Thou myt be sauf thou myt be spilt
For wit well that never man
But if he couthe that I can
Ne might that fortune acheue
For which thou come but as I love
If thou wolt hold covenant
To love of all the remenaunt
I shall thy life and honor save
That thou the flees of gold shall have
He said al at your own will
Madame I shall truly fulfylle
Your hest while my life may last
Thus long he prayed and at last
She grants and hight him this
But when nyt comes and it time is
She would him send certeynly
Such one that should him pryuely
A lone in to her chamber bring
He thanketh her of that tydyng
For of that grace is him begone
Him thinks al other things wo^ne
The day made end and lost his light
And comen was the derk night
The Which all the days eye blent
Jason took leave and forth he went
And when he came out of the prees
He took to cound^^^ Hercules
And told him how it was betyd
And praid him it should well be head
And that he would look about
The whiles that he should be out
Thus as he stood and head name
A maiden fro Medea came
And to Chamber Jason led
Where that he fond ready the led
The fairest and the wysest eke
And she with simple cheer and meke
When she him saw was al ashamed
Then was her tale now entamed
For sykernesse of marriage
She set forth a rich image
The which was the figure of Iubites
And Jason swore and said there
That also wys god should him help
That if Medea did him help
That he his purpoos might win
They should never part a twynne
But ever while him last life
He would her hold for his wife
And with that word they kyssed both
And for they should hem unclothe
There come a maid in her wise
She did hem both full seruyse
Till that they were in fed naked
I wot that night was well a waked
They had loath what they would
And than at loyser she him told
And began fro point to point inform
Of this batuyle and all the form
The which that he / should find there
When he to that ybe come were
She said at the enter of the paas
How More that god of arms was
Has set two oxen stern and stout
That casten fyte and flamme about
(...) al month and at the nas^
So that they syttin al and bbose
What (...) (...) that passes hem between
And fer the^^ore upon the grene
There goth the ^^is of gold to keep
A serpent the which may never sleep
Thus who that should it win The fire to stop he must begin
The which that the fyers beestes cast
And dance he mote hem at the last
So that he may yokke and dryur
And thereupon he must as bylyue
The serpent with such strength assails
That he may slay him in bataile
Of the which he must ye teeth outdraw
As it longs to that law
And than he must the oxen yoke
Til yt they have with a plowe to broke
A forowe of land which of the Iowe
The teeth of the serpent he must so we
And there shall arise knights
Armed well at al ryghtes
Of hem is naught to take heed
For each of hem in hasty head
Shall other slay with dethes wound
And thus when they be leid to ground
And go so forth / and take his pray
Then must he to the gods pray
But and he fail in any wise
Of that he have herd my deuyse
There may be set none other weye
That he ne must algates deye
Now have I told the perille all
And will you tell now forth with all
Quod Medea to Jason tho
That ye shall know er ye goo
Again the venym and the fire
What shall be recouere
But for it is nygh day
Arise up so that I may
Deliver you what thing I have
That may your lif and honor save
They were both loath to rise
But for they were both wise
Up they risen at the last
Jason his clothes on him cast
And made him ready right anon
And she her serke did upon
And cost on her a mantee close
Withouten more and than aroos
Than took she forth a rich tie
Made of gold and of perrye
Out of the which she took a ryng
The stone was worth al other thing
She said whiles he would it were
There might no peril him dear
In water may he not be drenchyd
Where as it comes ye fire is quenchid
It ouercometh also cruel best
There may none aduersite yt man areste
Where so he be on see or land
That has this ring upon his hand
And over that she began seyne
That if a man will not beseyne
Within his hand close the stone
And he may inuysyble gone
This ryng to Jason she ^ytaught
And so forth after she him taught
What sacryfice he should make
And began out of her Cofre take
Him thought a heavenly figure
The which al by charm and by conjure
Was wrought and also was full writ
With names the which he should wit
As she him taught than to read
And bad him as he would speed
Without rest of any while
When he were londed in that isle
He should make his sacryfise
As ^^de his carecte in the wise
And she him taut on knees down bent
Th^e si^hes toward the oryent
For so should he the gods plese
And win him self mochel ese
And when he had thryes radde
To open a box she him ^adde
That she there took him in present
And was full of such oynement
That there was fire ne venym none
That should fasten him vpone
When that he were anointed with a^
For thy she taught him how he shall
Enoyn^e his arines al about
And for he should no thing doubt
She took him than a manner of a glu^
The which was of so huge virtue
That where a m^n it would cast
It should bynd anon so fast
That no man might it do aw^y
And that she bad by all wey
He should in to the mowthes throw
Of these two oxen that fire so blow
Thereof to stop the malice
The glewe shall serve of that se^^yce
And over that her oynement
Her ryng and her enchauntement
Again the serpent should him were
Tille he him slew with sheld and spear
And than he may sau^ly enough
His oxen yoke in his plough
And the teeth sow in such a wise
Till he the knights see arise
And ^chone on other down be laid
In such a manner as I have said
Loo thus Medea for Jason
Ordeyneth and prays thereupon
That he no thing forgete should
And also she prayed him that he would
When he had al his arms done
To the ground knele and thonke anon
The gods and so forth by ese
The flees of gold he should seese
And when he had sesed so
That then he were sone go
Without any taryeng
When this was seid unto weeping
She fell as she yt was thorugh nom^^
With love and so forth ouercomen
That all her world on him she s^^te
But when she saw there was no bette
That he ne must needs part her fro
She took him in her arms two
A honderd times and began him kiss
And said O al my worlds bliss
My tryst / my lust my life my hel^
To be thy help in thy quarele
I pray unto the gods all
And with yt word she began down fall
On swounyng / and he her up name
And forthwith the maiden came
And there to bed anon her brouht
And than Jason her besought
And to her said in this manner
My worthy lusty ladies dear
Comfort you / for by my trou^h^
It shall not fail in my slouthe
That I ne will through out fulfille
Your comau^dement and your own will
An^ yet I hope to you to bring
Within a while such tydyng
The which shall make us both ga^^
But for he would keep her name
When that he wist it was nyhe day
He said adyeu my sweet may
And forth with him he took his ge^^
The which she bad take him there
And straight unto his chamber he went
And gothe to ^ed / and a sleep him hen^
And lay that no man him awoke
For Hercules head of him took
Till it was under of the day and more
And than he ganne to syke sore
And suddenly abrayed of sleep
And than they took of him keep
His chamberleyns ^en soon there
And make ready al his gere
And he awos / and unto the king
He went and said how to that thing
For which he came / he would go
The king therefore was wonder woo
And for he would him fayn withdraw
He told him many a dredeful saw
But Jason would it not record
And at the last they were accord
When that he would not abide
A ^ote was ready at the ^yde
In yt which this worthy knyt of gre^^
Full armed up / at every piece
To his battle that belongs
Took other on hond and sore him longs
Till he the water passid were
And when he came to that y^^ there
He set him on his knee down straul
And his carecte as he was taught
He rad and made his sacryfyce
And sythen anoynced him m^ wys^
As Medea him has ^ede
And than he arose him fro the (...)
And with the glewe the fi^e he qu^ynt
He anon after began ateynt
The great serpent and him slough
But erst he had sorrow enough
For that serpent made him to travail
So hard and sore of his battle
That now he stood / and now he fell
For long time so^ it be fell
That with his swerd ne with his spear
He might not that serpent dear
It was so shelled al about
It spyld al edge tole without
He was so rude and hard of skyn
There might no thing goo there in
Venym and fire to geder he cast
That he ^ason grieved sore with blast
And if it had not ben his oynement
His ring and his enchauntement
The which Medea took him beforn
He had with that worm be lorn
But through ye virtue that thereof ca^
Jason the dragon ouercam
And he anon the tethe out drowe
And set his oxen in a plowe
With the which he brake a piece of ^ond
And sewe hem with his own ^ond
Than might he great merueyle see
Of every tooth in his degree
Spra^g up a knyt with spear and sheld
Of the which right anon (...) the feld
Echone slough other / and with that
Jason not Medea forgot
On both his knees he began down fall
And ga^ thankyng to the gods all
The flees he took and gothe to the boat
The son shyneth bright and hot
The flees of gold shone forth with all
The water glystered oueralle
Medea weped / and syghed often
And stood upon a to wre aloft
Al pryuely within her self
There herd it not ten or twelf
She prayed and said god him speed
The knight that has my maidenhede
And die she looked toward the isle
And when she saw within a while
The flees glisteryng ^geyn the son
She said O lord al is won
My knight the feld has ouereomen
Now would god that he were comen
O lord god I would he were in land
But I dare take this on hand
If that she had wings two
She would have flowen to him tho
Streyte there he was unto the ^ote
The day was clear the son was hot
The greeks were in great doubt
The while that her lord was out
They wise not what should betyde
But waited upon the tide
To see what end should fall
There stood also the nobles all
Footh with the common of the Town
And as they looked up and down
They were ware within a throw
Where as came ye bote / as they well know
And saw how ^ason brought his prey
And than they began al to sey
And ^^yden of with one sreuen
O where was ever under heaven
So noble a knight as Jason is
And well ny^e al saiden this
That Jason was a fair knight
(...)t was never of man's might
The ^^^es of gold so for to win
And thus to talk they begin
(...) that the king forth anon
(...) saw the flees how that shone
And when Jason came to the land
The king him self took his hand
And kyssed him* and greet ioyr made
^he greeks were wonder glade
And of ye thing right merry thought
And forth with him yt flees they brot
And every man began prece in
For well was him that might wyn
To see there of the propyrte
And thus they passen the Cite
And gone unto the place straught
Medea the which forgate her naught
Was ready there and sai^ anon
Welcome O worthy knight Jason
She would have kyst him wonder feign
But shame borned her again
It was not the manner as tho
For thy she durst not do so
She took her leave. and Jason wen^e
In to his chamber / and she him sent
Her maid to see how he ferd
The which when she saw and herd^
How that he had faren out
And that it stood well al about
She told her lady what she wist
And she for joy her maiden kyst
The bathes were than arrayd
With herbs tempred and assayd
And Jason was unarmed soon^
And did as it befelle to done
In to his bathe he went anon
And wysshe him clean as any ^one
He took a soppe / and out he came
And on his best array he name
And kempt his head when he was glad
And goth him forth al merry and glad
Right straight in to the kings hall^
A^pmg the great lords all
And made him glad welcomyng
And he hem told the tythyng
Of this and that how it befelle
When that he wan the shepes fell
Medea when she was after sent
Came soon to that parliament
And when she might Jason see
Was none so glad of al as she
There was no joy for to seche
Of him made every man a speech
Some men said one / sum said other
But though he were gods brother
And might make fire and thonder
There might be no more wonder
Then was of him in that Cyde
Each man taught other this is he
That has in his power within
That all the world might not wyn
Lo here the best of al good
Thus seid they that there stood
And also that walked up and down
Both of the Court and of the town
The time of souper came anon
They wysshen and thereto they gone
Medea was with Jason set
Tho was there many a deynte fet
And set to ^ore hem on the board
But none so lykyng as the word
Which was there spoke among hem two
So^ as they dorst speak tho
But though they ^adden lytyl space
Yet they acorden in that place
How Jason should come at night
When every torche and every light
Were out / and than of other things
They speken a loud for supposynges
Of hem that stoden there about
For love is evermore in doubt
If that it be wisely governed
Of hem that be of love learned
When al was do that dysshe and cup
And clothe and board and ^l was up
They ^ake while hem list to wake
And af^^r that they leave take
And gone to ^edde for to rest
And when him thought for the best
That every man was fast a sleep
Jason that would his time keep
Both forth stalkend al pryuely
Unto the chamber and redyly
There was a maid which him kept
Medea wook and nothing slepte
But netheles she was a bed
And he with all have him spedde
And made him naked and al warm
Anon he took her in his arm
What need is for to speak of ese
Hem list each other for to plese
So that they hadden joy enough
And tho they setten when and hou
That she with him awey shall stele
With words such^ and other feel
When al was treded to an end
Jason took ^eue and began forth wend
Unto his own chamber in pees
There wist it none but Hercules
He slepte and was when it was time
And when it fell toward pryme
He took to ^ym such as he tryste
In secre that none other wyste
And told hem of his counseyl there
And said that his will were
That they to ship had al thing
So pryuelyche in theuenyng
That noman might here deed aspye
But that were of company
For he wol goo without leave
And ^enger wol he naught believe
But he ne would at thylk throw
That king or queen should it know
They said al this shall be do
And Jason trust well thereto
Medea in the mean while
Which thought her fader to begyle
The Tresour which her fader had
With her al pryuely she lad
And with Jason at time set
Awey she stal and fond no let
And straught she goth her in to ship
Of greece with that felaushyp
And they anon drough up the sey^^e
And all that night this was cou^seylle
But erly when the son shone
Men seen hou that they were gon^
And come unto the king and told
And he the soth know would
And axeth where his daughter was
There was no word but out alas
She was a goo / the mother wept
The fader as a wood man lepte
And began the time for to warye
And swore his oath he wol not tarry
That with Calyphe and with galeye
The same course the same wey^
Which Jason took he would take
If that he might him overtake
To this they sayden al ye
Anon they weren at the sea
And al as who said at one word
They gone within ships board
The seylle goth up and forth they straut
But none exployt thereof they caut
And so forth they tornen home ayene
For all that labor was in ^eyn
Jason to greece with his prey
Goth thorugh the sea the right weye
When he there come and men it told
^i^y made joy young and old
Eson when he wise of this
How that his sone comen is
And has acheued that he sought
And home with him medea brought
In all the wide world was none
So glad a man as he was one
To geder ben these lovers tho
Till they had sons two
Whereof they weren both glade
And old Eson greet joy made
To seen the encrees of his lygnage
For (...) was of so great an age
That men away^^n every day
When that he should gone away
Iasen which saw his fader old
^^en medea made him bold
Of art magy^e which she couth
And prayth her that his fader youth
She would make ayeneward new
And she that was toward him true
Behyghte him that she would it do
When that she time saw thereto
But what she deed in that matere
It is a wonder thing to here
But yet for the nouelrye
I ^^ynke tellen a great party
N^t^ qiubus medica mentis Esone^ s^n^^tute decrepitum ad sue iuuentutis
adolescenciam prudens Medea reduxit*

Thus it byfel upon a night
When there was naught but sterre lit
She was banysshed right as her list
That no wight but her seluen it wist
The world was stylle on every side
And that was at mydnyght tide
With open ^xede and foot al bare
Here here to sprad she began to fare
Upon her clothes gyrt she was
Al specheles and on the gras
She glode forth as an adder does
None otherwise she ne goth
Till she came to the fresshe flood
And there a while she withstood
Thryes she turned her about
And thryes eke she began down loute
And in the flood she w^et her here
And thryes on the water there
She gaspeth with a dretchyng onde
And tho she took her speech on hand
First she began to clepe and call
Upward unto the sterres all
To wind to air to see to ^ond
She preyd and held up her hond
To Echates and began to cry
Which is the goddess of Sorcerye
She seyde helps at this need
And as ye maden me to speed
When Jason came the flees to seche
So help me now I you byseche
With that she looks and was ware
Down fro the sky there came a chare
The which / dragons about drough
And tho she began her head down bough
And up she styghe and fair and well
She drofe forth both chare and wheel
Above in the air among the skies
The land of Crete and tho parties
She sought and began fast her high
And thereupon the hulles high
Of Othryn and Olymphe also
And eke of other hulles moo
She fond and gade^eth herbs soute
She pulls up some by the rote
And many with a knyf she shereth
And all in to her chaar she ^ere^^
Thus when she has the hulles sought
The flodes there forya^^ she naught
Erydyan and Amphrydos
^eneye^ and eke Sperceydos
To hem she went and there she nome
Both of the water and of the f^m^
She fond and eke the small stones
Which al she chese out for the nones
And of the read see a part
That was behouelycke to her art
She took / and afterward about
She sought sundry seeds out
In feldes and in many greues
And eke a part she took of leaves
But thing which myt her most aua^yle /
She fond in Crete and in thessayle
In days and in nyghtes nine
With great trauayl and great pyne
She was purueyed of every piece
And turned homward in to greece
Before the gates of Eson
Her chare she let awey to gone
And took out first that was therein
For tho she thought to begin
Such thing as seems impossyble
And made her self inuysyble
As she that was with a pre enclosed
And might of no man be dysclosed
She took of turues of the land
Without helpe^ of man's hand
And heled with the grene gras
Of which an Altar made there was
Unto Echates the Goddess
Of art magyke and sorceresse
And eft another to iuuente
As she which did here hole entente
Tho took she felwood and berueyne
Of herbs be not better tweyne
Of which anon without ^^ett
These aulters ben about set
Two sundry pyttes fast by
She made / and with that hastily
A wether which was blak she ^^ou
And out thereof she the blood drough
And did in to the pyttes two
Warm mylk she put also thereto
With honey meynt, and in such wise
She began to make her sacryfyce
And cryde and prayde forth with all
To pluto the god infernal
And to the queen proserpyne
And so she sought out the line
Of hem that longen to that craft
Behynd was noman laft
And praid hem all as she was couth
To grant Eson his first youth
This old Eson brought forth was tho
A wey she bad al other goo
Upon peril that might fall
And with that word they wenten all
And leften there them two alone
And tho she began to gasp and gone
And made signs many one
And said her words therupone
So that with spellyng and her charms
She took Eson in both her arms
And made him for to sleep fast
And him upon her herbs cast
The blak wether tho she took
And hew the flesh as does a Cook
On either altar part she leyde
And with the charms that she seyde
A fire down from the sky alyght
And made it for to brenne light
And when Medea saw it brenne
Anon she began to sterte and run
The fyry aulters al about
There was no best which goth out
More wild than she seems there
About her sholders henge her here
As though she were out of her mind
And turned in to another kind
Tho lay there certain wode clefte
Of which the pieces now and efte
She made hem in the pyttes wete
And put hem in the fyry hete
And took the brond with all the blase
And thryes she bygan to raze
About Eson there as he slepte
And efte with water which she kept
She made a cercle about him thryes
And eke with fire of sulphyr twyes
Full many another thing she deed
Which is not written in the stead
But she can up so and down
She made a wonder soune
Sometime lyche unto the cok
Sometime unto the lauerok
Sometime cacleth as an hen
Sometime speaks as done men
And right so as her ^argon strau^geth
In sundry wise hyl form changes
She seems fair and no woman
Forth with the craft that she can
She was as who seith a goddess
And what her list more or less
She did in books as we find
That passes over man's kind
But who that wol wondres here
What thing she wrout in this matere
To make an end of that she began
Such marvel herd never man
A poynted in the new moan
When it was time for to done
She set ^ cauldron on the fire
In which was all the hoole attire
Where on the medycyne stood
Of Iuse of water and of blood
And let it boil in such a plyte
Till that she saw the spume white
And tho she cast in rynde and root
And seed and flower that was for bote
With many an herb and many a stone
Whereof she has there many one
And eke the Cympheyus the serpent
To her has al her scales lent
^he ^ydre her yafe his adders skyn
And she to boil cast hem in
And part eke of the horned oule
The which men here on nyghtes houle
And of a Raven which was told
Of nine honderd winter old
She took the heed with all the bylle
And as the medy^yue it will
She took thereafter the bowele
Of the sea wolf and for the hele
Of Eson with a thousand mo
Of thyngis that she had tho
In that caldron to gyder as blyue
She put and took than of olyue
A dry branch hem with to ster^
The which anon began flower and bear
And weye al fresshe and grene ageyn
When she this virtue herd f^yn
She let the lest drope of all
Upon the bare flore down fall
Where as the drop fall was
Anon there spronge flower and gras
And way anon al mede we grene
So that it might well be seen
Medea than knew and wist
Her medycyne is for to tryse
And goth to Eson there he lay
And took a swerd was of assay
With which a wound upon his side
She made that there out may slide
The blood within which was old
And seek and trouble feeble and coldr
And tho she took unto his use
Of herbs all the best Iuse
And poured it in to his wound
That made his beynes full and sound
And tho she made his wounds close
And took his hond up he wse
And tho she yafe him drynk a draut
Of which his youth again be caught
His heed his heart and his bysage
Lyche unto twenty winter age
And lyche unto the fresshe may
His hoar here is were away
When passed ben the cold shoures
Right so recouereth he his flowers
Loo what might any man deuyse
A woman show in any wise
More hertely love in any stead
Than medea to Jason deed
First she made him the flees to win
And from all her kyth and kyn
With great tresour with him she stal
And to his fader forth with all
His elde has turned in to youth
Which thing none other man couth
But hou it was to her a^uyt
The remembrance duelleth yet
King Peleus his eme was deed
Jason bare coroune on his beede
Medea has fulfilled his will
But when he should of right fulfylle
The truth which to her before
He had in the ^le of Colchos swore
Tho was medea most deceived
For he has another received
Whtch^ daughter was to king Creon
Creusa she byght, and thus Jason
As he that was to love untrue
Medea left and took a new
But that was afterward sore abought
Medea with her art has wrought
Of cloth of gold a mantel rich
Which seems worth a kings rich
And that was unto Creusa sent
In name of yeft and of present
For susterhood was hem between
And when the young fresshe queen
That mantyl lappyd her about
A none thereof the fire sprang out
And brent her both flesh and bone
Tho came Medea to Jason
With both his sons on here hond
And said O thou of every land
The most vntre we creature
Loo this shall be thy forfeture
With that she both his sons slough
Before his eye and he out drough
His swerd and would have slain her tho
But fare well she was a goo
Unto Pallas the court above
Where as she pleyneth upon love
As she that was with that goddess
And he was left in great dystresse
Thus myt thou see what sorrow it does
To swear an oath which is not soth
In loves cause namely
My sone be well ware for thy
And keep that thou be not forswore
For this which I have told tofore
Ouyde tells every dele
My fader I may leave it well
For I have herd it often seye
Hou Jason took the flees aweye
Fro Colchos for yet herd I naught
By whom it was first thither brout
And for it were good to here
If that thou list at my prayere
To tell I would you byseche
My sone who that wol it seche
In books he may find it write
And netheles if thou wolt wit
In the manner as thou have preyde
I shall the tell hou it is seyde
Nota qualiter aureum vellus in pardes Insule Colchos primo deuenit Athemas Rex
philen habiut coniugem (...) qua Faxum genuit et Hellen / Mortua autem Hellen
Athemas Iunonem Regis Cadmi filiam postea (...) vxorem dnxit / que more Nouerce
di^tos infa^tes in tantum recollegit odi^ que ambos in mari proici penes Regem
procurauit / Vnde Juno compaciens quemdam Arietem grandem aureo vestitum

quo facto Aries super vndas regressus cum solo Frixo sibi adherente in Colchos
applicuit / vbi Juno dictum Arietem cu^suo vellere prout in alijs canitur
^coni^is sub a^ta custodia collocauit

tHe fame of thylk shepes fell
Which in Colchos as it bifelle
was al of gold shall never deye
Whereof I think for to seye
Hou he came first in to that I Will
There was a king in thylk while
To wards greece and Athemas
The Cronyke of his name was
And had a wife which Phylen hight
By whom so as fortune it dyght
He had of children young two
Fay^s the first was of tho
A man child right fair with all
A daughter eke which men call
Hellen he hade by this wife
But for there may no man's life
Endure upon this earth here
This worthy queen as thou myt here
Er that the children were of age
Took of her end the passage
With great worship and was bygraue
What thing it lyketh god to have
It is great reason to ben his
For thy this king so as it is
With great suffrau^ce it vnderfongeth
And afterward as him belongs
When it was time for to wedde
A new wife he took to bed
Which Iuo hight and was a maid
And eke the daughter as men said
Of Cadme which a king also
Was hold in thylke days tho
When Iuo was the kings make
She cast hou that she might make
These chyldre to her fadre loath
And shope a wyle ayene hem both
Which unto the king was at unknow
A year or two she sete do sow
The land with soden whete about
Whereof no corn may spryngen out
And thus by sleyghte and by couyne
Aroos the derthe and the famyne
Thorugh out the land in such a wise
So that the king a sacryfyce
Upon the point of this dyserrsse
To Ceres which is the goddess
Of corn has shape him for to give
To look if it may be foryeue
The meschyef which was in his land
But she which knew to fore the hond
The cyraimstaunce of al this thing
Ageyn the coming of the king
In to the Temple has shape so
Of her acord that al tho
Which of the Temple prestes were
Have said and full declared there
Unto the king but if so be
That he desyuer the country
Of Fryxus and of hellen both
With whom the gods ben so wroth
That while tho chyldre ben within
Such tylthe shall no man begin
Whereof to get him any corn
Thus was it said thus was it sworn
Of all the prestes that there are
And she which causes all this fare
Said eke thereto what that she would
And every man than after told
So as the queen had hem preyd
The king which bath his ere leyd
And leueth all that ever he herd
Unto here tale thus ansuerde
And seyth that lever is him to chese
His children both for to lose
Than him and all the remenaunt
Of hem which are apperdendunt
Unto the land which he shall keep
And bade his wife to take keep
In What manner is best to done
That they delyuerd were sone
Out of the world and she anon
Two men ordeyneth for to gone
But first she made hem for to swear
That they the children should here
Unto the sea that none it know
And hem therein both throw
The children to the sea ben lad
Where in the wise as Yuo bad
These men be ready for to do
But the goddess which Juno
Is hot / appears in the stead
And has unto the men forbede
That they the children not ne slay*
But bad hem look in to the sea
And taken head of that they syghen
There swam a sheep to fore her eyes
Whoos flees of burned gold was al
And this goddess forth with all
Comaundeth that without let
They should anon the chyldre set
Above upon the shepes bak
And al was do right as she spak
Whereof the men gone home again
And fell so as the books seyne
Hellen the young maiden tho
Which of the sea was woe bego
For pure dread her heart has lore
That fro the sheep which has her bore
As she that was swounend feynt
And fell and her self deeynt
Frixus and this sheep forth swam
Till he to the I Will of Colchos came
Where Juno the goddess he fond
Which took the sheep to the land
And s^tte it there in such a wise
As thou to fere have herd deuyse
Whereof cam^after all the woe
Why Jason was forswore so
Unto mede^ as it is spoke
My fader who that has to broke
His troth as ye have here told about
He is not worthy for to love
Ne be beloved as me seems
But every love ne we quemeth
To him which new fangle is
And netheles now after this
If that thou list to taken head
Upon my shryfte to proceed
In loves cause ayene the vice
Of couetyse and Auoryce
What there is more I would wit
My sone this find I write
There is yet one of thylk brood
Which only for the worlds good
To make a Tresoure of money
Put al conscience a weye
Whereof in thy Confession
The name and the condycyon
I shall here afterward declare
Which makes one rich another bare
Plus capit vsura sibi quam debetur et illud / Fraud colocata sepe latenter
agit / Sic amoz excessus quam sepe suos vt cuarus / Spirat et viuus tres capit
ipse loco

Hic tractat de illa specie Auaricie que vsura dicitur / cuius creditor in
pecunia tantum numerata plus quam sibi de iure debetur incrementum lucri ad
auget

Upon the benche syttend on hy
With auaryce usure I syghe
Full clothed of his own suit
Which after good makes chase and suit
With his brocours that run about
Lyche unto ratches on a route
Such lucre is none above ground
Which is not of the ratches found
For where they see beyete sterte
That shall hem in no wise asterde
But they it drive in to the net
Of lucre which usure has set
Usure with the rich duelleth
To all that ever he byeth and sells
He has ordained of his sleyghte
Mesure^ double and double weyghte
Outward he sells by the less
And with the more he makes his tasse
Whereof his house is full withynne
He retcheth naught be so he win
Though that he lose ten or twelve
His love is al toward him selue
And to none other but he see
That he may win such three
For where he shall ought give or lene
He wol ayene ward take a been
There he has lent the small pese
And right so there be many of these
Lovers that though they* love a lyte
That scarsely would it weye a myte
Yet would they have a pound again
And does usure in his bargeyn
But certes such usure vnlyche
It falls more unto the rich
Als well of love as of beyete
Than unto hem that be not great
And as who says be simple and pouer
For seldom is when they recover
But if it be thorugh greet deserte
And netheles men see pouerte
With pursuit and contenaunce
Full often make a great cheuaunce
And take of love his advantage
For with the help of his brocage
That maken seem where it is naught
And thus full often is love bought
For little what and mochel take
With falls weyghtes that they make
Now sone of that I said above
Thou wost what usure is of love
Tell me for thy what so thou wylt
If thou thereof host any gylt
My fader nay for ought I here
For of tho points ye tolden here
I wol you by my troth assure
My weyghte of love and my mesure
Has be more large and more certain
Than ever I took of love again
For so yet couthe I never of sleyghte
To take again by double weyghte
Of love more than I have give
For also wys mote I be shryue
And have remyssyon of sin
And so yet couthe I never win
Ne yet so mochel soth to seyn
That ever I might have half ageyn
Of so full love as I have lent
And mine hop were so well went
That for the hoole I might have half
My thinks I were a goddess half
For where usure would have double
My conscience is not trouble
I bid never as to my dele
But of the hole an haluen dele
That is none excess as me thinks
But netheles it me forthynketh
For well I wot that wol not be
For every day the better I see
That ho^ so ever I give or lene
My love in place there I mean
For ought that ever I axe or crave
I can nothing ayeneward have
But for that I wol not let
What so befalle of my beyete
That I ne shall give and lene
My love and al my thought so clean
That toward me shall nougt believe
And if she of her good leave
Reward me would naught ageyn
I wot the last of my bargeyn
Shall stand upon so great a lost
That I may never more the cost
Recover in this world till I dye
So that touchend of this party
I may me well excuse and shall
And for to speak forth with all
If ouy brocour for me went
That point came never in mine intent
So that the more me meruayleth
What thing it is my lady eyleth
That al mine heart and al my time
She has / and do no better byme
I have herd said that thout is fre
And netheles in pryuete
To you my fader that been here
Mine hole shryfte for to here
I dar mine heart well dysclose
Touchend usure as I suppose
Which as ye tellen in love is used
My lady may not ben excused
That for one lokyng of her eye
Mine hool heart has till I deye
With all that ever I may and can
She has me won to her man
Whereof me thinks good reason would
That she somdele reward should
And give a part there she has al
I not what fall herafter shall
But in to now yet dare I seyne
Her list never give again
A good word in such a wise
Whereof mine hope might arise
My greet love to compense
I not hou she her conscience
Excuse wol of this usure
By large weyghte and great mesure
She has my love and I have naught
Of that which I have dear abought
And with mine heart I have it paid
But all this is aside laid
But I go loueles about
Her ought stand in right great doubt
Till she redress such a sin
That she wol al my love win
And yeueth me not to live by
Naught also much as grant mercy
Her list to seye of which I might
Some of my greet pain alyght
But of this point lo thus I fare
As he that pays for his Chaffare
And byeth it dear and yet has none
So mote he needs pouer gone
Thus bye I dear and have no love
That I ne may come above
To win of love none encrece
But I me will never the lose
Touchend usure of love acquyte
And if my lady be to wit
I pray to god such grace her send
That she my time it must amend
My sone of that thou have answered
Touchend usure / I have al herd
How thou of love have wonnen small
But that thou tellest in thy tale
And thy lady thereof accusist
Me thinks thy words thou mysusist
For by thine own knowlechyng
Thou say that she for one lokyng
Thy hole heart fro the she took
She may be such that her one look
Is worth the heart many fold
And than have thou thy heart well sold
When thou have that is more worthy
And also that thou tellest for thy
How that her weight of love uneven
May to thy semyng under heaven
Stand ever even in that balaunce
The which stondeth in loves gouerna^ce
Such is the statute of this law
That though thy love more draw
And peyse in the balaunce more
Thou may not ask ageyn there fore
Of doubt / but all of grace
For love is lord in every place
There may no law him Iustyfye
By ^eddour ne by company
That he ne will after his will
Whom that him likes to speed or spille
To love a man may well begin
But whether he shall lose or win
That wot no man till at the last
And therefore coueyte not to fast
My sone / but abide thyn end
Per c^as al may to good wend
But that thou have me told and said
Of one thing I am right well paid
That thou by sleyghte ne by gyle
Of no brocoure have other while
Engyned love for such deed
Is more venged as I read
Hic ponit exemplum contra istos marituss * qui vltra id quod proprias habent
vxores / ad noue voluptatis in crementum. alias mulieres superflue lu crari non
verentur / Et narrat qualiter Juno vindictam in Ecco lucris adquirendis de
consilio mariti Iouis me diatrix exstiterat

bRokers of love that deceyuen
No wonder though they receyuen
After the wrong that they deserve
For sometime they goo and serve
And do plesaunce for a while
Yet at the last her own gyle
Upon her own head descends
The which god of his vengeance se^deth
As by ensample of time a goo
A man may find / it has be so
It fell sometime as it was seen
The high gods and the queen
Juno than had in company
A maiden full of treachery
For she was ever in one acord
With Iubiter that was her lord
To get him other loves new
Thorugh such brocage / and was untrue
Al other wise than him needs
But she the which no shame dredeth
With queynt words and with slye
Blinded in such a wise her ladies eye
As she to whom Juno tryst
So that there of she no thing wist
But so pryuely may be no thing
That it ne comes to knowlechyng
For thing yt is done on the derk nyt
Is after known when the day is lit
So it befelle at the last
All that this slyghe maiden cast
Was over cast and overthrown
For as the soothe must be known
To Juno it was done understand
In what manner her husbonde
With falls brocage has taken usure
Of love more than his mesure
When he took other than his wife
Whereof this maiden was gyltyf
The which has been of his ass^^t
And thus was all the game shent
She suffered him as she must need
But the broucore of his mysdede
She that her counceylle gaf thereto
On her is the vengeance do
For Juno with her words bryg^t
This maiden whic^e Tito hight
Reproves and says in this wise
O traitresse of suc^e seruyse
Have thou thine own lady ser^ed
Thou have great pain well deserved
Thy slygh words for to peynte
With flaterye that is so queynt
Toward me that am thy queen
Where thorugh thou made me to went
That my housbond true were
When that he loves else where
Al be it so / him needs n^ught
But upon the it shall be bought
The which art pryue to these doings
And me full often of thy besynges
Deceived have now is the day
That I the while well quyte. may
And for thou have to me counceyled
That my lord has with other deled
I shall the set in such a kind
That ever unto the worlds end
All that thou herest / thou shall tell
And clappe it out as does a belle
And with that word she was for shape
There may no vice her mouth escape
What man that in the world cries
Withouten fail Hecco replyeth
And what word that him lust to say^
The same word she says again
Thus she that sometime had leave
To be at large / is now morrow and eve
In woods and on hills both
For such brocage is wives loathe
The which does lords heart and change
And love in other places strange
For thy / if ever it so befalle
That thou herafter in chamber or hall^
Me wedded man hold that thou have
For thy al other love is wast
One wife shall well to the suffys^
And that if tho^ for couetyse
Of love would ask more
Thou sholdest done again the lod^
Of all men that true be
My fader as in this degree
My conscience is not accused
For I no such brocage have used
Where thorugh yt love of lust is wo^n^
For thy speaks forth / as ye begone
Of auaryce upon my shryft
My son I shall the branches s^yft
By order as they ben set
Of whom no good is well beset
Pars verbis verba munus pro munere reddi / Conuenit vt pondus ^qu^ statera
ger^t / Preterea cupido non da^ sua dona cupido / Nam qui nulla ^eri^ gramina
nulla metet

Hic tractat Auctor super illa specie Auaricie que parcimonia dicitur. cuius
natura tenax aliqualem sue substancie porcionem / aut deo aut hominibus par
ticipare nullatenus consentit

Blind ^uaryce of his ly^nage
For counceylle / and for co^^nage
To withhold again largess
H^th one the whose name is scarceness^
The which is kepat of his how
And is so thorugh auarous
That he no good will let out of hond
Though god him self should fond
Of gift should he no thing have
And if a man it would crave
He must than fail at need
Whereof him self may not speed
And thus scarcenes in every place
By reason may no thing purcha^^
And (...) in his ^egre
Above al other most priu^
With Aua^y^^ he stondeth se
That he is evermore in woe
In his estate of his office
After the rewle of that vice
He takes his lepis he hoppeth he blent
That light is to slay the flent
That gede of him ne hard ne nesshe
Only the valewe of a Resshe
Of good in helpyng of another
Ne though be were his own brother
And in the ^^as of gift and love
S^^ndeth every man for him above
Thinks of his vnkyndeship
That him needs no felauship
So that the bag and he acorde
Him rekketh not what man record
Of him were it evil or good
For all his trust is on his good
And so allone he falls often
When he best weneth to stond on lofd^
As well in love as other wise
For love is ever of sum repryse
To him that wol his lone hold
For thy my sone as thou art hold
Tonchend of this tell me thy shry^^
Have thou be searse of large gift
Unto thy love to whom thou serues^
For after that thou well deseruest
Of gift thou might be the bett^
F^^ that good I will be set
For yt which thou myt you better fa^^
Then is no wysedom for to spare
For thus men seyn in every need
He was wise that first made mede
For where as mede may not speed
I not what helps other deed
Full of^ he fails of his game
That will with ydel hond reclame
His hawke / as many a nyce man does
For thy my sone tell the sooth
And say the t^outhe / if thou have be
^on^^ thy ^^ue scorse o^ fro
My fader it has sto^den thus
That if the ^^^ou^ of ^resus
With all the goood of Oc^auian
And the riches of Indyan
Of perles and of rich stones
Were al to geder mine at ones
I set it at no manner acounte
Than would bare sted amounde
To give it her al on a day
So that to that sweet may
It might like more or less
And thus the cause of my largess
Ye may understand and leave
That I shall not the better acheue
The purpoos which is in my thought
But if that I gaf her never naught
Ne thereto durst a profre make
For well I wot she will not take
And give will she not also
She is escheweng of both two
And thus I trow be the skylle
Toward me* for she ne will
That cause I have of hope
Naught as much as a drope
But toward other / as I may see
She gives and takes in such degree
That as by the wey of frendelyhede
She can so keep her womanhede
That every man speaks of her well
But she will take of me no dele
And yet she wot well that I would
Give and do both what I should
To pl^se her in all my might
By reason this wot every wight
For that may by no wey asterte
There she is master of the hert^
She must be master of the good
For god wot well / that al my mode
And al my good whiles I have out
And al my heart and al my thought
As freely as god has it me give
It shall be hirs whiles I live
Right as her list her selue comma^de
So that it needs no demand
To ask of me if I have be scarce
To love / for I to that parse
Will answer and sey no
My sone that is right well do
For of time (...) ^^^rcenesse
It has been seen that fore the less
Is lost the more as thou shall ^e^e
A tale like to this matere
Hic loquitur contra istos qui auaricia stricti largitans beneficium in amo ris
causa confundunt / Et ponit exemplum qua^^cer Croseus largu^ et hilaris
babionem auarum et tenacione de amore viole qui pulcherrima fuit / dono
largissimus circumuenit

^ Carcenes and love acord never
ffor every thing is well yt leue^
When yt a man has bout it dear
And for to speak in this matere
For sparyng of a little cost
Full oftyme a man is lost
The large cote for the hode
What man that scarce is of his good
And will not give he shall not take
With gift a man may vndertak^
The high god to plese and queme
With gift a man the world may deem
For every creature y bore
If thou give him is glad therefore
And every gladship as I fynd^
Is comfort unto loves kind
And causes of man to sped^
So was he wise that first gaf me^^
For mede keeps love in hows
But when the men ben couetou^
And space to give a part
They know not of Cupides a^^^
For his fortune and his apryse
Deceyueth al couetyse
And hates al negardry
And for to look on this party^
A sooth ensample that it is s^^
I find written of Babeo
That had a love of his menage
There was no fayter of her age
And hight vyota by name
The which full of youth and of game
Was of her seft large and fre
But such another Chynche as ^e
Men wise not m all the land
And had afaited to his hand
His servant which Spodius
Was called / and in this wise thus
The worlds good of suffysaunce
Was had but lykyng and plesaun^^
Of that that longs to Ryc^esse
Of love stood in great dystresse
So that this young lusty wight
Of the thing that fell to lou^s right
Was ever served ouerall
That she was so begone with all
Till that Cupyde and ^oenus e^^e
A medicine for to seek
Ordeyne would in this c^^s
Right as fortune than was
Of love vp^on the d^stene
It fell right as it should b^
A fresshe a fre lusty man
That naught of auary^^ can
The which crocius by name hight
And was lyberall al out right
And there as she was he came in presence
She saw him large of his dispense
And amerous and glad of there
So that her lyked well to here
The goodly words that he said
And thereupon of love he prayed
It was of love all that he m^nt
And for that she should to love ass^^^
He gaf her gifts ever among
But for men seyen that mede is strong
Hit was well seen that same tide
For as it should of right ^etyde
This vpol^ largess bath take
And the negard she did forsake
Of bic^^us she will no more
For he was gratchyng and ever more
There was with him none other fare
But for to pynche and for to spare
Of worlds mukke to get encrees
So goth the wretch loueles
Beiaped for his scarcyte
And he that large was and free
And set his heart to dispend
This Crocius his to we has bend
The which Venus took him for to hold
And shot as often as he would
Loo thus departs love his al we
That what man wol not be felawe
To give and spend as I the tell
He is not worthy for to dwell
In loves Court to be releued
For thy my sone if I be leued
Thou shall be large of thy dispense
My fader in my conscience
If there be any thing amys
I will amend it after this
Toward my love namely
My sone well and redyly
Thou say so yt well paid with all
I am / and ferthermore I shall
Unto thy shryft specyfye
Of auary^^ the progenye
That vice sueth after this
Thou shall have wonder how hit i^
Among the folk in many Regne
That such a vice might regne
That is comune to all assayes
As men may find now a days
Cuncta creatum deus / et qui cuncta c^^ ^uit / Dampnant ingrati dicta quam
facto viu / Non dolor a long stat quo si^i t^^is ami^am / Traxit et in fine
deserit esse suam

Hic ^^quitur super illa aborta specie auaricie que ingratitudo dicta es^cuius
co^dicioni non ^^lum creator / sed it cuncte creature abhominabilem detestantur

tHe vice like unto the fend
That never yet was ma^s friend
And cleped is vnkyndeship
Of Couyne and of felauship
With auaryce he is witholde
And thinks that he should be bold
Unto the mother that him bare
Of him may never man be^^ are
He wol not have the merit
For that he would not acquyte
That in this world is much used
And few ben there excused
To tell of him is endeles
And thus I say nevertheless
Where as this vice comes to sonde
There takes no man his tho^ke o^^ ho^de
Though he with all his myghtes serve
He shall of hem no thing deserve
He takes what any man may give
But while he has one day to live
He will nothing reward ag^yne
He grutcheth to give again
Where he has a berne fulle
That makes a kind heart dulle
To sey his trust in such friendship
There as he fyndeth no kyndeship
And for to speak words pleyne
Thus here I many a man complain
That now on days thou shall find
At need few friends kind
In what thou have done for hem before
It is forgeten as it were lore
The books speken of this vice
And tellen how that god of his Justice
By wey of kind and also of nature
And every living creature
And the law also who that it can
They dampne an unkind man
Ars et natura Cristus sit omnia iura Dampna^t ingratum lamentantur fore natum

Hit is all one to s^y unkind
A^ ^hynge that done is again kind
For it with kind never stood
A man to yield euylle for good
For he that would take heed
A best is glad of a goood deed
And loves that creature
After the law of his nature
The which does him ese and for to se^
Of this matter auctoryte
Full oftyme it has befalle
W^^rof a tale among us all
The which of old ^^samplary^
I think it for to specyfye
Hic narrat quod bestie in suis benefi^ns hominem ingratum naturaliter

tO speak of an unkind man
I find how sometime Adryan
Of rome that a great lord was
upon a day as he per ^as
To the wood in his huntyng went
It happeth at a sodeyne went
After the chase as he pursues
Thorugh hap that no man escheweth
He fell unware in to a pyt
Where as it might not be let
The pytte was deep and he fell low
That of his men none might know
Where he bicame / for none was so nygh
That of his fall the meschyef syghe
And thus alone there he lay
Clepend and cryend all the day
For secoure and delyueraunce
Til again eve it fell per chance
A whylo or it bicam to night
A pour man that Bardus hight
Come forth walkend with his Ass
And had gadred him a tasse
Of grene stykkes and of dry*
To selle whom that would hem bey^
As he that had no lyuelode
But when he might such a loode
To town with his asshe carye
And as it fell him for to tarry
That same time nyhe the pytte
And had his trusse fast knyt^^
And herd a voice that cried dymme
And he his ere to the brymme
Has leyd and herd it was a man
That seid O help Adryan
And I will give al my good
The pour man this understood
As he that would gladly wyn
And to this lord that was within
He spak and said if I the save
What sikernes shall I have
Of covenant that afterward
Thou wilt me give such reward
As thou behyghtest now beforne
That other has his oath sworn
By heaven and by gods all
If that it might so bifalle
That he him out of the pytt brought
Of all the goods that he ought
He shall have even haluendele
This bardus seid he would well
And with this word his ass anon^
He did untruss and thereupon
Down goth the co^d in to the pyt
To the which he has an end knyt
A staf whereby he said he would
That Adryan him should hold
But it was then per ^as fallen
In to that pytte was so fallen
An ape the which at that throw
When that the rope down came low
And suddenly thereto he skypte
And it in both his arms clypte
And bardus with his ass anon
Him has vpdrawen and is gone
But when he saw it was an ape
He wend all had been ^ iape
Of fayry and sore him dradde
And Adryan eftsoon gradd^
For help and cried fast
And he eftsoon his cord cast
But when it come unto the ground
A great serpent it has bewound^
The which bardus anon up drough
And than him thought well enough
Hit was but fanton b^t yet he herd
The voice and thereto he answered
What art thou in gods name
I am quod Adryan the same
The which good thou shall have even
half / Od bardus than a gods half
The third time assay I shall
And cast his cord forth with all
In to the pytte / and when it came
To him this lord of Rome it nam^
And thereupon him has dressid
And with his hond full often blessi^
And than he bad Bardus hale
And he that understood his tale
Bitwene him and his Ass al soft
Has drawn and set him up a lofte
Without^ harm all esyly
And he said not ones grant mercy
But forth him went to the Cite
And let this pour bardu^ be
And nevertheless this simple m^^^
His covenant so as he ca^
Has asked and ye other answered and said
That if so were yt he him up braide
Of ought that has be spoken or done
It shall he wroken on him soon
That him were better to be deed
And he can none other read
But on his ass again he cast
His trusse and hyed him homeward fast
And when that he came home to bed
He told his wife how he spedde
But finally to speak ought more
unto this lord dradde him sore
So that one word he durst not sey^
And so upon the morrow again
In the manner as I record
Forth with his ass and with his cord
To gader wood as he did er
He goth / and when he comes there
unto the place where that he would
He began his ape anon behold
The which had gadred al about
Of stykkes here and there a rowte
And leyd hem ready to his hond
Whereof he made his t^isse and bond
Fro day do day. and in this wise
Thus proffered he his seruyse
So that he had of wood enough
And upon a time as he drough
Toward the wood he saw beside
The great ghastly serpent glyde
Til that she came to his presence
And in her kind a reverence
She has him done and forth with all
A stone more bright than a Castalle
Out of her mouth in his way
She let down fall and went her way
For that he should not be adrad
Then was this pour bardus glad
Than^^end god and to the stone
He goes and takes it up anon
And has great wonder in his wit
How that the beast him has quytte
Where that the man has failed
For whom he had most trauayled
But all he put in gods hand
And torn^d home and what he fond
unto his wife he has it shewde
And they that were both lewd^
A^^^den that he should it selle
And he no l^nger would dwell
But forth anon upon the tale
The stone he profereth to the sale
And right as him self he set
The ^^wler anon him fette
The gold and made his payement
Thereof was none delayement
Thus when this stone was bot and sold
Homeward with joy many fold
This bardus goth. and when he came
Home to his hows and that he nam^
His gold out of his purse within
He fond also his stone therein
Wherefore for joy his heart played
And to his wife thus he said
^^^ here my gold / loo here my ston^
His wife had wonder thereupon
And asked him how it might be
Now by my truth quod he
But I dare swear upon a book
That to my merchant I it took
And he it had when I went
So know I not to what intent
It is now here but through gods grace
For thy to morrow in other place
^ will assay it for to selle
And if it wol not with him dwell
But ^^pe in to my purse again
Than dare I sauely swear and seyn^
^t is the virtue of the stone
The morrow came / and he is gone
To (...) about in other stead
His stone to selle and so he deed
And left it with his chapman the^
But when that he came e^s where
In presence of his wife at home
Out of his p^rs anon he nome
His gold and fond his stone with a^
And thus it fell him o^^^ral
Where he it sold in diverse place
Such was the fortune and the grace
But so well may no thing b^ hyd
That it ne is at the last kyd
This fame goth about Rome
^o ferforth that the words come
To the Emperor Iustynyan
And he let send for that man
And asked him how that it was
And bardus told him all the ^s
How that the serpent and eke the bes^
Al though they made none biheste
His trauaylle had well quyt
But he that had a man's wit
And made his covenant by mouth
And swore thereto all that he couthe
To part and give halue his good
Has now forgeten how that it stood
As he that would no truth hold
This Emperor all that he told
Has herd and that unkindness
He seid he would him self redress^
And thus in Court of Judgment
This Adryan was after sent
And the quarrel in a^dyence
Declared was in his presence
Of the Emperor and many moo
Whereof was much speech tho
And great wo^dryng among the p^^s^
But at the last neuerthelese
For the party which has pleyned
The law has demed and ordained
By hem that were auysed webe
That he shall have the haluendel^
Thorugh out of Adryans good
And thus of that unkind blood
Stondeth the memory unto this day
Where thorugh yt every wise man may
Ensamplyn him and took in mind
What shame it is to be unkind
Again the which reason debateth
And every creature it hates
For thy my sone in thy office
I read thou flee that ylke vice
For right a^ the Cronycle s^y^^
How Adryan he his feyth
Forgate for worlds cou^fys^
Full often in such a manner wys^
Of lovers now a man may see
Full many that unkind ^^
For well to promise and evil to las^
That is here life for at the last
When that they have her ^^ylle done
Her love is gone after soon
What say thou soon to this ^as
My fader I wol say allas
That ever was such a man borne
That ^hen he has his truth sworn^
And has of love what he would
That he any time should
Ever in his berde after fynd^
To be falls or to be unkind
But fader as touchend of me
I may not stand in that degree
For I took never of love why
That I ^e may goo thereby
And do my profi^e else where
For any speed I find there
I may well thynk al about^
But I dare not speak it ou^^
And if I durst I would pleyn^
That she for whom I suffer peyn^
And love ever her y lyche hot^
That another gift another byhote
In rewardyng of my service
Hit list her in no manner wise
I will not sey that she is kind
And for to seye that she is unkind
That dare I not but god above
The which demeth e^^ry heart of love
He wot that on mine own side
Shall not unkindness abide
If that I shall with my lady dwell^
Thereof dare I no more tell
Now good fader as it is
Tell me what ye thenke of this
My sone of that vnkyndeship
The which toward thy ladyship
Thou pleynest for she will the naught
Thou art to blame in that thought
For it may be that thy desire
Though it brenne ever as does the fir^
^^r ^as to her honor mysset
Or else time comes not yet
The which stondeth upon thy destyne
For thy my sone I read the
Think well what ever the bifalle
For no man has his lusts all
But as thou toldest me biforne
That thou to love art not forsworn
And have do no vnkyndenysse
Thou might thereof thy grace bliss
And leave not for thy contenannce
Forther may be no such g^^uaunce
To love as it is vnkyndeship
Wherefore to keep thy worship
So as the old books tale
I shall the tell a ^^dy tale
Now her^en and be well ware thereby
For I will (...) it openly
Hic ponit exemplum contra istos ^i ^os amo^ ingratoe. Et narrat qualiter
Theseus cadani filius consilio suffultus Adriane Regis Mynos filie in domo quoth
^a^orinthus dicitur Minotaurum vincit / vnde Theseus Adriane sponsalia
certissime p^omittens ipsam vna cum fedra sorore sua a Creta secum nauigio
duxit / S^d statim postea oblito gratitudinis beneficio Adrianam ipsum
saluantem in insula chion spretam post tergum reliquit. and fedra^ A the nis
sibi sponsatam ingratis coronauit

in Ynos as tells the poet
The wiche was sometime king of Crete / A sone he had and androche / He hight
and so befell^ that he
unto Athenis for to ^ere
Was sent / and so he bare him there
For that he was of his lygnage
Such pride he took in his courage
That (...) forgeten has the scoles
And in ryote among fools
He did many things wrong
And used that life so long
Til at the last of that be wrought
He fond the meschyef yt which he sout
Where thorugh he fell yt he was slain
His fader the which it herd sayn
Was wroth / and all that ever he might
Of men of arms he him dyght
A strong power and forth he went
Unto Athenis where he brent
The pleyne country al about
The Cytees stood of him in doubt
As they no defense had
Again the power that he ladde
Egeus that was there king
His cou^ceylle took upon this thing
For he was than in the Cite
So that of pees in to trete
Bitwene mynos and Egeus
They feel and ben acorded thus
That king mynos fro year to year
Receive shall as thou shall here
Out of Athenys for truage
Of men that were of mighty age
Persons nine. of which he shall
His will do in special
For vengeance of his sons death
None other grace there ne geth
But for to take the Iuyse
And for that was done in such a wise
The which stood in a wonder ca as
For that time so it was
Whereof that men yet read and sing
King mynos had in his keeping
A cruel monstre as seith the geste
For he was half man and half beeste
And mynotaurus he was hot
The which was bigoten in a ryote
Upon Phasyfe his own wife
Whiles he was out upon the strif
Of that greet syege of Troy
But she that lost has al joy
When that she saw this moustre bore
Bad men ordeyne another fore
And it fell that same time thus
There was a Clerk one Dedalus
That had been of her assent
Of that her world has myswent
As he that made of his own wit
Whereof the remembrance is yet
For mynotaure such a hows
That was so strong and merueylous
That what man within went
There was so many a diverse went
That he ne shall come out
But go amasyd al about
And in this hows to look and ward
Was mynotaurus put in ward
That what life that therm came
Man or be he ouercam
And slew and fed him thereupon
And in this wise many one
Of Athenys for truage
Devoured were in that rage
For every year they shopen hem so
They of Athenys or they go
Toward thylke woeful channce
As it was set in ordinance
Upon fortune her lot they cast
Til that Theseus at the last
The which was ye kings son there
Among other that there were
In that there as it be fell
The lot upon his chance fell
He was a knight worthy with all
And when he saw his chance fall
He ferd as though he took no head
But all that ever he might speed
With him and with his felauship
Forth in to greece he goth by ship
Where that the king mynos he sought
And profereth all that him is ought
Upon the point of her acorde
This stern king / this cruel lord
Took every day one of the nine
And put him in to disciplyne
Of mynotaure to be devoured
But Theseus was so favored
That he was kept till at the last
And the mean while he cast
What mean thing him were best to do
And fell that Adryane tho
The which was the douter of mynos
And had herd the worthy los
Of Theseus and of his might
And saw that he was a lusty knight
For hole heart on him she laid
And he that also of love her prayed
So ferforth that they were alone
And ordained that anon
In what manner he should him save
And shope so that she did him have
A clewe of threde the wiche withynne
First at-the door he shall begin
And when he would ageyn ward wend
With him to take that one end
He ^^^^t go the same wey
And over this so as I sey
Of speech she took him a pelot
The which he should in to the throat
Of mynotaure cast right
Such wepen also for him she dyght
That he by reason may not fail
To make an end of his battle
For she him taught in diverse wise
Till he was co^nyng of that enpryse
How he this best should kylle
And thus shortly for to tell
So as this maiden him had taught
Theseus with his monstre faught
And smote of his head ye which he nam
And by the thread so as he came
He gothe again til he were out
Than was great wonder al about
Mynos the tribute has rebeced
And so the werre was al seced
Bitwene Athenis and hem of Crete
But now to speak of that sweet
The whose beauty was without wane
This fair maiden Adryane
When she saw Theseus sound
Was never yet upon this ground
A gladder wight than she was tho
Theseus dwelled a day or two
With this maiden spak and rowned
That she to him was abandouned
In all that ever she couthe
So that of her lusty youth
Al pryuely between hem twey
The first flower he took awey
For he so fair her than behyght
That ever while he live might
He should her take for his wife
And as his own hertes life
He should her love and truth her bear
And she that might not forbere
So sore loves him again
That what as ever he would seyne
With all her heart she it leuyth
And thus his purpoos he acheuyth
So that assured of his truth
With him she went and that was routhe
Fedra her young suster eke
A lusty maiden sobre and meke
Fulfilled of al curtosye
For susterhode and company
Of love / the which was hem between
To see her suster be made a queen
Her fader left and forth she went
With him that al his first intent
Forgate within a litel throw
So that it was al overthrow
When that she wend that it should stand
The ship was blown fro the land
Wherein they lay sailend there
This Adryan had mochel fere
Of that the wyndo so loud blewe
As she that of the sea ne knew
And praid for to rest a while
And so fell that vpoon an isle
That this night they ben dreue
Where he to her leave has give
And she shall land and take her rest
But that was nothing for her best
For when she was to land brought
The which at yt time thought nout
But al truth and took no keep
Has laid her down to sleep
As she that long has been forwatched
But certes she was evil matched
And fer from all loves kind
For more than the best unkind
Theseus the which no truth kept
While that this young lady slept
Fulfilled of his vnkyndeship
Has forgeten al godeshyp
The which Adryan had him done
And he bad the shypmen soon
Hale up the sail and not abide
But forth he gothe the same tide
Toward Athenys and there on land
He left his lady in the stronde
Slepend til that she awoke
But when that she cast up hyf look
Toward the stronde and saw no wit
Her heart than was sore aflyght
That she ne wist what to think
But drowe her to the water bryncke
Where so she biheld the sea at large
She saw no ship / she saw no barge
As ferforth as she might kenne
O lord she said such a sin
As all the world shall after here
Upon this woeful woman here
This worthy knyt has done and wrote
I wend I had his love bought
And so deserved at need
When that he stood upon his dread
And also the love he me behyght
It is great wondre how he might
Toward me now be unkind
And so to let out of his mind
Thing that he said his own mouth
But after this when it is couthe
And drawn to the worlds fame
It shall be hynderyng for his name
For well he wot and so wot I
He gaf his troth bodyly
That he my honor should keep
And with that word she began weep
And sorowed more than enough
Her fair tresses she to drough
And with her self she took such a strif
And she bitwene the death and the life
Swounend lay full often among
And all was this on him long
The which was to love unkind so
Whereof the wrong shall euermo
Stand in Cronycle of remembrance
And also it asks a vengeance
To be unkind in loves cas
So as theseus than was
Al though he were a noble knight
For he the law of loves right
Forfeyted has for alwey
That Adryane he putt awey
The which was a greece unkind deed
And after that so as I read
Fedra the which her suster is
He took instead of her and this
Fell afterward to mekel tene
For that vice of which I mean
Vnkyndeship whore it falls
The truth of man's heart it palleth
That he can no good deed acquyte
So may he stand of no merit
Toward god and also
Men call him the worlds so
For he no more than the fend
Unto another man's friend
But al toward him self alone
For thy my sone in thy person
This vice above all other flee
My fader as ye teache me
I thynk to do in this matere
But over this I would fayn here
Whereof I shall me shryue more
My good son and for thy lore
After the reule of couetyse
I shall the propyrte deuyse
Of every vice by and by
Now harken and be well ware thervp
Viribus ex clara res tollit luce rapina / Floris et iuncta virgin mella ca pit

Hic tractat super illa specie Auaricie que Rapina nuncupatur / cuius matter
extorcio ipsam ad deseruiendum magnatum curijs specialius commendauit /

I (...) the lygnage of Audry^^
My sone yet there is a vice
His right name is Rauyne
The which has a route of his couyne
Rauyne among the maystres dwells
And with his servants as men tells
Extorcion is now witholde
Rauyne of other men's fold
Makes his lord and pays naught
For where as ever it may be sought
In his hows there shall no thing lack
And that full often abyeth the pack
Of pour men that dwellen about
Thus sto^deth the common people in doubt
The which can do none amendment
For when him fails payment
Rauyne makes none other skyle
But takes by strength what he will
So ben other in the same wise
Lovers as I shall deuyse
That when not else may avail
Anon with strength they assail
And get of love the sesyne
When they see the time by Rauyne
Of love / Certes fader no
For I my lady love so
For though I were as was Pompey
That all the world me would obey
Or else such as Alisandre
I would not do such a sclaundre
He is no good man that so does
In good feyth sone thou seyst sooth
For he that wol of purueannce
By such a weye his lust auaunce
He shall it after sore abye
But if these old examples lie
Now good fader tell me one
So as they conne many one
Touchend of love in this matere
Now lysten my sone / and thou shall here
So as it has befallen or this
In loves cause how that it is
A man to take the Rauyne
The pray the which is femenyne

There was a ryal noble king
A rich of al worlds thing
The which of his propre enheryta^ce
Athenis had in governance
And who so thinks thereupon
His name was king Pandyon
Two daughters had he by his wife
The which he loved as his life
The first daughter proygne hight
The second as she well might
Was called fair philomene
To whom fell after much tene
The fader of his purueaunce
His daughter Proygne would auance
And gaf her unto marriage
A worthy king of his lygnage
A noble knight also of his hand
So was he kyd in every land
Of Trace he hight Thereus
The Clerk Ouyde tells thus
This thereus his wife home ladde
A lusty life with her he had
Till it be fell upon a tide
This Proygne as she lay him beside
Bethought her how that it might be
That she her suster might see
And to her lord her will she said
With goodly words and him praid
That she to her myghe goo
And if it lyked him not so
That than he would him self wend
Or else by sum other send
The which might her d^re sufter great
And shape how they might mete
Her lord anon to that he herd
Gave his acord / and thus answered
I will he said for your sake
The wey after your suster take
My self and bring her if I may
And she with that there as she lay
^igan him in her arms to clyppe
And kyssed him with her soft lyppe
And said sire grant mercy
And he sone after was ready
And took his leave for to go
In sorry time did he so
This thereus goth forth to ship
And with him his felaushippe
By see the right course he nam
In to the Country til he came
Where Philomene was dwelling
And of her suster the tydyng
He told and than they were glade
And mochel joy of him they made
The fader and the mother both
To leave her daughter they were loathe
But if they were in presence
And nevertheless at the reverence
Of him that would him self travail
They would not that he should fail
Of that he praid to give her leave
And she that would not behind leave
In all have made her ^are
Toward her suster for to fare
With Thereus and forth she went
And be with his hole intent
When she fro her friends is gone
So sottith him on her love anon
That his eyes might he not without
That he ne must on her behold
And with the sight he began desire
And set his own heart a fire
And fire when it to towe approchet^
To him anon the strength ^^rocheth
Till with his hete it be devoured
The towe ne may be succored
And so that Tiraunt rauener
When that she was in his power
And he thereto saw time and space
And he that lose has al grace
Forgate he was a wedded man
And in a rage on her he ran
Right as a wolf that takes his pray
And she bygan to ^^ye and pray
O my fader and mother dear
Now help. but they ne might it here
And she was of to little might
Defense again so rude a knight ^
To make when he was so wood
That he no reason understood
But held her under in such a wise
That she might not arise
But say oppressid and dysesed
And if a Goushauke had seysed
A byrd the which durst not for f^^^
Remeue / and thus this Tiraunt the^^
By^aft such thing as men seyn
May never more be yolden ageyn
And that was the Vyrgyny^^
Of such ^auyn was py^^
But when she to her self came
And of meschyef head name
And knew how that she was no maid
With woeful heart thus she said
O thou of al men the werse
Where was there ever man that ders^
Do such a deed as thou have do
That day shall fall I hope so
That I shall tell out my fylle
And with my speech I shall fulfille
The wide world in ^rede and length
That thou have done to me with str^gth
And if that I among the people dwell
Unto the people I shall it tell
And if I be with in wall
Of stones closed than I shall
Unto the stones clepe and ^^y^
And tell hem all the felonye
And if I to the wodes wend
There shall I ^^le ^ll^ a^ en^^
And cry it to the birds out
That they shall here it al about
For I so loud shall rehearse
That my voice shall the heaven perce
That it shall sown in gods er^
O falls man where is thy fere
O more ^^uel than any be
How shall thou hold thy byheste
The which thou unto my suster mades^
O thou that al love vngladese
And art ensample of al untrue
Now would god my suster knew
Of thyn untruth how that it stood
And he than as a lion wode
With his unhappy hondes strong
He caught her by the tresses long
With the which he bond her arms
That was a feeble deed of arms
And to the ground anon her case
And out he clyppeth also fase
Her tongue with a pair of sheres
So yt what with blood and what with ^eres /
Out of her eyes and of her mouth
He made her fair fa^e uncouth
She lay swownyng unto the death
There was uneath any birth
But yet when he her tongue reft
A little part yet he left
But she no word with all may sown
But chi^^e and as a bird iargowne
And nevertheless that wood hounde
Her body hent up fro thr ground
And put her in a tower strong
Where that for right or for wrong
He pur^osed that for always
She should abide to her deyng day
But nevertheless now takes h^d^
What after fell of this mysdede
When all this meschyef was befalle
This Thereus that foul him befalle
When he was comen his palace ner^
His wife anon with mylde chere
With all reverence honorably him kept
And when he hit saw / anon he wept
And that he did for dissey^^
For she bigan to oske streyte
Where is my suster / and he said
That she was deed and quam^^igue ab^^id
As she that was a woeful wife
And stood bitwene her death and life
By cause she herd this tydyng
But for she saw her lord weeping
She wend not but al truth
And had well the more routhe
The perles were than forsaken
To her and black clothes taken
As she that was gentil and kyn^e
In worship of her susters mind
She made a rich entyerement
For she found none amendment
To syghe sobbe or sorrow more
So was there gyle under the gore
Now leave we this king and queen
And torn we again to philomene
As I bigan to tell erste
When she came to prison ferst
It thought a kyngis donghtet strange
To make so sodeyne a change
Fro welthe unto so great a woe
And she began to thynk tho
Though she by mouth no thing praid
Within her heart thus she said
O thou almighty Iubyter
That bye sit and lokest fer
Thou suffrest many a wrongful doing
And yet it is not thy wyllyng
To the there may no thing be hid
Thou know how it is betid
I would I had not ben borne
For than I had not forlorn
My speech and my vyrgynyte
But good lord all is in the
When thou thereof will do no vengeance
And shape my delyueraunce
And ever among this lady wept
And thought that she never kept
To be a worlds woman more
And that she wysshed evermore
But of^ unto her sufter dear
Her her^^ speaks on this manner
And said O suster and ye knew
Of mine estate ye would rewe
I trow and my delyueraunce
Ye would shap and d^o vengeaun^^
On him that is so falls a man
And nevertheless so as I can
I wpf you send sum tokenyng
Whereof ye shall have some know bechyng
Of thing I wot shall you loathe
The which you touches and me loathe
And than within a while as T^^^
She wafe a clothe of sylke al white
With letters and ymagery
In the which was all the folly
That T^r^us to her had done
And lopped it to gedre sone
And set her signet thereupon
And sent it to proygne anon
The messager that forth it bare
What it amounted was not ware
And nevertheless to proygne he goth
And pryuely takes her the clothe
And went again right as he came
The Court of him no herd nam
When Proygne of Philomene herd
She would know how it ford
And opened that the man had brout
And wo^^ there by what has be wrout
And what meschyef there is befalle
In swoune she began down fall
And efte aroos and began to stand
And efte she takes the clothe on hond
And by^^ld the letters and the images
But at the last out of such outrages
She said to weep is no bote
And swereth if that she leave mote
It shall be ven^ed otherwise
And with that she began her auyse
How first she might unto her wyn
Her suster that no man with
But only they that were swore
It should know and shope therefore
That Thereus no thing it wist
And yet right as her seluen list
Her suster was delyuerd soon
Out of the prison and by the moon
To Proigne she was brout by night
And when ^^he of other had a sight
In Chamber there they were alone
They made many a pit^us moan
But Proigne most of sorrow made
The which saw her suster pale and fade
And specheles and dishonored
Of that she had been de^^oured
And also upon her lord she thought
Of that he so untruly wrought
And had his spousede broken
She made a vow / it should be wroken
And with that word she kneled down
Weeping in great devotion
Unto Cupide and Venus
She praid and than said thus
O ye to whom no thing asterde
Of love may for every heart
Ye know as ye that been above
The god and the goddess of love
Ye wit well that ever yet
With all my will and al my wit
Since first ye shope me to wedde
That I lay with my lord in bed
I have been true in my degree
And ever thought for to be
And never to love in other place
But al only the king of Trace
The which is my lord and I his wife
But now allas this woeful strif
That I him thus ageynward find
The most vntre we and the most unkind
That ever in lady arms lay
And well I wot that ne may
Amend it* his wrong is so great
For full little of me he let
When he mine own suster took
And me that am his wife forsook
Loo thus to Venus and Cupyde
She praid / and ferthermore she cryde
Unto A^^ollo the hyhest
And said O mighty god of rest
Thou do vengeance on this debate
My suster and al her estate
Thou know* and how she has forlore
Her mandenhede / and I therefore
In all the world shall here a blame
Of that my suster has a shame
That Thereus to her I sent
That well thou know that mine intent
Was al for worship and for good
O lord that geuest lives fode
To every wight I pray the here
The woeful susters that been here
And late us not to the be loathe
We ben thyn own women loathe
Thus playneth proigne and asks wreche /
And though her suster tack speech
To him that al thing wot
Her sorrow is not the less hot
But he that than herd hem two
Him ought to have sorowed euermo
For sorrow that was hem bitwene
With signs pleyneth philomene
And Proigne seith she shall it wreke
That all the world thereof shall speak
And Proigne than sykenes feyned
Whereof unto her lord she pleyned
And praid she might her chamber keep
And as her lysteth wake or sleep
And he her granted to be so
And thus to gedre be they two
That would him but a little good
Now harken herafter how it stood
O woeful auentures that be fell
These susters that been both fell
And that was not on hem alonge
But only on the great wrong
The which Thereus had hem done
They purpose to venge hem soon
This Thereus by proigne his wife
A sone had that as his life
Beloved / and this he hight
And his mother wist well she might
Do T^reus no more grieve
Than slay his child that was so leave
Thus she yt was as who said mad
Of woe / the which has her ouerladde
Without insight of moderhede
Forgate pity and lost dread
And in her chamber pryuely
That child without noise or cry
She slew and hew him al to pieces
And after with diverse spyeces
The flesh when it was hew
She takes and made thereof a sewe
And the fader at his mete
She served and he began him ete
That he ne wist how it stood
But thus his own flesh and blood
Him self devoured again kind
To him that was to fore unkind
And than or that he can up rise
For that his heart should agryse
To show him his child was deed
This Philomene took up the head
Bitwene two disshes and al wroth
So came forth the susters both
And setten it on the board
And proigne than began the word
And said O werst of all wykke
Of conseyence whom no prykke
May stere / loo what thou have do
Lo here ben now we susters two
O Rauener loo here thy pray
With whom so falsely on the way
Thou have thy Tirannye wrought
Lo now it is somdele bought
And better it shall for thy deed
The world shall ever sing and read
In remembrance of thy defame
For thou to love have done such shame
That it shall never be forgete
With that he sterte up fro the mete
And shoue the board in to the flore
And caught a swerd anon and swore
That they should of his hondes deye
And they unto the gods cry
Bigan with so loud a steuene
That they were herd up to heuene
And in the twynkelyng of an eye
The gods that the meschyef seye
Here forms changed al three
Each of hem in his degree
Was turned in to a birds kind
Delyuerly as men may find
After the seat that they were ynne
Her forms were set a twynne
And as it tells in the tale
The first in to a nyghtingale
Was shapen and that was Philomene
The which in the winter is not seen
For than be the leaves fall
And naked ^en the busshes all
For after that she was a bird
Her will was ever to be hyd
And for to dwell in pryue place
T^^t noman should see her face
For shame that might not be lassid
Of thing that was before passid
When that she lost her maydenhede
For ever upon her womanhede
Though that the gods would her change
She thinks / and is the more strange
And holds her cloos the winter day
But when the winter goth awey
And that nature the goddess
Will of her own fre largess
With herbis and with flowers both
Tse feldis and the meadows clothe
Also the woods and the greues
Ben hylled all with grene leaves
So that a byrd her hyde may
Bitwene mars Apryl and may
S^e that the winter held cloos
For pure shame and not aroos
When that she saw the bows thyck
And that there is no bare styck
But (...) is hyd with leuys grene
To wode comes this Philomene
And makes her playnte night and day
Say^ng as every man here may
O why ne were I yet a maid
For so this old wise said
The which understood what she meant
Her notes ben of such intent
And eke they said how in her song
She makes great joy and myrthe among
And said now I am a bird
And now my face may be hyd
Though I have lost my maydenhede
Shall no man see my chekes read
Thus medleth she with joy woe
And with her sorrow myrthe also
So that of loves maladye
She makes dynerse melo^ye
And said love is a woeful bliss
A wysdom that can no man wysse
A lusty fever a wound soft
This note she reherceth often
To hem that understand her tale
Now have I of this nyghtyngale
The which erst was cleped Philomene
Told all that ever she would mean
Both of her form and of her note
Whereof men may the story note
And of her suster Proigne I find
How she was turned out of kind
In to a swalowe swyft of wynge
That also in winter lies sowyng
There as she may no thing be seen
But when the world is woxen grene
And comen is the somer tide
Then flies she forth and begin to chyde
And chatereth out in her langage
What falshede is in marriage
And tells in a manner speech
Of terms the spouse breche
She wol not in woods dwell
For she would openly tell
And also for that she was a spouse
Among the folks she comes in house
To do these wives understand
The falshede of her husbonde
That they be ware of hem also
For there be many untrue of tho
Thus ben these susters birds asthe
And ben to ward the men so loathe
That they ne will for pure shame
To no man's hand be tame
For ever it dwells in her mind
Of that they fond a man unkind
And that was falls Thereus
If such one be among us
A note but his condycyon
Men say in every Regyon
Within to wne and eke without
Now regneth commonly about
And namely in remembrance
I will declare what vengeance
The gods had him ordained
Of that the susters had pleyned
For anoue he was changed
And from his own kind straunged
A lapwenche made he was
And thus he hoppeth on the gras
And on his head stondeth up right
A crest in token he was a knight
And yet unto this day men seith
The lapwenche has lost his feyth
And is the byrd ful^est of all
Confessor
Be ware my sone or that ye so fall
For if thou (...) of such couyne
To get of love the Rauyne
Thy lust it may fall the thus
As it befelle of Thereus
Amans
My fader god forbede
Me were lever be fortrede
With wyld horses and to draw
Er I again love and his law
Did any thing or loud or stylle
The which were not my ladies will
Men seyen that every love has dread
So follows it that I her dread
For I her love / and who so dredeth
To plese his love and serve him needs
Thus may ye know by what skylle
That no rauyn do I will
Again her will by such a weye
But while I live I will obey
Abiding on her curtosye
If any mercy would her ply^
For thy my fader as of this
I wot not that I have do amys
But ferthermore I shall byseche
Thou that some other point ye me teache
And asks forth if there be ought
That I may be the better taught
^iu^t vt ex spolijs grandi quam sepe tumultum / Quo graditur p^pul^s latro
perurget iter / Sic amor ex (...) su poterit quo carpere predam / Si locus est
aptus cetera multa timet

Hic loquitur super cupiditatis specie. quam furtum vocant / cuius ministri
alicuius legis offensam non metutes tam in amoris causa qua^ ali^r saam quam
sepe conscienciam offendunt /

When Couetyse in pour estate
Stondeth with him self upon debate /
Through lack of mysgouernaunce /
That he unto his sustenau^ce
Ne can none other wey find
To get him good than as the blind
The which sees not what shall after
fall / That ylke vice / yt which me^ call
Of Robbery he takes on hand
Where thorugh the water and the land
Of thing that other men forswynke
He geteth him clothe mete and drink
Him retcheth not what to do he begin
Though theft so that he may wyn
For thy to make his purchaas
He lies waytyng on the paas
And what thing yt he sees there pass
He takes his paas more and less
If it be ought worth for to take
He can the pakkes well rensake
So pryncly bears none about
His gold ne be it fyndeth out
Or other ^ewel what it be
He takes it as his propyrte
In wodes and in feldes eke
Thus Robbery goth to seek
Where as he may / his purpoos find
And right so in the same kind
My good sone as thou might here
To speak of love in this matere
And make a very resemblaunce
Right as a thief makes his cheuesa^ce
And robs men's goods about
In wood in feld where he goth out
So ben there of these lovers some
In wild stedes where they come
And find there a woman able
And thereto space couenable
Without let or that they fare
They take a part of that chaffare
Ye though she were a shepeherdesse
Yet would the lord of wantonness
Assay all though he be v^mete
For other men's good is swe^^*
But thereof wot nothing the wife
At f^me / the which loves as her life
Her lord and sytteth alwey wysshyug
After her lords home coming
But when he comes home at eve
Anon he makes his wife to leave
For she not else should know
He tells her how his hu^te began blow
And how his hounds have well run
And how there shone a merry son
And how his hawks flowen well
But ^e would tell her never a dele
How ^e to love untrue was
Of that ^e robbed in the pas
And took his lust under the shawe
Again love and again his law
The which thing my seen I the forbede
For it i^ an ungoodly deed
For who that takes by Robberye
His love ^e may not ^ustyfye
His cause and so full often sithe
For onye that he has been blythe
He shall be after sorry thryes
Examples for such robberyes
I find written as thou shall here
Acordynge unto this matere
Hic loquitur contra istos in amo^ ^s causa predones / qui cum suam furtiue
concupiscenciam aspirant / fortuna in contra^u^ operatur / Et narrat quod cum
Neptunus quandam virginem no mine Cornicem solam inxta more dea^bulantem
opprimere suo furto voluisset / superueniens pallas ipsam de manibus eius
virginitate seruata gracius l^ bera^it

I Read how whilome was a m^id
The fairest as Ouyde said
That was in her time tho
And she was of the chamber also
Of ^allas that is the goddess
Wife to mars / of whom the prowess
Is given to these worthy knights
For he is of so great myghtes
That he governs the bataile
Without him may not avail
The strong hand but he it help
There may no knight of arms yelpe
But he fight under his banere
But now to speak of my matere
This fair fresshe lusty may
Alone as she went on a day
Upon the stronde for to play
There came Neptunus in the way
The which has the sea in governance
And in his heart such plesaunce
He took when he this maiden sygh
That all his heart aroos on high
For he so suddenly unware
Beheld the beauty that she bare
And cast anon in his heart
That she shall him no wey asterte
But if he take in advantage
From that maiden some ^^l^ge
Not of no broches ne of no things
But of sum other small things
He thought to have part or yt she went
And her in both his arms hent
And put his hond toward the Cofre
Wherefore to rob he made a profere
That lusty tresour for to stele
The which passes other goods fe^^
That called is the may^enhede
The which is the flower of womanhede
This maid that C^^nyx by name
Was cleped dredyng al shame
Saw that she might not debate
And well she wist he would algate
Fulfylle his lust of Robberye
Anon began to weep and crye^
And said O pallas noble queen
Show now thy might and late be sent
To keep and save mine honor
Help that I lose not my flower
The which now under key is loken
That word was not so soon spoken
When pallas shope recouyre
After the will and the desire
Of her the which a maiden was
And suddenly upon this cas
Out of her woman's kind
In to a birds lykenes I find
She was transformed forth with all
So that Neptunus no thing stall
Of thing that he would have stole
With federes black as any cole
Out of his arms in a throw
She flewe before his eyes a crow
The which was to her more delight
To keep her maydenhede white
Under the wede of feathers blake
Than in perlys white to forsake
That no life may restore again
But thus Neptune his heart in veyn
Has upon robbery set
The byrd was flowen and he was let
The fair maid is fro him escaped
So that for ever le was ^ei^^ed
And sco^^^d of that ^e has ^ore
My sone ^e thou ware therefore
That thou no maydenhede stele
Whereof men see dyseses feel
Al day befalle in diverse wise
So as I shall the yet deuyse
Another tale thereupon
That fell by old ^^yes gone
Hic ponit ex^plu^ co^tra istos in causa virginitatis lose predonis et narrat
quoth cum Calistona Regis Lichoantis mire pulcritudinis filia suam virginitatem
D^ane conseruare castissima^ voluisset. Et in s^luam que tegea dicitur inter
alias ^hidem Nimphas moraturam se transtulit* ^ubiter virginis castitatem
subtili furto surripiens quendam filium qui postea Archas nominatus e^ ex ea
genuit / vnde Juno in Calistona^ semel eius pulcritudinem in vrse tur pissime
deformitatem subito transfigurauit

KYn^ Lychaon upon his wife
A daughter had a goodely lif
And cleue maiden of worthy fame /
Calystona whoos right name
Was cleped and of many a lord
She was besought / but her acorde
To love might no man wyn
As she that had no lust therein
But swore in her heart and said
That she would ever be a maid
Wherefore to keep her self and pees
With such as amadryades
Were clexed were maidens tho
And with the Nymp^es eke also*
Upon the spryng of fresshe wells
She shope to dwell and nowhere ell^^
And thus came this Calistona
In to the wode to Tegea
Where she vyrgynyte behyght
Unto Dyane and thereto plygh^
Her truth upon the bows g^^ne
To keep her maydenhede clean
The which afterward upon a day
Was pryuely stolen away
For Iubiter thorugh his queyntyse
From her it took in such a wise
That suddenly forth with all
Her womb aroos / and she to swalle
So that it might not be hid
And thereupon it is betydde
That Dyane the which it herd tell
In pryue place unto a well
With Nymphs al a company
Was comen and in aragerye
She said that she bathe would
And bad that every maiden should
With her al naked bathe also
And than began the preuy woo
C^listona wex read shame
But they that knew not the game
To whom such thing was befalle
A none they made hem naked all
As they no thing would hyde
But she withdrewe her ever aside
And netheles in the flode
Where that Dyana her selue stood
She thought to come vnperceyued
But thereof she was all deceived
For when she came a little nyghe
And that Dyana her womb seygh
She said awey thou foul be
For thyn estate is not honest
This chaste water for to touch
For thon have had such a touch
The which never may be hole again
And thus goth she that was forleyn
With shame and the Nymphs fled
Til when that nature her spedde
That of a son that hight Archas
Was named she delyuerd was
And Juno that was the wife
Of Iubiter wroth and hastyf
In purpoos for to do vengeance
Came forth upon that chance
And to Calistona she spakke
And set upon her many a lack
And said a now thou art take
That thou thy werk may not forsake
A thou ungoodly ypocryte
Thou art gretely for to wit
But now thou shall fnl sore abye
That ylke stelthe and mycherye
That thou have both take and do
Whereof thy fader Lychao
Shall not be glad when he it wot
Of that his daughter was so hot
That she has broken her chaste vow
But I the shall chastyse now
Thy great beauty shall be turned
Thorugh which yt thou have be mystorned
Thy large front thy eyes gray
I shall hem change in other way
And of the feture of thy face
In such a wise I shall deface
For every man the shall forbere
And forth with the lykenes of a fer^
She took and was forshapen anon
And within a time thereupon
Byfelle that with a bow in hand
To hunte and gamen for to fond
In to that wood gothe for to play
Her sone Archas and in his way
He happed that this here came
And when that she good head name
Where that he stood under a bow
She knew him well and to him drowe
For though she had her form lore
The love was not lost therefore
The which kind has set under his
law / When she under the wood shawe
Her child belhed she was so glade
That she with both her arms sprade
And though she were in womanhede
Toward him come and took no head
How that he bare a bow bente
And he with that an arowe sent
And began to tyse it in his bow
As he that can none other know
But that it was a be wild
But Inpiter that would shylde
The mother and the sone also
Ordained for hem both so
That they for ever were save
But thus my sone thou might have
Ensample how it is to flee
To rob the vyrgynyte
Of a young Innocent awey
And ever this by ouy wey
In old books as I read
Sache robberye is for to dread
And namely of that good
The which ever woman that is good
Desires for to keep and hold
As somtymes was by days old
For if thou here my tale well
Of that was than thou may somde^
Of old ensample take heed
How that the flower of maydenhed^
Was that time holden in prys
And so it was and so it is
And so it shall for ever stand
And for thou shall it understand
Now herkene the tale next sewend
How maydenhede is to commend
Hic loquitur de virginitat^^ comm^ dacione vbi dicit quod nuper Imperatores
obstanti status dignitatem virginibus sedebant in via

oF Rome among the gestes old
I find how Valery told
That what man so ever were
emperor / Of rome he should do honor
To a vyrgyn and in the weye
Where he her mete he should obey
In worship of vyrgynyte
That was than of great dignyte
And not only of the women tho
But of the chaste men also
It was commended ouerall
And to speak thereof in special
Hic loquitur qualiter Phirinus iu uenu^ rome pulcherrimus vt ill^sa^ sua^
virginitatem conseruaret ambos oculos ^ruens vulti sui decorem abhominabilem
constituit

tOuchend of men ensample I find
Phirinus yt was of ma^s kind
Above al other the fairest
Of Rome and also the comlyest
That well was her that might
Behold and have of him a sight
Thus was he tempted often sore
But for the would be no more
Among the women so coueyted
The beauty of his face streyted
He has and threst out both his eyes
That all wymmen that him seyn
Than afterward of him ne rought
And thus his maydenhede he bonght
So may I prove will for thy
Above al other under the sky
That maydenhede is for to preyse
Who that the virtues would peyse
The which as the apocalipsis records
To Cast in heaven best acordeth
Hij sequntur Agnum quocumq ^erit

So may I show well therefore
As I have told it bear a fore
In heaven and in earth also
It is except both two
Out of his flesh a man to leven
Gregory has this ensample given
In carne preter carnem viuere pocius
vita angelica est quam humana
And Ierom seyth it shall rather be told
Lyker to an Angel many fold
Than to the life of man's kind
There is no reason for to find
But only thorugh the grace above
In flesh without flesshely love
And man to live chaste here
And nevertheless a man may here
Of such as have been or this
And yet there ben / but for it is
A virtue that is seldom won
Now I this matter have begone
I think to tell thereof more
The which my sone for thy lord
If that the list to take heed
To trete upon maydenhede
Vt Rosa de spinis spineto preualet orta / Vt filij flores cespite plura vale^t
S^c sibi virgiuitas carnis spo^salia vin cit / Eternos fetus que sine lahe parit

The books seyn that a ma^ns life
Upon knyghthode in werre and strif
Is set among his enemies
Right so the freel flessh whose nature is
Ay ready for to spurn and fall
The first foman is of all
For that werre is ready ay
It werreth night / it werreth day
So that a man has never rest
And therefore is that knight the best
Thorugh might and grace of gods sonde
The which that bataill may withsto^de
Whereof it dwells the memory
Of hem that sometime the vyctorye
Of that dedely werre hadden
The hyhe prowess ye which they hadd^
Where thorugh ye soul stood amended
Upon this earth is yet commended
Hic loquitur qualiter Valentinianus Imperator ipse octogenarius plures
prou^ncias Romano Imperio belliger sub iugauit / dixit se super o^nia magis
gaudere de eo quod contra sue carnis concupiscenciam victoriam op^^nuisset /
nam et ipse virgo omnibus diebus vite sue castissimus permansit /

aN Emperor by old days
There was / and he at al assayes
A worthy knyt was of his
hand / There was no such in all the lo^d
But yet for all his vassellage
He stood un wedded al his age
And in Cronycle as it is told
He was an honderd winter old
But when men would his deeds peyse
And his knyghthode of arms preyse
Of that he did with his hondes
When he the kings and the lands
To his subjection put under
Of all that price had he no Wonder
For he it set at none acounte
And seid ^ll that might not amounte
Ageyn one point that he has nomen
That his flesh he has ouercomen
He was a virgyn as he said
On that battle his prys he laid
Lo now my sone auyse the
Fader all this may well be
But and al other did so
The world of men were sone ag^
And in the law men may find
How god to man the law of kind
Has set the world to multyplye
And who that will him Iustyfye
It is not to do the law
And nevertheless your good saw
Is good to keep who so may
I wol not there again seye nay
My sone take it as I say
If maydenhede be taken away
Without laws ordinance
It may not fail of vengeauuce
And if thou wylt the sooth wyten
Behold a tale the which is written
How that the king of Agamenon
When he the Cite of L^sbon
Had wonuen / a maiden there he fond
That was the fairest of the land
In that time that men wist
And he had of her what him list
Whereof that she was dangerous
Of ye thing yt which was most precious
This fair maiden cleped is
Creseyde the daughter of Crysys
The which was that time special
Of that time bishop pryncipal
Where Phoebus had his sacryfyce
So was it well the more vice
Agamenon was than in way
To Troyward and took a way
This maiden that he with him ladde
And great lust in her he had
But Phoebus yt which had great disdeyne
For yt this maiden was forleyn
Anon as he to Troy came
Mengeaunce upon this deed name
And sent a comune pestylence
They sought than her euydence
And made calculacion
To know in what condicyon
This death came in suddenly
And at the last redyly
The cause and also the man they fond
And forth with all the same stounde
Agamenon opposed was
The which has knowleched all ye cas
Of the folly that he has wrought
And thereupon mercy they sought
Toward the god in diverse wise
With prayer and with sacryfyce
And the maiden home they send
And gafe her gold enough to spend
For ever whiles she would live
And thus the syn was forgive
And all the pestylence seced
Loo what it is to be encrecid
Of love which is ylle won
It were letter be vnbegonne
Than take a thing without leave
Which thou must after needs leave
And yet have maugre forth with all
For thy to robben ouerall
In loves cause if thou begin
I not what ease thou shall win
My fader so will I wys
My sone be well ware of this
But now your examplarye
In love is cause of Robberye
I have it right well understand
But over this how so it stand
Yet wol I wit of your apryse
What thing is more of Couetyse
In^idiando latens tempus rimatur et horam / Fur quibus occulto tempore furta
parat / Sic amor insidijs vacat et sub tegmine lauds / Pre^dere furtiuos nocte
fauente queat.

Hic tractat super illa cupiditatis specie que secrum latrocinium dicitur /
cuius natura custodire rerum nesciente ea que cupit tam per diem quam per n^c
tem absq strepitu clauculo fnratur /

With Couetyse if I find
A servant of the same kind
Which steleth is hot and myche
^ye. With him is ever in company
Of whom if I shall tell sooth
He stalketh as a Pecok does
And takes his pray so couerte
That no man wot it in aperte
And wot the lord at home
Than would he stalk about and come
And what thing he fynt in his way
When that he saw the men away
He steleth it and goth forth with all
That thereof no man know shall
And eke ^uf often he goth a night
Withouten moan or sterre light
And with his craft the door vnpykyth
And takes therein what him lyketh
And if the door be so shet
That he be of his enter let
He will at the wyndowe in crept
And while the lord is fast a sleep
He steleth what thing him best list
And goth his wey or it be wist
Full often also by light of day
Yet would he stele and make assay
Under the cete his hond he put
And with a knyf his purs he cut
And receives what he find therein
And thus he auntreth him to win
And bears an horn and not blows
For no man of his counceyll knows
That he may get of his mychyng
It is al bylle under the wyng
And as an hound goth to fold
And has there taken what he would
His mouth upon the gras he wypeth
And so with feyned chere him slyketh
And what as ever of sheep he strangle
There is no man thereof shall iangle
As for to know who it deed
Right so does stelthe in every stead
Where as him list his pray take
He can so well his cause make
And so well feyne / and so well gloss
That there ne shall no man suppose
But that he were an Innocent
And thus a man's eye he blent
So that this craft he may use
Without help of any refuse
There ben lovers of that degree
With all her lust in pryuete
As who sey geten al by stelthe
And there of atteynen to great welthe
And for the time that it lasts
For love awayteth ever and casts
How he may stele and catch his pray
When he thereto may find a way
For be it night or be it day
He takes his part when he may
And if he may no more do
Yet wol he stele a kiss or two
Tell if thou ever dydest so
In any wise thy lady unto
My fader how my sone thus
If thou have stolen any kus
Or other thing that thereto longs
For no man such thieves hongeth
Tell on for thy and sey the truth
My fader nay / and that is routhe
For by will I am a thief
But she that is to me most lef^
Yet durst I never in pryuete
Mot ones take byr by the kne
To stele of her or this or that
And if I durst I wot well what
And netheles but if I lie
By stelthe ne by robberye
Of love which fell in my thought
To her did I never naught
But as me^ seyn where heart is failed
There shall no castle be assailed
But though I had hertes ten
And were as strong as all men
If I be not mine own man
I dare not vsen that I can
I may my self not recouere
Though I be man never so pouere
I bear an heart / and it is
So that me fails wit in this
How that I should of mine acorde
The servant led against the lord
For if my foot would owhere go
Or that my hondes would else do^
When that my heart is there again
The remenaunt is all in vein
And thus me lacks al we will
And yet ne dare I not steel
Of thing which longs unto love
And eke it is so hie above
I may not well thereto areche
But so be at time of speech
Full seld if that I stele may
A word or two and go my way
Betwyxt her / his estate and me
Comparyson there may none be
So that I feel and well wot
Al is to heavy and to hot
To set on hond without love
And thus I mote algate leave
To stele that I may not take
And in this wise I mote forsake
To ^en a thief again my will
Of thing which I may not fulfylle
For that serpent which never slepte
The flees of gold so well ne kept
In Colchos as the tale is told
That my lady a thousand fold
Is better yemed and bewaked
Where she be clothed or be naked
To keep her body night and day
She has a wardey^ ^dy ay
Which is so wonderful a wight
That him no man's might
With sword ne wepen may daunte
Ne with no sleyghte of charm encha^t^
Whereof he might be made tame
And danger is his right name
Which under lock and under key
That no man may her stele awey
And all the tresoure vnderfonge
That unto love may be long
The lest lokyng of her eye
That mote be stole if he it seye
And who so grutcheth for so lyte
He would sone set a wit
On him that would stelle more
And that me greueth wonder sore
For this proverb is ever new
That strange lokes maken ^trewe
A^ that wolden stele and pyke
For so well can no man syke
By him nether by no other mean
To whom danger would ^eue or lene
Of that tresoure he has to keep
So though I would stalk or crepe
And wait on eve and eke on morrow
Of danger shall I no thing borowe
And stele I wot well may I nout
And thus I am right well bethought
While danger stondeth in his office
Of stelthe which he clepeth a vice
I shall be gylty neuermo
Therefore I would he were ago
So fet that I never of him hert^
How so afterward it ferd
For than I might afterward perca^
Of love make sum purchaas
By stelth or by sum other way
That now stont fro me fer away
But fader as ye told above
Who steleth goth a night for love
I may not well that point forsake
That oftymes I ne wake
On nyghtes when that other sleep
But how I pray you take keep
When I am looked in such a wise
That by night I may arise
At sum wyndowe loken out
And see the howsyng al about
So that I may the chamber know
In which my lady as I trow
Lies in her bed and slepeth soft
Than is my heart a thief full often
For there I stand to behold
The long nyghtes that been cold
And thynk on her that lies here
And than I wysshe that I were there
As wys as was Nectanabus
Or ^ls as was Protheus
That couthen both of nygromance
In what lykenes in what semblau^ce
Right as hem list hem self transform
For if I were of such a form
I say that I would flee
In to her chamber for to see
If any grace would fall
So that I might under the palle
Sum thing of love pyke or stele
And thus I think thoughts feel
And though thereof no thing be sooth
Yet case as for a time it does
But at the last when I find
That I am fall in to my mind
And sce that I have stond long
And have no profit vnderfonge
Than stalk I to my bed within
And there to think I begin
Of love when I shall by night
My will is good / but my might
Me lacks both and of my grace
For what so that my thought enbrace
Yet have I not the better ferde
My fader / ^oo now have ye herd
What I by stelthe of ^oue have do
And how my will has be thereto
If I be worthy to penance
I put it unto your ordinance
My sone for stelthe I the byhete
Though it be for a time sweet
At end it does but little good
As by ensample how that it stood
Whilome I may the tell now
I pray you fader tell me how
My sone of him which gothe by day
By wey of stelthe to assay
In loves cause and takes his pray
Ouyde said as I shall say
And in his methamor he told
A tale which is good to hold
Hic in amoris causa super isto latelcinio quod dietim contingit ponit exem
p^^m / Et narrat quod cum Linchotor Orchanni filia in camer^s sub Archa mat^^s
custodia virgo conseruabatur / Phoebus eiue pulchritudinem concupis hens in
conclaue domus clara luce sub ^ntrans virginis pudiciciam matre absente
deflorauit / vnde ipsa inpregnata ^ratus pater filiam suam ad sepeliendu^ ^^ua
effodit ex cuius tumulo florem sol sequium vocant / dicunt consequenter
primitus accreuisse

tHe poet upon this matere
Of si^lth wrote in this manner
Venus which has ye law in hand
Of thing which may not be withsta^d^
As she with the tresour toward
Of love has within her ward
Phoebus to love has so constreyned
That he without rest is payned
With all his heart to coueite
A maid which was warded streyte
Within chamber and kept so cloos
That seldom was when she discloos
Goth with her mother for to play
Lenchoter so as men say
This maiden hight / and Orc^anus
Her fader was. and befelle thus
This daughter that was kept so dear
And had been before year to year
Under her mother discyplyne
A clean malden and a vyrgyne
Upon the whoos natyuyte
Of comelyhede and of beauty
Nature has set all that she may
That lyche unto the fresshe may
With either months of the year
Sourmounteth so without pere
Was of this maiden the feiture
Whereof phoebus out of mesure
Her loves on every side
A waits if so may betyde
That he thorugh any sleygthe might
Her lusty maydenhede unright
The which were al his worlds wealth
And thus lurkyng upon his stelthe
In his awayte so long he lay
Till it befelle upon a day
That he thorugh out her chamber wall
Came in all suddenly and stalle
That thing that was to him so lyefe
But woo the while yt he was a thief
For Venus which was enemy
Of thylk loves mycherye
Discouerith all the plain caa^
How it befelle and how it was
Toward phoebus his concubyne
And she to let the Couyne
Of thylk love dedely ^brothe
To pleyne upon this maid he goth
And told her fader how it stood
Whereof for sorrow well nyhe wood
Unto her mother thus he said
Loo what is to keep a maid
To Phoebus dare I no thing speak
But upon this I shall be wreke
So that these maidens after this
Mow take ensample what it is
To suffer her maydenhede to be stole
Where that she the death may thole
And bad with that / go make a pytte
Wherein he has his daughter set
As he that would no pity have
So that she was al quyck be grave
And deed anon in his presence
But Phoebus for the reverence
Of that she had been his love
Has wrout thoru his power above
That she sprung up out the molde
In to a flower was named gold
Which stonte governs of the son
And thus when love is evil won
Full often it comes to repentayle
My fader that is no marvel
When that the counceyll is be wreyed
And oftyme love has pleyed
And stole many a pryue game
Which never yet came to blame
What that he thinks weren hid
But in your tale as betydde
Venus disturbed all the caas
And eke also broad day it was
When Phoebus such a fylthe wrought
Whereof the maid in blame brought
That afterward she was so fore
But for ye seyden now to fore
How stelth of love goth by night
And does his things out of sight
Thereof me lust also to here
A tale lyche to the matere
Whereof I might ensample take
My good sone and for thy sake
So as it befelle by days old
And so as the poet it told
Upon the nyghtes mycherye
Now harken a tale of Poesye
Hic ponit ^yemplum super eodem quod de notte contingit* Et narrat qualiter
Hercules cum Eola in quadam spelunca nobili Thophis dicta sub mo^te thimolo ibi
silua bachi e^ hospicio pernoctarunt / Et cum ipsi varijs lectis seperatim
iacentes dormi^runt / contigit lectum Herculis vestimentis Eole lectum q Eole
pelle leonis contra Hercules induebatur operari super quo fobnns a silua
descendeus speluncam subintrauit temptans si forte cum Eola sue concupiscencie
voluptatem. nesciente Hercules furari posset / Et cum ad lectum Herculis
muliebri palpata vest ex casu peruenisset putans Eolam fuisse cubiculum nudo
corpore ingreditur quem senciens Hercules manibus apprehe^sum ipsum ad terra^
ita fortiter al lisit vt inpotens sui corporis effectus vsa mane ipsum
requieuit / vbi Saba cum Nymphis siluestribus superue niens ipsum sic illusum
deridebat

tHe myghtyest of all men
When hercules with Eolen
Which was ye love of his courage /
To geder upon a pylgremage
Toward Rome sholden goo
It fell hem by the way so
That they upon a day the cave
Within a roche founden have
Which was ryall and glorious
And of entayle curious
By name and Thopis it was hot
The son shone tho wonder hot
As it was in somer tide
This Hercules which by his side
Has Eolen his love there
When they at thylk cave were
He seid it thought it for the best
That she three for her rest
All thylk day and thylke night
And she that was a lusty wight
In every thing to him obeyd^
^it lyketh her all that he seide
The long day / and so befelle
This cave was under the hylle
Of thymolus which was ^^growe
With wet^es / and at thylk throw
Fanus with Saba the goddess
And other Nimphus of her kyndenesse
In thylke time stood governed
Were in a place as I am learned
Nyghe by which bachus wood hit
This fanus took a great insight
Of c^len that was nyghe
For when that he her beauty syghe
^ute of his wit he was assoted
And in his heart he has so noted
That he forsook the Nymphs all
And said he would how so it fall
Assay another for to win
So that his heart thought withynne
He set and cast how that he might
Of love pyke aw^y by night
That be by day in other wise
To stele might not suffyse
And thereupon his time he wayt^th
Now take good b^de how love affa^teth
Him which is with love al oueroome
Fair Eolen when she was come
With Hercules in to the cave
S^^ said that so^ would have
His (...) of and fire both
And ech^ of hem sheld other clothe
And all was do right as she bade
He has her in his clothes clade
And cast on her his gypyon
Which of the skyn of a lion
Was made and he upon the wey
It slough and ever thus to pley
She took his great mace also
And knytted at her gyrdel the
So was she lyche to man awyd
And Hercules has than assayd
To clothen him in her array
And thus they iape forth the day
Till that her souper ready we^^
And when they hadden souped there
They shopen hem to goo to rest
And as it thought hem for the best
They bad as for thylke night
Two sundry beds should be dyght
For they ^e geder lygge nold
By cause that they offer would
Upon the morrow her sacryfice
The servant and din her office
And sondey beds made anon^
Where in that they to rest gone
Each by hem self in sundry place
Fair Eolen has set the mace
Besides her beds bid above
And with the clothes of her love
She hylled all her bed about
And he which had of no thing douts
Her wympel wonde about his chek^
Her kyrtel and her mantell eke
Abroad upon his bed spredde
And thus they slepen both a bed
And what of travail and what of win The servant like to a dronken swyn
Bygan for to rowte fast
This Fanus which his stelthe cast
Was than comen to the cave
And fond they were al save
Without noise and in he went
The derk night his sight blent
And yet it happed him to god
Where Eolen a bed tho
Was leyd alone for to sleep
But for he would take keep
Whoos bed it was he made assay^
And of a lion where he lay
The cote he found and eke he feleth
The mace / and than his heart ke^eth
That there durst he not abide
But stalketh upon every side
And sought about with his hond^
That other bed till he fond
Where lay wympled a vysage
Tho was he glad in his courage
For he her kyrtell fond also
And eke her mantell both two
Bespred upon a ^ed a^oft
He made him naked than soft
In the bed unware he crepte
Where Hercules that time slept
And wend well it were she
And thus instead of Eole
Anon be profereth him love
And he which felt a man above
This Hercules him threw to ground
So sore that they have him fond
Lyggend thereupon the morrow
And tho was not a little sorrow
That fanus of him self made
^nt else they were al glade
And loghen him to scorn about
Saba with Nymp^^s all the route
^am down to look how that he ferd
And when that they the sooth herd
He was beiaped oueral
My sone be thou ware with all
To use such mycheryes
But if thou have the better aspy^^
In aunture if the so betyde
As fanus did thylke tide
Whereof thou might be shamed so
My holy fader certes no
But if I had right good leave
Such mycherye I think leave
Mine faint heart wol not serve
For maugre will I not deserve
In thylke place where I love
But for ye tolden here above
Of Couetyse and his pyllage
If there be more of that lygnage
Which touches to my shuft I pray
That thereof ye me would assay
So that I may the vice eschew
My sone thou have herd me show
The vices how they stont on row
Of Cou^^yse thou shall know
There is yet one which is the last
That is sacrylege be thou fast
For he with god him self debateth
Whereof that a^^e the henen him hatet^
Sacrilegus tantum furto loca sacra prophanat. Vt sibi sint agri sic domus a^ma
dei / Nec locus est in quo no^ temptat amans quod amat / Si que posse nequit
carpere ^elle capit

Hic tractat super vltima Cupidita^is specie que sacrilegium dicitur / cuius
fructum ea quam altissimo sanctificantur bona depredans ^^^lesie tantum spolijs
insidiatu^

tHe hyhe god with all good
Purueyeth has for man's fode
Of clothes of mete and drink
Bade Adam that he should swynke
To geten him his sustenaunce
And eke be set in ordinance
Upon law of Moses
That though a man be haueles
He shall not by theft stele
But now a days there be feel
That wol no labor undertake
But what they may by stelthe take
They hold it sykerlyche won
And thus the law is overcome
Which god has set / and namely
With hem that so vntrewe^y
The gods rob of holy church
The theft which they than wyrch^
By name is cleped sacrylege
Ayene whom I think allege
Of his condition to tell
Which rifeleth both book and belle
So forth with all the remenaunt
To gods hows appertynaunt
Where that he should ^ydd^ his bid
He does his theft in holy stead
And takes what he fynt therein
For when he sees that he may wyn
He wendeth for no cursidnesse
That he ne briketh the holiness
And does to god no reverence
For he has lose his conscience
That though the pressed therefore to corse
He seyth he fares not the worse
And for to speak it otherwise
That man that lasseth the fraunchyse
And takes of holy church his pray
I note what bedes he shall pray
When he from god the which has give all The propirte in special
Which unto Crist him self is due
Bynemeth / he may not well eschew
The pain coming afterward
For he has made his forward
With sacryl^ge for to dwell
Which has his heritage in hell
And if we read of the old law
I find write in thylke dawe
Of princes there were three
Comparable al in this degree
And one of hem was cleped thus
The proud king Antyochus
That other Nabuzardon hight
Which enforced with all his might
The temple for to destroy and waste
And so ^e did in all have
The third which was after shamed
Was Nabogo donoser named
And he Jerusalem put under
Of sacrylege and many a wonder
There in the holy Temple he wrought
Wiche Balthazar his heir abought
When mane techel Phares wryt
Was on the wall as thou myt wit
^o as the bible has declared
But for all that ^t is not spared
Yet now a day that men it pylle
And maken argument and skylle
To sacrylege as it belongs
For what man that thereafter longs
He takes no head what he does
And right so for to tell sooth
An loves cause if I shall trete
There ben of such small and great
If they no leyser find else
They will not leten for the belles
Ne though they see the priest at mass
That wol they leten ouerpasse
If that they fond her love there
They stand and tell in her ere
And ask of god none other grace
While that they ben in holy place
But or they go sum ananntage
There will they have and some pyllage
Of goodly words and of byheste
Or else they take at the lest
Out of her hond a ryng or glove
So nyhe the weder they will shoue
And as she said she shall not forgete
Now I this token of her can get
Thus halowe they the hye feste
Such theft may no church areste
For all is leful that hem lyketh
To whom that else it myslyketh
And eke right in the self kind
In great Cytees men may find
This lusty folk that make hem gay
And wait upon the holy day
In chirches and in mynstres eke
They gone the women for to seek
And where that such one gooth about
To sore the fairest of all the route
Where as they sytten al a rewe
There will he his body most show
His crooked keyned and thereon set
An ouche with a chapelet
Which late come out of the greues
Or else one of the grene leaves
And all for he should seem fresshe
And thus he looks on the flesh
Right as an hawk which has a sit
Upon the foul where he shall light
And as he were a fayrye
He she weth him to fore her ^ye
(...) holy place where they sytte
Al for to make her hertes flytte
His eye nowhere wol abide
But look and pry on every side
On here and her as him hest lyketh
And otherwhyle among he syketh
Thinks of hem that was for me
And so there thynken two or three
And yet he loves none at all
But where as ever his chance fall
And netheles to sey soothe
The cause why he so does
Is for to stele an heart or two
Ouce of the Church or that he go
And as I said it here above
It is a sacrylege of love
For well may be that he steleth away
That he never after yield may
Tell me for thy my sone anon
Have thou do sacrylege or none
As I have said in this manner
My fader as of this matere
I will you tell redyly
What I have do bnt truly
I may excuse mine intent
That I never to church went
In such manner as ye me shryue
For no man that is on live
The cause why I have it last
May be / for I unto that craft
Am no thing able for to stele
Though there were never so feel
Bnt yet will I not sey this
When I am there my lady is
In whom lies holy my quarelle
And she to church or to Chappelle
Goo to matens or to mass
That time I wait well and pass
To church I come and there I stand
And though I take a look in hond^
My contenannce is on the look
Bnt toward her is al my look
And if so fall that I pray
Unto my god and somewhat say
Of pater noster and of Creed
Al is for that I would speed
So that my bid in holy church
There might sum miracle wirche
My lady berte for to change
Which ever to me has be strange
So that all my devotion
And al mine contemplacion
With all my heart and my courage
Is only set on her image
And ever I wait upon the tide
If she look any thing a side
That I me may on her auyse
Anon I am with Couetyse
So smyt^ that me were leef
To be in holy church a thief
But not to stele a vestyment
For that is no thing my talent
But I would stele if that I might
A glad word or a goodly sight
And ever my service I profere
And namely when she goth offer
For her I led then if that I may
For somewhat would I stele away
When I beclyppe her on the wast
Yet at the last I stele a taste
And other while grant mercy
She seith* and so win I thereby
A lusty touch a good word eke
But all the remenannt to seek
Is fro my purpoos wonder far
So may I say as I said err
In holy church if that I wowe
My conscience yet would I allow
Be so that upon amendment
I might get assignement
Wherefore I speed in other place
Such sacrylege I hold a grace
And thus my fader sooth to sey
In church right as in the wey
If I might ought of love take
Such hansell have I not forsake
But finally I me confess
There is in me no holiness
While I her see in any stead
And yet for onght that ever I deed
No sacrylege of her I took
But as it were a word or look
Or else if that I herd frede
When I toward offryng her led
Take thereof what I take may
For else ^ere I naught away
For though I would ought ^ls have
At other things ben so save
And kept with such a pryuelege
That I may do no sacrylege
God wot my will netheles
Though I must needs keep pees
And in all gree sone mine let it pass
My will thereto is not the less
For I might otherwise awey
For thy my fader I you prey
Tell what thou thynkest thereupon
If I thereof have gylt or none
Thy will my sone is for to blame
The remenaunt is but a game
That I have the told as yet
But take this lere in to thy wit
That all thing has time and stead
The which serves for the bid
^^e Chamber is of another speech
But if thou wystest of the wreche
How sacrylege it has abought
T^ow sholdest use it right naught
And for thou shall the more amend
A tale on the I wol dispende
Hic in amoris causa super istius vi (...) articulo ponit exemplum Et narrat
pro ^o quod paris pr^ami Regis filius ^^^^nam menelai vxorem in quada^ g^^at
Insula a templo veneris sacrile ^^s abduxit / illa Troy famosissima ^^sidie

sacrilegium non solum ad ipsius Regis patriam omnium az suoru^ interitum / Sed
ad perpetuam vrbis de solacionem vindicem fomitem ministrabat

tO al men as who says know
It is and in ye world thoru blow
How that of Troy lamedon
To Hercules and to Iasen
When toward Colchos out of gr^^^
By see seylyng upon a piece
Of land of Troy rest preyde
But he wrongfully conueyde
And for they found him so vyleyne
When they came in to greece again
With power that they get might
Toward Troy they have hem dyght
And they took such vengeance
Whereof stant yet in remembrance
For they destroyed king and all
And leften but the brent wall
The greeks of Troyes many slow
And prisoners they took ynowe
Among the which there was one
The kings daughter lamedone
Esyona the fair thing
Which unto the lamon the king
By Hercules and by the assent
Of all the hole parliament
Was at his will give and granted
And thus has great Troy dannted
And him to torn in such manner
But after this now shall thou here
The cause why the tale I tell
Upon the chances that bifelle
King lamedon which dyed thus
He had a sone one priamus
Which was not thylke time at home
But when he herd of this he come
And fond how the Cite was fall
Which he bygan upon the wall
And made there a Cite new
That they which other lands knew
Tho se^den that of lyme and stone
In all the world so fair was none
And on that one side of the town
The king let make ylyowne
That hye toure that strong place
Which was adrad of no manace
Of quarrel none nor of engyne
And though men would make a mine
No man's craft it might approach
For it was set upon a roche
The walls of the Town about
Hem stood of all the world no doubt
And after the proporcyon
Syx gates were there of the town
Of such inform / of such entayle
That hem to see was great meruayl^
The dyches were broad and deep
And few men it might keep
From all the world as seems tho
But if the gods weren foo
Great prees unto that Cite drowe
So that there was of people ynowe
Of burgeys that therein dwellen
There may no man's tongue tellen
How that Cite was rich of good
When all was made and all well stood
King Pry^mus tho him bethought
What they of greece whylome wrought
And what was of her swerd devoured
And how his suster dishououred
With thelamon awey was ladde
And he thynkyng he wex vnglad
And set anon a parliament
To which the lords were assent
In many a wise there was spoke
How that they myghten ben awroke
But at the last netheles
They seid al acord and pees
To setten either party in rest
It thought hem al for the best
With reasonable amendment
And thus was Anthenor forth sent
To ask Esyona again
And wit what they would seyne
So passes he the sea by barge
To greece for to sey his charge
The which he said redyly
Unto the lords by and by
But where he spak in greece about
He herd not but words stout
And namelyche of Thelamon
The maiden would he not for gone
He said for no manner thing
And bad him gone home to his king
For there gate he none amend
For ought he couthe do or send
This Anthenor ayene goth home
Unto his king / and when he come
He told in greece what that he herd
And how that thelamon answered
And how they were at her above
That they wol neither pees ne love
But every man shall done his best
But for men seyen that night has rest
The king bythought him all ye nyt
And erly when the day was light
He took his counceyll of this matere
And they acord in this manner
That he withouten any let
A certain time should set
A parliament to ben auysed
And in this wise it was anysed
Of parliament he set a day
And that was in the month of may
This priamus had in his sight
A wife and Hecuba she hight
By whom that time she and he
Sons five had and daughters three
Beside two and thyrty mo
And weren knights al tho
But not upon his wit bygete
But else where he might hem get:
Of which he had know
Such was the world that ylk throw
And so he was of children rich
And thereof was no man him lyche
Of parliament the day was come
There ben the lords al and some
Tho was prouounced and purposed
And all the cause hem was disclosed
How Anthenor in greece ferde
They sytten ay stylle and herd
And tho spak every man about
There was alleged many a doubt
And many a proud word spoke also
But for the most party as tho
They wysten not what was the best
Or for to werre or for to rest
But he that was without fere
Hector among the lords there
His tale told in such a wise
And said lords ye ben wise
Ye known this as well as I
Above al other most worthy
Stant now in great manhood
Of worthynes and of knyghthode
For who so will it well agrope
To hem bylongeth al Europe
Which is the third part even
Of all the world under the heaven
And we be but folk a few
So were it reason to eschew
The peril or we fall therein
Better is to leave than to bygyn
Thing which may not be acheued
He is not wise that find him grieved
And does so that his grieve be more
For who that looks all to fore
And will not see what is behind
He may full often his harms find
Wyck is to strif and have the worse
We have encheson for to corse
This wot I well / and for to hate
The greeks / but or we debate
With hem that been of such a might
It is full good that every wight
Be of him self right well bythought
But as for me thus sey I naught
For while that my life may stand
If that ye taken werre in hand
Fall it to the best or to the werst
I shall my seluen be the ferst
To grieve hem what ever I may
I stylle not ones say nay
To thing which yt your cou^ceil demeth
For unto me more well it quemeth
The werre certes than the pees
But this I say netheles
As me belongs for to say
Now shape ye the best way
When Hector had said his deuyse
Next after him tho spak paryse
Which was his brother and alyed
When him best thought thus he seid
Strong thing it is to suffer wrong
And suffer shame is more strong
But we have suffered both the two
And for all that yet have we do
What so we might to reform
This wrong and shame in better form
Sent Anthenor as ye well know
And they her great words blow
Upon her wrongful deeds eke
And who that wol not him self meke
To pees and list no reason take
Men seyn Reason will him forsake
For in the multitude of men
Is not the strength / for with ten
It has be seen in true quarele
Ayene an honderd haluendele
And has the better by gods grace
Thus has befalle in many place
And if it like unto you all
I will assay how so it bifalle
Our enemy if I may grieve
For I have caught a great believe
Upon a pleyne point I wol declare
This yonder day as I began fare
To hunte unto the great heart
Which was to fore my hounds sterte
And every man went on his side
Him to pursewe and I to ride
Bigan to chase / and sooth to say
Within a while out of my way
I rode / and nyst where I was
And slope me caught and on the grass
Beside a well I leyd me down
To sleep and in a vysyoun
To me the god Mercurye came
Goddesses three with him he name
Mynerue Venus and Juno
And in his hond an Appel tho
He held of gold with lettres write
And thus he did me to wit
How that they put hem upon me
That to the fairest of hem three
Of gold that Appel should I give
With each of hem I was shryue
And echone fair me behyght
But Venus said if that she might
That Appel of my gift get
She would it neuermore forgete
And said how that in greece land
She would bring in to my hand
Of all this earth the fairest
So that me thought it for the best
To her and yaf that appel tho
Thus hope I well if that I goo
But she for me will so ordeyne
That they matere for to pleyne
Shall have or that I come again
Now have ye herd that I would seyne
Say ye what stont in your auyse
And every man tho said his
And sundry causes they record
But at the last they acorde
That paris shall to greece wend
And thus the parliament took an end
Cassandre when she herd of this
The which to paris suster is
Anon she began to weep and wayle
And said alas what may us ayle
Fortune with her blind whele
Ne will not let us stand well
For this I dare well undertake
That if paris his wey take
As it is seid that he shall do
We ben ever than fordoo
This maiden Cassandre hight
In all the world as it bears sight
In books as men find write
Is that Sybell of whom ye wit
That al men yet clepen sage
When that she wist of this vyage
How Paris should to greece fare
No woman might werse fare
Ne sorrow more than she did
And right so in the same stead
Ferd Helenus which was her brother
Of prophecy / and such another
And al was hold but a iape
So that purpoos which was shape
Or were hem leef or were hem loathe
Was hold / and in to greece goth
This paris with his retenaunce
And as it fell upon his chance
Of greece he londeth in an isle
And him was told that same while
Of folk which he began to freyne
Tho was in that isle queen Eleyne
And eke of countrees there about
Of ladies many a lufty rowte
With mochel worthy people also
And why they comen thedertho
The cause stood in such a wise
For worship and for sacryfyse
That they to Venus would make
As they to fore had undertake
Some of good will and some of biheste
For than was her hyhe feste
Within a Temple which was there
When paris wist what they were
Anon he shope his ordinance
To gone te done his obeysaunce
To Venus on her holy day
And did upon his best array
With great richesse he him behongeth
As it to such a lord longs
He was not armed netheles
But as it were in land of pees
And thus he gothe out of ship
And takes with him his felauship
In such manner as I you say
Unto the temple he hold his way
Tydyng which gothe oueral
To great and small forth with all
Come to the queen's ere and told
How paris come and that he would
Do sacryfyce unto Venus
And when she herd tell thus
She thought how that ever it be
That she will him abide and see
Forth comes paris with glad vysage
In to the temple on pylgremage
Where unto Venus the goddess
He yeueth and offreth great richesse
And prays her that he pray would
On that other side he began behold
And see where this lady stood
And forth in his fresshe mode
Goth where she was and made her chere
As he well couthe in his manner
That of his worlds such plesaunce
She took that al her acquaintance
As ferforth as the heart lay
He stale or that he went away
So goth he forth and took his leave
And thought anon as it was eve
He would done his sacrylege
That many a man shall abyge
When he ayene to ship was come
To him he has his counceyll nome
And all devised the matere
In such a wise as thou shall here
Within night al pryuely
His men he warns by and by
That they be armed ready soon
For certain thing which was to done
And they anon be ready all
And each on other began call
And went hem out upon the stronde
And took her purpoos there on land
Of what thing they would do
Toward the temple / and forth there go
So fyl it that of devotion
Heleyn in contemplaaon
With many another worthy wight
Was in the temple and woke al night
To bid and pray to the image
Of venus as was than usage
So that paris right as him list
In to the temple or they wyste
Came with his men al suddenly
And al at ones set a skrye
On hem which in the temple were
Fr tho was much people there
Bnt of defense was no bote
So suffer they that suffer mote
Paris unto the queen went
And her in both his arms hent
With him and with his felauship
And forth they bear her in to ship
Up goth the sail / and forth they went
And such a wynd fortune hem sent
Till they the haven of Troy caught
Where out of ship / anon they straut
And gone hem forth toward the town
The which came with procession
Ayene Paris to seen his pray
And every man began to say
To paris and to his felauship
All that they couthen of worship
Was none so little man in Troy
That he ne made myrthe and joy
Of that Paris had wonnen Eleyn
But all that night is sorrow and peyn
To Helenus and to Cassandre
For they it token shame and sklaundre
And loss of all the common grace
That Paris out of holy place
By stelthe has take a man's wife
Whereof he shall lose his life
And many a worthy man thereto
And the Cite before do
Which never shall be made ayene
And so it fell right as they seyne
The sacrylege which he wrought
Was cause why the greeks sought
Unto the town. and it belay
And wolden never part away
Till what by sleyght and what by strength
They had it wonnen in bread and length
And brent and slain that was therein
Now so my sone such a syn
Is sacrylege in holy stead
Beware therefore / and bid thy bid
And do no thing in holy church
But that thou might by reason wyrche
And eke take heed of Achilles
When he unto his love chees
Polixena that was also
In holy temple of Appollo
Which was the cause that he dyede
And al his lust was leyd aside
And Troylus upon Creseyde
Also his first love leyde
In holy place and how he ferde
As who seyth all the world it herd
Forsake he was for Dyomede
Such was of lust his last mede
For thy my sone I would read
By this ensample as thou might read
Seche else where thou wylt thy grace
And ware the well in holy place
What thou to love do or speak
In aunter if it be so wreke
As ^^ou have herd me tell to fore
And take good head also therefore
Upon what form of Anaryce
More than of any other vice
I have divided in parties
The branches which of companyes
Through out the world in general
Like as ye now here shall
Of Couetyse and periurye
Of falls brocage and of vsurye
Of scarcenes and vnkyndeship
Which never drough to felouship
Of Robbery and of pryue stelthe
Which done is for the worlds wealth
Of Rauyn and of sacrylege
Which take the conscience of a grege
Al though it may richesse atteyne
It floureth / bnt it shall not greyne
Unto the sweet of rightwysenesse
But who that would do largess
Upon the reule as it is give
So might a man with thought leave
Toward his god / and eke also
Toward the world / for by the two
Largess a wayteth as belongs
To neither part that he wrongeth
He keeps him self and keeps his friends
So stonte he sauf to both his ends
In such wise that he be sure
That he excedeth no mesure
Whereof my sone thou shall wit
So as Philosophre has write
Prodegus et parcus duo sunt extrema quam largus / Est horam medins pl^ ^^s in
ore bonus

Nota hic de virtute largitatis que ad oppositum auoricie inter duo extrema
videlicet percimoniam et prodegalitem specialiter consistit /

^E(...)ix the two extremytres
Of vice stont the propyrtees
Of v^rtu and to pr^ue it so
Take auaryce and take also
The vice of prodegalyte
Betwix hem lyberalyte
Which is the virtue of largess
Stant and governs his noblesse
For tho two vices in discord
Stant ever as I find of record
So that bitwene debate
Largess rules his estate
For in such wise as Auaryce
As I to fore have told the vice
Thorugh streyte holdyng and scarsenesse
Stant in contrary to largess
Right so prodegalyte
Reuers but not in such degree
For so as Auaryce spares
And for to keep his tresoure cares
That other al his own and more
Ayene the wysemans lore
Yeueth and dispendeth here and there
So that him retcheth never where
While he may borugh he wol dispende
Til at the last he seith I wend
But that is spoken al to late
For than is pouerte at the yate
And takes him even by the sleue
For ^rst will he no wysedom leave
And right as auaryce is sin
That would his tresoure keep and win
Right so yonre prodegalyte
But of largess in his degree
Which even stant bitwene the two
The high god and the man also
The virtue each of hem commends
For he him seluen first amendeth
That over al his name spredeth
And to al other where it needs
He yaf his good in such a wise
That he makes many a man rise
Which else should fall low
Largess may not be unknow
For what land he regneth in
It may not ^ayle for to win
Of his deserte love and grace
Where it shall fail in other place
And thus bitwene to much and lyte
Larges^e which is not to wit
Holds ever forth the myddel way
But who that wol torn a way
Fro that to prodegalyte
Anon he leueth the propyrte
Of virtue / and goth to the vice
For in such wise as Auaryce
Left for scarsenes his good name
R^g^t so that other is to blame
Which ^^^rgh his wast mesure excedeth
For no man wot what harm it bedeth
But mochel joy there leueth
Where that largeness an heart gydeth
For ^^o m^sur^ is so governed
^^^t he to be the par^y^s is learned
To god and to the world also
He does Reason to both the two
The pour folk of his alms
Releued ben in distress
Of thurst / of honger and of cold
The yeft of him was never sold
But freely give and netheles
The mighty god of his encrces
Reward him of double grace
The ^^uen ^e does him to purchase
And yeueth him eke ye worldis good
And thus the cete for the hoode
^orgesse takes / and yet no sin
^^ ^^th bow so that ever he win
What man has horse men give horse
And who none has / of him no for^
For he may than on foot goo
The world has ever stond so
But for to loken of the twey
A man to go the syker wey
Better is to give than to take
With yeft a man may friends make
But who yt takes outher great or small
He takes a charge forth with all
And stant not fre till it be quyte
So for to deem in man's wit
It helps more a man to have
His own good for to crave
Of other men / and make him bond
Where else he may stand vnbonde
Seneca / Si res tue tibi non sufficient fac vt rebus tuis sufficias

Seneca counceyled in this wise
And seyth but if thy good suffyce
Unto the lykyng of thy will
Withdraw thy lust and hold the stylle
And be to thy good suffysaunt
For that thing is appertynaunt
To truth and causes to be fre
After the rule of charity
Which first begins of him self
For thou richest other twelf
Whereof thou shall thy self be pouer
I not what thonk thou might recoue^
While that a man has good to ye^e
With great rentes he may leave
And has his friends oneral
And eueryche of hem tell shall
The which he has his full pak
They say a good felawe is Jack
And when it foyleth at the last
Anon his price they ouercast
For than is there none other law
But Iak was a good felawe
When they him pour and nedy se^
They let him pass and fare well he
All that he wend of company
Is than turned to folly
But now to speak in other kind
Of love a man may such find
That where they come in every row^^
They cast and wast her love about
Till all her time is ouergone
And than have they love none
For who that loves oueral
It is no reason that he shall
Of love have any propyr^e
For thy my sone auyse the
If thou of love have ben to large
For such a man is not to charge
And if so be that thou have
Dyspended al thy time in wast
And set thy love in sundry place
Though thou the substance of thy grace
Lose at the last it is no wonder
For he that put him seluen under
As who says common over all
He leseth the love specialle
Of any one if she be wise
For love shall not bear the pryse
By reason when it passes one
So have I seen many one
That were of love well at ese
Which after fell in great dysese
Thorugh wast of love that they spent
In sundry places where they went
Right so my sone I ask of the
If thou with prodegalyte
Have here or there thy love wasted
My fader nay / but I have tasted
In many a place where I have goo
And yet love I never one of tho
But for to drive forth the day
For leueth well my heart is ay
Withouten mo for evermore
All upon one for I no more
Desire but her love allone
So make I many a pryue moan
For well I feel I have dispended
My long love and not amended
My speed for ought I find yet
If this be wast to your wit
Of love and prodegalyte
Now good fader demeth ye
But of one thing I will me shr^^^
That I shall for no love thryue
But if her self will me releue
My sone that may well I leave
And netheles me seems so
For ought that thou bast yet mysdo
Of time which thou have myspendyd
It may with grace be amendyd
For thing which may be worth the co^^
Per chance is newther wast ne lo^^
^^^ what thing stont in adventure
That can no worlds creature
Tell in certain how it shall end
Till he there of may see an end
So that I note as yet therefore
If thou my son have won or lore
For oftyme as it is seen
When somer has lost al his grene
And is with winter wast and bare
That him is left no thing to spare
Al is recouerd in a throw
The cold winter is over blow
And still ben the sharp showers
And suddenly against his flowers
The somer happens and is rich
And so per caas thy grace lyche
My sone though thou be now pouer
Of love yet thou might recover
My fader certes grant mercy
Ye have me taught so redyly
That ever while I live shall
The better I may beware with all
Of thing which ye have said or this
But evermore how that it is
Toward my shryft as it belongs
To wit of other points me longs
Whereof that ye me wolden teache
With all my heart I you byseche

tHe great sin orygenal / Which every man in gouernal / Upon his birth has

When Adam of thylk Appel bote
His sweet morcelle was so hot
Which dedely made the kind
In the books as I find
This vice which so out of rule
Has set us al is cleped gule
Of the which the branches ben so great
That of hem all I wol not irete
But only as touching to two
I think to speak of no mo
Whereof the first is dronkeship
Which bears the cup felauship
Full many a wonder does that vice
He can of a wyseman make a nyce
And of a fool that him shall seem
That he can all the law deem
And give every Judgment
Which longs to the fyrmament
Both of the sterre^ and of the moon
And* thus^ makes a great clerk soon
Of him that is a lewd man
There is no thing that he ne can
While he has dronkeship on hand
He knows the sea / he knows ye lord
He is a noble man of arms
And yet no strength is in his arms
There he was strong ynowe to fore
With dronkeship it is forlore
And al is changed his estate
And wexeth anon so feeble and ma^e
That he may nether go ne come
But al to geder he is benome
The power both of hand and foot
So that algate abide he mote
And al his wits be foryete
The which is to him such a let
That he note never what he does
Ne which is false / ne which is sooth
Ne which is day ne which is night
And for ye time he knows no wit
That he ne wot so much as this
What manner thing him seluen is
Or he be man or he be best
That hold I right a sorry fest
When he that Reason understood
So sodenlyche he is wexe wood
Or else lyche the deed man
Which another go ne speak can
Thus often he is to bed brought
And where he lies he reteheth naught
Till he arise upon the mow we
And than he seith / O which a sorrow
It is a man to be drynkeles
So that half drunk in such a rees
With dry mouth he stert him up
He says bail sa the cup
That made him lose his wit again
Is than a morrow al be leyne
The cup is all that ever him pleseth
And also that most him dyseseth
It is the cup whom he serves
Which al care from him herueth
And al balys to him brings
In joy wepeth / in soro we he syngeth
It may no while stont in verse
For dronkenshyp is so diverse
He drynketh the wyn / but at the last
The wyn drynketh him and bynt him
Fast / And leyth him dronke by ye wall
As him which is his bond thrall^
And al in his subjection
And lyche to such condycyon
As for to speak it otherwise
It falls that the most wise
B^n other while of love adoted
And so bywhapped and assoted
O^ dronken men / and never yet
Was none which half so lost his wytt
Of drink as they of such things do
Which cleped the ^olyf woe
And wexen of her own thought
So dr^nk that they ne knew naught
What reason is more or less
Such is the kind of that sykenesse
And that is not for lack of brain
But love is so great a main
That where he takes a heart on hand
There may no thing his myt withsto^d
With which Salamon was nome
And strong Sampson overcome
The knyghtly Dauyd him ne might
Rescue that he with the sight
Of Bersabe ne was bestad
^yrgyly also was ouerlad
And Aristotiles was put under
For thy my sone it is no wonder
If thou he drunk of love among
Which is above al other strong
And if so is that thou so be
Tell me thy shryft in prynyte
It is no shame of such a thewe
A young man to be dronkelewe
Of such Phisyk as I can a part
And as me seems in that art
Thou sholdest by phisonomye
Be shapen to that melodye
Of louedronke / and that is routhe
A holy fader that is truth
That ye me tell I am beknowe
That I with love am so bythrowe
And al my heart is so thorugh sonkr
That I am verylyche drunk
And yet I may both speak and goo
But I overcome so
And turned fro my self so clean
That often I wot not what I mean
So that excusen I ne may
My heart fro the first day
That I am to my lady hythe
I was never yet sobre sithe
Where I her see or see her not
With musyng of my thought
Of love which my heart assayleth
So dronk that my heart fails
And all my brain is ouertorned
And my manner so my^torned
That I foryete all that I can
And stand like a mased man
That often when I would play
It makes me draw out of the way
In soleyn place by my self
As does a laborer to delf
Which can no gentylmans chere
Or else as a lewd friar
When he is put to his penance
Right so lose I my contenaunce
And if it needs so vetyde
That I in company abide
Where as I must dance and sing
The houe dance and carolynge
Or for to goo the new foot
I may not well heue up my foot
If that she be not in the way
For than is al myrthe away
And weye anon of thought so full
Whereof my lymmes ben so dull
I may uneaths goo a pas
For thns it is / and ever hit was
When I on such thoughts muse
The lust and mirth that men use
When I see not my lady byme
Al is foryete for the time
So ferforth that my wits chaungen
And al lusts fro me straungen
That they seyn al truly
And swore that I am not I
For as the man which often drynketh
The wyn that in his stomach synketh
Wexeth drunk and wytles for a throw
Right so my lust is overthrow
And of mine own thought so mate
I wexe / that to mine estate
There is no lyme will me ser^e
But as a dronk man I swerue
And suffer such a passion
That men have great compassyon
And eueriche by him self merueyleth
What thing it is what one eyleth
Such is the manner of my woe
Which time that I am hurt so
T^l efte again that I her see
But than it were a nycete
To tell you how that I fare
For when I may upon her stare
Her woman he de her gentylnesse
My heart is full of such gladness
That ouerpasseth so my wit
That I wot nowhere where it sit
But am so dronken of that sight
Me thinks that for the time I myt
Right streyte thorugh the hole wall
And than I may well if I shall
Both sing and dance and lepe about
And hold forth the lusty rowte
But netheles it falls so
Full often that I fro her gos
Ne may but as it were a stake
I stand auysement to take
And look upon her fair face
That for the while out of the place
For all the world ne might I wen^e
Such lust comes than to my mind
So that without mete and drink
Of lusts thoughts which I think
Me thinks I might stand ever
And so it were to me lever
Than such a sight for to leave
For well is me that I have leave
To have so mochel of my will
And thus thynkyng I stond stylle
Without blemysshyng of mine eye
Right as me thought that I sye
Of paradys the most joy
And so there while I me reioy^
In to my heart a great desire
The which is hoter than the fire
Al sodenlyche upon me renneth
That all my thought within brenneth
And am so ferforth overcome
That I note where I am bycome
So that among the hertes strong
Instead of drink I vnderfonge
A thought so sweet in my courage
That never pyement ne vernage
Was half so sweet for to daynke
For as I would than I think
As though I were at mine above
For so thorugh drunk I am of love
That all that my soty demeth
Is soothe as than it to me seems
And while I may the thoughtrs keep
Me thinks as though I were a sleep
And that I were in gods barme
But when I see mine own harm
And that I sodenlyche awake
Out of my thought and head take
How that the sooth stant in deed
Than is my sykernes in dread
And joy torneth in to woo
So that the hete is al ago
Of such soty as I was ynne
And than Inward I begin
To take of love a new thurst
Which me greueth all there worst
For than comes the blanch Fever
With chele and make me to cheuer
And so it coldeth at my heart
That wonder is how I asterte
In such a point that I ne deye
For certes there was never keye
Ne frosen is upon the wall
More Inly cold than I am all
And thus I suffer the hot chele
Which passes other points feel
In Cold I brenne and feese in hete
And than I drynk a bitter sweet
With dry lyppe and eyes wete
Loo thus I tempre my dyete
And take a draught of such relees
That al my wit is herteles
And al my heart therein sit
Is as who says without wit
So that I preue it by reason
In making of comparyson
There may no difference be
Bytwyx a drunk man and me
But all the werst of euerychone
Is ever that I thurst in one
The more that my heart drynketh
The more I may so me thinks
My thurst shall never be acqueynte
God sheld that I be not dreynte
Of such a superfluyte
For well I feel in my degree
That al my wit is ouercast
Whereof I am the more aghast
That in defante of ladyship
Per chance in such a dronkeship
I may be cede or I beware
For certes fader this I dare
Beknowe and in my thyrst tell
But I a draught have of a well
In which my death is and my life
My joy is turned in to staf
That sobre shall I never worth
But as a dronken man for worth
So that in land where I fare
The lust is lore of my welfare
As he that may no bote find
But this me thinks a wonder kind
As I am dronk of that I drynk
Of these thoughts that I think
Of which I find no relees
But if I might netheles
Of such a drink as I coueyte
So as me lust have one receyte
I should assobre and fare well
But so fortune upon her whele
On he me deyneth not to set
For evermore I find a let
The botyler is not my friend
Which has the key by the bend
I may wysshe and that I waste
For well I wot so fresshe a taste
But if my grace be the more
I shall assay neuermore
Thus am I drunk of that I see
Forcastyng is forfendyd me
And I can not my seluen staunche
So that my fader of this branch
I am gytlyf to tell truth
My sone that me thinks routhe
For love drunk is the meschyef
Above all other the most chyef
If he no lusty thought assay
Which may his sorry thurst alay
As for the time that it lesseth
To him which other joy mysseth
For thy my sone above all
Think well how so it befalle
And keep the wits that thou have
And late hem not be drunk in wast
But netheles there is no wight
That may withstonde loves might
But why the cause is as I find
But that there is diverse kind
Of love drunk why men pleyneth
After the Country which al ordeyneth
I will the tell the manner
Now list my sone / and thou shall here
Hic narrat secundu^ poetam qualiter in suo cellario duo dolia jubiter hci bet
/ quorum primum liquoris dulassimum / secundum amarissimum plenu^ consistit /
ita quod ille cui portata est pro spenta^ de dula potabit / Alter bero cui
adnersabitur poculum gustabit amarum

fOr the fortune of every chance
A f^r the gods purueaunce
To man it grows from above
So that the speed of every love
Is shape there or it befalle
For (...)er abouen all
Which is of gods soueraynt
Has in his seller as men saint
Two tonnes full of love drink
That makes many a heart synke
And many an heart also to flete
Or of the four or of the sweet
That one is full of such pyement
Which passes al entendement
Of any man if he it taste
And makes a ioylyf heart in have
That other bitter as the galle
Which makes a man's heart palle
Whoos dronkeship is a sykenesse
Thorugh felyng of the bytternesse
Cupyde is boty^^r of both
Which to the leefe and to the loathe
Yeueth of the sweet and of the sour
That sum laugh and sum loure
But for so much as he blind is
Full oftyme be aoth amys
And (...) the badde for the good^
Which hyndreth many man's fode
Without cause and fortheteth eke
So ben there of love sum seek
Which ought of reason to ben hole
And sum comen to the dole
In ^^^e and as hem self list
(...)ynke vndeserueth of the best
And thus this blind botiler
To such as comen there
Yeueth of the swetee instead of truble
L^ how he can the hertes trouble
And makes drunk al upon chance
Without law or governance
I^ he draw of the sweet tonne
Then is the sorrow al overcome
Of love drink and shall not grieve
So to the drunk every eve
For alis than but a game
But when it is not for the same
And he the bitter tonne draws
Such dronkeshyp an heart gnaweth
And febleth al a man's thought
That better him were have dro^k nout
And of his bread have eten dry
For than he leseth his lusty wey
With dronkeship and wot not whyder
To go the weyes ben so slyder
In which he may par caas so fall
That he shall break his wits all
And in this wise men ben drunk
After the drynk that they have dronke
But all men drink not y like
For sum shall sing and some shall sike
So that it me no thing merueyleth
My sone of love that the assayleth
For ^^^el know by thy tale
That thou have drunk of the dwale
Which bitter is / til god the send
Such grace that thou might amend
But sone thou shall bydde and pray
In such wise as I shall say
That thou thy lust well atteyne
Thy woeful thurstes to restreyne
Of love and may the sweetness
As Bachus did in his distress
When bodeliche thurst him hent
In strange lands where he went
Nota hic qualiter potus allquando scicienti precibus adquiritur / Et narrat
Exe^plum quod cum Bachus de quodam bello ad Orientem repatrians in quibusdam
libie partibus alicuius generis potum non inuenit / fusis ad ^ouem precibus
a^^aruit / and sic potum pe tenti peticio preualuit

tHis Bachus sone of ^ubiter
Was hot / and as he went fer
By his faders assignement
To make a werre in the Oryent
And great power with him he ladde
So that the hyher hond he had
And vyctorye of his enemy
And torneth homethard with his prys
In such a Country which was dreye
A meschyef fell upon the weye
As he rode with his company
Nygh to the strondes of lumbardye
There might they no drynk find
Of water ne of other kind
So that him self and al his host
Were for defaute of drynk almost
Destwyed* and than bachus prayed
To Iubiter* and thus he said
O high fader that see all
To whom is reason that I shall
Byseche and pray in every need
Byhold my fader and take heed
This woeful thurst that we ben ynne
To stau^che and grant us for to win
And sauf unto the Country fare
Where that our lusty loves are
Waytyng upon our home coming
And with the voice of his prayng
Which herd was to the gods heye
He saw anon to fore his eye
A wether which ye ground has spurned.
And where he has it ouerturned
There sprung a well fresshe and cleve
Whereof his own ^otylere
After the lusts of his will
Yaue every man to drynk his fylle
And for this ylke great grace
Forth with in the same place
A rich temple let he arere
Which ever shall sto^de there
To thursty men in remembrance
For thy my sone after thy chance
It sit the well to take heed
So for to pray upon the need
As Bachus prayed for the well
And thynk as thou have herd me (...)
How grace he grad and grace he had^^
He was no fool that first so radde
For ^elden get a domme man land
Take that proverb and understand
That words ben of virtues great
(...) thy to speak thou ne let
To ask and pray erly and late
Thy thurst to quench and thynk algate
The ^otyler which bears the keye
As blind as thou herest me seye
And if it might so betyde
That he upon the blind side
^er caas the sweet tonne raught
Than shall thou have a sweet draught
And wexe of love drunk sobre
And thus I read thou assobre
Thyn heart in hope of such a grace
For dronkeship in every place
To whether side that it torn
Does harm and make a man to sporne
And fall of in such a wise
Where he per caas may not arise
Hic de amoris ebrietate ponit exemplum qualiter ^ristrans ad potum que
Brangweyne in manu ei porrexit de a more bello Isolde inebriatus extitit

aNd for to look in euydence
Upon the sooth in experyence
So as it has befalle or this
In every man's mouth it is
How ^rystram was of love drunk
With Beal Isawde when they drunk
The drynk which Brangueyn him
bytoke / Er ye king Mark his eme her
took / To wife as it was after know
And eke my sone if thou wylt know
As it has fallen evermore
In lones cause and what is more
Of dronkeshyp before to dread
As it whysome befelle in deed
Whereof thou might the better eschew
Of dronken men that thou sewe
The company in no manner
A great e^sample thou shall here

tHis find I write in poe^ye
Of thylk fair Ipotasye
Of whoos beauty there as she
Was / Spoke every man and fell per cas
That Pyrotheus so him spedde
That he to wife her should wedde
Whereof that he great joy made
And for he would his love glade
Again the day of marriage
By mouth both and by message
His friends to the fest he praid
With great worship and al men said
He has this young lady spoused
And when yt they were al day honsed
And set and served at mete
There was no wyn which may begete
That there ne was plente enough
But Bachus thylke tonne drough
Whereof by way of dronkeship
The gretest of the felauship
Were out of reason overtake
And Venus which also has take
The cause most in special
Has give hem drynk forth with all
Of thylke cup which exciteth
The lust wherein a man delyteth
And thus by double wey drunk
Of lust that ylk ^yry fonke
Has made hem as who seith half wod^
That they no reason understood
Ne to none other thing they seyen
But her which to fore her exen
Was wedded thylk same day
That fresshe wife that lusty may
On ^ir it was all that they thoughte^^
And so ferforth his lusstes sough^^^
That they which named were
Centauri at the feste there
Of one assent / of one acord
This young wife maugre her lord
In such a rage forth ladden
As they none insight hadden
But only to her dronken fare
Which many a man has made mysfare
In love as well as other wey
Whereof if I shall more sey
Upon the nature of this vice
Of customme and of excercyse
The man's grace how it fordoth
A tale which was whylome sooth
Of fools that so dronken were
I shall reherce unto thyn ere
^ I^ loquitur specialiter contra vicium illorum qui nimia potacione ex

i Read in ^ Cronycle thus
Of Gabba and of vi^^llus
The which of spayn both were
The grettest of al other there
And both of one condition
After the disposicion
Of glotony and of dronkeship
That was a sorry felauship
For this thou might well understand
That man may not well long stand
Which is wyndronk of common use

For where that wyn does wit awey

No more than a blind man thredeth

No more is Reason than of might
When he with dronkeship is blent
And in this point they were shent
This gabba both and eke (...)lle
Upon the cause as I shall tell
Whereof good is to taken head
For they two with her dronkenhede
Of wytles ex^^tacion
Oppresseden all the ^acion
Of Spain for a foul vsaunce
Which done was of coutynuaunce
Of hem which al day dronken were
There was no wife ne maiden there

God would not they sholden last
And shope the law in such wise
That they by the dome to the Iuyse

As ferforth as I may suffyse
But well I wot that in no wise
The dronkeship of love awey
I may remeue in no wise
It stont not upon my fortune
But if thou list to comune
Of the second glotonye
Which cleped is delycacye
Whereof ye spak here to fore
Byseche I would you therefore
My sone as of that ylke vice
Which of all other is the noryce
And stant upon the retenue
Of Venus so as it is due
The propyrte how that it fares
The ^ook herafter now declares
Delicie cum diuicijs sunt i^ra pote^^um / ^n quibus orta Venus excitat ora

oF this Chapter in which I trete /
There is yet one of such dyete. To which no power may (...).
For all is paast of peindemayn
And sundry wyn and sundry drink
Whereof that he will ete or drink
His (...) ben for him affayted
So that his body is a waited
That him shall lack no delight
As ferforth as his appetyte
Suffyseth to the metes hot
Whereof this lusty vice is hot
Of gule the delycacye
Which all the hole progenye
Of lusty folk has undertake
To feel whiles that he may take
Richesse / whereof to be found
Of abstynence he wot no bound
To what proufyte it should serve
And yet ph^sik of his conserve
Makes many a restauracion
Unto his recreacion
Which would be to Venus leef
Thus for the point of his releef
The Cook which shall his mete array
But he the better his mouth assay
His lords thonk shall often lose
E^ he be served to the chese
For there may lack not so lyte
That he ne fynt anon a wit
For but his lust be fully served
There has no wit his thonk deseru^ed
And yet for man's sustenaunce
To keep and hold in governance
To him that will his hele get
Is none so good as common mete
For who so looks on the books
It seyth confexion of Cooks
A man him should well auyse
How he it took and in what wise
For who that uses that he knows
Full seldom sykenes in him grows
And who that uses metes strange
Though his nature empayre and change
It is no wonder lyef son
When that he does ayene his won
For in sykenes this I find
Vsaunce it is second kind
Philosophus / Consuetudo est alter^ natura

And right so changed his estat^
He that of love is delycate
For though he had to his hand
The best wife of all the land
Or the fairest love of all
Yet would his heart on other fall
And thynk hem more delycious
Than he has in his own hou^
Men seyn it is now often so
Auyse hem well they that so do
And for to speak in other way
Full oftyme I have herd say
That he which has no love acheued
Him thynkth he is not releued
Though that his lady make him chere
So as she may in good manner
Her honor and her name save
But if he the surplus might have
No thing withstondyng her estate
Of love more delycate
He set her chere at no delight
But he have all his appetyte
My sone if it be with the so
Tell me my holy father no
For delycate in such a wys^
Of love as ye me deuyse
Ne was I never yet gyltyf
For if I had such a wife
As ye speak of what should I more
For than I would neuermore
For lust of any womanhede
My heart upon none other feed
And if I did it were a waste
But all without such repaste
Of such as ye me told above
Of wife or yet of other love
I fast and may no food get
So that for lack of deynte mete
Of which an heart may be fed
I go fasting to my bed
But might I geten as I told
So mochel that my lady would
Me feed with her glad semblannt^
Though me lack all the remenaunt
Yet should I somdele be abesshed
And for the time well refresshed
But certes fader she ne does
For in good feyth to tellen sooth
I trow though I should ser^ue
She would not his eye swerue
My heart with one goodely look
To feed / and thus for such a Cook
I may goo fasting ever mo
But if so is that any woo
May feed a man's heart well
Thereof I have at every mele
Of plente more than enough
But that is of him self so cough
My stomak may not it defye
Loo thus is the delycacye
Of love which my heart fedeth
Thus have I lack of that me needs
But for all this yet netheles
I sey not I am gyltles
That I somdele am delycate
For else were I fully mate
But if that I sum lusty stound^
Of comfort and of ese found
To take of love sum repast
For though I with the full taste
The lust of love may not stele
My honge^ otherwise I kele
Of small lusts which I pyke
And for a time yet they like
If that ye wysten what I mean
Now good sone shryue the clean
Of such dayntees as ben good
Whereof thou take thyn hertes food
My fader I shall you reherce
How that my foodes ben diverse
So as they fallen in degree
If fedyng is of that I see
Another is of that I here
The third as I shall tell here
It grows of mine own thought
And e^^es should I ^eue naught
For who that fails food of herd
He may not well the death asterte
Not^i qualiter visus in amore se co^tinet de(...)

Of sight is al my first food
Tho^ugh which my eye of al good
Has that to him is acordaunt
A lusty food suffysaunt
When that I go toward the place
Where I shall see my ladies face
Mine eye which is loath to fast
Begins to hongre anon as fast
That him thinks of one hour three
Till I there come and he her see
And than after his appetyte
He takes a food of such delight
That him none other deynte needs
Of sundry sightes he him fedeth
He sees her face of such color
That fressher is than any flower
He sees her front is large and pleyne
Without frou^ce of any greyne
He sees her eyes lyche an heaven
And sees her nose streyte and even
He sees her rude upon her cheke
And sees her reed lyppes eke
Her chynne acordeth to the face
And that he sees is full of grace
He sees her neck round and white
And all this thing without wit
He may see naked at the lest
So is it well the more feste
And well the more delycacye
And to the fedyng of the eye
He sees her shap forth with all
Her body round / her myddel small
So well bigone with good array
Which passes all the lust of may
When he is most with soft showers
Full clothed in lusty flowers
With such sightes by and by
Mine eye is fed fnll finally
When he the port and the manner
Sees of her womanlyche chere
Than has he such delight on hand
He thinks he might stylle stand
And that he has full suffysaunce
Of lyue^^de and of sustenaunce
And to his part euermo
And if it thought all other so
Fro then would he never wend
But there unto the worlds end
He would abide if that he might
And feden him upon the sight
For though I might stand ay
In to the time of domes day
And look upon her ever in one
Yet when I should fro her gone
Mine eye would as though he fast
Ben honger storuen also fast
Til efte ayene that he her sye
Such is nature of mine eye
There is no lust so deyntefull
Of which a man should not be full
Of that the stomak vnderfongeth
But ever in one mine eye longs
For look how that a goushauk tyreth
Right so does he when he pyreth
And tutyth on her womanhede
For he may never fully feed
His lust but ever y lyche sore
Him hongreth so that he the more
Desires to be fed algate
And thus my eye is made the gate
Thugh which ye deyntees of my thou^
Of lust ben to mine heart brought
Right as my eye with his look
Is to mine heart a lusty Cook
O^ loves feed delycate
Right so my ere is in his estate
Where as my eye may not serve
Can well mine eres thonk deserve
And feden him fro day to day
With such fode as he may
For thus it is that oueral
Where that I come in special
I may here of my lady price
I here one sey that she is wise
Another seith that she is good
And sum men seyn / of worthy blood
That she is one / and is also
So fair that there is none so
And some preise her goodly chere
Thus every thing that I may here
Which sowneth to my lady good
Is to my heart a lusty food
And eke my ere has over this
A deynte feste when so is
That I may here her selum speak
For than anon my fast I break
On such words as she seyth
That full of truth and full of feith
They ben and of so good disporte
That to my ere great comfort
They done as they that been delices
For all the metes and all the spyce^
That any Lumbard couthe make
Ne be so lusty for to take
Ne so ferforth restauratif
I seye as for mine own lif
As ben the words of her mouth
For as the wyndowes of the southe
Ben most debonaire of all debonair^
So when her lust to speak fair
The virtue of her goodly speech
Is verily my hertes leche
And if it so bifalle among
That she carole upon a song
When I it here I am so fed
That I am fro my life so led
As though I were in paradys
For certes as to mine auys
When I here of her vois the steu^
Me thinks it is a bliss of heu^
And eke m other vois also
Full oftyme it falls so
Mine ere with a good petaunce
Is fed of redyng and of romaunce
Of Ydome and of Amadas
That whilome were in my cas
And eke of other many a store
That loueden long or I was bode
For when I of her loves read
Mine ere with the tale I fed
And with the lust of her storye
Sometime I drew it to memory
How sorrow may not ever last
And so comes hope in at the last
When I none other food know
And that endures but a throw
Right as it were a chery feste
But for to counten at the lest
As for the while yet it eseth
And somdele of my heart appeseth
For what thing to my ere spredeth
Which is plesaunt somdele it eseth
With words such as she may get
My lust instead of other mete
Loo thus my fader as I sey
Of lust the which my eye has sey
And eke of that my ere has herd
Full often I have the better ferd
And the two bryngen in the third
The which has in my heart amydde
His place take to array
The lusty food which assay
I mete and namelyche on nyghtes
When that me lacks al sightes
And that my heryng is awey
Then is he ready in the wey
My rere souper for to make
Of which my hertes fode I take
This lusty Cooks name is hoote
Thought which has ever his pottes
hot / Of love boylyng on the fire
With fantasye and with desire
Of which full often or this she fed
My heart when I was a bed
And than he set upon my lord
Both every sight and every word
Of lust which I have herd or seyn
But yet is not my fest all pleyn
But all of words and of fisshes
Thereof I have my full disshes
But as of felyng and of taste
Yet might I never have one repaste
And thus as ye have herd to forn
I lycke honey on the thorn
And as who seith upon the brydell
I chewe so that all is ydell
As in effect the fode I have
But as a man that would him save
When he is syke by medicine
Right so of love the famyn
I fond m all that ever I may
To feed and drink forth the day
Til I may have the gretter feste
Which al my honger might areste
Loo such ben my lusts three
Of that I think and here and see
I take of love my fedyng
Without tastyng or felyng
As the pour does of the heir
I live and am in good espyer^
That for none such delycacye
I trow I do no glotenye
And netheles to your auys
My holy father that been wys
I recommaunde mine estate
Of that I have been delycate
My sone I understand well
That thou have told I here euerydele
And as me thinks by thy tale
It ben delytes wonder small
Whereof thou take thy loves food
But sone if that thou understood
What is to ben delycious
Thou would not be curyous
Upon the lust of thyn estate
To ben to fore delycate
Whereof that thou reason excede
For in the books thou might read
If man's wisdom shall be showed
It ought well to ben eschewed
In love as well as other wey
For as these holy books sey
The bodily delyces all
In every point how so they fall
Unto the soul done greuaunce
And for to take in remembreunce
A tale acordaunt unto this
wiche of great understanding is
In man's soul reasonable
I think to tell / and is no fable
Hic ponit exemplum contra istos de licatos / Et narrat de diuite et Laaro /
quorum gestns m euangelio lucasuidencius describit.

oF Cristes word who will it read
How yt this vice is for to dread
In the euangely it tells pleyne
wiche must algate be certain
For crist him self bears witness
And though the clerk and the clergesse
In latin tongue it read and sing
Yet for the more knowlechyng
Of truth which is good to wit
I shall declare as I it wr^te
In Englys^he / for thus it bigan
Crist seith there was a rich man
A mighty lord of great estate
And he was eke so delycate
Of his clothyng that every day
Of purpir / and bice he made him gay
And ete and drank to his fylle
After the lusts of his will
As he which stood al in delyce
And took no head of thylk vice
And as it should so betyde
A pour Laar upon a tide
Came to the gate and axeth mete
But there might he no thing get
His dedely honger for to staunche
But he which had his full paunche
Of all lusts at the board
Ne deyneth not to speak a word
Onlyche a Cromme for to give
Whereof the peure might leave
Upon the yeft of his alms
Thus lay this pour in great distress
Ac^lde and hongred at the gate
For which he might goo no gate
So was he woeful besene
That there as he lay on the grene
The hounds comen fro the halle
Where that this sike man was fall
And as he lay there for to dye
The wounds of his maladye
They lyeken for to done him ese
But he was full of such dysese
That he may not the death escape
But as it was that time shape
The so wle fro the body passes
And he whom no thing ouerpasseth
The high god up to the heaven
Him took where he has set him even
In Abraham's barme on high
Where he the heuens ioyr sighe
And had all that he have would
And fell as it befalle should
This rich man this same throw
With sodeyne death was ouerblowe
And forth withouten any went
In to hell straight he went
The fend in to the fire him drough
Where that he had pain enough
Of flamme which that ever brenneth
And as his eye about renneth
Toward the heaven he cast his look
Where that he saw and head took
How Laar set was in his see
As far as ever he might see
With Abraham / and than he prayde
Unto the patriarch and said
Send Laar down fro thylk sete
And do that he his finger wete
In water / so that he may drop
Upon my tongue for to stop
The great hete in which I hrenne
But Abraham auswerd then
And seid to him in this wise
My sone thou the might auyse
And take in thy remembrance
How Lalar had great penance
Whiles he was in that other life
But thou in all thy lusty iolyf
The bodily delytes soughtest
For thy so as thou than wroughtest
Now shall thou take to thy reward
Of dedely pain herafter ward
In hell which shall ener last
And this Laar now at the last
The worlds pain is over ronn^
In heaven he has his life begone
Of joy which is endeles
But that thou praydest nevertheless
That I shall Laar to the send
With water on his fyngers end
Thine hot tongue for to kele
Thou shall not such graces feel
For in that folble place of sin
For ever in which thou shall ben Inn
Comes none out of this place thidder
Ne none of you may come hydder
Thus be ye parted now a two
The rich ayeneward cried tho
O Abraham since hit so is
That laar may not do me this
Which I have axed in this place
I would pray another grace
For I have yet of brethren five
That with my fader ben alive
To geder dwellen in one hows
To whom as thou art gracious
I pray that thou would send
Laar so that he might wend
To warn hem how the world is went
That afterward they be not shent
Of such peynes as I dry
Loo this I pray / and this I cry
That they may hem self amend
The patriarch anon send
Of his prayer answer nay
And said him how that every day
His brethren might know and here
Of moses in earth here
And of prophets other mo
What hem was best and he said no
But if there might a man arise
From death to life in such a wise
To tellen hem how that it were
He said then of pure fere
They sholden than beware thereby
Quod Abraham / nay sikerly
For if they now will not obey
To such as teache hem the wey
And al day preche and al day tell
How that it stont of heaven and hell
They will not than taken head
Though it befelle so in deed
That any deed man so arered
To ben of him no better lered
Than of another man on live
If thou my sone can descryue
This tale as Christ him self told
Thou shall have cause to be hold
To see so great an euydence
There of the sooth experyence
Has showed openlyche at the eye
That bodily delycacye
Of him which yeueth no alms
Shall after fall in great distress
And that was seen upon the rich
For he ne would unto his lyche
A cro^me yeuen of his bread
Than afterward when he was deed
A drop of water him was werned
Thus may a man's wit be learned
Of hem that so delytes taken
When they with death ben overtaken
That erst was sweet is than sour
But he that is gouernoure
Of worlds good if he be wise
Within his herb he set no price
Of all the world / and yet he uses
The good that he nothing refuses
As he which lord is of the things
The ouches and the rich things
The clothe of gold and the perrye
He takes.and yet the delycacye
He leueth though he were all this
The best mete that there is
He eteth and drynketh the best drink
And takes none head to think
Delycacye to put away
As he which goth the right way
Not only for to feed and clothe
His body / but his soul both
But they that taken otherwise
Her lusts ben none of the wise
And that whylome was showed eke
If thou these old books seek
As well by reason as by kind
Of old ensamples as men find
Hic loquitur de desicacia Newnis / qui corporalibus delicijs magis adherens
spiritualia gaudia minus obtinuit /

tHat man yt would him well auise
Delycacye is to despise
When kind acordeth not with all
Whereof ensample in special
Of new whylome may be told
Which ayens kind many fold
His lusts took till at the last
That god him would all ouercast
Of whom the Cronyke is so pleyne
Me lust no more of him to seyne
And netheles for glotonye
Of bodily delycacye
To know his stomak how it ferd
Of that no man to fore herd
Which he within him self bethought
A wonder subtyle thing be wrought
Three men upon election
Of age and of complexion
Lyche to him self by all way
He took to wards him to play
And ete and drank as well as he
Thereof was no dyersyte
For every day when that they ete
Tofore his o^ne board they sete
And of such mete as he was served
Al though they had it not deserved
They token service of the same
But afterward at thylk game
Was in to woeful ernest turned
For when they were thus soiourned
Within a time at after mete
Nero which had not foryete
The lusts of his freel estate
As he which al was delycate
To know thylke experyence
The men let come in his presence
And to that one the same tide
A Courser that he should ride
In to the field anon he bad
Whereof this man was wonder glad
And goth to pryke and dance about
That other while that he was out
He leyd upon his bed to sleep
The third which he would keep
Within his chamber fair and soft
He gothe now up now down full often
Walkyng a pace that he ne slepte
Till he which on the Courser lepte
Was comen fro the field again
New than as books seyne
These men did done take al three
And slew hem for he would see
Whoos stomach was best defied
And when he has the sooth tried
He found that he which goth the pas
Defied best of al was
Which afterward he used ay
And thus what thing unto his pay
Was most plesaunt he left none
With any lust he was bygone
Whereof body might glade
For he no abstynence made
But most of al erthely things
Of women unto the lykynges
Nero set al his hole heart
For lust should him not asterte
When he the thurst of love him caught
Where that him lust to take a draught
He spares neither wife ne maid
That such another as men said
In all this world was never yet
He was so drunk in all his wit
Thorugh sundry lusts which he took
That ever while there is a book
Of New men shall read and sing
Unto the worlds knowlechyng
My good sone as thou have herd
For ever yet it has so ferd
Delycacye in loves cas
Without reason it is and was
For where that love his heart set
Him thinks / it might be no bet
And though it be not fully mete
The lust of love is eure svete
Loo thus to geder of felauship
Delycacye and dronkeship
Whereof reason stant out of herre
Have made full many a man to err
In loves cause most of all
For than how so that ever it fall
Wit can no reason understand
But late the gouernannce stand
To will which than wexeth so wild
That he can not him self shyld
Fro the peril but out of fere
The way he secheth here and there
Him retcheth not upon what fyde
For oftyme he goth beside
And does such thing without dread
Whereof him ought well to dread
But when that love assoted sore
It passes all men's lore
What lust it is that he ordeyneth
There as no man's might restreyneth
And of god takes he none head
But laws without dread
His purpoos for he wol acheue
Against the points of believe
He tempts heaven and earth and hell
Here afterward as I shall tell
Dum stimulatur amor quicquid iubet ordo voluptas / Audet et aggredi tur nulla
timenda timens / Omne quod astra quem herbarum sieve potestas / Seu vigor
inferni singula temptat amans / Quod nequit ipse deo mediante parare sinistrum
/ Demonis hec magica credulus art parat. Sic sibi non curat ad opus que recia
tendit. Du^modo nudatam prendere posset auem /

Hic tractat qualiter ebrietas et deticacia onus pridicicic contrarium insti
tantes inter alia ad carnalis concupiscencie promocionem sacrilegio magica^
requirunt

WHo dare do thing which love ne dare /
To love is every law unware /
But to the laws of his best
The fisshe. the foul / the man / the beast
Of all the worlds kind loutith
For love is he which no thing douteth*
In man's heart where he sytte
He comes not toward his wit
The woo no more than the well
No more the hete than the chele
No more the wete than the dry
No more to live than to dye
So that to fore ne behind
He sees no thing but as the blind
Without insight of his courage
He does mecuayles in his rage
To what thing that he will him draw
There is no god there is no law
Of whom that he takes heed
But as baiard the blind stead
Tille he fall in the dyche a mydde
He goth there no man will him bydde
He stant so ferforth out of rewle
There is no wit that may him reule
And thus to tell him the sooth
Full many a thing he does
That were better to be laft
Among the which is such craft
That sum men clepen sorcerye
Which is for to wynue his drewry
With many a circumstaunce he uses
There is no point which he refuses
The craft which Saturnus found
To make prykes in the sound
That Geamaunce cleped is
Full often he uses amys
And of the flood his Idromaunce
And of the fire the romaunce
With questions echone of tho
He tempts often. and eke also
Acremaunce in Judgment
To love he brings of his assent
For these crafts as I find
A man may do by wey of kind
Be so / it be to good intent
But he goth al another went
For rather than he should fail
With nygromancye he would assail
To make his incantacion
With hot subfumygacion
Thilk art which spatula is bote
And used is of common rote
Among paine^s which that craft eke
Of which his auctor Those the greek
He wercheth one and one by row
Rachell is not to him unknow
Ne Salamon Candarye
His Ideote his entonye
The figure and the how with all
Of balachame and of Genball
The selle and thereupon chymage
Of the byth for his advantage
He takes. and somewhat of Gy^ere
Which helpend is to the matere
Babilla with her sons seven
Which heth renounced to the heaven
With ceornes both square and round
He grateth efte upon the ground
Making his inuocacion
And for full informacion
The s^ole which hono^us
Wr^te / he pursues / and loo thus
Magyke he uses for to win ne
His love and spares for no sin
And over that of his soty
Right as he sees sorcerye
Of hem that been magycyens
Right so of the naturyens
Upon the sterres from above
His wey he secheth unto love
As far as he hem understands
In many a sundry wise he fondeth
He makes image he makes seulpture
He makes writing / he makes figure
He makes his cala^lacions
He makes his demonstracions
His hours of Astronomye
He keeps as for that party
Which longs to the inspectyon
Of love and his affection
He would now in hell seche
The devil him self for to byseche
If that he wist for to speed
To get of love his lusty mede
Whereof that he has his heart set
He led never to fare bet
Ne wit of other heaven more
My sone if thou of such a lore
Have ben or thie I read the leave
Amans
My holy fader by your leave
Of all that ye have spoken here
Which t^uchith unto this matere
To tell the soothe right as I wene
I wot not one word what ye mean
I will not sey if that I couthe
That I nold in my lusty youth
Binethe in hell and eke above
To win with my lady love
Done all that ever that I might
For thereof have I none insight
Where afterward that I bycome
So that I win and overcome
Her love which I coueyte
My sone that gothe wonder streyte
For this I may well tell soothe
There is noman which so does
For all the craft that he can cast
That he ne byeth it at the last
For often he that wol begyle
Is gyled with the same gyle
And thus the gylour is begyled
I find in a book compyled
To this matere an old hystorye
Which comes now to memory
And is of great ensamplerye
Against the vice of sorcerye
Whereof none end may be good
But whylome how thereof stood
A tale which is good to know
To the my sone I shall beknowe
Nota hic contra istos ob amoris causam sortologos / vbi narrat Exemplum quod
cum Vlixes a subuersione Troie repatriare nanigio voluisset ipsum in Insula
Cilli vbi illa expertissima ma ga nomine Cyrces regnauit co^tigit applicuisse /
quem vt in sui amoris concupiscenciam exardesceret. Circes o^nibus suis
inca^tacionibus vincere conabatur Vlixes tamen Magica potencior ipsam in amore
subegit / Ex qua filium nomine thelogonum genuit / qui postea patrem suum
interfecit / et sic contra fidei naturam ge^^tus contra generacionis naturam
patricidium operatus est /

^ Mo^ges which at Troy were
Vlixes at the syege there
Was one by name in special
Of whom yet the memoryall
Abides / for while there is a mouth
For ever his name shall be couthe
He was a worthy knight and king
And clerk knowing of every thing
He was a great rethoryen
He was a great magycyen
Of tullius the Rethoryk
Of king Zorastes the magyke
Of tholome the Astronomye
Of plato the philosophye
Of danyel the slepy dremes
Of neptune eke the water stremes
Of Salamon the prouerbis
Of matter at the strength of herbs
And the phisike of ypocras
And lyche unto pyctagoras
Of surgerye he knew the cures
But somewhat of his auentures
Which to my matter shall acorde
To the my sone I will record
This king of which you have herd seyne
From Troy as he goth home again
By ship he found the sea diverse
With many wyndy storm reuerse
But he thorugh wysedom yt he shapeth
Full many great peril he escapes
Of which I thynk tell one
How that mangre the nedel and stone
Wind drive he was al suddenly
Upon the strondes of Cylly
Where that he must abide a while
Two queen's weren in that isle
Calypha named and Cyrces
And when they herd how Vlixes
Is londed thereupon the Ryue
For him they senden also blyue
With him such as he would name
And to the Court to hem he came
The quen^s weren as two goddesses
Of art magyke sorceresses
That what lord comes to that ryuage
They make him love in such a rage
That upon hem assote so
That they wol have o^^ that he go^
All that he has of worlds good
^lixes well this understood
They couthe much he couthe more
They shape and cast against him sore
And wrought many a subtyle wyle
But yet they might him not ^egy
But of the men of his nauye
They two forshope a great party
May none of hem withstond her hestes
Some part they shopen in to beestes
Some part they shopen in to fowls
To beres tygres apes and oules
Or else by some other way
There might no thing hem disobeye
Such craft they had above kind
But that art couthe they not find
Of which Vlixes was deceived
That he ne has hem all weyued
And brought hem in to such a rote
That upon him they both assote
And through the scyences of his art
He took of hem so well his part
That he bigate Cyrces with child
He kept him sobre and made him wyld
He set him self so above
That with her good and with her love
Who that thereof be leef or loathe
Al quyte in to his ship he gothe
Cyrces to swelle both sides
He left and waited on the tides
And straight thorugh the salt foam
He takes his course and comes home
Where as he fond penelope
A better wife there may none be
And yet there ben ynowe of good
But who her goodlyship understood
Fro first she wyfehode took
How many loves she forsook
And how she bare her al about
There whiles that her lord was out
S^e might take great auaunt
Among all the remenaunt
That she was one of all the rest
Well might he set his heart in rest
This king when he found her al in bele
For as he couthe in wysedom dele
So couthe she in womanhede
And when she saw without dread
Her lord upon his own ground
That ^e was come sauf and sonude
In all the world ne might be
A gladder woman than was she
The fame which may not be hid
Thorugh out the land is sone kydde
^ir king is come home again
There may no man the full seyne
How that they weren al glade
So mech^^ ^oye of hem they made
T^^ (...) every day ^e newed
He was with gifts al be sewed
The people was of him so glade
T^^t ^^^ugh none other man him bade
T^^^ge upon hem self they set
And as it were of pure debt
T^^y y^ue her goods to the king
This was a glad welhome coming
Thus both Vlyxes what he would
His wife was such as she should
His people was to him subject
As they should be without let
But fortune is of such a sleyght
That when a man is most of might
S^^ makes him rathest for to fall
There no man wot what shall befalle
The happes over mann^^ head
B^^ hanged with a tender threde
That proved was on Vlyxes
For when he was most in his p^^s
For (...) sone began to meke him werre
And set hie welthe out of herre
Upon a day as he was merry
As (...) there myt him no thing
(...) / when night was come* he goth to
^^dde / with sl^pe and both his ^yen fed
And while he slepte / he met a sweuen
Him thought he saw a statue even
Which bryghter than son shen^
A man it seems was it none
But as it was in figure
Most lyche to man's creature
But as of beauty henenlyche
It was most to an Aungel lyche
And thus between Angel and man
Beholden it this king began
And such a lust took of the sight
That feign he would if that he might
The form of that figure embrace
And goth him forth toward the place
Where he saw that image tho
And takes in his arms two
And it embraces him again
And to the king thus began it seyne
Vlixes understood well th^s
The token of our acquaintance is
Here afterward to mochel tene
The love that is us bitwene
Of that we now such joy make
That one of us the death shall take
When death comes of destyne
It may none other wise be
Vlixes tho began to pray
That this figure would him say
What wight he is that seyth him so
This wight upon a spear tho
A pensel white was well bigone
Enbrowdred showed him anon
Three fysshes all of one color
In manner as it were a toure
Upon the pensel were wrought
Vlixes knew this token naught
And praid to wit in sum party^
What thing it might ^ygnyfye
A sign it is which answered
Of an empire / and forth it ferd
Al suddenly when he that said
Vlyxes out of sleep he brayd
And that was right ayene the day
That longer slepen he ne may
Ayene a man has knowlechyng
Save of him self of all thing
His own chance no man knows
But as fortune it on him throws
Was yet never so wise a Clerk
Which might know al gods werk
Ne the secret which god has set
Ayene a man may not be let
Vlyxes though that he be wise
With all his wit in his auyse
The more that he his sweuen acounteth
The less he wot what it amounts
For all his calculacion
He sees none demonstracion
Al pleynly for to know an end
But netheles how so it wend
He drad him of his own sone
That makes him well ye more astone
And shope thereof anon with all
So that within a castle wall
Thelamon his sone he shette
Till he might know the bette
The sooth / for there he ne knew
Til that fortune him ouerthrewe
But netheles for sykernesse
Where that he might wit and guess
A place strengest in his land
There let he make of lyme and sonde
A strength where he would dwell
Was never man yet herd tell
Of such another as it was
And for to strength him in that cas
Of al his ^onde the sykerest
Of seruanntes and of the worthyest
To keep him within ward
He charged hem they sholden hard
And make such an ordinance
For love ne for acquaintance
That were it erly / were it late
They should beat in at the yate
No mauer man what so betydde
But it so were him self it bydde
But all that might him not auayl^
For whom fortune will assail
There may be no resistance
Which might a man make defense
That al shall be must fall algate
This Cyrces which I spoke of tate
On whom Vlyxes has bigete
A child though he it have foryete
When tym^ came as it was won
She was delyuerd of a son
Which cleped is thelogonus
The child when he was bore thus
About his mother to full age
That he can reason and langage
In good estate was draw forth
And when he was so mochel w^^th
To stand in a man's stead
Circes his mother has him bid
That he shall to his fader go
And told him al to geder tho
What man he was that him began
And when ^lelogonus herd that
Was ware and had full knowlechyng
How that his fader was a king
He prayed his mother fair this
To go where that his fader is
And she him granted that he shall
And made hem ready forth with all
It was that time such vsaunce
That every man the cong^ysaunce
Of his Country bare in his hand
When he went in to strange land
And thus was every man therefore
Well know where that he was bore
For espyall or myst^o wings
They did than such things
That every man may other know
S^o it bifelle in that throw
Thelogonus as in this cas
Of his Contre the sign was
Three fisshes which he should bear
Upon the pynon of a spear
And when he was thus arrayd
And had his harneys all assayd
That he was ready euerydele
His mother bad him fare well
And said him that he should s^ythe
His fader great a thousand ^ythe
Thelogonus his mother ky^^
And took his leave and where he wist
His fader was / the way he name
Til he unto Nachare came
Which of that land the chyef Cite
Was cleped / and there asks he
Where was the king / and how he ferde
And when that he the sooth herd
Where that the king Vlix^s was
Alone upon his ho^s great paas
He rood^ him forth and in his hand
He bare the signal of his land
With fisshes three as I have told
And thus he went in to that hold
Where that his own fader dwells
The cause why he came he tells
Unto the kepars of the gate
And would have cemen in there ate
But shortly they him said nay
And as fair as ever he may
Besought and told hem of this
How that the king his fader is
But they with proud words great
Biganne to manace and threte
But he go fro the gate fast
They would him take and set fast
Fro words unto strokes thus
They fell so that Thelogonus
Was sore hurt and well nyhe deed
But with his sharp speres head
He makes defense how so it fall
And wan the yate upon hem all
And has slain of the best five
And they aseryeden as belyue
Thorugh out the castle al about
On every side men came out
Whereof the kings heart aflyght
And he with all the have yt he might
A spear caught / and out he goes
As he that nyhe was wood and wroth
He saw the yates full of blood
Thelogonus and where he stood
He saw also but he ne knew
What man he was and to him threw
His spear / and he sterte out aside
But desteny which should betyde
Befelle that ylke time so
Thelogonus knew no thing tho
What man it was that to him cast
And whiles his own spear last
With all the sign thereupon
He cast unto the king anon
And smote him with a dedely wound
Vlix^s fell anon to ground
Tho every man the king the king
Began to cry and of this thing
Thelogonus which saw the caas
On knees fell / and seid alas
I have mine own fader slain
Now I would deye wonder fayn^
Now slay me who that ever will
For certes it is right good skylle
He cries he wepeth / he seid therefore
Alas that ever was I bore
That this unhappy destyne
So woefully comes in by me
This king which yet has life ynoug^
His heart ayene unto him drough
And to that voice an ere he leyd
And understood all that he seid
And began to speak and said on high
Bring me this man and when he syghe
Thelogonus his thought he set
Upon the sweuen which he met
And axeth that he might see
His spear / on which the fysshes three
He saw upon a pensel wrought
Tho wist he well / it fails naught
And bad him that he tell should
Fro whens he came and what he would
Thelogonus in sorrow and woo
So as he might told tho
Unto Vlixes all the caas
How that Cyrces his mother was
And so forth seid him every dele
How that his mother great him well
And in what wise she him sent
Tho wist Vlixes what it meant
And took gym in his arms soft
And al bledyng kyst him often
And said sone whiles I live
This infortune I the foryeue
After his other sone in have
He sent and he bigan him has^s
And came unto his fader ty^e
But when he saw him in such plyte
He would have ronnen upon that other
Anon and slain his own brother
Ne had been that Vlixes
Bitwene hem made acord and pe^s
And to his heir thelamacus
He had that he Thelogonus
With all his power should keep
Till he were of his wounds deep
Al hole and than he should him y^^^
Land where upon to live
Thelamacus when he this herd
Unto his fad^^ he answered
And said he would done his will
So dwellen they to geder stylle
These brethren and the fader sterueth
Lo whereof sorcery serves
Thorugh sorcerye his lust he wan
Thorugh sorcery his woe bygan
Thorugh sorcerye his love he chese
Thorugh sorcerye his life he lose
The child was get^ in sorcerye
Which did all this felonye
Thing which was ayene kind wrote
Unkindly it was bought
The child his own fader slough
That was vnkyndeship enough
For thy take heed how that it is
So for to win love amys
Which ends ^l his joy in woe
For all this art I find also
That has be do^ for loves sake
Where thou might ensample take
A great Cronycle Emperyall
Which ever in memoryall
Among the men how so it wend
Shall dwell unto the worlds end

tHe hye Creatoure of things
Which is king of al kings
Full many worlds chance
L^te slide under his sufferaunce
There wot noman the cause why
But he which is al mighty
And that proved whilome thus
When that the king Nectanabus
Which had Egypt for to lead
But for he sey before the deed
Thorugh magyke of his sorcerye
Whereof he couthe a great party
His enemies to him comende
Fro whom he might not him defend
Out of his own land he fled
And in the wise as he him dredde
It fell for all his wytchecraft
So that Egypt was him beraft
And he desguysed fled awey
By ship / and held the right wey
To Macedoyne where that he
Ar^yueth at the chyef Cite
Three yomen of his Chamber there
All only for to serve him were
The which he trusts wonder well
For they were true as any stele
And happens that they with him lad
Part of the best good he had
They took lodgyng in the town
After the disposicioun
Where as him thought best to dwell
He axeth than and herd tell
How that the king was out go
Upon a werre he had tho
But in that cite than was
The queen which Olympias
Was hoote and with solempnyte
The feste of her natyuyte
As it be fell was than hold
And for her lust to biholde
And prayed of the people about
She shope her for to ride out
And after mete al openly
Anon were al men ready
And that was in the Monethe of may
This lusty queen on good array
Was set upon a mule white
To seen it was a great delight
The joy that the Eyte made
With fresshe things and with glade
The noble t^une was al behonged
And every wight was sore alonged
To s^e this lusty lady ride
There was great myrthe on every side
Where as passes by the street
Th^re was full many tymbre beat
And many a maid carolyng
And thus through out yt t^un playeng
This queen unto a pleyne rode
Where that she houed and abode
To see diverse g^me pley
The lusty folk Just and torney
And so forth every other man
Which play couthe / ^is play bigan
To plese with this noble queen
Nectanabus came to the grene
Among other and drough him nyghe
But when that he this lady syghe
And of her beauty head took
He ^^uthe not withdraw his look
To see naught else in the field
But stood / and only her biheld
Of his clothyng and of his chere
He was al vnlyche other there
So that it happens at the last
The queen upon him her eye cast
And knew that he was s^rau^ge anon
But he biheld her ever in one
Without blemysshyng of his cheer
She took good ^ede of h^s manner
And wondreth why he did so
And bad men sheld for him goo
He came and did her reverence
And she axeth in silence
From whom he came and what he would
And he with sobre words told
And seyth madame a Clerk I am
To you and in message I came
The which I may not tellen here
But if it like you to here
It must be said al pryuely
Where none shall be but ye and I
Thus for the time he took his leave
The day goth forth till it was eve
That every man mote let his werk
And she thought ever upon this clerk
What thing it is that he would men's
And in this wise abode the queen
It passes over thylk night
Till it was on the moro we light
She send for him and he came
With him his Astrolahe he name
Which was of fine gold precious
With points and cercles merueylous
And eke the heavenly fygures
Wronght in a book full of peyntures
He took this lady for to show
And told of each of hem by rewe
The course and the condycyon
And she with great affectyon
Sat stylle and herd what he would
And thus when he sees time he told
And feyneth with his words wise
A tale and seyth in such a wise
Madame but a while agoo
Where I was in Egypt tho
And radde in scole of this science
It fell in to my conscience
That I in to the temple went
And there with all my hole intent
As I my sacryfice deed
One of the gods has me ^ed^
That I you warn pryuely
So that ye make you ready
And that ye be no thing agaste
For he such love has to you cast
That ye shall ben his own dear
And he shall be your bedfere
Til ye conceive and be with child
And with that word* she wex al myld^
And somdele bicame for shame
And axrth him that gods name
Which so wol done her company
And he seid amos of luby
And she said that may I not leave
But if I see a better preue
Madame quod Nectanabus
In token that it shall be thus
This night for enformacion
Ye shall hane a vysyon
That Amos shall to you appear
To she we and teache in what maner^
The thing shall afterward befalle
Ye oughten well abouen all
To make joy of such a lord
And when ye be of one acord
He shall a sone of you begete
Which with his swerd shall wyn and get
The wide world in length and bread
Al erthely kings shall him dread
And in such a wise I you behote
The god of the earth he shall be hot
If this be sooth tho quod the queen
This night thou se^^st it shall be seen
And if it fall in to my grace
Of god Amos that I purchase
To take of him so great worship
I wol do the such ladyship
Whereof thou shall for euermo
Be rich / and he thanked her tho
And took his leave / and forth he went
She wist little what he meant
For it was gyle and sorcerye
All that she took for prophecye
Nectanabus thorugh out the day
When he came home where he lay
His chamber with him self took
And ouertorneth many a book
And thorugh the craft of art mage
Of wex he forgeth an image
And looks his equacions
And eke the constellacions
He looks the con^unctions
He looks the recepcions
His signs his hour his ascendent
And dr^weth fortune of his assent
The name of the queen Olimpias
In thylk image written was
A mids in the front above
And thus to win his lust of love
Nectanabus this werk has dyght
And when it came within night
That every wight is fall a sleep
He thought he would his time keep
As he which has his hour appointed
And than first he has anoyn^eed
With sond^y herbs that figure
And thereupon he began conjure
So that thorugh his enchauntement
This lady which was Innocent
And wist no thing of this gyle
Met as she slepte thylke while
How fro the heaven came a light
Which al her chamber made light
And as she looked to and fro
She sey her thought a dragon tho
Whoos scherdes shynen as the son
And has his soft paas begone
With all the chere that he may
Toward the head there she lay
Til he came to the beds side
And she lay stylle and no thing cryde
For he did al his things fair
And was curtoys and debonayre
And as he stood her fast by
His form he thaunged suddenly
And the figure of man he nome
And to her in to her bed he come
And such thing there of love he wrote
Whereof so as her than thought
Thorugh lykyng of this god Amos
With child anon her womb ^roos
And she was wonder glad with all
Nectanabus which causes all
Of this metred the substance
When he sees time his nygromance
He stynt and no thing more seide
Of his carecte and she abreyde
Out of her sleep and leueth well
That it is sooth than enery dele
Of that this Clerk her had told
And was the gladder many fold
In hope of such a glad metrede
Which after shall befalle in deed
She longs sore after the day
That she her sweuen tell may
To this gylour in pryuete
Which knew it as well as she
And netheles on the morrow soon
She left all other things to done
And for him sent and all the caas
She told him pleynly as it was
And said how than well she wist
That she his words might tryst
For she fond her auysyon
Right after the condycyon
Which he her had told tofore
And prayed him hertely therefore
That he her hold couuenaunt
So forth of all the remenaunt
That she may thorugh his ordinance
Toward the god do such plesaunce
That she wakyng might him keep
In such wise as she met in sleep
And he that couthe gyle enough
When he this herd for joy he lough
And said madame it shall be do
But this I warn you thereto
This nyt when that he comes to play
That there be no life in the way
But I that shall at his liking
Ordeyne so for his coming
That ye ne shall of him fail
For this madame I you conusaile
That ye it keep so pryue
That no wight else but we three
Have knowlechyng how that it is
For else might it fare amys
If ye did ought that should him grieve
And thus he makes her to bileue
And fayneth under gyle feyth
But netheles all that he seyth
She troweth. and ayene the night
She has within her chamber dyght
Where as this gyloure fast by
Upon this god shall pryuely
Awayte as ye make her to wene
And thus this noble gentyl queen
When she most trust was deceived
The nyt came the chamber is weyued
Nectanabus has take his place
And when he saw time of space
Thorugh deceyte of his magyke
He put him out of man's like
And of a dragon took he the form
As he which would al conform
To that she saw in sweuen or this
And thus to chamber comen he is
The queen lay a bed and syghe
And hops ever as he came nyghe
That he god of luby were
So that she the less fere
But for he would her more assure
Yet efte he changed his figure
And of a wether the likeness
He took in figure of his noblesse
With large horns for the nones
Of fine gold and precious stones
A Corowne on his head he bare
And sodenlyche or she was ware
As he which all gyle can
His form he turns in to man
And came to bed / and she lay stylle
Where as she suffered all his will
And she which wend not mysdo
But netheles it happened so
Al though she were in part deceived
Yet for all that she has conceived
The worthyest of all the kythe
Which was ever to fore or sith
Of conquest and of Chyualrye
So that thorugh gyle and sorcerye
There was that noble knight bego^ne
Which all the world has after wo^ne
Thus fell the thing which fall should
Nectanabus has that he would
With gyle he has his love spedde
With gyle he came in to the bed
With gyle he goth him out again
He was a shrewed chambyrlayne
So to begyle a worthy queen
And that on him was after seen
But netheles the thing is do
This false god was soon goo
With his deceyte and held him cloos
Till morrow came that he aroos
And tho when time of leyser was
Tho queen told him all the cas
As she that gyle none supposes
And of two points she him opposes
One was if that this god no more
Will come ayene and evermore
How she shall stonden in acord
With king philip her own lord
When he comes home and sees her groan
Madame he seyth let me alone
As for the god I undertake
That when it lyketh you to take
His company at any throw
If I a day to fore it know
He shall be with you on the night
And he his will of such a might
To keep you from al blame
For thy comfort you madame
There shall none other cause be
Thus took he leave / and forth goth he
And tho began he for to muse
How he the queen might excuse
Toward the king of that is fall
And fonnd a craft among all
Through which he has a sefoul dasited
With his magyke and so enchaunted
That he flewe forth when it was nyt
Unto the kings tent right
Where that he lay amyddes his host
And when he was a sleep most
With that the sefoull to him brought
Another charm which he wrought
At home within his chamber stylle
The king he turns at his will
And makes him for to dreme and see
The dragon and the pryuete
Which was between him and ye queen
And over that he made him wene
In sweuen how that the god Amoo
When he from the queen aroos
Took forth a ring wherein a stone
Was set and grave thereupon
A sone in which when he came night
A lion with a swerd he sight
With a prente as he tho met
Upon the queen's womhe he set
A seall and goth him forth his way
With that the sweuen went his way
And tho bygon the king a wake
And sighed for his wives sake
With that he lay within his tent
And has a greet wonder what it meant
With that he hasted him to rise
Anon and sent after the wise
Among the which there was one
A Clerk his name is Amphyone
When he the kings sweuen herd
What it bytokeneth he answered
And said as sykerly as the life
A god has leyn by thy wife
And get a sone which shall win The world and all that was withynne
As the lion is king of beestes
So shall the world obey his heestes
Which with his swerd shall all be wo^ne
As far as shyneth any son
The king was doutif of this dome
But netheles when that he come
Again in to his own land
His wife with child great he found
He might not him self stere
That he ne made her heavy chere
But he which couthe of all sorrow
Nectanabus upon the morrow
Thorugh the deceyte of Nygromaunce
Took of a dragon the semblaunce
And where the king sat in his halle
Came in rampyng among hem all
With such a noise and such a rore
That they aghast were all so sore
As though they should deye anon
And netheles he greueth none
But goth toward the deyse on hye
And when he queen nyghe
He stynt his noise and his wise
To her he proffered his service
And leyd his hand upon her barme
And she with goodly chere her arm
About his neck ayeneward leyde
And thus the queen with him pleyde
In sight of al men about
And at the last he began to loute
And obeysaunce unto her make
And he that would his leave take
And suddenly his lothely form
In to an egle he began transform
And flewe and set him on a rail
Whereof the king had great marvel
For there he plumeth him and pyketh
As does an hawke when him well
likes And after that him self he shoke
Whereof that all the halle quoke
As it a terremote were
They saiden all god was there
In such a rees and forth he flygh
The king which all this wonder sighe
When he came to his chamber alone
Unto the queen he made his moan
And of foryeuenes he her prayed
For than he knew well as he said
She was with child than with a god
Than was the king without rod
Chastysed and the queen excused
Of that she had been accused
And for the gretter euydence
Yet after that in the presence
Of king philip and of other mo
When they roode in the feldes tho
A fesaunte came before her cye
The which anon as they her seye
Fleyng let an egg down fall
And it to brake among hem all
And as they token thereof keep
They saw out of the shelle crepe
A little serpent out of the ground
Which rampeth al about round
And in ayene it wol have won
But for the brennyng of the son
It might not / and so he deyde
And thereupon the clerks seide
As the serpent when it was out
Went enuyroun the shelle about
And might not torn in again
So shall it fall in certain
This child the world shall enuyroune
And above all to bear the Crown
Him shall befalle in his young age
He shall desire in his courage
When all the world is in his hand
To turn again in to the land
Where he was bore and in his weye
Home ward he shall with poison deye
The king which all this saw and herd
Fro that day forth how so it ferd
His Ielousye has all foryete
But he which has the child beg^ete
Nectanabus in pryuete
The time of his natyuyte
Upon the constellacion
A wayteth and relacion
Makes to the queen how she shall d^
And every hour appoynteth so
That no mynute thereof was lore
So that in due time is bore
This child and forth with thereupon
There fell wondres many one
Of terremote vnyuersell
The son took color of the stele
And left his light / the wyndes blewe
And many strengthes ouerthrewe
The sea his propre kind changed
And all the world his form changed
The thonder with his fyry beuen
So cruel was upon the heaven
That every erthely creature
Tho thought his life in adventure
The tempest at the last seceth
The child is kept his age encreceth
And Alysaunder his name is hot
To whom Calystre and Arystote
To techen him philosophye
Endenden and Astronomye
With other things which he couthe
Also to teache him in his youth
Nectanabus took upon hand
But every man may understand
Of sorcerye how that it wend
It will him self prove at the end
And namely for to begyle
A lady which without gyle
Supposes all that she hereth
But often he that evil stereth
His ship is dreynte therein a mydde
And in this caas right so betydde
Nectauabus upon a night
When it was fair and sterre bright
This young lord lad upon high
Above a tower where as he syghe
The sterres such as he acounteth
He sees what each of hem amounts
And though he knew of al thing
Yet has he no knowlechyng
That shall unto him self befalle
When he has told his words all
This young lord than him opposes
And asks if that he supposes
What death he shall him self deye
He seith or fortune is aweye
And every sterre has lost his won
Or else of mine own son
I shall be slain I may not fle
Thought Alysandre in pryuyte
Hereof this old dotard lies
And or that other ought aspyeth
Al sodenlyche his old bones
He shoof over the wall for the nones
And seyth him / lie down there a part
Whereof now serves al thyn art
Thou know al other men's chance
And of thy self have ygnoraunce
That thou have said among all
Of thy person it is not befalle
Neccanabus which has his death
Yet whiles him lasts life or brethe
To Alysander he spak and said
That he with wrong blame on him leid
Fro point to point and al che cas
He told how he hie son was
Tho he which sorry was enough
Out of the dyche his fader drough
And told his mother how it ferde
In counceyl / and when she it herd
And knew the tokenes which he told
She nyst what she sey should
But stood abashed as for the while
Of his magyke and of his gyle
She thought how she was deceived
That she has of a man conceived
And wend a god it had be
But netheles such degree
So as she might her honor save
She shope the body was begraue
And thus Nectanabus abought
The sorcery which he wrought
Though upon the creatures
Thorugh his carectis and figures
The maystry and the power had
His creator to naught him lad
Again whose law his crafde he uses
When he for lust his god refuses
And took him to the deuyls ^aft
Lo what profit is him belaft
That thing through which he we^de have
sto^de / First him exiled out of land
Which was his own / and from a king
Made him to be an vnderlyng
And sythen to deceive a queen
That torneth him to mochel ^^ne
Thorugh lust of love he gate him hate
That end couthe he not abate
His old sleyghtes which he cast
Young Alisander hyn ouercast
His fader which him mysbigat
He slew / a great myshappe was that
But for one mys another mys
Was yolde / and so full often is
Nectanabus his craft myswent
And so it mysfell him or that he went
I note what helps that clergy
Which makes a man to do folly
And namelyche of Nygromaunce
Which stont upon the mysereaunce
Nota qualiter rex Zorastes statim cu^ ab vtero matris sue nasceretur gaudio
magno risit, in quo prenosticum doloris subsequentis signum figurabatur Nam et
ipse detestabilis artis magica primus fuit inuentor / quem postea rex Surrie
dira morte trucidauit. and sic opus operarium consumpsit

aNd for to see more euydence
Zorastes which that experyence
Of art Magyke first forth drough*
Anon as he was bore he lough
Which token was of woo sewyng
For of his own contreuyng
He found Magyke / and taught it forth
But al was him little worth
For of surry a worthy king
Him slew / and that was his endyng
But yet through him this craft is used
And he thorugh all the world accused
For it shall never well acheue
They stont not right with the believe
But lyche to wulle is evil sponne
Who leseth him self has little won
And the end proves every thing
Saul which yt was of Jews king
Upon pain of death forbede this art
And yet he took thereof his part
The phitonysse in Samary
Yafe him counceyll by sorcery
Which after fell to much srowe
For he was slain upon the morrow
To conne much it helps
But of to much no man yelpeth
So for to look on every side
Magyk may not well betyde
For thy my sone I wol the read
That thou of these ensamples dread
That for no lust of erthely love
Thou seche so to come above
Whereof as in the worlds wonder
Thou shall ever be put under
My good fader grant mercy
For ever I shall beware thereby
Of love what so ever me bifalle
Such sorcery abouen all
Fro this day forth I will eschew
That so ne will I not pursewe
My lust of love for to seche
But this I would you byseche
^^eside that me stant of love
As I you herd speak above
How Asysandre was betaught
Of Arystotle and so well taught
Of all that to a king belonged
Whereof my heart sore longs
To wit what it would mean
For by reason I would wene
That if I herd of things strange
Yet for a time it should change
My pain and less me somdele
My good sone thou shall well
For wysedom how that ever it stand
To him that can it understand
Does great preue in sundry wise
But touching of so high a pryse
Which is not unto Venus know
I may it not my self know
Which of her court am al forth draw
And can no thing but of her law
But netheles to know more
As well as thou / me longs sore
And for it helps to comune
Of every thing in comune
The scole of the philophye
Yet thynk I for to specyfye
In books as it is comprehended
Whereof thou myghtest be amended
For though I be not al connyng
Upon the form of his writing
Sum part / thereof yet I hane herd
In this matter how it has ferd

I Genius the priest of love
My sone as you have praid above
That I the scole shall declare
Of Aristotle and eke the fare
Of Alysaundre how he was taught
I am somdele thereof distraught
For it is not the matere
Of love why we sytcen here
To shryue as Menus bad
But nenertheles for it is glad
So as thou see for thyn apryse
To here of such things wise
Whereof thou might the time bliss
So as I can I shall the wysse
For wysedom is at every throw
Above al other thing to know
In loves cause and else where
For thy my sone unto thyn ere
Though it be not in the Regystre
Of Venus / yet of that Calystre
And Aristotle whylome write
To Alysander thou shall wit
But for the lores ben dynerse
I thynk first to the reherce
The nature of the philosophy
Which Aristotle of his clergy
Wise and expert in the seyence
Declared thylke intellygence
As of the points in pryncipalle
Whereof the first in specialle
Is Theoryk / which is grounded
On him which al ye world has founded
Which comprehended all that lore
And for to loken ouermore
Next of seyence the second
Is Rethoryk whoos facounde
Above al other is eloquent
To tell a tale in Judgment
So well can no man speak as he
The last seyence of the three
Is practyke whoos office
The virtue tries fro the vice
And techeth upon good thewes
To slay the company of shrewes
Which stant in disposicion
Of man's fre election
Practyke enformeth eke the rewle
How that a worthy king shall rule
His realm both in werre and pees
Lo this done Aristotle's
These three scyrncrs has divided
And the nature also decydeed
Whereof that each of hem shall serve
The first which is conserve
And kepar of the remenaunt
And that which is most suffysaunt
And chyef of the philosophye
If I thereof shall specyfye
So as the philosophre told
Now harken / and keep that thou it hold
Prima creatorem dat scire sciencia summi. Qui capit agnoscit sufficit illud
ei* Plura vires qua^doq iuuat nescire set illud / Quoth videt ex pediens sobrius
ille sapit /

Hic tractat de prima part philosophy que theorica dicitur / cuius natura
triplici dotata est sciencia / scilicet Theologia / Phisica et Mathematica /
Set primo illam partem Theoryce declarabit

t F Theoryk pryncipalle
The philosopher in specialle
The propyrtees has determined /
And thylk which is enlumyned
Of wysedom and of hyhe prudence
Abone al other in his science
And stant expert upon three
The first of which in his degree
Is cleped in philosophye
The science of Theologye
That other named is phisik
The third is seid Mathematyk
Theologye is that science
Which unto man yeueth euydence
Of thing which is not bodily
Whereof men known redyly
The hyhe almighty trynyte
Which is one god in unity
Withouten end and begyunyng
And creatoure of al thing
Of heaven of earth / and eke of hell
Whereof as old books tell
The philosophre in his reason
Wrote upon his conclusion
And of his writing in a clause
He cleped god the first cause
Which of him self this ylke good
Withouten whom / is nothing good
Of which that every creature
Has his being and his nature
After the being of the things
There ben the forms of beynges
Nota quoth triplex est essencia / prima temporalis que incipit et desinit /
Secunda perpetuo que incipit et no^ desinit Tercia sempiterna que nec incipit
nec desimt /

Thing which bygan and end shall
That thing to cleped temporal
There is also by other wey
Thing which bigan and shall not deye
As sowles that been spirituell
Here being is perpetuel
But there is one above the son
Whoos time was never bigonne
And endeles shall ever be
That is the god / whoos mageste
Al other things shall govern
And his being is sempyterne
The god / to whom al honor
Belongs / he is creatoure
And other ben his creatures
The god commanded the natures
That they to him obeyen all
Withouten him what so bifalle
Here might is none / and he may all
The god was ener and ever shall
And they begone of his assent
The times al be present
To god and to hem al unknow
But what him lyketh that they know
Thus both an Angel and man
The which of all that god hygan
Be chyef and obeyen to gods might
And he stont endeles up right
To this seyence ben pryue
The clerks of dyuynyte
The which to the people prechen
The feythe of holy church and techen
Which in one caas of bileue
Stant more than they conne preue
By wey of argument sensyble
But netheles it is credyble
And does a man great mede have
To him that thinks him self to save
Theology in such a wise
Of hyhe seyence and hyhe pryse
Above al other stant unlike
And is the first of theoryk
Nota de secunda part Theoryce / que Phisica dicitur *

Phisike is after the second
Through which ye philosophre has fo^de
To techen sundry knowbechynges
Upon the lodelyche things
Of man of be of earth / of stone
Of fisshe of foul of euerychone
That been of dedely substance
The nature and the circumstaunce
Thorugh this science it is full soft
Which vaileth not and which vaileth often
Nota de tercia part Theorice que Mathematica dicitur / cuius condicio quatuor
in se continet intelligencies / scilicet Ausmetricam / Musicam / Geometriam et
Astronomiam / Sed primo de Ausmetrice natura dicere intendit

tHe third point of Theoryk
Which cleped is Mathematyk
Divided is in soudry wise
And stant upon diverse appryse
The first of which is ars metryk
And the second is said Musik
The third is eke gemetrye
Also the fourth astronomye
Of ars metryk the matere
Is that of which a man may lere
What Algarysme in nombre amou^teth
When that the wise man acompteth
After the formuel propyrte
Of Algarysmes A / b / c
By which mnltyplycacion
Is made and deuysyon
Of sommes by experyence
Of this art / and this science*
Nota de Musica que secunda pars artis Mathematice dicitur

The second of Mathematyk
Which is the science of Musik
That techeth upon armony
A man to make melody
By voice soune and Instru^ment
Thorugh notes of acordement
The which men pronounce alofte
Now sharp notes and now soft
Now hye notes and now low
As by gammuth a man may know
Which techeth the prolacion
Of note and the condycion
Nota de tercia specie artis Mathematice quam geometriam vocant

Mathematik of his science
Has the third ntellygence
Full of wysedom and of clergy
And cloped is Geometye
Thorugh which a man has thylk sleit
Of length of bread of depth and of heyt
To know the proporcion
Of very calculacion
Of this science in this wise
As these old philosophres deuyse
Of all this worlds earth round
How large / how thyk was the ground
Contryued by this experyence
The Cercle and the circumference
Of every thing unto the heaven
They setten point and mesure even
Mathematik above the earth
Of hye science above the ferth
Which speaks upon Astronomye
And techeth of the sterres hyhe
Beginning up ward fro the moon
But first as it was for to done
This Aristotle's in other thing
Unto this worthy young king
The kind of every element
Which stonden under the firmament
How it is made / and in what wise
Fro point to point he can deuyse
Quatuor omnipotens elementa creauit origo. Quatuor et venti partibus ora dabat
/ Nostra q^ quadruplici co^plexis sort creatur / Corpore sic qy suo stat
variatus homo

Hic interim tractat de creacione qua tuor elementorum / scilicet terre / Aque
/ aeris et ignis. Nec non et eorum naturis nam et sing^ulis proprietates
singule attribuuntur

tO fore the crea^cion
Of any worlds stacion
Of heaven of earth and eke of helles
So as these old books tells
As sone to fore the song is set
And yet to geder knyt
Right so the high purueaunce
Tho had under his ordinance
A great substance a great matere
Of which he would in his manner
This other thing make and form
For yet withouten any storm
Was that matter universal
Which his ylem in special
Of Ilem as I am informed
These elements ben made and fourmed
Of ylem elements they hot
After the scole of Aristote
Of which if more I shall reherce
Four elements there ben diverse
Nota de terra quod est primum elementum

The first of hem earth men call
Which is the lowest of them all
And in his form is shape round
Substancialle / strong / sad / and sound
As that which made is suffysaunt
To bear all the remenaunt
For as the point in a compass
Stant even amyddes right so was
This earth set and shall abide
That it may swerue to no side
Philosophus Vnumquodque naturaliter
appetit suum censum
And has his Center after the law
Of kind to that Center draw
Desires every worlds thing
If there were no lettyng
Nota de aqua quod est secundum elementum

Above the earth keeps his bound
The water which is the second
Of elements and al about
It vywneth there without
But as it shows not for thy
This subtyle water myghtely
Though it be of him self soft
The strength of earth passes often
For right as veins ben of blood
In man right so the water in floode
The earth of his course makes diverse
veins / As well ye hylle as ye pleynes
And that a man may see at the eye
For where the hills be most hye
There may men well stremes find
So preueth it by wey of kind
The water lyghter than the land
And over this now vnderstoude
Nota de era quod est tercium elementum

Air is the third of elemente
Of whoos kind his asperimente
Takes every lives creature
Which shall upon the earth endure
For as the fysshe if it be dry
Must in defaute of water dye
Right so without eyer on live
No man ne be might pryue
The which is made of flesh and bone
There is out take of al none
Nota quod aer in tribus periferijs diuiditur

This air in periferijs three
Divided is of such degree
Bynethe is one / and one amydde
And above is set the thyrdde
Of which upon deuysyons
There ben diverse oppressions
Of moist and eke of dry also
Which by the son both two
Ben draw and haled upon hye
And maken clouds in the sky
As showed is at man's sight
Thereof by day and eke by night
After the time of the year
Among us upon earth here
De prima aeris periferia
In sundry wise things fall
The first peryfery of all
Engenders mist and ouermore
The dewes and the frostes hoar
After thylk insterticion
In which they take inpression
De secunda aeris periferia
Fro the second as the looks seyn
The most drops of the reyn
Descenden in to myddel earth
And tempereth it to sede and e^the
And does to spryng gras and flower
And often also the great sho^re
Out of such place it may be take
That it the form shall forsake
Of reyne / and in to snow be turned
And eke it may be so soiourned
In sundry places up alof^^
that in to hayle / it torneth often
De tercia aeris periferia
The third of air after the law
Thorugh such matere as up is draw
Of dry thing as it is often
Among the clouds upon lofte
And is so close it may not out
Than is it chased sore about
Till it to fire and leyte it fall
And it breketh the clouds all
The which of so great noise craken
That they the f^rfull noise maken
The thonder stroke smite or it light
And yet men seen the fire full right
The thonder stroke or that men here
So may it well be proved here
In thing which showed is fro f^r^
A man's eye is there ne^^
Than is the second to man's ^^^
And nethe^es it is great fere
Both of the stroke and of the fire
Of which is no recouyre
In place where that they descend
But if god would his grace send
Nota qualiter ignes quos no^antu^ in ^ere diseu^^ere videmus secundum varias
apparentes formas varia gestant nomina quorum primus / Assub Secuudus Capra
saliens / tercius / eges Et quartus daali libus philosophorum nuncupatus est /

^ No for to speken over this
In this part of the air it is
That men full often seen by nyt
The fire in sundry form alyght
Sometime the fire drake it seems
And the lewd people it demeth
Sometime it seems as it were
After which that glydeth there
But it is nether of the two
The philosophre tells so
And seith that of Impressions
Thorugh diverse exaltacions
Upon the cause and the matere
Men seen diverse form appear
Of fire which has sundry name
Assub he said is thylke same
The which in sundry place is found
When it is down to the ground
So as the fire it has anheled
Like unto slyme which is congeled
Of exaltacions I find
Fire kendeleth of the same kind
But it is in another form
Whereof I shall conform
The figure unto that it is
These old clerks tellen this
For it is like a got skyppyng
And for it is such semyng
It is hot Capra saliens
And these Astronomyens
Another fire also by night
Which shows him to man's fight
They clepen eges / the which brenneth
Like to the curraunt fire it renneth
Upon a cord as thou have seen
When it with powdre was so besene
Of sulphur / and three things mo
There is another fire also
Which seems to a man's eye
By nyghtes time as though there f^y^
A dragon brennyng in the sky
And that is cleped propyrly
Baasy / whereof men seen fallen often
^o where the fyry drake alofte
Flees upon the eyer / and so they semen
But why the fires so semen
Of sundry forms to behold
The wise philosophre tol^
So as the fore it has ^en herd
^o thus my sone how it ferd
Of air the due propyrte
In sundry wise thou might see
And how under the firmament
It is ^ke the third element
Which enuyronned both the two
The water and the sonde also
Nota de igne quod est quartum elementum

And for to tell over this
Of elements the which the fourth is
That is the fire in his degree
The which enuyroneth the other three
And is without moist al dry
But list now what seyth the clergy
For upon hem that I have said
The c^^atour has set and leyd
The kind and the complexion
Of al men's nation
Four elements sundry there be
Lyche unto which in that degree
Among the men there ben also
Complexions four and no mo
Whereof the philosophre treteth
That he no thing behind leteth
And seyth how that they ben diverse
So as I shall to the reherce
Nota hic aualiter secundum natural quatuor eleme^torum quatuor in humano
^^rpore complexionis scilicet Melencolica / Fleuma / Sangnis et colera
naturaliter constituuntur / vnde primo de melencolica dicendum est

^ E which natur^d every kind
The mighty god so as I find
Of man which is his creature
Has so divided the nature
That none ty^ other well acordeth
And by this cause it so discordeth
The life which feleth the sykernesse
May stand upon no sykernesse
Of the earth which is cold and dry
The kind of man Melencolye
Is cleped / and that is the first
The most vngoodlyest and the werst
For unto loves work on night
Him lacks both will and might
No wondre is in lusty place
Of love though he lose grace
What man has that complexion
Is full of ymagynacion
Of deeds and of wrongful thought
He fretyth him self al to naught
The water which is moist and cold
Makes fleume which is many fold
De complexione Fleumatis
Foryeteful slow and weary soon
Of every thing which is to done
He is of kind suffisaunt
To hold love his covenant
But to him lacks appety^^
Which longs unto such delight
What man yt takes his kind o^ ye ay^^
He shall be light / he shall be f^yre
De complexione sanguinis
First his complexion is blood
Of al there is none so good
Forth he has both will and might
To plese and pay love his right
Where he has love undertake
Wrong is if he be forsake
The fire of his condition
Appropreth the complexion
Which in a m^n is cold hot
Whoos propirt^^s ben dry and hot
It makes a man to be engynous
And swyfte of foot and ^ke yrous
Of conteke and ^ke full of hastynesse
He has a right great business
To thynk on love and little may
Though he be hot well ^ day
On night when that he wol assay
He may full evil his debt pay
Nota qualiter quatuor complexionis quatuor in homine hu^aco^nes diui^^m
possident

After the kind of the element
Thus stant a man's kind went
As touching his complexion
Upon sundry dyuysyon
Of dry of moist / of cold of hete
And each of hem his own sete
Appropred has within a man
And first to tell as I began
Splen domus est melancholy

The splen is to Melencolye
Assigned for herborgery
Pulmo domus est fleumatis

The moist fleume the which is cold
Has in the longes for his hold
Ordained him a propre stead
And dwells there as he is bid
Epar domus est sanguiuis

To the sanguyne complexion
Nature of his inspection
A propre hows has in the liver
For his dwelling made deliver
Fell domus colere
The fourth color with his het^
By wey of kind his propre sete
Has in the g^lle where he dwells
So as the philosophre tells
Nota de stom^cho qui vna cum alijs specialius deseruit

Now over ^^^s is for to wit
As it is in phisike write
Of liver / long / of galle / of spleen
They al unto the heart been
Seruanntes and each in his office
Entendeth to do him service
As which is lord above
The liver makes him for to love
The longes give him wey of speech
The galle serves to do wreche
The spleen does him to laugh and play
When al uncleanness is away
Loo thus has each of hem in deed
To suffren hem and feed
In time of recreacion
Nature has increacion
The stomach for a comune koke
Ordeyneth so as seith the book
The stomak / Cook / is for the halle
And boyleth mete for hem all
To make hem mighty for to serve
The heart that he shall not sterue
For a king in his empire
Above al other is lord and sire
So is the heart pryncipall
To whom reason in special
Is give as for the governance
And thus nature his purueaunce
Has for man to lyuen here
But god the which the soul de^^
Has formed it in other wise
That can no man pleynly deuyse
But as Clerks us inform
That lyche to god it has a form
Thorugh which form and likeness
The soul has many an hye noblesse
Appropred to his own kind
But of hi^ wit be made blind
Al onlyche of this ylk point
That her abydyng is conioynte
For with the body for to dwell
That one desires toward the hell
That other upward unto heaven
So should they never stond in en^n
But if the flesh be overcome
And that the soul have holy nome
The governance and that is selde
While that the ^^esshe may he welde
Al crthely thing which god began
Wao only made to serve man
But the soul al only made
Him seluen for to serve and glade
And other beestes that men find
They serve unto her own kind
But to reason the soul serves
Whereof the man his thonke deserves
And get him with his works good
The perdurable syues food
hIc loquitur vlterius de diuisione terre. ^ue post deluuium t^bus filijes Noe
in tres parts seilicet Asiam / aff^^cam and Europam diuidebatur

oF that matter it shall be told
A tale lyketh many fold
The better if it be spoke pleyne
Thus (...) I for to torn again
And tell pleynly therefore
Of the earth / whereof now to fore
I spoke and of the waters eke
So as these old clerks speak
And set propyrly the bound
After the form of mappamounde
Thorugh which ye greu^d in parties
Departed is in three parties
That is Asye / Affryke / Europe
The which under the heaven cope
Beg^ypeth all this earth round
As serre as stretches any ground
But after that the hyhe wreche
The water weyes let out feche
And over goo the hills hye
Which every kind made dye
That upon myddel earth stood
Out take Noe / and his blood
His sone and his daughters three
They were save / and so was he
Her names who that read right
Sem / Came / Iaphet / the brethren hit
And when thylk almighty hand
Withdre we the water fro the land
And all the rage was away
And earth was the man's weye
The sons three / of which I told
Right after that them self would
This world depart they begone
Asia the which lies to the son
Upon the march of Oryent
Was granted by a comune assent
To whom which was sone oldest
For that party was the best
And double as much as other two
And was that time bounded so
Where as ye flode which me^ nyle calls
Departed fro his course and falls
In the sea Alle^andryne
There takes Asye first sesyne
Toward the west. and over this
Of Cana him where the flood is
In to the great see rennende
Fro that in to the worlds end
After Asy it is algates
Till that men comen unto the gates
Of paradys and there hoo
And shortly for to speak it so
Of Oryent in general
Within his bound Assy has all^
Nota hic de Africa et Europa

And than upon that other side
Westward as it fell thylk tide
The brother which hyghte came
Upon his part Affryke nam
Iaphet Europe tho took he
Thus par^^d they the world in thr^
But yet there ben of lands feel
In occident as for the chele
In oryent as for the hete
Which of the people be forlete
As land deserte that is unable
For it may not be erable
Nota de mare quod magnum Occeanum diatur

The water eke has sundry bound
After the land where it is found
And takes his name of thylk lands
Where that it run on the strondes
But thylke see which no wane
Is cleped the great Occeane
Out of which arise and come
The hye floodes al and some
Is none so little well spryng
Which there ne takes his beginning
Lyche a man that haleth brethe
By wey of kind so it gethe
Out of the sea / and in again
The water as the books seyne
Nota hic secundum philosophum de quinto elemento quod omnia sub celo creata
infra suu^ ambitum continet cui nome^ orbis specialiter appropriatu^ e^

oF elements the propyrtees
How yt they sto^den vy degrees
As I have told now myt you here
My good soon all the matere
Of earth / of water air and fire
And for thou seist that thy desire
Is for to wyten ouermore
The form of Aristotle's lore
He sees in his entendement
That yet there is an element
Above the four / and is the fyfthe
Set of the high gods yefte
The which that orbis cleped is
And thereupon he tells this
That as the shelle hole and sound
Encloseth al about round
What thing within an eye belongs
Right so this orbis vnderfongeth
These elements euerychone
Which I baue spoke of one and one
But over this now take good head
My sone for I wol proceed
To speken upon Mathematyst
Which grounded is on Theoryk
The science of Astronomye
I think for to specyfye
Without which to tell pleyne
Al other science is in vein
Toward the scole of crthely things
For as an egle with his wings
Flees above that al men find
So does this science in his kind
Lege planetarum magis magis in feria reguntur / Ista sed incedum regu la
fallit opus / Vir mediante deo sapi^^s dominabitur astris / Fata nec inmerit^
quod nouitatis agunt /

Hic loquitur de artis Mathematice quarta specie que astronomia nuncupatur /
cui eciam Astrologia socia connumeratur / Sed primo de septe^ planetis que
inter astra potenciores existunt Incipiendo a linea seorsum tractare intendit

bynethe upon this earth here
Of al things the matere
As tellen us they yt ben learned
Of thing above it stonte governed
That is to seyen of the planetes
The cheles both and eke the hetes
The chamber of the world also
That we fortune clepen so
Among the men's nation
All is thorugh constellacion
Whereof that sum man has the well
And sum men have dyseses feel
In love as well as other things
The state of reames and of kings
In time of pees / in time of werre
It is conceived of the sterre
And thns says the naturyen
Which is an Astronomyen
But the dyuyne seith other wise
That if men were good and wise
And plesaunt unto the godhede
They should not the sterres dread
For one man if him well befalle
Is more worth than they be all
Toward him that weldeth all
But yet the law orygenalle
Which he bath set in the natures
More worchen in creatures
That thereof may be none obstacle
But if it stant upon miracle
Thorugh prayer of sum holy man
And for thy so as I bigan
To speak upon astronomye
As it is write in the clergy
To tell how the planetes fare
Sum part I think to declare
My sone unto thy audyence
Astronomye is the seyence
Of wys^dom and of his connyng
Which makes a man have knowleching
Of sterres in the firmament
Figure ^^res^ and mocment
Of each of him in sundry place
And what ^irwene hem is of space
(...) so the moon stant fast
(...) at the last
(...) with Astronomye
I (...) that (...) Astrologye
^^^ which in jugement acompteth
T^^ (...) what every sterre amounts
And (...) they causen many a wonder
To the clymates that stant under
And for to tell it more pleyne
T^^s^ (...) ^^ philosophres seyne
That (...) which I spak of er
^^ that which the earth a fer
(...)t and fi^^^ament it call
In which the sterres stonden all
Among the which in speaalle
Plenctes seven pryncipalle
There ben that manues sight demeth
But thorugh out as us seems
And also there ben signs twelve
Which have these clerkis by hem selue
Compassed in the ^odyak
In which they have her places take
And as they stonden in degree
Here cercles more or less be
Made after the proporcion
Of the earth whoos condition
Is set to be fundament
To sustain up the firmament
And by this skylle a man may know
The more that they stonden low
The more ben the Cercles less
That canseth why that sum pass
Her due course to fore another
But now my lyeue dear brother
As thou desivest for to wit
What I find in the books write
To tell the of planetes seven
How that they stond upon the heaven
And in what point that they ben in
Take heed for I will begin
So as the philosopher it taught
To Alysander and he it raught
Whereof that he was full betaught
Of wysedom which was him betaut
Nota hic de prima planeta que alnes inferior luna dicitur

Bynethe al other stont ye moan
Which has with ye see to done
Of stoodes high and ^bbes low
Upon his change it shall be know
And every fysshe which has a schelle
Mo^e in his governance dwell
To weye and wane in his degree
As by the moon a man may see
And all that stont upon the ground
Of his moisture it must be found
Al other sterres as men find
By shynyng of her own kind
Out take only the moon light
Which is not of him self bright
But as he takes it of the son
And yet he has not al full won
His light that he nys somdele derke
But what the let is of that werk
In all mageste it tells this
The mones Cercle so low is
Whereof the son out of stage
He sees him not with full vysage
For he with ground so shaded
That the moon is somdele faded
And may not fulle shine clear
But what man under his powere
Is bore / he shall his places change
And seche many lands strange
And of his condycyon
The mones disposicion
Upon the land of Almayne
Is set and eke upon britayne
Which now is cleped England
For they travail in every land
De secunda planeta que Mercurius diciture

Of the planetes the second
Above the moon has take his bond
Mercurye and his nature is this
That under him who that bore is
In book he shall be studyous
And in writing curyous
And slouthe and lustles in travail
In thing which else might avail
He loves ese he loves rest
So is he not the worthyest
But yet with somdele business
His heart is set upon richesse
And as in this condycion
The effect and disposicion
Of this planete of his chance
Is most in Burgoyne and in France
De tercia planeta que Venus dicitur

Next to Mercurye as will befalle
Stant the planets which men call
Venus whoos constellacion
Governs all the nation
Of loves whether they speed or none
Of which I trow thou be one
But whether ward thy happes wend
Shall this planete she we at end
As it has do to many mo
To sum well / to sum woo
And netheles of this planete
The most party is soft and sweet
For who that thereof takes his birth
He shall desire joy and myrthe
Gentyl curtoys and debonayre
To speak his words soft and fair
Snche shall he be by wey of kind
And ouerall where he may find
Plesaunce of love his heart loves
With all his myt / and there he woweth
He is so ferforth amerous
He note what thing is vycyo^^s
Touching for that law
There may no manner man withdraw
The which Veneryen is bore
By wey of kind / and therefore
Venus of love the goddess
Is cleped but of wantonness
The clymate of her lecherye
Is most comune in lumbardye
Nota de sole qui medio planetaram residens Astrorum principatum obtinet

Next unto the planetes of love
The bright son stont above
Which is the hynderer of the night
And f^rthereth of the days light
As he which is the worlds ^ye
Thorugh whom the lusty company
Of fowls by the morol^e sing
The fresshe flowers sprede and spryng
The hye tree the ground beshadeth
And every man's heart gladeth
For it is the head planete
Now that he sytteth in his sete
Of what richesse and what nobleye
These books tell and thus they seye
Nota de curru solis necnon de eius them apparatu /

oF gold glispering spole and whele
The son his carte has fair and well /
In which he sytteth and is coroned
With bright stones enuyroned
Of which if that I speak shall
There be to fore in specialle
Set in the frounte of his corone
H^^ stones which no person
Has upon earth / and the first is
By name cleped Lycuthis
That other two ben cleped thus
Astryces and Seramyus
In his Corone also behind
By old books as I find
There ben of worthy stones three
Set each of his degree
Whereof a Cristal is that one
Which that Coroune it set vpone
The second is an admaunt
The third is noble and aduenaunt
Which cleped is ydryates
And over this yet netheles
^o^^n the sides of the werk
After the writing of the clerk
There sit / ^ / stones ^^o
The smaragdyne is one of tho
^os^^s and Elithropius
And dendydes and Iacinctus
Loo thus the Corowne is byset
Whereof it shyneth well the bet
And in such wise his light to sprede
Sit with his Dyademe on his head
The son shynyng in his carte
And for to lead him swythe and smarte
After the bright days law
There ben ordained for to draw
Four horses his chare and him with all
Whereof the names tell I shall
Ertheus the first is hot
The which is tede shynyng hot
The second acteos the bright
Lamps the third horse hight
And philogeus is the ferth
That brings light in to this earth
And gone so swyft upon the heaven
In four and twenty hours even
The carte with the bright son
They draw so that over run
They have under the Cercles high
Al myddel earth in such an high
And thus the son is oueral
The chyef planete Imperial
Above him / and bynethe him three
And thus bitwene tweyne renneth he
As he that has the myddel place
Among the seven and of the face
Be glad al erthely creatures
And taken after the natures
Here ease and recreacion
And in his Constellacion
He that is bore in special
Of good will and of lyberall
He shall ^e found in all place
And also stonden in myddel grace
Toward the lords for to serve
And great profit and thonke deserve
And over that it causes yet
A man to be subtyle of wit
To worche in gold to be wise
In every thing that is of pryse
But for to speken in what Coost
Of all this earth he regneth most
As for wysedom it is in greece
Where is appropred thylke spece
Nota de quinta planeta que mars dicitur

Mars the planete batayllous
Next to the son glorious
Above stant and does meruaylles
Upon the fortune of batayles
The Conquerours by days old
Were unto this planete hold
But who that his natyuyte
Has taken upon the propyrte
Of Martes disposicion
By weye of constellacion
He shall be fers and full hastyf
And desirous of werre and strif
But for to tell redyly
In what clymate most contynuelly
That this planete has his affect
Said is that he has his aspect
Upon the holy land so cast
That there is no pees steadfast
Nota de sexta planeta que Iubiter dicitur

Above mars upon the heaven
The sixthe planete of the seven
Stant Iubiter he delycate
Which causes pees and no debate
For he is cleped that planete
Which of his kind cold and heete
Attempreth all that to him longs
And whom this planete vnderfongeth
To stand upon his raiment
He shall be meke and pacyent
And fortunate to marchaundye
And lusty to delycacye
In every thing which he shall d^
This Iubiter is cause also
Of the science of high works
And in this wise tellen clerks
He is the planete of delyces
But in Egypt of his offices
He renneth most in specialle
For there be lusts oueralle
Of all that to this life befalls
For there no stormy weder falls
Which might grieve man or be
And ^^e the land is so honest
That it is plentyuous and pleyne
There is no ydell ground in vein
And upon such felycite
Stant Iubiter in his degree
De septima planeta que reliquis celcior Saturuus dictus est

The highest and abouen all
Stant the planete which men call
Saturnus whose complexion
Is cold and his condition
Causes malice and cruelte
To him whoos natyuyte
Is set under his governance
For all his works ben greuaunce
And enemy to man's hele
In what degree that he shall dele
His clement is the oryent
Where that he is most vyolent
Of the planetes by and by
How that they stand upon the sky
Fro point to point as thou myt here
Was Alysander made to lere
But over this touching his lore
Of thing that they him taught more
Upon the scoles of Clergy
Now harken the philosophy
Postquam dictum est de septem planet^s quibus sigule septimane dies sin
gulariter attitulantur dicendum est ^a^ de duodecim signis / per quem duodecim
me^ses anni varijs temporibus effectus varijs assecuutur

He which departed day fro night
That one derk / and that other light
Of seven days made a wyke
A month of four wekes eke
He has ordained in his law
Of months xij and eke forth draw
He has also the long year
And as he set of his powere
Accordaunt to the days seven
Planetes seven upon the heaven
As thou to fore host herd deuyse
To speak right in such a wise
To every month by him selue
Upon the heaven of signs twelve
He has after his ordynalle
Assigned one in specialle
Whereof so as I shall reherce
The tides of the year diverse
But pleynly for to make it know
How that the signs set arowe
Each after other by degree
In substance and in propyrte
The ydyote comprehends
Within his Cercle it appendeth
Nota hic de primo signo quod Aries diatur / cuius me^sis specialiter mar (...)

The which of the first netheles
By name is cleped Aryes
Which lyche a wether of stature
Resembled is in his figure
And as it is said in almageste
Of sterres twelve upon the best
Been set / whereof in his degree
The w^^e has two / the head has three
The tail has seven / and in this wise
As thou might here me deuyse

The world when that he made man
And of his constellacion
The very operacion
Avails if a man therein
The purpoos of his work bigyn
For than he has of propyrte
Good speed and felycyte
The twelve months of the year
Attytled under the powere
Of these twelve signs stand
Whereof that thou shall understand
This Aryes one of the twelve
Has march attitled for him selue
When every byrd shall chese his make
That every Adder and every, suake
And every reptyle which may move
His might assayeth for to prove
To crepen out against the son
When vere his season has begone

To Venus somdele discordaunt
This boole is eke with sterres set
Through which he has his horns knee
Unto the tail of Aryes
So is he not there sterreles
Upon his breast eyghten
He has and eke as it is seen
Upon his tail stante there other more
His monethe assigned eke also
Is aureel which of show^es
Mynystreth wey unto the flowers
Tercium signum dicitur gemini c^^ ^us mensis mayus est Quo volucrum cantus
gaudet de floribus cetis

The third sign is gemyny
Which is figured redyly
Lyche to the twynnes of one kyn^e
That naked stonden / and as I find
They ben with sterres well y goo
The head has part of thylke two
That shine upon the booles tail
So ben they both of one paray^e
But of the womle of gemini
Ben five sterres not for thy
And eke upon the feet ben tw^^
And so these old books seye
That wise tholemeus wrote
His propre monthe well I wot
Assygned is the lusty may
When every brydde upon his lay
Emonge the grene leaves syngeth
And love of his poynture styngeth
After the laws of nature
The yongthe of every creature
Quartum signum cancer dicitur cuius mensis iunius est / Quo falcat pra^is
pabula tonsor equis

Cancer after the rule of space
Of signs hold the first place
Like to the crabbe he has resemblau^ce
And has unto his retynaunce
Xvj sterres whereof ten
So as these old wise men
Discr^ueth bears on him tofore
And in the myddel two ben bore
And iiij he has upon his end
Thus goes he sterred in his kind

And does what longs him to done
The monthe of June unto this sign
Thou shall after the rule assygne
Quintum signum leo dicitur cuius mensis Julius est

The fyfthe sign is leo hot
Whose kind is shape both dry and hot
In whom the son has herbegage
And the semblaunce of his image

Of stertes has his purpartye
The four which as cancer has
Upon his end leo tath
Upon his heed and than next
He has eke four upon his breast
And upon his tail behind
In old books as we find
His propre month is Iule by name
In which men playen many a game
Sextum signum virgo dicitur cuius mensis augustus dicitur / Quo vacuata prius
pubes replet horrea messis

After leo virgo next
Of signs cleped is the sexte
Whereof the figure is a maid
And as the phylosophre said
She is the welthe and the rysyng
The lust the joy and the lykyng
Unto mercurye and sothe to say
She is with sterres well besaye
Whereof leo has lent her one
Which set on hye her heed upon
Her womb has v / her feet also

First three and eke his womb has two
And down benethe viij other to
The sign is hot and moist both
The which things be not loathe
Unto Venus so that a lofte
She rests in his hows full often
And eke saturnus often hyed

His propre monthe is said septembre
Which yeueth men cause to remember
If any sore be left behind
Of thing which grieve may by kind
Octau^m signu^ soorpio dicitur cuius mensis octobris est / Floribus ^xclusis
yemps qui ^auitor extat

Among the signs upon heyghte
The sign which nombred is eyghte
Is soorpyo which as felon
Fygured to a soorpyon
But for all that nevertheless
Is soorpyo yet not sterlesse
For libra grants him his end
Of vin sterres where he wend
T^^ which upon his heed assysed
He bears and three eke ben devised
Upon his womb sterres three
And v^^ upon his tail has he
Which of kind is moist and cold
And vnbehouely many a fold
He ba^meth venus and empe^reth
But mars unto his hows repeyreth
But ware wha^ they to gyder dwellen
His propre monthe is as men t^llen
O^to^ re which brings the kalende
Of winter that comes next suende

And vii^ of other stonden even
Upon his womb and other seven

And he is hot and dry of kind
To jubyter his hows is free
But to marcurye in his degree
For they be not of one assent
He wercheth great empeyrement
This sign to his properte
A month which of his deute
After the seson that befalls
The plough ox in winter stalleth
After fire in to the halle it brings
And ^ke of which men syngeth
He torneth must in to the wine
Than is the larde of the swyne
That is nouembre which I mean
When that the leef has lost his grene
Decimum signu^ capricornius vicitur cuius mensis decembris est ipse diem nauo
nectem que giganti figurat

The x sign dry and cold
The which is capricornus cold
Unto a ghoot has resemblaunce
For whose love and acquaintance
Within his hows to sorourne
It likes unto satourne
But unto the moon it likes naught
For no prouffyte is there wrought
The sign as of his propyrte
Upon his heed has sterres three
And eke upon his womb two
And two upon his tail also
Decembre after the years form
So as the books us inform

In either hand a water spoute
Whereof the stremes rennen out
He is of kind moist and hot
And he that of the sterres wot
Seyth that he has of sterres two
Upon his heed and ben of ^ho

And as the books maken mind
That tholomeus made him self

And two upon his end stand
Thou shall also understand
Tho frosty cold ryuere
When comen is the new year
That ^anus with double face
In his chayer has take his place
And looks upon both sides
Sum dele toward the winter tides
Sum dele to ward the year suyng
That is the monthe bylongyng
Unto this sign and of his dole
Ye yeueth the first prymerole
Duo decimum signum psicis dicitue cuius mensis februarius est* Quo pluuie
torrens riparum concitat ampnes

The xi^ sign is last of all
Of signs pisces men it call
The which is as tells the scripture
Beteth of two fysshes the figure
So is he cold and moist of kind
And eke with sterres as I find
Beset in son^ry wise as thus
Two of his end aquarius
Has lent unto his heed and two
This sign has of his own also
Upon his womb and over this
Upon his end also there is
A nombre of xx sterres right
Which is to seen wonder sight
Toward this sign in to his house
Comes ^ubyter glorious
And venus eke with him accords
To dwellen as the book records
The month but to this sign ordeyneth
Is february which be reyned
And with land flodes in his rage
That fordes lets the passage
Now have thou herd the properte
Of signs but in this degree
Albumazare yet over this
Seyth so as the earth parted is
In four right so ben devised
The signs twelve and stand assised
That each of hem in his party
Has his clymate to ^ustefye
Whereof the first regyment
Toward the part of orryent
From antioche and that contre
Governed is of signs three
That is cancer virgo leo
And toward thoc^^dent also
From Armenye as I am learned
Of capricorn it stant governed
Of piscis and aquarius
And after hem I find thus
Southward fro alisaunder forth
Tho signs which most ten worth
In governance of that dayayre
Librn they ben and sagittayre
With soorpyo which is conioynt
With hem and stante upon the point
Of constantynople the cite
So as the books tallen me
The last of this dyuysion
Stant outward septemtryon
Where as by weye of pourue^un^e
Aryes has the governance
Forth with Taurus and gemini
Thus ben the signs propirly
Divided as it is ^hersed
Whereof the lands ben dyuersed
Loo thus my sone as thou might here
Was Alysander made to lere
Of hem that werken for his lore
But now to loken ouermore
Of other sterres how they fare
I think herafter for to declare
So as king Alysander in youth
Of hem that such things couthe
Informed was tofore his eye
By night upon the sterres hyhe
Hic tractat super doctrina Nectanabi / dum ipse Iuuenem Allexandrum instruxit
de illis precipue quindecim stellis vna eorum lapidibus et herbis ^ue ad artis
Magice naturalis operaci onem specialius conueniunt

Upon sundry creacion
Stant sundry operacion
Some worth this some worth
that / The fire is hot in his estat
And brenneth what he may attryne
The water may the fire restreyne
The which is cold and moist also
Of other thing it fares also
Upon the earth among us here
And for to speak in this manner
Upon the heaven as men may find
There sterres ben of sundry kind
And worchen many sundry things
To be that been her underlings
Among the which forth with all
Nectanabus in specialle
Which was an Astronomyen
And eke a great magycyen
And undertake has thylke empryse
To Alysander in his appryse
As of magyke naturele
To know informed hem somdele
Of certain sterres what they mean
Of which he seith th^^ ben fyftene
And sonderly to euerychone
A gras belongs and a stone
Whereof men worchen many a wonder
To set thing loathe up and under
Prima stella vocatur Alde^oran / cuius carbunculus et herba anabulla est

To tell right as he bigan
The first sterre Alde^oran
The clerest and the most of all
By right name men it call
Which is of condition

To Venus and has thereupon
Carbuncle his propre stone
His herb is anabulla named
Which is of great virtue proclaimed
Secunda stella vocatur Clota seu pliades cuins lapis cristallum et herba
funiculus est

The second is not vertules
Clota or else plyades
Is hot and of the mones kind
He is and also this I find
He takes of mars complexion
And lyche to such condition
His stone appropred is Cristalle
And eke his herb in specialle
The virtuous Fenel it is
The thyrdde which comes after this
Tercia stella vocatur Algol* cuius la pis Diamans et herba Eleborum nigrum est

Is hot Algol the clear read
Which of Saturn as I may t^de
His kind takes and eke of Io^e
Complexion to his beloue
His propre stone is Dyamant
Which is to him most acordaunt
His herb which is him betake
Is hot E^^^pum the blake
Quarta stella vocatur Alhaiot / cuius lapis ^aphi^s et herba maribium est

So as it falls upon ^^tte
The fourth sterre is Albaiotte
Which in the wise as I said et
Of saturn and of ^ubiter
Has take his kind and thereupon
Sapphire is his propre stone
Ma^bium his herb also
The which acorden to the two
Quint^ stella vocatut canis mator cu
ius lapis ber^^^us et herba sauina est
And canis mayor in his like
The fifth sterre is of magyke
The whoos kind is veneryen
As seith this Astronomyen
His propre stone is said beryll
But for to worche and to fulfylle
Thing which to this science falls
There is an herb which men calls
Saueyne / and that he behooves need
To him that wol his purpoos speed
Sexta stella vocatur canis minor cuius lapis Arc^ates et herba primula est

The sixth sewyng after this
By name canis minor is
The which sterre is mer^^ryall
By wey of kind and forth with all
As it is written in the carte
Complexion he takes of mart
His stone and herb as seith the scole
B^^ Achat^s and prymerole
Septima stella vocatur A^a^ / cuius lapis garg^^^^^ and herba c^^idonia est

The right sterre in special
Of this seyence is Ariall
Which sundry nature vndersongeth
The stone which propre unto him lo^geth /
Gargonaza propyrly it hight
His herb also which he shall right
Upon the worchyng as I mean
Is selidone fresshe and grene
Octaua stella vocatur Ala corui cuius lapis honochinus et herba lappacia est

Sterre ala corui upon heyght
Has take his place in no^bre of eight
Which of his kind must perform
The will of mart and of saturn

Is herb but no beyete
His stone is Honochinus hot
Thorugh which me^ worchen great ryote
Nona stella vocatur Alaezel / cuius lapis Smaragdis et herba salgea est

The nynthe sterre fair and well
By name is hot Alaezele

Take of Venus and of the moon
In thing which he has for to done
Of Adamaunt is that perrye
In which he worcheth his maystrye
Thylke herb also which him befalls
Cicorea the book it calls
Duodecima stella vocatur Alpheta cu ius lapis topasyon et hetha rosamari na
est*

Alpheta in the nombre sit
And is the twelft sterre yet
Of Scorpio which is governed
And takes his kind as I am learned
And has his virtue in the stone
Which cleped is Topasione
His herb his propre rosemaryne
Which shapen is for his couyne
Tercia decima stella vocatur cor scorpionis / cuius lapis Sardis et herba as
trilogie est

Of these sterres which I mean
Cor Scorpionis is the thyrtene
The whoos nature mart and Jove
Have youen unto his behoue
His herb is Astrologye
Which follows his Astronomye
The stone which that this sterre allows /
Is Sardys which to him loweth /
Quarte decima vocatur botercadent cuius lapis Crisolitus et herba saturea est

The sterre which stant next to the last
Nature of him this name cast
And cleped him botercadent
Which of his kind is obedyent
Unto Mercurye and to Venus
His stone is called Crisolitus
His herb is cleped Satureye
So as these old books seye
Quinta decima stella vocatur cauda scorpionis / cuius lapis calcidonia et
herba maiorana dicitur

But now the last sterre of all
The tail of scorpio men call
Which to Mercurye and to Saturn
By wey of kind mote return
After the preparacion
Of due constellacion
The calcidome unto him longs
Which for his stone he vnderfongeth
Of maioron his herb is founded
Thus have I said how they be grounded
Of every sterre in specialle
Which has his herb and stone with all
As Hermes in his looks old
Witness bears of that I told
Nota hic de auctoribus illis qui ad Astronomy scienciam pre ceteris studi
oflus intendentes libros super hoc distinctis nominibus composuerunt

The science of Astronomye
Which pryncipalle is of clergy
To deny bitwene woe and well
In things that been naturele
They had a great trauaill on hand
That made it first he understand
And they also which evermore
Her study set upon this lore
They worden gracious and wise
And worthy for to bear a pryse
And whom hit lyketh for to wit
Of hem that this science write
One of the first which it wrote
After Noe it was Nembrote
To his disciple Ychonyton
And made a book forth theru^pon
The which magastre eleped was
Another Auctor in this cas
Is Arachell the which men note
Which a clerk know mote
Dane tholome is not the leest
Which makes the book of alma^^est
And Affraganus does the same
Whoos book Cathenus by name
Gebus and Alpetragus eke
Of palmesta which men seek
The books made / and over this
Full many a worthy clerk is
That written upon the clergy
The books of Aldemetry
Pal nestry and eke also
Which as belonging both two
So as they ben naturyens
Unto these Astronomyens
Men seyn that Abraham was one
Bnt whether that he wrote or none
That find I not and Moses
Eke was another but Hermes
Above al other in this science
He had a great experyence
Thoaigh him were many a sterre assised /
Whoos books ben yet auctorysed
I may not known all tho
That written in the time tho
Of this science / but I find
Of Judgment by wey of kind
That in one point thry al accorden
Of sterees which they recorden
That men may see upon the heaven
There ben a thousand sterres even
And two and twenty to the sight
Which ben of hem self so bright
That men may deem what they be
The nature and the propyrte
Now bast thou herd in such a wise
These noble philosophres wise
Informed this young king
And made him have a knowlechyng
Of thing which first the party
Belongs of philosophye
Which Rethoryke cleped is
As thou to fore have herd or this
But now to speak of the second
Which Aristotle bath so fond
'And techeth how to speak fair
Which is a thing full necessaire
The counterpeyse the balaunce
Where lacks other suffisaunce
Compositi pulcra sermones verba placere / Principio poterunt vera q fine
placent, Herba lapis sermo tria su^t virtute plato Vis tamen ex verbi pon dear
plura facit

Hic tractat de secunda part philosophy / cuius nomen Rethorica facundos
efficit / loquitur eciam de eiusdem duabus speciebus / scilicet gramatica
logica quacum doctrina Rethorica sua verba perornat

Above all erthely creatures
The which maker of natures
The world to man has given alone
So that the speech of his person
Or for to lose or for to win
The hertes thought which is within
May show what it would mean
And that is nowhere else seen
Of kind with none other be
So should he be the more honest
To whom god has so great gift
And look well that he ne shyft
His words to noue wicked bse
For word the techer of vertuse
Io cleped in philosophy
Whereof touching this party
Is Rethoryke the science
Appropred to the reverence
Of words that been reasonable
And for this art shall be vaylable
With goodly words for to like
It has grammar / it has logyke
That seruen both unto the speech
Gramer has first for to teache
To speak upon congruyte
Logyke has eke in his degree
Bitwene the truth and the falshede
The pleyne words for to shede
So that no thing shall goo beside
That he the right shall not decyde
Whereof full many a great debate
Reformed is to good estate
And pees sustained upon lofte
With easy words and with soft
Where strength should let it fall
The philosophre among all
For they commenden this science
Which has the rewle of eloquence
In stone and gras virtue there is
But yet the books tellen this
That word about al erthely things
Is virtuous in his doings
Where so it be euylle or good
For if the words semen good
And ben well spoke at man's ere
When that there is no truth there
They done full often full great deceyte
For when the word to the conceyte
Discordeth in so double wise
Such Rethoryke is to despise
In every place and for to dread
For Plyxes thus I read
And in the book of Troy is found
His eloquence and his faconde
Of goodly words which he told
Has made that Anthenor him sold
The town which he with treson wan
Word has begyled many a man
With word the wyld be is dau^ted
With word the serpent is enchaunted
Of word among the men of arms
Ben wounds heled with the charms
Words ben virtuous and fine
Where lacks other medycyne
Of sorcery the carectes
The words ben of sundry sects
Of euylle and eke of good also
The words maken friend and foo
Of foo a friend and pees of werre
And werre of pees and out of herre
The word the worlds cause entryketh
And reconcyleth whom him lyketh
The word under the cope of heaven
Set every thing or odd or even
With word the hyhe god is plesyd
With word the worlds ben apesed
The soft word the loud stylleth
Where lacks good yt word futfylloth
To make amends for the wrong
When words medlen with the song
It does plesaunce well the more
But for to look upon this lore
How Tullius his Rethoryke
Compouneth there a man may pyke
How that he shall his words set
How he shall loose how he shall knet
And in what wise he shall pronounce
His tale pleyne without frounce
Whereof ensample if thou wylt seche
Take heed and read whi^ome the speech
Nota de eloquencia Iulij in causa Cateline contra Tilenum et alios tunc vrbis
Roman continentes

oF Julius and Cithero
Which consul was of rome tho
Of Caton eke and Tillene
Behold the words hem bit wene
When the treson of Catelyne
Discovered was and the couyne
Of hem that were of his assent
Was know and spoke in parliament
And asked how and in what wise
Men should done hem to Iewyse
Cillenus first his tale told
And as he was to truth behold
The common proufite for to save*
He said treson should have
A cruel death* and thus they speak
The consul both and Caton eke
And saiden that for such a wrong
There may no pain be to strong
But Julius with words wise
His tale told al other wise
As he which would his death respite
And foundeth how he might excyte
The Iuges thorugh his eloquence
Fro death to torn the sentence
And set her hertes to pity
Now told they / now cold he
They speken plain after the law
But he the words of his saw
Colored in another wey
Spekyng / and thus bitwene the swey
To trece upon this Judgment
Made each of hem his argument
Whereof the tales for to lere
There may a man the scole here
Of Rethoryke the eloquence
Which is the second of science
Touching to philosophye
Whereof a man shall justifye
His words in disputacion
And knytt upon conclusion
His argument in such a form
Which may the pleyne troth inform
And the subtle cautele abate
Which every true man shall debate
Peacticat quemq statum pars tercia philosophy / Ad regimen recte donec in
orb vie / Set quanto mayor rex est / tanto magis ipsum* Ex scola concernit qua
sua regna regat /

Hic tractat de tercia part philosophy que practica vocatur* cuius species
sunt tres, scilicet Ethica Iconomia et policia / quarum doctrina regia
inagestas in suo regimine ad honoris magnificenciam per singula dirigitur

tHe first which theoryk
And the second Rethoryke
Scyences of philosophy
I have hem told as in party
So as the philosophre it told
To Alysander and now I would
Tell of the thirdde what it is
The which practyke cleped is
Practyke stant upon three things
To ward the governance of kings
Whereof the first Etyke is named
The whoos seyence stant proclaimed
To trehe of virtue thylke rule
How that a king him self shall rule
Of his moral condition
With worthy disposicion
Of good living in his person
Which is the chyef in his corone
It makes a king also to learn
How he his body shall govern
How he shall wake how he shall sleep
How that he shall his hele keep
In mete in drink in clothing eke
There is no wisdom for to seek
As for the reule of his person
Which this science al one
Ne techeth as by wey of kind
That there nothing leave behind
That other point which to practyke
Belongs to Iconomyke
Which techeth thylke honest
Thorugh which a king in his degree
His wife and child shall rule and gy
So ferforth all the company
Which in his household should abide
And his estate on every side
In such manner for to lead
That he his household not myslede
Practyke has yet the thyrdde appryse
Which techeth how and in what wise
Thorugh hyhe purueyed ordinance
A king shall set in gouernannce
His reame. and that is pollycye
Which longs unto regalye
In time of werre / in time of pees
To worship and to god encrees
Of clerk of knight of Marchaunte
And so forth of the remenaunt
Of all the common people about
Within borgh and eke without
Of hem that been artificers
Which vsen craft and mysters
Whoos art is cleped Mathematyke
And though they be not all like
Yet nevertheless how so it fall
One law mote govern hem all
Or that they lose or that they wyn
After the state that they ben in
Loo thus the worthy young king
Was fully laughed of every thing
Which might give entendement
Of good rule and of good regem^t
Is such a worthy prince as he
But of verry necessite
The philosophre him has bitake
Five points which he has vnderta^e /
Took and hold in obseruaunce
^fore the worthy governance
Which longs to his regalye
After the rule of polycye
Moribus ornatus regit hic qui reg^^ moderna / Tercius exspectat / cep^^^ ntura

^O every man behooves lore
But to no man belongs more
Than to a king which has to (...) /
The people for his knyghthede
He may hem both save and spylle
And for it stont upon his will
It sit him well to be auysed
And the virtues which ben assised
Unto a kings regement
To take his entendement
Whereof to tellen as they stand
Herafterward now wol I fond
Among the vertuce one is chyef
And that is truth which is lyef
To god and eke to man also
And for it has been ever so
Taught Aristotle as it is couthe
To A^^sandre as he well couthe
He should of truth thylke grace
with all his heart enbrace
So that his heart be true and pleyne
Toward the world and so certain
That in him he no double speech
For if men should truth seche
And find it not within a king
It were full unsitting thing
The word is token of that within
There shall a worthy king begin
To keep his tongue and to be true
So shall his price ben ever new
Auyse him every man to fore
And be well ware or he be swore
For afterward it is to late
If that he would his word debate
For as a king in special
A^^ue all other in pryncipal
Of his power so should he be
Most virtuous in his degree
And that may be well signefyed
By his croune and specifyed
Not^ super hijs que Corona Regis designatur

The gold betokens excellence
That men should done him reverence
A^ to her lyege sovereign
The stones as the books sayn^
Commended ben in trouble wise
First they ben hard and thylke assise
Betokens a kyngis constaunce
So that there shall no varyaunce
Be found in his condtcion
And also by descripcion
The virtue which is in the stones
A very sign is for the nones
Of that a king shall be honest
And hold true his byheste
Of thing which longs to knygthede
The bright color as I read
which is in the stones shynyng
Is in fignre betokenyng
The Cronyke of his worlds fame
which stant upon his good name
The Ce^^le which is round about
Is token of all the ^onde without^
Which stant under his Ierarchye
That he it well shall keep and guye
And for that truth how it fall
Is virtue sovereign oue^alle
That longed unto regyment
A tale which is euydent
Of truth in commendacion
Toward thyn ^^formacion
My sone herafter thou shall here
Of a Cronyke in this ma^^r^
As the Cronyke it does wherce
A sultan whi^^me was of perse
Which daryes hight and y^aspis
His fader was and soothe it is
Of hie lygnage and by discente
The regne of thylke empire he hent
That thorugh wisdom and hy^e prudence
More than by other reverence
And for he was him self wise
The wise men he held in pryse
And sought hem out on every side
That toward him they should abide
Among the which three there were
That must service unto him bear
As they which in his chamber leyn^
And al his counceylle herd and seyne
Here names ben of strange note
Arphages was the first hot
And Monachas was the second
Zorababel as it is found
In the Cronyke was the thyrdde
This Sultan what so him betyde
To hem he tri^t most of all^
Whereof the cause is so bifalle
This lord / which has conceytes deep
Upon a night when he should sleep
As he which has his wits disposed
Touching a point hem has opposed
Hic na^^at qualiter Darius filius Itaspis soldanus percie a tribus suis
cubicularibus / qu^^um nomina A^phag^s / Monachas et Zorobabel / dicta sunt

a^cepta^atur

tHe kings question was this
Of things which strengest is
The win the woman or yt king
And that they should upon this thing
Of her answer auysed be
He gaf hem days fully three
And has bihote hem by his feyth
That who so best reason seith
He shall receive a worthy mede
Upon this thing they token head
And studied on disputacion
That they by diverse opinion
Of arguments that they hold
Arphages first his tale told
And said how yt the strength of kings
Is myghtyest of al things
For king has power over man
And man is which reason can
As he which is of his nature
The most noble creature
Of all tho that god has wrought
And by that skylle it seems naught
He seith that any ^rthely thing
May be so mighty as a king
A king may spylle a kyng^e may save
A king may make a lord a knave
And of a knave a lord also
The power of a king stondeth so
That he the laws over passes
What he will make less he it lasseth
What he wol make more he moreth
He sleeth that no man it restores
But he alone al other tameth
Who him displeseth he grameth
And stant him self of law fre
Loo this is a kings might seith he
So as his reason can argue
Is strengest and of most valewe
But Monachas seith other wise
That wine is of the more empryse
And that he shows by this wey
The wine full often takes awey
The reason fro the man's heart
The wyn can make a crepul stert^
And ^^^^lyuer man vnwylde
It makes a blind man to behylde
And a bright eye sometime derke
It makes a lewd man a clerk
And fro the clerks the clergy
I^ takes awey and cowardy
It torneth in to hardynesse
Of Auaryce it makes largess
The wine makes eke the good blood
In which the soul which is good
Has chosen her a restyng place
While that the life her will enbrace
And by this skylle Monachas
Answered has upon this was
And seith that win by w^y of stynde
Is thing which may the hertes blind
Well more than the regalye
Zorobabell for his party
Seid as him thought for the best
That women ben the myghtyest
The king and the vynour also
Of women comen both two
And eke he seid how that manhede
Thorugh strength unto womanhede
Of love whether he will or none
Obey shall* and therupone
To show of women the maistry
A tale which he saw with eye
Nota hic de vigote amoris qui inter Cirum Regem persarum et apemen ba zasis
fi^^am ipsius regis concubinam spectan^e tota curio experiebatur

aS for ensample he told this
How Apem^n of basasis
Which daughter was (...) the pal^is /
Sittyng upon his deys
When he was hottest in his ire
Toward the great of his empire
Cirus the king ti^aunt she took
And only by her goodly look
She made him de^onaire and meke
And by the chyn and by the cheke
She logged him right as her list
That now she ^^ped and now she kys^
And does with him what ever her likes /
When yt she loureth than he siketh /
And when she gladeth he is glad
And thus the king is ouerlad
With her which his lemman was
Among the men is no solas
If that there he no woman there
For but if that the woman were
This worlds joy were awey
This is truth that I you seye
To knyghthode and to ^^^ldes same
They make a man to dread shame
And honor for to be desired
Thorugh the beauty of hem is desired
The dar^e which Cupide throws
Whereof the iolyf peyn^ grows
Which all the world ^oth vnderfo^^
A woman is the manne^ ^ote
His life / his death his woo his we^^
And this thing may be she wed we^^
How that wymmen ben good and kind
For in ensample thus I find
Nota de fide^^tate coniugis qua^^te^ A^cesta vx^^ Ameti vt maritum su^
viuificaret seipsam m^^ti spontance subegit

wHen that the duke Ametus^ay
Seek in his ^ed that every day
Men waiten when he should day
Alcest his*wyf goth for to prey
Deuoutely pray^^g for to w^^^^
with sacryfyce unto Myn^^^e
To wy^^ answer of the goddess
How that her lord of his sykenesse
Whereof he was so ^o ^isene
Recover might his hele ^y^ne
Loo thus she cried ^^o thus she praid
Tille at the last a voys her said
That if she would for his sake
The malady suffer and take
And dye her self he shall live
Of this answer Alceste has give
Unto Mynerue great thankyng
She that her death and his living
She chese with all her hoole intent
And thus acorded home she went
In to the chamber and when she came
Her household anon she name
In both her arms and him kyst
And spak unto him what her list
And thereupon within a throw
She lay down seek all overthrow
And dyed and he was hoole in have
So may a ^^n by reason taste
How next after the god above
The truth of woman and the love
In whom that al grace is found
Is myghtyest upon the ground
And most behoue^y many fold
Loo thus Zorobabel has told
The tale of his oppynyon
But for final conclusion
What strengest is of erthely things
The win the wymmen or the kings
He seith that truth above hem all^
Is myghtyest how ever it fall
The truth how so ever it come
May for nothing ben overcome
It may well suffer for a throw
But at the last it shall be know
The proverb is who that is true
He shall his while never rewe
For how so that the cause wend
The truth is shameless at the end
But thing that i^ troutheles
It may not we^ be shameless
And shame hyndereth every wight
So pryuely there is no might
Without truth in no degree
And thus for truth of his degree
Zorobabel was most commended
Whereof the question was ended
And received has his mede
For truth which to man's need
Is most behouelyche over all
For thy was truth in special
The first point in obseruaunce
Be take unto the governance
Of Alysander as it is seid
For thereupon the ground was leyd
Of every kings regyment
As thing which most conuenyent
Is for to set a king in even
Both in this world*and eke in heaven
Absit auaricia tangat regia corda Cuius enim spolijs excoriatur humus Fama
colit largum voluntas per secu la regem / Dona tamen licitis suut moderanda

Hic tractat de regi^ magestatis secunda policia* quam Aristotiles largitate^
vocat / cuius virtute non solum propulsata auaricia regis nomen magnificum
extollatur sed et sui subicionum diuiciarum habundancia i^cundiores of ficiuntur

nExt after truth the second
In polycye as it is found
Which serves to the worlds fame /
In worship of a kings name
Largess it is whoos pryuelege
There may no auaryce abrege
The worlds good was first comune
But afterward upon fortune
Was thylk common proufite cesed
But when the people stood encresed
As the lygnage we^en great
Anon for singular beyete
With sacrefye unto mynerue
To wit answer of the goddess
How that her lord of his sickness
Whereof he was so woo bysene
Recover might his hele ayene
Lo thus she cried / lo thus she prayed
Till at the last a voys her said
That if she would for his sake
The maladye suffer and take
And dye her self he shall live
Of this answer alcest has give
Unto mynerue great thonkyng
She that her death and his living
These with all her hole entente
And thus accorded home she went
In to the chamber and wha^ she came
Her busbond anon she name
In both her arms and him kyste
And spoke unto him what her list
And there upon within a through we
The good wife was overthrow
She deyed and he was hole in haste
So may a man by reason taste
How next after the god above
The truth of woman and the love
In whom that al grace is found
Is myghtyest upon the ground
And most behouely many fold
Lo thus Zorobabel has told
The tale of his opinion
But for fynal conclusyon
What strengest is of erthely things
The wine the wymmen or the kings
He seyth that truth above hem all
Is myghtyest how ever it fall
The truth how so ener it come
May for no thing ben overcome
It may well suffer for a throw
But at the last it shall be know
The prouerhys is who that is true
He shall his while never rewe
For how so that the cause wend
The truth is shameless at end
But thing that is trouthlesse
It may not well be shameless
And shame hyndereth every wight
So pryuely there is no might
With out truth in no degree
And thus for truth of his degree
Zorobabel was most commended
Whereof the questyon was ended
And he received has his mede
For troth which to man's need
Is most behouelyche over al
For thy was truth in specyal
The first point in obseruaunce
Be take unto the governance
Of alysaunder as it is said
For there upon the ground was laid
Of every kings regymente
As thing which most conuenyente
Is for to set a king in even
Both in this world and eke in heaven
Absit auaricia tangat regia corda Cuius enim spolijs excoriatur humus Fama
colit largum voluntas per secula regem / Dona tames licitis sunt moderanda modis

Hic tractat de regie magestatis secunda policia quam aristotiles largita tem
vocat cuius virtute non solum propulsata auaricia regie nomen magnificum
extollatur sz et sui subditi om niu^ dunciarum habundancia iocundi ores
efficiuntur /

Next after truth the second
In polecye as it is found
Which serves to the worlds fame
In worship of a kings name
Largess it is whose preuylege
There may no avarice abrege
The worlds good was first comune
But afterward upon fortune
Was thylke common prouffyt cesed
But When the people stood encresed
As the lygnages wexen great
Anon for synguler by^^e
Drew every man to his party
Whereof common the first envy
With great debate and warees strong
And last emo^ge the men so long
Till no man wist who was who
Ne which was friend ne which foo
Whyl at last in every land
Within hem self the people fond
That it was good to make a king
Which might appesen all this thing
And give right to the lignages
In partyng of her heritages
And eke of all the other good
And thus above hem al stood
The king upon his regalye
As he which has to iustefye
The worlds good for couetyse
So sit it well in all wise
A king between more and less
To set his heart upon largess
Toward him self and eke also
Toward his people and if not so
That is to say if that he be
Toward his self large and free
And of his people take and pylle
Largess by no weye of skylle
It may be said but avarice
Which in a king is a great vice
A king hehoueth eke to flee
The vpce of prodegalyte
That he mesure in expense
So keep that of indygence
He may be saufe fro who that needs
In all his work the wers he spedeth
Nota super hoc qued aristotilus ad Alexandrium exemplificauit de exactionibus
Regis chaldeoru^ /

aS aristotle upon caldee
Ensaumple of great auctorite
Unto alisaunder taught
Of thylke folk that were vnsaughte
Toward her king for his pyllage
Whereof he hade in his courage
That he unto three points entende
Where that he would his good dyspende
First should he look how that it stood
That al were of his own good
The yeftes which he would give
So might he the better leave
And eke he must taken head
If there be canse of any need
Which ought to be deffended
Or that his goods ben dyspended
He mote eke as it is befalle
Among other things all
Se the decertes of his men
And after they ben of ken
And of estate and merit
He shall hem largely acquyte
Or for the werre or for the pease
That none honor fall in dyscreast
Which might torn in to deffame
But that he keep his good name
So that he be not hold unkind
For in cronycle a tale I find
Which speaks some dele of this matere
Here afterward as thou shall here
Hic secundum gesta Iulij exemplu^ ponit qualiter Rex suorum militum quos
probos agnouerit indigenciam largitatis sue beneficijs releuare tenetur / *

In rome to pursue his right
There was a worthy pour knight
Which came allone for to seyne
His cause when the court was pleyne
Where Iulyus was in presence
And for him lacks of his dyspe^ce
There was with him none advocate
To make plee for his estate
But though him lack for to plede
Him lacks naught of manhede
He wist well his purse was pouer
But yet he thought his right receuer
And o penly pouerte aleyed
To the emperor and thus he seyed
O Iulyns lord of the law
Beheld my counceyl is withdraw
For lack of gold to thyn office
After the law of Justice
Help that I had counceyl here
Upon the truth of my matere
And Iulyus with that anon
Assygned him a worthy one
But he him self no word spoke
This knight was wroth and fond lake
In the emperor and said thus
O thou unkind Iulyus
When thou in thy battle were
Upon aufrik and I was there
My might for the rescue I did
And that no man in my stead
Thou wotest wounds there I had
But for I find the so bad
That the ne list speak one word
Thyn own mowthe or of thy horde
To give a floreyn me to help
How should I than me be yelpe
Fro this forth of my largess
When such a great unkindness
Is found in such a lord as thou
This Iulyus knew well y now
That al was sothe which he him told
And for he would not ben hold
Unkind he took his cause on hand
And as it were of gods sonde
He yaue him good enough to spend
For ever unto his lives end
And thus should every worthy king
Take of his knights knowlechyng
When that he saw they had need
For every service axeth mede
But other which have not deserved
Thorugh virtue but of ^apes served
A king shall not deserve grace
Though he be large in such a place
Hic ponit exemplum de rege antigo no qualiter dona regia secundum mame et
minus and equa discrecione moderanda sunt

iT sits well every king to have
Discressyon when men him crave
So that he may his gift wit
Whereof I find a tale write
How Ciuichus a power knight
A sum which was over might
Prayed of his king antygonus
The king answered to him thus
And said how such a yefte passes
His power estate and than he lasseth
And axeth but a little penny
If that the king would give him any
The king answered it is to small
For him that is a lord ryalle
To give a man so little thing
It were vnworshyp in a king
By this ensaumple a king may lere
That for to give is in manner
For if a king his tresour lasseth
Without honor and thankelesse passes
When he him self will so begyle
I note who shall complain his while
Ne who by right him shall releue
But nethelesse this I believe
Nota hic quoth regis status a suis fidelib omni fauore supportandus est

The which with his own land
Behooves every man's hand
To set upon necessyte
And eke his kings ryalte
Mote every lyege man comfort
With good and body to supporte
When they see cause reasonable
For who that is not entendable
To hold up right his kings name
Him ought for to be to blame
Nota hic secundum aristotelem qua liter principum prodigalitas pauperta tem
induat co^nne^^

Of polecye and ever more
To speak in this matere more
So as the phylosophre told
A king after the rule is hold
To modefye and adresse
His yeftes upon such largess
Seneca sit alijs benefacito vt tibi non no^^gs

That the mesure not excede
For if a king shall in to need
It causes often sendry things
Which ben ungoodly to the kings
What man will not him self mesure
Men secth full often that mesure
Him has forsake and so does he
That uses prodygalite
Which is the mother of pouerte
Whereof the lands ben deserte
And namely when that ylke vice
Above a king stante in office
And has with hold of his party
The cenetous flaterye
Which many a worthy king deceyueth
Or he the fallace perceyueth
Of hem that seruen to the gloss
For they that can plese and gloss
Ben as men tellen the norice
Unto the fosteryng of the vice
Whereof full often netheles
A king is blamed gyltles
Nota qualiter principum curijs adula tores triplice grauitate offendunt

A philosophre as thou shall here
Spoke to a king of this matere
And said him well how that flaterours
Coulpable were of three errors
One was toward the gods on hye
That weren wroth of that they syghe
The myschyef which befalle should
Of that the false flaterour told
Toward the king another was
When they by sleyght and by fallas
Of feyned words make him wene
That black is whyt and blew is grene
Touching of his condition
For when he does extorcion
With many another vice moo
Men shul not find one of tho
To grutche or speak there ageyn
But holden up his oil and sayn
That al is well what ever he does
And thus of falls they maken soth
So that the kings eye is blente
And wot not how the world is went
The third error is harm comune
with which the people mote comune
Of wrongs that they bryngen ynne
And thus they werchen treble sin
That been flaterours about a king
There might be no werse thing
About a kings regalye
Than is the vice of flaterye
And nethelesse it has been used
That it was never yet refused
As for to speak of court ryalle
For there it is most specialle
And many long before bore
But when this vice of hem is bore
That should the virtuous forth bring
And troth is turned in to lesynge
It is as who says against kind
Whereof an old ensaumple as I find
Hic contra vanitates adulandum loquitur et narrat quod cum arisippus de
cartagine philosophus scole studium relinquens sui principio obsequio in magnis
adulacionibus pre ceteris carior asistebat / Accidit up ipse quodam die
Dioginem philosophum uuper socium suum virum tam moribus quam probatissimum
herbas ad olera sua collectas lauantem ex casu ad ripam inuenerat / Cui ait o
diogene scito sicut et ego principi tuo placere scires huiusmodi herbas aut
celligere aut non lauare indigeres O arisippe certe si tu olera tua lauare

scires be in blan^icijs et adulacioni^us principi tuo seruire non oporteret

^Mouge these old tales wise
Of phylosophres in this wise
I trde how whilom two there were
And to the soole for to lere
Unto athenis fro cartage
Her friends when they were of age
Hem sent and there they stoden long
Till they such lore have vnderfonge
That in her time they surmounte
Al other men that to accounte
Of hem two was great fame
The first of hem his right name
Was drogenes than hot
In whom was found no ryote
His fellow arisippus hight
Which much could and might
But at last sothe to said
They both turned home again
Unto cartage and soole let
This dyogynes no beyete
Of worlds good less or more
Ne sought for his long lore
But took him only for to dwell
At home and as the books tell
His hows was nygh to the ryuere
Beside a bridge as thou shall here
There dwelled he took his rest
So as it thought him for the best
To study in his philosophye
As he which so would defye
The worlds pomp on every side
But arisippe his books a side
Has leyed and to the court he went
Where many a wyle and many a went
With flaterye and words soft
He cast and has compasse^ often
How he his prince might plese
And in this wise he gate him ^ase
Of vein honor and worlds good
The lands rule upon him stood
The king of him was wonder glad
And al was do what thing he bad
Both in the court and eke with out
With flaterye he brought about
His purpoos of the worlds work
Which was ageyn the state of clerk
So that the philosophye he left
And to the riches him self up left
^o thus had arisippe his will
But dyogenes dwelled stylle
At home and looked on his book
He sought not the worlds croke
For veyn honor ne for richesse
But al his herdes business
He set to be virtuous
And thus within his own hows
He lives to the suffysaunce
Of his having and fyl perchance
This dyogynes upon a day
And that was in the monthe of ma^y
That when these herbs ben holsom
And walked for to gader some
In his gardyn in which his iolytes
He thought to have and thus aboutes
Wha^ he has gadred what him likes
He set him down than and pyketh
And wysshe his herbs in the flode
Upon which his gardyn stood
Nygh to the bridge as I told ere
And happens while he sits there
Came arisippes by the street
With many horse and routes great
And straight unto the bridge he rode
Where that he houed and abode
For as he cast his eye nygh
His fellow dyogenes he syghe
And what he did he saw also
Whereof he said to him tho
O diogenes god the speed
It were certes little need
To sit here and wortes pyke
If thou thy prince coudest like
So as I am in my degree
O arisippe ageyn quod he
If that thou coudest so as I
Thy wortes pyke truly
It were as little need or less
That thou yt so worldly would compass
With flaterye for to serve
Whereof thou thynkest to dysserue
Thy princes thank and to purchase
How thou might stand in his grace
For getyng of a little good
If thou would take in to thy mood
Reason thou might by reason deem
That so thy prince for to queme
Is not to reason accordaunt
But it is gretely discordaunte
Unto the sooles of athene
^o thus answered diogene
Ageyn the clerks flaterye
But men seen the assemplarye
Of arisippe is well received
And thylke of dyogene is weyued
Office in court and gold in coffre
Is now men sayn the philosophre
Which has the worship in the halle
But flaterye passes all
In chau^bre when the court ^uau^ceth
For upon thylke lotte it chances
To be byloued now a day
I note if it be ye or nay
How dante the poet answerde
To a flaterour / the tale I herd
Upon a stryf between them two
He said him there ben many mo
Of thy servants than of mine
For the poet of his couyne
Has none that will him clothe and feed
But a flatour may rule and led
A king with all his land about
So stante the wise man in doubt
Of hem that to folly draw
For such is now the common law
And as comune boece it tells
And where that flaterye dwells
In any land under the son
There is full many thing begone
Which were better to be left
That has he showed now and efte
But if a prince would him rule
Of the romans after the rule
In thylke time it was used
This vice should be refused
Whereof the points ben assoted
But where the plain troth is noted
There may a prince well conceive
That he him self deceive
Of that he hereth words pleyne
Of him that naught by reason pleyne
That warned is or him be woo
And that was fully pre^yd tho
When rome was the worlds chyef
^he sooth sayer tho was leef
Which would not the truth spare
But with his word playn^ and bare
To the emperor his sothes told
As in cronyke is yet withholde
Here afterward as thou shall here
According unto this matere
Hic narra^t super eodem qualiter nuper Romanorum Imperator cum ipso
triumphator in hosts a bello rome rediret / Tres sibi lauds in signum sui
triumphi precipue debebantur primo quatuor equi abbissimi currum in quo sedebat
veherent Secundo tunica Iouis pro tunc indueretur Tercio sui captiui prope
currum ad viriusque latus cathena ti deambularent Set ne tanti honoris adulacio
eius animum in superbiam extolleret quidam scurra linguosus iuxta ipsum in
curru sedebat qui quasi contumatis vocibus improperando Notheos hoc est noscete
ipsum quia and hodie fortunata sibi prospera sunt cras forte versa rota
mutabilis aduersabitur

O see this old ensaumplerye
That whilom was no flaterye
Toward the princes well I find
Whereof so as comes to mind
My sone a tale unto thyn ere
While that the worthy princes were
At rome I think for to tellen
For when the chances so byfellen
That any emperor as tho
Victory upon his foo
And so came forth to rome ageyn
Of treble honor he was certain
Whereof that he was magnefyed
The first as it is specefyed
Was when he came that ylke tide
The chare in which he should ride
Four whyt stedes should it draw
Of Iubyter by thilke law
The cote he should were also
His prisoners eke should goo
Endlonge the chare on either hand
And all the noblesse of the land
To fore and ^after with him come
Rydyng and brought him to rome
In token of his chyualrye
And for none other flaterye
And that was she wed forth with all
Where he satte in his chare ryalle
Beside him was a rybaud set
Which had his word so beset
To the emperor in all his glory
He said take in thy memory
For all this pomp and all this pride
Let no justice goo a side
But know thy self what so befalle
For men seen oftymes fall
Things which men wend siker sto^de
Though thou victory have in hand
Fortune may not stand alwey
The which perchance another day
May turn and thou might over throw
There lasts no thing but a throw
With these words and with moo
This ribaulde which sat with him the
To the emperor his tale told
And evermore after what be would
Or were it evil or were it good
So plainly as the troth stood
He spares not but be speaks out
And so might every man about
The day of that solempnyte
His tale tell as well as he
To the emperor al openly
And al was this cause why
That while he stood in that noblesse
He should his vanyte repress
With such words as he herd
Lo now how thylke time it ferde
Toward so high a worthy lord
For this I find eke of record
Which the cronycle has auctorized
What emperor was Intronyzed
Hic eciam contra adulacionem narrat quoth primo die quo nuper Imperator
intronisatus extitit latonij sui ab ipso constanter peterent de quali lapide
sue sepulture tumulum fabricarent vt sic futuram mortem commemorans vani tates
huius seculi transitonas facilius reprimeret

tHe first day of his corone
Where he was in his ryal trone
And held his feste in the paleys
Sittyng upon his hye deys
With all the lust that may be get
When he was gladdest at his mete
And every mynstral had played
And every gestour had said
What most was plesaunt to his ere
At last came in there
His masons for they shullen crave
Where that he would be bygraue
And what stone his sepulture
They sholden make and what scripture
He would ordeyne there upon
Tho was there flatrrye none
The worthy prince to beiape
The king was otherwyso shape
With good counceyl and other wise
They were hem self than wise
And vnderstoden well and knewen
When such soft wyndes hlewen
Of flaterxe in to her ere
They setten naught her hertes there
But when they herd words feyned
The pleyne truth it has disdeyned
Of hem that weren so dyscrete
So took the flaterer no beyete
Of him that was his prince tho
And for to prove that it is so
A tale which I find in deed
In a cronycle of rome I read
Hic inter alia gesta cesaris narrat vnum exemplu^ precipue contra illos qui
cum in aspectu principis alijs sapi enciores apperere vellent quando que tamen
similitate sapiencie talia comittunt per que ceteris stulciores in fine
comprobantur

Caesar upon his ryal trone
Where that he satte in his person
And was highest in all his pryse
A man which would make him wise
Fyldoun knelyng in his presence
And did him such a reverence
As though he high god were
Men had great marvel there
Of the worship which he deed
This man aroos fro thylke stead
And forth withal the same tide
He goes him up and by his side
He set him down as there a pere
And said if thou that sit here
Art god which al things might
Than I have do worship a right
As to the god and otherwise
If thou he not of thylke assyse
Bnt art a man such as am I
Than may I sit the fast by
For we be both of one kind
Caesar answered and said o blind
Thou art a fool it is well seen
Upon thy self if thou wene
If I be a god thou do a mys
To sit where thou see that god is
And I be a man also
Thou have a great folly do
When thou to such one as shall deye
The worship of thy god alweye
Have yeuen so unworthily
Thus may I preue redely
Thou art not wise and that herd
How wisely that the king answerde
It was to hem a new lore
Whereof they dreden him the more
And brought no thing to his ere
Bnt if it treuth and reason were
So ben there many in such a wise
That faynen words to be wise
And al is very flaterye
To him which can it well aspyr
Nota qualiter ista circa principem adultores potius a curia expelli quam ad
regie magestatis munera acceptan policia suadente delerent

tHe kind flatour can not love
But for to bring him self above
For how that ever his master fare
So that him self stand out of care
He retcheth naught and thus often
Deceyueth with words soft
The kings that been Innocent
Where as for thastement
The wise phylosophre seyed
What king that so his tresour leyed
Upon such folk he has the less
And yet no does he no largess
^nt harmeth with his own hand
Him self and eke his own land
And that by many a sundry weye
Whereof if that a man shall seye
As for to speak in generalle
Where such thing falls over all That any king him self mysrule
The phylosophre upon this rule
In speaal a cause set
Which is and ever has be the bette
In governance about a king
Upon (...) myselyef of the thing
And that he seyth is sla^^ye
Whereof to fore as in party
What that vice is I have declared
For who that has his wit bywared
Upon a flaterer to believe
When that he weneth best acheue
His god word it is most fro
And for to preuen it is so
Exaumples there ben many one
Of which if thou wylt know one
It is behouely for to here
What whylom fyl in this matere
hIc loquitur vlterius de consilio adusantum quorum fabulis principes aures
organiate veritatis auditum ca^ere nequeunt / Et narrat exemplu^ de rege achab
oui pro eo quoth ipse prophe a^s fidelis Michee recu auit blandiaas oue adulantis
edechye adhesit Rex Sir^e benedab in campo bellator ipsum diuino Iudicio
deuictum interfecit

^Monge the kings in the bible
I find a tale and is credyble
Of one that whylom achab hight
Which had al Israel to right
But who that could gloss soft
And ^latre which he set on lofte
In arete estate and made hem rich
But they that wroten words lyche
To truth and would it not forbere
For hem was none estate to be^^
The contre of such took none here
Till at last upon a need
That benadab the king of surry
Of Israel a great party
Which ramoth coloath was hot
Has seced and of that ^yote
He took counceyl in sundry wise
But not of hem that weren wise
And nethelesse upon this caas
To strength him for Iosaphas
Which then was king of Iudee
He send for to come as he
Which thorugh frendshyp and alliau^ce
Was next to him of acquaintance
For Ioram sone of Iosaphath
Achabbes daughter wedded has
Which hight fair goodelye
And thus came in to samerye
King Iosaphath and he found there
The king achab and when they were
To gyder spekyng of this thing
This Iosaphath says to the king
How that he would gladly here
Sum true prophet in this matere
That he his counceyl might give
To what point it shall be dreue
And in that time so befelle
That there was such one in Israel
Which set him al to flaterye
And he was cleped sedechye
And after him achab has sent
And he at his commandment
To him came and by a sleyghte
He has upon his heed on heyght
Two large horns set of bras
And he which a flaterour was
And goes rampyn^ as a lion
And cast his horns up and down
And bad men ben of good espeyre
For as the horns persen the air
He says withouten resistance
So wist he well of his science
That benadab is discomfyte
When sedechye upon this plyte
Has told this tale unto this lord
Anon they were of one accord
Prophets false many m^
To bear up oil and although
Affermed that which he has told
Whereof the king achab was bold
And yaue hem yeftes al about
But Iosaphath was in great doubt
He held fantasme all that he herd
Prayeng achab how so it ferde
If there were any other man
The which of prophecye can
To here him speak or that they gone
Quod achab than there is one
A brothel which mycheas hight
But he ne comes in my sight
For he has long in prison leyen
Him lyked never yet to sayen
A goodely word to my plesaunce
And nethelesse at thyn instau^ce
He shall come out and than he may
Say as he has said many a day
For yet he said never well
Tho Iosaphath began sum dele
To gladen him in hope of truth
And bade him withouten slouthe
That men him should f^tte anon
And they that were fro him gone
When that they came where he was
They tolden unto mycheas
The manner how that sedechye
Declared has his prophecye
And thereupon they pray him fair
That he will say no contrayre
Whereof the king may be dysplese^
For so shall every man be esed
And he may help him self also
Mycheas upon truth tho
His heart set and to hem seyth
All that belongs unto his feyth
And of none other feyned thing
That will he tell unto the king
As far as god has give him grace
Thus came this prophet in to ye place
Where he the kings will herd
And he thereto anon answerde
Unto him in this wise
My lyege lord for my fernyse
With treuth stand has ever yet
Thou have me with pason aquyt
But for all that I shall not gloss
Of truth after as I suppose
And as touching of this battle
Thou shall not of the soth sail
For if it like the to here
As I am taught in that matere
Thou might it understand sone
But what is afterward to done
Auyse the of this I seye
I was tofore the trone on heye
Where all the world me thought stood
And there I herd and understood
The voice of god with words clear
Axyng and said in this manner
In what wise may I best begyl^
This king achab and for a while
And upon this point they speak fast
Tho said a spyrit at last
I undertake this empryse
And god him axeth in what wise
I shall quoth he deceive and lie
With flateryng prophecye
In such mowthes as he leueth
And he which al thing acheueth
Bad him goo forth and do right so
And over this I say also
This noble people of Israel
Dispers as sheep upon an hylle
Without a kepar un arrayed
And as they went about and strayed
I herd a voys unto hem seyn
Goes home in to your hows ageyn
Till I for you have fetter ordained
Quod sedechye thou have feyned
This tale in angeryng of the king
And in a wrath upon this thing
He smote mychee upon the cheke
The king him has rebuked eke
And every man upon him cried
Thus was he shente on every side
Ageyn in to prison ladde
For so the king him self badde
The truth might not be herd
But afterward as it has ferde
The deed proves his entente
Achab to the battle went
Where benadab for all his shield
Him slew so that upon the field
His people goes about a straye
But god which al thing may
So does that they no myschyef have
Her king was deed and they be save
And home ageyn in gods pees
They went and al was found lees
That s^^^chye has said tofore
So sit it well a king therefore
To love them that true mean
For at last it will be seen
That flaterye is no thing worth
But now to my matere forth
As for to speken over more
After the philosophers lore
The third point of polecye
I think for to specefye
Propter transgressores leges statuuntur in o^be / Vt vn^a^t iusti regis honor
v^^* / Lex sine Iusticia populum sub principis vmbra / Deuiat vt rectum nemo
videbit it^r

Hic tractat de tercia principum legie policia que iusticia nominata est ^^^us
condicio legibus incorupta vniuiaue quoth suum est cquo pondere distribuit

wHat is a land there men be none
What ben the men that are allone
Without a kings governance
What is a king in his lygeaunce
Where that there is no law in land
What is to take law on hand
But if the Iuges ben true
These old worlds with the new
Who that will take in euydence
There may he se experience
What thing it is to keep law
Through which wrongs be withdraw
And rightwysnes stand commended
Whereof the regnes ben amended
For where the law may commune
The lords forth with the comune
Each has his propre deute
And eke the knights ryalte
Of both his worship, vnderfongeth
To his estate as it bylongeth
Which of his worthynesse
Has to govern rightwysnesse
As he which shall the law guide
And nevertheless upon so^me side
His power stante above the law
To give both and to draw
The forset of the man's life
But things which are excessyf
Ageyn the law he shall not do
For love ne for hate also
Imperatoriam magestatem non solum armis s eciam legibus oportet esse armatam

b The myghtes of a king be great
But yet a worthy king shall ^et^
Of wrong to done all that he might
For he which shall the people right
Yt sits well to his regalye
That he him self first Iustefye
Toward god in his degree
For his estate is else fre
Toward al other in his person
Save only to the god allone
Which will him self a king chastyse
Where that none other may suffyse
So were it good to taken head
That first a king his own deed
Between the virtue and the vice
Redress and than his justice
So set in even the balaunce
Toward other in governance
That to the power and to the rich
His laws might stand in lyche
He shall except no person
But for he may not al him one
In sundry place to Justice
He shall of his ryal office
With wise consyderacion
Ordeyne his dysputacion
Of such Iuges as ben learned
So that his people be governed
By hem that true ben and wise
For if the law of couetyse
Be set upon Iuges hand
Woo is the people of thylke land
For wrong may not him self hyde
But allas on that other side
If law stand with the right
The people is glad and stonte up right
Where as the law is meuable
The common people stante reasonable
And if the law torn a mys
The people also mystorned is
Nota hic iusticia maximinj imperato ris qui cum alicuius prouincie custode^

aNd in ensaumple of this matere
Of maxymyn a man may here
Of Rome Which was emperor
That when he made a governor
By weye of substytucion
Of prouynce or of regyon
He would first acquyre his name
And let it openly proclaim
What man he were or evil or good
And upon that his name stood
Enclyned to virtue or to vice
So would he set him in office
Or ellis put him al a weye
Thus held the law the right weye
Which fond no let of couetyse
The world stood than upon that wise
By ensaumple thou might read
And hold in thy mind I read
Hic ponit exemplum de iudicibus incorruptis and narrat qualiter Gaius
Fabricius nuper Rome consul aurum a sampnitibus sibi oblatum remi^t dicens quoth
nobilius est aurum possidentes domino subuigare quam ex auri cupidi tate
dominij libertacem am^^tere

IN a cronyque I find thus
How that gayus fabricius
Which whylom was consul of rome
By whom the laws yede and come
When the sampnytes to him brought
A sum of gold and him besought
To done him favor in the law
Toward the gold he began him draw
Whereof in all men's look
A part in to his hand he took
Which to his mowthe in all haste
He put it for to smelle and taste
And to his eye and to his lere
But he ne foude no comfort there
And than he began it to despise
And told unto hem in this wise
I note what is with gold to thryue
When none of al my wits five
Find savor ne delight therein
So it is but a nyce sin
Of gold to be couetouse
But he is rich and gloriouse
Which has in his subieccion
Tho men which in pocessyon
Ben rich of gold and by this skylle
For he may al day when he will
Or be him lefe or be him loathe
Justice done upon hem both
Lo thus he said and with that word
He threw tofore him upon a board
The gold out of his hand anon
And said them that he would none
So that he kept his lyberte
To do Justice and equity
With lucre of such richesse
There ben now few of such I guess
For it Was thylke time used
That every Judge was refused
Which was not friend to common right
But they that wolden stand up right
For truth only to Justice
^referred were in thylke office
To deem and Judge common law
Which now me^ sayn is al with draw
To sett^ a law and keep it naught
There is no comune prouffyt sought
But abeue al nethelees
The law which is made for pees
Is good to keep for the best
For that sets al men in rest

tHe rightful emperor conr^de
To keep pees such a law made
That none within the cite
In dysturbaunce of unity
Durst ones meuen a matere
For in his time as thou might here
What point that was for law set
It sheld for no good be let
To what person that it were
And this brought in the common fere
Why any man the law dradde
For there was none which favor had

sO as these old looks sayn
I find write where a romayn
Which consul was of pretoyre
Whose name was caromydot^yre
He set a law for the pees
That every man be Wepenlees
That came in to the counceyl hows
And else as malicious
He shall ben of the law deed
To that statute and to that read
Accorden al it shall be so
For certain cause which was tho
Now here what fyl herafter sone
This consul had for to done
And was in to the feldes ryden
And they him long abyden
That lords of the couuceyl were
And bad him come and he came there
With sword y gyrde and had foryete
Till he was in the couuceyl sete
Was none of hom that made speech
Till he him self it would seche
And fond out the defaute him self
And said unto the twelfe
Which of the senate weren wise
I have deseruyd the juyse
In haste that it were I do
And they him sayden al no
For well they wist it was no vice
When he ne thought no malice
But only of a little slouthe
And thus they leften as for routhe
To do justyce upon his gylte
For that he should not be spylte
And when in the manner how
They would him save he made a vow
With manful heart and thus he said
That rome should never abrayed
His heirs when he was of dawe
That her auncetour brake the law
For thy that they weren ware
Forthwyth the same sword he ^are
The statute of his law he kept
So that al rome his death be wept

Where that a Judge his own deed

He did upon him such vengeance
Out of his skyn he was befloyne

So that his skyn was shape al met^
And nailed upon the same set^
Where that his sone should sit

There saw he ready his juyse
Thus in defaulte of other juge

To holden up the right law
And for to speak of the old dawe
To take ensaumple of that was tho
I find a tale written also
How that a worthy prince is hol^^
The laws of his land to held
First for the high gods sake
And for that hy^ is betake
The people for to guide and led
Which is the charge of his kynghe^^

IN a cronycle I read thus
Of the rightful lygurgyus
Which of athenes prince was
How he the law in every was
Whereof he should his people rule
Has set upon so good a rule
In all this world that cite none
Of law was so well begone
Forthwith the truth of governance
There was emonge hem no distannce
But every man has his encrees
There was without werre pees
Without envy love stood
Richesse upon the comune good
And not upon the synguler
Ordained was and the power
Of hom that weren in estate
Was sauf whereof upon debate
There stood no thing so that in rest
Might every man his herre rest
And when this noble rightful king
Saw how it ferde of all this thing
Whereof the people stood in ese
He which for ever would plese
The hye god whose thonke he sought
A wonder thing than he bethought^
And shope how that it might be
How that his law in the cite
Might afterward for ever last
And there upon his wit he cast
What thing him were best to sayen
That his purpoos might atteyne
A parlemente and thus he set
His wysdom ^here that he be set
In audience of great and small
And in this wise he told a tale
God wot and so ye woten all
Here afterward how so it fall
Yet to now my will has be
To do justice and equity
In ferderyng of the common proffyt
Such has been ever my delight
But of one thing I am beknowe
The wh^les my will is that ye know
The l^^e which I took on hand
Was al to gyder of gods sonde
And no ^ynge of mine own wit
So mote it need endure yet
And shall do longer if ye will
For I will trlle you the skyl
The god mercurius and no man
He has me taught all that I can
Of such laws as I made
Whereof that ye ben al glade
It was the god and no thing I
Which did all this and now for thy
He has commanded of his grace
That I shall come in to a place
Which far out in an isle
Where I moto tarry for a while
Which him to speak as he has bid
For as be says in thylke stead
He shall me such things tell
That ever while ye world shall dwell
A^^nes shall the better fare
But first or that I thither fare
For that I would that my law
Among you ne be withdraw
The whiles that I shall be out
For thy to setten out of doubt
Both you and me thus will I pray
That ye me would assure and say
With such an oath as I will take
That each of you shall undertake
My laws for to keep and hold
They sayden all that they would
And there upon they swear their oath
That fro that time that he gothe
Till he to hem be come ageyn
They shullen his law well and pleyne
In every point keep and fulfille
Thus has lygurius his will
And took his leave and forth he went
But here now well to what entente
Of rightwysnes he did so
For after that he was a goo
He shope him never to be found
So that athenes which was found
Never after should be releced
Ne thylke good law seced
Which was for comune prouffyt sout
The king his own estate ne rought
To do prouffyt to the comune
He took of exyle the fortune
And left of pryuely thylke office
Only for love and for justyce
For which he thought if yt he myt
For ever after his death to right
The cite which was him betake
Whereof men ought ensaumple take
With hem which under governance
The good laws to auaunce
And who that would take keep
The laws have for to keep
Of hem that first the laws found
As far as lasts any ground
Of land her names yet be know
And if it like the to know
So^me of their names how they stand
Now harken and thou shall understand
Hic ad eorum laudem qui iusticie causa leges statuerunt aliquorum nomina
specialius commemorat

oF every benefete the merit
The god him self it will acquyte
And eke full often it falls so
The world it will acquyte also
But that may not be even syche
To god he yeueth the heaven rich
The world yeueth only but a name
Which stante upon the good fame
Of hem that done the good deed
And in this wise double mede
Receyuen that done well here
Whereof if that thou list to here
After the fame as it is blow
There might thou well the soth know
How thilke honest business
Of hem that first of rightwysnesse
Emonge the men the laws made
May never upon this earth fade
For ever while there is a tongue
Her name shall be read and song
And hole in the cronyke write
So that the men shullen wit
To speak good as they well oughten
Of hem that first the laws soughten
In forderyng of the worlds pees
Unto thebrewes was moses
The first and the Egypciens
Mercurius and to troiens
First was ne wma pompilius
To athenes ligurius
Yaue first the law unto gregoys
Foroneus has thylke voice
And romulus of romans
For such men as ben vylayns
The law in such a wise ordeyneth
That what man the law pleyneth
By so the juge stand up right
He shall be served of his right
And so ferforth it is befalle
That law is comune emonge us all
God lene it mo^e well be hold
As every king thereto is hold
For thing which is of kings set
With kings ought it not to be let
What king of law takes no keep
By law he may no royame keep
Do law aweye what is a king
Where is the right of any thing
If that there be no law in land
This ought a king well understand
As he which is to law sworn
That if the law be forlorn
Withouten execusyoun
Hit makes a land torn up so dou n
Which is unto the king and sclaundre
For thy unto king alisaundre
The wise philosophre had
That he him self first be ladde
Of law and than forth with all
To do justyse in generalle
That all the wide land about
The justice of his law doubt
And than shall he stand in rest
For thereto law is one the best
Above al other erthely thing
To make a liege dread his king
But how a king shall get him love
Toward the high god above
And eke a man in earth
This next point which is the ferthe
Of aristotle's lore it techeth
Whereof who the soole secheth
What polecye that it is
The book reherceth after this
Nil racionis habens vbi vel tira^ni (...) regna / Stringit amor populi
transiet exul ibi / Set pietas regnum que conseruabit in euum / Non tantum po
pulo / set placet illa deo

Hic tractat de quarta principum re giminis policia que pietatis dicta est per
quam principes erga populum mi serioordes effecti misericordiam altissimi
consecuntur

iT needs not that I debate
The prince which preised is algate
And has been ever and ever shall
Whereof to speak in special
It is the virtue of pity
Thorough which the hye mageste
Was sterred when his sone alyght
And in pity the world to right
Took of the maid flesh and blood
Pity was cause of thylke good
Whereof that we ben all save
Well ought a man pity to have
And the virtue to set in price
When he him self which is al wise
Has showed why it shall be preysed
Pity may not be counterpeysed
Of tyranny with no peyse
For pity makes a man curteyse
Both in his word and in his deed
It sit well every liege to dread
His king and to his heste obey
And right so by the same weye
It sit a king to be pytous
Toward his people and gracious
Upon the rule of governance
So that he worche no vengeauuce
Which may be cleped cruelte
Justice which does equity
Is dredeful for he no man spares
But in the l^nde where pity fares
The king may never fail of love*
For pity thorough the grace above
So as the phylosophre affermeth
His reygne in good estate confermeth
The appostle james in this wise
S^yth what man that should do iuyse
And has not pity forth with all
The dome of him which demeth all
He may him self full sore dread
That him shall lack upon the need
To find pity when he would
For who that pity will behold
It is a point of cristes love
And for to loken ouermore
It is behouely as we find
To reason and to law of kind
Tassyodre in his aprise tells
The royame is sauf where pite dwells
And tullyus this tale auoweth
And says what king to pite boweth
And with pity stonte overcome
He has that shield of grace nome
Which unto kings yeueth victory^
Of alisannder in his hystorye
I read how a worthy knight
Of sodeyn wrath and not of right
Foriuged bath and he appeleth
And with yt word the king quareleth
And said none is above me
That wot I well my lord ad he
Fro thy lordshyp appele I naught
But fro thy wrath in all my thout
To thy pity stante mine appele
The king which understood him well
Of pure pity gave him grace
And eke I read in another place
Constantinus imperator ait vere se dominum esse *comprobat qui seruum pietatis
se facit

Thus said whilom constantyne
What emperor that is enclyne
To pity for to be servant
Of all the worlds remenaunte
He is worthy to ben a lord
In old books of record
Trai^nus ait quoth cum ipse subditos suos solite pietatis fauore magis qua^
austeritatis rigore regere little que be neuolenciam pocius quam timorem penes
se attractare proponebat

tHis find I write of ensau^playr
Traian the worthy debonayr
By whom that rome stood governed
Upon a time as he was learned
Of that he was to famulyer
He said unto that counceller
That for to be an emperor
His will was not for vein honor
Ne yet for reddour of Justice
But if he might in his office
His lord and his people plese
Him thought it were a great ease
With love her hertes to him draw
Than with the dread of any law
For wha^ a thing is done for doubt
Full often it comes the wers about
But where a king is pytous
He is the more gracious
That mykel thrist him shall leiyde
Which ellis should torn a side
Qualiter Iudeus predester cum pa ^ gave equitante itinerauit per desertum et
ipsum de fide sua interrogauit

tO do pite supporte and grace
The phi^^sophre upon a place
In his writing of days old
A tale of great ensaumble told
Unto the king of macedoyne
How between cayr and babyloyne
When comen is the somer hete
It happened two men for to mete
As they should enter in to a paas
Where that the wyldernes was
And as they went forth spekende
Under the large wodes end
That one man axeth of that other
What man art thou my lyef brother
Which is thy creaunce and thy feyth
I am a paynym that other seyth
And by the law which I use
I shall not in my feyth refuse
To louen al men y liche
The pour both and eke the rich
When they be glad I shall be glad
And sorry when they ben bestad
So shall I live in unity
With every man in his degree
For right as to my self I would
Right so toward al other I should
Be gracious and debonayr
Thus have I told the soft and f^y^
My feyth my law and my creaunce
And if the list for acquaintance
Now tell what manner man thou art
And he answered upon his part
I am a Jew / and by my law
I shall to no man be felawe
To keep him troth in word ne dde
But if he be without dread
A very Jew right as am I
For ellis I may truly
Bereue him both life and good
The paynym herd and understood
And thought it was a wonder law
And thus upon their sundry saw
Talkyng both forth they went
The day was hot the son burnt
The paynym rode upon an ass
And of his catel more and less
With him a rich trusse he ladde
The Jew which al untruth had
And went upon his feet beside
Bethought him how he might ride
And with his words slye and wise
Unto the paynym in this wise
He said / o now it shall be seen
What it is thou woltest mean
For if thy law be certain
As thou have told I darwel seyn
Thou wylt behold my distress
Which am so full of werynesse
That I ne may uneath goo
And let me ride a mile or two
So that I may my body ese
The paynym would him not dysplese
Of that he spoke but in pytee
It list him for to know and see
The pleynte which that other made
And for he would his heart glade
He light and made him no thing strange
Thus was there made a new change
The paynym the Jew a lofte
Was set / upon his ass soft
So goon they forth carpend fast
On this / on that / till on the last
The paynym might goo no more
And prayed unto the Jew therefore
To suffer him ride a little while
The Jew which thout him to begyle
Anon rode forth the great paas
And to the paynym in this caas
He seid thou have do thy right
Of that thou had me behyght
To do socour upon my need
And that accords to the deed
As thou art to the law hold
And in such wise as I the told
I think also for my party
Upon the law of Iewrye
To werche and do my duete
Thyn ass shall goo forth with me
With all thy good which I have sesed
And that I wot thou art dysesed
I am right glad and not myspayed
And when he has these words said
In all haste he rode aweye
The p^^nym wot none other weye
But on the ground he kneleth even
His hondes up unto the heaven
And said / o hye sothfastnes
That love al rightwysnes
Unto thy dome lord I appele
Behold and deem my quarele
With humble heart I the beseech
The mercy both and the wreche
I set al in thy Judgment
And thus upon his marrement
This paynym has made his prayere
And then he was with drery chere
And goes him forth and in his gate
^e cast his eye about algate
The Jew if that he might see
But for a time it may not be
Till at last ageyn the night
So as god would he went a right
As he which held the hye weye
And then he saw in a valeye
Where that the Jew liggend was
Al blody deed upon the gras
Which strangeled was of a leon
And as he boked up and down
He fond his ass fast by
Forthwith his harneys redely
Al hool and sound as he it left
When that the Jew it him byrefte
Whereof he thanked god knelende
^o thus a man may know at end
How the pytous pity deserves
For what man that to pity serves
As aristotle it bears witness
God shall his foomen so repress
That they shall ay stand underfoot
Pity men sayn is thylke rote
Whereof the virtues spryngen all
What infortune that befalle
In any land / lack of pity
Is cause of thylke aduersite
And that alday may show at eye
Who that the world discretely syhe
Good is that every man therefore
Take heed of that is said tofore
For of this tale and other y now
These noble princes whylom drowe
Her euydence and her appryse
As men may find in many wise
Who that these old books read
And though they ben in earth deed
Her good name may not deye
For pity which they would obey
To do the deeds of mercy
And who this tale redely
Remember as aristotle it told
He may the will of god behold
Upon the point as it was ended
Whereof the pity stood commended
Which is to charity felawe
As they that kepen both one law
Nota hic de pietate principis erga populum vbi narrat quod ^odius rex atheuis
contra dorences bellum gere re deberet consulto prius appoline respo^sum

oF pity for to speak plain
Which is with mercy well besayn
Fuf often him self he would pain
To keep another fro the pain
For charity the mother is
Of pity which no thing a mys
Can suffer if he it may amend
It sits to every man lyuende
To be pytons but none so wel^
As to a king which on the whele
Fortune has set abouen all
For in a king if so befalle
That his pity be ferme and stable
To all the land it is vaylable
Only thorugh the grace of his person
For the pity of him allone
May all the large royame save
So sit it well a king to have
Pity / of this valere told
And said how that by days old
Godrus which was in his degree
King of athenes the cite
A werre he had against dorrence
And for to take his euydence
What shall lefalle of the battle
He thout he should him self counceyl
With appollo in whom he triste
Thorough whose answer thus he wyste
Of two points that he might chese
Or that he would his body lose
And in battle him self deye
Or ellis the second weye
To seen his people dyscomfyte
But he which pity has persyte
Upon the point of his believe
The people thought to releue
And chese him self to be deed
Where is now such another head
Which would for the lymmes deye
And nethelesse in sum parteye
It ought a kings heart stere
That he his lyege men forbere
And eke toward his enemies
Full often he may deserve prise
To take of pity remembrance
Where that he might do vengeance
For when he has the victory
And than he draw in to memory
To do pity instead of wreche
He may not fail of thylke speech
Whereof arises the worlds fame
To give a prince a worthy name
Hic ponit exe^plum de victoriosi principis pietate erga aduersarios suos / Et

iRede whylom that pompey
to whom that rome must obey
A werre had in Iupartye
Ageynste the king of ermonye
Which of long time had him grieved
But at last it was acheued
That this king dyscomfyte had
And forth with him to rome ladde
As prisoner where many a day
In sorry plyte and power he lay
The crown of his heed deposed
Within walls fast enclosed
And with full great humylete
He suffers his aduersite
Pompeye saw his pacyence
And took pity with conscience
So that upon his high deys
Tofore al rome in his paleys
As he that would upon him rewe
Let give him his corone new
And his estate full and plain
And restored of his reygne ageyn
And said it was more goodely thing
To make than to undone a king
To him which power had of both
Thus they weren long wroth
Accorden hem to fynal pres
And yet Justice nethelees
Was kept and in no thing offended
Whereof pompeye was commended
There may no king him self excuse
But if Justice be kept and use
Which for to esch we cruelte
He mote attempre with pity
Of cruelte the felonye
Engendered is of tyranny
Ageyn to whose condycion
God him self the champyon
Whose strength may no man withsto^de
For ever yet it has so stand
That god a tyrant over ladde
But where pity the reygne ladde
There might no fortune last
Which was grievous at last
The god him self it has redressed
Pity is thylke v^rtu blessed
Which never let his master fall
But cruelte though it so befalle
That it may reyne for a throlbe
God would it should be overthrow
Whereof ensaumples ben y now
Of hem that thylke mer^ll drowe
Hic loquitur contra illos qui tira^ni (...) potestate principatum optinentes

F cruelte I read thus
When the tyrant leoncyus
Was to thempyre of rome aryued
Fro which he has the strength priued
Of the pyt^us Iustynian
As he which was a cruel man
His nose of and lyppes both
He ^ut for he would him both
Unto the people and make him unable
But he which is al merciable
The high god ordeyneth so
That he within a time also
When he was strengest in his ire
Was shouen out of his empire
Tyberius the power had
And rome after his power he ladde
And for leonce in such a wise
Ordeyneth that he took Iuyse
Of nose and lyppes both two
For that he did another so
Which more worthy was than he
Lo which a fall has cruelte
And pity was set up ageyn
For after that the books s^yn
Terbellis king of bulgarye
With help of his chyualrye
Iustynyan has vnprisonned
And to thempyre ageyn coroned^
Hic boquitur ulterius de ^rude^f^te Situly necnon et de berillo eiusdem

ad sui interitus expiracionem iudicia^iter torquebatur

I^^ a cronycle I find also
Of siculus which was eke so
A cruel king like the tempest
To whom no pity might areste
He was the first as books s^ye
Upon the sea which fond galeye
And ^ete hem make for the werre
As he which was al out of herre
Fro pity and mysericorde
For thereto could he not accord
But whom he might s^een he slough
And thereof was he glad y nough
He had of counceyl many one
Emonge the which there was one
By name which brillus hight
And he bythought him how he myt
Unto the tyrannt do lykyng
And by his own ymagenyng
Let forge and make a tonne of bras
And on the side cast there was
A door where a man may in
And he his pain shall begin
Of fire which that men putten under
And all this did he for a wonder
That when a man for pain cried
The bull of bras which gapeth wide
It shall seem as though it were
Al belewyng in a mannys ere
And not the cryeng of a man
But he which al sleyghtes can
The devil that lies in hell fast
Him that this made has ouercaste
That for a trespace which he deed
He was put in the same stead
And was him self the first of all
Which was in to the pain fall
That he for other men ordeyneth
There was no man yt him compleyneth
Of tyranny and cruelte
By this ensaumple a king may see
him self and eke his counceyl both
How they be to mankind both
And to the god abhomynable
Ensaumples that been couenable
I find of other princes moo
As thou shall here of time ago
Nota hic de diomisio tira^no qui mire crude^^^atis seueritate eciam hospites
suos ad deuora^du^ equis suis tribuit cui hercules tandem super venientes
victum impium in impietate sua pari morte conclusit

The great tyrant dyonys
Which man's life set at no prys
Unto his horse full o^te he yafe
The men instead of corn and chafe
So that the h^rs of thylke stood
Deuoureden the maunes blood
Till fortune at last came
That hercules him ouercame^
And he right in the same wise
Of this tyrant took the Iuyse
As he till other has do
The same death he deyed also
That no pity him has socoured
Till he was of his life devoured
Nota hic de consimil^ lichaontis tira^nia qui carnes hoim^ hoi^b in suo
hospicio ad vescendum dedit cuius formam condicioni similem qualiter coequa^s
ipm^ in lupum transformauit

oF lychaan also I find
How he ageyn the law of kind
His host slew in to mete
And made her bodies to be e^e
With other men within his hows
But Iubyter the glorious
Which was meued of this thing
Vengeance upon this cruel king
So took that he fro man's form
In to a wolf he let transform
And thus the cruelte was kyd
Which of long time he had hyd
A wolf he was than openly
By whose nature pryuelye
He had in his condycion
And unto this conclusion
That tyrant is to dyspryse
I find ensaumple in sundry wife
And namelyche of hem full often
To whom fortune has set a^ofte
Upon the wars for to win
But how so that the wrong begin
Of tyranny it may not last
But such as they done at last
To other men such on hem falls
For ageyn such pity calls
Vengeance to the god above
For who that has no tender love
In saving of a mannys life
He shall be found so gyltyfe
That when he would mercy crave
In time of need he shall none have
Nota qualiter beo homi^b stratis percit

Of the nature thus I find
The fires lion in his kind
Which goes rampyng after his pray
If ^e a man find in his way
He will him slay if he withstonde
But if the man could understand
To fall anon tofore his face
In sign of mercy and of grace
The lion shall of his nature
Restreyne his ire in such mesure
As though it were a best y tamed
And torn aweye halfyng ashamed
That be the man shall no thing grieve
How should than a prince acheue
The worlds grace if that he would
D^^^r^ye a m^n when he is yolde
And stante upon his mercy all
But for to speken in specialle
There have be such and such there be
Tyrauntes whose hertes ne pity
May to no point of mercy plye
That they upon her tyranny
Ne gladen hem the men to slay
And as the ractes of the sea
Ben vnpytous in the tempeste
Right so may no pity rest
Of cruelte the great vltrage
Which the tyrant in his courage
Engenders has whereof I find
A tale now which comes to mind
Hic loquitur contra tira^nos illos qui cu^ in bello vicere possu^t hua^ni
sa^guinis effusio^ saturare nequeu^t et narrat in exemplu^ de quodam persa^
rege cuius nomen spertachus erat qui pre ceberis tu^c in orient bellicosus and

I Read in old books thus
There was a due which spertachus
Men cleped and was a wetrour
A cruel man a conqueror
With strong power which he ladde
For this condition he had
That where him happens the victory
His lust and al his glory
Was for to slay and not to save
Of rau^son would he no good have
For saving of a ma^nys life
But al goes to the sword and knyfe
So beef him was mannys blood
And nethelesse thus it stod^
So as fortune about went
He fyl right heir as by dyssent
To pers and was crowned king
And wha^ the worship of this (...) ynge
Was fall and he was king of pers
If that they weren first diverse
Has shape for upon a tide
When he was highest in his pride
In his rancour and in his hete
Ageyn the queen of mersagete
Which thamaris that time hight
He made werre all that he might.
And she which would her land defend
Her owue sone ageyn him send
Which the deffence has undertake
But he dyscomfyte was and take
And wha^ this king him had in hand
He would no mercy understand
But did him slay in his presence
The king of his vyolence
When it came to the moders ere
She send a^one ay wide where
To such friends as she had
A great power till that she lad
In sondre wise and tho she cast
How she this king may ouercaste
And at last accorded was
That in the danger of a paas
Thorugh which this tyrau^t should pas
She shope his power to compass
By strength of men by such a weye
That he shall not escape aweye
And when she had thus ordained
She has her own body feyned
For fere as though she would flee
Out of her land and when that he
Has herd how that this lady fled
So fast after the chase he spedde
That he was found out of array
For it betyd upon a day
In to the paas when he was fall
The enbusshementes to break all
And him beclypte on every side
That fle ne might he not a side
So that there were deed and take
Two hundred thousand for his sake
That weren with him of his host
And thus was leyed the great boost
Of him and of his tyranny
Hit helps not mercy for to cry
To him which whilom did none
For he unto the queen anon
Was brought and when that she him sye
This word she spoke and leyed on hye
O man which out of man's kind
Reason of man has left behind
And lived wors than a best
Whom pity might not areste
The mannys blood to shede and spylle
Thou had never yet thy fylle
But now the last time is come
That thy malice is overcome
And thou till other have mys do
Now shall be do to the right so
Tho bad this lady that men should
A vessel bring in which she would
See the vengeance of his Iuyse
Which she began anon deuyse
And took the princes which she ladde
By whom his chyef counceyl he had
And while hem left any brethe
She made hem blede to the death
In to the vessel where it stood
And when it was fulfilled of blood
She cast the tyraunte therein
And said to thus might thou win The lustres of thyn appetyte
In blood was whylom thy delight
Thou shall now drink al thy fylle
And thus only of gods will
He which that would him self sirau^ge
To pity fond mercy so strange
That he without grace is bore
So may it well shelbe therefore
That cruelte has no good end
But pity how so that it wend
Makes that god is merciable
If there be cause reasonable
Why that a king shall be pytous
But else if he be doubtous
To sleen in cause of rightwysnesse
It may be said no pytousnesse
But it is pusillanymyte
Which every prince should flee
For if pity mesure excede
Kynghode may not alwey proceed
To do Iustyse upon right
For it belongs to a knight
As gladly for to fight as rest
To set his liege people in rest
When that the war upon hem falls
For them he mote as it befalls
Of his knyghthode as a lion
Be to the people a champyon
Without vny pity feigned
For if manhood be restreyned
Or be it pees or be it werre
Justice goes out of herre
So that knyghthode is set behind
Of aristotle's lore ^ find
A king shall m^ ke good vysage
That no man know of his courage
But al honor and worthynesse
For if a king shall upon guess
Without v^r^y cause dread
He may be like to that I read
And though that it be like a fable
The ensaumple Is good and reasonable

I read whylom that an hell
Vp^n the lo^des of arc^^de
A wonder dredeful noise made
For so it fyl that ylke day
This hylle on his chyldyng lay
And when the th^^ was on him come
His ^oyse like the day of dome
Was fereful in mannys thought
Of things which that they see nout
But well they herden al about
The ^oyse of which they were in doubt
As they that wenden to be lore
Of thing which then was vubore
The nere this hylle was upon chance
To taken his delyueraunce
The more vnbuxumlyche he cried
Every man fled a side
For dread and left his own holbs
And at last it was a molbs
The which was lore and to notice
Bytake and tho they held hem nyce
For they withouten cause dradde
Thus if a king his heart ladde
With every thing that he shall here
Full often he should change his chere
And upon fantasye dread
When that there is no cause of dread
Nota hic secundum oracium de mag nanimo ^a^^de and pusillanime thersite

Orace to his prince told
That him were l^uer that he would
Upon knyghthede achylles sewe
In time of war than eschew
So as thersites did at troy
A chilles al his hole joy
Set upon arms for to fight
Thersytes sought all that he myggt
Unarmed for to stand and rest
But of the two it was the best
That achilles upon the need
Has do whereof that his knyghthede
Is yet commended over all
King salamon in specialle
Says as there is a time of pees
So is a time nethelees
Of werre of which a prince algate
Shall for the common right debate
And for hs own worship eke
But it behooves not to seek
Only the werre for worship
But to the right of his lordship
Which he is hold to deffende
Mote every worthy prince entende
Between the symplyesse of pity
And the fool have of cruelte
Where stante the hardynesse
Thereupon a king his heart adresse
When it is time for to forsake
And when time is also to take
The godely werres upon hand
That he shall for no dread wonde
If rightwisnes be withal
For god is mighty over al
To forther every man's truth
But it le thorugh his own slouthe
And namely the kings need
It may not fail for to speed
For he stante one for hem all
So mote it well the better fall
And well the more god favors
When he the comune right socoureth
And for to* see the soth in deed
Behold the bible and thou might read
Of great ensaumples many one
Whereof that I will tell one
Hic dicit quoth princeps iusticie causa bellum modo timere debet Et narrat
qualiter dux gedeon cum solis ^ercentis viris quinque Reges scilicet
Madianitharum amalichitarum amortanrum Amor^orum and ^^buseorum cum eoru^
excercitu qui ^d nonaginta milia numeratus est gracia cooperante diuina
victoriose infugam conuertit

uPon a time as it byfelle
Against Jude of Israelle
When sundry kings come were
I^ purpoos and to destroy the^e
The people which god kept tho
And stood m thylke days so
That gedeon which should led
The gods folk took him to read
And send m all the land about
Till be assembled has a route
With xxx thousand of deffence
To fight and make resystence
Ageyn the which he would assail
And nethelesse that one battle
Of three that were enemies
Was double more than was al his
Whereof that gedeon him drad
That he so litel people had
But he which al thing may help
Where that there lacks man's help
To gedeon his aungel sent
And bad or that he forther went
Al openly that he do cry
That every man in his party
Which would after his own will
In his delight abide stylle
At home in any manner wise
For purchase or for couetyse
For lust of love and lack of he^te
He should not about sterte
But hold him stylle in pees
Whereof upon the morrow he lees
Well xx thousand men and mo
Which after the cry ben goo
Thus was with him but only left
The third part and yet god efte
His aungel send and said this
To gedeon if it so is
That I thyn help shall undertake
Thou shall yet less pexle take
By whom my will is that thou speed
For thy to morrow take good head
Unto the flode when ye be come
What man that has the water nome
Upon his hand and lappeth so
To thy part chese out al ^^o
And him which weary is to swynke
Upon his Womb and lies to drink
Forsake and put hem al albeye
For I am mighty al weye
Where as me lyse my help to sewe
In good men though they be few
This gedeon a wayteth well ^
Upon the morrow and every delle
As god him bade right so he deed
And thus they laften in that stead
With him three hundred and no moo
The remenaunte was al a goo
Whereof that gedeon merueyleth
And thereupon with god counceylleth
Pleynyng as ferforth as he dare
And god that would ^e were ware
That he shall speed upon his right
Has bid him goo the same night
And took a man to him to here
What shall be spoke in this matere
Among the hethen enemies
So may he be the more wise
What afterward him shall befalle
This gedeon ^monges all
Phara to whom he tryst most
By night took toward thylke hooste
Which lodged was in a valeye
To here what they wolden seye
Upon his foot and as he ferde
Two sareyns spekyng he herd
Quod one arede my sweuen a right
Which I met in my sweuen to night
Me thought I saw a barley cake
Which fro the hill his weye has take
And came rollyng down at ones
And as it were for the nones
Forth in his course as it ran
The kings tente of madyan
Of amalech of amareye
Of amon and of Iebuseye
And many another tente mo
With great joy as me thought tho
It threw to ground and ouercaste
And al his host so sore agaste
That I woke for pure dread
This sweuen can I well arede
Quoth the other sareyn anon
The barley cake is Gedeon
Which fro the hylle down sodeynlye
Shall come and set such a skrye
Upon the kings and us both
That it shall to us al loathe
For in such dread he shall us bring
That if we hadden flight of wynge
The weye of foot in dyspayre
We shul leave and flee in the air
For there shall no thing him withsto^de
When gedeon has understand
This tale he thanked god of all
And pryuelye ageyn he stalle
So that no life him bath perceived
And than he has fully conceived
That he shall speed and there upon
The night sewyng he shope to gone
This multitude to assail
Now shall thou here a great marvel
With what wysdom that he wrought
The little people which he brought
Was none of hem that he ne has
A pot of earth which he tath
A light brennyng in a cresset
And each of hem eke a trompet
Bare in his hand eke beside
And thus upon the nyghtes tide
Du^ gedeon when it was derke
Ordeyneth him unto his work
And parted than his folk in three
And charge than that they ne fle
And taught hem how they should askrye
Al in one wise par company
And what word they should eke speak
And how they should her pottes break
Each one with other when they herd
That he him self so first ferde
For when they came in to the stead
He bad hem do right as he deed
And thus stalkyng forth a pa^s
This noble duc when time was
His pot he brake and loud ascryed
And tho they brake on every side
The trompe was not tho to seek
He blewe and so they blewen eke
With such a noise emonge hem all
As though the heaven should fall*
The hylle unto her voys auswerde
This host in the valey it herd
And says how that the hylle a light
So what of heryng and of sight
They caught such a sodeyn fere
That none of hem be left there
The tents holy they forsook
That they none other good took
But only with her body bare
They fled as does the wild hare
And ever upon the hylle they blewe
Till that they saw time and knew
That they be fled upon the rage
And when they wist their auau^tage
They fyl anon unto the chase
Thus myt thou see how gods grace
Unto the good avails
But, ellis oftyme it faylleth
To such as be not well disposed
This tale needs not to be glosed
For it is openly showed
That god to hem that been well thewed
Has give and granted the victory
So that thensaumple of this hystarye
Is good for every king to hold
First in him self that he behold
If he be good of his living
And yt the folk which he shall bring
Be good also for than he may
Be glad of many a^ merry day
In what that ever he has to done
For he which sit above the moon
In all thing may spylle and speed
In every caas and every need
His good king so well he dresseth
That al his foo men he represseth
So that there may no man him dear
And also well he can forbere
And suffer a wicked king to fall
In hands of his foon all
Hic dicit quoth vbi et quando causa and tempus requirunt princeps illos sub
potestate sua quos iusticie aduersarios suo^ agnouerit occidere de iure tenetur
Et narrat exemplum qualiter pro eo quoth saul regem agag in bello deuincit iuxta
samuelis consiliu^ occidere nolu it ipse diuino iudicio non sosum a regno
israel priuatus set and heredes sui pro perpetuo exhereditati sunt

n ow ferthermore if I shall seyn
Of my matter and torn ageyn
To speak of justice and pity
After the rule of ryalte
This may a king well understand
^enyghthode mote be take on hand
When that it stonte upon the need
He shall no rightful cause dread
No more of werre than of pees
If he will stand blameles
For such a cause a king may have
Better it is to slay than save
Whereof thou might ensaumple find
The high maker of mankind
By samuel to saul bade
That he shall no thing be ad^ad
Ageyn king agag for to fight
For this the godhede him behyght
That agag shall be overcome
And when it is so ferforth come
That saul him has dyscomfyte
The god bad make no respyte
That he ne should him slay anon
But saul let it over gone
And did not the gods heste
For agag made a great beheste
Of raunsom which he would gyu
King saul suffers him to live
And fayneth pity forth withal
But he which saw and knew all
The hye god of that he feyneth
To samuel upon him pleyneth
And send him word for that he l^f^e
Of agag that ne by refte
The life he shall not only deye
Him self but fro his regalye
He shall be put for ever mo
Naught but eke his air also
That it shall never come ageyn
Thus might thou see the sothe pleyne
Hic narrat vl^erius super eodem qualiter david in extremis iusticie caus^ vt
Ioab occideretur absque vlla remissione filio suo Salamoni iniunxit

tHat of to much and of to ly^^
Upon the princes stante ye wy^^
But ever it was a kings right
^o do the deeds of a knight
For in the hondes of a king
The death and life is al o thing
After the laws of Justice
To sl^en it is a dedely vice
But if a man the death deserne
And if a king the life preserve
Of him which ought for to deye
He sh^weth not the ensaumplerye
Which in the bible is euydente
How ^^^yd in his tes^amente
When he no longer might leave
Unto his sone in cherge has give
That he Ioab sheld slay algace
And when dauyd was gone his gate
The young wise salamone
Hi^ ^^ders heste did anon
And slew Ioab in such a wise
That they that herden the Iuyse
Ever after dredden him the more
And god was eke well paid therefore
That he so would his heart plye
The laws for to iustefye
And yet he kept forth with all
^yt^ a^ a prince shall
That he ne tyranny wrought
He fond the wysdom which he sought
And was so rightful nethelees
That al his life ^e s^ode in pees
That he no dedely wars had
For every man his wysdom dradde
And as he was him self wise
Right so the worthy men of pryse
He has of his counceyl withholde
For that is every princes hold
To make of such his retenue
Which wise ben and renew
The fools for there is no thing
That may be better about a king
Tha^ the oc^ceyl which is the substance
Of al a bynges governance
Hic dicit quoth pepulum sibi co^missu been re^ere super omnia principi
laudabilius est Et narrat in exemplum qualiter pro eo quoth salamon vt populu^
been regeret ab altissimo sapienciam specialius postulauit omma bona pariter
cum illa sibi habundancius aduerunt

iN salamon a man may see
What thing of most necessyte
Unto a worthy king bylongeth
When he his kingdom vnderfengeth
God bad him chese what he would
And said him that he have should
What he would ask of a thing
And he which was a noble king
For there upon his bone prayed
To god and in this wise said
O thing by whom that I shall regne
Give me wisdom that in my regne
Forth with the people which I have
To thyn honor may keep and save
When salamon with love has taxed
The god of that which he has axed
Was right well paid and granted sone
Not al only that he his bone
Shall have of that but of richesse
Of bele of pees and of hye nobleness
For with wysdomes at his axynges
Which stant^ above al erthly things
Hic dicit secundum Salamonem quoth regie magestatis imperium ante omia^ sano
consilio dirigendum est

Vt what king will his reygne save
First him behooves for to have
After thy god and his believe
Snche counceyl which is to believe
Fulfilled of troth and rightwysnes
But above al in his noblenes
Between the reddour and pity
A king shall do such equity
And set the balaunce in even
So that the high god in heaven
And all the people of his nobleye
Long unto his name seye
For most above al erthely good
Where that a king him self is good
It hel^th for in other weye
If so be that a king forsueye
Quidquid delirant reges plectuntur achiui

Vl of be it has be seyn
The common people is ouerleyn
And has the kings sin abought
Al though the people agylte naught
Of that the king his god mysserueth
The people takes that he deserves
Here in this world but ellis where
I note how he shall stand there
For thy good is a king to triste
First to him self as he ne wyste
None other help but god allone
So shall the rule of his person
Within him self thorugh providence
Ben of the better conscience
And for to find ensaumple of this
A tale I find and soth it is
Hic de lucio imperatore exemplum ponit qualiter princeps sui nominis famam a
secretis consiliarijs sapienter inuestigare debet et siquid in ea sinistru^
inuenerit prouisa discrecione ad dexteram conuertat

iN a cronycle it tells thus
The king of rome lucyus
Within his chamber upon a night
The steuard of his hows a knight
Forthwith his chamberleyn also
To counceyl had both two
And stoden by the chymne
To gyder spekyng al three
And happeth that the kings fool
Sat by the fire upon a stole
As he that with his babble played
But yet he herd all that they said
And therefore took they no head
A king hem axeth what to read
Of such matere as came to mowthe
And they him told as they couthe
When al was spoke of that they meant
The king with all his hole entente
Then at last hem axeth this
What king men tellen that he is
Among the folk touching his name
Or be it pris or be it blame
Right after that they herd sayn
He bad hem for to tell it plain
That they no peynte of soth forbere
By thylke feyth that they him bear
The stuard first upon this thing
Gafe his answer unto the king
And thought gloss in this matere
And said as far as he can here
His name is good and honorable
Thus was the steward favorable
That he the troth p^yne ne told
The king than axeth as he should
The chamberleyn of his auyse
And he that was subtyl and wise
And somdele thout upon his feythe
Him told how all the people seyth
That if his counceyl were true
They wist than well and knew
That of him self he should be
A worthy king in his degree
And thus the counceyl he accuses
In party and the king excuses
The fool which herd of all this caas
That time as gods will was
Se^th that they sayden not enough
And hem to scorn both lough
And to the king he said tho
Sir king if it were so
Of wysdom in thyn own mode
That thou thy self were good
Thy counceyl should not be bad
The king thereof merueyle had
When that a fool so wisely spacke
And of him self fond out the lack
Within his own conscience
And thus he felith euydence
Which was of gods grace ^nspyred
Makes yt good counceyl was desired
He put awey the vycious
And took to him the virtuous
The wrongful laws ben amended
The lands good is well dyspended
The people was no more opressed
And thus stood every thing redressed
For where a king is propre wise
And has such as him self is
Of his counceyl it may not fail
But every thing shall anayle
The vices than goes aweye
And every thing holds his way
Whereof the hye god is plesed
And all the lands folk esed
For if the common people cry
And that a king list not to plye
To here what the clamor would
And otherwise than he should
D^s^ayneth for to done hem grace
It has be seen in many place
There has be fall great contrary
And that I find of ensaumplerye
Hic dicit quoth seniores magis experti ad principis cousilium admittendi poci us
e^istuut / Et narrat qualiter pro co quoth roboas salomonis filius and here is
senium sermouibus renuncians dicta iunenum preelegit de duodecim tribus israel
a domino sud december penitus ami sit and sic cum duabus tautu^modo il^usus postea
regnauit

aFter the ^eth of salamone
When this wise king was gone
^n^ roboas in his person
Re^ryue should the corone
The people upon a parliament
Auysed were of one assent
And al unto the king they preyden
With comune voys and thus if (...) seyd^^
Our hege lord we the byseche
That thou receive our humble speech
And grant us which ye reason will
Or of thy grace or of thy skyl
Thy fader while he was on live
And might both grant and pryue
Upon the works which he had
The common people streyte ladde
When he the temple made new
Thing which men never tofore knew
He brought up than of his t^llage
And al was under the usage
Of works which he made tho
But now it is befalle so
That al is made right as he seyed
And he was rich when he deyd
So that it is no more need
If thou thereof wylt taken head
To pillen of the people more
Which long has be grieved sore
And in this wise we the seye
With tender heart we the preye
That thou relese thylke det^^
Which upon us thy fader set
And if the like to done so
We ben thy men for ever mo
To gone and comen at thyn he^^e
The king which herd this request
Says that he will ben aduysed
And has thereof a time assysed
And in the which ^s he him thout
Upon this thing counceyl he sought
And first the wise knights old
To whom that he his tale told
Counceyllen him in this manner
That he with love and with glad chere
Foryeue and grant all that is axed
Of that his fader had taxed
For so he may his reygne acheue
With thing which shall him litel grieve
The king hem herd and over passes
And with this other his wit co^passeth
That young were and no thing wise
And they that these old men despys^
And saiden sit it shall be shame
For ever unto thy worthy name
If thou ne keep not thy right
While thou art in thy young might
Which that thyn old fader gate
But say unto the people plate
That while thou lyuest in thy land
The least finger of thyn hand
It shall be strenger over al
Than was thy fader body all
And thus also shall be thy tale
If he hem smote with rods small
With scorpyons thou shall hem smite
And where thy fader took a lite
Thou thynkest to take mychel more
Thus shall thou make hem dread sore
The great heart of thy courage
So for to hold hem in seruage
This young king him has co^formed
To done as he was last informed
Which was to him undoing
For when it came to the spekyng
He has the young counceyl hold
That he the same words told
Of all the people in audyence
And when they herd the sentence
Of his malice and the manace
Anon tofore his own face
They have him entyerly refused
And with full great reprove accused
So they began for to rave
That he him self was feign to save
For as the wild wode rage
Of wyndes makes the sea savage
And yt was calm brings to wawe
So for defaute and grace of law
This people is stered al at ones
And forth they goo out of his wones
So that of the lignage twelfe
Two tribus only by hem self
With him abyden and no moo
So were they for ever moo
Of no return without espryre
Departed fro the rightful heir
Al Israel with common voice
A king upon her own choice
Among hem self anon they make
And have her young lord forsake
A polber knight jeroboas
They took and left roboas
Which rightful heir was by dyssent
Thus the young cause went
For that the counceyl was not good
The reygne fro the rightful blood
Ever afterward divided was
So may it prouen by this caas
That young cou^ceyl which is to warm
Or men be ware does often harm
Old age for the counceyl serves
And lusty yongth his thonke deserves
Upon the traueyle which he does
And both for to say a sothe
By sundry cause for to have
If that he will his wygne save
A king behooves every day
That one can and that other may
Be so the king both rule
Or else al goes out of rule
Nota questionem cuiusdam philosophi vtrum regno conueniencius foret principem
optare sapientem quam cum sano consilio ipsum eligere insipientem

aNd upon this matere also
A questyon between the two
Thus written in book I fond
Whether it be better for the land
A king him self to be wise
And so to bear his own pryse
And that his counceyl be not good
Or other^^kse if it so stood
A king if he be vycious
And his counceyl be virtuous
It is answered in such a wise
That better it is that they be wise
By whom the counceyl should gone
For they be many and he but one
And rather shall an only man
With f^ls counceyl for ought he can
From his wysdem be made to fall
Than he allone should hem all
Fro vices unto virtues change
For t^^t is well the more strange
For thy the ^onde may well be glad
Wh^s king with good cou^ceyl is lad
Which set him unto rightwysnes
So that his high worthynes
Between the reddeur and pity
Does mercy forth with equity
A king is holden over all
To pity and in specialle
To ^^m where he is most behold
Thy should his pite most behold
That b^n the ^^ges of the ^onde
For they ben ever under his hand
A f^^r the go^des ordenaunce
To stand under his governance
Nota ad^u^ precipue de principis ^^ga suos subditos debita pietate legitur
^nim ouabter anthonius a scipion^ exemplificatus dixit quod mallet vnum de
populo sibi commisso viru^ sa^uare ^uam centum ex hostibus a^enigenis in be^lo
perdere

oF the emperor anthonyus
I find h^w he said thus
That lever him were for to save
One of his lieg^s than to have
Of enemies an hundred deed
As thus he learned as I read
Of Cypyo which had be
Consul of Rome and thus to see
Dru^rs ensaumples how they stand
A king which has ^ charge on hand
The common people to gou^rne
If that he will be may well learn
Is none so good to the plesaunce
Of god as is good gouerna^^^e
And every governance is due
The pity thus I may argue
That pity is the foundemente
Of every kings reygnemente
If it be medlyd with justice
They two remeu^n al vice
And be of virtue most vaylable
To make a kings royame stable
Lo thus the four points tofore
In governance as they be bore
Of troth first and of laregsse
Of pity forth with rightwisnesse
I have hem told and over this
The first point so as it is
Set of the rule of polecye
Whereof a king shall modefye
The flesshly lus^es of nature
Now think I tell of such mesure
That both kind shall be served
And eke the law of god observed
Corporis et mentis regem decet omnis honestas / Nominis vt famam nulla libido
r^at / Omne quoth est hominis effe minat illa voluptas / Sit n^si magnanimi cordis
vt obstat ei

Hic tractat secundum aristotilem de quinta principum xegiminis pol^cia quam
castitatem concernit cuius honestas im pudicicie motus obtemporans tam cor
poris quam anime mundiciciam specialius pres^rnat

tHe male is made for the femele*
But where as one desires feel
That needs not by weye of kind
For when a man may ready find
His own wife what should he s^che
In strange places to beseech
To borowe another man's plough
When he has great good yuough
Affayted at his own heste
And is to him well more honest
Than other thing which unknow
For thy should every good man know
And think how that in marriage
His troth plyte lies in morgage
Which if he break it is falsehede
And that discordeth to manhede
And namely toward the great
Whereof the books al trete
So as the phylosophre techeth
To alysaunder and him bytecheth
The lore how that he shall mesure
His body so that no mesure
Of flesshly lust he shall excede
And thus forth I shall proceed
The first point as I said ere
Is chastyte which selde where
Comes now a days in to place
But nethelesse but it be grace
Above al other in specialle
Is none that chaste may ben all
But yet a knights high estate
Which of his order as a prelate
Shall be enoynted and scifyed
He mote be more magnefyed
For dygnyte of his corone
Than should another low person
Which is not of so high empryse
Therefore a prince* him should advise
Or that he fall in such ryote
And namely that he ne assote
To change for the womanhede
The worthynesse of his manhede
Nota de doctriua aristotiles quasi ter princeps vt animi sui iocundita t^^^
prouocet mulieres formosas c^^bro aspicere debet caveat tamen ne men's vo
luptuosa torpesceus ex carnis fragilita te in vicium dilabatur

F aristotle I have well radde
How he to alysaunder badde
That for to gladen his courage
He should beholden the vysage
Of wymmen when that they ben fair
But yet he set an exaumplayre
His body so to guide and rule
That he ne pass mote the rule
Whereof that he him self begyle
For in the wymmen is no gyle
Of that a man him self bywapeth
When he his own wit by iapeth
I can the woman well excuse
But what man will upon him muse
After the folyssh Impressyon
Of his ymagynacion
Within him self the fire he blows
Where of ye woman no thing knows
So may she no thing be to Wit
For if a man him self excite
To drenche and will it not forbere
The water shall no blame bear
What may ye gold though men coueite
If that a man will live streyte
The woman has him no thing bound
If he his own heart wound
She may not let the folly
And though so fyl of company
That he might any thing purchase
Yet makes a man the first chase
The woman flees and he purseweth
So that by the weye of skyl it sueth
The man is cause how so befalle
That he full often sithe is fall
Where that he may not well arise
And netheles full many wise
Befooled has hem self or this
As now a days yet it is
Emonge the men and ever was
The s^ronge is febelest in this caas
It sit a man by were of kind
To love but it is not kind
A man for love his wit to lose
For if the month of Iuyle shall frese
And that decembre shall be hot
The year mystorneth well I wow
To seen a man fro his estate
Thorugh his soty eff^mynate
And leave that a man shall do
It is ^s hose above the shoo
To man which ought not to be used
But yet the world has often accused
Full great princes of this deed
How they for love hem self myslede
Whereof manhood stood behind
Of old ensaumples as I find
Hic ponit exemplum qualiter pro ^o ^d Sardanapallus assirioru^ prin^^ps m^^eri

adhibebat a barboro Rege ^^doru^ super h^c insidiante in sui feruo ris maiori
voluptate subitis mutacioni bus ext^nctus est

These old gestes tellen thus
That whylom Sordanapallus
Which held al hole in his empire
The great kingdom of assyre
Was thorugh the sloth of his courage
Fall in to the ylke fyry rage
Of love which the man assoteth
Where of him self so ryot^th
And wexeth so ferforth womannysshe
That ageyn kind as a fysshe
A bide would upon the land
In wymmen such a lust he fond
That he dwelt ever in chamber stylle
And only wrought after the will
Of wymmen so as he was bid
That seldom when in other stead
If that he would wenden out
To seen how that it stod^ about
But there he kyste and there he played
They taughten him a lace to ^^ayed
And weue a purs and to enfyle
A perle and fyl thylke while
One barbar^s the prince of mede
Sees the king in womanhede
Was fall fro chyualrye
And gate him help and company
And wrought so that at last
This king out of his reygne he cast
Which was undone for ever moo
And yet men speken of him so
That it is shame for to here
For thy to love is in manner
Nota qualiter david amans muli^re^ propter hoc probitat^m armorum non minus
excercuit

King david had many a love
But nethelesse alweye above
Knyghthode he kept in such a wise
That for no flesshly couetyse
Of lust to lygge in lady arms
He left not the lust of arms
For where a prince his lus^^s sueth
That he the werre not purseweth
when it is time to been armed
His contre stante full often harmed
When the enemies be wexe bold
That they deffence none behold
Full many a land has so be lore
As men may read often time tofore
Of hem that so her ^ases soughten
Which after they full dear aboughten
Hic locuit^r qualiter regnum lasa ui^ voluptatibus deditum de facili vin ^t^r
Et ponit exemplum de ciro rege persarum qui cum ^ddo^ miru^ probita it is
strenuissimos sibiq in ^^llo aduer sant^s nullo modo vincere potuit cum ipsis
tandem pacis tractatum dissimilans ^^^ordiam finalem stabilre finx it superquo
^ddi postea per aliquod t^mpus armis insoluti sub pacis tempore voluptatibus
intendebant Quod cir^^ percipiens in eos armatus subito irruit ipsos que
indefensibiles vincens sub imperio tri^^tarios subiugauit

tO mochel ease is no thing worth
For it sets every vice forth
And every virtue put a back
Whereof price torneth in to lack
As in a cronyke I may reherce
Which tells how the king of pers^
That cyrus hight a werre had
A geynst the people which he dradd^
Of a court which lyddos hight
But yet for ought that he do might
As in battle upon the werre
And had o^ hem alwey the werre
And when he saw and wist it well
That he by strength wan no dele
Then at last he cast a wyle
This worthy people to begyle
And took with hem a feigned p^e^
Which should last endelees
So as he said in words wise
But he thought al in otherwise
For it btyd upon the caas
When that this people in rest was
They token ese many fold
And worlds ^se as it is told
By way of kind is the noryce
Of every lust which touches vice
Thus when they were in lusts fall
The werres ben forgeten all
Was none which would the worship
Of arme^ but in ydelshyp
They putten business aweye
And took hem to dance and pleye
But most above al other things
They token hem to the lykynges
Of flesshly lusts that chastyte
Received was in no degree
But every man does what him list
And when the king of pers it wyste
That they unto folly entenden
With his power wha^ they lest we^den
More suddenly than does the thonder
He came and put hem under
And thus has lecherye lore
The land which had be tofore
The best of hem that were tho
And in the bible I find also
Nota hic qualiter facta belli luxus infortunat Et narrat quoth cum Rex amolech
hebreis sibi insultantibus resis tere nequijt consilio balaam mulieres regni
sui pulcherimas in castro hebre orum misit qui ab ipsis conta^inath graciam
statim an^iserunt Et ^^c ab amalech deuicti in magna multituine gladio ^^aderunt

a Tale like unto this thing
How amalech the payen king
When that he might by no weyr
Defend his land and put albeyr
The very people of Israel
This sarasyn as it byfelle
Thorough the counceyl of balaam
A rowte of fair women nam
That lusty were and young of age
And bad hem goo to the lynage
Of these ebrewes and forth they went
With eyes greye and brolbes bente
And well arrayed every chone
And when they comen were anon
Among the brethes was none in sight
But catch who that catch might
And each of hem his sustes sought
Which after they full dear bought
For grace anon began to fail
That when they ^^men to battle
Than after that in se^y plyte
They were take and dyscomfyte
So that within a l^tel throw
The might of hem was overthrow
That whylom were wont to stand
Till ph^nces the cause on hand
Has take this vengeance last
But than it c^sed at last
For god was poyed of that he deed
For where be fond upon a stead
A (...) which mysferred so
(...)te hem both two
(...)ge in mennys eye
(...) which hem sye
Ensaumyled hem upon the deed
And ^ra^ed unto the godhede
Her old sins for to amend
And he which would his mercy send
M^s^o^ed hem to new grace
This may it show in sundry place
Of chas^yte how that clennesse
Accords to worthynesse
Of men of arms over all
But most of all in specialle
This verta a ^yng ^ylongeth
For upon his fortune it hongeth
Of that his bond shall speed or spylle
For thy but if a king his will
Fro ^ustes of his flesh restreyne
Against him self he makes a treyne
In to the which if that he slide
Him were better goo beside
For eurye man may understand
How for a time that it stand
It is a sorry lust to like
Wh^s end makes a man to syke
And torneth joys in to sorrow
The ^r^ght son by the morrow
Beshyueth not the derke night
The lusey yongthe of man's might
In age but it stand we^e
Mystorneth all the last where
Hic boquitur qualiter principum irre gulat^ voluptas eos et semita recta
multociens deuiare compellit / Et narrat exemplum de salamone qui ex sue carnis
concupiscencia victus mu^ierum blandimentis in sui scandalum deos a^^enos
color presumebat

tHat every worthy prince is hold
Within him self him self behold
To see the state of his person
And think how there be joys none
Upon this earth made to last
And how the flessh shall at last
The lusts of his life forsake
Him ought a great ensaumple take
Of salamon whose appetyte
Was holy set upon delight
To take of wymmen the plesaunce
So that upon his ygnor^unce
The wide world meruayleth yet
That he which al men's wit
In thylke time has ouerpassed
With flesshly lusts was so cassed
That he which had under law
The people of god him self withdraw
He has fro god in such a wise
That he worship and sacrefyse
For sundry love in sundry stead
Unto the false gods deed
This was the wise ecclesiaste
The fame of whom shall ever last
That he the mighty god forsook
Ageyn the law when he took
His wives and his concubynes
Of hem that were sarazyns
For which he did ydolatrye
For this I read of his sotye
O she of sydone so him ladde
That he knelyng his fader spradde
So strat^h^n with great humblesse
Which of her bond was the goddess
And she that was of moabyte
So ferforth made him to delight
Thorugh lust which al his wit deuou
reth / That he chamos her god honou
reth / And other amonyt also
With love him has assoted so
Her god moloche that with encence
He sacreth and does reverence
In such a wise as she him badde
Thus was the wysest ouerladde
With blind lusts which he sought
But he it afterward abought
Nota hic qualit achias propheta in fig nu^ quoth regna pest mortem sabomonis ob
eius peccatum a suo herede dimuneretur pallu^^ suum in duodecim parts scidit
vnde dece^ parts Ieroboe filio nabul qui regnaturus postea successit precep to
dei tribuit

fOr achyas soleuytes
Which was prophet or his deces
While he was in his lusts all
Betokens what shall after fall
For on a day when that he met
Jeroboam the knight he grette
And bad him that he should abide
To here what him shall betyde
And forth with all achyas cast
His mantel of and also fast
He cut it in to py^ces twelfe
Whereof two parties toward him self
He kept and all the remenaunte
As ^od has set his couenaunte
He took unto Ioroboas
Of nab^l which the sone was
And of the ^ynges court a knyt
And said him such is gods myt
As thou have seen departed here
My mantel in such manner
After the death of salamon
God has ordained thereupon
This reygne than he shall deuyde
Which time thou shall eke abide
And upon that dyuysyon
Thy reygne as in proporcion
As thou have of my mantel take
Thou shall receive I undertake
And thus the sone shall abye
The lusts and the lecherye
Of him which now his fader is
So for to taken head of this
It sit a king well to be chaste
For else he may lighlly waste
Him self and eke his reygne both
And that ought every king to both
O which one sin vyolente
Whereof a king was shente
That the vengeannce of his person
Was not Enough to take alone
But afterward when he was passed
It has his heritage ^assed
As I more openly tofore
The tale told and thus tofore
The phylosophre upon this thing
Write and counseyld to a king
That he the forfete of luxure
Shall tempre and rule of such mesure
Which be to kind suffyciaunte
And eke to reason accordaunte
So that the lusts ygnoraunce
By cause of mysgouernance
Thorugh which that he be overthrow
As he that will no reason know
For but if a ma^nys wit be swerued
When kind is dulyche served
It ought of reason to suffyse
For if it fyl him otherwise
He may the lusts sore dread
For of anthony thus I read
Which of seuerus was the sone
That he his life of comune wone
Yaue holy unto thylle vice
And often time he was so nyce
Whereof nature has her compleyned
Unto the god which has disdeyued
The works which anthony wrout
Of lusts which he full sore abought
For god his forfete has so wroke
That in cron^ke it is yet spoke
But for to took r^men ^r^unce
Of specyal mysg^uernaunce
Thorugh c^uetyse and ^niustyce
Forth with the remenaunt of vice
And namesye of lecherye
I find write a great party
In a tale as thou shall here
Which is the saumple of this matere
Hic b^quitur de tarquino nuper Rome ^patore necno^ and de eiusdem filio noie^
arr^us ^ oim^ vicieru^ vari^ta^ repleti ta^ in h^^e^s quam in muli^res innumera
sc^le ra propetraui^t set specialif super hijs oue contra gabinos fraudulenter
operati sunt tractare intendit

SO as these old gestes seyn
The proud tyrauntee Romayn
T^rquynus which was then king
And wrout many a wro^gful thing
Of so nes he had many one
Emenge the which arrous was one
^y^e to his fader of manners
So that within few years
With treson and with tyranny
They won of land a great party
And token head of no Justice
Which dew was to her office
Upon the rule of governance
But all that ever was ^lesaunce
Unto the flesshes lust they took
And fyl so that they undertook
A werre which was not acheued
But often time he had hem grieved
A^eyn the folk which than hight
The gabyens and al by night
Thus arrous when he was at home
In rome a pryup place he nome
Within a chaumbre and beat him self
And made him wou^des x or twelfe
Upon the bakke as he was sce^
And so forth with his hurtes grene
In all the haste that he may
He rode and came that other day
Unto gabye the cite
And in he went and when that he
Was know anon the yates was shet
The lords al upon him set
With drawn swerdes in hand
And arrous would hem not withstonde
And said I am here at your will
As lecf it is that ye me spylle
As if mine own fader deed
And forth within that same stead
He prayed hem that they would see
And told hem in what degree
His fader and his bredern both
Which he said weren wroth
Him had beten and reuyled
And out of rome for ever exyl^d
And thus he made hem to believe
And said if that he might a^heue
His purpoos it shall well be yolde
By so that they him help would
When that the lords herd sayn
How wooful he was besayn
They took pity of his grieve
And yet it was hem wonder ^eue
That rome him had exyled so
This Gabyens by coun^^yl tho
Upon the gods made him swear
That he should to hen^ truth bear
And strength hem with all his might
And they also him has b^hyght
To helpen hem in his ouar^le
They shopen then for his h^le
That he was bathed and anoynte
Till that he was in lusty point
And what he would than he had
That he al hole the cite ladde
Right as he would him self deuyse
And than he thought him in ye whse
He might his tyranny show
And took to his counceyl a shrewe
Whom to his fader forth he sent
And in his message he tho went
And prayed his fader for to say
By his auyse he find a weye
How they might the cite win
While he stood so well therein
And when the messenger was come
To rome and has in counceyl nome
The king it fell perchance so
That they were in a gardyn tho
This messager forth with the king
And when he had told the thing
In what manner that it stood
And that turquynus understood
By the message how that it ferde
Anon he took in hand a yerde
And in the gardyn as they gone
The lyly croppes one and one
Where that they were sprongen out
He smote of as they stood about
And said unto the messengere
Lo this thing which I do now here
Shall be instead of thyn answer
And in this wise as I me bear
Thou shall unto my sone tell
And he no longer would dwell
But took his leave and goes with all
Unto his lord and told him all
How that his fader had do
When arrous herd him tell so
Anon he wist what it mente
And thereto set al his entente
Till he thorugh fraud and trechery^
The princes h^edes of gabye
Has smyten of and al was won
His fader came t^fore the son
In to the town with the romeyns
And took and slew the cyteseyns
Without reason or pyce
That he no spares no degree
And for the speed of this conqueste
He let do make a rich feste
With a solemn sacrefyse
In phoebus temple and in this wise
When the romans assembled were
In presence of hem al there
Upon the auter when al was dygkt
And that the fyres were a light
From under the auter suddenly
An hydous serpent openly
Came out and has deuoured^ all
The sacrefyse and eke with all
The fyres queynte and forth anon
So as he came so is he gone
In to the deep ground ageyn
And every man began to s^yn
A lord what may this sygnefye
And thereupon they pray and cry
To phoebus that they myt know
The cause and he the same throw
With gastely voys that al it herd
The romans in this wise answerde
And said how for the wickedness
Of pride and of vnrightwysnesse
That tarquyne and his sone has do
The sacrefyse is wasted so
Which might not ben axceptable
Upon such sin abhomynable
And over that yet he hem wysseth
And says which of hem first kysseth
His mother he shall take wreche
Upon the wrong and of that speech
They ben within her hertes glade
Though they no semblaunce made
There was a knyt which buitus hight
And he with all the haste he might
To ground fyl and there kyste
But none of hem the cause wyste
But wend that he had sporned
Perchance and so was turned
But brutus al another mente
For he knew well in his entente
How therthe of every man's kind
Is mother but they weren blind
And saw not so far as he
But when they leften the cite
And comen home to rome ageyn
Than every man which was romeyn
And mother has to her he bend
And kyst and each of hem wend
To be the first upon the chance
Of torquyne for to do vengeance
So as they herden phelus seyn
But every time has his certain
So must it needs then abide
Till afterward upon a tide
Hic narrat quoth cum tarquinus in obsidione ciuitatis ardee vt eam destru eret
intentus fuit Arrous filius eius romam secreto adie^s in domo collatini
hespitatus est vbi de nocte illam castis simam dominam secret lucreciam yma
ginata fraud vi oppressit vnde illa pre dolor mortua ipse cum tarquino patri
suo tota clamante Roma impperm^ exilium delegati sunt

tArquinus made vnskylfully
A werre which was fast by
Ageyn a town with walls strong
Which ardea was cleped long
And cast a sege there about
That there may no man pass out
So it befyl upon a night
Arrous which had his souper dyght
A part of the chyualrye
With him to sowpe in company
Has bid and when they comen were
And set at sowper there
Emonge her other words glade
Arrous a great spekyng made
Who had tho the best wife
Of rome and there began a stryf
For arrous says he has the best
So iangle they withouten rest
Till at last one collatyne
A worthy knight and was cosyne
To arrous said him in this wise
It is quoth he of none emprise
To speak a word but of the deed
Thereof it is to take heed
Anon for thy this same tide
Lepe on thy horse and let us ride
So may we know both two
Unawarely what our wives do
And that shall be a true assaye
This arrous says not ones nay
On horsbacke anon they lepte
In such manner and no thing slepte
Rydyng forth till that they come
Al pryuelye within rome
In strange place and down they light
They took a chamber out of sight
They ben dysgysyd for a throw
So that no life should hem know
And to that paleys first they sout
To see what thing this lady wrout
Of which arrous made a vaunte
And they her saw al glad semblau^t
Al full of myrthes and of bordes
But emonge al other words
She spoke not of her husbond
And when they had al understand
Of thylke place what hem list
They gone hem forth that none it wist
Beside thylke yate of bras
Collacea which cleped was
Where collatyn has his dwelling
There founden they at home sittyng
Lncrece his wife al enuyronned
With women which were abandoned
To werche and she wrought also with all
And bade hem haste and says it shall
Before my husbondes were
Which with his sword and his spear
Lies at siege in great dysese
And if it should him not dysplese
Now would god I had him here
For certes till that I may here
So^me good tydyng of his estate
My heart is ever upon debate
For so as al men witness
He is of such an hardynesse
That he*can not him self spare
And that is al my most care
When they the walls should assail
But if my wysshes might avail
I would it were a groundeles pytte
By so the siege were vnknytte
And I my husbond sye
With that the water in her eye
Aroos that she ne might stop
And as men seen the dew bedroppe
The leaves and the flowers eke
Right so upon her whyt cheke
The wooful salt teeris fell
When collatyn has herd her tell
The menyng of her true heart
A none with that to her he sterte
And said loo my good dear
Now is he come to yon here
That ye most bouen as ye sayn
And she with goodely chere ageyn
Byclypte him in her arms small
And the color which erste was pale
To beauty than was restored
So that it might not be mored
The kings sone which was nyghe
And of this lady herd and syghe
The things as they ben befalle
The reason of his wits all
Has lost for love upon his part
Came than and his fyry darte
With such a wound him has y smite
That he must needs feel and wit *
Of thylke blind maladye
To which no cure of surgerye
Can help but yet nethelees
At thylke time he, held his pees
That he no countenance made
But openly with words glade
So as he could in his manner
He spoke and made frendely chere
Till it was time for to go
And collatyne with him also
His leave took so that by night
With all the haste that they might
They ryden to the syege ageyn
But arous was so woo byseyn
With thoutes which upon him ro^ne
That he al by the broad son
To bed goes not for to rest
But for to thenke upon the best
And the fairest forth with all
That ever he saw or ever shall
So as him thought in his courage
Where he portreyed her image
First the fetures of her face
In which nature had al grace
Of womanlye bewte bysette
So that it might not be bette
And how her yelow here was tressed
And her atyre so well adressed
And how she wept all this he thout
And how she spoke and how she wrout
That he foryeten has no dele
But al it aketh him so well
That in word or in deed
Her lacked nout of womanhede
And thus this tyra^nysshe knight
Was soupled but not half a right
For he none other head took
But that he might by sum croke
Al though it were ageyn her will
The lusts of his flessh fulfylle
Which love was not reasonable
For where honor is remeuable
It ought well to ben aduysed
But he which has his lust assysed
With medlyd love and tyra^nye
Has found upon his trecherye
A weye which he thinks to hold
And says fortune unto the bold
Is favorable for to help
And thus within him self to yelpe
As he which was a wild man
Upon his treson he began
And up he sterte and forth he went
On horsbacke but his entente
There knew no wyglt and he name
The next day till he came
Unto cellocea the yate
Of rome and yt was somdele late
Right even upon the son set
As he which had shape his net
Her Innocence to berrappe
And as it should so myshappe
As pryu^lye as ever he might
He rode and of his horse alyght
Tofere cellatynes Inn
And al frendeliche he goes him in
As he that was cosyn of house
As she which is the good sponse
Lucrece when that she him syghe
With goodely chere drew him nyghe
And she which al honor supposes
And him so as she dare opposes
How it stood of her busbond
And he tho did her understand
With tales feyned in his wise
Right as he would him self deuyse
Whereof he might her heart glade
That she the better chere made
When she the glad words herd
How that her busbond ferde
And thus the truth was deceived
With shye treson which was perayued
To her which mente al good
For as the festes than stood
His souper was right well arrayed
But yet he has no word assayed
To speak of love in no degree
But with covert subtylte
His frendely speches he affayteth
As the tygre his time awayteth
In hope for to catch his ^raye
When that the herdes were aweye
When they have souped in the halle
He says that sleep is on him fall
And prays he mote goo to bed
And he with all haste spedde
So as her thought it was to done
That every thing was ready sone
She brought him to his chamber tho
Ann took her live and forth is goo
In to her own chamber by
And she that wend certeynly
Had had a friend and had a foo
Whereof fyl after mochel woo
This tyrant though he lie soft
Out of his bed he roos full often
And goes about and leyed his ere
To harken till that al were
To bed goon and sleped fast
And than upon him self he cast
A mantel and his sword al naked
He took in hand and she vnwaked
A bed lay but what she met
God wot for he the door vnshette
So pryue lie that none it herd
The soft paas and forth he ferde
Unto the bed where that she slepte
Al sodeynlye and in he crepte
And her in both his arms took
With that this worthy wife awoke
Which for tenderness of womanhede
Her voice has lost for pure dread
That one word speak she ne dare
And eke he bad her to be ware
For if she made noise or cry
He said his sword lay fast bye
To slay her and her folk about
And thus he brought her in doubt
That like a lamb when it is cesed
In wolves mowth so was she sesed
Lucrece which he naked fond
Whereof she swouned in his hand
And as who says lay deed oppressed
And he which al him had adressed
To lust took than what him list
And goes his were that none it wist
In to his own chamber ageyn
And cleped out his chamberleyn
And made him ready for to ride
And thus this lecherous pride
To horse lepte and forth he rode
And she which in her bed abode
When that she wist he was a gone
She cleped after light anon
And up aroos long or the day
And kyst aweye her fresshe array
As she which has the world fors^^
And took upon the clothes blake
And ever upon contynueng
Right as men see a well spring
With eyes full of wooful treas
Her here hangyng about her eerys
She wept and no man wist why
For yet emonge full pytouslye
She prayed that they nolden dretche
Her husbond for to fetch
Forthwyth her fader eke also
Thus they comen both two
And brutus came with collatyne
Which to lucrece was cosyne
And in they wenten al three
To chamber where they might see
The woofullest upon this molde
Which wept as she to water should
This chamber door anon was stoke
Or they have ought unto her spoke
They see her clothes al dysgysed
And how she has her self despised
Her here hangyng unkempt about
But nethelesse she began to lowte
And knele unto her husbonde
And he would feign have understand
The cause why she fared so
With soft words axeth tho
What may you he my good sweet
And she which thout her self unmeet
And the least worth of wymmen all
Her wooful chere let down fall
For shame and could uneaths look
And they thereof good head took
And prayden her in all weye
That she ne spare for to say
Unto her friends what her ayleth
Why she so sore her self bewayleth
And what the sothe would mean
And she which has her sorrow grene
Her woo to tell then assayeth
But tender shame her word delayeth
That sundry times as she mente
To speak upon the point she stente
And they her beden ever in one
To tell forth and there upon
When that she saw she most need
Her tale between shame and dread
She told not without pain
And he which would her wo^ restreyne
Her husbond a sorry man
Comfort her all that he can
And swore and eke her fader both
That they with her be not wroth
Of that is do against her will
And prayden her to be stylle
For they to her hane al foryeue
But she which thought not to leave
Of hem will no foryeuenesse
And said of thylke unkindness
Which was to her body wrought
Al were it so she might it nonght
Here afterward the world ne shall
Reprouen her and forth with all
Or any man thereof be ware
A naked knyf the which she bare
Within her mantel priuelye
Between her hondes sodaynlye
She took and thorugh her heart it thro^ge
And fyl to ground and ever among
When that she fyl so as she might
Her clothes with her hand she right
That no man dounward fro the knes
Should any thing of her see
Thus lay this wife honestlye
Al though she deyed woofullye
Tho was no sorrow for to seek
Her husbond and her fader eke
A swoune upon the body fell
There may no man's tongue tell
In which anguysshe that they were
But brutus which was with hem there
Toward him self his heart he kept
And to success anon he lep^^
The blody sword and pulls out
And swear the gods al about
That he thereof shall do venge^unce
And she tho made a c^untenaunce
H^^ b^dely eye and at lost
In th^^ king as it were up cast
And so he held him in the wise
While she to book may suffyse
And brutus with a manly heart
Her husbond has made up stert^
Forthwyth her fader eke also
In all haste and said than the
That they anon without let
A bear for the body fet^^
^uc^^ce and there upon bledyng
He l^y^d and so forth without cryeng
He goes unto the market place
Of rome and in a litel space
Thorugh cry the cite was assembled
And every man's heart trembled
When they the soth herd of the ca^s
And there upon the counceyl was
Take of the great and of the small
And brutus told hem all the tale
And thus came in to remembrance
Of sin of the contynnaunce
Which arrous had do tofore
And eke long time or he were low
^f that his fader had do
The ^^ronge came in to the place the
Of that the common clamor told
The new shame of sins old
And all the town began to cry
Aweye aweye the tyranny
Of lecherye and of couetyse
And at last in such a wise
The fader in the same while
Forthwith the sone they exyle
And taken better governance
But yet another remembrance
That rightwisnes and lecherye
Accorden not in company
With him that has ye law on hand
That may a man well understand
As by a tale thou shall wy^e
Of old ensaumple as it is write
Hic ponit exemplum super eod^m ^ua^^ter huius virginen^ dux ex^^ ^^tus
remanc^^m vnicam fikam pulcherimam habens cum quodam neb^^i vi^^ nomine ^^cio
vt i^^m in vxorem du^^ret fina^^ter concord^uit / Set interim apius claudius
tune ^^n perator virginis formesitatem vt eam violaret concupiscens occasiones
quius matrimonij impedire ipsam que ad sui ^^um apprehendere posset s^bdola
censpiracione fieri coniect^uit et cum propositum sui desiderij productis
falsis t^stibus in ^udicio ^mperator habere de ^uisset pater tunc ibide^
presens exi^^e to gladio filie sue pectus mortali vulnere per medium transfobit
dicens ^a (...) michi de filia mea virginem habere mortuam quam in scandalum
meretri cem reseruare uiuentem

aT Rome when apyus
Whose other name was claudius
Was gouerrnour of the cite
There fyl a wonder to se
Touching a gentyl maid as thus
Whom lyuyus vyrgyneus
Begeten had upon his wife
Men sayden that so fair a life
As she was not in all the town
This fame goes up and down
And to claudius came in his ere
Whereof his thought anon was there
Which al his heart has set a fire
That he began the flo^^e desire
Which longs unto mayden^^de
And sent if that he might speed
The blind lusts of his will
But that thing he might not fulfill
For he stood upon marriage
A knight of full great ^^gnage
Ilyaus which than hight
Accords in her faders sight
Was that he should his douter wedde
But or the cause were fully spedde
Her fader which in romanye
The leder of the chyualrye
In governance has undertake
Upon a werre which was take
Goes out with all ye strength he had
Of men of arms which he had
So was the marriage left
And stood upon accord till efte
The king which herd tell of this
How that this maid ordained is
To marriage thought another
And had thylke time a brother
Which marcus claudius was hot
And was a man of great ryote
Right as the king him self was
They two to gyder upon this caas
In cou^ceyl founden out this weye
That marcus claudius shall say
How she by weye of couenaunte
To his service apurtenaunte
Was hool and to none other man
And there upon he says he can
In every point witness take
Sy that s^e s^al it not forsake
When that they had shape so
After the law which was tho
While that her fader was absent
She was somned and assent
To come in presence of the king
And stood in answer of this thing
Her friends wysten al well
That it was falsehede every dele
And comen to the king and sayden
upon the comune law and prayden
So as this noble worthy knight
Her fader for the comune right
In thylk time as was be fall
Lay for the profit of them all
Upon the wild feldes armed
That he should not be harmed
Ne shamed while that he were out
And thus they preyden al about
For all the clamor that he herd
The king upon his lust answerde
And yaue hem only days two
Of respyte for he went tho
That in so s^orte a time appear
Her fader might in no manere^
But as thereof he was deceived
For lyuyus had al conceived
The purpoos of the king tofore
And thought to be there therefore
In all haste he came rydyng
And left upon the field lyggyng
His ooste till that he came ageyn
And thus this worthy capteyn
Appeared ready at his day
Where all that ever reason may
By law in audyence he does
So that his daughter upon soth
Of that marcus her had accused
He has tofore the court excused
The king which saw his purpose fail
And that ^o sleyght myt avail
In combred of his lusts blind
To law turned out of kind
And half in wrath as though it were
In presence of hem al there
Deceived of concupiscence
Yaue for his brother the sentence
And bad him that he should cese
His daughter and make him well at ese
But al within his own intent
He wist how that the cause went
Of that his brother has the wit
He was him self for to wit
But thus this maiden had wrong
Which was upon the king alonge
But ageyn him was none appele
And that his fader wist well
Whereof upon the tyranny
That for the lust of lecherye
His daughter should be dysceyued
And that illicius was weyued
Vntaily fro the marriage
Right as a lion fro the rage
Which of no dread set no count
And note what pity should amounte
A naked s^e^de he ^ulled out
The which among all the route
He th^^ste thorugh his daughter side
And al alowde thus he cried
Lo take her there ye wrongful king
For me is lever upon this thing
To be ^^e fader of a maid
Though she be d^de than men said
That in her life she were shamed
And I thereof were evil named
Tho bade the king men should a^^ste
His body but of thylke heste
Like to the chaced wild h^re
The hounds when he feleth sore
To proves and goes forth his weye
In such a wise for to say
This worthy knyt with swerd in ho^de
His weye made and they him wonde
That none of hem his strokes kept
And thus upon his horse bylepte
And with his swerd droppyng of blood
Which within his daughter stood
He came there as the power was
Of rome and told hem all the caas
And said hem that they might here
Upon the wrong of this matere
That better it were to redress
At home the great vnright^isnesse
Than for to war in strange place
And left at home her own grace
For thus stant^ every mannys life
In i^partye for his wife
Or for his daughter if they be
Passing another in beute
Of this marvel which they sy^
So apurtenaunte before her eye
Of that the king has him mysbor^
Her oaths they have al sw^t^
That they will stand by the right
And thus of one acorde up right
To rome at ones home ag^^n
They torn and shortly for to sayn
This tyranny came to mowthe
And every man says what he couthe
So that the pryuy trecherye
Set was upon lecherye
Came openly to man's ere
And that brought in the common fire
That every man peril dradde
Of him that so hem euerladde
For thy or it were worse fall
Thorugh common counceyl of him all
They have her wrong king deposed
And hem in whom it was supposed
The counceyl stood of his ledynge
By law unto the d^me they bring
Where they re^^yuen the penance
That longs to such governance
And thus the unchaste was chastised
Whereof they might ben aduysed
That should afterward govern
And by this euydence learn
How it is good a king eschew
The lust of vice and virtue sewe
Hic inter al^a castitatis regimen con ^^rnencia loquitur quomodo matromonium
cuius status sacramentum ^uasi^ continenciam equirerans eciam honest
delectacionis regimine moderari decet / Et narrat in exemplum ^ualiter p^o eo
quod illi septem viri qui sat^e raguelis fille magis propter concupis te^ciam
quam propter matrimonium voluptuose nups^^unt vnus post a^^um omnes prima nocte
a demone asmodeo singillatim ingulati interierunt

tO make in this party
Which touches to the polecye
Of chasty^e in specialle
As f^^ conclusion fynalle
That every lust is to eschew
By great ensaumple I may argewe
How in ^ages a town of mede
There was a maid and as I read
Sarra she hight and raguelle
Her fader was and so byfelle
Of body both and of vysage
Was none so fair of the lygnage
To seche emonge hem al as she
Whereof the rich of the cite
Of lusty folk that couden love
Assot^d were upon her love
And axen her for to wedde
One was which last spedde
And that was more for lykyng
To have his lust than for weddyng
As he within his heart cast
Which him repents at last
For it fyl the first night
When he was to the bed dyght
As he which no thing god ^esecheth
But al only his lusts secheth
A bed for he was fully warm
He took her in his arm
Asmode a fend of hell
And serves as the books tell
To t^mpte a man in such a wise
Which ready there and thylke empryse
Which he has set in such delight
He vengeth than in such a plyte
That he his nec^e has wrong a two
This young wife was woo tho
Which wist no thing what it men^^
And nethelesse yet thus it went
Not only of this first man
But after this th^re began
Syx other of her husbondes
Asmode has take in to his hondes
So that they al a bed deyden
When yt they hand toward her leyde^
Naught for the law of marriage
But for that ylke fyryrage
^n which they will the law excede
For who that will take heed
What after fyl in this matere
There might he well the sothe here
When she was wedded to thobye
And raphael in company
He taught him how to be honest
Asmode wan naught at thylke fe^te
And yet th^by his will h^^
For he his lust so goddely ladde ^
That both law and kind is served
Whereof he has him self preserved
That he fyl not in the sentence
O which another euydence
Of this ensaumple a man may see
That when lykyng degree
Of marriage may forsuey
Well ought than in other weye
Of lust to be the better aduysed
For god the law has as^ysed
As well to reason as to kind
But he the bestes would bind
Only to laws of nature
But to the man's creature
God gave him reason forth with all
Whereof that he nature shall
Upon the causes modefye
That he shall do no lecherye
And yet he shall his lusts have
So ben the laws both save
And every thing put out of sclau^dre
As whilom to king al^sanndre
The wise phylosophre taught
When he his first bore caughte
Not only upon chastyte
But only upon al honest
Whereof a king him self may taste
How true how large just and chast^
Him ought of reason for to be
Forthwyth the virtue of pity
Thorugh which thonke deserve
Toward his god that he preserve
Him and his people al in welthe
Of his richesse henour and health
Here in this world and ellis where eke
My sone as we tofore speak
In shrifte so as thou me saydest
And for thyn ese as thou me preydest
Thy louethro^bes for to ass
That I the would tell and wysse
The form of aristotiles lore
I have it said and somdele more
Of other ensaumples for to assaye
If ^ thy pains might a lay
Thorugh any thing that I can say
Do weye my fader I you pray
Of that ye have to me told
I thank you a thousand fold
The tales founden in mine ere
But yet my heart is elly^ where
I may my self not restreyne
That I nam ever in loves pain
Such lore could I never get
Which might make me foryete
O ^o^nte but if so were I slepte
That I my tides ay ne kept
To think on love and on his lalbe
That ^erte can I not withdraw
For thy my good fader dear
^^ue and speak of my matere
^^uc^yng of love as we begone
If that there be ought over run
^^ ought foryete or left behind
Which falls unto loves kind
Whereof it needs to be shryue
Now axeth so that while I live
I might amend that is amys
My good dear sone yis
Thy shryfte for to make pleyne
There ie yet no more for to said
Of love which is unadvised
But for thou shall be well aduysed
Unto thy shryfte as it bylongeth
A point which upon love hongeth
And is the last of al tho
I will the slew and than ho

tHe myty god which vnbegon
Stante of him self and has begone
Al other things at his will
The heaven he list to fulfille
Of all the joy where as he
Sit entronysed in his see
And has his angels him to serve
Such as him lyketh to preserve
So that he note forueye
But lucyfer he put albeye
With all the route apostasyed
Which ben to him alyed
Which out of heaven in to hell
From angels in to fendes fell
Where that there nys no joy of light
But derke as any night
The pains shall be endelesse
And yet of pains nethelesse
There is plente but they ben blake
Whereof no sight may be take
Thus when the things ben by fall
That lucyfers court was fall
Where dedely pride hem has conceived
A none forthwyth it was purueyed
Thorugh him which al things may
He made adam the sixth day
In paradyse and to his make
Him lyketh one also to make
And bade hem crece and multeplye
For of the man's progenye
Which of the woman shall be ^ore
The no^bre of angels which was lore
When they out fro the bliss fell
He thought to restore and fell
In haven thylke holy place
Which stood tho wide upon his grace
But as it is well wist and know
Adam and eve but a throw
So as it should of hem betyde
In paradyse at thylke tide
Ne dwelten and the cause why
Is write in the book of genesye
As who so al men have herd
How raphael the fyry sword
In hand took and drove hem out
To get her lives food about
Upon this wooful earth here
Metodre says to this matere
As he by truelacion
It had upon a vysyon
How that adam and ^ue also
Vyrgynes comen both two
In to the world and were ashamed
Till that nature hem has reclamed
To love and taught hem thylke lore
That first they kyst and ouermore
They done that is to kind dew
Whereof they had fair issue
A sone was the first of all
Caym by name they him call
A bell was after the second
And in the geste as it is fond
Nature so the cause ladde
Two daughters Eve had
The first cleped calmona
Was / and that other delbora
Thus was mankind to begin
For thy that time it was no sin
The suster for to take her brother
When that there was of choice none
other / To caym was calmana bytake
And delbora has abel take
Of whom was get nethelees
The worlds first encrees
Men sayn that need has no law
And so it was by thylke dawe
And last unto the second age
Till that the great water rage
Of noe which was said the flode
The world which than in sin stood
Has dreynte out take lives eight
Tho was mankind of litel weight
Sem Came Iaph^t of these three
That been the sons of noe
The world of man's nation
In to multiplicacion
Was tho restored new ageyn
So ferforth as the books seyn
That of hem ^^re and of her issue
There was so large a retynue
Of nacyons seventy and two
In sundry places each one of tho
The wide world have e^h^byted
But as nature has than excyted
They took than litel head
The brother to the suster yede
To wedde wives till it came
In to the time of abraham
When the third age was bygonne
That need it was over run
For there was people enough in land
Then alte first it came to hand
That systerhode of marriage
Was turned in to cosynage
So after that the right line
The ^^syn wedded the cosyne
For abraham or that he deyed
The charge upon his servant leyed
To him in this wise spoke
That he his sone ysaak
Do wedde for no worlds good
But only to his own blood
Whereof the servant as he ^adde
When he was deed his sone has ladde
To ba^huel where he rebecke
Has wedded with the whyt neck
For she wist well and syghe
Was to the child ^^syn nyghe
And thus as abraham taught
When ysaak was god bytaught
His sone Jacob did also
And of bulam the daughters two
Which was his eme he took to wife
And gate upon hem in his life
Of her first which hight lie
Sy^ senes of his progenye
And of rachel two sons eke
The remenaunt was for to seek
That is to sayn of four moo
Whereof he gate on bala two
And of zelpha he had eke twey
And these twelve as I the sey
Thorough the prouydence of god him
self / Ben said the patriarchs twelf
Of whom as afterward byfelle
The tribus twelf of Israel
Engendered were and ben the same
That of hebrews tho hadden name
Which of sy^red in alyaunce
For ever kept thylke vsaunce
Most contynuelly till christ was bore
But afterward it was folore
Emonge us that been buptyzed
For of the law canonyzed
The pope has bode to the men
That none shall wedden of his kyn
Ne the second ne of the third
But if holy church it bydde
So to restreyne marriage
There ben yet upon loves rage
Full many of such now a day
That taken where they take may
For love of which is ^nbeseyn
Of al reason as men sayn
Thorugh sotye and thorugh nycete
Of his voluptuosite
He spares no condycyon
Of kynne ne of religyon
But as a cock emonge the hens
Or ^s a stalon in the fennes
Which goes emonge al. the stood
Right so can he no more good
But takes what comes next to ho^de
My sone thou shall vnderstende
That such delight is for to blame
For thy if thou have ben the same
To love in any such manner
Tell forth thereof and shryue the here
My fader nay god wot the sothe
My feyre is not of such a both
So wild a man yet was I never
That of my kynne or leave or lever
Me lust love in such a wise
I note eke for what empryse
I should assote upon a nonne
For though I had her love won
It might in to no price amounte
So thereof set I none acouute
Ye may well axe of this and that
But sothely for to tell plat
Iu all this world there is but one
The which my heart has ouergone
I am toward al other fre
Fnl well my sone now I see
Thy word stonte ever upon a place
But yet thereof thou have a grace
That though the might so well excuse
Of love such as sum men use
So as I spoke of now tofore
For all such time of love is lore
And like unto the bitter sweet
For though it think a man first sweet
He shall well felen at last
Thai it is sour and may not ^aste
For as a morc^l enuenymed
So has such love his lust mystymed
And great ensaumples many one
A man may find thereupon
Hic loquitur contra istos quos (...) nus sui desiderij feruore inflammar ita
incestuosos efficit vt nequam preprijsororibus parcunt Et narrat exemplu^
qualiter pro eo quoth Gayus Caligula tres sorores suas virgins coitu illicito
oppressit deus tanti sceleris peccatum impium non ferens ipsum non solum ab
imperio set a vita iusticia vindice preliauit / Narrat eciam aliud exemplum
super eodent qualiter amon filius david fatui amoris concupiscenciam preuentus
sororem suam thamar a sue virginitatis pudicicia inuitam deflora uit propter quoth
et ipse a fratre suo ab solon postea interfectus peccatum sue mortis precio
inuitus dedemit

Trome first if we begin
There shall I find how of this syn
An emperor was for to blame
Gayus Caligula by name
Which of his own susters three
Byrefte the vyrgynyte
And when he had hem so forleyn
As he which was al vylayn
He did hem out of land exyle
But afterward within a while
God has byrefte him in his ire
His life and eke his large emp^ro
And thus for lykyng of a throw
For ever his love was overthrow
Of this soty also I find
Amon his suster ageyn kind
Which hight thamare he forley^
But he that lust another day
A bought when that absolon
His own brother there upon
Of that he had his suster shente
Took of that sin vengemente
And slew him with his own hond
And thus the unkind unkind fond
Hic narrat qualiter loath duas filias suas ipsis concencientibus carna^ copu la
cognouit duos que ex eis filios sci licet moab and Amon progenuit quorum postea
generacio pratia and exasperans contra populum dei in terra saltim promissionis
vario grauamine qua^ sepius insultabat

aNd for to see more of this thing
The bible makes knowlechyng
Whereof thou might take euydence
Upon the soth experience
When bothes wife was ouergone
And shape unto the salt stone
As it is spoke unto this day
By both his daughters than he lay
With child he made hem both great
Till that nature would hem let
And so the cause about ladde
That each of hem a sone had
Moab the first and the second
Amon of which as it is fond
Came afterward to great encrece
Two nations and nethelece
For that the stocks were not good
The traunches might not be good
For of the false moabytes
Forthwith the strength of amonytes
Of that they were first mysgete
The people of god was often vpsete
In Israel and in Iudee
As in the bible a man may see
Lo thus my sone as I the say
Thou might thy self be besay
Of that thou haste of other herd
For ever yet it has so ferde
Of loves lust if so byfalle
That it in other places fall
Than it is of the law set
He which his love has so bysette
Mote afterward repent it sore
And every man is other lore
Of that befyl in time or this
The present time which now is
May be informed how it stood
And take that him think good
And leave that which is not so
But for to look of time a goo
How lust of love excedeth law
It ought for to be withdraw
For every man it should dread
And namelyche in his sybrede
Which torneth often to vengeauuce
Whereof a tale in remembrance
Which is a long process to here
I think for to tellen here
Omnibus est communis amor sed et immoderatus / Qui facit excessus non
reputatur amans / Sors tamen vnde venus attractat corda videre / Que rationis
erunt non ratione sinit

Hic loquitur adhuc contra incestuosos amantum coitus / Et narrat mirabile
exemplum de ^^^gno rege antiocho qui vxore mortua propriam filiam violauit et
quia filie matrimonium penes alios Impedire voluit tale ab eo exiit edictum
quod si quis eam in vxorem peterit nisi quoddam proble nia questionis quam ipse
rex proposu erat veraciter solueret capitali sentencia puniretur super quo
veniens ta^dem discretus iuuenis princeps tiri appolinus questionem soluit /
Nec tamen filiam habere potuit sed rex indignatus ipsum propter hec in mortis
odium recollegit / Vnde appolinus a facie regis fugiens quamplura prout
inferius intitulatur propter amorem pericula passus est

oF a cronycle in days gone
The which is cleped pant^one
In loves cause I read thus
How that the great aniyochus
Of whom that antioche took
His first name as says the bock
Was coupled to a noble queen
And had a daughter them between
But which fortune came to hand
That death which no king may with stand
/ But every life it mote obey
This worthy queen took aweye
The king which made mochel moan
Tho stood as who says him allone
Without wife but nethelees
His daughter which was peerlees
Of bewete dwelte about him stylle
But when a man has wealth at will
The flesh is freel and falls often
And that this maid tender and soft
Which in her faders chamber dwelte
Within a time wist and felt
For lykyng of concupiscence
Withouten insyght of conscience
The fader so with lusts blente
That he cast al his entente
His own daughter for to spylle
The king has leyser at his will
With strength and when he time seye
The young maiden he forleye
And she was tender and full of dread
She could not her maydenhede
Defend / and thus she has forlore
The flower which she has long bore
It helps not though she weep
For they that should her body keep
Of wymmen were absent as than
And thus this maiden goes to man
The wild fader thus deuoureth
His own flessh which none secoureth
And that was cause of mochel care
But after this unkind fare
Out of the chamber goes the king
And she lay still and of that thing
Within her self such sorrow made
There was nout that might her glade
For fere of thylke horrible vice
With that came in the norice
Which fro chyldehode her had kept
And axed her if she had slepte
And why her chere was vnglad
But she which has be over lad
Of that she might not be wreke
For shame could vnnethys speak
And nethesse mercy she prayed
With weeping eye and thus she said
Alas my suster well away
That ever I saw this ylke day
Thing which my body firsst begat
In to this world onelych that
My worlds worship has byrefte
With that she swowneth now and efte
And ever wissheth after death
So that welny she lacks breath
That other which her words herd
In comfortyng of her answerde
To let her faders foul desire
She wist no recouryre
When thing is do there is no lote
So suffren they that suffren mote
There was none other which him wist
So has this king all that he list
Of his lykyng and of his plesaunce
And last in such a contynuunce
And such delight he took there in
Him thought it was no syn
And she durst him no thing withsey
But fame which goes every wey
To sundry royames about
The great bewte tells out
Of such a maid of hye parage
So that for love of marriage
The worthy princes come and send
As they which al honor wend
And knew no thing how that it stood
The fader when he understood
That they his daughter thus lysought
With all his wit he cast and sought
How that he might find a let
And such a statute then he set
And in this wise his law taxes
That what man his daughter axeth
But he could his questyon
Assoyle upon sugestyon
Of certain things that byfelle
The which he would unto hem tell
He should in certain lose his head
And thus there were many deed
Her hedes stondyng on the gate
Till at last long and late
For lack of answer in the wise
The remenaunte that weren wise
De aduentu appo^oni in autiochiam vbi ipse filiam regis antioche in vxorem
postulauit

Escheweden to make assay
Till it befyl upon a day
Appollynus the prince of tire
Which has to love a great desire
As be which in his high mode
Was lykyng of his h^te blood
A young a fresshe a lusty knight
As he lay musyng on a night
Of the tydynge which he herd
He thought to assay how that it ferde
He was with worthy company
A rayed and with good nauye
To ship ^e goes the wind him dryueth /
And saileth till that he ariueth
Saufe in the port of antyoche
He londeth and goes to approach
The kings court and his presence
Of every natural science
Which any clerk him could teache
He could enough and in his speech
Of words he was eloquent
And when he saw the king present
He prays he must his daughter have
The king ageyn began to crave
And told him the condycyon
How first unto his questyon
He mote answer and fail naught
Or with his heed it shall be bought
Question regis antiochi s^^lere vehor materna ca^ne v^soo^ quero patrem me um
matris me viru^ vxoris me filiu^

aNd he him axeth what it was
The king declares him the caas
With stern lock and st^rdy chere
To him and said in this manner
With felonye I am up bore
I ete and have it not forbore
My modrs flessh whose husbond
My fader for to seche I fond
Which is the seen eke of my wife
Hereof I am inquysytyf
And who that can my tale save
Al quyte he shall my daughter have
Of his answer if he fail
He shall be deed without fail
For thy my sone quoth the king
Be well aduysed of thie thing
Which has by life in Ieopartye
Appol^ynus for his party
When he this ou^s^yon had herd
Unto the king he has answerde
And has reherced one and one
The points and said thereupon
The questyon which thou have spoke
If thou wylt that it be vnl^ke
It touches all the pryuyte
Betwyxte thyn own child and the
And stante al upon you two
The king was wonder sor^^tho
And theut if that he said it out
Then were he shamed al about
With sly words and with fell
He said my sone I shall the tell
Though thou be little of wit
It is no marvel as yet
Thyn age may it not suffyse
But look well thou not despise
Thyn own life for of my grace
Of thyrty days full of space
I grant the to ben aduysed
And thus with love and time assysed
This young prince forth he went
And understood well what it mente
Within his heart as he was lered
That for to make him afered
The king his time has so deloyed
Whereof he drad and was amayed
Of treson that he deye should
For he the king troth told
And suddenly the night tide
The morrow would he not abide
Al pryuelye his barge he hente
And home ageyn to tire he went
And in his own wit he said
For dread if he the king bewrayed
He knew so well the kings heart
That death ne should he asterte
The king would him so pursewe
But he that would his death eschew
And knew all this tofore the hand
Forsake he thought his own land
For there would he not abide
For well he knew on sum side
This tyrant of his felonye
By sum manner of trecherye
To grieve his body will not leave
For thy with outen taking leave
As pryuelyche ash might
He geeth to the sea by night
In ships that been with whete laden
Her takyl ready tho they maden
And haleth the sait^ and forth they fare
But for to tell of the care
That they of tire began tho
When that they wist he was agoo
It is a pity for to here
They lost lust they lost chere
They took upon hem such penance
There was no song there was no dau^ce
But every myrthe and melodye
To them was then a maladye
For unlust of that adventure
There was no man which took tonsure
In dredeful clothes they them clothe
The bathes and the stews both
They shyt in by every weye
There was no life which lust to pleye
Ne take of any joy keep
But for her liege lord to weep
And every wight says as he couthe
Alas the lusty flower of youth
Our prince our head our gouernoure
Thorugh whom we stonden in honor
Without the conoune assent
Thus suddenly is from us went
Such was the clamor of hem all
But see now what is befalle
Qualiter thaliartus miles vt appolinum veneno intoxicaret ab anti^ oche in
tirum missus ipse ibidem non Inuento antiochiam rediit

upon the fyst tale plain
And torn we thereto again
Antiochus the great sire
Which full of rancour and of ire
His heart bears so as he herd
Of that this prince of tire answerde
He had a fellow bacheler
Which was his pryuy counceyller
And thaliart by name he hight
The king a strong poison him dyt
Within a box and gold thereto
In all haste and bad him goo
Strayte unto tire and for to cost
Ne spare till he had lost
The prince which he would spylle
And wha^ ye king has said his will
This talyart in a galeye
With all haste he took his weye
The wind was good / they seyled
blyue / Till he took land upon ye ryue
Of tire and forth with all anon
In to the borough he began to gone
And took his ynne and bode a throw
But for he would not be know
Dysgysed then he goes him out
He saw the weeping al about
And axeth what the cause was
And they him told all the caas
How suddenly the prince was goo
And when he saw that it was so
And that his labor was in veyn
A none he torneth home ageyn
And to the king when he came nyghe
He told him that he herd and syghe
How that the prince of tire was fled
So was he comen ageyn vnsped
The king was sorry for a while
But when he saw that with no wile
He might acheue his cruelte
He stynte his wrath and let him be
Qualiter apoollinus in portu tharsis appl^cauit vbi in hospico^ cuiusda^ magni
vin nomine strangulionis hospitatus est

But over this now for to tell
Of adventures that byfelle
Unto this prince of whom I told
He has his right course forth hold
By stone and nedyl till he came
To tharse and there land he name
A bourgeys rich of gold and fee
Was thylke time in that cite
Which cleped was stranguyllyo
His wife was dyonysye also
This young prince as says the book
With him his herbegage took
And it befyl that cite so
Bef^^ time and then also
Thou^gh strong famyn which he lad
Was none that any whete had
Appollynus when that he herd
The myschyef how that the cite ferde
Al frelyche of his own gift
His whete emonge hem for to shyfte
The which by ship he had brought
He yaue and took of hem right naught
But sythen first this world began
Was never yet to such a man
More joy made than they him made
For they were al of him so glade
That they for ever in remembrance
Made a figure in resemblaunce
Of him and in common place
They set it up so that his face
Might every manner man behold
So that the cite was behold
It was of laton over gylte
Thus was his face nout spylte
Qualiter hellicanus ciuis tiri tharsim Veniens apollinum de insidijs anthiochi

Upon a day with a route
This lord to pleye goes him out
And on his weye of tire he met
A man which on knees him grette
And hellican by name he hight
Which prayed his lord to have insyt
Upon him self and said him thus
How that the great antyochus
Aweyteth if that he might him spyl
That other thought and held him still
And thanked him of his warnyng
And bad him tell for no thing
When he to tire came home ageyn
That he in tharse him had seyn
Qualiter appolinus portu^ tharsis relin quens cum ipse per mare nauigio

fOrtune has ever be muable
And may no while stand stable
For now it hyeth and now it loweth
Now sta^te up right now overthrows
Now full of bliss now full of bale
For now as in tellyng of my tale
Here afterward a man may here
Which is great routhe for to here
This lord which would done his best
Within him self has little rest
And thout he would his place change
And seek a contre more strange
Of tharsyens his leave anon
He took and is to ship gone
His course he name with sail up draw /
Where as fortune does ye law
And shows as I shall reherce
How she was to the lord dyuerce
The which upon the sea she ferketh
The wind aroos the weder derketh
It blewe and made such tempeste
That none anchor myt the ship arest
Which has broken al his gere
The shypmen stood in such a fere
Was none that might bestere
But ever awayte upon the lere
When yt they should drenchen al atones
There was enough within the wones
Of weeping and of sorrow tho
The young king makes much woo
For to see the ship travail
But all that might no thing avail
The mast to brake the seyle to roof
The ship upon the wawes droof
Till that they see the lands cost
Tho made a vow lest and most
By that they myghten come a land
But he which has the sea on hand
Neptunus would not accord
But he al to brake cable and cord
Or they to land might approach
The ship to claue upon a roche
And al goes down in to the deep
But he which al thing may keep
Unto this lord was mercyable
And brought him save upon a table
Which to the land has him bore
The remenaunte was al forlore
Thereof he made mochel moan
Thus was this young lord allone
Qualiter appollinus nudus superlitus iactabatur vbi quidam piscator ipsum
collobio suo vestiens ad vrtem pentapolim direxit

aL naked in a pour plyte
His color which was whylom whyt
Was than of water fade and pale
And eke be was so sore a cale
That he him self wist of no bote
It help no thing for to mote
To get ageyn that he has lore
Which she that has his death forbore
Fortune though he would not yelpe
Al suddenly has sent him help
When him thought al grace aweye
There came a fyssher in the weye
And saw there a naked man stand
And when that he has understand
The cause of him he has great routhe
And only of his power truth
Of such clothes as he had
With great pity this lord he cladde
And he him thonketh as he should
And says him that it should be yolde
If ever he get his state ageyn
And prays that he would seyn
If nyghe were any town for him
He said ye / pentopolym
Where both king and queen dwellen
This tale herd he tellen
He gladeth him and began beseech
That he the weye him would teache
And he him taught and forth he went
And to god with good entente
To send him joy after his sorrow
It is not passed yet mydmorowe
Qualiter appollinus pentapolim adue niente ludus a giguasij per vrbem public

tHan thyderward his weye he nam
Where sone upon the none he came
He ete such as he might get
And anon forth as he had ete
He goes to see the town about
And came there as he fond a ronte
Of young lnsty men with all
And as it should tho byfalle
That day was set of such assyse
That they should in the lands gyse
As he herd of the people seye
Her comune game then pleye
And cried was that they should come
Both to the game al and sum
Of hem that been delyner and wight
To do such mastrye as they might
They made hem naked as they should
For so that ylke game would
And it was the custom and the use
Among hem was none refuse
The flower of all the town was there
And of the court also there were
And that was in a large place
Right even before the kings face
Which artestraches then hight
The pleye was pleyed right in his sit
And who most worthy was of deed
Reayue he should his mede
And in the cite bear a price
Appolynus which was ware and wise
Of every game he could an end
He thought to assay who so it wend
Qualiter appollinus ludum gignasij v^n^ens in aula regis ad cenam ho^on^ice

aNd fyl emonge hem unto game
And wan him there such a name
So as the king him self accounts
That he al other men surmounteth
And ba^e the price above hem all
The king bad that in to his halle
At souper time he shall be brought
And he came than and left it naught
Without company allone
Was none so semelyche a person
Of vysage and of lymmes both
If that he had what to clothe
At souper time nethelese
The king amyddes all the prese
Let clepe hem up emonge hem all
And bad his marchal of his halle
To setten him in such degree
That he upon him might see
The king was sone set and served
And he which has his prise deserved
After the kings own word
Was made begin a myddel board
That both king and queen him sye
He set and cast about his eye
And saw the lords in estate
He with him self wexe in debate
Thynkyng what he had lore
And such a sorrow he took therefore
That he satte ever stylle and thought
As he which of no mete rought
Qualiter appollinus in cena recum ^ens nichil comedit set dolo roso vultu
capite maxim ingemescebat qui tandem a filia regis confortatus citheram
plectens cunctis audientibus citherando vltra modum complacuit

tHe king beheld his heuynrsse
And of his great gentylnesse
His daughter which was fair and
^ood / And at board before him stood
As it was thylke time usage
He bad to goo on his message
And fond to make him glade
And she did as her fader bade
And goes to him the soft paas
And axeth when and what he was
And prays he should his thoutes leave
He says madame by your leave
My name is hot appolynus
And of my riches it is thus
Upon the sea I have it lore
The contre where as I was bore
Where that my land is and my rent
I left at tire when that I went
The worship there of which I ought
Unto the god I there betought
And thus to gyder as they speak
The teeris ran down by his cheke
The king which took thereof good keep
Had great pity to see him weep
And forth his daughter send ageyn
And prayed her fair and began to sayn
That she would no longer dretrhe
But that she would anon forth fetch
Her harp and done all that she can
To glade with that sorry man
And she to done her faders heste
Her harp fette and in the feste
Upon a chayer which they fette
Her self next to this man she set
With harp both and eke with mowthe
To him she did all that she couthe
To make him chere and ever be sygheth
And she him axeth how him lyketh
Madame certeys well he said
But if ye the mesure played
Which if you list I shall you lere
It were a glad thing for to here
A leave sir says she
Take the harp and let me see
Of what mesure that ye mean
Tho prays the king and the queen
Forthwith the lords al arewe
That he sum myrthe would show
And takes the harp and in his wise
He tempreth and of such assyse
Syngyng he harpeth forth with all
That as a voy^e cel^styalle
Hem thought it sowned in her here
As though it an aungel were
They gladen of his melodye
But most of all the company
The kings douter which it herd
And thout eke and that he answered
When that it was of her apposed
Within her heart has well supposed
That he his great gentylnesse
His deeds ben thereof witness
Forthwyth the wysdom of his lore
It needs not to s^che more
He might not have such manner
Of gentyl blood but if he were
When he has harpyd al his fylle
The kings heste to fulfylle
Awey goes dysshe aweye goes cup
Down goes ye board the cloth was up
They risen and goon out of halle
The king his chamberleyn let call
And bad that he by all weye
A chamber for this man purueye
Which nygh his own chamber be
It shall be do my lord quoth he
Qualiter appollinus cum rege pro filia sua erudienda retentus est

aPpollynus of whom I mean
Tho took his leave of king and queen
And of the worthy maid also
Which prayed unto her fader tho
That she might with the young man
Of tho sciences which he can
His lore have in this wise
The king her grants her apprise
So that him self thereto assent
Thus was accorded or they went
That he with all that ever he may
This young fair fresshe may
Of that he could should inform
And full assented in this form
Qualiter filia regis appolinum ornato apparatu vestiri fecit / Et ipse ad
puelle doctrinam in quam plurius famulialiter intendebat / Vnde placata puella
in amorem appolini exazdescens infirmab^tur

tHey took let as for that night
And when it was on morrow right
Unto this young man of tire
Of clothes and of good attire
With gold and silver for to spend
This worthy young lady send
And thus she made him well at ease
And he with all that he can plese
Her serves well and fair ageyn
He taught her till she thas certain
Of harp of cytole and of rote
With many a tewne and many a note
Upon musyque upon mesure
And of her harp the temprure
He taught her well as he roel couthe
But as men sayn that frele is youth
With le^^er and contynuaunce
This maid fyl upon a chance
That love has mad him a quarele
Against yongthe fressh and frele
That mangre wheder she will or nout
She mote with all her hertes thought
To love and to his love obey
And that she shall full sore obey
For the wot not what it is
But ever emonge she feleth this
Towchyug this man of tire
Her heart is hot as any fire
And other while it is a cale
Now is she reed now is she pale
Right after the condycyon
Of her ymagynacyon
But ever emonge her thoughts all
Her thought what may befalle
Or that she laughe or that she weep
She would her good name keep
For fere of womannysshe shame
But what in ernest and in game
She stante for love in such a plyte
That she has lost al appetyte
Of mete of drink of nyghtes rest
As she that note what is the best
But for to think al her fylle
She hold her often times stylle
Within her chamber and goes not out
The king was of her life in doubt
Which wist no thing what it mente
But fyl a time as he out went
tO walk of princes sons three
There came and fyl to his knee
Qualiter tres filij principum filiam regis singillatim in vxorem suis
supplicacionibus postularent

And each of hem in sundry w^se
Bysought and proferith his seruyse
So that he might his daughter have
The king which would her honor save
Says she is seek and of that speech
Tho was no time to beseech
But each of hem do make a bylle
He bad and wrytc his own will
His name his fader and his good
And when she wist how that it stood
And had her lylles over seyn
They should have answer ageyn
Of this counceyl they were glad
And wrote as the king hem bad
And every man his own bock
In to the kings hand bytook
And he it to his daughter send
And prayed her for to make an end
And wrote ageyn her own hand
Right as she in her heart fond
Qualiter fitia regis omnibus alijs retictis appollinum in maritu(...) preclegit

tHe bylles were well received
But she has al her loves weyued
And thout yt tha^ was time and space
To put her in her faders grace
And wrote ageyn and thus she said
The shame which is in a maid
With speech dare no^ be vnloke
But in wryfyng it may be spoke
So write I fader to you thus
But if I have apollynus
Of all this world what so beside
I will none other man abide
And certes if I of him fail
I wot right well without fail
Ye shall for me be faderles
This lettre came and there was prese
Tofore the king there as he stood
And when that he it understood
He yaue hem auswer by and by
But that was do pryuelye
That ^^^e ^f other counceyl wyste
They took her leave and where hem list
And went forth upon their weys
The king would not bewreye
The counceyl for no manner hye
But suffers till he time sye
Qualiter rex and regina in maritagium filie sue cum appolino consencierunt

And when that he to chamber is come
His counceyl thereto him nome
This man of tire and let him see
The lettre and all the pryuyte
The which his daughter to him sent
And he his knee to ground bente
And thonked him and her also
And or they went then a two
With good heart and good courage
Of full love and full marriage
The king and he be hole accorded
And after when it was recorded
Unto the daughter how it stood
The yefte of all the worlds good
Ne should have made her half so blythe
And forth with all the king asswithe
For he will have her good assent
Has for the queen her mother sent
The queen is comen and when she herd
Of this matere how that is ferde
She saw debate she saw dysese
But if she would her daughter plese
And is thereto assented full
Which is a deed wonderful
For no man knew the soth ^^as
But he him self what man he was
And nethelesse so as him thought
His deeds to the sothe wrought
That he was come of gentyl blood
Him lacks but worlds good
And as thereof is no dyspeyre
For she shall be her faderes heir
And he was able to govern
Thus will they not the love werne
Of him and her in no wise
But al accorded they deuyse
Qualiter appollinus filie regies nup ^ sit et primo nocte cum ea concubiens
ipsam inpregnauit

tHe day of time of marriage
Where love is lord of courage
Him thinks long or that he speed
But at last unto the deed
The time is come and in her wise
With great offryng and sacrefyse
They wedde and make a great feste
And every thing was right he neste
Within hows and eke without
It was so done that al about
Of great / worship and great noblesse
There cried many a man a largess
Unto the lords high and loud
The knights that be young and proud
They Just first and after dance
The day is goo the nyghtes chance
Has derked all the bright son
The lord which has his love won
Is goo to bed with his wife
Where as they led a lusty life
And that was after somdele seen
For as they pleyden hem between
They get a child between hem two
To whom fyl after mochel woo
Qualiter amtassiatores a tiro in quodam naui pentapolim venie^tes mortem regis
antiochi Appollino nu^ciaueru^t

Now have I told of the spousayles
But for to speak of the meruayles
Which afterward to hem byfelle
It i^ a wonder for to tell
It fyl a day they rode out
King and queen and all the route
To pleye hem upon the second
Where as they seen toward the land
A ship saylyng of great array
To know what it mean may
Till it be come they abide
Than saw they stand on every side
Endlong the ships board to show
Of the penonnes a rich rewe
They ax^d when the ship is come
Fro tire anon answered sum
And over this they sayden more
The cause is they comen fore
Was for to seche and for to find
Appollynus which of kind
Her lyege lord and he appears
And of the tale which he hereth
He was rit glad for they him told
That for vengeance as god it would
Antyochus as men may wit
With fire and lyghtenyng is al to smite
His daughter has the same chance
So ben they both in one balaunce
For thy our lyege lord we the seye
In name of all the land and preye
That left al other thing to done
It like you to come sone
And see your own lyege men
With other that been of your ken
That lyuen in longyng and desire
Till ye be come ageyn to tire
This tole after the king it had
Pentapolyn al over it sprad
There was no joy for to seche
For every man it had in speech
And sayden al of one acoorde
A worthy king shall ben our lord
That thout us first an heaviness
Is shape us now to great gladness
Qualiter appollino cum vxore sua imprignata a pentapoli versus tyrum
nauigantius contigit vxorem mortis artia^^ angustiatam in naui filiam que
postea thaysies vocabatur patere

tThus goes the tydyng over al
But need he must that need shall
Appollynus his leave took
To god he all that bond bytook
With all the people long and broad
That he no longer there abode
The king and queen sorrow made
But yet somdele they were glade
Of such thing as they herd tho
And thus between the well and woo
To ship he goes his wife with child
The which was ever meke and mylde
And would not depart him fro
Such love was between hem two
Lycho rida for her office
Was take which was a norice
To wend with this young wife
To whom was shape a wooful life
Within a time as it betyd
When they were in the sea amyd
Out of the north they see a cloud
The storm awos the wyndes loud
They blewen many a dredesul blaste
The welken was al over cast
The derke night the son has under
There was a great tempest of thondre
The moon and eke the sterres both
In black clouds they hem clothe
Whereof their bright look they hyde
This young lady wept and cryde
To whom no comfort might avail
Of child she began to travail
Where she lay in a caban choos
This wooful lord fro her awos
And that was long or any morrow
So that in anguysshe and in sorrow
She was delyuerd al by night
And deed in every man's sight
But nethelesse for all this woo
A maid child was boren tho
Qualiter appollinus mortem vxoris sue planxit

Appollynus when he this kuewe
A swowne he him self ouerthrewe
That no man wist in him no life
And when he woke he said a wife
My joy my lust my desire
My wealth and my recoueryre
Why shall I live and thou shall dye
Ha thou fortune I the defye
Now have thou do to me thy werste
A heart why ne will thou breast
That forth with her I might pass
My pains were much the less
In such weeping and such cry
His deed wife which lay him bye
A thousand sythes he her kyste
Was never man that saw ne wyste
A sorrow to his sorrow lyche
Was ever emonge upon the lyche
He fyl swownyng as he that thout
His own death which he besought
Unto the gods al above
With many a pytous word of love
But such words as tho were
Herd never no man's eere
But only thylke which he said
The master shypman came and prayed
With other such as ben therein
And sayn that he may no thing wyn
Ageyn the death but they him read
He be well ware and take heed
The sea by weye of his nature
Receive may no creature
Within him self as for to hold
The which is deed for thy they would
As they counceyllen al about
The deed body casten out
For better it is they sayden all
That it of her so byfalle
Than if they sholden al spylle
The king which understood her will
And knew her counceyl was true
Began ageyn his sorrow new
With pytous heart and thus to seye
It is al reason that ye preye
Qualiter suadentibu^ nautis corpus vxoris sue mortue in quadam cista plumbo et

IAm ad he but one allone
So would I not for my person
There fell such aduersite
But when it may no better be
Does than thus upon my word
^ete make a coofere strong of board
That it be fyrme with led and pytche
Anon was made his coofre such
Al ready brought unto his hand
And when he saw and ready fond
This cooffre made and well englued
The deed body was besewed
In cloth of gold and leyed therein
And for he would unto her wyn
Upon sum cost a sepulture
Under her heed in adventure
Of gold he leyed sommes great
And of Iuels strong byyete
Copia littere capiti vxoris sue supposite

Forthwith a lettre and said thus
King of tire Appollynus
Does al men to wit
That heereth and sees this lettre write
That helpeles without read
Here l^eth a kings daughter deed
And who that happeth her to find
For charity take in his mind
And do so that she begraue
With that tresour that she have
Thus when the lettre was full spoke
A none they have the coofre / s^oke
And bounden it with iron fast
So that it may with wawes last
And stoppen it by such a wey^
That it shall be within dreye
So that no water might it grieve
And thus in hope and good believe
Of that the corpse s^^l n^l ary^e
They cast it over board as blyue
Qualiter appo^^^us vxoris sue cor^e in ^^are proiecto Tirum re^^nguens cursu^

The ships forth on the wawes went
The prince has changed his intent
And says he will not come at tire
As then but al his desire
Is first to saylen unto tharse
The wyndy storm began to scarce
The son aryseth the weder clereth
The sh^^man which behind stereth
When that he saw the wyndes soft
Toward tharse his course he sought

b^t now to my matere ag^yn
To tell as old books seyn
This deed corpse of which ye know
With wind and water was forthrowe
Now here now there till at last
At ephesym the sea up cast
The cooffre and all that was therein
Of great marvel now begin
May h^re who that s^te stylle
That god will save may not spylle
Right as ye corpse was throw on lord
There came walkyng by the stronde
A worthy clerk and surgyen
And eke a gr^te physycien
Of that land the wysest one
Which hight master Ci^^mone
There was of his dysaples sum
This maistre is to the ^^offre come
He poyseth there was somewhat in
And bade him bear it to his ynne
And goes him self forth with all
All that shall fall / fall shall
They comen home and tarry naught
This cooffre in to his chamber is brout
Which that they find fast st^ke
But they with craft it has vnl^ke
They looken in wh^re as they found
A body deed which was y bound
In cloth of gold as I said ore
The tresour eke they founden there
Forth with the lettre which they read
And tho they token better head
Unsown was the body sone
And he that knew what was to done
This noble clerk with all host
Began the veins for to taste
And saw her age was of youth
And with the crafts which he couthe
He sought and fond a sign of life
With that this worthy kings wife
Honestlye they token out
And maden fyres al about
They leyed her in a couche soft
And with a shete warmed often
Her cold breast began to hete
Her heart also to flacke and beat
This maiste^ has her every ioynte
With certain oil and balsam anoynte
And put a lycour in her mowthe
Which is to few clerks cowthe
So that she covers at last
And first her eyes up she cast
And when she more of strength caut
Her arms both forth she straught
Held up her hand and pytouslye
She spoke and said where am I
Where is my lord what ^onde is this
As she that wot not how it is
But cerymon the worthy leche
Answered anon upon her speech
And said madame y^ b^n here
Where ye be save as ye shall here
Here afterward for thy as now
My counceyl is comfort you
For trysteth well without fail
There is nothing which shall you fail
That ought of reason for to be do
Thus passen they a day or two
Qualiter vxor appolini sanata domu^ religionis peciit vbi sacro velamine
munitam cast^ omni tempore se vouit

They speak of naught as for an end
Till she began somdele amend
And wist her self what she mente
Tho for to know her hole entente
This master axeth all the caas
How she came there and what she was
How I came here wot I naught
Quoth she but well I am bethought
Of other things al about
Fro point to point and told him out^
As ferforthly as she it wyste
And he her told how in a chyste
The sea her threw upon the ^onde
And what tresour with her he fond
Which was al ready at her will
And he that shope him to fulfylle
With all his might what he shold^
She ^honked him that so he would
And al her heart she dyscloseth
And says him what she supposes
Her lord be dreynt her child also
So saw she naught but al woo
Whereof as to the world no more
N^ will she torn and prays therefore
That in sum temple of the cite
To keep and hold her chastyte
She myt emonge the wymmen dwell
When he this tale herd tell
He was rit glad and made her known
That he a daughter of his owen
Has which he will unto her give
To serve while they both live
Instead of that which she has lost
Al only at his own cost
She shall be rendered forth with her
She says grant mercy leave sir
God quyte it you for I ne may
And thus they drive forth the day
Till time was that she was hole
And tho they took her counceyl hole
To shape upon good governance
And made a worthy purueaunce
Ageyn the day when they be veyled
And thus when they be counceylled
In black clothes they them clothe
The daughter and the lady both
And yield hem to religyon
The feste and the professyon
After the rule of that degre^
Was made with great solempnyte
Where as dyane is sanctified
Thus stant this lady ^ustyfyed
In order where she thinks to dwell
But now ageynward for to ^elle
In what p^^te that her lord stood ynne
He sayleth till he may win The haven of tharse as I said ere
And when he was aryued there
Qualiur appolinus tharsim nauiga^s filiam suam thaysim strangulioni and
dionisie vxori sue edu^^n^am common d^uit (...) dein de tirum adijt vbi cum in
es^imabi^ gaudio a suis receptus est

tHo it was thorugh the cite know
Men might see within a throw
As who says all the town attones
That come ageyn for the nones
To yeuen him the reverence
So glad they were of his ^ resonce
And though he were in his a rage
^ysesed yet with glad vysage
He made him there and to his ynne
Where he whylom soiorneth in
He goes him s^reyte and was ^^ceyued
And when ye pr^es of people is weyued
He took his host unto him tho
And says my s^^nde s^rangulyo
^o thus and thus it is byfalle
And thou thy self art one of all
Forthwith thy wife which I must trist
For thy if you it both list
My daughter thayse by your leave
I think shall with you bleue
As for a time and thus I pray
That she be kept by all weye
And when she has of age more
That she be set to book ^ere
And this au^we to god I make
That I shall ueuer for ^ir sake
My berde for lykyng sh^ue
^yl it befa^le that I have
In coueuable time of age
Beset her unto mar^age
Thus they accorden at his will
And for to resten him somdele
As for a while there be soiourneth
And than he takes his leave and torneth
To ship and goes him home to tire
Where every man with great desire
A wayteth upon his coming
But when the ship came in saylyng
And they perceyuen it is he
Was never yet in n^ cite
Such joy made as they tho made
His heart also began to glade
Of that he sees his people glad
Lo th^s fortune his hap has ladd^
In sundry wise he was traueyled
But how so ever he be assailed
His latter end shall be good
And for to speak how that it stood
Of thayse his dou^ter where she dwells /
In tharse as the cronycle t^lleth
She was well kept she was well ^oked
She was well taught and well ^oked
So well she sped her in her yout^e
That she of every wysdom couthe
That for to seche in every ^onde
So wise another no man fond
Ne so well taught at man's eye
But ever woo worth false envy

fOr it befyl that time so
A daughter had strangulyo
Which was cl^ped phy^^t^nne
But fame which will ever run
Came al day to her moders ^ere
And says where ever her douter were
With thaise set in any place
The common voice the common grace
Was al upon that other maid
And of her daughter no man said
Who was wroth but dyonyse than
Her thought a thousand year till than
She might be of thaise wreke
Of that she herd folk so speak
And fyl that ylke same tide
That deed was true lecheryde
Which had be servant of thaise
So that she was the wors at ease
For she has then no seru^se
But only thorugh this dyonyse
Which was her dedely enemy
Thorugh pure treson and envy
She that of al sorrow can
Tho spoke she unto her bondeman
Which c^eped was theo phylus
And made him swear in cou^ceyl thus
That he such time as she him set
Shall come thayse for to fette
And led her out of al sight
Where that no man her help might
Upon the stroude nygh the sea
And there he shall this maiden slay
This chorles heart is in a trance
As he which drad him of vengeaun^
When time comes another day
But y^^ durst he not say n^y
But swore and said he should fulfille
Her hestys at her own will

aNd treson and the time it shape
So fell it that the chorles knape
Has lad this maiden where he would
Upon the s^ronde and what she should
She was a drad and ^e out brayde
A rusty s^berd and to her said
Thou shall (...) deed alas ^d she

And ^or the ^^^e of god al might

She my^ knele upon the ground
Toward the heaven for to c^aue
Her wooful sow^ for to save
And with noise and with this cry
Out of a barge fast by
Which hyd was there on scomer fare
Men sterten out and were ^ ware
Of this fe^on and he to goo
And she began to cry tho
A^ mercy help for gods sa^e
In to the barge they her take
As thieves should and forth they went
Upon the se^ the wind hem hente
And malgre where they would or none
Tofore the weder forth they gone
There help no sail there help none oore
Forstormed and forblowen sore
In great ^^ryl so forth they drive
Till at last ^^ey aryue
At Myte ^ne the cytee
In haven ^auffe and when they be
The mais^^r shypman made him boun
And goes him in to the town
And proffereth thayse for to selle
One leonyum it herd tell
Which master of the ^ordel was
And bad him goo a ready paas
To fetchen her and forth he went
And thayse out of his barge he hent
And to this borde^er he her sold
And that he by her body would
Take advantage let do cry
That what man would his lecherye
Atempte upon her maydenhede
Lay down the gold and he should speed
And thus when he has cried hi^ out
In sight of all the people about
Quater leoninus ^haisi ad lupa n^r destinauit vbi dei gracia preuenta ipsius
virginitatem nullus viola^e po tuit

He lad her to the bordel tho
No wondre is though she be woo
Clo^s in a chamber by her self
Each after other ten or ^welf
Of young men in to her went
But such a grace god has her sent
That for the sorrow which she made
Was none of hem which power hade
To done her any vylanye
This leonyum l^t^ ever espy
And wayteth after great beyete
But al for naught she was forle^^
That no man would there come
When he thereof had head nome
And knew that she was yet a maid
Unto his own man he said
That he with strength ageyn her leave
So should her maydenhode byreue
This man went in but so it ferde
When he her wooful ple yntes herd
And he thereof has take great k^pe
Him list better for to weep
Than do cught ^llys to the game
And thus she kept her self fro shame
And knelyd down to therthe and prayed
Unto this man and thus she said
If so be that thy master would
That I his gold encrece should
It may not fall by this weye
But suffer me to goo my weye
Out of this hows where I am in
And I shall do him for to win
In sum place here of the town
By so it be of relygyowne
Where that honest wymmen dwell
And thus thou myt thy master tell
That when I have a chamber there
Let him do cry al wide where
What board that has his daughter dear
And is in will that she shall lere
Of such a scole that is true
I shall her t^che of things new
Which that none other woman can
In all this land and tho this man
Her tale has herd he goes ageyn
And told unto his master pleyn
That she has said and thereupon
When that he saw byyete noon
At bordel because of her
He bad his man g^o and spyr
A place where she might abide
That he may win upon sum side
By that she can but at lest
Thus was she saufe of this tempeste
Qualiter thaisis a lupanari virgo liberata inter sacras mulieres hospiciu^
habens scie^cias quib^ edocta fuit nobiles regni puellas ibidem edocebat

He has her fro the bo^dell take
But that was not for gods sake
But for the lucre as she him told
Now com^n tho that comen would
Of wymmen in her lusty youth
To here and set what thing she couthe
She can the wysdom of a clerk
She can of any lusty work
Which to a gentyl woman longs
And so^me of hem she under fongeth
To the cytole and to the harp
And whom it lyketh for to carpe
Proverbs and demaundes slye
And other which they never sye
Which that science so well taught
Whereof she great yeftes raught
That she to lyonyum has won
And thus her name is so begone
In sundry things that she techeth
That all the land unto her secheth
Of young wymmen for to lere
Now let we this maiden here
And speak of dyonyse ageyn
And of theophyle the vyleyn
Of which I spoke of now tofore
When thayse should have be forlore
Qualiter theophilus ad dyonisiam mane rediens affirmauit se thaisim occidisse

His false chorle to his lady
When he came home pryuely
He says madame sleyn I have
This maid thayse and is bygraue
In pryuy place as ye me bid
For thy madame takes head
And keep counceyl how so it stand
This fend which has this understood
Was glad and weneth it be sothe
Now harken herafter how she does
She wepeth she soroweth and co^pleyneth
And of sekenes which she feyneth
She says that thayse suddenly
By night is deed as she and I
To gyder lain nygh my lord
She was a woman of record
And al is leued that she seyth
And for to give a more feyth
Her husbond and eke she both
In black clothes they hem clothe
And made a great enterement
And for the people shall be blente
Of thayse as for the remembrance
After the ryal old vsaunce
A tomb of laton noble and rich
With an image unto her lyche
Lyggyng above thereupon
They made and set it up anon
Her epytaffe and good assyse
Was write above and in this wise
It spoke / ^ ye that this behold
Lo here lies she which was hold
The fairest and the flower of all
Whose name thayse men call
The king of tire appollynus
Her fader was now she lies thus
Fourtene year she was of age
When death her took to her vyage
Qualiter appolinus in regno suo apud tirum existens parliamentum fieri
constituit

Thus was this false treson hyd
Which afterward was wide kyd
As by the tale a man shall here
But to declare my matere
To tire I think to torn ageyn
And tell as the chronicles seyn
When that the king was comen home
And has left in the salt foam
His wife which he may not foryete
For he sum comfort would get
He let sommone a parliament
To which the lords weren assent
That of the time he has been ou ^e
He sees the things al about
And told hem eke how he has fare
While he was out of bond fare
And prayed al to abide
For he would at same tide
Do shape for his wives mind
As he that would not be unkind
Solemn was that ylke office
And rich was the sacrefyce
The feast ryally was hold
And thereto was he well behold
For such a wife as he had one
In thylke days there were none
Oualiter appolinus post perliamentu^ tharsim pro thaise filia sua quereda
adiit qua ibid non inuenta abinde nauigio recessit

Wha^ this was done tha^ he him thout
Upon his daughter and bysought
Such of his lords as he would
That they with him to tharse should
To fette his daughter thayse there
And they anon al ready were
To ship they gone and forth they went
Till they the haven of tharse hente
They bond and fail of that they seche
By couertour and sleyght of speech
This false man strangulyo
And dyonyse his wife also
That he the better trow might
They ladde him to hane a sight
Where that her tomb was arrayed
The less yet he was myspayed
And nethelesse so as he durst
He curses and says all the worste
Unto fortuue as to the blind
Which can no syker weye find
For him she neweth ever emouge
And medleth sorrow with his song
But sithe it may no better be
He thonketh god and forth goes he
Saylyng toward tire ageyn
But suddenly the wind and reyn
Began upon the sea debate
So that he suffer mote algate
Qualiter nauis appollini ventis agi ta^^ pertum v^bis metelene in die quo
fe^^a neptuni ^elebrari co^su^u^t applicu it sz ^pse pre dolor thaisis fike

The law which neptune ordyneth
Whereof ^ul often time he pleyneth
And held him well the more esmayed
Of that he has tofore assayed
So that for pure sorrow and care
Of that he sees this world so fare
The rest he leueth of his caban
That for the counceyl of no man
Ageyn therein he nolde come
But has bynethe his place nome
There he weeping allone lay
There as he saw no light of day
And thus tofore the wind they drive
Till long and late they arryue
With great distress as it was seen
Upon this town of mytelene
Which was a noble cite tho
And happens thylke time so
The lords both and the commune
The high festes of neptune
Upon the stronde at ryuage
As it was custom and usage
Sole pnely they he syghe
When they this strange vessel syghe
Comen and has his sail aualed
That one thereof has spoke and tal^d
Qualiter athana goras vrbis metelene princeps nauim appolini i^uestigans ipsu^
sic contr^statum nichil que respo^dente consola^^ satage^at

tHe lord which of that cite was
Whose name is at^nagoras
Was there and said he would see
What ship it is and who they be
That been therein and after sone
When that he saw it was to done
His large was for him arrayed
And he goes forth and he assayed
He found the ship of great array
But what thing yt it mownte may
He saw they maden heavy chere
But well him thinks by ye manner
That they ben worthy men of blood
And axeth of hem how it stood
And they him tellen all the caas
How that her lord fordryue was
And which a sorrow that he made
Of which there may no man him glade
He prays that he her lord may see
But they him told it may not be
For he lies in so d^rk^ a place
That there may no wight see his face
But for all that though him be loathe
He fond the ladder and down he gothe
And to him spoke but none answer
Ag^yn of him ne might he here
For ought that he can do or seyne
And thus he goes him up ageyn
Qualiter precepto principis ut appollnu^ consolaretur thaisis cu^ cithe^ sua
ad ipsum in obscuro nauis vbi iacebat producta est

Thus was spoke in many a wise
Amongst hem that weren wise
Now this now that but at last
The wysdom of the town thus cast
That young thayse was assent
For if there be a mendement
To glad with this wooful king
Which can so much of every thing
That she shall glade him anon
A messager for her is gone
And she came with her harp in hand
And said hem that she would fond
By all the weyes that she can
To glad with this sorry man
Bur what he was she wist naught
But all the ship her has bysought
That she her wit on him dyspende
In aunter if he might amend
And sayn it shall be well aquyt
When he has vnderstonden it
She goes her down there as he lay
Where that she harpeth many a lay
And like an aungel song with all
But he no more than the wall
Took head of any thing he herd
And when she saw that he so ferde
She falls with him unto words
And tells him of sundry lords
And axeth him demaundes strange
Whereof she made his heart change
And to her speech his err he leyde
And has marvel of that she seyde
For in the proverb and in problem
She spoke and bad he should deem
An many a subtyl questyon
But he for no subiestyon
Which toward him she could sterr
He would not one word answer
But as a mad man otte last
His heed weeping aweye he cast
And half in wrath he bad her goo
But yet she would not do so
And in the derke forth she goes
Till she him towcheth and tha^ he wroeth
And after her with his hand
He smote and thus when she him fond
Dysesed courteysly she said
Do way my lord I am a maid
And if ye wist what I am
And out of what lygnage I came
Ye would not be so saluage
With that he sobreth his courage
Qualiter sicut deus destinauit patri filiam inuentam recognouit

And put aweye his heavy chere
But of hem two a man may here
What is to be so feeble of blood
None wist of other how it stood
And yet the fader at last
His heart upon this maid cast
That he her loves kyndely
And yet he wist never why
But al was know or yt they went
For god which wot her hole intent
Her hertes both anon dyscloseth
The king unto the maid opposes
And axeth first what is her name
And where she learned all this game
And of what kyn she was come
And she that has his words nome
Answers and seith my name is thayse
That was sometime well at ayse
In tharse I was withdraw and fed
There I lernyd till I was spedde
Of that I can my fader eke
I note where I should him seek
He was a king men told me
My mother dreynte was in the sea
Fro point to point to him told
That he has long in heart hold
And never durst make her moan
But only to this lord allone
To whom her heart can not hel^
Terned to woo turned to well
Torn it to good torn it to harm
And he tho took her in his arm
But such a joy as she tho made
Was never seen thus ben they glade
That forth hadden be toforne
Fro this day forth fortune has sworn
To set him upward on the wh^le
So goes the world now woo now well
Qualiter allenag^ras appollinum de n^^ in he spiaum henorifice recollegit and
tha^sim patre consenciente in vxorem ^uxit

tHis king has found new grace
So that out of his derke place
He g^eth him up in to the light
And with him came that sweet wit
His daughter thayse and forth anon
They both in to the caban gone
Which was ordained for the king
And there he did of al his thing
And was arrayed ryally
And cut he came al openly
Where a^^enagoras he fond
Which was lord of all the bond
He prays the king to come and see
The castle both and his cyt^
And thus they goon forth al in fere
T^ie king this board this maiden dear
Thie lord tho made him rich feste
With every thing that was honest
To these with this worthy king
There lacks him no manner thing
But yet for all this nolle array
Wyu^les he was unto that day
As he that yet was of young age
So fyl there in to his courage
The lusty woo the glad pain
Of love which no man may restrain
Yet never might as now tofore
This lord thinks all this world lore
But if the king will done him grace
He wayteth time he wayteth place
Him thout his heart would to lreke
Till he may to this maid speak
And to her fader eke also
For marriage and it fyl so
That al was done right as he thout
His purpoos to an end he brought
She wedded him as for her lord
Thus ben they al of one accord
Qualiter appolinus vna cum filia and eius marito nauim ingredi^tes a metilena

ibid in t^plo diane sacrificaret vela per mare diuertit

Whn^ al was done rit as they would
The king unto his sone told
Of tharse thylke trayterye
And said how now in his company
His daughter and him seluen eke
Shall goo vengeance for to seek
The ships were ready sone
And when they saw it was to done
Without ^ette of any went
With sail up draw forth they went
Toward tharse upon the tide
But he that wot what shall betyde
The hye god which would him keep
When that this king was fast a sleep
By nyghtes time he has him bid
To seek unto another stead
To ephesym he bad him draw
And as it was that time law
He shall do there his sacrefyse
And ^ke he bad in all wise
That in the temple amongst all
His fortune as it is befalle
To w^hyng his daughter and his wife
He shall be know upon his life
The king of this auysyon
Has great ymagynacion
What thing it sygnefye may
Ande nethelesse when it was day
He bad cos^e anchor and abode
And while that he on anchor rode
The wind that was to fore strange
Upon the point began to change
And torneth thither as it should
Tho knew he well that god it would
And ^ud the master make him yare
Tofore the wind for he would fare
To ephesym and so he ^ede
And when he came in to the stead
Where as he should land he londeth
With all the haste he may and fondeth
To shapen him in such a wise
That he may by the morrow arise
And done after the commandment
Of him which has him thider sent
And in the wise that he thought
Upon the morrow so he wrought
His daughter and his sone he nome
And forth to the temple he come
With a great rowte in company
His yeftes for to sacrefye
The cyteeyns tho herden seye
Of such a king that came to pray
Unto dyane the goddess
And left al other business
And camen thither for to see
The king and the solempnyte
Qualiter appolinus ephesym in tem plo dyane sacrifi^^ns vxore^ suam ibid
velatam inuenit qua secum assumpta nauim versus tirum regressus est

With worthy knights enuyroned
The king him setf has abandoned
To the temple in good entente
The door is up and in he went
Where as with great deuocioh
Of holy contemplacion
Within his heart he made his shryfte
And after that a rich yefte
He offreth with great renerence
And there in open audyence
Of hem that stoden al about
He told hem and declares out
His hap such as is him byfalle
There was no thing foryete of all
His wife as it was gods grace
Which was professed in the place
As she that was abbess there
Unto his tale has leyrd her eere
She knew the voys and the vysage
For pure joy as in a rage
She straught to him al at ones
And fyl a swowne upon the stones
Whereof the temple flore was paued
She was anon with water laued
Till she came to her self ageyn
And than she began to seyn
A blessed be the high sonde
That I may see my husbonde
Which whylom he and I were one
The king with that knew her anon
And took her in his arm and kyste
And all the town this sone wyste
Tho was there joy many fold
For every man this tale has told
As for miracle and weren glade
But neu^r man such joy made
As does the king which has his wife
And when men herd how that her life
By him saved and by whom it was
They wondered al of such a caas
Thorugh all the land aroos the speech
Of master Cyrymon the leche
And of the cure which he deed
The king him self this has him bid
And eke the queen forth with him
That he the town of ephesym
Will leave and goo where that they be
For never man of his degree
Has do to hem so mychel good
And he his prouffyt understood
And grau^teth with hem for to wend
And thus they maden there an end
And token leave and went to ship
With all the fair felawshyp
Qualiter appolliuus vna cum vxere ^t fi^ia sua tirum applicuit

This king which now has his desire
Says he would hold his co^^rs to tire
They h^dden wind at will tho
With topsayle cool and forth they goo
And stryken never till they come
To tire where as they have nome
And ^^nden hem with mochel bliss
Th^re was many a mowthe to kiss
Echone ^^elcometh other home
But when the queen to land come
And thayse her deughter by her side
The ^^ye was t^ylke tide
There may no man's tunge tell
They sayden al here comes the well
Of al womanlye grace
The king has take his ryal place
The queen is in to chamber goo
There was great feste arrayed tho
When time was they goon to mete
Al old sawes ben foryete
And gladen hem with joys new
The dyscolered people hew
Is now become a ^^ddy cheke
There was no myrthe for to s^ke
Qualiter appollinus anthenogo ^^m cum tharse vxore sua super tyrum c^rona^^

But every man has what he would
The king as he well ^^ude and shield
Makes to his people right good there
And after sone as thou shall here
A parliament he had somoned
Where he his daughter has coroned
Forthwyth the lord of metelene
That one is king that other queen
And thus the faders ordenaunce
This land has set in governance
And said that he would wend
To tharse for to make an end
Of that his daughter was betrayed
Whereof were al men well paid
And said how it was for to done
The ships weren ready son^
Qualiter appollinus a tiro y mare versus tharsim iter axipiens vindictam
contra strangulionem et dionisiam vx orem suam pro inuiria quam ipi^ thaysi
filie sue intuler^nt iudicialiter assecutus est

aStronge power with him he took
Upon the sky he took his look
And saw the wind was couenable
They hale up ancre with the call
The seyle on hye the stere in hand
And seylen till they come on land
At tharse nygh to the cite
And when they wysten it was he
The town has do him reverence
He tells hem the vyolence
Which the traitor strangulyo
And dyonyse him had do
Tow^lyng his daughter as he herd
And when they wist how it ferde
As he which pe^s and love sought
Unto the town thus he bysought
To done him right in jugement
Anon they weren both assente
With strength of men and cemen sone
And as him thought it was to done
Atteynt they were by the law
And demed to be honged and draw
And brent and with wind to blow
That all the world it might know
And upon this condycyon
The dome in execucion
Was put anon without fail
And every man has great marvel
Which herd tell of this chance
And thonked gods purueaunce
Which does mercy with justice
Slain is the mordrer and the mor^^^^
Thorugh very troth of rightwysnesse
And thorugh mercy save is symplenesse /
Of her whom mercy preserves
Thus has he well that well deserves
Qualiter artestrate pentapolim rege mortuo ipsi de regno epistolas su^ hoc
appolino direxerunt / Vnde appolinus vna cum vxore sua ibidem aduenientes ad
decus imperij cum magno gaudio coronati sunt

When all this thing is goo and ended This king which loved was and frended / A
letter has which came to him By ship fro pentapolym

In which the land has to him write
That he will understand and wit
How in good mind and in good pees
Deed is king arestrates
Whereof they al of one accord
Him prayden as her lyege board
That he the letter will conceive
And come his reygne to receive
Which god has give him and fortune
And thus besought him the comune
Forth with the great lords all
This king saw how it is befalle
Fro tharse and in prosperyte
He took his l^ue of that cite
And goes him in to ship ageyn
The wind was good yt see was pleyn
Hem need not a ryff to slake
Till they pentapolym have take
The land which herd of that tydyng
Was wonder glad of that coming
He rests him a day or two
And took his counceyl to him tho
And set a time of parliament
Where all the land of one assent
Forthwith his wife has him c^roned
Where al good him was forsoned
Lo what it is to be well grounded
For he has first his love founded
Honestlye as for to wedde
Honestly his love he spedde
And had children with his wife
And as him list he led his life
And in ensaumple his life was write
That al lovers myghten wit
How at last it shall be seen
Of love what they wolden mean
For see now on that other side
Antyochus with all his lewd pride
Which set his love unkindly
His end had suddenly
Set ageyn kind upon vengeance
And for his lust has his penance
Confessor ad amantem procedendo

Lo thus my sone thou might lere
What it is to love in good manner
And what to love in other wise
The mede aryseth of the seruyse
Fortune though she be not stable
Yet at sometime is favorable
To hem that been of love true
But certes it is for to rewe
To see love ageyn kind fall
For that makes a man sore to fall
As thou might tofore read
For thy my sone I will the read
To let al other love aweye
But if it be by such a weye
As love and reason will accord
For ellis if that thou discord
And take lust as does a lest
Thy love may not be honest
For by no skyl that I find
Such lust is not of loves kind
Confessio amantis vnde pro finali conclusione consiliu^ confessoris impetrat

mY fader how so that it stand
Your tale is herd and understand
As thing which worthy is to here
Of great ensaumple and great matere
Whereof my fader god you quyte
But in this point my self acquyte
I may right well that never yet
I was assoted in my wit
But only in that worthy place
Where al lust and al grace
Is set that if danger ne were
But that is al my most fere
I note what the fortune acounte
But what thing danger may amou^
te / I wot well for I have assayed
For when my heart is best arrayed
And I have al my wit thorugh sout
Of love to beseech her ought
For all that ever I syke may
^ am concluded with a nay
That one syllable has overthrow
A thousand words in a row
Of such as I best speak can
^^us am I but a l^ude man
But fader for ye ben a clerk
Of love ^ this matere is derke
And I can ever longer the less
But yet I may not let it pass
Your hole counceyl I beseech
That ye me by sum weye teache
What is my best as for an end
My ^^ne unto the truth I wend
Now well I for the love of the
^^te al other tryfles be
hIc super amoris causa finita confessione Confessor Genius ea que sibi
salubrius expediunt sano cousilio finaliter iniungit

The more that the need is hye
The more it needs to be slye
To him which has the need on hand
I have well herd and understand
My sone all that thou have me s^yed
And eke of that thou have me prayed
Now at this time that I shall
As for conclusyon fynal
Counceyl upon the need set
So think I finally to knette
Thy cause where it is to ^^^ke
And make an end of that I spoke
For I ^ehyght the that gift
First when you come under my shryfte
That though I toward venus were
Yet spoke I such words there
That for the preesthode which I have
Mine order and mine estate to save
I said I would of mine office
To virtue more than to vice
Enclyne and teache the my lore
For thy to speken ouermore
Of love which the may avail
Take love where it may avail
For as of this which thou art in
By that thou see it is a sin
And sin may no price deserve
Without price and who shall serve
I note what prouffyt might avail
This follows it if thou travail
Where thou no prouffyt have in price
Thou art toward thy self vnwyce*
And sithe thou myghtest lust atteyne
Of every lust the end is pain
And every pain is good to flce
So it is wonder thing to see
Why such a thing shall be desired
The more that a stock is fyred
The rather in to ashes it torneth
The foot which in the weye sporneth
Fuf often his heed has overthrow
Thus love is blind and can not know
Where that he goes till he be fall
For thy but if it so byfalle
With good counceyl that he be ladde
Him ought for to le^n a dradde
For counceyl it passes al thing
To him which thinks to be a king
And every man for his party
A kingdom has to iustyfye
That is to sayn his own dome
If he mys^ule that kingdom
He leseth him self and that is more
Than if he lost ship or ^ore
And all the* worlds good with all
For what man that in specialle
Has not him self he has not else
No more the perles than the shelles
Al is to him of one valewe
Though he had of his retynewe
The wide world right as he would
When he his heart has not withholde
Toward him self al is in vein
And thus my sone I would seyne
As I said or thou arise
Or that thou fall in such a wise
That thou ne might thy self recover
For love which blind was ever
Makes al his servants blind also
My sone and if thou have been so
Yet is it time to withdraw
And set thy heart under that law
The which of reason is to be governed
And not of will and to be learned
Ensaumple thou have many one
Of now and eke of time a gone
That every lust is but a while
And who that will him self begyle
He may the rather be dysceyued
My sone now thou have conceived
Sum of that I would mean
Here afterward it shall be seen
If that thou leave upon my ^ore
For I can do to the no more
But t^che the the right weye
Now chese if thou wylt live or deye
Hic ^^quitur de contrauersia que inter confessorem and amantem in fine
confessiomis versabatur

My fader so as I have herd
Your tale but if it were answerde
I were mochel for to blame
My woe to you it is but game
That feleth not of that I feel
The felyng of a mannys hele
May not be likened to the heart
I note though I would asterte
And ye be fre from all the pain
Of love whereof I me complain
It is right easy to command
The heart which free goes on ye lau^de
Not of an ox what him ey^eth
It falls often a man*merueyleth
Of that he sees another fa^^
But if he knew him self the fare
And felt it as it is in sothe
He should done right as he does
O^ ellis wors in his degree
For well I wot and so do^ ye
That love has ever ben yet used
So mote I need ben excused
But fader if ye would thus
Unto cupyde and venus
Ben frendel y toward my quarele
So that my heart were in hele
Of love which is in my breast
I wot well than a better priest
Was never made to my behoue
But all the while that I houe
In none certain between the two
I note where I to well or wo^
Shall torn that is al my dread
So that I note what is to read
But for fynal conclusyon*
I think a supplicacion
With pleyne words and express
Write unto venus the goddess
The which I pray you to bear
And bring ageyn a good answer
Tho was between my priest and me
Debate and great perplexyte
My reason understood him well
And knew it was soth every dele
That he has said but not for thy
My will has no thing set thereby
For towchyng unto a wise aporte
It is unto love no dysporte
Yet might never man behold
^esen where love was withholde
They be not of one governance
And thus we fellen in dystaunce
My priest and I / but I spoke fair
And thorugh my words debonayre
Than at last we accorden
So that he says he will accorden
To speak and stand on my side
To venus both and to cupyde
And bad me write what I would
And said me truly that he should
My letter l^re unto the queen
And I sat down upon the grene
Fulfilled of loves fantasye
And with the t^erys of mine eye
Instead of ynke I began to write
The words which I would end^te
Unto ^^pyde and to Venus
And in my letter I said thus
Hic tractat formam cuiusdam supp^^ ^^^onis quam ex part amantis genij
S^^^rdot^s sui Venus sibi porrectam acceptabat

The wooful pain of leaves maladye
Ag^yn the which no physyke anayle
My he^te has so be wapped with soty^
That where that I rest or travail
I find it ever ready to assail
My reason which* can not him deffende
Thus s^che I help whereof I myt amend
First to nature if that I me compleyn
There find I how that every creature
Sometime a year has love in his demeyn
So that the btel wrenne in his mesure
Have of kind love under his cure
And I ^ut one desire which I mys
So ^ut I / has every kind his blys
The reason of my wit it ouerpasseth
Of that nature techeth me the weye
To love and yet no certain she compasses
How shall I speed thus between yt tw^y
I sto^de and note where I shall live or dey
For though reso^ ageyn my will debate
I may not flee yt I ne love algate
Upon my self this ylke tale come How whilo^ Pan which is the god of kind /
with s^ue wrestled and was euercome / For ever I wrasile and ever I am behind
/ That I no strength in all my heart find / whereof I may ston den any trow /
So far my wit with love is overthrow

Whom needs help he mote help crave Or helpeles he shall his need spylle
Pleynly and thorugh sought my wits al I have / But none of hem can help
after my will / But also well I might sit stylle / As pray unto my lady of
any help / Thus wot I not whereof my self to help

Unto the great Jove and if it bid To do me grace of thylke sweet tonne which
under key in his s^lere a^yd Lies couched yt fortune is ouerco^me But of the
bitter cup I have bege^ne I note how often and thus I find no game / For ever
I ask and it is ye same

I see the world sto^deth upon ^schau^ge Now wind loud and ^ow the weder
soft / I may see eke the great moan change / And thing which now is low is
^fto in ^ofte / The dredeful were res in to pees full often / They torn and ever
is danger in one place / which will not change his will to do me grace

But upon this great clerk ouyde / Of love when he makes his remembrance

He says there is the blind cupide The which has love under his governance /
And with his hand many a fyry lance / He wounds often there he will not h^^e
/ And that somdele is cause of my quarele

Ouyde says eke yt love to parfourme Stante in ye ho^de of venus ye goddess
But when she takes her counceyl with satourne / There is no grace and in that
time I guess / Began my love of which mine heaviness / Is now and ever shall but
I speed / So wot I not my self what is to read

For thy to you cupyde and venus both with all my hertes obeysaunce I pray If
ye were at first time wroth when I began to love I you say Now stynte and do
thilke fortune away So that danger which stondeth of retynewe / with all my
lady his place may renew

O thou cupyde god of loves law That with thy darte brennyng have set a fire
/ My heart so that wound wythdrawe / Or give me salve such as I desire / For
service in thy court wythouten hyre / To me which ever yet has kept thyn
heste / May never be to loves law honest

O thou gentyl venus loves kind queen / without gylte thou do o^ me thy
wreche / Thou wotest my peyn is ever elyche grene / For love and yet I may it
not areche / Thus would I for my last word, byseche / That thou my love
acquyte as I deserve Or else do me plainly for to sterue

Hic loquitur qualiter venus accepta amantis supplicacione indilate ad singula
respondit

wHen I this supplicacion
With good deliberacion
In such a wise as ye now wit
Had after mine enteute write
Unto cupyde and venus
This priest which hight Genyus
It took on hand to present
On my message and forth he went
To venus for to wit her will
And I bode in the place stylle
And bode there but a little while
Not fully the mountenau^ce of a mile
Whom I beheld and suddenly
I saw where venus stood me by
So as I might under a tree
To ground I fell upon my kne^
And preyed her for to do me grace
She cast her chere upon my face
And as it were haluyng a game
She axeth me what was my name
Madame I said Johan gower
Now Johan quoth she in my power
Thou must as of thy love stand
For I thy will have understand
In which to cupyde and to me
Somdele thou have compleyned the
And somdele to nature also
But that shall stand emonge ye two
For thereof have I not to done
For nature is under the moon
Maystresse of every lives kind
But if so be that she may find
So^me holy man that will withdraw
His kyndely lust ageyn her law
But selde when it falls so
For few men there ben of tho
But of these other enough there be
Which of her own nycete
Ageyn nature and her office
Delyten hem in sundry wise
Wh^rof that she full often has pleyned
And eke my court it has dysdeyned
And ever shall for it rec^yueth
None such that kind so dysceyueth
For all onely^he on genty ^loue
My court stont / al courts above
And takes not in to^retinewe
But thing which is to kind delbe
For else it shall be refused
Whereof I hold the excused
For it is many days gone
That thou emonge hem were oue
Which of my court have be withholde
So that the more I am behold
For thy dyscase to comune
And to renew that fortune
Which many days has the grieved
But of my counceyl may be leued
Thou shall be esed or thou goo
Of thylke vnsely ioly woo
Whereof than say thyn heart is fyred
But of that thou have desired
After the sentence of thy bylle
Thou must ^o thereof at my will
And I thereof me will advise
And be thou hole it shall suffyse
My medecyn is not to seek
T^^ which is holsem to the seek
Not al perchance as ye it would
But so as ye by reason should
Accordaunt unto loves kind
For in the plyte which I the find
So as my court it has awarded
Thou shall be duly rewarded
And if thou would more crave
It is no right that thou it have
Qui cupit id quod habere nequit sua tempora perdit / Est vbi non posse b^lle
salute caret / Non estatis opus ge^^dis hirsuta capillos / Cum calor abc^ssit
equiparabit hiemps / Sicut habet mayus non dat natura decembri / Nec poterit
compar floribus esse lutu^

Sic neq decrepita senium iuuenile vo luptas / Floret in obsequium quod venus
ipsa petit / Coueniens igitur foret nec quoth ^^ua senectus / Attigit veterius
corpora casta col^nt /

Hic co^tra quoscu^q viros inue teratos amoris concupiscenciam affectans
loq^tur venus huius q amantis confessi suppstcationem quasi deridens ipsum pro
eo quoth senexit debilis est multis exortutionibus insufficientem redargu it

vEnus which stonte with out law
In none certain but as men draw
Of ragman upon the chance
She leyeth no peyse in the balaunce
But as her lyketh for to weye
The true man full often all weye
She put which has her grace bid
And set an untrue in his stead
Lo thus blyndely ye world she demeth
In loves cause as to me seems
I note what other men should seyn
But I algate am so beseyn
And stand as one amongst all
Which am out of his grace fall
It needs take no witness
For she which said is the goddess
To whether part of love it we^de
Has set me for a fynal end
The point whereto that I shall hold
For when she has me well behold
Haluyng of scorn she said thus
Then wist thou that I was venus
Which al only my lusts seche
And well I wot though thou beseech
My love lusts ben there none
Which I may take of thy person
For loves lust and locks hoar
In chamber accorden never more
And though thou feyn a young courage
It shows well by thy vysage
That old grysel is no fool
There ben full many yerys stole
With the and such other moo
That outeward thought so
And beth within of power assaye
My heart would and I ne may
Is naught loved now a days
Or thou make any such assayes
To love and fall vppn the fete
Better is to make a beaw retrete
For though thou mytest lone atteyne
Yet were it but an ydel pain
When thou art not suffysaunte
To held love his couenaunte
For thy take home thy h^rte ageyn
That thou traueyle not in veyn
Whereof my court may be dysceyued
I wot and have it well conceived
How that thy will is good enough
But more behooves to the plough
Whereof the lacks as I trow
So s^t it well that thou be know
In feeble estate or thou begin
Thing where you might none end wyn
What bargeyn should a man assayr
When that him lacks for to pay
My sone if that thou well bethought
This touches the foryete it naught
The thing is turned in to was
The which was whylom grene gras
Is ^elowed hey as time now
For thy my counceyl is that thou
Remember well how thou art old
When venus has her tale told
Qualiter super derisoriam veneris exhortacione co^tristatus amans quasi
mortuus in terram corru^t vbi vt sibi videbatur cupidinem cum in numera
multitudine nuper amantum varijs turmis assistenaum conspicicbat

When I bethought was al abowte
And wist well withouten doubt
That there was no recouyre
And as a man by blase of fire
With water quenches so fare I
A cold me caught suddenly
For sorrow that my heart made
My dedely fare pale and fade
Bycome in swowne I fyl to ground
And as I lay the same stounde
Ne fully quycke ne fully deed
Me thought I saw tofore mine heed
Cupyde with his bow bente
And like unto a parliament
Which were ordained for the^ nones
With him arm and al ye world attones
Of gentyl folk that whylom were
Lovers I saw hem al there
Forth with cupyde in sundry rowtes
Mine eye I cast al aboutes
To know emonge hem who was who
I saw where lusty yongthe th^^
As he which was a capetayn
Before al other upon the plain
Stood with his rowte well begone
Her heedes kempte and thereupon
Garbondes not of one color
So^me of the leef and sum of ye flower
And sum of the great perles were
The new guyse of beme was there
With sundry things well devised
I see whereof they be quentysed
It was al lust that they with ferde
There was no song that I ne herd
Of love to love touching
Of Pan and all that was lykyng
As in pypyng of melodye
Was herd in thylke company
So loud that on every side
I thought that all the heaven cryde
In such accord and such a soun
Of bumbard and of claryoun
With cor^emuse and shalmele
That it was half a man's hele
So glad a noise for to here
And as me thought in this matere
Al fresshe I saw hem spring and dau^ce
And do to love her entendaunce
After the lust of yongthes heste
There was enough of joy and feste
For ever emonge they loughe and pleye
And put care out of the weye
And he with hem ne sat ne stood
And over this I understood
So as mine ^re might areche
The most matere of her speech
De nominibus illerum nuper aman tum spasinoto aliqui inuenes aliqui se nes
apparueru^t Senes autem precipue tam erga deum quam deam amoris pro sauitate a
mantis recuperanda multiplicatis precibus misericorditer instabant

It was* of knyghthode and of arms
And what it is to lygge in arms
With love when it is acheued
There was tristra^ which was fyleued
With bele Isolde and lancelote
Stood with gu^nor and galahote
With his lady and as me thought
I saw where Jason with him brout
His love which creusa hight
And hercules with mochel might
Was there beryng his great mace
And most of al in thylke place
He payneth to make chere
With Eolen which was him dear
Theseus though he were untrue
To love al wymmen knew
Yet was he there nethelese
And phedra which to love he chese
Of greece eke there was thelamon
Which fro the king lameodon
At troy his daughter refte aweye
Eseonen as for his preye
Which take was when Jason came
Fro colcos and the cy^e name
In vengeance of the first hate
That made hem after to debate
When pryamus the new town
Has made and in auysyowne
Me thought that I saw also
Ector forth with his brethe^n two
Him self stood with panrasylee
And next to him I might see
Where paryse stood with fair helayn
Which was his joy souerayn
And troylus stood with Crys^yde
But ever emonge though he pleyde
By semblaunce he was heavy chered
For dyomede as him was lered
Claymeth to be his partynere
And thus full many a bachelere
A thousand moo than I can seyn
With yongthe I saw there well beseyn
Forth with her loves glad and blythe
And sum I saw which often sithe
Compleynen them in other wise
Emonge the which I saw narcyse
And pyramus that sorry were
The worthy greeks also were there
Achylles which for lone deyed
Agamenon eke as men seyed
And menelay the king also
I saw with many another moo
Which had by fortune sore
Loves cause and over more
Of wymmen in the same caas
With hem I saw where dyd^ was
Forsake which was with enee
And phylles eke I might see
Whom demephon dysceyued had
And adryane her sorrow lad
For theseus her sister took
And her unkindly forsook
He saw there eke emonge the prees
Compleynyng upon hercules
His first love dya^yre
Which set him afterward a fire
Medea was there eke and compleyneth
Upon Jason for that he feyneth
Without cause and took a new
She said ^ye on al vn^^^we
I saw there deya^ye
Which had lost company
Of ach^lles when dyomede
To ^^ye him fette upon the need
Emonge these other upon the grene
I saw also the wooful queen
Cleopa^^^s within a grane
With serpents has her self bygra u^
Al quyche and so she was to tore
For sorrow of that she had tore
Antony which her love has be
And forth with I saw her thysbe
Which upon the sharp swerdes point
For love deyed in sorry point
And as mine ere it might know
She said woe worth al slow
^^^ pleyne of proygne and phylomene
(...) herd I what it would mean
How ^^^us and his untruth
Vndyd hem both and that was couthe
And next to hem I saw can^ce
Which maychayr her faders grace
Has lost and deyed in wooful plyte
And a^ I saw in my spyryte
Me thought emonge other thus
The daughter of king pryamus
Po^x^na whom pyrrus slough
Was there and made sorrow y nough
As she which deyed gyltelis
For ^oue and yet was loueles
And for to take the dysporte
I saw there sum of other port
And that was Circes and calypse
That could done the moon clypse
Of m^n and change the sykenesse
Of ar^emagique sorceresse
They held in hand many one
To love whether they would or none
But above al wo^men yt there were
Of wommen ^ saw four there
Whose name be here most commended
By hem the court stood al amended
Forth were they come in presence
Men did them the reueremce
As though they had been goddesses
Of all the world or empresses
And as me thought an ere I leyde
And herd how that this other seyde
Lo thyes ben the four wives
Whose fey^h was proved in her lives
For in ensaumple of al good
With marriage so they stood
That fame which no great thing hides
Yet the cronyke of hem abides
Penolope the oone was hate
Whom many a knight had loved hot
While that her lord vlyxes lay
Full many a year and many a day
Upon the great syege of troy
But she which had no worlds joy
But only of her husbond
While that her lord was out of land
So well she kept her womanhede
That all the world thereof took head
And namelyche of them in greece
That other woman was lucrece
Wife to the romayn collatyne
And she constreyned of tarquyne
To thing which was against her will
She would not her seluen still
But deyed only for dread of shame
In keeping of her good name
As she which was one of the best
The third wife was hot alceste
Which when ametus should dye
Upon his great maladye
She prayed unto the gods so
That she resceyueth all the woe
And deyed her self to give him life
So was this then a noble wife
The fourrth wife which I there syghe
I herd of them that were nyghe
How she was clered alsione
Which to seix her lord allone
And to no mo hi^ body kept
And wha^ she saw him dre^che she lepte
Unto the wawes where he swam
And there a sce foul she becam
And with her wings she him besp^^d
For love that she to him had
Loo these four weren tho
Which I saw as me thought tho
Emonge the great company
Which love had for to gye
But yongthe which in special
Of loves court was marchal
So ^^sy was upon his lay
That he none head where he lay
Has take and than as I beheld
Me thought I saw upon the feld^
Where ^lde came a soft pa^^
Toward venus there as she was
With him great company he ladde
But not so feel as yongthe had
The most part were of great age
And that was seen in her vysage
And not for thy so as they might
They made hem yongely to the sight
But yet I herd no pypers there
To make myrthe in man's (...)
But the ^^nsyque I might know
For old men which solbned lolbe
With harp and lute and ^ytole
The houe dance and the ca^^le
In such a wise as love has bid
A soft paas they dance and trede
And with the wymm^n otherwhyle
With sobre there ^monge they smyle
For laughter was there none on hye
And nethe^^es full well I sye
That they the more queynte it made
For love in whom they weren glade
And there me thought I might see
The king dauyd with bersale
And salamon was not without
Passing an hundredth in a route
Of wives and of concubynes
Iewesses eke and sarazyns
To him I sabe al Intendaunt
I note where he was suffysaunt
But neth^lees for all his wit
He was attached with that writ
Which love with his hand ^nse^eth
From whom none erthly man appe^eth
And over this as for a wonder
With his l^on which he put under
With dalyda sampson I knew
Whose love his strength al ouerthr^w^
I saw there arystotle also
Whom that the queen of greece so
Has brydeled that in thylke time
She made him such a sylagesyme
That he foryate al his ^ogyque
There was none art of his practyque
Thorugh which he might be excluded
That he ne was fully concluded
To love and did his obeysaunce
And eke vyrgyle of acquaintance
I saw where he the maiden preyd
Which was the daughter as men seyde
Of the emperor why^om of come
Sorts and plato with him come
So did Ouyde the poet
I thought then how love is sweet
Which has so wise men reclamed
And was my self the less ashamed
Or for to lose or for to win
In the myschyef that I was in
And thus I lay^ in hope of grace
And when they came to the place
Where venus stood and I was fall
This old men with one voice (...)
To venus prayden formy sake
And she that might not forsake
So great a clamor as was there
Le^e pity come in (...) ere
And forth with all unto cupyde
She prays that she upon his side
Me would thorugh his grace send
So^me comfort that I might amend
Upon the ^^as which is byfalle
And thus for me they preyden all
Of hem that weren old about
And eke sum of the young row^^
And of gentylesse and pure truth
I herd hem tell it was great couthe
That I withouten help so ferd^
And thus me thought I lay and herd
Hic traciat qualiter c^pito ama^tis senect^^^ (...) Viscera p^rsc^^t^ns ignita
s^^ concupis^^cie tela ab ^o peni tus extraxit quem venus postea ab^^^ ^^lore
percipiens vacuum reliquid / Et sic tandem prouisa senectus racionem inuocans
hominem interiorem per p^^ns amore infatuatum mentis sanitati p^enius
restaurauit

cVpide which may hurt and hele
In loves cause as for my hele
Upon the point which I him pr^yde
Came with venus where I was leyde
So swownyg upon the grene gras
And as me thought anon there was
On every side so great prees
That every life began to prees
I wot not well how many score
Such as I spoke of now tofor^
Lovers that comen to behold
But most of hem that ^en old
They stoden there that at ylke tyd^
To see what end shall betyde
Upon the cure of my sotye
There might I here great party^
Spe king and each his own aduy^
Has told one that another this
But emonge all this I herd
They weren woo that I so ferde
And sayden that for no ryote
An old man should not asso^^
For as they tolden redyly
There is in him no cause why
But if he would him self be ny^^
So were he well the more nyce
And thus despu^^n sum of tho
And sum ^ayden no thing so
But that the wild loves rage
In man's life forbereth none age
While there is oil for to fire
The lamps be lightly set a fire
And is full hard or it be queynte
But only if it be sum seynte
And thus me thou^t in sundry place
God which prescrueth in his grace
Of hem that walken up and down
There was dy^^rs opinion
And so for a while it last
Till that cupyde at the last
Forthwith his mother full aduysed
Has determined and devised
Unto what point he would descend
And all this time I was lyggende
Upon the ground tofore his eyes
And they that my dysese syen
Supposen not that I should lyuen
But he which would than yeuen
His grace so as it may be
This blind god which may not see
Has groped till that he me fonds
And as he put forth his hand
Upon my body where I lay
Me thought a fyry lau^cegaye
Which whylom thorugh my heart he (...)
He pulls out and also fast
As this was do / cupyde name
His weye I note where he became
And so did all the remenaunte
Which unto him was entendaunt
Of hem that in a vysyon
I had a reuelacion
So as I told now tofore
But venus went not therefore
Ne genyus which thylke time
A^oden both fast byme
And she which may the hertes bind
In loves cause and eke unbind
Or I out of my trance aroos
Venus which held a box cloos
And would not I should deye
Took out more cold then any keye
An oynement and in such apoynte
She has my wounded her^^ anoynte
My temples and my royames also
And forth with all she take me tho
A wonder myrcour for to hold
In which she bad me to behold
And take heed of that I s^ye
Wherein anon my hertes e^^
I cast and saw my color fade
Mine eyes dym and al vnglade
My chekes thynne and al my face
With elde I might see defa^e
So ^yueled and so woo bysayn
That there was no thing full ne plain
I fawe also mine h^^ris hoar
My will was tho to ^ce no more
Therewith for there was no plesaunce
And then in to my remembrance
I drew mine old days passed
And res^n it has compassed
Quod ^^atus hoi^s me^sius a^ni (...)

I made a ^^knesse of my self
Unto the sundry months (...)
Whereof the year in his estate
Is made and stante in no debute
That like to other none accords
For who the times well records
And then at ma^che if he begin
When that the lusty year comes in
Ty^ it be passed septem^re
The mighty yongth he may remember
In which the year has his deduyte
Of gras of flower of corn of f^^yte
Of leef and eke the Wyn grape
And afterward this time is shape
To frost to snow to wind to reyne
Ty^ efte that march be come again
The wyntrr will no summer know
The grene leef is over throw
The clothed ^rthe is than bare
Dyspoyled is the summer fare
Tha^erst was hot is than chele
And thus thynkyng thoughts fel^
I was out of my swo^^e asrayed
Whereof I saw my wits a^trayed
And began to c^^pe hem home ageyn
And when reason it herd seyn
That loves rage was albeye
He came to me the right (...)
And has remenyd the sotye
Of thylke unwise fantasye
Whereof that I was wont to plain
So that of thylke fyry pain
I was made s^bre and hole enough
Venus beheld me then and lough
And ^xeth as it were in game
What love was and I for shame
Ne wist what I should answer
And nethelesse I began to swear
That by my troth I know him neu^t
So far it was out of my thought
Right as it had never be
My good sone tho ^d she
Now at this time I leave it we^e
So goes the fortune of my Whele
For thy my counceyl is thou love
Madame I said by your love
Ye wot well and so do I
That I am un behouely
Your court fxo this day forth to seru^
And for I may no thonke deserve
And also for I am refused
I pray you to ben excused
And nethelees as for the last
While that my wits has me^ last
Tow^hyng my confession
I axe an absolucion
Of genyus or that I goo
The prcest anon was ready the
And said sone as of thy shryfte
Thou have full pardon and full yefte
Foryete it thou and so will I
My holy fader grant mercy
Quod I to him and to the queen
I fyl on knees upon the grene
And took my love for to wend
But she that would make an end
As thereto which was most able
A pay^e of ^edes black as sable
She took and hynge mine neck about
Upon the gaudees al without
Was write of gold pur reposere
^o thus she said Johan gowere
Now thou a^te at last cast
Thus have I for thy ^^as cast
That thou of love no more seche
But my will is that thou beseech
And pray^ herafter for the pees
And that thou make a pleyn relees
To love which takes l^tel head
Of old men upon the need
When that the lusts ^en albeye
For thy to the nys but one weye
For which reason be thy ^yde
For he may sone him self mysgyde
That sees not the pery^^e tofore
My sone be well were therefore
And keep the sentence of my lore
And tarry thou my court no more
But goo there moralle virtue dwells
Where ben thy books as m^n tells
Which of long time thou have write
For this I do the well to wit
If thou thyn hele will purchase
Thou might not make such a chase
Where that the game is not prouable
It were a thing unreasonable
A ^^an to be so ouerseye
For thy take heed of that I seye
For in the law of my commune
We be not shapen to comune
Thy self and I never after this
Now have I said all that there is
Of love as for thy fynal end
A dew for I mo^e fro the wend
And great well chau^^^ when ye me^e
As my discyple and my poet
For in the (...) of his youth
In sundry wise a^ he well couthe
Of dy^ees and of songs glade
The which he for my sake made
The bond fulfilled is over all
Whereof to him in specyalle
Above al other I am most hold
For thy now in his days old
Thou shall him tell this message
That (...) upon his latter age
To set an end of al his work
As he which is mine own clerk
Do make his testament of love
As thou have done thy shryfte about
So that my court it may record
Madame I can me well accord
Quod I to tell as ye me ^ydde
And with that word it so betydde
Out of sight al sodeynlye
Enclosed in a sterred sky
Venus which is the queen of love
Was take in to her place above
More wist I not where she bycam
And thus of her my leave I nam
And forth with all the same ty^e
Her priest which would not abide
Or me be leef or me be booth
Out of my sight forth he gooth
And I was left withouten help
So wist I not whereof to yelpe
But that only I had lore
My time / and was sorry therefore
And thus bywhaped in my thought
When al was turned in to naught
I stood amassed for a while
And in my self I began to smyle
Thynkyng upon the bedes ^lake
And how they were me betake
For that I should bid and pray
And when I saw none other way
But only that I was refused
Unto the life which I had used
I thought never to torn ageyn
And in this Wise soth to sayn
Homewarde a soft paas I went
Where as with all mine hole entente
Upon the point that I am shryue
I think to bydde while I live
Marce precor xpriste populus quo gau det iste / Anglia ne triste subeat rex
sum resist / Corrige quosque fragiles absolve reatus / vnde deo gratus
vigeat ^ocus iste beatus

hE which within days seven
This large world forthwith the heaven
Of his eternal prouydence
Has maad / and thylke intellygence
In man's soul reasonable
Has shape to be perdurable
Whereof the ^an of his feture
Above al erthely creature
After the soul is inmortal
To thylke lord in special
As he which is of al things
The creator and of the kings
Has the fortunes upon hand
His grace and mercy for to fond
Upon my bare knees I preye
That he this land in syker weye
Will set upon good governance
For if men taken remembrance
What is to live in unity
There is no state in his degree
That n^ ought to desire pees
Without which it is no lees
To seche and look in to the last
There may no worlds joy last
First for to look the clergy
Hem ought well to iustefye
Thing which bylongeth to their cure
As for to pray and to pro^^re
Our pees toward the heaven above
And eke to set rest and love
Emonge us on this earth here
For if they wrought in this manner
After the rule of charity
I hope that men sholden see
This land amended and over this
To seche and look how it is
Touchend of the chyualrye
Which for to look in sum party
Is worthy for to be commendyd
And in sum part to ^e amended
That of her large retenue
The land is full of meyntenue
Which causes that common right
In few contrees stand up ^ight
Extorcyon / contek / rauyne
Withholde ben of that couyne
Al day men here great compleynte
Of the disease of the constreynte
Whereof the people is sore oppressyd
God grant it mote be redressyd
For of knyghthode thordre would
That they deffende and keep should
The common right and the fraunchyse
Of holy church in all wise
So that no wicked man it dear
And thereof serves shield and spear
But for it goes now other weye
Our grace goes the more aweye
And for to ^oken ouermore
Whereof the people pleynen sore
Toward the laws of our land
Men say yt troth has broke his bo^de
And with brocage is goon aweye
So that no man can see the weye
Where for to find rightwisnesse
And if men seek sykernesse
Upon the lucre of marchandye
Compassement and trycherye
Of synguler prouffyte to win
Men sayn is cause of mochel sin
And namely of dyuysyoun
Which many a noble town
Fro welthe and fro prosperyte
Has brought to great aduersyte
So were it good to be allone
For mochel grace thereupon
Unto the cytees should fall
Which might avail to us all
If these estates amended were
So that the virtues stoden there
And that the vices were aweye
Me thinks I durst then seye
This lands grace should arise
But yet to look in other wise
There is astate as ye shall here
Above al other on earth here
Which has the land in his balaunce
To him bylongeth the lygeaunce
Of clerk of knight of man of law
Under his hand al is forth draw
The merchant and the laborer
So stante it al in his power
Or for to spylle or for to save
But though he such power have
And that his myghtes be so large
He has hem naught without charge
To which that every king is swore
So were it good that he therefore
First unto the rightwysnes entende
Whereof that he him self amend
Toward his god and leave vice
Which is the chyef of his office
And after all the remenaunt
He shall upon his covenant
Govern and led in such a wise
So that there be no tyrannyse
Whereof that he his people grieve
Or ellis may he naught acheue
That longs to his regalye
For if a king will Iustefye
His land and hem that ^en within
First at him self he must begin
To keep and rule his own estate
That in him self be no debute
Toward his god for otherwise
There may none erthely king suffyse
Of his kingdom the folk to lead
But he the king of heaven dread
For what king set him upon pride
Ad takes his lust on every side
And will not goo the right weye
Though god his grace cast aweye
No wondre is / for at last
He shall well wit it may not last
The pomp which he secheth here
But what king with humble chere
After the law of god escheweth
The vices / and the virtues selveth
His grace shall be suffysauunt
To govern all the remenaunte
Which longs to his duete
So that in his prosperity
The people shall not be oppressyd
Whereof his name shall be blessed
For ever and be memoryalle
And now to speak as in fynalle
Tolbchyng that I undertook
In english for to make a book
Which stante between ernest and game
I have it made as thylke same
Which axe for to be excused
And that my book be not refused
Of lered men when they it see
For lack of curyosyte
For thylke scole of eboquence
Bylongeth not to my science
Upon the form of rethorike
My words for to peynte and pyke
As tullyus sometime wrote
But this I know and thus I wot
That I have done my true pain
With rude words and with pleyne
In all that ever I couthe and might
This book to write as I behyght
So as sekenes it suffer would
And also for my days old
That I am feeble and Impotente
I wot not how the world is went
So pray I to my lords all
Now in mine age how so byfalle
That I mote stonden in their grace
For though me lack to purchase
Her worthy thank as by deserte
Yet the symplesse of my pouerte
Desires for to do plesaunce
To hem under whose governance
I hope spker to abide
But now upon my last tide
That I this book have made and write
My muse does me for to wit
And says it shall be for my best
Fro thie day ferth to take rest
That I no more of love make
Which many a horte has overtake
And ouertorned as the blind
Fro reason in to salbe of kind
Where as the wysdem goes aweye
And can not see the right weye
How to govern his own estate
But every day stante in debate
Within him self and can not leave
And thus for thy my synal leave
I take now for evermore
Without making any more
Of love and of his dedely hele
Which no physycyen can hele
For his nature is so diverse
That it has ever sum trauers
Or of to much or of to lyte
That plainly may no man delight
For him fails or that or this
But thylke love which that is
Within a man's heart affermed
And stante of charity conformed
Such love is goodly for to have
Such love may the body save
Such love may the selvle amend
The high god such love us send
Forthwith the remenaunte of grace
So that above in thylke place
Where rests love and al pees
Our joy may be endelees
Amen
