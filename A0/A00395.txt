THE GREAT MYSTERY OF GODLINESS: JESUS CHRIST our Lord GOD and MAN, and MAN
with GOD; One in JESUS CHRIST our LORD.

By Mr. ERBURY Minister of the Word.

1 COR. 2. 6, 7, 14. We speak wisdom among them that are perfect; yet not the
wisdom of this world, nor of the Princes of this world that come to naught;
But we speak the wisdom of God in a Mystery.

But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God; for they
are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them because they are
spiritually discerned.

Gal. 3. 28. Ye are All, One, in Jesus Christ. LONDON, Printed by M. F. for
ROB. MILBOURNE, in little Britain, at the sign of the Holy Lamb. 1640.

THE MYSTICAL Union of CHRIST and his CHURCH; Grace, Mercy and Peace with all
spiritual and special blessings of Heaven be multiplied upon you and in you,
by the blessed Spirit from God the Father through CHRIST JESUS our Lord. Amen.
Q.WHat must you do to be holy here, and happy hereafter?

A. Two things; First, Know CHRIST, John, 17. 3.

Secondly, Be knit unto him, John ^7. 21, 22, 23, 24.

Q. By what means may we come ^o this?

A. First, Outwardly.

1. In the Word I am taught to know him Joh. 17. 8.

2. In the Sacraments I am tied and knit to him, 1 Cor. 10. 61.

Secondly, inwardly

1. By Faith on my part, Ephe. 3. 17. Gal. 3. 27, 28, 29. 1. Grounded on the
Word wherein I receive him. 2. Growing in the Sacrament wherein I am received
into him.


2. By the Spirit on Gods part, 1 Cor. 6. 17. and 12. 13. 1. Assuring Christ
unto me in the Word, Ephesians. 1. 13. 2. Sealing Christ unto me in the Sacrament,
Romans 4. 11.


This is my Body, so the Word says without, when the bread is given in the
Sacrament, and so the Spirit speaks within, assuring, yea,

making
1. The Body of Christ as verily present to the faithful, as the bread is to
the receiver, 1 Cor. 11. 24, 26. 2. The faithful partaker of Christ's Body as
verily as of the bread which he eats, 1 Cor. 10. 16. 3. The faithful one with
Christ's Body as verily as the bread received and eaten is one with his body
that feeds upon it, 1 Cor. 12. 12.
PART.I.
Quest. WHat is it to know Christ?

A. To find
1. The want of Christ, Phil. 3. 7. 2. The worth of Christ, Phil. 3. 8. 3. A
willingness in me to receive Christ, Phil. 3. 9, 10, 12, 14.
First, when I feel the want of Christ in respect of the guilt and filth of
sin in me. Secondly, find the worth of Christ to pardon and purge my sin.
Thirdly, feel and find a willingness in me to receive, Christ, that is, to
accept of him on his own conditions.

1 Not only to be my Priest and Jesus to save me by his blood, Heb. 2. 17

2 Nor only to be my Prophet and Christ, to teach me by his Word, Act. 3. 22.

3 But also to be my Prince and Lord to rule me by his Spirit, leaving my old
lust, and living by his laws, denying my self, and delighting to do whatever
he commands, Act. 5. 31.

Then I know Christ, and this is to believe in him. Read 1 John 1. 6, 7. and
cha. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. So Mat. 28. 20. Mar. 9. from v. 43. to the end. Luke 6. 46.
Joh. 15. 14.

. 1.
Q. HOw do you know the want of Christ?

A. 1 I am far and for ever in my self separated from God by my sin natural
and actual, Isa. 59. 2. Psalm. 58 3. Ephe. 2. 13, 14.

2 I am foully stained and stinking with all sin in my whole nature, soul and
body, Psalm. 14. 3. and 51. 5. Romans 3 from ver. 10. to 20.

3 There is no power in me to think a good thought, or to keep any one of Gods
commandments once in all my life, 2 Cor. 3. 5. Romans 3. 9, 10. James 3. 2.

4 There is no plague but is upon me, and for the sinfulness of my nature and
sins of my life, every curse of God is on my soul and body in this life, and
that which is to come, Deuteronomy. 27. 26. and 28. 16 Mat. 25. 41.

5 There is no good dwelling in my flesh, nay not only an emptiness of all
good, but an enmity against it, Genesis 6. 5. Romans 7. 18. and 8. 7.

6 I have no power to please God in any good I do, Romans 8. 8. Prove. 15. 8.
Heb. 11. 6.

7 I have no hope to go to heaven when I die, 1 Cor. 15. 50. Rev. 21. 27.

O how miserable and wretched is that man or woman that lives and dies (as many
do, Mat. 7. 13.) in this corrupt and cursed condition without Christ!

. 2.
Q. What worth do you find in Christ?

A. 1. The excellency of his person, being the only begotten, beloved Son of
God, the heir of all things, the head of his Church, Angels, Principalities
and Powers, being subject unto him, Ephesians. 1. 21, 22. Col. 1. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
Heb. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1 Pet. 3. 22.

2 The exceeding riches of his grace freely offered, and fully given unto me in
the Gospel, Ephesians. 2. 7. and 3. 8. Isay 61. 1, etc.

3 The blessings that he brings, Acts 3. 26. Ephesians. 1. 3.

4 The graces that he gives, John 1. 14. 16.

O how happy is that man or woman that is made one with the Son of God! (how
few are they Christ knows, Mat. 7. 14.) yet thrice happy is he or she that
have him for their head and husband, who has all power in his hands, all
heavenly blessings to bestow upon them, all spiritual graces to give unto
them, and an unsearchable riches of grace to endow them to eternal glory.

Q. What is the grace of Christ?

A. It is an honorable, holy and happy condition that Christ has called me
unto by the Gospel; who being the second Adam, received my nature unto
himself, restored it with himself into favor with God again from whom I
fell, and raised my fallen nature into a higher favor and grace with God the
Father then it was in the first Adam before his fall, Ephesians. 2. 5, 6.

1 He has taken my nature separated from God, and has now united it to the
Godhead for ever, Joh. 1. 14. Heb. 2. 11, 14.

2 He has sanctified my nature sinful in me, but perfectly holy in him, Luke
1. 35. Joh. 17. 19. Heb. 7. 26.

3 He has in my nature fulfilled the whole Law for me, which I could never
do, Romans 10. 5. and 8. 4.

4 He has for my sin in my stead suffered the whole wrath of the Lord, the
curse of the Law which I could never suffer, Isa. 53. 4, 5. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Gal.
3. 13. 1 Pet. 2. 24.

5 He filled my nature in himself with all grace, God gave him not the Spirit
by measure, but being made flesh, we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, John 1. 14. and 3. 34, 35.

6 He fulfilled all righteousness that was to be done or suffered in life or
death by me, in my nature, in whom God was well pleased, Mat. 3. 15, 17. Mat.
12. 18.

7 He reigns in my nature glorified above all in heaven, Ephesians. 1. 20.

. 3.
Q. Why are you so willing to receive Christ?

A. That I may be knit unto him, Gal, 3. 26. 28.

PART.II.
Q. What is it to be knit unto Christ.

A. To become one with him by his Spirit, and my faith looking up and laying
hold on my nature in him, that as he took my flesh and made it his, so I take
his flesh and make it mine, that thus I might be one with him and he with me.
I dwell in him and he in me; he dwells in me by faith, and I dwell in him in
my flesh; that as my nature is become his, so all his might be mine, Joh. 17.
21. and 6. 56. Ephesians. 3. 17. Cant. 6. 7.

Q. How are you one with Christ Jesus?

A. 1. Not one in conceit and imagination.

2 Nor one in consent and affection.

3 Nor one in substance and transfusion, as if the Godhead or manhood of Christ
were mixed with any substance.

4 But one in spirit, or rather one spirit, that is more, the self-same spirit
dwelling in him, dwells in me: so uniting me unto him, that through his manhood
from his Godhead, it conveyes, and I receive all spiritual life in soul and
body for ever, 1 Cor. 6. 17 Romans 8. 11. 1 John 3. 23. John 6. 60.

Q. What union then is this that is between Christ and you?

A. The nearest that may be imagined: for there is an union, first, of lineage
or flesh; thus many kinsmen are one.

2 Of love or friendship; thus many men are one, Acts 4. 32. the soul of
Jonathan was knit to David, and this union of Spirits is nearer then the first
of bodies.

3 Matrimonial; thus man and wife are one, and this union is nearer then both
the former, seeing married persons are not only one in flesh, but in highest
love and friendship; besides a man must forsake father, nearest flesh and
friends to follow and cleave to his wife.

4 Mystical, thus Christ and his Church are one by a nearer union then all the
three; for Christ is not only, first, partaker of flesh and blood with us,
Heb. 2. 14. Secondly, We are his friends, John 15. 14. Thirdly, he is our
husband also, Isay 54. 5. Fourthly, But also he is our head, and we are members
of his body, of his flesh, and of his bone; and this union is called Mystical,
because it is more then any, unconceivable in thought, and unutterable by
tongue; kinsmen, friends, and married ones must die, and then their union ends.
But Christ has so taken my flesh as never to be divided from it; such a friend
as not life nor death can divide me from him, whose love passes all knowledge
and time, loving me unto the end, and after all; and not only beloved, but I
am betrothed and married to him for ever, and not only betrothed, but I am of
his body, of his flesh, and of his bones, nay, by faith I eat his flesh and
drink his blood, what nearer union can be?

Q. What is it to eat his flesh?

A. 1. To apprehend, apply, and partake of his flesh as my own, as the meat I
eat is mine.

2 To believe that I am truly and really (though spiritually) united unto him,
and one with him, of his bone, and of his flesh, as the meat I eat becomes one
with my substance.

3 To expect in faith for all grace and growth in good strength in his
services, quickening and comfort, and eternal life from the flesh of Christ: as
the meat I eat maintains life, gives nourishment and enables me for all
natural actions, so does Christ, for spiritual bread strengthens man's heart,
and wine cheares it, so, and more in me does Christ's flesh and blood.

Q. How shall I make this knowledge of Christ effectual, and the knot fast for
ever?

A. 1. By a faithful humble meditating on the grace of Christ, Joh. 6. 43, 44,
45, 55, 56.

2 By an affectionate hearty thanksgiving to God the Father who has blessed me
with all spiritual blessings in Christ, Ephesians. 1. 3.

3 By a fruitful diligent growing in all the graces of the Spirit, Joh. 15. 3.

4 By fervent daily prayer to God the Father through Christ Jesus by the Spirit
to enlighten and lead me to the love of God unto eternal life, Ephesians. 1. 17. and
3. 19. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 5.

. 4.
Q. HOw do you meditate on Christ?

A. I desire to know Christ, not as one far from me, but as one with me, and
I in him, and from him, or rather through my flesh in him, receiving all things
from God the Father for my salvation. This is the meaning of that, Joh. 6. 56.
spoken of before, to eat the flesh of Christ ( i. e.) by faith to apply and
truly to partake of Christ's flesh as mine own, and being out of my self, in it
to have life, and through it to have all things that concern grace and glory.

This is that S. Paul determined to know, only Jesus Christ, and him
crucified, 1 Cor. 2. 2. Gal. 2. 20. for this excellent knowledge S. Paul
counted all things but dung, that he might win Christ; what is that? That I
might be found in him not having mine own righteousness but his, not my
self, but him, Phil. 3. 8, 9, 10.

Q. What do you meditate of in Christ?

A. 1. I find my nature, soul and body united to God in him, and therefore
feel my self reconciled, and at one with God the Father; his Father, my
Father, his God my God, Joh. 14. 20. 21, 23. and 20. 17.

2 I see my nature sanctified perfectly in his person, from which I seek a
power to sanctify mine more and more in my person, Heb. 2. 11. John 17. 10.

3 As he has fulfilled the law for me, so

1 In him God accounts me righteous, Romans 3. 22. 2 Cor. 5. 21.

2 In me God accepts of my upright purpose to please him in all things for
perfect righteousness, Psalm. 119. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

3 From him I receive a power to perform the whole law in every point, though
not perfectly in the highest pitch and purity that the Law requires, yet
(seeking and striving to perfection) pleasingly as God accepts in Christ Jesus;
who fulfilling the Law for me in my flesh, which he took, writes the Law in me
by his Spirit, which he gives, making me to delight ^n the Law of God in the
inward man, to be ready to do his will, to have respect to all his
Commandments, to refrain my feet from every evil way, to purge my self from
all filthiness of flesh and Spirit, perfecting holiness in his fear, Jer. 31.
33. and 32. 40. Heb. 8. 10. Romans 7. 22. Psalm. 40. 8. and 119. 6. 101. 2. 2 Cor.
7. 1 Phil. 3. 12, 13, 14, 15.

4 He has satisfied Gods justice in suffering in my stead, being made a curse
for me, and in his own self bearing my sins in his own body upon the tree; so I
look for

1 Peace in my self from above, being crucified with Christ, Gal. 2. 20

2 Power over sin within, being crucified with Christ in my corrupt nature,
Romans 6. 6.

Christ stood on the Cross as my surety in my stead.

1 As a sinner; for he was made sin for me, 2 Cor. 5. 2.

2 As accursed, for he was made a curse for me, Gal. 3. 13.

So being one with him.

1 As he in my nature is full o^ grace, so out of his fullness I look to
receive grace for grace, Joh. 1. 16. Col. 1. 9. and 2. 3, 9, 10.

2 My best duties are in me damnable, but in Christ Jesus, God and Man, my
Mediator and Master, my person is accepted, and all my actions pleasing, Ephesians.
1. 6.

3 I see my self shut out of Paradise, I have no hope of heaven in my self, a
dead dog, a damned creature, an heir of hell; but God which is rich in mercy,
for his great love wherewith he has loved me when I was dead in sin, has
quickened me together with Christ, and raised me up with him, and made me sit
together in heavenly places with Christ Jesus. So then in Christ I rose, and in
Christ now I reign in heaven being now on earth, ( i. e.) I see by faith my own
nature in Christ sitting at the right hand of God, who is my good and great
high Priest,

In
1 Presenting my person to the Father and making me pleasing unto him, Heb. 4.
14. 2 Perfuming my prayers, and praying for me to his Father, Heb. 7. 25.
Revel. 8. 3, 4. 3 Preparing a place for me, and me for that place by his
Spirit, John 14. 2, 16. Col. 1. 12.
. 5.
Q. What are the blessings that Christ Jesus brings?

A. First, Eternal election to life in his Fathers love, Ephesians. 1. 4.

2 Adoption to become the son of God with himself, Ephesians. 1. 5.

3 Acceptance of my person, and all my actions in him, Ephesians. 1. 6.

4 Redemption of my soul and body by his blood; and justification, whereby I
am fully cleared from Gods judgment, freed from Gods wrath, my sins forgiven,
and I freely accounted as just, Ephesians. 1. 7.

5 Vocation, whereby I am the called of Christ Jesus, Romans 1. 6. in the Gospel,
wherein he has abounded to me in all wisdom and prudence, having made known
unto me the mystery of his will, Ephesians. 1. 8, 9.

6 Eternal salvation, and an immortal inheritance in heaven with all Angels
and Saints that ever were or shall be, Ephesians. 1. 10, 11.

And all this to the praise of the glory of his grace, Ephesians. 1. 6, 12.

. 6.
Q. What are the graces that Christ Jesus gives?

A. 1. Knowledge, Col. 2. 3. to understand,

1 The Word of God and meaning of the Scriptures, Luke 24. 45.

2 The will of God, John 15. 15. and the mind of Christ, 1 Cor. 2. 16.

3 The mysteries, of the kingdom of heaven, Mat. 13. 11.

4 The misery, wretchedness, blindness, poverty, nakedness of my naughty
nature, Rev. 3. 17, 18. Romans 7. 18.

5 The graces of the Spirit in me, and the good things which are freely given
unto me of God through Christ Jesus, 1 Cor. 2. 12.

2 Faith, with the beginning and increase thereof, Mark 9. 24. Luke 17. 5. Ephesians.
2. 8.

3 Repentance with a mourning melting spirit, Acts 5. 31. for every sin in my
self and others by Christ's look on me, Luke 22. 61, 62. and mine on Christ,
Zech. 12. 10.

4 Love to God and men, good and bad, Deuteronomy. 30. 6. Romans 5. 5. 1 These. 4. 9.
Mat. 5. 44.

5 The fear of the Lord God, Ier. 32. 40. This covenant is made in Christ,
Heb. 8. 8. therefore he gives it, working it in me by his Spirit, and warning
me of it by his Word, Luke 12. 5.

6 Hope of my inheritance in heaven, Romans 15. 13. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 16.

7 In a word all other graces springing from the Father, the fountain of
grace, conveied in Christ, through his flesh by his Spirit into my heart, shed
abroad and streaming on to everlasting life, John 4. 14. and 7. 37, 38. Gal. 5.
22, 23, 24.

. 7.
Q. What must you do on your part to continue your communion with God the
Father in Christ Jesus by the Spirit?

A. 1. Generally.

1 Fly for my life every sin open or secret, and every appearance of evil that
may separate between God and me, or make me fail of his grace in Christ, or
grieve his holy Spirit, Esaias 59. 2. Heb. 12. 15. Ephesians. 4. 30.

2 Follow after holiness, and in all holy occasions, company and courses,
commanded by God and commended by good men, continue and increase in all
goodness and all good duties, cleansing my self continually from all
filthiness of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in his fear, 2 Cor. 7. 1.

2 Particularly.

1 I give all diligence always to make my calling and election sure, 2 Pet. 1.
10.

2 Walk humbly with my God hourly, with a reverend awful respect of his
presence, fearing to offend his Majesty in any thing, Mich. 6. 8 Psalm. 139. 2,
3.

3 Renew my repentance daily for my hourly offenses or frailty, confessing
them in particular, and craving pardon, and purging, 1 John 1. 9.

4 I humble my self weekly in fasting for some special sins and daily slips
in his service, or my calling; put aside some hours, if I cannot a whole day,
Mat. 5. 20. and 6. 17.

5 Remember to covenant monthly with my Lord in the Sacrament of the Body and
Blood of Christ Jesus, or as often as it is administered, 1 Cor. 11. 26.

6 Once in the year cast up all my accounts, see how my Communion is
increased, and my corruptions lessened, and how far I am gone and grown in
grace, and in the knowledge of Christ, Lev. 16. 34. Once a year Merchants cast
up their whole accounts, and Husbandmen know their increase of corn and
cattle; So they who are wise Merchants and working Christians, may observe in
themselves a change or increase in a years space, what cannot be so sensibly
perceived in a short time.

7 The Christian Sabbaths and Saints must be my delight, holy and honorable,
when, and with whom I have more opportunity and time to have communion with thy
God, Isa. 58. 13. Psalm. 16. 3.

8 The Word of God must abide and dwell in me richly, wherein I may acquaint my
self with my Masters will, my Fathers love, and communicate both to my fellow
servants and brethren, Col. 3. 16.

9 Take heed of omitting any occasion of doing good, or receiving good in
conference or company with men, or my good duty in public or private before
God, Mal. 3. 16.

10 Beware of careless and customary performance of any holy duty, but do it
in love of Communion with my God, that by every prayer I make, every word I
hear, etc. I may come nearer to him in Christ Jesus, Jer. 48. 10. Psalm. 73. 28.

11 Weane my self from the world, use the world as not using it, entangle not
my self in other men's matters nor mine own, draw heavenly thoughts from earthly
things, deny my self not only in indifferent, but in lawful, yea necessary
things, 1 Cor. 7. 31. and 6. 12.

12 Watch my heart with all diligence, the rising of my lust, the checks of my
conscience, the motions of the Spirit, etc* Pro. 4. 23.

13 Work out my salvation with fear and trembling, striving harder* running
faster, and pressing on to the prize of the high calling of God in Christ
Jesus, Phil. 2. 12. and 3. 14.

14 Observe still my present estate* the tempter of my soul, my spiritual
decays, deadness, dullness, hardness of heart, security, strangeness from
God, I suffer not these to stay long upon me, but stir up my self by
repentance and prayer, and strengthen the things which remain and are ready to
die, Rev. 3. 2, 17. and 2. 4, 5.

15 Go forward in good duties, fruitful in good works, fervent in spirit,
zealous in Gods cause, sensible of the least sin, and above all things beward
of barrenness and backsliding, and an evil heart of unbelief in departing
from the living God, 1 Cor. 15. 58. Col. 1. 10. Romans 12. 11. 1 These. 5. 22.
Heb. 10.

16 Stir up my faith continually, seek to the Lord, strengthen it, study the
promises, apply them perfectly, and in them Christ to thy self, stick very
fast unto the Lord, cleave unto him, cling about him, depart not from him,
depend upon him, delight in him, and be thankful to him, believe and live in
the light of his countenance, and of his Commandments, Isa. 64. 7. 2 Timothy 1.
6. 1 Pet. 1. 13. Act. 11. 23.

17 In my nearest approaches, and dearest embraces by him, I am not too bold,
but in my strongest feelings, sweetest refreshments, spiritual consolations in
Christ, comforts of the spirit, joy in Gods face and favor, I fear and
tremble before him, Psalm. 2 11. 1 Pet. 1. 17.

18 Fear the Lord my God all my days, a fear not of distrust but of
diligence to work, and jealousy to watch my self, a fear not servile only of
his justice, but sonnelike of his goodness, a fear not to drive me from God,
but to draw me to him; we cannot believe or love the Lord too much, but yet
God does not cocker his children, therefore when thou most beleeves^ that thou
lie in the arms of his love, fear the more, lest then thou fall asleep,
secure and sweetly sin: Satan seeks but this, to find thee thus, he cares not
then, but rocks, sits by, and sings, and keeps thee fast asleep, with the sweet
sound of faith and assurance Pro. 28. 14.

Oh the slights of Satan, the methods, mysteries, and depths of the Devil, in
our nearest communion with God to cast us farthest from him!

19 Continue constant in prayer, watching thereunto with all perseverance,
present my self often before the Lord upon my knees, in my Closet, or some
corner, if it be but a word or two, 'twill increase my acquaintance and my
communion with him; have my heart ever upward, heavenly and humble, sending up
sometimes strong groans, sudden sighs, short ejaculations, petitions or
praises in the midst of worldly affairs, callings and company, etc. when they
think not of it, steal a secret thought to the throne of grace, and my Father
which sees in secret, etc. Luke 18. 1. Ephesians. 6. 18. Col. 4. 2. 1 Pet. 4. 7.
Neh. 2. 4.

. 8.
Q. What should you especially pray for?

A. 1 That the God of our Lord jesus Christ, the Father of glory may give unto
me the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; The eye of my
understanding being enlightened, that I may know what is the hope of his
calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints: And
what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward, who believes according
to the working of his mighty power.

In
1 pardoning all my sins against him, Number. 14. 17. 2 Subduing the power of
every sin in me, Mich. 7. 19. 3 Sanctifying me more and more in spirit, soul,
and body blameless, 1 These. 5. 23. 4 Strengthening me in all hi^ services,
Isa. 40. 29. 5 Supporting me in all my sufferings, faintings, fears, Isa. 41.
1^ 6 Supplying all my wants exceeding abundantly above all tha^ I can ask or
think, Ephesians. 3. 20. 7 Saving me to the uttermo^^ from all evil, Heb. 7. 25. 8
Preserving me to salvation, tha^ I fall not from good, 1 Pet. 1. 5* 9
Presenting me faultlesse before his glorious presence with joy, Jude 24. 10
Raising me at the last day, and changing my vile body that it may be like unto
his glorious Body, according to his mighty working, etc. Phil. 3. 21.
Which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead, and set him at
his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and
power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this
world, but also in that which is to come: And has put all things under his
feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church; which is his
Body, the fullness of him that fills all in all, Ephesians. 1. 17, 18, etc.

2 That God would grant me according to the riches of his glory, to be
strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell
in my heart by faith, that being rooted and grounded in love, I may be able to
comprehend with all Saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and
height: And to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, that I may be
filled with all the fullness of God, Ephesians. 3. 16, 17, 18.

1 The fullness of the knowledge of his Will, Col. 1. 9.

2 The full assurance of his favor, Col. 2. 2.

3 The fullness of all grace in Christ Jesus.

4 The fullness of all joy in the holy Ghost, unspeakeable and glorious, not
only in the feelings of faith, but of afflictions, 1 Pet. 1. 6, 8. Romans 5. 3.

5 The fullness of glory in his haevenly kingdom at his right hand, when he
sits to intercede for me and his whole mystical body, to reign in us his
members, and over his and our enemies, till the last day, when he shall deliver
up the kingdom to God the Father, 1 Cor. 15. 28. Then God shall be all in all,
when we shall be filled with the fullness of God, and see him face to face.
Now we see God the Father mediately in the face of Christ, then we shall see him
immediately face to face with Christ: yet without a Mediator; now we are filled
with the fullness of Christ only, then we shall be filled with the fullness of
God alone.

1 We are the fullness of Christ who being his members, he accounts himself
but maimed without us, Ephesians. 1. 23 1 Cor. 12. 12.

2 We have the fullness of God, in Christ, who being our head, supplies by his
Spirit all things unto us, that can be had in God the Father, or from him, what
ever can make us: 1 Holy in him here, 2 Happy with him hereafter.
Ephe. 3. 19. 1 John 1. 3.


Now unto him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or
think, according to the power that works in us: unto him be glory in the
Church by Christ Jesus, throughout all ages, world without end, Amen, Ephesians. 3.
20, 21.

In him (that is Christ) we actually are by our actual incorporation into that
society which has him for their head, and does make together with him one body
(he and they in that respect having one name, 1 Cor. 12. 12.) for which cause
by virtue of this mystical conjunction, we are of him and in him, even as
though our flesh and bones should be made continuate with his. Hooker page 123.

Ergo gratulemur and agamus gratias, non solumnos Christianos factos esse, sed
etiam Christum. Intelligitis, fratres, gratiam Dei super nos; capitis,
admiramini, gaudete. Christus facti sumus; Si enim ille caput est, and nos
membra, totus ille homo and nos. August. in Johan. tract. 31. Let us rejoice
and give thanks, that we are not only made Christian men, but also made
Christ's Brethren; ye understand the grace of God, that is upon us; ye
understand it, ye wonder at it. Rejoice ye, we are made Christ. For if he be
the head and we the members, both he and we are one whole man.

The Mystery of JESUS CHRIST, Emmanuel GOD with us.
The Mystery of Incarnation.
God with us: receiving us into himself, uniting our nature with his into the
person of his Son, Mat. 1. 23. Ioh. 1. 14. Heb. 2. 16. 1 Timothy 3. 16.

God with us.
The Mystery of Reconciliation.
God with us: reconciling us unto himself, accepting our persons, not imputing
our sins by the blood of his Son, 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19.

God in Christ.
The Mystery of Regeneration.
God with us: renewing our natures to be like himself, partakers of the
divine nature, changing us into his own Image by the Spirit of his Son, Col.
1. 27, 28. 2 Cor. 3. 18. 2 Pet. 1. 4.

Christ in us.
The Mystery of mystical Union.
God with us: uniting our persons to his Son by his Spirit and our faith,
whereby we are members of Christ's body, of his bone, and of his flesh, which we
feed on, finding life, grace, and spiritual strength, conveyed through it by
the Spirit from God the Father, Ephesians. 5. 30, 32. Ioh. 6. 56, 60.

We in Christ.
The Mystery of the Gospel.
God with us: who were without God, without Christ, without hope or mercy, no
people, strangers from the Commonweal of Israel, and covenant of promise,
enemies of God, children of his wrath, in the power of the Devil, sitting in
darkness and shadow of death, dead in sins, and the damnation of hell, at that
time we were thus, being Gentiles, till Christ came in the flesh: and at this
time we are thus, being as Gentiles, till our effectual Calling by Christ's
Spirit, Ephesians. 2. 12. and 3. 3, 5.

We with Israel.
The Mystery of the first Resurrection.
God with us: in calling home his old people Israel (who are now as we were)
into one Church with us to confess, profess and praise Christ Jesus our Lord,
together on earth, Romans 11. 25. The Jews restoring a resurrection, Romans 11.
15. (that is) the first resurrection, Rev. 20. 5, 6.

Israel with us.
The Mystery of the second Resurrection.
God with us: In calling us all up by the sound of a Trump, at the second
coming of Christ, changing our bodies and carrying us up both body and soul
to meet the Lord Jesus in the air, where and when the whole Church militant
and triumphant, the family in heaven and earth, both Jew and Gentile, and all
the Israel of God shall meet at once, and so we shall ever be with the Lord,
1 Cor. 15. 51. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 17.

All Israel, and we with God.
The first Mystery was God with us, The last Mystery shall be, we with God,
And God All in All. 1 Cor. 15. 28. Though I understand all Mysteries, and have
not love, I am nothing, 1 Cor 13.


A plain trial by the Word of God of Man's spiritual estate whether he be in
Christ Jesus, or no.
In The state of Nature-Damnation -- or In The state of grace -- Salvation.
Flesh. Spirit. 1 There is therefore now no condemnation to -- -- them that are
in Christ Jesus. Who walk not after the flesh -- -- but after the Spirit, Romans
8. 1. They that are after the flesh do mind the things of flesh. -- But they
that are after the Spirit, mind the things of the Spirit, v. 5. The carnal
mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject unto the Law of God, neither
in deed can be: so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God, ver. 7,
8. But to be spiritually minded, is life and peace, v. 6. but ye are not in
the flesh, but the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you; but
if any have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his, v. 9. Now then
Brethren we are debtors not to the flesh, to live after the flesh, but yet if
ye live after the flesh, ye shall die, ver. 12. But if through the Spirit ye
mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live, v. 13. Now the works of the
flesh are manifest, which are adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulation, wrath,
strife, seditions, heresies, resies, envyings, murders, drunkenness,
revellings, and such like; of which I tell you before, as I have told you in
time past, that they which do such shall not inherit the kingdom of God, Gal.
5. 19, 20, 21. But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, against such there is no
law; and they that are CHRIST'S have crucified the flesh, with the affections
and lusts thereof.

If we live in the Spirit, let us walk in the Spirit, Galat. 5. 22, 23, 24, 25.

2 If any man be -- in Christ, he is a new creature -- Old things are passed
away, -- -- All things are become new, 2 Cor. 5. 17. If we say we have
fellowship with with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, 1 John 1. 6, 7. He
that says he abides in him, ought himself also to walk, as he walked, 1
Ioh. 2. 7. He that says I know him, and keeps not his Commandments, is a
liar 1 John 2. 4. But who so keeps his word, in him verily is the love of God
perfected: hereby know we that we are in him, 1 Ioh. 2. 5. He that commits
sin, is of the Devil, 1 John 3. 8. Whosoever abides in him, sins not, 1
Ioh. 3. 6. Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of your father ye
will do, he also is a liar, Joh. 8. 44. Whosoever is borne of God, does not
commit sin, for his seed remains in him, so that he cannot sin, because he is
borne of God, 1 Ioh. 3. 9. Caine was of the wicked one, and slew his brother;
and wherefore slew he him? because his own works were evil, and his brothers
good, 1 John 3. 12. Marvel not my brethren if the world hate you. We know we
have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren, 1 Ioh. 3. 13. The
wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God, upon the
sinners, he will rain snares, fire, and brimstone, storm and tempest; this
shall be their portion for ever, Psalm. 9. 17. and 11. 6. Blessed are they that
do his Commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, (Christ
Jesus our Lord) and enter in through the gates of the City, Ioh. 20. 14. The
hypocrites hope shall perish, and the eyes of the wicked shall fail, their
hope shall be as the giving up of the Ghost, John. 8. 13. and 11. 20. But the
righteous has hope in his death; and he that has the hope purifyeth himself
as he is pure, Pro. 24. 32. 1 John 3. 3. 3 Shall I take the members of Christ,
and make -- -- them the members of an Harlot? God forbid, 1 Cor. 6. 15. Shall I
take the tongue of Christ and make it -- -- The tongue of a swearer? etc. Psalm.
12. 4. Mat. 5. 37. He that yields any one of his members to -- -- Sin, is no
member of Christ Jesus, but -- -- a limb of the Devil, of the mystery of
iniquity, -- -- and has no part in the Mystical union of Christ and his
Church, Romans 6, 13. 14.

FINIS.
