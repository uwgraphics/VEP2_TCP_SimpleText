A balade against malycyous Sclaunderers.
Heue and how rumbelow thou art to blame
Trolle into the right way again for shame.

TRolle into the way / trolle in and retrolle
Small charity and less wit is in thy nolle
Thus for to rail upon a christen soul
Wherefore men think the worthy blame
Trolle into the way again for shame.
Thou make a trollyng hither and thither
Sometime thou trollest thou can not tell whyther
But if all thy trollynges were gathered together
Thy trollynge might trym the and turn the to blame
Wherefore trolle thou now into the way for shame
Although lord Crumwell a traitor was
yet dare I say that the king of his grace
Has forgyuen him that great trespass
To tail than on dead men / thou art to blame
Trolle now into the way again for shame.
In that that he the law has offended
By the law he is justly condemned
This mortal life / full godly he ended
Wherefore to rail thus / thou art to blame
Trolle into the way again for shame.
For all his offenses in every thing
He asked god mercy and grace of the king
And of all the wide world / for his tra^sgressyng
Thou nor no man can say nay to the same
Trolle into the way than again for shame
Thou take his treason for thy subtle defense
Which now is departed and gone from hence
But men spy the prick of all thy pretense
Thy own sayenges following declare the same
Trolle into the way / for fere or for shame
Thou say he was with the church to quycke
Fauouryng none but of the new trycke
But now thou spurnest against the prycke
And thou of force / must confess the same
Trolle into the way again for shame
For bishops have now as they have had
If priests would complain / they were to mad
Wherefore thou apperest to be a popysshe lad
For vsyng thy popery / thou art to blame
Trolle into the way again for shame.
For here thou vpholdest both monks and friars
Nuns and noughty packes / and lewed lowsy liars
The bishop of Rome / with all his rotten squyers
To build such a church / thou art much to blame
Trolle now into the way again for shame.
May not men think now in the mean ceason
That thou have deserved by right and by reason
As much as he has done for clokynge thy treason
For he was a traitor / and thou art the same
Trolle away papyst / god give the shame.
The sacrament of the altar / that is most highest
Crumwell believed it to be the very body of Chriest
Wherefore in thy writing / on him thou lie
For the king and his counsel will witness the same
Trolle into the way / than again for shame
Although that he of birth were but bace
yet was he set up of the kings noble grace
Whereby it appears that thou would deface
The kings royal power / dispysyng the same
Trolle away traitor / god give the shame.
Is it thy facyon thus craftily to say?
Let us for the king / and his lords pray
And than at the last / to trolle them away
With heue and how rumbelow / thy words be the same
Both written and printed / to thy great shame?
Have thou no man else / thou dronken soll
But the king and his nobles / away for to troll
It were enough for to cost the thy poll
Both thine and all other / that would do the same
Trolle away traytoure / god give the shame.
A pretty wise printer belyke he was
Which of his printyng / so little does pas
To print such pylde poetry / as this same was
Like maker / like printer / two trolles of the game
A pair of good papystes / ye be pain of shame
God send all traitors their hole desa^tes
God send small toye / to all popysshe hearts
And evil hap to as many as do take their parts
God send their purpose never to frame
But trolle them away with sorrow and shame.
I pray god thou be not fownde one of those
That peruarteth the people / as I suppose
From redyng of gods word / that goodly rose
Where the counsel commands to occupy the same
Thou traitor allurest them this fair flower to defame.
God preserve and keep the kings noble grace
With prince Edward his son / to succeed in his place
God keep them among us / long time and space
Let all his true subjects / say Amen to the same
And they that would otherwise / god send them shame.
Finis.
