A brief and short Treatise, CALLED THE CHRISTIANS PILGRIMAGE TO HIS FATHERLAND.

SHOWS The troubles that he shall meet withal in passing this World as a
wilderness, to the Heavenly Canaan, which is the true Christians Fatherland.

By THOMAS ODELL Englishman.

At AMSTERDAM, Printed by John Fredericksz Stam, dwelling by the South-Church
at the sign of the HOPE. Anno M D C XXXV.

To the right honorable and virtuous Queen ELYZABETH,
All grace, peace and comfort from God the Father of mercy, through Jesus
Christ our loving Lord and Savior be multiplied unto you, and so lead your
Majesty by his H. Spirit through this world, as a woeful wilderness, and bring
your Highness at the last into his Heavenly Canaan, which is the daily desire of
your Majesty's poor petitioner THOMAS ODELL Englishman.

HAving hard and minded the manifold trials and troubles, wherein the Lord has
exercise your Majesty, I have ofttimes purposed some part of my poor labor,
to present unto your Lord and King (now at rest) but I was oftentimes hindered
in things concerning myself, and most of all through the grieveous afflictions
that befell your Majesty. Your Highness with many other may think it strange,
that one so bace should be so bold or presume to present any thing to your
Highness hands, wanting learning, which thing I willingly confess, for he that
gives out his best tallents, gives to one five, to another two, and to
another one, and yet may not that one be buried, but brought to the bank to
the Lord, and owners praise, and good of whomsoever it shall him please. I
minding these things, and withal your Majesty's lowly and lovely behavior
toward our countrymen or women of mean estate, have been emboldened now at
the last to present unto your Highness this small Treatise, showing unto all,
that the life of a true Christian, is no other then a Pilgrimage through this
wilderness unto our Heavenly Canaan. And these things have I written in sundry
parts, first for such which through the great strife and contention in these
days are forced to run too and froe, seeking the truth. Secondly the
Pilgrimage of Abraham and Sarah, our faithful parents, and other of bace
estate: Also of Hester, with her Uncle Mordicai. And lastly some part of the
work of our loving Lord and Savior Christ Jesus in his Pilgrimage, to work
out our Redemption. These things have I brought forth according to the grace of
God, given unto me, and acknowledging that my sight but dark, and my knowledge
but in part, I do humbly entreat your Majesty, and each Godly Reader, through
Christian love, to bear with my weakness herein, and so commit the issue to the
Almighty, who preserve your Majesty's person from all your enemies, secret or
open, strengthen you in all cumbats inward and outward to the end; and then
give your Highness a Crown of glory in Heaven for ever and ever, Amen. So let
it be, o Lord.

A Pilgrams Meditation, to let each understand, The Christians Pilgrimation unto
his Fatherland.
Christ makes declaration
For such as seek salvation,
Them counsel does aford,
Wills them make meditation,
Their prayers preparation,
By searching in his word,
Which is a light, will guide them right,
Christ putting too his hand,
Will hold them fast, so they at last
Shall find their Fatherland.
WHo now will take for his souls sake
This journey for to go,
To him we say, first learn the way,
The Scripture teaches so.
Thus says the Lord search in my word
There thou the way shall find,
Seek him with heart, he will impart,
And let thee know his mind.
The Lord did tell to Daniell
That in this latter day,
Many should go both too and froe,
And ask after the way.
And how some wife should them advise,
Lead them in righteousness,
And that the Lord would such reward,
Yea them for ever bless.
Christ does relate straight is the gate
And narrow is the way,
In which regard bids us strife hard
Without shall many stay.
Take head to all that will the call,
And say come go with me,
The way I know and many more,
The way is fair and free.
I know it well and can thee tell
From place to place throughout,
Leave of to read common with speed
There is no fear or doubt.
But go thou on let them alone,
Dispute not with such men,
Whose words are fair, yet like a snare
To draw the back again.
For many preach and others teach,
Yet they themselves are blind,
Puffed up with pride, and cannot guide
Which many thousands find.
But take thou head, the Scripture read,
Then God will be thy guide,
Sease not to pray both night and day,
So shall thy foot not flyde.
Faith, hope and love from God above
See that thou take with thee,
Seek them with heart, he will impart,
For God is kind and free.
What father is so hard to his
Children, that ask him bread,
To give a stone, we see each one
Would have his children feed.
Much more the Lord his Spirit aford
To such as ask in faith,
It is the word that Christ our Lord
Unto his servants says.
These gifts of grace where the take place
The Lord does well approove,
Amongst them all she principal
Is faith that works by love.
Faith, hope and love are from above
And may not be divided,
Faith does unfold, hope takes hold,
When both by love are guyded.
When man once has obtained faith,
He is like ship forth sailing
Upon the seas in storms always,
His currage often quayling.
When storms arise, then faith outcryes
And will not leave of sounding,
Till he can say, hope make a stay
For here is sure grounding.
Then hope in haste will anchor cast,
Where faith has found abiding,
And keep the ship from sand and clip,
So long as it lies riding.
When storms are paste, then in all haste
The anchor up is taken,
Faith will not fail, but hoyst the sail,
And weight till winds do waken.
Then sails he forth, east, west, south, north,
As God shall give direction,
By rocks and sands, by fearful lands,
Still finding Gods protection.
Though God thus bless, give good succes,
Thy faith yet will he try,
But all for good, well understood,
Though often he make the cry.
Yea when storms rise in fearful wise,
And make thee pray with weeping,
Thou shall descerne, Christ at the stern,
Who then will not be sleeping.
But up will stand, the winds command
And cease to cease their swelling,
Which must obey, without delay,
Against him is no rebelling.
Then gone is fear the Heaven near,
Where thou shall make thy stay,
In Fatherland at his right hand,
To live with him for aye.
Thus much for all in general,
But now to you, O Queen,
We shall relate those of hie state,
Which here have Pilgrams been.
As Paul does write and eke resight,
The greater sort of old,
From age to age, their Pilgrimage
Unto the Jews unfould.
He brings a train in golden chain,
The lovely Patriarchs,
Which did by faith, as there he says,
Great things, well he that marks.
This work begun he does anon
In order set them down,
As Abell, Enoch, also Noah
Three men of great renown.
But here we shall not speak of all,
Though the were men of worth,
In other place, we touch there case,
But here we chose on forth.
A faithful man, whose life now can
Learn us, if we take head,
And have good care, because we are
Accounted for his seed.
For Paul he says, that we by faith,
Are Abrams children,
And if that we his children be,
So are we Pilgrams then.
If we refuse, we do abuse,
Christ Jesus in his word,
Who tells us this, the servant is,
Not better then his Lord.
This Abraham meek as a lam,
When God did call him forth,
Left friends and land, and took in hand
A journey of great worth.
A Covenant the Lord did grant
To him and his for ever,
Who lived upright in his Gods sight,
Who also fayld him never.
To Canaan this faithful man
With wife and Loath came thither,
And ran his raze from place to place
This said he knew not whether.
For God did try him presently,
Sent famine in the Land,
And then must he to Egypt flee,
Yet found Gods helping hand.
In Egypt there he lived in fear,
Through bewty of his wife,
He feared sore that some therefore
Would take away his life.
Then Abram sought away he thought
Would take away this fear,
He said to all, both great and small
That she his sister wear.
When as the King, had heard this thing
Took Sara into cort,
But God therefore did plage him sore
That small was his comfort.
Sent them away without delay
From Egypt the must part,
To Canaan and there anan,
He tasted this like smart.
He said like thing unto the King
Abimelech by name,
Who took her then from him again,
Yet God did help the same.
The Lord him loved this King reproud,
Who gave him her again,
So strife did cease, and he had peace,
Which did not long remain.
He labored soore, diged wels store
In that his time of rest,
This Kings heardme^ strove with him then
And took away the best.
But Abram would not that it should
Continue in their hand,
He that redeems for that it seems
It was the best in land.
He loved dear, that water clear,
And held it all his life,
Gave it a name, fit for the same
Called it the well of strife.
These trials hear kept him in fear,
Yet were they not quiet done,
The great'st of all did him befall,
When as he had a son.
Which must be tayne, and also slain,
And offered to the Lord,
For sacrifice Abram likewise
Did straight obey his word.
He took Isaac, laid on his back
The wood to make the fire,
The Altar make the wood up laid
Then Isaac did inquire;
Now for the lamb. And Abraham
Said, God would it provide,
Laid him thereon, and thereupon
Ae Angel to him cryde.
When he did stand with knyffe in hand
To slay his only son,
With words so mild, kill not thy child,
This work was now near done.
Looking aside a Ram he spyde
And that he offered there,
Thus God did prove his faith and love,
And bleste him every where.
The Lord was nigh and stood him by,
And did increase his strenght,
That he went forth as man of worth,
And won the pryse at lenght.
For why truly he looked hie,
He sought a city fair,
Built by the Lord, who did aford
It him, who now is there.
Whose children all, both great and small
Which seek the things are best,
Their time well spend, shall in the end
Therein his bosom rest.
Though Sara weak, God would not break,
The Covenant he made,
Gave her Isaac, of whom we spoke,
Which was a lively shade.
For she at lenght, by faith got strenght
Concev'd and bare this son,
By faith alone, all sins were gone
By faith this prise she won.
Gods promis made, gave his faith aid
Where to she had an eye,
Who made her seed, as we may read
Like stars upon the sky.
Her Daughters all, that follow shall
Her lowelynes in life,
Made her man Lord, in deed and word,
Although she were his wife.
Who loved her dear, yet Godly fear
Made her him reverence,
I do not fear, the faithful hear
At this will take offense.
Humility exalts hie,
Be it with great or small,
When such as pride do make their guide
At lenght shall cache a fall.
Those parents blessed are at their rest,
That ran a Godly race,
Now shall we know how God also
Did high exalt the base.
Rahab may not be quite forgot
Who did receve the spies,
Though she seemed light by faith upright
Found favor in Gods eyes.
She dwelt we know in Iereco,
Which was a sinful city,
These spies came there in deadly fear,
And she on them had pity.
She heard each day that Joshua
Was come to take the land,
And did believe that God would give
The same into his hand.
These spies were sought, but she so wroght,
That thee preserved were,
Who let her prove their faith and love
Which took away her fear.
A token they gave her that day,
To hang over the wall,
Her house thereby did stand firmly,
When all the rest did fall.
And Joshua to spies did say
Perform your promis made,
Who brought her thence with her parents
And friends under her shade.
After we read of Iudahs seed,
One took her to his wife,
And through the same Christ Jesus came
Which is the Lord of life.
Let all learn here that live in fear,
To love and logde such spies,
Which now do preach, and them ca teach
And set before their eyes.
Their woeful case in such a place,
Where soul can have no rest,
And so them bring to Christ their King,
Where they shall both be bleft.
Here follows the trials of Queen
Hester, with her Uncle Mordicai,
that captive in Babylon, and how the
Lord did highly exalt them.
HEre shall we find, how Hester kind
With her friend Mordicai,
God turned their grief into relief,
Their sorrows into joy.
We find it thus, King Assurus
Did make a royal feast,
Which lasted long, his love was strong,
And stretched to the least.
Upon a day in Royal ray,
He for Queen Vasta sent,
That each might see the Queen bewte,
But she would not consent.
Wherefore the King, about this thing,
Took counsel of his wise,
Who told him hence a great offense
Might to them all arise.
Their wifes might say, shall we obey,
Queen Vasta has denied,
Thus shall each man be vexed than,
His wife will him deryde.
These wise then said, seek for a maid
Throughout your Kingdoms all,
And let your grace give her the place,
Which did to Hester fall.
For she was fair, had godly care,
For which the Lord her blessed,
That she found grace for the Kings face,
And Vastas room possessed.
She brought to light all Hamans spite,
That would the Jews destroy,
The ground of this envy of his
He took srom Mordicai.
Who did resort, and sat in port
Of King Assurus place,
And safte his life from men of strife,
Who afterward found grace.
This Hamans head was exalted,
And lified up so hie,
All charged now to bend and bow,
When as he past them by.
But Mordicai would not obey,
No honor he would give
To Haggagite an hypocrite,
So long as he did live.
He knew indeed of wicked seed,
This Haman up was sprung,
For he no doubt typed one out,
Whose days will not be long.
Then he abused, and sore accused
The Jews before the King,
Charging them hie with treachery,
And so obtayn'd this thing.
This King then sent incontenent
Throughout his Kingdoms all,
By such a day to take away,
Their lives and spoil them all.
Then Mordicai did fast and pray,
And rent his clothes likewise,
He put a sack upon his back,
Made many bitter cries.
With grief he goes does this disclose
To Hester contenent,
And gave her charge with speeches large,
Where to her ear she lent.
For thus said he think not to be
At rest or save thy life,
Seek to the King about this thing,
To take away the strife.
It may be thought, that God has brought
Thy here unto this place,
Herein to use, and save the Jews,
In this their woeful case.
Hester did say to Mordicay,
Command the Jews said she,
Three days to fast, no food to taste,
And likewise pray for me.
She was in fear, none might com near
Till he had for them sent,
Yet live or dye, now go will I,
And to the Court she went.
She found time fit, the King did sit
Upon his Royal seat,
Which Scepter by did Hester spy,
On whom his love was great.
Held Scepter out, then gone was doubt
On Scepter she took hold,
Though he sat hie, spoke lovingly,
His words made Hester bold.
Now free from fear she drew him near,
Who asked her intent,
What she did crave or sought to have,
He would there to consent.
She prayed the King with him to bring
This Haman to her feast,
This feast she made was but a shade
To cover her unrest.
The night before this King was sore
Trouble no rest could take,
Sore was he tried on every side,
The Lord kept him awake.
For God would not have that forgot,
Which should preserve the Jews,
Put in his mind, this way to find,
His time that night to use.
He made with speed men for to read,
Things that recorded were,
In reading they found Mordicai,
That loved the King so dear.
And sav'th his life from men of strife,
And yet had no reward,
But now the King did mind the thing,
And that with good regard.
Went to the feast which then was dressed
But Haman was not there,
For he did lurk had other work,
A gallos did prepare.
For Mordicay and would that day
Have hanged him thereon,
The King knew not this wicked plot,
And sent for him anon.
The King did than ask of Haman
His counsel in a case,
What he should do to that man who
He minded for to grace.
Haman him told things manyfold,
Which fear we need not name,
His mind was hie, though who but I,
Which turned to his shame.
Then said the King perform each thing
On Mordicai the Jew,
This like a dart in Hamans heart
His currage overthrew.
Then Mordicay he did array
In Kingly clothing fair,
On Kings horse he must mounted be
Led through the city there.
With crown on head a great man led
His horse from place to place,
And all the way, this must he say,
Thus does the King him grace.
And honor so that he may go,
Esteemed of all men,
This being done, they go each one
Unto his place again.
And so that day came Mordicay
Again to the Kings port,
And Haman went told this event
His friends in woeful sort.
His wife she resh did not refresh,
Or comfort him at all,
His words she heard, and for reward
Did prophecy his fall.
This King then sent incontenent,
For Haman to the feast,
This hearing than he came anan
His banquet now was dressed.
Whereat the King did ask what thing
It was that Hester sought,
Were it half his she should not mis
See here what love had wroght.
For to be short in humble sort,
She asked but her life,
And of the Jews which made him muse,
Lo here begun the strife.
She did unfold, said we are sold,
To be destroyed all,
But had it been for servants then,
My suite I had let fall.
The King said than, were is the man
That does presume so hie,
Then answ'red she Haman is he,
That sits the King so nigh.
The King was wroth, stood up went forth,
But Haman begged grace,
Of Hester kind, but none could find,
He now had run his race.
He sat upon, or leaned on
The bank where Hester sat,
The King came in, then did begin
His heart to rise thereat.
Who said likewise before mine eyes
Will he now force the Queen,
Therewith came in his chamberlin,
And told what he had seen.
After the Pallas stood a gallos,
That was exceeding hie,
Hamans invent, whereon he meant
To hang up Mordicai.
But God the Lord would not aford,
That it should come to pas,
But let the King Haman to bring,
Who thereon hanged was.
Queen Hester then, begun attain
With meeknes and with tears,
Sought of the King, that he would bring,
The Iewcs out of their fears.
Who letters sent incontenent
Performed her request,
For break did he that treachery,
So that the Jews had rest.
House of Haman the King gave than
To Hester that same day,
Took Hamans ring a costly thing,
And gave it Mordicai.
The words of one called Salamon
May here be seen of all,
Humility shall mount up hie.
When pride shall have a fall.
O worthy Queen, here have you seen
Queen Hesters Pilgrimage,
With great and small, so goes it all,
And has from age to age.
There are none free, if that they be
Children of Abraham,
By says in Christ, Son of the hiest,
That meek and lovely lamb.
Who for our sake did undertake
A Pilgrimage on earth,
Pay Adams debt, and us does set,
In favor by new birth.
He us outsought, and dearly bought,
We now are not our own,
He will us prove, how we him love
Who has his love thus shown.
What had we in all dead in sin,
Whence did this love arise,
He loved us first, that were acurst,
And so his enemies.
O love of loves, well he that prooves
And yields him love again,
Counts worlds love los, and like to dross,
So he may Christ attain.
Who with words meek, wills us to seek
His Kingdom first of all,
And righteousness for to possesses
The other things he shall
Give us indeed, as we have need,
And that from day to day,
He faithful is, and will do this,
To all that him obey.
True faith this day is in decay,
The most seek worldly wealth,
Stryving for it, their souls forget,
Seek not Gods saving health.
Yet he has thus forbidden us,
Our treasure here to lay,
Where rust or mot, may cause it rot,
Or thieves may take away.
Lay it with love in Heaven above,
From thence it shall not part,
It cannot mis, where treasure is,
There also is the heart.
Paul does confess, that Godlynes
It is the greatest gain,
If we consent therewith content,
For that shall still remain.
When other stufe more then I n'ofe,
Shall vanish in the wind,
And they no rest, that had possessed,
Such things as made them blind.
The Apostle Paul took view of all
Such things he had before,
Put them to flight, set his delight
In Christ that gave him more.
Of heavenly wealth, for his souls health,
And for good of us all,
In his work we may read and see,
His trials were not small.
His Pilgrimage unto old age,
No fear could cast him down,
For his reward, Christ had prepared
In Heaven for him a Crown.
Not him alone, but for each one
That run his race throughout,
Shall have likewise a Crown for prise,
Their is no fear or doubt.
This Crown for prise in Heaven it lies
Under the Fathers hand,
This find we may, Christ is the way
Unto our Fatherland.
Thus does he say, I am the way,
The truth and life also,
And that no man without me can
Unto the Father go.
Which shows that we by nature be
But things of little worth,
For dead in sin, we must begin,
To seek a second birth.
His Kingdom we else cannot see,
Muchles the same inherit,
Except we then be borne again
Of water and of Spirit.
Which if we seek with prayers meek
And with a lively faith,
He will it give, that we may live,
For it is our souls breath.
Which will us guide on every side,
If we there to give ear,
And at the last, will set us fast,
And learn us Godly fear.
Such fear as this beginning is,
Of wisdom from above,
Which has too by for company
A lively faith with love.
If other fear, do come us near,
It stands us in stead,
It lights the mind, this shall we find,
When we the Scripture read.
It stands us by, helps memory,
And brings lost things to light,
It will give strenght, so at the lenght
False fears must take their flight.
This gift of Christ, it is the hiest,
Which he had promised,
From Heaven to sent, unto the ent,
We thereby might be led.
In his Gospel, and knew him well,
And his Kingdom also,
For want of this, many of his
Did him not rightly know.
His work then done, had overwon
The Devil, Hell and Death,
He came again, to these weak men,
And breathed on them breath.
Then did he call, and bad them all,
Receve the holy Ghost,
And so by it, he made them fit,
Whieh gift he never lost.
This comforter exceeds farrs
All comforts in the earth,
Then must we read, and take good head,
We lose not this new birth.
Though much it cost, yet may be lost,
Which hear we shall make known,
This Spirit is sent, and is but lent,
And that to help our own.
The Law does Paull a shadow call,
Whose substance was in Christ,
Isaac no doubt, typed him cut,
Which was one of the hiest.
Rabecka she then hear must be
A shadow of great worth,
In whose womb we do read and see
Too stryved for the birth.
Esaw came first, allthough the worst,
The birthright yet he got,
Jacob came last, held his heel fast,
And after has his lot.
Esaw did hunte, made light account,
His birthright quickly sold,
For cup of porrige, that could his currage,
And made his heart full cold.
The birthright gone, blessing was none
His heritage was lost,
Jacob was blessed, he dispossessed
In Edom live he must.
The like succes through carelesnes,
Befell unto King Saull,
The Lord did send, him to this end,
To slay the Mallachits all.
The King he spard, had no regard,
But sought to blind Gods eyes,
Some beasts he brought, to please he thought
God with a sacrifice.
But all this cost was labor lost,
God took from him that day,
The spirit of grace, and in the place
Sent one did him dismay.
As then with Saull, so now with all,
That do his laws abuse,
This thing does here learn all to fear,
And it a right to use.
The Lord is hie, judges justly
No person does respect,
Both great and small, this find they shall
Which do his laws neglect.
Yet has regard and does reward
As each deserved has,
Some through weakness his laws transgress,
Yet saves them by faith.
When they repent their sins lament,
And call to him for grace,
He will draw near, their prayers hear,
And help them in this case.
Thus do will he, that all may see
Him merciful and kind,
And will not break, a reed so weak
But rather it upbinde.
Nor quench with strokes, the flex that smokes,
But rather maks it burn,
No pleasure has in sinners death,
But seeks his return.
He does not like to Moses strike,
Saying fulfill the Law,
That done has he, and yet must we
Still learn to live in awe.
Law does relate, shows us our state
In sin against the hiest,
Are gone too far, like scolemaster,
It brings us back to Christ.
Then must we learn, for to descerne,
In what estate we stand,
Then if we see we laden be,
Christ holds out his hand.
Calls us anon, bids us put on
His yoke that easy is,
Which quicken will, and our hearts fill
With peace and joy of his.
Does us advise and learn likewise,
He lowly is in heart,
Which brings us rest, that is the best,
And eases all our smart.
Yet are not we, now quite set free,
We must take up our cross,
It under go, both too and froe,
And count worlds pleasure lose.
Nor yet must we compelled be
Like Simon of Syreen,
Christ bare the smart, this after part,
Is for Gods childeren.
To flesh and blood, this seems not good,
But flesh must bear no sway,
To fleshly lust we may not trust,
The Spirit must be our stay.
The flesh is rude, the Spirit renewde
Must guide us to the end,
If we be feed, and thereby leed,
Then shall we not offend.
It will us guide on every side,
If we thereto give ear,
And at the last, will set us fast,
And free us from all fear.
It will us bring to Christ our King,
At his appointed day,
Int' Fatherland, at his right hand
To live with him for aye.
FINIS.
