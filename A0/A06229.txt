City of London, before the right honorable the Lord Mayor of the same City,

same Common Counsel assembled, on the Ninth day of this instant month of May.
One Act was made and agreed upon, the tenor whereof hereafter follows in
these words. Whereas diverse good laws, statutes, and ordinances, have been
heretofore devised, and made, for the true and perfect making of clothes, and
other the commodities hereafter mentioned, and for the viewing, and searching

commodities, brought to the City of London to be sold, have not been brought
to the open market place, or places appointed for that purpose. But have been
bought, and sold, in secret and private houses, and places, by such as have
transported and vented them, in foreign parts beyond the seas, or retayled
them in their shoppes at home or otherwise at their pleasure: The said clothes
and other commodities neither have been, or could be conveniently viewed and
searched, according to the true meaning of the said laws, statutes and
ordinances, and thereby as experience has set forth, much deceiptfull and
evil cloth, and other commodities, have not only been uttered, sold, and
transported, from this City of London, to foreign parts out of this Realm,
to the great discredit of the said City and whole Realm, and the
commodities thereof, But also retayled and uttered within the same City, to
the great offense, loss, and prejudice of many her Majesty's loving subjects,
the wearers of the same. For remedy whereof. Be it enacted, ordained, and
