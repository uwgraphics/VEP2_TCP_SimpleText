TO THE TRVLY Honorable, and right worthy Knight, Sr. Thomas Smith, Governor
of the East India, Muscou^a, North-west passages, Somer Islands Companies, and
Treasurer f^r the first Colony in VIRGINIA.
Honorable Sir:
Having in the time of my residence in Virginia (as it is true my employment
then invited me thereunto) collected for my own use and benefit, some few
occurrents and accidents, which are obuious in all new employments, a thing
which perhaps but few regard there to busy themselves with, and fewer here to
peruse: I resolved indeed only to delight my self, and some who I am bound to
be thankful unto in that kind with the unworthy view of them, the rather,
because I have seen many publications and impressions of those affairs, by
those, whose books I should be proud to bear after them: but such is the
peruersenes of mankind, such their incredulity of every thing, save what their
eyes tell them to b^ true: yea, such their backwardnes in the pursuit of
horable enterprises, that though there should be no end of writing, but every
day should draw forth his line, and every line his real encouragement, as
mine may in the state of the Co^ony, as it now stands, it were hard to say
whether one of so many thousands as abound in England, might be thereby moved
to join with others right worthyly disposed to become a har^y and devoted
furtherer of an action so noble, as is this, which thing if I fail in
effecting, I shall not loose much labor, since when I undertook this task, I
imagined no such thing: but merely my own delight and content. It shall be
reward enough for me to express my endeavors there, though not equal with
the best, yet not idly misspent.

I labor not to seduce or betray any to an action or employment, wherein once
personally engaged, they should have any cause to blame me, neither would I
force the help of any man's purse, more then voluntary, if I could beyond my
art, use such effectual persuasions.

There are enough in my opinion, and those the worthyest of England already
united, as the way is now laid down, to perfect this business, whose
endeavors, if they proceed without, black slyding, and therein persist some
few years longer, shall be requited and paid with such treble interest, as it
shall not repent him that is now most cold in the pursuit, to have refused more
Competitors to be sharers in the returned profit.

Your noble self Sir, ever emulous of virtue, and honorable Enterprises,
should shine to the world more noble in the upholding of this employment,
though it apeared, as in the beginning, full of discouragement, which
nevertheless, I know your self rests so assured is now more near, then ever to
perfection. Your innate and habitual virtue needs no spur, your honorable
endeavors well witness the same: would God (as is yours) al men's offerings,
though not so ample, were so free, so heartily sacrificed: then could they not
thus long have wanted their rewards, perhaps for no other and detained, but to
make others, a thing which God professes to love and delight in, more chee^ful
giuers. Accept (worthy Sir) this unworthy Treatise, the b^st t^stimony of my
gratuity, which as yet my disabilities may render. Truth shall shroud and
patronize it, from the maleuolent detracting multitude; whose blame though it
incur their shame and imputation, it scorns, and returns unto them.

My zeal to the Action, though I may seem to have forsaken it, gives me the
heart to publish, what I know to the world: To your self particularly your own
worth, and de^arts to me, irrequitable, grant but that favorable acceptance,
which ever accompanies your worth; and I shall ever acknowledge my self wholly
yours, in hope whereof I conclude with my service, and rest

At your command to be disposed off; RALPH HAMO^.

To the Reader.
Ignorant, or envious, if you be Readers: ^t is not to satisfy the best of you
that I now write, a more seasonable time I must take to imbarque my self in so
rough a Sea and come off safe: only his ^uthoritie (who has power to compel
my self and duty) has commanded me to satisfy his affections (covetous of
the dignity and truth of this pious Plantation) with these particulars: that
they are got abroad* and become public, was no purpose in their first
conception though some respect have made them so now: A naked and vnstrudied
discourse, I acknowledge, without notes reserved but in M^morie) to help it:
yet thus much I do a^ow, that it has duty and truth to make good all other
the wants, and imperfections of it: I will l^bour in no further excuse.

Concer^ing the Virginie pious work it self, how it has thriued under the
command both of Sir Thomas Gates Knight, Governor, and Sir Thomas Dale
Knight, and Marshall of the Collonie, these three years and more: let me say,
if (setting aside thine own ouerwe^^ing and singularity) thy vnhoodded eye,
can now at length look upon it (after so many years of her patience and
passions) thou will easily acknowledge, whose finger has the al^^^-^uidance of
it, and then (I doubt nothing) be^le^sed to here thy self entreated (out of
those great ^lenties and hauings which God has lent thee) to spare a
little-little portion to the full setl^ng and finishing up a Sanctum Sanctorum
an holy house, a Sanctuary to him, the God of the Spirits, of all flesh,
amongst such poor and innocent seduced Savages as we treat off, on whom let
our hopes be, that it has vouchsafed him now to be sufficiently revenged for
their forefathers Ingratitude and treaso^s, and now in his appointed time to
des^^d in m^rcie, to lighten them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow o^
death, and to direct their feet in the ways of peace.

Sure young though in years and knowledge I may be said to be, yet let me
remember, to thee perhaps much knowing* Reader, what the wisest man that ever
writ or speak (excepting him that was both God and man) has said, that such
who bring others unto righteousness shall themselves shine as the stars in the
firmament. And doubtless I do believe, even amongst the rest of my Articles,
when these poor Heathens shall be brought to entertain the honor of the
name, and glory of the Gospel of our blessed Savior, when they shall testify
of the true and everliving God, and Jesus Christ to be their Salvation, their
knowledge so enlarged and sanctified that without him they confess their
eternal death: I do believe I say (and how can it be otherwise?) that they shall
break out and cry with rapture of so inexplicable mercy: Blessed be the King
and Prince of England, and blessed be the English Nation, and blessed for ever
be the most high God possessor of Heaven and earth, that sent these English as
^ngels to bring such glad tidings amongst us. These will be doub^lesse the
empaticke effects and exultation of ^his so Christian work, and may these
nothing move? Alas let S^^bal^at and Tobiah* Papists and Plai^es, Ammonites and
Horonites, the seumme and dregs of the people, let them mock at this holy
Business, they that be filthy, let them be f^lthie still, and let such swine
wallow in the mire, but let not the rod of the wick^d fal^ upon the let of the
righteous, let not them shrink back, and call in their helps from this so
glorious enterprise, which the Prophet Isaiah calls the declaring of God to the
left hand, but let them that know the work, re^oice and be glad in the happy
success of it, proclaiming that it is the everliving God that reigns in
England, and unto the ends of the world.

Excuse me (courteous Reader) if carried beyond my purpose, I declaime
passionately in this passive and innocently despised work, which I am sure is
so full of goodness, and have bin almost six years a Suffer and eye witness
of his now well nigh at chieu^d happiness, the full and unstained reportory of
every accident whereof even from his beginning, together with the causes of the
backwardnes, in prosperity thus ^og, touching at the miraculous delivery of the
scattered company, cast upon the Bermudas, when those for^unate Islands like so
many fair Neriades which received our wrackt company, with the death of that
pure and noble hearted Gentleman Sir George Sumers diing there my purp^se is
shortly at large to publish, that at length some one escaped Leaper amongst so
many saved, may return back and pay his v^wes of thanks giving unto that ever
to be praised merciful providence that brought us thither, until when I wish
thy zealous and ferne^t thoughts and endeavors to a business so full of piety,
^^ is this our Virginie Plantation.

RAPHE HAMOR.

A TRVE DISCOVRSE of the present estate of Virginia, and the success of the
affairs there till the 18 of June. 1614.
THe many publications and impressions of Virginia, an employment wherein to
this day my self with many other unstaid heads and thirsty after new
designs, have bin to unprofitably engaged, might justly excuse my silence, did
not the filial duty whereby in all things to the utmost of my power I am bound
to obey my Father, compel me unwillingly thereunto: A task I know by himself
and others, merely because I have bin Oculatus testis, thus imposed upon me,
in the undertaking and performance whereof, I heartily wish that my poor
relation, rich only in truth (as I shall clearly justify my self by cie
witnesses also) may give any credit or encouragement to proceed in a business
so full of honor, and worth, whereunto (if there were no secondary causes) the
already published ends, I mean the glory of God in the conversion of those
Infidels, and the honor of our King and country (which by right may claim at
the least their superfluities, from those whom God has in this world made his
dispensors and purse-bearers) might be a sufficient spur to resolved
Christians, especially the state and condition of our collonie, so standing
when I left it, and I assure my self in this time grown more mature, that an
honest heart would even relent, and mourn to think how poorly, I dare not say
unworthily it is prosecuted. It being true that now after five years intestine
war with the reuengefull implacable Indians, a firm peace (not again easily
to be broken) has bin lately concluded, not only with the nighbour, and
bordering Indidians, as on Pataomecke, Topahanah, and other Rivers, but even
with that subtle old reuengefull Powhatan and all the people under his
subjection, for all whom Powhatan himself stands firmly engaged, by which
means we shall not only be furnished with what commodities their country
yields, and have all the helps they may afforde vsin our endeavors (as they
are easily taught, and may by lenity and fair usage, as Sir Thomas Dale now
principal commander there, and most worthy the honor he houlds, is well
experienced in their dispositions, and accordingly makes use of them) be
brought, being naturally though ingenious, yet idly given, to be no less
industrious, nay to exceed our English, especially those which we hitherto and
as yet are furnished with, who for the most part no more sensible then beasts,
would rather starve in idleness (witness their former proceedings) then feast
in labor, did not the law compel them thereunto, but also which will be most
for our benefit, our own men may without hazard, I might say with security (by
selfe-experience) follow their feuerall labors, whereby twenty shall now be
able to perform more then heretofore has bin forty.

Though I conjecture and assure my self that ye cannot be ignorant by what
means this peace has bin thus happily both for our proceedings and the
welfare of the Naturals concluded, yet for the hono^^ of Captain Argol whose
endeavors in the action entitled him most worthy, I judge it no whit
impertine^t in my discourse to insert them, which with as much breuity as I
may, not omitting the circumstances most pertinent and material, I shall
endeavor.

The general letters upon my knowledge, directed and sent to the honorable
Virginia Council, being most of them (though my self most unworthy) by me
penned have intimated, how that the euerworthy gentleman Capt. Arga^^ in the
heat of our home furies and disagreements by his best experience of the
disposition of those people, partly by gentle usage and partly by the
composition and mixture of threats has ever kept fair and friendly quarter
with our neighbors bordering onother rivers of affinity, yea consanguinity, no
less near then brothers to Rowhatan, such is his well known temper and
discretion, yea to this pass has he brought them, that they assuredly trust
upon what he promises, and are as careful in performing their mutual
promises, as though they contended to make that Maxim, that there is no faith
to be held with Infidels, a mere and absurd Paradox: Nay as I have heard
himself relate, who is fide dignus, they have even bin pens^ue and
discontented with themselves, because they knew not how to do him some
acceptable good turn, which might not only pleasure him, but even be
profitable to our whole Collonie, and Plantation, yea ever assuring him that
when the times should present occasion, they would take hold of her forelocke,
and be the instruments to work him content, and even thus they proved
themselves as honest performers, as liberal promisers. It chanced Powhatans
delight and da^ling, his daughter Pocahuntas, (whose fame has even bin spread
in England by the title of Nonparella of Virginia) in her princely progress,
if I may so term it, took some pleasure (in the absence of Captain Argall
(to be among her friends at Pataomecke (as it seems by the relation I had)
employed thither, as shopkeepers to a Fare, to exchange some of her fathers
commodities for theirs, where residing some three months or longer, it fortuned
upon occasion either of promise or profit, Captain Argall to arrive there,
whom Pocahuntas, desirous to renew her familiarity with the English, and
delighting to see them, as unknown, fearful perhaps to be surprised, would
gladly visit, as she did, of whom no sooner had Captain Argall intelligence,
but he dealt with an old friend, and adopted brother of his Iapazeus, how and by
what means he might procure her captive, assuring him, that now or never, was
the time to pleasure him, if he intended indeed that love which he had made
profession of, that in ransom of hi^ he might redeem some of our English men
and arms, now in the possession of her Father, promising to use her withal
fair, and gentle entr^ary: Iapazeus well assured that his brother, as he
p^omised would use her courteously promised his best endeavors and secrecy to
accomplish his desire, and thus wrought it, making his wife an instrument
(which sex have ever bin most powerful in beguiling inticements) to effect his
plot which he had thus laid, he agreed that himself, his wife, and
Pocahuntas, would accompany his brother to the water side, whether come, his
w^^e should fair a great and longing desire to go aboorde, and see the
ship, which being there three or four times, before she had never seen, and
should be earnest with her husband to permit her: he seemed angry with her,
making as he pretended so unnecessary a request, especially being without the
company of women, which denial she taking unkindly, must feign to weep, (as
who knows not that women can command tears) whereupon her husband seeming to
pity those counterfeit tears, gave her leave to go aboard, so that it would
please Pochahuntas to accompany her: now was the greatest labor to win her,
guilty perhaps of her fathers wrongs, though not known as she supposed to go
with her, yet by her earnest persuasions, she a^^^nted: so forth with aboard
they went, the best cheer that could be made was seasonably provided, to
supper they went, merry on all hands, especially Iapazeus and his wife, who to
expres their joy, would ere be treading upon Capt. Argals foot, as who sh^^ld
say it is don, she is your own. Supper ended, Pochahuntas was lodged in the
Gunners room, but Iapazeus and his wife desired to have some conference with
their brother, which was only to acquaint him by what ^ratagem they had
betrayed his prisoner, as I have already related: after which discourse to
sleep they went, Pochahuntas nothing mistrusting this policy, who nevertheless
being most possessed with fear, and desire of return, was first up, and
hastened Iapazeus to be gone, Capt. Argall having secretly well rewarded him,
with a small Copp^r kettle, and some ^th^r les valuable toies so highly by him
esteemed, that doubtless he would have betrayed his own father for them,
permitted both him and his wife to return, but told him, that for diverse
considerations, as for that his father had then eigh of our English men, many
swords, pieces, and other tools, which he had at several times by trecherons
murdering our men, taken from them, which though of no use to him, he would not
redeliuer, he would reserve Pocahuntas, whereat she began to be^ exceeding
pensive, and discontented, yet ignorant o the dealing of Iapazeus, who in
outward appearance was no les discontented that he should be the means of her
captivity, much a do there was to persuade her to be patient, which with
extraordinary courteous usage, by little and little was wrought in her, and so
to James town she was brought, a messenger to her father forthwith dispached
to advertise him, that his only daughter was in the hands and possession of the
English: there to be kept til such time as he would ransom her with our men,
swords, pieces, and other tools treacherously taken from us: the news was
unwelcome, and troublesome unto him, partly for the love he bare to his
daughter, and partly for the love he bare to our men his prisoners, of whom
though with us they were unapt for any employment) he made great use: and those
swords, and pieces of ours, (which though of no use to him) it delighted him to
view, and look upon.

He could not without long advise and delibertion with his Council, resolve
upon any thing, and it is true, we heard nothing of him till three months
after, by persuasions of others he returned us seven of our men, with each of
them a Musket unserviceable, and by them sent us word, that whenever we
pleased to deliver his daughter, he would give us in satisfaction of his
injuries done to us, and for the rest of our pieces broken and stolen from him,
500 Bushells of Corne^ and be for ever friends with us, the men, and Pieces in
part of payment we received: and returned him answer, that his daughter was
very well, and kindly entreated, and so should be howsoever he dealt with us:
but we could not believe that the rest of our Arms were either lost, or stolen
from him, and therefore till he returned them all, we would not by any means
deliver his daughter, and then it should be at his choice, whether he would
establish peace, or continue enemies with us. This answer as it seemed,
pleased him not very well, for we heard no more from him till in March last,
when with Captain Argalls Ship, and some other Vessels belonging to the
Colony, Sir Thomas Dale with an hundred and fifty men well appointed, went up
into his own River, where his chiefest habitations were, and carried with us
his daughter, either to move them to fight for her, if such were their courage
and boldness, as has been reported, or to restore the residue of our demands,
which were our pieces, swords, tools. Some of the same men which he returned
(as they promised) ran to him again, and because he had put us to the trouble
to fetch them five hundred bushels of Corn: A great brauado all the way as we
went up the River they made, demanding the cause of our coming thither, which
we told them was to deliver Pocahuntas, whom purposely we had brought with
us, and to receive our Arms, men, and corn, or else to fight with them, burn
their howses, take away their Canoas, break down their fishing Wears, and
do, them what other damages we could: Some of them to set a good face on the
matter, replied, that if we came to fight with them? we were welcome, for they
were provided for us, councelling us rather to retire (if we loved our
safeties) then proceed, bragging, as well they might, that we had ever had the
worst of them in that River, instancing by Capt: Ratliefe (not worthy
remembering, but to his dishonor) who, with most of his company they betrayed
and murdered: we told them since they durst remember us of that mischief,
unless they made the better and more speedy agreement, we would now revenge
that treachery, and with this discourse by the way as we went, we proceeded, and
had no sooner entered the narrow of the river, the channel there lying within
shot of the shore, but they let their arrows fly amongst us in the ship,
themselves unseen to us, and in the forehead hurt one of our men, which might
have hazarded his life without the present help of a skillful Surgeon.

Being thus justly provoked, we presently manned our boats, went ashoare, and
burned in that very place some forty houses, and of the things we found
therein, made freeboote and pillage, and as themselves afterward confessed unto
us, hurt and killed five or six of their men, with this revenge sa^^sfying our
selves, for that their presumption in shooting at us, and so the next day
proceeded higher up the River, the Indians calling unto us, and demanding why
we went a shore, burnt their houses, killed and hurt their men, and took away
their goods. We replied that though we came to them in peaceable manner, and
would have been glad to have received our demands with love and peace, yet we
had hearts and power to take revenge, and punish where wrongs should be offered,
which having now don, though not so severely as we might, we rested content
therewith and are ready to embrace peace with them if they pleased, Many
excuses they seemed to pretend, that they shot not a^ us, but (if any such
abuse were offered) it was some stragled Indian, ignorant of our pretense in
coming to them, affirming that they themselves would be right glad of our
love, and would endeavor to help us to what we came for, which being in the
possession of Powhatan their King, they would without delay dispatch messengers
to him, to know his purpose and pleasure, desiring fair quarter some 24
hours, for so long they pretended it would be before their messengers might
return: this we granted, and what we promised, we ever exactly performed,
the time now come, we inquired what Powhatan would do, and had for answer,
that our Englishmen lately with him, fearful to be put to death by us, were
run away, and some of Powhatans men sent abroad in quest of them, but our
swords and pieces so many as he had should be brought the next day, which
merely to delay time, they bare us in hand the next day they came not, higher
up the river we went, and ancored near unto the chiefest residencie Powhatan
had, at a town called Matchcot where were assembled (which we saw) about 400
men, well appointed with their bows and arrows to welcome us, here they dared
us to come a shore, a thing which we purposed before, so a shore we went, our
best landing being up a high steep hill which might have given the enemy much
advantage against us, but it seemed they as we were unwilling to begin, and yet
would gladly have bin at blows, being landed as if they had no show of fear,
they stirred not from us, but walked up and down, by and amongst us, the best
of them inquiring for our Weroance or king, with whom they would gladly consult
to know the occasion of our coming thither, whereof when they were informed,
they made answer that they were there ready to defend themselves, if we
pleased to assault them, desiring nevertheless some small time to dispatch two
or three men once more to their king, to know his resolution, which if not
answerable to our requests, in the morning if nothing else but blood would then
satisfy us, they would fight with us, and thereby determine our quarrel,
which was but a further delay to procure time to carry away their provisions,
nevertheless we agreed to this their request, assuring them till the next day
by noone we would not molest, hurt, nor detain any of them, and then before we
fought, our Drum and Trumpets should gi^e them warning: upon which promise of
ours, two of Powhatans sons being very desirous to see their sister who was
there pr^s^nt ashore with us, came unto us, at the sight of whom, and her well
fare, whom they suspected to be worse entreated, though they had often h^ard
the contrary, they much rejoiced, and promised that they would undoubtedly
persuade their father ^o redeem her, and to conclude a firm peace forever
with us, and upon this resolution the two brothers with us retired aboarde, we
having first dispatched two Englishmen, Ma^ster John Rolfe and master Sparks
to acquaint their Father with the business in hand, the next day being kindly
entreated, they returned, not at all admitted Powhatans presence, but spoke
with his brother Apachamo, his successor, one who has already the command of
all the people, who likewise promised us his best indeauors to further our just
requests, and we because the time of the year being then April, called us to
our business at home to prepare ground, and set corn for our winters
provision, upon these terms departed, giving them respite t^ll harvest to
resolve what was best for them to do, with this Prouiso, that if final
agreement were not made betwixt us before that time, we would thith^r return
again and destroy and take away all their corn, burn all the houses upon
that ri^er, leave no^ asish^ng Weere standing, nor a Canoa in any c^eeke
therabout, and destroy and kill as many of them as we could.

Long before t^is time a gentleman of approved b^hauiour and hon^st carriage,
master John R^lfe had bin in love with Pocahuntas and ^he with him, which
thing at the instant that we were in parlee with them, my self made known to
Sir Thomas Dal^ by a letter from him, whereby he entreated his advise and
furtherance in his love, if so it seemed fit to him ^or the good of the
Plantation, and Pocahuntas her self, acquainted her brethren therewith: which
resolution Sir Thomas Da^e well approving, was the only cause: he was so mild
amongst them, who otherwise would not have departed their river without other
conditions.

The brute of this pretended marriage came soon to Powhatans knowledge, a
thing acceptable to him, as appeared by his sudd^n consent thereunto, who some
t^n days after ^ent an ol^e uncle of hirs, named Opachisco, to give her as his
deputy in the Church, and two of his sons to see the marriage solemnized,
which was accordingly done about the fist of April, and ever since we have had
friendly commerce and trade, not only with Powhatan himself, but also with
his subjects round about us; so as now I see no reason why the Coll^nie should
not thrive a pace.

Besides this love by this means with Powhatan concluded, it will be worth my
pa^nes to tunouer our friendship with our next neighbors, the Chicohomin^es
late^y confirmed, a lusty and daring people, who have long time lived free
from Powhatans subjection, having law^s and governors within themselves: these
people hearing of our concluded peace with Powhatan, as the no^se thereof was
soon bruted abroad, sent two of their men unto us, and two fat Bucks for
present to our king (for so Sir Thomas Dale is generally reputed and termed
amongst them) and offe^ed themselves and service unto him, alleging that
albeit in former times they had bin our en^mies, and we theirs, yet they would
now if we pleased become not only our trusty friends, but even King JAMES his
subjects and tributari^s, and relinquish their old name of Ch^cohominies, and
^ake upon them, as they call us the name of Tossantessa^, and because they h^^e
no principal commander or Wer^ance, they would entreat Sir Thomas Dale as
King JAMES his deputy to be their supreme head, King and governor, and in all
just causes and quarrels to defend them, as they would be ready at all times to
aid him, only their desire was to enjoy their own laws and liberties, and
because himself, by reason of his many other employments, beside the charge he
has of his own people, may not be always present amongst them, to be
governed as formerly by eight of the elders and principal men amongst them, as
his substitutes and councellers, and even this was the sum and effect of
their embassy, Sir Thomas Dale appointed a day to send some men into their
river, to propose certain conditions unto them, whereunto if they assented he
would gladly accept of their proffered friendship, and be himself their
Weroance: and with this answer offering them copper for their venison, which
they refused to take, dismissed them.

When the appointed day came, Sir Thomas Dale himself and Captain Argall with
50 men in a barge and frigot, well appointed, least any treachery might be
intended, set forward to Chicohominie, an arm of our river some seven miles
from James Town, where we found the people according to promise expecting our
coming, assembled and met together, who after their best and most friendly
manner, bad us welcome, and because our business at home would permit us but
small time of stay with them, they presently sent for their principal men, some
of whom were then absent, which hastened unto us, and the next morning very
early assembled, and sat in counsel about this business, Captain Argall
(supplying Sir Thomas Dales place amongst them, who though there present for
some respects, concealed himself, and kept aboarde his barge) after long
discourse of their former proceedings, Captain Argall told them, that now
since they had entreated peace and promised their love and friendship, he was
sent unto them from the great Weroance to conclude the same, all former
injuries on both sides, set apart and forgotten, which he would do upon these
conditions.

First that they should take upon them, as they promised, the name of
Tassant^sses or English men, and be King JAMES his subjects, and be forever
honest, faithful and trusty unto his deputy in their country.

Secondly, that they should never kill any of our men or cattle, but if either
our men or cattle should offend them or run to them, they should bring them
home again, and should receive ^atisfaction for the trespass done them.

Thirdly, they should at all times be ready and willing to furnish us with
three or four hundred bowmen to aid us against the Spaniards, whose name is
odious amongst them, for Powhatans father was driven by them from the
West Indies into those parts, or against any other Indians which should,
contrary to the established peace of^er us any injury.

Fourthly, they shall not upon any occasion whatsoever break down any of our
pales, or come into any of our Towns or forts by any other w^ies, issues or
ports then ordinary, but first call, and say the Tossantessas are there, and so
coming they shall at all times be let in, and kindly entertained.

Fifthly, so many fighting men as they have which may be at the least five
hundred should yearly bring into our store house, at the beginning of their
^aruest two bu^hels of corn a man, as tribute of their obedience to his
Majesty, and to his deputy there, for which they should receive so many Iron
Tomahawkes or small hatchets.

Lastly, the eight chief men which govern as substitutes and Counselors
under Sir Thomas Dale, shall at all times see these Articles and conditions
duly performed for which they shall receive a red coat, or liue^y from ou^ King
yeere^y, and each of them the pi^ture of his Majesty, engraven iu Copper, wi^h
^ chain of Copper to hang it about his neck, whe^by they shall be known to
be King JAMES his noble Men; so as if these conditions, or any of them be
broken, the offenders themselves shall not one^y be punished, but also those
Co^maundets, because they stand engaged ^or them.

After these Arti^les were thus proposed, the whole assembly assenting
thereunto, answered with a great sho^t, and noise, that they would readily and
willingly perform them all ^ and immediat^ly began the chief of the eight to
make an oration to the rest, bending his speech first to the old men, then to
the young men, and in conclusion to the women and children, giving them thereby
to understand the sum of the proposed conditions: and how strictly they were
to observe them: in consideration whereof, he further declared what we have
promised to do for them, not only ^o defend and keep them from the fury and
danger of Powhatan, which thing they most feared, but even from all other
enemies, domesticke, or foreign, and that we would yearly by trade furnish
them with Copper, Beads, Hatchets, and many other necessaries, yea, which
liked them best, that we would permit them to enjoy their own liberties,
freedoms, and laws, and to be governed as formerly, by eight of their chiefest
men.

It shall not be unnecessary to insert the occasion (as we im^gine) of this
their much desired, unexpected friendship, which was questionless some sudden
fear of Powhatans displeasure, being united with us, ^ow able to revenge their
disobedience done unto him: for you must imagine, these people presuming upon
their own strength and number (in no one place in those parts, which we know,
so many together) to have a long time neglected Powhatan, and refused, (which
the place has* been formerly accutomed, and as his right may chal^enge the
homage and duty of subjects, which they ought to have performed: to which
obedience, fearing our power might compel them, they chose rather to subject
themselves to us, then being enemies to both, to expose and lay themselves open
to Powhat^ns tyranny, and oppression: for this they did chiefly insist upon,
that he was an ill Weroaules, full of cruelty, and minstice, covetous of those
things they had, and implacable if they denied him whatsoever he demanded, and
f^r these reasons, desired to be made one people wi^h us, to curb the pride
and ambition of Powhatan, from whom to def^nd them (they told us it would be
no breach of peace on our parts since now they were no longer Chicohomimes, or
Naturalls, of that place, but Tossantessars, and King JAMES his subjects, whom
we are bound to defend.

So soon as there was an end of speaking, and the peace firmly concluded, and
assented unto, Captain Argall by the gui^t of eight great pieces of Copper,
and eight great Tomahawkes, bound the eight great me^, or Counselors to the
exact performance, and keeping of the same, according to the conditions
proclaimed, which they very gla^ly and thankefully acc^pted, and returned him,
as testimonies of their loves, Venison, Turkies, Freshfish, baskets, Mats, and
such like things as they were then furnished with, and so the Council brook
up* and t^en eue^y man brought to sell to our men Skins, boules, ma^s
baskets, tobacco, etc. and became as familiar amongs^ us, as if they had been
English men iudeede.

Thus have I briefly as the matter would permit, discoursed our es^ablished
friendship with the Naturalls, and the occasions thereof, which I hope will
continue so long between us, till they shall have the understanding to
acknowledge how much they are bound to God for sending us amongst them (then
which) what work would be more acceptable to God, more honorable to our King
and country?

The greatest, and many enemies and disturbers of our proceedings, and that
which has hitherto deterd our people to address themselves into those parts,
have been only two; emnity with the Naturalls, and the bruit of famine: one of
these two (and that indeed, which was some cause of the other) I have already
removed, and shall as easily take away the other: howbeit it were too great
folly (I might say impudency in me) to aver that there has reigned no such
in^ection in the Colony, occasioned, merely by misgouernment, idleness, and
faction, and chiefly by the absence ofthe ever worthy Commanders, Sir Thomas
Gates, and Sir George Summers by the providence of God, miraculously wract and
saved upon the hopeful Sumer Islands, since my self cannot but witness (of
which I had some taste) in what a miserable condition, we found the Colony at
our ariuall there, from the Bermudas, not living above threescore persons
therein, and those scarce able to go alone, of welnigh six hundred, not full
ten months before: yet now I dare and will boldly affirm to the greatest
adversary of the Plantation, that shall aver the contrary, that there is that
plenty of food, which every man by his own industry may easily, and does
procure that the poorest there, and most in want, has not bin so much pinched
with hunger this 4 years that if he would take any pains, he knew not where to
fetch a good meals meat: and true it is, that every day by the providence,
and blessing of God, and their own industry, they have more plenty then other,
the reason hereof is at hand, for formerly, when our people were fed out of
the common store and labored jointly in the manuring of the ground, and
planting corn, glad was that man that could slip from his labor, nay the
most honest of them in a general business, would not take so much faithful
and true pains, in a week, as now he will do in a day, neither cared they
for the increase, presuming that howsoever their harvest prospered, the
general store must maintain them, by which means we reaped not so much corn
from the labors of 30 men, as three m^n have done for themselves: to prevent
which mischief hereafter Sir Thomas Dale has taken a new course, throughout
the whole Colony, by which means, the general store (apparel only
excepted) shall not be charged with any thing: and this it is, he has allotted
to every man in the Colony, three English Acres of clear Corn ground, which
every man is to mature and tend, being in the nature of Farmers, (the Bermuda
undertakers only excepted) and they are not called unto any service or labor
belonging to the Colony, more then one month in the year, which shall neither
be in seed time, or in Harvest, for which, doing no other duty to the Colony,
they are yearly to pay into the store two barrells and a half of Corn: there
to be reserved to keep new men, which shall be sent over, the first year after
their arrival: and even by this means I dare say, our store will be
bountifully furnished, to maintain three or four hundred men, whenever they
shall be sent thither to us, that money which hitherto has bin disbursed, to
provide a tweluemoneths^ victuals, if there were but now half so much
bestowed in clothes, and bedding, will be such comfort to the men, a^ even
thereby the lives of many shall not only be preserved, but also themselves
kept in strength and heart, able to per^^^me such businesses, as shall be
imposed upon them and thus shall also the former charge b^ well saved, and yet
more business effected, the action renowned and more commodity returned to the
Merchant, and ye^ saint for want of encou^agement.

Concerning the undertaking of the Bermuda City, a business of greatest hope,
ever begun in our Territories there, their Pattent, which I purpose in this
Treatise to insert, does apparently demonst^ate, upon what terms and
conditions they voluntarily have undertaken that employment, how forward that
business is, in his due place shall be expressed, only give me leave with as
much breuity as I may, least any man should divert his mind, and be fearful
to adventure his person thither, for fear of famine and penury, to amplify a
little the plenty there, for if it be true, as most eertaine it is, that those
whom I have described under the title of Farmers, can pay into our Store, two
barrels and a half of Corn yearly, and others who labor eleauen months in
the general business of the Colony, and but one to provide thems^lues
victuals, why should any man (if he be industrious) mistrust staruing? if
otherwise, for any part, and I think all that are engaged in the Action, and
understand the business, accord with me herein, and would not wish his
company there, nay they shall much wrong themselves, and the Action, if they
do not withstand such, and deny them passage: for even they and none else have
been the occasions of the manifould imputations, and disgraces, which Virginia
has innocently undergone, through their defaults: I would therefore by these
relations not only encourage honest and industrious: but also deter all
lasie, impotent, and ill livers from, addressing themseues thither, as being a
Country too worthy for them, and altogether disconsonant to their natures,
which must either brook labor or hazard, and undergo much displeasure,
punishment, and penury, if they escape a thing which few idlers have don, the
scuruy dis^ase, with which few, or none once infected, have recovered.

To proceed therefore in my encouragement to painful people, such as either
through crosses in this world, or wract rents, or else great charge of children
and family lieu here, and that not without much care and sweat, in^o extreme
poverty: for those this Country has present remedy: Eucrie such person, so
wel^ disposed to adventure thither, shall soon find the difference between their
own, and that Country. The affairs in the Colony, being so well ordered, and
the hardest taskes already ouerpast, that whosoever (now, or hereafter) shall
happily arrive there, shall find^ a hansome house of some four rooms or more,
if he have a family, to repose himself in rent freee, and twelve English Acres
of ground, adjoining thereunto, very strongly impailed, which ground is only
allotted unto him for Roots, Gardaine herbs, and Corn: neither shall he need
to provide himself, as were wont the first plantersi, of a years provision of
victuals, for that the store there will be able to afford him, and upon
these conditions he shall be entertained; He shall have for himself and
family, a competent^ 1^ months provision delivered unto him, in which time it
must be his care to provide for himself and family ever after, as those
already there, to this end he shall be furnished with necessary tools of all
sorts, and for his better subsistence he shall have Poultry, and swine, and if
he deserve it, a Goat or two, perhaps a Cow given him, which once compast, how
happily he may live, as do many there, who I am sure will never return, I
submit to their own future well experienced judgments.

Now, least any man should yet rest discouraged because as yet no mention is
made of any other provision of victuals, save only of bread corn, whih
grant, it may with labor be competently procured, will afford but a bare,
and miserable living, I think there is no man so ignorant to conceive, that
such a main continent as is Virginia, boundless, for ought we have discovered,
and so goodly Rivers, no where else to be parralled, should be more barraine of
Cattle, Fish, and Foul, then other Lands, assuredly they are not: for true it
is, that the Land is stored with plenty and variety of wild beasts, Lions,
Bears, Decre of all sorts, (only differing from ours in their increase, having
usual, three or four Fawnes at a time, none that I have seen or heard off
under two: the reason whereof some of our people ascribe to the virtue of some
grass or herb which they eat, because our Goats often times bring forth
three, and most of them two: for my part I rather impute their fecundiry to the
providence of God, who for every mouth prouideh meat, and if this increase
were not, the Naturalls would assuredly starve: f^r of the Dear (they kill as
do we Bee^es in England) all the year long, neither sparing young nor old, no
not the Does ready to fawn, nor the young fawnes, if but two days old)
Beauers, Otters, Foxes, Racounes, almost as big as a Fox, as good meat as a
lamb, hares, wild Cats, musk rats, Squirills flying, and other of three or
four sorts, Apossumes, of the bigness and likeness of a Pigge, of a month
old, a beast of as strange as incredible nature, she has commonly seven young
ones, sometimes more and sometimes less which at her pleasure till they be a
month old or more she takes up into her belly; and puts forth again
without hurt to her self or them.

Of each of these beasts, the Lion excepted, my self have many times eaten,
and can testify that they are not only tastefull, but also wholesome and
nourishing food.

There are ^oule of diverse sorts, Eagles, wild Turkeis much bigger then our
English, Cranes, Herons white and ^usset, Hawks, wild Pigeons (in winter
beyond number or imagination, my self have seen three or four hours
together flocks in the air, so thick that even they have shaddowed the sky
from us) Turckie Bussards, Partridge, Suipes, Owls, Swans, Geese, Brants,
Ducke and Mallard, Droeis, Shel Drakes Cormorants, Teale, Widgeon, Curlewes,
Puits, besides other small birds, as Blacke-birde, hedge sparrowes, Oxeies,
wood peckers, and in winter about Christmas many flocks of Parakertoths.

For fish the Rivers are plentifully stored, with Sturgion, Porpasse, Base,
Rockfish, Carpe, Shad, Herring, Ele, Catfish, Perch Flat-fish, Troute,
Sheepes-head, Drummers, Iarfish, Creuises, Crabbes, Oisters and diverse other
kinds, of all which my self have seen great quantity taken, especially the
last summer at Smiths Island, at one hale, a frigots lading of Sturgion, Base
and other great fish in Captain Argals Sauie: and even at that very place
which is not above fifteen miles from Pointeomfort, if we had been furnished
with salt, to have saved it, we might have taken as much fish as would have
served us that whole year.

Nor are these prouicion of bread, flesh and fish, al we have for sustentation
of man's life, behold more change and variety of food, which our soil and
climate affords, Carrats, Parsneps, Turnips, Raddish, Pumpions (of the west
Indie kind in great abundance, of one seed I have seen an hundredth, much
better then ours and lasting all the year) Cabbadge, Parsley, all manner of
pothearbs and other herbs, Marger^^, Time, wi^ter-Sauory, Lettice Purslaine,
etc, and besides the natural grain of that Country, as wheat pease and
beans, it did me much good to view our English wheat how forward it was, full
eard, of one grain forty cares or more, a span long, and only wanting
ripening in mid June our English pease then ripe, and beans very forward, and
English barley very hopeful, such as mine e^es never beheld, better in England:
And if that soil bring forth these things (as can those which have bin there
with me affirm and witness) as plentiful and unchangeable for taste and
quantity as England or any other country, why should any man that has his
limbs, in a peaceable state as is that, so much as dream of staruing?

To go yet a little further, I my self know no one Country yielding without
art or industry so many fruits, sure I am England does: wild grapes in
abundance all the woods over, their juice sweet and pleasant in taste, some of
them we have replanted in a vineyard adjoining to Henrico, the quantity of
three or four Akers which were this year very plentifully laden, to what
perfection they will come, the next return will advertise: Cherries little
inferior to ours, which if replanted may prove as much better as now they are
worse Pissmienplums in bygnes and fashion like a Medlar of a flipticke quality,
other sorts of plummes like to our wheat plums, and in goodness answerable:
great fields and woods abounding with Strawberies much fairer and more sweet
then ours, Mulberries of great bigness, and about the Bermuda City and
Hundirds thereunto belonging great store thereof, Maricocks of the fashion of a
Lemmon whose blossom may admit comparison with our most delight some and
bewtifull flowers, and the fruit exceeding pleasant and tast^^^^^
Ches^^it-trees toward the false as many as oaks, and as fertile, many goodly
groves of Chincomen trees with a husk like unto a Chestnut, raw or hoyled,
luscious and hearty meat: Walnuts of three or four sorts, where o^ (...) might
be yearly made great quantity of oyl^s, as useful and good as that of Olives:
some filberds I have seen, Crabbes great store, less, but not so sower as
ours, which grafted with the Siens of English^ aple trees, without question
would bear very good fruit, and we doubt not but to have the Siens enough the
next year, there being in Sir Thomas Gates his garden at James town, many
forward apple and pear trees come up, of the kernels set the year before.

If all this be not sufficient, lo further encouragement, the collony is
already furnished with two hundred neat cattle, as many goats, infinite
hogs in herds all over the woods, besides those to every town belonging in
general, and every private man, some Mares, Horses and Colts, Poultry great
store, besides tame Turkeis, Peacockes and Pigeons plentifully increasing and
thriuing there, in no Country better.

Of our young Steeres the next winter we doubt not to have three or four
Ploughes going, which once compast, we shall in short time be able to repay
England the corn they have lent us.

If I knew yet any further impediments which might seem to give discouragement
to adventure thither, I should as easily remove them.

Object that pleases the want of clothes, so long as there are wild beasts
there, and the beasts have skins on their backs (if the necessity were such)
why should not we as do the naturals, cloth our selves therewith, it is no
worse then our forefathers have worn before us, and such as will save us from
the cold in winter, and heat in summer: but admit there* were no skins or
being there, our people disdain to wear them. If there be any man that has
been so ill an husband here that he cannot furnish himself with a years
provision of apparel; if I might counsel he should not be suffered to go
thither, for that country is not for him, as for others who can provide
apparel for the first year, I hold him a worse husband then the former,
that shall at any time after be worse clothed then he went over: the valuable
commodity of Tobacco of such esteem in England (if there were nothing else)
which every man may plant, and with the least part of his labor, tend and care
will return him both clothes and other necessaries. For the goodness
whereof, answerable to west-Indie Trinidado or Craeus (admit there has no such
bin returned) let no man doubt. Into the discourse whereof, since I am obuiously
entered, I may not forget the gentleman, worthy of much commendations, which
first took the pains to to make trial thereof, his name Mr John Rolfe, Anno
Domini 1612. partly for the love he has a long time borne unto it, and partly
to raise commodity to the adventurers, in whose behalf I witness and
vouchsafe to hold my testimony in beleef^, that during the time of his aboade
there, which draws near upon six years, no man has labored to his power,
by good example there and worthy encouragement into England by his letters,
then he has done, witness his marriage with Rowhatans daughter, one of rude
education, manners barbarousand cursed generation, merely for the good and
honor of the Plantation: And least any man should conceive that some sinister
respects allured him hereunto, I have made bold contrary to his knowledge in
the end of my treatise to insert the true coppie of his letter, written to Sir
Thomas Dale to acquaint him with his proceedings, and purpose therein, the
rather to give testimony to the misconstruing and ill censuring multitude of
his integrity, in the undertaking a matter of so great a consequent, who in my
hearing have not spared to speak their pleasures; his own letter hits them
home, and the better sort, who know to censure iudiciously cannot but highly
commend and approve so worthy an undertaking.

Thus far I have applied my self to encourage personal Adventurers: I would
gladly now by worthy motives, allure the heavy undertakers to persist with
alacrity and cheerfulness, both for their own reputations, the honor of
God, and their King and Country. The worthier sort, J mean those Nobles and
others of that honorable counsel interessed therein, need no spur, their
own innate virtues drives them a pace. The Merchant only wants some feeling
and present return of those commodities which he is persuaded the country
affords: to them therefore I will address my speech, and if I may persuade
them to be constant in their proceedings some small time longer, the benefit
will be the greater and the more welcome when it comes.

It is not for nothing Sir Thomas Dale, so nobly without respect to his
living, to his Lady here in England, past the prefixed time of his resolved
return, yet remains there; I am sure if he pleased he might return with as
much honor as any man from thence, I say not more.

I shall little need, and indeed it were but wast and Idle for me to repeat
and mention the commodities, which with only labor may be there procured:
many Treatises has them at full. Samples have been sent home, and no man
disputes the goodness, or the quantity there to be had: take therefore double
courage to yourselues, and let these two years neglect be restored by a
cheerful and new onset, and for your encouragement read yet a little
further, and view the face of the Colony, even superficially portraide: see
what effects these three ye^res have wrought.

In May 1611 Sir Thomas Dale, with a prosperous passage, not full eight weeks
arrived there, with him about three hundred people, such as for the present
speed, and dispatch could then be provided, of worse condition then those
formerly there, who I sorrow to speak it, were not so provident, though once
before bitten with hunger and pennury, as to put corn into the gound for their
winters bread, but trusted to the store, then furnished but with eight months
provision. His first care therefore was to employ al hands about se^ting of
Corn at the two Forts, seated upon Ke^oughtan, Henry and Charles, whereby the
season then not fully past, though about the end; of May, we had there an
indifferent Crop of good corn.

This business taken order for, and the care and trust of it committed to his
under officers, to James Town he hastened, where the most company were, and
their daily and usual works, bowling in the streets, these he employed about
necessary works, as felling of Timber, repairing their houses ready to fall
upon their heads, and providing pales, post and railes to impaile his pu^posed
new Town, which by reason of his ignorance in those parts, but newly arrived
there, he had not resolved where to seat. For his better knowledge therefore
of those parts, himself with an hundredth men, spent some time in discovery,
first Nansamund River, which in dispight of the Indians, then our enemies, he
discovered to the head, after that, our own River, to the false, whereupon a
high land environed with the mayn River, some sixteen or twenty miles, from
the head of the False, near to an Indian Town called Arsahattocke, he resolved
to plant his new Town, and so did, whereof in his due place I shall make a
brief relation.

It was no mean trouble to him, to reduce his people, so timely to good order,
being of so il a condition as may well witness his severe and strict imprinted
book of Articles, then needful with all severity and extremity to be
executed, now much mitigated, for more deserved death in those days, then do
now the least punishment, so as if the law should not have restrained by
execution, I see not how the utter subversion and ruin of the Colony should
have bin prevented, witness Webbes and Prises design the first year, since
that Abbots and others more dangerous then the former, and even this summer,
Coals and Kitchins Plot, with three more, bending their course toward the
Southward, to a Spanish Plantation, reported to be there, who had traveled (it
being now a time of peace) some five days journey to Ocanahoe^, there cut off
by certain Indians, hired by us to hunt them home to receive their deserts. So
as Sir Thomas Dale has not bin tyranous, nor severe at all; Indeed the
offenses have bin capital, and the offenders dangerous, incurable members, for
no use so fit as to make examples to others, but the manner of their death may
some object, has bin cruel, unusual and barbarous, which indeed they have
not bin, witness France, and other Countries for less offenses: what if they
have bin more severe then usual in England, there was just cause for it, we
were rather to have regard to those whom we would have terrified, and made
fearful to commit the like offenses, then to the offenders justly condemned,
It being ^rue that amongst those people (who for the most part are sencible
only of the bodies torment) the fear of a cruel, painful and unusual,
death, more restrains them then death it self.

Thus much obuiously, I proceed in his endeavors until Sir Thomas Gates his
happy arrival, which was only in preparing timber, pales, posts and railes
for the present impaling this new Town to secure himself and men from the
malice and treachery of the Indians, in the midst and heart of whom, he was
resolved to set down, but before he could make himself ready for that
business, Sir Thomas Gates though his passage more long then usual, to second
him herein, happily arrived about the second of August, with six good Ships,
men, provisions and cattle, whom as yet not fully discovered, we supposed to be
a Spanish fleet, thus induced the rather to believe, because in company with
him were three Caruals, vessels which never before had bin sent thither, and
now only for the transportation of the Cattle. It did me much good, and gave
great courage to the whole company to see the resolution of Sir Thomas Dale,
now wholly busied (our land fortifications to weak to withstand a foreign
Enemy) in lading our provisions aboard the two good Ships, the Star and
Prosperous, and our own Deliverance, then riding before James town, aboarde
which Ships, he had resolved to encounter the supposed Enemy, animating his
people, not only with the hope of victory if they readily obeyed his
direction, but also assuring them that if by these means God had ordained to
set a period to their lives, they could never be sacrificed in a more
acceptable service, himself promising, rather to fire the Spanish Ships with
his own, then either basely to yield, or to be taken: and in nothing he
seemed so much discontent as that we could not possibly lade aboarde all our
provisions before (the wind being then very fair) they might have bin with
us, whilst therefore the rest were laboring their utmost to lade aboarde our
provisions, he caused a small shallop to be manned with thirty ready and good
shot to discover directly what Ships they might be, and withal speed to
return him certain word, which within three hours they did, assuring him
that is was an English ^eete, Sir Thomas Gates General thereof: which news
how welcome it was unto him, principally because now he doubted not the happy
progression of the affairs in hand, let any man (equally with him affected to
the good and welfare of the action) judge and determine.

The worthies being met, after salutation and welcome given, and received, Sir
Thomas Dale acquainted Sir Thomas Gates both with such businesses as he had
affected since his arrival, and also of his resolution to build a new Town,
at the Fales, which design and purpose of his, Sir Thomas Gates then
principal Governor in Virginia, well approving, furnished him with three
hundred and fifty men, such as himself made choice of, and the beginning of
September 1611 he set from James town, and in a day and a half, landed at a
place where he purposed to seat and build, where he had not bin ten days
before he had very strongly impaled seven English Acres of ground for a town,
which in honor of the noble Prince Henry (of ever happy and blessed memory,
whose royal heart was ever strongly affected to that action) he called by the
name of Henrico. No sooner was he thus fenced, and in a manner secured from the
Indians, but his next work (without respect to his own health or particular
welfare) was building at each corner of the town, very strong and high
commanders or watchtowers, a fair and handsome Church, and storehouses, which
finished he began to think upon convenient houses, and lodgings for himself
and men, which with as much speed as was possible, were more strongly and more
handsome then any formerly in Virginia, contrived and finished, and even in
four months space, he had made Henrico much better and of more worth then all
the work ever since the Colonie began, therein done.

I should be to tedious if I should give up the account of every days labor,
which therefore I purposly omit, and will only describe the town, in the very
state and perfection which I left it, and first for the situation, it stan^es
upon a neck of a very high land, 3 parts thereof environed with the main River,
and cut over between the two Rivers, with a strong pale, which make^h the neck
of land an Island. There is in this town 3 streets of well framed howses, a
hansom Church, and the foundation of a more stately one laid, of Brick, in
length, an hundred foot, and fifty foot wide, beside Store houses, watch
houses, and such like: there are also, as ornaments belonging to this Town,
upon the verge of this River, five fair Block houses, or commanders, wherein
live the honester sort of people, as in Farms in England, and there keep
continual centinell for the towns security, and about two miles from the
town into the Main, a Pale of two miles in length, cut over from river to
river, guarded likewise with several Commanders, with a great quantity of corn
ground impaled, sufficient if there were no more in the Colony secured, to
maintain with but easiy manuring, and husbandry, more men, then I suppose, will
be addressed thither (the more is the pity) these 3 years.

For the further enlargement yet of this Town, on the other side of the River,
by impaling likewise: for we make no other fence, is secured to our use,
especially for our hogs to feed in, about twelve English miles of ground, by
name, Hope in faith, CoxenDale, secured by five Forts, called, Charity Fort,
Mount malado, a retreat, or guest house for sick people, a high seat, and
wholesome air, Elzabeth Fort, and Fort patience: and here has Mr. Whitacres
chosen his Parsonage, or Church land, some hundred Acres impaled, and a fair
framed parsonage house built thereupon, called Rock Hall of this Town, and
all the Forts thereunto belonging, has Captain James Dauis, the principal
Command, and Government.

I proceed to our next and most hopeful habitation, whether we respect
commodity, or security, (which we principally aim at) against foreign
designs, and invasions, I mean the Bermuda City, begun about Christmas last,
which because it is the nearest adjoining to Henrico, though the last
undertaken, I hold it pertinent to handle in the next place. This Town, or
plantation is seated by land, some 5 miles from Henrico, by water fourteen,
being the year before the habitation of the Appamatucks, to revenge the
treacherous injury of those people, done unto us, taken from them, besides all
their Corn, the former before without the loss of any, save only some few of
those Indians, pretending our hurt) at what time Sir Thomas Dale, being himself
upon that service, and duly considering how commodious a habitation and seat it
might be for us, took resolution to possess and plant it, and at that very
instant, gave it the name of the new Bermudas, whereunto he has laid out, and
annexed to be belonging to the freedom, and corporation for ever, many miles
of C^ampion, and woodland, in several Hundreds, as the vpp^r and nether
Hundreds, Rochdale hundred, Wests Sherly hundred, and Digges his hundred In the
nether hundred he first began to plant, and inhabit for that there lies the
most convenient quantity of Corn ground, and with a Pale cut over from, River
to River, about two miles long, we have securd some eight miles circuit of
ground, the most part champion, and exceeding good Corn ground, upon which
pale, and round about, upon the verge of the River in this Hundred, half a
mile distant from each other, are very fair houses, already builded, besides
diverse other particular men's houses, not so few as fifty, according to the
conditions of the pattent granted them, which who so pleases to peruse, shall
in the end of my discourse find it inserted. In this Plantation next to Sir
Thomas Dale is principal, in the Command, Captain Georg Yardley, Sir Thomas
Gates his lieftenaunt, who se endeauours have ever deserved worthy
commendations in that employment. Rochdale Hundred by a cross pale, well nigh
four miles long, is also already impaled, with bordering houses all along the
pale, in which Hundred our hogs, and other cattle have twenty miles circuit
to graze in securely. The undertaking of the chief City deferred till their
Harvest be in, which once reaped, all hands shall be employed thereon, which Sir
Thomas Dale purposes, and he may with some labor effect his designs, to make
an impregnable retreat, against any foreign invasion, how powrefull so ever.

About fifty miles from this seat, on the other side of the Rivers, is James
town situate, upon a goodly and fertile Island: which although formerly
scandoled with unhealthful air, we have since approved as healthful as any
other place in the country: and this I can say by mine own experience, that
that corn and gardaine ground (which with much labor being when we first
seated upon it, a thick wood) we have cleared, and impaled, is as fertile as
any other we have had experience and trial off. The Town it self by the ca^e
and providence of Sir Thomos Gates, who for the most part had his chiefest
residence there, is reduced into a hansome form, and has in it two fair
rows of howses, all offramed Timber, two stories, and an upper Garret, or
Corn lof^ high, besides three large, and substantial Storehowses, joined
together in length some hundred and twenty foot, and in breadth forty, and
this town has been lately newly, and strongly impaled, and a fair platform
for Ornance in the west Bulworke raised: there are also without this town in
the Island, some very pleasant, and beutifull howses, two Blockhouses, to
observe and watch least the Indians at any time should swim over the back
river, and come into the Island, and certain other farm howses. The command
and government of this town, has master John Scarpe, Li^tenant to Captain
Francis West, Brother to the right Honorable, the Lord Lawarre.

From James town downwards, some forty and odd miles at the mouth of the
river, near Point Comfort, upon Kecoughtan, are two pleasant and commodious
Forts, Henry and Charles, goodly seats, and much corn ground about them,
abounding with the commodities of fish, foul, Dear, and fruits, whereby the
men live there, with half that maintenance out of the Store, which in other
places is allowed: certainly this habitation would be no whit inferior to the
best we have there, save, as yet, with the poor means we have; we cannot
secure it, if a foreign enemy, as we have just cans to expect daily should
attempt it. And of these Forts, Captain Georg We^ was lately establishd the
principal Commander.

It has been our greatest care, and labor hitherto, and yet but these three
years, the former four merely misspent, to compass these businesses, which
being thus settled, and brought to such perfection, as I have described, now
does the time approach, that commodity may be expected, and if means be sent
over, will assuredly be returned. What honest spirit, having hitherto labored
herein, would at the vpshot (as I may so term it) be discouraged or desist? I
hope none, rather more will be animated, (if need require) to put too their
helping hands and purses.

And even thus I have shaddowed I hope, without the guilt of tedious, or prolix
discourses (as I have been able) the trne condition (though many circumstances
omitted) of Virginia, what may the substance be, when the external show is so
forward, so glorious.

I have purposely omitted the relation of the Contry commodities, which every
former treatise has abundantly, the hope of the better mines, the more base,
as Iron, Allom, and such like, Perfectly discovered, and made trial off, and
surely of these things I cannot make so ample relation, as others, who in the
discovery of those affairs, have bin, then my self more often conversant,
only of the hopeful, and marchantable commodities of tobacco, silk grass,
and silk worms: I dare thus much affirm, and first of Tobacco, whose
goodness mine own experience and trial induces me to be such, that no country
under the Sun, may, or does afford more pleasant, sweet, and strong Tobacco,
then I have tasted there, even of mine own planting, which, howsoever being
then the first year of our trial thereof, we had not the knowledge to cure,
and make up, yet are there some now resident there, out of the last years well
observed experience, which both know, and I doubt not, wili make, and return
such Tobacco this yeer^, that eu^n England shall acknowledge the goodness
thereof.

Now I proceed to the silk grass which grows like unto our flax, I mean
not, of that kind fo^merly sent over, I have seen, even of the natural, and
wild plants, which Captain Martin, who much delights in those businesses,
has made, exceeding fine, and exceeding strong silk, and himself has
replanted many of the wild plants this year, the silk whereof he purposes
to return for trial.

The silk worms sent thither from England, in seeds the last winter, came
forth many of them the beginning of March, others in April, May, and June,
thousands of them grown to great bigness, and a spinning, and the rest well
thriuing of their increase, and commodity well known to be reaped by them, we
have all most assurance (since sure I am) no Country affoordeth more store of
Mulbery trees, or a kind with whose leaf they more delight, or thrive better.

It may be here happily expected, that I should give up the relation of
Captain Argalls particular voyages and endeavors, and even as in a Plat,
demonstrate his Norward discoueries, from which business I desire to be
excused, partly, because himself is best able to make his own relations, and
partly, because my home employments would not permit me leisure to accompany
him, though my self desirous, in any of his voyages, whose endeavors, if I
should endeavor to make known, and publish, could receive no honor at all by
my commendations, or descriptions: much might they be impaired, through my
ignorance, or vnskillfullnes to set them forth: yet cannot I omit to publish
to the world, what present relief he has don to the Colony, furnishing us by
two trading* voyages, with three and twenty hundred bushels of Corn, into our
store delivered: beside, what he reserved for his men's provision, what he
bestowed upon well deseruers, and what his men appropriated,

I pass by the benefit of peace iu those parts, by reason of his Captive
Pochahuntas, concluded established, and will only name the commodity by his
means done unto us, in repairing of our weatherbeten boats, and furnishing us
with new, b^th strong, and useful, without whose assistance heerin, unless
we should have omitted other necessary employments, I see not how we should
have had passage one to another.

His Norward discoueries toward Sacadeh^c, and beyond to Portroyall, Sancta*
Crux, and thereabout may not be concealed: In which his adventures, if he had
brought home no commodity to the Colony, (which yet he did very much, both of
apparel, victuals, and many other necessaries) the honor which he has done
unto our Nation, by displanting the French, there beginning to seat and
fortesie within our limits, and taking of their Ship and Pinnas, which he
brought to James Town, would have been reward enough for his pains, and will
ever speak loud his honor, and approue^ valor.

I have heard it credibly reported, even from the mouth of Captain Argall,
that in one small Ship, and in one voyage, the French have cle^red eight
thousand pounds by trade with the Indians, for ^^rs, which benefit will be as
easily by us procured.

It is true the Saluadges there inhabiting (before Captain Argalls arrival)
esteemed the French as Demy-Gods, and had them in great estimation: but seeing
them vanquished and ouercom by us, forsook the^, yea, which is no mean point
of policy, desired our friendship, telling Captain Argall, that he had
undone them for ever, for that the French by yeer^ly trade with them for
Furs, furnished them with ma^y necessaries, whereof they had great want,
which trade by this means might happily be hindered. But Captain Argall has
agreed with them to res^rue their Furr^s for him, and promised the^, once a
year to come thither, and truck with them: they seemed very well content,
assuring him, that though the French should at any time arrive there, and
proffer them trade, they would reserve all their Furs for him, and what profit
by this means only, may be returned to the Virginia adventurers, I submit to
Captain Argalls own oppinion and judgment.

I purrposely omitted one thing in the Treatise of our concluded peace,
wherewith I intend to conclud my discourse, which already I have drawn to a
longer period then I purposed, whereby we have gathered the better assurance,
of their ho^est inward intentions, and this it is.

It pleased Sir Thomas Dale (my self being much desirous before my return for
England, to visit Powhatan, and his Court, because I would be able to spea^
somewhat thereof by mine own knowledge) to employ my self, and a^ english boy
for my Interpreter on Thomas Saluage (who had lived three years with Powhatan,
and speaks the language naturally, one whom Powhatan much affects) upon a
message unto him, which was to deal with him, if by any means I might procure
a daughter of his, who ( Pochahuntas being already in our possession) is
generally reported to be his delight, and darling, and surely he esteems her
as his own soul) for surer pledge of peace.

I departed the fifteenth of May early in the morning, with the English Boy,
and two Indian guides, from the Bermudas, and came to his court or residence
(as I judge some three score miles distant from us, being seated at the h^^d
almost of Pama^nkie River, at a town called M^tchCot) the next night after,
about twelve of the clock, the former night lodging in the open woods,
feareles and without danger: when we were come oppo^^te to his Town, the
maine river between him and us, least at any time we should martch by land
unto him undiscovered: my Indian guides called f^r a Canoa (^ boat made only
of one tree, after the fashion of a hollow trough) to transport us, giving them
to know that there was two English sent upon business to Powhatan from the
English Weroance, which once known, a Canoa was presently sent, and we ferried
over, Powhatan himself attending at the landing place to welcome us. His first
salutation was to the Boy, whom he very well rem^mbred, after this manner: my
child you are welcome, you have bin a stranger to me these four years, at
what time I gave you leave to go to Paspahae (for so was James town called
before our seating there) to see your friends, and till now you never returned:
you (said he) are my child, by the donatiue of Captain Newport, in liew of one
of my subjects Namontacke, who I purposely sent to King James his land, to see
him and his country, and to return me the true report thereof, he as yet is
not returned, though many ships have arrived here from thence, since that time,
how ye have dealt with him I know not? having thus ended his speech to him, he
addressed himself to me, and his first salutation, without any words at all,
was about my neck, and with his hand he seeled round about it, so as I might
have imagined he would have cut my throat, but that I knew he durst not, he
asked me where the chain^ of pearl was, I demanded what chain: that, said
he, which I sent my Brother Sir Thomas Dale for a present, at his first
arrival * which chain, since the peace concluded, he sent me word, if he sent
any Englishman upon occasion of business to me, he should wear about his neck,
otherwise I had order from him to bind him and send him home again. It is
true Sir Thomas Dale had sent him such word (which till then my self never
heard of) and for this purpose had given his Page order to deliver me the said
chain, who forgot it: I was doubtful at the first how to answer him, yet
presently I replied that I was not ignorant of that message from his brother,
formerly sent unto him, whereby he only cutended that if upon extraordinary
and sudden occasion, he should be constrained to send an English man unto him
without an Indian guide, then in testimony that he sent him he should wear
the chain about his neck: but in case any of his own people should conduct
any English unto him, as did me, two of his own men, one of them a Counceller
unto him, who was acquainted with my business* their testimony should be
sufficient, and the chain then needelesse to be worn, which answer pleased
him well, and fourth with he brought us to his house, not full a stones cast
from the waterside, whereinto being come, himself sat down on his bedsteade
side, bed th^re was none mo^e then a single mat, on each hand of him was placed
a comely and personable young woman, not twenty yee^es old the eld^^^, which
they call his Queens, the house with in round about be^ set wi^h them, the
outside guarded with an hundred bowmen, with their quiuers of arrows at their
backs, which at all times, and places attend his person.

The first thing he offered us was a pipe of Tobacco, which they call
Pissimore, whereof himself first drank, and then gave it me, and when I had
drank what I pleased, I returned his pipe, which with his own hands he
vouchsafed to take from me: th^n began he to inquire how his Brother Sir Thomas
Dale fared, after that of his daughters welfare, her marriage, hi^ unknown
son, and how they liked, lived and loved together: I resolved him that his
brother was very well, and his daughter so well content that she would not
change her life to return and live with him, whereat he laughed heartily, and
said he was very glad of it. Now proceed (said he) to deliver the cause of
your unexpected coming; I certified him my message was private, to be
delivered to himself, without the presence of any, save one of his
Counceller^, by name Pepas^hicher, one of my guides, who was acquainted with my
business, he instantly comm^uded all, both men and women out of the house, his
two Queens only excepted, who upon no occasion whatsoever, may sequester
themselves. Now (said he) speak on, and my self by my interpreter thus begun,
Sir Thomas Dale your Brother, the principal commander of the English men, sends
you greeting of love and peace, on his part inviolable, and has in ^estimonie
thereof (by me sent you a worthy present, vid, two large pieces of copper,
five strings of white and blew beads, five wodden combs, ten fish-hookes, and
a pair of knives, all which I delivered him, one thing after another, that he
might have time to view each particular: He willed me also to certify you,
that when you pleased to send men, he would give you a great grinding stone: my
message and gift hitherto pleased him, I proceeded thus. The brute of the
exquesite perfection of your youngest daughter, being famous through all your
territories, has come to the hearing of your Brother Sir Thomas Dale, who for
this purpose has addressed me hither, to in^reate you by that brotherly
friendship you make profession of, to permit her (with me) to return unto him,
partly for the desire which himse^fe has, and partly for the desire her ^^^ter
has to see her of whom, if fame has not bin prodigal, as like enough it has
not, your brother (by your favor) would gladly make his nearest companion,
wife and bed^ellow (many times he would have interrupted my speech, which I
entreated him to hear out, and then if he pleased to return me answer) and
the reason hereof is, because being now friendly and firmly united together,
and made one people (as he supposes and believes) in the band of love, he
would make a natural union between us, principally because himself has
taken resolution to dwell in your country so long as he lives, and would
therefore not only have the firmest a^surance he may, of perpetual friendship
from you, but also hereby bind himself thereunto.

When I had thus made an end of speaking; the sooner by his often interruption,
I had no need to require his answer; which readily, and with no less gravity
he retu^ned thus.

I gladly accept your Kings salute of love and peace, which while I live I
shall exactly, both my self and subjects maintain and conserve: his pledges
thereof I receive with no less thanks, albeit they are not so ample; howbeit
himself a greater Weroance, as formerly Captain Newport, whom I very well
love, was accustomed to gratefie me with. But to the purpose, my daughter whom
my brother desires, I sold within these few days to be wife to a great
Weroance for two bushels of Roanoake (a small kind of beads) made of
oystershels, which they use and pass one to another, as we do money (a
cubits length valuing six pence) and it is true she is already gone with him,
three days journey from me. I replied that I knew his greatness and power to
be such, that if he pleased herein to gratify his Brother he might,
restoring the Roanoake without the imputation of Injustice, take hoame his
daughter again, the rather because she was not full twelve years old, and
therefore not marriageable: assuring him beside the band of peace, so much the
firmer he should have treble the prise of his daughter, in beads, Copper,
Hatch^ts and many other things more useful for him? his answer hereunto was,
that he loved his daughter as dear as his own life, and though he had many
Children, he delighted in none so much as in her, whom if he should nor often
behold, he could not possibly live, which she living with us he knew he could
not, having with himself resolved upon no terms whatsoever to put himself
into our hands, or come amongst us, and therefore entreated me to urge that
suite no further, but return his brother this answer.

I desire no firmer assurance of his friendship, then his promise which he has
already made unto me; from me, he has a pledge, one of my daughters, which so
long as she lives shall be sufficient, when she dies he shall have another
child of mine, but she yet lives: I hold it not a brotherly part of your
King, to desire to bereave me of two of my children at once; further give him
to understand, that if he had no pledge at all he should not need to distrust
any injury from me, o^ any under my subjection, there have bin too many of his
men and my killed, and by my occasion there shall never be more, I which have
power to performeit, have said it: no n^^'though I should have just occasion
offered, for I am now old, and would gladly end my days in peace, so as if
the English offer me injury, my country is large enough, I will remove my self
farther from you. Thus much I hope will satisfy my brother. Now because your
selves are weary, and I sleepie, we will thus end the discourse of this
business. Then called he one of his men, and willed him to get some bread for
us, himself the mean while telling us that they not expecting our coming, as
usually they do eat up all their other victnals, presently the bread was
brought in two great wodden bouls, the quantity of a bushel sod bread made up
round, of the bigness of a tenise b^ll, whereof we eat some few, and disposed
the rest to many of his hungry guarde which a^tended about us: when we had
eaten he caused to be fetch^d a great glass of sack, some three quarts or
better, which Captain Newport had given him six or seven years since,
carefully preserved by him, not much above a pint in all this time spent; and
gave each of us in a great oister shell some three spoonefuls; and so giving
order to one of his people to appoint us a house to lodge in, took his leave
for that night, and we departed. We had not bin half an hour in the house
before the fleas began so to torment us that we could not rest there, but went
forth, and under a broad oak, upon a mat reposed our selves that night no
sooner were we awakt and up in the morning, but Powhatan himself came to us,
and asked us how we fared, and immediately led us to his house, where was
provided for our breakefast a great bole of Indian pease and bea^es boiled
together, and as much bread as might have sufficed a dosen hungry men, about an
houer after boiled fresh fish, and not long after that roasted Oysters,
Creuises and Crabbes: his ^en in this time being abroad a hunting some
venison, others Turkeis and such like beasts and foul as their woods afforde,
who returned before ten of the clock with three does and a bucke, very good
and fat venison, and two great cock Turkeis, all which were dressed that day,
and supper ended, scarce a bone to be seen.

Whiles I yet remained there, by great chance came an English man thither,
almost three years before that time surprised, as he was at work near Fort
Henry, one William Parker grown so like both in complexion and habit to the
Indians, that I only knew him by his tongue to be an Englishman, he seemed
very ^oyfull so happily to meet me there. Of him when we often inquired, the
Indians ever told us that he fell sick and died, which till now we beleeued^
he entreated me to use my best endeavors to procure his return, which thing I
was purposed so soon as I knew him, and immediately went with him to Powhatan,
and told him that we credibly bel^eued that he was dead, but since it was
otherwise I must needs have him home, for my self of necessity must acquaint
his brother that I had seen him there: who if he returned not, would make
another voyage thither purposely for him: Powhatan seemed very much discontent,
and thus repli^d. You have one of my daughters with you, and I am therewith
well content, but you can no sooner see or ^now of any English man's being with
me, but you must have him away, or else bre^ke peace and friendship: If you
must needs have him, he shall go with you, but I will send no guides along
with you, so as if any ill befall you by the way, thank your selves. I
answered, that rather then I would go without him, I would go alone, the way
I kne^ well enough, and other dangers I feared not, since if I ^eturned not
safely, he must expect our revenge upon him and his people, giving him further
to know, that his brother our king might have just occasion to distrust his
love to him, by his slight respect of me, if he returned me home without
guides. He replied not hereunto, but in passion and coffeehouse from me, not
till suppe^time speaking any more unto me: when sending for me, he gave me
share of such cates as were for himself provided, and as good aspect and
countenance as before; but not a word concerning my return, till himself at
midnight coming to me, and the boy where we lay awaked us, and told me that
Pepaschech^r and another of his men, in the morning should accompany us home,
earnestly reque^^ing me to remember his brother to send him these particulars.
Ten pieces of Copper, a shauing kni^e, an iron frow to cleave bordes, a
grinding stone, not so big but four or five men may carryit, which would be
big enough for his use, two bone combs, such as Captain Newport had given
him; the wodden ones his own men can make: an hundred fish-hookes or if he
could spare it, rather a fishing saine, and a cat, and a dog, with which
things if his brother would furnish him, he would require his l^ue with the
return of skins: wherewith he was now altogether unfurnished (as he told
me) which yet I knew he was well stored with, but his disposition mistrustfull
and ielous, loves to be on the surer hand.

Wh^ he had delivered this^his message, he asked me if I will remembered every
paticular, which I must repeat to him for his assurance, and yet ^till doubtful
that I might forget any of them, he bade me write them down in such a Table
book as he showed me, which was a very fair one, I desired him, it being of no
use to him, to give it me: but he told me, it did him much good to show it to
strangers which came unto him: so in mine own Table book, I wrote down each
particular, and he departed.

In the morning, himself and we were timely stirring to be gone: to
breakefast first we went, with a good boiled Turkey, which ended, he gave us a
whole Turkey, besides that we left, and three baskets of bread to carry us
home, and when we were ^eady to depart, he gave each of us an excellent Bucks
skin, very well dressed, and white as snow, and s^nt his son and daughter
each of them one, demanding if I well remembered his answer to his brother,
which I repeated to him: I hope (laid he) this will give him good satisfaction,
if it do not? I will go three days iourny f^rther from him, and never see
English man more: if upon any other occasion he send to me again, I will
gladly ent^rtain his missiues, and to my power accomplish his just requests:
and even thus himself conducting us to the water sid^, he took leave of us,
and we of him: and about ten of the clock the next night after, we were come to
the Bermudas. This discourse I have briefly as I could, and as the matter
would permit, the rather related, to make known, how charie Powhatan is, of
the conservation of peace, a thing much desired, and I doubt not right welcome
news, to the undertakers here) as may appear by his answers to my requests,
and also by my safe passage thither, and homwards, without the lest show of
injury offered unto us, though diverse times^by the way, many stragliug Indians
met us, which in former times, would gladly have taken so ^aire occasion to
work their mischief and bloody^ designs upon us. By all which, as likewise
by our forward progression in our affairs, I hope such good success and
benefit to be speedily reaped, that ^y self, though I bless GOD for it, who
has so provided for me, that I may live more happily here, then many who are
fearful to adventure thither) could eu^n willingly make a third voyage
thither if by my poor endeauours the business might receive the least
furtherance. God, (I hope) will raise up means beyond man's imagination, to
perfect his own glory and honor, in the conversion of those people, of whom
undoubtedly, (as in all other parts in the world, he has predestined some to
eternal salvation, and blessed shall those be that are the instruments
thereof) I hope this poor Narration will move every honest heart, to put his
helping hand thereunto. For my part, as I have been five years a personal
workman in that building, so shall I ever, as my means may permit me, be
ready to offer my mite toward the furnishing of others, and again (if need
require) personal labor therein.

To the Reader.
THere be two properties especially remarkable, which should move all men
earnestly and constantly, with all their means and endeavor, to desire the
a^cheiuing of any thing, and bringing of the same unto perfection: first the
worth and excellency: secondly the durablenesse and continuance thereof. For
as that thing which is not durable, by reason of fragilitie and fugacitie, is
not usually esteemed of men, though it be excellent: so that likewise which is
not precious, is worthily little regarded, though it be never so durable. Now
the Virginian plantation has both these notable properties, if at the least we
will, and impeach them not our selves; for what is m^re excellent, more
precious and more glorious, then to convert a heathen Nation from worshipping
the devil, to the saying knowledge, and true worship of God in Christ Jesus?
what more praiseworthy and charitable, then to bring a savage people from
barbarism unto civi^^itie? what more honour^ble unto our ^^^ntre^, then to
reduce a far disioyned forraign^ nation, under the d^e obedience of our dread
Sovereign the Kings Majesty? what more convenient then to have good s^ates
abroad for our ever flowing multitudes of people at home? what more profitable
then to purchase great wealth, which most now adays gape after ouer-greedily?
All which benefits are assuredly to b^e had and obtained by well and
plentifully upholding of the plantatio^ in Virginia. And for the durablenesse
of all these great and singular blessings, there ^an (by Gods assistance) be no
doubt at all made, if men's hearts unto whom God has lent ability) were but
inla^ged cheerfully to adventure and send good companies of honest industrious
m^n thither with a mind to enlarge Christ's kingdom: for then will God
assuredly maintain his own cause. But alas, as there was never yet any action
so good. so honorable, so glorious, so pious and so profitable, but has had
checkes and disconr^gements, both by open enemies abroad, and intestine
adversaries at home with in it own bowels: even so may I truly say, has this
m^st glorious, most honorable, most pious and most profitable enterprise had.
For as of old, when Zerubbabel* Ezra and Nehemia returned from Babell, by
allowance of the king of Persia to Jerusalem, and began to repair the walls
thereof, and to restore Gods service, there wanted not a Sanballat and others
to say: what do these weak^ Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they
sa^crific^? will they fini^h it in a day? Noe, for although they build, yet if
a fox go up, he shall even break down that stony wall, Even so deal many
Sanballates and Tobiahes foreign and domestical enemies of this most
religious work: yea there be many who will not seem enemies thereunto, but
yet will neither further the business themselves, no not according to their
own engagements which in conscience and ^redit^ they ought) nor quietly suffer
others that otherwise ^old, but discourage them therein all they may some saying
as Judah once did. The strength of the bear^rs is weakened, and there is much
earth, so as we are not able to build^ the wall. Some s^ying with the
unfaithful Spies, sent forth to search the l^^d of Canaan: The land we went
t^rough to ^earch it out is a land that eats up the inhabitan^s th^reof, for
all the people we saw in it ar^ strong and m^n of ^reat stature: yea and some
others say, there is much already expended, and yet n^ profit arises, neither
is there victuals to be had, for the preserving of life and soul together. But
oh my dear countrie-men, be not so far bewitched herewith as to be still
discouraged thereat for t^ose that bring a vilde slauder upon this action, may
die by a plague before the Lord, as those men did: but rather remembering your
a^ncient worth, renown, valor and bounty, harken unto Caleb and Joshua, who
stilled the peoples mourning: saying, Let us go up at once and possess it,
for undoubtedly we shall overcome it; yet not so much now by force of arms as
the Israelites did then by warrant from God (nor by utterly destroying of them,
as some have cruelly done since) as by gentleness, love, amity and Religion.
As for profit it shall come abundantly, if we can with the husbandman, but
freely cast our corn into the ground, and with patience wait for a blessing.
And of victuals, there is now no complaint at all, and that which was happened by
the mere lasie negligence of our own people.

Now to the end that you may the better perceive these things to be true, and
be thereby the more animated cheerfully to go forward in the upholding of
this holy work, I will no longer detain you from the perusal of some Calebs
and Iosu^hs faithful reports (writ there in June last this present year 1614.
and sent hither by the last ship that came thence) for further encouragement
to put hereunto speedily and plentifully your helping hands with al^lacrity: As
for the that are able, and yet will not further, but indaunger the veter ruining
of this so glorious a cause (by their miserableness (being without love and
charity) to the great dishonor of God, and our Countries perpetual shame
should it now sink, and fall to the gonnd: I leave them to him that made them,
to dispose of them according to his infinite wisdom. And so come to the
letters themselves: the first and chiefest whereof is from Sir Thomas Dale,
Marshall and Governor of Virginia, unto a Minister of London.

To the R. and my most esteemed friend Mr.D.M. at his house at F. Chapter in
London.
RIght Reverend Sr. by Sr. Thomas Gates I wrote unto you, of such occasions as
then presented themselves, and now again by this worthy Gentleman Captain
Argall I salute you: for such is the reverend regard I have of you, as I cannot
omit any occasion to expres the sincere affection I bear you. You have ever
given me encouragements to persevere in this religious Warfare, until your last
Letters; not for that you are now less well affected thereunto: but because
you see the Action to be in danger by many of their non performances who under
took the business. I have undertaken, and have as faithfully, and with all my
might indeauored the prosecution with all allacrity, as God that knows the
heart, can bear me record, what recompense, or what rewards, by whom, or when
I know not where to expect; but from him in whose vineyard I labor, whose
Church with greedy appetite I desire to erect. My glorious master is gone,
Prince Henry
that would have ennamelled with his favors the labors I undertake, for Gods
cause, and his immortal honor. He was the great Captain of our Israel, the
hope to have builded up this heavenly new Jerusalem he interred (I think) the
whole frame of this business, fell into his grave: for most men's forward (at
least seeming so) desires a^e quenched, and Virginia stands in desperate
hazard. You there do your duties, I will no way omit mine, the time I promised
to labor, is expired: it is not a yoke of Oxen has drawn me from this feast:
it is not the marriage of a wife maks me have home, though that sall^t give an
appetite to cause me return. ^ut I have more care of the Stock, then to set it
upon a die, and rather put my self to the courtesy of noble and worthy
c^nsures then ruin this work; and have a jury (nay a million) of foul
mouthed detracters, scan upon my endeauours, the ends whereof they cannot diue
into. You shall briefly understand, what has betide since my last, and how we
now stand, and are likely to grow to perfection, if we be not altogether
^eglected, my stay grounded upon such reason, as had I now returned, it would
have hazarded the ruin of all.

Sir Thomas Gates having imbarqued himself for England, I put my self into
Captain Argalls ship, ^ith a hundred and fifty men in my frigot, and other
boats went into Pamaunkie river, where Powhatan has his residence, and can in
two or three days, draw a thousand men together, with me I carried his
daughter, who had been long ^risoner with us, it was a day or two before we
heard of them: At length they demanded why we came; I gave for answer that I
came to bring him his daughter, conditionally he would (as had been agreed upon
for her ransom) render all the arms, tools, swords, and men that had run
away, and give me a ^^ip full of co^ne, for the wrong (...) had done unto us:
if they would do this, we would be friends, if not burn all. They demanded
time to send to their King; I assented, I taking, they receiving two pledges,
to carry my message to Powhatan. All night my two men lay not far from the
water side, about noon the next day they told them the great King was three
days ^ourney off, that Opochankano was hard by, to whom they would have had
them deliver their message, saying, that what he agreed upon and did, the great
King would confirm. This Opocankano is brother to Powhatan, and is his and
their chief Captain: and one that can as soon (if not sooner) as Powhatan
command the men. But my men refused to do my message unto any saue^ Powhatan,
so they were brought back, and I s^nt theirs to them, they told me that they
would fetch Simons to me, who had thrice played the runnagate, those lies and
villainy much hindered our trade for corn: But they delayed us, so as we went a
shore they shot at us, we were not behind hand with them, killed some, hurt
others, marched into the land, burnt their houses, took their corn, and
quartered all night ashore.

The next day we went further up the river, they dogged us, and called to know
^hiter we went; we answered, to burn all, if they would not do as ^e
demanded, and had been agreed upon. They would they said, bring all the next
day so we for ba^e all hostility, went a s^ore, their men in good numbers
coming amongst us* but we were very cautious and stood to our arms. The Kings
daughter went ashore, but would not talk to any of them scarce to them of of
the best sort* and to them only; that if her father had loved her, he would
not value her less then old swords, pieces, or axes: wherefore she would still
dwell with the English men, who loved her. At last came one from Powhatan, who
told us, that Simons was run away, to Nonsowhaticond, which was a truth, as
^fterwards appeared, but that the other English man was dead, that proved a
lie: for since, Mr. Hamor, whom I employed to Powhatan brought him to me, our
pieces, swords, and tools within fifteen days, should be sent to James town,
with some corn, and that his daughter should be my child, and ever dwell
with me, desiring to be ever friends, and named such of his people, and
neighbor Kings, as he desired to be included, and have the benefit of the
peace, promising if any of our men came to him, without leave from me, he
would send them back: and that if any of his men stole from us, or killed our
cattle, he would send them to us to be punished as we thought fit. With
these conditions we returned, and within the time limited, part of our Arms
were sent, and 20. men with corn, and promised more, which he has also
sent. Opachankano desired I would call him friend, and that he might call me
so, saying he was a great Captain, and did always fight: that I was also a
great Captain, and therefore he loved me; and that my friends should be his
friends. So the bargain was made, and every eight or ten days, I have
messages and presents from him, with many apparances that he much desires to
continue friendship.

Now may you judge Sir, if the God of battles have not a helping hand in
this, that having our swords drawn, killing their men, burning their houses,
and taking their corn* yet they tendered us peace, and strive with all
allacrity to keep us in good oppinion of them; by which many benefits arise
unto us. First, part of our Arms, disgracefully lost long ago, (kept by the
Savages as Monuments and Trophies of our shames) redeliuered, some repair to
our honor. Our catle to increase, without danger of destroying, our men at
liberty, to hunt freely for venison, to fish, to do any thing else, or go any
vvhither, without danger; to follovv the husbanding of their corn securely,
whereof we have above five hundred Acres set, and God be praised, in more
forwardness, then any of the Indians, that I have seen, or heard off this
year, roots, and herbs we have in abundanue; all doubt of want is by Gods
blessing quite vanished, and much plenty expected. And which is not the least
material, we may by this peace, come to discover the country better, both by
our own trauells, and by the relation of the Savages, as we grow
infamiliarity with them,

Powhatans daughter I caused to be carefully instructed in Christian Religion,
who after she had made some good progress therein, renounced publicly her
country Idolatry, openly confessed her Christian faith, was, as she desired,
baptized, and is since married to an English Gentleman of good understanding,
(as by his letter unto me, coutaining the reasons for his marriage of her you
may perceive) an other knot to bind this peace the stronger. Her Father and
friends gave approbation to it, and her Uncle gave her to him in the Church:
she lives ciuilly and lovingly with him and I trust will increase in goodness,
as the knowledge of God increases in her. She will go into England with me,
and were it but the gayning of this one soul, I will think my time, toil,
and present stay well spent.

Since this accident the Governors and people of Checkahomanies, who are five
hundred bow-men, and better, a s^out and warlike Nation, have made means to
have us come unto them, and conclude a peace, where all the Governors would
meet me. They having thus three or four times importune^ me, I resolved to
go; so taking Captain Argall, with fifty men in myfrigot, and barge I went
thither: Captain Argall with forty men landed, I kept aboard for some reasons.
Upon the meeting they told Captain Argall they had longed to be friends, that
they had no King, but eight great men, who gouernd them. He told them that we
came to be friends, asked them if they would have King James to be their King,
and whether they would be his men? They after some conference between
themselves, seemed willing of both, demanding if we would fight against their
enemies, he told them that if any did them injury, they should sen^ me word,
and I would agree them, or if their ad^ersaries would not, t^en I would let
them have as many men as they would to help them: they liked well of that, and
told him that all their men should help us. All this being agreed upon, C.
Argall gave every Councellor a Ta^aha^k, and a piece of Copper, which was
kindly taken; they requested further, that if their boats should happen to meet
with our boats, and that they said they were the Chikahominy Englishmen, and
King James his men, we would let them pass: we agreed unto it, so that they
pronounced them selves English men, and King James his men, promising within
fift^en days to c^^e (...) James town to see me, and conclude these
condi^io^s, every b^wman being to give me as a Tribute to King James two
measures of Corn every harvest, the two measu^es containing two bushells and a
half. and I to give every bowman a small Tamahawke, and to every Counselor a
suit of red cloth, which did much please them. This people never acknowledged
any King, before; no nor ever would acknowledge Powhatan for their King, a
stout people they be, and a delicate seat they have.

Now Sir you see our conditions* you, and al worthy men may judge, whether it
would not be a grief to see these fair hopes frostbitten and these fresh
budding plants to wither? which had I returned, had assuredly followed: for
^eer is no one that the people would have to ^ouern them, but my self: for I
had now come away, had I not found a general desire in the best ^ort to
retu^ne for England: letter upon letter, request upon request from their
friends to return, so as I knew not upon whom to conf^rre the care of this
business in my absence, whom I thought fit was generally distas^ed, so as
seeing the eminent ensuing danger, should I have left this multitude, not yet
fully refined,, I am resolved to stay till ha^uest b^ got in, and then settle
things according to my poor understanding, and return: if in the interim there
come no authorized Governor from England.

Consider I pray you since things be brought to this pass, as you see, and
that I should have come ^way, ^f th^n through their factio^s, humors, mutinies,
or indiscretion of the Chiefes I had left behind, this should fall to ruin: I
then should receiu^ the (...); I incur the blame, for quitting the
P^antation, al^hough I might do it, both with my honor, my promised stay of
time being expired, an^ hau^ng vvarrant from my Soneraigne, the Kings Majesty:
but the (...) reasons moved me and that this action of such price, such
excellency and assured ^rofit to (...) own knowledge should not die to the
scorn of our Nation, and to give cause of laughter to the Papists that desire
cur^uine. I can assure you, no countr^y of the world affoordes more assured
hopes of infinite riches, which both by mi^e o^n p^^pl^s discovery, and the
relation of such Savages, whose fidelity^e have often found assures me.

Oh why should so many Princes, and noble men engage themselue^ and thereby
intermedling herein, have caused a number of so^es transport themselves, and be
transported hither? why should they (I say) relinquish this so glorious an
Action. for if their ends be to build God a Church, ^hey ought to persevere: if
otherwise, yet their honor ingageth them to be consiant. Howsoever they stand
affected, here is enough to content them, let their end^ be either for God, or
Mammon.

These things have animated me to stay for a little season, to leave those, I
am tied in conscience to return vnt^, to le^^e the assured benefits of my
other fortunes, the sweet society of my friends, and acquaintance, with all
m^ndall ^elightes, and reside here with much t^^moile, which I will constant^y
do, rather then see Gods glory diminished, my King and Country dishonored,
and these poor people, I have the charge of ruined* And so I beseech you to
answer for me, if you hear me taxed for my staying, as some may justly do,
and that these are my chief motives God I take to witness. Remember me, and
the c^use I have in hand, in your daily meditations, and reckon me in the
number of those that do sincerely love you and yours, and will ever rest in
all offices of a friend, to do you service.

From James town in Virginia the 18 of June, 1614. Thomas Dale.


To my very dear and loving Cosen M. G. Minister of the B. F. in London.
SIr the Colony here is much better. Sir Thomas Dale our religious and valiant
Geuernour, has now brought that to pass, which never before could be
effected. For by war upon our enemies, and kind usage of our friends, he
has brought them to seek for peace of us, which is made, and they dare not
break. But that which is best, one Pocahuntas or Matoa the daughter of
Powhatan, is married to an honest and discreet English Gentleman Master
Rolfe, and that after she had openly renounced her country Idolatry, confessed
the faith of Jesus Christ, and was baptized; which thing Sir Thomas Dale had
labored along time to ground in her.

Yet notvvithstanding, are the virtuous deeds of this worthy Knight, much
debased, by the letters which some wicked men have written from hence, and
especially by one C.^. If you hear any condemn this noble Knight, or do
fear to come hither, for those slanderous letters, you may upon my word
bouldly reprove them. You know that no malefactors can abide the face of the
Judge, but themselves scorning to be reproved, do prosecute vvithall haired;
all those that labor their amendment. I marvel much that any men of honest
life, should fear the sword of the magistrate, which is unsheathed only in
their defense.

But I (...) muse, that so fevv of our English Ministers that were so hot
against the Surplis and subscription: come hither where neither spoken of. Do
they not either vvilfully hide their Tallents, or keep themselves at home for
fear of loosing a fevv pleasures? Be there not any amongst them of Moses his
mind, and of the Apostles, that for sooke all to follovv Christ? But I refer
them to the Judge of all hearts, and to the King that shall reward every one
according to the gain of his Tallent. But you my cosen, hold fast that which
you: ^aue, and I though my promise of 3 years service to my country be expired,
will abide in my vocation here until I be lawfully called from hence. And so
betaking us all unto the mercies of God in Christ Jesus, I rest for ever.

Virginia June 18. 1614. Your most dear and loving cosen Alex. Whitakers.


The coppie of the Gentle-mans letters to Sir Thomas Da^e, that after married
Powhatans daughter, containing the reasons mou^ing him thereunto.
Honorable Sir, and most worthy Governor:
when your leisure shall best serve you to peruse these lines, I trust in God,
the beginning will not strike you into a greater admiration, then the end
will give you good content. It is a matter of no small moment, concerning my
own particular which here I impart unto you, and which touches me so
nearly, as the tenderness of my salvation. Howbeit I freely subject my self
to your grave and mature judgment, deliberation, approbation and
determination; assuring my self of your zealous admonitions, and godly
comforts, either persuading me to desist, or encouraging me to persist there in,
with a religious fear and godly care, for which (from the very instant, that
this began to root it self, within the secret bosom of my breast) my daily
and earnest prayers have bin, still are, and ever shall be proed forthwith as
sincere, a godly zeal, as I possiblely may to be directed, aided and governed
in all my thoughts, words and deeds, to the glory of God, and for my eternal
consolation. To persevere wherein I never had more need, nor (till now)
could ever imagine to have bin moved with the like occasion.

But (my case standing as it does) what better vvo^l^ly refuge can I here
seek, then to shelter my self under the safety of your favorable protection?
And did not my ease proceed from an unspotted conscience, I should not dare to
offer to your view and apr^oued judgment, these passions of my troubled
soul, so full of fear and trembling is hypocrisy and dissimulation. But
knovving my own innocence and godly feruor, in the whole prosecution hereof,
I doubt not of your benign acceptance, and clement construction. As for
malicious deprauers, and turbulet spirits, to whom nothing is tastful, but what
please^h their unsavory pallat, I pass not for them being well assured in my
persuasion (by the often trial and proving of my self, in my holiest
meditations and prayers) that I am called hereunto by the spirit of God; and it
shall be sufficient f^r me to be protected by your self in all virtuous and
pious endeavors. And for my more happy proceeding herein, my daily oblations
shall ever be addressed to bring to pass so good effects, that your self, and
all the world may truly say: This is the work of God, and it is marvelous in
our eyes.

But to avoid tedious preambles, and to come nearer the matter: first suffer
me with your patience, to svvcepe and make c^eane the way wherein I walk,
from all suspici^us and doubts, which may be covered therein, and faithfully
to re^eale unto yo^, what should move me hereunto.

Let therefore this my well adu^sed protestation, which here I make between
God and my own conscience, be a sufficient witness, at the dreadful day of
iugdement (when the secret of all m^ns hearts shall be opened) to condemn me
herein, if my chiefest intent and purpose be not* to strive with all my power
of body and mind, in the undertaking of so mighty a matter, no way led (so
far forth as man's weakness may permit) with the unbridled desire of
carnal affection: but for the good of this plantation for the honor of our
country, for the glory of God, for my own salvation, and for the converting
to the true knowledge of God and Jesus Christ, an unbelieving creatu^e, namely
Pokahuntas. To whom my hearty and best ^houghts are, and have a long time bin
so in^angled, and inthralled in so intricate a laborinth, that I vva^ even
awearied to unwind my self there^ut. But almighty God, who never fails
his, that truly inu^cate his holy name, has opened the gate, and led me by
the hand that I might plainly see and discern the safe paths wherein to
trea^e.

To you therefore (most noble Sir) the patron and Father of us in this country
do I utter the effects of this my settled and long continued affection (which
has made a mighty war in my meditations) and here I do truly relate, to
what issue this dangerous combat is come unto, wherein I have not only
examined, but throughle tried and pared my thoughts even to the quick, before
I could find any fit wholesome and ^apt applications to cure so dangerous an
ulcer I never failed to offer my daily and faithful prayers to ^od, for his
sacred and holy assistance, I forgot not to set before mine eyes the frailty of
mankind, his prones to evil, his indulgencie of wicked thoughts, with many
other imperfections wherein man is daily ensnared, and oftentimes overthrown,
and them compared to my p^es^nt estate. Nor was I ignorant of the heavy
displeasure which almighty God conceived against the sons of Levy and
Israel for marrying strange vviues, nor of the inconveniences which may
thereby arise, with other the like good motions which made me look about
warily and with good circumspection, into the grounds and principal
agitations, which thus should provoke me to be in love with one whose education
has bin rude, her manners barbarous, her generation accursed, and so
discrepant in all nurtriture from my self, that oftentimes with fear and
trembling, I have ended my private controversy with this: surely these are
wicked instigations, hatched by him who seeks and delights in man's
destruction; and so with fervent prayers to ^e ever preserved from such
diabolical assaults (as I took those to be) I have taken some rest.

Thus when I had thought I had obtained my peace and quietness, behold
another, but more gracious tentation has made breaches into my holiest and
strongest meditations; with which I have bin put to a new trial, in a
straighter manner then the former: for besides the many passions and
sufferings, which I have daily, hourly, yea and in my sleep in^ured, even
awaking me to astonishment, taxing me with remissness, and carelessness,
refusing and neglecting to perform the duty of a good Christian, pulling me
by the ear, and crying: why do not thou endeavor to make her a Christian?
And these have happened to my greater wonder, even when she has bin furthest
separated from me, which in common reason (were it not an undoubted work of
God) might breed forgetfulness of a far more worthy creature. Besides, I
say the holy spirit of God has often demanded of me, why I was created? If
not for transitory pleasures and worldly vanities, but to labor in the Lords
vineyard, there to sow and plant, to nourish and increase the fruits thereof,
daily adding with the good husband in the Gospel, somewhat to the tallent,
that in the end the fruits may be reaped, to the comfort of the laborer in
this life, and his salvation in the world to come? And if this be, as
undoubtedly this is, the service Jesus Christ requires of his best servant; w^
unto him that has these instruments of piety put into his ^ands, and wilfully
despises to work with them. Likewise, adding hereunto her great appearance of
love to me, her desire to be taught and instructed in the knowledge of God, her
capablenesse of understanding, her aptness and willingness to receive any
good impression, and also the spiritual, besides her own incitements stirring
me up hereunto.

What should I do? shall I be of so untoward a disposition, as to refuse to
lead the blind into the right way? Shall I be so unnatural, as not to give
bread to the hungry? or uncharitable, as not to cover the naked? Shall I
despise to actuate these pious duties of a Christian? Shall the base fear of
displeasing the world, ouerpower and with-holde me from reucaling unto man
these spiritual works of the Lord, which in my meditations and prayers, I
have daily made known unto him? God forbid. I assuredly trust he has thus
dealt with me for my eternal felicity, and for his glory: and I hope so to be
guided by his heavenly grace, that in the end by my faithful pains, and
christianlike labor, I shall atteine to that blessed promise, Pronounced by
that holy Prophet Daniell unto the righteous that bring many unto the knowledge
of God. Namely, that they shall shine like the stars forever and ever. A
sweeter comfort cannot be to a true Christian, nor a greater encouragement for
him to labor all the days of his life, in the performance thereof, nor a
greater game of consolation, to be desired at the hour of death, and in the
day of judgment.

Again by my reading, and conference with honest and religious persons, have
I rec^iued no small encouragement, besides s^rena mea conscientia, the
cleerenesse of my conscience, clean from the fi^th of impurity, quae est
instar^nuri ahenei, which is unto me, as a brazen wall. If I should set down
at large, the perturbations and godly motions, which have striuen within me,
I should but make a tedious and unnecessary volume. But I doubt not these shall
be sufficient both to certify you of my tr^^ intents, in discharging of my
duty to God, and to your self, to whose gracious providence I humbly submit
my self, for his glory, your honor, our Countries good, the benefit of this
Plantation, and for the converting of one unregenerate, to regeneration; which
I beseech God to grant, for his dear Son Christ Jesus his sake.

Now if the vulgar sort, who square all men's actions by the base rule of their
own filthiness, shall tax or taunt me in this my godly labor: let them know,
it is not any hungry appetite, to gorge my self with incontinency; sure (if I
would, and were so sensually incliued) I might satisfy such desire, though not
without a seared conscience, yet with Christians more pleasing to the eye,
and less fearful in the offense unlawfully committed. Nor am I in so
desperate an estate, that I regard not what becomes of me; nor am I out of
hope but one day to see my Country, nor so void of friends, nor mean in birth,
but there to obtain a match to my great content: nor have I ignorantly passed
over my hopes there, or regardlesly seek to loose the love of my friends, by
taking this course: I know them all, and have not rashly ouerslipped any.

But shall it please God thus to dispose of me (which I earnestly desire to
fulfill my ends before set down) I will heartely accept of it as a goaly
tax appointed me, and I will never cease, (God assisting me) until I have
accomplished, and brought to perfection so holy a work, in which I will
daily pray God to bless me, to mine, and her eternal happiness. And thus
desiring no longer to live, to en^oy the blessings of God, then this my
resolution does tend to such godly ends, as are by me before declared: not
doubting of your favorable acceptance, I take my leave, beseeching Almighty
God to rain down upon you, such plenitude of his heavenly graces, as your
heart can wish and desire, and so I rest,

At your command most willing to be disposed off John Rolfe.


VIrginia therefore standing now in such a goodly proportion, and fair
forwardness of thriuing, as it was never yet hitherto seen in, since it began
to be first planted: cannot but soon come to perfection, to the exceeding
great comfort of all well affected Christians, and no small profit of the
planters, and adventurers: if it be well seconded and supplied, with a good
number of able men: Wherefore, let none be hereafter unwilling all they may to
further this most honorable Action, and be forward to uphold and support it
from falling, by their speech, and countenance, and freely aduenturing thither,
both in their persons, and also by their purses, as God has enabled them. To
conclude, as Azariah said once to King Azah, Judah, and Benjamin, so say I unto
all. Be ye strong threfore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work
shall have a reward. And as the holy Apostle said to the Corinthians, Be ye
therefore steadfast, immovable, abundant always in the works of the Lord,
for as much as ye know your labor is not in vain in the Lord, let us not
therefore be vvearie of vvelldoing: for in due season, we shall reap, if
we faint not as the Apostle told the Galatians. Farewell.
