Loves Garland.

Love is a chain
whose linkes of gold,
Two hearts within
one Bosom hold.

In love this good
does still remain:
Though both do give
yet both do gain.

By Cupids bow, my weal or woe.
showing what a young man should most respect in his choice.
I love thy Beauty,
virtue most,
For virtues found
when beautie's loft.

No hap so hard,
As love debard.

A happy Breast*
Where Love does rest.

All perfect love,
Is from above.
The sight of this,
Deserves a kiss.

A constant heart
within a woman's breast
Is Ophir gold
Within an Iuory Chest.

Of such a treasure then
art thou possessed,
For thou have such a heart
in such a breast.

To me till death,
As dear as breath.

In thee a flame,
In me the same.

Where once I choose,
I nere refuse.

No cross so strange,
My Love shall change.

Pray take me kindly Mistress,
kiss me toe:
My Master swears
heel do as much for you.

Till that from thee,
I hope to gain:
All sweet is sower,
all pleasure pain.

Thy love my light:
Disdain my night.

Tell my Mistress
that a lover,
True as love it self
does love her.

Hand, heart, and all I have is thine:
Hand, heart, and all thou have, be mine.

As you find me, mind me.

Two hands, two feet,
Two ears, two eyes:
One tongue, one heart,
Where true Love lies.

Though from mine eye,
yet from my heart,
No distance ere
can make thee part.

Though absence be anoy,
Come it is a double joy.

Be true to me, as I to thee.



Nere joy the heart,
That seeks to part.

Fair as Venus, as Diana
Chaste and pure is my Susana.

Tell him that.

If woman should to man be woe,
She should not be what God did make her,
make her,
That was to be a helper so,
God then did give, man now does take her.
man now does take her.

Tell him that had my heart in chase,
And now at other game does fly,
Green sickness nere shall spoil my face,
Nor puling heigh-hoes wet mine eye.

I do rejoice, in thee my choice.

Since thy hot love sof quickly's done,
Do thou but go, I Will strive to run.

Flesh of my flesh, hone of my bone,
From onemade two, is two made one.

As true to thee,
As death to me.

If you deny, I wish to dye.

In trust, be just.

I live if I: if no I dye.

No bitter smart, can change my heart.
another.
Rather dye, then faith deny.

Not lust but love: as time shall prove.

To love as I do thee;
Is to love none but me.

Of all had things, a heart with wings
is still the worst:
And he that meets, with one so fleets,
of all is accursed.

A flying heart, a piercing dart,
does well deserve;
So be it with me, if I from thee
shall ever swerue.

Thou mine, I thine.

Be true to me, as I to thee.

She that of all does love thee dearest,
Does send the this which as you wearst;
And often do^ look on, think on me,
As I by thine do think on thee.

Till death divide, what ere betide.

The worlds a Lottery, my prize
A love that is fair, as chaste, as wise.

Love til beomes day in his prime,
Like Apollo, robbed in gold:
Though It have been as long as time,
Yet still is young, though time be old.

My promise past,
Shall ever last.

Thy Beauty much, thy Virtue such,
my heart has fir'de,
The first alone, is worse then none,
but both admirde.

Rose mary Rose, I send to thee,
In hope that thou will marry me:
Nothing can be sweet Rose,
More sweeter unto Harry,
Then marry Rose,
Sweeter then this Rose-mary.

Thy sweet commends again,
my sweetest Harry,
And sweet Rose water,
for thy sweet Rose-mary:
By which sweet Hal,
sweet Rose does let thee ses,
Thy loves as sweet to her,
as hers to thee.

To me by far more fair
is my fair Anne,
Then sweet cheekt Leda
with her silver Swanne
That I nere saw
but have the picture seen,
And wished my self between,
thine arms sweet Nanny.

Desire like fire, does still aspire.

Mine eye did see, my heart did choose,
True love does bind, till death does

Accept of this, my heart withal:
My love is great, though this be small.

This for a certain truth,
true love approoues:
The hearts not where it lives,
but where it loves.

Hearts content, can nere repent.

My heart and I, until I dye.

Not two, but one, till life be gone.

Bracelets I Will give, en brace lets ever:
Let Partlets go, for part lets never.

Love ever, or love never.
Simon Mattocke Sexton of great Wambleton, in the behalf of a youth of his
Parrish, to the fairest Milke-mayde in the next, sent to her pinned to the
Orange tawny top of a very fair pair of gloves of six pence.
My Love is set, to love thee still,
Then Nan remember thou thy will:
That William, good will to thee,
I long have borne, bear you with me

I hope my Willy makes no doubt,
I take in others keep him out:
No for thy sake I look my Wilkin
Pale as the payle, I use to milk in.
