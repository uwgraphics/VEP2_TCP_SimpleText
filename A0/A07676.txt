A Little and brief treatise, called the defense of women, and especially of
English women, made against the Schole house of women.

If the turtle dove
Be true in love
Uoyde of reason, than,
What shame is it,
if man has wit,
And hates a Woman?
Anno Domini.

To his synguler and especyall friend master Wyllyam Page, Secretary to Sir
Phillip hobdy, Edward More sends gretyng.
Calling to mind the saying of Salust, that they led their life like beasts
which pass their time in ydlenes. I could not choose (for as much as I hade a
little vacant time from study) but attempt some thing wherewith I might be
busyed* and when I could not in a pretye space bethink nor deuyse what little
work I might occupy my self with, that might be correspondent and agreeable
both unto my small leisure and time, and also unto the place wherein I was at
that present season (for I was in London) at last a book inteteled the Schole
house of women came unto my hands, wherein I had well hoped to have read some
notable gestes and acts of women (for so seemed the false and forged title
thereof to promise (but when I had well perused and over read the same, I found
the clean contrary. For much against my expectation I might vewe and see
theryn diverse and sundry reproachful thyngis spoken against women, not only
(as I thought (undeserved on their parts, but also most beastiall like on his
behalf which wrote the same. What creature comme and borne of a woman would so
spytefully write against them? what learned man can judge well of him? what
woman that knows him, can find in her heart to love him? And finally what
good and honest reader once reading the same will have any further desire or
delyght to peruse it. Of a vyper I think him to be borne, whose nature is to
know a sunder his dames belly before he comes forth, wheray she dies. But
perchance he in likewise, to avoid ydlenes, took that his work in hand,
truly better had it been for him (as Erasmus says) to have been idle then
evil occupied. And as in taking upon him that lewd enterp^yce he seemed to
play a found and folysh part: so in likewise in hiding of his name, he only
de^lared his wit, which if he had expressed, no less would women wonder at him
then the small birds at the Owl, no less would they hate him then the Ap^ the
snayle, no less would they abhor him the^ the lysard the serpent, and finally
no less would they judge of him then of Nero which caused his mothers womb to
be rypped (she living) to see the place where he lay in, I then for the
serue^t affection which I bare to women was desirous to write in their defense,
but first I began to consulte with my self weyther it were best so to do or
no, and I perceived that many and just causes did provoke me to write herein,
and again diverse did allure me to hold my peace, for as my god will and
affection to women the symplicitie, innoce^cie and vngiltynes of women, thesche
wyng of y^lenes, and the verite of the matter and cause exhorted me: so on ye
other side did my lack of wytt, learning and age allure me to the contrary
which were most mete and requisite in this behalf affirmyng it to be a matter
more mete and decent for a married man to entreat and write of, then for a
bachyler or prynkokes but of twenty years of age or little more. And more mete
in deed I thought it also for a married man, who in defen dyng of women might
partly gratyfye his own wife, whose honest behauyor sobernes wytt and true
love theryn semyng to be apparent, might redoune, and sound not a little to
his own honesty, and also would be a great increase of love between them
although they skant loved before. Now when I saw none such ready to take pains
and travail theryn I like blind bayard quite and clean forgettyng ye
impediments in me before named (that is to say) lack of wytt, learning, and age,
which, were most requysyte and needful for this purpose, ra^^ye and
vnaduysedlye took this enterpryce in hand (whereof I repent me not at all)
And because that I knew nor was acquaynted with no Lady nor worshypfull Gentle
woman in the Court, or else where to whom I might dedycate ye same as a thing
for the argument sake. (although not for the clerklyke handlyng thereof) most
^e^e and apt for their worshippes to behold and look on, you (...)en (...)
to mind of all men most worthy of this simple gyf^o, no^ only for that that
you are an especial fauorer of women, but also ^^cause you have showed and
declared your self always to be a synguler patron and defender of my simple
study. So now in like wise having no mystrust at all in you, but that as in
times past, so you will also accept and take in good worth this my small
present and gift, as a testymonyall of my good will unto you, being not
otherwise able to declare the same, for lack and want of worldly wealth. Thus
desyryng you to take so much pains at your most conuenyent leisure as to
correct and amend al such fautes as you wall find theryn, which although that
the work be but small, yet the number of them tho be excedyng great I dare
well affirm, I commit you to the tuystion of the blessed Trinytye, whom I
beseech all ways to preserve and keep you hole in soul and body to his will
and pleasure and (...) your own hearts desire, From Hambleden the xx. day of
Iulye. Anno domini M. D. L. U. II.

Edward More to him that wroth the book called the Schole howfe of women.
IF thy name were known, that wrytest in this sort,
By womenkind unnaturally, gyuyng evil report,
(Whom al men ought both young and old, defend with all their might,
Considering what they do deserve, of every living wight
As in there travail taken, sometimes with loss of life,
To brig such wretches to this world, which make not only strife
But being come to perfyte age, can skant give and a forde,
Unto their da^mes yt ^^ue the^ such, so much as one good word.)
ywys thou should exiled be, from women more and less,
And not without just cause, thou must thy self confess,
Onles as in thy book, so now thou list to lie,
Where are nothinges but railing iestes of the pore femynye.
Thy book intytled is the Scholehouse of women,
A^ed^ous thing for them to read, not pleasant unto men:
The style thereof declares no less, but that thou art right sage,
And lived have so long perdye, that now thou dotest for age,
Less marvel then it is, that if thy oath be spent.
And of each one rejected art and hated as the lent:
Though thy melancoly, thou can not else assuage,
No kind of way but only thus, on women for to rage.
Pean to be a folysh work, thou do testyfye
Which like a learned poet, by the figure onomatopei,
Tra^sformed thou have into pecock, as proud of his long tail,
Marck I pray the well, how much there thou do fail,
Pean is more like in sound in our mother tongue
To pehen then pecock, whose tail is not so long,
Nor set with sundry colors, nor of so pleasant hew,
That she does boast and brag theryn, is not this right kewe?
All men that learned be, allow the in no case,
All women eke that wytty be have cause to curse thy face
All maidens that vyrgynytye, do covet still to keep,
Through thy accusacyons, have now just cause to weep
All yongmen that intend, to live in Uenus law
I mean in matrymony, having of god the awe
May well deryde and mock thy folyw and lewd pranck
Wherein, I dare be bold to say, thou had more pain then thank
In married men such fear there is, and such contynuallawe
That most of them believe ywys they be of moses law
And fynaly to conclude, the best and eke the wourst,
For this thy foolysh entrepryse, may hold the well accursed.
Repent therefore repent I say, acknowledge ones thy fact,
Recant I read the, and confess, thy lewd and sinful act,
Which does not hurt to one, but all of each degree
Have cause to b^nd their brows thereat, as oft^ as they it see
Although to call it in again, it be now past thy hand
yet to recant ease thou shalt find, I will thou understand
For if that Judas perdan had asked by and by
Of god he had obtayued it, as scriptures testifye
Now to conclude and make an end, I will apply my wytt
In writing for good women all as is most meet and fit.
Finis.
Here begins the book called the Defense of Women,
made by Edward More.
VEnus unto the for help, good lady I do call,
For thou were wo^t to grant request, unto thy seruau^ts al,
Even as thou dyddest help always, Aeneas thine own child,
Apeasing the god Jupiter, with countenance so mylde,
That though that Juno to turme^t him, on Jupiter did prease,
Yet for the love he bare to the, did cause the wyndes to cease,
I pray the pray the muses all, to help my memory,
That I may have ensamples good, in defense of femynye,
Them to defend of diverse things as slanders many fold,
I have taken upon me, as a Champyan bold,
Replye that list against me I will them well Assure
To spend my time in their defense, whyse my life shall indu^
Although I want the grauytye, of Cato that was sage,
Which hard it is to find, in any of mine age,
And Ciceros eloquence is very hard to find
In a curtyer truly, according to my mind
Senecaes breife sentences, although that I do want
Within Curtius style keep me can I skant
yet Salust south in wrything truth, I trust I shall attain
And as directly as I can, declare my matter plain,
First I will make it manifest that women bear much blame
And men are more infaut, deseruyng still the same,
As the little cobwep takes the small fly,
The swallowe fleyng through easily passing by
And as the pore and nedy man hanged is sometime
When the rycher skapeth, for a greater crime,
So does the sely woman of each degree and sort
Run in slander vnde^erued, by means of men's report
Whereby this proue^be shows plain no less true then old
That they most often that w^rst may, the candle use to hold
This to be true, what better proof then by Eve may be brought
Which did Adam attempt, to do that thing was noughe
Did not the devil endeavor, to reclayme her to his fy^^e
Because he knew her feebleness, not able to resyst
What was ye deuel? man or woman I would some good deuyne
Would take the pains this questyon to us once to defyne
Aman, I think in deed, of Lucy^e^s own train
For of a woman dyuell, I never red certain
When Lucyfer first fill into the pyt of hell
At gods appointment for his pride therein still to dwell
There fell with him a number more of men, whose sodeyne fall
All women yet remaynyng here, may rue the time and all
Had not the serpent tempted Eve, who cold ^s sermyse?
So shamfull act to bring her forth of joyful paradyse
And besides all this, when she delivered had
To Adam the forbidden fruit, to taste and him had bad
She knew then no deceyt, I dare for her appose,
And Adam then to taste thereof, I thynk sure might have chose,
For she reherst the word, addyng no whyt more
To that the sinful serpent, had to her told before:
And if that he to Adam first, had cum, no dowt he might
Have tempted him a ^well as Eve this thing declares it right
Predestinate she was thereto, to withstand it, not knowing how
All Christen men ought to lament therefore I make abowe
And not to cast it in her teeth, and on her thus to jest,
A foul bird it is perdye defyleth his own nest
Wherefore came he to Eve? I have told you before
Her lack of strenght and nothing else, was caus^ of her forlore,
if lack of strength bew^y, wit, in women be detecte
At lies not in them, these said thing to correct
Nature fourmeth solks according is to gods will,
In god it lied and wan else then to make or spyll.
But Adam being ruler of see and eke of land
That Eve to him was subject, it may well now be skand
And having strenght sufficient, wanting no wght but grace
So would offend our savior Christ to lose that joyful place
Wherein he fell no woe, wherein did nothing mys
To lead his life in heavenly joy, who can say well by this
And yet men will transpose the fault to seely Eve
But no man that the troth does read, will them I thynk believe
Wherefore I trust I have, declared here at large
That fawth committed by the men, are laid to women's charge
Consydre now their ponishement appointed by our lord
To help my saynges somewhat, no dout it will acccorde
With danger of their lives, their children they do bear
Theyres ouerthrouges in labor, his meruell to hear
And after they be borne what dilygence they wse
To bring them up in fearing god; no labor they refuse,
And we do daily see suffyciently expressed
How nurses often wake when most men take their rest.
Would Jesus have been borne, of Mary vyrgyn myldee
And humbled him self to her as a loving child
Onles that they were innocent and as the do pretend
Styffe stowt nor arrogant, nor ready to offend
Alas may I say than, that any Christen man
Should write such things by women that since ye world began
I dare well say, they never did, nor yet so much as thought
How much to blame are men to say, that women be so naught
And them thus to vpbrayde, with their bar passing love,
with wa^ton eyes and sugared lips where (...) they move
with all their might and main, to follow wanton will
Wherein our poet does recyte, they have never their fill
How far from all the truth, how like it soundes a lie
By reasons more them one or two, thus may all men it try,
The hoter that the country is the proner to offend
And to venery, more like to condiscente,
The people are, and as I have often read
Where wives are ryfest, there, a man may best be speed.
And on the other party the colder that is.
The less desire and appetyte they have to do amysse
And besides all this, the fayrer that they be,
To more resort of men there is, them to behold and see
The more resort of men in danger son^r run
What daily drystes do men deuyse? until they have the^ wunne
with Rome make I comparison if I may be so bold
And England do affirm to be then it far passing cold,
Whereby I mean in deed that Romans are more bent
Then Englysh women be to such things to consent
Less wander they abroad, whereby the biting air
Can their bewty in no point dyminish and appayre
Which of sundry ways, the next way is of all
As I have showed a little before, customers to call
Where our Englysh women do spare themselfes no whyt
But up and down the fyeldes to and fro do flyt
The Ladies to the Court do daily take their traydes
Besides a train of seruyng men, accumpannied with maids
That be the wether foul, or be the wether fair
To wether being open their bewty must appayre
whereby a man may judge that of the people twain
In Englysh women to be more chaste, far then the Roman
This ^l^o I do note and think to be most true
That most of al by yelosy danger does ensue
To men (in min^ opynion) no people use it more
In lookyng st(...) unto their wives, as I have told before
Whereby it fares thus with them, to be a proverb ryfe
To judge the romayne harl^t, better then the wife
which use not so frequent in England whereby
we Englyshmen do well avoid that perlous yoperdye
Now o^ Romans have I read* innumerable good
As tyrff of all, of Lucres that came of noble blood
when Tarq^yn the proud, desired her company
Lyuy will the same affirm and testifye,
This Tar^uyn) whom I named) did prese to do that deed
which caused her and also him not very well to speed
First with fair words began he Lucr^s to entrete
And when they could not take affecte, then he began th threte
with his naked sword, to take away her life,
Alas good Brtitus where were thou? to succor then thy wife
And finally against her will Tarquyn lay her by
The crime is deedly for a king to do such vylany
which when by him was dun, away and he was gonne
She sends for her husband and kindred each one
And bearyng in her hand, with her a naked knyfe
In presence of them all, she ended there her life
But before she dyed as Lyuye does report
with a heavy heart (god wot) spoke after such a sort
O my husband dear why do I live this day
Sith that (but not wyllyngly) I have the now betraye
And most against my heart the gods do know right well
That fear of death and nothing else, was cause now that I fell
Tarquin the proud has rauyshed me this night
wherewith she wept full pyteously, her tears distilling bright
From her eyes, and sodeinly, did thrust into her heart
The knyfe, so ended she her life, in dedly woe and smarte
Alas, what heart so hard, as is the merble stone
if he had seen this doleful sight, would not have made gre^te moan
For her, who lyeng ded as white as any lylly
whose cruel death did plainly she wand for her testyfy
That she was boyde from vice, not guilty of that gylt
And yet in satysfaction her heart blud there she spylt
Lucres of Cu^hay^e also is come unto my mind
which to Curylans showed her self so kind
That being but a straynger borne and her deperted froe
Dyed for very sorrow, the story tells so,
why loved she an other, alas, sith she was wedde
Married she was against her will she had as leave ben dedde
As him to husband take, but that she might not choose
For ather friends commandment she durst him not refuse
So that not only she, but the other of her sort
Are to be lamented much, as boyde, of all cumforte
For of these twain they must do one, with god either needs gloss,
Orels if god they please, their parents strayt way lose,
(...) appy be they I say then, whose choice to choose is free
For though they have but little, no dought they shall agree
What say ye now to Ouyds wife, which banyshed to be
Desired much, and leave al things in Rome where she was free
With her husband to have gonne, to take such part as he
What faith there is in womankynde, a blind man may well see
Sulanna also and Judith with diverse others more
Out of scriptures cold I bring, but need requires not so,
For of forrayne examples these are enough to dew
yet shall I one recite which also is most true
A king there was yt in ye wars, had taken a grievous wound
His surgens had assured him, it would never be sound
Onles that all the nenom, that therein did lie hid
were sucked out by man's mouth the king said God forbydde
The Queen yt hearing, hold her pease until that it was night
When the king was sounder a sleep, yt hear him blow she might
Arose a^ softly as she could, and so by suchyng often
Had got the ^enom clean forth, that done, with clothes soft
She dressed him ^^ll handsomely, and wrapped it up again
And helede him with medycens so that he felth no pain
what dylygence would man require? what service of his wife
What pledge of love would he else have? then to save his life
with hassarde of her own which she ought most defend
Let men therefore remember this, and their evil tongues amend
The daughter two of Ioth, that lay their father by
Did in a good intend the world to multyply
And many things we read permitted were by good
In the old Testament and in the new forbode
For if the brother spared had the sister in those days
The world could not have been in crest I think no kind of ways
To come now to our cu^trey women, why should men in the^ dought
And say they be replete with vice since stranngers be without
Although that I have authors none, but all that I endight
Long since in author old, I have them read full right
Which being but payngans horn, I herein so much trust
That I believe assuredly they wryt nothing but just
And I my self but little more then. xx. years of age
An Englysh man borne also, by nature nothing sage
Onles I should declyne from all my progeny
Whose mirth their merry work, will show and testyfye
Sith my mother tongue I did well understand
I had no manner of delight in stories of this land
Which being true in deed, no marvel this at all
Though that my country wome^s acts, to mind I can not call
yet has there been within my time for need I cold them name
That for the love they bare to men, refused no kind of blame,
Thyr husbands whylest in prison lay, tra^sgressors of ye law
Deseruyng in beath for their offense, and being still in awe
Have presed to the prese, of the thych through and trust
As gree (...)child as they might go therein you may me trust
And never ceased until they came unto the rulers face
And meekely knelyng on their knees, obtained had their grace
And set their husbands free again who had none other hop^
To end their lives no kind of way but only by the rope
And in the time that Bullayne was, besegede with our hosts
I know yet certain that do live, that went out of our costs
Left their friends and kynsfolke elie to Bullayne took their way
Unto their husbands and their lovers, skant restyng night or day
Untyl they had accumplished their yourney with great pain
where w^^e one found her husband well. iiii. found their lovers slain
what heavy, hearts had they, that found their lovers dedde?
Small joy I think they would have had, another strayt to wed
what tears were shede by them? what syghinge from the heart?
what sudden sorrow, heaviness, anguish, gryef, and smarte?
Suffered those pore souls no pen can write, nor yet tongue well expres
Nor heart can think nor wit deuyse, the some of their distress,
As war is counted pleasant to them not tryeng the same
So many thynk it but a sport, to bear a lovers name
A lover to be named an easy thing perdye
And if they love unfeignedly, what love is they shall see
Unto the burning ^euer compare it I may well,
what ease there is therein, the sych thereof can tell
Of these two things if that the choice offree were to me
And that of them they one I must choose no remede
To be syc^e with love or else the plage to have
The plage I would first choose of b^th so god me save
The one within a week relesseth all the pain
The other in the heart till death does still remain
Although a lover might, accumplish nestores years
which lived three hundred winter long, in authors as appreares
Of love yet diverse time should feel the woe and smart
Thought more (...)uye then the ^edde lies at the lovers heart
As I my self may well assyrme, which tried have the same
And so may m^^ as well as I, that couht it now no game,
These things well wayed then if men of stomock stout
Say love to intollerabl^ I put you out of dout
Great ^e^uale it is I promise you that women's fe(...)
(...) able to ^eare out so well, their do^efull hea^^^^es
Alas their tendreharies were often like for to brast
(...) that tears of water sault di^illed from them (...)
yet some besides their selfs with love are often certain
Of them (more pyty is) with us th^re d^re^ (...)
(...) there is perchance that will of me enquire
Meruayling much that any man with love is set a fire
And women with the same may or can take ^^at^
Thinking it to be a thing which chances very rat^
For if that men and women love, why do they disagree
In consentyng each to other this danger they may (...)
This may be answered diverse* ways, and first of al by this
That not one man what degree, so ever that he is
To l^u^ a^^ynde of women, nor yet one woman can
Fie(...) in her heart (I dare well say) to fansy euer^ man
what avails it then how may he flee that pain,
(...) he love that woman well that loves him not a(...)
And on the other part of a woman's chance be so
Now may we then in like wy^e escape his pay(...) and ded^y wo^
Again if men presume to far, above their own degree
if that they love and can not speed, how can they then it ^lee
But men there be and not a few which do presen^e to love
And meaning nothing else but maidens minds to move
To love again to the e^^ent their purpose to obtain
which when they have, do draw away, and leave to love again
Thus with sundry dryftes are, maids and wives deceaue^
And often of their virgynite by men, maids are bereued
which being lostand gonne, what great loss can be
what better thing have maidens now, then their virginite
which causes the^ to wayle and weep as have they cause to iu^^
and though ye other mean good faith, does make the^ to mi^trust
Of like handling of a wydow. I can declare right well
Between Dydo and Ieneas, as Uyrgyll does it tell
A^neas Tro^e being won, and all the town was breut
Fled unto the sea, with troyans by consent
Council* help and and of Uenus the g^ddes
Of love that was and his mother as Poetetes do express^
Take shipping for to sail unto a land
which prophelies did show before should come into his hand
He so long lay upon the sea, his vytaill being spent
Arrived in good Dydoes land which when she hard she went
Unto him to her that was, a stranger as I read
And did obeysaunce, unto him, and home with her did led
As one that all nobility did very much regard
He wanted no good cheer y wis, no cost for him was sparde
Contin(...) ^e with all his men in her court certain days
An (...) them selfs well as Poet Uyrgyll says
Required Ieneas Dydoes love which when she granted had
And ^itayl^s to his ships be carried that she bad
Aen^a^ away sailed, skant byddyng her far well
Nor for his (...)tertainement thanked her oue dell,
At least wise c^m no more at her, nor yet unto her sent
which moved gentle Dydo much, and made her ^eartrelent
^emembryng that her bene^yt^es upon him so beshowed
Mere not regarded, but for them cruelte was showed
And that ^e^^eas noble was, she thought him to be just
And well the wist that now she had put her whole trust
In one that her deceived had, no marvel was it than
Though never after that she durst credyt any man
That Englyshme^ (...) maids also, have playde ye self same feat
I shall declare unto you here, but fy^ on all de^eat
Of Englyshmen upon a thine, there were in Scotland three,
which taken were as prisoners in prison put perdee,
And there were like to lie, the order of that land
To abide ny remedy, ye may well understand
(...)* they had their rasisons ^ayed which how it might arise,
without strendes, the sel^^s but poor, they cold not weldeuyse,
Untyll at last that one of them, more crafty then the rest
Had told his fellows to be done, what he thought was best
That is to wit that one of the^ which was the handsomes man
Should feign him (...) (...)ding sick, in ye best wise that he can
Of wha^ ^yfease think ye of layned love y wys*
which to be true, no dout at aly, ye may percyue by this
The ^^aler had a daughter, that was excedyng fair
Unto these Englysh men would diverse times repair
And (...) myth them of many things at last one of the three
Whose lot it was and chance the dyssembler to now to be
(The other twain with drawing them as was agreed before)
Upon ye ^aylers Daughter looked, and syghed wondrous sore,
And causyng her to sit him by, (as was his own report)
with (...) heart and cos^^^enaunce, spoke to her in this sort
A would I had in syelde bene^^ayen, but fortune would not so,
But that I should yet longer live in dedly pain and woe
All my cuntrymen, that ever prisoners were,
Did nener so vnguo yet heart with them, I know wellbere
For besides that impris^nment is odyous to the ^re
There is a thing which more then that does daily turme^t me,
In so much that I therewith in life could not remain
Onles that one thing now and then restored my life again,
My meaning and intent hereby, I would feign that you knew
I will my self declare yt plain, if that you wylbe true
And swear unto me by your faith, you will it not dysclose
But secretly within your breast, you shall the same repose,
She swear unto him by and by, that honest if it wear
No living creature on the earth* by her thereof should hear,
No dought (said he) I put in you, but credyt do your oath
Being bold to tell you that, before which I was loathe,
When I do prison first, among the rest was brought
For my hard handlyng here, took exceeding thought
But when I called to mind, for what cause here wely
They had as just a cause, to mourn, me though, as I
It chanced not long after, that, as we three sat here
Your beauty brighter then the son, unto me did appear
Reuolyng I then in my mind, my hard and cruel fate
On fortune could not choose but rail, for chau^ging mine estate
In my natyue country, of gentles come and borne
Here I lie replete with woe, as one that is forlorn
Besides all this, your love, so perced has my heart
That remedyles I wayle and weep, and dudble all my smarte
And sythes I am now bond, and led this careful life
Only may I wysh you, to be my lawful wife,
Desire (I would) and eke beseech of love,
Onles I knew assuredly I should you nothing move,
Being in this case, which if that I were free
your love unto an English man, you would not grant perdee
But grant that you cold love, me onles I were a large
How should I able be, of your to take the charge?
But if that I conveyed were, strayte out of this land
And safe in my country were, I will ye understand
And king were of the same, none on the earth but you
Should be the crowned Queen thereof, to god I make a vou,
What avails this my talk? to what purpose speak I this?
Since I know right well of you, that I shall mys,
But yet I can not choose, my heart does cause me so
Or else oppressed with carkes and cares I think would break in to
Now you have herd my case, consider well the same
Could you love an Englysh man, or do you hate the name,
In south be you assured, that if you can me favor
And unto husband take, I list not now to glauor
And even as I love you, so to love me again
you shall diminish all my grief, sorrow, thought and pain,
I shall you not forget, whilon that I live
Onles I speak even as I think, never may I thryue
Therewith he weeping fast, the tears distillyng fro
His eyes, gave her a Judas kiss, alas why did he so?
When she had herd him speak, the words expressed before
Thynkyng no less in deed but that he longed sore
And doted in her love, having no mystrust
But thought by his perplexity that he was very just
Her tender heart then melted to see him in that case
Wept and sobbed woundrous sore, that for a certain space,
She cold not speak one word, for sheddyng tears so fast
Her heart she thought immediately, would verily have ^rast
When she had cesed her weeping, and thagony was past
Pausyng with her self a while, said unto him at last
where yt you wysh your chance had been, before this to be slain
No cause there is ywys, that dye you should so feign,
And that your dobble improsoment, you lay unto my charge
yt lies in my pouer to set you now at large,
For whither you love your country, and set but light by me,
Or whyther you love us both a like, I can now set you free
And in accusing me, to hate the Englysh name,
Without a trial of the same, in deed you are to blame,
To answer you therefore, as dyrectly as I can
I had rather marry you, then a Scottysh man
And plyght me here your troth, for so I think it best
And I shall do the some, and grant you your request
Lead me with you home, and there do you me wed
According to your Englysh laws, to bourd and eke to bed
Money for our charges enough I shall prepare,
And for your sake the residue, shall the better fare,
He swore unto her oaths ryfe, that all things should be so
well said she to morrow night, we four, away will go
So when the night appointed came, the ^ayler took his rest
His Daughter took of money, as much as she thought best
The keys she stale away that lay under his hedde
The prison gate then openyng, away them three she led
which when they were escaped their peril and their pain,
As crafty kaytyfes worthy death, did send her back again,
ye moderators of the scoles, ye judges of the bench
was not this a heinous crime, to use a loving wench
Who for very love of one, did make them also free
And well contented was, with him away to flee
Leuyng country father, mother, brother kyf and kyn
But when she was betrayed, what sorrow was she in?
First, what was her fathers gryef? the prisoners being lost,
What sorrow to his heart? and to his purse what cost?
And when he knew his daughter to be led way,
In what a trance was he? no man I think can say
His wife and eke his son, and all the wenches kyn
Lamented much and did bewail, her foolysh part therein
And the sely wench, was in worst case of all
Not knowing for her life on her what should be fall
Wh^rfore she went not home again for fear as I do guess
But led her life till death did come, in woeful heauynes,
Thus may ye se expressed, the nature here of men,
And yet they will affirm women worse then them
Uyrgyll once appointed to have layen a woman by
Persuaded her thereto, there was no remedy
And when that she perceived, that he would have no nay.
So that you come this night (says she) I will your mid obey,
I my self do lie (quod she, in a chaumbre hye
And my husband lies beneth, in a chamber bye
wherefore I can not well deuyse, how in you may be brought
No kind of way but only thus, which now I have be thought
(...) will let down a basket, by a cord perdee,
By means whereof you sitting in, shall be drawn up to mee^
^yrgyll trusting so, his purpose to obtain
According as it was a greed, at night he came again,
Where he found the basket by a line let down in deed
And quyckly leping in trusted well to speed
When knowledge that she had, above, that Uyrgyll was therein
She plucked him half way up, that done to make a pyn
Of wood or some like thing, she put her self in ure
Whereunto she tied the rope for flydyng made it sure,
So that Uyrgyll when no way, escape knew how he might
Of force he was constrained there to tarry all the night
Untyll the next morninge, that it was broad light day
Where when that he es^yed was, al folks at him had play
Thus it is right euydent and manifestly she wede
That women are right honest, and men are very lewede
As touching the apparayll now, which women use to wear
Their verdyngalles and cassockes, the perting of their heaee
Wherewith that they wax proud our Pote says sure,
At home like dyuelles they be, abroad like aungelles pure,
These things lowfull to be, and tolerable toe,
By reasons good and probable, I shall it strayt ways shoe
A woman having nothing but at her husbands hand
That he thus maynteneth her it may now welbe skande
Who is then in most fau^t? who ought to bear the blame?
Not she that wears them, but he that byeth the same,
Tolerable not withstanding, that such apparayle is
What harm lied hid therein, I would feign know but this
First, to a cassocke (I am (...)) less cloth they do allow
Then to agonne or frocke, wherefore consider now?
More profyt is it far, less cost also perdye
Honest therefore his, it can none other be,
For Tully in his Offices, she weth by words expressed
That nothing can be profitable, onles it be honest,
To the parting of their hear and showing of the same,
if men do the like thing, why bear they then no blame?
In combing of their berdes, in strokyng them full often.
In wassyng them with wassyng balies, in lookyng all alofte
In plaitting of them diverse ways, in byndyng the^ in bands
Wherein their hole delyght always, consystes and stands
No marvel then though women lerning it of men
Do comb and plat their hear, and dress it now and then
yet women be dispraysed where men are most in fault
Examples such to give their wives, which they aco^pt so naught
if a precher should us teach, drunkenness to shun,
And hedlong to that vice, he him self should run,
Who were in most fault who were most worthy blame,
He that herd the sermon, or he that preced the same,
As touchi^g now their verdingalles, which do men much offe^de
I defer them not till now as hard for to defend
For as men in the other things have been in greatest crime,
So can I not hold them excused, at this present time,
Who first invented vardingalles it must be called to mind
And by whom also they were made, we must in likewise find
Taylers (as I guess) were the first founders then
What kind of people be they women or else men
The most of all our fashyous of garments which we use,
Of what so ever sort they be plain or else dyffuse,
Strangers them invent, of strangers them we learn
As by our Spanysh hose and shoes, a man may well dyscerne,
The french gowns and the Duche, which women use to were
And also their french hoodes, them broddyng of their hear,
From France and Flanders fet were, by merchandes of our land
They tought their wives to were yt saw it may be understand
For women trauaill not to see the countries far,
For although they would, their husbands yet would the^ thereof quite bar
But if there be anoueltye chanced in Almayne,
France, Flaunders, Italy, Portyngale, or Spain,
Or any other regyons where men have led their lives
At their coming home, they declare it to their wives,
And some for lack of news, some things they do deuyse
Accompting it a shame, there be some so precyse,
To know nothing al all and so long time to spend
Wherefore to bringes home novelties, they always do entend
And tolerable itys (the south to say) in those
That a yoyrney unto Rome, unto themselfes have chose,
For they that come from th^nce, as one does specyfye
May tell a lie or twain, by Romes authority,
what pride can the pore verdyngalles increase in women kind
The stuf that goes to the same, is easy for to find
As ^ustian or buckram, lystes and eke read cloth
A costly thing I promise you that men should be so wroth
Suppose, they be of velvet sylk or cloth of gold
what wyttyman is he? there with find fault that would
Although for money often times there is debat and strife
And for the same many a man in time has lost his life
Yet money is not evil, nor ought to bear no blame
The only fawt remainth in them, that do mysuse the sa^nt,
So garments, I affirm, what so euerthat they be,
Are decent for all wemenkinde, regarding their degree
As sone may a man, in a beggar find,
As proud an ^art as in a lord which grows out of kind
The proverb seems contrary to judge pride in the lord
For evil does a lords heart and a beggars purse accord
where excessyue talk is laid to women's charge,
And that men cast it in their teeth, their tongues to run at large
Grant it so to be, as it is not verily
But that they be thus staundred alas what remedy
yet were it but a small fault, in authors syd we ^ynde
True to be and credyble, words to be but wind,
Their tongues I think offended have, on earth no living man
And if they had, forthat that men, neither will nor can,
With them once bear, how far they run a^^raye
ye shall perceive if that ye note, sain^t Peter who does say,
ye men bear with your wyfes which weker vessels be,
But yet the weke the burden bear, as ye may herby see
Many husbands all the day, sytting at the wine,
At night coming relyng home as dronken as are swyne,
Their wyses thereof ashamed be, and the^ strayt way exhort
At home to tarry and be merry to flee all such resort
wherewith the men wax angry, their wyfes be so bold
And if they speak a little loud, men say strait away they skold
wherefore I marvel much and so do more then I
That women bear so great a blame, and no cause to be why
And finally to conclude, I have the greater ruth
That innoce^tes should slau^dred be, but time shall try the truth.

The Author to his Book
GO for thou little book, look with a smilyng cheer
To women shall thou well come be, thereof thou nedest not fear
if it be thy chance, our English Court to see,
Then unto our ladies there, I great them well by the,
Or if it be thy pleasure, in London to remain
Be have thy self so honestly, that none do the disdain
Or whither best it lyketh, the in the wyld cuntree
To dwell or every where a sui(...) to be,
To maidens, wydowes, wives of every degree
Obedient be and be unto them commanded have thou me,
Of any man do happen in country or in town
For prasing women kind, on the to cast a froune,
Thus may thou answer well, that all that thou have said
Are so true and manifest they can not be denayed,
Some again perchance will find fault with thy style
As rough rude and barbarous, nedyng the smitthes fyle
Tell them that neither age, nor wit that is in me
Can make a book more eloquent then this which no wtheys^,
Good will was it enforced me, to write this little book
Let the readers then thereof, on the meaning look,
With minds indifferent, let them the same well vewe,
Then shall they well pereyue and see, that I have written true
which if they shall deny^, their error will appear,
For Leuy Uyrgyll, Ouyd, will witness with me bear,
Of the other things which are, in this treatise showen
Some of them have I hard, the other have I known
The resydue by reason debated have I well,
As I do guess at least wise, that learned be can tell,
if any thing vndicent or rude be (...) my rym^,
Let them impute the same, to bryefnes of the time,
if flattery alleged be and laid unto my charge
That to please womenkynde I have written so large
In the disprayse of men, which I ought not have dun
For that I am a man, and into danger run
Perhaps I am, yet let men note well this one thing
That they that I have named have been of vicious lyuinge
As Adam and Aeneas with the three Englysh men
That in Scotland prysouers were, let us merke well then
The acts of all these five; for which I have them blamed
In Oxforde in Cambridge, I think not one that named
Might be which could by reason good defend
Or they^^ lewd pagentes played so much as ones commend,
For sooner may a man by sophystry wellproue,
The mouse and the O^^phant very well to love,
Between foxes and gese perpetual amyte
To wo^es and the lambs, vnfaynede friends to be
Then their deceytes to womenkinde before by me expressed,
May by any learned man be proved to be honest
I do not therefore repent my self, that I have on me take
This light and easy enterprise for all good women's sake
Although I know assuredly that diverse will evil talk
I am nothing (...)aid there with, sith god on earth did walk
And could not please nor satisfye all men no kind of way
Shall I then look to do that thing that god cold not do, nay
Wherefore though goodmen do it praise, and evil do disco^mende
It forces not (the truth to say) and thus I make an end.
FINIS.
