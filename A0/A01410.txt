CERTAIN Works of Galens, called METHODVS MEDENDI, with a brief Declaration
of the worthy Art of Medicine, the Office of a Surgeon, and an Epitome of
the third book of Galen, of Natural Faculties: all translated into English,
by Thomas Gale Master in Chirurgerie.

AT LONDON Printed by Thomas East, dwelling between Paul's Wharfe and Baynards
Castle. 1586.

TO THE RIGHT Honorable, Sir Henry Neuell Knight, Lord a Burgauene, and his
singular good Lord, etc.
FOrsmuch, my singular good Lord, as I have perceived you to be naturally
inclined to the art of Medicine, and chiefelie to have understanding in that
part, which is commonly called Chirurgerie, I have not been a little careful
since my acquaintance with your Lordship, to further you in the same study,
even to the uttermost of my power, and forasmuch as you have so profited, not
only in the Theorike part, but also in the practike, I have thought all my
pains and labors well bestowed. And although I should hold my peace, and say
nothing herein, yet a great number of poor men, and others, which have been
cured of your Lordship, of many sundry griefs and diseases, will set abroad
and bewraie your notorious and charitable deeds. And forasmuch as your Honor
has better understanding in this worthy art, than a great many of those
which take upon them the name of Chirurgions, I might very well say, the most
part. And forasmuch as your Lordship bears such a singular love unto the
same art, I am therefore moved to dedicate these my simple travails unto your
Honor, to be the patron and defender thereof, for I do perceive, that now
in our time no good enterprise can be gone about, but false detraction and
envy is like to overthrow the same, which has moved me for as much as you
are a noble man, the rather to dedicate my travails unto your Honor, to be
my aid and succor in the defending of this my small travail, which I protest
I have not taken in hand, neither for vain glory, neither yet for any
worldly profit or gain, for since the first time that I began to set out
any part of this art in our English tongue, I have both sustained great
displeasure, and also lost many profits, of those which were in times past my
special friends, and the greatest matter that they have to say against me,
is only that I go about to make every body cunning in the art of
medicine, with setting forth of these my works in the English tongue, but if
it shall please your good Lordshippe to understand my bounden duty, first to
almighty God, of whom I have received the talent, and also my duty to my
natural Country, whom I ought to profit with my talent, according to the
saying of our savior Jesus Christ, which says, He that hides his talent in
the ground, and uses it not to the profit of his neighbor, it shall be taken
from him again. Wherefore my good Lord, I think it my duty to set forth
these things for the commodity of the common wealth of my Country. What
greater profit may come unto any in the time of need, than to cure his
grievous wounds, without which he should presently die: to cure his grievous
sores, which does not only eat the flesh, but fretteth and rotteth in
sunder the great bones, with most vehement grief and pain, and also great
inflammations, and tumors against Nature, which takes away the natural
actions of the body, and molesteth it with most vehement and continual pain,
and also curing of broken bones, and bones being out of joint, to restore them
into their natural places again, with many other griefs appertaining to the
same art which were here to long to be recited.

And for as much as many have taken upon them the curation of these diseases
above said, and have committed many great errors for lack of knowledge, to no
small danger of Gods people, and no less hurt of the commonwealth, I have
thought it therefore my bounden duty, to set forth my only one talent in
furthering of knowledge, even as the poor widow did, which had but only one
farthing, and put the same into the Lords treasure, and like as that same was
accepted with almighty God, so I trust he will accept this my good will,
according to the knowledge which he has given me, so that at the last day, I
trust he shall not say unto me, thou have hid thy talent in the ground, and
not profited therewith as thou should have done.

And also I trust that good men of my Country shall have no cause to have an
evil opinion in me, either through negligence or idleness, for that they may
well perceive that these travails do both require study and time of setting
forth. Now my singular good Lord, if they shall say it is not good because it
is in the English tongue, then I must allege unto them the famous men which
were the chief setters forth of the same art, as Hippocrates and Galen amongst
the Grecians, whatsoever they might understand by foreine languages, either
else gather by reason, or by experience, or observation of time, all these,
whatsoever they were, they did write them in Greek, which was their own
language and tongue, to that end, they might the better be understood, and
sooner be learned. Also in like manner the worthy Arabians, as that noble
king Auicen, Auerois, Albucasis, Mesue, and a great sort more of worthy men,
which did collect and translate many noble works of Medicine out of the
Greek tongue, the Ebrue tongue, and many other languages, into their own
natural tongue, which was then the Arabian tongue. In like manner the
Latinists were no less diligent to collect and gather, both out of the Greek
and Arabian tongue, and wrote it in their own tongue, as you may read in the
works of those famous men, Plinius and Cornelius Celsus, with many other
more, whose works are manifest at this present day: If these worthy men have
been moved with good conscience for knowledge sake, and for the better
maintenance of their common wealth, in setting forth of this art for the
relief, comfort, succor, help, and health, of those that be sick and
diseased, or other ways wounded or hurt, in war, or by mischaunce, etc. Why
should not I then without blame or reproach, for the furtherance of knowledge
and other necessary things above rehearsed, set forth in our English tongue,
some part of this good and necessary art, for the instruction and further
knowledge of those young students, which are desirous to learn the same, and
to use the same to the profit of the common wealth in the time of necessity,
I do not mean, that honest Artists, as Tailers, Shoomakers, Weauers, or any
other handie occupations, that they should leave their arts wherein they are
perfect, and fall to this art of Medicine, for I do wish with all my heart,
that politic laws might be made, to constrain every man to follow that art,
in which he has been well instructed and brought up in. But my meaning is,
only to instruct those that be brought up in the art of Surgerie under some
experimenters, who has little learning in the tongues, and yet desirous to
attain knowledge, and forasmuch as these experimenters are permitted by laws
to occupy the art of Surgerie, I thought it my bounden duty, both for the
furtheraunce of their knowledge, and also for the relief of these that be
diseased, to set forth this in the English tongue which I have done, I do not
go about to instruct those which be great learned men, and understands the
tongues, neither yet do I go about to satisfy the mind of those that be
contentious and captious, that will rather find fault with other men's doings,
than to further those that be willing to learn with their good doings. My
intent is only to further those that be willing to learn, which with humble
and gentle heart do accept and take in good part other men's great pain and
travails, and forasmuch as Prentises and young men, which have not been
trained up in schools, neither yet can understand the Greek or Latin tongue,
and yet can understand and read English very well, and be of ready wit and
good memory, to carry away that they read and hear: It has moved me
therefore the rather to write these books in the English tongue, and forasmuch
as the foundation of art does consist only in reason and experience, neither
can there be any third thing added thereunto, as Gale^ affirms in his 3.
book, named Therapeuticon, It seems to me therefore, that he which
understands any tongue, whether it be Greek, Latin, or English, it serves
him no more but for the further understanding of that thing which he does
read: for it does not follow, that every one which can speak Greek, Latin, or
Ebru, by and by to be a good divine, or perfectly to understand the Art of
Medicine, for the common people amongst the Gretians, spoke the Greek tongue,
and so in other countries, which speaks their language, and yet neither
Divines, neither yet Physicians, therefore it does manifestly apeare by Galen,
that the tongues makes not an Artist, but reasonable knowledge being joined
with experience, makes the Artist, so that in what tongue soever a man may
gather knowledge, whether it be Greek, Ebru, Latin, English, or what other
language soever it be, that same knowledge being joined with reason and
experience, makes a perfect Artist: yet my good Lord, I would wish that he
that should be a Surgeon, should understand the tongues, for as much as in
times past they have been more diligent, and careful to further their common
welthes in those countries, then they be in ours, by means whereof they have
brought many noble Arts into their own tongues, which we have not so largely
set forth in our English tongue.

Therefore if the professors of Chirurgerie were learned in these tongues, they
might more easily understand the principles of their Art, with their true
divisions, and definitions which should the more readier instruct them to
follow a true method, and this has been one cause which has moved me to take
this matter in hand. Thus most humbly beseeching your Lordship to take these
books, the fruits of my painful travails, into your noble protection, and
defend both them and me your poor suppliant, from the malice of busy
detracters, and I shall not only be the better encouraged to set forth other
things according to my knowledge for the furtheraunce of the common wealth, but
also as my duty requires to pray unto the almighty Lord, for your Lordships
long life, perfect health, and daily increase of honor.

At my poor house in London, the.vij. of Nouemb. 1566. Your honors always to
command during his life, Thomas Gale Surgeon.

GO forth my painful book,
Thou art no longer mine:
Each man may on thee look,
The shame or praise is thine.
Thou might with me remain,
And so eschew all blame,
But since thou would so feign,
Go forth in Gods name.
And seek thou for no praise,
No thank nor yet reward,
Nor each man for to please,
Have thou no great regard.
For as to pleasure many,
I have been ever glad,
Right so to displease any,
I would be loath and sad.
The labor has been mine,
The travail and the pain,
Reproaches shall be thine,
To bear we must be feign.
But if thou please the best,
And such as be of skill,
I pass not for the rest,
Good men except good will.
FINIS.
Thomas Gale Master in Chirurgerie, unto those young men which are desirous of
knowledge, and are studious in the Art of Chirurgerie.
IN the name of the blessed Trinity, I for the health of mankind, have with
great pains and travail, collected and gathered together certain parts of
the Art of Medicine, and have put the same into sundry books, for that end,
they might be the better understood, and for as much as there be many young
men desirous of knowledge in this Art, and few of them learned in the Latin
or Greek tongue. Therefore, I with the help of my friends, have set forth
these books in English. This part which I have set forth, is commonly called
Chirurgerie, for that it does cure by the ministering of convenient medicines
with the hand. And for as much as diverse and sundry persons, takes upon them
to use the same Art, having little skill in the principles or right use
thereof, and some of the same do dwell far from Cities and good Towns,
wherefore they cannot have such counsel as is needful to be had, when great
and dangerous cures chances into their hands.

Therefore I have set forth and published abroad, both for your better
understanding, and also safeguard of Gods people, these woorks, desiring you
most heartily to give God the praise and thanks therefore, and as for my part, I
have done but my duty, in furthering of the commonwealth in this my profession
and Art, requiring you in the name of Almighty God, that when great and
dangerous cures happens into your hands, not only to be circumspect to
trust in your own doings, but also to take counsel of other ancient and
grave men that have had good experience, for in so doing, it shall not be only
a help unto the Patient, but also unto your own selves, for in seeing of
other cunning men's works, you shall learn and see those things, which you
did never know nor see before: and further more, the common people shall have a
good opinion in you, for that you disdain not to take counsel of other
expert men.

Thus I leave to trouble you any further, committing this my doing unto your
judgment, desiring you to take it in as good part as I offer it unto you, and
diligently to read all these books often times over, and then I trust you
shall find such commodity and profit thereby, as shall redound unto your
perpetual good name and fame, and to the safeguard of many people, which other
ways through your ignorance and lack of knowledge, might utterly perish.

Thus I beseech the eternal God to bless us all, and to give us grace to
honor and praise his holy name, and to travail in this our vocation and Art,
truly, rightly, and without deceit, so that it may be to the glory of God, to
the commonwealth, and your further knowledge: and finally, to the health and
safeguard of the people, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

FINIS.
A brief declaration, of the worthy Art of Medicine, and of the inuenters of
the same, and of the parts and names that it is divided into, and to what end
it serves.
THE m^ famous and ancient authors, does manifestly affirm, that the art of
Medecin, was given to mankind, by the almighty Lord God, that it might help
our weke and frail nature, in the time of most grievous sickness, sent unto us
for our sins, for if we should always remain in health, and in good and
perfect state, neither should we know our selves, neither yet the great might,
and power, of the Lord God, which does both give health, and sickness, neither
should we seek out the virtue of his creatures, as herbs, trees, stones,
metals, mineralls, beasts, fowls, fishes, and all other things, that crepeth
on the face of the earth, which has receued of the high and mighty Lord,
both qualities, and properties, to help, and cure, most grievous diseases,
being rightly aplied and used, according to reason, and experience, and for as
much as we do see, that mankind is altered, overthrown, and corrupted,
through ye fraylnesse of nature, by means whereof, we cannot always remain in
health, we are therefore driven by necessity, to seek out those things,
which may restore us again unto health. Health is restored by ye virtue of
medecines, and the virtue of medecines, was found out by long experience:
experience, and reason, being joined together, makes an art, and this art by
the common consent, and testimony, of all authors, is the most worthy,
honorable, and most profitable, in all the world: For like as man, which is
subject to this art, or the matter, whereupon the artest does work, is most
excellent amongst all creatures, both in the sight of God, his creature, and in
the sight of the world, so is the artist, which works upon his body, most
excellent, both in the sight of God, and in the sight of Princes, wherefore,
Solomon did say, Honora medicum, pro necessitate, for ye highest Lord has
created him, for thy help and health. Here it is manifest, that this art is
most noble, for that it takes her beginning and foundation of the omnipotent
God, as it does more manifestly apeare, in the creation of the world, for the
Lord God commanded the earth, to bring forth all manner of herbs, fruitful
trees, and all other things, necessary for mankind, that he might have the
use of them, to his sustenance, for the defense of his life, and that he might
by the same things, put away grievous diseases: wherefore the most wise
Hebrecion Jesus Sirach, did say, Medecin does proceed from the most highest,
and the ancient and most wise men of the land, have brought it forth, and he
that is wise, will not abhor it. What can be spoken more in the commendacion
of this art, or who dare say, that it is not worthy to be commended, seeing
that these words are spoken by the spirit of God, in these holy men, Saint
Paul does say, that the gift of healing is the gift of the holy Ghost, and
Jesus Christ the son of God, did minister in this Art, and cured many
people, by means whereof, it does most manifestly apeare, that it is in
estimation, both with God, and man. If I shall speak of familiar examples,
which daily chances before our eyes, as in those which be infected with most
grievous sickness, who has neither comfort, nor joy, of all their worldly
goods, neither yet has any space, without torme^ting pain, to eat their
meat. The grievous and bloody wounds, of those that be in battle, which
should perish without present help, if it were not for this Art, and many
other, which daily be brought to health, of innumerable diseases. Let all
these, declare the benefit of God, in receiving the commodity, of this Art,
let them testify, I say, what it is, to be lightened from so great evils,
from so great fear of death, and many times, from death it self: how
profitable, how honorable, and how worthy, this art is, let them declare.
There be diverse opinions, of the first invention of this art, for some suppose,
it was first found out emongst the Egiptia^s, and other some say, yt the
Hebrews did first invent it, and some suppose the Grecians to be the chief
founders thereof, but if we may believe Herodotus or Diodorus, they say that
the Egyptians were the first inuenters and seekers out of the nature of
herbs, and other things, to cure griefs and diseases withal, and that they
challenge unto themselves the chief preferment for the antiquity of medicine,
and also to be the first inuenters of the worthy art of Astronomy, as it may
appear by their books which they have written of the course of all the
Stars. And they have brought to light what things were profitable to living
creatures, by inuenting and exercising of diverse arts, as Medicine,
Astronomy, Music, and Arithmetike, and the worthy tillage of the ground was
invented by them. Also Diodorus has given this honor or victory unto
Mercury, and he does attribute the inuenting of Medicine unto him. Osiris the
son of Saturnus, for his excellent wit, extolled him with great honor, for
the inuenting of so many noble arts, the which things Strabus does seem
plainly to confirm in the last book of his Geografie.

Where as he does also write great commendations of the fruitful ground of
Egypt, for that it does bring forth abundantly all manner of things
necessary for the art of medicine, which does excel in such plentifulnesse,
that no Country is to be compared unto it. And he supposes that Mercurius
Trimegistus was the first that found out the nature, properties, and qualities
of herbs, fruits, trees, roots, mettalls, stones, and many other things
appertaining unto the art of Medicine, he had diverse men appointed to be at
his commandment, by the king of Egypt, whose name was Apis, which men did
continually travail in seeking of herbs and other things throughout all
Egypt, and brought the said things unto Mercurius, and he made experiments and
trials upon them, and did wonderful great things by their virtues and
properties, and afterward devised and invented letters, and joined them so
together, by marvelous art, and taught them in such sort, unto his disciples
or scholars, that they did perfectly understand them, and did write, and read
their own language, in such a perfect sort, that in short time, throughout all
the country, they sent letters, one to an other, wherein one understood an
others mind, then Mercurius, for as much as he saw such virtue, in herbs and
other things, as is aforesaid, and how profitable they were, for mankind, in
helping of diseases, wounds, pestilence, and many other things, wherewith,
many people in that country were afflicted, he having compassion upon them,
and minding, to leave a perpetual remembrance in writing, of the natures, and
properties of those herbs, and other things aforesaid, and what diseases they
served for. He called upon the eternal Gods, to strengthen, and assist him in
his enterprise, with wisdom, and cunning, and with length of time, that he
might set forth these things, to their everlasting praise, and to the
universal profit, and commodity of mankind.

And so he began to write, and wrote four books, in tables of wood, as
Strabus, does affirm: and some says, that those tables endured to the time of
Ptolome the great, who did dedicate them unto the gods, and delivered them unto
the Priests of the Temple, where, afterward they were destroyed, by the
means of war.

Some hold opinion, that Chiron Sentaurus, hearing of this excellent man
Mercury, went forth of Grecia, into Egypt, to learn of him, and became
excellent, in diverse arts, and specially, in the art of medicine, and in
knowledge of the simples, and afterward, he returned again into Grecia, his
own country, and in that time, there reigned in Grecia, a noble Prince named
Apollo, who was of excellent wisdom, and diligent in study, to further the
commonwealth of his country, with knowledge, and he hearing of this excellent
man Chiron Sentaurus, sent for him, and gave him great rewards, and so he
learned of Chiron Sentaurus, as some writers affirm, to know the natures of
herbs, and other things, appertaining to the Art of Medicine, and having
knowledge of them, and their natures, he put the same in use, to the great
comfort, relief and help, of the diseased and sick people, and to his own
immortal fame, for that he did help such diseases and sicknesses, which before
that time could never be helped, wherefore the people did honor him as a God,
and supposed that he was a counsel with the Gods, in that, that he did know
the nature and property of these herbs, and other things, which they did
affirm, no man might know, except he learned it of the Gods themselves, and
after the death of their king Apollo, they lamented and mourned throughout all
the Country, thinking the art had been utterly lost, but he being careful
for his Country, had taught the same unto Aesculapius his son, which when
the people understood, and for the worthiness of his own good deeds, they
gathered great sums of money throughout all the land of Grecia, and builded
therewithal a rich Temple, and buried his body in a marvelous rich Sepulcher
within the same, and called it the Temple of Apollo, and did honor him as a
God, for his most virtuous life, and painful travail, as concerning the
common wealth of his Country, and specially for that he did not disdain to
cure the most miserable diseased people, which before his time perished without
remedy.

And now that we are entered in amongst the Grecians, and for that some
affirms Apollo to be the first inuentour of Medicine, we will proceed
forth to the noble men of that Country, which had this art in so great
honor and estimation, that they most diligently above all other arts,
studied it, and in time did grow so excellent therein, that they excelled all
other Nations in the world, as it does most manifestly appear by their most
worthy Books, left unto their posterity, for a perpetual memory of their
most virtuous and painful travail, which redoundeth unto our great
commodity, and to the help and succor of those that be diseased.

The most ancient of all the Grecians, I supposed to be Apollo, who did cure
many great and wonderful diseases, by the help of the forenamed Chiron
Centaurus, and some suppose, for that, that the same Chiron did cure many
grievous, malignant, and virulent ulcers, amongst other diseases, that the name
of the Art of Chirurgia, was first derived from Chiron, for that he did
minister medicamentes with his hands, and so cured the people, and being the
first that practiced with medicines by the use of the hand, it is supposed
that he gave it that name.

Then after Apollo came Aesculapius his son, who was no less diligent and
studious in the same art than his Father, and calling unto him diverse
Philosophers, and other noble men of his Country, and by their advice and
consent, he did constitute, it an Art, and made it lawful for his subjects
that had studied the same, and being brought up with men of great experience
and practice, to use the same art amongst his people, to the restoring of
their health, in curing of their diseases and infirmities. By means whereof
Aesculapius got unto himself immortal fame, and was called the son of the
Gods, and first constituter and founder of the art of Medicine, as you may
read in the History of Tragus, Homer, and many more of the Greek writers,
and the same Tragus does say, that those men which used the art of Medicine,
were named Iatroes, for that they did cure all manner of griefs, wounds, and
sores, and in our ancient English tongue they were called Leeches, and in the
Latin tongue, Medicus, which names does signify no other thing, but curing
and healing of men's bodies with convenient medicines.

Then next after were Aesculapius two sons, called Machaon and Podalirius,
who being well instructed in the foresaid art by their Father Aesculapius,
became wonderful excellent, as it may appear more at large in the Story of
the Troyan wars, by their cures which they did upon the wounded, sore, and
sick men. These two noble Princes, as Tragus says, had many Disciples, which
they taught this art unto, and they and their Disples, by continual practice
in proouing experiments, found out many marvelous remedies against poisons of
unclean meats and drinks, and against the poison of Herbs, Serpents, and
many other things, and against the poisoning of Swoordes, Darts, Arrowe
heads, and Spears, as it is said by Demosthenes and other writers.

Then of their Disciples did grow a great number, which were dispearsed into
diverse parts of the world, some were sent for into Egypt, and some into
Persia, some to the Romans, and some to the Scithians, whereas they were had
in great estimation with the Princes and noble men of those Countries, for that
they did cure and help their wounded and hurt Soldiers, in the time of
wars, and also did relieve and cure their people in the time of pestilence
and other grievous infections, to the great safeguard, help, and comfort of
their people, and to the great security and stay of the Realm, which if
their people had dyed of these contagious infections, that were saved by them,
their Country should have lien open to have been taken and possessed of their
enemies.

Now of these men, using this art in diverse Countries, having many Disciples,
or as we may term them Scholars, and diverse and sundry sects and opinions
did grow up amongst them, by means whereof there was great controversy,
contention, and disputation of a long time, some suppose it was a leaven
hundred years, but the matter was not concluded indeed, till the time of
Hyppocrates, which after long and many disputations, confuted their fond and
erroneous opinions, and brought this most excellent art, unto a most perfect
way and method of curing, which before his time was imperfect, and used
only by Experience, without any method. Some of the same Experimenters
affirming, that they could cure only by diet all manner of diseases, and
other some affirming, that by purging medicines they could do the same, and
other some were of that opinion, that with outward medicines only, these
might be done, utterly condemning the other two. Many other foolish opinions
there were, which here were too long to be rehearsed. Now after all these
comes Hyppocrates, that most excellent and noble Philosopher, endued by the
spirit of God with such excellent wisdom and knowledge in this most worthy
art, that his like was never before or since: he established this art and
made it most perfect, that before his time was imperfect. He wrote many
worthy Books of this art, and specially for the curing of Wounds, Ulcers,
Tumors against nature, Fractures, and Dislocations, wherein he showed
himself not only to be excellent in knowledge, but also in practice, as it
may most manifestly appear by the Method therein contained, he did divide
the art of Medicine into diverse parts, that it might be the better learned
and understood, declaring which ought first to be learned, which second, and
so to the third and fourth, and so to the fifth, as it shall hereafter be set
forth more at large. Soranus in the Preface of his book, named Isagogus, did
saiy that Apollo did first find out the art of Medicine. And Aesculapius did
enlarge it and constitute it an Art, but that noble man Hyppocrates did finish
it, and make it perfect: He says, that by the excellent knowledge of this
art, he did drive away the plague out of all Grecia, and was rewarded with a
crown of gold of great value, by a Decree made in the City of Athens, for
his great pains and good deserving toward the common wealth. After his death,
the Grecians did make in a perpetual remembrance of his Honorable deeds a
most fair Tomb, at Delfus, where they did most solemnly bury his body,
and wrote upon his Tomb this Epitaph which follows.

Hyppocrates of Thesalia, and by kind of the Country of Coos, does lie buried
in this place, begotten of the seed of the immortal God Phoebus, and leaving
in the world many books of Medicine to put away sickness, and to preserve
health, what shall we need to say more of this worthy worthy man, there is
no man's cunning that may give him his condign praise.

After his time, there was many in the Country of Grecia, which practiced the
Art of Medicine, not only Kings, but great learned Philosophers, Princes,
Dukes, and Lords, and by their worthy deeds, in preserving of men's lives,
and putting away of sickness, they did obtain immortal fame, I say such
fame, did endure longer, and was more esteemed, then the fame of their
Kingedomes: as for their names, I let pass, for that, there be many writers,
have spoken of them at large, there was other diverse professers of Medicine,
before the time of Galen, that were of worthy fame, as you may read more at
large, in the first book of Cornelius Celsus, wherefore we let them pass.

After all these, came that worthy manne, Galen, who was without any
comparison, from the beginning of the world, unto this day, except
Hippocrates, not only for his excellent learning, in so many famous Arts,
which he was perfect in, but specially for this Art of Medicine, which he was
most excellently seen in, both in the Theorike, and Practike part thereof,
his worthy Commentaries upon Hippocrates, does well declare his excellent
knowledge, wherewith he has most bountifully garnished the Art of Medicine,
as our latter writers do say, more like unto a God, then a man.

How excellent be these books which he has written of the method of curing,
called Methodus Medendi, some part whereof, we have with great travail,
brought into the English tongue, and likewise, other of his books also, as
hereafter follows. Well, I will say no more of him, but what seed so ever
were sown abroad in the universal world, be the excellent learned men, in
the Art of Medicine, not only of Hippocrates, who was the Father and
fountain of all Medicine, as Galen himself does witness, but the seeds of
other men, he has gathered together, sown in one plain field, and
watered them with such diligence, that they have so increased, that at this
day, the universal earth, has received nourishment by them, perpetual
commodity and pleasure, and he for his great virtue and painful travail,
has won unto himself immortal fame, which shall remain to the worlds
end. After him came Aesius, who has written diverse worthy books, in the
same art of Medicine.

Also Oribasius, Actuarius, and Paulus Aegeneta, were worthy writers in the
same Art, as you may see by their works, which they have written, Dioscorides
also, which was before Galens time, I may not forget, for his paineful
travail, in knowledge of the simples, as it does apeare by a worthy book,
which he has made thereof. All these and many more, were worthy men amongst
the Grecians, and professers of the art of Medicine, and did always extol
and take Apollo, as the chief Captain, and first beginner of the art of
Medicine: and Aesculapius, his son, to be a setter forewarde of the same, and
Hippocrates, did make it perfect and finish it.

What shall I say, for the worthy Arabians, as that noble man of Cartage,
named Aunconius, Prince Auisen, Auorois, Auinsor, Rasis, Mesuea, Albucasius,
and many other worthy men, that spronge amongst the Arabians, who has not a
little garnished the Art of Medicine, with a great number of most excellent
books, which are to be seen at this day.

All these men, I say, took their beginning of Galen, and does honor him as
their principal head, and does glory, and exalte them selves, in his name,
for that they never had perfect method of curing before his time, but cured
only by experience, as they were taught of their masters. For Hippocrates
works before Galens time, were so short and obscure, that they were unto most
men, not understood, by means whereof many doubts did grow, but Galen, by
most worthy commentaries, made upon the same books, made those doubts most
plain and evident, unto all people, by means whereof, not only many worthy
Grecians, as I have said before, have taken a courage to write, but also many
of these most famous Arabians, have followed their steps, and examples, in
setting forth many excellent works, in the same Art of Medicine, not only
to the sauegarde of their Prince, and people, but also to their immortal fame,
and perpetual and everlasting honor.

The noble Latinestes, have also deserved no less fame, both in seeking out
the knowledge of simples, and also in setting forth of most worthy works,
in the Art of Medicine, as these worthy men, Cornelius Celsus, Plinius, and
before them Cato, Verro, Alexander, and many more, which were men of worthy
fame, all these, as I have said before, have taken their original and
beginning, from Hippocrates, and Galen.

It is also most apparent, that there are many worthy men yt have written in
these latter days and no small number in our time, and of many Countries,
some did write in France, some in Spain, some in Germany, and some in our
own Country, and many of them were famous men, and men of great and
excellent knowledge, and practice.

As Lamfranke, Archbishop of Millon, Guido, of the schole of Mompillor, and
Commissarie to the Pope Rogerus, and Roulandus, of the schole of Mompilor, and
Chirurgians unto the King of France, Rose Anglus, Gilbertus Anglus, Hugo
Wiklefe, Anglus, of the school of Cambridge, Theodoricus, and Brunus, of the
school of Bonane, Arnoldus de villa noua, and Plasentinus, of the school of
Mompilior, Petrus de Argilat, and Gordonus: all these did write of the Art of
Medicine, about two or three hundred years since, and all these builded their
foundation, and took their original, of Hippocrates and Galen, and now in
our time, there has been famous writers, as Johannes Vigo, Antonius Muse,
Antonious Gallus, Nicolaus Mass, Johannes Baptista Montanus, Iacobus Siluius,
Alfonsius Ferrey, Hollerius, Leonardus Fuchius, Johannes Tagaltius, Gabrielus
Falopius, Rioldus Columnus, Antonius Calmisius Vassalius, Ioh. Fernelius,
Amatus Lucitanus, Fra^ciscus Valleriolus, Ieronimus Cardanus, Matthiolus, and a
great many more, of learned men, who we will pass over, the troubling of time.

All these which I have spoken of, of what Country so ever they were, they
took their original and foundation, of our Father Hippocrates, and Galen,
although they have found out many things, appertaining to the Art of
Medicine, which we find no mention made of, neither in Hippocrates, nor in
Galen, yet they had their foundation from them, and all these men, of what
country so ever they were, they have drunk of the water, that flowed out of
their two wells, and do greatly rejoice therein, and who that list to read
their works, may perceive the truth thereof.

Now my friends, to tell you the truth, in my judgment, what was the cause of
these men's writings, I take it to be chiefly, to set forth the glory of
God, in his wonderful creatures and works, as touching their natures,
qualities, and properties, which does appertain unto this artist, which does
use the Art of Medicine, to consider upon, for all manner of things, under
Heaven, do serve either for man's nourishment, or else for the making of his
body, or else for necessary remedies in the time of sickness, or else for
preservatives, to keep him from sickness, and to preserve health. So careful
was the high and mighty Lord God, for his creature, man, that he made all
these things, to serve his use, as necessary helps, in the time of his
necessity, and placed him in the place of joy, with great solemnity. But
alas, his frail nature, was the cause of his sudden overthrow, from joy to
sorrow, from pleasure, to pain, from rest and quietness, to perpetual labor
and unquietness, from a most temperate Air, and pleasant place, into a
miserable world, tormented with innumerable contrary airs, and change of
winds.

Yea, I say, even from the place of health, into the world of sickness and
misery: where our bodies be altered, and weakened, every day, by mixing
together, of contrary Elements, and we being subject to the same, are daily
tormented, with innumerable diseases. And although Adam, at the first creation,
was endued with most excellent wisdom, and knowledge, by the power and might,
of the Lord God, so that he did know all things, that were upon the face of
the earth, in the waters, and deep parts thereof, not only their qualities,
and properties, but their substanciall forms, and figures, and gave them
names, as he himself thought good, for he had perfect knowledge of all
things, by the divine spirit of God, which did work in him, according to his
first creation: but when he had sinned against the Lord God, then was taken
from him his divine knowledge, and left here in this world, bare and naked, to
take pains, and study for all those things, that he would receive commodity
of.

Now man, as I said before, being wrapped about with innumerable sicknesses,
diseases, and sudden chances, which be subject to the art of Medicine,
which Art, I call the art of curing and healing, was constrained to seek for
remedies, in the time of his necessity. And sought out Herbs, Roots, and
many other things, to help his diseases, and grief withal, and by use and
long time of practicing, they did find out the natures, and properties of
many things, wherewithal, some times they did good, but by chance, for they
observed, neither the natures of bodies, nor their temperatures, nor the
disease, neither yet the causes thereof, but only regarded those things which
they did see and feel.

Thus far wide was man, from that excellent knowledge, which was given him in
the beeginning, for in the beginning, he was not only endued with most
beauty, but also with most excellent gifts of knowledge and wisdom.

All other creatures, besides man, which has not sinned against the LORD GOD,
but followed the nature of their first creation, all these we see by
experience, have a certain divine nature in them, which man lacks, for man
did lose it through sin, which these creatures have not done, and for the
proof hereof, we will begin with the dog, which being sick, seeks for a
certain grass, and eats thereof, and with the same cures his grief and
disease: Only a divine nature teaches him this, without any study. The
Squirrell also provides her self nuts against Winter. The little Ant or
Pismere does gather seeds into the ground, and biteth them in the end, after
such a cunning sort, that they may not grow. The Storke also being grieved or
anoyed with any unclean thing that she has eaten, flies to the sea, and
gives her self a clister with salt water, ministering it with her bill at her
nether end, by means whereof she purges and cleanses her self of her
grief and sickness. Thus may you perceive the divine and wonderful works of
almighty God, working in his creatures by a divine nature, but man lacking
this divine knowledge, and left only to reason and Experience, is
constrained by great study to bring to pass those things which by
imperfection of Nature does lack in him: By means whereof, all these most
worthy men before said have put in writing many worthy Books of this art,
which art they have obtained by great study and experience, and by a
reasonable method or way, have taught the same unto others, not only to that
end, that the glory of God in his great and wonderful works, may be the
better known, as I have said before, but also for the common wealth of their
own Countries wherein they did dwell. The Princes and subjects being wounded,
hurt, or diseased, by their great and painful travail, and by their great
study and most approved experiments might be restored again unto their
health, and the rest which be in good health, might be defended from most
cruel plagues and sicknesses, by the help of this most worthy and excellent
art. This art (I say) is most worthy, for that it works upon the body of
man, which is the most excellentest creature of all the world: and as the
subject is excellent, which the artist does work upon, it must needs follow,
that the artist must be most worthy which works upon so excellent a subject.

And furthermore, to prove this art to be most excellent, and most of all
other to be had in honor and reverence, I prove it by the saying of Saint
Paul, That some men had the gift of wisdom, some of prophesying, and some of
healing: and Saint Paul says, That these were done by the spirit of God, that
is to say, by the holy Ghost. Therefore Hyppocrates and Galen, having the
spirit of wisdom and of the art of Medicine, most abundantly poured into
them, did excel all men before their times, and set forth this art so
perfectly and exactlie by the power and virtue of the same spirit, that all
the universal world has received such commodity by them, that their most
excellent fame shall endure to the worlds end. All other men being endued with
the same spirit, and with the examples of them, to set forth such knowledge as
they are endued withal, for the help and maintenance of their common wealth,
and for the relief and comfort of the diseased subjects, have been from time
to time moved with the spirit of God, to write many volumes of books to
their posterity, wherein they have taught them the methodes of ways of
curing, not only of grievous wounds, great Apostumes, ulcers, fractured
bones, and dislocations, but of all other infirmities and diseases, that
chances unto the body of man, with their proper signs and tokens, to judge
them by their natures and properties, their distemperatures, with their names
and most exact divisions, to that end that they may be more rightly
understood, judged, and aptly cured.

Here may a question arise, what this art of medicine is, and what you call
him that uses the same, for many men suppose that he is properly named a
Physician, and other some supposes that he should be called a Surgeon,
by means whereof in times past there has grown some contention as perteining
to the Instruments proper unto the said art of curing, yt is to say, the use
of the hand, called Chirurgia, convenient diet, named Dieta, and ministering of
convenient medicaments, named Phermacon.

For answer thereof I have told you my opinion before, yt in the beginning the
Artist was called Iatros, amongst the Grecians, and amongst the Latinists,
Medicus, and in our Country, in our ancient tongue, he was called a Leech:
which three words, that is to say, Iatros, Medicus, and Leech, signified no
other thing but to cure, that is, a curer of diseases, sickness, and sores,
wherewith man's body is grieved. Now, these diseases cannot be cured without
convenient instruments, which instruments are first and chiefly the hands of
man, that does make ready convenient nourishment or medicines, and ministers
the same unto the sick man, or else commands the same to be ministered in
convenient order. The second is diet, which is a special instrument, as well
for the curation of Wounds, Apostumes, Vlcerations and tumors against nature,
as for all other diseases which chances unto man's body: Both Hyppocrates and
Galen does prescribe proper diet for wounds, according to the temperature of
the body, according to the nature of the wounded part, and according to the
nature of the accidents that may be joined with the same wound.

In like manner Galen prescribes a diet for those that has vlcerations, not
only in Cancers, but also in many other kind of ulcers, which may neither be
conveniently cured, neither yet preserved in good state, without convenient
diet, and as for tumors against nature, they require no less help of diet
than the residue: for it is a general rule that we first take indication of
the nature of the disease which we entend to cure, and of the effects of the
same. As for example, in Phlegmon, which is an inflammation ingendered of
blood, for of nature Phlegmon is hot and moist, but his affect is to make
inflammation, not only in ye part where it is aggregated, but by consent and
affinity, which the grieved member has with the rest of the body, it does
often times move a Fever, which might grieve and trouble all the body, and
cause the inflammation to be more vehement in the grieved part. Therefore the
Artist ought chiefelie to provide for this mischief, and there is no better
way to resist the same, than by giving of convenient diet, which must be cold
and dry, contrary to the nature of the disease which comes of blood, being
hot and moist, for these be general rules, taught both of Hyppocrates and
Galen, that every disease with his affects, be cured with his contrary.

Thus I think, there is no reasonable man that will deny this instrument to
appertain chiefelie to the art of Chirurgia, for reason does approve and
allow it, and experience does find it most necessary and true: Therefore I
must say, as Galen says in his third book Methodo Medendi, All arts are
grounded upon reason and experience, neither is there any third thing to be
added thereunto: If any man can show me how we may cure ulcers, tumors, and
other things appertaining to the art of Surgerie, by a third way, and with
other instruments than these worthy men have found out by reason and
experience, then I will give place, and be glad to learn it, and if I find
the same to be more profitable and commodious for the common wealth and for the
grieved persons, I will not only endeavor my self to learn it, but also to
follow it, extol it, and teach it unto other, but if no man can show me any
other way than reason ought to teach him, to suffer me to restore my sick
Patient to health, by the permission of God, with those instruments that be
most necessary and proper for mine Art.

Furthermore, as concerning Pharmacon, which is called Medicamentum or
Medicine, I think there be no men ignorant, no not so much as those that be
utterly unlearned, but that they know that medicine is an instrument to help
to cure diseases and sicknesses withal, for who can cure a wound, a tumor
against nature, or an ulcer, only with his hands without medicine, I think
there is no man that is so ignorant or stupidious, that thinks that to be
true, then of necessity it must follow, that these be three instruments,
and not three parts of medicine, as many men have misconstrued both
Hyppocrates and Galen, both contrary to reason and true experience, for the
hands alone cannot cure without Medicine, neither can the medicines be
ministered without hands, neither yet can any man take meat or drink, except
it be ministered with the hand, then of necessity it must follow, that these
three cannot be divided, forasmuch as one is helped by another, and the
desired health brought to an end by all these three, and not by any one of
these alone, as Hyppocrates did right well prove, in confuting of certain
sects that were in his time, as Tragus does make mention by the authority of
that noble King Democrates, affirming that there were certain sects, which
then did use the art of curing, some by inward medicine only, which they did
purge the body withal, and some by diet only, which they did use, as it
seemed unto them good, and some by mininstring of outward medicines, to such
parts of the body as they thought good. And every one of these did affirm
that they would restore man's body to health, what disease so ever it were
affected withal, if that the said disease were curable, only with one of
these three ways, and that the other two were superfluous, and need not to
be used. By means whereof there did grow great contention, and great
disputation was had therein, and in conclusion they did seem to confound all
three parts, each of them thus confuting other.

Then Hyppocrates hearing of this great contention amongst them, they all
three professing the curatiue part of the Art of Medicine, sent for them, and
appointed unto them certain men to cure, and asked them in what space they
would cure the same persons, and they appointed a certain time, and
Hyppocrates gave them four times so long space: Then every one of them with
great diligence according to his own sect and way did minister.
Notwithstanding the Patients were not made whole, so that they were constrained
to leave them uncured, when they could do no more. When Hyppocrates saw
their dooinges, how far wide it was from a reasonable method, yet how
ingenious and witty they were in devising and inuenting of medicines to bring
their purpose to pass, he did not a little marvel.

Then with courteous words he persuaded them to leave off their preciseness
and severe sects, and to use a general method, wherein all those three were
joined together, and to use every one of these in his convenient time and
place, each one of them to help other, and then there was no doubt but with
their excellent inventions, they would cure wonderful griefs and diseases,
which otherwise could not be brought to pass.

Now when Hyppocrates had made these three men friends, he required them to
go with him to their sick and grieved Patients, and said unto them: That
with the same medicines which they had ministered before, by the permission of
the immortal Gods he would make all their three Patients whole. So
Hyppocrates ministering no other diet, but such a diet, as he that ministered
the diet had used before, neither yet any other purging medicamentes, than he
that used to cure with purging medicaments had used before, nor yet any other
plasters or ointmentes, than he that used to cure with plasters and
ointmentes had used before, even with the same medicines that they did use, by
using of them in convenient time and place methodicallie, did cure all their
sick Patients: By means whereof they were persuaded to follow his doctrine,
and to use these as common and general instruments for the art of curing, and
all they to be exhibited and used with the hand.

Thus it does appear by Hyppocrates, that none of these may be absent from
him that uses the art of curing.

Galen also as concerning purging medicaments, where he entreats of the
same, says, they be very profitable, yea, and also most necessary in the
curing of Cancers, old, stubburne, and rebellious ulcers, and also in Herpis,
Herisipelas, etc.

And these purging medicines were chiefelie invented and found out by
experimentes, wherewithal they did purge and draw away these vicious and
evil humors, which was the maintaining cause of all those Ulcers and grieved
parts, as it is before said, which other ways could not have been cured:
Galen also in his fourth book De Methodo Medendi, by the authority of
Hyppocrates, does say thus, That Purgations of the belly is profitable to
many ulcers, and also to wounds of the head, of the belly, and of the
joints, and where there is danger of corruption of the bones, or where
stitching behooves in wounds or where Erosians be, or where Herpis, and other
affectes be, which hinders the curation of Ulcers, and also where rollinges
must be used.

By these words it is apparent truly, that Purgations are profitable both to
wounds and ulcers, at all times, when they be great and grievous, I mean
not only Purgations ministered by the upper parts, but also Purgations
ministered by the nether parts, as Clisters, and such like.

Thus I do conclude, that these three Instruments are most necessary for
those men that shall cure hurts, griefs, and diseases, and in no case may be
separated or taken from them: For like as the Carpenter and shipwright must of
necessity use like instruments to finish and bring to pass their work
withal: even so must the Artists in this art, by what name so ever you will
call them, have and use convenient Instruments to bring to pass the desired
health, which is the end of this art. If the Carpenter should say unto the
Shipwright, thou may not use the Axe, the Saw, the pearcer, nor yet the
hammer, for that they be proper instruments for my art, then the shipwright
might answer him and say, they be proper for my Art also, and without those
instruments I cannot build my ship, nor bring to pass the desired end of my
Art. Even in like manner it may be said in the Art of medicine, for whether
he be called by the name of a Physician, or by the name of a Surgeon, of by
the name or a Leech, or by what other name you will call him, if ye will admit him
to cure wounds, Tumors against Nature, ulcers, or what diseases so ever they
be, it is necessary that he have his proper Instruments apt and meet, to
bring the same to pass withal. But if we shall stand upon the names of the
Art, and confound the instruments, then shall we seem to maintain a vain
disputation, and spend time about those names, which are to small purpose, for
the name is not the thing that does cure, but the art, being methodicallie
and rightly ministered. For Galen in his third and fourth book, De Methodo
Medendi, does name him Medicus, that does cure ulcers and wounds, therefore
it seems to me that Mtdicus and Chyrurgus be indifferent names for those
that professes the art of curing, and for any thing that I can perceive,
either by the words of Hyppocrates or Galen, or by any other notorious and
famous writers that have written in this art: The Chirurgions ought not to be
forbidden neither the ministering of purgations, nor yet of diet, for as much as
they be their chief and principal instruments, without which they cannot
bring to pass their desired scope of health: And if we shall speak of the
antiquity of names, I suppose the name of Chirurgia to be much more ancient
than the name of Physic, for I suppose Physic to be derived of Phisilogia,
which word does signify, natural knowledge of man's body, and of all the
parts and members of the same, etc. And Chirurgia is derived of Chiro, which
is a hand, or as we might say, a ministration of Medicamentes, done with the
hand, unto man's body, only by experience. So that all those that were
before the time of Hyppocrates, were accounted but as experimenters, and to
follow an art without a right method, which that noble man Hyppocrates
perceiving, did like a most famous Philosopher, according to reason, join
together all these imperfect sects, which were in his days very many, and
taught them one perfect and true way, methodicallie to work, and also
certain rules how they should learn the same art, and divided it into five
special parts, as we shall declare hereafter, which parts being perfectly
understood, is the right way to proceed to the curation of man's body,
and without knowledge of these five parts, no man can methodicallie and
rightly cure any Ulcers, Wounds, Apostumes, or any other diseases, as we
have said before, for whosoever takes upon them, having not knowledge of
these, he may be called a practiser, and experimenter, or an emperike, as the
most part of our Chirurgions may be called, that be not learned in these
parts, and does work only by experience without reason, but those yt
understand these parts, and follows a method in their curing, whether they
do cure Wounds, Tumors against nature, Apostumes, Ulcers, or what other
things so ever it be, that does appertain to the art of curing, that same
Artist may be called Medicus, a Medendo, that is to say, of curing, for so
does Galen name him in his third and fourth book De Methodo Medendi,
according to the translation of that learned man Linaker.

And forasmuch as ye shall the better credit the worthiness of this art of
Chirurgerie, as well for the antiquity thereof, as for the Instruments
appertaining to the Artist, I have here set forth before your eyes an Epistle
made by Franciscus Valleriolus, in the commendations of the art of
Chirurgerie, which Valleriolus is one of the most notable learned men in the
art of medicine that is now living, whose words hereafter follows.

The office of a Surgeon, and the Instruments appertaining unto the same
Art, set forth by Franciscus Valleriolus, Medicus. Anno Domini. 1562.
IT is commonly known, and I have showed it before, that the other part of
the Art of Medicine, is that which cures with the hand, which also the
Greeks do call Kyrurgicon, for the manner of working, and we keeping that
name do call it Chirurgia. This part as it is counted among the old writers
the ancientest, so truly both for the magnitude and for the profit of the
effects, it is counted the chiesect. Moreover, Podalirius and Machaon, being
the first authors of that art, as it is supposed, and the lawful issue of
Aesculapius, the father of the art of Medicine, do declare the ancientnesse
thereof, whom as Homer writes, followed Agamemnon their Captain in the Troyan
wars, and to have been no small help to his soldiers in curing of them, not
by the help of inward medicines only, but in curing diligently of their
wounds, with iron instruments, and with other fit medicines thereunto
appertaining, whereby it does appear, this part of Medicine to be only
proved of them, and the same to be auncientest.

Furthermore, the profit and utility thereof, does of it self manifestly
appear, by the curations of great Apostumes, of wounds, of ulcers, of
luxations, and of Fractures, all the which this part of Medicine does entreat
of exactlie. And of this part we will entreat in this Chapter, and of the same
we will show forth these things what that art is, and what be the parts of it,
what is the end thereof, who be the authors, what the office and duty of a
Surgeon is, what be his instruments which he has accustomed to use in
healing, what a one he ought for to be, and to conclude, who ought to be
accounted the best Surgeon, and thus we will finish our Chapter.

Chirurgerie is defined of Galen to be a certain order of curing, which is
accomplished by accustomed incisions and adustions, and other things which are
done by the hand. Moreover, the author of the Introductorie, whosoever he
has been, has defined the same after this manner (as they do properly call
it) a taking away of things hurtful, by incisions and concinations, by a
certain method and reason: In like manner it is the curation of wounds and
ulcers, which is administered to man's body. But if any man will set forth the
order of it more curiously and expreslie, he will call it the third part of the
method Therapeutichon, which does cure diseases, by the artificialnesse of the
hand, by adustions and incisions, and by curing luxations, and by putting
broken bones into their places, and such like. Guido of Caliacensia has so
defined, that it may be a science, which may both teach the order and quality
of operation, chiefelie by adglutination and incisions, and other operations of
that kind, which be done by the use of the hand, restoring men to their
health as much as is possible.

Also, it behooves us to use this name of Science more largely in this place,
and apply it unto that part of Chirurgerie which does profit by meditation of
precepts and giving of Method, and not by curing with the hand. For it is
manifest that Chirurgerie is an Art, and not a Science properly, whose end is
the bringing to effect, and not the contemplation of the verity only, and
for that cause Aristotle would have the same worthelie to be an art, and also
has thought it good to place it amongst those arts which do pertain to the
use of the hand: But other things being put in the definition, do keep their
place of difference in like manner, this part is not put unadvisedly to the
definition (that men be restored to their health) as much as is possible, for
although that health is counted to a Surgeon, for a perpetual scope, yet
that same cannot always be obtained by art, because there be many diseases
incurable, which do chance, either because they are such by their own
nature, as Elephantiasis, or else, that as the curation is taken in hand, does
bring more discommoditie, and also a more grievous sickness than that which is
taken in hand to be cured. As when we go about to cure Vitiliginem, Antiquam,
Lichenas, Hemorroidas, Sinuosa vlcera, and the old Fistulas,, Cancers, and to
conclude, when as we have a stubburne patient which does give no regard to the
Surgions that governs him: these are the causes why that all cannot be
brought to their health by art: In like manner Chirurgerie is divided into two
parts generally, the one is, which does declare what things belong to the
art, and does set forth the precepts, wherewith the workman being furnished, may
work rightly: This part the Greeks do call Theoreticon, and we do call it
Theorica, yt is to say, ye learned or speculatiue part, ye other does follow
yt, and does perform in effect yt precepts of ye former, and it is called in
Greek Practica. or rather Poetica, yt is to say, a bringer of things to pass,
for it wholly does consist in doing and bringing to effect, and seeing that the
whole Art, does depend of these, we may with good cause, think Chirurgerie
worthy to be called an art, as whose end, is affection and woork. For she
does exercise all her properties, either in soft members, or in hard parts.
The soft parts are those, which have their beginning of blood, and are called
fleshie, and the hard parts do spring of seed. And chirurgerie does exercise
her faculty in those parts by incision, by cutting, or by taking away, by
reposition, and adustion. And truly of this art, there are certain other
more special parts, as those about the which the art it self is specially
occupied, that is to say, Tumors against nature, wounds, ulcers, fractures,
and Luxacions. Therefore as there be five parts which the art does entreat of,
so there be five parts of Chirurgerie, in the whole, as which do teach us to
cure tumors, which wounds, and which ulcers, and which can put fractures and
luxacions, in their proper place. But the end whereunto Chirurgerie directed
all his actions, and provisions, is the ablation, and taking away of those
sicknesses, which may be cured by ministracion of convenient medicines with
the hand, and to restore the sick, unto his health, which end truly the
workman cannot always obtain unto. For those causes which we declared
before, seeing that it is not in his power, to cure every sickness.

And this long art, vaunteth her self, unto the famous company of excellent
and noble authors, worthy of great renown. In whose register, that divine man
Hippocrates, the patron and defender of the noble art of Medicine, does of
very right, challenge to him self, the chiefest place, by whose mean this
part of medicine, is better declared, then it was before his time, the which
thing, the divine monuments which he left to his posterity, do witness, I
do mean his books, wherein he does speak, of the wounds of the head, of
fractures of the lyms, of ulcers, of fistules, of the emorodes, and of the
furniture of Chirurgerie, and of cutting out of the Anathomies.

Furthermore, Chirurgerie beeinge as it were divided at length from the other,
has chosen unto her self a proper place, and began to have her proper
professors, for in the time of old writers, and in the flourishing age of
Hippocrates, Chirurgia was not divided from the other parts of medicine, for
they were then both Physicians and Chirurgions. And Philoxenus, declares it to
have flourished in Egypt, which has set forth and garnished this Art in many
volumes. And after him Gorgias Sostratus, Hieron, and the two Apollonij,
Amomus, Alexandrinus, and many other excellent men, and it is certain, that
there was no mean professors of the same art, at Rome, as the ancient.
Fathers, Tryphon, Euelpistus, and Meges, the most excellent of all, as Celsus
writes. But how much Galen excelled, in restoring, and enriching this part of
medicine, his learned Commentaries, upon the books of Hippocrates, wherein he
does declare of the Art of Medicine, and upon his book De articulis and de
fracturis. And moreover, his six books, of the first method of curing,
called Therapeuticon, and the last two of the same, ye two also, De art
curatiua ad Glauconem, his book, De tumoribus preter naturam, and his book De
compositione medicamentorum, secundum genera, do testify abu^dantly.
Moreover, Paulus oegeneta, ought greatly to be commended, who in a method
compendious, but yet most exact, has comprehended all Chirurgerie, both in his
fourth book, and also in his sixth.

Furthermore, Auicenna, Rasius, Albucasis, and Haliabbas, being of the school
of the Arabians, have entreated most diligently, of the Art of Chirurgerie, as
Auicenna, in his fourth Canon, and the third, fourth, and fifte feen.

Also Rasus, in his seventh book, to Almanser, the King, Albucasis, in a whole
volume, Haliabbas, in his ninth book, of practice of the regal disposition,
neither has she lacked her honor, of Latins, Celsus, and Plinius, Captains,
who with great beauty, and like dignity, have entreated briefly of this
part. Why should I pass over Guydo de Gauliaco, who only among the French,
we have known to have entreated very well of Chirurgerie, if ye regard the
reason of the art? We may truly gather by his rude speech that he wanted
only such happy time wherein he could not come to the knowledge of the
Greek tongue, nor to the pure eloquence of the Latin tongue, whilst at that
time ignorance and barbarousnesse exercised tyranny over good learning, which
was the cause that in rehearsing the place of Galen, the truth of the author
was much desired: But if God grant me life, I will divide those places of the
Art of Medicine, from the common place, I trust that I shall help Guido, and
I will of a barbarous and impure writer, make him a fine and eloquent Latinist,
and restore him to his beutie, and which our friend Siluius has performed in
correcti^g Mesueus, the same do I faithfully promise to the studious, to
multiply in repairing of Guido, if God prosper our endeavors, although perhaps
without meet or equal thanks, yet shall I do it with due labor and good
will. But now I will return to my purpose, for many famous men, and authors
most worthy of favorable commendations, have set forth this art, among the
which, Guido, Vigonius, and among the men of this age, Tagaltius being my
fellow in office, and my companion in my studies, have done great things and
worthy of praise, in amplifying and garnishing this part, whereby it may be
gathered, how much is unto this art to be attributed, which so many renowned,
have each one in his works and monuments set forth, increased, and enriched,
that men might know it to be most profible, and in effects most evident among
all the parts of medicine.

Now must we show what are the duties and office of a Surgeon, and how he
should enterprise the same, for there be three chief points which pertains
to a Chyrurgion, wherein all the whole reason of the art seems to consist.

The first does consist in loosing and separating that which is conjoined. The
second is, in joining and bringing that to a good unition, which is divided.
The third is in remoouing and taking away by incision, or otherwise, that which
is superfluous. Moreover, the Surgeon divides continuitie, either by
incision, by cutting off, by letting of blood, or by scarification: That which
is divided, he conioyneth by adglutination of wounds, and by restoring, of
displaced bones into their place again, and also by curing of Fractures, that
is to say, broken bones. And he cutteth away superfluous mattier by taking
away tumors against nature, and that by ye ministration of ye hand, as in
extirpation diverse ways of Ganglia, Carcinonata, otherwise called Cancer,
Scirrus, Nodus, Strumas, and other of that kind, either else in drawing of
water out of the belly in Hidrops, or else in cutting off a superfluous
finger, when as there be six or more upon the hand, or else by taking away of
Cataracts, which the Greeks call Ptirigion, or the web in the eyes. For
truly these be the chief duties of a Surgeon, and the operations, which
he ought most trustelie to execute.

Furthermore, that is, when he has performed all these things, safely,
readily, and quickly, and with as little grief as may be, and also without
all fraud and deceit, Galen esteems to be the duty of a Physician that
cures rightly, and that only regards the utility of the sick: For these
be things which cannot otherwise be done by the art of Medicine, and therefore
they be most profitable in the common weal, and the arts thereof were had in
most estimation in the old time, as the ancient writers do declare. Therefore
so profit thou, says Hyppocrates, in diseases, that thou hurt them not. This
scope must therefore always be had in those things, that the Surgeon will
endeavor to do, that he profit the sick, and take in hand the curation of
diseases with good faith and honest, and with a beneficial will toward his
neighbor, and whatsoever he knows himself able to cure by the benefit of
his art, that let him enterprise to do with all diligence, but inuinsible and
incurable diseases, such are Oculti carni, Elephantiasis, and old Callous,
hollow and fraudulent ulcers, let him not once attempt to meddle with, least he
get the name of an evil Surgion.

And further, because that we have said, that a Surgeon must safely cure,
there be three things worthy to be noted, which Galen does mention in his
xiiii. book, De methodo medendi, unto all the which the diligent Surgeon,
shall safely have regard. The first is, that he diligently prosecute the
perfection of his work, which he does enterprise, for the restoring the sick
person to his health. The second is, if he may not obtein this scope, that at
least he hurt not, the sick person through his work: for that is the precept
of Hippocrates, lib. i. Epid. textu. 50. saying, Profit thou so in sickness,
that thou hurt not. The third and last is, that thorough diligent care, the
disease do not easily return again, for the study of the Surgeon is, that
he by operation, may remove all the diseases and griefs which are in man's
body, contrary to nature: But if he cannot bring this thing to pass, then
let him take his chief counsel of that learned sentence of Galen, how he
should remove these hurts. Moreover, the cunning artist shall practice all
things prosperously, if he will study to cure diseases, by their indications,
which is a witty beginning of things to be done, as Galen witnesses in his
xiiii. book, De methodo medendi, and the first indication, is the conservation
of those things which are in man's body, according to nature, and the removing
of those which are against nature.

Furthermore, those things which be in man's body according to nature, are
kept by the like use of their like, and those which be against nature, are
driven forth by their co^traries, and that if the disease do need such meet
curation: But notwithstanding, it is most certain, that there are some
diseases, which cannot be expelled out of the body.

And we do know them by this, when as the effect it self, of his own nature,
and whole assencie, does refuse all orders of curing, as the disease
Elefantiasis absoluta, and as men commonly call it confirmata, or else when the
patient (although the disease be otherwise curable) shall continue such helps,
as are to the curation necessary, namely cutting away, as in Spaselus, or else
adustion or incision, where they shall be needful: and the diseases of sick
men, are made for the most part incurable, either by the tenderness of the
patient, or yelding to the disease.

In like manner we do call such diseases incurable, whose curation does give an
occasion of greater evil. As when we do study to cure Cancer, or endeuer to
help daily fluxis, of the Hemordoes, except one hemorode be left open: or old
ulcers, which have had a long issue, for ye curation of these, do bring for
the most part, more dangerous diseases into the body of the patient:
wherefore Hippocrates, in his sixth, xxxviiii. and xii. Apoph. does affirm,
that it is best to leave this disease, called Cancros occultos uncured, and so
of old emorodes, except one be left uncured, for else it is more dangerous,
for turning into a dropsy, madness, or consumpcio^ And because we have
declared before the office of Chirurgerie, which can not be exercised without
his fit instruments. Now we will show, what these instruments ought to be, by
the which a furnished artist, may exercise those things that belongs to this
art, and those are generally two, that is to say, things medicinal, and
things manual, of the first kind are these, order of diet, which must be had
in curing of wounds, apostumes, ulcers, fractures, and luxacions: then letting
of blood, and purging, and also local medicines, as ointments, emplaisters,
fome^tacions, pouders, Cataplasmatas, and other things of that kind.

And seeing that great dangers do chance, by appointing the order of diet,
by ministering, of inward medicines, and by letting of blood, if they be not well
administered, and do both often, bring as well great infamy, to the Surgeon,
as detrement, to the sick patient, it shall be meet for him to use the
council of a man learned in the art of medicine, in those things, by whose
prescription, he may assuredly apply helps to the health of the sick. For the
precribing of wholesome diet, the omission of blood, and the giving of a
sollutiue medicine, belong to a master in the art of medicine. For these are
helps of great weight and importance, and such as require a man of great
wisdom and judgment, and of no less prudence and exercise.

Wherefore I can not but be grieved, for that I consider a great many men, to
work foolishly, let me not say impudently, greatly delighting them selves in
the only dignity of the Art, not knowing what it means, which do
oftentimes let blood their poor patients, without any Indicatio^, or council,
of one learned in the same art, or of some grave and learned Physician, but
also they will give inward medicines a gods name, a matter truly most worthy,
of public punishment. For as much as I have seen many, by such their rash,
and bold enterprises, brought into danger, yea, and some have I seen
miserably languished and deprived of life. Therefore let not that young
Surgeon, which would be esteemed worthy of his art, presume to take in
hand these things, without the council of an ancient master, learned in
the same art, or else a grave Physician, such a one which is learned in the
art of medicine, the matter it self giving also such liberty or time.

But otherwise, if there be no learned master present, or that any present
necessity do constrain the same, then truly, the younger Chirurgions may
bo^t blood, and also if need be, minister a medicine, so that he have good
erudicion, judgment and experience.

Moreover the Vnguentes, where with the Surgeon ought to be furnished, and
the same to have always in his saluetorie, as these, Vnguentum Basilicum,
Vnguentum Apostolorum, Vnguentum Aureum, Vnguentum Album, and Vnguentum de
Althea, as Basilicon, to superate and materate, and Apostolicon to mundifie and
cleanse: Vnguentum Aureum, to incarnate and to fill, Vnguentum Album, to
cicatrise, Vnguentum de Althea, to cease dolor and pain, and to make soft.

Moreover, as for emplaisters, pouders, fomentations, and such like, the expert
Surgeon, does prescribe of them very many sorts, according to the reason of
curing. And these are the medicinal instruments, pertaining to ye art of
Surgerie. By ye manual instruments, ye shall chiefly understand instruments of
iron, very meet and most necessary, to the Chirurgio^s use, whereof some are
to make incisio^, and to cut of a thing other some are to draw out, and
certain are to search, also some be properly to stitch or sow, and other some
to make adustion, to cut or make incision. Forfices, Nouacula, rasorius,
scalpellum, Chirurgicum, for Phlebotomie, seu, lancetam, forsipes to draw out,
called commonly Tenaculae volcellae, seu volcellae, which in French they call
pinsettas, the crooked hook, vncus seu vncinus, and that Iron instrument which
ye Grecians call Diocleum graphiscum, is apt as Celcus writes, to draw out
arrows. For to search, we do fitly use a probe, for to sow, a needell and a
quill are properly used, and to adustion diverse kinds of cauteries, commonly
called actual, are occupied, and for the variable means of their use, they
have diverse figures, and diverse names, for some be sharp at the point, and
other be not, and other cauteris, they call myrtea, oliuaria, dactilica,
cultellaria, so called of the similitude of things, which these instruments
do represent, for the cauteris called Mirtia, do imitate the figure of the
leaves of Mirtills, Oliuaria, of an Oliefe, and dactilica, of the Date, as
Cultellaria, does represent the form of a knife, these are the common
instruments necessary for Chirurgions. There are certain other instruments
proper and appointed to certain parts of the body, as modioli, which the
common Chirurgions call Trepans, malleus, scalpri, and the same are convenient
to scrape, cut, or pull out bones, as well of the head, as other parts, even as
Falx is proper to the fundament, speculum oris, to the mouth, and speculum
matricis, to the matrise, there are innumerable other sorts of instruments,
convenient to draw out darts, gunshots, and other infixed things, whereof to
speak I do now cease, and will prepare my self, to set out a Surgeon,
what manner a man the best Chirurgio^ should be, which thing, I often times have
declared to be the chief effect of the matter, for we know what Galen has
said, of the Physician, as well in his book, De institutione artis
medicinalis, as also in the third book, de naturalibus facultatibus, and in
his third and fourth, de methodo medendi, (Galen calls him that cures
wounds and ulcers, medicus, that is to say, a Physician) he says, that ye
Physician ought to be prudent and well exercised, and also he ought to be of
quick nature, and of pregnant wit, that he may promptly obtain all things,
and very well instructed in learning, and moreover appointed to the best
masters to learn of, and one enduring labor and pain, a great lover of the
truth, and studious, and most deeply understanding his art, approved by much
use and long experience, and all this (say I) must be applied to the
Chyrurgion, which will be most excellent, and esteemed for an undoubted
Artist: but beside these, there be certain things which do pertain priuatlie
to a Chyrurgio^, as to ye manual Artist, and do not so much pertain to the
ancient master of the art of Medicine, for a Chyrurgion ought to be a young
man, or else but little past youth, that is, between the same, and ancient
man's estate, for ye age flourishes most in sense and strength, to exercise
rightly whatsoever belongs to his art, (wherefore they which are aged men
cannot so aptly bring things to pass which art requires, for the
imbecilitie of their senses, for they follow them rather by counsel.)
Furthermore, he must have a sure and strong hand, and steadfast to all works
that he shall do, whether it be to make incision, adustion, and also for the
cutting away of a member. Also it behooves him to have a quick and clear
eye, and he must not be fearful of mind, but rather without pity, if he do
intend to cure him that he takes in hand. Furthermore, neither let him make
the more have, neither let him cut Canteries, or cut off less than need
requires, for the clamor or crying out, or for the tenderness of the sick
Patient, but let him do all things as though he heard not the clamors of the
sick, neither let his mind be therewith any thing troubled: And we have
declared that a Chyrurgion ought to excel in learning, for therein chiefelie
does his erudition manifestly appear, if he understand exactlie both the
Theorike and the Practike parts, that is to say, to know things natural and
not natural, and also those that are against nature. Also if he know what be
the causes of wounds, ulcers, fractures, and luxations, with their accidents,
and also what be their convenient remedies, and how to remove the same: In like
manner he shall excel in practice, if he have had much and good exercise in
the operations of his Art, by working speedily, trimly, and readily, and
consulting with the ancient masters of the same art, in those things that
pertain to Pharmaceuticen and Diateticen. And although he use those things
which be searched out by reason, and confirmed by frequent use, wherein truly
the faith and honesty of a Chyrurgion seems chiefly to consist: The
Chyrurgion ought to be as it were, of a natural disposition, in the right and
easy obtaining of things with, that he has to do, of a steadfast memory, of a
quick remembrance, handsome in his doings, of a good judgment, diligent and
apt in searching, or inuenting remedies: but chiefly of all, as concerning
manners, let him be devout, or religious toward God, merciful of mind, and
unfearful in sure things, and such as must needs be done, and in things
doubtful and perilous, he must be wary and not too rash, in like manner he
must be familiar, gentle, and pleasant toward his Patients, mild and
tractable amongst the brethren of his Art, and as the Greeks do call him
Philectairos, that is to say, a lover of his companions. Also he must be
prudent, very circumspect, and slow in prognosticating, not a greedy catcher,
chaste also and temperate, not covetous of money, for he which does exercise the
art of Chyrurgerie rather for lucre sake and desire of gain, than for any
good will toward his neighbor, he is no right Chyrurgion, but as it were, borne
out of time, and thus I make an end. Thus far I have declared unto you the
saying of Valleriolus that learned man. But forasmuch as some men do more
regard the authorities of authors, than they do the true judgment of reason
and experience, which two are the foundation of all Arts, and will allege and
say, this is but his own invention, wherefore I will not believe him, though it
appear never so much to be reasonable, shall I credit one or two men's sayings,
that the art of Chyrurgerie is so ancient, or that the instruments
appertaining to the same art, is diet and medicaments, no I will not believe
it, for those instruments do pertain only to Physic, and not to
Chirurgerie, for the instruments of Chyrurgerie be only outward medicines,
as Plasters, Unguents, oiles, pouders, etc. with a great many of iron
instruments fit for his art, wherefore I am not bound to believe Franciscus
Valleriolus. The answer. My friend, have thou so soon forgotten Hyppocrates?
who confuting all dispearsed sects, did conclude, That diet, wherein consists
the government and nourishment of the sick man: That purgations being
necessary for the euacuation of evil humors. And also outward medicines, as
plasters, vnguentes, oils, balmes, etc. That all these three were united
together by the authorie of Hyppocrates, and that in no case they might be
separated one from another, if we will rightly cure the body of man, and follow
a right method, which method Hyppocrates has constituted and set forth, and
wills all men to follow the same. Then I say, either we must break
Hyppocrates precepts, and by that means grow into ignorance again, either
else we must follow the true and right method, set out by him, wherein he did
use all these instruments generally and indifferently, as time and cause did
require.

And also Galen, as it may more at large appear in his fourth book De Methodo
Medendi, and in his books of purging medicaments, where he does confute
diverse Physicians, which would not admit purging medicines in outward
diseases, as Asclapiades, etc. Saying, That purging medicaments are necessary
to be used, where there be great and dangerous wounds, and where there be
great accidents that chances unto the same, to purge and draw away the
superfluous quantity of those humors, which might hurt the grieved part, or
hinder the curation thereof, as he does declare in the same book De Methodo
Medendi. And he says in his books of purging medicamentes, That purgations
are needful for the curation of Cancers, Herpis, Erisipulas, Spasalus,
Gangrena, and many other outward griefs which chances unto man's body. And he
does affirm, yt without these things, he could not have brought to health his
diseased patients. Thus it does manifestly appear both by Hyppocrates and
Galen, that these be not only general instruments, but also common
instruments, and therefore of necessity must be used, either else ye
Surgeon must leave these evil affects uncured, which he ought take first to
indication off. Objection. Yea sir, you say very well, for in the time of
Hyppocrates and Galen, the Chyrurgions were Physicians, and were great learned
men, and understood all parts of the art, and the nature of Medicines both
simple and compound, wherefore it was lawful for them to use all these
instruments generally and indifferently, but it is not so, for our
Chyrurgions, and that I will prove by the authority of Tagaultius, in his
institution of Chyrurgerie. The answer. You have said very well sir, and by
him I am very well content to be judged, for he is both a man of excellent
learning, and also worthy to have perpetual fame, for his painful travail
in that excellent book of Chyrurgerie, and that we may the sooner come to our
purpose, I will recite a few of his sayings, whereas he declares what the art
of Chyrurgerte is, and what manner of man he must be, and what properties he
must have, that ought to use the same art, how he should be trained up in the
same art, and what is the subject of the same, and what be the things that he
must cure the same subjects with, and with what instruments the same must be
cured.

Now I will recite you certain sentences, as hereafter follows, which are
taken forth of the same book of Tagaultius, that you before have alleged,
and I trust being well and indifferently construed, shall make more with my
sayings than with yours.

The words of Johannes Tagaltius, declared in his book upon the art of
Chirurgerie.
TO the exact knowledge of the art or science, which is called Chyrurgerie, it
behooves ye Artist to know four things. First, what Chyrurgerie is, what is
the matter subject to Chirurgerie, what is ye end of Chirurgerie, and also what
order is to be observed and kept in the learning of Chirurgerie. And we do
know what Chirurgerie is by three manner of ways. First, by the Etimologie of
the word or name, by his definition, and by his division: Chirurgerie after his
Etimologie, is called the operation with the hand, for it is named Apo tes
chiros, cai tou ergou, that is to say, of the hand, and his work, because
this Art is exercised by the administration with the hand, and hereof comes
it to pass, that the minister with the hand is called Chirurgus, that is to
say, a Surgeon: Chirurgerie according to the assentiall definition, is an
Art, which by the administration of the hand, does expel and drive away
sickness out of man's body, whereof chiefly and principally it takes cure
and charge, or else Chirurgerie is an art, which by the cunning working with
the hand, does put away or remove the sicknesses or diseases of man's body.
The matter subject to the art of Surgery, and the whole intention which the
Artist does occupy himself about, is only man's body, subject to diseases
and infirmities, which diseases and infirmities requires the help of
medicaments, ministered by the hand: For all things that the art of Chirurgerie
does find out either by reason or experience, it teaches the same to be done
by the administration of the hand, to the utility and profit of man's body.
Furthermore, Chyrurgerie is divided into two parts, that is to say, into
Theorike and Practike. The Theorike part does teach, and is a science obtained
by demonstration, and by knowing the principles of the art. This part a man may
have, although he never exercise or practice any part of the same, as the
learned Physicians and other learned men which daily reads the principles of
Chirurgerie: But the Practike part of Chirurgerie, is an art which does
rightly and readily, by the administration of the hand use such things as are
invented amongst mechanical arts, which part no man can be perfect in, except
he be brought up and exercised in the same. And does both continually see
other expert men work in the same art, and diligently observe such things as
he does see wrought.

Now these two parts are commonly exercised about these griefs, with their
accidents, that is to say, tumors against nature, green wounds, ulcers,
fractures, and dislocations, with such like, which requires the help of the
hand. Therefore there are required four things in a good Chyrurgion: first,
that he be learned and very skillful in the principles of his art: secondly,
yt he be well brought up under some cunning man, and well experienced: thirdly,
yt he be ingenious and wise: fourthlie, that he be of good and honest manners,
and of a virtuous life. The erudition and learning of a Chyrurgion does consist
in knowledge of natural things, things not natural, and things against
nature. The experience of a Chyrurgion does consist in those things that are
found out by reason, and confirmed by daily use and experimenting of them, for
otherwise he will be accounted a r^e emperike, which joined not reason with
experience. To be ingenious and wise, it is very necessary, for he ought to
have a ready wit to conceive things, and a firm memory in calling of them to
remembrance, a discreet and right judgment, an excellent perfection in
working, a diligent and ready wit in inuenting and finding out of remedies to
help his grieved Patient withal. The manners and conditions required in a
Surgeon, is boldness, and a mind void of fear, in necessary things, and
in the time of necessity, and not to be too rash in matters of doubt and
peril, gentle and mild toward his Patients, and to those of his profession,
to be courteous and gentle, yea, and as the Greeks call him Philitairos, that
is a lover of his fellows, he ought also to be prudent and circumspect in
prognosticating, virtuous and temperate of life, merciful toward the poor,
and not greedy of money, having these properties, he may proceed orderly in
learning the art of Chyrurgerie: and the order to be observed in the same, is
to begin with easy things, (or as we may term them) common things, to
particular, or from universal things, to those that be less universal, also
from things most manifest and known, to things more obscure, dark, and
unknown.

Hitherto we have spoken of that part which does appertain to the knowledge of
Chyrurgerie, and now we will entreat of the execution and operations of the
same. The operations which a Surgeon executes about the body of man, yt he
may bring to pass his intended scope and desired end, are three, that is, to
divide and separate things contained, to join and unite together that which is
divided, and to take away that thing which is superfluous. We divide and
separate that thing which is contained by incision and excision, and by letting
of blood and scarification: we do also join and unite together that which is
divided, by consolidating of wounds, and restoring of members dislocated, into
their proper places, and curing of fractures. We take away that which is
superfluous, by remoouing of tumors against nature, as Ganglia, Nodus,
Cancers, Strumas, Mirmecias, and by drawing of water out of the bellies of such
as have the Dropsy, or by cutting off such members as be superfluous, and to
do those things quickly and readily, with a good zeal toward his patient,
and not to make any vain promises for money, or to take in hand those grifes
which cannot be cured, and that he may more perfectly, readily, and safely,
do those things, it is requisite that he do consider three special
indications, according to the saying of Galen, yt is to say: First, the
conservation of those things which be natural, and the expulsion of those
which be against nature: The second indication shows whether we may bring to
pass and fulfill that which the indication does require, that is, whether we
can conserve that which is natural, and take away that which is against
nature: The third indication is that which finds out remedy, and does
declare unto us with what things we may accomplish that which the first
indication requires, and the second gives leave to be done: touching the
indication which consists in the conservation of natural things, they be
six, that is to say, health, or a natural aptness, in doing the actions.

The cause of health, the effects of health, which is the action according to
nature: strength, which does always contend against sickness: custo^e which is
like another nature: Complections and temperaments which are to be conserved
and kept, be their like. Now, for those things which be against nature, which
we ought to expel and drive away, are three in number, that is, sickness,
which is an effect against nature of it self, and first hurts the action,
the cause of sickness, and the accidents, or Symptomata, which follows the
sickness, as the shadow does the body: All these things are cured and put
away by their contrary, but forasmuch as the expulsion or curation of things
does principally consist either in simple or in compound things.

Note, that which is simple is cured by his contrary, and that which is
compound, by their contraries.

Solution of vn^itie. Heat. Coldness. Dryness. Moistness. Superfluous,
quantity. Quantity diminished. Abounding, in number Number diminished.
Obstruction. Straightness. Enlarging. Figure altered. Luxation.
by Unition. Coldness. Heat. Moistness. Dryness. Diminution. Augmentation.
Taking away. Putting to. Opening. Enlarging. Astriction. Reduction to his
form Restoring to his place.

In like manner in compound sicknesses, we must both consider the contrariety
of every simple sickness, and also in applying apt and convenient medicaments
for the same: But the indication for applying remedies is taken of that
sickness, which must first be cured, and that whose cure is the curation of
another, and that without whose cure, the other cannot be cured, yea, and that
which most grieueth the Patient, and is most dangerous, is first to be cured.
The second indication is that which shows whether we may bring to pass that
which the first indication does require, yt is to conserve things natural, and
to expel those that be against nature, therefore this indication is taken of
things natural, as whether health may be restored or not, and whether the
strength of the patient suffices for life or not, and whether the cause of
health may be conserved, and so of the rest. The indication taken of things
against nature, is whether we may cure the sickness, with his accidence or
not, and whether we may resist the cause of these two, or not, and this is to
be known three ways. First, when the sickness of his own proper nature is
incurable, as Elephantiasis absolute, and as they term it, confirmed, or when
the sick patient refuses his necessary remedies, when the diseases are
curable. As for example, the cutting away of a member, in which there is a
Cancer, etc. Or when the curation brings a worse and more perilous disease,
as old Cancer being cured, or continual Emorodes, for if you cure these,
there is danger of life, or of madness, or of consumption. Now, the third
indication does teach convenient remedies for their curation, their use, and
instruments, wherewith it is brought to pass.

The first of these instruments is an apt diet or regiment in ye vi. things not
natural. The second is, Pharmacon (which he understands for purging
medicaments.) Also letting of blood, with plasters, unguents, pouders, etc.
But in the two first, the Surgeon must consult with the learned and grave
Physician. There be many iron instruments, beside these medicinal instruments,
which be both proper and common for this art, as hereafter follows.

Thus far we have spoken the words of Tagaltius, as they be set forth in his
book of Chirurgerie, as well for his definition of Chirurgerie, as for the
antiquity thereof, and also what manner of conditions he ought to have, what
learning he ought to be brought up in, and what he ought to learn first, and
what last, and what is the matter or subject proper to his art, and what
instruments the artist must have, both common and proper, to (...) and bring to
pass withal his desired scope and (...) of his work, which is the curation
of man's body in these things that he has charge of. This is the effect of
the words of Franciscus Valleriolus, as well as of Johannes Tagaultius, as it
may appear in their words here above written Now my friend, where you did
allege Tagaultius to prove yt a Surgeon ought not to minister diet and
Purgations, neither yet any inward medicines, for that you say, it does
property appertain to Physic, it seems to me by the words of Tagaultius,
that it makes little for your purpose.

Objection. No sir, by your saying both Valleriolus and Tagaultius says the
contrary, do not they say, that a Surgeon ought not to give inward
medicines, without the counsel of a Physician? and declares what
inconvenience has come by the indiscreet ministering of the same? I take this
to be a sufficient proof.

The answer. No not so sir, we may not confound the instruments, which are
necessary to an Art, because that some Artists do abuse their instruments,
neither Tagaultius nor Valleriolus mean so, but their meaning was, that those
that did practice the Art of Chyrurgerie, which did not understand or know
the principles of their art, neither the causes of diseases, nor yet the
diseases themselves, nor how to take indication for the curation, neither yet
knows the nature of the medicines which he does minister.

These be they that Tagaultius and other learned men do reprove, which I must
needs confess, ought not only to be forbidden in inward medicines, but also
outward medicines, for if I should speak of all mischiefs that has been done
by the applications of outward medicines, how some has been maimed and undone
for ever, and other some brought to death, the number of them would seem very
strange unto you, and therefore we will let it pass at this time, with prayer
unto almighty God for his merciful help herein, that he may move the heart
of the Prince, with the Magistrates of this Realm, to take such order for the
safeguard of the people, and for the honor of this Realm, and for that that
learned men may be the better encouraged to study this art. But as concerning
the instruments, there is neither these two men, neither yet any other before
their time, since the time of Galen, that has forbidden the use of them to the
Surgeon, for both these men does put the^ in their books, as most common
and special instruments, affirming them as most special instruments pertaining
to the art of Chirurgerie, that without these, those evil and vicious humors
that hinders the curation of ulcers, tumors against nature, etc. cannot be
purged away, neither can the temperaments and other natural things of the
body be kept in perfect state, without an apt and meet diet. But for to
counsel with the Physician, being a grave and learned man, in the principles
of this art: In matters of weight, I take it to be very necessary, for what
is he that is wise, that will refuse the counsel of a wise and a learned man,
and specially of him that professes the principles of the same art, for
Phisiologia, whereof the Physician takes his name, is the first and chiefest
part, which he that works in the art of medicine does prove, for that it
does consist in the knowledge of the seven natural things, and in the residue
thereunto appertaining. But yet this does not follow, that a learned an expert
Chyrurgion should not use diet and Purgations, and other inward medicines at
all times when need does require: for if you would so understand it, one part
of their sayings should repugne against another, and so confound the whole, but
their mening was, that the unlearned Chirurgions, and these that be young men,
which be not well practiced, that they should take counsel as well of the
learned Physician, as of the learned Chyrurgion, for this Art is so ioyneed
together, that neither may the parts be divided, neither yet the
Instruments, without the overthrow and destruction of she whole Art, for it
was never perfect before the time of Hyppocrates, till that he joined all
these parts and Instruments together, and taught a perfect method and way of
curing, by a right using and ministering of the same.

I for my part have read no few authors, not only of ye Grecians, but also of
ye Arabians, and of ye Latinists, yet could I never ^nde, in any of their
worke^, that they do write of Chirurgerie, where they do leave out diet and
parging medicines, and apointing the Surgeon only to cure with outward
medicines, for I am certain, yt in all their scope of curing, both of tumors
against nature, of ulcers, etc. That their first indication is, to take away
those evil affected which may let the curatio^, (that is to say) to remove
away these evil humors, which might repair unto the grieved part, and also to
alter such distemperatures, by convenient diet, and other things, as might be
hurtful unto the same, and then to proceed with local remedies, by outward
application unto the grieved part.

This is Galens doctrine also, that no strong medicine shall be outwardly
applied, for the resolving of inflammations, before the body be purged. And
furthermore, in virulent, and malignant ulcers, which Galen names Cacoethe,
and where the body is full of evil and vicious humors, which humors, Galen
calls Caccochimia, these faith Galen, must be purged away, before we proceed
to the cure of the ulcer, for otherways, the ulcer may not be cured, and if it
be, it will come again, either in the same place, or else in some other, or
else the same humors not being euacuated, may be the cause of some other
greater disease, in the body, worse then that which was cured, wherefore Galen
does reprove Thesalus, in his fourth book called Therapenticon, saying,
Thesalus goes about to cut away the lips of the ulcer, and to apply his
Malagma, of Mustard seed, by means whereof he has inflamed all the part,
and made the ulcer worse, then it was before, not taking any indication of the
affect, neither yet of the cause thereof, by means whereof, he committed great
error, as Galen does say, and was accounted for a rude emperike, and for an
unskillful Physician.

Objection. Why sir, it seems to me by your words, and by the saying of
these men, yt be learned in the art, that Physic and Chirurgerie are both
one art, and I will assure you, if these words be true, which you recite of
Hippocrates and Galen, that they were both Physicians and Chirurgions, and used
all the whole art together, then I must needs conceeue, that the using of all
these parts together, made them so excellent men, and of such notable fame,
and that your dividing the art in two parts, and exercising the same
severally, has made you that be both Phisitio^s and Chirurgions, inexpert, to
the great detriment, and ill report of the whole art. Wherefore I most
heartily desire you, for that yt I may know, both the art, and the artist the
better, to declare the division of these five parts, which you have spoken of
before, perteining unto these artists.

Sir, I will right gladly do the best that I can, to satisfy your desire,
although I have not that learning, in the Greek and Latin tongue, which I
would wish for your sake, that I had, and also which this art does require in
him, that shall presisely set footh the same, yet with the little learning that
I have, and according to reason and experience, which two be the foundatio^s of
every art, as Galen does say in his third book, de Methodo medendi, I will
do my endeavor, to declare unto you these parts, in as few words as I can,
desiring you to accept my good will, and if I have left out any thing, by the
reason of ye briefness of my writing, which other learned men do find fault
with all, the^ I most heartely desire them, both for courtesy, and humanity
sake, to amend the faults that they shall find, and in so doing, they shall not
only be profitable to the common wealth, in the furtheraunce of this art, but
also bind me during my life, to honor them, serve them, and love them, and
encourage me to take further pains, to the uttermost of my power.

Now that we may accomplish our former talk, as concerning these five parts,
pertaining to the art of medicine, which have been set out, by these names, of
the ancient Physicians, long before Galens time, as I have declared unto you
before.

The parts. Phisiologia. Pathologia. Hygiena. Semiotica. Theraputica.
Partaining to the art of medicine.
The first part called Phisiologia, is that which does consider the unnatural
things, whereof the body of man is made, as Elements, temperaments, humors,
members, spirits, virtues, and operations. The Elements be four, as Fire,
Air, Water, and Earth. The humors be four, also: as Blood, Choler, Phlegm,
Mela^choly. And the temperaments be four likewise, as hot, cold, moist, and
dry. These four are the matter, whereby all the members of the body are made
with, the temperamentes, and spirits, therein contained, and he that shall
cure the body of man rightly, must chiefly understand, how to co^serue every
one of these, by their like, and to expel and remove from them, their
contraries. For the knowledge of these, it does behoue the artist to have long
experience, and chiefly in that part, which we call the Anathomie of man's
body, which is the dividing and seperating of dead bodies, that we may thereby
understand all the parts of the same body, with their position, figure,
number, place, nature, temperature, office, and affects, and also to know their
names, and true divisions, and which be similer, and which be compound, and
isntrumental, for of the simuler and simple members, the compound are made.

Simuler parts, be these, bones, cartilages, ligamentes, membranas, or
panicles, flesh, nerves, arteries, veins, fatness, and the skin. These be
called simuler parts, whereof the isntrumental or compound parts are made,
and some requires more of these, and some less, according to the necessity
of the member, for some member does require all these, and some does not.

The compound or isntrumental members, be the head, the heart, the liver, the
legs, the eyes, and all other like. Which member both simuler, and compounde,
the Surgeon ought to know, with their natures, temperatures, and actions,
and their other necessary properties, or else he cannot rightly cure them,
when they are grieved, and hurt. But in the curing of them that he hurt, he
shall distemper them that be quiet, for how can he conserve the right
temperament of any thing, whose temperature he knows not, that is impossible,
except it be by chance, as the blind man shoots at a Crow, and hitteth one
by misfortune, or as Galen does compare him, which knows not the parts of
man's body, with their nature, unto a blind Carpinter, which cannot see his
work, cutting more or less, then is necessary, by means whereof, his
work does never come to a good perfection. Therefore, who so ever is not
expert, as I have said before in the temperamentes, and natures of these
parts, he can neither cure wounds, nor ulcers, neither yet any other thing
rightly, neither can he tell by what way the ulcer, or wound shall be cured,
neither whether it may be cured, or not, neither yet, whether any cause do
remain, that may let the curation, neither how to remove the same, nor whether
nature and strength, may suffer the same causes to be removed, nor how to
maintain the strength, and temperaments of the same body, for he being
ignorant in these seven natural things, whereof the body of man consists,
which body being subject to the art of medicine, he must of necessity I say,
be also ignorant, not only of the preservation of health, with his
temperaments, but also to be ignorant in the curation of hurtes, and diseases,
which chances unto our bodies.

Wherefore in few words, I have proved here, both by reason and by
experience, that the knowledge of this part named Phisiologia, does chiefly,
and specially, apertein to the art of Chirurgerie, and without the knowledge
hereof, we shall never rightly, or methodically, cure any manner of wou^d,
grief, or disease, neither is he worthy to take the name of a Physician,
neither yet of a Surgeon, but to be called by the name of an Emprike, or
experimenter, curing only by chance, without any reason, but even as the
blind Carpenter, which Galen has spoken of before, sometime cutting to much,
and some time to little, and many times marring all his work, for want of
skill, ere that he beware.

Now to conclude, for this first part, he that will be further instructed
herein, let him read Hip. de natura hominis, humoribus, elamentis, de natura
and formatione fetus, and many other books of Hyppocrates, and chiefelie that
where he divided the similer parts. As Osteotome, that is to say, the division
of the bones, Condrotome, the Cartalages. Syndestmotome, the ligaments,
Arteriotome, the Arteries, Phlebotomae, veins, Neurotome, the nerves, Miotome,
dividing of the Muscles, Tenontotome, the tendons, etc. There be diverse other
books of Galen, which be very profitable to be read for this matter, as his
books of Anathomie, also his books De temperamentis, de optima corporis
constitutione, de facultatibus naturalibus, de placitis Hippocrates, and
Platonis, de motu musculorum, de causis respirationis, and many more worthy
books of his, which we will let pass. There be many other books also,
written by diverse men, as Guido and other, which do entreat of these
natural things, and specially of the Anatomy of man's body, and for that you
may the easilier and better understand these natural things which every
Surgeon ought to know and have in perfect memory, to that end he may remove
those things which does hurt them, or let them of their perfect operation,
which you may easily know if you understand their natures and properties, and
figures, etc. Which Table follows hereafter, as you may heholde.

Natural things. Eelements be four, Fire. Air. Water. Earth.
Temperaments. Simple be four, Hot. Cold. Moist. and Dry.
Equal one, Co^pound be four. Hot and Dry. Hot and moist. Cold and moist.
Cold and dry.

Four humors, Sanguine. Flegmatike. Cholerike. and Melancholy.
Members. Similer. Bones, veins, arteries, cartilage, flesh, fatness,
pannicle, ligament, nerves, and skin.
co^pound Head, heart, liver, lungs, arms, and legs.

Three faculties. Animal. Vital. and Natural.
Operations or actions. Animal Feeling. and moving.
Vital. Beating of the pulse. And breathing.
Natural Generatio. Auctio. and Nutritio.
Spirits be three in number Animal Vital. Natural
In The brain. The Heart. The Liver.



Pathologia is that part of the art, which has the knowledge of sickness
against nature, with their Symptoma and accident, and they be three in number,
that is to say, sickness it self, the cause of sickness, and the accidents,
which follows after sickness: sickness it self may come two ways, either
of outward causes, or of inward causes, we do commonly call the outward causes
primative, the Greeks call them Cathertica, the inward causes, we do co^monlie
name Antecedent, or Internam. The affectes commonly follow these causes, and
if the affectes come of outward causes, then commonly they be wounds,
contusions, fractures, dislocations, biting of mad dogs, and of serpents, etc.
If they come of inward causes, then they make tumors against nature, as
Phlegmo^, Eresipula, Oedema, Sirrhus, with many kind of malignant and
stubburne ulcers, to be cured, which tumors and ulcers cannot be made whole,
except their causes with their evil affects, may be removed and taken away: I
suppose that there is no man, but he will judge this part of the art chiefly
to pertain to Chyrurgerie, for that it takes cure of wounds, ulcers, and
tumors against nature, as I have said before.

Then if this part do appertain to the art of Chyrurgerie, as it is most
certain it does, it behooves the Chyrurgion perfectly and rightly to
understand what kind of sicknesses there be, with their differences and names,
what parts of the body these sicknesses may be in, and what manner of
sickness it makes in the same parts. As for example, evil complexion
makes a distemperature in the similer parts, and evil constitution, or evil
composition, makes a deformity or imbecilitie in the isntrumental parts.
And solution of unity or continuitie, chances both in the similer parts,
and isntrumental. And all these do appertain to the Surgeon, to have most
exact knowledge of, for he that takes upon him to cure an ulcer or a wound, or
any other manner of grief, and does not know the nature of the parts, neither
yet what part it is in, neither yet the cause, neither how to remove ye same
cause, it is impossible, as I have said before, that he should cure the same
griefs or diseases rightly. And therefore these blind emperikes that have
neither reason nor method, to lead them to do those things which they daily
do, I say, their doings are so pernicious, that many people takes great
hurt thereby (shall I say hurt) nay rather brought to utter destruction, and
many times to death. The Symptoma or accidents which follows sickness, is
also divided into three parts. The first is, the quality being altered, as
with vehement heat in Phlegmon. The action or function hurt, but not utterly
deprived. The action utterly deprived and taken away. For these causes above
rehearsed, it is specially required, that a Surgeon should be learned, and
also to have great experience, that he may rightly judge and discern one
disease from another, with their natures and causes, to the end, that when you
come to the curation thereof, you may take right indications, what to do first,
what next, and so forth to the end, for other ways you may apply medicines
nothing fit for the purpose, but those that might do great harm, and you
might also apply those first that would be applied last, and those last which
should be applied first, and in the end mar all your works, as the blind
Carpenter does. Thus far I have proved for Phisiologia, to be one part of
Chyrurgerie, or of the Art of curing, as we may term it, and I think there
is no man that will count him to be a right Chyrurgion, that lacks this part
of the Art, or that is not very expert in the same. And for the further
knowledge hereof, there be certain books appointed of Galen, and other
ancient writers, that you may read concerning the same part as hereafter
follows.

Libro Hippocrates, de Morbis, libro Epedimsorum Hippocrates, Galen de locis
affectis, Galen de Morbis and Symptomatis, and de 4. temporibus morborum, Galen
de differentijs morborum causis and Smptomatis, Galen de inequali intemperie,
Galen de art Medica, Galen de tumoribus, praeter naturam. Hippocrates de
Vulneribus vlceribus, and Fistulis, fracturis, immorodibus, etc. And also Galen
in his whole Work called Therapeuticon, and in another work to his Disciple
Glaucon, as it is manifest to be seen. These two most excellent men being the
patrones and fathers of the art, have written most excellently and perfectly
of many diseases, as wounds, tumors against naturne, ulcers, and many other
diseases appertaining to the same art, as it may more manifestly appear in
these books above rehearsed, and in many other more of their works. If I
should write of all men that accounts this a proper and a principal part
of Chyrurgerie, then I must needs confess the truth, all men learned in this
art since the time of Galen, have so written, and so taken it. Thus I conclude
for this part, that he that understands it not, ye must give him a baser
name, ye may not call him a Surgeon, that neither knows the principles of
his art, neither yet the nature of his subject that he works upon.

I remember when I was in the wars at Mutterell, in the time of that most
famous Prince, King Henry the viii. there was a great rablement there, that
took upon them to be Chirurgions, some were sow gelders, and some horse
gelders, with Tinkers and Cobblers. This noble sect did such great cures, that
they got to themselves a perpetual name, for like as Thesalus sect were call
Thessalions, so was this noble rabble for their notorious cures, called Dog
leeches, for in two dressings they did commonly make their cures whole and
sound for ever, so that they neither felt heat nor cold, nor yet no manner of
pain after: but when the Duke of Norfolk, who was then general, understood
how the people did die, and that of small wounds, he sent for me and certain
other Chirurgions, commanding us to make search how these men came to their
death, whether it were by the grieuousnesse of their wounds, or by the lack
of knowledge of the Chyrurgions, and we according to our commandment, made
search throughout all the camp, and found many of the same good fellows, which
took upon them the names of Chirurgions, not only the names, but the wages
also: we asking of them whether they were Chyrurgions or no, they said they
were, we demanded with whom they were brought up, and they with shameless
faces would answer, either with one cunning man or another which was dead:
Then we demanded of them what Chyrurgerie stuff they had to cure men withal,
and they would show us a pot or a box which they had in a budget, wherein was
such trumperie as they did use to grease horse heels withal, and laid upon
scabbed horse backs, with neruall, and such like. And other that were Cobblers
and Tinkers, they used shoomakers wax, with the rust of old pans, and made
therewithal a noble salve, as they did term it. But in the end this worthy
rablement was committed to the Marsialsie, and threatened by the Dukes grace to
be hanged, for their worthy deeds, except they would declare the truth what
they were, and of what occupations, and in the end they did confess, as I have
declared to you before: whereupon the Dukes grace gave commandment that they
should avoid the Camp in pain of death, and if at any time they came within
the Camp afterward, they should immediately be hanged, as murderers, his
Grace calling them by the name of Dog leeches, commanding his Captains that
they should entertain no more such.

Thus you understand by what name those men were then called, which took upon
them unworthily to use this Art, knowing neither the principles of this art,
neither yet the nature of the diseases, nor yet the medicamentes wherewithal
they could cure the same diseases.

Thus we conclude with these examples before, that it is necessary for a
Surgeon to know these parts, or else not to be admitted to so worthy an
Art, which does take charge, not only of man's health, but also of their
lives and lims. And thus we end this part.

Eugiena is the third part, pertaining to the art of Chyrurgerie, or Medicine,
as we have said before. This part does consist in the six things not
natural, called Res non naturalis, which follows.

Six things not natural In receiving of the air. In Meat and Drink. In
sleeping and waking. In moving and rest. In fullness and emptiness. And in
affections of the mind.

This is also a special and a necessary part to be known of the Surgeon,
for without this knowledge he cannot give convenient diet, neither yet
convenient order for the government of the diseased and sick Patient, nor yet
at what time he should sleep, at what time he should eat and drink, or what
manner of meats and drinks he should have, and whether they should be
liquide in substance or gross and thick, neither shall he know whether the
same meat and drink may augment the disease or not, by means whereof, he
may give such diet to his patients, as may confirm their diseases. As for
example, in Elephantiasis, and Cancers, which by eating of melancholic meats,
or such meat and drink as does make adustion of the blood which does confirm
them. There might be many more things said of meat and drink, which is not
material to be spoken here, for I think no man doubts, but that this
instrument does chiefly appertain unto this Art, for it is not possible for
a Surgeon to cure his grieved patient, except he give convenient diet, and
with convenient diet many great grievous wounds, and many other cruel
sicknesses, by the help of other convenient medicines have been cured.

And as for the government by the air, every man that has any knowledge
will confess, yt cold sicknesses which are taken by cold, are to be cured in
places where ye air is warm, or else it ought to be made warm by art,
according to the time of the year, for it is one of the principles and
special rules which Galen commands us to keep, that we shall cure every
thing by his contrary, as heat by cold, cold diseases by hot things,
dryness by moisture, and moisture with those things that be dry, fullness
by abstinence, and euacuation by emptiness, by things of good nourishment to
fill withal, watching, by things that moves sleep, and over much sleep,
by keeping of them waking. Thus every thing is ouercommed and helped by his
contrary, by means whereof the Surgeon does more safely and readily
restore to health, his grieved and wounded patieut, without which things, and
their right use, could not be done. And therefore this part is called a most
necessary and principal thing appertaining to the Artist. There is another
utility in this part also, which the Surgeon of necessity must use, for
Galen says, that every Artist that will rightly cure, must intend two
things. The first is to conserve and keep every thing that is in good state,
by his like.

The second is to expel, and cure those things that be contrary to nature, by
their contraries, which we cannot do without these six things not natural.
Therefore it may be said, Necessitas non legem habet, therefore there ought no
law to be made against that thing that must be of necessity. As for example,
of necessity we must eat and drink, that we may live. Therefore it were
tyrannical to forbid us to eat and drink, for they be proper things for us
whereby we do live. But yet the abusing of meat and drink may be spoken
against, and good and just laws made for the reformation thereof.

In like manner for abusing the art of Physic or Chirurgerie, there has
been good and wholesome laws made heertofore, and I trust in our Lord God
shall be hereafter again. But to command from them the knowledge of their
art, or any part thereof, or other necessary instruments or medicaments,
wherewith they should cure their grieved and wounded Patients, which other
ways must of necessity perish, or else not be cured at all: Such
commandments or laws were tyrannical, and not to be well thought of, for
that they should let the works of mercy, in this most excellent art of
curing, to be ministered unto the people orderly for their safeguard, and curing
of their diseases.

There were much to be spoken of these six unnatural things, which makes
nothing for my purpose here in this place, for that I intend nothing but to
prove that these be necessary instruments, for the Art of Chyrurgerie, by
certain examples, as you have heard: for these things are spoken of at large,
not only in many worthy books, which are set forth by Hyppocrates and
Galen, but also in all other worthy men's books, that have written of this art
at large, as it may appear at this present day. Some men might here ask a
question, why these are called not natural things, for it is to be thought,
that sleep, meat, and drink, moving, etc. should be natural. But forasmuch
as both health and sickness does come by these things, therefore they be called
not natural. They be not called against nature: for sickness, the cause of
sickness, and the accidents that follow sickness, those be called Praeter
naturam, and against nature. Neither may they be called natural, for ye that
sicknesses comes by the^. But they are indifferently called not natural.
These things are so necessary for our bodies, as I have said before, yt we do
not only live by them, but ye matter and substanticall of our bodies, after
generation, is increased and maintained by them, and also all the humors and
temperaments with the spirits, and other things contained in the same body,
should utterly cease if it were not but for those six things. Thus I
conclude with these examples aforesaid, to prove this part to be necessary for
the art of Chirurgerie, doubting nothing, but those that be learned men and men
of reason will so judge, for so have the ancient fathers before our days,
appointed it to be. Now that you may the better come to the perfect knowledge
of these things, I think it good to declare unto you some of the books which
both Hyppocrates and Galen have written. Hyppocrates de elementis, Hyppo. de
Aqua Aere, and regionibus, Hyppo. de flatibus, Hyppo. de vrinarum differentijs,
Hyppo. de ratione victus salubris, Hyppo. de ratione victus prauatoru^, Galen
de sanitate tuenda, Galen de imperica, dieta sub figuratione, Galen de aqua,
Gal. de ptissana. Galen de Euchimia, and Caccochimia, Galen de attenuante and
crassante victu, with many more books, written by most excellent men, sense
their times, which were superfluous, here to be rehearsed, for as much as these
are most necessary to be understood, and sufficient for the proof hereof: And
thus I commit this part unto your friendly judgment, proceeding unto the
fourth part, called Semiotica.

Semiotica, is an other part, perteining to the art of Chirurgerie, which part
does judge by signs, and tokens, what the diseases are, and what be their
natures, and what humors or other things be the cause thereof, and whether they
may be cured easily, and in short time, or whether they be hard to be cured,
and must be cured in longer time, or if they cannot be cured at all. Or else
whether it is not necessary, that it be not cured at all, least worse
diseases, should come by the curation of them, and specially, this part is
necessary, about the curatio^ of wounds, to know which are deadly, and which
are not deadly, and also which are maimed, and which are not maimed, and to
foresee, dangerous and perilous accidents, which might chance unto the
wounded man, as paralisis, conuulsions, gangrena, spasalus, and many other
more dangerous diseases, which ye Chirurgio^ ought not only to foresee, by
means whereof he might resist the same. But also, when any of the grievous
accide^ts, do happen, he might make a good and a true prognosticatio^, what
might happen after these grievous, and perilous sicknesses, and also in wounds,
that chances in dangerous places, to prognosticate, and declare the great
peril thereof, unto the sick and grieved pacient, or else unto his friends,
as it shall be thought most convenient: for except he make a true and a just
prognostication, he shall get unto him self dishonestie, and cause the worthy
art, to be evil spoken of. This part of the Art can not be attained unto,
without great knowledge, and long experience, and also a most excellent wit.
For Hyppocrates, says, in his Aphorismus, that this part, is the most hardest,
he says, that the life of man is short, the art of medicine long, the
occasions to minister medicines many, proving of experiments, perilous, but
judgment, and prognostication of sickness, to be most difficult and hard.

Wherefore Hippocrates and Galen, did will all men, that would avoid slander,
and evil name, to beware, and wise, in prognosticating, and not to be rash
and quick. How many men have gotten dishonestie, for lack of knowledge of
this part of the Art, and by mistaking of the Symptomata, and accidents, it
were wonderful, to number them. And also how many sick men have been
overthrown, and undone, for lake of knowledge of the same part, it is not to
be spoken. Wherefore this part is most necessary, and requires most diligent
and exact study, as it does appear, both by Galen, and Hippo, in Galen,
where he has written vi. books, de differentiis and causis morborum, and
Symptomatum, which does chiefly perteine to this part of the Art. And also
that most excellent and worthy man Hippocrates, has written two divine
works, wherein is contained diverse books, the one called his Aphorismus, and
ye other his prognostications, which are the most worthiest books that ever
were written, for him that shall practice in this Art, for therein may he
learn the divine judgment of Hippo. And also how to prognosticate rightly,
which two things, do most chiefly and principally appertain to the Art of
Surgery. Thus I have declared unto you, ye four principal parts, or as we
may term them, the four principal pillars, or foundaments of this art,
without the knowledge of which four, no man may rightly, or methodically work,
in the same art. I dare not say, no man ought to work in this Art, that
understands not these, least I should condemn a great sort, but I will say,
as Hippocrates, Galen, Guido, Valleriolus, Tagaltius, and many other worthy men
do say, that these are the principles of the Art, and they ought first to be
learned, and trained up, in the knowledge of these, before they be permitted to
work in the Art, for in the old time, they did first learn their
principles, and had them by heart, and then they were brought up, under some
cunning master, where they might see the same put in practice, and so trained
up in most exact and perfect experience: And thus being brought up, they were
able to judge in their art, and so they did co^stitute and builded upon these
four principles, a most excellent art, which Galen calls Therapeuticon, that
is to say, the art of curing, which part, those that are disposed to read
their works may plainly understand, and specially in a book called
Introductio, seu medicus. Thus I have proved these four parts, as I have said
before, to be the Theorike part of Chirurgerie, and we intend to prove
Therapeuticon to be the practike part, for that it does cure diseases and
griefs of man's body. Guido, Tagaltius, and other, did not make these five
divisions of parts, as I have done, but divided the art into two parts, that
is, into the Theorike, and Practike: for Guido says, that he which would use
the art of Chirurgerie, must be learned in the Theorike part, as well as in the
Practike part, but Guido understands the Theorike part to be Physic, and
the Practike part to be Chirurgerie, as it may appear by his words hereafter.

Conditiones quae requiruntur in Chirurgo, sunt quatuor, prima est quod sit
literatus, secunda, quod sit expertus, tertia, quod sit ingeniosus, quarta,
quod sit morigeratus: Riquiritur quod sit Chirurgus literatus, non tantu^ in
principijs Chirurgiae, and sed etiam Phisicae tam in Theorica, quam in
Practica. In Theorica, oportet quod ipse cognoscat res naturales, and non
naturales, and contra naturam, precipue Anathomiam, nam, sine ipsa factum est
nihil, in Chirurgia. The English is this. There be four conditions specially
required in a Chyrurgion: first, that he be learned: second, that he be expert:
third, that he be ingenious, and fourth, that he be well mannered: It is
further requisite, that the Chyrurgion be not only learned in the principles
of Chirurgerie, but also in Physic, as well in Theorike as in Practike: In
Theorike, it behooves him to know things natural not natural, and things
against nature.

Thus it may manifestly appear by the words of Guido, that he understood
the Theorike part to be Philick, and the Practike part to be Chirurgerie, for
other divisions made he none, but used the art indifferently together, that is
to say, diet, purging medicaments, and all other things appertaining to the
art of Chirurgerie. These four parts that we have spoken off before, were
accounted to be Physic, as Guido and all other later writers do make
mention, and every one of them supposes, that a Chyrurgion ought to know
these parts, either else he cannot rightly and methodicallie work in his
art: But when he does understand these parts, and is well brought up in
experience in the same, and has also good understanding and knowledge both in
the simples and compounds, whereof he makes his medicaments, and has seen
long experience, and use of the same, I think him then a man meet and worthy
to be allowed to use the practike part of Chirurgerie, or else not, for
otherwise he should be ignorant in the curation of many grievous diseases,
which does appertain unto this art, that cannot be cured other ways, but by
the administration of the hand, for this part called Chirurgia is the last
remedy in the art of medicine, and cures those things which are most hard
and difficult to be cured, and therefore it is accounted amongst the ancient
writers, as both Galen and Hyppocrates do affirm, to be most profitable and
most worthy, as we shall declare more hereafter, in the Treatise of the
method of curing, called Therapeuticon. And thus we end this fourth part,
called Semiotica.

Now it does behoue us to speak of the last part called Therapeutica, and
although it be last in number, yet it is chief in effect, and most profitable
in the common wealth. For Therapeu is no other thing to be understood, than
Curatio, and Curatio is nothing else, but to help man's body of wounds,
sickness, and other infirmities, as I have said before.

Therefore Guido does say, that this art does restore man's body unto health
by the curation of wounds, ulcers, tumors against nature, fractures,
dislocations, and all other infirmities wherewith the same body is grieved.

And he adds and says further, as much as lies in the Surgeon to do.
For he says, that it lies not always in the Artist to restore his sick
patient to health, for that that many diseases be incurable, which the Artists
ought to understand, and know, and to make true, and right prognostication
thereof, least he should get unto himself great shame, and bring infamy and
slander to the noble art.

Therefore, one Vego, a Spaniard, who has made a worthy commentary upon the
prognostikes, of Hippo. says, that it does behoue ye artist chiefly, to
prognosticate rightly and truly, of those things, which are to come, which
being known, neither could the danger thereof be avoided if it were possible,
neither yet should ye artist avoid a slanderous and pernicious name. And
therefore he deuideth this art into three parts, that is, into agnostica,
prognostica, and curatiua, Agnostica, he understands to be, the knowledge of
natural things, of things not natural, and of things against nature.
Prognostica, he understands to be, a right judgment, in the foresaid
things, which he does gather by the Symptomata, of the body, and other
excrements which nature does avoid. Curatiua, is that part which follows
both these and with knowledge and right judgment, truly and rightly,
prognosticating the same, he does take upon him, perfectly to cure man's body,
of those griefs and diseases, wherewith it is hurt, either else, if the same
may not be cured, to preserve the same, from further vnco^uenience, as much as
is possible for this art to do.

Thus it seems to me, by ye words of this great learned man, as well as by
the words of Guido. etc. That this part of the art, called Therapeutica, or
curatio, consists in two special points, (that is to say) in the curing of
man's body perfectly, and in the preservation of the same body, when the
diseases are incurable, as in Cancers. etc. as we have said before.

There be other learned men that divide this Art, but into two parts, that is
to say, into Theorica, and Practica, Theorike, does consist in the exact and
perfect knowledge of these four parts, which we have spoken of before, that
is to say, in Phisiologia, Pathologia, Eugiena, and Simiotica.

And the five parts named Therapeutica, does consist in the right practicing
and using of convenient remedies, to cure man's body with all, by the help,
understanding, and true knowledge of those things above specified, and for as
much as this part, does bring to pass by an operation, and practice done with
the hand, or ministered by the hand, therefore this part is called Practica,
that is to say, practicing and putting in use all such necessary things, as
may apperteine, either for ye curatio^, or preservation of man's body. And for
as much, as these two things are brought to pass and done, by certain ways
and means, which reason has invented, and experience has found true, and
without these things, we can not rightly cure, or bring to pass ye desired
scope or end of our Art, which we do intend. Therefore, it follows of
necessity, that we must needs use them, either else we shall not use the
practike part, which is the only end, and function of our vocation and Art.
And these things be commonly termed instruments, which instruments are appointed
of Almighty God, to help up in the time of need, for without these, we can
do nothing in this Art. The first is diet, the second is medicaments, the
third is our hands, to minister the same with all, and these are named general
instruments, and also special, for that, that all the ancient fathers, and
most excellent men of this Art, did always so use them.

Wherefore, I think there is no reasonable man, or any that is learned in this
Art, that will say the contrary, except he will wilfully, and willingly,
condemn both reason and experience, and not only experience and reason, but
also these two most worthy and famous men, Hippocrates, and Galen. This part
or those that use it, has also found out many notable medicaments, with their
natures, and hidden properties, which otherwise, by the Theorike part could
never be found out, yet by long practice and experyence, the natures,
qualities, and hidden properties, are found out, to no small help of the Art
of medicine, for by their natures and qualities, they are methodically used,
and do cure griefs, and diseases, as sicknesses, which be hot, are cured by
cold things, those that be moist by dry things, etc. But those which do
cure by hidden properties, are such, as no reason can be made unto, as for
example. To expel venim, either in the pestilence, or in Morbo camilliontiaci,
in lepra, or in biting of any venomous beast, these are rather cured, with
medicaments, which does it of property, rather then quality. Thus it does
behoue the artist, which will deal in this part, called Therapeutica or
practica, not only to have perfect knowledge, in all these things aforesaid,
but also to have a very exact knowledge of all such simples, as he will make
his medicaments of, or as he does intend to minister unto man's body, any manner
of way, not only as is said before, their natures, and temperaments, but also
their qualities, and hidden properties: and also ye times, when they should be
gathered, how they should be kept, and preserved, how long they will continue
in there virtue, and strength, and whether they be of more force and virtue when
they be green, or when they be dry. All these things does apperteine unto
the Artist to know, and also, to what use he ought to minister the same, and
what commodity may come thereby. These things, as I have said unto you
before, are known two manner of ways, that is to say, by reason, and
experience, neither can they be known by any third way, as Galen says in his
third book, named Therapeuticon.

Therefore it is requisite, yt this Artist be not only learned, in the Theorike
part, as we have said before, but also, to be learned and brought up, under
some cunning man, which has good knowledge in ye same art, or otherways, it
is not possible, to come to the exact and perfect knowledge thereof, which is
chiefly and principally required. If I should tell you, of the ungracious
witchcraftes, and of the foolish and mischiuous abuses, and misuses, that have
been in times past, and yet in our days continually used, ye would not a
little marvel thereat. But for as much, as it has not only turned to the
dishonor of God, but also, the state of ye common wealth: I have thought it good
to declare unto you, part of their wicked doings, that it may be unto you which
professes this Art, an example, to avoid the like most wretched deeds. These
things, I do not speak to you of heresay, but of mine own knowledge. In ye
year. 1562. I did see in the two Hospitalls of London, called S. Thomas
Hospital, and saint Bartholomewes Hospital, to the number of CCC. and odd
poor people, yt were diseased of sore legs, sore arms, feet, and hands,
with other parts of the body, so sore infected, that a hundredth and twenty of
them could never be recovered, without loss of a leg, or an arm, a foot or
a hand, fingers, or toes, or else their limbs crooked, so that, they were
either maimed, or else undone for ever. All these were brought to this
mischief, by witches, by women, by counterfeit iauills, that took upon them
to use the Art, not only robbing them of their money, but of their limbs, and
perpetual health. And I with certain other, diligently examining these poor
people, how they came by these grievous hurtes, and who were their Chirurgio^s
that looked unto them, and they confessed, that they were either witches, which
did promise by charms, to make the^ whole, or else some women which would make
them whole with herbs, and such like things, or else some vacabound iauil,
which runs from one country to an other, promising unto them health, only
to deceive them of their money.

This fault and crime, of the undoing of this people, were laid unto the
Chirurgions, I will not say, by part of those that were at that time masters
of the same Hospitalls, but it was said, that Carpinters, women, weuers,
cobblers, and tinkers, did cure more people, then the Chirurgions. But what
manner of cures they did, I have told you before, such cures, as all ye world
may wonder at: yea, I say such cures, as makes the devil in hell to dance
for joy, to see the poor members of Jesus Christ, so miserably tormented.

What shall I say, here unto, but lament and pray unto our Lord Jesus Christ,
for his precious blood sake, that he shed upon the cross, to illuminate the
hearts of the magistrates, for amendment hereof. And that this rablement of
runagates, with witches, baudes, and the devils sothsaiers, with tinkers,
cobblers, and sow gelders, and all other their wicked coherents, of these same
devilish and wicked sects, which does thus abuse this noble art of medicine,
to the utter defasing of the same, may be reformed and amended, and every one
to get their living with truth, in the same arts yt they have been brought up
and well experie^ced in, either else to be greuouslie punished, as they be in all
other Countries, and as they have been here in this Country in times past.
For seeing there is laws made for him that steals a sheep, an ox, or an
horse, which is but a beast and serves to man's use, and he that loses the
same, loses no more but the value of the use thereof, why may it not be as
well considered for the loss of an arm or a leg? yea, and many times of the
life, which these wicked generation do spoil, I think the Prince is bound in
conscience, as well to punish those false and wicked pernicious deceivers, which
does not only destroy the lims of man, but his life, as to punish these
which steal sheep, oxen, or horses. Of this sort I think London to be as well
stored, as the Country, I think there be not so few in London as three score
women, that occupies the art of Physic and Chirurgerie. These women, some
of them be called wise women, or holy and good women, some of them be called
Witches, and uses to call upon certain spirits, and some of them uses plain
bauderie, and tells Gentlewomen that cannot bear children how they may have
children. What manner of other sorts and sects there be of these, as some for
sore breasts, some for the stone and Strangurie, some for pain of the teeth,
some for scald heads, some for sore legs, some cunning in Mother Tomsons
tubbe, and some to help maids when they have lost their maidenhead, when
their bellies are grown too great, to make the^ small again, with a thousand
more. Galen in his book of sects, did never make mention of the fourth part so
many, I think, if this worshipful rablement were gathered together, they
would make a greater profession than ever did ye Monks, the Friars, and the
Nuns, when they did swarm most in London.

This unprofitable company have so increased within the City of London, that
all the Countries in England have taken insample thereof, yea, and at this day
all the Countries in Christendom may wonder at our laws in suffering and
maintaining of them.

Well I say, we will let all these pass, with tinkers, cobblers, souters, and
sow gelders, and a great many of occupations more, whereof, some comes out of
France, some out of Germany, and so of other countries, some for religion, and
some for picking of purses. etc. All these now, are become great Phisicions,
and Chirurgions, to no small advancement of this noble Art of Medicine, for
their noble and worthy cures, does bear witness thereof, and gives so good
report unto them, that at this day, the learned Phisicions and Chirurgions, may
not a little rejoice. Well, I say no more, but God amend all, and except these
things be quickly amended, I think the diseased people, and such as have
ulcers, wounds, diseases, and sores, are like to have small help, and if it
shall chance, the prince to have wars, then are this company that I have
spoken of, like to serve, and I doubt nothing, but that the soldiers shall have
great courage to fight, for so much, as they shall have, such a goodly company
of Chirurgions, to cure them, when they be wounded. As for other Chirurgions,
there will be but a few left, except better order be taken, and that with
speed. Well, now we will proceed to our matter again.

Now my well-beloved brethren, ye have hard of this ungracious company, with
their damnable deeds, which may be unto you, an example, to encourage you, to
fly ignorance, and to learn the exact, and methodicall way of curing,
according to knowledge, and also to know these things, that does appertain
unto the same, not only these v. parts, above rehearsed or three, or two, as
it seems good to you, to divide them, for it is not material, as Galen
says, so that you understand the thing. Not only these, I say, ought to be
perfectly known, but also, all medicines, both simple, and compou^d, with
their natures and properties, their operations, and right applicatio^s, and at
what time the same ought to be ministered, to what parts of the body, and for
what griefs and diseases: and also, according to right indications taken, what
ought to be first ministered, what next, and so to the last.

All these things, as I have said, do appertain unto the right and true
Surgeon, not only to know, but also orderly to follow, or else he shall be
accounted an emprike, and little better then one of these rude rablement, which
I have spoken of before. Wherefore, my well beloved brethren, that use this
art of Chirugria, I exhort you in the name of Almighty God, that you your
selves, be not only diligent in learning of all these parts, and other
things, necessary, appertaining unto your art: by means whereof, not only
murder, and other grievous misfortunes, which might happen, through your
ignorance, may be avoided, but also perpetual slander, with all other infamous
report, and displeasure, may be likewise avoided also. And that in like manner,
your servant, and children, which you do intend to bring up in this Art, be
learned, not only to write and read, but also in the tongues, that he may
more exactly understand these parts, as I have said before. And so by this
means, you shall not only restore the Art, again unto her good name, which
is almost lost, at this present day, through that foul and ugly monster,
ignorance, but also get unto your selves, perpetual honor, and good fame.

And furthermore, by your excellent knowledge, and virtuous lives, and cunning
deeds, which follows after, and are the fruits of knowledge, by these
things, I say, and with the help of the high and mighty Lord God, you shall
abolish and put down, these wicked and pernicious sects, which are no less
unprofitable, unto Gods people, in the common wealth of their countries, then
caterpillars, and Grassehoppers, are unto the fruits, and herbs of the
ground, which sects, be not only pernicious, as I have said before, but
perilous, and selaunderous, unto you, that be the true professers of the Art,
for they call themselves, by the name of Physicians or Chirurgions: And the
simple ignorant people, do so receue them, or think them to be, but in
deed, they be such as Christ speaks of, where he says, yt they come in
sheep clothi^g, and be raueni^g wolves, so these come with good names, and be
crafty, and pernicious deceauers, which are to be driven out of every good
commonwealth.

Thus (most gentle Reader) I have troubled you with a long talk, desiring you
to bear with my simple and rude style, wishing with all my heart, that it had
been better, and desiring you most humbly where you find any fault,
courteously to amend the same, or else to give me knowledge, and I shall be as
willing to amend them, as I have been diligent in setting it forth, praying you
to leave off slanderous words and evil judgment: by means whereof I have
been greatly impaired, not only in my good name, but also in the profit and
commodity of my art, which is to my great hinderaunce: and this has partly
risen by a book of Chirurgerie which I have lately set forth, to my great
cost and charge, and some men have not let to say, that it was only Doctor
Cuninghams doing, and none of mine. Unto whom I answer. That Cuningham was
the writer thereof, and put the same book in order, as you may now see, for I
my self having not perfect understanding of the tongues, required him, for the
more perfection thereof, to put in the Greek and Latin words, in such sort as
he thought good. And for the matter in the most part therein contained, you may
very well perceive that it was mine own practice, as the stories therein
contained for the curation of diverse people, does declare, which I my self did
cure, as it may more at large appear in the same book. And for the medicines
yt be written in the same book, their names which devised the same medicines,
are put unto the^, so yt this is but a slanderous, untrue, and malicious
report, only to deface me of my good name, without any deserving or cause
reasonable.

For it is well known, that Master Cuningham never did any such cures, as
there is mention made of, neither yet is Master Cuningham any Chyrurgion, as
ye may perceive farther in his own Epistle written unto the same book,
wherein he does not only declare my pains and travail in collecting
certain parts of Chyrurgerie, but also my great expenses and painful labors
in collecting and setting forth of the same.

These slanderous and evil words have caused me to set pen to book my
self, to avoid that foul and evil favored monster, false detraction, and
also to spare my expenses, which I before did l^se amongst unthankful and
ingrate persons. And I have taken pains now mine own self, without any
other help of living men, at this present day, but of mine own travail, and
collected them out of these famous authors, which I have before rehearsed unto
you, and although it be not in so good form and eloquent style, as it might
have been, if a better learned man had taken it in hand, yet the truth is not
to be rejected, because of the barbarousnesse of the style, or words. Thus I
leave off least I should be tedious unto you.

Now I will speak of the ^d of this noble art, or as you will say, to what
end this art does serve. The end of this art of Medicine is, to restore man's
body to health, as much as lies in this Artist to do, so that the end of this
art consists in the curation of diseases, or as we may term it restoring of
health. For man at his birth was cast into this world naked, and uncovered,
requiring the help of other things to cover his nakedness withal, never
leaving crying and weeping, till such time as reason and nature had provided
for him such necessary things as did grow upon the earth, either else upon
some other creatures, by means whereof, he was both nourished and also
clothed, and also by the virtue of other things that the Earth brought forth,
restored to health in the time of his grievous infirmities.

But how was he restored to health? Truly by Art. And by what Art, even by
the art of Medicine, which does comprehend both Physic and Chirurgerie, with
the knowledge of all simple Medicines, and compound medicaments, and all other
things whatsoever do appertain unto the same. And therefore I will say, as
that worthy man Hippocrates did. That this art is most honorable and worthy,
for that it does intend to keep man's body in health, and to remove sickness.
Therefore it is said, that the end of Chirurgia, is the restoring of man's
health.

Now let us consider whether this art be like unto other arts, or not. In some
things we say, it is like unto other arts, and in some things it is not. It
is like unto other arts, in that it does consist in a multitude of principles,
whose affectes are rightly to bring to pass or finish some thing which we
intend to do, for Aristotle in his.6. Ethic. cap. 4. does define Art to be a
certain order of doing, placed with habit and understanding, working upon
some subject, to bring to pass and finish some thing that he does intend, by
ye same art, so that what thing so ever is brought to pass or done, it must
needs be done by some one art. In this the art of medicine is like unto all
other arts, for that it consists in doing and bringing to pass, or as we
may term it, in restoring health, or curing man's body, being subject
thereunto. But other ways it does differ, and does require a further knowledge
than the common Artist does. It is requisite that this Artist which intends
to use the art of Medicine, should be very well learned in the speculatiue
part of his art, as well as in practice. It is impossible to carry in mind
so many considerations, so many observations, and so many inventions as this
art does require, and therefore it is requisite, that he be not only well
learned in the principles of his art, but also that he be studious in the
works of other excellent men, wherein he may learn their witty and ingenious
devises, to help this Artist the sooner to bring to pass his desired end. In
this it does much differ from other arts, which works only by experience,
in witty bringing of things to pass, without any further consideration,
neither do they need any such excellent learning, for that theirs does
consist chiefly upon experience and practice, and has not so much regard
unto the life and health of man. For this art does only intend to save man's
life in the time of necessity, and also to remove away such grievous
sicknesses as might anoie and disquiet both body and mind. Wherefore this
Artist is chiefly to be considered and looked unto, not only to be rewarded
for his excellent cunning in restoring man's body to health, but to be seen
unto and thoroughly examined, whether he be learned in this art or not, if he
be not learned, neither understands the principles of this art, then he is
to be forbidden this art for the worthiness thereof, for this worthy art
works upon man's body, for whom all this world was made, and all things
therein contained, and the almighty Lord had so great care for man, that he did
not only make these things for him, but also made him Lord of the^, and gave
unto him straight laws, that he should foresee, that one man should not kill
and destroy another, neither wilfully, neither yet willingly.

Then I must conclude, that whosoever does take upon him to minister in this
art, for the safeguard of man's life, and being ignorant in the principles
thereof, as I have said before, he taking upon him, and the man perishing in
his hands through his default, I say, this is murder, and this is not the
right end that art requires, neither is it sufferable in the common wealth.
And therefore it was not in vain that this worthy man Guido did say, that a
Chyrurgion ought to be learned, not only in the principles of Chyrurgerie,
but also in the principles of Physic, yea, and also in things both natural
and not natural, and things against nature, without the knowledge of which, he
should neither rightly work, neither yet bring to a good end, the desired
scope which is required of the Artist. Thus you may perceive, for this first
property which Guido speaks of, where he requires that a Surgeon should
be learned, it is even so necessary for him, as the head is for the body,
cut off the head, and see what the body can do, although the body has
hands and feet, and other necessary members, yet because it lacks
knowledge and the use of reason, which was contained in the head, and should
have been distributed to the rest of the body, to move the same, and caused it
to have done the actions of the mind, thorough default hereof nothing might
be done: Even in like manner, the Chyrurgion lacking knowledge of the
principles of this Art, can do nothing righlie nor profitablie, but he
shall always be in danger, either to kill or else to mayme some man, for
that he lacks that reasonable and methodicall knowledge which this art does
require, being the head and principle thereof. It is not unknown unto you what
manner of service the Chyrurgion does serve in, and in what places, at what
times, and how necessary it is in the common wealth: And although other men
have written very well hereof, and that I do not doubt, but that you have
very well considered the same: yet forasmuch as this most excellent service is
not to be neglected, or a light account to be made thereof: I have thought it
good, for yt it pertains to my matter, some thing to give you warning therein.
I have declared unto you in ye beginning of this proime, the nobleness of this
Art, and how it is to be honored amongst men, for that it proceeded from the
almighty Lord God, and was used and set forth by most noble and worthy
Princes, and many other worthy men of most excellent virtue and learning. And
now at this day either through negligence of the vncarefull Magistrates, or
else through our evil natures, it is used by a sort of unlearned persons, to
the great overthrow and dishonor of this worthy Art, yea, and almost to the
utter loss of the methodicall and true knowledge therein: which may be no
small danger hereafter, except speedy remedy be had herein, and that noble
persons be careful for this so necessary an Art, which kings in times past
did not only give great rewards unto those learned men which set it forth,
but also they themselves did use it, by means whereof, they got unto
themselves immortal fame, in that they did deliver their people by using of
this art, from so many grievous diseases, which daily they were brought to
death withal. Thus these gracious and merciful Princes, were not vncarefull
for their subjects, and they did not only build certain Schools, that this
Art might be taught in, but also they did devise medicines, and ministered the
same unto those that had need, in such good order, and with such knowledge,
that many thousands were restored to their health thereby, and by their
examples they encouraged many other noble persons, and also excellent learned
men, and men of excellent wit, to study and practice the same, to the great
comfort of their commonwealth, and rewarded them with great rewards. But now
alas, in this unhappy time of ours, this Art is not only neglected, and
unprovided for, but also despised, abhorred, and evil spoken of, by means
whereof noble persons, and men of great learning, does rather hate it, then
seek means or other ways, to revive it again. For I say once again, in
this our unhappy time: that Taylours, Shoemakers, Cooks, and Carpinters, are
had in more estimation, then these noble Artists be.

Yea, I think, Iuglers, Players, yea, and Jack fool with his fools coat,
shall be as well esteemed and placed in as near rooms unto the magistrates, as
these most excellent artistes shall be.

Well, I will say no more, but if that noble man Galen, were alive, who does
say in his first book de methodo medendi, that drunkards and riotous persons,
were more regarded, the^ men of knowledge and learning, and also how that
Cooks, Carpenters, Smithes, and many other occupations did run from their
Arts, and took upon them the art of medicine, I think if he were now
living, and in our Country, he would not a little meruaille, to see what a
disordred company there is now at this day, which uses this Art: uses this
Art, nay, abuses this Art, most wickedly and ungodly, to the great dishonor
of our country, and to the destruction and infamy of this worthy Art. What
shall I say, that these people be suffered, nay, rather maintained, in this
unhappy mischief. For I have known, not only noble persons to maintain
them, who have written their letters in their defense, to keep them from
punishment, when they have committed most wicked deeds, but also caused a law
to be made, that every one might occupy this Art, without any punishment, not
only Shoemakers, and Tailers, Carpinters, and Tinkers, and such other as Galen
does utterly condemn, and speak against: but also witches, and baudes,
coniurers, and a sort of false soothsayers. I will not speak of a multitude of
strangers, as pouch makers, and pedlers, with glass makers, and cobblers, which
run out of their own countries, and here become noble Physicians and
Chirurgions, such as now is most in estimation, and rules all the roast in our
Country, so that the poor English men, and such as have served in the time of
wars, with expenses of their goods, and loss of their lives, yea, and the
rest of them that be living, must of necessity serve at all times both by land
and by sea, as well in the time of wars as in the time of pestilence: These
poor men I say, are constrained to serve, to their utter undoing, and when
they come home again, they, their wives, and their children, may go pick
muscles, for this iollie company before spoken off, have taken up all their
acquaintance whilst they be serving in the wars.

Come to any of these strangers, or any of these other people, when the
Prince should be served, and one will say, I am a Tailour, another will say, I
am a Shooemaker, and the other will say, I am a woman, so that then they will
make delays, by means whereof they will not serve. And thus the Prince and
the common wealth in the time of necessity, is utterly unserved, for this
Company is content to take the living of Chirurgions, and the names too, so
long as there is no need of service for the Prince, but then they have new
names, and if they be strangers, they will then trudge home again into their
own Countries, or else hide the^ out of the way, or else retain to some noble
man, by means whereof, they will be defended from service of the Prince. And
thus with this manner of disordered shifts, the Princes with their people, are
not only evil served, and sometimes not served at all, but the noble art of
Chyrurgerie is utterly overthrown and brought to ruin, and the true
professors thereof at this day, be so few in number, that it is to be wondered
at. I have my self in the time of king Henry the eight, help to furnish out
of London in one year, which served by sea and by land, three score and twelve
Chirurgions, which were good work men, and well able to serve, and all English
men. At this present day there are not four and thirty of all the whole
company of English men, and yet the most part of them be in noble men's
service, so that if we should have need, I do not know where to find twelve
sufficient men. What do I say? sufficient men: Nay, I would there were ten
amongst all the company, worthy to be called Chirurgions, and let the rest
do such service as they may, for if there be need of service, I think their
Chirurgerie shall appear to some man's grief and pain. Thus I leave off,
and go to my matter again. My brethren, you that be English men, and profess
this noble art, remember I say, your vocation, and be not discouraged, for
that that this rablement does flourish, and that strangers are had in such
estimation, which I know is unto you no small discouraging, but I do not doubt
in time, God shall stir up the heart of the Prince, with her Graces noble
Magistrates, to consider the great peril that may grow thereof, not only in
the utter loss of so worthy an art, which of necessity must needs be lost
amongst us that be English men, except provision may be made, that these
worthy Artistes may have sufficient living to maintain them withal, but also
to foresee that this common wealth may be served with our natural, true, and
liege Country men, and not to prefer Strangers, which comes rather hither
for their own gain, than for any good love that they do bear unto us, and
in the time of greatest need does forsake us. Therefore I pray you remember,
that ye be very studious in this art, and diligent and neat in the
practicing thereof, and also to be modest, wise, and of good manners and
behavior, and that you lack none of these good properties that we have spoken
of before, least when you shall be called for in the time of necessity, to
serve Princes, and other noble persons, ye do not only dishonor your selves
and your Country, but this worthy art also. Remember I pray you what great
charge is committed unto you in the time of wars, ye have not only the
charge of men's limbs, but also of their lives, which if they should perish
through your defaulte, either in neglecting of any thing that were necessary
for their health, which you ought to be furnished withal, either else through
lack of knowledge which ye ought to have in your art: I say, if these de^ults
be in you, and the people perish in your hands, you cannot excuse your selves
of your brothers death. Therefore as you would this art should prosper, remove
from it such pernicious occasions as might be hurtful thereunto. For if we
shall be bloody murderers, or greedy and covetous catchers, and oppressers
of poor people, let us not look for the favor of God, neither yet to prosper
in our art, or if we shall be negligent in providing of such necessary things
as may be for the help of our diseased patients: either else if we shall lack
knowledge for the right use and administration of the same, we shall then be
slanderous unto this most excellent Art, and unworthy professors thereof,
and in very deed, accounted no better than these rude runagates and
butcherly Dogleechers are.

Remember also the continuance of your art, as our fore fathers have done
before our time, which has left no small number of worthy books for us to
peruse, whose diligence thereby, for the continuance of this art, does most
manifestly appear. And like as they have with most diligent study, divine
knowledge, and most willing hearts, left these their works and labors unto us
their posterity, to be as it were guides, and most sure doctrine to follow: so
I would wish that we with careful study and loving hearts, follow their
precepts, as loving children ought to follow the profitable commandments of
their careful Fathers. And al you that be young men, I request you also, that
you be diligent in seeing of other excellent men's works, and not to be too
bold and presume to deal with things above your knowledge, but in doubtful
and dangerous matters, to desire counsel of the grave and ancient men, who
has more knowledge by long experience, and able to give better judgment than
you are, by means whereof the Patient shall not only be the better provided
for, but you also discharged of great blame, which might happen, if any thing
came to the sick patient: But well, let your honest manners be equal unto
your excellent knowledge and practice in this worthy art, see that ye be
faithful, trusty, and true, unto your sick patients honest of behavior,
sober of life, and comfortable of words. And also see that ye serve God, and
love him, and pray unto him at all times, that the holy Ghost may assist and
strengthen you in all your works and enterprises which you do take in hand,
so that they may all turn to the commodity of the sick patient, and to the
glory of God, promising no health unto them, but thy faithful and painful
diligence, for health lies not in thy hands to give, but in the might and
power of the almighty Lord God, unto whom be all honor, praise, and glory,
world without end, Amen.

Thus most loving Reader, I beseech thee to spare me thy good word, for my
painful travail which I have taken herein, for the common weath sake, and for
the furtherance of those that be young men of my Company, and think not that
I have done it to teach any learned man, but rather to encourage those that be
better learned, to bestow their diligence and travail, either for the
amendment of this, or else for the setting forth of some better work. Thus
taking my leave, I beseech the eternal God to prosper this most worthy art,
and all the true and right professors of the same.

FINIS.
Thomas Gale unto the friendly Reader, Salutations.
MY friendly and well-beloved brethren, when I did consider with my self the
great defect and imbecilitie which does remain amongst our Company, for lack
of learning in the speculatiue part, of this worthy art of Chirurgerie, which
chiefly does appertain unto the same. And considering with my self what
great ignorance and infamy has grown to our Company thereby, I have not
been a little careful to remove the same things from us. And considering with
my self also, that these things cannot be removed but by knowledge, and that
knowledge cannot come, but by reading and hearing, and reading is unprofitable,
except it be understood. Therefore I have with great diligence collected and
gathered together these four books of Galen, called Therapeuticon, and being
translated into the English tongue, I have dedicated the same unto you, to that
end, that you may with the like diligence and study, receive pleasure, profit,
and great commodity, by these books which I here deliver unto you with
painful travail, great cares, and charges: But when I did consider these
divine and most excellent books, how profitable and commodious the same should
be unto you, I say, not only to you, but to the whole common wealth of our
Country, and what great honor should grow unto mine own natural Country men
hereby, and also what furtherance and increase of knowledge it shall be unto
those that profess this art. I neither regarded money nor profit, nor passed
for any pains, but yielded my careful study to serve your turn, in this
most divine work. And moreover, I thought it my bounden duty, to help to
raise up that most famous man Galen, who has lien so long buried with that
foul monster Oblivion, from the knowledge of our natural tongue, so that
worthelie he has deserved immortal fame. Now my brethren, there are three
special points that are to be considered. The first is, to whom you do
minister, and to what end your ministration serves. The second is, with what
things you do minister, and what method you ought to keep in the time of
your ministration. The third is, what manner of knowledge ye ought to have that
will cure methodicallie and rightly, by his ministration. To whom this Artist
does minister, it is easily known, for he does minister to man's body, which
is subject unto the art of Medicine, and the end and affect of his
ministration, is to cure man's body of such hurts and diseases, as the same
body is anoyed and troubled with. The second does consist in those things that
you cure withal, and they be three, that is to say, convenient diet, or as
we may term it, convenient government of the sick patient, and convenient
medicaments, apt and meet for the disease, and also an apt and convenient
person methodicallie and rightly to use these two. The third is, what manner
of knowledge this person ought to have. Galen does very well describe his
knowledge in these books, against that foolish bragging Thesalus, how he would
take upon him in six months, to make a man perfect in this art, and yet he
himself but a Woolman, or as we may term him, a Spinner and carder of wool,
whose foolish stupiditie was such, that he would compare with Hyppocrates and
Galen, and therefore Galen has written against him in all these books, not
only condemning him, but condemning all other ignorant persons, which
understand not the principles of this art, and specially other Artists, as
Carpenters, Smiths, Cooks, Weauers, and women, which does leave their own
honest occupations, wherein they have been brought up, and does arrogantlie
and presumptuouslie take upon them this most worthy art, wherein they be
utterly ignorant, and if they cure any thing, it is by chance, and not by
method, as you may perceive in his first book.

There is also another thing to be noted, that Galen does not make such
divisions betwixt wounds and ulcers, as we commonly do, for he does name
all those that comes with solution, or separation of the skin. Elkos in
Greek, that is to say, an ulcer.

But if you do diligently consider Galens method, as in the curation you
shall find it most excellent, and which is to be understood an ulcer, and
which a wound, etc.

Now there rests no more but your painful travail and study herein, and
every one of you brotherly and friendly, to have conference herein one with
another, by means whereof the true meaning shall be the better understood, and
you your selves shall receive it the better into your perpetual memory.

Thus I take my leave of you, requiring of you no rewards, but true and
faithful good will, and loving words, with friendly furtherance, desiring the
almighty Lord to preserve and keep you, and send you the knowledge in this
worthy Art, to the profit of the common wealth.

FINIS.
THE THIRD BOOK of Galen, called in Greek (...), in Latin, Methodus Medendi.
The effect of the same.
1 First, he shows the curation of Ulcers that be not malignant and
stubburne. 2 Secondly, he shows what manner of Medicines the Emperikes have
found out to engender flesh. 3 Thirdly, he shows the curation of a hollow
ulcer. 4 Fourthlie, he shows that the Indications ought to be taken of the
temperament of the affected part. 5 Fiftlie, he shows that the curation of
the similer parts consists in the just temperame^t of the four qualities. 6
Sixtlie, he shows that all bodies require not like medicines, but that weak
and tender bodies require most gentle medicines, and that dry and strong
bodies require most strongest medicines.
The first Chapter.
IF therefore Hiero, the indication which first springs of ye nature of ye
thing, does find out what is to be done, then ye beginning of finding out
remedies, must of necessity be taken of the nature of diseases themselves. For
truly it is against all reason, that one thing should show the way of curing,
and another that is cured, for each thing can better show of himself, than of
another, but this shall be made more evident hereafter. And for because all
men do grant the first indications to be taken of ye affects, we shall not
need further travail herein, to prove that hereof we must take our
beginning: nay, rather let us go about to show that it is neither the whole,
neither any great portion, as the Methodicians do judge, but rather the least
part, and only the beginning. Therefore they themselves do affirm, that the
stone in the bladder, (because that it is altogether against nature) does show
that it must be taken away. In like sort Acrochordonas, Mirmicias, Atheromata,
Steatomata, Meliceridas, and other of like kind. Also the intestine that is now
fallen into the purse of the testicles, and all that are dislocated, because
they are in a place against nature, they show that they must be reposed and
put in their natural seat. And all these truly are so far from any
cunning, that they are manifest even to every private person, for they will
bid that the member which they perceive dislocated, to be put into the joint
again. Also Achrocordonas or Warts to be taken away, an Ulcer to be brought
to a Cicatrize, and a fluxible belly to be stopped, but by what means those
things may be done, truly they do not know. And this is it which ought to
be known of the Physician: wherefore the indication which is taken of
diseases, is only the beginning, (and as I may term it) the place from
whence the way of curing proceeds, being yet no portion of the art of
Physic, or no great or proper part, but such a one as is common to every
vulgar person: therefore he is worthily called a curer of diseases, that can
of himself find out those things, by which may be performed that which is of
the first indication showed, which if he do it by experience, then he is to be
named, an obseruer, and an Emperike. But if he do it by a certain reason and
method, then he is to be called a Logitian, Methoditian, and Dogmatist. Now
there comes to the Physician a vulgar person, (I must repeat this thing
again) willing him to put the member into the joint, or perhaps to unite and
form a broken bone, or to have Meliceris taken away. But by what ways, any
of these things are to be brought to pass, that to find out, is certainly the
office of the art of Physic. And the Emperikes do boldly contend, that all
things are to be found out by experience, but we truly do affirm, that they
are found out partly by experience, and partly by reason, seeing that neither
experience only, neither yet reason, can find out all things.
Notwithstanding we think it not good to set out a confused and mixed doctrine,
but Experience by it self and Reason by it self, that thereby it may easily
appear of what force each of them is.

And now truly we have determined to speak of that invention which springs
of Reason: now therefore have we any method following, how we may find out
every of the forenamed remedies? I mean to take away that which is
altogether against Nature, and that is dislocated, to put in his proper place,
and to unite the solution of continuitie, shall we require experience heereto?
I truly am fully persuaded, that there is a method, by which thou may find
out things required, whose original is that, which every disease does show
to be done. For the solution of unity, requires unition: and the fracture of
the bone, called in Greek, Catagma, in the fleshie parts, an ulcer: like as
also a wound and ruption, called Regma, and conuulsion, named Spasma: for a
wound truly is a certain solution, left in the fleshie part of wounding. A
ruption and conuulsion, be solutions made without wounding.

The first is division of the fleshie parts, the other is of the neruous
parts, and all these show that there must be made union, but whether in all it
may be performed, or yt it cannot in many, that only behooves the Artist to
consider, for no common person does know how that the Diaphragma, or the small
intestines, can attain the scope, of which they give indication: also he is
ignorant that the foreskin called Periputium, and the thin part of the cheeks,
be of like condition. Furthermore, whether Caries in the bone (the Greeks call
it Teridon) may be cured, like as erosion in the flesh, he understood not.
Again, whether a fracture will grow together like as a wound, or does further
require to be adconglutinated with Callus, he perceives not whether there is
to be hoped the growing of Callus in fractures of the head, or else is
otherwise to be cured. Further, he is more ignorant whether there is any hope
of recovery in wounds of the heart, lungs, stomach, and liver. And to
conclude, no common person knows any thing beyond the first indication.
Therefore the first work of this art is, to consider whether we may perform
that we take in hand, or not, and this is known two ways, neither can the
third be added or known. The first is, by experience, which requires long use
and practice: the other is, by the nature of the thing it self, for this does
set out both the substance of every part, and also his action, use, and
situation, with which things proceeding, he shall not only foresee what
cannot be cured, but also deliberate of inuenting remedies for that which may
be cured.

The second Chapter.
THerefore it is manifest that we must begin of simple things, and truly
there is nothing more simple than the wound in the upper part of the flesh:
therefore the cure of this wound, in that it is only a wound, is unition, but
if it be with hollownesse and putrefaction, there is a double scope, in as much
as the effect is double, that is to say, an ulcer, which is, solution of
unity, and hollownesse which springs of the lost substance of the part, in
which kind it cannot often chance, that thou shall fulfill both the scopes
aforesaid, as if not only the flesh, but also the bone under it is perished,
for such hollownesse cannot exactlie be filled, but you may bring it to a
cicatrise, but this is the cure of the ulcer, and the hollownesse remains
notwithstanding incurable: Therefore this thing it behooves to know, either by
experience, or else by reasons help. But Thessalus uses not these, neither
puts he to a third, and yet is not he ashamed to trifle, but let ye pass,
and rather let ye Physician who follows Thessalus, teach us how to cure a
hollow ulcer in the fleshie part, nothing being hurt under ye ulcer, he
answers, by applying medicines which do engender flesh, they call them
Sarcoticall. Well said, a great facility, peradventure you may better term
it, stupiditie, when he thinks sufficiently to have answered the question,
by naming a sarcoticall medicine: for if we know this Sarcoticall, what do we
further require, show us I pray thee what Sarcoticall is, that thou will use:
I suppose that thou will answer, Olibanum, or Iris, or Aristolochia, or
Eruifarina or Panax, for I will first make mention of dry medicines: now go
to. By what means have thou found these medicines? thou answerest by
Experience, what is it then that thou have added heereto? for every person
does know, that that which is holow, must be filled, but experience has taught
of what things, and by what medicines that should be done: truly Thessalus
knows not that medicine, neither as an emperike, neither as a logitian: as an
emperike because he will not: as a Logitian, because he cannot: for I truly
do understand, that he knows this medicine as an Emperike, for seeing there
are two instruments of every invention, that is to say, Experience and
Reason, he which does know that is invented, and yet can give no reason
thereof, does show himself to have found it by experience, therefore yt he may
understand how greatly he has erred, let him a little give audience unto us,
for I will have to do in few words, with the professor of only
Experience, for it is meet that he also do utter by what means he has found
out this drying medicine that does incarnate, which he names Cephalicin, and
that is compound of Iris, and Aristolochia, and Eruus, and Olibanum, and Manna,
that is to say, the dross of Olibanum. There is also another medicine, which
besides these that are rehearsed, has the rind of Panax, and another medicine
to, which is mixed with washed Cadmia.

Now let him tell me how these medicines be found, but what skilleth it (says
he) to ask of yt finding of the^ out, is it not better to use those things
that are found out right? And this at the first they answer, afterward they
say, that these medicines be found out by dreams, in the mean time by
chance one medicine was put to another, afterward one was bold to use them
mixed, but yet they show not the success of their boldness. Therefore these
be manifest trifles. The third way of invention, truly is reason, or some
proving every one of those simple medicines separatlie, to be Sarcoticall,
afterward beholding yt sometime it does not make flesh, he finds out by
reason, that every one of those agrees not to every nature, for unto whom
Aristolochia does not fill the ulcer with flesh, there Olibanum has, and where
Olibanum has not profited, there Iris has done good, for I suppose that to be
reasonable, that all men are not affected to all things alike. And when this
came first into reasoning, it was thought good that many medicines of one kind
should be mixed together, that there might not want a meet medicine for every
nature. And friend, the action of every substance does not remain in mixed
kinds, so that in every kind of body, there might be present that should
help the disease, for if they could find out the nature of the body, or the
force of the Medicine applied, peradventure there should not need such
variety in them, in as much as they should alwaie readily find that one
medicine that should agree to one body.

Now for as much as they are ignorant in both, they do crookedlie mix all
together, studying to make one medicine that might agree to all natures, and I
suppose this reason of compounding medicines to be found out of the first
Physicians, and you receive it as an ancient invention, notwithstanding I
suppose that it is not so far from the true medicinal method, as it is
reasonable to be emptied into another, for if they do not first think of that
method, whose composition stands in medicines like of kind, and not of that
which is of contrary, by and by you shall find in the mixture of these
medicines, some one that may be profitable to the sick, and peradventure not
one: contrariwise, seven or eight which shall not need, so that the medicines
shall more hurt that profit.

These things I say, if he does not remember, I will account him more
ignorant than to know the thing it self, for oil being put into a hollow
wound, is most contrary of all other medicines, for if thou will that way
cure, thou shall by use find the ulcer to be filthy and stinking, but if the
time also of the year be hotter, or ye man has Cachochimia, or by nature is
apt unto rumes, or offend in his diet, it is to be feared least yt part do
putrify, in which the ulcer is made. In like sort, if thou do use wax
either alone, either dissolved in oil, for they truly do make the ulcer
putrify: but if thou do put in Aerugo beaten fine, they shall by no means
putrify, yet it brings great pain and corrosion.

Furthermore, it does eat and provoke inflammation, and if thou use it more
largely, it will also make conuulsion, therefore seeing that neither oil, nor
Aerugo, nor wax, can fill an hollow ulcer with flesh, it is manifest that none
of those which professes only Experience, will mix them together, yet I
truly will mix them, yea, in due weight, not only these, but a thousand
other medicines, which be not hurtful to a hollow ulcer, for if they hurt not
with the same faculties, but as it were with their contraries, truly they are
unlike and immoderate to fill an hollow ulcer: notwithstanding like as of too
immoderate temperatures, there shall be one made temperate, that we have set
out in the way of compounding medicines: therefore it is not hard to make a
medicine of oil, wax, and Aerugo, that shall make flesh, for if thou do
know that the same ulcer is moderatlie to be dried, and do not understand
the wax or oil does not dry, neither that any of them, or both mixed
together, can fill a hollow ulcer, nor that Aerugo alone can moderatlie dry:
therefore if thou do mix all these together, thou may make a medicine
which shall moderatlie dry, what the quantity or proportion of every one of
them should be, that I have now set out in my books, which be entitled, the
composition of medicines, and now also if it be needful, it shall be declared
in talk hereafter.

But first we must drive from these our books following, this Thessalus, but
first declaring unto him, how much he has erred from a truth, for unto any
that is wise, that which is now spoken, does sufficiently show what the
method of curing ought to be, but with these we need not talk. Therefore it is
necessary that we dispute yet with those, taking here our beginning.

Every hollownesse that is against nature, does require to be filled,
wherefore also that which comes in the fleshy part, and that filling in the
end, of finding out remedies, which we desire. And that thou may find those
remedies, which do fill, thou have need of much reason and manifold
indication, and exact, reasonable, and particular method, for thou have often
seen ulcers hard to cure, not to be cured, neither of those which profess
experience, I mean those which abound in remedies, neither of those, which
claiming reason to themselves, for these Thessalians, who^ they name,
Methodicians, being indeed most far from a method, as the Ass to the Harp,
be unmeet to hear this speculation, much less cure, they find out by reason,
that which is right. Thou have seen many times in the like ulcers, the
Emperikes to go from one medicine to another, when truly no reason did show
them the way, because they have tried many things which may fill a hollow
ulcer, the same as they call it, Idiosyncrasian, that is, properties of bodies,
in which every of them are seen to have force, neither can they discern,
neither yet remember. Therefore now also, not knowing whether to go, but
trusting in the proof of many perticulars, whatsoever they find by the way
yt may profit, they go from one to another, following Fortune rather than
Reason, which may help in the invention of remedies, like unto these, although
they will not be these Dogmatists, which are not able by reason to understand
the natural principles of bodies, but of these Thessalions void of method,
what do thou yet speak? Therefore those which cure by right method, do
find apt remedies for every kind of ulcers, as also convenient diet, they do
most apparantlie declare by the things it self, how much it profits, and how
great light it does bring to the art of curing, the Treatise of nature it
self declares: for I have not once declared unto you, how that sometime they
which go from one medicine to another, do let slip and neglect that which is
profitable, and that with some one of their remedies, which they have used, the
same ulcers have been cured, therefore they have worthily despised the
faculty of such remedies, which because of the untimely use, they have seen,
not only the profit, but much for to hurt, and that in the first use it has
done no evident thing. Furthermore, thou have seen no less the grievous pains
of the eyes to be healed, either with bath, either with drinking of wine,
either with foments, either with letting of blood, either with purging, unto
which these common sort of Physicians have applied no other thing, than these
medicines which are made of Opium, and Mandrake, and Henbane, bringing great
danger unto the eyes, inasmuch as they taking no other thing away for ye
present but the pains it self: these do kill the sense, as thou have known
many, by the use of these medicines, when they have been too much applied,
never after to have come to their natural state, and that first their eyes
were dim, and they have hardly seen, after to be vexed with suffusion (which
is called Hipochysis) or with too great dilatation of the ball of the Eye,
named Mydriasis, or with Tabes or Corrugation, called Rhetiosm.

Thou have known also, being with me from sixteen years of age, never to
have seen under any master this work, but to have excogitated it by reason,
and how long time I did consider that Aphorism, of vnalayde wine, or bath, or
foment, or letting blood, or purging, takes away the pains of the eyes. And
what trust I had by the rest of Hippocrates laborers, that there was nothing in
this Aphorism, either false or might not be brought to pass, and that was it
which stirred me to search, until (going Hippocrates way) I found by what
means I should discern, when and how, every of the forenamed should be used.
By which reason I made manifest to many, which have seen the like things, of
how great force the medicinal method is, and how great occasion of evil they
are, which have not observed the old art of Physic, have builded new
sects, and now truly, although from the beginning I have refused it, yet by
entreating, you have compelled me to take all this whole work in hand, which I
pray the gods may be profitable, by others truly I have small hope, as well for
the contempt of good letters, which now do reign, as also for the admiration
of riches, estimation and civil power, unto which whosoever do turn
himself, is not able to find the truth in any thing: But these things shall
be determined as pleases the gods, and we now for our power, shall restore the
Method of curing, which was found of the ancient Physicians, being now
neglected: repeting again the disputation which we have begun of the hollow
ulcer, and of the first invention of those things, which does fill an ulcer
with flesh, let that suffice, which hitherto we have said, and let us grant
if they will, unto the Empericks all that they say. And for the use of things
found out, I have often showed to thee in themselves, and now nothing less, I
will go about to demonstrate by reason, how these Empericks, cannot by certain
reason, go unto another medicine, when they have nothing profited with the
first, and that rightly chances: for when as they know not the cause, of the
unhappy success of the first medicine, neither can declare the like in the
second, and when they are ignorant of the cause, wherefore the first medicine
does not his affect, neither are able to understand, why it takes no place,
this thing truly being not known, they cannot reasonably go to another, when
as they cannot in the same medicine perceive the like cause.

The third Chapter.
NOw therefore let us set out Hyppocrates way, and the true method of curing an
hollow ulcer, surely it behooves to begin thus, that is, of the substance of
the thing, therefore seeing that an hollow ulcer that is our scope, that ye
flesh which is lost may be restored, it is needful to know that the thing
which engendereth flesh, is good blood, nature as I may term it, being the
workman and author, notwithstanding it is not sufficient to name simply
Nature, unless we consider also whose nature, and where. For it is manifest,
that Nature it self is the ingenderer of flesh, of those bodies that be
subject, whereas flesh is to be made, and surely it is declared, that the
nature of every body does consist of the temperament of hot, cold, moist,
and dry: therefore it is manifest, that the just temperament of these, in
those parts whereas we shall restore the lost flesh, is as it were the workman.
And first of all, in every hollow ulcer, these two things are to be
considered, whether the body being subject, be in just temperature, that is to
say, whether it be according to nature. For we have declared, that health of
similer bodies, is the just temperature of the four qualities, and whether the
blood that flows to ye part be good, or else but indifferent, for if either
of these do offend, there are truly many affects against nature,
notwithstanding there is now put to us but only the hollownesse in the fleshie
parts. Therefore let us imagine the part to be sound, and the blood which
flows to the part, to be free from fault, either in quality or quantity,
surely these things being, as is said, there is no impediment, but that
flesh shall prosperously grow, and that without the help of any outward
medicine, for both causes which engender flesh, being present, and nothing
outwardly hindering, then it cannot be, but that flesh must be ingendered.

But in the first engendering of flesh, there must of force spring a double
excrement, as we have showed in our commentaries of Nature, that there
follows every mutation of the quality of the nourishment, an excrement
gross and thick, and another thin. And these excrementes chauncing ever
through the whole body, that which is thinner, is invisible, by persperation,
notwithstanding it is forthwith visible, as often as the natural heat
diminishes, or that he uses more large diet than is meet, or that there
happens to the creature more vehement motion. The other excrement is the
filth, that is sent to the skin. Furthermore, in ulcers, the thinner excrement
is called Sanies, in Greek Icor, the groser is named Sordes, and the ulcer is
made moist by the thinner excrement, in like sort as by the groser it is made
filthy, and for that cause it needs two kind of medicines, that is to say,
exicatiues, to expel or dry yt which is moist, and mundificatiues, to purge
the filth.

Now then, seeing that nature cease no time, truly there can be no time
found, in which both these excrements may not be gathered together in an hollow
ulcer: Wherefore there shall be no time in which thou shall not use both kinds
of medicines, that is to say, which shall exicate and mundifie.

And now we have found out of what kind the medicine ought to be, but that is
not sufficient, for it is needful to invent some particular, which is to be
applied to the ulcer. Now by what method, and how shall they be found out?
forsooth by the same which is set out in our books, of the faculties of simple
medicamentes, for we have showed in them certain medicines desiccatiue,
certain humectiue, certain refrigeratiue, and certain to make hot, yea, and
certain by conjunction, to make hot and dry, or to refrigerate and moist, or
to heat and moist, or to refrigerate and dry, and that there is in every of
them a difference, more or less, but in multitude infinite.

Notwithstanding they be contained within limits to their use, which do
easily comprehend them in the first order or degree, or second, or third, or
fourth, now of what degree, shall that medicine be, which is meet to enge^der
flesh, which must both moderately dry, and also mundifie? truly of ye first
degree, for that medicine, which surmounteth this degree, does not only
consume the abou^daunce of the humor flowing to the part, but does also devour
the blood flowing, letting the part to be restored co^suming the flesh, or the
matter whereof the flesh grows: surely it is declared that such be Olibanum,
and the meal of barley, beans and Eruum, and Iris, and Aristolochia, and
Cadmia, and Panax, and Pomphilix, and we have showed yt all these, differ among
themselves, more or less, and that some of them abound only in simple
qualities and other some in compound. For Aristolochia, and Panax, do dry
more than the rest, and also by nature are more hot, barley and bean flower,
does much less dry than these, and have no heat at all.

Olibanum, does moderately heat, but does less dry tha^ these, in so much as
in certain bodies, it dries not at all. The meal of Eruum, and Iris, and
Aristolochia, and Panax, are in a mean. But now let us repeat again, that
we have profitably touched.

Olibanum, in bodies of moist nature, is able to engender flesh, but in dry
natures he cannot, for it is needful to consider, that there is a two fold
difference of the first indicatio^s, that which is according to nature, showing
the co^seruation of it self, and further does also require things like to it
self, and that which is against nature, declaring the taking away of it self,
and also requiring things contrary: for every thing perishes or is overcome of
his contrary, and in his contrary. And truly the Ulcer, how much it is to
moist, does so much the more require medicines, which does dry. But the nature
of ye body how much it is more moist, so much the less it requires a
medicine which does excicate, wherefore if there be any ulcers in which there
is like humiditie, because they are in a body of dryer te^perament, truly it
is requisite the more to be excicate: that which is in a moister temperature,
does so much less need dry medicines, as there is difference between
nature and nature. For it behooves the flesh that is engendered, to be like that
which was there before. Therefore whereas the flesh is dryer than in times
past, it is convenient that the new be made dryer, so that it ought to be the
more largely to be dried, and how much the more it shall be dry, so much the
more shall the medicine which shall be applied, have a dissicatiue virtue: but in
a moist nature, there is so much less need of a medicine dissicatiue, how
much the flesh is less dry. Therefore like as Olibanum, has such temperament
concerning the nature of man's body, yt is agreeable to a temperate and mean
nature, but it does somewhat more largely dry. These that be moyster in like
sort, as it is to moist for them that be most dry, so that of right Olibanum
makes mattier, both in certain Ulcers and also natures, and does not engender
flesh, and in certain it does engender flesh. Therefore if thou do mark,
thou shall find ye success aunswerable unto reason, for in a moister nature
it may enge^der flesh, in a dryer it cannot. Do thou not therefore perceive
of how many Theoremes, or intencions of curing, he has need, yt will cure an
ulcer by a right Method? for after yt it is found out, that ye fault is in
moisture, altogether it shows forthwith, yt there must be prepared a
dissicatiue medicine: but for yt there are of drying medicines, some yt dries
more, and some less, that which is expedient must be taken, partly of the
diversity of the ulcers, and partly of the nature of the sick. Therefore he
yt will rightly cure an ulcer, must not only consider the nature of the body,
but also to have learned, all the speculation of medicines diligently, and also
to know the signs of bodies, which are of dry or moist temperament.

Now therefore consider what great rashness is of pronouncing these
Methodicians, which think that they have done sufficiently to the curing of an
hollow Ulcer, if they understand that it must be filled with flesh. Truly the
way of curing consists not in this, but in finding that out which shall fill
it with flesh, but that shall fill with flesh (quod he) is already found by
experience: then confess that which shall cure, to be found out by
experience, neither do they vainly boast, neither extol the Method,
although experience is condemned, yea, of the Empericks themselves, which is
without certain limitation: for they write in their commentaries of medicines,
in this manner. An Emplaister for those that have soft bodies, and for children
and women, and they know how that Olibanum in such natures can engender flesh,
and fill hollow Ulcers, so that there be no other accidence: notwithstanding
where such bodies are moist, and because of their moystnesse require moderate
drying Medicines, or that there is some other cause of the success, they
cannot tell. Again they shall find an other medicine written for old folks,
and another against those Ulcers which will hardly be brought to a cicatrice,
and has the sides swollen, called in Greek Oxthothe, and they write in all
their commentaries curatiue, many other seperatiues, for which as near as we
can invent a convenient medicine, to the property of curing nature, for
seperations in every Art, go about to divide that which is proper, from that
which is common, and how much any does divide or part more things, so much he
comes nearer unto the property, but the proper thing it self, cannot
exactly be either written or spoken: and for this cause those Emperickes which
were most diligent in their Art, as also well near all the dogmatistes, do
acknowledge that there cannot be left in writing any exact curing, but that
which wants concerning the conjecture of the nature of the pacient.

Some of them affirm, that it is to be added or considered of the proper use
of every Physician, other some by reasoning artificially, but yet none of them
was so rash to profess, that he had one medicine which might engender flesh,
in every hollow ulcer, for truly thou shall not find in authors such a
Medicine that will cure every hollow Ulcer, but that the medicine is to be
changed, according to the humor and temperament of the pacients member.

Therefore we leaving here the impudency of the Methodicians, go to, let
us hear what the Emperickes say, who do judge that sometime is to be added
or considered in the finding out proper remedies for the pacient, by the proper
use and exercitation of every one, for as we have after said, there is not in
physic any thing, or any remedy, which is not in fine difficil, but in every
thing his quality cannot be hidden, for either it may be spoken, written, or
perceived. For in an ulcer, moisture and filthiness, may be showed, but the
quantity in neither may be showed, although we studying to go nearer unto ye
thing it self, naming it, we say small, and plentiful filthiness, or thin
and gross, or very much or little, and indifferent, and competent, or else
calling it otherwise in like sort, whereby we may come nearer, to show the
quantity.

Now therefore I will have thee diligent to attend, that thou may know how
much it is better, to do every thing by a method, rather than by experience
only, be it so known that this or that medicine, has virtue to fill an hollow
ulcer, in those whom we name of moyster complexion, as an obseruer or
empericke, in those which have soft flesh, and to women and children, and that
he has not now, any thing profited with such medicine. Therefore we will
seek out the cause, why it did not profit, and will reduce this, unto one of
these two, for either the medicine has dried to little, or else to much, the
signs of which, be Sordes, and Sanies, for if there be more Sordes, in the
ulcer, and that all the ulcer is moister, ye medicine has dried to little, but
if it be clean and without moisture, it has dried to much. Therefore
forthwith we may know the measure also of the excess and effect, by the
manner of the signs, and we shall afterward make our medicine, which shall be
applied, so much ye more or less drying, but the Empericks truly if any
medicine applied does not make flesh to grow, he verily beholds, but yet
being ignorant, whether that springs because his medicine dries to little or
much, he cannot go unto another medicine. In like sort truly, both
Erasistratus, and Herophilus, being as I have showed half dogmatistes, shall
ill cure an ulcer, for they attempt to cure only those affects by reason,
which are proper to the organicke members, but an ulcer as we said, is common
both to similer and also isntrumental parts, therefore so far forth as it is
in the similer parts, so far forth they will cure it Emperiquelie.

Also, if they prove to cure those ulcers, whose substance is utterly
perished, or else is imperfect and diminished, in these also it follows
necessarily, that they may manifoldlie err from curing reasonably: for if
that is lost by any similer substance, it is necessary that he who will
look to the restoring of this again, be skillful of universal nature. But of
these we shall hereafter speak, in the mean season I suppose it to be most
evidently set out, that every one cannot rightly cure an ulcer, and that the
first indication, of all which is manifest to every private person, is the
least part of curing. For it is necessary that by demonstration he has
learned, how that heat and cold, moisture and dryness, be qualities active
and passive. And further to know all those things which we have written in our
books De Temperaments, or else where, in other volumes belonging heereto.

And hitherto our talk has been of the hollow Ulcer, we only curing the
hollownesse it self, for it is not yet set out what is the proper curation of
an ulcer, but that shall also be performed after the same method, because it
is taken both of the temperament of the affected part, and also of the
faculty of medicines, and surely both these do depend of the Treatise of
Elements, for if that be granted, that in a method the four qualities are
causes of generation and corruption, it shall not be lawful either to have
begun, either to proceed, or to finish a method: for truly it belongs to
the Treatise of Elements, that thou may show the qualities, to do and
suffer naturally. Therefore that we heretofore have showed, is now confirmed
in this present talk, that no Physician can consider of any similer parts,
without natural knowledge or speculation, (but there is only set out of
similer parts.)

Here now our talk does somewhat insinuate, that neither in the isntrumental
parts any can find out the perfect cure, which have not attained the
speculation or true knowledge. But this shall be more evidently set out in
the work.

The fourth Chapter.
But now it is time to go to the very cure of an ulcer, which is alone or
simple, the ulcer truly shall be alone, if there be neither affect or accident
present, but if the part vlcerate be not molested with flux, nor visited with
ill juice, neither out of his natural temperature, neither is there any
hollownesse, or yet loss of skin, for this thing a good sort of Physicians do
let slip, not understanding how there remain two affects in the part, after
the hollow ulcer is filled with flesh and made plain, the one being the loss
of the substance of the skin, the other, of the solution of continuitie.
Therefore as often as this one thing comes, that is, solution of continuitie,
whether that be of the over skin, the Greeks call it Epithermia, or whether it
be of ye skin called Thermia, or it be the affect of the flesh under it, which
is called an ulcer, it does only require to be adglutinated, for if the sides
of the skin be perfectly joined together, there shall be nothing in the midst
of a contrary kind, like as in ye ulcer which is now filled, and is made
plain, for in this the sides of the ulcer touch not, but the skin of all the
exulcerate part is porished, which ought forsooth to be restored. But in that
wound whereas there is division made with any edged tool, there is only
adglutination required, and not also the generation of skin. Therefore as often
as we purpose to find out the cure of a simple ulcer, we in this talk
presuppose that the fleshie part is divided, without loss of any portion of
the same, for it wants a broad skin, which we have called in Greek
Epithermia, which must be made by inducing a ciccatrize. Therefore it is
necessary both to regenerate this, and also to unite it together, and so there
be two things unto which thou must look as in an hollow ulcer, because there
is a double affect in both. But peradventure some of them will say, how is a
plain ulcer known from an hollow? if there be both a double affect in either,
and also a double scope of curing appointed, that is to say, the multitude of
the lost parts, where in an hollow ulcer, not only the over skin is perished,
but also the skin it self, yea, and sometime no small portion of the flesh. In
an ulcer filled, there wants not flesh, but yet outwardly there lacks his
covering, but we will show hereafter what the cure is of those kinds of
ulcers, now let us understand what is ye due cure of an ulcer, in that it is
only an ulcer, and has no other affect joined with it, therefore for that
here is only division put forth, it behooves to join the sides that are
divided, and not only to join them, but to make them also to endure surely,
they which are joined shall remain together two ways, when as some of
themselves does so remain, other by ye help of other things, of themselves
they only remain, which does grow together and close by the help of other,
those which are gathered together, and so holden with any glutenous thing, but
those yt grow together must of force be naturally soft. Truly such is both
the flesh it self, and also whatsoever comes of flesh, but whatsoever are
hard and dry, their parts cannot grow together, but does require some glue or
band, whereby the sides joined may so remain. But the cure of such bodies shall
be set out hereafter. Here let us proceed with our talk begun, of those
which may be united, scarching out also the cause of joining and closing, for
like as in hollow ulcers there must be flesh engendered, so in a simple ulcer
that the sides may close. And nature truly is the cause, that if thou do
exactly put together the sides which are separated, they will close together
without any outward labor, and now there springs another scope for thee, to
consider the bringing of the sides together, beginning with which thou shall
find out, with what thou shall bring this to pass, for thou shall close them
together which are separated, either with a roller, with two ends put about, or
with stitching, or hooks, which the Greeks call Agkleras, or with some of
these, or else all, it is necessary that the roller which is put about be not
too soft, or will be broken like Alga, (the Greek writers do call it
Vrouothes, that it may safely hold, neither yet so hard, that in compressing
it may offend, then let not thy rolling or binding be so loose, that it cannot
do good, neither yet so straight, that by compressing it may cause dolor.
These things if thou shall observe, without doubt the ulcer will close, if
that it be free from all juice or flux, or intemperatnesse, or inflammation,
or any other fault. But if for the greatness it cannot be that the parts
divided may from the bottom be exactlie joined, neither being able with
stitching, neither with splents, neither with rolling to come unto them, or
that there is Sanies now gathered there, or some dolor annexed, such an ulcer
cannot close together by the only joining of the sides, when as that that is
pained, causes somewhat to flow more, yea, and although that which flows
be according to nature, yet the strength of the part which are meekned, both
for the dolor and pain, and also thorough the wound, cannot bear that which
is just, but are burdened, as though it were the contrary, and hereof
springs superfluous Sanies, yea, and it is marvel if there follows not
inflammation also, if there be Sanies collected in the midst of the sides of
the ulcer, without pain, or that there be any mean place betwixt, which is
void of Sanies, but yet is filled with the air, the Ulcer cannot be
adglutinated by closing together the parts divided, when as the Sanies do
devour the union, and the void places which are betwixt the parts to be
joined, do let the frontes of the inward sides to touch. Therefore at the
least that those parts of the ulcer may close, they require Natures help to
be filled with flesh, and surely these are so little, if the sides of the
ulcer be rightly joined, that it may be done in one day, or in two at the
most. Therefore for this time it behooves to use some desiccatiue medicine,
which may dry the part, that it may consume the Sanies, if any there be, or
if any shall flow into the void places, to keep it back. Now therefore thou
shall cause me to call to remembrance ye medicine which does incarnate and
moderatlie dry, yt we may know whether ye glutinatiue medicine ought to be
drier or (...): truly ye incarnatiue medicine if it should consume al ye blood
which flows, it should by that means take away the matter it self whereof
flesh springs. But truly a glutinatine medicine either needs not at all
the generation of flesh, or else very little. Wherefore it behooves it to be
more desiccatiue than that which must incarnate, so that by this reason, there
is but a small difference betwixt these medicines, but yet by another reason
there is great difference, in as much as that which does incarnat, ought
eft-soones also to have a virtue abstersive, whereby it may not only dry ye
abundance of moisture, but also may take away all the filth: Aglutinatiue
truly neither may mundifie, neither purge, but to bring all the whole
substance together. And medicines which be called Abstersive and astringent,
has such faculty, for these surely have faculty to constrain and stop, and
not to mundifie and purge whereof it follows, that when we study to
incarnate, we must chiefly fly an astringent medicine, because it fixes ye
filth more straightly than may easily be loosed. Therefore wine is the best
medicine for every ulcer, in that it is an ulcer, and if it be not added that
it is an ulcer, I suppose thou will understand.

For it is only added for remembrance sake, least any should think, not as
defining any thing necessary, so that if thou show thy self mindful of
all those things, which in the former book are set out, of naming every
thing, and also of the subjects, there is no cause that hence forth I shall
define such things unto thee, it shall be abundantly for me, if I only in
every of them separate the simple effects from those that are compound, of
which things I have somewhat before spoken, and now nevertheless shall speak,
not so much truly for the things it self, as that many Physicians deceived by
the word, think hollow and unequal, new and old, filthy, and clean with
inflammation and without inflammation, to be differences of ulcers.

Therefore it is necessary to make distinction, which be the proper
differences of Ulcers, and which be complections of other affects, but of this
a little hereafter. Truly the wonted doctrine of the old Physicians which I
would were now in use, is altogether natural, for they show the cure of every
simple effect, but of them all, that does chiefly Hyppocrates, for the
curatiue method shall best proceed, if we shall speak severally of every
simple by themselves, and after show another method of all compounds, as if
there were two diseases in the order of diet, retaining and flowing, as
Thessalus supposes, when as we had spoken of the cure of either of them
severally, we must do in like sort of these both joined together. So in like
sort I suppose, because there is one kind of all ulcers, in that they are
ulcers, and also one other kind of inflammations, in that they are
inflammations, it behooves to set out the cure of an ulcer by it self, and the
cure of an inflammation by it self, and after to join both cures together,
which thing if we shall do, truly we shall find by the method declared,
that every ulcer ought to be dried and bound, but yet not mundified, the
hollownesse in the flesh also to be dried and mundified, but yet not to be
astringed.

Also after the same manner which we spoke of in hollow Ulcers, we shall for
the portion judge Nature, whether it be soft and loose, or hard and dry,
and impact, for the first, how much moyster it is, so much less need it has
of desiccatiues, the last how much drier it is, so much the more it requires
vehement desiccatiues, and medicines astringent, the emperike I suppose, will
here make mention of children, and women, and delicate bodies, and will
account young folks Plowmen and Mariners, of contrary sort, but seeing that
he understands not that the medicine does profit children and women, though
the moystures of their complexion and another, agrees in like sort, with
Plowmen and Mariners, because of their dry temperament, neither can he guess
exactlie the cure of every body, neither yet find out the cause of error,
whereby it does come to pass, that he knows not how to go to an apter
medicine, when that which he first knew by experience does little profit.

And thus we have briefly spoken of glutinatiue medicines, and here follows
another method pertaining to the preparation and composition of them, for by
and by we apply to an hollow ulcer what we list, whether it be a medicine
dry or moist, for we may strew it in every part of the ulcer, or else anoint
it, but in wounds we cannot so do, where there is a great deepnesse, for as
soon as thou have joined the sides of the wound, thou can not touch the
parts which are in the bottom divided. Therefore it is to be considered,
whether the medicine be moderatly dry and astringent, but also whether it may
come to the bottom. Cerussa and Litharge be moderate drying and astringent,
but if thou do strowe it upon the wound like as ashes, thou shall not
profit, for the virtue of the medicine that is so dry, cannot come to the
profunditie, therefore there is required some moistures, or else of some
moisture medicine, that it may be plaster like, but these belongs properly
to that speculation, which shows the composition of medicines, and not to
that which shows the reason of curing. But if we shall need it unto this
matter, we shall touch it in our work hereafter.

The fifth Chapter.
NOw will I turn again to the ulcer which requires to be cicatrised, of which
a little before we made mention, and the end of these also whereto we draw, is
of the like kind yt an hollow ulcer is, for it behooves to regenereate somewhat
yt is lost, and not only to unite yt is divided, but ye which is here to be
regenerated, is after an other sort than in an hollow ulcer, seeing yt the
matter there is blood, but here it is flesh, for that which is hollow is
filled by engendering flesh, whose beginning is blood, and that ulcer is
cicatrised that is already filled by engendering skin, which is made of the
flesh subject, and surely the flesh which may engender in an hollow ulcer, may
be like to that which is lost, but the skin which shall be restored, cannot in
all points be like ye which was before, but a thing like the skin, which also
may supply ye office of ye skin, but yet is not the skin in deed. And the
cause truly wherefore the skin perished, cannot be again ingendered, like
as flesh and fatness be, is to be sought out of natural problemes. But we
must here learn both how to imitate nature, and also the use of the skin, and
of this thing we will now show the method, and for that our purpose to cover
the flesh with some natural couerture, for that is to cicatrise an ulcer,
either we must regenerate skin, or make the upper part of the flesh like unto
skin, but skin indeed cannot be engendered, therefore let us attempt that
which may be done. But what way shall we do this? forsooth by alteration for
we labor that some part of the flesh may no longer be flesh, but may be like
skin, but by what way say thou, shall it be altered? forsooth by the
help of some medicine, whose quality will alter, and here against my will in
this place, comes the talk of elements, without which, neither can there be
found a medicine which can cicatrise, much less any that has virtue to
incarnate and glutinate, therefore because the skin is both drier and thicker
than flesh, if we shall dry and bind the flesh, we shall also make it like
the skin. And thus thou have the sum of the medicine which does cicatrise,
but this truly is not sufficient, for glutinatiues be also dry and binding,
there if thou do mark the substance of things, thou may find how these
differ from them, but for because in the adglutination of ulcers, we must dry
that which flows, so that the sick part may be free from superfluity in
making a cicatrise, we do not only consume that which flows, but also the
moisture contained in the flesh, truly it is convenient that the medicine
which does cicatrise, be a great deal drier than that which ^th adglutinate,
when he that will adglutinate has his scope, that he do consume the
abundance of the moisture, which is according to Nature, he that will
cicatrise, does not take away only this, but also some part of that which
is according to Nature.

Therefore unripe g^s, and the Pomegranad rind and the fruit of ye Egyptia^
spine, are moderate desiccatiues, Calcites^ and aes Victu^, and aeris, Squa^ma,
and Misi, and Fissum Alumen, be a great deal more vehement, and chifely Misi,
and Chalcitis, but aeris, Squamma, is more gentle, and yet aes Vstum, much more
than this, and if thou do wash it thou shall have a medicine less
corrosiue, surely this also belongs to the speculation of compounding
medicines, which in order next follows the Method curatiue, for to know the
faculties of Medicines. That truly must go before the curatiue Method, and we
have hereof entreated in an other place, but the composition of medicines must
follow, for where universally it is commanded either to dry or make moist, or
to make hot, or refrigerate, and that it must be done either moderatly, or
vehemently, or lightly, we have understood the faculty of every simple
medicine, it is convenient to consider this by it self, and alone, and also
how any may mix them profitably to his use, and by this means there is a
double knowledge of medicines, one that shows their virtues, an other of
their composition and preparation, but we must return to that which yet
remains of the Method of Ulcers.

The sixth Chapter.
THere rests as I suppose to speak of that superfluous flesh, which the
most part of Physicians call in Greek Hyposarcosin, surely this sickness is
of the kind also of those which be in quantity or magnitude, call it as it
please you, by either name. Of this sort, was hollownesse, of which we have
already entreated. Therefore like as that we call an hollow ulcer, is not one
affect, but that the hollownesse and ulcer are two, so the ulcer that has
supercrescent flesh, is not one disease, but the supercrescent flesh and the
ulcer be two, the magnitude which is against nature, shows the first
indication, which we have named the way of finding out remedies, that is to
say, the taking away of that which abounds, and this is performed by the
only help of medicines, and not by natures diligence, for it is contrariwise
that it was in engendring flesh, and adglutination, for they be judged natures
work, we only removing by medicines applied, those things which do hinder
her, but the taking away of supercrescent flesh, is no work of nature, but is
done by medicines, which do vehemently dry: surely those medicines are next to
those which do vehemently mundifie, and also to those that do ciccatrise, in
so much that through error, many take that medicine which takes away flesh,
for that which does mundifie, or for that which does ciccatrise. And that we
go not from our example, if thou do apply to a moist nature Misi and
Chalcitis, thou shall find yt it will rather take away flesh than ciccatrise.
Wherefore, if we in the want of other medicines, be compelled to use these, in
making a ciccatrise, putting but only the point of our probe in it, being
beaten into most exact lightness, in after applying to the parts which
require to be ciccatrised, as it were in most fine flower. But if we inte^d to
diminish that which ouergroweth, then we put it in more largely, truly Aerugo,
can take away flesh more than these, in so much as it passes ye bound of
ciccatrising medicines, but if thou do burn them, like as they shall be
less sharp, so shall they be found more apt to make a ciccatrise, but if thou
do also wash them, they shall be yet more gentle. Thou reme^brest one I
think, which without reason did cure a filthy ulcer, with that notable green
medicine, mixing Honey with it, after many days past, he finding the ulcer as
filthy as before, he void of knowledge, neither understanding what to do,
for it chanced that the filth was not purged, but also some part of the flesh
under it, was diminished and dissolved, because the medicine was to vehement,
(like an egregious Physician) he added more Honney continually to the medicine,
whereby it might more vehemently mundifie, as though the medicine before
applied, had not sufficiently done it. It came to pass contrary, for how much
ye more he made his medicine sharp, so much ye flesh subject was consumed, so
that the filth in the Ulcer which sprang of the dissolved flesh, the Physician
imputes it to the medicine, as though it had not wrought, and his ignorance
was not only in the curatiue method, but also in judging, for if the ulcer be
found to be in like sort, most filthy and moist, of either medicine, truly
the hollownesse is made greater by the vehement dissoluing medicine, as also
the ulcer is seen to have swollen lips, and to be read, and vexed as it were
with inflammation, and sometime also the patient feels manifest corrosion by
such a medicine, but that medicine that does less dry than is requisite, does
neither corrode, neither yet does any of these things rehearsed. I think it
therefore evident by this, that an Emperike, although he uses most distinct
experience, cannot artificially, where things prosper not, go to that which
cures by a right method, which I now do institute and begin.

The seventh Chapter.
FOR the Method which the methodelesse Thessalians do profess, thou do
know to be nothing but the bare name, void of all effect, which seeing there
is such and so manifold a method in curing an ulcer, which they neither use
the differences of Emperikes in finding out remedies, neither as Dogmatists,
taking indication of the nature of things to be done, but propounding that
which the common people know, they think to have declared a certain method
of curing ulcers, that is to say, that an hollow ulcer requires to be filled
with flesh, the ulcer filled to be brought to a ciccatrise, that which
abounds with supercrescent flesh, to be taken away, that which is filthy to
be purged, yt which is clean, to be either adglutinated or cicatrised. So
far wide be they, that they know not how to moist natures medicines, less
drying are convenient, as unto dry complections, those which do more exicate.
Therefore yt which has appeared most manifest in all our whole disputation, we
must again repeat, yt we may be to him most attentive, and that all other may
understand how much they have erred that do corrupt the method of the old
writers, I will begin with that ulcer which requires to be filled with flesh,
putting that one for example, because of it I have last made mention, and after
this I will speak together of the universal curation, therefore I suppose one
thing to be manifest, not only to them which consider by reason, but also to
them which also follow experience, that every nature does not require like
medicines, but yt those that be weaker and more delicate, require more gentle
medicines, those yt are more strong and drier, do in like sort require more
vehement: so truly stands the case in those where a Cicatrize was to be
made, and also in those which needs adglutination, for no delicate bodies
forsooth can in any wise suffer a medicine to vehement.

In the like discourse of our talk, it is evident that both the nature of the
Patient is to be considered, and also that there is a proper curation for
every man, and yet furthermore, the third thing, that is to say, because
there is an ineffable property of every nature, neither comprehensible by the
most exact knowledge, he is the best Physician of every particular patient,
which has gotten the method, whereby he may discern natures, and also
conjecture which are the proper remedies of every one. For it is an extreme
madness, to judge that there is a common curation of all men, as these most
foolish Thessalians do think, and for that cause they suppose, that all the
Theoremes of Physic are ordained, that is, they are such as skillful men do
and perform, a far knowledge of themselves, and that the art is a certain
knowledge of communities, and not properties, as though they should cure a
universal and not a particular man, therefore like as in all other, even at
the beginning they err, so they err also in this, for the general or common
man is not cured, but every one of us having another complexion and nature.
But these truly think there is a common cure of al men, I truly judge
contrary, for if I knew how to find out exactly every private nature, I would
think my self to be such a one, as I conceive in my mind, was Aesculapius.

But forasmuch as that is impossible, surely I will go as man may do, and I
have decreed to exercise my self, and do also exhort others to do the same,
and the emperickes as much as they can, to learn those things that are common,
so to draw near to those that are proper, but yet how much they are wide from
the perfection of the thing, it is before spoken. For these notes for children
or women, or old folks, or those that have soft flesh, and white, and such
like, are not to be put as they think, for sure differences, but rather how the
body is affected, in moystures and dryness, and it is convenient as much as
may, to allow the Emperick Physicians both for many other things, and also for
that they go as near as they can, to the property of the sick. For after all
their other separations, which they make, they add also that which is taken of
custom, as though hereby they shall find remedies, which are more proper for
the pacient. But we will speak hereafter more largely of custom, when we
shall prove the difference of custom, invented by the old writers, for the
knowledge of the property of the pacients nature.

These with the rest, the Empericks receive, and also do confess, that the
Physician which visits the pacient, shall better cure him, than he who has
not seen the sick. Yet for all that, when as they have added all these
things, they will not as yet, say that they have a sound and skillful
knowledge, of the proper curation of the pacient. But that most impudent
Thessalus, only understanding that an hollow ulcer must be filled, affirms
the Theoremes of Physic to be constant and firm, although as before is
said, all men know at the least this thing, not only they which now be after
this Thessalus, as another Aesculapius, was borne, but I suppose also those
that were before Deucalion, and Phoroneus, if these were reasonable, and
besides, if they knew how a hollow ulcer is to be filled with flesh. Further,
they were not ignorant, that he is a Phisitio^, which knows those medicines,
wherewith such an ulcer is to be filled with flesh.

But if these medicines be invented by experience, it is most certain, that we
must cure Empericklye, but if they be found out by reason, then we must cure
reasonably, for truly he finds not out one medicine, and uses now an other
aptly, but if this our strife is with the emperikes, that truly which I began
to say, true Physic it self does make conjecture of the nature of the
pacient, I suppose the common sort call it in greek Idiosyncrasian, and all
they confess it to be incomprehensible, and therefore they leave the true art
of Physic to Aesculapius, and Apollo. Surely all this knowledge stands of a
double beginning, for an observation, the Emperickes take the beginning of
those things which manifestly appear, the Logicians truly of the Elements
themselves. For that another medicine has profited other, very children do
now well near understand, and reason which is grounded on the Elements, does
also confirm the same. For if thou do make xv. differences in the
complexions of men, by reason of excess and defect, and that only in moist
nature, truly it shall also be necessary that thou know xv. differences of
medicines, which thou will use, of which some dry more, and some less,
whereby thou may find that agrees to every nature, and if also in dry
complexions there be put other xv. differences, and thou require other xv.
medicines also to these, thou shall have in all.xxx. medicines, which shall
agree to xxx. natures, which only he can rightly use, which has diligently
exercised himself in the temperaments of bodies. Whether therefore, if all the
body be of a dryer complexion, shall it be cured by medicines which do more
exciecate: if any part of the same be dryer by nature than the rest, shall it
require less drying medicines.

Also whether is it here evident that what part has a dryer temperament,
requires dryer medicines, that which is more moist, less desiccatiues. And
all this truly these methodlesse Thessalians do let pass, which think one
medicine to agree with every part, truly the Emperickes how much in this thing
do they excel these Thessalian Methodicians, so much are they inferior unto
true Methodicians and Logicians, although they in deed being taught by us,
have also one medicine for Ulcers in the eyes, another for those in the ears,
or joints, or flesh, or only skin, but that in those they cannot go to an
other medicine, it may easily appear by that we have heretofore spoken.

The eight Chapter.
NOw seeing that we have sufficiently spoken of these things, let us again
return to the beginning of our disputation, and let us mix with an ulcer, all
such affectes which are co^plicated with it, beginning first with
intemperatures. If the exulcerate flesh, either before by any occasion, or in
the time of ye vlceration, be made either more hot or cold than is meet, it
does require a remedy which does not only moderately dry, but does also make
hot or refrigerate, so much as the part affected is gone from his natural
state, when as it cannot come to pass, that either there shall be flesh
engendered in the ulcer, or the hollownesse filled, or adglutination to be made,
or to ciccatrize well, except the flesh subject be according to nature,
neither was it spoken in vain, that these are the works of nature, but
filthy ulcers may be mu^dified, they that are supercrescent diminished, the
flesh not keeping her natural state, for that they only are the works of
medicines.

Wherefore thou must have the more regard of the just te^perature of the
vlcerate parts as often as thou will either incarnate, or glutinate, or
ciccatrise, the motions of nature are to be observed, which every of these
rehearsed, do follow, but otherwise they shall not be observed, except ye part
be found according to nature, as if there were inflammation.

With an ulcer, no man will attempt either to incarnate, or conglutinate, or
ciccatrise, before the inflammation be expelled, so in like sort I suppose,
that if there be only intemperatenesse without inflammation, we shall not hope
for any of ye foresaid, before this be cured. Therefore hereof spri^geth again a
certain indicatio^ of ye finding out of medicines, which were before
comprehended, for all they were siccati^, but they did differ among themselves,
by reason of excess and defect, and it is not before defined, how forsooth they
should make hot or refrigerate. But the Method as it were, enforces to search
out also this thing. But it behooves to mark, not only whether it do
exciccate, but also, whether it do greatly heat or refrigerate. Wherefore
thou shall eschew the use of Altercum and Mandrage, and Meconium, although they
excicate, as much as is meet for an ulcer, because they vnmeasurably
refrigerate. Resin, and Pitch, and Asphaltus, although they do moderately
exciccate, yet they be moderately hot, therefore no man will use these alone,
neither otherwise than mixed with other, which do gently refrigerate, making
of all one temperate medicine. But if these things are thus, as truly they
are, it is convenient also to mark the temperature of the air, for this being
as a certain medicine coming outwardly to our bodies, if it be to hot or
cold, it hinders the cure. Therefore diligence is to be had, that the
medicine does help the excess of it. Therefore Hippocrates uses medicines of
colder faculty, in the hot times of the year, and in cold times hotter
medicines.

And here truly thou art not ignorant, how a certain dull methodician did
confess that he did mark how the air about the pacient was affected, in
heat and cold, and yet not to suffer the times of the year to be regarded, as
though the names it self, of the times of the year, did either profit or hurt,
and not their temperament, or that the old writers for this cause had not
respect to it. But I think it abundantly showed, that who so will by a
certain method cure an Ulcer, he must of force both come to the first
Elements, and also consider the times of the year, and the temperaments of
bodies, not only in the whole, but also in every part.

Again, we must repeat that, yt has been spoken of indication, which is taken
of moist and dry, for like as the moist nature requires moister medicines, and
dryer natures drier medicines, so here ye hotter nature requires hotter air,
the colder requires colder. For yt in those which are against nature, and
those which are according to nature, there is a contrary indication. For those
that are according to nature show the like, those that are against nature,
contraries. If we will conserve them, these must be of force removed.

The ninth Chapter.
ANd thus I suppose yt I have clearly taught that he who shall well cure an
ulcer, must consider the complexion of bodies, times of the year, and natures
of parts, also that the first indication curatiue is taken of the only
effect, but for all that the remedies cannot be thereby found out, except we
first do ascend to ye elements of bodies, and way the patients temperament, not
only of the body, but also of the sick part, and considering with these the
temperature of the air, which truly do both pertain unto the present
state, and also unto regions, that there are together in one curation contrary
indications, and how to use them it shall be set out here after more largely,
notwithstanding now also it shall not be from the purpose, to speak also in
this place thereof in few words, for I do think no marvel, although the
patients complexion be moister, and yet the part affected to be drier, or
contrariwise yt the part be moister, and the te^perature of ye whole body
drier, in like sort than, the part is of contrary temperament, in hotnesse and
coldness with the whole body, therefore like as if the whole body were in
mean temperature, which we have called best, we should not need to alter any
thing in medicines, touching the nature of the Pacient, so whereas the body is
soon drier or moister, or hotter or colder, than is requisite, it behooves so
much to increase the force of medicines, as the body is declined unto natural
intemperatnesse. We have not forgotten to think what natural temperatures is,
and what is against nature, for we have spoken of yt inother our works, but
chiefly in ye book which is entitled, of inequall temperatures, admit
therefore yt the whole complexion of ye sick body is more moist, and for that
cause require medicines less de^iccatiue, and that the affected part is in the
number of those which are more dry, such we have said be the parts less
fleshie, as about the fingers and joints, also the parts about the ears, nose,
eyes, and teeth. And to be brief, whereas there are many cartilages, and cotes,
and ligaments, and bones, and nerves, for here is no fat or flesh, or but
very little, the indication within these is here taken of the nature of the
part, is contrary to that which is taken of the nature of the whole body,
wherefore if so be that how much the complexion of the Patient is more moist
than is requisite, so much the part affected is more dry, we shall neither
add, neither yet subtract from the medicine, but we must use such a medicine
as we would apply to the ulcer, made in the part of mean temperature, and
where the body is moderatlie temperate, but if the part be so much the more
dry than is requisite, as the temperame^t of the body is moister, we must so
much increase ye dryness of the medicine, or the temperament of the part,
exceed the temperament of the whole, as if the exulcerate part exceed in
dryness four parts the just temperatnesse, and that the patients nature is
three degrees moister, it is manifest yt the part which is now vlcerate,
requires a medicine one degree drier, than where as the part is temperate, it
is evident yt all these are taken by conjecture, and that he shall best
conjecture, which is exercised in reasoning of these, and truly in all such
there are together at one time contrary indications, neither shall I need to
speak also of those indications, which are taken of hot and cold, because
they may be understood by ye which is spoken. Truly in other, the indications
are separated by times, in which there are finished, and it behooves also
chiefly in the beginning of the curation, yt one to cease, and the other to
do his part, example, if an ulcer be with hollownesse and very filthy,
there is a three fold affect, against nature, the ulcer, the hollownesse, and
the filth, the order of curing in purging the filth, because the ulcer cannot
be any thing adglutinated or filled with flesh before it be clean, the cure
of the hollownesse has the second place, for if we shall either adglutinate or
incarnate, or to speak briefly, cure the ulcer, we cannot fill the hollownesse:
imagine therefore, yt not only these three do infect the part, but also
inflammation or Erisipelas, or Gangrena, or some intemperatiues, either simple
or compound, whether or no it is manifest, that the ulcer cannot be filled with
flesh, before yt this be taken away, it is before said, that generation of
flesh comes of that which is sound under, but new flesh cannot grow, of that
which inflammation infesteth, and is intemperate, and to conclude that which is
sick, therefore there is of them to be considered a three fold end in all such
coniu^ctions, one as it were taken of the cause which is to come after, another
has the reason, without which not, the third is named such as do enforce and
accelerate. For ye just temperature of the flesh, is as it were the cause,
which makes that is vlcerate to grow with it, and fills the hollownesse.
The pureness and cleernesse of the ulcer has the place, without which not,
for the filth lets, this does prolong the cure, the hollownesse has the
place to the ulcer, without which not, for if the hollownesse be not filled,
the ulcer cannot be cicatrised, therefore if thou do regard these, thou
shall find the order of curing, as if inflammation and hollownesse, and an
ulcer, and filth, be found together in the part, we must first cure the
inflammation, secondly the filth, thirdly the hollownesse, and last the ulcer.
And truly in the rehearsed, both the order and the invention of things to be
done, is taken of these, but the indication of that which enforces or
accelerateth, is not here reckoned, in other truly it is, for that affect is
first of all to be cured, whereof there first follows peril to the man, yea,
and not only first, but only it, as if the head of a muscle be pricked, there
follows conuulsion, which cannot be remitted by the help of convenient
medicines, for thou shall heal the conuulsion, ye muscle being cut overthwart,
notwithstanding thou have corrupted some motion of the part, in like manner
when there immoderatlie flows blood out of a vein or artery, if thou cuttest
the whole vessel overthwart, although thou can not cure the Ulcer, yet thou
have taken away the peril, which should have come through the flux of blood.
Now we are constrained after to cut a nerve overthwart, as often as we see
either conuulsions, or madness, or both, being great, and hardly curable, to
follow after wounding. In like sort, where luxation chances in any of the
greater joints, we cure the ulcer, but leave the luxation incurable, for if we
would cure also this, conuulsions would follow. The third end to put before our
eyes of curing is, unto that which enforces and accelerateth, and is contrary
to the other two rehearsed, neither is it all one, to consider any thing as
the cause, or as that which has the place, with out which not, or as that
which enforces and accelerateth. But we have said, that which enforces is
such sometime, that it leaves the other affect incurable, and also that both
we make the affect, partly in the pu^cture of a nerve or tendon, or profusion
of blood, of the vessels, and partly in the muscle whose head is wounded, for
whereas the luxation is with the ulcer, we make not the affect, but leave only
that uncured which is made. But we shall speak more exactlie of these
hereafter.

The tenth Chapter.
AT this present it pleases us to go to the difference, and to comprehend
briefly our propounded talk, that we ouerpasse not any indication of
inue^ting remedies, if any yet remain. Therefore they do call as differences
of ulcers, an ulcer without inflammation, and a rotten ulcer, and a devouring or
corrosiue ulcer, and an ulcer with Gangrena and Erisipelas, and a Cancerous
ulcer, and an ulcer with pain, and an ulcer void of pain, and such like, if
any coming forth sets out the emperike curatio^, and thinking no other
thing, names them differences of ulcers, we will not contend with him, for we
have said a thousand times, yt it behooves not to contend about names, but if
he goes about as it were, to show any artificial thing of indications, he is
to be taught that all the rehearsed affects be compound, and that there are
other differences of a simple and sole ulcer, and to which there is no other
affect joined, for if there be division with any edged thing, if the form of
that which did wound be imprinted in the part divided, there shall truly be so
many differences of ulcers, of oblique, right, retort like a bristle crooked
like an hook, and so being every way, and all these differences be of the
figure. Again, there are a thousand other differences of the magnitude, for an
ulcer both is, and is also said to be bigger or lesser than another, also
great and little, also a short and a long, a shallow and a deep, and in every
of these, both that it is more or less, such a one whether it be in ye
difference of space, or magnitude, or quantity, or call it after what manner
you will, but if this so be, then truly an ulcer equal or inequall, shall be
with the profunditie of division, for if it chance that the thing being cut in
length, the higher part of the division may go in deeply, the lower part to
be in the upper part of the body, or contrary, the higher part of the wound
to be in the upper part, the lower to be deeper, also these, that is to say,
to be diuulsed in some part, or total, and to have been cut, and where that
wound went overthwart under the skin, the one part of the vlcerate part to
be seen, the other to be hidden under the skin, and that to be in the higher
parts or lower, or sides, all these be differences of ulcers. Again, of the
time there are other differences of ulcers taken, as an old or new ulcer, of
small or long time, and in all these, the reason of more and less is to be
numbered. And these differences are taken of the nature of the ulcer most
proper, which are taken of the substance of the thing, for those that are taken
of the figure and magnitude of division, and that either in length or
deepnesse, or in both dimensions, also in these with equality or inequality,
these that come outwardly, and has the place of yt without which is not, also
of the time in which the ulcer is made, for so one is called a new, another an
old ulcer.

Also of that that either part or all, is not seen or seen, also of the
generation, for that is all cut, or all broken, or part cut, and part broken,
and if thou will perceive the differences of the place in which the ulcer is,
as in the end of a muscle, or beginning of a muscle, or midst of a muscle, or
that the skin is vlcerate, or that the ulcer be in the liver or belly, they
be forsooth differences of ulcers, not taken of the proper nature of them, but
of the places in which they are, but when any says the ulcer is not infected
with inflammation, or pressed with supercrescent flesh, or hollow, and thinks
that they be like those which lately I rehearsed, he must of force be deceived
in the curatiue method, for in Greek Phlegmon Elcos, by the form of speech
has the like figure of interpretation with a little ulcer, but yet that which
is meant thereby is not alike, for deep and hollow when we speak of an ulcer,
we show these proper differences, but Phlegmon is not at all the difference,
when as the part may be infected with inflammation, yea, whereas there is no
ulcer, so that I think it lawful to change the form of speech, if thou will
say, an ulcer with inflammation to have come to any man, thou shall go nearer
than to the nature of the thing, and shall interpret it more clearly, but not
if thou shall say, some with bigness and some with littleness, to be made,
for thou may speak more evidently, and after the nature of the thing, if
thou shall say he had a great ulcer, and a little, so that if it may be done,
that the form of speech be changed, both more convenient to the nature of the
thing, and more manifest to the hearers, we shall not leave of, whereby it may
less be done, for the way to fly deceit in things, is that, to use defined
speech, therefore what method may we appoint, in such there is to be noted a
certain precept, and as it were, a scope, whereby the diligent may easily
discern by and by, whether any speaks of the difference of any affect, of
the joining of another affect.

Therefore let this be to thee a difference, that which may severally and by
it self stand, that shall never be difference of any other affect, therefore
magnitudge, littlenes, equality, inequality, time, and figure, be of the
number of those which happen to other, but an ulcer, and inflammation, and
Gangrena, and corruption, may stand severally and by themselves.

There are certain affects of our bodies against nature, as chance necessarily
to affects, for unto al these it follows necessarily yt they be either little
or great, or equal, or inequall, or new, or old, or they appear evidently,
or they are hid and not seen. To be infected with inflammation, is not of ye
sort which happen to an ulcer, as neither to begin to putrify, or infected
with Gangrena, all those be in the number of diseases, for they are affects
against nature, and corrupts the action. Again, there are other as it were,
differences of ulcers spoken of, as a tormenting ulcer and a filthy ulcer. But
here also is some compound showed, but after another sort than was spoken of
an ulcer infested with inflammation or a rotten ulcer, for here inflammation and
putrefaction be affects, their dolor and filthiness be of the kind of
accidents: in like condition when we say, Cachochimo^ vlcus, that is, an ulcer
infested with ill juice, or an ulcer vexed with sluxe or corosion, ye cause is
coupled with the affect. And hereby it is manifest, that the first and simple
imfirmities void of composition, be as it were the elements of the curatiue
method, which is now instituted. Wherefore the rather I have numbered all such
infirmities, in our commentaries of the differences of infirmities. Truly all
is one, whether thou call the^ the first or simple, when that which is first is
simple, and that which is simple is first, and therefore elementarie. There is
an indication taken of the differences, although not of all, for a new or old
ulcer shows nothing, although some think contrary, but these deceive
themselves, not otherwise than in the order of diet, where they affirm, that
there is one indication in the beginning, another in the augmentation, another
in the vigor, and another in the declination, of which seeing hereafter I shall
more largely entreat, there is no cause why here I should make more words, yet
for all this I will here ad ye shall serve ye time present. They think yt a new
ulcer, when as it is free from any other affect, and has no accident joined
with it, does show another curation than an old ulcer. But yt is not so, for in
yt it is only an ulcer, and no other thing, it is such a one as has no
hollownesse, or dolor, or filth, and is free from every other affect, does
only require the cure of an ulcer, whose end set by us, is either unition, or
adglutination, or coition, or continuation. For I have a thousand times said,
that thou may call it as thou please, so that the thing it self be not
changed, therefore this kind of ulcer, whether it be new or old, requires
alwaie the same curation. That difference which is taken of the time shows
nothing proper at all. But if the ulcer has hollownesse deeply hid under the
skin, it behooves to consider whether it be in the higher part, that the
matter may readily flow out, or in the lower part, so yt it is there stayed.
The cure of that ulcer where there is no flux, is like the cure of other. But
it behooves that we make certain issuing out where there is none, and that is
two ways, either the hollownesse being cut in the pendent place, only
opened, both the nature of the parts, and also the bigness of the ulcer shall
show, when as either of them must be done, for if the places themselves make
the cutting dangerous, and the ulcer shall be great, it is more convenient to
open in the pendent place, but otherwise it is better to make incision, and
whereas there is an issue, let the rolling be begun above, and end beneath. We
have heretofore spoken, that the difference of ulcers which is taken of all
the wounded parts, is very necessary to show the cure, but the indication
was of similer, this which I now speak of, is as it were of isntrumental,
truly we will in the books following speak more largely of that indication,
which is as it were of similer bodies, or as of instrumental. Now we must go
to the proper differences of ulcers, and define of it, whether it be
overthwart, or right, or deep, or shalow, or little, or else great. Ulcers made
overthwart, for that their lips do gape more, and are asunder, do require to be
more diligently joined, and therefore we must use both stitching and hooks.
Those that are made in the length of ye muscle, if thou bind it with a roller
of two beginnings, thou shall not need either stitching or hooks, but if thou will otherwise bind it, use thou either stitching or hooks. Few stitches
shall in this suffice. And thou shall cure great ulcers with vehement
desiccatiue medicines, if thou remembrest that which before is spoken. The
medicines which do moderatly dry, will abundantly heal small ulcers. Deep
ulcers be ever also great, therefore they must be rolled with two beginnings,
and the lips of it be spedely adglutinated, and those which are both very
deep and also long, as they are great two ways, so do they show a double
indication, therefore they require vehement siccatiues. Neither join thou the
lips to soon together, and roll it with two beginnings, and take deep
stitches.

In like sort, if there come many differences together, of which every one has
his indication, it is expedient to use them all, so yt they be not contrary.
But if they be contrary among themselves, we have heretofore showed how it
behooves them to be denied of these, but we will more largely set it out
hereafter. And now it seems good in this place to end this third book: In
the fourth, which shall follow, we will dispute of those affectes which for the
more part accustom to follow ulcers, and with these there shall be set out the
curations of inward causes.

The first Chapter.
WE have said that there is one kind of disease that is called solution of
continuitie, which comes into all the parts of the body of mankind, howbeit
it has not one name in them all. For solution of continuitie in the fleshie
part, is called an ulcer, in the bone a fracture, the Greeks call it Catagma,
in the nerve, a conuulsion, the Greeks call it Spasma. There be of the same
kinds of Solutions, which the Greeks call Apospasma, Regma, and Thlasma.
Thlasma in the ligament, Apospasma and Regma in the veins and muscles, because
of any violent stroke or grievous fall, or any other great motion. The
solution of continuitie, called Ecchimosis, in the Greek, comes most often
with concussion and ruption. Sometime solution of continuitie comes by
opening the orifices of the veins, in Greek named Anastomasis. Also it
comes of that which is called of many Diapedisis. Other solutions of
continuitie happen of Erosion, in Greek called Anabrosis. But it is a
disposition already meddled and composed with an other kind of disease that
consists in the quantity of the parts, as before has been showed, when as
we did entreat of hollow ulcers, which do proceed of two causes, that is to
say, of Exition and Erosion. It is manifestly known by what means exition
comes. And if erosion abound inwardly, it comes of Cachochimia, if
outwardly, it is done either by strong medicine or fire, it behooves then, as
is said before, to take diligent heed, and discern the simple diseases from
the compound, for to a simple disease, a simple remedy is convenient, and to a
compound disease, a compound medicine.

Also we have said before, what method must be kept to cure co^pou^d diseases,
yet notwithstanding it is not enough to know the generality of the said
method, but to be exercised in all parts thereof. Seeing then that in the same
is need by manner of speaking of sundry particular methods, because that
every kind of disease has his own method, then that which rests of the
curation of ulcers, must be performed in this book, taking the beginning
here.

Every ulcer is simple and alone, without other dispositions and affects with
it, or it is with some other disposition, or diverse, whereof some have not
only stirred up the same ulcer, but has augmented it. The other are, without
which the said ulcer cannot be cured. Of the^ we have spoken here before, we
shall speak in this present book of the dispositions which augmenteth the
ulcer, in the which lies double counsel of curation, that is to say, either
to take the said dispositions all wholly out of the body, or to surmount the
incommoditie that abounds in it. The which thing may be easily done, if the
disposition be little, but if it be great, ye ulcer may not be cured, until ye
same disposition be taken away. Wherefore we must diligently consider, what
the said affects and dispositions be, and how many in number, in taking our
beginning, as is said before. Every ulcer is by it self alone, or with
hollownesse, ye the flesh being subject be natural, and that there be nothing
betwixt the joining of the lips, that may let ye conglutination thereof, which
oftentimes happens either by hair, a Spiders web, mattier, oil, or such
like things, that may let the joining together.

And these things are as Symptomata and accidents of the said wound, which if
they be present, may hinder the curation, but if they be not, they let not,
but the disposition of the flesh, is cause of that which follows. For with
the same flesh, and by the same, lips that were asunder are closed, and the
hollownesse filled.

It behooves then that the said flesh be natural, because that these two
things may be well and commodiously made perfect. Then it is natural if it
keep his own temperament, which thing is common to all other parts, for it
behooves that the flesh subject be wholly temperate, as well to close the
ulcers, as to fill them with flesh. But is that enough I pray you? Must not
the blood that comes to it be good also, and moderate in quantity? I think
this truly to be true. For that blood which is corrupt, does so differ from
adglutination and filling the flesh, as also sometime to exulcerate and erode
the body. And if it be overmuch in quantity, it engendereth excrements in the
ulcers (as we have before spoken,) and hinders the curation. And also there
be three kinds of ulcers which are difficill and hard to be cured. The first
abounds by the vntemperature of the flesh, being subject. The second by the
vice and ill quality of the blood coming to it. The third, of a great measure
and quantity of the said blood. Ought not the division to be made thus or
otherwise? That is to say, the cause wherefore some ulcers are stubburne and
difficill to be healed is, for the mistemperance of the flesh exulcerate, or
else for the gathering of humors unto the vlcerate part. Yet again the
mistemperate flesh ought to be divided into two differences. The first is, when
ye flesh being subject is out of his nature only in quality. The second is,
when with the evil quality it has tumor against nature. The flowing of
humors is divided into two differences, that is to say, into the quality and
quantity of humors.

Sometime diverse of the said dispositions are mixed together, and sometime
all. But the method for to cure them, ought not to be given all together, but
each one by himself.

The second Chapter.
AND if the distemperance of the flesh be dry, moderate it with bathing and
wetting in temperate water. But at all times that this remedy shall be used,
the end of the bathing and wetting shall be till the particle come ruddie, and
rise in a lump. Then cease the bathing and moisting, for if you bath it any
more, you shall close the humor again that was loosed, and so you shall
profit nothing. Likewise the moistning faculty of medicines ought to be
greater than is accustomed in a whole part. If the flesh be more moist than
natural habitude, you must have regard to the contrary, for the faculty of
medicines in ye case ought to be desiccatiue, and to use no water. But if thou
must wash the ulcer, take wine or Posca, that is to say, Oxicratum, or the
decoction of some sharp herb. Likewise you shall cool the pride of ye flesh
that is too hot, and heat that which is too cold, you shall know such
intemperatures, partly by the color, and partly by feeling of the diseased
patient. For sometimes they confess they feel great heat in the particle,
sometime manifold coldness, and so delight themselves in hot or cold
medicines. And sometime appears redness, and sometime whiteness. But to
distinguish these things, it is not the duty of this our proponed work, in
the which work we show not the method to know the affectes, but to cure them,
in such wise yt by consequence of words, we be come unto the said method, to
know the affects. Again let us return to our purpose.

If any parts are vlcerate with tumor against nature, first the tumor must
be cured. What ought to be the curation of all tumors, we shall say
hereafter. Presently we shall entreat of that which is joined unto unkind
ulcers. But when the lips of the ulcers are discolored and somewhat hard, they
must be cut unto the whole flesh. But if such affect is like to proceed,
further deliberation must be had, least that which does seem to be repugnant
unto nature, shall be cut out, or in longer space to be cured, and without
doubt in such a case it is good to know ye patients mind. For some had rather
to be long in curing, than to suffer incision, and other are ready to endure
all things, so that they may the sooner be made whole. Likewise here shall be
spoken of the ill juice which flows to the exulcerate part, and in as much as
it is a malignant and a wicked humor, it shall be spoken of hereafter in his
own place. When as therefore the humor which flows to the vlcerate parts,
is not far of, nor does abound in quality or quantity, it shall be then
convenient to direct it, and to restrain the flux which comes unto it, and
also to cool the heat of the parts that be near the ulcer. Furthermore, you
must behold the ligature or rolling at the ulcer, and leading it to the whole
part, as Hyppocrates commands in the fractured bones. Also that the medicines
that are ministered to the said ulcers, must be more stronger than they that are
applied to a simple ulcer. And if the flux of humors will not stay with
convenient medicines, then you must seek further the cause of the said flux,
and take it away. If the flux come by weakness of the member that receives
it, the said weakness must be cured. And such curations also shall be proper
for the vlcerate part. But if the cause of the flux be through the abundaunce
of ye blood, or of the ill disposition of all the body, or of any of the
superior parts, you must first take away the said causes. The weakness of
the part, forth of which abundance of juice does flow, comes whole of the
intemperancie, and not altogether. Whereof it follows, that the vlcerate flesh
is only intemperate, and not weak and feeble, and sometime it chances both
the one and the other. For the great intemperancie is ye cause of the
imbecilitie of ye affected part, the which intemperancie is cured as is
aforesaid, in refrigerating the heat, humecting ye dry, warming the cold, and
desiccating the moist. And if the place be too cold and moist together, the
medicines must be in warming and drying together, and so of the other
intemperances, in putting away every quality ye surmounteth by his contrary.
The reason is: Every thing ye behaueth it self well, is according to nature,
not only in living things, but in pla^ts, and also in all other things there is
an equality, which ye Greeks call Simmetron, and without excess of al vicious
humors. For the thing where nothing can be taken fro or put to, neither any
part, or any quality, it is all perfect in one equality: contrariwise, the
thing that must have taken fro it, or else somewhat added to it, is not in a
natural and perfect estate. Wherefore it is not possible to cure rightly, but
in taking away that which is excess, and putting to it ye which lacks. In
another place we must speak of ye overmuch or lack of things, but when any
quality is over much, it is necessary that the other quality contrary to
him, overcome him again, and the corruption of humors or intemperancie, be
removed in restoring the said quality that wanted, for in cooling that which
was too hot, thou shall restore that which lacks, and diminish yt which was
too much abundant. Thus it is necessary that the curation of the things that
are put far from their natural habitation, by some intemperancie, be made
perfect again by things of contrary virtue. And thus the flesh or any part
thereof, wherein is flux of humors, because of weakness, ought to be made in
this manner, (as is said before) and when the intemperancie is cured, then
proceed to the cure of the ulcer, first curing the intemperancie, as if it had
come without the ulcer: By the which thing it is manifest, that all such
curation is not proper to the ulcer, but to the intemperancie.

Likewise if any flux of humors happen to the vlcerate parts, as well by the
occasion of any particular member, as of all the body, whereunto the blood or
any ill humors do resort, first, remedy must be had either to the particle
that is cause of the flux, or else to the whole body. Thus then we shall cure
first the varices, that are often resorting unto the vlcered place, before you
cure the ulcer, and then afterward you may the easilier cure the ulcer.
Likewise in them that have a disease in the spleen, or in any other notable
part, first it behooves to cure the said part, and then after to proceed to
the curation of the ulcer, howbeit none of the curations hereof is proper to
the ulcer, but some other affects or dispositions, that either engendereth the
ulcer, or that nourishes and conserueth it.

The third Chapter.
But now I think it time to define that there is no indicatio^ of outward, or
(as they term it) of primitive causes of curation, but the indication or
curation to have his beginning of the affects it self. But those things that
ought to be done perticularlie, are found out either of that which the
indication shows, either of the nature of the affected part, or of the
temperature of the air, or other like things, but to speak briefly, no
indication may be taken of things that be not yet come. But forasmuch as we
ought to know the affect, that is not manifest unto us by reason or wit, we are
often constrained to enquire of the extreme and primitive cause. For this
occasion the vulgar people supposes, that the said primitive cause is
Indication of curation, which is altogether otherwise. As it appears likewise
in those, where the affect may be exactlie known. For if Ecchymosis, or an
Ulcer, or Erisipelas, or putrefaction, or Phlegmon, be in any part, it is a
superfluous thing to enquire the efficient cause of these diseases, except they
be remaining. For in so doing we shall cure that thing which is already
finished, and shall prohibit the efficient cause to proceed any further. But
if the said efficient cause which produced the effect, has no longer biding
there, then we shall remove away the affect. For to put away the cause that
is not there, it were impossible. For curation appertains to the thing
present, as providence to the thing to come. For that thing which does not now
hurt, neither is to be feared that it will hurt hereafter, is out from both
the offices of the art, that is to say, from curation and providence.
Wherefore in such things there ought to be no searching of any indication,
neither yet to cure, nor to provide (as is said before) notwithstanding the
knowledge of the primitive cause, is profitable to us in things unknown.
Nevertheless the Emperikes take sometime the primitive cause as part of the
course of the disease, that the Greeks call Sindrome, wherein they have
observed and experimented ye curation, as in that that has been hurt with a
mad dog, or venomous beasts.

Thus does also some Dogmatists, which does affirm to cure such diseases by
experience only, without rational Indication, for they take the cause
primitive, as part of all the Syndrome and universal course: but the primitive
cause serves nothing to the indication of curing, although it be profitable to
know of the nature of the disease, to them that have not known the nature of
venomous beasts, by use and experience, and thereof takes indication curatiue,
truly the outward cause of curation being known, does nothing profit to the
indication, but to the knowledge of the present affect. For put we the case
that we know that the venime of a Scorpion is of a cold nature, and for that
cause, as of a cold thing, I take Indication for the remedy, howbeit the case
is suth, that I have no sign, whereby I do understand that the body is hurt
of a Scorpion: it is manifest that if I do know that the body is hurt of a
Scorpion, that then I would enforce me to warm all the whole body, and also
the part affected, without abiding for any experience, in taking mine
indication of the nature of the thing. We have declared in the book of
Medicaments, wherein it behooves them to be exercised, that will take any
profit of these present Commentaries, no such faculty can be found without
experience. Truly it should be a gift of felicity, if any having the sight
of Litargerium, Castoreum, or Cantarides, forthwith to understand their
virtues: For like as in all things is committed error, as well by those that
exceed, as by those that lack, so here (as the Proverb is among the
Greeks) this Thiapauson, that is to say, they differ among themselves. Also
they affirm, that the virtue of medicines is not yet known, and that after so
great experience, and the other that suppose and say, that the said virtues
be known only by experience. The first speaks vndiscreetlie, if that be a
thing imprudent, to affirm a thing impossible, and the other be altogether
stupidious, sturdie, and foolish. But for this present time we will say no
more, because I have spoken more plainly in the third book of Temperame^ts,
and also in the books of Medicaments. Nevertheless for the knowledge of
diseases, some primitive causes are profitable, but after that the present
disease is altogether known, then the cause primitive is totallie unprofitable.

Now we have declared that it does not become us to meddle and confound both
the doctrines together, but the Emperikes ought to be spoken by themselves, and
the rationals by themselves. We must now call to mind, because we have purposed
in this present Commentary, to entreat of the doctrine Rational, although to
some things yt we do say, we do not add absolutely that all be not true,
but only after the sentence of the methodicall sort: but that every man ought
to add and reason that thing by himself. And at this time we have said that
there is no cause primitive, which is profitable to the Indication curatiue,
although it serves well to the knowledge of the disease. And we confess that
the cause primitive is part of the Syndrome, and of all the Emperikes course,
that they cure all diseases by reason and by experience. But in all yt we shall
say heereafafter, it is not necessary to add such words. Then let us return
to our first purpose, in taking the principal indication certain and
undoubtful, whereof we have also used here before, as we have said, that the
disease yt requires to be cured, judges the end whereunto the Surgion ought to
intend, and of the same all other indications are taken. Wherefore we have
begun to speak, that the said indication has no manner of affinity with the
cause primitive: for put we the case that any ulcer be come of a flux in any
part, then it is manifest that the said ulcer proceeds of corrupt humors,
for nature is accustomed so for to do in diseases, when she purges the body,
and sends all the corruption to the skin, in such sort, that the skin is
vlcerate, and all the body purged.

What is then the curation of such ulcers? certainly as of other ulcers,
wherein no corrupt affect or disposition is, which the Greeks call Cacoethae.
But if it be so, it is evident yt no indication is to be taken of the cause
which has excised the ulcer, but if the vicious humor remain, some
indication might then be taken of the said cause, for otherwise it should be
an absurd thing, yt that which is no more remaining, should require curation,
or if he should show curation where there is no need. Wherefore it is a strange
thing, and wholly against reason, to say that the indication curatiue ought to
be taken of the cause primitive.

And for because that the said Indication is not taken of the same cause, it is
evident, that it must be taken of the cause present.

But what is such an Indication? forsooth if a man will properly define it, it
is a thing which appertains to providence, (which the Greeks call
Prophalacticae,) but if any will abuse the word, it is called Therapeutica.
But for as much as of the ulcers themselves, certain be simple, and certain
be hollow, (if a man will diligently mark and consider) the curation of them
is brought to pass in eschuing and foreseeing those things which be hurtful
unto nature. And when we would bring any thing to good success, we had
need of Natures help, as in closing of an Ulcer, and regeneration of flesh,
in the which things the chiefest care and regard appertains unto that part of
the art, which is called Providence, but it is called vulgarly healing.

And therefore this part of the art that is named Providence, is divided into
two kinds. The one is that which does remove away the disease present, the
other which withstandeth the disease, that it may not come to his fullness.
Therefore the younger Physicians here do not understand, that their
disputation and contention consists only in names, wherefore if they were
studious in things, they should find out that there were two differences of
the functions and actions of medicine, that is to say, the disease already
come, or to withstand those that are not yet present. Then there is no man but
he will confess, that to cure or to heal, is no other thing, but to take away
the disease that is present, whether it be done away by the work of nature or
by medicines, but providence is a thing that lets the disease, that he may
not come, and truly they which do cure the ill humors which come to the
ulcer, do minister the art of medicine by reason and method, in purging and
taking away those things which do hinder the course of Nature. And these two
manners of curing are properly called in Greek Prophilactica, (for they let,
as it was said before,) that the filthy mattier engendereth not in the ulcer,
neither yet overmuch moisture, which may hinder the curation.

The fourth Chapter.
IT is but in vain truly, thus carefully to strive about the name, but it
is more convenient (in my judgment) to give some good method to cure the
ulcers, such as I have spoken of, as well in the book going before, as in this.
But I do much marvel at the dullness of Thessalus, writing thus of the
curation of ulcers, the which are called Cacoethae. The communities of ulcers
that continue long time, and that are incurable, or else return again after
the matter induced, be very necessary, in likewise as in ulcers that may not
grow together and be closed, it must be considered what is the cause that
lets and procures the said growing together, the which cause ought to be
taken away. But in them that renew ye ciccatrise again, it behooves to keep
the same ciccatrise, that is to say, in strength, (for so we have translated
To metafuicrinen) and in comforting the suffering member or all the body in
common, and in ordering it, that it endure not lightly, by ye remedies
appropriate thereto. And when Thessalus had propounded such words in the
beginning of his book of Surgerie, he writes afterward more plainly of this
matter: The ulcers that endure long and may not be healed, or that renew and
come after the ciccatrise, give such indications, that is to say, if they come
not to ciccatrise, it behooves you to let the union and coming together, and
to renew the vlcerate place again. And after that you have made it like unto a
fresh wound, it must be healed as a bleeding wound. But if the said cure profit
nothing, you ought to mittigate the inflammation, and make as much diligence as
you can. But the ulcers that come to a ciccatrise, and open again in their
accessions and exulcerations, you ought to cure them like unto the^, where
there is a fresh inflammation, and afterward you ought to apply upon the said
ulcer a plaster of mittigatiue things, until the ire and fearcenesse be
abated: after this is done, you ought to dress the ciccatrise, and then make
the parts about it wax red, in wrapping it about with a Malagma made of
mustard seed, or with some other medicament, that may change the said parts,
and make them less subject to diseases. And if they cease not with these
things, you ought to have cure of all ye body, in strengthening it with diverse
exercitations, gestings, and vociferations, in commanding the^ that keep him,
to such things as these be: That is to say, in manner of living, by
diminishing or augmenting, by degrees, in beginning, and vomiting, made by
Raphanus. You shall also use white Eliber, and all other things which we use
in diseases that be difficult to take away, which are subject to reason and
manner of living. This is the saying of Thessalus.

Now it is time to consider the stupiditie of the man, (I say the stupiditie)
if he think he has said well, and the boldness of him culpable to say
nothing, and by this means supposes to deceive the Readers. But tell me
Thessalus, what is the Indication curatiue that is taken of an old Ulcer?
Truly I never found out curation of the old Ulcers, nor of the new, not by
time, in what disease so ever it be, but of the affect that I purposed to
cure. But if we altogether regard time, as if the Indication curatiue were
taken of it, the second day we should give an other indication than the third,
and likewise to give the fourth day another, then the fifth, and so of the
sixth, and all other days following.

For by this means we shall no more consider the affect of the disease that we
go about to cure, and the Indication no more to be taken of them, whereby we
could never think of a stranger reason: how then are the communities of
ulcers necessary, that continue a great while, seeing that the time it self
can indicate nothing at all. For when an Ulcer is with erosion that comes of
all humors, we shall not take an Indication of it after four ^neths, but that
which we have taken at the very beginning.

And for a truth, that I may not permit such an ulcer to abide so long time,
but at the first I will take away the cause thereof. But I cannot conjecture
what may show the time more than the number of days, except Thessalus will
say, that to have knowledge of such an ulcer, we must tarry the time, but in
such a case he shows himself altogether foolish. That is to say, if he
confess openly that he knows not the first affect, which has inueterated
the ulcer. Furthermore, he must plainly also confess the Indication curatiue
to be taken of the disease, and the knowledge of the disease to be taken of
other things. But be it so, that time serves somewhat to the disease,
nevertheless the Indication curatiue is not taken of time. But to what purpose
serves it, if any Ulcer be inueterate, to do away yt which lets the
coition, and to renew the place which is pained. For thou foolish fellow, if
for the malign flux which the Greeks call Cachoethae, the lips be affected
in such sort, what shall thou profit if thou do cut them, before thou have
provided to stop the flux? Truly thou shall but make the Ulcer wider than it
is, as some do that cure ulcers after the same manner as thou do. For the
cause remaining, which before made the ulcer hard and flintie, thou shall do
no other thing in cutting away the lips, but enlarge the ulcer. For those
which thou cuttest shall be made hard, and come again as they were before.
Although that prudent Thessalus has not added this thing, that the parts of
the ulcer which are hard, stony, and discouloured, ought to be cut away, but
commands by an absolute sentence, that those things which hinder the closing
of the ulcer, ought to be cut away and to be renewed. But if truly he had
counseled to take away the causes that hinder the adglutination of the ulcer,
and that this reason were ancient and old, I would not accuse him, for it is
commanded almost of all the ancient Physicians, which do write of the
curation of ulcers, by a certain reason and Method, that those causes which
do excite the ulcers ought to be cut away, even truly, as of all other
diseases.

For truly I do think it expedient, yt the efficient cause remaining, which
exciteth the ulcers, ought first to be taken away. In other diseases, it is
not expedient, but chiefly there the curation must be taken in hand, where the
efficient cause remains. And if the said Thessalus has not spoken of the
causes that let the conglutination, and has only spoken of the lips (as he
has said afterward) it appears that he is ignorant of more than he knows,
of those things which appertains to the curation of ulcers. But it is
possible that this alone is the cause which hinders the cure of the ulcer.
And it may (as it is aforesaid) be the cause that intemperauncie, which is
without a tumor against nature, be in the vlcerate parts, and also that it be
joined with a tomour, the which does not require that the lips should be
altogether cut away. It may also be the cause that Varix, which is above it,
or that the milt which augmenteth it, or some disease in the liver, and beside
this, the weakness of the affected part be nothing else, but a manifest
intemperancie.

And besides this, a vicious humor in the body, which the Greeks call
Cacochimia, and the chiefest of all the causes which may be to the ulcers an
incommoditie. Truly great abundance of humors, which the Greeks call
Phlethora, resorting unto the ulcer, does hinder the curation. But if
Thessalus be of that opinion, that the lips only must be taken away, I
say, that of many things he knows but one alone, which is so evident, that
the shepherds are not ignorant thereof, for if a shepherd saw the lips of an
ulcer, hard, flintie, wan, black, or a leadie color, he would not doubt to
cut it away.

Then for to cut away is an easy thing, but for to cure by medicines is a
greater matter, and that requires a true method. Nevertheless Thessalus
never knew how the lips might be cured by medicines, for all men confess that
he has swarued from this part of the art, and as he himself has showed, it
seems that he had neither experience nor rational knowledge of medicines,
which is a manifest thing by the book that he has made of medicines, before
rehearsed. But of this one work consequent, we shall entreat of those things
which he has not writ^n well.

And now we do intend with deliberation to speak of the curation of
inueterate ulcers, of the which he has before entreated. Certainly it had
been better to have called them Cachoethae, and not inueterate, and the^ to
declare their nature, disposition, and cause of their generation, and the
curation of either of them.

And first to know the common curation of all ulcers, for as much as they be
ulcers, of the which I have written in the third book, next after the
particular and proper cure of either of them, afterward the kind of the
efficient cause, as I have spoken of in this present book. And although
Thessalus has done nothing of all these things, yet he does think that the
vlcerate place must be renewed, when it is made like unto a new wound, to cure
it as a bloody ulcer, what is he that is exercised in the works of the Art,
that understands not evidently, that such a doctrine has been written by
him that never cured ulcer? Is it possible that a man may cure an inueterate
ulcer, as you may cure a bloody wound, and after he has made it like unto a
fresh wound, shall it be in drawing of the ulcer together by rollers? or
joining them by stitches? or neither by the one or by the other? but by
convenient medicines? What is he that knows not, that an ulcer called
Cachoethae is caued or hollow, seeing that it is made by corrosion? Is it
possible (O fool and impudent Thessalus) that a caued ulcer may grow together,
and be adglutinated, before the cauitie be filled with flesh? is not that to
cure an ulcer as a green wound? then have thou thy self written in vain,
that has taken indication to cure caued ulcers, not with closing, but with the
filling of ye cauitie. But if every ulcer called Cachoethae were not hollow of
it self, yet when it is made bloody in cutting the lips away (as thou
commaundest) then of necessity it is made hollow, and requires great space
betwixt the lips: even in such manner that I cannot see how thou may make
them conglutinate together as a bloody wound: for if thou assaie by force and
violence the lips that are so far a sonder, of necessity there comes
Phlegmon, which lets the said lyppes to close together. The which thing I
suppose, that Thessalus understands not. For he says after these words. If
the ulcer be not bound, thou must mittigate the inflammation, for it is
necessary that they be not bound, but because that the same is given of
Thessalus, and that we pass over so soon without any curious examination, it
is evident to every one that he follows not the community which he himself
has given. For if we take that which lets, we shall take nothing of the
community of inueterate ulcers, for as much as they be such. But put we the
case that it be so, and let us try what follows. Thessalus writes in this
manner.

The ulcer that comes to a ciccatrice shall be cured, in the excess, an ulcer
in such a manner shall be cured as they that have been lately grieved with
inflammation. Then after, he says, you must cause the redness to come to the
parts that are about it, by a plaster that he called reuolatiue, which is made
of mustrad seed. What say thou mad fool? if thy flux be bitter and hot,
must the place be made red with mustardseede, even in such sort, that all the
part shall receive flux by the same medicine; that is to say, that it be all
vlcerate and red? For the old writers made the parts that were weakened with
abundaunce of cold humors, hot again with warming of them, and making of them
red, but thou use rubification in all ulcers, yea and that without making of
any difference. And thus if the ulcer be not cured either by the weakness of
ye part, or by the making of the flux greater, the^ thou turnest to another
manner of curing. For after that thou have inflamed the part with Musterd seed,
and have profited nothing, then thou turnest again to the curation of all the
body. Yet as I suppose in my judgment, all the countries be ordered and
established, in such things, as well by reason, as by experience, that they
know, that all the body should be first purged of those superfluities, before
they do minister any hot or sharp medicines unto ye grieved part. For all those
medicines that be hot, draw unto them from all parts of the body, like unto
Ventosis or boxes, and if you do not first purge the body, thou shall leave
mattier to flow unto ye weak place, that may be drawn by the sharp medicine,
which thing both the Emperikes and also the Dogmatists confess, and also the
ancient writers have esteemed it so. For in as much as Thessalus has made
mention of them, it shall be no strange thing to allege to them as
witnesses, that it is not lawful to cure the eye well, before all the rest of
the head, neither the head before the rest of the body. Such was the sentence
of Aristotle and Plato, in the cure of diseases: likewise of Hyppocrates,
Diocles, Praxagoras, and Plistonichus, but Thessalus opinion is not so, but
comes first to the composition of Mustarseed, and then he has sollicitated
and troubled all to body, without showing of any thing wisely.

For when as it is lawful first to purge all the body, and then forthwith to
feed it with wholesome meats, then Thessalus comes, and uses for these
things, vociferations, exercitations, gestings, and change of living, by
certain circuites and acts, then he comes to the vomit made with Raphanus,
and for the whole conclusion, he does minister Eliber. Truly he himself does
promise to heal all diseases, even after this sort, very easily, but I
cannot understand how that any has been cured after this manner, either in
long space of time, or by vnprofible labor.

Now then like as we have seen by use and experience, put we the case that
there be one to be cured of a malign Ulcer called Cachoethae, put we the case
also, that there is an other that is in good health, except a scratch of his
arm, or of, any other place, by mean^ whereof there is an ulcer or a pustle,
then within a little while after there comes an itch to the party, and after
the pustule is breken, there comes a disclosed ulcer, with unequal fretting,
and that such things be come in four days.

To this purpose let any of Thessalus sect answer me in what manner we should
cure such an ulcer, I call it altogether Cachoethae, and therefore I will
consider what is the disposition and affect of all the whole body. For I will
first find out of what kind of humor this does come, as well by the
Symptomata of the ulcer, as by the signs of the body, then forsooth I will
purge the said superfluous humor without tarrying any longer, least the
patient get any disease stubburne or disobedient to be cured. But the sect of
Thessalus, that observe his precepts, will tarry until the ulcer be old,
because it may return to the wondrous and marvelous community of inueterate
ulcers, as if it were not much better to give the community of froward ulcers,
I do not mean those that be veterate, shall make manifest the curation.

Afterward the said Thessalions would do one of both these, either they would
cut the ulcer, and make it as it were fresh, and so bring the parts to
adglutination, or else they would first use the Malagma that is made of
mustard-seede, and if neither of these profit, they will have their refuge to
the vociferations, gestations, and other exercitations, and also to the manner
of living that changes by circuities, and after they will move vomit by
Raphanus, and if the ulcer be not cured by such things, then they minister
Eliber, and if the Eliber do nothing profit, they send the patient into Libia
for change of air. Thessalus ought to have added this word, after this
excellent and singular curation of rebellious ulcers.

For of a truth the Thessalians stand in vociferations, gestations, and other
like things, as if they should cure the evil habitude of the body, (which the
Greeks call Cacexia) and not the vice of the humor (that the Greeks call
Cachochimia.) Is it not marvel if they confess that they know not the ulcer
Cachoethae, as soon as it is made, and that they will tarry till it be old,
and that often they use ciccatrise, and open again many times ere they
understand what they do, and how they counsel those that have the feauers to
pass the fit, which shall come the third day, or not, they truly have very
well known the contemplation of the crise, and can foresee by it the chief
increasing of the disease. But what chances thereof most often? truly it
follows, that the pacients abide in their beds, and consume through their
default, which might have been cured the second day. Of a truth we have not
only seen this chance, once, twice, or thrice, but vi. C. times, and when
the first fit was past, we washed the sick persons that had the fever, which
thing we have seen done of our predecessors and masters. And consequently we
have suffered them to live without fear in their manner accustomed, as they ye
should no more have the fever, whom wise Thessalus, which invented the first
diet, that is to say, not to eat in three days, has dried and consumed only
through hunger. Then as I conjecture, he would feed them a little on ye fourth
day, and so nourish them by little and little, in such wise, that they ye had
but once the fever, should skant go about their customable business.

Truly he consumed his pacients always in their diseases, the which truly very
easily might have been cured.

For when an ulcer did swell at the beginning, Thessalus did suffer it to run
a year and more, and tarried often so long till the said ulcer oftentimes
produced cicatrice, when as before it might in few days have been cured, and
also he would often open it, to see if it were malign and stubborn to cure.
Then after that he began the curation, he purged not forthwith ye body, but
first of all used his Malagma of Musterdseede, and then his gestes,
vociferations, and certain manners of living, and then his vomit of Raphanus,
and last of all Eliber.

What is this I pray you then for to linger a whole year? (Now by the living
God) it were a great madness if we should prolong a month to know if the
ulcer be malign, and then take in hand the curation, when as the pacient in
vi. or vii. days, at the uttermost, may be cured. But what necessity was it
to speak of the community of ulcers inueterate, seeing that nothing may
profit the curatio^ thereof? Truly it were good leaving the co^munitie
Indicatrice, to write of ye curation of ulcers, I do not mean inueterate, but
such as be stuburne and rebellious in cure. For sometime it happens that
ulcers and diseases be co^tumatious and stubburne to cure. How be it Indication
curatiue is not taken of this contumacie and rebellion, but it is the disease
that gives the first indication of curing. And of the first indicatio^, the
remedies, as I have declared, are found out. For the way to cure by method, is
ye which we use, in following the ancient writers, if so be that method is a
universal way, which is common to all particular things.

Herein Thessalus truly is beguiled, for he thinks that all the knowledge of
them, which do any thing by method, is very method, which is not so. For it
behooves that he which does any thing by method, have notice and knowledge in
the like and unlike. Nevertheless the knowledge of like and unlike is not
method: for neither Aristotle, nor yet Plato, affirms that which Thessalus
dare falsely allege. But now it is not convenient to prove and confute such
matters: wherefore I will return again to the Method curatiue, and truly I
will show unto you the principle of method in all curations, and also I will
declare unto you how ye way in all particular things is like, which leads
from that principle to the end. Wherefore, although in all diseases there
seems a proper method of curing, nevertheless there is in all things one
common gender, for it behooves to begin always at the indication of the
disease, which we take in hand to cure, and then we must way and consider, if
the cause which excited the disease, be already ceased, or augmenteth the same
disease. If the said cause be eased, then we must come to the method, whereof
we have here declared: by the which method thou shall learn the remedies of
an inflammation, and of a Fever, and also how I will shortly entreat of the
curation of all diseases. For if nothing be done, thou shall not take pain to
enquire the precedent causes, but shall begin only at the disease. But if any
thing be done presently, thou shall take two indications of curation.

Now I cannot but marvel at the sect of Thessalus, not because they miss in
such things: but because they use these names, Dispathies, Metasincrisis,
imbecillities, firmitudes, and other such names. And if you ask the^ what such
names mean, they wot not what to answer. Also if you ask what that
signifies, which they call in all inueterate ulcers, in Greek Metasuncrinem
ten texin, they answer neither prudently, nor yet with consideration. If so be
that it were an ancient name usurped by any of the greeks, peradventure by
these things we may understand what things they have written, and for what
intent they have spoken the same. But because it is a point of their
folishnesse, and impudency, to say that it is come of the Hipothese of
Asclepiades, like as their other decrees, therefore it were a thing most
convenient that they interpret their own dreams. From whence there is a
notable saying among the Greeks: Sincrinestai, Ta somata, cai Thiacrinestai,
which means thus, mingle and divide bodies, as though it were lawful to
usurp such little bodies, which they call Atones, and pores, passages
indiuidable and vacuate, or finally the insensible and inalterable things to be
the first elements, even as they truly do daily usurp. Furthermore,
Thessalus in his canon, when he confirms the principles, adds something
beside that, which was written by Themison, and Asclepiades, and as far as he
understands, he writes not obscurely, but he has not imitated Asclepiades,
altogether in Simitry: that is to say, that health consists in compete^t and
comoderation of small cundites or passages, and that curation is no other
thing, but a return to the first simitrie, or comoderatio^ of the said
cundits. But Thessalus supposes yt all the state and condition of ye said
cundits must be changed, and by this opinion does proceed the name of
Metasincrisis, which may signify in effect Metaporopoieseseos in greek, yt is
mutatio^ of the state of small cu^dits and pores, but it did not become him to
use ye names of dogmatists in place where he commands to eschew the
uncertain and dark names.

Then his disciples answers, yt he must not be hard as a dogmatist, when he
uses this name Aphelos in greek, that is to say simply. For of a truth, some
of his disciples are accustomed to defend him in this manner, in reuocing us to
another name that is Aphelian, which we translate simpleness, the which name
truly I cannot tell what it signifies. For if he send us again to another
name more foolish, which the Greeks call Vioticos, the which as they expound
does signify likewise so unto the common people: truly it were as good to
say, Aphelos not exactly or well, but without Art or knowledge, for they which
be of speech most lightest, use names of arts, under some sense, that has no
foundation, and when they are demanded what they mean, they know not. The
which thing those Thessalians confess to be their manner and custom, when we
do object any thing against them. And for a truth, they will also confess,
that they understand not perfectly, what Metacincrisis is, if it be spoken of
the mutation of the small cundits, which the Greeks call Poropoia, in deed it
should have some understanding, but yet many ways frivolous and foolish. For
our bodies do not consist of little bodies called Atoms, and of little
passages, or pores: but if this were true, it should not be possible to show
in what manner, musterd might change or alter the state of the same pores, and
if any of them should show the truth, yet we would not agree unto their sect,
because they promise yt they will be content with their apparent communities:
therefore let them not use these names, neither let them hinder us no more in
our matters. For it is lawful without the name Metasincrisis, to say in other
words the curation of inueterate ulcers, as the Emperickes do.

Also we have declared in ye second book, how they talk of this word
Atonias, that is to say, imbecilitie, and yet know not what it means. For if
they use this name as the Emperickes do, then it should signify nothing else
but that the actions are not kept: for if they say that certain faculties, do
govern living creatures, which we and all the ancient writers do affirm,
but yet notwithstanding they repugne against the precepts of Asclepiades, and
also they propound uncertain things, to the which the authors do not agree:
they touch the truth a little, yet they command to eschew it.

But tell me true Thessalus, what means this word Metasincrisis? if thou
say that it betokens to change the pores, thou art deceived, and supposest
uncertain things. But if thou say that it is a great matter to cure the
particle grieved of the body, as the man, thou say no more tha^ the
Emperikes, except the name. For they do know that men are made whole by
medicines, but they know not the cause or reason, by what means the remedies
restores health. For none of the Emperikes can tell, if the faculty of the
medicaments changes the pores, or if it makes a Simitrie, or if it alters
the quality of the Patients particle that is grieved. Howbeit the Emperikes
are discreet men, if they say that they know only one thing, that is to
say, if they have noted and observed the times, how utility has followed,
when the medicament of mustard has been ministered to such ulcers, and in what
time. Nevertheless they speak not of method, neither yet repugne against it,
neither be displeased with the notise thereof, nor dispraise the ancient
writers, neither Hyppocrates, but rather praise him, and affirm that he has
said all things well. But Thessalus does not only despise Hyppocrates, but
all ye other ancient Physicians, neither does he understand yt he has written
all the precepts of rebellious ulcers, without reason, emperiklie. For if he
had written them well, then it should have been counted a work most
profitable. But it appears not yt he has done so, seeing that he peruerteth
ye right order of remedies, and uses his remedies to the grieved part, before
he has prepared the body. For this is an argument of great ignorance, seeing
yt almost it is a principle in Chirurgerie, that all the body must be purged
of the evil excrementes, before any strong medicine be applied unto the
affected part. For who is he yt will judge either by reason or experience, for
there is no other third thing to judge by, in what art so ever it be, nor in
any part of life, he shall find yt it is agreeable to reason, for a man to
minister strong and hot medicines to any particle of the body, before he has
purged the body of all anoiance, and prepared ye same to health: for the said
medicine draws the excrements and superfluities from all the body, like as
boxing or Ventosis does, and it does so fasten to the affected part, that it
may be scarcely removed. Therefore it must be asked of these Thessalions, from
whence this opinion comes to Thessalus, to write fables as concerning ye
curatio^ of rebellious ulcers, seeing that none of the Emperiks, nor yet
Rationals, have written so before this time. For neither Thessalus himself,
neither any other of his sect, dare affirm, that the order of such remedies,
either does agree with experience or reason. For neither can they give
Indication of time, neither yet of the affect of the disease. Yet for all that,
Thessalus is not all together ignorant, because he judges, that the cause ye
hinders the ciccatrise must be considered and taken away, and because also
that he judges, that this must be done not only in ulcers, but also in all
other diseases, (as the ancient writers do admonish.) But they answer nothing
to the purpose, for they say always, that we do not understand them, as if
they knew perfectly the thought of Hyppocrates, and of all the ancients. And
they affirm ye Thessalus has a good opinion, when he says, that there is a
community of inueterate ulcers, and that Hyppocrates understood it so, in his
book of Ulcers, which writes in this manner. It is profitable that the blood
do flow continually from the inueterate ulcer, when so ever it seems
needful. It were not far from my purpose, if I should speak of the judgment
and opinion of Hyppocrates, though I have not promised yt I would so do in this
place. But that which I will say, shall be of the interpretation of the wit
and knowledge of the ancient Physicians, the which truly as yet have given
no sect, but studying with simple and pure mind, to invent some thing
profitable to man's health. It is well perceived therefore, that they have found
some thing by reason, and some thing by use and experience. Then did they write
their inventions, many times without giving reason thereto, and sometime they
did, and if they did give any reason, it was to profit the readers. For if
they intended to be profitable to their successors, and when as they knew
reason of inue^ting things, then diligently they set it forth, and where they
thought it obscure, they thought it superfluous to rehearse, and therefore let
it pass. Now it is well known unto all men, though I hold my peace, that the
ancients have loved no verbositie. For that cause before recited, not only
Hippocrates, but also all ye other ancient Physicians, sometime not making
mention of the middlemost, speaks of the third thing. For if the first be a
sign of the second, the third of necessity must follow after the second,

And thus oftentimes omitting the first and second, they spoke of the third. I
have oftentimes declared how the ancients, and chiefly Hyppocrates, have
written after this manner. But he that will know and perfectly understand the
manner of curing, ought to be exercised in their style and manner of
interpreting. For this I will entreat of yt which I have purposed.

The fifth Chapter.
FOr those Ulcers, which (after medicines to them ministered) be not cured,
those the Physicians call in Greek Cachoethae, but we call them malign and
rebellious to cure. But we have spoken in the book aforesaid, what the
curation of ulcers is. Therefore in these kinds of ulcers that be malign, we
may use these names indifferently, that is to say, we call them Cachoethae,
inueterate, or Diuturnus. In like manner the affect of the disease called
Cachoethae, that is to say, stubburne and rebellious to be cured, that makes
some thing for our purpose to know, nevertheless the said diuturnitie of the
said ulcers, because they come again, or be of long continuance, and wax
old, have no convenient indication of curing, but that must he considered,
because the vlcerate part is ill affected, that ill affect being once known,
the cure is manifest.

But thou will ask, how can this be done? truly if thou will heal the
vlcerate part affected, thou must first take away the abundance and corrupt
vicious humors from all the body: for in cleansing away the same, the
diuturnitie is taken away, but the finding out, which is profitable to us,
comes not first of the diuturnitie, but of the ill disposition and malignitie
of the humor, by means whereof these three things following, must chiefly be
considered, that is, the sign, the affect, and curation. The sign is the
diuturnitie or continuance of the ulcer, the affect, is the vicious humors
repairing to the ulcer, and the curation is the taking away of the said
humors. By this means you shall find that the ancient Physicians many
times after the first, made mention of the third, leaving the middlemost, as
Hyppocrates did, when he said, it is vtill to cause the blood to flow out
often of inueterate ulcers. But it is inutill, that the indication curatiue
should be taken of the diuturnitie of the ulcer, but of the ill disposition of
the blood. For a little after he says thus: the vice and evil blood hinders
greatly the cure of the said ulcers. Also putrefaction of the blood, and all
things that comes by transmutation of the blood, lets also the curation of
the said ulcers. And afterward he speaks of ulcers that come not to a
cicatrise: The ulcers truly (says he) may not be closed together, if the lips
and parts that are round about, be swart or black, with rotten blood or
Varises that causes the flux, if you cure not the said parts that be about
it, they will not come together. And afterward he writes of the cure of
Varises, and then makes mention of the purging of all the body, as well in
wounds as in Ulcers, where fear of danger or putrefaction, in Greek called
Sphaselos, does remain, and besides in Ulcers called Herpes and Esthioninus,
that is to say, which do erode and eat the skin. And thus Hyppocrates is
wont to call those ulcers, after this sort, wherein any ill humor does cause
erosin. And thus when he speaks of them that ensues, he says in such
words: In every Ulcer whereas chances Erisipelas, all the body must be
purged. And finally, if you read diligently the book of ulcers, you shall
find that he takes Indication always of ye affect of the disease, and if he
have any consideration of time, it is only to know the affect. And that it
is so, you may know it in the beginning of the said book, which concludes
thus: You may not minister any moist thing to Ulcers, what ulcers so ever they
be, but wine. Then shows he the cause, (and says,) Dry ulcers are nearest
to health, and moist the contrary, then after he says, it is an ulcer for
that it is moist, but if it be dry, it is whole. Therefore in all his cure, in
as much as he has constituted the end of all the cure of ulcers to be dryness,
it ought to be considered. Then he finds out the particular things,
admonishing us many times of the same end, writing in this manner: Every
wound that is divided with a cutting Instrument, receives medicines in the
beginning that ought to be applied to raw and bloody wounds, the which
Medicamentes in Greek is called Enaimon, which is, drying, and lets the
wound to come to suppuration, for it is more drier by the reason of the blood
which flows out of it. And again Hyppocrates says, All ulcers that are well
purged, they come sooner to dryness and ciccatrize, but if any superfluous
flesh do grow, it is by the reason of some contusion. And again he says, if
that any of the wound cannot consode together, the moistness is the cause
thereof. In all these sayings, Hyppocrates admonishes us of the first
Indication curatiue of all Ulcers: for of a truth, the curation of an Ulcer,
for as much as it is an ulcer, is moderate dryness, whereof the demonstration
has been given in the book going before.

For the curation of an ulcer that is coniunct with another affect, whereof the
cure ought to proceed, is not like to a simple ulcer, for the first curation
of such a one as is coniunct with any other affect, shall begin first of the
same affect, and then at the ulcer. For if there be either Phlegmon or swart
color, or Ecchymosis, or Erysipilas, or Oedema, in the vlcerate part, first
you must begin the curation, at one of the said affectes. Nevertheless all
men know well, that sometimes these Ulcers are not well cured, but are made
greater, for that the parts round about the Ulcer, is affected either with
Phlegmon, either by brusing, either with some other tumor, which should have been first taken away, before you had proceeded to the cure of the ulcer. And
for a certainty, it is not possible to heal the ulcer, if the place where
these be, be not first cured. And therefore Hyppocrates puts us in memory
of those things which he has spoken of in the beginning of his book, and also
of those things before especified, and of those that be present he writes thus.

Every wound that is divided with a cutting Instrument or sharp pointed,
receives Medicament called Enaemon, and also a medicament desiccatiue, that
may let the filthy mattier. But if the flesh be contused or cut with a blunt
weapon, remedy must be given in such wise, that it come soon to suppuratio^.
For in so doing, it shall be the less molested and grieved with Phlegmon. And
also it is necessary that the putrified flesh, which has been contused and
incised, come first to suppuration, and afterward new flesh to be engendered.
By these words Hyppocrates shows manifestly, that all the affects of the
vlcerate parts ought to be desiccated, except those where Pus will sodainelye
breed. And so he going forward, says, that Pus comes through some
putrefaction. Furthermore, that all putrefaction comes through moistures and
heat, and therefore the Cataplasmes made of Barlie meal (seeing that they are
hot and moist) we will minister it to all diseases, where it is expedient to
engender Pus, for the Barlie meal with water and oil, and likewise bread with
oil, or a fomentation of much hot water, or ye Malagma, called Tetrapharmice,
and to conclude, all things that moist and heat, engender Pus. And if in the
parts where Phlegmon is, there arises pulsation, in such wise, that there is
no hope of the curation of the said parts, without Pus or suppuration, all the
ancients truly apply the said medicines, and not before. The which things
Hyppocrates shows plainly in the words before rehearsed, whereby he
commands to use dry medicines to the wounded parts, where there is
contusion, but they that be with contusion, must be quickly brought to
suppuration.

Moreover, when he says, that all ulcers which be not well mundified, and begin
again to increase, in them there grows supercrescent flesh, but those that
are mundified as they ought to be, comes soon to ciccatrize, for in the^
there grows no superfluous flesh, except there be contusion. Of a truth, when
he speaks of contusion, he calls to mind that which he has said before.
That is, all ulcers require dry medicines, except those be contused. For if
you do apply to the parts where as Phlegmon is, a Cataplasma that is hot and
moist, it is not done by the first and principal reason, yt is as a remedy to
the affected part, but to mittigate the accidents. For the remedies of Phlegmon
are of desiccatiue virtue. Hearken now what Hyppocrates says: the Cataplasmes
for Oedema and Phlegmon, ought to be made of Verbescum sodden, the leaves of
Trifolium, and the leaves of Piretron and Polium sodden. All these medicaments
have virtue desiccatiue, as we have made mention in the book of simple
Medicaments.

And to be short, the curation of the parts where Phlegmon is, is done by kind
of these remedies, which does remove altogether the affects. And if the said
remedies have left any thing remaining that will come to suppuration, it is
needful than to have another medicine which is more strong, to make it sooner
to come to suppuration, or if ye skin that be about be thin, and that thou will
that the Patient shall be sooner eased, you must make incision. The taking
away of Phlegmon, is by mittigation of Barlie meal, and not curation, for
that fights only against the disease, but of these differences we will
speak hereafter at large.

Now I think we have manifestly showed, how that Hyppocrates has commanded
that all ulcers shall be desiccated, and that he has confirmed it to be the
proper end of curation. But now in as much as the indication is taken of the
affect, and not of time. If any desire to have greater persuasion, let him
diligently read all the Books of Hyppoorates, that he has written of
Ulcers, for he shall perfectly understand, that there is one Indication
general of all Ulcers, which we have showed in the book precedent, and there
is no Indication to be taken of time, but of the affectes of the ulcers, as
Phlegmon, and other such like accidences, as before is especified. And seeing
now we are come to the place to speak, it is a thing most true, that
Hyppocrates has been the inuenter, not only of that which we have said
before, but also of all other things that are to be known, to him that will
cure an ulcer well. It appears truly that he has invented the reason and
the manner to cure simple ulcers, and also the kinds of the affects which
consist in dryness. For either the ill humors resort unto the grieved part,
or else they resort no more unto it. If they come no more, then it is requisite
to help and succor the grieved part, that is, if it be pale, black, or red,
it must be scarified, that the evil blood may come forth, then afterward
because that I may use his words, you must lay thereon a Sponge more dry than
moist. For I do think, that there is no person so ignorant, but will think
yt a dry sponge ought rather to be applied than a moist, and also to use
desiccatiue medicines. And then if it be requisite for to draw blood again,
do as you have done before, until the time that health be altogether
recovered. And if the lips of the ulcer appear hard and stony, they must be
cut away, the which thing is spoken here.

But if the ulcer that is round, be somewhat hollow, you must cut it according
to the roundnesse which is swollen, which swelling the Greeks call Apostema,
either all the roundnesse, or as much as necessity requires, according to the
length of the member. Also it is written of all Tumors against nature, that are
joined with an ulcer, how they ought to be cured. Likewise of the Varises, for
they be the occasion that the ulcers be so stubburne, and hard to be cured, if
that any humor of the said Varises do repair unto the ulcer. And in like
manner when the flux of an humor comes from all the body, he commands
that all the body shall be purged, without taking any indication of time.
Truly it were a ridiculous thing that so many and contrary Indications should
be taken of one community. For put we the case, indications to be taken of
time. But if we grant that time gives a certain indication, it is necessary
to ask what indication it gives, and comprise it in a sum, as Thessalians
does, which takes indication of a body that is bound, that that may be
unloosed again, and that body that has a lax, is to be stopped. Likewise in
ulcers that are filthy, mundification is to be required, and those that be
holow, to be filled with flesh, and those that be equal to be ciccatrized, and
that which has superfluous flesh, to be taken away. Thessalus himself is
author of these: but now let him show that there is any indication proportioned
to the time of the ulcer, as there is in all these that we have rehearsed,
which is not possible for him: for he bids that they should be cut, and a
Malagma, made of Mustardseede to be applied unto it.

I pray you what reasonable indication has he taken now of time, which takes
and usurps this vain word Metasincrisis, and after that he provoke vomit
by Raphanus, and then when he finds no other remedy, he uses Eliber, and
when these nothing profit, he sends the pacient like a wise Physician into
Libia, for change of air, the which things shall be more plainly spoken of
hereafter, when we shall show that indication in what disease so ever it be,
shall be taken of time. Yet for all yt it shall be good to know the diuturnitie
of the disease.

The sixth Chapter.
But I will return to Hyppocrates, whom I do greatly maruail at, not only
for his diligence, but also for all other things, and chiefly for that he has
not forgotten that which is to be considered of all Physicians as touching the
indications of all diseases. That is to say, the indicatio^ which is taken of
the greatness and magnitude of the affect, which not only the Methodicians
have permitted (this is to be maruailed at) but also many of the Rationales,
yea, and of the Emperickes, although it be after another sort. For when they
say that they have considered the euacuation in the course of the blood, they
confess then manifestly, that they have no regard of other things that
appear in the affected part, for to come to such euacuation. But I do not say
thus, that purgation is euacuation, the which is no indication of the course of
ye blood, but for because we must sometime have consideration to the letting
forth of blood, although there be no course of blood present, which may flow to
ye grieved part: for when the disease is very strong, there is none which
understands the art of medicine, but will let blood. And truly the
Emperickes themselves, let blood when any is fallen from an high place, or when
there is any part sore bruised and hurt with any wound, though the pacient were
whole and sound before, and without superfluity of blood. By the which it
appears, that it is not the flowing of the blood to the affected part, which
gives indication, but the magnitude and veheme^cie of the disease and the
force of ye stre^gthes, excepting yet from our talk, children. As for example.
If a man be whole and sound, and without any manner of hurt, and having
abundance of blood, it is not necessary because of his abundance to take his
blood from him. For there is no indication to be taken of the blood, for
because the man is whole, for to such men fasting does profit, and small
eating, and sometime Purgation or bathing and Frications may suffice. Letting
of blood is not necessary to such, as ye Emperickes say.

Likewise Purgation is not good in the only abundance of humors, for even as
letting of blood is done either for abundance of blood or for the magnitude of
the disease, so is purgation given either for the abundaunce of ill humors or
for the force of the disease. As touching letting of blood we have spoken of in
another book, and shall do again hereafter. But in this present book I will
speak of purgatio^s, for they that be diseased, require them, not only
because it does euacuate the noisome and superfluous humors with the which the
body is grieved, but also puts forth and cleanses the excrements within
the body.

And for this cause Hyppocates as well in his other works as in that he has
written of Ulcers, considers the vehemency and strength of the disease,
whereof he takes Indication of purging, and says thus.

Purgations of the belly is profitable to many Ulcers, and also to wounds of
the head, of the belly, and of the joints, and where there is danger of the
rottenness of the bones, or where stitching behooves in wounds, or where
erosions be, or where Herpis and other affects be, which hinders the
curation of Ulcers, and also where rolling must be used.

By these words it is apparent truly, that Purgations are profitable both to
wounds and Ulcers, at all times when they be great and grievous. For not only
the said affects, but other be made great and grievous, three manner of ways,
that is, either through the excellency of the afflicted part, either else
through the greatness of the affect, or else because the said affects are
Cacoethae (that is to say, hard to be cured.)

Hyppocrates has made mention of all these things perticularlie, when he did
entreat of wounds of the head and belly, and of the excellency and dignity
of hurt parts. I think it is manifest to all men, that he must be
understood, not only the lower belly, but also the superior, for in
dividing the Trunk of man's body, which is betwixt the neck and the legs,
is two great capacities.

The first is contained under the Thorax, and above Diaphragma, and the second
under Diaphragma, unto Os Pubi, or to Peritoneum, which covers the inward
part of the belly. And for certain, those wounds which has pierced within
the Thorax or within Peritoneum, is very dangerous, chiefelie if any of the
inward parts be wounded. Likewise there are very few, but they do know that
the wounds of the joints are Cachoethae, and are hard to be cured: Which
things the Emperikes understand only by experience, and they that have
studied, and have attained to the knowledge of man's body, understand these
things by the nature of the hurt part. For in tendonie and sinnowie parts,
where bones are void of flesh, there is great danger of pain, waking, and
privation of rest, and also of conuulsion. Such wounds as these be, and such
as be stitched, that is to say, those that are so great that they need
stitching, or at the lest, of binding or rolling, requires purgation.

We have declared in the last book, that all the greater wounds ought to be
joined together, either by stitching or by binding. Likewise the ulcers where
there is danger of corruption of the bones, are oftentimes joined with great
inflammations. Also they that proceed of ill humors, be Cachoethae, and with
erosion. Also Herpetes come of cholerike humors, and all other old ulcers
come of such like cause. Wherefore in all the ulcers before especified,
Hyppocrates commands to purge by the belly, and afterward he adds these
words. In all ulcers whereto Erisipel as is come, the body must be purged in
that part most profitable for the ulcer, so that the purgation be made either
by the upper parts or else by the lower, which difference he has set forth
in the book of Humors, where he commands to turn away the humor to the
contrary part. As for example. There is a great flux that comes to one part
of the body where there is an ulcer, it behooves to make another in the
contrary parts, and thereof he speaks in the said book.

Wherefore if there be as yet a great flux which does runue to the sore part,
we shall make reuulsion to the contrary part: that is to say, if the ulcer be
in the upper parts, by purging downward, and if it be in the nether parts, by
purging the upper ventricle. But if the flux be new stopped in such sort
that is fixed in the member, it is expedient to drive it out by the next
parts, seeing that the passages be the next places, seeing that the access
and attraction of purging medicines is more easy and prompt, to remove those
things that be near, rather than those things that be far of, the which
reason belongs to another part of the art, which entreats of purging
medicines, therefore hereafter it shall be declared and made perfect.

Now I will show the force, or if you will call it the magnitude of the
disease, to be appointed for a certain indication of taking away blood or
giving purgation. And also that Hippocrates, was the first inuenter of the said
indication, I will speak in the books following of diseases, and in this
book I will speak of ulcers. I have already spoken of Purgations. For seeing
that every disease is grievous three manner of ways, it is either for the
excellency and nobleness of the part, or for the magnitude of ye affect, or
for the frowardness of the same affect, called in Greek Cacoethia.
Hippocrates has made mention of all these things where he speaks of
Purgations. But some perchance will say, How then? does not Hippocrates,
council us to take away the blood for these causes above especified? By my
judgment he commands them thus, but in few words, and that not without
demonstration, as he and all the ancients were accustomed to do. Thou shall
understand that it is so, if that thou will read again his words, that are
these. In every fresh wound, except it be in the belly, it is expedient to let
blood flow out of it, more or less. For by that means the wound shall be
less grievous, the inflammation less, and all the places about it. But if thou
shall remember hereafter those words that he writ when he did entreat if
ulcers and also those things that he has propounded in all his other books,
that is to say, how that a Physician ought to be an imitator and follower, not
only of nature, but also of those things which shall be profitable, when they
come to their natural state. Then thou shall plainly understand the mind of
Hippocrates, and also how that blood ought to be drawn when wounds be great:
but if out of such wounds blood does not flow, especially when as it is a thing
most convenient, then thou must add and supply those things that be needful
and necessary. The matter that follows, he conioyneth it with that which is
abouesayde.

Also it is profitable that from inueterate ulcers, blood do flow, and also
from the parts which are about them.

But forasmuch as he has said before, that blood should flow from every green
wound, except that he made mention now of inueterate ulcers, it would seem to
some that he did entreat only of green and fresh wounds. Therefore he did
well add this, (that is to say) how that it is a thing most meet to draw
blood from inueterate ulcers.

Wherefore now seeing that the doctrine which we have taken of him is true and
firm: that is to say, how a flux beginning at the contrary parts, ought to be
drawn, and how that which is already fixed in the party, ought to be purged,
either from the payned part, or from the part next unto it: therefore it is now
easy for us to conclude of the detraction of blood, how that in the beginning
it ought to be done in the part far of, and then in the vlcerate parts.

Furthermore, if you do add unto these which I have before spoken, how that
Hippocrates, cou^selleth to euacuate the superfluous humor, and that
detraction of blood ought to be used when it surmounteth, and that a medicament
ought to be given, which has virtue to purge humors Chollerike,
Melancholicke, and Phlegmatike: Yet have in remembrance all these words, how
that none of them is the curation of ulcers, no not so much as of an ulcer, but
rather of Cacochimia, that is coniunct with the ulcer, or of Plethor, or of
Phlegmon, or of Herpis, or other like dispositions: Neither yet be not
forgetful of this thing, that is to say, that none of the accidents of the
ulcer gives such proper indication, as magnitude. In the book precedent, we
have entreated of ulcers, wherein we have declared all the differences of
ulcers, how many, and what they be, and what is the indication of either of
the^. Howbeit, I have not sppken in the said book, how the indication of
purging is taken of the vehemency of the disease, because it should not be to
much prolixitie and demonstration. Neither in the said book, I have connixed
the curation of all the body with the ulcers, but yet I have declared in this
present book, in as much as it was agreeable and vtill for my purpose.

The seventh Chapter.
But the firm and perfect demonstration of this kind of Indication, which is
taken of the vehemency of the disease, shall be showed hereafter. In like
manner, the indication which is taken of ye age, and that which is taken of
purging humors. Likewise the Indication which is taken of the afflicted parts,
shall be declared in the books which follow. But as yet we have only made
mention of the curatiue Indication that may be taken of the nature of the said
parts, that is to say, of temperance and substance. But truly we have nothing
touched the Indication, which is taken of the situation and figure of the
parts. Therefore we will speak of the indications that be profitable for the
curation of Ulcers. The part truly that has sharp and quick senses, ought
as much as is possible to be cured without dolor or pain. But the Anodinon of
such remedies is spoken of in the Book which entreats of the simple
medicaments.

But he that has but small senses, and those that be not quick, may (if the
disease require) suffer strong medicines. But we must have regard and
consideration to the strength of the principal member, whereof we will more
copiouslie hereafter declare, when as we shall have occasion to speak of
Phlegmon. But if it be not a principal member, surely without danger you may
minister unto it such medicines as mittigate and assuage, the Greeks call them
Calasticke, whereof we will plainly and more at large declare hereafter. At
this present we will declare the indication which is taken of the situation
and figure of the parts, and then we will finish and conclude this fourth
book. For this cause have we excogitated and invented certain medicines that
must be given to him that has his ventricle vlcerate, the which medicines must
be dronken at once, but to him that has his throat vlcerate, they must be
ministered at sundry times by little and little, because of the passing which
brings great utility to the ulcer, neither they must be ministered so, and in
such case, as to him that has his ventricle vlcerate.

Likewise we have declared by the situation and figure of the said part, that
such medicines ought to be made grosser and thick, and more clammy than the
other, because that the throat is a passage of things that is eaten and
dronken. And for that cause remedies which may conioyne and clean on every
side of it, is most convenient, and not such as are thin and easy to slide
away. For the thick are always about the parts, and the clammy do cleave
unto it. Likewise ulcers that are in the thick intestines, have more need of
medicines which are cast out by the fundament, in as much as they be next unto
it. But the ulcers that are in the thin intestines, because they be fardest
from the fundament, require both medicines, that is to say, those that are
receued by the mouth, and those that are cast in by the fundament. Now truly
the common indication of all the interior parts is, that we ought to choose
things that be most familiar to the nature of man, be they meats or
medicaments, and to eschew those things which be contrary unto it.

Although to Ulcers which be in the outward parts, the use of such
medicaments be not hurtful, as Aerugo, aes Vstum, aeris Squa^ma, Cadmia,
Pomphilix, Litarge and Cerussa. Yet they ought not to be ministered to the
ulcers of the inward parts, of whose nature we have written in the book of
temperaments, and in the book of simple medicines.

But if we go about to glutinate the ulcer, and bring it to a ciccatrise, we
must choose glutinatiue medicines, and such as will not cause erosion. But if
we will cleanse the ulcer, we must use things abstersive, and such as will
absterge it moderately, as raw Honey, which of al things for this purpose is
the chiefest.

But as touching adstingent potions called Austerae, and other such like
alimentes, they be known unto all men. This word Auster, is called Stiphos in
Greek, that is to say, little astringent, and that which is lower or bitter,
is called in Greek Striphnon. But the medicines which may be taken without
danger, are spoken of in the book of Medicaments. Nevertheless I will show
some form of wholesome Medicaments for the inward ulcers, which are these,
namely, Hipocystis, Balaustium, Cytini Punicorum, Galla, Malicorium, Terra
Samia, Lemnium Sigillum, Rosarum Succus, Acacia, and other or like kind, which
be profitable for inward ulcers, and you must minister the said medicaments
with some decoction of adstringent things, as of Quinces, Lentiske, or the tops
of Rubus, or of Vines, or green mirtills, or with adstringent Wine. It is now
manifest, and I think none is so ignorant, but will judge that he must eschew
drinking of wine if there be Phlegmon, or else there is no danger.

In like manner it is evident that the said Medicaments must be prepared and
received with decoction of moist things. Also you must mix gum Tragacanthen
in those medicines which are for the ulcers in Gula, you must use Gargarises in
the Ulcers that are in the parts called Fauces and Paristhmia, but if the
ulcer be in Aspera Arteria, called Trachia, then the Patient must be laid
upright, and keep the medicine long time in his mouth, in loosing all the
muscles that be in that place, for in so doing some part of medicament will
flow by little and little to the grieved part. For when the said Aspera
Arteria is in his natural state, or in good health, then we may easily know
when any potion passes through it. For like as we must take heed when as it
is in good health, least any flux fall that way which may hurt it: so in
like manner we must beware when it is grieved, least any thing do fall that
way which may provoke the cough: then it seems that the Indications of it
are taken of the situation and form of the part.

Also Honey must be mingled in all Medicaments which are ordained for the Ulcer
in the Thorax and Lungs. Therefore if we use astringent medicines, they will
remain in the belly. Then the instrument which is profitable for the
digestion and distribution of the said medicame^ts over all the body shall be
honey. Also it being mingled with the said medicines, shall be occasion of
their quick passage over the body, neither shall it any thing anoie or hurt
the ulcer. In like manner if there be an ulcer in the bladder and in the
raines, honey and such as provoke urine must be mingled with the said
medicines. But I think that it is apparent to all men, though they take not me
the author of the same, how that the vlcerate parts may be discerned or known
by their substance, action, utility, situation, and figure. The which things
truly have been amply declared in the book which entreats of the signs of
the affected parts, but now there is no time to talk of them, therefore I will
return to the method of curation. Also I say and affirm, that not only
these above rehearsed, but also many other, be the indications of the figure,
and situation of the parts. For you cannot well and exactlie bind the
affected part, before ye take indication either of the figure, or situation,
or of them both. Neither can you set the pipe of a clister well, before ye take
such Indication. What should I make mention of Argalia, specially when as you
cannot minister it before you perfectly know the situation and figure of the
bladder. Then truly by these things it does manifestly appear, that the
affected part gives indication to the curation. But in ruptures truly, which
the Greeks call Regmata, many Indications may be taken to one purpose, and
principally the indication that is taken of the situation ought to be
considered. For the ruptions that be hid in the deapth of the body, require
other curations than the wounds which appear outwardly, and for because they
be such as be with Ecchimosis, or contusion about the broken flesh, therefore
they declare diverse Indications curatiue. For always the Indications curatiue
do answer to the number of the affects, whereof we will show more copiouslie
hereafter, when we shall speak of Phlegmon, how that the affects that are in
the deep places of the body, requires stronger medicines than those in the
upper parts. Then at the least I judge it to be manifest, that it is necessary
that the strength of the medicamentes that are ministered outwardly ought to be
resolved, when the affected part which should be cured by those, is hid in ye
deapth and profunditie of the body. Therefore it behooves to augment the
virtue of the same medicaments, so that by the passage thereof it may be
staked. Certainly Ecchimosis does indicate euacuation for the remedy of the
cure. Wherefore medicamentes that will moderatlie heat and dry, be most
convenient for it. For they that do vehemently dry, truly do resolve and
digest more at the beginning than they which dry but simply. But I will
speak hereafter somewhat of this disease, which is difficill and serious to
cure. But of that which did pertain to the matter we have largely spoken of.
Truly those medicamentes that moisteth and heateth more than they, which the
Greeks call Calasticke. Also those which do somewhat to dryness, which the
Greeks call Suntatica, be the chief and principal remedies for all
Ecchimosis. But we must take heed the medicines do cleave to the ruptions that
are in the deepnesse of the body, and also that they be of strong virtue, and
that they be sharp and such as will digest: and to speak briefly, such
medicines ought to be of great force, inasmuch as Ecchimosis is in the
deepnesse of the body and far from the skin. In such affects the use of a
cucurbite is profitable, which is an instrument invented of Physicians, to
cause vlcerate attraction. And when Ecchimosis is digested by the use of a
cucurbit, then you may minister those things which may dry the broken flesh,
and conioyne it with ligature, and add that which may coagulate and join the
wound together, for Ecchimosis being resolved and digested, the broken flesh
shall coagulate together. But if it be resolved, then corruption breeds in
it, and occupies the space that is between the lips of the wound, so that
the ruption cannot close. Wherefore these above rehearsed, declare unto us all
causes how small so ever they be.

For although some has had rigor, or though the body has been overthrown
by some Fever, so that there bath not been good concoction, or that it has
been defatigated and wearied, then immediately there shall be pain in the
part where the ruption and wound is, because that the said ruption has been
lately joined together, but not so substantiallie, because of time. Wherefore
it follows that a little thing may easily part them, and fill the place
again with superfluous humors. But what engendereth in such wounds or
ruptions? nothing but new Ecchimosis, and much like unto the first: That is to
say, when the flesh was first broken, except that this Ecchimosis that is new,
of more and corrupter mattier than that which was at the beginning, which came
of blood, and therefore now this is more easily digested and resolved than
that which was at the beginning. And thus ye which we have spoken hitherto
shall suffice for the disputation of Ulcers, and thus we conclude this fourth
Book of our Therapeutike method, called Methodus Medendi.

FINIS.
printer's or publisher's device

THE FIFTH BOOK. of Galen, called in Greek (...), and in Latin, Methodus
Medendi.
The effect of the same.
1 The curation of ulcers which chance in the fleshie parts, and then the
curation of Ulcers in the Isntrumental parts. 2 Of the ruption of a vein or
Artery. 3 How a flux of blood may stay by deriuation. 4 The Medicaments that
will make a crust which does much to the stopping of a flux of blood. 5 Of
spitting and distillation of blood. 6 The curation of Ulcers in the pudend
places. 7 The curation of a vein or divided Artery. 8 The rejecting of blood
both from other parts and also from the lungs.
The first Chapter.
SEeing that in the two last books we have taught how any shall rightly cure
Ulcers, we will by the way show, that all other Physicians which use the art,
not searching out the Elements of those simple particulars in us, cannot cure
any thing only by reason, but yet least of all other those which profess
Thessalus doctrine. The rest which are by mere experience only taught,
suppose, that at the least those Ulcers which are in diverse parts, are to be
cured by diverse reasons. But those that follow Thessalus, (as their Captain)
for his excellent wisdom, think that every Ulcer, in what part of the
body so ever it be, requires like curation: for if it be hollow, they say
it must be filled with flesh, if it be equal, then to be ciccatrized, if
there be supercrescent flesh, then that flesh must be diminished, if it be
bloody and new, then it must be adglutinated: As though he that knew this,
must of force cure rightly, or that this reason were unknown to the common
people, when as there is none that is herein ignorant. But they understand
not how the hollownesse is to be filled with flesh, neither how that which
is filled ought to be ciccatrized, or to take away that is overmuch
increased, or to join together that which is pure and bloody without
hollownesse: such works truly are properly appertaining to the art of
Medicine, found out by the help either of Reason or Experience, or both.

Therefore repeating again, let us briefly overrun those things, whereby
the beginning of these which are to be spoken, may be joined with the aid of
those which we have already set out. We have declared that every Ulcer
requires desiccatiue medicines, but that which has hollownesse, beside that,
it needs desiccatiues, it also does require abstersiues: that which
requires to have the lips joined together, (such is a green wound, called
in Greek Enema) does ask both more drying medicines, and also that be gentle
astringent without any abstersion.

Furthermore, those ulcers which need to be ciccatrized, require not only
yet more drying medicines, but also strong astringent remedies, and whereas
there is supercrescent flesh against nature, there are required sharp and
abating medicines, such of necessity be hot and dry. If any accident be
joined with the Ulcer, the Indication of curation must be taken of the nature
thereof, and of this all the faculties of medicines also to be had. If there
should superfluous mattier grow in the Ulcer, it behooves to have medicines
which should take it away, and such have a great deal more abstersive virtue
than some incarnatiue medicines have.

Also if there be seen more copious moisture, there is need of a medicine
more desiccatiue, but yet not to exceed his kind, and if the medicine should
be glutinatiue, it ought to be drying and astringent, if it shall incarnate,
it must be desiccatiue, and some thing abstersive, and so in all other, as is
already declared. Also if the flesh subject should be intemperate, first
truly we must cure this intemperatnesse, that which is drier, by medicines
humectiue, the moist, by desiccatiues. Also that which is hot by
refrigeratiues, the cold, by medicines that are hot. And if by conjunction of
two qualities, the flesh be intemperate, it must be cured by ministering a
contrary medicine, which has double qualities, for this one thing is common
to all affects against nature, that they cannot come again to their own
nature, without such medicines as have contrary quality.

Furthermore, at this time the causes of these intemperatiues are to be
considered, whether these be common to all the whole body, or else proper of
some parts, which should infest the vlcerate member by society, the Greeks
call it Simpathia. First of all truly, the cause that nourishes this
intemperatnesse, is to be cured, and after that the intemperatnesse it self
which is now made, for this indication, is common to all such as spring of any
cause.

We have also declared that there are diverse indications taken of the
differences of ulcers, and also those which are taken of the temparament of the
sick body, have a contrary reason, for those Indications seeing they are
taken of those things which are against nature, declare that all contrary
things must be applied: these Indications because they are taken of natures
self, show that like things must be used, for if how much the part is drier,
so much the more it requires to be dried, that which is less dry, is less
to be dried. In like sort truly it is declared in making hot or cold.
Neither have we let pass that of the excellency of the member or contrary
state. Also to the sharpness or dullness of feeling, there is to be had a
contrary scope of curing.

The second Chapter.
THerefore we will now consider that which remains of the curation of this
kind of infirmities, we call this kind, for more evident doctrines sake,
solution of unity, neither is it any matter, if thou call it solution of
continuitie. This kind does not only happen in the similer and simple
parts, but also in the compound and isntrumental, but yet there be other
indications of remedies taken of the similer parts, then of the Isntrumental
of which they that follow Hyppocrates method, know both, because they know the
natures of both parts. But those that follow Erasistratus and Herophilus, have
but one Indication, that is to say, that which is taken of the Isntrumental
parts. Wherefore they have no certain method in these, which follow
whatsoever indications are taken of the body, or sickness, hot, cold, moist,
or dry, but yet they are not ignorant of the Indications taken of the form,
position, excellency, quick feeling of the part, or those which are
contrary. That which we say shall be more manifest if we set out the the
parts themselves. Therefore because already abundantly we have entreated of
those Ulcers, chiefly which happen in the fleshie parts, it is time to speak
of them which chance in the vein, and artery, and nerve, and not of these
absolutely by themselves, but as they are in the isntrumental parts of man.
Wherefore if any has a great artery or vein wounded, and there follows
presently great flux of blood, and the wound in the vein will hardly be
glutinated in the artery, it can more hardly be done, as many Physicians
suppose, but peradventure cannot be done at all. Therefore we must again speak
of either of them, and first of the flux of blood, and next of adglutination.
But for that such fluxes are caused by Anastomasin and Diepedesin, as we
presently declare, it shall not be from our purpose, for that they both have a
common cure, to make mention of them in this place, although they seem to be
another kind of disease, truly the blood flows out of the vein or artery,
the mouth of them being opened, or their coat divided, or as I may term it,
strained or sent out in manner of sweat, surely the coat of the^ is divided
either by wounding, or contusion, or ruption, or erosion. Anastomasis
happens, both through the imbecilitie of the vessels, and also through the
plenty of blood which breaks to the mouth of it with violence, and
furthermore by any thing co^mming outwardly, having a sharp quality.

Diapedesis comes when as the coat is made more thin, and the blood
attenuated, and furthermore, it may come to the mouth of any of the small
veins being opened. Therefore we must speak of either affect by himself,
and first of all of that division which we have said to come of erosion or
wounding, or contusion, or ruption, so that those things which do wound are
edged tools, and apt to cut, those that make contusion are heavy and hard,
those that cause ruption, do it by straining, the same does also the
vehemency of any action, the abundance of ill juice or humors, not in
respect of the strength, but for that it is not contained in his vessels.

Also any heavy or hard thing falling from above, entering in, for any such
thing when the vessels or veins are empty, or else containing but a small
substance entering in it, if it has an object which is hard, it causes
contusion, if the vessel be full, it bruseth it, before it makes co^tusion.
When that which happens is like, as if thou did fill a bottle or bladder,
and did let a stone fall on it, or else violently did strike it against
a stone, truly the like to this is that which happens to falls from above,
for look what respects the bottle has to the stone, the same has the man
unto the ground, and whosoever breaks any vessels of the lungs, with great
and most vehement clamor, must refer the ill received, unto the violence of
the action. In like manner he which has broke any vessels (that is to say,
any vein or artery) by bearing a great burden, or by going about to lift it
on his shoulder, or else to lift it up with his hands, and so much the rather,
to whom it happens of most swift running, or most strong leaping, or
otherwise, any part being violently extended. For it is like as if one should
stretch out a rope, or leather, though many vessels are broken because they
contain not the blood in the^, chiefly when it is flatulent, as may appear
both in hogs-heads which full of must, do oftentimes break, and also in other
of most strong bodies.

The third Chapter.
AND if the vessel be ruptured, either of wounding, clamor, fall, or
contusion, the cause of these truly do cease, but if it come of abundance,
it may again happen that the vessel may be ruptured, the efficient cause is
yet remaining, and also in this affect, ye abundance truly is to be euacuated,
then the blood to be suppressed, and after the ulcer to be cured, but where as
the efficient cause is ceased, there the blood is first to be stenched, and
after the ulcer is to be cured. How therefore, will we stench the blood? truly
by stopping the ruptured vessel, the blood that was carried by it being auerted
and conveyed to another place, for if the blood should be carried to the place
unto which it did in the beginning flow, and that the mouth of the vessel be
in like sort open, the man truly being vexed with the flux, shall sooner
die than the flux of blood shall cease, surely ye wounds will be closed, if the
sides which are divided be brought together, or that the mouth of it be
stopped, and the sides of the wound closed by the help of our hands, if we
may come to it with ligature, or such remedies as are cold and astringent.
Neither is it lawful to stitch the wound of a vein or artery, as they
affirm, who say that no Indication is to be taken of the substance and nature
of the wounded part, the mouth of the vessel shall be stopped, the blood being
then coniealed, the Greeks call it Thombros, and also by things outwardly
applied on both sides about, may be put upon it, and also in many wounds the
skin it self, or what else we mixed with it, such are linaments, in Greek
called Motos, and those medicines, because they have a clammie and gross
substance, do stop the pores, the Greeks name them Emphlastica, as also
medicines which make a crust, which the Greeks name Escharan. The old
Physicians despised these in such like wounds, as it were a great ieopardie.
These also are done, not only by the fire it self, but also with medicines
having a fiery faculty, and the mouth of the vessel is stopped by these
medicines, the blood truly shall be auerted and turned to other members, both
being drawn unto the next parts, and also by reuulsion to the contrary, the
Greeks call that Parochetensis, but this Stuti Pasis, and these also be
invented of Hyppocrates, being verily the common remedies of all immoderate
euacuation. Deriuation is made unto the next parts, when as that which is
voided is euacuated by the nosethrilles. Also reuulsion to the contrary
parts, is when as it draws downward.

Again, that which flows by stool, that is derived by the woman's shape, but
Reuulsion is upward, for so truly Nature is wont to do. To the woman,
says Hyppocrates, which vomiteth blood, her natural sickness following is a
remedy, and for this cause if her terms abundantly break out, or that blood
by any way flows out of the matrice, thou shall draw it upward by fixing a
great cucurbite or box under the paps. For this also is invented of
Hyppocrates.

And by like reason the bleeding at the nose is stayed by great cucurbites
fixed under the ribs, and if it flows out of the right nosethrill, then the
cucurbite is to be set upon the liver, but if it comes out of the left
nosethrill, then set cucurbite upon the spleen, but if the blood flows out of
both nosethrills, then fix the cucurbits upon both liver and spleen, but if
the patient be not yet helped, open a vein on the cubite that is right against
the flux, and when as thou have taken a little blood away, stop it for an
hours space, and then take again more blood, and so again and again,
according to the strength of the Patient. In like sort, because it is a common
way of curing, thou shall bring all other fluxes both to their contrary
parts, and also make deriuation by the next places, for that which flows by
the stool, to euacuate by urine or the matrice, and that which flows by
urine must be voided by stool or matrice. And of the fluxes of the Eyes,
Ears, and pallet of the mouth, the next doriuation is by the nosethrils,
reuulsion truly of all these higher parts, is ever to be made downward, and
also of the lower parts upward. Also from the right side to the left, as also
from the left side to the right. In like sort reuulsion of that which is
within must be made outward, and of that which is outward in like sort inward,
therefore friction of contrary parts is done chiefly by those medicines which
do heat.

Also straight ligatures are to be reckoned among those remedies which bring to
the contrary parts, and so also is the shutting of the natural pores set in
the opposite place, but by what medicines that shall be done, the matter
thereof is set out in our books of Medicines. But it behooves to entreat of
all Fluxes in the Books following. Now we must return unto the flux of blood,
and the band put on the vessels that flow, are to be accounted among stopping
medicines, and also our fingers, which do close and press the vessels.

There is also another ligature hereto appertaining, which the Greeks call
Epidesis, although it goes not round about the member, as a band does, but
joins the gaping lips of the wounded part by his embracing, and also holds
such things as are put upon the part, and is numbered among closing medicines.
Besides all these rehearsed, the apt situation of the wounded part, is
accounted among the remedies which stay the flux of blood.

Surely the situation shall be apt, if it be directed unto these two ends,
that the part be free from dolor, and be directed upward, for if the part hang
down or is pained, it will not stay the flux, but will cause it, if there be
none. Therefore he that knows these things, if at any time he shall stand by
him out of whose wound blood flows, (for first I will entreat of these,) let
him put his finger upon the mouth of the vessel gently, strayning it and
compressing it without dolor, for so he shall at once both stay the blood, and
also make it congele in the wound, but if the vessel from which it flows, be
deep hid, let him then surely both know the position and magnitude of it. And
furthermore, whether it be a vein or artery, then put it in a hook and lift
it up, and a little wryth it, but if the blood will not so be stayed, if it be
a vein let him without bynding, assay it, to stench the blood with some of
those medicines which have power to stay blood, truly the best are those
Emplastique which are made of Rosin fried, and the finest wheat flower, and
Gipsum, and such like, but if it be an artery, thou shall stay the flux with
one of these two, either by binding it, or by cutting a sunder the whole
vessel, and sometime truly we are also constrained to bind the great veins,
and to cut all these overthwart, and this necessity happens in those where
as the flux issues out of the deepest place, and chiefly by those parts that
be straight and principal, for so is part of the other part drawn back, and
the wound is hid and covered of the parts lying on it, but it is more safety
to do both, that is, to bind the root of the vessel, and also to cut of
that remains, I call the root of the vessel his former part, which is nearer
the liver, or the heart, this in ye neck is the lower part, in the arms and in
the shankes, from the higher part, and so in all other parts, and as thou may
learn by the anatomy which these methodelesse Thessalians do not allow.

The fourth Chapter.
THese things being done, the wound is first to be filled with flesh before
thou take away the band from the vessel, except the flesh engendered does
fill the place about the cut artery, but ye there is some wide space, the
affect does follow, which the Grecians call Aneurisma, wherefore I counsel thee
to use rather those kind of medicines which stench blood, for that through
their clamminesse they stop the pores, the Greeks call it Emplasticon, than
those which make an asker, because the wound after it is sooner and with less
danger filled, for it is danger in ye other, least there be made presently a
new flux of blood out of the vessel, if the crust falls of. Therefore that
medicine that I will now set here out, is the best that I know of all other,
which I also use without peril in fluxes of blood, of the coats called
Membrana, of the brain, one part of Fra^concense mixed with half one part of
Aloes, after when thou will use it te^per it with so much white of an Egg, as
it may be thick like Honey, and put to these most soft hairs of an Hare, and
then apply it largely both to the vessel, and also to ye ulcer, binding it
outwardly with a soft linen roller, and let the roller go four or five times
about the vessel that flowed, and then go toward the root of the vessel in
those parts, I mean, which may be rolled toward the root, you may in all
parts of the body except in the coats or membranes of the brain, this being
done, if thou will lose it the third day, if the medicine do cleave hard to
the ulcer, put another upon it as it were a liniament moystening that which is
made of hairs, and roll it again as thou did the first, but if the linament
falls away of his own accord, then gently pressing the root of the vessel
with thy fingers, that nothing flow to the wound, take this away, the hand
hanging down, and put on an other. In this wise shall thou cure the vessel
until it be defended with flesh, and from the beginning to the end, keeping
the part upright, keeping herein a measure in this figure of situation, for you
must beware least that dolor chances, and stir again flux, for there is
nothing that does more provoke flux, and increase inflammation, than dolor.

This medicine (as I have said,) I use many ways, sometime to the Aloes, the
double weight of Franconcense, sometime equal portion of both, sometime the
Franconcense to be a little more than the Aloes, or else a greater portion, but
not double, and sometime putting in the stead of Franconcense, Manna, for Manna
is a medicine that is more restringent than Franconcense, and Franconcense is
more Emplastique than manna, and it is manifest that in hard bodies there must
be the more portion of Aloes, as in soft more of Franconcense, so shall the one
of them be more astringent, and the other by his cla^minesse and grossness,
cleaving more to the small pores, which they call Emplasticoteron, therefore
where thou will study to make the medicine more Emplastique, it behooves that
thou use those Franconcense that be tough, and as I may term it, more Rosin
like, such truly is softer and whiter, and when it is chawed as Aloes and
Manna, is not made smaller, but defends the parts, cleaving together like
Chiamastiche, but these are proper to that treatise, which shows the
compositio^ of medicines, which we could not but somewhat touch in this book,
for either we must never have made mention of any particular example, but have
been satisfied with universal methodes, or if particular should be put to us
the preparation of them was to be touched.

But as we before have said, it is convenient that we be here pleased with
one or two examples, put out of those remedies which are invented by Method,
and this thing I will still remember. But let us turn likewise, to that
again, that in speaking we have little finished, and I have made the longer
mention of these medicines rehearsed, because I am persuaded that it excels
al other, and I marvel if it shall chance any man, to find a better,
therefore I used it always in the Pa^nickles or Membranes of the brain, and
also in wounds of the neck, yea, of the Iugulane veins themselves, which the
Greek writers name Sphagitadas, insomuch as it also stays flux of blood in
them, and that without bynding, neither, in joining these, that thou make to
much have as certain foolish Chirurgions do use, but compresse with the one
hand the lower part of the vessel, or griping hold it with the other hand,
apply the medicine to the wound and gently press it to the wound, until it
cleaneth being congeled, after bind it from above backward, and not as in the
joints from below upward, for it behooves to make your rolling toward the root
of the vessels, and to repress that which flows. There are many other
medicines which have an emplastique faculty, yea, without grief, but there is
none that does so incarnate.

It is chiefly to be regarded in this case, that the medicine falling of, that
flesh be engendered about the vessel. But those medicines which make an asker,
when the asker falls of, they leave the part more bare than for their
natural state, for the generation of the asker is (as I may term it) of the
parts subject round about, half burnt, for what manner a thing these quenched
coals are that they provide against winter, such are the askers being relics
of the adust flesh, so that how much of the part is burnt to an asker, so much
truly it loses of his natural flesh, therefore all that wa^teth of the part
where as ye asker falls away, and so is s^ne bare and without flesh. And
there has followed to many a flux of blood, that could hardly be stenched,
after that the asker has fallen of, wherefore who so will in these also
minister all things by a method, he will long before consider all these ways,
wherewith blood is stenched, and choose that which is with least danger, not
omitting the other ways as often as necessity requires, for I have found
great necessity of using medicines, making an asker, and also of hot yrons,
whereas the flux of blood sprang of erosion, of any humor which did
putrify, as also in that affect where all that does putrify is taken of it,
it is most safe to burn, as it were the roots of it, or else to use medicines
which make an askar, and by this occasion we come to that necessity both in
the privy members, and also in the fundament, because those parts both for
their natural heat, and that they be the conduites of Excrementes, they
putrify of a small cause. That scope which thou tendest unto, for those
medicines making an askar, must not only be hot, but such as has with it
also joined and astringent faculty, such is perceived to be Chalcitis, and
Misi, and Vitriall, whether thou use them crude, or raw, or adust. Those
that are made of vnflaked Lime are more vehement than these, but yet Lime has
no astringent virtue, therefore the askars fall sooner, of which are made with
these, but those that are made with astringent Medicines, do longer cleave to
the bodies, which thing truly is very profitable, for that flesh grows
underneath it, and is made as a certain covering to the vessel that flows.

Wherefore it behooves us not to be rash, as many be in taking of the
askers, whereas is peril of flux of blood, except it be in those affectes,
whereas through the putrefaction we are compelled to apply to the body hot
yrons. All Physicians, I know not by what reason, call that affect in Greek
Nemon, of the Verb Nemomai, which signifies to feed or devour, because this
affect proceeds by eating the sick parts, unto those that are found
devouring some part of them, so that they call it not of the substance of the
thing showed, but of an augmentation. The plenty of matter of all Medicines
which have this faculty, are set out in their proper Commentaries, I call them
proper, whose Titles are De simplicibus Medicamentis, and also De compositione
eorum.

The fifth Chapter.
THerefore seeing we have set out the sum of this method, whereby thou may
cure such fluxes of blood as are in the upper part, we are bent to set out the
Treatise of those fluxes which come out of the deapth of the body. The blood
that flows out of the vessel, either is stenched for that it flows no more
to the part, because the division is stopped, or else through both, which I
suppose to be most sure. But the blood is let to flow to the part; either
through binding, or when as it is diuerted to the contrary parts, or is
derived to the part adjacent, or by refrigeration, either of the whole body,
or else of the affected parts, so that cold potions have often stayed the
flux of blood, as also cold things in fomentations outwardly applied. In
like sort Oxicratum and sour Wine, and any other, that have either
astringent virtue, or only refrigeratiue faculty. And the division is shut,
if that which is divided, be drawn together, or closed, or else stopped Truly
it is drawn together both by restriction, and refrigeration, and ligature, and
binding, but it is stopped either inwardly or outwardly, inwardly by the
blood coniealed, which the Greeks call Thombros, outwardly, both with this,
and also with Linamentes, Spunges, Askars, and with such medicines, as through
the clammie and gross substance do stop the pores, the Greeks call them
Emplastica, and also with putting the foresaid medicines to the hurt part.
How every of these shall be done, it is already set out. But the fluxes of
blood which break out of the deep parts of the body, cannot be stopped
either by binding or ligature, no not with hot yrons, and to be brief,
neither with such things as we go about to touch the divided body with, or
else the part, but rather with reuulsion and deriuation to the parts which
(...) next. Also meat and drink which have an Emplastique faculty, and by
astringent medicines. Of these thou half plenty in their proper volumes, what
Indication is taken of the parts that happen to the common Indications
curatiue rehearsed, as it were an overplus in every affect, for we use
sometime Instruments according to the property of the part, some to the
Matrixe, other to the Bladder, and other to all the thick Intestines, for we
make mirtions of some profitable Medicines into the Intestines by a Clister,
and into the Matrixe, by those which the Greeks call Metrenchitas, as into the
Bladder, by pipes directly pierced through. And truly the fluxes of blood by
those parts, are rare, and yet sometime they chance. And although they are not
dangerous by the profuston it self, yet when as they long continue, they are
not void of peril. For we did see blood flow out of the Matrixe four days,
neither could it be stopped by any remedy, until we stayed it, using the
juice of Plantaine, for this medicine is most profitable to such fluxes of
blood as come through erosion, unto which I do use to mix in this case some
more vehement medicine, and sometime an other which is proper for the affected
part, which thing is ever to be done, and to be received in all fluxes for the
chiefest document.

For in these fluxes of the Matrixe, Bladder, and Intestines, the quantity of
the profusion is to be esteemed, that we may take it as the first or second
indication of curation, and yet by the way, not neglecting the cause of the
whole affect: for if any great vessel be broken or vehemently opened, and
does gape, we need astringent Medicines, as Balaustium and Hiposistes, and
Rhoes, and Omphacium and Acacia, and unripe galls, and Malicorium, but if it
be a little vessel that is rupturned, or but a little opened, so that the
blood be not much which flows out of it, Aloes and Manna, and the rind of
the Pine tree, and Sigella Lemnia, and the fruit of the Egyptian Spine, and
Saffron, and Lapis Haematites, and such like, be profitable medicines given in
read and sour Wine, but if thou can not get any such Wine, nor Plantaine,
nor Nightshade, (for they are also good) we may boil in water the sprigs of
Rubus, and of Caninus Rubus, and Mirtus, and Lentiscus, and Iuie, and to
conclude, all such as have an astringent virtue, whether it be root or fruit,
or rind, or bud, and by like reason the decoction of astringent apples, and
chiefelie Quinces, Mixtiles, and Medlers, is a convenient remedy.

The sixth Chapter.
AND if there happen a certain flux of erosion, the Greeks call it
Anabrosin, it is not for the more part abundant, but small, and flowing by
little and little, therefore you must use the Trochisce of Pasionis, or
Andronis, or Polyeida, or else of our invention, which have in kind the same
force, but more stronger. These cease the erosion, if regard be first had, (as
is said) to the whole body. But if the flux be too abundant, we must use
those medicines which are most vehemently astringent, until the vehement
force be broken, then mix the Trochisce with them, and after you may use the
Trochisce alone, with any of the forenamed iuyces or decoctions.

And truly the medicines which are outwardly applied to the part, whether
they be astringent, or cold without astriction, these I do not always allow
(as many Physicians do) for they seem to me to do contrary altogether to
that which ought to be done, to keep the blood within, and fill the vessels
which are in the deep parts. We did see some of those which did cast forth
blood out of his lungs, to be manifestly hurt by refrigerating the breast, so
that some of them did vomit blood, because their belly was refrigerated, in
like sort, some of them that blead in the nosethrils, were worse by
refrigeration of the head. Therefore I counsel not ever, or without
difference, or in every time, that the places which are about the part
whereas the blood flows, to be refrigerated, no not until thou have first
turned it to the other parts. As for example: in flux at the nose, when thou
have used (as I said) letting of blood, or frictions of the joints, or
binding, or fixing cururbites under the ribs. But thou shall not forthwith
use to the forehead and head refrigerating medicines, but first reuulsion to
the contrary parts, fixing in the top of the hinder part of the neck a
cucurbite, or boxing as it may be termed, for there is a double euersion of
the flux of blood at the nose, both that which is to the lower parts of the
whole body, and that which is made to the hinder parts of the head, because
the nose is placed both in the higher and also in the former part, for that
part which is low, is contrary to that which is higher, and that which is
behind, to that which is before. But of flux of blood, we have hitherto
abundantly spoken.

It is evident that the affect named Dyapedesis, is to be cured with astringent
and refrigeratiue medicines, and if it chance at any time through too thin
blood, you must use gross diet. What this same diet is, we shall hereafter
set out, and we have already after a sort set it out in our Book, which is
entitled, De Attenuante victu. Now we must return to the curation of the
forenamed affects.

Therefore the Ulcer which is in the vein, if it be in the over part, has
the like curation to an ulcer in the flesh, of which I have disputed in the two
books going before this. For if it come of a green wound, thou must make it
close with medicines called Enaema, or if they come of erosion, you must
discern them first by reason, and what is spoken of the curation of rebellious
ulcers, to prove that by diligence they may be healed.

Also when as thou will use binding, or medicines stanching blood, or hot
yrons, that is the scope of curation, that thou do incarnate the places
about the lyppes of the Ulcer, and that thou use all together the said
medicines, which are set out of us in the method of hollow Ulcers.

The seventh Chapter.
WE have now said, that the artery being wounded, seems to many Physicians
impossible to be closed. And that do some of those affirm, who be professors
of only Experience, and some using this reason. For they say, the one coat
of the artery is hard and cartilagious, but such bodies cannot unite together,
when as the ability of uniting is only of soft bodies, as may appear in
extreme things, never stone joining to stone, or shell with shell, and also
in our selves, for neither Cartilage with Cartilage, or bone with bone does
grow together, for broken bones truly do not cleave together by unition,
but are joining together by Callus, the Greeks call it Poron, as it were with
Glue. Therefore we will also begin first with our Experience, and put before
your eyes those things that we have seen in women and children, both the
arteries to be conglutinated, and also to be compassed about with flesh, and
that in the forehead, anckle, joint of the arm, and wrist, such a like thing
happened in time past to a rusticall young man, when in the spring time he
would be let blood, which our Country men have in great use, but when the
Physician who should open the vein, had bound the man's arm, it happened the
artery to rise bounching up, and the Physician opened it in stead of the
vein, truly the Orifice was very small, the blood straight ways issued out
yeolowe, thin, and hot, and that as it were leaping, pulse like, and the
Physician truly, like as he was a very young man, so was he little
exercised in the works of the Art, though he had opened the vein, but when I
with another of the auncienter Physicians that were present, did behold that
which had chanced, preparing a medicine of the kind of Emplaisters that
staunch blood, I did both diligently join the division, and also by and by
laid the medicine on, and upon it bound a most soft Sponge. He which had cut
the artery, meruailing of our strange doing in this case, I told him what we
had done, after we were out of the lodging of him that was let blood, and we
commanded him that he did not loose it, we being absent, and that he should
not go about it until the fourth day, but letting it remain as it was,
only moistning the Sponge, after we unbinding it the fourth day, we found
the Incision conglutinated, and we bad him apply the same medicine again, and
bind him in like manner as before, and then after many days to loose it, and
so the cut artery of this man was healed.

Among all other, I never saw none cut in the Cubite, but Aneurysma followed,
to some greater, to other lesser. But how Aneurysma ought to be cured, we will
hereafter in his proper place set out, whereas the curation shall be set out
of Tumors against Nature. Now let us finish our disputation begun.

Surely the nature of the Artery shows difficulty of conglutination of the
harder coat, but yet not such as may not be overcome, neither yet is it so
dry and hard as a bone or cartilage, yea, it is a great deal more soft and
fleshie than they are, so that we need so much less to despair of the
unition of the division, when both the division is little, and the man's body
naturally soft. It seems that Experience only does also subscribe to
Reason, when as I have seen it glutinated in children and women, by reason of
their moisture, and softness of their bodies and in one young man, whereas is
said, the Artery was but little divided. And although an Artery be harder to
cure than a vein, yet there is no contrary use of medicines in both, yea,
they be all one in kind, varying only by reason of excess and defect. For
the Artery does require so much more drying medicines than the vein, how
much by his proper nature he is of dryer temperament than the vein.

But if thou will engender flesh about both, they both require like medicines,
for flesh is in like sort engendered in compassing the veins and arteries, as
is showed in filling of hollow Ulcers. And the veins and arteries that are in
the matrix, bladder, or intestines, seeing that they require medicines like in
kind, when as they are exulcerated, they also require Instruments, whereby
Iniections may be made, Metrenchitas, that is, Clisters from the matrice, and
a pipe bound right through, and a Clister. And to these Ulcers which are in the
intestines, you may make iniections of the liquide medicine, blood warm,
contained in a bladder, unto the end of which is annexed a right pipe. The
substance of the medicines shall be varied according to the form of the
Instrument. Neither is it meet to pour into these Instruments gross
medicines, but they require moisture, and therefore for the more part
moderatlie hot. Therefore dry medicines are more apt than those that are named
Liquide, because they are easily mixed, either with the juice of Plantaine, or
any other of like kind. Such be Saffron, and Pompholix, and Aloes, and those
that in Greek are called Cephalica. In the first time of engendering flesh,
which is presently after the suppression of the blood Terra Lemnia, is an
healthful remedy.

The eight Chapter.
BUT the Ulcers that are in the lungs, are more hard to be cured, and truly
in some the cure is not only difficill, but also seems not to be done at
all, as well to them that follow Reason, as also to them that profess
Experience by Reason, so that among the inward parts, it is thought to be
continually moving, whereas those ulcers which are to be cured, require rest
and quietness, as Experience shows, because they never saw any cured that
was so affected. And peradventure we may doubt of Experience. For it is meet
that we begin here for knowledge sake, for we have seen one, for ye he
cried loud, another falling from an high place, and another stricken in
wrestling, not only presently most grievously to cough, so that also with the
cough some to vomit one or two pynts of blood, and some other more, of those
that were in this case. Some of them were altogether without dolor, and some
complained on their breast.

Furthermore, the blood in those that complained, was not cast out altogether,
neither was it much and less red, or hot, as that which came a far of, but
to those that were void of grief the blood came gushing out, and much in
quantity, being red and hot, manifestly showing that it came not far of.
Surely, the transsumption of the blood, from the breast into Aspera Arteria,
brings a great doubt, but of those Physicians, who suppose that it cannot be
sent out by the cote, which inuesteth the lunges. And peradventure they would
have affirmed, that the blood could never be voyded by the mouth, out of the
breast.

Many of those that were affected, felt present dolor, and other having an
inflammation, which after did supperate, showed a manifest token that the
affect was in the breast.

But now being confounded by these signs, they grant that it comes from the
breast. But while they seek another way, yea, by the cote of the lungs, they
are constrained to bring out many, and that absurd things, although as I
suppose, they see most evidently in them, whom ye Greeks call Empios, the
mattier it self, which they confess to be in the midst space, betwixt the
lungs and the breast, to be spyt out from the lungs. We verily have used to them
Melicratum, which was iniected into the breast, to be spyt out from the lungs,
in those where was so great an Apostume, that part of the bones was putrified.

Surely at Rome, we have seen such affects amongst the Romans, to have after
remained in the breast, so that of force we were feign to cut out the affected
bone, and in many also the Pannickle, which within is joining to the ribs.
This being found putrified with ye corrupt ribs, we are accustomed in this
cure to use Melicratum, to be put in by the ulcer, the pacie^t inclining
himself on the affected part, to cough, and sometime hastily to blow his nose,
and in the mean time with an instrument that draws out matter, the Greeks
call it Pyulcon, to bring out the Melicratum, that remained, this being done
when as we trusted that we had voyded out both all the mattier, and also ye
Sanies, by and by we iniected Medicines, so that in these affects, if thou
leauest in the cured space between the breast and the lungs, any moisture, thou
shall presently cause the same to be cast out with coughing. Truly we do
marvel of those that doubt of the way by the lungs, why they do not rather
doubt how gross blood issues out of the Callus of a fractured bone, for the
blood which issues, is more grosser tha^ that which is natural, and the
substance of the skin is a great deal thicker than the pannickle inuesting
the bones. Therefore as we said, when as any vessel of the lungs is broken,
either with falling, or with loud crying, and that without grief there
gusheth out much blood hot and fresh, by coughing, you may understand that the
wound is in the lungs, the cure must be taken in hand after the manner that we
often have done, and that many times with good success. Therefore we must
command the pacient that he use not great respiration, and furthermore, that
he always use silence.

Furthermore, the inward vein of the Cubite must be opened, from which twice
or thrice afterward thou shall take blood, because we may divert it, then rub
and bind all the the joints, as we are wont. These things being done, thou
shall first give him to drink Oxicratum, delayed, and blood warm, that if in
the inward part, there be any congeled blood being resolved, it may be spit
out, and thus do twice or thrice in three hours, then give him some medicine
which both has an Emplastique virtue, and is also astringent, and that first
with delayed Oxicratum, or with the decoction of Myrtiles, or such like
astringent.

Again, at night give him this medicine in like sort, suffering him not to
eat any thing if the affect be vehement, but else give him of some supping,
that shall be sufficient, and it shall chiefly profit, if the pacient be
strong, if that the next day a little blood be taken out of the divided vein,
and so to continue in diet and medicines, as is aforesaid, unto the fourth
day, the breast in the mean time, if it be in Summer, being moistened with
oil of Roses, in Winter, with Vnguento Nardino. And if thou will use an
Emplastique medicine, thou have an excellent one of our making, which boldly
thou may also use to other wounds, it is made of Aspaltum and Vinegar, and
other which are accustomablie mixed to those medicines, which Physicians call
Enaema Barbara. But if thou cure a woman with child, or him that has soft
flesh, the medicine that is called Diachalciteos,, is very convenient, whose
virtues I have declared in the first book of Composition of medicines. And by
this way we have cured many, unto whom we came presently as they felt
pain, for this is the greatest thing, unto which it behooves thee to be
greatly attendant, whether presently upon the rupture of the vessel, thou
beginnest the curation, that thou do adglutinate the green wound before
there that be inflammation, for if inflammation flow, there is after small hope
of adglutination, but yet you may prolong the time. And the cause that such
ulcers can hardly or not at all be cured, is, that when the inflammation is
cured, the mattier and Sanies of the ulcer are to be taken away, but in the
matrix or bladder, they are void of their own accord, when as the Patient
lies groueling, and also we may cleanse them. But in the lungs neither of
these are to be done. Therefore in all ulcers which are in it, all the purging
that is made, is only by coughing.

But if we command all quietness and small respiration, and to speak little,
that the wound may adglutinate, what hope can there be of curation to the^
that cough, but the cure is to be dispaired of, for that through respiration
this member does continually move, and those that have been before our time
do judge it so, by ye vacuation of the mattier and Sanies. But if any is
presently cured by this way, the wound will close, and if inflammation do come,
the cure is both hard and uncertain, when as the mattier and Sanies, cannot be
expelled out of the places of the lungs, and that the cough do stretch the
parts affected. But those that are brought out of the breast, have a triple
advantage more than that which is euacuated out of the lungs. For the substance
of Aspera Arteria, which is altogether dry, and void of flesh, is not found
in any part of a living creature. These that falls in the like, are wont to
be broken, if any other vein or artery be ruptured, the Aspera Arteria
remaining sound, the translation of the blood is by opening of the mouths,
called in Greek Sunanastomasis, so that in such, the blood which comes out,
is neither hot, nor red, nor yet much, and these affectes at the first seem
small, not inducing fear through the great euacuation, but truly they are
hereby the more perilous, for the blood coniealed about the ruptured parts,
which cannot easily pass through Aspera Arteria, lets adglutination.

The ninth Chapter.
IN like sort the wounds of Diaphragma, which are not outwardly, being in
the fleshie parts, are found to adglutinate, for all his motion, but those
wounds that chance in the neruous parts are incurable, yea, truly the
curation also of those that are in the fleshie parts is difficill and hard, if
that they be once inflamed, and this is not only in Diaphragma, but also in
all the parts contained within Peritoneum, because in it Sanies flows, but
we must give diligence to dry them by all ways possible, both by those
medicines which are outwardly put in, but also by those that are taken in at
the mouth, small wine to be given with these medicines, which is called
Diasparmaton, and that which we have in price, which also we use in the breast
that is wounded through, named Diacassia, but both these and also most
medicines, which are outwardly applied to such wounds, are spoken of at large
in the Treatise of medicines. Here we only set out the methodes, which show
the way of remedies. Wherefore if at any time, we add any perticularlie,
thou must suppose we do add it only for perspicuitie sake.

The tenth Chapter.
THerefore let us again repeat the former Methodes, and show how much the
general curation of all ulcers, is particulerly to be changed, according to
the several parts of man. And hereof we shall chiefly learn yt which was
purposed in the whole work, that is, to err so little as may be, in
curations, as an appendix of their audacity, which call themselves
Methodicians, who if you will credit me, I accustom not to speak of
flattery or hatred, they being of all other Physicians most void of Method
do condemn. In that at the least they write, not only of all the ancient
Physicians, but also Hippocrates, him self, author of all Methodes. But the
Emperickes truly, say that all things which have showed to have been found
out by indication, be known to them by experience.

Now seeing that there is not a third instrument of invention, besides
indication, and experience, these using neither of both, yet think themselves
worthy to be called Methodicians: therefore let them follow us, and now at the
least, let them show one way of curing all ulcers, in every member. Let us
hear these good fellows, by what way they will cure an ulcer, and what
indications are taken of it, whether there is any other than ye ulcer which is
plain, to be ciccatrized, that which is hollow, to be filled with flesh, the
green wound, to be adglutinated. But how shall I find that which will
ciccatrize, and that which will incarnate, and that which will adglutinate,
travel not say they, they are alredie invented, but I can not tell whether
rightly, or whether all be found out, it may happen those yt are found out, to
be of the worst, but the better are not yet invented, or else those which are
invented be naught.

And hereof it comes that certain ulcers cannot be cured, either in longer
time with dolor and nedelesse famishing, neither dare any of them go to a new
experience, before he be persuaded that he has rightly condemned the former
way of curing, as in these ulcers of the lungs, which can not be known at all
without the knowledge of the anathomie, and of the actions also which they
utterly abhor. But for this present let us grant that these Thessalians know
the ulcer that is in the lungs. But whether shall we in like case as we have
granted this to them, also grant that they know whether it is filthy, or
pure, or equal, or hollow, or full of Sanies or mattier, or else that they do
know it by divine inspiration, or that they have seen these by dreams, or
shall we grant that, that without the knowledge of these, every medicine is to
be applied, I verily judge that the mattier in filthy ulcers is first to be
purged, and those that be hollow and pure to be filled with flesh, and then
again the mattier and Sanies which is about the Ulcer, to be purged, and then
ciccatrise to be made.

But truly I know now how these have cured such ulcers, for Thessalus has
nothing at all written of these, least he should bewray either his ignorance,
or else inconstancy, for either they speak of these, that which is either not
with reason, or that which is false, or if any will speak truth, it behooves
that he take indication of those ulcers, of the substance of the part, the
situation and form. For admit that they know to discern the ulcer in the
lungs, filthy or pure, with inflammacion or else without: grant we also unto
the^, although of a less thing, yet of this they calling not the invention to
them selves, that such an ulcer is to be mundified with the green medicine of
Macherion, or Isis, all is one. Let them answer me, if the ulcer be in the
lungs, what will they do? will they give any of this green medicine to be
taken inwardly, it is altogether ridiculous, but let them say which way they
know that medicine to be carried into the lungs, but if they might know that,
nevertheless the ignorant knows not whether it reserueth still that virtue
which it had, being outwardly applied to Ulcers, but admit that both they know
this, and that it keeps his force still that it had, being outwardly applied
to ulcers, and that it does purge the filth, yet can they not understand
whether it provoke coughing when as notwithstanding, except the filth should
be expelled by coughing, there is no need of a mundificatiue medicine. But we
will also grant them this thing, but yet they cannot deny, but that they use a
contrary cure, in the Ulcer of the thighs, and Ulcer of the lungs, for they
cleanse the one with water, and mundifie the other by coughing.

Again, imagine the ulcer of the lungs to be compassed with gross mattier,
will they also then give the green medicine, or rather command the pacient to
lick Honey, but let them tell whereby they sound this, truly I will not
answer that because it has a certain faculty of extenuating or cutting,
when as they do fly most willingly from searching out such faculties, but it
is not meet that they should use Honey, as the Empericks do, who by many
observations in the like case, have found Honey to profit, first because they
despise experience, then for that the Emperickes do confess that they know
not what affect is in the lungs, in such like concourse, notwithstanding to
have by experience found out that which may profit, but it is not enough for
Thessalus to cure that which he does not at all know, but he proceeds of the
indication of affects. But if we truly shall grant as before, that he knows
all things as well as our selves, yet can he not escape that, but that the way
of curation is changed in diverse parts of the body, for it is not one way of
curing to make iniection, with Mellicratum, into the matrice in a filthy
ulcer, or to give Honey to be eaten, or to wash the ulcer with a spounge, but
these yet be but of small account, the other of great, let us ymagine an old
Ulcer to be in many parts, without inflammacions, as in the eye, ear, nose,
mouth, thigh, belly, matrice, fundament, and privy members, let it be also,
that the same Ulcer is either plain or wants a little hereof.

Let these These. which have never separated these, answer us how they will
ciccatrize it, forsooth with Diacadmia, for that can well ciccatrize an ulcer
which is in the thigh, but can that also ciccatrise that which is in the ear?
I will declare to you a thing perchance incredible, but yet known to the Gods.
I once found one of these most sapient Thessalians curing an old ulcer in this
sort, when as the ear of the man did putrify, and worms grew in it, for that
it was to soon ciccatrised with Diacadmia, notwithstanding suffering him many
days to use the like medicine, was because the ear did daily more grievously
stincke, and was filled with matter, we see him presume a more incredible thing
than before, for he supposing yt in the depth of the ear, there was
inflammation, he used Tetrapharmacon, which truly must more increase, the
putrefaction of the part, because it cannot exicate the ulcer, but maturate the
inflammation, and when as he had used this medicine one day, to cure the
affect, and thou may know it to be most repugnant, by and by there was a
great deal more matter, and an intolerable stench, wherefore the friends of
the pacient would not suffer the Thessalian, to touch any more the ear, and he
truly of impudency and foolishness, would not only put in some of the
Tetrapharmacon, but outwardly also apply a relaxing emplaister, but when as the
kinsfolk of the pacient drew him away, suspecting the pacient to be in great
peril, I desired them that the Thessalian might have the curation one day
longer. For the next day after, the matter was more abundant, and the stench
most grievous, which day I did assay, whether I might change the mind of the
Thessalian, least he should kill those that were sick: ye forsaken sect, so
far void of all method, might yet save some hereafter, though they be few,
then I began with the fellow in this sort, whether or no said I, seems it
unto thee, that there is an inflammation in the inward part of the ear, and
therefore thou use relaxatiue medicines, and he did stoutly vouch it so to
be, and also that it could not be otherwise: whether or no said I, have thou
seen at any time an Ulcer joined with infla^mation to be cured, with most
sharp Vinegar and Glauces? Never in my life says he, for if any do use the
Trochisce of Andro dissolved in vinegar, he may peradventure cause conuulsion:
Ergo (said I) if one uses another medicine more stronger than the Andronian
Trochisce, in most sharp vinegar, and that to the care, which is a part so
near the brain, and his coats, whether thou being judge, shall he make
conuulsion, and especially if there be inflammation, these things seemed to
be true both to him and to the company present, wherefore in the respect of
the state of the parts, which require such as may chiefelie exiccate, but
now being made tender with the curation, I would use such a medicine.

Now for that thou have abused them many days, it is not meet at once, or at
one brunt, to turn them to the contrary, for it is lawful for thee and
Thessalus to contemn custom, as well as the nature of the parts, but thou
may not so do, but the first day I will use Vinegar with Glaucium, the
second day the Trochise of Andron, and the third day I will go to a more
vehement medicine than the Trochisce of Andro is, and using this three or four
days, if then I shall perceive the Ulcer to require a more vehement medicine,
I will nothing doubt to use it, and outwardly I will apply it to the part of
the head, where the ear is infected, now surely as thou do a relaxing
Cataplasme, but some one medicine that can vehemently exiccate, such a
medicine as is made with Salicen, or else apply Andronean Trochisce with
Vinegar, or some other that does more dry, for seeing the part which we
cure is most dry, it behooves most strongly to dry it, for that the affect
it self may be cured, it shows that the contrary must be applied to the
part it self that it is most like unto, and so as I have said, I wrought and
cured the man without any more vehement medicine. But to certain other which
require more stronger medicines, whereas the Ulcer had infested the ear one or
two years, we applied a medicine more vehement than these rehearsed, and that
was Scorta Ferri, beaten and searced through a most fine Searce, and after
brought as it were unto fine flower, and ofter boiled in most strong Vinegar
unto the thickness of Honey, it is certain that there must be a great deal
of Vinegar in the mixture, but as I have often said, thou must seek thee
plenty of medicines in other of our Commentaries.

Now we have finished that belongs to a method, for seeing the place of
hearing is most dry, it does require medicines that may most vehemently
exiccate, which we may not apply to any other part, but to the vlcerate
part, peradventure the Collirium made of Dialibanoton, unto the nose.

Also it behooves to use that which is more drying than in the eyes, but yet
not so much as to the ears. Wherefore all the Trochisce rehearsed be
profitable, and also the medicine ascribed to Musa, and other of the like
kind. All Ulcers of the mouth if the be moist, requirey vehement exiccatiues,
as Diaphrigis, both alone, and also mixed with Honey, or Wine, or Oximell, and
further, that which is called Iris Anthera, and these either dry, either mixed
with Honey. Also Mulsa is a medicine for these profitable. Also the juice of
Rhois and Omphacine, and other which do strongly dry. What do I tarry in
rehearsing these matters? But the simpler Ulcers of the mouth may aptly be
cured by medicines which do moderatly dry, as these, which for that they are in
continual use, are called Stomatica, such medicines be Diamoron, and of the
fruit of Rubus, and of the juice of green husks of Walnuttes, and yet more
than these, that which is made of Must and Cipresse, and those Ulcers of the
mouth that are very moist, near unto the bones, so that the bones be in
danger to be putrified, these because of the nature of the bones which is
dry, requires most vehement desiccatiues, therefore I do always make fine
the Trochisce aforesaid, and put to these medicines dry.

The xi. Chapter.
FVrthermore, we have before set out the kind of medicines meet for the
bladder, matrixe, and Intestines, and lungs, which you must use in every of
them, taking the kind of the medicine of the substance of the sick part, but
first considering the affect, and taking the way of using them, of the form
and situation, and hereof sprang clisters, for the mouth in Greek called
Otenchitas, and Clisters for the Matrixe, named Metrenchitas and Catheteras,
and the Clisters for other parts. Ulcers in the stomach, breast, and lungs,
are cured by those medicines which are eaten and dronken: the Ulcers in the
Intestines are two ways cured, for those that are next to the stomach, are
cured by those medicines which are eaten and dronken, and those which are lower
in the intestines, are cured by iniections made, when neither that which is
ministered by low by Clisters, can come to those Ulcers that are near unto the
stomach, neither that which is received at the mouth, can in full strength
come to the lower parts, and so the Ulcers in the breast and lunges, are more
hardly cured than those in the stomach, for that they are further off, and
there the strength of the medicine somewhat abated, and for this cause the
medicines received at the mouth, ought to be stronger than those which are
presently applied to the Ulcer, and for that cause the Physicians have
excogitated most strong and cutting medicines, whereas they will purge the
mattier in the breast and lunges, yea verily, such as would ciccatrize the
Ulcer if it were in the stomach.

Also that this is thrown out by coughing, that is taken of the form of the
parts, because these have no such passage, as the matrix, bladder, ear, nose,
and mouth, and hereof comes it, that the stomach may be purged two ways,
upward by vomit, and downward by the stool, for this kind of Indication is
taken of the Isntrumental parts, inasumuch as they be isntrumental, like as
those that are to be exiccated, are taken of the nature of the similer parts
of the affectes themselves again, such as in Ulcers, because our disputation
was of them, but that they are to be dried, as is before set out, and also if
they will purge mattier in the stomach, they cannot without danger provoke
vomit, for if there be fleame fixed in it, to cleanse it by Oximell and
roots, but they shall more safely use deiection when it is perlllous, least
he that vomiteth should tear that is vlcerate, and should attract some ill
juice from the parts adjacent, and for this cause the Ulcers of the lungs are
most hard to be cured, because thou can not purge them but by coughing, and
if thou prouokest the cough, thou tearest the parts, so that the ill by
mutual success, comes to a circle, or as we may term it, made worse, for
those parts which are torn, do again make inflammation, and secondly the
inflammation must be maturated, and the mattier again requires to be
purged, so that of all these the cure is made difficill, both for that those
medicines which are convenient, cannot touch the Ulcers, as they may in the
stomach, and that in the midde way, they loose well near their virtue. And
further, because by respiration they are moved, and are rent by coughing,
wherefore when as any vessel in the lunges is ruptured, if it be not
adglutinated before there comes inflammation, know thou that afterward it is
incurable.

The xij. Chapter.
But the ulcers which are in the inward cote of Aspera Arteria, and chiefly
which are near Larinx, or else in it these may be cured, and we have healed
diverse which were so affected, truly we find the curation of these ulcers,
by this occasion, in the beginning of this great Pestilence (which I pray God
may once cease) a young man who had been sick now nine days, all his body
brake out full of ulcers, which happened well near to all that escaped, and
that day he coughed somewhat, the day following when he had bathed him, he
forthwith coughed more vehemently, and therewith voided a little crust named
Ephelcis, and the man had manifest feeling of an ulcer in Aspera Arteria, that
is in the neck near unto Iugulum, and he also opening his mouth, we looked in
his throat, if that there were any ulcer in it, but we could see none, and
truly the patient should manifestly have felt it, by the going down of the
meat and drink, if any had been there, and we also to be more certain,
made him take certain things with Vinegar and Mustard, but none of these did
bite him, and yet he felt dolor and pain in his neck, in which place he
was so vexed, that he was constrained to coughe, we persuaded him all that
we might, that he should resist it, and not cough, which thing he did, and
that with the more ease. For that which did irritate was little, and we by all
possible means, gave diligence to ciccatrize the Ulcer, applying outwardly
medicines exiccatiues, and he lying upright, we gave him moist of those
medicines, which are good in such like ulcers, bidding him to hold it in his
mouth, and by little and little to let it flow into Aspera Arteria, he so
doing, said he felt manifestly the force of an astringent medicine above the
Ulcer, whether that the force of it by transumption was sent thither, or
whether the medicine it self in form of a dew flows through the Artery, as
it were strained to the Ulcer, the patient himself was void of the knowledge
in Physic, being of the number of those which cure by use, and exercitation
emperiklie.

Therefore he said that he felt both the medicine flow into the artery, and
that it also sometime provoked coughing, but he did much strive and stayed the
cough, and he of his own accord, being taken with ye sickness at Rome,
remained three days after the nine days were past, after taking ship first
he sailed through a River to the Sea, the fourth day after he came by
shipping to Tabia, and used the milk, which has a marvelous virtue, and not
without cause commended. Of which somewhat to speak, the time it self gives
occasion, and not only of that milk we will speak which is at Tabia, but
also of all other milk, neither must we only help those which are in
Italy, but all other Nations as much as we can. Wherefore touching the milk
in Tabia, there do come many things touching his praise, both the place it
self being of sufficient light, and the air compassing about being dry,
and the healthful fodder for the Cattle, and this also may any do by art
in other places, if any show the herbs and shrubbes, in an hill somewhat
high, which may make the milk both astringent and healthful, of which we will
hereafter show examples. But yet thou can not also make the air ambient, in
like sort therefore thou may choose the likest there as thou art.

The air shall be most like where there are such things like it, the height
of the hill moderate, thirty furlong from the Sea, or somewhat more, the place
it self toward the Sea, for Tabia is in the lowest straight which is betwixt
Surrentum and Naplis, but more one the side toward Surrentum.

Furthermore, all that side of the hill is of good bigness, stretching in
length to the Sea Tirrhenum, this hill does a little bend toward the West,
neither goes it wholly toward the South, therefore this Hill does keep the
straight free from the wind which blows from the East, Eurus subsolanus and
Boreas, there is joined to this in the lowest of the straight, another big
Hill, which the ancient Romans in their Hystories, and those also that be
now diligent, call Vesuuium, now Vesuuium is a a famous and new name, and
known to all men, for the fire sent out of the earth in it, which thing does
not as I think, help to the dryness of the air, and that beside the fire,
there is not in all the straight either standing water, marrish, or flood of
any account, this Vesuuius Hill is toward all those winds, which blow from
the North toward the Eastuall setting of the Sun, and much ashes comes from
it, even to the Sea, being the ashes of that burnt in the hill, and of that
which yet is burned, all these make the air dry: surely there may be the
like dry hill in other parts of the earth found, that is not far from the
Sea, neither yet so big, that it is subject to the violence of winds, nor
yet so low, that it shall receive easily the vapors of the fields. Beware
also that it be not toward the North, so should it be auerted from the
Sun, and if it may be in a temperate place of the world as that is which is
at Tabias, it should so much profit, let the herbs in the Hill be these,
Agrostus, and Lotus, and Poligonon, and Melissofillon, the shrubbes, also
Lentiscus, Arbutus, and Rubus, and Hedera, and Cetisis, and such like, and so
have thou the hill prepared. The Cattle that do feed on the Hill at Tabias,
are Kine, and the milk of these beasts is as thick as the milk of Asses is
thin, and I truly least there should be any kind of milk that might
profit, wanting of Kine thick milk, of Asses thin, and of Goats that
which is a mean, I did put in to feed, both Kine, Asses, and Goats, the old
Physicians would have a woman giving milk, to those that are consumed with
Pthoe, to stand and give them suck, unto whose mind I agree, both for that
it is natural, and also for that they would have it taken before it were
refrigerated of the ambient air.

Furthermore, let this be to thee a great precept, that those that shall have
need to drink milk, that the beast standing present, they drink it
presently as it is milked, putting Honey into it, whereas it curdeth in the
stomach, or if thou will have it speedelier to pass into the belly, add
some salt. And the young man that had an ulcer through the Pestilence in Aspera
Arteria, was cured of it, and many other after him.

Another young man of xviij. years in age, when as he was vexed with Catarrhus
many days, first with the cough he voided blood fresh, but not much, after
that, a piece of the pannicle which outwardly covers all Aspera Arteria,
ascending unto Larinx, it seemed to me, coniecturing both by his thickness,
and feeling of the patient to be the inward tunicle of Larinx, but this hurt
not his voice, and this also though in longer time, it was perfectly cured,
but those which come to this affect through the Pestilence, seemed to be very
easily cured, for that his whole body was here purged and dried, for that
many of them did vomit, and all were made laxatiue, so that those which
escaped were purged, they had black Pustules abundantly through the whole
body. In many they were vlcerous, but in all they were dry, and it was
manifest to many that beheld them, that they were the dregs of the blood,
which putrified in the Fever, which as it were like certain ashes, Nature did
thrust out to the skin, like as it thrust out many other superfluities, but
there is no need of Medicines for these Exanthemata, when they fall off by
themselves in this sort, those that had the upper part of the skin
vlcerate, the crust of the ulcer fell off, and the part under it was almost
whole, and after a day or two was ciccatrized, others whose skin was not
vlcerate, the Exanthemata it self was rough and scabbie, and fell away like a
certain scale, and after were cured, therefore it is no marvel though those
that have Exanthemata in the lungs, be cured because of the dryness of the
Ulcers, the which before we have showed, that the purposed scope of curation
in all Ulcers, that in these Ulcers springing through the pestilence, was here
present, for they were all dry and rough, and many of them like to a scab, and
many like Lepria, therefore seeing that Experience testifies with reason, and
that the curation of ulcers have this one end, that is to say, to be
exiccated, you may save many of those that casts forth blood from the lungs,
as we our selves have done.

The thirteenth Chapter.
NOw we have before declared how those shall be cured, that have broken any
great vessel of the lungs, either through falling from high, or yt they
immoderatly did strain them in crying, or did bear a burden above their
strength, or any hard or weighty thing outwardly have fallen on their breast,
but how they may be conveniently cured, which puts forth blood, through
Catarrhus, we shall now declare, putting for more manifest doctrine, a like
example, of that the curation which was done to a noble woman at Rome, when as
she heard such like talk, as we right now had of those, that rejects blood
out of the lungs, and that she had spit out in the night, somewhat either
through Catatrhus, or through coughing, presently she sent for me, promising
her self to be obedient to all things, I would command her, for she had
heard before that time, some yt if one applied not presently strong medicines,
and that before the Ulcer was inflamed, all was in vain, and that this was the
cause of their destruction, which rejected blood, therefore we thought not good
to let her blood, because through the drienesse of her body, she had abstained
four days from meat. But commanded that she should use sharp clisters,
then with some hot medicine, to rub much the thighs and hands, and after to
shave the head, on which I laid the medicine yt is made of Stockdoues dung, and
after three hours, I bathed her, not touching the head with any fat things,
thus I covered the head with a convenient cap, and for that time I nourished
her with supping, after which, I gave her some of the Auster fruits of
Autumn, and when she went to bed, I gave her of Triakle four months old,
and being no elder, it has yet the juice of Popy, somewhat strong, which is
more dull in that which is old, therefore it provoke sleep, and dries
fluxes, and does a little make thick, and the Catarrhe perfectly gone, it did
manifestly appear both by the kind of respiration and noise, that once the
lungs needed purging, by provoking the cough, but that pleased me not. At ye
least the second day, but keeping her in all silence, and rubbing also the
joints, and binding them, I commanded all the other parts of the body to be
rubbed, the head except, which yet was hot by ^e medicine, again at night, I
gave her of Triakls as much as one of our country beans in quantity, and this
was not so much by a great deal, as that she had received the day before,
after that she had also slept well this night, the third day betimes I gave her
largely of boiled Honey, and kept her in quiet, and the day increasing, I as
before did rub all her body, and gave her to eat a Ptisan with a little
bread, ye fourth day betimes, I gave her Triacle, that was old, mixed with
Honey largely, and putting on the woman's head the same medicine, which did
vehemently dry and heat, she being bathed and moderatly nourished, I began
the first day to purge the lungs more vehemently, and after that again and
again, I used the surrup called Diatapsias, and I set all the study about the
body, ingestation, frixion, walking and abstaining from bathing and in diet,
that was both moderate and also of good juice to nourish. This woman was
perfectly well, having no need of milk.

An other young man, when as he had cast up half a pint of blood, through
coughing, which came through distillation, but to the refrigerating the
instruments of brething, presently I let him blood. And the same day twice I
took away blood, and of that same vein, again the day following, I took
blood twice, but using the day before: both rubbing of the joints and binding,
at night we gave him our medicine, called Diasparmaton. The second day after
the other taking away of blood, I applied to all his breast, a cerote called
Diathapsia, taking it away again at night, least that it should to much heat.
The third day again I laid it to three hours, and after bathed him. I did
nourish him in manner aforesaid the third day, the first two days with supping,
the third day first with the juice of Ptisana, after forthwith with some flesh
which was of easy concoction, and simply prepared.

I gave also at night, the second and the third day, the medicine
Diasparmaton, because it does induce sleep, and take away pain, and has
power to exiccate, and when the members of respiration were in their natural
temperature, and all the body empty, and that there was no suspicion of
inflammation about the mixtured place, I began to purge him, after that
drinking Triacle of twenty years old, I sent him to Tabias, and in this sort I
cured all those which came to me the first day.

The xiiij. Chapter.
THose that came after two or three days, the ulcer was not cured in the^ all,
vut in certain, as many as had inflammation so great, that they had a Fever,
of these there was none perfectly cured, but following orderly, all the
helps, that the ulcer might be dried, they did so much that it increased no
more, but being dried, and indurated with Callus, they lived longer. And those
that have an ulcer in the lungs, coming through erosion of ill juice, they
seem all to me to be incurable, of whom some have said, that they feel
their spittle as salt liquour, and that the malice of ill juice, require a
long time or it be corrected, and in time one of these two must of force
follow, either drying the ulcer to make Callus, and so the affect to remain
incurable, or else not drying, it does putrify, and also devour the parts
about it, and so in time the lungs to putrify further, among those that had
ill juice, and thereof did cough, yet not rejecting hitherto blood, by these
our providence were made perfect: at the first it does behooue to be most
careful, that neither the cough, neither that any thing flows out of the
head into the lungs, he shall fly that by a three fold remedy: first by
purging, next by taking Diasparmaton, and last, by having regard to the head.

That which shall purge, must have diverse faculties, to purge diverse kinds
of excrements, of which sort are our Pills, which are made of Aloes,
Scammonie, Colocinthis, Agarice, Bdellium, and gum Arabice, they will also
suffice, which are made without gums, and after if need require, use to purge
black choler. The head shall be provided for with ye cerote called Diathapsia,
and these are at the first to be done. After the Patient is to be nourished
with meats of good juice, friction, walking, and bathing, we will show the
method of these in a convenient place of our work, and surely these are such
as have most need of milk, and those that neglect it, of all other are
incurable, but as concerning letting of them blood, know that those which seem
to have a little blood, being brought, as is said, to some better juice, thou
may let blood, and again restore in like sort. Also to purge, and again
restore, and then again if need be, to let blood, and especially whereas
the mass of blood, is as it were a vicious and gross skin, but those that are
strong, and have much blood, must by and by at the beginning be let blood.

The xv. Chapter.
THere is none of all these, which I have either now, or before declared, that
I have invented or used, according to Hyppocrates way, which is not examined
and approved by judgment, but also tried by experience, in which we suffered
the perilles of the error. They shall have profit by the use of them that have
regard to the works of the art, for some of their talks are true, and some
sophistical, but what speak I of Sophists? when as there are some Physicians
of estimation, which have set out whole volumes of reiection of blood, and have
written many small rules right well, making no mention of any principal
remedy, understanding by little and little, those things which rightly
admoueth the sick to get his health again, in those that are not altogether
desperate, and are cured by letting blood and purgation, and those things which
strengthen the head, and we shall hereafter speak more diligently of
letting blood, when as we shall show the curation of ill juice. Therefore we
must not begin, as many Physicians judge, with small remedies, neither must we
think as they do say, that these small remedies are first to be proved, and
then if they do profit nothing we shall apply greater, this opinion is true in
such diseases as are without danger, but it is furthest from reason, to begin
with small remedies, where the patient must die, if he once have Pthoe. For
like as all other things are rightly set out of Hippocrates, so also is that
Aphorism rightly said, that unto extreme diseases, principally extreme
remedies profit, by what opinion therefore was Erasistratus so mad, so slow
and dull in the beginning of such affects, but after when occasion was past, to
be so diligent, for being persuaded by a most fond reason, he never does let
blood, when as blood is required, nor purges any man, or yet does exicate his
head. From which things if the patient being in danger of that Pthoe, keep
and abstain himself, although all other things be rightly done, I think he
does nothing more, for he refuses to let blood, and does only use to divert
it with binding of the joints, whereby as he himself says, there may remain
plenty of blood against the time of inflammation, and that we be not for want
of it, to nourish ye patient, but peradventure some will say: sir how
Erasistratus? If after the ruptured vein, the inflammation occupies the
lungs, there is no cause why thou shall hope to cure the man, for
considerations which I have set out before. Wherefore he shall now no more
need this travel, being betrayed, or deceived, by thee at the beginning, for
he does like to a governor of a ship, when through his negligence, the ship
is cast away, he gives to some one of the passengers a board in his hand, and
persuades him so to save his life, but Erasistratus, perchance did suppose,
that an inflammation was in the number of those, that necessarily follow a
wound. Notwithstanding if he so thought, he was in great ignorance, when any
man may behold great wounds without inflammation, to be glutinated, of six
hundredth, such as daily do fight a combat, so that the second, or fourth day,
they be in safety, and we have cured many of those, who had some vessels of
ye lungs ruptured, by falling, crying, or stripe, before yt any inflammation
sprang in the ruptured vessel, and if he do affirm any of these, to have
inflammation of the lungs, he does repugne with his own decrees, affirming
both that, and the principal covering, which is next to the heart, to have
inflammation, and also to be free from a fever, also the inflammation being
broken the man to void out nothing. Therefore again, let him hear of us,
that the Ulcer can not be adglutinated, if the lungs be inflamed, and that if
inflammation comes, of force he shall have a Fever, and that when the
inflammation is broken, the patient shall with coughing void mattier.

Therefore if one has never a Fever, or cough, nor voided no Sanies, from the
ulcer, and inflammation, by what reason is there in the lungs of this man any
inflammation. Therefore both this principal remedy is unjustly of him
condemned, and also he lets slip purging, without making mention of it, it
is no medicine of affect, set out of him against any of the forenamed kind of
griefs, but if ye head send down flux, it shall be kept in the same state, or
if that cough follows, through intemperatenesse of the members serving
respiration, that shall also so remain, so that Erasistratus, shall be like
unto the Image maker, who, when the parts were perfectly made and finished, he
left the Image without eyes, for to what beauty I pray you are the other
parts, when as thou want thine eyes. Afterward a Gods name, seeing so
excellent men have erred, that famous man Thessalus, which does not at all know
the art, judges himself worthy to be called a Methoditian, and we see now
almost all his disciples to let blood, not only to many unto whom blood
letting is not profitable, but also to those kind of remedies which ought to
be judged hurtful, especially, if they should stand in their own
suppositions, and also to those that are strong, which reject and put forth
blood, either by vomiting, or coughing, but how shall these hang together, that
both they bid to let blood, where there is rejecting of blood, and that in
their Commentaries they write the remedy, herein to agree with adstrict
diseases.

Now therefore let them call them selves no more Methodicians, but Emperickes.
If setting apart reason, which they thinck to be right, to use only
experience, to the finding out of remedies, are they not in these most clearly
found neither by reason, neither by any Method, to do any thing. Much more
when as they say the parts are unprofitable, to the finding out of the cure.

But if any does call to mind those things which we have taught, of the
Ears, Nose, Eyes, Mouth, Breast, and Lungs, also of that we have said, of the
matrix, bladder, and stomach, he shall find them to err, all the way, such
one was he, that to the inflammation in the secret parts, he applied the
Macedonian medicine, and with this also a relaxing Cataplasme, even that
notable one, that is made of Bread, water, and Oil, also a another like to him
who used the same medicines to the place exulcerate.

But we will speak of such, when we shall dispute of inflammations, but those
Ulcers, which are in the yard, or fundament, without inflammation, require no
relaxing Cataplasme, but a Ciccatrizing medicine, not only of that nature,
that may ciccatize the Ulcers in the flesh, but that they may so much the more
exciccate, as these parts are dryer than the flesh, yea, and that which thou
may more marvel, the Ulcers which are in the end of the yard called Pene,
are more to be dried, and those which are in the neck of the Bladder, called
Cole, and those which are without the end of it, called the Acorne or Glans.

But the Ulcers in the fore-skinne are to be less dried, and yet less than
these, whatsoever are in the skin which covers. Therefore when as one of
these Methodlesse Physicians (I mean these Thessalians) could not cure a moist
Ulcer, in the Acorne, or Glance, with Epulotike medicines, that is with such as
do make a ciccatrize.

He chose me of counsel, and when he heard of me the part required a more
drying medicin, because it was of drier nature, he did forth with believe me, but
being of force constrained to use some of our medicines, ye ulcer was cured in.
3. days, and it did well appear that the Physician rejoiced, not so much in
the health of the patient, as he was sorrowful he was trained up in ill kind
of doctrine, for the medicines used of us which is made of Paper combust,
cures these kind of ulcers, like as Dill and Gourds, being combusted and
strowed upon the grieved part, and used as before, and other like which in like
sort do vehemently dry, and if there be any such ulcer, void of moisture, to
such only Aloes is a convenient medicine, it must be sprinkled in, but dried
and made into most fine powder, and it does also cure well the ulcers of the
fu^dament, with dry Cadmia, washed in wine and dried, has the same virtue, and
Litharge is of like faculty, next in virtue is Molibdena, and Pomphelix, does
less induce dolor than the rest, and is not to any of them inferior.

If the ulcers be moist, both the rind of the Pine tree alone, and also Lapis
Hematites, be very good, and if there be any deepenesse, when as thou will raise
flesh, put to any of the foresaid medicines, so much Manna, as shall suffice
to incarnate withal, neither does this Methodlesse sect, know any of these, so
much as by dreaming, seeing they suppose that every wound, in what part of the
body so ever it be, require one curation, neither how it behooves to cure
certain wounds, as those which do happen to Abdomen, of which in the book
following we shall entreat, with all those which yet do remain.

FINIS.
THE SIXTH BOOK of Galen, called in Greek (...), and in Latin, Methodus
Medendi.
The effect of the same.
1 The curation of the Nerves contused, and the tendons vulnerated. 2 The
curation of wounds which are in Peritoneum. 3 The curation of the inward wounds
of Peritoneum which reach to Abdomen and Omentum. 4 The curation of the affects
which chance to the bones.
The first Chapter.
I Nothing doubt but that there be many, unto whom I do seem prolix, in
that I have hitherto set out, how by a method one kind of disease may be
cured. It is truly meet, that they do not so much impute the length of them
unto me, as unto these, who little understanding such things, as Hyppocrates
most truly has written, do unjustly go about to reprehend them, who as I
have showed, do not know how to cure rightly an ulcer, much less then, that
which is greater, and that one kind of disease, in which an ulcer is numbered.
It skilleth not whether you call it solution of continuitie, or unity, which
now is showed, and the method of curing it, in what member of the body so ever
it be, keeps the common Indications, which are taken of the affect, but
those that be taken of the parts will have other affectes. When this happens
in the fleshie parts, it is called an ulcer, and has indication of curing,
which is common to all affects against nature, yt is, the affect it self,
which as it is an affect, is to be taken away by his contrary, as division by
unition, for the generation of this affect consists in division of unity,
and therefore in the bone it is called a fracture, in Greek Catagma, in the
neruous pannicles Spasma, in the muscles, a ruption, whose differences are
before set out, yet to this disease when as it happens in a vein or artery, it
has no proper name, but borrows sometime the name of an ulcer, sometime of a
wound, and sometime of a ruption, but we have often said, that he ought not
to be so careful for the names, whose scope is, to find out the knowledge of
things. Therefore neglecting names, let us rather have hither, seeing that
health to the patient comes not of exquisite imposition of names, but through
convenient remedies: again, let us call to mind this most impudent Thessalus,
which setting out no method of curing an ulcer, supposes that he has showed
them all, for very idiots do know, that an hollow ulcer must be filled, and a
simple wound adglutinated, yet does not the vulgar people know by what method
he may find medicines, wherewith that which is hollow may be filled, or that
which is simple may be adglutinated, and that is put out to be considered of
the Physician, in which one excels another, for as we have heretofore said,
who that is excercised in the curatiue method, shall both find out remedies,
and also use rightly such as are already invented.

The second Chapter.
ANd that we may now set out any thing yt may hence forth agree with that is
before set out, let us feign one to come unto us, who has only his skin
pricked with a needle, if this man be such a one, in whom ulcers will easily
be healed, if thou let him go to his accustomed labors without medicine, yea,
ye member being also bare, he shall taste of no ill, but if he be such a one in
whom ulcers will hardly be cured, then the member will first ache, then have a
pulse, and also inflammation, but the Emperike shall learn the nature of the
patient, by examining and questioning, we truly by such examination, using al
these things which are found out by experience, and nothing the less by those
signs, which we take of the natures of good and ill juice. And furthermore, of
those which be of quick or dull feeling. Moreover, of those which are
burdened with fullness, or have but little juice, being not ignorant that he
shall be oppressed with inflammation, which is either Plethorique, or have evil
juice, the Greeks call them Cacochymci, or is of quick feeling, or vexed with
some of these, or else with all, and that he that is contrary shall feel no
hurt, and we beholding these things, will not put to adglutinatiue. Such are
many of their medicines which are called Enema, and be presently applied to
green wounds, but a soft medicine and gentle, and that shall assuage dolor,
but when as there is a great division, there we must bend our study yt the
lips of the wound, may be united and closed with desiccatiues, and where the
division is made with a needle or steel, there regard must chiefly be had,
that the part be not vexed with inflammation, and hereof it is manifest, that
the indication of a green wound set out of Thessalus, does hitherto teach us
no more than every private person knows, for it is no great matter to know
what behooves to be done, being a thing naturally grafted in all men, but
to know how thou shall perform it, that only does belong to Artists, for if
any should build a ship, we all know (yea, being no Shipwrights) in what place
the things which govern the ship are to be placed, in what place the starne
must be, and where the beke should stand, and all the rest, yet all these
profit us nothing, being ignorant how the ship is to be builed. In like sort,
he that goes about to build an house, is not ignorant, that the foundations
of the walls are first to be laid, neither that the walls set on these, or
that are to be erected, ought to be directly right, neither that the roof
must be set on these walls, neither that the windows, doors, and other
parts of the house must be accordingly placed, but what does these things
help to the building of a House, insomuch as he being ignorant in the art
of building, knows not how to build it. Therefore it seems sufficient unto
Thessalus, of all other men most sapient, touching an artificious knowledge, to
understand what ought to be done, but we have showed in these Books before
written, that this is but a certain beginning of those works which are looked
for of the Artists, being no proper part of the art, but such as is common to
all men, for the first indications in every art, are naturally grafted in
all men.

Wherefore if this be sufficient to make Artists, what lets but we may
build ships, and make matter, and all men may readily make shoes, and
garments, and houses, and also to be Architectistes, Musitions, and
Rethoritions, but it is not so, neither is he a Physician, that knows how
that there must be made natural union in the wounded part, but he which
understands with what things that may be done, although that this is not
enough, if he knew not how to use them, but he only is a Physician, who
knows all the way so far, until he may attain his desired scope.
Therefore it happens to these methodlesse Disciples of Thessalus, that
presuming great things above their might, they attain not unto those, which
otherwise they might. For when one lately was wounded with a Style in the
hand, in such sort, that all the skin being divided, some of the nerves
under was pricked, a sapient Thessalian in the beginning applied an emplaister,
which he often used with good success in great wounds, he thought (I suppose)
that every wound had one curation, but an inflammation following, he applied
a Cataplasme, which is made of wheat flower, and so rotting the member, killed
him within seven days. Neither can it be numbered how many have perished by
conuulsion, happening into their Peoman hands. Whereby if God will, this
Thessalians decree may be kept, and every green Ulcer is like to be healed,
and that the parts affected giving no indication. But the true method is not
as this methodlesse method of Thessalus, but even now, and that after so great
Physicians, there may be found, not only better medicines than have been,
but also a universal way of curing, for no man using presently at the
beginning those medicines which we have invented, sell into conuulsion, for I
truly noted whereof a nerve was, and how there follow of necessity greater
dolor than in other parts, because it has sharpness of feeling, and that
also of force there follows inflammation, except one did assuage the dolor,
and let the generation of inflammation.

Therefore it seems reasonable to me, that the wound of the skin be kept
open, and without glutination, whereby the mattier may flow out of the wound,
and then to unburden the body of all superfluities, and chiefelie to be
careful that the wounded part be free from dolor, so I have excogitated not
a few medicines, which being applied to the wound, does meruailouslie serve
both uses, both to mittigate dolor, and to make way to the coming out of the
mattier, and it shall be more sure if the skin be wider cut, and that the
body be emptied by blood letting, if the Patient be strong. And if the body
be full of ill humors, presently purge him, and warm water, (although it
does much mittigate other inflammations,) it is most hurtful to wounded
nerves, seeing their substance is made of a moister mattier refrigerated and
coniealed, and all such constitution is resolved, and does putrify by those
things which do both make hot and moist, therefore I kept those which were
thus wounded from warm water, judging it meeter to foment the place with warm
oil, because that I have also showed, that oil being applied cold, does
stop the small pores, but if it be hot, it does digest.

Furthermore, I fled also crude oil, called in Greek Omotriues, and that
which had an astringent faculty, and those which was most thin, as Sabinum,
which if it be two or three years old, is the more profitable, for because
that which is old, does more digest by euaporation than that which is new, and
how much elder it is, so much it is able to digest, but yet it does less cease
dolor in medicines. All my whole scope was to have their faculty attenuated,
and moderatlie heating, and which might exiccate without inducing of dolor,
seeing that this only could draw the mattier from the bottom, the part
being thereby neither contracted nor yet bitten. Truly I first used Turpentine
and Rosen both alone, and mixing with it also a little Euphorbium, I used it
alone in Children and Women, and generally in soft bodies, but with
Euphorbium in hard bodies: in like sort also Propolis, both alone, and
softning it also with Euphorbium, and if it were more hard with some thin oil.
I use also in hard bodies Sagapenum, mixing it with oil and Turpentine, and
after the like sort also I use Apoponax, even as I do Sagapenum. Also
Lachrima, Epreniaca, is not unprofitable, if one make an emplaister of it, in
such sort as we have made with Euphorbium, but we have not approved this by
experience, as we have done all the other, for it behooves that the invention
of remedies which comes from a true method, does go before, and then
experience for the more certainty to follow this, and we hope that by the same
Method. Also Sulphur which has not touched fire, nor is stony, but of thin
parts, shall profit him that is wounded in the neruie parts, mixing so much
of it with thin oil, as that it come to the thickness of Sordium, or as you
would say, rotten mattier which comes out of a sore, and in strong and hard
bodies thou shall profit if it be as thick as Honey, for that is also allowed
by Experience, we have also excogitated, to apply to this wound washed Lime
mixed with thick Oil, which if it were washed with the Sea water, it would
more profit, it is best to wash it in the dog days, and if thou do wash
it three or four times, the medicine is the better, but in what manner such
medicines are to be prepared, thou shall understand in our Commentaries which
we have set out of the composition of Medicines. And it is here sufficient for
me to show that I have invented both these, and many other medicines against
the wounds of Nerves, seeing that I never saw them used under any Master,
neither yet see them set out in any of the old Books of curing, or in the
Books of the faculties of the ancient Physicians, but I took indication of
the nature of things, which I think to be the office of the Physicians which
uses a Method.

But this wonderful Thessalus, when he never yet invented one medicine, does
affirm, that even now the matter of them to be known, but the matter of many
medicines, which we have excogitated, is not only unknown to Thessalus, and
the Physicians before his time, but unto those which has been since, until
this day. For I in times past being called unto one, which was made rotten of
these methodelsse Thessalian Physicians, and beheld that he would apply that
Cataplasme which is made of Wheat meal, having no other medicine present, I
asked of a certain Potter, neighbor to the patient some lee, and by boiling
it in Barlie meal, and not in oil and water, as he did the Wheat meal, I
applied it. After which, in like sort, the meal of Eruum boiled, I applied it
to the nerve, the inflammation being inflamed and rotten, by the good cure of
these Thessalians, I delivered the Patient from the same putrefaction. But of
these wounds which putrify with inflammation, we will largely dispute in a
convenient place of this work, and that is now said is sufficient for wounded
nerves. And truly among those medicines which we have found out, many do
use that emplaister which is made of Euphorbium, Wax, and molten Rosen, and so
to make a composition thereof, and some suppose it to be my invention, but I
made it so at the first, and peradventure some mixed with it Flos Salis, or
such like things, which might alter the choler, and not diminish the virtue of
the medicine, but through ignorance one may add such like things, that shall
change the virtue of it. But we made it of Wax, Rosen, Turpentine, Pitch, and
Euphorbium, putting in one part of Wax, of Turpentine, and Pitch, of each,
half a part, so that the quantity of these two, may be more than the Wax,
or you may mix the one of these with the Wax, and also in the scarceness of
Turpentine, you may aptly use Humidum pineam, that is to say, moist Perrosen,
and also to put into these Abietenam, but Scrobilina, is only meet for hard
bodies, wherefore it is not to be mixed for soft bodies, therefore if thou
do mix Humidam resinam, then put that in thy Euphorbion beaten and searced,
to the other being molten, let the weight of it be the twelfth part of the
wax, or a little more, when as thou determinest to make the medicine stronger,
but if it be dry as Fucta is, then the Euphorbion desires a little oil,
wherefore I beating it with oil, and making it to thickness of Honey or
Sordium (which is thick mattier) the other after the melting being cold, I
do mix them, stirring them together.

Also I often mix in making the medicine so much water as may quite euapour
away and be consumed, in melting the mixed simples. But all this kind do
most appertain to the treatise of compounding medicines. Now it suffiseth as
before we have done, to put for examples sake, a few particularly, showing
what the kind of medicine ought to be, for thou shall find in our work, De
simplicibus medicamentis, a copious matter of medicines, and you must prepare
them, as I showed in the work of their compositions. Wherefore it is sufficient
to have declared thus much, and to pass forth to other things.

The curation of the wounded Nerve, does require medicines which may provoke a
moist heat, and do strongly dry, and that also by the substance of their
making, has power to attract, and is of thin parts: truly the curatiue
method, does not only profit to the invention of medicines and diet, but also
to the use of these which are invented, for like as before we have declared, so
now also we do affirm, that he which goes about to find apt medicines for
an Ulcer, without a method, cannot use the least of them rightly. For he is
able to cure by a certain Method, who understands how much the application
of the medicine, has either dried the affect, or made hot, or mittigated, or
increased, for he only does know how to add unto those which he used at the
first, or to take away from them. For when one had applied at the first to a
wounded Nerve Dia Euphorbion, or that he had luckely before made proof of it,
he showed me how the third day that the wounded part had dolor and
inflammation, maruailing that the medicine did nothing profit, I then asked the
patient, whether the first day when the medicine was applied, he felt not a
soft heat, as it were of the Sun, and he denied to have felt any such thing.
Then again, I asked the Physician, how long he had that medicine by him
prepared, and when he had cured with it, he answered, that he had it a year,
and had cured with it two children, and a young man, and when I demanded of
the body of the young man: he affirmed that it was white, and soft, when I
heard these things, perceiving that there lacked Euphorbium, for this young
man's temperature.

I demand the Emplaister, and also Euphorbium, and taking of both, so much as
I thought sufficient to mix them together, I bad him soften the medicine with
his hands, and so beat the Euphorbium diligently, and these being done, I bad
him mix them together, and I making somewhat hot, Oil of Sauine, which was
old, and foment therewith the wounded part. And opening lightly the puncture
which was close, I did put the medicine into the hole, and willed him to
abstain from meat. I bad also the Physician, that when he did take it away at
night, that he should use the oil in like sort as he had seen me. And these
being observed, the day following the affected part, was found void of dolor
and inflammation. And all they that were present, understood that to be most
true, (that we often say) the medicine can do no great thing, except there be
one, that can rightly use it. For the right use is that, which proceeds by
the same Method, which we have often set out in the books going before.

All the use of medicines being referred unto it, cold, moist, and dry, as
unto certain rules, which Method these Methodlesse followers of Thessalus,
are not able rightly to follow, neither yet Erasistratus, or any other
Phisitio^, which has not sought out the Elements of bodies, or has put out
other things than those which we have here comprehended.

The third Chapter.
BVut if the Nerve be not pricked but cut, you must consider in what sort it is
wounded. Whether it be cut overthwart, or in length: and also how much of it is
divided.

Let us first put for an example that there is so great division of the
skin, that the bare Nerve does appear, and that this Nerve is cut in length,
and not overthwart, thou shall not apply to this Nerve any of the rehearsed
medicines, which are made of Euphorbium, or sharp medicines of like kind.

For the bare nerve cannot now abide their force, as when the skin was
betwixt it and the medicine. Therefore use thou in this case washed Lime
dissolved in much oil, and also Diapompholix is very profitable dissolved in
a great quantity of oil of Roses, and it shall be the better, if both the
Oil of Roses, and also the oil to be without Salt, for all the scope of
curing the Nerve being bare, is to exiccate without biting, and truly there
be few medicines which can so work. Therefore in this case in the Summer let him
be washed in healthful fresh water, let also the Pompholix be, (as is before
said) washed, because it has many other simples, which are not washed. For
all medicies which consist of mettalles, ought to have all these washed, if
they shall exiccate without mordication.

That is also an healthful medicine, which is made of Honey Plaster wise,
being made of the best Honey, and this be resolved in oil of Roses, which in
all respects is the best, and void of Salt, yea, and the Wax also which is
put into such medicines must be washed in like sort. If thou put in any
Turpentine, it behooves that thou wash it, and so much the sooner if thou put
any other Turpentine in, for the sharp and biting Sanies is washed and purged
away by all medicines which thou do wash. But if he that is wounded be
strong in body, and void of superfluous excrements, in him it is requisite to
use more strong medicines. As I once did, when as a young man studious in
Philosophy was wounded in the breast, having a good strong body, and burnt
with the Sun in the Summer season. The Trochifce of Polida dissolved in Soap,
and afterward made warm, being put over hot water, I applied it as a
Liniment. For that first of all we must have regard that nothing be cold
which touches the wound. For because the affected part is most sensible, and
also the chief of the principal parts are continual, and of temperament
cold: by which all occasions that is grieved is with cold, and sends also his
greiefe to the brain. But if it be of these yt come into the muscles, it
causes also conuulsio^. For we have showed in our Anathomie, that the muscles
are the instruments of voluntary motion, and the like conuulsion shall be
looked for in the tendons, by the same causes, but when as I had applied the
foresaid medicine to the wound of this young man, and had covered much of the
parts above the wound, with the same I did continually foment with hot oil
the parts about the arm pits, neck, and head, and opening a vein, the first
day I took some blood from him, and the fourth day this young man also was
well, insomuch as the ulcer looked wrinkled, small, and shrunk together,
notwithstanding I thought good to continue with the same medicines until the
seventh day, after which day he was perfectly well. Truly you may foment
this wound with oil, and chiefly as we have said, when it is cured, for oil
is of contrary nature to the Trochisce, and makes the Ulcer filthy, neither
is there small difference to apply oil to a bare nerve, and where the skin
covers it.

Therefore the mattier is to be wiped away from the wound with a probe, having
soft lint rolled about it. You may if you will, wet your Lint in Sapa, least
that thou touch the Ulcer with drith: with Sapa, that is, Sirium, called also
with us and in Asia, Hepsama, therefore dipping thy lint in this, and after
pressing it out, thou shall mundifie the Ulcer, and let this Sapa be warm the
first days chiefly, but if all things do prosperously succeed, thou may wet
it also without danger with sweet Wine, for all sweet wine is void of all
biting quality, such is the wine called Thereum and Scybelites. And next these
is, Carginum, what Wines so ever are sweet and yeolowish, such is Falcrun
being unprofitable, for all these are sharp and unmeasurable hot. And the
ulcer coming now to ciccatrize, white and thin Wine, and that which will not
abide the mixture with water, neither sweet smelling, is better than sweet
wine, and thou shall eschew the use of water to a wounded nerve, and also a
relaxing Cataplasme: next unto the use of these Trochisces, is the use of
Diachalciteos, which we openly use, this must be molten in Su^mer with oil of
Roses, but in winter with the Oil of Sauine, we have described this medicine
in the first book of compounding medicines, the Pastilles, or Trochisces, or
call them how you list of Polyda, are known to all men, which if you have not,
you may take the Trochisce of Andro, or Pasio, or else our own, which is
stronger than the rest.

And we have declared that to strong bodies, strong medicines are convenient,
as to tender bodies, gentle medicines: this right Method have I invented, and
experience does confirm it, but Thessalaus with his Sophistes, sitting in his
high throne, shall be had in reputation among brute people, as Cercidas says.
While he confirms by his reasons, that there is one curation of green
wounds, neither this to require any Indication to the nature of the parts, yet
one of so great same in his learning has excogitated, a marvelous cure of
wounded Nerves, for presently he cutteth them a sunder, giving the wounded man
no warning thereof, although in this he goes from his sect, for it had been
better to cut a sunder the wounded muscles and arteries, and veins, or any
other thing, but not the Nerve, otherwise that thing which they fly, they are
found to do, that they may take a contrary indication, for the difference of
the parts: but let us leave them, and entreat of a Nerve wounded overthwart,
in which there is greater fear of conuulsion, inflammation coming of Fevers,
which are not cut, but those which pertain to the cure of the Ulcer, are like
also to these. Yet it behooves more largely to take away blood, and use more
thin diet, and to keep him altogether quiet in a soft bed, and to foment
largely with hot Oil, the arm pits, neck, tendons, ligaments and head, and
if the wounded Nerve be in these, that are in the legs, like as we used Oil
to the arm pittes, when the wound was in the hand, so in these the flanks are
largely to be fomented with Oil, and so to ascend, by the whole spine, to the
neck, and head. And the contused Nerves, whereas the skin also is contused
and wounded, require the same medicines which is used in drying the wounds of
the Nerves. But yet such medicines as may further draw and constringe or bind
the parts divided by contusion: but those which are contused without the like
affect of the skin, ought to be fomented often with hot Oil, which have
power to euaporate, and to have like regard to the whole body, as I saw this
to happen, and did spedely cure it, fomenting it with oil, but have often
seen the Nerves, to be contused with the skin, and the wrestlers for the
custom of the accident, being taught by use, have a Cataplasme made of Oximell
and Bean flower, which truly is an healthful medicine, but if dolor also
comes with contusion, it does behoue to put in molten pytch, and boil them
well together, and so to apply the medicine hot, and if thou will make it more
drying, put in the flower of Eruum, and if thou will have it yet more drying,
put in Iris ilirica, the regard to be had to the whole body, it is common to
these, as if the Nerve be all cut, there rests after no peril of conuulsion,
but yet ye part shall be weak, it has the same cure, that the other Ulcers
have, although the Thessalians know but one: therefore we have abou^dantly
entreated of Nerves, but how we shall cure the inflammation that comes to
them, we shall set out when as we shall entreat of Phlegmone.

The fourth Chapter.
Seeing that the ligaments (called in Greek Syndesmous) be of like kind to the
tendones, they can suffer the force of most vehement medicines, because they do
not come to the brain, and be void also of feeling, for all the Nerves come
either from the brain, or else from the marow in the spine of the back, the
tendones also as we have showed their substance, is compounded of the Nerve,
and Ligament, they so far forth spring from the brain, as they participate
of the substance of the Nerve. But yet are less vexed with co^uulsion than the
Nerves.

But the ligaments forsooth, seeing they spring of the bone, those that are
round, are like unto Nerves, but differ from them much in hardness, yet in
that they are white without blood, and not hollow, and divided into Fibers,
they are like the Nerves and tendones, so that they which are ignorant in the
Anatomy, when as they see the round ligaments and tendones, they take them for
Nerves, and chiefly they which understand not that they are harder than ye
Nerves, but where they are broad, there they know them to differ from Nerves:
But they cannot discern the^ among them selves, but thou which know the
natures of all their parts, and also their form, and in what place they are,
in the whole body, and in what part of the body it happens a wound to be
made, thou do presently understand whether it be a Nerve that is wounded, or
a ligament or tendon.

If the ligament wounded be such one, as goes from bone to bone, it is
chiefly without danger, and that thou drying it with all kind of
desiccatiues, shall not any thing hurt the patient, but if it goes into the
muscle, how much it is less dangerous than in the Nerve and Tendon, so much
the more it ought to be feared, if it be not rightly cured, and none of these
can be brought to pass, by a method of these Physicians, which deny the
indication that is taken of the part, to be profitable to the curation of
Ulcers, neither yet of such as do confess this, if they be ignorant in the
nature of every part, which as we have showed, consists of the temperament
of Elements. But although these know no other thing: yet at the least they
understand that they are showed of the constitution of the isntrumental parts.

Thessalus, truly and his Disciples, are also very ignorant herein, as if
Abdomen were now presently wounded, so deep, that some intestine came forth,
they know nothing at all how it ought to be put in, and if Omentum fall out,
whether it is to be cut away or not, or whether it is to be trussed up or no,
or whether the wound must be stitched or not, or if it be stitched, in what
wise it ought to be done, neither should we have understood these things, if
we had not learned by reason of the Anatomy, the nature of all the parts
therein contained, which truly to declare, is a thing necessary, not only for
the better understanding that shall follow: but also for probation, the skin is
most outward, of all this, and is ended in a thin pannicle called Membrana,
within the skin, as it was in the mid place there is a double neruous
thinness of the Muscles, which the Grecians call Aponeurosin, stretched out in
manner of coats or membranes, many Anatomistes are ignorant, that they be two,
when as they so cleave and join together in such wise, as it requires labor
to separate them, and also for that they are most thin: next these
immediately follows two right and fleshie muscles, which stretch from the
breast to Ossa pubis, and all these rehearsed, clean and grow together, and
that which is made of these, the Grecicians which have set out the way, when ye
stitching of Abdomen, ought to be made, called Gastroraphias, named
Epigastrion, that is to say Abdomen, that which is next these, is called
Peritoneon, and they thought it to be one simple body, but falsely, seeing
that it is made of two bodies, both which are without blood and Neruous, but
one of these Neruous thin pa^nicles belongs to those muscles, which go
overthwart: the other being very thin like a cobweb, is the true Perotineum,
and Abdomen, is such a like thing in the midst of it self, the parts of it
which are distant, and on both sides, as it were four fingers breadth, at the
side even from the skin have the oblike muscles, the former which came from
the breast, the next which ascend from the intestines, and after these muscles,
that which is overthwart. Under which is Peritoneum, therefore there is less
danger in this place, than in the midst, seeing it has no such thin coat
or pannicle, and that they call Aponeurosis, and that stitching may hardly be
made in the midst, because that chiefly in this part, the intestines goes
out, and may hardly be put in, and the muscles that did constrain and draw
them, be the right and fleshie muscles, which I said came from the breast to Os
pubis, therefore of force the intestine comes out through two causes, as often
as any of these be wounded from the parts which are on the side, because
that is gathered together by the muscles, which are there from the middle
parts, because the muscle which should contain them is not strong enough, and
that the place is very apt for coming forth, and if the wound be greater,
then of force more Intestines must fall out, and are more hardly put in again.

Furthermore, for another cause, small wounds are hard to be handled, for
except that which comes out be presently put in his place again, it is
inflamed, and rises in tumor, so that it cannot be put in by so straight an
hole, therefore in such wounds, the mean hole is less dangerous, and it is
truly necessary to know these things: then it follows next, that we
consider how one shall most conveniently handle these kind of wounds, for
Thessalus precept, which thinks these wounds to be glutinated with
medicines called Enema, does serve so little to the purpose, that I think it
more manifest that it should be unknown to any, having his wit, therefore
first of all, seeing we must do that that the Intetestines which are fallen
out, be put in again into their place: secondly, that the wound be
stitched: thirdly, that thou apply a convenient medicine, and last to regard
that most worthy to be affected.

Go to now, let us speak of the first, seeing therefore there is as is said,
a three fold difference of these wounds in bigness, let us attempt to take of
every of them a proper Indication: admit that in the beginning the wound be so
small, that the Intestine which fell out being inflated, cannot again be put
in, whether or no in this, is one of the two necessary, either to get out the
inflation, or to enlarge the wound, the first is better, I suppose, if it may
be done, and thou shall do this no other way than by removing the cause
which brought the inflatio^, but what cause is that? truly the refrigeration
of the air ambient. Wherefore the cure must proceed of heating things,
therefore it shall be convenient to heat the Intestine with a hot Sponge
put in hot water, and afterward expresseed out, and in the mean time to
prepare auster Wine, made hot, for that does more heat than water, and
strengthens the Intestine, but if the inflation of the Intestine cease not
by this means, thou must cut so much of Peritoneum, as is enough to put in the
Intestine convenient Instruments, for this Incision, are Springotoma, (that is
to say, such as serve the Incision of Fistulas. Knives which are double edged,
or have sharp points, are to be refused: the convenient placing of the
Patient is, when the wound is made in the lower part, if he lie upward, and
when it is in the upper parts, if he lie backwarde, in both these one thing
is to be regarded, that the Intestine which is out, be not pressed of those
that are within, and that shall this way be done, as if the wound be in the
right side, to bend the body to the contrary part, if in the left, then to
the right side, in such sort, that the wounded part alwaie be higher than
the rest, and this is profitable also both in great and mean wounds, for that
is a common advice in all.

But the reposition of the Intestines into their place, when as they are fallen
out in a great wound, does verily require a perfect minister, for he ought to
compass outwardly all the whole wound with his hands, and to press
inwardly, and to gather together, and to leave the place bare, to him that
stitcheth it, and also to compass moderatlie that which is stitched, until
all the wound be stiched.

Now we will next teach the aptest way of stitching such wounds in Abdomen,
because it behooves that Abdomen do close and join with Pentoneum: you must
begin from the skin, and thrust the needle from without inward, and when as
it has gone through both the skin, and the muscle called Rectum, leaving
that Peritoneum which is under it, thou shall from within thrust thy needle
outward by the rest of Peritoneum, and so by the rest of Abdomen, putting the
needle from within outwardly, and when it has gone all through this again,
this Abdomen is to be thrust through from without inwardly, and when thou have
left that Peritoneum which is under, and come to the contrary part, thou
shall also thrust this through from within outwardly, and with all the
Abdomen, that is, next after this begin here again, and stitching it with
the Peritoneum of the contrary side, and again putting it through the skin,
next the needle is to be put in that part inwardly, and stitching that
Abdomen, with the contrary Peritoneum, and again going through the skin, and
thus again and again till it be done, and until the whole wound be stitched,
the space betwixt the stitches ought to be most small which pertain to the
keeping fast of those parts, which be under, but this smalnesse is not sure
inoughe to the strength of the skin, and keep it from breaking, which is the
spaces betwixt the stitches, wherefore eschuing the excess of both, let us
choose a mean betwixt both, and this also is, as it were a common thing in all
wounds, that is, the substance of the thread it self, wherewith we stitch,
for that which is too hard, must of force tear the skin, that which is to
soft is presently broken, in like sort if thou do thrust thy needle
through the edges of the wound, the rest of the skin being most little, is
constrained to tear, when it is violently brought together, but if thou go
far from these, thou leauest much of the skin vnglutinated, and although
these things be common to all wounds, yet they are especially to be eschued
in the stiting of Abdomen, and the stitching of Abdomen ought to be done this
way rehearsed, for if any do suppose that he may make Peritoneum to close
with Abdomen, but it will scarcely grow with him, because it is neruous, or
else as many use, which join them together that be naturally of affinity,
as Peritoneum to Peritoneum, and Abdomen to Abdomen, and that shall be in this
sort, it behooves to begin of the Abdomen next us, and from without inwardly,
to thrust a needle through it only, and letting pass both sides of
Peritoneum, of the contrary part, from without inwardly draw the needle
through both lips, after put that back again, and thrust it from within
outwardly, through the contrary Abdomen, this way differs from the common
and usual stitching, which at once thrust the needle through four sides,
because it altogether hides Peritoneum under Abdomen.

Now let us speak of medicines, truly those ought to be of the same mattier
that they are, which are named Enema, which we have in the books going before
showed, to unite the wound of other parts: ligature outwardly, is chiefelie
here necessary: the last part of the curation in these, differs much from
the other, for the space betwixt the flanks and arm pittes, ought to be
wholly covered with soft Wool dipped in Oil moderatlie hot, and yet more
sure, if thou put in by a Clister into the Intestines some such like thing, and
if any of the Intestines be wounded, that which is outwardly to be done,
must be performed in manner aforesaid, but that which is iniected must be
auster, and red Wine blood warm, and so much the rather, if it be pierced
through to the inward parts. And the thick Intestines are easily to be
cured, as on the contrariwise those that be thin, be hard to be healed,
yet Ieiunium is altogether incurable, both for the bigness and multitude of
the vessels, and also for that his coat is very thin and neruous.

Further, because this Intestine receives all the pure color, and is next
the liver of all the rest. And thou may boldly cure the wounds of the
stomach, which are in the lower fleshie parts, for it may happen to take good
success, not only for that these parts are thick, but also for that the
medicines which do cure, do easily rest in this place.

But the wounds which are in the mouth of it and in Gula, inioye but only
the medicines which touch them in the going down, and the sensiblenesse
hinders also the cure of those which are in the mouth of the stomach. But it
is easier to learn the way which he used in curing of the wounds in ye
stomach, than other deadly wounds, for I took not in hand to write these
works, for that intent I would not any man should not read Hyppocrates
books, but for that he seems to me first to use a convenient way, and yet
not wholly to have finished it, when as certain things are not yet limited,
and we may find other which are setre forth of him obscurelie and imperfect,
therefore I have studied to open all those things cleerelie, and to make
distinction where they were smallie divided, and to supply where as wanted.
Therefore whereas any has first of all exercised himself in these our
Commentaries, let him apply himself to the reading of Hyppocrates Books, and
let him both read his book of Ulcers, and also that which he wrote of mortal
Wounds, then truly he shall receive great help of these our Books, and
also shall understand that none of the Mothoditian sect, which challenges to
himself this glorious Title, but in very deed be furthest from a method,
can rightly cure an ulcer or wound, and also that none of the Emperikes, which
think to exercise the art, little knowing the Elements or temperamentes of
the similer parts of man, for these know not the rational cure of the
similer parts of man, because they only take their Indications of the
organike members, wherefore a few words hitherto uttered, against these
Methoditians, of those wounds which happen in the Stomach, we will convert
our style to other things. Peritoneum being wounded, Omentum does presently
fall out, which whether it be similer or no, or of which it is made, or what
action or use it has, they do not understand: therefore it is worth the
travail, to hear what they will do, whereas that part which is fallen out
of his place being swart and black, whether will they cut it off, or put it
again within Peritoneum? Surely either they shall understand all together by
Experience what is to be done, or else take Indication of the nature of the
part, but both these flies from them, both that knowledge which is ministered
by Experience while they extol a method, being the reverend name of their
sect, and that which is taken of the nature of the part, for that they know
not his substance, nor action, nor use of it, while they abhor the Anatomy,
as a thing unprofitable, therefore they know not whether it be any of the
parts necessary to life, or else not necessary, although these are not the
least to be known, neither whether through the affect of it, any of the
principle members shall be molested: or otherwise also, whether any of the
vessels or parts within it contained, may kill the man by flux of blood,
neither whether that which is black being cut away, that which is sound may
be tied, whereby the flux of blood may be eschued, or whether that may be
to any, dangerous, for that Omentum, even at the first sight, seems
neruous, so that one know the nature of it perfectly, he durst not for fear
of conuulsion bind it, but since these wonderful Methoditians know not of
these things, they cannot tell what is to be done when as Omentum is waxed
black, but I think we know, which understand that the use of it is not so
great for man, and that his substance is composed of the thin pannicles,
arteries, and veins, we will eschew the flux of blood, and will not fear by
consent, that the nerves shall be affected, wherefore we will bind the part
that is above the black, and cut that away that is under the band, and will
foresee that the ends of the band hang in the lower end of the stitching of
Abdomen, whereby we may easily take them forth when as they are thrown from
the wound coming to suppuration.

The fifth Chapter.
AND hitherto it is abundauntlie spoken of the other parts of the body, now
therefore there remains to speak of the bones, when as to these also, that
disease of which we entreat, does happen, which we call solution of unity
or continuitie, and when as this disease falls to this part, it has a proper
name given to it, in Greek Catagma, very usual to them that can speak
Greek, for Apagma is the proper name used of Physicians, being out of use to
the common people, they use thus to name it, when as the end of the bone in the
part, where it is to be joined with another that is broken, but of the
fractures themselves, what part so ever of the broken been, are utterly
separated, they say in Greek that they are named Caulethon, and it is evident
that such division is overthwart, and another division made more by the length,
in which the parts of the affected bone be not altogether separated asunder,
but are cloven right forth, which kind they accustomablie do call Schiducedon.
There want not some of the later physicians, which so ambitiouslie interpret
by proper names all the differences of fractures, that they call some
Raphanidon, that is made to the figure of a Raddish, not being satisfied with
this talk, to say that the bone is diversely fractured, but Hyppocrates was
not of this mind, but as near as he could, using the most accustomed names,
refusing not to interpreate by Oration, not only these differences of
Fractures, but also those which happen in the bones of the head, which if I
had done also in every affect, I should have made this Treatise short.

Now for that he has showed the way of many, which must be considered, but
have not begun or defined, what is perticularlie to be done, it is necessary
that we tarry in the^ no longer than is meet, but repeat briefly those
which he has set forth perfectly. And we will also add demonstration to
those, which he has smallie defended by reason, and we will define certain
things which are left undefined, and place them in order which want order, and
last of all, we will give light to these things which are obscure. But if I
shall in every one add his words, our book shall be as long as a large
Commentary.

And peradventure some here will condemn our Prolixitie, when as they shall
complain thereof without cause: In the third and seventh Book, in these it
was necessary to add many places out of Hyppocrates book De vulneribus,
whereby I might show other Physicians what it is to write by a certain method,
the curation of ulcers and wounds: but his doctrine set out in his book of
Fractures, who is so dull that will not receive it all as clear and most
profitable, but if any man does say that he does a little marvel thereat.
To this manner of saying may most aptly be repeated, Hos vnum atque alterum,
permit to be sure.

Therefore it seems good time now, to show the true method of curing a
Fracture, with the nature of the things prescribed, taking our beginning from
hence, because there is solution of Continuitie of the parts of the broken
bone, their unition is at the fore first scope, whereto he must bend him that
will cure them: but if this seem impossible to be done, because of the
dryness of the affected parts, there remains another scope: that is, that
they may be adglutinated by the help of another thing, which thing is a
certain humor, coming betwixt the ends of the broken bones, as it were a
Glewe, and to joins them fast together, which if that be found not to be
done, thou may call the affect incurable: and that such an hard bone as is
in young men, striplings, and men, and much more in old persons, cannot grow
together, I think it evident to all men, for truly that bone only will be
united, which is very soft, such are the bones in Infants, but some does
greatly hope, that the parts of a broken bone separated, may again be
adglutinated and knit by some other substance or glue coming betwixt.

It is showed that every part of the body does attract to himself his own
and like nourishment, which if it be true, then surely the convenient
nourishment of the bones is groser and more earthly than any other
nourishment in the whole creature: so that it is not repugnant to reason,
neither a thing impossible, that of this same proper Element, which abounds
and grows in the edges of the Fracture, may by his coming betwixt the bones
close them together, for to Use shows, and Experience consents to that hope
which reason does give: therefore it is hence forth to be considered by what
means this thing that grows in ye fractures, how much, and what manner a one,
may comfort. For it is evident that we require not what manner a one, but such
one as observes in both, a mediocritie: wherefore, this simentrie, both in
quality and quantity, being found out. Furthermore it is requisite to seek
out by reason, whether we may attain to them both or not: but the time when
this shall be done, is no less necessary to be sought out, whether presently as
the fracture is made, shall we make unition, as in wounds, or that this be not
a time convenient, but a more apter must be found, suerely, thou being
instructed, by the nature of the thing, may find out this as well as all
other. Therefore what is the nature of the thing? Forsooth the broken bone
comprehended under some of the rehearsed differences of fractures: go to now,
let us see whether any thing may be taken of every difference which serves to
the curation, beginning with that fracture which is made overthwart, named
Cauledon, the parts of the broken bone, do here so lie, one besides another,
that they lay not directly even, wherefore it is manifest, that first they be
brought directly even, to that end they may the better grow together, then to
do some of the things that follow: truly that shall follow if one using the
example of the whole part, does draw the bones that are a sunder, to the
contrary part, of which is taken most sure indication, of the transposition of
them. For truly, it may happen that the tra^sposition of ye member shall be
made forward, backward into this and ye part. For it is meet, that whatsoever
are backward, be brought forward, and yet nevertheless, the other part of the
broken bone, is to be moderately thrust to the contrary: Contrariwise, that
which is forward, is to be deduced backward, and the other part by little and
little, to be brought forward.

In like sort the consideration of those which are wressed to the right side,
is if they be brought to the left side, and again those which are in the left
side, if they be changed to ye right side, always drawing the other part,
moderatly to the contrary: but there is no small danger, least in bringing the
parts, by contrary motion, same of the shiuers, which stick out, be broken,
neither are both the ends even as those which are sawed asunder, and if they
be broken, the ends of the broken bone, cannot exactly be joined, and that for
two causes, for if the pieces fall betwixt the two parts, they let the parts to
touch, which are formed right, or if any fragment falls outwardly, neither so
shall there be perfect conjunction of the bones, which thou have framed in such
wise, as they shall be like their first union, for that only happens when the
shiuers of the bones, be put again in their own places. And if they being
broken do perish, there must of force be a void space, betwixt ye bones
united together, in which Sanies being collected, and in space putrefying, does
corrupt also the whole member. And for these causes, the bones which are a
sunder, ought to be drawn right out, and this cannot well be done, except
first they be stretched backward, the Greeks call it Antithasis, therefore it
behooves to make this Antithasis, of bones, either with thy hands, if the
member be little, or with bands put about the member, or else with such
instruments, as Hippocrates, has taught, and when as they have enough drawn
back, and that they be out of doubt, least they in bringing together should
touch them selves, then put them right and losen the bands, and let the
muscles of the parts to be in one, and in the mean while help thou with thy
hands, and if any thing does leap up, amend and form it, and next this,
whereto thou must bend, is that the member does remain unmoved, least any of
the parts which thou have placed, be moved, for so of force they must again
separate.

And if thou commit it to the patient, that he look to the quiet rest of the
member, peradventure waking, he will regard it. But sleeping truly he will move
it, but that the bones formed may keep their situation, not only the man
sleping, but sitting and rising: when the bed is made, it behooves to bind the
fracture, with a safe Ligature, which may exactly keep the parts of the broken
bone together.

But for that loose ligature suffers the bones to move, that which is too
straight by compressing, does bring dolor, let us give diligent heed, that
eschuing both discommodities, we may inioye both commodities, which we shall
do, if we eschew extremity, so that we shall not make the ligature so
straight that it compresseth, neither yet so easy that it be loose, and if
every member were of equal thickness, then the broadest roller were most
commodious, because it should embrace all the broken bone of every part
equally and continentlie. But seeing it is not so, although to the breast thou
use a most broad roller, thou can not so do in the joints and neck, but
in such, a narrow roller is better, for that it will not wrinkle, and that it
touches the skin of the whole member, about which it is put, but if it
holds the Fracture with a few fouldes, it is not without danger.

Therefore how much surenesse wants through the narrowness, so much must be
added by often rolling about, and by deducing it toward the sound parts, but
seeing all rollings which do constipate and coarct the flesh without dolor,
has that property to press the humors out of the parts where they are
first put on, and does put and fix them in those in which they end, I think
it reasonable to begin the ligature upon the fracture it self, and so to
proceed unto the rest of the member, for he that does otherwise, puts the
blood to the affected part, but if he begin upon the hurt part, and ends
in that which is whole, such ligature shall not only be void of hurt in
these, which we have said, but be also profitable, for that it suffers no
inflammation to arise about the Fracture, of which principally regard must be
had, and it is to be feared least great inflammations follow, both of the
stretching into the contrary part, which we use in forming rightly the
member, and also that the causes which make the Fracture, do first hurt the
flesh, inuesting the bones by constipation and contusion, neither marvel I if
some such thing, like an inflammation happens to the portion of the bones,
when as such as are not rightly cured, are manifestly seen to be more moist
than nature requires, where we see a wound with a broken bone, neither
comes Caries of the bone, in Greek named Sphacelus, any other way, which
is corruption of the whole substance of the bone. Therefore thou shall not be
negligent, but expel thou all the superfluous moisture from the parts which
are about the fracture. Therefore thou may begin upon the affected part, and
bring the roller about twice or thrice, and proceed then toward that which is
sound, for verily he that thus does roll, shall defend the flux of blood to
come from the whole parts, to those which are affected, and does also put out
from hence that which is here already collected. Seein then that there are
two parts, which may both receive any thing of the affected part, and also
send unto it. Forsooth they which lie upon it are most ready unto both, as
well for the multitude, as also greatness. But the extreme parts for the
contrary cause, can receive or send but little, neither can minister much,
either to the affected parts, either receive of them again.

Wherefore when as Hyppocrates made the first two ligatures, with the first he
did not expel that was in the affected part, to those that are above, and also
does expel that which flows from them with the roller. For with the first
rollings about, which he does make upon the fracture, and by deducing it to the
lower part, he thrust some mattier thither, and lets that none shall flow
from thence.

The rest of all the inuoluings, with which he will have the roller to go from
the lower parts upward, that they may in the same place with the first, both
repel to the higher parts, and also preserve flux from these, wherefore the
two first rollers do defend and strengthen the Fracture, neither suffer they
inflammation to arise. Notwithstanding these alone are not sufficient to both
these uses, so that Hippocrates did devise for their defense a remedy, that
splents be applied with the last rollers, which might also strengthen these:
and he commands to use some one medicine, which is against inflammation,
least there should follow inflammation, such a medicine is Ceratune humidum.

Therefore all these are invented (as we have said) by reason, and also the
figure of reposition, and this also has a two fold indication, the first
depends of the common knowledge only, the other which is taken of the
natural constitution of ye members to be cured: the first indicatio^ shows
that such figure is to be chiefly chosen, which is most free from dolor and
grief, so that there follow no inflammation to the part, and that the patient
be best able to remain longest in this without moving. The second indication
which is taken of nature, wills that the arteries, veins, nerves and
muscles, be most rightly placed. And these indications do agree. For the
rightest figure of every part, is free from dolor, and that which of the rest
is most free from dolor, is most natural to the part, for to the arm, the
figure which is cornerwise in Greek Eggonios, for the leg that which is
somewhat less stretched out. Furthermore, not only the natural habit is
profitable to every member, not only in avoiding of dolor, but also the
custom seems much to profit: and this is the way of finding out the figure,
in which the member is to be kept, which also differs not in seeking out the
figure, used in extending the parts a sunder, called in Greek Diatasis, and
also when the parts of the broken bone, are brought into their natural place:
for it is convenient that both thou do extend the member in the most right
form, and that which is furdest from dolor, and also that thou formest it into
his natural habit, and much more that thou roll it in the same figure, and
also placing it to rest: for the moving thereof does not only provoke dolor,
but also does wrest the bones by moving the member being in one figure, and to
change it to another, for except I have forgotten those precepts which we have
written in our books Da musculorum motibus, it is necessary, that whereas the
figure is altered, there some of the muscles to be strained, and to be made
round as they were contracted, and other to be lose and relaxed.

Therefore of force where they are extended, there they are compressed of the
roller, and by the compression, do suffer pain and dolor. And where there is
no extention, there the ligature is lose and slack, and so the fracture
wants his stay: and for because of all these, we must study that we do
both extend, and form the member, and also roll and repose the member to rest
under one, and the self same figure, and there is no precept left unset out,
which belongs to the first work in Fractures.

Thou shall (as Hippocrates commands) lose the roller the third day, least
there should arise dolor and itching in the member, unaccustomed to be so
covered, and also that the perspiration of that which is now fixed in the
member be not let, by whose occasion there does not only fall thereto, an
unhappy itch, but also the skin to be vlcerate and coroded, with the
sharpness of Sanies: wherefore we must pour in so much of temperate water, as
shall be sufficient to take away this Sanies. And if thou will again do as it
is aforesaid, thou ought to do it the vii. day.

All things now are apparent, so that nothing hinders, being free from
inflammation, and somewhat gentler, than for natural constitution. Then it
shall be lawful to apply splents, and roll it more wider asu^der, for it was not
without danger, to use splents before the inflammation was past.

But now when as it is ceased, and that need is to strengthen the fracture,
surely you shall use the^ with much commodity. And you may also let the
rollers remain longer time, the parts having no need to expel Sanies:
Furthermore Callus in Greek or Poron, shall so luckely follow when it behooves
to the generation of it, (as it is before declared) some of the proper
norishment of the bone to be gathered together and grow. Therefore this is now
to be consumed away from the lips of the fracture, or else to be euapored, for
else truly it shall make solution of continuitie, neither shall thou let it
slip, so long time, that thou know not how the fracture goes forward: for
we have often seen, that when the bones were vehemently dried, Callus hardly
did grow.

Wherefore it is meet to pour upon these a little warm water, the third or
fourth day, leaving when as the flesh rises in a red tumor, and we must
leave herein, before it begins to assuage. Contrariwise, when as we will
digest any thing, we shall not leave of, before all the tumor be vanished which
sprung of the perfusion: and whereas the abundant moisture is, and let that
Callus does not better grow, there we shall go about with convenient ligature
to exicate, as is before said, and with perfusion of water, which must be
altogether little, or much: for it shall be but little, when it cease, and
before any thing flows to it: and the humors which be about, be digested, and
does dissolve those which are deep fixed. For it is expedient so to lose and
dissolve these, which are to be expelled by rolling: for a great deal of water
does more digest than attract.

Surely it is evident, that in that ligature which does expel, the ends of ye
rolls are less to be coarcted, but whereas we must nourish, there the ends
must be straiter, and the other inuoluings more lose.

Now seeing we have found out not only what time we must help the generation
of Callus, but also by what manner, now there rests, to set out the universal
order of diet. For in the beginning, they ought to use most thin diet, as we
will prove when we take in hand the proper curation of inflammations.
Furthermore, we will declare that sometime it shall be expedient to let blood,
and also to purge, but what time Callus is engendered, the body is to be
nourished with good iuyse, which may much nourish, of which there accustometh
to follow, not only good iuise, but that which is also tough, of which
principally Callus is made: for seeing that it cannot grow of a serous and thin
moisture, and that it can spedely grow, of that which is gross and brickle, and
void of fatness, but yet in time waxes dry, it is made friable, and apt to
break.

The bigness of Callus, shall be such, as it were a safe band to the bones, and
yet not compresse the muscles, for that Callus which is to little, is not
sufficient for the bones, and that which is to great, brings dolor to the
muscles: so that diligent head must be had to increase it, if it grows to
little, and to let it if that it does increse to much. And thou shall do these
both by the quantity of the perfusion, and also quality and quantity of
meats, and also the faculties of medicines, which are to it outwardly applied,
but we have before spoken of perfusion and order of diet of medicines, and such
as have an emplastike substance, and do moderately heat, they do both bring
forth Callus, and also increases them. But such medicines as have a digestive
faculty, do deminish those Callus which are now great, but if thou studiest
that neither Callus shall be increased, or deminished, but art content to let it
grow further, use thou some of those medicines, which are applied to green
wounds, which because they do moderately dry, they cause Callus moderately to
coagulate and grow: and this is sufficient touching overthwart fractures.

Now of those that are in length, the cure is in all points as the other, but
yet the ligature must be straiter made in the fractured place, and that which
is a sunder, must be inwardly thrust to those which are diuersely fractured,
and chiefly with a wound, as it does commonly happen to these. Hippocrates,
wills that splents bowed like a saw, and dipped in read and auster wine,
chiefly in summer be put about it. For if any does use either Oil, or Serot,
they do putrify, because the affect being goeater than the rest, do more
dry than they require to be dried. And let all the medicines as he commands
be drying, but yet considering the mean of excication, he wills such
medicines to be of the kind of Enema. But if any shall at the beginning use an
Enemon medicine, let it be such a one as is apt to be poured in, and all other
things are to be done after his precepte, not only in these rehearsed, but
also if the bare bone requires to be cut with a saw, or that thou shall take
away some fragment, or that it behooves to minister to nature expelling it,
what so ever Hippocrates, doubted of those instruments which the legs are to
be laid in, called Solenas, whether they are to be used or not, all men do
know that I judge the reasons laudable, and Glosconum, which is invented of the
later Physicians, we do account it as worthy of praise as any other, and do
use it, when, in the time of engendering flesh. Yet it seems yt Hyppocrates
knew not that, although otherwise he was not negligent in excogitating
instruments which should be profitable, but the instruments in which the legs
are placed, was rightly devised of them, that by one axiltree which was placed
in the end of the instrument at the lower part, caused by a double extension,
a contrary endeavor to the whole member, and the one of the^ which extends
the member right out, is called in Greek Eutigporos, the other which extends
it first upward and afterward backward, is called Translatiue, in Greek
Metaleptice, both are done by bands or cords, and that band is most aptest to
this use that has two ends, for this being put about the member, the arms
being put about the axiltree of it, makes the first extension, called
Eutigporos, and when as the band is put about the parts of ye broken member, it
makes the translatiue extension, called Metaleptice, the arms of him being
moved first upward, and after backward, for these are also to be put about the
axiltree. Furthermore the arms with the bands being put about, and as it were
bowed, the extention which is made from the higher parts to the lower, ought to
be done by the pulley or vice, which are placed in the sides of Glottocomon,
thou may call this instrument Solena, with his adiection, Solena Machanicum,
or Glottocomon Mechanicum, but we shall more largely speak of instruments,
when we set out ye cure of luxations, where also we will no less speak of ye
variety of ligatures which are to be put about. Now seeing I have made mention
of Solena Mechanicu^, which does much profit the leg, but when it is reposed
and otherwise put, or when as the patient changes his bed or goes to the
stool, it shall be good, because nothing shall want to ye Treatise hereof, to
commend much Glottocomon, of which they make ye one side, and also the table in
which they place the foot, to be moveable, for that it may serve to the
bigness of every member. And this shall be sufficient to understand of the
other fractures, with these which Hyppocrates has commanded.

The sixth Chapter.
HIppocrates truly has written a whole book of those wounds which happen in
the head, in which he has set out all things which herein are to be done,
and we having finished this work, will go about to explicate his works at
this present. Truly for that in these Commentaries we have added more than ye
he has spoken, and defined that he left undefined. It behooves that we speak
first of the hollow cutting instruments, called Gneliscus, next of Phacotus,
after of ye narow cutting knives, and last that we entreat of the use of
medicines, therefore there are some fractures of Cranium, which comes to the
second table called Diploen, some to the inward part of the bones, some are
simple fractures, some are contusions, and some the marks of those wherewith the
stripe was made, remain the simple fractures, which come to the second table,
those need the narow knives before spoken of. It is requisite both to have
many of them, and also differing in bigness, least ye should want which is
most apt for the purpose, and the bone affected being made bare, as the manner
is, you shall first use the broadest knife, next another which is narower, and
so the rest orderly, until you come to the narowest, and this is to be used
in the second tables. Afterward both these, and so to the end it must be cured
with drying medicines, which for that cause are called Cephalica, and those are
made of Iris illiriaca, and meal of Eruum, and Manna, and Aristolochia, and
the rind of the root of Panax, and to conclude, all such medicines as
mundifie without corrosion, for the generation of flesh is ye work of nature
it self, and there the patient in that behalf has no need of the art of
medicine, and that the flesh which does engender may close, and cleue about to
every part of the bone, ye shall chiefly follow, if there be no filthiness
upon it, neither yet any oil or fatness, therefore this one thing which the
Physicians help to the production of flesh in the hurt patients, ye all the
place be dry, and every part of the affected bone pure, and all these are
common of all fractures, when as the flesh begins to grow of the fractures
which come to the coats of the brain, if it be only a simple fracture, the
narow knives before remembered must be used, but if the fracture be with
contusion, ye which is contused must be cut out, first pearcing it through with
Teribles or Trappons, and after with knives, or at the beginning with
Cylciscos, as need does require. But ye which is done with Teribles, is
dangerous, because while they more boldly use it, they do often hurt Dura
matter, which is the next bone. Also that which is done by Cicliscos is not
without fault, when that it does immoderatlie shake that which requires rest.
Therefore it likes me best, if the fractures be great, and the bones fractured
vehemently, to use Cicliscos, for with small incision thou may make space
with lenticuler Exciscories, and if the bones be sure and firm, they must be
pierced through with a Terible. And certain because they should not err, have
devised such Teribles as cannot sink down, and for that cause are named
Abaptista, there goes round about a circle, a little standing out somewhat
above the sharp end of the Terible. Truly it is convenient to have many such
Teribles serving to the thickness of every Cranium, for to a thicker Cranium
a longer Terible is convenient, I do call it so, whose space from the point of
the Terible, and the circle extant compassing it, is longer, and to a thinner
Cranium, a shorter Terible: and this also is that which has a less space
betwixt the point and the ring ye goes out. And truly whether I shall call
these more dangerous or surer than the other, but they use those that are
called Choenicidas, but use thou with good success Cicliscos, if thou be not
skillful of those things which may deceive thee, neither yet more fearful
than needs, first those that are broader, then those which are narrower,
until thou come to Dura matter. But that bone which must be cut out, is not to
be made bare round about with the Ciclisce, but on that part chiefly where
the fracture is most grievous, for besides other, the pannicle it self does
most speedily separate from the bones that are vehemently affected, so that
there is no fear of touching yt which is already separated, for if thou have
once made one part bare, and set thy knife, which has in the end a blunt
and light form of a lentle, which is like a pease, and the edge erected in
length, when as you have set the broad part of the lentle upon the pannicle,
strike it with a mallet, and so then thou shall divide Cranium, for doing thus,
all things come to pass as we would have the^, for one cannot wound the
pannicle, yea, though he did it slipping, touching it only with the broad
part of the lentle, which if it does any where cleave to Cranium, the
roundnesse of the lentle does without danger take that away, for the
instrument it self called Lentle, cutting Cranium follows at his back, it
going before, so that thou shall not find out another way of pearcing, which
shall be less danger, or yet more speedy. For thou will chiefly praise
this in most vehement Fractures, which many of the later Physicians do call
Eupei somata, and Camaroseis Eupei somata are, when in the midst they
endeavor, or to take a piece of the bone forth, the coat or Membrana
remaining bare, Camaromata which have the same part exalted, wherewith he did
take away the fractured bones from the part affected, are such as most
speedily cut an hole out, when as the end of the Instrument called Lentle
does easily enter in, and those which are far gone from the natural
habit, we shall prepare with an Instrument called Ostagran. Some of the bones
which are vehemently crushed, being lifted up and turned to that part
chiefelie, that we may put in the instrument called lentle, which done, all
things after that needs, follow with security and speediness, that thou
may almost rehearse that famous saying, in which all things are well,
Dimidium facti, qui been caepit habet: that is, he which has begun a thing
well, has half brought it to pass, for here thou have not the half of the
whole, but rather the whole, or else but little less, when as thou have put in
the Instrument called a Lentle. And this is the best manual tractation of
fractures in Cranio, called Chirurgia.

Now I will hereafter show how much of that is to be cut away that is
affected, that which is vehemently fractured, is to be all taken away, and if
certain fragments come out further from it, as sometime it is seen to happen,
it is not expedient to follow these to the end, being assured that hurt or
damage shall follow to them that have it, if all other things be rightly
done, we doing so not once or twice, but often have had our desire. And the
Indication of doing things, is here also taken of the nature of the affected
parts, for the ligature which in other fractures reason has found out, to
keep back inflammations, thou can not use to the head. Therefore thou can
not stay that which flows, neither expulse out of the affected parts that
is in them contained, without which remedies, none of the other bones can be
conserved sound. For imagine that in the arm, the bone is broken unto the
marowe, and that none afterward do vind it as it becomes a Fracture, it must
follow necessarily, that not only the matter which is gathered outwardly
under the skin and muscles, but also which is in the marow, does both first
and principally corrupt the marrowes it self, and also with it the whole
bone. Seeing yt when all things are rightly done, this does sometime chance.
How then may not such things happen to the head, seeing that it cannot have the
ligature which is due to Fractures, and also the matter sinketh down in such
sort, as all lies upon the coat or pannicle in other Fractures, when it is
well rolled, it is so far, that it suffers no superfluous moisture to be
gathered in the affected bone, that it makes the member leaner than for his
natural constitution. The way that is excogitated by ligature, cannot both so
exact the fractured bone and the parts about it, yt they shall neither be
inflamed, or yield any mattier, neither is there any medicine, which in other
parts can without ligature, as we have said, keep the fractured bone dry,
and free from superfluities. Wherefore we had need first to make bare some
part of the Fracture, whereby we may mundifie and wipe away the Sanies from the
coat, and when the time of inflammation is past, and all is exactlie dry,
then to incarnate and ciccatrize the place. Our talk is not here naked and
void of matter, as the Sophists which knows not the works of the art, do
demand why the fractures of the head has no Callus, they have (O good sirs) a
Callus, and you be so mad that you do assign causes of that, which are not as
though they were: we in times past did see the bone of the fore part of the
head broken, which next follows, this is called Os temporis, in which it
happens that the commissares are joined as it were like scales, in it there
was most long and manifest Fractures, which I nothing touching, but cutting out
the bone of the fore part of the head did cure the man, that he now has lived
many years, but if I had in like sort let alone the bone of the fore part of
the head, the coat under it would sure have putrified, then the fracture to
have engendered Callus, for if no Sanies should flow inwardly from the
affected parts, it should have been needless to have cut out the bone,
therefore they (as their manner is) do trifle, for I truly in another having
the like fracture, did think to let the higher bone alone, and to take out
that which was in the sides, whereby the Sanies might flow out. But when I did
mark both the thickness and the hardness of the bone, I did judge it better
to take out the bone, than for regard of the flux to finite vehemently the
brain, and I also thought yt it might happen, that if there were a great hole
in the side, that the brain might perchance come to this part. Further, there,
and that not in one place is in the sides a springing of nerves, and that of no
small quantity, when as in the high bones of the head there never springs
the least nerve of all, and I being by these things warned, did abstain from
taking out the bone that was in the side of the head, and it ever had Callus,
and if it were rightly cured, and now truly there rests, that we seek out
what is our principal scope of all, both medicines, and eke of all our
diligence, when as the bone is perforated, whether that which is most delicate,
and answerable to the pleasure of the Patient, which now the most part use, or
else that which is heereto repugnant, that is, that which is done by most
vehement exiccatiue medicines, which Meges Sidonius does praise, and a certain
Citizen of ours does always use, insomuch that he forthwith applied to the
bare coat or pannicle an emplaister called Isen, and upon this outwardly
Oximell, truly this old man was sufficiently exercised in this part of the
art, but I did never see any other use them, neither yet durst I do so.
Notwithstanding I can thus much witness with Eudemus, for that was the old man's
name, they rather escaped which were of him cured, than of those who used
delicate medicines, and I had also gone about to try the like way of curing,
if I had continually remained in Asia, but seeing I have bid at Rome, I do
follow the manner of the City, committing the greatest part of such works to
those whom they call Chirurgions. But judging the nature of the things it
self, I conceive that such certain determination to be confirmed by our
experience. The auditorie cunduit which stretches not only unto Dura matter,
but also touches the nerve which goes from it to the brain, this although it
be so near, does abide, as it is said, most vehement medicines. Therefore it
is no marvel, if after the perforation of Cranium, Dura matter, before it is
much molested with inflammation, does desire most strong medicines, having
naturally as it were a dry substance.

FINIS.
Thomas Gale unto the friendly Reader.
IT is requisite that every one that uses this art of Medicine, in the
curation of diseases or sicknesses, not only to know the divisions and
natures of the same, but also to know the names, by meanas whereof, every one
of the same may be known from another, and chiefly in this part, for the
better understanding of Tumors against nature, wherein Galen has taken great
pains, not only in their true divisions, but also gathering together their
most apt and ancient names, given unto them by the old writers. And if any
names did lack for such sicknesses, as reigned in his days, he did devise
most apt and convenient names for the same. Aristotle says, whosoever is
ignorant in the terms of his art, that he is ignorant in the whole art.
Therefore it is necessary for those that profess so noble an art as
Chirurgerie is, not only to know the names of sicknesses and diseases, but
the name of every particular medicament, as well simple as compound. And also
to know all other strange terms appertaining to this art. Wherefore Galen in
this book of Tumors against Nature, has taken great pains, not only in
setting forth of their names, but of their true divisions, natures, and
dispositions, with their figures, forms, and humors, by which they do grow
and are maintained, without which knowledge no Surgeon can either rightly
cure, either else understand the nature of those things which he does take in
hand.

Therefore I have thought it good to set before your eyes this most worthy
book, which Galen has written, of tumors against nature, wherein he has most
excellently set forth not only the most apt names, but also the humors, that
the same tumors do spring of. For like as he has declared, in his method of
curing, the diversity of wounds and ulcers, with their natures, forms, and
properties, and also with their accedents, symptomata, and causes. Yea, I say,
not only with these, but also with the knowledge of the temperaments, natures,
and qualities of every medicament, proper for their remedies, with their true
deuisions and names, to that end, that every one of them, may be exactly and
perfectly known from other. And for the better understanding hereof, I have
added in the end of this book, of Tumors against nature, an other book of
Galen, of the names of medicines, which be proper for diseases, which I have
thought very meet and convenient, for you to understand, to that end, that
you may be accounted men of knowledge in your art, not only to be accounted
so, but to be so in deed. Thus taking my leave of you, I desire you most
heartily, to be studious herein, and so being, you shall encourage me, further
to proceed, in other things of this art, which may be much for your profit.
And thus I commit you to the almighty Lord, who illuminate you with knowledge,
of this most worthy Art.

Your loving brother to the uttermost of my power, Thomas Gale, master in
Chirurgerie.

Claudus Galeni de Tumoribus preter naturam.
OF those things which chances to man's body, one thing is that which the
Greeks do call Oncos, which we name a tumor or swelling, for so do they
term that thing which is a swelling or a distention, in length, breadth, and
deepnesse. Also sometime that bigness which is above natures constitution,
they do call Oncos. These do not only chance unto them that be sick, but to
those that be whole also. For corpulent persons, and women with child, are
more bigger in breadth and thickness than according to nature, and yet they
are not affected against Nature, as we have said in other places. The other
tumor is that which is according to natures constitution, (or as we may term
it, a natural tumor in the braunes of our arms, and caufe of our leg)
which is in a mean betwixt those that be according to nature, and those
against nature. For corpulent bodies and also lean bodies, are not against
nature, but the one is above natures constitution, and the other under, and so
both these dispositions are called not natural. But that tumor which comes
of the dropsy, and leanes in a consumption, both these are against nature. But
now in this present book we do purpose to entreat of those Tumors which be
against nature, which does not only occupy the whole body, but also may
chance to any part thereof, so that it be always determined, that the
agreuation of this unnatural constitution be against nature, and the end of
the same to be the hurt of the natural action. But we need not to speak much
of these Tumors, for that they be commonly known unto all men, not only to
the Physicians, but to all other persons.

The other tumors which grows of immeasurable fatness, and flesh, and also
women being with child, do make those which are above natures constitution.
And we considering all other Tumors, which are according to nature, and
necessary for the making of our body, (as in the braunes of the arms, and
cause of the legs, etc.) All other tumors which does exceed that, which is
above nature, and those which be natural, we account against nature. And
taking our beginning at the first of them, called an inflammation or Phlegmon.

Of Phlegmon or Inflammation. Chap. 2.
THe Grecians use to call that an inflmmation, which comes with great tumor
or swelling in the fleshie part, strained and stretched forth, resisting with
pulsation and dolor, hot and red. The cause of these accidents, is not only
unknown to ye multitude of the common sort, but also unto many Physicians,
(or as we term them, those that uses the art of Medicine) for diverse of
them, not seeking out diligently, do simply pronounce that which seems
good unto themselves, mistaking the thing. But consideration must be had
herein, if you will proceed in this mattier. Therefore there is never any
great tumor that chances in any part of the body against nature, except
the same part be affected with one of these two things: For either it is made
flowing, increased, and stretched forth through over much hotnesse, either else
it takes some new substance outwardly. And when this flux does happen, and
is stretched out with swelling, it is turned into spirits, and being
refrigerated, it does easily turn again into his accustomed swelling.

But we see no spirits in the inflamed part, neither yet the part inflamed
being refrigerated, do not always come again into their former constitution.
And it is manifest by incision also, that there is no spirits therein
contained, for if the inflamed part be cut, much blood will run out, and
all the place seems evidently full of blood, like unto a wet Sponge: But yet
you shall see no spirits come forth, either presently or yet long after, and
the color of blood is altogether inseparable. There is no part of the body
that is red, but blood and flesh, neither is the multitude of flesh the affect
of inflammation, for although the multitude of flesh be in the body without
multitude of blood, yet the tumor truly shall be bigger than natural, and the
color shall be healthful, and not swerve from his accustomed nature: for in
any thing which naturally increases, the color is not augmented, for then
should Snow be made more white, Pitch more black, and Gold more yeolowe. And
the increasing of substance differs manifestly from alteration, for things
increase according to their quantity, and alters according to their
qualities, but color shows the quality of ye substance, and not the
quantity: Therefore the multitude of flesh differs from an inflammation, and
for that cause, the bodies which abound with blood, be most troubled with
inflammations. Now, seeing that sometime in wounds there be great
inflammations, and yet there flows forth thin and watrie humors, the place
it self round about it appearing red, it is therefore herein, that the
thickness of the flesh or member wherein the wound is, to be of a mediocritie,
and not unnaturally swelled, that it may suffer the mattier more easily to
come forth, and that it may the more easily contain the blood, which is
necessary for the nourishment hereof: But you shall understand, that mattier
or Sanies, how much it is more thin than blood, so much it is groser than
spirits. Wherefore if the wounded flesh does permit mattier to flow out, it
must of necessite suffer spirits to pass forth also. And so these spirits
being euacuated, the tumor and inflammation should cease, for truly it so
happens often times, in those parts, whereas spirits are aggreuated, the
part once cut, all the tumor vanishes.

The generation also of inflammations in wounds, is a witness thereof, for in
the beginning, when wounds are new, there flows multitude of blood, which
being stopped with things refrigeratiue, or else the member it self being
refrigerated, it is stayed. It is also stayed by compression with our hands, or
with ligatures, the blood being coniealed in the edge of the cut part, and so
retained, does wax thick as it were a clod, or as we may term it, a
coniealed thing, for they only differ in this, that the clod or coniealed
blood should be a sensible concressio^ of blood, gathered together in the wounds
stayed in the small passages of the cut parts, making the blood gross. And
when the blood is gross, and the sides of the cut part more straight, the blood
is retained, and the sanies put forth. All these be the greatest conjectures,
that the inflamed part abound with blood, and that the heat should be more
than natural, but yet not so hot, that with heat only without flowing and
stretching, it should make such a tumor, for hereof are many considerations
to be had, for then in burning Agues, how much the heat were more vehement,
so much the greater should the tumor be in the inflamed part. The second
conjecture is taken of the substance of the blood, for it is not coniealed of
cold, as Pitch, Rosen, and Wax is, but is always by nature more hot. For
those when as they are made hot, they turn to the contrary, and become thin,
but blood by nature being hot, the tumor may well be somewhat greater, but yet
not so much, by the reason of only heat, to raise up any great quantity in
the inflamed part, but Pitch, Rosen, and Wax, coming to so much extremity of
heat as does the inflamed parts, they are made some thing bigger, and these
things being considered, beside that which we have spoken, is no small
conjecture, that the tumor of the inflamed part, comes not only of flux,
for there is no small alteration in the heat of the blood, which causes the
tumor to be bigger. And let that which appears to be, to the an apt
conjecture.

For in blond there is not as in pitch, rosin, and war, being vehemently made
hot great confusion, but it keeps, being boiled on the fire, his accustomed
tumor, or is very little increased. And I have declared above, that
inflammations, being refrigerated, the tumor did not always sease, for a
vehement and great inflammation, in which there is a flux impacted, although
you do vehemently refrigerate it, yet you do not seade the tumor, but make
the part of a leadie color, and turns the affect into Scirrhus, by the
reason of the cold medicine. And some inflammation as we have said before
which has a flux joined with it, may easily be cured, with things which do
refrigerate, and be astringent, and chiefly, when it is little. But the flux,
being firmly rooted, (or as we may term it confirmed) then neither
astringent, nor cold things helps, for it does require the^ euacuation.
Therefore, the ancient Physicians, invented medicines, not only to discus,
dissolve, and drive away with their hotnesse, but also did invent to scarifie
the skin, and so to euacuate the blood sensibly.

All these are great tokens, that the inflamed parts, are full of blood, and
yet this inflammation, is not presently at the beginning, but by proses of
time, the powers being stopped, and perspiration lasted, this is brought to
pass.

Therefore of necessity, the blood so remaining, it does putrify, for all
things hot and moist, gethered in hot and moist places, does redely putrify,
if they be not spedely, euacuated, either else refrigerated. Wherefore, if the
heat, which comes of putrefaction, surmounteth that which it had before,
that is easily known, by the inflammation of the part, and the blood gathered
unto the tumor. Notwithstanding, although the veins, which for their
littleness, did not appear at the beginning: yet then they will appear.
These comes not only of inflammation, but also because they are filled with
blood.

Therefore they come to that bigness, that they may be most manifestly
perceued, and that chiefly in the eyes, privy members, and women's breasts, and
that the flesh, who being inflamed, seems to abound with blood, both the
color, and the tumor does declare the same. Wherefore all the flesh is
compared like unto woolle, or a wet sponge, which you may more perfectly
understand, when the mattier comes forth, for then the inflamatio^ having
passage, the truth is perceued.

And I truly suppose, the skin to be distended, and lifted up, with those
humors that are gathered to gether in the tumor, and in time, the tunicles and
vessels, which be underneath, takes some part of the flux, like as the upper
skin does, which covers the inflamed part. Yea, also the nerves, and
tendons, by profes of time are inflamed, and some time the disease comes of
these, as they chance to be wounded. But yet universally, there is nothing
according to nature, in the inflamed part, when as it has long remained so,
for the flesh, with all the rest, is infected with the flux, in so much, as
some times it comes to the bones. And some time, ye same affect it self
springs of the bone, but the matter being avoided, the skin is made looser,
when that which was between, is run forth, as we have said in the
administration of the Anathomie, and chiefly, where we have made divisions, or
declaration of the arteries. But where there be inflammations, all these parts
are filled with blood, flowing out of the vessels, which are dispersed into
every part of the flesh, as it were a dew.

Of Apostumes which comes to suppuration. Cap. 3.
WHen as through proses of time, nature gets the victory, then is all the
flux concocted and turned into mattier, and so put forth of the fleshie part,
by the expulsive virtue, which does cast forth hurtful things. Therefore,
where as there is any manifest hole, as it were a conduct, prepared for the
excrementes to be purged, this place being open, part runs out, by pus or
matter, and part does breath out sensibly. But where the skin which covers
the apostume, is gross and hard, such is the skin in the utter parts of ye
body, there the matter is still retained, and does divide the upper flesh from
that which is under it, and so in process of time, by his acramonie and
sharpness, it corrodeth through and runs forth, if that by scarification it
be not prevented. But oftentimes it comes to pass, nature being ouercommed
of the flux, that the blood is not turned into mattier, but into some other
certain mutation; sometime into one, and sometime into another.

The ancient Physicians do commonly call all these by the names of
Apostumes, and principally these which be in the profound and deep parts.
But many would not have all these which turn into good mattier be called by
the name of Apostumes, but only those which turns into corruption, like as
they call all these which come to suppuration in the lungs, by the name of
Impiema, and other some Diapiema, and also like as Impiestem, and Diapestem,
and many would not have them so called. But when there is any such thing
amongst the little pannicles, that they call Impyerna, and him that is so
grieved Impius. But some other Physicians would have those called Impius, in
whom there is mattier gathered between the breast and the lungs. Wherefore I
have said, we must so far forth regard the names, as the thing signified may be
made more evident. For we must labor that ye thing it self of which we do
speak, may be made so manifest, that no part thereof be left unknown, for all
these are preparatiues to the method of curing, by which method we do cure
the dispositions themselves, and not their names. Therefore you bearing these
things in remembrance, we will proceed unto those which remains, and are
necessary to be spoken of.

Of Sinus or hollow Ulcers, and the cure, when it is difficill and hard. Chap.
4.
WHen as putrefactio^ does separate one part of ye body from another, or
separateth those things yt be contained to their subjects from the same: this
mattier being euacuated or let forth, so that the parts separated cannot take
their accustomed constitution and unition, this affect is called Sinus. And if
this be not speedily cured, there does grow a certain hardness by length of
time, which is named Callus, neither can it be adglutinated to the part
subject, but by convenient diet, and medicamentes which be exiccatiue, for
other ways the part shall seem to inioye perfect health when it is not so.
For if any man uses a right diet, and has his body free from superfluous
humors, Sinus is removed and chances not. But if the body do abound with
superfluous humors, the same may resort again to the grieved part, and cause
the same Apostume which was before, which might have been easily euacuated.
Then you must cure the same as you did before, with abstersive and scarifying
things, and medicaments that may keep back humors. But this Apostume shall
not be so grievous, by a great deal, as the first was, for so much as the
parts which were divided, are not joined together again, and that the humor
does quickly and speedily fill the same, insomuch, that Sinus (as we may
term it) does easily receive the flux again, and as it does quickly
receive it, so does it speedily euacuate ye same, having an apt way for the
flux to avoid at. But if the parts were adglutinated and joined together,
then the Apostume would be grievous before it were broken. The generation of an
Apostume comes not only of an inflammation called Absessus, but sometime also
it comes by the means of other humors, which by process of time corrupts
and separateth the parts yt were joined together, from their subject parts.
Wherefore it comes to pass, when these Apostumes be cut, that there does not
only appear in them all kind of humors, but also sound bodies, and
strange things, for there are sometimes found in these Apostumes, things, like
unto mier or dirte, to urine, to conieled things, called Grumos, juice of
Honey, slime, bones, stones, nails, and hair, and some time like living
things, all which, does spring of putrefaction, as it may easily be perceived.

Of Fistula, Atheroma, Steatoma, and Meleseridis. Cap. 5.
THere is also a narrow, and a long Sinus, which is called Fistula, and is
cured like as the other Sinus is, and comes again to apostumation, through
the superfluous flux of humors, even as we have said in the other. Atheromata,
Steatomata, and Melesirides, are of some men, accounted among Apostumes, and
some suppose, them to be of an other kind, but the natures of them, are
manifest by their names.

For in Atheromata, is things found like unto potage, or like to a pultes. In
Meleserides, like unto Honey. And in Steatoma, like unto fat or suet, and all
these for the most part, are contained within a Membranus filme or skin, and
are called tumors against nature. Besides these, there are other, as
Carbunculus, Gangrena, Herpis, Erisipelas, Scirrhus, Oedema, Cancers, and
inflammations, all which the Physician that does intend to cure them, must not
be ignorant of, but he must be diligent in considering their differences, as
well as of their generation and substance.

Of Gangrena and Carbunculus. Cap. 6.
WHen the blood of Gangrena and Carbunculus, does wax so vehement hot, that
with inflammation, it burns the skin, then they come with crustes, and
blisters, and goes before the ulcer, like as it were brent with fire, and they
bring with them, most sharp fevers, and peril of death. These ulcers in a
Carbuncle, do always appear black, or else in color like ashes, but not
as an inflammation, for the color of an inflammation is red, and these decline
somewhat more to blackness, then those do which be of blood, or those which
be refrigerated with cold. For those tumors are more swart, but these are
glistering like unto bitumen, or pitch, in so much, as they come of black
cholar, for the malignitie that is in Carbunculus, springs thereof.
Therefore, it must needs follow, that from the beginning, either else in the
vehement boiling, the blood be presently turned into melancholic humor, by the
reason of vehement adustion.

Of Cancers. Cap. 7.
OF black cholor, without boiling, (that is to say, mela^cholie) comes
Cancers, and if the humor be sharp, it makes vlceration, and for this cause,
these tumors are more blacker in color, then those that comes of
inflammation, and these be not hot, but the veins in these, are both more
fuller, and more distended forth, then those which be inflammations. For less
matter goes out of the veins, into the fleshie parts, which compasses the^
about, through the grosenesse of the humor, which breeds the Cancers, neither
yet are the veins so red, as they be in inflamatio^s, but shows them selves
according to the humor, that they be filled with.

Of Gangrena, which comes after great inflammations. Cap. 8.
THere follows after great inflammations, that which is called Gangrena, and
this disease is a mortification of the affected part, and if it have not spedie
remedy, the grieved part does utterly perish, and some time it takes hold of
the other parts which be joined to it, and kills the man.

For the mouths of the veins, and all the powers of the skin, are
obstructed and stopped, through a most vehement inflammation, and the natural
perspiration, being deprived, the affected parts are easily brought to
Gangrena, and mortificatio^. And first of all the flourishing color of these
parts, which are infected with inflamatio^s, are extinguished, then the dolor
and pulce does cease, not for that, the evil disposition is aswaged, but
because ye sense it self is mortified. In great inflammations, the pulse, and
sense, is not separated, for the ancient writers do say, that there is a
sensible motion of the artery, in the inflamed part, whether it be with
pain, or without. Therefore in accidents of inflamatio^s, some suppose, that
it must be without pain. But this controversy is about the name, which is no
great matter, for it is better for us to know the generation thereof, not
regarding the name: For in bodies according to nature, the motion of the
artery, is sensible to us without pain, but in inflammations, it is sensible
with dolor and pain. For the artery when it is delated, smites the body,
which is next about it, and with the beating thereof, we feel pain, by reason
of the inflammation: And when the filme, or pannicle that covers the artery
is inflamed both the artery which beats, and also that which is smitten,
does double the pain, and thus of these, we have spoken sufficiently.

Of Erisipelas, Herpis, Oedema, and Syrrhus. Cap. 9.
NOw we intend to speak of choloricke fluxes, and it has grown now of
custom amongst the Physicians, I know not by what means, that whether we name
choler simply, or choleric humors, we understand it to be yelow, pale, and
bitter choler, and not sharp, and black cholor, for they name that with an
addition, joining the color of the humor with the name.

Therefore, when any cholerike flux, which we do name exact choler, chances
to rest in any place, it does vlcerate the skin, but when it is mixed with
watery humors and bloody, it is of less sharpness, and causes the part
grieved, rather to turn into a tumor, then into an ulcer, and this tumor is
called Erisipelas, and that which is vlcerated, is called Herpis, these are
known, both by their color, and by their heat, which shows the humor
that they are engendered of. Again, according to the sharpness of the humor,
they do differ, for that which comes of the sharper humor, is called Herpes
Estiominon, for so does Hippocrates name it. But of the other which is less
sharp comes Herpes milaris, which many have called so after Hippocrates,
because it makes risings in the skin like unto the seeds of Milium. It
seems unto me that this flux has some fleame mixed with it, and that the
other to come only of exact choler, and therefore it comes with erosion, the
affect apprehending still the skin, whereof it takes name. And where blood and
choler is equally mixed together, the form and nature of it is in a mean
betwixt Erisipelas and inflammation. But if either humor exceed in
quantitite, the disease takes his name of that which does abound, as they call
that where choler does surmount blood, Erisipelas inflamatorie, and where
blood surmounteth, they call it Inflamatio Erisipelatas. The like
interpretation is also used in the mixing together of other humors, as
Inflamatio Sirroidis, and Sirrhus inflamatori, and Oedema inflamatori, and
Inflamatio Oedematosa. These four are they which oftentimes are made affects,
and chances through the flux of humors, I do mean Phlegmon, Erisipelas,
Oedema, and Sirrhus. Erisipelas is a cholerike flux, and comes of cholerike
humors. Phlegmon, (or as we term it,) an inflammation, comes of blood.
Oedema comes of thin and watrie fleme. And of gross and glutinous fleame
springs one kind of Sirrhus, and the other kind of Sirrhus comes of the
dregs of blood.

There be also two kinds of these, after Hippocrates, and both they come of
black choler, which we call melancholy. Of the one springs Cancer, and of
the other comes a kind of Sirrhus, but it differs in color from that
Sirrhus which comes of fleame, and both these are named Tumors against
nature, they are hard and without pain, and the generation of them both,
sometime from the beginning, does come of the ill curing of inflammations, as
well in Phlegmon, as in Erisipelas and Oedema, when as they are too much
refrigerated.

Of Ecchymosis and blackness which comes after brusings. Chap. 10.
THose which are called Ecchymosis or blackness, be very near in kind unto
Sirrhus, and it happens chiefly unto old men, when as their veins are
bruised. For of a light occasion this comes unto aged men, as I have said
before, and some of these colors are in a mean betwixt black and read, and
are called swart. All these come of blood shed out of the veins, sometime when
the filme or pannicle is bruised, and sometime when the end of the veins are
opened.

Of Aneurisma and Spaselus. Chap. 11.
When there is an orifice made in the artery, that affect is called
Aneurisma, and it chances when the artery being wounded, the skin which is
above comes to a ciccatrise, but the separation which is in the artery
remains, being neither conglutinated, nor brought to a ciccatrise, neither
yet stopped with flesh. These affects are chiefelie known by the pulse and
beating, which the arteries do make. And also all the tumor vanishes away
when the artery is pressed down, the substance which made the tumor, runs
back again into the artery, when it is so compressed down, which substance
of blood we have showed more at large in another place, to be nothing else but
thin yeolow blood, mingled with subtle spirits.

And truly the blood which is in them, is more hotter than that which is in
the veins. And Aneurisma coming by reason of a wound, casts forth blood in
such a sort, as may hardly be stayed. But in Oedema the mattier is not so,
for if we press the affected part with our finger, it gives place, and there
remains a hollownesse, neither is there any pulse felt in this affect, and
Oedema is more broader a great deal than Aneurisma, except some coniealed
blood ingendered of Aneurisma, which makes Spacelus, for so do I name all
corruptions of the sound parts, so that it is not only in the flesh, but
also it corrupts the bones themselves.

Gangrena is also a mortification of the sound bodies, but it is not so of the
bones, and it follows after great inflammations, and is one kind of Spaselu^
or Syderatio, and has a proper and peculiar name beside the general. Now that
we have sufficiently defined these, it is time that we speak of melancholy
fluxes or tumors.

Of the settling of Melancholy. Chap. 12.
WHen as black cholar lies in the fleshie parts, being very sharp, it
eats through the skin, and makes an ulcer, but when it is not so sharp,
it makes a Cancer without vlceration. And we have declared before, how that
the veins swell more in this tumor than with an inflammation, and what manner
of color it makes. There are not only Cancers engendered of this tumor,
but many other tumors consist of the same humor. All these bodies which are
vexed with these affectes, are nourished with the evil iuyte, either of
cholerik or melancholik things, either else of some virulent and naughty
humors coming of great putrefaction or corruption.

Of Phagedena, Scabie, and Lepra. Chap. 13.
THose ulcers which cateth and deuoureth the found parts about them, are
called Phagedena, for they name Phagedena, compound of two things, that is to
say, of the ulcer it self, and of the tumor joined with it. For Herpis also
eats that which is about it, but it is only an vlceration of the skin,
and Phagedena does not only eat the skin, but the flesh also which is
joined to it. Now to name other Ulcers, as Telephia and Chironia, etc. it were
superfluous, for it is sufficient for us to call all Ulcers commonly
Cacoethae, that is to say, malignant.

Also Scabies and Leprosse be melancholy affectes of the skin, even like as
the same humor makes a Cancer when it is in the veins and fleshie parts.

Of Elephas, named Elephantiasis. Chap. 14.
ALso Elephas is a melancholic affect, and has his generation of melancholy
blood, and in time the blood is made more black, and many of these are full
of ulcers, which are of evil smell and grievous to behold, and when this
affect springs first, it is named Satyriasmon, because they are like Satyrs
in countenance. And we do call them so, when there appears risings of the
bones, in the temples and other parts of the body. Also there are such bone
risings, which are named Exostosis, like as the natural distentio^ of the yard
not ceasing, some name it Satyriasmus, and other some call it Priapismus.

Of Achoris, Myrmecia, Acrocordon, Psydrax, Epynectes, Furunculus, Bubo,
Struma, and Hernia. Chap. 15.
THere is also a little ulcer in the head, which you must conjecture to grow of
salt and nitrous fleame, and out of it flows mattier, not very watery,
neither yet so thick as honey, or as it does in those which are called Faui,
for those are with a certain tumor, and full of holes, and as it were with an
humor flowing like unto Honey, and these Tumors are very little, and not
like unto the other. And there are lesser Tumors against nature than these,
which also happens unto the skin. Myrmetia, and Acrocordon, Psydrax, and
Epinictes, be affectes to all men known, and so is Furunculus most manifest,
and it is gentle, being only in the skin, but if it be deep in the
fleshie parts, it is malignant, like unto Phyma, and Furunculus differs from
Phyma only in hardness, both these affectes are inflamed, beside the third
which is called Bubo, the fourth, which is named of many men Phigethlon, does
differ from Phyma, both in heat, and quickness of generation.

There be some also which chau^ceth only in the flanks, and arm pits, which
some suppose to be Phygethlon, because it comes with an inflammation, in those
glandulus parts, these affectes, when as they are made hard, are called
Choeras, that is to say, Struma, like as the hardness of the testicles, are
named Sarcocele, and like as the watery humor, gathered in the pursse of the
testicles, is called Hidrosile. In like manner, when Epeplon, which we call
Surbus, falls out, the disease is named Epiplosile, and when both these, that
is to say the intestines, and Surbus falls down to gether, it is named
Enteroepiplosilen, the later Physicians call all tumors of the testicles, by
the name of Cele, that is to say, harnia, or ramix. And like as all that is now
spoken, shows the sickness of those parts which we have spoken of, so
Cirsocile, being a newer name, shows the affect of which it was now derived.

Of Varicis, Rupturies, Inperitoneum, and Hidropsie. Cap. 16.
VAricis, the ancient writers, name all veins which are delated and swelled,
and not as the Athenians suppose, that Varicis, should be only in the legs,
by the reason of their weakness, and chiefly when the body abou^deth with
gross blood, which may fall unto them.

Also the inward rimme of the belly, called Peritonium, either being wounded,
or ruptured, and not joined together again, causes a soft tumor in that
place, which if it chance in the flancke, it is named Bubonosile, but if it
happens in the navel, many Physicians call these Exomphalos, and there is no
such disease of Peritonium, but of necessity, the Naruus apendix of the
muscle, must suffer.

What this apendix is, I have showed in the administracion of the Anathomie.
Therefore these affects are of the overthwart muscles, and that Harnia, which
is in the fla^ckes, is of the oblike muscles, the filme or apendix of those
which are in that parts, being either broken or dilated with peritonium. There
are also other tumors, which belongs to this place, that comes by the hurt
of the intrailes, the affectes which inge^dreth these tumors, are spoken of
amongst inflamacions, and other Sirrhus tumors, with other like, as those that
have dropsies, where there is gathered a multitude of water, as in that which
is called Ascitis, and of wind, which is named Timpanitis, and that which
comes of phlegm, which is called Anasarca, or Leucophlegma. etc.

Of Epulides, Parulides, Thimus vua, Tonsilla, Parysthmia, Polipus, Vnguis, and
Stapheloma. Cap. 17.
THere are also, other tumors, which have proper names, as Epulides, Parulides,
Thymus, and such like, which are fleshie branches, or buddes, growing forth,
like unto a grain. Vua Paristhmia, and Tonsilla, are nothing else, but
inflamacio^s. Vua, is an inflamacion of Gurgulia, which we call the vuila.
Tonsilla, of those kirnells, which be opposite (we name them the Amigdalines)
Paristhmia, is in ye parts of the jaws, or nigh unto ye throat. It seems,
that of these parts Hippocrates did not understand all these inflamacions of
Gurgulia, to be Vua, but one only kind, in which, the end of Gurgulia is
like unto the seed of a Grape. Also Polipus comes when as either
inflamacion, or Phyma, or any branch thereof, call it what it please you, for
this affect, is always in the nosethrilles, and they are inflamed, chiefly
because of the place. Encanthis, is also a tumor against nature, and breed in
ye corners of the eyes, but yet in all his kind, he is not against nature.
Vnguis, is also a branch, growing outward in the eyes, to the tunicle or
membrana: which is dilated of Sircumossale, and comes to corona. Those yt are
called Staphiloma, some only by position, some by disposition, be against
nature. We have in an other place, spoken of all such affects, as are in ye
eyes, and therefore now it is time, to finish this book, seeing there is no
other kind of tumors against nature, which we have not spoken of.

FINIS.
AN EPITOME Upon Galens three books of natural Faculties, very necessary
for the Students both of Philosophy and Physic: set forth by Master James
Siluius, Physician.
FAcultas is a certain cause Effectrix, place^ in the temperature of a part,
in the beginning of simples.

The faculties governing our body, in the which our life consists, are in
number three, Natural, Vital, and Animal.

In time Nature use 1. Natural, is in the liver dispearsed by the veins into
the whole body, being the third and lowest. 2. Vital, is in the heart,
distributed by the arteries into the whole body, being the second and mean.
3. Animal, is in the brain, and carried by the nerves into all parts, endued
with the fence of feeling and voluntary moving, being first and chiefest.
Indignity, place and fortitude.
We must first entreat of the natural, as the nourisher or pillar of the
rest, as we proved in the order of reading or teaching Galens books.

The natural faculties which be first and principal, are Generatrix,
Engenderer Auctrix Increaser Nutrix Nourisher.
which are called powers Vegitable. Arist de animal. lib. 2 cap. 4.
The first two falties. 1. Actio. 1. The very motion active is a substantial
form in Materia, or production to substance, or proceeding to form. And that
is either of all or of part, as generation of humors in a living creature, of
blood through moderate heat: of both kinds of choler by immoderate heat, of
fleame and melancholic humors, by a slow heat, and that comes of some
meat more, of some less, in all temperatures. And these humors are either
natural or unnatural. 2. Opus. 1. A thing made and finished by action, as all
parts the body fashioned in the womb, and by generation complete, unto the
which perfection of parts, the seed being rightly once conceived Generatrix,
is the chief and principal worker.
Two other faculties. 1. Alteratrix. The which generally be hot, cold, moist,
and dry, in their first and element all faculties, and does change the seed
blood, and menstruall substance into a man, in which is the qualities of
feeling, tasting, smelling and seeing: for it is necessary yt out of
Alteratrix, bones, veins, nerves, and all other parts be made, but
perticularlie she does work upon that substance, by faculty, making bones,
nerves, veins, etc. For of the four elements mingled, does grow the
particular faculties alteratrix, whereof is made the substance of every similer
part: and so many faculties of alteration, there. be in living creatures or of
planets, as there are found similer parts in them. 2. Formatrix. This faculty
very artificially and with great cunning, and for some cause, does fashion
the matter which is changed, so that it may have an apt figure, for placing,
composition, hollownesse, wholenesse, soundness. Apophyses, Epiphyses, and
other things necessary, pertaining to the constitution of the bones, natures,
veins, arteries. etc. The which constitution is meet, for the action and use
of the part, that after shall be created, that nothing be lacking, nothing
superfluous, which otherwise might be in better sort.
Auxiliares, or helping facultiez as they were hande-maide^s. Nutrix.
Nourisher. Austrix. Increaser.
This do not only serve for the increase of the young, being once engendered,
but also from ye time, that the seed is conceived, for it is meet that the
seed be augmented by nutrition, that it may suffice to constitute, so many
and such parts as be necessary. The male seed is first nourished with the
female, and afterward with a small and halituouse portion, of the blood of
menstruum. Facul. auctrices nourishers. 1. Actio. Is an increasing, that is to
say, an ampliation of the found parts (which were engendered) of a living
creature, in length, breadth, and deepnesse, keeping the proper form and first
continuitie, as it is said in the 1. li. cap. 5. De generatione. This is the
work of nature only, when as these things which are extended to us, or
pulled from us, or are amplified in one measure only, or not in all together,
then this faculty bears rule from the birth, unto the flourishing age, and
as I said, helps the faculty Generatrix in the womb, and is only in a
living body. 2. Opus. The small parts of a living creature borne into the
world, which are brought into a reasonable bigness, and the body being little
made great.
Auxiliares or helping faculties. Alteratrix. Chaunger. Coctrix. Digester.
Nutrix. Nourisher.
Of ye which we will entreat hereafter more at large. Facul. nutrices. 1.
Actio. That is nutrition or the perfect assimulation of nourishment, with the
thing nourished, that is, when that thing which flows, as the form of
nourishment is put unto, fastened, and made like unto all the sound parts of the
nourished body, without any ampliatio^, for the juice or humor when it
falls a Vasis, even as certain dew, so is it dispersed through all the part
which ought to be nourished, and by and by it is put or joined unto it, and
after having gotten sufficient dryness and clammie humor through natural
heat, it is glued and fastened, it increases, cleaves together, and is united
in one. The which comes not so to pass in Anasarca Hidrope, when as the
nutriment being more watrie, and not so clammie, by reason of the abundance of
thin and watrie humors, falls from the sound parts of the living creature,
and at the last it is made like unto the part which should be nourished, when
it is nutriment in deed (other are nutriments in power more proper, and
remove.) The which is not in Leuce. 1. Vitiligo. 2. Opus. All the parts
enduring with nourishment so long as is possible. Attractrix, which draws
unto the part convenient quality and juice. This faculty, like as the rest,
being found in some instrument, as in the stomach, reins, womb, milt,
bladder, purging medicines, and Alexiteries, is easily transposed into the
other parts.
Auxili. facult. helping facul. 3. Retentrix. The reteiner of the same until
digestion be done. Coctrix. Digester in altering, and that makes it like.
Expultrix. Expeller of that which molesteth the part, in quantity, quality,
or both.

But we will entreat of these four faculties as most principal hereafter
more at large.

1. Attractrix. The drawer of convenient quality and juice into every part
to nourish the same (the which is common unto all parts that draw unto them
such nutriment as is most proper for them, sometime thorough straight pores, as
in the stomach, and sometime only by the temperature of the part, as almost
in all the other parts, or else to the voluptuous delectation of the part,
whereby the mouth of the matrixe does draw the seed of man to the very end,
and whereby the gall does separate and draw yeolow choler from the liver, but
in the Gall, yeolow choler is not ingendered, as Asclapiades says, like as
neither, he affirms melancholik humor in the spleen, but of him it is drawn
from the liver to nourish it self. The reins do divide and only draw the
urine out of a hollow vein from the blood, and it is not carried of his own
accord into the reins, as though that were the best.

Neither do the hollow veins draw together and wind about, thrust forth the
urine into the oblique reins, nor into these, which lie right underneath in
the sides, to be strained out with all the blood, and because it is thinner
than blood, to be transmitted: even as all the Wine runs into the vessel of
the Wine press, and as the coniealed milk is strained, the Whey alone
runs, and not the cheese: in like manner the reins do expel the urine
into the bladder, through Vreteras, which are growing on ye sides of the
bladder, and the humor which is received, Asclapiades says, is resolved into
vapors into the bladder, and into the body, having as it were two tunicles in
it, the vapors are let pass by ways, uncertain, dark, straight, and such as
can by no sense be perceived. And they being once again grown together, do
receive their first form, and so out of vapors, humors are engendered, for
so he has deprived the reins and Vreteras of their function. Neither do the
part of blood receive pure blood above the reins, but those things which are
beneath, do receive the blood from the reins, (unto whom they bring fastened,
through pressing will as Serum be carried) being purged and distilled, as
certain of the scollers of Erasistratus say: for if Serum were heavy,
neither should it be carried of the stomach into the liver, to be distributed,
neither into the reins by Caua, neither does a watrie humor run into the
reins, and a sanguine humor by Caua backward, like unto oil and water
mingled, which when they are poured on the ground, each run contrary way, as
other Erasistratians affirm. Nor yet as Licius says, the urine is the
nourishment of the reins. Therefore the reins do draw the urine, for that
it is familiar and pleasant unto them, and not by following that which is made
empty. For so when no more urine did abound, then was it made empty by
Ischuria, that is to say, through suppression of the urine in the reins,
bladder, or other passage belonging unto urine, as we have said before more
largely. In the Tractice of the stomach and the throat, by their straight
passages, there is no Deglutitio by contraction, as Erasistratus says. In the
Tractrice of the liver, there is a distribution of Chylum, out of the stomach
and entrails, into the liver, by the veins Meseraica. In the Tratrice of all
the parts, there is distrubution of blood out of the liver and Caua, into all
parts by the branches of the vein. And not as Erasistratus affirms, by the
expression of the stomach (for this although it were, so yet by reason of the
length of time, it should have small power, for the distribution of blood
through the veins) not by the veins contraict about the blood, which they
contain, not with that succession unto that part of our substance which is
made vacant, and dispearsed from our heat, the which thing those that recover
from sickness do declare, who if they have not more nourishment flowing and
abounding in them, then there is place vacant, they shall never recover their
accustomed health, and moreover, the abundance of blood in the body, could
never be gathered together upon the liver. In the tracture of purging medicines
it may appear, they draw proper qualities, or certain humors, familiar unto
them, out of our bodies, as Scamonium draws yeolowe choler out of one that
has the Ianders, Elleborus niger draws black choler ex Melancolico, Cnicus,
Coccum, and Gnidium, draws fleame ex Leucophlegmatico: flos aeris, Squamma
aeris, aes Vstum, Chamedris, Chamelion, draws a thin and watrie excrement ex
Ascitico, and these tumors are not engendered in us of the medicines
themselves, making our bodies supple, as Asclepiades does falselie surmise,
denying the faculty attractiue unto every convenient quality, whereby Magnes
draws iron, Succinum a little moate, and corn the water laid underneath it
in earthen vessels, and certain medicines do pull out splints and arrowe
heads fastened very deep in the flesh, and also poison of Serpents, which was
put in the same.

Likewise certain medicines draw the poison of Vipers, some the poison of
Pastinaca marina, and other of others, insomuch that the poison drawn out,
has been found lying upon the medicine. By the which similitude, the same
substance may draw things, other medicines draw not by hook and crook
Attomos, joining together, as they met one another with Epicurus, the which
he and Asclepiades did appoint to be the first elements of all things.

Retentrix. The reteiner of proper qualities drawn unto every part, until
digestion be perfect, when there is nourishment, but if there be excrements
which do trouble the part wherein it lies, as in the entrails, the bladders,
etc. swelling with quantity, or sharp and biting quality, or in both
together. The child is retained in the womb, until that through greatness,
weight, biting, or that the infant be avoid with sweat, or urine, the
Membranae being broken, or through some other urgent cause, it is constrained
to be delivered. This faculty like as the rest, is in all parts which are to
be nourished, but it appears most plainly in those parts which are greatly
hollow, as in the stomach, womb, bladder, and is most delighted in these
oblique passages, but in other parts it is more obscure, it is also placed in
the temperature of those parts, even as all the rest are.

Coctrix. The digester of the substance retained in the part, the which
substance is so much the rather made like unto the part by alteration, as it
is more nearer, and of greater similitude, to the same in qualities, as of
blood, flesh is soon made, but that substance which has less similitude with
the part, it is necessary that it be changed flower, and first by all the
mean qualities, as of blood, hot, moist, and red, there cannot at the first
dash be made a bone, cold, hard, and white: but there must needs be many
alterations and chaunges, in the middle. And for that cause there are two
kinds of instruments pertaining to nutrition. The one is that which draws,
carries, contains, and digesteth the nourishment, and as it were a strange
burden, expels, and bears it, such are first, Cocturae, Os, Gula,
Ventriculus, Intestina, second, Mesaraice, Venae, Hepar, Caua vena, thirdly,
all the parts Similares, and of these, Organice, and Vene capillares, the which
as the chiefest prepare by alteration the nourishment meet for every part.
The other is, that which by drawing the excrement of nourishment, does divide,
carry, retain, and purge it, as are Lien, Rene, Ambae Vesicae, with the
passages of ye stomach, chiefly by Crassa intestina, Spincteres ambo, Musculi
octo epigastrij. And those muscles which do make the restraint of the breath,
and also those which is very profitable and necessary for the siege, and
urine, and unto the bearing of a child. Thorough this nourishing alteration,
when as the parts are made, that which remains is like unto them, and
therefore it is called Assimulatio, but through the ingendering alteration,
those parts which before were not, are afterward created.

Expultrix, the expeller of those things which could not be overcome,
digested, or perfectly altered, and that could not be made like unto that
which ought to be nourished, when they are grieved, as it were with a strange
burden, the part which demanded them, either by concoction or attraction, and
when they stretching out in quantity, or troubling with sharp quality, or
both, do greatly hurt it. This faculty, is excedingly delited with crooked
ways, which are these parts, the stomach, entrails, womb, both the
bladders, veins, and arteries. Expulsion, which is contrary unto attraction,
is often times through one passage, as vomit and swallowing down through the
throat: the seed and the increase, through the neck of the privy parts. The
distribution of nutriment, and the attraction of purging medicines, and
voluntary expultion of the juice, abounding in us, through Mesaraicas venas.
These nourishing faculties, are understood by the name of natural things,
for that from the conception of the seed, even unto death, they are in a
living creature, and also in a plant, for they help generation, and action, and
one likewise furthereth an other, that by nutrition, there may be a certain
particular generation and corruption, wherefore these three books entreat
almost only of these faculties, unto whom, corruption, diminutio, and
atrophia, are contrary. These faculties with certain instruments, which have
action, common unto all the body, are of two sorts, that is, general, and
particular. The general are either all present, as in the stomach and liver,
or else three of them only, as in the two bladders, for one of them digest, or
two of them alone, as in the reins, for neither they digest, nor retain, or
at the least very little, by reason that they want great capacity, or else the
faculty expultrix, as the entrails, which have for that cause only crooked
passages in their tunikes. And forasmuch as these ought to be nourished, as well
as ye other similer parts. They have four particular faculties, nourishers of
them, placed in the temperature of their substance.

Hitherto we have declared, which are the natural actions, how they be made,
and of what parts.
