A proper dyaloge / between a Gentillman and a husbandma^ / each complaining
to other their miserable calamite / through the ambicion of the clergy.
An A. B. C. to the spiritualte.
Awake ye gostely persons / awake / awake
Both priest / pope / bisshoppe and Cardinal.
Considre wisely / what ways that ye take
Daungerously beyngelyke to have a fall.
Every where / the mischefe of you all.
Far and nere / breaks out very fast
Godde will needs be revenged at the last.
How long have ye the world captyued
In sore bondage / of men's tradiciones?
Kings and Emperoures / ye have depryned
Lewedly usurping / their chief possessiones.
Much misery ye make / in all regiones.
Now your frauds / almost at the latter cast
Of godde sore to be revenged at the last.
Poor people to oppress / ye have no shame
Qwakynge for fear / of your donbble tyranny.
Rightful justice ye have put out of frame
Seeking the lust of your godde / the b^y.
Therefore I dare you boldly certifye.
Very little though ye be thereof a gast
Yet god will be revenged ^r the last.
O Christen reder / from rashness refrain^
Of hastye judgment / and light sentence.
though su^ recke^ it frowardnes of bra^
Thus to detecte ye clergyes inco^uenie^ce. (ne
Unto christ's words give / thou aduertence
Which says nothing to be done so secretly
But it shall'be known manifestly.
Where as men discern no grefe of darcknes
F^ll little is desired the confortable light
The day is restrained to sheme his clerenes
Till the clouds be expelled of the night
As long as we perceive not wrong from righ^
Nether holiness from false hypocrisye
The truth can not be known manifestly.
Cursed they are / as Esaye does express
Which presume the evil for good to comme^de
Saying that sweet is sour / and light darcknes
As now in the clergy / we may perpende.
Whose disguysed madness in the later end
As saint Paul to Timothe did prophesye
Shall be known to all men manifestly.
Example of twain he doth^ th^e recyte
Whose names were called I^nes and Iambres
Which by enchauntme^t / through deuels might
Strongely resisted the prophet Moses.
Doing like merueyles and wonderfulnes
So that none could the very troth espy
Till their Iugglynge was known manifestly
Christ / likewise / with his predicacion
The phariseyes showing outward holiness
Was a counted of sma^ reputacion
Vice cloked under shine of vertuousnes.
Until at the last their furiousnes
Accusyng the woman taken in aduo^ery
They saw their fautes detecte manifestly.
Their vices opened / they could not abide
Shame drevynge them to confusyon
Which before season through pope holy pride
They bolstred out under abusyon
It is the practyse of their collusyon.
Zele of righteousness to feign outwardly
Till their fautes be detecte manifestly /
Which in our clergy is evidently seen
Feigned godlynes falsely pretendynge
Whereby most part of people do wene
That they seek gods honor in all things
How be it / men should se that their seeking
Is to confound christ's gospel utterly
Were their fautes (...) manifestly.
What greater despyte can they ymagine /
Against god his hye honor to deface
Than to usurp on them his power divine
Abhominably sittinge in holy place*
Which has continued long time and space
And shall with outrageous blasphe^
Till their fautes be (...) manifestly.
Scripture unto them was first proferyd
Mekely without any prouocacion.
Which to receyne when it was offeryd
They refused with indignacion.
Wherefore touching their reformacion.
Little trust is to be had certainly
Ty^ their fautes be detecte manifestly.
Thus to conclude / (...) christen reder
Unto patience / I the exhort.
Aduertesynge / how and in what manner
Christ rebuked this pharisaycall sort.
Whom as Matthew in the. xxiij. does report.
With fearful sentence he cursed ernestly
Their wicked fautes detectynge manifestly.
Nihil est opertum q^ no^ reueletur. Mtah. x.
Here follows the Dialoge / the Gen tillma^ beginige first his co^playnte.
Gentillman. WIth soronfull heart / may I compain
Co^cerninge the chance / of my misery
Although paraue^ture it is but vain
Truth oporessyd / with open tyranny.
My enheritaunce and patrimony.
Against right / from me they keep away.
Which say / for my friends souls they pray.
Mine aunceteres of worthy progeny
With rentes and lyuelood largely endued
Mayntayned their estates honorably
Aydynge the poor / indigence to exclude.
Till at the last / the clergy to them sued.
Pretendinge godlynes / under a falls way
Saying they would for their souls pray.
Stoutely they alleged before their sight
How after this life is a purgatory.
Wherein their souls both day and night
Should be tormented with out memory
Except of their substance transitory.
Unto their seactes / they would some what pay
Saying that they would for their souls pray.
They bare them in hand that they had might
Sinners to bind and loose at their own pleasure
Taking upon them to lead thyem a right
Unto joy / that ever should endure.
Of popes pardones they boosted the treasure.
Chalengynge of heuene and hell the faye
Saying / that they would for their souls pray.
To trust wife or childern / they did dissuade
Either any friends or persons temporal.
Affermynge / that our love should a way vade
Without any memory of them at all
Only to hope in their seactes spiritual.
They entyced / with persuasiones gaye
Saying that they would for their souls pray.
Thus with wylines and arguments vain
Mine aunceters brought in to perplexite
Partly thorough fear of eternal pain
And partly for desire of felicite.
They consented making no difficulte
To grant their requests without delay
Saying that they would for their souls pray
Their chief lordshippes and lands principal
With co^modytes of their possessyon
Unto the clergy they gave forth with all
D^sheretinge their right succession.
Which to receive without excepcion
The covetous clergy made no denay
Saying that they would for their souls pray
By the means whereof / I and such other
Suffrynge the extremyte of indigence
Are occasioned to theft or mourder
Falling in to much inconvenience.
Because the clergy against conscience
Deuoureth our possessiones night and day
Saying y^ for our friends souls they pray.
I have wife and childern upon my hand
Wantinge substance / their life's to sustain
Wherefore to the clergy that have my land
Sometime I come and pituously complain
Whose statelines / to help me having disdain
With our any comfort to me they say
That for my friends souls they daily pray.
Should I and my household for houngre dy^
They would not an half penny with us part
So that they live in welthe abundantly
Full little they regard our woofull smerte.
To waste our goods they nothing aduert^
In vicious lusts and pompous array
Saying yt for our friends souls they pray.
They take upon them apostles auctorite
But they follow nothing their profession
Often times they preach of christ's pouerte
How be it toward it they have no affeccion.
If so be they pleate ones in possession
Hard it is to get ought fro them away
Saying / that for our fre^des souls they pray.
Thus must we bear their oppression
Whiles to complain there is no remedy
The world they have brought in subjection
Under their ambicious tyranny.
No respect they have to the mysery
Of us poor gentillmen that be lay
Saying that for our fre^des souls they pray.
Alas / is it not a miserable case?
To se idle persons void of py^
Occupyenge the lands before our face
Which should pertayne unto us of ducte.
They have richesse / and we calamyte
Their honor encreaced / ours must de^
Saying that for our fre^des souls they pray^

The husbandman. Sir / god give you good morrow
I perceive the cause of your sorrow
And most lamentable calamyte.
Is for the oppression intolerable
Of these monstres so uncharitable
Whom men cast the spiritualte.
Truth it is / ye poor gentillmen are
By their craftynes made nedy and bare
Your lands with holdinge by violence
How be it we husbandmen every where
Are now in worsse condition far
As it may be marked by experience.

Gentillman. In worse caas? nay / that can not be so
For look over the hoole world to and fro
Namely here in our own region.
And thou shall find that in their hands
Remains the chief lordeshippes and lands
Of poor gentillmens possession.
They have our aunceters lyuelood and rentes
Their principal fearmes and tencamentes
With temporal fredomes and libertees.
They have gotten unto their kingdoms
Many noble baronries and ^rldemes
With esquyres lands and knights fees.

Husbondeman. Notwithstanding yet they say prceysely
That your Auncerers gave to them freely
Soche worldly dominion and lyulood.

Gentillman. Freely quod a^nay / that is but feigned
For they ware certeynly thereto constreyned
By their covetous disceite and falshod

Husbondman. How did they your annceteres compel:

Gentillman. Mary in threatnynge the pains of hell
And sharp punishment of purgatory.
Where to brenne / they made them believe
Except they would unto them give
Part of their substance and patrimony.

Husbondeman. But how would they deliver them frothence:

Gentillman. As they said by their prayers assistence
Which with boostynge words they did allow

Husbondman. Prayer? god give her a shameful represe
For it is the mdost briberynge these.
That ever was / I make god a vow.
For by her the clergy without dowte
Robs the hole country round about
Both comones and estates none except.
I wot they have prayed so long allredy
That they have brought the land to begg^
And all th^nes clean away (...) epte.
What soever we get with sweat and (...).
That prolle they away with their prayour
Saying they pray for our souls (...)
But is their prayer nor (...) avaylynge
To the dead souls / than to the lynynge
So is it not worth a ro^en aye.

Gentillman. To the souls departed it is not profitable
For why / those that are in case dampnable
No assistence of prayour can attain.
And as for purgatory there is none
Allthough there be clerks many one
Which to seek it take much pain.

Husbondman. Than I would their prayenge were at an end
For if they pray long thus so god me mende
They shall make y^ land worsse than naught.
But now I will rehearce seriously
How we husbandemen full pituously
Unto miserable wrechednes are brought.
First when england was in his flowers
Ordered by the temporal gouernoures
Knowenge no spiritual iurisdiccion.
Than was there in each state and degree
Haboundance and plentuous prosperity
Peaceable welthe without affliccion.
Noblenes of blood / was had in price
Vertuousnes avaunced / hated was vice
Princes obeyed / with due reverence.
Artificers and men of occupacion
Quietly wanne their sustentacion
Without any grefe of nedy indigence.
We husband men like wise prosperously
Occupyenge the feats of husbandry
Hyerd fearmes of price competent.
Whereby our lyninge honestly we wanne
And had enough to pay every manne
Helpinge other that were indigent.
Till at the last the ravenous clergy
Through their craftynes and hypocrisye
Gate to them worldly dominacion.
Than were we ouercharged very sore
Our fearmes set up daily more and more
With shameful price in soche a fasshyon.
That we pay more now by half the sum
Than a fore times we did of custom
Holdinge ought of their possession.
Beside this / other contents of brybery
As payenge of tithes / open and preuy
And for herynge of confession.
Also presies duties and clerks wages
Byenge of perdones and freres quarterages
With chirches and aultares reparacion.
All our charges can not be nombred
Wherewith we are greatly acombred
Over whelmyd with desolacion.
We tourmoyle our selfs night and day
And are feign to drink whygge and whaye
For to maynteyne the clargyes facciones

Gentillman. This were a great shame to be known
Seeing half the realm is their own
That they charge you with soche exaccions.
Me thyncketh so to do is no small crime
For they kept as good houses a fore time
Whiles their feanne hyers was ferrelesse.

Husbandman. Ye / more plentuous houses a great deal
How be yt in hyndrynge the comone (...) eale
They use also this practyse doutles.
Where as poor husband men before season
According unto equite and reason
House or land to fearme did desire.
Without any difficulte they might it get
And yet no higher price was there up set
Than good conscience did require.
But now their ambicious suttlete
Makes one fearme of two or three
Ye some time they bring. vi. to one.
Which to gentillmen they let in farmage
Or else to rich merchants for avauntage
To the undoing of husbandeman ^ch one.
Whereby the comones sufferinge damage
The holelande is brought into rerage
As by experience ye may well see.
Thus is the wealth of village and town
With the fame of honorable renown
Fallen into my scrable pouerte.
Plentnous housholdes hereby ar dekayde
Relefe of poor people is away strayde
Allmes exyled with hospitalyte.
By soche means / all thing waxes dear
Complaynte of subiecres cryenge far and ne^
Oppressed with grenous calamyte.

Gentillman. Truly thou show the very abuse
Nevertheless concerning our excuse
Why we gentillmen fearmes occupye.
The principal occasion is only this
That our patrimony given away is
Unto these wolffes of the clergy.
By whose oppression we are so beggeryd
That necessite has us compellyd
With fearmes soche shyft to make.
For asye husbandmen can well understand
Touching expenses and charges of the land
They disdain any part with us to take.

Husbandman. Ye by seynte Marye / I you warrante
In soche cases / their aid is very scant
Making curtesye to do any good.
Let the realm go what way it wull
They having ease / and their belyes full
Regardelitle the comone weal by the rode
If princes demand their succor or aid
This answer of them is comonely said
We are pore bedemen of your grace.
We pray for your disceaced auncetryes
For whom we sing masses and dirigees
To succor their souls in needful case.

Gentillman. Oh / they afoorde prayers good cheap
Saying rather many masses by heap
Than to give a poor man his dinner.
Wherefore as thou saydest / so god help me
I se of their prayenge no comodyte
Nether a^untage in any manner.
For why with in these. iiij. hundred year
Thorough out christendom was not a free^
Of these / whom we mendicantes call.
And sith that time diverse facciones
Of collegianes / monks and chanones
Have spread this region over all.
Also of prestes / were not the tenthe part
Which as they say / have none other ar^
But for us worldly people to pray.
And yet the world is now far worsse
As every man felyth in his poorsse
Than it was at that time I dare say.
Wherefore the truth openly to betryde
I would they should lay their prayenge a side
And give them selfs to labor bodily.

H^sbandman. It were hard to bring them thereto
Utterly refusing any labor to do
Because they are people gostely.

Gentillman. Were not the apostles gostely also?

Husbandman. Yes sir / but it is solonge ago
That their living is out of memory.

Gentillman. We find it well in the new testament.

Husbandman. The clargye say / it is not conuenyent
For layemen therewith to be busye.

Gentillman. Wotest thou wherefore they do that?

Husbondman. In faith sir I conjecture somewhat
And I suppose I do not m^che err.
Might men the scripture in English read
We secular people should than se in deed
What Christ and the apostles lives were.
Which I dout nothing are contrary
Unto the living of our clargye
S^uyn to pomp^us ydlenes every where.
Whose abhominacion ones known
Their pride should besone over thrown
And few would their statelynes for bear.

Gentyllman. Thou hyttest the nail upon the heed
For that is the thing that they dreed
Least scripture should come unto light.
God commaundyd man in the beginning
With sweat of vysage to win his living
As Moses in his first book does write.
And as Marcke says in the. vi. chapter
Christ here upon earth was a carpenter
Not dysdayninge an occupacion.
Also the disciples universally
With their hands labored busyly
Exchewynge idle conversation.

Husbandman. Our clargye live nothing after their rate

Gentillman. No / they seek ydelly to anaunce their estate
And to be had in reputacyon.

Husb^ndman. Are they worldly (...) ^ely to say the tr^the?

Gentyllman. So god help me I^e we none of both
As it apperyth by their fasshion.
For in matters of worldly busynes
The clergy have much more ^tresse
Than temporal men I ensure the.
The lands of lords and dukes to possess
They abasshe not a whit the seculernes
Chalengynge tytles of worldly honor
But is the realm in any necessyte
Where as they should condescend of ducte
To stand by their prince with succor
Than to be of the world they deny
Saying that their help is spiritually
From the world making a separacion.

Husbandman. Whiles they use soche craftynes to contryue
The temporalte ought them to depryue
Of their worldly dominacyon.
And even as they say that they are gostely
So without any assistence worldly
To live gostely they should have no let.

Gentillman. That were an expedyent medicyne
According unto saint Paul's doctrine
Qui non laborat / non manducet.
Nowithstanding their power is so strong
That whether they do right or wrong
They have their own will without fail.
Their enormities so far out breaks
That all the world against them speaks
But alas man what does it avayle:

Husbondman. The remedy that I can ymagyne
Were best that we together determyne
To get us to london incontinent.
Where as it is here for a suretetolde
The king with his nobles does hold
A general counsel or parliament

Gentillman. What would thou that we should do there?

Husbondman. The constraynte of our myserye to declare
Under a meke form of lamentacion.

Gentillman. So should we be sure of soche answers
As were made unto the poor beggars
For their pituous supplicacyon.
Against who^ ye clergyes resons naught worth
The souls of purgatory they brought forth
The beggars complaynte to discomfyte.
Wherefore against our peticion I the tell
They would bring out all the deuells in hell
For to do us some shameful despyte.

Husbondman. And was there none other way at all
But the sonles of purgatory to call
In aid and assistence of the clergy.

Gentillman. It was the suerest way by saint Ihone
For had they to plain scripture gone
I wousse they had be taken tardye.
The beggars complaynte was so grounded
That the clargye had be confounded
Had they not to purgatory hasted.

Husbondman. Where said they purgatory should be?

Gentillman. By scripture they showed no certente
Albeit with stowte words they it faced.
Even like unto the man / which meant
A certain strange ylonde to invent
But when he sawe^ could it not fynd^.
Least his wit and travail should seem in vain
Report of other men he began to feign
The symplicite of rude people to blind.
But touching our communicacion
There is another consideracion
Which somewhat more troubles my mind.
Thou know that in the parliament
The chief of ye clergy are resident
In a marvelous great multitude.
Whose fearce displeasure is so terrible
That I judge it were not possible
Any cause against them to conclude.
As for this ones we shall not be herd
And great men I tell the are a ferde
With them to have any doing.
Whosoever will against them contend
Shall be sure of a mischefe in the end
Is he genttllman lord or king.
And that unto king Ihon I me report
With other princes and lords a great sort
Whom the chronicles express by name.
Whiles they were a live they did them trouble
And after their death with cruelnes double
They ceased not their honor to diffame.
Did not they so long strive a wrestle
Against the good knight sir Ihon oldecastle
Other wise called lord of ^obham.
That from high heresye unto treasone
They brought him to fynall destruction
With other many a noble man.
Moreover at saint Edmu^des bury some say
That the famous prince duke Humfray
By them of his life was abreuiate.
Sithe that time I could reckenmo
Whom they caused to be dispatched so
Parauenture some of no low estate.

The husbandman. Their tyranny is great without fail
Nevertheless if we would them assail
With arguments of the holy gospel.
They should n^ be ones able to resist
For the words of our savior christ
Should stop them were they never so fell.
Who in the. xxiij. chapter of saint Luke
To their great confusyon and rebuke
Forbydeth secular ambicion.
Wherein he himself example gave
Contempnynge worldly honor to have
Of this world claymynge no kingdom.
Also when his disciples forth he sent
He commanded them to be content
With food and apparayle necessary.
Whereto saint Paul's doctrine according
Says: having mea^ d^inke and clothinge
We should no thing cover super^uosly.

Gentillman. If the holy gospel allege we should
As strong heretic sta^e us they would
Unto their church disobedient.
For why they have commanded straytely
That none under great pain be so hardye
To have in english the testament.
Which as thou know at London
The bishop making ther^ sermon
With shameful blasphemy was bre^.

Husbondeman. Alas that cruelte goes to my heart
Wherefore I fear me we shall all sm^rt
At length with bitter punisshment.

Gentillman. Undouted it is greatly to be fearyd
Least the hole region shall be plagyd
For their outrageous blasphemy.
In king Henryes days of that name ye fyft
The clergy their pride above to lift
Persecured christen brothers haynously.
The gospel of Christ a side to cast
Which at that time prospered fast.
With all their puysau^ce they did conspyre.
Every where they threw them in presones
In sharp gayles / and horrible doungeones
Causynge many to be brent in fire.
Their furious malice never stentyd
Till they had the light out quenchyd
Of the gospel and holy scripture.
Whereof all books that they could get
They caused on a fair fire to be set
To expel gods word doing their cure.
But consider what there of did chance
Most terrible plages of fearful vengeance
And endless sorrow to our nation.
For within short season after they lost
Which many a man's life did cost
In france their dominacion.
Among them selfs most hateful mourdre
Many strong batayles / one after another
With great effusyon of englisshe blood.
Friend against frede / brother against brother.
Every man at variaunce with other
The realm long season in myschefe stood^

Husbondman. This is now a days clean out of mind

Gentillman. I pray god / hereafter we do not find
The same vengeance for like offense
For as it is in the bible plainly red
God left never land yet unpunished
Which against his word made resistance.

Husbondman. Well sir / if scripture ye forth bring
I beseech you / what is their answeringe
Are they so bold gods word to deny:

Gentillman. ^aye but after their ymaginacion
They make there of an interpretacion
Unto the text clean contrary
They allege the popes auctorite
Customs of ancient antiquite
With diverse counseiles approbacion.
Also the holiness of religious fathers
With the blood sheadinge of marters
For their chirches preservacion.
Beside that contynuaunce of years
Miracles of bishops / monks and freres
Whom for special patrones they hold.
And finally to make a conclusion
In fortefyenge their abusion
Other practyses they use many fold.
They resort to lords and great estates
With whom they are daily check mates
Ye to say therrouthe their soucraynes.
Where among other communicacion
They admonish them with protestacion
To beware of these heretics Lutheranes.
Whom they say is a sect new fangled
With execrable heresies entangled
^inge the chirches perdicion.
Which our fore fathers as wise as we
Were content with humble simplicite
To honor / obeynge their tuycion.
Also none presumed till now a late
Against the clergy to bear any hate
Or grudged at their possession.

Husbondman. By saint mary sir / that is a starcke lie
I can show you a work by and by
Against that point making objection.
Which of warantyse I dare be bold
That it is above an hundred year old
As the english self does testifye.
When the auctour with arguments
S^th against the lordshippes and rentes
Of the clergy possessed wrongfully.

Gentillman. Is itso old as thou do here express
Reprouynge their pompous lordlynes
So is it than no new found heresy.

Husbondman. No! but alas / half the book we want
Having no more left than a remenant
From the beginning of the. vi. chapter verily.

Gentillman. As for that it makes no matter
Begin hardely at the sixte chapter
Redynge for the to the end seriously.
For though old writings apere to be rude
Yet notwithstanding they do include
The pithe of a matter most fructuously.

Husbondman. To read it I shall be diligent
Though the style be nothing eloquent
With ornate speech set out curiously.

Here follows an old trearyse made about the time of king Richard the
second.
WHere as the clergy perceyueth that lordlynes and worldly dominion can not be
borne out biscripture / the^ fly they to arguments of me^nes persuasyon
saying after this manner Saint Huge and saint Swithune were thus lor des / and
in this they ensued Christ's living and his doctrine / therefore we may be
laufully thus lords. But I wot well that Gabriel shall blow his horn or
they have proved the minor. That is / that these saints or patrones in this
sued the doctrine or the life of Jesus Christ. And of this thou may se that
soch arguments that are not clothed with Christ's lynynge or his teachinge /
beright naught worth all though the clerks blind with the^ much folk in yt
world. But here have Inoleyser to tell though I could / what chefesaunce and
costs the church makes and what werres they hold to co^tynue this fymony and
heresy so vnavisely brought in to ye church. And yet they seek all the ways
thereto that they can. Ye in so much that they go openly armyd in to the field
to kill christen men / for to get and hold soche lordshippe. And
notwithstondynge saint Peter was so pore that he had nether gold nor silver as
he says in the Acts of the apostles. And his other worldly good Act. iij.
he left / when he began to sue Christ. And as tow chynge the title of
worldly law that he had to soch worldly goods / he made never cley me ne
never resceyued after any worldly lordshippe. And yet they call all their hole
kingdom saint Peter's ground or lordshippe. And therefore saint Bernarde writes
to Engenie ye pope saying. If thou will be a lord / seek by a another Lib^. ij
way to attain it / but not by this apostles right For he may not give the
that he had not / that he had he gave / the which was busynes upon chirches.
Whether he gave lordshippe or no / here what he says. Be ye not lords in the
clergy / but be ye made form and example off i. Petri.
Christ's flock. And least ye trow this be not said of trothe take keep what
Christ says in ye gospel. The kings of hethen have lordshippe upon them /
forsot he ye not so. Se how plain ly lordshippe is forboden to all apostles /
for if thou be a lord how dare thou take upon the apostleshyp / or if thou
be a bishop / how da rest thou take upon the lordship? Pleynly thou art
forboden both. And if thou wylt have both to get her thou shall lose both /
and be of the n^mber / of which god ple^h by the prophet (...) saying. They
reygnyd but not by me says god. And if we hold that / that is forbo den /
here we that is boden of Christ. He that is greatest of you se yt he be made
as younger in symplenes / and he that is a fore goere look he be as a servant.
This is ye form of apostles life / lordshyppes forboden and seruys is boden
this says saint Bernerdethere. And therefore no man may put a another ground
besides yt that is put which is Christ Jesus.

But yet I wot well that clerks and relygyous fol^ke that love ^nkyndly these
lordlynes will gloss here and say / yt they occupre not soche lordshyppes in
proper as secular lords do / but in comone / like as the apostles and perfyte
people did in the beginnynge of Christ's church as w^yteth Saynot Luke in the
fourth chaptre of the Acts of the apostles / the which had all things in
comone / like as soche clerks and re ligyous say they have now. In tokeninge
whereof no man said of any thing at that time / this is mine / so our clerks
and namely rely gyous people whon they will speak in terms of their religyo^.
A pryuate person will not say this or this is mine / but in parsone of all his
brethren he will say / this is ours. And over this they say more s^elly
that they occupye not this by title of secular lordshyppe / but by title of
perpetual allmes. But what ever thy people say here / we mo^e take heed to
the rule of prefe that fails not. The which rule Christ teaches us in the
gospel in diverse places / where he says / believe ye the works. For why by
their works ye shall know they. And this rule is wonder needful to a man
that has a do with any man of the Pharyseys condycyones. For as Christ says
Math. xxiij. They say but they do not. And so as Christ's works be re
witness of him as he him self says / and shows what he was and how he
lived / so the deeds and manner of lyuinge / or the thing in it self bearyth
witness with out fail how it stondyth among them in this point. And if we
take heed thus by this rule we shall se at our eye how the clargye says
other wise than it is in deed. For in some place in pryuate parsone / and in
some place in comone or parsone aggregate / which is all one as saynct Austyne
says upon the psalter / y^ clargy occupyeth the secular lord ship
secularly / and so in propere. For in the same manner wise as yt Barone / or the
knight occupyeth and gouuer nyth his baronrye or his knights fe / so after
the amortesyenge occupyeth y^ clarcke / ye Mon ke / or Chanon / the College or
Conuente / the sa me lordshippe and governs it by ye same laws in judgment
and punishinge as presonnynge and hanging with soche other worldly turme^tyng
the which some time belongyd to the secular arm of the church. Ye often times
we may se ho we they busye them selfs to be kings in their own / and
rejoice them full much in that ciuilyte or secularite if they may get it. And
this is an evidence that they would gladly be kings of all the realm or the
world. For where their lands and secular me^nes fraunchyse ar to gether they
strive who shall have the galowes / or other manner tourme^tes for fela^nes.
They keep also under bondage their tenauntes and their issue with their lands.
And this is the most ciuilite or secular lordshyppinge that any king or lord
has on his renau^tes And therefore we may se how they cleyme in their goods
a manner of proper possessyon contrary to the c^monnynge of the comone goods
in time of the perfyte me^ in the beginning of Christ's church. And so what
so ever the clergy says the deed shows well that they have not their goods
in comone like as Christ with his apostles and perfyte men had in the
beginning of christ's church. For in holding or having of their goods / is
properte of possessyon and secular lordshippin ge. The which stondith not with
ye plente of chri stes perfeccyon in prestes as it sueth of this pro cesse and
of that / that is declared before. And as for that other gloss that clerks
have here / where they say that they hold these lordshyppes by title of
perpetual alms. But here ye shall understands at mercy or alms is a will
Alms.
of releuinge of some wretch out of his my sese as Lyncolniensis says in
the beginning of his dicris. So that if a man should effectually Dicto. (...)
do alms he must look to whom he should do alms to / were in my sease and
had need to be releuyd. In tokeninge whereof / christ only assigns alms to
those / in whom he marketh my sease. And so here of this it will sue / that if a
man will releue one wretch and make a another or ^o / he does none alms /
but rather makes mysease. And much more he does none al mess if he make
rich those persons that have no need. For as much as they be sufficient to
them selfs / this has no color of alms. For this may be better called a
woodnes or a wasting of gods goods. And over this if a man take those goods
/ the which god in the best wise even and with out erroures has assygned to
the state of secular lords / and give those goods to another people that has
no need of them / ye to ye which people soche goods are forfendid. This should
be called no alms / but peruertinge of gods ordinance / and the
destruction of the state of secular lords ye which god has approved in his
church. For as saint Paul says. Alms deed should be ruled so ye ij. Cori.
viij.
it were releui^ge to those ye receive it. And much rather it should not be
undoing of those that do it. And therefore Christ teachith in the gospel to do
alms of the things that be nedeles or super fluite. And in this deed a man
should have regard Quoth superest da te ^lemo sina^. Lu ce. xiiij.
to the need of him that he does alms to and to the charge of his own house.
What alms was it then I pray you / to undo the state of the Emperor / and
to make the clerks rich with his lordshippes / namely sith Christ confirmyd
to ye Emperor his state / with tho things that long thereto / notwithstonding
at that time the emperor was hethen. And he has forfendyd expressly his
clergy in word and in exa^ ple soche lordshyppe. And as this was no allmes /
so we mote say of other kings / dukes and earls / barons and knights that
are undone hereby / and the clerks made rich and worldly lor des with their
goods. And though it had be so yt the clergy might have occupied thus worcester ldly
lordshyppe / and also though it had be no de struccion nor appeyrynge of any
other state / yet it had be no allmes for to give to them soche goods /
wherefore it may be ryghtfully said. No man may put a another ground besides
that is put / which is Christ Jesus.

Here we may se by the ground of y^ gospel and by the ordinance of christ /
that the clergy was sufficiently purueyd for lyuelood. For god is so perfyte
in all his werckynge / yt he may ordeyne no state in his church but if he
ordeyne sufficient lyuelood to the same state. And this is open in gods law
who so takyth head / and that under every law of god / as under ye law of
innocencye and of kind / under ye law given by Moses and also under ye law
given by chri ste. In ye time of the state of innocencye we know well by
believe ye god had so ordained for man kind that it should have had lyuelood
enough without any tedious labor And of ye law of kind / christ speakyth
in ye gospel sayen Mat. v^
ge thus All things ye ye will y^ other men do to you / do ye to them. And if
this law had be kept there should no man have been myscheuously nedy. And in
the time of ye law given by Moses / god made a full and a sufficient
ordinance for all his people how and where by they should live. For he dealyd
ye land among the lay people and he assygned y^ first fruits and tithes to
ye prestes and deakenes. And all though yt he would yt there should be all way
pooremen in ye land of ysraell / yet he made an ordinance Seu^e. (...).
against myscheuous need. And comandyd all the people that there should be in no
wise a nedye man and a beggar among them as it is written. And so in this law
he ordained sufficiently enough for his people. And in ye time of the new law
christ assigned ye seculer lordshyppes to temporal lords as it is taught
before / And allowed ye comonte her lyuelood gotten by true marchaundyse and
husboundrye and other craf tys. And in word and ensaumple he taught his
prestes to be proctoures for nedye people and poor at y^ rich men / and
specifyed these poor / and taught how they that were mighty / should make a
purueau^ce for soche poor folk yt they were not constrained by need for to
beg / as great clerks marcke upon these words of ye gospel where christ
says thus. When thou make thy feast / yt is of allmes / call poor people /
feeble / lame and blind* He says not let soche pooremen Luc^. xiiij.
call upon ye / but call thou upon them meanyn ge in yt / that thou should
make a purueaunce for soche people / yt they be not myscheuously fa^ tie. And
for ye clergy he ordained sufficiently / reching them in word and ensample
how they should hold them appayde with lyuelood and hylynge mynistred to
them / for their true labor in the gospel as it is written before. Of this
than thou may se how god in all his la was has sufficiently ordained for
all y^ stares that be founded and approuyd And how it is against ye goodness
and wysdom of god / to ordeyne any state / but if he ordained sufficient
lyuelood thereto. Sith than this ordenaunce of god was sufficient as well for
the clergy as for other men it seems a foul presumpcion to bring in a new
and a contrary ordinance of lyuelood for clerckes upon the ordinance yt
Criste has made for them before. Of ye which ordinance / the clergy full
many years after the beginning of Christ's church / when it was best
gouuernyd / held them well a paid. For this means that Christ's ordinance
was insufficient / and worthy to be undone And if we take good head / they
had no more need to pl^y ne them of this ordinance / than had the other
two states of his church / which unto this day hold them a paid with this
ordinance of christ / were it fully kept. And more sekirnes and ensurau^ce
may no man make of any thin ge than christ has of his lyuelood to the clergy
For christ not only affermyth to ye people yt he will not fail them in
lyuelood and hylinge / but also prouyth this by arguments yt may not be
assoyled / So yt they be true servants to him. For Christ meanyth thus in
his argu ynge there. Sith god fails nor bryddes and lyles and grass that
grows in ye field / nether herhen men. How much rather shall he not fail
his true servants? And so this purneaunce of perpetual alms yt our clerks
spea ke of / meanyth fault of believe and despeyre of the gracious governance
of god. Sith than as it is said before / it is no allmes to releue one wretch
and to make another or moo / and to make they rich with temporal lordshippe /
the which be ne forfendyd to soche people and namely if soche al mes geuynge
be destroyenge or appeyringe of any state approuyd by God in his church / it
willsue that the endowynge of ye clargye with worldly lordshippe / ought not to
be called allmesse / but rather all a mysse / or wasting of gods goods or
destroyenge of his ordinance / for as much as the clergy was sufficiently
ordained be Christ. For why / this alms that clerckes speak of here / made
many wretches and it was given to them that had no need. And ^s it is em^y
(...) not only of one estate of ye church / but of all (...) of the which I
spoke in ye begynynge. And so this alms geuynge has made all our realm nedy
/ ye and as I suppose fullnygh all christendom full poor and nedy and
mischeuous over that it should have been if the clargye had held them a paid
with christ's ordinance. But now thou rough this perpetual all a mysse /
that the clerks call alms / christ's ordinance is vndo^ in some lands holly
and in England for yt more party and it is lykely to be all undone in process
of time. For by a mortesy enge of lordshippes / ye lords be yndone in great
party. And many noble me^ because they lack their own part through folishe
gift of their aunceters be full nedy. Forthermore it may be understood of
this process / yt withdrawyng of this lordshippes from ye clergy and
restoringe again of the^ to the states yt god has assigned the^ to / should
not be called robbery of holy church as our clerks faye / but rather
rightwise restitucio^ of good wrongfully and theefly with old. And therefore
there may none oath or vow bind any man to maytayne this theft and
destruccio^ of gods ordinance / and this great harming of Christ's church.
As y^ vow of Iepte should not have bound him to kill and sacrifice his own
daughter. Ne the oath of herod should not have bound him to kill innocent
Ihon. But as Iepte should a broken his oath or vow and have offered a another
thing that had been pleasynge to god and according with his law: As saint
Austyne says upon the same storye. So Herod should have broken his oath and a
saved innocent blood and sore a repented him for his vnavysed swerynge. And so
should lords now a days break they: oaths that they have vnavysely and
without counseyle of holy scripture sworn to maynteine this theefte / ye
heresy and symony as it is proved before / the which our clerks call
perpetual alms And not sue their folishe deeds and oaths yt they have made
to maynteyne this mischeuous peruertinge of chhristes ordinance. For as the
sta te of the clergy has no power or leave / to make the people or lords to
sin deadly or to destroy gods ordinance in his church. So they have no
leave or power of god to counceile or to ^oke well ^ponthis ^ason
constrayne in any case the lords or y^ people to swear for to maynteyne this
endowe^ge of ye cler kes and religious folk / which is full great theft
heresy and symony / and wounder harmefull to chri stes church as it is showed
in this process and in other written before. But the lords specially should se
here / what were pleasynge not to these clerks / but to god / and that should
they do. For her to they be bound by virtue of their office up pain of
dampnacio^. And there may no no man dispense with the^ of yt bound stondinge
her sta te. For no man should put another ground besides that / yt is put which
is christ Jesus.

And therefore me^ deem it a great sin to ge ue land entayled by men's law
from ye par sone or kynred that it is entayled to / ye although it be so that
the parsone or kynred that soche lan de is given to be nedye and have leave by
gods law to occupye soche manner land or lordshippe. And this is demyd full
great sin among the people not only to the geuer but also to the taker. For
both they do dampnable wrong to him that it is entayled to / as the people
demyth ye although it be given for good and true service that the receyuer has
done to the geuer before / or else by way of alms of releuynge of the perone
or kindred that it is given to. How much rather than I pray you without compa
rison is it a greater sin / as well to the reacey ners as to the geuers / to
take the lordeshippes / the which god that has full lordshippe upon all the
world has given by perpetual law or right to the state of secular lords /
and give this from the state to the which god entayled this lordshippe to
another strange people off another line / the which had never neade / ne
leave of god to occupye it. And if priests cleymetythes because god granted
them to y^ kynred of leuy / yet there argument is void. For chri ste came of
the lynage of Judah / to which line was no tithes granted and so as men suppo
se this entayle was not confermyd by christ and his apostles to the priests
in the new law. Polic^ Lib. vii.


For Gregory the tenthe ordained first tithes to be paid to curates only. And
yet they clcyme so forforthe tithes that no man may lawefully with hold them
or ministre than save they. Ne they may be turned or given to any other state
or kynred save only to them. All though men would do that under color or by
title off perpetual allmes. For this should be demyd of the clergy a
dampnable sin and destroyenge of holy church and sacrilege. How much rather
is it then an hydeous and dampnable sin / to give or to take away the
secular lordship pes from the state of secular lords / the which god had
given and entayled to them by the same law and right / by the which he had
given the tithes to the priests in the old law. And this entayle was never
interrupt nor broken unto christ's time and his holy apostles. And than they
co^fermed this entayle by law so strong to the seculer part yt no man (save
Antichriste and his disciples) may openly impu^gne this entayle as it is showed
before. And so as no man should presume to withdraw with hold or turn the
tithes from the state of presthod / as they say / so much rather should no man
presume by genynge or taking to aliene ye temperall lordshippes from the state
of seculer lords. And thus clerks ha ue nor so much color to say yt the
lords and the lay people rob the^ for as much as they ta ke their
temperalties in to y^ hands of ye clergy has never the less malice in it
self. For as mo che as it is done by simulacio^ of holiness / ye whi che is
double wickedness. For thus Lucifer robbed Ada^ both of goods of fortune / of
kind and Gene. iij
yet does the church of these three manner goods. For right as lucifer did this
harm to Adam and Eve under color of love and frendshippe and helpinge of
the^: so do now his angell's / those ypocrites that tranfigure the^ selfs
into angels of light / and deceive ye people by false beheste of heavenly help
yt they will procure to them for their goods as they say / and if a bishope
and his college oe an abbate and his convent may not aliene fro the^ any of ye
temporalties yt they have / nor ge ue to their founder any of those possessions
that he has given the^ / what need that ever he have / bo unde (...) by a
posityfe law or a tradicio^ that they the^ self save made. And if any foche
lord ships be withdrawn / aliened / or taken fro the by rechelesnes of their
predecessoures / they ought on all wise / ye to the death labor to get ye
possessiones in to their hondes again as they say: How much more than should
not a secular lord or a lay al^ne fro him and his issue or fro the state of
secular lords / ye secular lordship pes the which god has lymyted to that
state / sith he is bound by the law of kind to ordeyne for his childern. And
ou^ this he is bound by gods law to sustain the state of secular lor des /
the which is auctory sed in the church and his aposiles. Of this process
than if a man take heed he shall perceive the fals^s of this glo se / when our
clerckes and religions folk say that they hold these lordshippes only by
title of perpetual allmes. For certis sith these tithes and offerynges the
which as I suppose counteruayle the secular lords re^s of the realm or else
pass as it is full lyely / for though they belesse in one chirde they pass in
a another and be sufficient for all the poi^ in ^istendome if they were (...).
Than it were no need to (...) se secular lordshippes to the sta te of the
clergy. The which amortesyenge is undoing of lords / apost^ of the (...).
And if this amor^enge were not needful / then were it no allmes as it is
declared. And over the tithes and offerynges that be now off certeyn^e / the
clerckee have many great and small perquysytis / the which sma^ of symonye and
^cion. As the first fruits of (...) benefyces / proving of testamentes and
money for halowenge of chapelles / chirches / chauncelles / and other
ornaments of the church / and for sa cryng of ordres / and full many mo that
for mul titude may not well be numbered. For wellnigh all their blessings be
set to sale and to prijs / in to chrystenynge and confumacion. Wherefore I may
now say as I said at the begynnige. No man may put a another ground besides
that / that is put / the which is Christ Jesus The which ground of living
christ grant us to keep that we may escape the euerlastin ge peynes of
hell. AMEN.

The husbandman. Loo / now by this treatise may ye well se
That af^etymes against the spiritualte
Men did invey / shewinge their vices.
Also here after this auctour dorhe test.
What great Ieoparde it is and perell
For priests to be in secular offices.
Ye / and rolordes which against right
Suffer them therein or thereto excyte
Proving it by their own doctors and laws

Gentillman. I besechethe read forth the process
That the people may se their unhappenesse
Which make all the world foles and dawes.
Saint Eipriane says yt by the counceile of bisshops there is made a statute /
that all y^ been ^ist. xxi. (...). iij. ca. ^ipriane
charged with priesihede and ordained in ye seruys of clerfes / should not serve
but to the altar and to ministre y^ sacraments / to prcache gods worcester de / and
to tale head to prayers and orysones. It is for sorhe written. No man bering his
knighthosde to god: entryketh him with secular needs. The which our bisshops
and our predecessors beholdinge religiously and purueynge holsomly / deem
that whosoever takes ministres of ye church / from spiritual office to
secular / that there be none offrynge done for him / ne any sacrifice ho lowed
for his sepulture. For they deserve not to be named before ye altar of god in
ye prayer off priests / the which will clep^ away priests and ministres of
y^ church from ye altar. Thus says saint Cipaiane. Here me^ may se how
perelous it is to ye king and secular lords to with hold any priest of
christ in secular busynes. This is pro ued thus. For every secular lord by the
law of the gospel is gods bailey. But if any bailey hy red a worclman with his
lords good and put him to his own seruys / he must be untrue to his own
lord. Right so is any secular lord to our lord Christ Jesus / but if he
amend him / that takes a priest and puts him in his secular office
breafinge the heest of his lord god that commands / thou shalr coueyet none
other man's servaunte. And he with draws him fro the seruys of god and fro
the kepinge of chri sten men's souls / yt which he has taken char ge of /
for which souls our lord Jesus Christ took flesche and blood and suffered
hard death / and shed his own heart blood. This pardous deynge of secular
lords is both against gods law and man's. It is against gods law for as
saint Paul says. No man yt is a perfyte ij. Chi. ij
knight of god / as every priest should be by his or dre / e^tromedleth him with
worldly deades and busynes. And for this end that he may so please ye lord to
whose service he has put him self / and that is good. For soche worldly
busynes in clerks is against their order. And therefore y^ apost les said as it
is written in ye deeds of y^ apostles / it Acto. vi
is nor eue^ / us to leave ye word of god and ministre to boordes of poor
folk. And if it was vnequi te as the apostles said in their comone decree /
them for to leave ye preachinge of gods word / and ministre to the boordes
of poor folk: How much more vnequite and wrong to god and man is it /
preastes to leave contemplacion / study / prayer and preachinge of gods
worand ministrynge to poor folk for the servyce of a secular lord? It is
also against the Popes law / for he speaks to a bisshoppe and byddeth him
that he warn preastes and clerckes / Lin^. iij. de ^e. in fine
that they be not occupied in secular offices ne procurators of secular lords
deades and her goo des. And if presies and clerckes be so bold to occupye
them in soche busynes and if they fall after by loss of lords goods / then
says the law it is not worthy yt they be helped and socoured of holy church
/ sithe through there holy church is sclaundred. And saint Gregorye wrote to
the defensoure of Rome in this manner. It is told to us that our most
reuere^te brother Sasyle ye bishop is occupied in secular causes and kepith
unprofitable moote halles. Which thing makyth him foul and destroys y^
reverence of presthood / therefore anon as thou have rea ceiued this ma^deme^t
/ compel him with sharppe execucion to turn a gain. So yt it be not lefull
to y^ by no excusacion totarye five days / lest in any manner thou suffer him
any longer to tarry there in / thou be culpable with him against us And so
bysshoppes and other prestes be bound to teach and e^forme lords / to
withdraw them fro this sin and sharply to reprove prestes and cura tes
under the^ yt they occupye no secular office. This is proved thus by ye holy
prophet Ezechiell saye^ge. If ye wait or y^ watchema^ se enemies Ezechie.
xxxiij.
come / and if ye people be not warned and keep not the^ selves but enemies
come and ^sle ye people / the^ says god that ye people is take in their
wicked nes. And of ye wait yt should have blown his horn god will are
acountes and rekeninge of the blood and of the death of yt people. But now
to gostely understanding / every bisshoppe should be a wait or a warche man /
totell and warn before to all ye people by his good lyuinge and reachin ge ye
perell of sin / and this is ye reason why bisshopes and other prelates and
presies should not be occupied with worldly deades and causes. For so che
occupacio^s and charges make prestes slepinge and slomobringe in sin. And
therefore it is great perell to make over the^ gostly waytes and watcheme^ / as
bisshopes / parsones / vicarres / y^ be^ slepers in lusts of ye flesh and in
slomebernes and blinded with powder of couctyse of worldly deades yt they
nether ca^ ne may keep the^ selfs ne no another man. For of this perell and
soche other / a prelate that has wit and cunninge should sharply reprove and
warn all manner men to the shedinge of his oune blood as christ did And if he
so leave and blame not the^ he assen tyth to their trespases and synneth
deadly. For as says Malach. Prestes lips keep cunnin ge and the people
shall ask the law of god of his Mala. ij
mouth / for he is the Angel of god / if he keep well the order and degree of
presthood. And therefore it is not lefull to any man to draw to seculer offices
and busynes ye messangeres of christ / that has so utterly for fendyd them
both in word and dead secular offices in presthood. etc.


Husbandman. Sir how like ye now this oldetreatyse
If so be noble men would it aduertyse
Putting a part pryuate affeccion.
Should they not perceive here euydently
That the clergy does them great injury
Retaynynge thus temporal possessyon?

Gentyllman. Now I promise the after my judgment
I have not hard of soche an old fragment
Better groundyd on reason with scripture.
If soche (...) things might come to ly ght
That noble men had ones of them a s^ght
The world yet would change perauenture
For here against the clergy can not bercke
Saying as they do / this is a new wercke
Of heretykes contryued lately.
And by this treatise it apperyth plain
That before our days men did compleyn^
Against clerks ambycyon so stately

Husbandman. Concerning this treatise and like matters
I have hard say of my fore fathers
Bow in king henry the. v. raygne.
What time as ye did specyfye
The clergy persecutyd the gospel fercely
Causynge much chryste^ people to be slain
The king at the last having informacyon
Thourough seryous consyderacyon
Of soche proper matters as this is.
Began to note the clergyes tyranny
And what temporaltees / they did occupye
Their spiritual state far a mysse.
Wherefore he determined certeynly
To depryue them temporally
Of all their worldly gouuernaunce.
Whose pretense / as soon as they perceived
Among them selfs they Imagyned
To get the king over in to france.
That whiles he conqueryd there his right
In england do what they list they might
Their froward ^yranny to fulfill.
Which counseil / thus brought to pass
The king ever after so busyed wasse
That he could not perform his said will.

Gentyllman. So moore I the / it was happy for the king
That by soche a color they could him bring
From medlynge with that case any more.
For had he it ones ernestly begone
They had put him to a confusyon
Euene as they did other kings before.

Husbandman. What suppose ye they would have done?

Gentyllman. Mary / first with a fair interdyccion
To coursse the land as black as pytche.
Than to inhybyt saying and singing
Of mattyns / mass / and belles ryngynge
With christen bury all of poor and rich.
Beside that precheres every where
Should have brought men in soche fere
By their threatnynge exclamacyon.
That their malycyous party to take
Subgettes should their prince for sake
Contrary to gods ordynacyon.
Euene as they did in high Germany
To the Emperor jews of Bauerye
Whom Pope Ihone sought to confound
And so did the clergy as Ivnderstande
Unto king Ihon here in England
To king Sreuen / and henry the secounde.

Husbandman. They say king Ihone was poisoned
Because an half penny lofe of brced
Besayde / he would make worth. xij. pence.

Gentillman. Tushe that is a cast of their common gyse
Soche infamy of princes to deuy^e
To cloak their oune tyrannous vyolence.
For had not king Ihon gene about
From their temporaltees to put them ow^
Be had been long after a lives man.
But murder they never so shamefully
They can give it a cloak full craftily
Saying / nobis non licer occidere quenq^*
When they brennyd the new testament
They pretended a zele very fervent
To maynteyne only gods honor.
Which they said with protestacyon
Was obscured by translacyon
In english / causynge much error.
But the truth plainly to be said
This was the cause why they were a frayde
Least lay men should know their iniquite.
Which through gods word is so vttred
That it were not possible to be suffered
If to read scripture men had lyberte.
Also after the same manner a fasshyon
Subtelly to color their abhomynacyon
They destroyed cronicles not long a gone.
Which for certain points irreverently
Soundynge against the kings aunce^rye
As they say / were brent every chone.
But for all that / they should have been spared
From burning: had they not so declared
The clergyes abhomynable excess.

Husbandman. I suppose then / that they use the same ways
In burning of heretykes now a days
Whom they pursue with great furyousne^.

Gentillman. No fail / they persuade temporal men
These heretykes (as they say) to brenne
Least other good christians they should ifecte
But ye cause why they would have them rydde
Is only that their unhappiness now hid
They dreede least they should openly detecte

Husbandman. By my troth it is nothing vnlickly.
For let one live never so wyckedly
In abominable scandalisacion.
As long as he will their church obaye
Not refusing his tithes duly to pay
They shall make of him no accusacion.
Howbeyt let him ones begin to pynche
Or withdraw their tithinge anynche
For an heretic they will him ascite.
Wherefore I wonder much of the temporalte
That in performyngethe clargyes cruelte
To burn soche parsones they have delight.

Gentillman It is no merueil if th^n marcke well
The clargye saying yt it is gods quarrel
Their mischeuous murdre to execute.

Husbandman. So they are not a known by their will
That it is their cause christen men to kill
But the fault unto other they impute.

Gentyllman. Touching that / another time atleyser
I shall show the more of their manner
But now I can not ^ary verily.

H^sbandman. Well sir / if ye may no longer abide
Our lord be your continnall gyde
Grauntiuge y^ troth to be known openly.

A compe^dious oldetreatyse / showing / how that we ought to have the
scripture in English.
Thexcusacyon of ye treatise
Though I am old / clothed i barbarous wede
Nothing garnysshed with gaye eloquency
Yet I tell the troth / if ye list to take heed
Against their froward / furious frenesy
Which reckon it for a great heresy
And unto lay people grievous outrage
To have gods word in their natyfe langage
Enemies I shall have / many a shoren crown
With forked cappes and gaye croosys of gold
Which to maynteynether ambicious renown
Are glad lay people in ignorance to hold
Yet to show the verite / one may be bold
All though it be a proverb daily spoken
Who that tellyth troth / his head shall be brok^.
Unto the Reader.
GRace and peace: not that ye world geuyth / but from god the father and our
savior Jesus Christ with increace of the holy spryt be with the and all that
thirst ye truth. Ame^. Co^syderynge ye mal^ciousnes of our prelatz and their
adherentes which so fu riously bark against ye word of God / and specially
the new testament translatyd and set forth by Master William Tyndale / which
they falsely pre tend to be sore corrupt. That ye may know yt yt is only the
inward malice which they have ever had against the word of God. I have here
put in prynte a tretyse written about ye year of our lord a thousand four
hundryd. By which thou shalt plainly perceive / yt they wol de yet never from
the beginning admytte any tra^slacio^ to ye lay people / so yt it is not ye
corrupt tra^slacion yt they withsto^de. For if that were true the idle bellyes
would have had leyser Enough to put forth a another well tra^slatyd. But yt is
their own myscheuous lynyn ge y^ monith the^ according as Christ said Ihon^.
iij. Every man that workyth evil hatyth ye light / ner comyth to ye light lest
his works should be repro ued. etc. Thus may thou se that because their
works are naught and not because yt is evil translatyd / they so furiously
resyste the word of god which is the true light. For yet was there never none
translatyd but other with falshed or tyranny they put yt down. Wherefore I
exhort the reder not to co^sydre and note ye words but the matter. And pray
to god to send y^ rulers har tes to understand ye truth and further ye same
and the god of all comfort be with the AMEN

This treatise more than an. C. year old
Declares how owre prelatis do far a mysse
Which of froward presumpcion are so bold
To forbede the word of god in english
For as the prophet says blessed he is
That exercyseth him self diligently Psalm. 1.

In scripture night and day continually.
FOr to make upon antichrist I ta ke figure of king Antioche of who in^ gods
law speaks in ye bo^ of Machabeijs / for right as ^ge Antioche came in the
end wellnygh of ye old law / and bre^t the books of gods law / and
compelled ye people to do maumentry. So now Antichrist ye king off clergy that
lyuen worse then hethen presies / bre^ neth now nygh the^de of ye new law
thena^gely of Christ that is nygh^ ye end of ye world / to deceive well high
all the world / and to prove ye servants of god. For now god shall know
who will stand by his law / for Sathanas as prophets say is now unbound
and has been. CCCC. years and more for to inhabit our clergy / as he did the
clergy of the old law / but now with much more malice. For as they d^ Ye
may se it is no no uelte^s yt the bishop pes burn ye gospel.
ned Christ so now our bisshopes dampne and bren gods law / for because it
is drawn into our mother tongue. But it ought to (...) (and we saved should be)
as we shall prove by open euide^ ce through gods help. First we take
witness of Bo^tius de disciplina scolari^n / that say the that childerne
should be taught in the books off Seneke. And Bid expounds this sayen^ and
says that childerne in virtues should be taught. For the books of Seneke ben
moralles and for they be not taught thus in there youth they co^tynue still
evil maneryd and be unable to conceive the subtyle science of truth sayng /
ye wise man is as a clean myrror new pullished Wisdom shall not enter into a
wicked soul. Read to bynhode / say our masters*
And much is hereof the sentence of Bid. And Algasell in his logyke says /
the soul of man is a clean myrror new pulished in which is seyn lightly the
image of virtue. And for the people have not cunning in youth they have dark
souls and blind with ignorance / so that they profyt not in virtue but in
falsnes and malice and other vices / and much is thereof ye matter. Sythe^
hethen philosophers wolden the people to profyt in natural science / how
much more should christian clerckes will ye people to profyt in science of
virtues / for so would god. For when the law was gene^ to Moses in ye mount of
Sinai / god gave it to his people in there mother tongue of Ebrue / that all the
people should understand it / and commanded Moses to read it to them until
they understood it / and so he did / as it is plain Dente. xxxi. And E^dras
also read it in their^ mother tongue / fro morrow until none as it is plain
in the first book of E^dras Ca. viij. And he read it apertly in the streate
and the ears of ye people were intently given thereto / in so much yt the
people fell into great weping for y^ mis^es ping of ye law. Also gods law
says Deutero. xxij. that fathers should make the law known to their sons /
and the sons yt should be borne of the^ should rise and teach these things
to there son nes. And yt holy apostle saint Peter in y^ fourth chapter of his
first book speaks after this manner / saying. Whosoever speak / speak he as
ye word of god: and every man as he has taken gra ce of knowinge / so
ministre he forth to other m^ It is written plainly in the book of noumbres
Chapter. xi. When the prophet Moses had chosen seventy eldermen / and the
sprite of god rested on them and they prophesyed. Two men besides them / Eldad
and Medad / prophesyed in ye tents / and Iosue the ministre of Moses said to
Mos^s / forbid thou them. And Moses say moses let no man to prophe sye.
de / what enviest thou for me? Who shall let yt all the people prophesye / if
god give them his spirit? Also it is read in ye gospel yt sayn ct Ihon
^ua^gelist said unto Christ / lord we shall forbid one that casts out
spirits in thy name / which Luce. ix.
follows not us. And Christ said do not forbid for who so is not against us is
with us. And unto the same agreyth well the prophesy of Iohell which seynct
Petre preachinge to the Jews strongly alleged as Luke recyteth in the second
chapter of the acres of the apostles saying after this manner. That god now in
the last days shall shede out his spirit vp^ every flesch. But they say
only master do ctor ca^ un dersta^de y^ scripture.
For god says your sons and daughters should prophesy / and your young men
shall se visyons. And upon whit sond^y god gave knowledge of his law to diverse
nations without any excepci ons in there mother tongue / by the understanding of
one tongue. And of this it is notabyll sithen the lay people in the old law
had their law in there mother tongue / that the lay english people in the new
law have it as all other nations have / syns Christ bought us as he did other
and has given to us the same grace as to other. For saint Peter. Actu. xi. was
reproved for he had baptized Cornelij and his felows that we re hethen men. And
Peter answered and said If god have gevyn the same grace to them that he has
to us / who am Ithat may forbid god? As who says it lies not in the power of
men. Than who art thou yt forbiddest ye people to have gods law in there mother
tongue? we say yt thou art Antichrist himself. For Paul says. i. Corin. x.
I will every man to speak with tounges / more forsothe to prophesy / also he
says ho we shall he say Amen upon thy blessing that woteth not what thou
say. Upon this says doctor Lyre. If the people understood ye prayer of ye
Here you re own master Li ^e if ye will not here Paul.
priest it shall the better be led unto god / and the more devoutly answer
Am^. Al^o* Paul says in the same chapter. I will rather five words to be
spoken to the understanding of m^ / then ten thousand yt they understand not.
And. lxx. doctors with other m^ before the incarnacion of christ translated
ye bible out of Ebrue into Greek. And after ye ascension many translated all ye
bible in diuerselangages / as into spanysh tongue / frenshetunge / almanye / and
italy / and by many years have had it. It was hard of a worthy man of Almaynye
that ye same time was a fle^myng whose name was James Merland which tra^flated
all the bible into flemysh. For which deed he was semonned before the Pope of
great malice. And the book was taken to examinacion. And truly he approved it.
And then it was delyuerd to him again unto confusion of all his enemies.
Worshupfull Bid in his first boofe called de ges^s Anglo^m. chapter. iij.
tells that saint Oswolde the King of Northumber land asked of the skottes an
holy bisshoppe Ai dan to preach to his people / and the king him self
interpreted it in english to the people. Sythen this blessed dead of this
King is allowed of all holy church / why not now ought it as well to be
allowed / a man to read ye gospel in English to the people / sythen that
saint Paul says if our gospel be hid / it is hid A fearful saye^ ge.
in the^ that shall be dampened. And he says also he that knows not shall not
be known of god And therefore venerabilis Bid led by the spi rite of god
translated a great part of the bible into English / whose originalles ben in
many Abbeyes in England. And Cisterciensis. libro v. chaptre. xxiiij. says
that the Euangely off Ihon was drawn into English by the forsayde Bid which
Euangelye off Ihon and other Gospels ben yet in many places of so old english
that skant can any english man read them. For this Bid reigned in the year
off our lord god. vij. hundred and. xxxij. Also Cistercien. libro. vi.
chaptre. i. says that king Al red ordyned open scoles of diverse arts in
Orforde and he turned the bestlawes into hie me there tongue and the Psalter
also / he reigned in the year of our lord god. viij. hundred. lxxi^. And
saint thomas says super libru^ politic^ expounding this word / barbarus /
that barba rus is he that vnderstondyth not y^ he reads in his mother tongue.
Wherforethe apostle says If I know not the virtue of the voice to whom I
speak I shall be to him barbarus / that is to say / he understands not what I
say / nor I what he says. And so all tho prestes that un derstonde not what
they readyn by there mother tongue be called barbarus / and therefore Bid did
draw into english liberal arts lest english men should be come barbarus /
he Thomas. Also Lincoln says in a sermon that begynnith / Scriptum est de
leuitis. If any priest say he can not preach / one remedy is / resign he
up his benefyce. Another remedy if Resygne in no wise but upon a good pe^
syon.
he will not thus / record he in the meke the naked text of the sunday
gospel that he have the gross storye and tell it to the people / that is if
he understand latin / and do he this every weke in the year he shall profyt
much. For thus pre ched our lord saying. Ihon^. vi. The words that I speak
to you be spirit and life. If he do not understand latin go he to one of his
neigh boures yt understands / which will charitably expoune it to him / and
thus ^difye he his flock. Upon this argues a great clerk and faith / if it
be laufull to preach y^ naked text to ye people / it is also lefull to write
and read it to the^. Also sir William Thoris by archbishop of York did do
draw The same treatise is in ye chirch over again ste London stone at the is
hour.
a treatise in english by a worshipful clercke / whose name was Gatryke / in
the which were contained the articles of belene / the seven dedly sins / the
seven works of mercy / the. x. commaundme^tes. And sent them in small pagines
to the co^myn people to learn it and to know it / of which yet many a copye
be in england. Also Richard the heremyte of Hampole drew into english the
Psalter with a gloss and the lessons of dirige and many other treatices / by
the whi che many engleshemen have been greatly edifyed. And they be^ cursed of
god yt wolde^let ye people to be lewder the^ they ber. But many me^ now be
like unto ye fre^des of Hiob / yt whiles they enforced to defend god they
offended in hi gre uously. And though such as be slain do miracles /
nevertheless they be^ stynkynge marters. This says Richerd y^ heremyt
expouning this verse / Ne auferas de ore meo verbu^ veritatis vsquequaque. This
prophesye of christ must be fulfilled take heed
And Christ says ye me^ should deame the^ self to do great plesaunt service to
god in kill ling of his people. Arbitretur se obsequiu^ pres^a redeo. etc. Also
a man of london whose name was Wyrynge had a bible in english of northe^ spea
che which was seyne of many me^ and it ^yd to be. CC. years old. Also it is
known to many me^ in ye time of king Richerd ye. ij. yt into a parliament was
put a bible by thassent of. ii. archbisshops and of the clergy to adnusse the
bible that time translated into English with other English books of thex
posicion off the gospells which when it was hard and seyn of lords and of
the comones. The duke of Lancaster Thou answered thereto right sharply saying
this sentence / we will not be refuse of all other nations.

For sythen they have gods law which is the law of our belefe in there
own langage / we will have ours in English whosoever say nay. And this he
affermyd with a great oath Also Thomas Arundell Archebisshoppe off Canterbury
said in a sermon at wes^mester / Ypocrisy is y^ nature of all by shoppes.
at the buryenge of Quiene Anne / that it was more joy of here than of any
woman that ever he knew. For she an alien borne had in enhlishe all the.
iiij. gospels with the doctors upon them And he said that she had sent them to
him to examen / and he said that they were good and true. And he blamyd in
that sermon sharply the negligence of the prelates and other men.

In so much that he said that he would leave up the office of Chaunceler and
forsake worldly bu synes / and give him to fulfill his pastoral of fyce / for
that he had seyn / and read in tho books. And after this promise he became ye
most cruel enemy that might be against english Never trust bishop as
long as he ke^eth his possessions
books. And therefore as many men said God smo^e him with a cruel death as he
did also Richard flemyng bisshoppe of Lincoln. And yet our bisshops ben so
indurate and so far strayed from god that they have no grace one to beware of
another / but proudely against all reasons and evidence of gods laws / and
doctors sentences / they brenne gods word the which has brought thy (...)
realm to undoing for ever Where is y^ au^cie^t blood yt was in england in
these days.
but if gods grace be the more / for this cruel dead is cause of pestilence
/ hungers / wars / and that also this realm shall be conqueryd in short time /
as saynct Edward ye king and co^fessor prophesyethe in his book y^ beginnith
thus / Sa^ctus Edwardus rex vidit spiritualibus oculis. And therefore it were
good to the King and to other lords to make some remedy against this
co^stitucion of Antechrist that says it is unlawful to us englyshemen to
have in english god Et nu^c reges intelligite erudimini qui iudicatis terram.
des law / and therefore he brennythe and sleythe the^ yt maynteyne this good
dead / and that is for default that the king and lords known not ne will not
know either own office in maitena^ce of god and his law. For as saint Austen
says the Ryng with his knights representyn the godhede of Christ / and
prestes the manhood of Christ / Rex est vicarius diuinitatis / et sacerdos est
vicarius Christi humanitatis / hec Augustinus in de questionibus veteris et
noue legis. ca. xci. And if the king desyer to know perfytly his of fyce / he
may find me^ to show to him books that truly and perfytly shall inform
him to do his office to the plesaunce of god. But this can not he learn of
Byshoppys for they inform him after Antichrists law and ordenaunce for his
laws now reignen. Yet against them Bisshops will not teach against their god
their belly.
that sayn ye gospel in english would make me^ to err / wot they well yt we
find in latin langage more heretykes then of all other langages for the decre.
says. xxiiij. xciij. Quidam autem heretici / that there be founden syxty
laten heretykes. And if me^ should hate any la^gage for here sy the^ must they
hate late^. But god forbede that any la^gage should be hated for heresy sythe^
many heretykes were of ye disciples of ye apos^les. For saint Ihon^ says
they have gon^ out of us but they were not of us. And Paul says it behouyth
heresys to be / and a^tichrist maky the ma How Antich^ is can se of al heresies.
ny mo herctykes then there should be for he stoppythe so the knowing of gods
law / and punysheth so them that he knowyth y^ have it / yt they dare not
come^ thereof openly to have true informacio^ / and this makyth lay men y^
desyre^ and lou^ to know gods law to goo to gyther in pry^ (...) co^ceyuen by
their own wits many times heresys ye which heresies in shorttyme should be
destroyed / if men might have free comenyng openly / and but if this may be
had much of ye peo ple shall dye in heresy / for it lyethe never in An
tichristes power to destroy all english books for as fast as he brennethe /
other me^ shale draw / and thus ye cause of heresy and of ye people that dies
in heresy is ye frowardnes of bishops that will not suffer me^ to have opyn
comoning and fre in the law of god and therefore they be cowntable of as many
sowlys as dyen in this default / and are traitors to god in stoppynge of Is r^
this tur nin^ y^ rotys of y^ tres vpw^d
his law ye which was made in salvation of ye people. And now they turn his
law by there cruel co^stitucyo^s into da^pnacio^ of ye people as it shall be
prouyd upon the^ at the dayte of dome for gods law says / Stabunt iusti in
magna const^ tia aduersus eos qui se angustiauerunt, and qui abstulerunt
labores eorum. etc. For that the other Read Sapi^n vi. and. vii.
men labore^ they brenne^ / and if owre clergy would ^dy well this lessen of
sapi^ce to ye end / they should mow read therein their oune da^pnacion / bu^ if
they amend this defaulte with other defaultes. Says not the holy man
Ardemakan in the book of questions that ye wurshupfull sacrament of ye alter
may be made in each come^ la^ga ge. For he says so diden y^ apostles. But we
co uer not this / but y^ Antechrist give us leave to have the law of ower
believe in english. Also they y^ have comonyd much with ye Jews / say yt
they have in every land yt they be borne in / ye byblein there mothertou^ge /
yt is Ebrewe And they be more practysetherin tha^ annye men / ye as well ye
lewd m^ as ye prestes. But it is read in her synagoges amongst y^ people
ofther prestes to fulfill there prestes office and to y^ edificacion of ye
p^raile / that for worldly busynes and slewthe may not study it. Also the.
iiij. ena^gelistes wrote ye gospel in diverse langages / as Mathewe in Iurye /
Mark in Italy / Luke in Achaie / and Ihon^ in Asie. And all these wrotte in y^
la^gages of the same contreys / also T^ bye says Chap. xiij. that god
disperged / sprede / or scaterid yt Jews abroad among the hethen pe ople yt
they telling unto them ye merueylles of godde: they should know that there
were none other god / but god of Israel. And god or dyned his people to believe
his law written among them in there mother tongue / vt patet Ge. x. vij. and
Exo. xiij. In so much the ^e of Iudithe is written in Calde speech / vt patet
per Hieronimu^ in prologo eiusde^. Also the books of Daniel / and of Esdre ben
written in Calde / vt patet per Hierom. in prologis eorundem / al so the book
of Iohel is in Arabyke and Sire speech / vt patet per Hieroni. in prologo
ciusde^. Also Ezechiell the prophet prophesyed in Babylon / and left his
prophesye under the mother tongue of Babylon / vt patet per Hieronimu^ in
prologo ciusde^ Also the prophesye of Isaie is translated in to the tongue of
Ethiope / as Hie. concludyth in primo prologo Gene. Then sythen the dark
prophesyes were translated amo^ ges the hethen people yt they might have know
lege of god and of the incarnacio^ of Christ / mo che more it ought to be
translatyd to english people that have receiuyd the faith and bounden them
self to keep it upon pain of dampna cion / sythen Christ commanded his
apostles Mathei. xxviij.
to preach his gospel unto all the world and exceptyd no people nor langage.
Also Origin translated the bible out of Ebrewe into Greek with help of other
in the year of ow^ lord god CCxxxiiij. Also Aquila translated it in thery me
of Adria^ the emperor in the year of our lord. C. xxiiij. also Theodosion
tra^slaid it in ye time of the^ perowre Comede. luij. year after Aqui la / also
Simacus translated it in the time of the^ perowre Serene. xxx. year after
Theodosio^. viij year after Simacus it was translated the auctor unknown in
the time of Alexander the emperowre / And Jerome translated it into latin / vt
in cronicis Cistercien. li. ij. ca. xxxij. And after that Ierom had translated
it into laten / he translated to women much of the bible. And to the maidens
Eustochia and Paula / hetranslated the books of Iosue of Iudicum and Ruth and
Hester / and Ecclesiastes / Jeremy / Isai^ and Daniell / and the. xij.
prophets / and y^. vij. canonyke epystylles / vt patet in prologo eorundem.
And so all men may se here by Ierom / yt it was never his intent to bind ye
law of god under his translacion of laten but by his own deed geuythe leave
to translate it into every spe che / for Ierom wrytythe in his. lxxviij.
epistle to this man A^leta / that he should inform his daughter in the books
of the old law and the new / Also in his. lxxv. epistle he wrytythe to ye
virgin D^metriadis / that she should for to encre ase her self in virtue read
now upon one book / and now upon another. And he specifiethe unto her that
she also read the gospel / and the epistylles of the apostles And thus
Thenglyshemen But my lords say yt it makes men heretics and peruerteth
souls.
desire to have the law of god in english / sythen it is called the law
undefiled co^ uertyng sowlys into clennes / lex dn^i immacula ta conuertens
ai^as / but Antechrist says that it is corrupt with ye litterall lettre y^
sleyth sowlys taking his auctorite of Paul / that says / litera occidit
spiritus autem viuificat. That is the le^tre of the ceremonies of y^ old
lawesleyth the Jews / and them that nowe^sen them / but the spirit of the
new law quykenethe true Christen men / sythen Christ says my words ben
spri^te and lyffe. Also we take ensample of holy virgyns to love to read the
gospel as they d^den / as ^atheryn / Cecyle / Luc^ / Agnes / Margaret / which
alegyd the holy gospel to the infidels / that slew them for the keeping
thereof. Of these foresaid aucto rites it is prouyd laufu^l / that both men and
women laufully may read and write gods law in their mother tongue / and they
that forfenden this they show them selfs heyers and sons of the first
tormentors / and werse / for they shown them selfs the veraye dis^les of
Antichrist / which has and shall pass all the malice of tyrauntes that have been before in stoppyng and peruertynge of gods law which dead engendrythe
great vengeance to fall in this realm / but if it be amendid For Paul
says Roma. i. The wrath of god is showed from heuyn upon cruelnes and
unright fulness of these men that with holden the trowthe of god in unright
wysnes / Reuelatur enim ira dei super omnem impie^ et iniusticiam hominum eorum
qui veritatem dei in iniustitia detinent. Now god of his mercy give unto ower
king / and to ower lords grace of true understanding to amend this default
principally and all other / then shall we mow easily to be amendid. For until
it be amendid there shall never be rest and peace in this realm. Who that
fyndythe or redythe this. lettre put it furthe in examinacyon and suffer it not
to be hid or destroyed / but multyplyed for no man knows what proffyt may
come thereof. For hethat compiled it / purposyth with gods help to maintain
it unto the death / if neade be. And therefore all christen men and women /
pray that ye word of god may be unbound / and de liuered from the power of
An tichrist / and run among his people. Amen.
