A MANVDVCTION, OR INTRODVCTION UNTO DIVINITY: CONTAINING A Confutation of
Papists by Papists, throughout the important Articles of our Religion; their
testimonies taken either out of the Indices Expurgatorii, or out of the
Fathers, and ancient Records; But especially the Manuscripts.

By THO. JAMES, Doctor of Divinity, late Fellow of New-Colledge in Oxford, and
Sub-Deane of the Cathedral Church of Wells.

This mark notes the places that are taken out of the Indices Expurgatorij:
And this, a note of the places in the Parchments.

Imprinted for Henry Cripps and Henry Curteyne at ^^^ord, 1625.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, AND RIGHT REVEREND Father in God, John, Bishop of
Lincoln, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and one of his Majesty's most
Honorable privy Council.
Right Honorable, my very singular good Lord;
BEing encouraged by your Lordships favorable acceptance of some small Labors
of mine, heretofore presented unto your Honor, I presume to offer up these
few, but important and chief Articles of our Religion unto your Lordships
farther consideration, as they are maintained and explained by Primitive
Fathers, known Papists, and ancient Manuscripts, a threefold cord, which, in
my conjecture, cannot easily be broken.

As concerning the Manuscripts, they are ancient, but not many; innominable as
yet, but not long so to continue, if their names can be redeemed by any*
means; and y t they cannot well be excepted against by the common Adversary,
being written long before Luther, Hus, VVicklife, or VVal^o, as the Character
plainly shows. And if they were not old enough, it would be easy for me to
euicl the true Antiquity of our Religion, ^ut of that great Treasure of
Books, amassed together by that judicious Knight, Sir Robert Cotton, the
truest Philobiblos of our Age in his kind. For the Papists, whose words and
works are often cited by me, though the Papists would seem to elude their
testimonies, or expunge their Sentences in th^^r insufferable and unwarrantable
thrise-accursed Indices Expurgatorij; yet they speak fully and home for the
truth of ours, and the falsehood and nouellisme of their Religion: and do the
Papists what they can, as what has not been done by their close Indices? Yet
all the water in the maine Ocean will never be able to wish their testimonies
out of our Books: Ours I call them, because though bred and brought up in the
bosom of their Roman Church, they are but seeming Papists, so called, as
Montes are a non mouendo, or Pa^cae a non p^rcendo, being easily moved to take
part with us, and if need were, to defend and subscribe unto the Articles of
our Religion, so uniformly, so Catholikely agreed upon by the Prelates of our
Religion in the year 1562.

Lastly, for the Fathers, whom they would feign make Partiaries, and defenders
of their new and vpstart opinions; it is not to be marueiled, when they have
squeazed out the juice of their Books, Text, or Gloss, pared them to their
purposes, and purged them to their minds, or fancies rather: For if they also
chance to err, or mis*speake in their judgments (as the best have failed
sometimes, and in some things) they have a del^antur for them also; they shall
be no longer Fathers, but Sons, and therefore subject to their censures, and
in plain terms, purgeable, as Gretser the Jesuit has long since from
Ingolstad advertised us. But let them leave the Fathers of the purer Ages, in
puris naturalibus, without mixture or mutation of theirs, pure and sincere; and
we doubt not, but the truth of our Religion will as clearly appear, as the
Sun shine at midday, which I shall believe, till I shall see a round and
plenarie Refutation of the defense of ^ewels Apology, which was threatened to
be answered in the late Council of Trent, and our Countriman Master Harding,
has challenged it here and there of some mis-quotations, which the learned
Bishop does confess most ingenuously, and retort the like, and greater escapes
upon the Challenger: but wilful, or purposed corruptions, idque cum
authoritate (such as theirs are) he cannot, he shall not find in him, nor any
of his supposts.

This small Work of mine, Right Honorable, such as it is (and better it had
been, if due encouragement, health, and means had not failed me) I willingly
submit unto your judicious Fatherhood and grave wisdom, hoping some small good
may accrue thereby unto my dear Mother, the Church of England, a sound member
and obedient child whereof, I profess my self to be, far from Popery, and
farther distant (if farther may be) from all itching, vpstart, Schismatic
humor, going the Kings Highway, and fighting as others have done before me
contra Dextrarios and sinistrarios. I have better learned my Religion out of
Tertullian and others, that the first Religion is the best; and that the higher
we step, the nearer we approach unto the truth. And if this small attempt of
mine, graced by your Honorable Patronage, shall but work in my poor seduced
Countrymen and Compatriots, a true love of Antiquity, and detestation of all
Popish corruptions, in defacing and d^sgracing of all manner of good Books; to
God only be the glory, I have my desire. Rests nothing but to show my
willing readiness, and ready willingness to be employed by your Honorable
Lordship, in any service that comes within the compass and sphe^re of my
small knowledge, and poor ability, and so I rest,

Land. 26. April. 1625. Your Honorable Lordships in all duty to command, Tho.
James.

The Sixth Article.
Of the sufficiency of the Holy Scripture for Salvation.
HOLY Scripture contains all things necessary for salvation; so that
whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be
required of any man, that it should be believed as an Article of faith, or be
thought requisite or necessary to salvation.

In the name of the holy Scripture, we do understand those Canonical books
of the old and new Testament; of whose authority was never any doubt in the
Church.

Of the names and number of the Canonical Books.
GENESIS. EXODUS. LEVITICUS. NVMBERS. DEVTERONOMY. IOSVA. IVDGES. RVTH. 1.
book of SAMVEL. 2. book of SAMVEL. The 1. book of KINGS. The 2. book of
KINGS. 1. book of CHRONICLES 2. book of CHRONICLES The 1. book of ESDRAS.
The 2. book of ESDRAS. The book of ESTHER. The book of JOB. The PSALMS. The
PROVERBES. ECCLESIASTES, or the Preacher. CANTICLES, or Song of SOLOMON. 4.
Prophets the greater. 12. Prophets the lesser.


And the other books (as Hierom says) the Church does read for example of
life, and instruction of manners: but yet does it not apply themto stablish any
Doctrine, such as are these following:

The third book of ESDRAS. The fourth book of ESDRAS. The book of TOBIAS.
The book of IVDITH. The rest of the book of ESTHER. The book of WISDOM.
IESV, the son of SYRACH. BARVCH the Prophet. The song of the three Children.
The Story of SUSANNA. Of BELL and the DRAGON. The prayer of MANASSES. The
first book of MACCHABEES. The second book of MACCHABEES.
All the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do
receive and account them for Cauonicall.

This Sixth Article maintained and explained by the more moderate and learneder
sort of Papists, from whom I have taken these Propositions following.
1 THat they make the same Canon with us. 2 Exhort us to the diligent study of
this sacred Word. 3 Show the manifold use and profit that we may reap thereby.
4 Its perspicuity. 5 Its necessity to salvation. 6 The unprofitable and
unnecessary use of all other books. 7 Its commonnesse to be read of all. 8
Lastly, its contempt and reformation.
Whence by way of Corollarie, I will entreat briefly.
1 Of its translation into the vulgar. 2 Of the Latin Edition. 3 Of the
Septuagint. 4 Of the Hebrew Canon, showing that it ought to be the Canon and
rule of all other Translations.
The First Proposition.
That they make the same Canon with us.
FIrst, In Leo^ti^ Ad^^c^to Act. 2. Col. 96. ^. Bibl. ^^. P^trum p. 4. ex Cron.
Romans vbi legitur in textu. Hi sunt librita^^ prisci quam recentes, quae in
Ecclesia pro Canonicis habentur, Adscribe in ^^rg* Caute lege: Nam Tobiam,
Judith, Esther, Sapientia, Ecclesiasticum, and Macchabae^s perperam omisit.
Leon^ius, commonly called Aduocatus, is a sure Advocate for us in this point,
making the same Canon almost with us, and informing us, That in his time, it
was not only his, but the Churches opinion. In I^milio de partibus div. legis
l. ^. c. 3. Col. 3. C. M. Adiungunt plures -- Esdrae 2. Judith 1. Hest. 1.
Macchab. 2. D. Quare hi libri non inter Canonicas Scripturas currunt. MS
quonia^ apud Hebraeos, quoque super hac differentia recipiebatur, sicut
Hieronymus caeterique testatur.
Irmilius, in his learned Dialogue, between the Master and the Scholar,
proceeds further, and yields the same reason that we do: because the Hebrews
difference them after the same sort, according unto the testimony of S. Hierome
and others. But there is a caute lege, or Caveat put in against them both:
Maledicta glossa quae corrumpit Textum. Scripturae libris non Canonici. Caute
lege, nam perperam quosdam libros, a Canone ss. Scripturarum euellit.

Secondly, Boston of Bury in his Ca^logue of Manuscript books over all England
in his time. Sunt praeter^ alii quidam libri vt Sapientia Salomonis, libri Jesus
filii Syrach, quidicitur Ecclesiast. liber Judith, Thobias, and libri
Macchabaeorum qui leguntur quidem, sed non scribuntur in Canone. In Catal. MS.
in praelat.
Boston of Bury, the painful, but vniudicious Monk, treating of Apocrypha
books, out of Isidore and Iuo, makes the self same Canon with us, and that
for the same reason, and with the same limitation: Showing besides who were the
supposed Authors of those Apocrypha books.

Lastly, the History of Bell and the Dragon, is challenged by our quick-sighted
Historia Belis Apocrypha 1. Eras. ex Annot. Dion in p. 5. Aug. and scholijs in
p. 3. in D^per praesat^n Dan^olum.
Erasmus for an Apocrypha story. The like censure Quam historiam scio inter
Apocrypha numerari.
Spondanus passes upon the Book of Tobie, and Erasmus upon Judith, and the
Macchabees. f * Erasmus in ep* ad p. 86.
h * Erasmus in Iud Aug.


The second Proposition.
That they exhort us to the diligent study of the sacred Scriptures.
BY the complaint of diverse writers both old and new, the Scriptuees were too
too much neglected, shall I say, or utterly despised, generally of their
Monks, and Friars, Preachers, and others (as more opportunely shall be showed
in the handling of the eight proposition) and therefore the Spirit of God which
blows where it lists, and illuminateth whom it pleases, raised up some in
private, some in public, to be notable instruments of his glory. I will only
touch and away.

In the history of the Council of Ms. in Coll. Ball. Oxon.
Basi^e, there is a whole Sermon, to rouse their diligent attention to the
hearing and heeding of Gods word. Vatablus, more powerfully and feelingly,
before his Bibles, with the double translation and Scholiaes, has collected
summed up all the testimonies of the Bible, Ad sacrarum lit. studi^m exhortatur
ex sacris literis.
the rather to incite and provoke men to the study of the holy Bible, and not
unworthily; for there is. Benedictio obedien tibus verbo Dei, maledictio non
credentibus. In Cap. 11. Deuteronomy. Bibl. R^, Vatabli in Marg.
a blessing annexed to them that obey, and a curse upon them that disobey, or
discredit Gods word, Vita in verbo Dei, Vatablus and Steph. in Lucae, C. 4. in
Marg.
wherein is contained life, yea Vita aeterna in S lit. tota continetur. Baco^
Ms. inter opera minora, p. 41.
life eternal, and therefore it is called Sermo Dei cibus est. Ms. 43. p. 28.
food, the Sacra scrip. dicitur esta perfecta, Ms * p. 22
food of the soul, perfect food, Mane etiam colligebant Manna in signum quod
ab ineunte aetate insudand^ est, s. Scripturae quae per Manna exprimitur, Ms *
p. 22.
spiritual Manna, which must be gathered in the morning; to show, that we
must begin betime to gather, that is, to study it as it were in the morning of
our ages. Corpus Christi est ecclesia, cuius oculus est S. Scriptura vt dicit
Psalmista, lucerna pedibus meis verbum tuum, D. Ms. 29. p. 324.
The Church may fitly be termed Christ's body, and this the eye whereby it
sees, according to that of the Psalmist, The word of God is a lanthern unto my
feet. The Recte Scriptura Sion, dicitur quia speculum est Dei, quod hic
reperitur and videtur. Hist Basil, Ms. 2. p. 5.
word of God is called Sion, Sion signifies a looking glass or mirror,
wherein God is both seen and found. To conclude, it is both a Gladius
clypeusque Ms 43, 128.
Sword to Antichristus debellatur, per S. Christi Euangelium, Liniger, p. 1468.
conquer Antichrist, and a Shield to protect us from his fiery assaults, of a
In s. scriptura auctoritas principalis ad dirigendam fidem Catholica^. Ms 21.
p. 205.
principal virtue to direct man to the right Catholic faith. And to say no
more, all the Omnes Scripturae referendae ad Christum cui seruire est regnare,
Bacon Ms. p. 46.
Scripture is referred ^o Christ, whom to serve is to reign.

The Third Proposition.
The manifold use and profit thereof.
THis proposition, has a necessary coherence with the former, and a near
dependence on the fifth, of the necessity to salvation: and therefore being
vertually contained in them, I will pass by it, with a light touch,

The Fourth Proposition.
Of its Perspicuitie.
THe word of God being (as has been formerly showed) the bread of life, the
spiritual Manna, what avails it, if it be not broken; or if it be broken, if
it bes not digested? If the Arc be under its cou^rings, how shall the glory of
God be seen? Or if it be seen, if only the High Priest may enter? The
Scriptures are hard, and the difficulties are many; to assoyle this doubt, and
resolve the question, the Scripture is plain, Ms 2^. p. 149
ad dandam homini viaetori notitiam veram sufficientem partim per plana, and
for the rest, the observation is safe that is given upon Q^^ aperte dicta no
sunt, curiosi^s in dagari non debe t. Cy^il adversus Anthropom. c. 2. p. 709.
Cyrill, that we must not be too curious to hunt after that which God would
have unknown in the Scripture.

The Fifth Proposition.
The Scripture contains all things necessary to salvation.
^ Scripturae credulitas sufficiens ad salutem. Ferus in c. 17. Io. pa. 508.
Belief in the Scripture is sufficient to salvation, and that a man would
think were sufficient to cause us to meditate in Gods word both day and night:
but we Nihil valet meditari, nisi sequatur operari, Ms * p* 528.
must join Good-workes with our Faith. Meditation without operation is
fruitless, it ^ In I^d. Ch^^s. Scripturas continere omnia.
contains all things: all things Necessaria ad salutem ^radit. M^h^st. ^o^^.
Bas. p. 643.
necessary to salvation: herein is contained the wisdom of God, Sapientia
^ei comprehenditurin lege Dei vtriusq. Testamenti.
Sapientia Dei, etc. the wisdom of God is contained in his Law, that is, in
both the Testaments, we need seek no further, f Et nihil in Ecclesia Dei debet
plus confiderari, Bacon Ms. p. 47.
this alone is able to save us. It A de^ perfecta vt nihil ei adiiciendum. In
Synopside vita Abopardi ad 4.
is so sufficient, that nothing can he added to its sufficiency: this sure Ant
de Dominis fidei regula certa. l. 1. page 5.
rule of Faith will square all that is amiss, Ad eam tanquam ad Ancheram
confugium Id. ib.
this Anchor will hold all that is fleeting, Nec fallere, nec falli potest.
Conc. Bas. Ms. p. 39.
it neither does deceive others, or is deceived it self. For a conclusion of
this point, it is Infallibi is reg ^a and sufficientissima, Ibid. page 42. and
Ant. de Dom. lib. 6. cap. 1. ss. 39.
a most infallible rule, and super sufficient, or omnisufficient means of our
Salvation, let this suffice: but that I must needs take away one objection
before I pass further. It may perhaps be granted, that all things necessary
to Salvation are grounded in the Scripture: but in what sense, literal or
mystical, apert, or hidden? I answer, Omnia necessaria ad salutem fundantur
in sensu literali. Hist. Council. Bas Ms. p. 42.
out of the Council of Basil, All things needful to Salvation, are founded in
the literal sense of the Scripture.

The Sixth Proposition
The vnporfitdble and unnecessary use of all other Books.
THere was a time, when blind superstition did so far prevail amongst us,
that Claues caelestis Philosophiae Aristoteli acceptae, Io. Auent. Annal.
Bonorum l. 2. p. 95. in Theologorum scholis cele brior Aristoteles quam Paulus.
Erasmus. schol. in Hier. p. 17.
there was no God amongst us almost but Aristotle, no Argumentorum riui ex
Aristotelis fontibus. Io. Auent. annal. l. 2. p. 146. Mundana Philosophia
dominatur, Germ ser. v. ^. p. 831.
Diuixitie, but drawn out of the dregs of Philosophy; and as if these were
not sufficient to blind our spiritual eyes, or puzzle our understandings, a
labryinth of humane traditions were found out, to amaze and perplex us: but
thanks be to God, the night is passed, and the day is come; darkness is
passed, and the glorious Sun shine of the Gospel has long since expelled
these mists or fogges: We have a certain rule to guide us; an Ariadnean clue
to direct us, Non Dialecticoru^ tendicula nec Arist. spineta quaerend a sunt,
ipsa Scripturarum verba poniendi. Io. Langus in Chron. Cytiz. p. 833. Germ.
ser* page 1.
ipsa Scripturae verba ponenda: Catches and sophismes of Logicians, abstruse
and hard questions of Aristotle will not serve the turn: Gods word alone is
certain, other profes uncertain and false, if they dissent from it. Sine
Scriptura nihil asserendum, in Ind* Chrysostom.
Without Scripture nothing is to be affirmed, and Nihil vltra quam sacris
literis proditum est definiendum, Er^sm. annal. in Hisarium.
beyond it nothing is to be concluded: t to know nothing but the Gospel, is to
know all things. Solum Dei verbum honoretur omnino: coetera autem velut
aduentitia and superflua, si non etiam noxia reiiciantur: Christus est omnia,
verbum Dei omnia, caetera tanquam nihilum and inane. Iac. Faber in Marcum, p^g.
285. ^ Lex Dei adeo perfecta vt nil ei adiiciendum, Insynopside vita Agob^rai
ad 4.
The word of God, only and alonely is to be honored with all manner of
reverence; all other things are but adiectitious and superfluous, if not
hurtful and noxious: in comparison of Gods word, all other things are as
nothing, or of no weight. Ire ad* dexteram est addere verbo Dei, ire ad
finistram detrahere, Val* in Ios* c. Ms 10.
The Law of God is so perfect, that it admits of no addition: much less q
Solum Dei verbum certum: coetera falsa si dissentiant. Ferus in ep. ad Romans c.
3. page 303.
c Extra Euangelium nihil scire est. omnia scire, Faber in p^^fat in 4. Euang.
may we take ought therefrom: This Ad^^re p^^^(...) de^ gravius peccatum quam

were to turn to the right hand or to the left, and not to run the way of
righteousness. (...) fundament des, vel pro fundamentalibus, non fundamentales
ponantur (...)* Luic (...) Regentes Oxon, ^^s.
Addition to Gods word is as heinous a sin, as the sin of witchcraft. The
stones that David must carry in his sling, must be taken out of this
Sanctuary: my exhortation to all shall be, briefly that of the famous Grosthead
to his Regents of Oxford: Take heed that in stead of these Myst^^^ sensunt
(...) and (...) predicatorum cum ^nusquisque de^^^gat pr^^^ vult No^^ marg.
apud Tho^^at. in ^os. 6. q. 73. p. 98. ex edit.
foundation stones, you bring not vnfundamentall or moultering ones; such as
are the a dreams and fictions of Preachers, which by an Allegorical, or
mystical sense, make good what best comes into their brain-sicke heads,
causing the Sc^ta decretas Christi non seruare sed seruire, Io* Auent* annal.
l. 5. p. 452.
Scriptures which should save them, to serve them. I conclude with the saying
and belief of Erasmus: Quae lego in sacris libris and in Symbolo Apostolorum
summa fiducia credo, nec vltra credo, caetera permitto Theologis disputan de
Erasm. page 117.
Whatsoever I read, either directly in the holy Scriptures, or virtually to be
deduced out of them: as the Symbol of the Apostles, I believe with the
greatest assurance that may be* further I dare not go; this faith contenteth
me: all other Quidditates and esseitatas, p. 1. Grrman. ser. page 833.

Fooleries, Gryphes, Curiosas ne dicam, impiae quaestione^ Er^s^nnet in
Hilarium.
Curious, orrather impious questions, I leave to be disputed, in their proper
place, the Schools.

The seventh Proposition.
Its common to be read of all.
THe holy Scripture, as it affords stronger meat for them that are or should
be Quaedam (elca) est Praelutor est perfectorum scilicet, s. Scriptura, M^ *
page 22.
perfect, that is, Clearkes and Praelates: so it has milk for Babes, Lectio
debet omnibus esse communis, In Ind Chrysostom.
must be read of all: Communis est ista pastura, qui nouit Aposto^us cum dixit:
Frater debitorsum omnibus Graecis, Latinis, and Barbaris, M^ * page 300.
all have pasturing upon these commons. Progressus S* Scripturae, non est
coarctatuu ad partem vniuersitatis, Ms 21. p. 149.
The progress, or profit thereof, is not restrained to one part and not to an
other: as if some may read it, and some may not. Why then do they so much
Quare indignantur si prophanus legate Scripturas, Io. Auent. ^^wnum, l 4. g. 382
and p. ^^6
scorn, that lay or profane men (as they term them) should read the
Scriptures: N^ quis loquatur de Christo aut de S literis nisi Theol Eras. p ^
as if no man were to take of Christ or Scripture but Divines. What Lectio
populi non prohibenda quia aliqui abutuntur, Auen in Io.
though some abuse it? All will not; it is no such Nefas esse scripturam in
populare linguam vertere. Erasv. 9 p 802.
heinous matter, as you would make it, to translate the Scripture into the
vulgar: and yet, some for translating the Bible, more for Nunc exoriuntur hom^^
^. Erasv. 9. p. 5^8.
reading of it, have been consumed with fire and flames; when poor souls they

won to the truth of their religion (supposing it to be so) by fair means,
rather than by compulsion. Faith is free to be persuaded, not commanded: with
Erasmus I will leave men that cannot be persuaded, to Gods mercy, the furthest
that we can do, (unless they be troublers of States, and seditious
Schismatickes) is to excommunicate them. But as a wise Lawyer says, non
mouendum quod sine sanguine moueri nequit: as we must save blood and not spill
it; so we must save souls, and not damn them, if it may be otherwise. t

The eight Proposition.
The contempt of Scripture, and a desire of Reformation.
THe complaint was too true, that Verbum Dei and Scriptura multo perus a
Christianis discrep um est, quam a Iudaeis vel Gentibus, Ferus in Io c. 5. 9.
^0.
Ferus once made; the word of God, was in worse case amongst Christians then
amongst Jews or Gentiles, it was so tossed and tumbled, rent and torn, no
otherwise says ^urisperit^ detorquent Scripturas quo volunt, v^ Sutores
sordidas pellet, Virg. de invent. l 4. c. 9* p. 271.
Polydor Virgill, then Cobblers use their filthy leather. He speaks this of
the Canonists and Lawyers, the false Prophets, whereby God does Deus opera

and refuse to be reformed by the same, Neglecta (...) ^ propter bullat and
instituta hominum. M^. 29 p. 383.
neglecting it for I know not what B^lles and traditions of men. Of these
writes an ancient writer, whose name were well worth the knowing, and his
observations note-worthy; and therefore I will take the pains to transcribe it
wholly, as much as makes for our purpose. Isa speculatores eius caeci omnes,
viden^ ^s var^a, hoc est caeci in spiritualibus; sed perspic^ces in
temporalibus. Et in euangelio dicitur, lucerna corporis tui est oculus tuuis.
Corpus Christi est Ecclesia, cuius oculus est sacra scriptura, vt dicit
Psalmista. Lucerna pedibus meis verbum tuum, etc. Sed hodie est amphora oculis
eorum qui per saeculare scientiam and lucratione^ Ecclesiam quae est, corpus
Christi diriguut, and secundum instituta hominum regu^ and gubernat. Talentum
plumbi ponderosum scilicet peccatu^ significat, and nogotium saeculare quod
exigit auaritia. Et quid hodie talentum plumbi nisi bullata Priuilegia,
dispensationes, rescripta cau^^d^^a et huiusm Duae mulieres quae leuant

M^ 29 p 324.
I say, their watchmen are all blind, and yet as blind as they are they can see
vain and transitory things, thus we may interpret these words: they are blind
in spiritual affairs, but quick-sighted enough in temporal matters. It is
said in the Gospel, the light of thy body is thy eye. Christ's body is his
Church, his eye is the holy Scripture, according unto the saying of the
Psalmist: Thy word is a lantern unto my feet, etc. But in these present
times, alack for woe; there is an Amphora, a beam in their eyes, which by
saecular and gainefull Sciences, take upon them the rule and governance of the
Church (which is his body) by traditions and ordinances of men. The weighty
and ponderous talent of Lead, signifies sin and saecular affairs, procured
by covetousness. And at this present time, what is this talent of Lead, but
their Privileges, Dispensations, and such like, sealed with Lead? The two
women which lift this two eared pot between them, signify pleasure and
vainglory, whereby many gather evil riches into their houses. Their wings
are like Kites: The Kite is a ravenous bird, houering up and down, to lie in
wait for tame foul, or stinking carrion. So these covetous men, lie houering
between heaven and earth, casting about how they may get into their hands,
whether it be by right or wrong, this transitory pelf of the world: but their
being is in the land of Sennaar, that is to say, in hell, whereis nothing but
loathsome smelles, and gnashing of teeth. Out of these words we infer this,
that many in those days sought after wealth, few after the Scripture, the
light of their souls: few looked into this Sacra Scriptura speculum est Dei,
quo videtur sacra hist. Conc B^snu. 2 p. 5.
mirror, to see the deformity and foulness of their souls, fewer that

tread in those steps which lead unto salvation.

The first Corollary.
Of the Translation of the Scripture into the vulgar tongue.
OF this we have heard Erasmus judgment, in the seventh Proposition; if that
suffice not, ^lagitat necessitas huius aeui, vt sint conuersa Biblia in linguas
vnicuique nationi vernaculas. Geo. Wicelius meth, Conc. Cap. 2.
Geo. Wicelius a moderate Papist, that wrote not many years after Luther, will
be able to inform us, that as the times are now, it cannot be otherwise, but
the Bible must be translated faithfully out of the originals: He reckons up the
great use, and soucreigne profit likely to flow therefrom: but chiefly (says
Porro praeter alias commoditates, quas secum affert interpretatio primariae
linguae, magnum incitamentum ecclesiast is erit, vt vel literati vulgi metu,

he) it will make our Preachers more wary and careful in their citations of
Scripture, lest the lay hearer may parhaps take them tardie now and then. And
he further says, in the same place, that Nec periculum est vt hinc haereses

Methodius, the Sclauons inioyed their service in the vulgar tongue, full sore

what need have we of more testimonies? This point is ratified, by a voice from
heaven (if Audita vox de coelo, omnis spiritus laudet Dominum, et omnis lingua
con^^^catur ei. A^^. Siluius referent Zuinger. 1. 4168.
Aeneas Siluius report before he was Pope do not fail me:) There was a voice,
whilst this business of having the service in the vulgar tongue was treated
of, heard from heaven saying, Let every spirit praise the Lord, and every
tongue confess him.

The second Corollary.
Of the vulgar Latin Edition.
SOme make the vulgar Latin of equal authority with the original Hebrew and
Greek, preferring Agar the handmaid, before Sara the Mistress, to verify
that of Gen* 16. 8.
the Scripture: I have seen many servants ride, and their ^eeles ^^, 1.
masters go on foot. It is also questioned amongst some of the less learned,
whether it be Hieromes or no; but that opinion, and that of theirs, who shame

the Dowists, that have translated it into English, and obtruded to our simple
Countrymen, as the very word of God*

The third Corollary.
Of the Septuagint.
OMitting the curiosity and speculatiue knowledge of those hidden questions,
whether the ^2. Translators, were shut up in 72. diverse Celles: or being all
together, did so unanimously agree upon one Translation: most certain it is,
that as it is, be it more or less, corrupted ^ Apostoli atque Euangelistae

l. 2. 118.
it was, and accordingly and frequently cited and urged by the Apostles, who
being to plant the primitive faith in men's hearts, thought it not best to put
such seruples of reading, and diverse lections into their heads, and it was no
fit time then to move or dispute this question, whether the Hebrew originals,
were to be preferred before the Septuagint translation, the fountain before
riuelets: They were otherwise occupied, about preaching the word, converting of
Nations, there was a consta^ for the truth of that they taught: further then
that which tended to edification, they sought not, but to provide honest things
for them before God and before men.

The fourth Corollary.
Of the Hebrew Canon, showing that it ought to be the Canon and rule of all
other Translations.
IF the rule swerve or decline, it cannot direct; if the fountain be myrie
and tainted, the water that issues from it cannot be stanch; that which
directs others, must be infallible in, and of it self: so fares it with
the Hebrew Bibles, (say our obiectors what they will) ^ Ex^^platia He^ra^ca non

faith, but only such which does R. s. 172*
separate them far from the Protestant cape, and lead them unto looseness:
we will make bold to scan this Article more narrowly, and resolving the whole
into it is parts, we will diligently inquire;

1. About the name, nature, parts, and effects of Justification. 2.
Affirmatively, that it is only for the merits of Christ by faith. 3.
Negatiuely, not for our own works, or deseruings. 4. We will endeavor to
make good this proposition, which is as it were, an Eleophuga, or scar-crow to
the Papists, that we are justified by faith only, is a most wholesome
doctrine, and very full of comfort, and all this according to the doctrine of
the most renowned and best learned Papists.
The first Proposition.
About the Name, Nature, Parts, and Effects of Justification.
Justification, is when the faithful and chosen servants of God, which were
preordained unto salvation in Gods secret wisdom, being sinners by nature in
Adam, guilty of eternal damnation, are accounted righteous, and pronounced
just before God, by his imputed and free righteousness; and not only for the
merits of Christ, acquitted from the guilt and punishment of hell fire: but made
partakers of eternal life, to their assured comfort in this, and certain
fruition in that better life which is to come.

Let us take a better view of all the parts of this definition. Justification
appertains only to the faithful Believers; and none but they are ^ In filio
pre ordina^^ sunt ad viram nempe qui in ipsum credant. Fe^^^ ^^ ^^^ ^ ^ 144.
preordained to life in Christ: these are a certain number, not Non omne^
cred^^^^ sedso^^ electi (...) ^ 17. Ioh. ^ ^^^.
all chosen out of the mass, and elected to salvation: and yet for all this,
they are called sinners, and are (...) omines infi^^^^, ^scii and pec^a^ore^*

all sinners by nature. ^ Homo qu^^^nus (...) ^^mper pecc^^ (...) ^ ^ in (...)

all that we do, or is done upon us, is accursed: accursed are the very
thoughts of our hearts, understandings, the members of our bodies hands
mouths, and feet, and the very contingent things of this world, whether of joy
or sorrow, are all accursed: so ^ Q^^qu^^ agit ^^stus, (...) (...) p 7

our Good-workes there is some medley of evil, not imputed to us thorough Gods
free mercy: and Q^ntacunque ^^^^ (...), (...) ^^ m^^o^^* vel saltem plu(...)

albeit we do never so much good, still we sin, and summing up our good deeds
and bad, the bad will be the greater number, and the more ponderous. To
conclude this point, ^ Om^^^ ^^stra e^^e m^ra^ ^enebra and peceata atque hic
primus gradus est ad iu^^* ficationem, ^^^ in ^^. cap. 3. page 92.
all that we ca^ challenge to our selves is nothing but sin, and a fre^
acknowledgement, that of our selves we deserve to be thrown^ into utter
darkness, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth. In this deplored estate of
ours, what remedy? What help is there for a distressed conscience? The self
same that was last mentioned, let us ascend by an humble and lowly confession
of our sins, which is the first step to salvation: then by degrees
acknowledging our sins, let us call upon God for ^ Ad fontem miser^^^^d (...)

though we be never so just before men: yet are sinful in comparison of God.

is damnable, if it be examined in rigor; nor from our own strength and
virtue, which is but weakness, our best De fide habitu credendi, and fide
confidentia dicta: vide Stellam in Lucam. p. 64. Certa in Deum siducia and
forti fide, Snoygoud in Ps 124. p. 303.
works that are tainted, wanting four graynes to make them current in Gods
scale, and therefore in the last place, it is a most wholesome doctrine, and
full of comfort, that we are justified by Faith. It is a wholesome doctrine,
because it agrees with the word of God, and teaching of their own men: full
of comfort because it does not only hope that we may be saved: but breeds y an
assurance and confidence in our minds, that we embrace Christ, and leave the
world trust to Faith and disclaim merit: which doctrine is not so to be
understood, as if Faith were barren without Good-workes, or that Good-workes
were not to be followed of us, if ever we mean to run the way of salvation,
which now come in the next Article to be examined. v Quae iudicamus bona, recta
intention and feru nti facta, non protinus bona sunt, si a nobis sunt, sed si
a Deo, Faber in Math, p. 201.


Of the Twelfth Article.
Of Goodworkes.
ALbeit that Goodworkes, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after
justification, cannot put away our si^nes and endure the severity of Gods
judgment: yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and do
spring out of a lively Faith, in so much that by them a lively Faith may be
evidently known, as a Tree discerned by the fruit.

This Twelfth Article explained and maintained by the Papists.
THere is no Article thoroughout all our Doctrine so much seandalized as this
of Goodworkes. Our Adversary the Devil has raised up our Adversaries the
Papists, to reproach the whole host of Israel, and the God of Hosts, as if we
lead men to looseness, taught men to eschew Goodworkes, as sins, and never
so much as studied the point of Sanctification: but look into their Indices
expurgatorij, hearken unto their impartial and moderate Papists, and the
scandal will cease, and this Article be cleared from imputation of calumny.
For taking away all opinion of merit, all confidence in Goodworkes, making them
accessarie after, and not necessary before Justification, embracing them as
the fruit, and not as the root of a true and lively Faith, and we will be as
forward as they to advance the doctrine of Goodworkes, as being inuolued within
the doctrine of Faith, and incorporated in the Articles of our Religion
proouing these Propositions.

1. That Goodworkes are the fruit of Faith, and follow after Justification. 2.
That they cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of Gods
judgment. 3. That springing out of a lively Faith, they are pleasing and
acceptable to God in Christ, and are to be known no otherwise, then the Tree
is discerned by the fruit.
The First Proposition.
That Goodworkes are the fruits of Faith, and follow after Justification.
FErus a most learned and pious Writer of their own, says as much in other
words. Fides radix, et opera bona fructus. ^or^n 3. ^. Io. p. 61.
Fides radix, Faith whereby a man Qua homo iustificatur. Ib.
is justified, is the root, Good-workes the fruit of our Justification. Now I
suppose it will be easily granted, that the root goes before the fruit, both
in order of time and of nature. Wherefore though it be most true, that

Good works have nothing to do, or do interuene in the very act of
Justification, which is wrought by free mercy and faith Hoc donum in hac vita

Christum non habere. Vatablus in Is^^. 58. in Marg.
Vatablus ( as Saint James does) a posteriori, that he that has not
Good-workes, has no true faith in Christ, no Christ, no benefit of his
passion, and shall have no part in his resurrection; he has denied the Faith,
and is already become a reprobate, and Infidel: but grant that he has Faith,
it is but Instigandi praedicatores vt libere hypocrism bonorum operum

hypocritical, and without true faith his works are abominable and Fides
sine operibus non magis est dicenda fides, qua^m cadauer hominis meretur

cadauerous and stink^ng in the nostrils of God. This is our, this is the
Papists doctrine concerning Goodworkes built upon the rock Faith, or Christ,
against which the slanderous mouths of Obiectors, nor the gates of hell shall
ever be able to prevail.

The Second Proposition.
That they cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of Gods
judgment.
IF we look for our Per Christum (fideles) sperant salutem et non per alium

than we were indebted for: so that Christ is now become our only Savior,

both in us, and for us: then it can neither truly nor safely be said, that
good works can put away our sins, and endure the severity of Gods judgment.
In the best of men (Christ Jesus only excepted) there is somewhat amiss, and
in the best of our works, aiming at the best end, but proceeding not from a
true cause, nor ascribed wholly to Gods mercy, there is much evil, no merit,

cannot turn away Gods wrath from us.

The Third Proposition.
That Good Works springing out of a lively Faith, are pleasing and acceptable
to God in Christ, and are to be known no otherwise then the Tree is discerned
by the Fruit.
GOod works Opera bona ex fide, alias mortua, Ferus in ^. 1. ad Joan. p. 669.
owe their being to faith, without which it is impossible for any man to be
pleasing, or any work to be acceptable to God in Christ. This faith, which is
the basis of our religious works, and the Totum Christianorum bonum, Stella in
Lucam, p. 64.

faith, or no lively faith, ergo he has no works, or Vbi defectus fider, omnia
opera invtilia, Fer in ep. Romans c. 3. p* 304. Math. 25, 34. Verse 35.
no profit by his Works. And last of all, in the last day of judgment when
the sheep shall be discerned from the goats, the faithful from the reprobate,
the elect (as we know, and all confess) shall be judged, although not propter
opera, yet secundum opera; not for, but according to their works: then Christ
shall say unto them, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the beginning of the world. For I was an hungered, and ye
gave me meat, I was thirsty and ye gave me drink, I was a stranger, and ye
took me in, etc. And they shall answer again in effect: These good works were
thy gift, and these thy gifts thou do crown in us: Not unto us, not unto
us, unto thy name be the glory.

The 32. Article.
BIshops, Priests, and Deacons, are not commanded by Gods Law, either to vow
the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage. Therefore it is
lawful also for them, as for all other Christian men, to marry at their own
discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better for godliness.

This Article explained and maintained by Papists.
WE will by Gods grace handle this question, partly Historically, showing that
Priests have been married; and partly Theologically, proving that they have a
liberty to marry, as well as all other Christian men.

Historically thus.
FIrst, in the old Testament, all the Chrysostom. in Iudi^^. Prophetas omnes
vxores habuisse.
Prophets were married, sans quaestion, and as little doubt is to be made of

Ignatius with us, belike to justify Bellarmines bold assertion saying, that
it is not found in the Manuscript copies: but who told him so? I have not seen
many, but those that I have viewed, either have, or had Paul named written at
large. Of Lucas, e Platina says expressly, vxorem habuit in Bythinia, Lucas
had a wife with him in Bythinia: this place has passed the censure of our
Inquisitors, and the later Edition (if I be not mistaken) read vxorem non
habens in Bythinia, he had no wife with him in Bythinia. There was some such
motion in the Primitive times, that Priests should be removed from their wives:
but this was Contra ss. Patru^ sententiam, Sigebert B^. PP. v. 7. Col. 1495.

Pynitus, one that lived not long after, was admonished that he should not lay
so heavy a burden upon his weak brethren: a burden indeed, that neither they,
nor their successors, were ever able for to bear. ^ H^dio in Chron Germ. apud

they did compel their Parish Priests, to keep a Concubine, and unless he

the East Church, neither then, nor now to this present day, received this
doctrine into their Church: but left them free to marry at their own
discretions, as comes now in the next place to be showed.

Theologically, thus.
ALl proofs in divinity, are either divine, taken out of the word of God: or
humane, as the Lawyers call them Semi-probationes, or half proofs, drawn
from the testimonies of men, or traditions of the Church, which are not
binding, but of a fallible nature.

Again, divine proofs are either plain, in the literal sense of the
Scripture; or hidden and latent in the Allegorical interpretation of the
words, whereout no sound argument Theologia allegorica non est argumentatiua.
can be deducted, as most Divines know. To accommodate and apply that which
has been said to our present Article. What more plain, and in express
words can there be alleged in defense of Priests marriage, then that of the
Apostle, t Propter fornicationem vitandam vxorem habeat vnusquisque: To avoid
fornication, let every See Vatablus in 1. C^r.
man have his wife? But (if my observation fail me not) as you have since
divorced men from their wives; so your tormentors of books have divorced this
sentence of S. Paul's either out of the body, or the margent of your Bibles: Let
me say unto you, as Gamaliel did to the Jews: If this prohibition of yours be
of God, it will doubtless prevail, but if it be not from him, the contrary
doctrine will take place, will you nill you. I know it is objected by some,
that in one of the Quomodo potuerunt Patres qui fuerunt in Nic^na Synodo dare
nobis legem, qui neque interfuimus, neque consensimus? Item quomodo potuit
eorum institutio irritare matrimonium institutum a Deo et ab Apostolis inter

institutionibu^. S. Romans Ecclesia. [ stare.] Ms. o. p. 160, 161.
Nicene Synods, there was a Canon published, enioyning Clergy men perpetual
chastity: but what says the Auctour, an ancient Mannuscript, where this
objection is read, how can this Canon of the Church be of force against us,
that were neither present in person, nor consenting by our voices to the making
thereof? Thus far my old Manuscript, and further too: for in those days
when he wrote, there was no question made, but those of the Dicit Canon quod
si qui Cle^^ci in miuoribus ordinibus constituti continere non possunt et
contrahere inatrimonium voluerint, debet ei assignari sustentatio sua de
beneficis suis, extra Ecclesiam, it a scilicet quod de caetero non ministrent
in Ecclesia in ordine suo, sed ^onsuram habeant et liberate gaudeant
Clericorum. Ms. o. p 160.
inferieur sort of the Clergy, should (if they could not contain but needs
would marry) be sustained, and maintained out of the profits of their benefice,
and enjoy the benefit of their privileges. Si Acolythus veniat ad discretum
Sacerdotem in priuata confessione, et dicat se non posse continere: non multum
peccat Sacerdos dando ei consilium, quod occulte contrahat cum aliqua, et
fallat oculos Episcopi sui: quia minus malum credimus esse retinere beneficium
cum occulto con^^gio sine scandalo, quam habere concubinam contra prohibitionem
diuinam. Si autem postea cogatur ad sacros ordines a suo Praelato,
credimusminus peccatum esse vti vxore, quam fornicari cum aliqua, si ex toto
coutinere noluerit. Ms. o. p. 160.
At that time also if an Acolythus came to a discreet Priest, and told him by
way of Confession, that he had not (to say the truth) the gift of continency,
it was but a venial sin in the Confessor, to advise his Confessee, to
contract himself with some one or other, in private sort, and so deceive his
Diocesan: for of two evils, the less is to be chosen, and it is a less fault
for a Priest to marry privately, and to keep his wife without scandal together
with his benefice, then to keep a Concubine against the express commandment
of God. And put the case, that this man after this be compelled by his
Diocesan, to ascend to holy orders, we believe and assure ourselves, that he
is in less fault that keeps the company of his own wife, than he that haunts
an Harlots company: this is spoken of them that cannot contain. Answerable to
this ancient Tenet, was that of Erasmus, and others. ^ Qui concubinas ante
con^^gium habere praesumit, peius facit, quam qui adulterium committit. Er^n
Iod. Aug.
Whosoever he be that preferres the having of a Concubine, before the
marriage of a wife, (to my seeming) is in as bad case or rather worse, than he
that does commit adultery. The more ashamed might our Papists be, that
tolerate Stews, and maintain harlots in, and by their Church policy; they
shame not to write it, I am ashamed to repeat it, ne deterior libido vsum
assumat: and, as if they would put chaste marriage clean out of countenance. I
have read of one Tho. dela Bear, a Welsh Bishop, who more like a Bear then a
Bishop, would not suffer the Clergy of his Diocese to part with their
concubines, (though they earnestly desired it) because, forsooth, he should
lose an annual rent of forty Marks, which was well and truly paid him: and
no marvel, for Espencaeus, a later Writer, tells us, that in his time, their
Archdeacons and Officials in their visitations respectively levied the same of
concubinary Priests, * Ad vitandam deteriorem libidinem sustinentur meretrices,

men, to marry at their own discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve
better for godliness.

Of the authority of General Councels.
General Councels may not be gathered together without the commandment and
will of Princes: and when they be gathered together (for as much as they be an
assembly of men, whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and Word of God)
they may err, and sometimes have erred, even in things pertaining unto God:
wherefore things ordained by them as necessary unto salvation, have neither
strength nor authority, unless it be declared, that they be taken out of
holy Scripture.

There remain behind two scruples in this Article, whether, first, General
Councels may err? Secondly, Whether Scripture must be the Rule to guide them?
Prudent Erasmus takes them away both, by saying, that Eras. v. 3. p. 76.
Councels may be depraved, and then that no moral persuasion of Councels, but
authority of Scripture must be insisted upon.

Of the 37. Article.
Of the Civil Magistrate.
THe Kings Majesty has the chief power in this Realm of England, and other
his Dominions, unto whom the chief government of all the Estates of this
Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil, in all causes does
appertain; and is not, nor ought to be subject to any foreign jurisdiction.
Where we attribute to the Kings Majesty the chief Government, by which title,
we understand the minds of some slanderous folks to be offended: we give not
to our Prince the ministering either of Gods Word, or of the Sacraments; the
which thing the Injunctions also set forth by Elizabeth our (late) Queen, do
most plainly testify. But that only prerogative, which we see to have been
given always to all godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God himself; that is,
that they should rule all Estates and degrees committed to their charge by God,
whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and restrain with the Civil
sword, the stubborn and evil doers.

This thirty seventh Article explained and maintained by the Papists in these
subsequent Propositions.
1. THe Kings Majesty has the chief power in this Realm of England, and
other his Dominions. 2. Over all persons, in all Causes, whether they be
Ecclesiastical or Civil. 3. The King is not subject to any foreign
jurisdiction. 4. He may restrain with the Civil sword; the stubburne and
evil doers.
The first Proposition.
The Kings Majesty has the chief power in this Realm of England, and other
his Dominions.
I Must crave pardon of every honest Reader, if I enlarge my papers in this
point, and the propositions following, beyond my first proposal; for that I
take it to be a piece of my allegiance, for me and all of my coat, not only
to oppose those paper walls, but to interpose our dearest lives between the
King and danger (if need require). Danger there is, and ever will be to Kingly
power, as long as their bloody Inquisition-house shall stand at Rome: for if
their transcendent and unjustifiable power be not limited, they will in time to
come (if they may have their wills, quod absit) first, thrust Kings out of
their books, and then out of their Kingdoms. But the best is, nocumenta,
documenta: his most excellent Majesty being forewarned, is forearmed, not only
to preueut the danger by their books, but by their mischievous persons, with a
just deleantur both out of his Kingdom and State. We may see their evil
intents in their thrice accursed Indices Expurgatorij. If a flower of Regal
authority do begin to bud forth, it is presently nipped off with their
vlcerous hands. For example; Place we the King according to our bounden duties,
by the Laws of God and men, in a Throne Non enim habet in terris quicquam se
excelsius. Bibl. PP. Col. p. 208. l. 2. Sermon. Ant. Abbati^.
higher than all other men, because he has no Peer or Compeere upon earth,
that can equalize, much less ouertop Agapet. Dia^. Col. Bb. Pp. v. 2. Col. 795.
Honor quolibet sublimiorem quum habeat dignitatem: this doctrine was taught
us long ago by Agapetus the Deacon, and other ancient Writers, whose steps
the Papists pretend to follow, and who but they, that seem to reverence their
grave sentences and gray hairs? Nevertheless, you see a cross in the
Margent, and you shall find a Deleatur in their books, or a Cave, as if you had
trod upon a Serpent. I have an ancient Manuscript in my keeping, that made an
hard shift to come unto me, (for he almost lost his coat by the way): but
ragged and torn as he is, he has these words, which do serve to be written
in letters of gold, because they speak the Supremacy in express terms, and
accord with this our Article: Rex in Regno suo nullum supra se habebit. -- vnde
a Rege ferente sententiam appellari in Regno suo non potest. nu. 29. p. 7.
The King has no living person above him in his Kingdom, who then dares
appeal from him? Unless it be some traitorous Becket, or other, that passing

overwhelmed both King and State, if the providence of God had not the better
preserved them, as may appear in our English Stories. But leaving Becket to be

By Mast er Rich. James, B. of Divinity of C. C. C. in Oxford.
Traitor, notwithstanding all their shifts that would apologize for him, I
proceed, and further show, that there is just occasion given us to fear, that
if this old Manuscript had lighted into the Papists hands, either this leaf
should have bin purged or torn, or the whole book made away, that it should
never have come in evidence against them. For Manuscripts as well as other
books, whether Greek or Latin, old or new, are the subject, or obiectum
adaequatum of their damnable, unheard of, and Diabolical censures. But to
resume my first Proposition again, that the Kings Majesty has next under God
the chief power in this Realm, is a doctrine so harsh and distasteful in
their mouths, that there is a Deleatur wheresoever it is found, non habet in
terris se quicquam excelsius, He has no man greater upon earth, is shamefully
put forth, and clean turned out of an ancient Writer in their Bibliotheque of
ancient Fathers. This very sentence in other words, in Cuius potestas
Maiestasque secundum Deum maxima.
Lud. Viues Epistle unto King Henry the eight, has endured the like
purgation, and is washed away clean out of the book. Now to grow to a
conclusion: If the Papists do so ill entreat Kings in their books, I leave
you to imagine what they would do to their persons, if they could as easily
come by them? But, nouerint vniuersi, I would have all men know, that the more
they corrupt, the less they gain in the judgment of any indifferent Papist
not too much Romanized: and of favor, let me ask them this question, and let
them answer me (if they can) upon their consciences: do these sentences that
they have caused to be blotted and blurred, make against them, or not? If they
do not, they make themselves ridiculous, by taking so much labor in vain, (

Thalmud of the Jews, nor the great Theater of Zuinger amongst the
Protestants, nor Tostatus, or Salmeron among your Papists, nor any book in any
Science, have wearied your patiences, or terrified your Inquisitors from prying
into their books, or corrupting their writings:) if they do make against you
and your doctrine, which cannot subsist without these notorious shiftings and
shufflings, wrenchings and wrincklings, the more dishonest men you, that while
the controversies are depending, and the questions are in disputing, do
shamefully either suborne Authors to bear false witnesses to testify
untruths, or suppress and subvert the testimonies that make against you. To
close up this first Proposition and your mouths (if it be possible) this first
Proposition stands inviolable: The Kings Majesty has the chief power in
this Realm of England, and other his Dominions.

The second Proposition.
Over all persons in all causes, whether they be Ecclesiastical, or Civil.

Claudius Espencaeus, a man of singular note, trencheth upon this troublesome
question, and decideth it thus; Having spoken of Saint Paul's omnis anima; Let
every soul be subject to the higher powers, expounded by Chrysostom, whether
he be Apostle or Evangelist, Prophet, Priest or Monk, (which exposition is
seconded by Theodoret, Theophylact, Oecumenius, and what Greek Writer dares
oppose against it*) he infers these words: [ Yea, Gregory the first,
Gregory the Great, does ingenuously acknowledge the Emperors sovereignty,
as well over the Priests (that fight Gods battles) as over the soldiers that
warred under his conduct, Regist. lib. 2. Ep. 64. And after Gregory and
Chrysostom, Bernard, a late Writer, in his to Henry Archbishop of Senes, Ep.
41. argues after this manner out of the words, Every soul: If every soul,
then yours: he that would have you conceive otherwise of these words, does but
deceive you, follow not their counsels. Espenc. ep. ad Titum, cap. 3 page 513.

If Princes have nothing to do with Religion, and sacred businesses, what makes
so many Imperial laws and constitutions for Religion in the Code, Nouels, and
Authentikes? And to what purpose do we read of so many Royal Edicts and
Parliaments in the Annals of all Christian Princes for the settling and
establishing of Religion? [As I hear, when those horrible fires were lighted
throughout all the kingdom of France, for the burning of men and women alive:
Oh, that was a matter of the Church, appertaining to Religion. But when there
was speech of reforming the Clergy, conforming Monks to their primitive
orders, and sending Nonresidents home to their Cures to care for their flocks,
that matter was not to be spoken of by the temporal Magistrate, it was to be
treated of in a Council, or before the Popes Holiness: for so I have heard,
and do well remember, that our Bishops were wont to distinguish after this
manner; as if Princes were not to be zealous and careful in point of Religion:
but to commit the care thereof not only to men very indiscreet, but altogether
ignorant, and so to become mere executioners of their cruel designs; as if
they were not sons of our Mother the Church, and chief propugnators,
propagators and defenders of the same. We have heard what Espencaeus judgment
is of Princes, intermedling in Ecclesiastical affairs: hear we now a man
nothing inferior to him for learning, Si Sacerdotes, vel sacris legibus, vel

Andreas Masius, writing upon Joshua; what says he? If it should chance, that
the Priests forgetting their duties, do against the Laws of God, Customs of
the Church, or approved Ceremonies and Rites of Gods worship, and do perform
the services of God either negligently and disorderly, or do violate and break
them; or by their lewd lives and wicked actions do trouble and disquiet the
settled state of the Commonwealth; we may not say, that it belongs not to the
office of a Lay Prince to put them in mind of their duties, and to admonish
them; and if this will not serve, to bridle their audacious actions by his
Princely authority: and this doctrine I take to be well warranted by the
letter and examples of the Scripture. If out of the mouths of these two
witnesses, this doctrine be not sufficiently concluded, we will endeavor to
euince the same out of the Pragmaticks of France, and Courts of Justice here in
England; and first of France. Posse magistrarum animaduertere in vestales. P.

The Vestall Virgins are not free from the punishment of the Temporal

the same: but a good pair of legs were his own best defense, he ran away,

Gustus in his steed, before fifty Doctors of Divinity, and Sorbonists in

error, and not only his, but Boniface the eighths; and forthwith their chief
Divines offered themselves prompt, and ready to take the Oath of Allegiance,
or to give any satisfaction to the King, or Courts of Justice. But why dwell
we so long in France, when domesticis exemplis abundamus? England is
sufficiently provided to furnish us with examples out of Westminster, or the
Tower, as may appear by the diligent hand of a most knowing Lawyer, who has
collected them together, sending them to a reverend friend of mine, who coppied
them out, and imparted the Transcript unto me; whence I gather, that it was a
familiar matter in old time, when the State stood Popish, and the Judges stood
too much affected with that, which they now call the Roman Religion, to sue,
fine, and imprison Archbishops, Bishops, Deanes and Clergy men, for beating,
wounding, burning houses, killing of men, cutting of lips; and not so only,
but about Prohibitions in, and Provisions out of the Realm; Appeals to, and
Bulls from Rome: and it would not serve a Bishops turn (so careful were the
Judges of keeping and preserving the ancient liberties and customs, and the
King his Crown and dignity,) that though they reverenced the Church according
to their blind devotion, yet a Bishop coming before a Lay-Iudge, pleading that
he was an anointed Bishop, Brother to the Pope, and an Ecclesiastical person,
that he was a Clerk; neither of both could be heard, but in the Tower,
Marshalsey, King's Bench, etc. or fined and ransomed: brought they Letters,
Prohibitions and Bulls from Rome, the very bringing whereof, was no less danger
then a Praemunire. I know you expect proofs, and not words; Records, and no
other proofs; and therefore I proceed, and show out of the Records, that

For Archbishops and Bishops, Anno 27. R. Henrici filij I^nioris, there came a
precept to the Judges of the King's Bench, to proceed against Robert, Bishop of
Worcester, and others, in a cause of Prohibition, as being against the Kings
Crown and Dignity.

The Bishop of Exeter lost his Temporals, for not admitting the Kings Clerk to
the Church of Southwell.

The Bishop of Ely for being accessory to the burning of Blanch Wakes house,
and murdering of Will* Holme (which was killed in a Wood by his servants, and
entertained by him after the fact was done) was put upon his twelve Godfathers.

Walter, Bishop of Exceter, for appealing to the Court of Rome, to the Kings
great prejudice, finds sureties to answer the matter before the King, Anno 6.
Edw. 1.

Semblably, Ralph, Bishop of Bath and Wells, was proceeded against, for
summoning men to Rome. Anno 19. Edw 3.

William, Bishop of Norwich, had his Temporals seized on, for excommunicating
one Richard that brought the Kings Prohibition, Anno 20. Edw. 3.

Adam Hereford, for partaking with Roger Mortimer, is tainted in Parliament,
notwithstanding the Archbishops challenge. Anno Edw 17

Rob. Archbishop of Canterburies body was to be taken, for excommunicating the
Sherifes when he came to serve the Kings Warrant. Anno 32. Edw. 1.

And to see how small a matter would incense the King, and how sharp his
punishments would be against the Clergy, there was a warrant sent down to the
Sheriff of Worcester, to serve upon him for hunting only in Windsore Park.

Concerning Deanes of Churches, and Abbots, and Priors of Conuents.
THe Priors of Kockford and Bingam, were sued for proceeding against some in
the spiritual Court after prohibition. R. Io. anno 15.

The Deane of Doncaster for molesting diverse of the Kings liege people, was
convicted before the Judges, and admitted to his fine.

The Prior and Covent of Saint Patricks in Dublin, lost their Temporals, for
electing an Archbishop without the Kings consent. Anno 6. Edw. 1.

The Deane of Wooluer-hampton was cited to appear before the Judges for his
contempt, for admitting one Ottobon to a Prebend in the same Church, by a
Mandate from the Pope. Anno 31. Edw. 1.

The Prior of Canterbury for appealing to the Court of Rome, was adjudged to
be imprisoned, and to revoke his Appeal. Anno 23. Edw. 1.

Io. Abbat of Walden attached for the same. Anno eodem.

Thus far of Bishops, Deanes, Abbots and Priors; the recital of the rest
would fill the book, and not much more satisfy the Reader, and therefore I
forbear to name them, and come now to show how little the Pope of Rome, or his
Bulls were regarded of our English Judges. There was an Act made against drawing
causes to Rome, anno 27. Edw. 3. and a commandment given, anno 16. Edw. filij
R. Edwardi, that no man should alienate, sell, or send any thing beyond the
Seas; and how many were accordingly indicted and committed: as Io. Ouerton to
the Tower, Simon Mellercet to the Kings Bench, anno 28. Edw. 3. William
Beuercot to the Marshalsey, anno Regis filij Edwardi 17. And for the Popes
Bulls, how little were they regarded, or rather how greatly were the getters or
procurers, their fautors and abettors, and those that did but threaten to make
use of them punished and censured? There was a proceeding with some severity
against one, that threatened, he would get a Bull from the Pope, Anno 27. R.
Henrici. There was likewise an Inquisition indented, taken for those that
procured them, anno 20. Edw. 3. their Abettors, anno R. Edw. 4. and one that
pleaded them was committed to prison. So then those that bought those Bulls at
Rome (giving Gold for Lead) found them still Lead, and no better here in
England, and neither Bulls, Appeals Bishops, or liberties of the Church, could
protect them against the King, his Crown and dignity, Kings of England here,
and (I trust ever shall be able) to maintain their sovereign jurisdiction
within these Kingdoms, over all persons, and in all causes, against all
foreign jurisdiction, which comes next in order to be handled.

The Third Proposition.
The King is not subject to any foreign jurisdiction.
THe Pope pretends to be the Head of the Catholic Church, how rightly we
shall see hereafter; I am sure the King of England holds it by as good right,
as the Law of God, and the Law of this Kingdom can give him. I know it will
be presently objected, that King Henry the eighth being a violent King, took
this title upon him; they are certainly deceived that either think or say it;
and therefore to manifest this point the better, I will tell you my conceit how
this matter was brought to pass, not without an especial providence of God,
out of very unlikely means. For, when King Henry the eighth was sharpened
against Luther, there wanted not some about him, that buzzed this into the
Kings ears, that the doctrine of Martin Luther was nothing else but drawn
from the heretical proposition of John Wicklife, which was condemned long
since in, and by his University of Oxford. Whereupon the King being tickled
(because the full knowledge of this at that time served well for his purpose)
presently dispatched Edward Leighton, one of his Chaplains, and Bachelor of
Divinity, with those Letters to the University of Oxford.

By the King.
TRusty and well-beloved, We greet you well. And Ex Registro Actoru^ in Archiuis
Acad. Oxon. p. 109. etc.
forasmuch as We at this instant time, for certain great and weighty
considerations Us moving, touching as well the repressing of such erroneous
opinions and heresies; as be now a days spread abroad in sundry places; as
also the consolation of Christ's Church, and good Christian people, be desirous
not only to be advertised of the Articles whereupon Wicklife was condemned
heretofore by that Our University of Oxford; but also of the confirmation of
the Council of Constance, concerning the condemnation of the said Articles: We
therefore will, that ye with all celerity do send unto Us, by Our trusty and
well-beloved Chaplain, M. Edward Leighton, the bearer in writing, under the
Seal of Our said University, in as lawful and Authentic wise (as ye can
devise) as well all and singular the said Articles of condemnation of the said
Wicklife, and also the confirmation thereupon of the said Council of
Constance, giving unto Our said Chaplain firm credence in such things, as he
shall show unto you in Our behalf touching the premises. And in thus doing,
you shall minister unto Us full acceptable pleasure. Yeuen under our signet at
our Castle of Windesore, the last day of July.

Upon the receipt of these Letters, followed a Convocation; a Delegacie was
appointed the sixth of this instant month, (there wanted no cel^ritie;) the
Instrument is made, and both it and the answer to the Kings Letters sealed the
ninth day of that very month. Amongst those Articles that were sent up, there
were diverse that did mainly trench upon the Popes power, which (as Wickliefe
said) were neither found, nor founded upon Gods Word. What effects these
Articles wrought in the Kings mind, I know not: but of one thing I am well
assured, that not long after, the King being at variance with the Pope, a
Parliament was called with in two years, and a motion was made therein, that
the King should be declared Head of the Church: but his Majesty refused, till
he had advised with his Universities upon that point; and whilst the
Parliament sat, God (in whose hands the hearts of Princes are, so disposing
it), the King reflecting belike upon Wickliefes former Articles, directing his
Letters to the University of Oxford, about the election of the Bishop of
Lincoln into the Chancellorship of the University of Oxford, in the room of
Archbishop Warham, lately deceased; After the accomplishment whereof (says the
King) Our pleasure and commandment is, that ye, as shall be beseem men of
virtue, and profound literature, diligently entreating, examining, and
discussing a certain question, sent from Us to you, concerning the power and
primacie of the Bishop of Rome; send again to Us in writing under your common
Seal with convenient speed and celeritie your mind, sentence, and assertion of
the quaestion, according to the mere and sincere truth of the same, willing
you to give credence to Our trusty and well-beloved, this bringer, your
Commissarie; Ex Registro Act. in Archiuis Academia Ox^n ad ann. Dom. 1534. p.
127. etc.
as well touching Our further pleasure in the premises, as for other matters,
etc. Yeuen under Our Signet at Our Manor of Greenewich the eighteenth day of
May.

Upon the receipt of these Letters, the University (at that time, for ought we
know, consisting all of Papists) being assembled in Convocation, decreed, as
follows: That for the examination, determination, and decision of this
question, sent unto them to be discussed from the Kings Majesty, viz Whether
the Bishop of Rome had any greater Jurisdiction collated upon him from God in
the holy Scripture, in this Kingdom of England, than any other foreign
Bishop; that there should be deputed thirty Divines, Doctors and Bachelors of
Divinity of that faculty, to whose sentence, assertion, or determination, or
the greater part of them, the common Seal of the University in the name
thereof should be affixed: provided, that the question should be first
disputed, and then sent up to his Majesty. And the 27. of June, in the year
of our Savior 1534. this Instrument following was made, and sent up, sealed
with the common Seal of the University. The Instrument it self is in Latin,
in English thus.

TO all the sons of our Mother the Church, to whom these present Letters
shall come, John, by the grace of God, Chauncellor of the famous University of
Oxon, and the whole assembly of Doctors and Masters, Regents and not Regents,
in the same greeting. Whereas our most noble and mighty Prince and Lord, Henry
the eighth, by the grace of God, of England and France, King, Defender of the
Faith, and Lord of Ireland; upon the continual requests and complaints of his
Subjects exhibited unto him in Parliament, against the intolerable exactions of
foreign Jurisdictions, and upon diverse controversies had, and moved about the
Jurisdiction and power of the Bishop of Rome, and for other diverse and urgent
causes against the said Bishop then and there exponed and declared, was sent
unto, and humbly desired, that he would provide in time some fit remedy, and
satisfy the complaint of his dear Subjects. He, as a most prudent Solomon,
minding the good of his Subjects, over whom God has placed him; and deeply
pondering with himself how he might make good and wholesome Laws for the
government of his Commonwealth; and above all things taking care, that nothing
be there resolved upon against the holy Scripture (which he is, and ever will
be ready to defend with hazard of his dearest blood) out of his deep wisdom,
and after great pains taken hereabouts, has transmitted, and sent unto his
University of Oxon, a certain question to be disputed, viz. Whether the
Bishop of Rome has any greater Jurisdiction granted to him from God in the
holy Scripture, to be exercised and used in this Kingdom, then any other
foreign Bishop; and has commanded us, that disputing the question after a
diligent and mature deliberation and examination of the premises, we should
certify his Majesty under the common Seal of our University, what is the
true meaning of the Scriptures in that behalf, according to our Judgments and
apprehensions. We therefore the Chancellor, Doctors and Masters above
recited, daily and often remembering, and altogether weighing with our selves,
how good and godly a thing it is, and congruous to our Profession, be fitting
our submissions, obediences and charities, to foreshew the way of truth and
righteousness to as many as desire to tread in her stepps, and with a good,
sure and quiet conscience, to anchor themselves upon Gods Word; we could not
but endeavor our selves with all the possible care that we could devise, to
satisfy so just and reasonable a request, so great a Prince (who, next under
God, is our most happy and supreme Moderatour and Governor.) Taking therefore
the said question into our considerations, with all humble devotion, and due
reverence (as becomes us) and assembling our Divines together from all parts,
taking time enough, and many days space to deliberate thereof diligently,
religiously, and in the fear of God, with zealous and upright minds, first,
searching, and searching again, the Book of God, and the best Interpreters
and Commenters thereupon, disputing the said questions solemnly and publicly
in our Schools, have in the end unanimously, and with joint consent resolved
upon the Conclusion; that is to say, That the Bishop of Rome has no greater
Jurisdiction given unto him in Scripture, then any other Bishop in this
Kingdom of England. Which our assertion, sentence, or determination so upon
deliberation, maturely and thoroughly discussed, and according to the tenor of
the Statutes and Ordinances of this our University concluded upon publicly in
the name of the whole University, we do pronounce and testify, to be sure,
certain and consonant to the holy Scripture. In witness whereof we have
caused these our Letters to be written, sealed, and ratified by the Seal of
our University. Yeuen in our Assembly-house the 27. of the month of June, in
the year of Christ 1534.

This Instrument being brought into the Parliamenthouse, an Act passed, whereby
the King was declared Supreme Head and Governor of the Church. What
exception? was it taken or given? The Parliament motioned some such matter to
the King; his Majesty wisely refers it to the Learned of his University;
the University to thirty Delegats; the referrees return their joint opinion
to the King; that the Pope had no more to do here in England, then any other
foreign Bishop: this their opinion was grounded on the Scripture; the places
of Scripture confirmed by the exposition of the best interpreters: the
Parliament upon full knowledge of this, banish all foreign Jurisdiction out of
the Realm, to the comfort of Gods Church, and the relief of his distressed
subjects, which had so long been inthralled and groaned under this Baby lonish
captivity. What remains? If this be not satisfactorie, Ireferre you to the
reading of three excellent pieces of this Argument, which I forbear to insert
into this book; first, In my Cosen Richard James of C. C. C. of Beckets
De-canononization, lib. 3. c 4
because of prolixitie; secondly, because ere long, you shall have them all
comprised in one volume. The first is taken out of Guicciardine, the second out
of Machiauell, the third out of Stephen Pasquier, quarit Recerches. The place
in Guicciardine is shamefully expunged; that of Machiauell with the whole
book, and all his Works forbidden; only Pasquier is improhibited and
unpurged. But no thanks to the Inquisitors, for fear lest our French men,
which are accounted lost men at Rome, should be utterly lost from the Church
of Rome, if the Inquisitors went about to infringe their Pragmaticall
Constitutions. Of these three witnesses, two of them are without exception,
Guicciardine and Pasquier: the third is branded for an Atheist, and (as I dare
not make any Apologies for him, so many, and so great Scholars having fastened
this imputation upon him) so I cannot but say (it is only my conjecture) that
if Machiauell had not touched the Popes freehold, but suffered him to have
been a God upon earth, Machiauell had been no Atheist for this book, but might
have hoped rather to have been a Cardinal: but how deadly soever they hated
him, and interdicted his Works, at his death (as it seems) he left his
Machiauelismes to be disposed of by the Pope and his Cardinals, which have
made no small use of his politic ends. But to reuert, the tenor of these
before recited places being read and perused, and thought upon, may breed such a
vnitic in our Christian Princes, that both Church and Commonwealths may be much
the better for it. If I fail in my conjecture, yet my hopes and prayers shall
stand good. And thus having plainly showed the Kings Supremacy, and made him
Head of the Church, let us see, what can be said in defense of foreign
Jurisdiction; or, which is all one, for the Popes Primacie.

First, the Papists will plead a deed of gift, or gift from Constantine the
Great, a great gift, if it can be proved. It is registered in their Canon Law,
(though the Record where it is, be somewhat doubted of; yet it is confirmed out
of Gesta Syluestri,) which is (if I durst believe them) of an undoubted truth.
I answer; First, the Donation, or gift it self, (I will give them this gift
before hand) is not found at all in all our English Copies, nor in Gestis
Syluestri. There antiquity knows them not; they must be contented to
forbear to urge this donation any longer. And I am moved the rather to think
so, because by their own confessions, if this gift of all the Western
Provinces, etc. were made to the Church (as is suggested,) doubtless it was
made by Syluesters Constantine, upon his Baptisine. But what if this Story be
not true? Then it will follow very suantly, no Syluester, no Baptism; no
Baptism, no such Constantine; no such Constantine, no Donation. And that this
is not a bare conjecture of mine, but comes appar^elled unto you with some
likelihoods at the least. Hearken The ^wner of this, Master Hen Party of C. C.
C. Bachelor of Divinity has given it to the Library
I pray you, what an ancient Writer says, the Copy whereof is now in my
hands, but shall hereafter (if I can persuade) be placed in the public
Library, ad dicti fidem liberandam, and ad perpetuam rei memoriam.

According to some Writers (says he) this was not Constantine the Emperor,
which was baptized and converted by Pope Syluester (as some other Histories
seem to intimate, or insinuate), but it was Constantinus, the father of this
Constantine, as we find it recorded in other Histories. By this time we have
(...) a gift, and no gift; for farther proof, put the matter to any
indifferent Jury of Papists, and if they cast not the Papists, if they dare
join issue with us upon this very point, we will yield. But what if a full
Jury should not appear upon the summons, on the day of trial? Surely then I
would say, there were some knavery abroad, and some such thing it is. I hear
upon good intelligence, that some of them are coming on the way, that offer
readily to depose of our side: but they are deposed already from coming, or so
harend being come, that you cannot get a word from them: but speak they shall,
and must. One of them (as I am informed) has these words against your
temporal and foreign Jurisdiction. The Citizens of Io Paulus Langius in

Rome (quoth he) carrying boughs of Palm in their hands, came unto Pope
Innocent, and offered up the Keys of their City, and granted unto him the
temporal Dominion of the City of Rome, neither moved with any just ground,
neither are they to be commended for it; since abundance of temporal things
does much hinder the progress of spiritual affairs. Nor in truth ought the
Pope himself (though he be Peter's successor) take any such temporal
Dominion, that might entangle, or endanger his government, into his hands. For
it is not read in old time, since the time of Constantines Donation (wherewith
all our Canonists, whom I must needs say, are too curious in this point, make
themselves merry), that any chief Bishop did take upon him the temporal
Government of the City of Rome. But of late days, and in the memory of man,
some Popes procuring labor and trouble upon themselves, have been so bold, as
to intermeddle therewith. This witness speaks well, but not so fully to our
purpose; let us hear another, Ex eo, inquit, Pontifex multarum vrbam dominus,
and qui ante religionis Maiestate res tenebat, mox imperio and potentia
metuendus fuit: etsi quidam historiarum ignari, and temporum nescii, ignorato
rerum gestatum ordine, a Constantino Syluestro Pontifici datum referant.
Gunthorus po^ta Ligu^nius, page 383. Spigelius Script. Germ v. 2.
Guntherus, or rather Spigelius: From this time forward, the Pope, Lord of many
Cities, that awed men heretofore by the Majesty and greatness of his
Religion, is now feared for his greatness and power: and yet if all were
known, it would not be found so great (as it seems): for some unskillful
Historians, ignorant of the course of times, and the order of things, do say,
that Constantine gave some such matter to Pope Syluester. How now? Are all they
unskillful in Histories, ignorant of times, knowing not the order of things,
that defend Constantines Donation? this censure may prick to the heart, and
fetch blood. But the same Author has not yet done with these Constantine-gift
defenders: Oh, Sed neque tanta fuit largitio Designat vulgatam illam
Constantini iam dicti Donationem, de qua apud nullos extat Auctores,
praeterquam in libro Decretorum, idque in antiquis voluminibus minime contineri
auctor est Antoninus in Chronicis. Quamquam Isidorus in Historia sua scribit
eum vrbe Roma Pontifici cessis^e, ornamentisque omnibus Imperialibus, Diademate
viz habituque, and albo equo, quo vehebatur. Basilicas item dicitur nonnullas
in vrbe condidisse. Sed quid haec ad tam immensum, vt aiunt, Petri Patrimonium,
elephantia Constantini, san guine puerorum, and Syluestri baptismate partum? O
beata^ nugas, quae tantum constituere Imperium. In Laurentium Vallam, virum

libello, qui iam vulgo notissimus est, nullum ius sieve munus Imperii Pontifici

he means the Donation of Constantine (which is so commonly spoken of) and yet
as common as it is, there is no Record of it, but in the Decrees, nor in the
Decrees, neither in ancient Copies (just as I told you before) so says
Antoninus in his Chronicle. Isidorus, I confess, in his History writes, that
Constantine quitted the City of Rome, leaving it to the Pope, and with it, his
Imperial Robes, Diadem, and white Horse which he was wont to ride on, and
bestowed many dignities. What is all this to so great a Patrimony, as they say,
of Peter, purchased by his leprosy, his cure thereof, by the blood of Infants,
and his baptism by Syluester? Oh happy tales! which erected so great and large
an Empire. We read a certain distich against Laurentius Valla, a man hated
and persecuted for the truth, laboring to prove in a book, now in the hands
almost of every one, that the Pope has not any right or title granted to him
of Empire, or temporal Government, etc. So these honest men that are likely to
be impannelled upon this Jury, (and I will be bound to bring forth a full
Jury of these, if Jury Masters of the Inquisition do not cut out their
tongues, before they come to be produced either as witnesses or Jurors;) or if
they do, they may happen to rue it, by that time we have inquired (as diligent
inquiry shall be made) either by writ, or by a dedimus potestatem. Do you know
the danger? It is Felony by the Statute, and villainy vnexpiable. But if all
that has bin said, cannot satisfy our Roman Catholics about this their
Donatiue, what if we be able to bring forth a plainer Surrender again into the
Emperors hands, of all that large Grant from Justinian the Emperor, or
Charles the Great, and why not from Constantine? It is to be read in a Leo P.
8. Othonem ipsum coronau^t, and vniuersalem Augustum declarauit: omnemque
eligendi Pontificis authoritatem a Clero populoque Romano abstulit: and
Gratiano referente, in ipsum Othonem transtulit: vt habemus in Cau. 63. di. C.
in Synodo: and non modo Imperiales titulos; verum etiam omnes Donationes per
Iustinian^ Carolumque Imperatores Ecclesiae Romans factas Leo hic Othoni and eius
successoribus concessit; vt scilicet Italiam ab inuasoribus defensarent. Io.
Stella in vita Leonis 8.
Popish Writer, and what reason have Protestants not to believe it? This, I
say, as not believing it much, because (as I have formerly showed) their own
Authors do diffide the Donation as much, or rather more then we: but in case
the Donation be proved, and the witnesses and testimonies against us be
disprooued, this shall serve to close up their stomachs.

But the Papists say, they have a better Grant from Christ Jesus, the true
Emperor of the whole World, on whose thigh is written this divine Impresa, Rex
regum and Dominus Dominantium: the proofs taken out of the Scripture (the
Protestants Card) in diverse places of the New Testament, and some out of the
Old, as Matthew. 16. Thou art Peter, and upon this Peter will I build my Church.
And again: To thee (Peter) will I give the Keys, etc. and again: Ecce duo
gladij; two Swords at once, to signify two Empires, either of them two-edged,
as well to stablish the Empire in the person of Peter, as to cut off all
opposites, and all knots and difficulties, that are incident unto these
controversies.

Touching, Thou art Peter; and, Upon this Peter, etc. unless they get more by
their Salt-peeter (as they are Devils in the Vault) then by their Peter, they
are not likely to get much, for the Popes either temporal or spiritual power
out of this place: you must make your Peter either the Rock of Faith, or the
Rock of Christ; or else you dash against so many worthy and famous Writers of
your own, as against so many rocks. ^ Fer^^s, ^ Ferus in ^. 16. Math p 220.

Ferus and Faber in the places above named, the one gives these Keys to the
Church, the other unto faith. Concerning that which is objected out of the
Gospel, Ecce duo gladij, I may very well say unto them, as Christ did unto
Peter; Put up your Swords, the controversy is ended: (for ought I know,) thus
writes the Commenter upon Guntherus, by occasion of these words, Sequitur
commentitiam Scholasticorum Theologorum sententiam; qui Christi verba de duobus
gl^diis, vt pleraque alia, quae propius ad philophiam caelestem pertine bant,

Gladijs quae rite duobus Niti^ur: He seems (quoth he) to follow the
commentitious opinion of the Schoole-Diuines, who do not so much interpret, as
subvert the words of Christ of two Swords, as they do all other that
appertain unto this heavenly Philosophy, against the example of his life,
which is our best precept, against the doctrine of the blessed Apostles, and so
many thousands of Martyrs, and the whole stream of ancient Interpreters
commenting upon this place. In these few words, Behold two Swords, (say they
full wisely God wot) one for the Emperor, the other for the Church: and yet
would they be pleased to hearken unto Christ, he would inform them, that his
Kingdom is not of this World: and the Apostle semblably, Our weapons are not
carnal, but power full unto God, etc. Which latter words, as well as the
former, are objected against Hildebrand by Conrade Bishop of Trai^ct at a
meeting of all the Bishops of Cermany and France at Ga^st^ng, reproching him
very worthily, for going about Gladio duplici ense ancipiti ad viuum reserare.

places of both Testaments. Thus you see plainly, that the edge of both your

Gerochus in Auentine, is bold to put you in mind, that this double or
two-edged Sword, is given to save and quicken us, and not to kill, he
understands this Sword spiritually of the Word of God, the life and light of
men, that is able by its power to raise dead men to life, to make gods of men,
and to convert and turn mortality into immortality. Thus far Io Auentine,
so much, and so often commended by your Papists: though you have taken away his
just commendations, quo iure, quaue iniuria, I know not. But the best is, Iam
enim Pontisices in eam venerant Maiestatem (quam Principes Saeculares dicut
presumptionem) vt Reges crearent, citantes verbum primi post Christum
Pontificis, Ecce (in quit Petrus) duo gladij hic Contra quod Principes ipsi

pugnare. Albert. Krantz. Wandal. l. ^ c. 2. p. 17^.
Albertus Krantzius, as good a Writer as he, gives this censure of your two
Swords: The Roman BB. were come now to take that state upon them (which our
Temporal Princes (says he) call presumption) as to create Princes, citing for
themselves Peter's words, that was first Bishop after Christ, Behold, here are
two Swords, against which, our Temporal Princes oppose the words of Christ,
Put up thy Sword into thy sheath; interpreting it of the material, carnal,
and temporal Sword; as if it were not lawful for the Pope to use that to his
purpose. And thus having put up your Swords, and showed out of your own best
Writers, that these Keys will not serve to open the way to any foreign
Jurisdiction, we cleave fast to the Rock Christ, or faith; and do certainly
believe, that the Pope has no temporal Jurisdiction, either in this Land, or
any other Country, out of the New Testament: as little help is there out of
the places of the old; for in this very question, you would be accounted like
the good Householder in the Gospel, that have both old and new in store for us.

The places cited by you, are two in number, and none in effect. The first is
taken out of Deuteronomy. 17. He that shall refuse to obey the commandment of the
Priest, by the decree of the Judge shall die the death. This argument being
taken out of a corrupt reading in your Bibles, ex for and, and well In a

while, while we examine that other of planting and displanting, planting Gods

sufficiently out of the ancient Manuscripts: but I content my self only for
the present, with that Exposition which the Council of Con^. Bas. MS p. 678.
Basil gives of these words, answerable to my former words, and contrary to
your unwonted exposition. And thus having extinguished the Popes pretenced

then others have done before me of your own side; some of them of great mark
and eminency. I trust I shall find favor both with God and men, both Papists
and Protestants; or if the worst come to the worst, I hope I shall have a

him, that he should not die, till he came into Jerusalem. Hereupon he
promised himself many years, and bade his soul take much ease; for as for
that Jerusalem that was above, he meant never to go to it; and for that on
earth, it was beyond the Seas too far for his Holiness to go: but (as
secure as he was of his life and happiness) as the Devil would, there was a
Chapel called by that name, which for the very name of a Chapel, he had not

that his Majesty may restrain with the Civil Sword, the stubborn and evil

to be explained by the more temperate and moderate sort of Papists.

In the Chapter preceding, we have forced the Temporal Sword out of the Popes
hands; and that it may be drawn forth against the stubborn and evil doers,
none but the frantic Anabaptist, will dare to deny. With them and their
fantastical propositions and delirations, we will have nothing to do; at this
present we will inquire only, how far forth this Sword is to be drawn,
according unto the Papists Tenet, and the practice of these Kingdoms.

Of the 22. Article.
Of Purgatory.
THE Romish doctrine concerning Purgatory, Prayers, worshipping and adoration,
as well of Images, as of Relics, and also invocation of Saints, is a fond
thing, vainly invented and grounded upon no warrant of Scripture, but rather
repugnant to the Word of God.

This 22. Article explained and maintained by Papists.
HEre we are to run through Purgatory; or rather, through a Hell of deuilish
inventions; but I will contract my self and it. The Church of England gives no
definition of it in this Article, neither can it be defined, because non entis
nullae sunt qualitates: but out of the writings of moderate Papists, it may be
described briefly thus:

Purgatory is a pretty slight to pick men's purses. Largely thus.
PVrgatorie is an excellent invention of fiction of some Cacologus, Schoolmen,
or Legendaries, founded upon dreams and revelations, to certain politic
ends: partly unknown, partly known to pick men's purses, and fill the Popes
cofers, to defeat men of their lands, and rob their souls of true comfort,
leaving nothing in men's consciences but scruples and terrors, to think when it
began, what it is, how long it shall continue, for years, days, months, or
till the day of judgment. This awing the people by it, more then by any thing,
and causing them to reverence their persons more then any men; that can by
their Prayers, mages, Inuocations, and Relics of Saints, Indulgences,
Funerals and Diriges (being well hired unto the same,) quench this fire,
deliver these souls out of Purgatori, and free them a poena, and send them
straight into Paradise to their endless joy and comfort (as they think, and
are persuaded by their ignorant guides). To course over the parts of this
description. It is a mere fiction, not of their Theologus but of their A

revelations of men, that See Higden ad (...) 67^ especially about the story of
the fellow at Longcompton, that was tormented in his grave, till he had paid

cofers. What scruples it leaves in the conscience, I leave to your
considerations, when you shall perfectly understand, that either there was no
mention of it De Purgatorio nulla mentio Inda^ ^ renaum. Apud priscos nulla vel
quam ^arissima fiebat mentio, sed and Graecis ad hunc vs^ue diem non est
creditum esse. Episcopus Roffensis apud Polydenum Virgil. l. 8. c. 1 page 484.
in the primitive times, or very little; that the Graecians believe it not,
neither are the learned of the Papists able to define the place, quality,
duration, and extention of it unto this present day. The Papists have been ever
Scepticks in defining and defending it; take them of what time and age you
will, first, middle, or latter. For the first age, you have heard there was
little or no mention of it; and for the middle age, Quaeritur quid tit ignis
Purgator^us and qui tr^nsi^uri sunt per ilium. and qualiter. Quidam dicut, quod
est ignis materialis vltra ignis elementum non ignis cui sunt ligna materia and
nutrimentii: sed ignis qui ^am existens sub luna. M S O p 403.
one that wrote about some four of five hundred years ago (as may be
coniectured by the hand) makes it a very disputable question what it is, where
it is, who shall pass through it, and how long it shall continue.

The first point he resolves, but with a quidam dicunt, some say, that it is a
material fire, beyond the Element of fire; no such fire as is to be maintained
with wood, or nourished with any materials.

A^^ dicunt, quo* ignis ille nilul aliud est. quam poena, quae ideo dicitur
ignis quia grauis est, and vrens ad modum ignis; and quia quaedam poena pum^^ns
est and aeterna he de illa intelligeretur, dictus est ignis purgatorius, id est
non puniens, sed purgans per poenam temporaliter quis aeternaliter ne puniatur.
Quicquid autem sit ignis ille* credendum est, quod fideles etsi non omnes per
eu^ transeum illi scilicet qui perfectam poenitentiam in hac vita non egerunt
Sed alii plus sentiat, alii minus and ali^ cituis liberantur ab eo, alii
tardius Nam quidam vsque in diem iudicii in eo puniuntur quida^ cito liberantur
and hoc secundum quantitatem peccati and poenitentiae, and secunnum modum
confitend^, vt praedictum est. Nu^ O p 403.
Alii dicunt, others say, that it is nothing but a kind of punishment, likened
to, or called fire, because fire is the greatest of punishments, and this
burns like fire: and to distinguish it from Hell fire, that is lasting;
because this fire does not so much punish, as purge men by temporal pains, it
is called a Purgatory fire, or Purgatory.

Who shall go through it? Whatsoever the fire is, (here is no certain
resolution of the question,) believed it must be, that although all the
faithful children of God pass not through it, but these only which perfected
their penance in this life; yet with this distinction, that some souls shall
be punished more, some less. Some souls shall be delivered from thence
quickly in an instant. Some souls shall be kept there prisoners till the last
day of Judgment, according as they do penance, or sin; more or less, and
according to the manner of contrition. If this be their doctrine (as then it
was in those darker Ages of the World) what comfort out of all these doubtings?
May not a man say unto their School men, as Job ^6 2 h Animarum loca certa
assignare impossible Ant. de Dominis, l ^. c. 8 ss 122.

of some cruelty and incredulity, to hope for half pardons at his hands, that
is so good and merciful; the fountain of all goodness and mercy; either he
remitteth all, or none. And therefore laying all that hathbeen formerly spoken,
and a great deal more that may be alleged to this purpose, before our eyes,
let us safely conclude, that it is an unsafe way to make Purgatory (as it were)
an Article of our Creed, as our Vide formulam iuramenti.
Trent Masters do: at the least, let us take heed of Temerarium de rebus
abditissimit quae in alia vita fiunt ex se proprioque cerebro quidquam promere.
prying into those hidden mysteries, which God would have hidden, and dare
rather to invent, or hammer out somewhat out of our own brains, then to be
ignorant of any thing: let us not be too Temperent sibi Theologi ab immodica

confident in describing the place and quality of its punishment. A modest
ignorance of these things will best become us, till we have better warrant for
the same out of Gods revealed Word.

Of Indulgences.
PVrgatory should seem to have been in great request heretofore, it has such
a great train following after of Indulgences, Prayers for the dead, Relics,
Pilgrimages, Diriges, Funerals, Images, and inuocations of Saints. Though the
fall of Purgatory may be the overthrow of them all, yet we will (by God grace)
entreat of them severally in their order: and first of Indulgences, and Popish
Pardons, because they have so near Quamdiu nulla fuerat de Purgatorio cura
nemo quaesiuit indulgentias: nam ex illo pendet omnis Indulgentiarum
existimatio. Polyd. Virgil. l. 8. c 1 p. 484.
affinity with Purgatory, that if it be proved, that there is no Purgatory,
it will be easy to prove, that there are no Indulgences; and then the Popes Si
tollatur Purgatorium quorsum Indulgentiis opus erit? Ib.
market is marred, his Pardoners may go shake their ears.

First, for the original of them, we subscribe to the Council of P. 822.
Hist. Conc. Trid.
Trent: It is certain, and cannot be concealed, that in no Christian Nation of
the Eastern Church, either in ancient or modern time, there ever was any use
of Indulgences of any kind whatsoever. And in the West, if by ancient custom
they mean that which was observed before Urban the second, in the year 1095,
no proof can be brought of the use of Indulgences. If from that time, until
the year 1300. it will appear, that the use of them has been sparing, and
only to free men from punishments, imposed by the Confessor. Afterward, from
the Council of Vienna, the abuses began, which did increase very much, until
the time of Leo the tenth. Hitherto the Council, and yet no Counsel neither;
they say no more then all the World besides; I mean, a world of Papists, which
I have catalogued up according to the times where in they lived descendendo; I
hope they are all fit and proper.

In this Catalogue, I have mentioned none but such as were esteemed at the
least of their Church, and complained of the sundry abuses of it. I have
purposely omitted these that follow: P. Valdus, Io. Wickleph, Walter Brute,
Guil. Swinderby, Ric. Turmyn, Io. Cleydon, Io. Puruey, Henr. Token, Nic. Russe,
Ric. Hume: These were all Waldenses, Wickleuists, or Hussi^es; you will never
accept of their testimonies when they are brought against you, and I am very
well provided without them, to make good these two Propositions.

1. That there is no such treasure of the Church; we have but carbones pro the
sauro. 2. If there be, or put case there be; yet they are ill distributed, and
as they are bought and sold, cannot be defended.
These two Propositions are maintained and explained by the Papists, to whose
writings I have confined my self, when I might (as you perceive by that which
has been written) have made use of a great many more testimonies, both
pregnant and pertinent to my purpose: but these and a few Parchments shall
suffice.

The first Proposition.
That there is no such Treasure of the Chureh.
Whatsoever Pontanus the Jesuit, out of that of Virgil, Symbolarum l 1^ 40 6.
Aeneides In ilsud, ergo exercentur poenis, vide de poenis expiatoriis, p. 1509.
Infectu^ eluitur scelus aut exoritur ignis, proves Purgatory; yet you have
heard that Polydore Virgill could neither fetch Purgatory, nor Purgatory
Pardons so far, because the Well was deep, and his bucket would not reach so
far. Fr. Polygranus in his Catholic Assertions knows no other Pardons (nor
I,) then such as by the De Iure diuinc quilibet Sacerdos dare possit Fr.
Polygranus assert, quorundam Ecclesiae dogmatum. p. 68.
Law of God, any ordinary Priest might give unto a true penitent; that is, to
Sacerdos absoluit id est ostendit absolutum ab obligatione fori poenitenualis.
MS O p. 93 or, Ostendit peceatum esse dimissum vel retentum, and haec est
potestas quam dedi^ Deus ligandi at que soluendi. idest. ostendendi ligates.

Confessionem MS. O p. 410.
pronounce him absolved before God. He does this but declaratiue, or
ministerially; it is God alone that does truly forgive sins, and acquit us
both a paena and a culpa. Ego solus deleo iniquitatem populi. Item Ambrosius:
Ille solus peccata dimit tit qui solus pro peccatis mortuus est. Et Aug. Nemo
tollit peccata, nisi solus Christus, qui est agnui tollens peccata mundi tollit
autem and dimittendo qua facta sunt, and adiuuando ne fiant perducendo ad vitam
vbi omnino fieri non possunt. MS. O. p. 410.
I alone (says he) by the Prophet Isay, do put away, or put out the sins of
my people. Also Ambrose; He, and none but he, forgiueth sins, that died for
thee. And Saint Augustine most elegantly concludes the Chorus in these words;
No man can take away our sins but Christ alone, which is the immaculate Lamb
that takes away the sins of the World; he takes them away, both by
pardoning them that are already committed, and by keeping us from committing
any more, and by bringing us to heaven, where it is impossible to sin any
more. More then this, what can be said to take away the Keys from the Pope,
and give them to the true owner, Christ? To point us out with the finger, or to
direct us to the true Treasure of the Church, the Merits of our Savior, the
true Purgatory of Christ's blood: and thus much briefly of the first
Proposition.

The second Proposition.
That Indulgences, if they had been good at their first institution (which can
never be proved) being abused as they are, and ever will be, are not to be
tolerated any more in the Church of Christ.
THe Pope, whom Polygranus in the place before cited (which I had forgotten to
tell you) makes the sole Steward and distributer of this Propter varios abusus
restrictae ad Papam Ib. p. 68.
Treasure, for that they were abused, when they were in the hands of every
ordinary Priest to be disposed and distributed, as liked them best, pretends
the good of the Church by his Sub praetextu Turcorum infinitam collegerunt

Croisadoes, and building of Saint Peter's Fabrique. But he intends nothing
less, then the advancement of the true Cross, and the publishing of Saint
Peter's doctrine; but the dividing and sharing of so many millions amongst his
new made Cardinals, which he had Creauit denique and eodem tempore alios 30

fleeced but a little before; taking for the making of thirty Cardinals, not
passing five hundred thousand Crowns Quando adhuo illud S^^ruat^^ris

Alack, when shall our Saviors precept come in date, gratis accepistis, gratis
date? that they would bestow that freely, which freely they have received? But
it may be said, or feared at the least, that some of their Popes come not so
freely by their Chair, and therefore make a common Matte of these Pardons. As
Pope Boniface being both a covetous h Erat et pecuniae auidus, ad quam

his Brokers to trade for Pardons, ^ffering his plenarie Pardons so Petentibus

cheap, that many began to loath them, and wax weary of them: for there was
no sin so hateful, no crime so enormous, but it was bought out for ready
money. This was the second foul abuse of Pardons. But if we cast our eyes
upon the History of the Council of Trent, we shall see many horrible abuses of
Pardons, that could not Hist. Conc. Trid. p 169.
be related without tears; as first, that Leo 10. should give the benefit of
his Indulge^ces to his sister Magdalen, wife unto Franceschetto Cybo, Innoc. 8.
his bastard. Secondly, the Pardoners in Tauernes, and elsewhere in Games, and
other things not fit to be named spent them. The Trent-Masters durst not name
all the abuses, either for shame or modesty belike: but one Tho. Gascoigne,
that was sometime Chancellor of this University, and might have been Bishop of
this Realm, having Gascoigne in Dict^^nario Theol. MS
publicly read against the abuses of Indulgences in his Lectures at Oxon, and
showed that they were cause of much wickedness, afterward he relates these
particulars: That they Ib. in Calathi^.
were carried up and down the Country in Baskets, and either sold for six
pence, four pence, or two pence, or given for a game at Tennis for a cup of
Ale, and worse matters, that is in plain English, Pro actu meretricio.
for lying with awench. He himself is much against the Popes changing penance
into money: and farther shows, that there was a Doctor (English belike) at
the Council of Basil, disprouing Indulgences; out of a Paper-booke of the
Councels in Durham College. The book of Councels which the Doctor used, is
now fairly bound, and charily preserved in Balliol College, and the
authority that is cited out of that book against Indulgences, is to this Non
est putandu^n quod (Papa) vt pecunias recipiae det indulgentias, and si faceret
peccaret grauiter: nec te^erent* quia nec esset charitas in recipiente nec
pieta^ in causa Bas. MS. p ^09.
effect; to prove, that the Pope cannot sell his Pardons, and if he did, they
would be of no force, arguing neither charity in the one, nor piety in the
other. This I speak only upon my own conjecture, grounded upon these two
reasons: first, because there be four books of Sermons, Acts, and other
passages in that Council; and secondly, because he does treat of this point
somewhat largely, and with an English freedom. But esteem of its authority
as you will. To draw this point to some conclusion. I know your ears by this
time begun to glowgh, to hear of so much baggage stuff, seeing the doctrine
of Indulgences, take it at the best, is Hist. Conc. ^^id. p. 21.
rather disputable, then decided; take it at the worst, that it brings with
it many abuses, more then I have mentioned, noted by I^. p. 58.
John Gerson, and Nic. Clemangis, and Io. Collet of England: known by the
detestable gain by Indulgences, the Ib p. ^9.
people especially of Germany enthralled and robbed of their money, had not

reclaim, and declaime against the sundry abuses of them, being Quomam eiusmo ^

now grown into the general hatred of all men, and to banish them out of all
Germany, and we here in England not to admit them, until they be better
warranted unto us. Things that are good (as the brazen Serpent) out of your
own Gascoigne, may be taken away: and so much of Indulgences and Pardons.
Pardon me if I have insisted the longer on this point occasioned through
plenty of matter. I will contract my self in all the rest, leaving you to
imagine, what large volumes may be written of controversies out of their own
Indices, if either I had all of them, or all were written out of them: but I
may with thankfulness to the Almighty, say unto them that mean to spend
hours well in this kind, Principium dedi vobis. I only intend and propose
unto my self an Introduction unto the Controversies in this first Edition.

Of Prayers for the Dead.
OF prayers for the dead, what shall I say? Seeing that in our prayers whether

that they will profit us little or nothing; and that we are to be accountable
at the last day of Judgment, for every idle word, they were better forborne,
then used, and that I may conclude all in the marginall note upon Greg.
Neocaesariensis word, vere sentiunt qui sublat as volunt preces pro defunctis:
they think aright, which would f In Greg Nc^^aesar in Metaphrasi in

sub^a^ar volunt precespro defunctis.
have prayers for the dead abolished, according to the plain doctrine of the
Church of England.

Of Relics and Pilgrimages.
FIrst, of Relics, seeing they Auaritia and turp^^ quaestus multo^ errores

pietatem O quot scrup^ conscientiae timidis and infirmis mentibus ingeruntur,

sprung both from one root, covetousness and gain, which is the root of all
evil. We will inquire, whether there be any true Relics, or no; proceeding
in right method, first, to prove the (...), and then to talk of the (...)
afterward.

Let it be first agreed upon of all hands, that if Relics be to be worshipped
of any, then much more of Christ, the blessed Virgins, and his Apostles; but
all these are either uncertain, or unknown; of Christ what have we
remaining, but some few cart loades of his Cross, or Nails wherewith he was
fastened to the Cross? which he that will believe, must have faith more then
a grain of Mustardseed, so incredible are they (if the relation be true which
I find recorded in an ancient Parchment book. The history is somewhat long,
but withal strange, and therefore we will hear it, and it be but for its
novelty to you, and incredibiliti^ both to you and me. I read (says my
Author) b In quadam Chronica Authentica legitur, etc. MS. 29. p. 84.
that Helena was the daughter of Choel, King of the Britains, whom
Constantine at his coming into Britain married, being the only daughter of
her father. After whose death, the whole Island deuolued, unto him. So much
wemay read in the British Stories: but some there be that fetch her pedigree
and descent as far as Treuers. Thus much a man may believe, although that he
have but some few grains or scruples of faith: But that which follows, can
hardly be believed, without some scruple of conscience, though he had whole
mountains of faith, or as much faith as would remove Mountains into the Sea;
yet, I say, it will hardly be believed. The said Helena being desirous to find
out Christ's Cross, and nails (a most excellent invention, whosoever put it
into her head) sent for all SI de hoc Regina quae sierit, vide ne hoc sibi

the Jews: the I was supposing it was for some such business, feared and
resolved, that they would never confess where it was One Judas (mistake him
not for Judas Iscariot) yet it was one almost as ancient as he: perhaps, some
men will wonder how this should come to pass, when it is known, that Helena
called this assembly of Jews, more then 270. years after Christ? I answer
out of the same Author, that perhaps men lived longer Nisi forte dice es, quod
tunc homines plus quam modo viu^bant MS 24 ^ 83 Iuss^t ^os omnes igne cre^ari.
Hic, Domina Iusti and prophetae filius optime nouit l^ge, and tibi omnia quae
quaelieris ab eo in^icabit.
then, then they do now. Zachaeus was his Grandfather, and Saint Stephen that
was stoned to death, was this Judas brother: this Judas (I say) when Queen
Helena threatened to burn them all alive, if they would not tell her; for all
their solemn vow, was discovered to her to be the only man, that knew where
the Cross was hidden: so she set them aside, and took Judas along with her,
and told him in plain terms, that if he would not tell her where Golgotha
was, that the Cross might be found, eft soones she would throw him into a pit,
and there he should lie (as sure as Christ died for her) till he were famished
to death: which was instantly done, and there he lay poor soul six days
and six nights: but on the seventh day he made signs to come forth, and made
show that he would tell them where the precious Relic of the Cross was. As
soon as he came forth, down falls he to his prayers, (which that it might
be the more available was joined with much fasting) straight ways whilst he
prayed, the ground shook, and yielded forth a sent of most pleasant smelles.
Whereat Judas lift up both his hands, and said; Now do I know of a truth, that
Christ is the Savior of the world. Now in that place (as we read in the
Ecclesiastical History (for this is not a Legend-storie) there was whilome a
Temple of Venus, the Goddess of lust, built by Adrian the Emperor, wherein
whosoever prayed, might be thought to pray to her Deity, and therefore it was
unfrequented, and ready to fall: but Queen Helena razed it to the ground, and
plowed it up. After this Judas begins to settle himself to his business, and
having dug not passing 20. yards in the ground, he found three Crosses,
which with great joy he carried unto Queen Helena. But lo, here a doubt,
that did much perplex them all, it could not be known, which was Christ's
Cross, from the thiefes; nor of the two thieues Crosses, which was the good
thiefes, and which was the bads: but that mattered not. But as God would have
it, there was a young man carried forth to be buried; Judas stayed the Bear
with his band, and laid the first cross upon the body, and it stirred not;
and then he laid the second cross upon it, and it stirred not; but when he
touched the body with the third Cross, the young man started up; and if this
be not true, the Sea burns. Would you know what became of this wonder-working
Judas? He was baptized not long after by the name of Quiriacus, and in time,
anno nullo, regnante nemine, (the time certainly cannot be assigned) was made
Bishop of Jerusalem, and was put to death by Julian the Emperor, after most
exquisite torments. This Quiriacus upon entreaty of the same Empress, was so
happy as to find out the Nails, wherewith our Savior was crucified,
glistering in the ground as it were any gold. How Helena disposed of them, I
leave to Gregorius Turonensis, and other Fablers to inform you: for my part, I
believe neither part, nor parcel of this Story, as it is here related: though
I do not deny, but such Nails might be found, and, perhaps, stuck in
Constantines Helmet; and one of them was thrown into the Hadriatique Sea,
which has been the quieter ever since, never a whit: yet all this will not
make me believe, that the Feast of the Invention of the Cross, commonly called
Holy-roode day, took its original from this Judas Helena. That which I
infer out of all this long and tedious legendarie Story, (let the Papists
ecclesiasticate, and magnify it never so much) is, that there is no
certainty, either of the one, or of the other. Next, touching the parts and
parcels of the Virgin Mary's Sepulcher, I will not say, that these are as
certain as her assumption, or her houses transumption (both which are written
in the backside of my Creed:) but I will say confidently and peremptorily, that

now high time for us to leave them. But, perhaps, there may be a good constat
for the Apostles Relics. Nay, nay, they may go with the rest, the Disciples

of Heaven, and Empress of the whole World. But of these, Pol^dore Virgil said

Durham: and did we but peruse all the Reliquiaries in the World, how much more

in cousening men with a tale of Robin Hood, or of some hood or other of

they be truly contrite, for mis-giuing their lands from their wives and

provided that they give liberally to their Couents and Monasteries; No penny,

Story to this purpose in (...). I^^^^tan. (...) ^4^
Amatus Lusitanus worth the rehearsing: one Armellius, a rich man, fell sick,
but his sickness was not to death: the Friars of Saint Dominick and Francis
wished him (as their manner is) to commend his soul unto God, and a good part
of his goods unto them, that they might pray for his souls health, after he
was departed this world: but their meaning was, to prey upon his body being
alive, for they would have buried his body quick, that his body might have
taken possession of his grave, and they of his goods: but as God would have it,
in comes the Physician, who wondering at his sudden departure, makes trial,
and finds there was life in him, recouers him of his sickness; the man lived
many years after, and revoked his Legacy, to the no small grief of these
greedy Shauelings, who had lost such a booty. And therefore it was not without
cause, that Quod ass^rere erroneum est and impium. Er. in Dialogo qui E^n^s.
Erasmus was accounted an Heretic before he died, for writing so sharply
against their foolish Obites and Mortuaries, that were bought and sold for

Erasmus says out of Augustine, and has been formerly showed) Exequiarum pompa

Against adoration of Images.
BEfore we enter into the maine controversy about Adoration of Images, let us
enter some Creekes thereof, and then lauch forth into the deep; and as he that
goes about to fell a Tree, that is compassed with Thorns and Bushes at the
bottom, must first cut or grub up the bushes, that he may come at the tree:
so we will cut off certain nice and thorny distinctions, that we may the
more freely come to throw down this great tree of Images, which like Alex.
Oak, is grown now to adoration, and special worship. The distinctions are
three, between simulachrum and imago, a similitude or likeness of a thing; an
Idol, an Image; and latria and doulia. The Papists as much as we, condemn
the worshipping of Idols and simulachra, and all god-worship, or latria to
Images of men; but not the worship, or adoration of Images in a meaner sort,
called doulia, or in a greater, called latria, of the Images of God, either
alone, or in the Trinity, or of the Cross, or of our blessed Savior that
died upon the Cross, both God and Man.

But God willing, we will first avoid these niceties, and fooleries of
distinctions, out of their own Writers, and then erect and establish certain
propositions, whereunto the Papists must stand, unless they will thwart and
withstand some of the chiefest of their own Writers.

Lil Greg. Gyraldus.

Thus having cleared the passages, we purpose to make good these following
Propositions.

1. That Images were not used in the Primitive Church. 2. When they began to
come into use, and crept into Churches, they were only Laymens Remembrancers,
not their Idols, or worshipped of them. 3. That when they began to be
worshipped (as Idolatry comes in step by step) Images of the Trinity or of
God the Father, were never generally received, but mostly misliked of the
Church. 4. Adoration of Images crosses Scripture. 5. Repugneth to reason. 6.
And is very much impugned by the Papists themselves of the better sort.
The First Proposition.
Images were not used in the Primitive Church.
IF Agobardus Works, and especially his de Picturis, with Papyrius Massenius
notes, and Desiderius Heraldus annotations upon Arnobius, be not satisfying in
this point, we shall be constrained to have recourse to the Writings of the
Fathers, and the Histories of the Church: out of both which, it will appear as
clear, as the Sunshine at Noonday, that the Prime-Christians could say
confidently, that they had no Altars, no Images nor Statuaes: making Images the
badge or cognizance to know the Christian from the Gentill; and who knows not
that memorable History of Epiphanius, recorded by Saint Hierome? Which Epistle
you have labored what you can to discredit, and when you could not do that,
you fell foul upon some few Notes of Notati ab Epiphanio propter Imagines*
Eras. in seh. Apol. aduers^^ Rusticum, p. 251. ^^. 5.
Erasmus, that declared the same. A poor revenge: but that Epistle and the
truth thereof does stand, and your doctrine of Images must needs fall, unless
it have better proppes to maintain it, then I see in this first Proposition.

The Second Proposition.
When Images came into the Church, they were placed in their Temples for
rememoration, and not for adoration.
THe Proposition is so notorious and famous out of Gregory's Epistle to Serenus
of Masseils, that you were best blot out that Epistle, and coin a doctrine
clean contrary to this, and clap it to some Epistle or other. And doubtless
(as you are cunning gamesters, that can help your selves at a need) ye have
played your parts very cunningly on both sides. Saint Gregory in his ninth
book and ninth Epistle to Serenus, Bishop of Marseils, blames him for being
so inconsiderate, as to break certain Images that were offensive, by reason
of the peoples worshipping them. He says; Antiquity knew of the painting of
Saints Stories in places where men did worship God; although they did not
worship pictures as gods, or as men. I reverence S. Gregory as much as any
man, having perused his works as much as some others have done, and compared
him with the Manuscript Copies which (under correction) I take to be the best
reading of him, or any other Greek or Latin Author. But these words, quia in
locis venerabilibus Sanctorum depingi Historias non sine ratione admisit vetust
as; he says but admisit, permitted them to be painted; and yet I can
scarsely believe them, because Epiphanius that lived some hundreds of years
before Saint Gregory, rent the Veil in the Church: Was he inconsiderato zelo
succensus, when he did it? Who dares say it? And both Tho. Bradwardine, our
profound Doctor, and the Council of Basil, have taught me how to distinguish
between auctorities and auctorities, the former and the latter: and whereas it
may be objected for proof hereof, that the Picture of our Savior was
miraculously depaynted in the Lateran Church, as says Imago Saluatoria
miraculose depicta in pariete Lateranensis Ecclesiae si recte sentiunt qui haec
scribunt. Geo. Ven. to. 2. Probl. sect. 6 Problem* 272.
Geo. Venetus, take that which follows; Sirecte sentiunt qui haec scribunt;
if that be true which is written of it. But to reuer^ to my purpose: How does
this doctrine of Gregory's, that Images may be, but may not be worshipped,
agree with that which went before in the seventh book of Greg. Register.
Indict. 2. ep. 54. to Secundinus? The words come not in by way of a Postscript,
Sic esse oportet; but they come in, or rather are thrust in the perclose of
that long Epistle by head and ears. The Images (says this false Gregory)
which you sent for unto me by Dulcidius the Deacon, I have taken care to be
conveyed unto you. And it was no small pleasure unto me, to see by this your
lively and earnest affection to contemplate him, whose Image you desired to
have before your bodily eyes, that seeing his picture, you might the better
imprint him in your imagination. And verily it is not amiss done of us, then
to demonstrate invisible things by visible. Just so a man that loves and
longs to see his friend, or a man that truly loves his wife, makes all the
haste he can, to see, the husband his wife, the man his friend, coming from
the Church or the Bath, and does both meet them some part of the way, and
rejoice with exceeding great joy. I perceive by this, that you are much
inflamed with the love of your Savior, because you have such a longing after
his Image. And yet I would not have you to conceive, that we are so gross, as
to worship the Image as a god: no, no; we worship God by the Image, who was
crucified, dead and buried, and now sits at the right hand of God, as we are
well taught in the Creed. For whilst the outward picture, or Scripture,
represents the Image to our bodily eyes, the eyes of our minds take great
comfort in his glorious Resurrection and blessed Passion. In consideration
whereof, we have caused to be sent unto you two sultaries or tables, wherein
are painted the Images of God the Savior, and of the blessed Virgin, the
Mother of God, and of the blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul, by our foresaid
son and Deacon. You shall likewise receive a Cross and a Key, that has been
hallowed upon the body of S. Peter, the chief of the Apostles, that being thus
crossed, and thus keyed, you may be sufficiently defended from all evil. Now
let us rest a while, and be think our selves; first, for the time: It was
written a year or two before the other to Serenus; and if this better had been
true, Gregory had good cause indeed to find fault with his inconsiderate
rashness, that would offer to touch, much more to betrample and break such
precious Relics* but Gregory distinguishes adoration from rememoration; and
at the most, he makes Images but Laymens books: but this Secundinus, to whom
he writes is a servant of God, an Incluse, or Recluse: and last of all, I must
be bold to tell you this, that this Epistle is not found in any of our ancient
Manuscripts, save Out of a ^^anus^^^^t book of Epistles in All-Soules Colle^ge.
one, that cites it not out of Gregory, but as Sententia Gregorii P^excerp^a
de Decretis Canonum.
Gregory's sentence, or Gregory's opinion taken out of the Decrees of Canons.
So then, if Dominicus Basa, or the Cardinals deputed for the reuising and
printing of the Fathers out of the Vatican Print, were so bold as to mend
Gregory out of Gratian, or the Decrees; I say under correction, they were more
bold then wise, and we are like to have the Fathers Works well amended, that
are reuised after this manner. Again, it must be duly considered, that Gregory
in the Manuscripts, wrote fourteen books of Epistles, distributed and ranked
according to the years that he sat Pope: but you have confounded the
Epistles, and made but twelve books (wherein notwithstanding, there is hysteron
proteron I know not how often) so that the story of things is much obscured
thereby. Howsoever, either Gregory does contradict that in the ninth book, and
ninth Epistle, which he had formerly said in his seventh book, touching the
use and adoration of Images: but the truth is, this is a patched Epistle, and
it appears out of the Gospel, that a new piece put to an old garment, will
make the rent worse. I conclude this Proposition out of learned Papists words:
To use Images for adoration and worship, were to abuse Contra vetustam
Ecclesiae disc^plinam non ad ^dorationem, sed ad memoriam and recordationem
Tucc. Tucc. in Cant. p 342.
them, cross to the discipline of the ancient Church: for a memorial or
remembrance of the Saints by them, we may lawfully use them: or if we needs
must fall to adoration of Saints, let us either Op i am colunt diuos qui vitam
illorum studen^ in^i^ar^ Er. to. 9. p. 366.
imitate their virtues, which is the best kind of worshipping them: as for
reverence to mute Images, the true Church Non muta simulachra sed viuae Dei
imagines. Aug. Thuan. l. 28. page 77.
asknowledgeth none, but the lively Images of God: And so an end of this
Proposition.

The third Proposition.
It is not lawful to paint the Images of the Trinity, or of God the Father,
etc.
I Say, it is not only unlawful, but also impossible; cui me assimilastus?
yet you (as if you had better eyes then other men, or had been snatched up with
Saint Paul, into the upper Heaven, and taken full view of the glorious Majesty
of God) have taken upon you to paint God with three faces, as notes a good

Historian. I know, there be some quaint and Polite Missals extant in the

Library, that have shaped them otherwise. Pictoribus atque Poet is quidlibet
audendi semper fuit aequa potestas. And your own dear Polydore yields the
self same reason; Cum Deum v^ perhibet Ioannes, vidisset nemo vnquam, quam ei
formam dabimus? Polyd* Virg. lib. de Inn ^^^um 6. c. 13. page 424.
If no man ever saw God, how shall we be able to make any representation of
him? Therefore we may safely conclude this third Proposition; Painting of God
the Father, or of the Trinity, was never generally received of the Church of
God.

The fourth Proposition.
Adoration of Images crosses the Scripture.
LEt Polydore Virgil speak for all the rest: God Almighty gave certain Laws
and Precepts to be kept of the Jews: our blessed Savior confirms them in
the new Testament. If thou will come unto everlasting life, keep the
Commandments, the chief whereof is, Worship only one God, that is, [ Nullius
animalis effig^em co^^^* Polyd. Virg. l. 5. c. 9. page 348.
worship not the similitude or likeness of any created creature.] What can be
spoken more plain, or to the purpose?

The fifth Proposition.
It is repugnant to Reason.
IF Si fabrum ado^are erubescis, quod faber fecit non erubescis* MS. 28 p. ^7.
we be ashamed to worship the Carpenter that made these images, should we not
in reason be ashamed to worship the images that are made by them? Again, is
it not unreasonable, that being forwarned by Salomons De Idolis a Salomona

children, beware of Idols.

Against the Invocation of Saints.
THis controversy of the Invocation of Saints, to go at large, may be reduced
unto two propositions, whereunto the best of the Papists have willingly
subscribed. The Propositions are these:

First, God alone is to be worshipped, adored and inuocated. Secondly, The
Saints neither may, can, nor will be inuocated of us, but with impiety, and no
profit.

perhaps, would, but cannot; God is both able and willing. And thus this first
Proposition stands like a Rock, immovable against all the assaults and
batteries of our Adversaries.

Saints neither will, nor can be inuocated of us.

so much unto invocation of Saints, and so little unto the service of God.

The 25. Article.
Penance is no Sacrament.
PEnance is one of the seven Sacraments, say the Papists; it is no Sacrament,
says the Church of England. Facilius est dicecre quid non sit, qua^^ quid sit.
Ci^. de natura deo^^^.
It is easier to say what it is not, then what it is. But I will not greatly
stand with them for a Sacrament, upon hope of better agreement in other matters
of greater consequence: take it strictly, it is no Sacrament, (they have better
eyes then I, if they can see more Sacraments then two in the Gospel;) take it
largely, it may pass well enough for a Sacrament, such a one as it is: and to
gratify the Papists, if the number of seven be so grateful unto them, I will
help them unto seven times seven Sacraments, upon reasonable conditions, out
of Saint Austen.

It is called Er to. 6. annos. in c. 3. Math.
metanoea, or resipiscentia in Latin, and as I take it, repentance in English:
but this word, repentance, or resipiscentia, is so dreadful a word to the
Church of Rome, that there is Hue and Cry made after it; and having apprehended
it, they have condemned it to perpetual silence; it must never be mentioned
again, they have purged it out of their See Ferus in Io. c. 3. p. 92. Rayn.

books, I would to God they were as well purged out of this Kingdom. I will

quotations. They divide it into Laur Valla* denies the division, as not
agreeable with Saint Paul's doctrine. In Ep. 1 ad Cor. c 7. page 272.
three parts, into Confession, Contrition, and Satisfaction; how wisely, we
shall see hereafter. Their penance consists in outward affliction of the
body, and maceration of the flesh: our Interna paenitentia sufficit Ant. de

attrite, or contrite (for I have learned to make no division of these two
terms; your Schools do.) This affected and feigned penance may make others
believe, that we are truly sorrowful, when there is no such thing We do herein
but imitate the old Heretics, against whom Lib. 7 de I^uent. c. 6. p. 467*
Polydor Virgil, and In Balliol Collan Oxford, MS.
Aegidius de Faeno, have sharpened their pens against them: our foolish
Papists on Good Friday, either in Rome or Spain, come not much behind them,
and (if they belie them not that have reported it,) some of them have died
under the displing Rod. But true repentance enters not into the body with the
Rod; but into the mind by true sorrow, the fear whereof is so continually
obuersant before their eyes, that they will not Id quod male perpetratum est
etiamsi moriendum esset nunquam perpetrare tur. Faber in Luc. 1. 17. p. 440.
commit the like sins, and it were to loose a hundred lives; they do clean
put off the old man, and all the Vera poenitentia non est amplius eisdem
affectibus obnoxium deprehendi. Sermon. 17. Ant. Magni, Bb. Pp. to. 1. col. 139.
affections of a sinful soul, with mind never to resume them again. And this
I take to belong unto true repentance.

Against Auricular confession.
IF auricular, or secret confession be not abused, the Church of England does
willingly admit of, and subscribe to it: the neglect of it has been inquired
of my knowledge, in some Visitations; and the revealing of it, is forbidden
under an high pain: but this must not be imposed of necessity, but arbitrarie
and voluntary. The sick Penitent may say unto the Confessor, I have need of
the Physician; and the Confessor may reioyne unto the Penitent, Non habeo
praeceptum sed consilium do: I urge it not upon you as a precept, but I advise
you as a friend, and as your spiritual Pastor; and if you be truly contrite
(God sees your heart, I see but your face) you may receive comfort at Gods
hands, and I will join my heartiest prayers with yours, for the obtaining of
the same. Man is sinful, but God is merciful.

To consider Confession a little better, it is a most forceable weapon, to
amaze and amate the conscience, to pick the purse, and steal into a man's
priuiest thoughts, intruding here upon Gods office; it makes the Confessor
(especially if he be a young man) a knave, women whores, and their husbands
Cuckolds: Subjects rebel against their Princes, works Stratagems in States:
to be short, it serves (to my seeming) but to Politic ends, and in special,
it tyeth the Laytie fast by the ears to the Clergy, and the Clergy to the
Pope, which thereby is become, Rex Regum, et Dominus Dominantium.

Touching the first part of this description, how is the pore conscience racked
and torn, vexed and perplexed amongst them? They require an exact Catalogue
and enumeration of all sins, and all circumstances. I think it to be
Impossible esse omnia peccata confiteri. * p. 3.
an endless work, for who can say, how often he offends? It is Con^. Trid.

impossible so strictly to take the Confession of an ordinary man for one
year, much more of a great sinner for many years: But admit it to be

balance to make difference of every grain, to weigh every circumstance; is
not this a trouble and vexation of the spirit? Nay a very hell and torment of
the conscience. Sure, Non disquisitio criminum exacta: tantum credat sibi per
Christum remissa esse peccata et si non confiteatur eadem speciaius* Cone*
Colons ease in Tr. de sacraum. Consess.. Quod si p. 148.
there needs no such matter: may it not suffice to believe assuredly, that my
sins are forgiven in Christ, though I confess them not to a sinful Priest,
it may be as bad, perhaps worse than my self? I believe it will be found in
good writers, that before the Priusquam Confessio ad os venit, Deus peccata
dimitt ^. Er. in Ind. Aug.
mouth opens, the heart speaks, and sigheth and cries unto God for mercy,
and great is the cry thereof in Gods ears; of force (if I may so say) being
tendered to God in Christ Jesus name, to pull down a full remission of all our
sins.

Secondly, it is said to be a Pick-pocket, as well as Purgatory, because of
the infinite sums of money, that accrue to the ^u. de S. Amor^. MS.
Monks Couents by way of Legacies, and to the Popes Coffers by way of
Indulgeuces. I may call it in this respect the Popes Indies, as well as
Confessio illis aurifodinae. Krantz. metrop. l. 8. c. 42. p. 195,
Krantzius terms it the Popes golden mines. I trow the Pope gets as much
by it, as the King of Spain by both his Indies.

Thirdly, it solliciteth and tempts Priests to much lewdness, and therefore
it was thought good by some of their best learned Papists, that young Priests
should not intermedle ^u^enibus quibuslibet committitur, praefecti adolescentes
inepti et stulti, plerumque mali et petulantes. Rh^n* in T^^^ull.
in Confessions: and yet who but they that were used in Confessions, ignorant
and foolish, lewd and lascivious as they were? It is not I, but good Rhenanus,
that complains of this grievous abuse. And therefore our learned Countryman,
long before this complaint, gave this wholesome advise, That neither young nor
old, Cauendum vel in Confessione vel ob aliam causa loqui cum mulieribus, cum
omnes homines quantum cunque sanctos species fortes plurimum turbam. Rog Bacon
MS. in op^^e mino^^. p. 28.
familiar themselves, or talk with women; because there is no man, but might
be entangled with these snares, if he looked not the better, or more warily to
his steps. And therefore there was great need of some such advise. For (as
Poggius* says in his merry tales) there was an Eremite at Padua, Quot mulieres
Eremita Paduae Arsininus nomine per Confessionis speciem ad concubitum
pellexit. Pogg. in fac^tiis. apud Zuing. p. 2283.
one Arsininus by name, that had sosticited I know not how many women to
lewdness, under pretense of Auricular Confession. If you list to hear any
more Stories of this nature, you shall have them as freely as I have them from
Zuinger, and Zuinger from Egnatius and others: as out of the same Poggius, you
may read of a Monk called Albertus, Pogg. apud. Zuing p. 1941. out of Egnatius
l. 1. c. 3.
that came in Confession to a grave matron of Venice, and had the use of her
body, telling her when she began to make somewhat dainty of the matter, that
he had a revelation from Saint Michael the Archangell, which commanded him to
come to her, of else God forbid, that we should think that a poor minorite
would have attempted any such matter, before he had his warrant. There is a
third story, of an other minorite, that lay with an other matron-like woman,
which left his breaches behind him, being like to be surprised; and her
husband Zuing. ex Pogg. p. 1990.
espying the breeches on the bed, asked how they came there, she said they were
sent her by God, and good Saint Francis: the poor Cuck old rested contented,
and durst not for his ears, for a long time make this story known. Now honest
Papist, is Confession a Sacrament or no? Take Sacrament for a sign, and it
appears that it is a sign, or rathere cause of much villainy; and this was
the cause why it was abolished in the Primitive Church, upon a like fact by
Nectarius. What shall I speak of other Confessions? As the Confessions in a
Er. to 9.
Monks Cowle, which was of Sovereign virtue to cure all sicknesses of the
soul: Monks Cowles belike have a special virtue. If they had said they were
good to cure Matrons of the disease of the mother, or Maids of the green
sickness, I would easilier have believed them. I am afraid, I have rested too
long upon their Monks Cowles: but it is no matter, Non arbitror periclitari
fidem si quis quid iocetur in cu^ullum alicuius Dominicani. Er. To. 9. ad
Declarat. 48.
Erasmus shall make my excuse for this once; the best is, it is not a matter of
faith, nor much against good manners, unless it be of their side. In this ^.
Tome, and elsewhere, he has given them such a cooling card for their Cowles
(let them be Cowles of S. Francis, or S. Dominicke) that the Papists will have
no great cause to brag of their Sovereign virtues hereafter. To hold you no
longer about Confession, seeing Lib. 6. c. 1. p. 373.
Confession is not of any divine institution, but an ordinance of the Church
(as both Polydore Virgil, and Er. To. 9. p. 106.
Erasmus, do prove it; but instituted by the Fathers upon just occasion, and
abrogated Er. To. 2. p. 865.
again by the same upon as good an occasion: The s Er. in Dialogqus
inscri^itur pictas puerilis. Rhen in Tertull Chrysostom. in Indice.
surest way for us is, to make our humble and secret Confession to God, who is
best able to forgive the same, and to free us both a paena, et a culpa: yet
Seruandam esse ob auctoritatem Ecclesiae Er Ib.
for the authority of the Church of England, that persuades is leaving it
Arbitrarie, and for sundry good reasons that enforce it (to my seeming) if thou
can be so happy, as to find a wise, learned, and discreet Minister, fear
not to make known thy sins unto him; there is no ragge of popery in this, if
thou be true to the Minister, and the Minister unto thee: But if no such
Minister be to be found, or not at hand, men may confess Proximo facienda
est si non ad sit Sacerdos Er. in Ind Chrysostom. et MS. * p. 220. Laicus admittitur

themselves one to another, one neighbor to another, without any scruple of
conscience: the Papists will give thee leave, and so do I, and here I end my
discourse of Auricular Confession.

Of Satisfaction and Contrition.
A Word or two of Satisfaction and Contrition, the other two parts of Popish
Penance, that I may give some satisfaction to my pore seduced Countrymen, if
God shall move their hearts, and that they hate not to be reformed: otherwise,
whole books of this argument will be bootlesse, non persuadebo etiam
perswasero: I may plant, and others may water, but it is God only that gives
the increase.

First, of Satisfaction: if the Papists mean public Satisfaction to the
Church, for some public scandal given; or private Satisfaction, for some
private wrongs done, or scandal taken; God speed them, I question them not: it
is a Canon of the Church of Rome, in force and practice in the Church of
England; that he that offends Dicit Canon, qui public peccat public
paeniteat. MS. o. p. 96.
publicly, and by his offense does scandalize the whole Church, should make a
public acknowledgement thereof; and for private wrongs, or persons, the holy
Scripture, which is regula sufficien^isfima, wills us in express terms, to
go and reconcile our selves unto our neighbor, and then come and offer: this
is a kind of Excommunication, ipso facto, if we do it not: But if they mean
Popish Satisfactions, whereby they think they do promerite, or postmerite God:
with such satisfactions or sacrifices God is not pleased: Prove the lawfulness
of them out of Scripture, and Traditions of the Church, and we will use them;
till when, we leave them. In the mean time, there is a kind of Satisfaction,
which I will make bold to commend unto you, out of Antonius Magnus, Vitae
emendatio vera. Ant. Magnus. Bb. Pp. To. 1. Sermon. 16. Col. 123.
in the Bibliotheque of holy Fathers; and that is, the amendment of your wicked
lives.

Touching Contrition, seeing that the Papists acknowledge, that the heart Tanta
potest esse cordis Contritio licet non egerit paenitentiam iniunctam, quod
immunis erit ab igne Purgatorio. MS. 51 p 96. Quod et culpa deletur per gratiam
et paena tollitur per modicam paenitentiam. MS. o. p. 396.
may be so contrite, that the body may be saved in the day of judgment, both
apaena, et a culpa, without doing any penance at all, or very little; Sola
delet Peccata nostra. Ant. de Dom. l. 5. c. 7.. 20.
grace being sufficient of it self, to do away all our sins (as is largely
showed by Ant. de Dominis, who has also taken great pains, to score up the
Errors of Popish Contrition) the chief whereof is filthy gain, the bane of
the soul, and individual companion of Purgatory and Penance: be ruled by me
this once; if your Confessor seek you, and not yours, he will persuade you
truly to repent, and sorrow, and satisfy God if you will, by your surety
Christ: if they speak of any other sorrow, or any other satisfaction, take
heed of Wolves, that destroy the flock, MS. 51. p. 68.
ne potius pecuniam quam animarum salutem quaerere videantur, they rob you of
your money, and give no satisfaction to your hunger-starued souls.

The 20. Article.
Of the Authority of the Church.
THe Church has power to decree rites or Ceremonies, and authority in
Controversies of faith: And yet it is not lawful for the Church, to ordain
any thing that is contrary to Gods word; neither may it so expound one place of
Scripture, that it be repugnant to another. Wherefore, though the Church be a
witness and a keeper of holy writ; yet it ought not to decree any thing
against the same: so besides the same it ought not to enforce any thing to be
believed, for necessity of salvation.

This 20. Article explained and maintained by the Papists.
IT is a true saying, of good use in opening of Controversies, that qui been
distinguit, been docet. I will therefore for the better understanding of this
point. First, distinguish of Rites, Ceremonies, and Traditions. Secondly,
propose certain Theses. Thirdly, confirm them according to the method which I
have confined my self unto; either out of Papists, or out of old Manuscripts.

Of Traditions, Rites, and Ceremonies, as I take it from the Papists, some are
divine, appertaining to piety, perpetual and immutable.

Some are humane, of the Tradition of the Church, for the better government and
policy of the same, which are variable and mutable, both in regard of time and
of place.

Thirdly, there are some infrugiferous, carnal, hypocritical, or
Pharisaicall, and these are never to be admitted, or being once admitted by
conniuence of governors, or the industry of the Devil (that will if he may,
sow Tares amongst Wheat) must be speedily rooted out and abrogated.

My Propositions are these.
1. Divine Rites or Ceremonies, must be taken out of the word of God, or the
continual succession of the Church. 2. All Apostolical Rites are not
perpetual. 3. Humane Rites and Ceremonies, may be made by the Church
according to the Scripture; are of like observation, even in things
indifferent, if they be once ratified, till the Church do abrogate them. 4.
They must be thus conditioned. First, not merely offensive for their
multitude. Secondly, mysterious for their signification. Thirdly, decent for
the ornament of the Church. Fourthly, tending to piety, and not superstition.
Fifthly, putting no affiance or confidence in them. Sixthly, not lasting, but
Arbitrary, according unto the times Countries and seasons. 5. The Primitive
Churches had but a few. 6. All Jewish Ceremonies are abolished. 7. Divine
Constitutions, are to be preferred before humane inventions, pure, and without
mixture. 8. Humane Rites, must as near as may be, consist in inward, and not
external matters, as well for the end, as for the thing. 9. If Ceremonies do
offend, or otherwise be to be abrogated, it is not for any private man to
demolish them: but they must fairly and orderly be unmade by the Authority of
the Church, that first made them. 10. As they are to be severely punished, that
contemn the settled orders of the Church; so if there be no contempt, we are
not rashly to censure them.
The first Proposition.
SVch Traditions Quod immueabile aut de Scripturis traditu^^.
as are mentioned in the Scriptures, and have been observed in all ages by a
continual succession; aut extraditione Apostolorum percontinuas success* ad

perpetual observation for the most part: yet some things Non omnia quae ab
Apostolis in perpetuam obligant. Fr. To. 9.
commanded by the Apostles, as unction by S. James, do not oblige us for ever:
which is my second Proposition.

The Third Proposition.
HVmane Rites and Ceremonies may be made by the Church, according to the
Scripture, to be observed alikely, even in things indifferent, if they be
once ratified, till the Church do abrogate them.

I call them humane Rites and Ceremonies, because they are instituted by men,
for the good of men; but otherwise they are to be observed with care and
reverence, though they be not directly contained, yet they are virtually to be
deducted out of the Scriptures; and it is not Non cuivis permittatur vt

authority, or Clergy in Council do meet and abrogate them.

must be observed, if the Church command them; but we must take heed we place
no superstition in them: we must seek after those things rather which are
inward.

5. Damno superstitiosam fiduciam. Eras to. 6. in c. 24. Math. In his non

Constitutions are to be preferred before Humane: they must be pure without
mixture. The neglect hereof was complained of by diverse * u Si quis
constitutiones humanas non doceret, quas aeque si non etiam arctius custodiri
vellent ad mandarunt atque diuinas. Iac. Faber. in Mat. c. 15. p. 114.

and violaters of Gods Laws; so that small Minora peccata puniuntur neglectis

faults (as the neglect of their Feasts, or omissions of their Fasts) were
punished with Scorpions; but greater sins, as their Priests ^ippling and
whoring it in the Stews, were let pass with a gentle correction. See the

ones, as Hierome sometimes spoke upon the like occasion, Who Traditionum bona

and madding after these toys and fopperies, as Erasmus knew by woeful
experience in the Countries where he lived?

The ninth Proposition.
THough Ceremonies be to be misliked, and prove distastefull to the Church;
yet it is for no private man to disturb the settled peace and quiet order of
the same, but to expect the Kings prohibition either by himself or his
Clergy. I am thus opinioned of Ceremonies, that they may be corrupted with
the Veteris fermenti. Faber in Lucam. p. 362.

Faciat Jesus vt cito purgentur, God send we may be well rid of them, making
prayers, and no stirs, tumults or commotions; when Non cuiuis permittitur vt

Ecclesiam tollerentur, Erasmus, tom. 9. Declarat. 40 etc.
all is done, the Churches censure, or the Princes commandment; or rather the
Churches censure by command of the Prince, is to be attended: no phlegmaticall
schismatic is to have a hand in this business, though it be to pull down
Images out of Churches, or Pictures out of windows; for this were to open a
window to private men's fancies, rather then zeal; and comes near to the
error of the Eiconoclasts, which in this case may be justly censured: Leave we
this to Leo Isaurus, and other Emperors.

The tenth Proposition.
AS they are to be severely punished, that contemn the settled orders of the
Church; so if there be no contempt of public Government, we are not rashly
to censure them.

In Dialogo qui dicitur pietas Puerilis.
Grave non est transgredi (as one writes) constitutiones Ecclesiae, nisi
accedat contemptus malitiosus; A man may transgress the orders of the Church
happly out of error, it may be of ignorance: but disobedience and contempt is
as the sin of Witchcraft, a most heinous sin, as all those take it, that
have not their shoes made at Geneua: otherwise if there be weakness in them,
let there be charity in us, and there will be Non cemere alii iudicandi
propter transgressiones. Fer. in c. 15. Math. p. 207.
no rash Judges left in the Land. And thus far of Rites and Ceremonies; and
if I be in the right, I shall be glad; if otherwise, blame the Papists, and
not me, and let the perclose of this Discourse be my sufficient Apology.

The 28. Article.
Of the Lords Supper.
I Will take out of this Article as much as is in controversy between us and
the Papists.

Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in the
Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ, but is repugnant to the
plain words of Scripture; overthrows the nature of a Sacrament, and has
given occasion to many superstitions. The body of Christ is given, taken, and
eaten, in the holy Scripture, only after an heavenly manner; and the mean
whereby the body of Christ is received, and eaten in the Supper, is Faith, etc.

The 28. Article maintained, and explained by the Papists.
THe Papists in the Council of Trent make it a Sacrifice both for the living
and the dead. Admit it be a sacrifice (which cannot be well denied, being well
understood;) yet Sacrifi^ium non exp^atorium aut satisfactorium sed
rememoratiuum. Iac. Schopp^run^ Conc. 23. de M^s^.
is it neither satisfactorie, nor expiatorie, but rememoratiue; so Schoepperus:
that is, Eucharistia non est sacrificium: sed sacrificii memoria. Er. in Ind.
Aug,
not properly a Sacrifice, but a memorial of a sacrifice, so Erasmus. Arias
Montanus gives the reason of both: Neque enim nos illud Sacrificium off^rimu^,
sed illud referimus incruento (vt dicitur) modo ^epetimus id, quod Christus
cruentum obtulit. Ar. Mont in Isaiam, cap. 1. p. 43.
For we do not offer that Sacrifice again; but proffer, and represent it to
the memory after an unbloody manner, which was offered up once in blood; a
Sacrifice, without Materiae expers sacrificium. Cyril^ Bb. Pp. 10. 1. p. 147.
the matter of a sacrifice, to speak in Cyrils terms. Neither will it avail
the Papists, to say, that M^lchisedec qui primus sacrificauit, and Abraliam,
Isaac and Jacob, qui sec^^dum eum ^tidem fecerunt. Se^ illos quadam naturali
p^etate, non sacerdotali auctoritate rem diuinam fecisse constat Polyd.
Virgil^d: I^uent^rerum, l. 4 c. 5. p. 253.
Melchisedec sacrificed, (for he was a Priest of the Highest,) for he
sacrificed no otherwise then Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, which herein imitated
him: [For of them we have a plain constat, that they did not sacrifice by any
Priestly authority, but moved with a natural deuotion] as writes Polydor
Virgil. And Mel^his^dec cibat Abraham. Vat-in c. 14 in Genesis nu. 1
Vatablus affirms of Melchisedec in special, that he relieved, or re^^eshed
Abraham's men, and so sacrificed not at all. Christ our blessed Savior, when he
gave the Bread, Corporis sui signum dedit Christus. Er. in A^^.
gave a sign of his Body, or type of his Typus corporis and sanguinis domini.

Romans have no other milk to feed their young ones, but Wolves milk.
Doubtless they have the disease, which the Physicians call Lycan^hropies, or
worse; for that turns men only into Wolves by conceit and imagination, but
these are Men-woolues really metamorphozed and translated into their wooluish
natures and ferity. Not to speak of another metamorphosis of theirs, whereby
the Church of Rome is turned altogether inside outside, into mere shows and
outward, and is altogether become merely hypocritical (as notes Lib. 5. c.

whether we can find any honesty, or goodness in that famous and renowned

were a fair riddance (as we say) without a Sessions. But I must leave to hold
you any longer; I know you stand upon thorns, and long to be gone to your holy
Father the Pope: I have done with their vices, and I would they had done with
them too; and so farewell.

Of the Clergy of Rome.
Having described the City of Rome, and showed our Romanists what wonderful
things are spoken of her; I will (if needs they will go to Rome)* give them
this counsel, to go their Stations as soon as they come thither, and as they
pass by, to view the state of their Clergy and Church in general, and then
of their Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, and Monks in particular: the knowledge
hereof may be profitable unto you; and yet not puff you up never a whit the
more.

First then of the Clergy in general.
HEre I must be bold to borrow a pen or two from their own Espencaeus upon
Titus, or from some one or other in the Council of B^^ MS. p. 334.
Basil: as for ink (if any be black enough to register the several
enormities and foulness of their facts,) I will borrow that from Thuan. hist.
l. 27. p 29.
Thuanus History; there will never be wanting Ink as black, and as bitter as
Gaul amongst Popish Writers, to supply our wants; and therefore upon full
trust and confidence hereof, as we shall see when we come to handle the
particulars, I come in this second place to speak of their Cardinal sins,
or the sins of their Cardinals; although I am not ignorant of Ant. de Dominis
saying, that a man were as good touch the apple of the Popes eye, as point out,
or point at their Popish or Romish errors: but that care is cared for, and so I
proceed.

Of the Cardinals and Bishops.
SOme call them Carpinales, in scossing manner, as Carpinales vocati a. Conrade
Mogunt. apud Zuing. p. 28* 4.
Conrade of Mentz: some on the contrary, praise them beyond the skies, and say,

when they die, they shall be sure to go to Heaven, and never go by the
Examiners office. Be it so* yet by their leaves we will make bold to examine
their lives, while they live here upon earth. First, for their original, it
cannot be precisely learned when they began. Wicelius says, they were
anciently instituted by the primitive Popes, (if the word Pope be so ancient)
to be aiding and assisting to his Holiness in visiting the sick, and burying
the dead. But I doubt they will not fall out to be of that antiquity; for in
Saint Cardinalis nomen Hier a^tate vix n^tum. Zuing. p. 13 15.
Hieromes time, the name of a Cardinal was hardly in request; and yet their
Writers or Painters, seeing Saint Hierome so poor in his Cell, of Rub^us

Council of Bas. Conc. MS. p. 363.
Basil has prevented my pains, in learning them their several duties, and
representing before their eyes their red Scarlet, which should teach them to be
Martyrs for, and not persecuters of the Christian Faith. A word or two of
Bishops, and so an end.

The word Nomen operis and non honoris. Conc. Bas^ MS. 2. p 455.
Bishop is a name of paiues, and not of honor; he is a Superintendant over the
flock; let not the Precisians appropriate this word unto themselves, or pare
it, as they do all things else to their purpose: but alas, now adays, men are
made Bishops (I speak of our Popish Clergy) for covetousness, and not for
righteousness sake: they inquire not how many Parishes belong to their
Diocessees; but how many Lordships, or rich Manors belong to their
Bishoprics: and so what Multi Episcopatum desiderant explendae auaritiae, and
libidinis suae causa, non quod communi vtilitari vt eorum exposcit officium and
nomen, consulan^. Quaeritur enim quantum in redditibus habeat Episcopatus, non
quot oues pascuae in eo sunt. Platina apud Wolf. to. 1. ^ p. 185.
for fulfilling their lusts, and filling full their purses, and other
by-respects, men affect, or rather infect the Bishopric, as a good Writer
notes. And therefore we may very justly complain with Erasmus, that Nulli
minus Episcopi, quam qui inter Episcopos primas tenent. Eras. to. 2. Adag. 1.
C^nt. 3 p, 603.
those which have the best Bishoprics, are not always the best men. Mostly
Bishops now adays (I speak thus much out of the mouths, and from the
complaints of two famous Writers in those impurer times, Plerique sunt nostri
temporis a religione and sacris quam quiuis Satrapae and prophani Principes
long alieniores Fr. Duarenus lib. 1 c. 4. p. 440.
Fr. Duarenus, and (Vneimus) ad hae^ ^empora, quibus nihil minus norunt quam
eas parts quae illis a Paulo assignantur. Isid. in 1. Tim 3.
Isidorus Clarius) are more ignorant of true Religion, and sacred businesses,
then Lay-Princes and Potentates; and do know any thing, save that which they
should know, that is, their duties out of Saint Paul's doctrine contained in his
Epistles to Timothy and Titus. I conclude this point; Let him that has a
Bishopric attend his office, attend his function, attend his name; he is
called a Bishop, an Ouer-looker, or a Superintendant. (I know no harm by this
word, as I told you before,) his office is not Episcopi nomen officium, non
Simonia. Viues in Eras. l. 19. c. 19.
Simonie, but to visit his Diocese, to preach to his flock. If you cannot,

Council of Basil. And so much for Bishops and Cardinals, their sins and
failings, their office and duties.

Of Popish Priests.
I Have touched the Popes freehold, laid open the faults of their Cardinals
and Bishops; What remains? Nondum completae sunt iniquitates Amorrhaeorum;
but that in like manner, and that without any great order (which their vices
will not bear) we proceed to speak of the intolerable abuses, and
innumerable sins of the Antichristian Roman Clergy, that we may have a
complete mystery of iniquity.

Of the Priests.
HEre for breuities sake, let me entreat thee gentle Reader, whosoever thou
art, to name me any sin, wherein the Priest has not bin Superlatiue. They
are Priests with a witness: before all other men, verum est, in sinning. Will
you have ordinary sins, or extraordinary; profane vices, or Clergie-faults?
For me, it is all one, and it were well with them, if one were all: but I may
number them unto you almost by the dozens.

one, that durst exclaim it, that in his time there was no punishment of
Adultery, and therefore less hope was there of censuring lighter sins, if
greater sins escape without your punishment; What reason have we to think,
that you should punish the lesser? And in truth, as one of your own side has
told me (as great a Erasmus to. 9. p. 306 Si omnes adulterae lapidarentur, to
us mons Ollariae non sufficeret.
Scholar, and as wise a man, as any the Church of Rome sent forth these many
days,) the greatest Hill of Ollaria (which I suppose to be a great one) would
not yield us stories enough, if the Leuiticall Law should take hold of all your
secret and open, known and unknown Adulteries. But that the World may know
how severe censors you are of this fault, hearken to a Story or two in this
kind, and I will end this Discourse.

Quidam Archiepiscopus Clericum saum tam incorrigibiliter in sanientem cum
adultera inclusit in cella, and omnia per multos dies caute fecit ministrari,
sed nec die, nec nocte eos ox^re permisit, nec ab invicem seperari. Cum^gitur
per multos dies enim cautionem, Iurator^am se nunquam in amplexus illius
mulieris reuersurum, and ita quodam modo Sathana Sathanam expellente ab insania
sua curatus est. MS O. p. 165.
There was a good fellow in the world (a Priest I mean) that had a woman in a
cellar with him, which he loved full sorely; his Prelate hearing of this,
comes upon them on the sudden, locks the doors, and shuts them in many
days, and many nights, causing them to be watched, and supplied with all
manner of necessaries, and in the end the poor Priest had so ouer-laboured and
spent himself, that he was taken with a giddiness in his head, so that he
never after durst come in her company any more. Believe it who list: If they
had said, he had never been well after this, and no more, I would have believed
them.

I have two Stories behind, which I will shut up in one s Curand um est tale
vitium non solum per castigationem and increpationem and communicationem, sed
per medicinalem cautelam Vnde quidam Episcopus cum habere^ quendam Clericum

word; they both loved Wenches well; the one was sent purposely to the Court of
Rome, the s other sued here in Alter Episcopus in consimili casan impetrabat a

England, both of set purpose, to make them forget their old loves: now could
my Author have showed me that there had bin no Stews in Rome at that time,
nor Brothelhouses in London, I would have in part believed his report of both:
but transeat cum caeteris erroribus; I proceed from the Daughter to the Mother;
from the cause, to the effect: you know, and Neuizanus has told us, that
Venture and genitalia are near of kind, I will not English this for shame.

4. They are very riotous in fare, mere Belly-god^, and Epicures. If either
you had patience, or I had leisure, ^ could insist upon this point as long, as
upon the former: it shall suffice therefore to show you, that he that serves
God Bacchus, is no great enemy to the Lady Venus; and he that is Potatores

p^tator, a drunkard, may be scortator, a whoremaster, before he be aware; they
are terms almost conuertible, per luxam and otium ventri viuunt; I say no more.

5. They are Prodigals and spendthrifts; and that they spent were their own,
or not mispe^t upon wicked purposes, and lewd l^uswiues, the fault might be
lessened, though not clean taken away: but Miseremini ^^^^ ^^op^^r m^^^ co^^^

6. Ambitious, no men more; neither sought they their Benefices to do good
with them, Viues in to 5. Aug. l ^7 c. 5.
but propter quaestum, to make a gain of them, or a ^adder for their ambitious
thoughts to mount up; and this ^adder, because it should carry them up higher,

not so much to profit their inferiors, as to sit amongst their superiors in
high place and dignity, in great honor and worship: and this was the true
cause, why Benefices were so chopped and changed, bought and sold, as if the
Church were an Sacerdotia quasi caballi empta. Io. Auent. Annal. Beior. l. 4 p.
382.
Horse-faire.

7. They are egregious Simoniasts: but of this nothing, having launced this
soar before in the Chapter of Rome, and, I doubt, it is not healed yet.

8. They are as proud as Lucifer. This vice is common to them with their
Pontificum Episcoporum Presbyterourm Sacerdotum superbissima tecta aulae, equi,
non dicam scorta and vilissima mancipia. Andt. Mas in Iosue ^ 7. p 128.
Bishops and Prelates; also they must have their stately Houses, magnificent
Halles, gallant Horses, to speak nothing of their Queanes and Concubines: but
it may be, their Prelates will challenge this as proper unto themselves.

9. They are brave Courtiers. This vice is noted in them by diverse good and
approved Writers, as Page 5.
Guil. de S. Amore, diverse MS. * p 130. and MS 29. p. 216.
Manuscripts, and others, branding them with the name of Cl^rici cutiales

Court-slaues; they pronounce a heavy doom against them, Frequentantes Aulas

that shame will be their end, and a worse punishment, if they take not the
better heed. Mistake them not; they mean not Kings and Princes Chaplains,
that necessarily must attend upon them nor such as repair unto the Court upon
good occasion, but frequentantes Curiam, such as are neuerwell, but when they
are there, or any where, so they may be from their charges.

10. They are stout Soldiers: I mean, not only in their field beds, and in
the Lady Venus pair (as I have largely demonstrated unto you before) but
Soldiers in their Contra Clericos vt M^tes incedentes MS 29. p 271.
habit; or (as another has it) Quastu Cletie and habitu milites MS 59 127.
for their greediness they may be called Clergi^men; but for their habits,
Soldiers. Doubtless Saint Bernard was the Author of this complaint they
forget themselves, ^rma milittae nostrae sunt spiritualis; Our weapons are
spiritual. And as a merry fellow told an Fr Duarenus de sac^^s ecclesiae
(...), l 10. 4 p. 440.
Archbishop, that was both a Duke and an Archbishop, and stood in defense of
his temporal Dominion, more then was fitting; It may be (quoth he) the
Archbishop may go to Heaven, but I fear much, the Duke will never go
thither: So give me leave to say to these Clergie-Souldiers, that are, as Ant.
de Dom. l. 6. c. 8. 30.
Ant. de Dominis complains (though they put not on Saint Paul's complete
armor) yet are both galeat^ and lor^ati, harnessea from top to toe: if they be
not commanded to the Waires by the State, as who knows not, but our profound
Bradwardine served as a Chaplain in the Cam^e? but run idly from their Cures,
that well they may go to Heaven as they are Clergymen (which I ^oe not
easily believe,) but as Soldiers they will never come thither. This vice was
touched to the quick by Desid Erasmus, but he was never a whit thought of the
better of the Church of Rome. He was wholly for the maintaining of the Canons
of the Church, and nothing for these Powder-Canons, and Fieldpieces. Thus much
be spoken of their fighting: Ministers must not be fighters.

11. They are cunning Merchants: They trade not with the Word, in this
spiritual merchandise of souls; but with money, like temporal Contra
Mercatores. MS. p. 139.
Merchants and Tradesmen, neglectis studijs.

12. They are for the most part ignorant Dolts, ignari, stulti, stipites,
Pecudes ignauae, stulti sti^ ^^e^ caudaces asiri Io. Auent. l. 5. p. 45^.
candaces, idle sluggards, fools, stocks and stones, that have (as one said
in the Council of Conc. Bas. MS. p 365.
Basil) nec scientiam, nec conscientiam, nec entiam; nor science, nor
conscience, nor any entitie of goodness in them: so that a man may well
conclude of them, as Io. Neuizanus did long before I was borne, peradventure,
de Clerico ad asinum valet argumentum, unless you would have me tell you out
of Polydor Virgil, that their Mass Priests were so ignorant, as not to know
whether Cle in Paracletus were long or short. But for avoiding this
difficulty, and helping their ignorant Shauelings, you have lately found out
an excellent device, to accent all the Trissyllables, or longer words in your
Missals: and yet I do not remember, that Io. de Lapide, as very a stone as
ever wrote, has this amongst his centum dubia occurrentia circa missam,
printed and reprinted with shame enough. Thus ends their first dozen of
faults of their Priests, unless you will have a Bakers dozen. I will be loath
for (for so was mine Author Gyraldus) to touch upon this soar: it was not
Syluester Gyraldus, and yet he was a plain down right Author; it is Lilius
Greg. Cyraldus, the fault was this, (which I do not score up, because I give
it you to boot) That diverse men in his time, or of his knowledge, were chosen
Priests Sacerdotia Histrionica Art comparata Lil. Greg. Gyrald. to. 2 ex hist.
Poet. Dial. 6. p. 236. p. 328.
for some excellent quality, belike, because they were excellent
Stage Players: and yet when I bethink my self the better, this may fall out
to be no fault, or a small one, when we consider, that it is the manner in
Spain and some Countries, to have long Pulpits, and the first work the Priest
does when he ascends the Pulpet, is to set up his Crucifixe, and then to play
his parts, so as never an Actor of them all shall go beyond him. But I have
done.

Polydor Virgil, and especially one Hugo de Polio, that has written a whole
Treatise de 12. Abusionibus Claustri; we intend not whole books of
declamations against their filthy crying sins: but we will as briefly as we
may, deliver them unto you, as we have received them of your own good Writers,
that were compelled by the evidence of truth, or rather by the providence of
God, to lay open their abominations, though you have cast a cloak or garment
upon them (such as it is,) but it will not serve neither your, nor their
turns, there are that have blabbed them abroad, and these they are:

1. The first accusation brought against them, is their Monac^^ Sacerdotibus
Eliae ^^ Idolola^riam co^paran S Pagninus p 1157.
Idolatry, being nothing inferior herein to the idolatrous Priests in Elias
time.

2. Their Regicides, or killing of Kings: Was it not a Henricus septimus

Dominican that porsoned Henry the seventh at the Eucharist? What can be
added to this Villainy? To make the fact seem more ougly, the murderer was a
Religious person, specie tenus, or ver^^^e tenus: the murdered, a sacred
person, an Emperor; the pretense, piety; and the act seeming most religious
of all others; the place holy, the Temple; the Chalice holy, for it was
consecrated. Wonder it is, that he is not consecrated and registered amongst
your Saints, as well as Garnet, and others, that they may be put down in the
Calendars and Martyrologies in rea letters, that their faces may be died red
with shame and confusion, and their bloody facts recorded to posterity, and
read of all men.

3. Their Hypocrisy. Their Religion consists chiefly Caluitie and habitu

their sundry lusts in sundry kinds? They promise and vow Continentiam Monachi

Amatus Lusitanus, or any other, for very shame; let this suffice for the
present.

5. Their Riots and excess in fare. You may read of their Epicureisme and
delicacie in fare, in Hugo de Tot diuersia and tam delicatis cibis vtuntur, qui
in sua domo sobrii, in Monasterium gulosi. Hugo de Folio MS.

thick and threefold to their Monasteries and Nunneries. Lib 1 de los dominos

Io. de Puente, he that lately entitled the King of Spain his Master to the
Seigneurie of the whole world, thinks no man worthy to write a lying Story
(such as his is) unless he come out of a Monastery, or a Cell. True: for if
they only should write, which are the only, or especial liers of the world,
should we not have goodly Stories out of their Forge? But some are of the
contrary mind, that they, and only they, Eorum ignauia historiae intercidunt
Naturae miraculis. Io. Auent. Annal. Boi^r. l 4 p. 312.
have been the cause that we have lost so many good pieces of Antiquity, so
many famous Histories, by their mere negligence and indiligence.

7. Their Discord and dissentions. They are called Fratres, that is, Friars:
but Fratrum quoque gratia rara est: they agree like Cat and Dog, either
amongst themselves, or toward others. I would to ^ V^inam non ^^^et ver^ss^mum

Ariosto says) may be written and painted in their Cloisters and Walls: but
doubtless it is not practiced in their lives and conuersations.

8. Their Pride is somewhat Non potest superb^a eorum operati quam cum superb^a
a Luciferi qui voluit fieri al^^hmus B^^ti. (^ssan. ^^^a^. glor^^ ^undi 4 ^^te
considerat. 2^. Sedeum sint Minores.
Lucifer-like; it cannot well go higher: they are called Minorites some of
them; but they may be all called Maiorites.

9. Their Wandering up and down. They can neither truly contain (for as I
showed you, their Claustia Monachorum prostibuia meretricum Laur. S^hiaderus in
Monum. Ital. p 235.
Cloisters are but so many baudy houses) nor are their Cloisters able to
contain them; they must be running up and down with little Pictures or
Tablets of the Ad haec Sancto rum reliqu as vel Apostolicas Tabellas,
offerentibus osculandas porrigunt, etc Polyd Virgil. l. 7. c. 7.
Apostles, which the simple people are made to kiss, and give them money.
Polydor Virgil in the place quoted in the Margent, has so lively represented
this fault unto our considerations, that I am in a manner constrained to
refer you to his learned Writings, that desire to be better informed
hereabouts.

10. Their begging. They Poseunt stipem quam decet magis dare. Viues in Aug. l.
3. c. 26.
beg, that are fitter to give; and live idly, that Monachi debent operari
Nota Marg. in Bibl. Pp. col 7 27.

self to beg, or else it is never like to see light, for ought that I know.
I read of many Monks that were Fishers, and relieved themselves and others by
that honest Trade: and I can tell you also of one that was a Monachus fabrilem
artem exercens. MS. Dunelm.
Smith, and exercised the Trade in his Monastery: belike it was he that made
the Tongs that Saint Dunstane used, when he took the Devil by the nose: the
Story is worth the reading in our old Chronicles, if a man have so much faith
as to believe it. But to return to our begging Friars, which take the habit
of Ingrediuntur Monasterium ab otium and open I^ Cuspin in Austria p. 602
poor Monks upon them for riches sake; and so (as one notes very well) by

professing themselves poor, they make themselves rich: they have stately
houses, and are called beggars: Vtinam hoc esset mendicare; He that should
beg with them, should not loose by them: but of this enough.

11. Their pride in Apparel is one of the twelve abuses, noted by Hugo de
Folio, and he sets it down in Folio: ye may believe him, for he knew it
too well.

12. Their Courting is noted by the same Author, who has taken much pains to
reform them (if it were possible) and to reduce them to their prime-order. It
was wont to be said, A Monk out of his Cell, was like a Fish out of the water.
But in his time, and in all times, a man may find some of these Frogs; not
only at Pharaohs Court, that is, in the Palaces of Kings and Princes; but in
the Court of Rome, trading with his Holiness about making and marring of
Marriages; about unlawful Divorces and Dispensations, and I know not what. I
will not speak of their unnaturalness to Parents which they practice, if they
do not teach; nor of their children which they do steal: I have The
beginning of the Statute MS. Vncinis pomorum puerulos ad religionem vestram
attrahitis. c Monachi in tribus Deo similes vbique; 1. aliquando in lupanari;
2. omnia sciunt vagando; 3 non peccando P. Rebuffus tr. Concordatorum, p. 214.
showed you an express Statute of our University of Oxford against it: these
be supernumerarious faults; but to conclude, there is no sin but they have a
tincture of it, and yet like counterfeits, they would be like God; without
sin as he is, know all things as he does, are in all places; they are P.
Rebuffus words, some of them too sharp to be Englished, and joined with a
little profaneness, to my seeming, which may well become a Popish Writer.

Of Miracles.
I Had here thought to have concluded: but that a fit and just occasion is
given me, by a late accident that fell out here in Oxford, to speak somewhat,
although not much of this point, of Miracles: the patration of them is made a
special note of their Church in diverse books, that were lately scattered in
the night about our Colleges and Halles, and in the Cities and fields (books
that we have heard of long since, whereof some of them are thoroughly refuted)
because I say, the evil one that has sowed these Tares amongst our good
Wheat, while the good Householder slept (as his manner is) confides belikes in
his cause, and triumphs upon this point more then any other. I will therefore
take so much pains, as to insist upon this point a little.

I will not take upon me to answer all, it needs not; let one or two serve
for all the rest. The Author of my Lord of Londons supposed Legacy, makes this
his sixth motive: That true Miracles have been wrought for proof of the
Catholic religion; but not any for Protestancy; and he reckons up diverse most
stupendous Miracles in the primitive Age, and later times; in this World and
the New, I mean, both the Indies: and he concludes with this Epiphonema; O
misery and feeblenes of Nouelisme in doctrine, which is forced Page 75.
(through it own poverty) to sustentate and support it self for the time, by
maintaining assertions, repugnant to the providence and charity of God toward
Man, and to all light of natural reason. So that we must (as my Lord of London
did, if they could tell the time when) believe that doctrine which is
accompanied with so many true and celebrious Miracles wrought by God alone,
without any secondary humane means whatsoever. Master Io. Brereley has
likewise in his of S. Aug. religion spent his 18. Chapter, and all his Sections
upon this matter: so that now the matter is made cocksure. Against all which,
is brought by him and his fellow Musket, whosoever shall oppose his own bare
unwarranted denial, we leave (says he) that man as much more worthy of
contempt, then farther reply. But stay, now you Master Musket have spent all
your powder; or if you did shoot bullets, you have wounded or killed none but
your own men (as may appear.) Not to speak of the Auctour upon the imperfect
work upon Matthew, very ancient (although In illud Mathei, Tunc qui sent in
Iudaea fugiant in montes.

the negative, that miracles may prove a false Church, and be done by
Heretics, which your Inquisitors have purged out of the Auctour: That

Ammonus, Turpinus, Guaguinus, and all your old Annalists: ask your own Bodin,
and he will tell you so much: they were done and not done, made or rather
feined by help of Devils, or of the black Art, by your false Prophets, to draw
men to superstition, from the reading of Gods word: Such were those that
Gregory the seventh used against Henry the fourth: Four Monks that at Berke
would needs counterfeite the five wounds of Christ; your Tablets of the virgin
Mary that fell from heaven: or of gallant virgin Mary, either at Reginoburg, or
Lisbon, or of Oeting, of your miracles of old of Transubstantiation: or of late
within these one hundred years, wherewith you have blinded the simple people,
and cast a mist before there eyes, they are infinite in number, that have been
wrought by Xauier and his fellow cheaters, and so shall those be that
Antichrist shall bring to pass in the latter end of the world, to the seducing
of the very elect of God (if it were possible) and therefore I cannot be
persuaded, that there are any true miracles wrought amongst you: they were
needful in the infancy, but not in the grows of the Church and ask not me
but S. Austine a reason, why miracles do now cease in these times of the
Gospel; or rather your own ^ Quare miracula non fiant. Geo. Ven. Probl. To 4

Geo: Venetus (to come nearer home) and they will be able well to ensorme you
in this point: and therefore ring your belles, preach your miracles, and make
no small gain of them before them simple people or poor Indians. Let your men
urge them, and press them, and make their station in them, taking them up of
trust one from the other, as Bede from S. Gregory, and S. Gregory from others.
I am fully resolved by your own men, that miracles without faith can never be
effectual: but true faith without miracles, may be acceptable both to God and
men, as I have formerly showed.

As concerning Master Brerelies fond objection, because I perceive by the
casting away of his books, that he is weary, or ashamed of them; and is now
casting about, how he may frame a convenient answer (though it be but in show)
to him that wrote against him, I will not trouble his patience at this time,
but stay till he reioyne, and then I do bind my self by promise, to join
issue with him, and to answer whatsoever he shall object; either about
miracles, or any thing else, that shall concern the substance of our religion.
Whilst he urges Protestants and Papists, I will assure him that I will urge
none but Papists, and especially those that are marked with a black Theca in
their Indices expurgatorij.

And for a conclusion to all: seeing they urge us so far upon the point of
miracles, I will commend these few miracles that follow to their most Christian
consideration. If they prove not miracles, yet I believe, they will prove
miraculous and stupendous actions, and such as do note forth unto us the
great providence of God, in preserving his little flock, his true Church,
amidst the fury, and fiery assaults of his and their great enemies, beyond
the degree of admirations.

First, when the deluge of superstition had wel-nigh over whelmed the arc of
the Church, when that abomination of desolation, foretold by Daniel, and
forespoken by S. Paul, began to sit in the Church, and to exalt himself
against God, or all that is called God: God had his Waldo in France, and
Wickleph here in England, and Hus a little after in Behemia, that did preserve
the truth of religion entire and uncorrupted, and themselves (except John Hus)
untouched and unhurt: being but a handful of men, against so many and potent
Adversaries.

Secondly, how their followers being persecuted with bell, book, and candle,
with fire, and sword, multiplied whilst they groaned, like the Children of
Israel under Pharaoh into thousands, and stood out against the Pope and his
Croisadoes, and some of them to this present day, in the Conualles remain,
that never yet bowed the knees to Baal, nor received the mark of the Beast in
their foreheads.

Thirdly, that blind Ziska, and his poor Thaborits, should conquer three
hosts of the Pontificians, that were Cochlaeus.
thought to be iuincible, and to have been an army sufficient, to have
encountered the great Turk, and to have beaten him out of all Natolia.

Fourthly, that the slaughtering and murdering of men and women in their bloody
unholy Inquifition, has been a special cause of the increase of the Church,
and the conversion of diverse Saul's into Paul's, which of bloody Inquisitors,
became afterward patient Martyrs, to the astonishment of most men, who
wondered not a little; that so many of both sexes, especially of the simpler
sort, should lay down their lives so readily, for the testimony of the Gospel:
it made them (as I say) wonder, what that religion should be.

Fistly, their Inquisition of books as well as of men, the especial Ram
found out in the Council of Trent, by the instigation of the Devil, as the
chief means to establish their new and unheard of religion; partly by
prohibiting of whole books, partly by purging of some Tracts in some books,
has proved (being discovered unto us by the finger of God) the chiefest
instrument of Gods glory, whereby so many witnesses of the truth are known now
unto us; to speak wholly, and often, and earnestly, for the reformation which
was made by Luther in these parts, (though it were before known in other parts
of the world) especially in Bohemia, that Luther himself wished both for
doctrine and discipline, his might be the same per omnia: I say in all this,
men purposed, but God disposed of all, for the singular good of his Church.

Sixthly and lastly, what shall I speak of the more then miraculous
preservation of the late Queen, and our late King, and of both King, Queen,
Prince, and State, from infinite and eminent dangers, both from fire and water?
in the Spanish invasion from water, in the Gunpowder treason from fire: God
make us ever more and more thankful, for these our more then miraculous
deliverances, and so I end both the whole book, and my answer to Musket and
his companions about miracles. Deo soli sit gloria.

The Conclusion of the whole Book, with certain needful Aduertisements to
the Christian Reader, for the better understanding of the same.
CHristian Reader, whether Protestant or Papist, it mattreth not, and whether
you read and approve it, or read and refuse it, it is all one: there belongs
subscription to the one, and a full demonstration of mine errors to the other:
and then as I have ready thanks for the one; so I have as ready my peccaui for
the other. In the mean time, now I have put a full period to my book, and
eased both my self, and thee, of much fastidiousnesse in reading, I think it
fit to say something, and not much, for the clearing of my intentions, and your
understandings.

First, for the testimonies cited, and recited in this book, they are taken
partly out of books printed, partly out of books unprinted. Secondly, the
books printed are partly (and for the greatest part) of books purged; partly
out of books unpurged, whereof there be but very few: and whether purged, or
unpurged, the Authors all of them are putatiue, and supposed Papists, bred and
brought up in the bosom of the Catholic Roman Church: though they belong
unto the Catholic Church, as shall be farther showed in my Alphabet of
Authors, and Prints in the latter end of the book. Of these Authors that are
unpurged, I have been very sparing, when I could have brought whole squadrons
of Popish Writers that do war on our side, and fight under our colors. I
have singled out but three amongst the rest: the first is Geo. Wicelius: the
second, the Author of the Council of Trent; the third and last Pietro Seaue.
is, Ant, de Dominis, all which I allege the more willingly, because all these
three were either peacemakers, or reformers of those Additaments, or
superadditaments, that time or ignorance, or that evil one has brought in
step by step into the Church of Rome: which was unquestionably the Church of
God, and its faith praised throughout all Nations, and is at this present time,
a kind of putrid member of the same. The first of these is Geo. Wicelius, a
famous preacher in his time of Mentz, who was a true peacemaker: the first
after Martin Luther, whose Motto was, Beati Pacifici: and yet a sore enemy to
him, and all Sectaries, habemus confitentem reum. If Luther had not, he and
his accomplices would have reformed the Church in a peaceable ^anner, and in a
lawful Council; and not otherwise in most things differenced, or controuerted
between us and the Papists. He first banisheth the Schoolmen, and their
nicities, and foole-questions, thinking them to be the only troublers of the
State, and quiet of the Church.

2. Secondly, in place of them, he brings in the Scripture, which he places
in her Throne, as the Queen and Mistress of all other subordinate
testimonies, giving her the precedencie both in, and out of Council, and
making her, and her only the supreme Judge of all Controversies.

3. He admits of no Traditions doctrinall, but such as are well warranted by
the Word of God: Ceremonials he allows upon the selfsame conditions that
we do; if they be not too gaudy, or too many, significatiue and mysterious,
and well expounded to the people; for the ornament, not of the essence of the
Church, without putting any trust or confidence in them, a fault too common in
those days, and noted by Cassander his Scholar many days and years after,
and as yet unreformed in their Roman Church.

4. He is peremptory for the Translation of the Bible into the vulgar
Languages of each Country, for singing of Psalms and Hymmes in a known
tongue, and for Catechizing of the people.

5. He inuayeth against their numberless Feasts, abused Vigils, and imposed
Fasts; the rigor of the one, and the number of the others, he thought fit to
be abated, and in stead thereof, that Sermons should be brought into the Church
(if need were) two a day.

6. For their Sermons, he would not have them to be of a tale of a tub, or out
of lying Legends, the principal fault of those times, but out of the pure Word
of God.

7. He flatly contradicts their adoration of Images.

8. Their invocation of Saints.

9. He speaks against their confidence of Purgatory, their questuarie
ostentation of Relics, gainefull Funerals, and Di^^ges; and wishes, that the
largeness of the Popes Indulgences were contracted, and the Treasure of the
Church better employed.

10. Farther, he says, tha^ their holy Mass is both often, and many ways
abused, that it has de decorosos abusus, is shamefully abused by their private
Altars, and private Masses; too much by themselves upon hope of gain, too
little with the people administered. He inueyeth against their murmurings and
whisperings in their Liturgies, and wishes their halfe-Communions had either
not been taken away; or being taken away, were restored again in a Council by
public authority, and not otherwise.

11. He would have a Council called for reformation of the Church, in it Head
and members: but his request is the same with the Lutherans in the Council of
Trent, that the Emperor should assemble it, the Word of God preside in it, and
that it should be called in Idonea Ciuitate in a fit place, and the Pope to
have notice of it.

12. Priests Marriage, though he like not well (as preferring single life of
Priests before it:) yet he knows no Canon of the Church, or tie of Vows, to
restrain them from marriage, warrantable enough by the Word of God, and
practice of some Churches: but howsoever, he utterly disauoweth their
Concubinarie Priests, their notorious Adulteries, Incests, and Fornications,
especially of the younger sent: yea, he is of the mind, that Priests Wives and
Children, should have some competencie of means allowed them for their
liuelood and maintenance.

13. What shall I say of their ^lergie? is not he zealous for a Reformation,
that spent his spirits almost and time wholly in urging it, both in Pope,
Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, and Monks, offenders more or less, in what kind,
and of what sort soever? The number of idle Monks he would have abated and
reduced to their primitive orders, the Priests not t^^^^ue at so high a rate,
the Bishops and Cardinals to their office and functions, to assist the Pope in
doing good and preaching the Gospel or visiting the sick, or suruaying their
Diocesses. Lastly, (...) Pope (to whom he, poor Wicelius, deceived by a
counterfcite Epistle of Anacl^tus, erring the error of the Pontifician, by
misinterpreting the words of our ^uiour, Thou art Peter, gives a kind of
Supremacy, but not in that latitude that now it is taken) he summoneth to
appear before the Tribunal Seat of God, if he did not his best, to reform
the corruptions of the Clergy in general, not exempting his Holiness, as some
flatterers and pick-thankes did, and the foul abuses of the Court of Rome,
which were spread abroad throughout all the World in books printed, to the
shame of that See, and just reproof of his Holiness; and he did verily
think in his conscience, that if they did not the sooner begin to reform the
Sectaries, by Colloquies, or Councels, not by fire and sword; ere long be they
would loose all Germany, that began then to dance after Martins Luthers Pipe,
and greedily to embrace his doctrine, for the very filthiness and abominable,
or innominable sins of their Clergy.

14. Lastly, what shall I speak of their Holy water, qua nihil immundius, that
was unholy, their Thurification, that was to be rejected, because the sent
thereof was not pleasing in Gods nostrils, abuse of Confession, Baptism,
Excommunication, which were too too much abused? You see our Wicelius was a
true reformer of the Church, a moderate Papist at the least, and no dissembler
of the faults of his age, and of the Church: doubtless in time he might (if he
had not bin too much awed by their great ones, to whom as became a peaceable
man he showed all manner of outward obedience,) I say, he might have proved an
other Martin Luther, though moved with a clean contrary spirit, so powerful is
the Spirit of God, to change our purposes, and alter our nature when, and as it
pleases the Divine providence. Concerning, Ant. de Dom I know not well what to
say: but to cry out Digitus Dei; God had a finger in disposing of his coming
over, and suffering him to fall, that other might rise, and to write so
directly against the Church of Rome (as to my seeming for the most points, no
man has done better,) though himself were never in the right, having a good
head, but a corrupt and equluocating heart from the beginning, which well
became him that was tutored by, and brought up under the Jesuits. Now, albeit
his conversion were most fained, and his Apostacy most certain and true,
whatsoever he proposed to himself (the heart is a Closet, wherein none may
enter but God,) God so disposed of both for his glory, that his person should
relapse from our Religion, and himself return with the Dog to his old vomit,
and his elegant and substantial books (though they be mute) should speak and
proclaim to all the World, the vnauoideable truth of our Religion, now
publicly professed and established in the Church of England. Thus does the
divine providence bring light out of darkness, and make good effects spring
from the root of evil causes; as better shall appear when we come to give
you my observations about the books that are purged. I will only touch upon
the Author of the History of the Council of Trent, whom (because Ant. de
Dominis, whom I cannot call Ant. de Dommo, because he served more Masters,
called Pietro Soar) I will also call him by that name, does so far show to
every one-eyed Reader, that the Council of Trent, though it were called
against, and condemned Martin Luther, and his Religion; yet if the Council had
been free, and their voices decisiue without the Pope (though the Italian
Bishops were three to one in number) and there had been no foul play in
calculating the voices, still I say, leaving the Clokebag behind, the Council
of Trent might have turned Lutheran, and sat at Witenberge, as well as there,
for their propositions and reasons, which (as D. Stapleton says) may be
fallible and deceitful; but the conclusion is that which they did, and we must
look after, if we will suffer our selves to be hoodwinckt, See l, Examen
Pacifique. Que le Concile of est pas legitime. Chap. 4.
and as very fools as they; I am not ignorant, that there be some in the world
moderate Papists, that have taken as just, and as great exception, as we do,
or can, unto the Council of Trent; and I would not have the Christian Reader
ignorant of this, that I have entreated of this largely in another set
Treatise, which, if it shall be thought worthy by the Church of England (to
whom I do yield, and owe all submission) may have the happiness with some
other Treatises of mine to see the light. Of the books printed unpurged, so
much by way of caveat: for the printed purge * Copies, take gentle Reader,
these few notes into thy Christian consideration.

1. That I propose not to my self any exact handling of the Controversies
questioned between us and the Papists, per viam Thomae (as they say) by way of
opposition, or objections and answers out of Scripture, Councels, Fathers,
midled aged, first aged, and all aged Writers before Martin Luther: my weak
and wearied legs at this time will not suffer me to expatiate so far; (yet
my studies I confess, and natural disposition to rip up, and unfold the
controversies, and vnriuit them out of the secrets of true Antiquity, drive
that way) my purpose is (if God will) to give you a taste only of that fruit,
which may be expected out of their sundry Indices Expurgatorij, if they be well
and narrowly sought after, and looked into. I have but seven or eight of them;
some that fell into my hands by casualty, at the surprizall of the Town of
Cadiz; others, by the providence of God, and great care and industry of the
Founder of our great Library, Sir Thom. Bodley, the P^olomey of our ^ges, and
wonderful preserver of books. I have by my self and my friends, amassed and
shouelled together some thirty Quire of Paper of Catholic restitutions, and
restored some one or two hundred several Authors, and out of them I have
gathered this small Introduction, or Manuduction unto Divinity, sorted
according unto the especial Articles of Religion, controuerted at this day
between us and the Papists* delivered in as plain and familiar manner, as I
could possibly devise, for the capacity of the vulgar Protestant or Papist.

2. I have not taken all that may be taken, or gathered out of the Articles,
that the book might not rise to too great a bulk. I have neither collected
all that is contained in the several Indices, but a third or fourth part only;
nor all that is contained in my said collections, but the most pertinent and
proper places.

3. Neither is it to be understood* that all that are recorded by them for
Papists, are indeed Papists, but supposed ones, as Laeuinus, Lemnius, Io.
Spondanus, etc. whose testimonies are sparingly miscited by me, in following
the common error of the Pontificians, which reckon them in the second Classis
of Authors prohibited, which is the note of Papists books forbidden: but
whether they be, or be not, the question is proved without their testimonies,
which you may take, or follow at pleasure.

written hand, before they came to the Inquisitors hands, and were printed, what
innumerable testimonies should we h^^^ ^ad?
by them expunged, by me used, it appears evidently, that the Church of Rome
in point of Doctrine, had need of reformation, when they did so often, and so
many of them call for it, before Martin Luther, pressing and expressing it in
their learned Writings, which were printed at Rome, Venice, Madrill, Paris, and
other Popish places.

5. That their books were many of them examined, before they came unto the
Press, and accordingly corrected in many places, and afterward printed
permisses superiorum, with these very notes which we present unto you.

6. These Adversaries of ours, and Writers of theirs, who write and speak many
things in our behalf, forced by truth, not invited by charity, though their
authority of it self were of small account; yet they are to be esteemed, and
good reckoning is to be made of them, when they speak in favor of us, because
their own consciences freely, and vncoact^dly, induce them in such matters of
weight, to depose against themselves, and against the oath of their own
confederacy, and so rest condemned by their own Records, and guilty of
error in themselves, and iniquity against God. I. N. in his Preface to his
learned Works, could any man if he had been hired, have spoken more properly,
and pertinently to our purpose? I commend his judgment, and shall like it the
better whilst I know him: known him I have, and ere long we shall be better
acquainted.

7. The testimony of these Writers by me alleged* which vncoacted, and
forced by truth, do plead for our Religion, are pertinent and to the purpose:
for else what need had you to raze the Records, and as it were, to embezell
their Writings?

8. To say (as some do) that our Mother the Church may correct her disobedient
children, and reduce them into the right way of truth, when they reclaim, or
swerve from the truth, may, perhaps, be true, provided, that it be known
which is the true Church: secondly, that it have a certain infallible and
inerrable rule, whereby all doctrine must be squared: and lastly, that the
Author be sent for by himself, or his friends, his error showed, and reasons
convicted. But for the first, you have no Church; if you have, lay the Pope
aside, whom you would feign make your inerrable Dictator, and tell me where it
is, and who it is, and we shall have some hope of agreement in this point.
Secondly, as you have no Church, so you have no certain Rule to proceed by,
your doctrine is yet to seek, and your Religion to be made, except
transubstantiation, your doctrine against Priests Marriage, and some few points
more, that are in some sort, in some Councels concluded; show all points of
your doctrine, your additaments, determined before the Council of Trent, and
you shall have them for me. As for the Sea the Examen. Pacifique, alias, the

Council of Trents determination, it neither makes our religion schismatical,
or heretical; nor yours truly Catholic and Orthodoxe. Lastly, that which you
practice upon your own Writers by way of expurgatio^, is not done with their
priritie, but altogether against their wills and consents.

9. It will not avail the Papists to say, that they purge not the words of the
Text in any Romish-Catholike Author, but some scattred Annotations in the
Margent or Indices of some Writers. I reply, that the Indices and Margents
speak nothing different from the text, and whether the Text be not thoroughly
expunged, and some whole sentences, pages, yea, sixty in follio together
blotted out; I refer my self to any indifferent Popish Arbiter* to arbitrate
and sentence this controversy between us: for being reduced unto a
Controversy of fact, every Lay Gentleman, if They are evident to the most
ignorant and unlearned persons. R S. in his Preface to the Reader, and are
decided with more facility, Ib.
his eyes be matches, becomes a fit Judge of these Controversies; your own
Smith truly says it, and I believe it. But you cry out still, Show us the
books printed accordingly, as Auentinus, Cranzius, Ferus, Espencaeus, or
Stella? Let me see whether the sentences you speak of, or those that you have
produced in this very book, be omitted or no? I answer: This objection has a
good varnish or glass set upon it; but glass is brittle, and varnish will not
long hold: to say the truth, your men speak they know not what in defense of
their Indices; you have their toungs, and they have your ears to pawn, and
which is more, your souls and consciences. What you hear your spiritual
Governors say, you believe assuredly: what so you believe, you are ready to
depose (if need be) against your consciences. For example: If one of your
spiritual fathers should tell you, that the house at the Blacke-Friers fell
upon a Puritan Preacher and his Psalming Auditorie, to The house was said ^^
be in S. Andrews; the Preacher, a Puritan: this I speak from our Master
Rainsden of Lincoln College, who heard it from the Honorable, Sir Isaac
Wake, Ambassador for his Majesty in Venice, who had a book presented him in
France of this argument.

Jesuit, ergo, impeccable, or a Father of the Society, and therefore to be
believed, chiefly in ordine ad Deum. Or what if another of the same Society
should bring you a book of my Lord of Londons Legacy, (a Legacy without a
Will; or a Will, but never proved) how gladly would you read and receive,
hug and embrace it, as the words of a dying Saul, so lately, so miraculously
converted to the Roman Faith? Yet Preston, that is said to be his conuerter,
denies it, and says plainly in Peter's word, but with more truth, I know not
the man: his eldest son that was with him, and his Chaplains and servants that
were about him* know no such things. Let other me^ conjecture what they will of
this rumor, if I might freely deliver unto you my conceit, this false report
was hatched first in the Spanish Ambassadors house, by him is was rumoured
abroad beyond the Seas, and by him and his it was bruted here in England: I
have my reasons to think it and think it again; for that about the same
time, there was a book either going to the press, or newly printed; wherein

wherein it is not fit for Ministers to enterdeale, I willingly forbear: But
this story that follows I cannot choose but relate it; it lies aspersions on
the late King, scandalizeth the State, pardon my just indignation, and true
zeal, that pricks me forward, and makes me for the good of the Kingdom and

and belch our these words, against our late King, and State, so dangerously
untrue, so deuilishly invented, and vented abroad in diverse languages? And
these words fell not from his pen by misaduenture; for in an other place of
this infernal book, being occasioned again to speak of the powder Treason,
though he grant that there were eight or six Knights, more Hu^o les ann^s

or less, very boys or youths, that had a finger in the Powder Treason,
being drawn into this hellish plot, by the cunning persuasions of the
Protestants themselves as the report geeth, this is the most that con be said
against them. But admit it be so as our Aduer saries would have it: although
(as I have said before) it is voyced publicly by many, and those most grave
and substantall persons to the contrary, that all was but apolitique invention
of the State, and a snare to entrap them silly sonles, whereby it may appear,
that those which should have put this treason in execution, were the Authors
and plotters of it. Here are the same words twice repeated: note them well, and
call to mind that if this Treason, which God did miraculously prevent and
confound, had ( quod ab sit) taken effect, it should have been bruted and
rumored abroad, that this had been the fact of the Puritants, to set the
Puritants and the Protestants together by the ears, and whilst they had been
sheathing their swords one in another bowels, the Spaniards might have come
in and cut all their throats. Here hence I draw a double obseruaaion, one of
the wily Spaniard, who knowing that his Majesty, and the State, was justly
incensed against the Puritants, cast all the envy they can upon them: the fall
of the House in the black Friars, was upon Puritants; the King was, or should
have been deposed by the Puritants; the powder Treason should have been wrought
and brought to pass by Protestant Puritants. The other observation is this,
that there is no report so hellish, devilish, or incredible; but a Romanist,
or Hispaniolized Papist, will soon believe it if it be told him in ordine ad
Deum, or to make the King of Spain their Master, Master of the Land, in whose
pay as it Brittanniae populos quos Pater, ^^^s Re^ optums nequiuit summis

were the most of them are already, as Villalpandus says, congratulating the
King of Spain, for getting more ground of the English by a Treaty of peace,
then his Father could do by an open war. But to draw this relation to an
end, is there any true hearted Papist in this land, that has but any sense of
religion, or any drop of English blood in his body, or any thing of a man in
him; that can endure these enormous, devilish, and hellish opprobries and
calumnies, that are cast upon the King, State, and Religion? And in your
impartial judgments, does not the Auctour, the late reporter of the powder
Treason, deserve to be beaten all to powder, that neither searing God, nor
men, dares report such insamous lies, that in a superlatiue degree of infamy,
touch this State, and then cause the book thus published, to be translated
into diverse languages. I know you can Traduzidos de Latin en varias Lenguas por

not but think, that your vncatholike religion, does suffer for these false
reports: To come nearer to my purpose, you were best deny that there be any
Indices expurgatorij, that searse meddle with the marginall notes, muchlesse
with the Text of your own men? Or if it be, it is but in praecept only, it is
not in practice: but for purging and expurging the Fathers, God forbid that any
thing should be spoken of your Indices, it cannot be showed, it cannot be
proved: so say your ghostly Fathers, and so say you. But I say that Madriti par

each part and member of this accusation, shall be justified to your faces, to
your shame.

First, for your Indices, cease off for very shame to deny it, we have these
many known. I have seen the first of Antwerpe, that Iunius reprinted, three
of Spain, one of Portugal, another of Naples, and the first Tome of that which
is the Master Index of all other of Rome. Marginall notes and Annotations, you
do in a manner acknowledge to be deservedly put forth, and words in the text
are shamefully corrupted by sundry Additions, subtractions, and wilful
commutations; sometimes in the reprinting of new books, but mostly by the
pen. You have no great care or appetite, to reprint any of those Auctours
works, that come under your devilish censures: but if they be reprinted, iuxta
mandatum Inquisiciouis Hispanicae, or Romanae, then make no doubt but they will
keep touch with you, unless it be in France, where this kind of Inquisition
was never yet fully received. See the later Editions of the probable Fathers,
in I know not how many Tomes, Polydor Virgill of Rome print, Eman. Sa. and
sundry other; but if they fail in reprinting them, (they have no great

stomach to it as I have told you) yet they fail not with the pen, to blot
out all the places, that are to be expunged; and let me see the proudest
Scholar amongst you all, that dares keep a book unpurged by them, it is a
kind of Praemunire, loss of books, and finable, if it amount not to
perpetual imprisonment. This is plainly manifested both out of the pain
contained in the Indices, and out of the books themselves that come unto us by
divine providence; especially from the College of Cadiz. After this manner
Did. Stella, Io. Ferus, Guil. Budaeus, remain to this day in the public
Library, some whole leaves pasted together, the sentences blotted, and the
books tormented in a pitiful manner, that it would grieve any man's heart to
see them; and this was done by public Authority, according to the prescript
form of your Expurgatorie Indices, the Inquisitors name is either fore
scribed, or subscribed, to every book. It were a world to see Krantzius, and
Auentine, as they come out of their hands. There are some a private persons in
Oxford, that have books in like sort expunged and sigued with the Inquisitors
hands. What might the number be of all those think we, that came out of that
College? It is no marvel then if Massarena the Bishop, or any other, offered
such large sums, for to have had the books again; they feared belike, that
their knavery would come forth, and the mystery be unfolded of this work of
darkness, which since that time has lain no more secret in corners; but is
now known, to the body of all Christendom, and herehence by sight of your
books thus scored or printed: occasion is given to the A. C. In his proface

wiser sort of Papists, to think it must needs be a weak and bad cause,
that needs to be supported by weak and bad shifts.

But the last objection of all is, that the Fathers are not purged, no text of
the Fathers in any Index, is purged or expunged: say ye so, what say ye to

Saint John Chrysostom, Agapetus, and diverse others, either in their own
works, or in other men's works, of great Antiquity purged, and repurged, and
expurged again. What your purpose is, I know not, I do easyly imagine that it
is to no great good of our religion, that you have five times at the least
printed several Editions of the Bibliotheca Sanctorum Patrum: first printed by
Bigne, and lately at Coleyne with additions of I know not how many volumes,
with Jesuitical notes and Annotations, in Greek and Latin; and so much for
this ninth observation, which I have the rather insisted upon so long, because
it contains the marrow and pith of all the rest.

10. These men that bear witness for us, are no mean Fellows, abject
Writers, or contemptible persons; but the glory of those days, the honor of
those times, the great Lamps and Ornaments of their Romish Church, some of
them Inquisitors, but groan now under the Inquisition themselves; quis enim
custodiat ipsos custodes: but as I have elsewhere (and may hereafter more
fully) showed, there is no more certainty in their censures, then there is
assuredness in their religion, which is just none at all. But briefly and
orderly, that you may know of what great account they were, at the latter end
of this book, you shall perhaps have an Alphabeticall Table, that out of their
own censures, shall demonstrate this point to the full.

Lastly, you see by these Indices, if flesh and blood might have prevailed, by
the secret operation of the Devil, how the Pontificians would have taken from
us, and the World, so many testimonies of Fathers, middle aged Writers, and of
all sorts, all at one time, and as it were, blown them up like Fa^xes in the
Vaught: but that God is mightier then men, the truth then lies; by this one act
of theirs, and that a devilish one. But God has blown, as it were, the Powder
into their own faces, filling them with shame and confusion, laying their
nakedness open to the eye of the World, insomuch, that all wel-minded men do
either hiss, or laugh at it; seeing our Religion reasonably well confirmed and
established by their own men. What pity had it been, that so many Noble
Writers, and worthy Authors should have perished from us and them. And thereby
any man of the meanest capacity may thence draw forth this conclusion, that
God had his Church in the midst of Popery, and special men, that in every
age did reclaim and declaime against their foul abuses, both in doctrine and
life. These are the knees that never bowed to Baal, the men that truly served
God (though it were in secret) which if they had been free to speak their
minds, and their minds had been fully known to us, they would most willingly
have embraced our Religion, and made a greater reformation, then that of
Luthers, and that of the Princes of Germany, which was by the secret Judgment

of God, to be performed in ore gladij cruentati, as was long prophesied
before. I close up all with this admonition, that all the material places by
me cited, and by them expunged or expurged, carry this note of the Cross
before them, to show, that the Authors endured the Cross for Christ, and were
persecuted for righteousness sake.

Concerning the Manuscript Copies by me cited, they are after proofs, and not
many, having the figure of a hand to direct you. Rome was not built upon a day.
I have cited but a few, and those for the most part neglected and trod under
foot: they are all of them almost innominable books, but not feigned by me,
but written and urged many years ago, the character and letter will best show
the time, and some circumstances may hereafter better discover unto us the
Authors: but be they who they will, in many points of doctrine, they are wholly
ours. By that time we have gone over all the unprinted Manuscript Copies in
both Universities, the famous Library of Sir Robert Cotton, and other private
Libraries, is there not great hope of much good to be done for the public
benefit of the Church? If I had but half a dozen of such as I know, that are
both willing and able: for pity let not the Jesuit vpbraide us any longer

want of due encouragement and employment in this sacred and weighty
business. Some such matter has been motioned in Convocation: Oh, let it not
be said, as it was once spoken of of our Conuocations and Congregations here in

thank God, I have somewhat to live on, and to pay every man his own: but
there is somewhat else to be done, unless I would be an Infidel, and deny
the Faith of the Church of England, notwithstanding all their flatteries and
false promises. I have gotten those small Benefices, that the late Lord Bishop
of Canterbury, and this present, with my Lord of Bath and Wels, ever to be
remembered by me with all thankfulness, freely, and without suit or seeking
without gift or reward, without cure of souls, or charge of men. Let any
Priest or Jesuit beyond the Sea, show me, that their Abbots and Bishops have
done the like, so freely, so unasked, and I will resign these up unto them,
which I am not minded yet to do as my Predecessor did, showing Doctor Ascanius
my Predecesour in Mongeham in Kent. Thus have they answered my Bellum Papale,
and Ecloga; but omitted to say any thing of my book of Corruptions, Wicklifes

one Italian trick for our learning. And thus taking my leave, I rest yours in
the Lord, wishing the Adversaries to answer this book (if they have a mind to
it) (...) not by snatches and catches, as some have done, but punctually and
thoroughly avoiding personal calumniations, and truly quoting their authorities
in the beginning or end of their books.

HERE FOLLOWS A PROFESSION OF THE Catholic Faith, set out according to the
Decree of the Council of Trent.
I.N. does with a steadfast faith believe and profess all and Printed at the
end of Laws de Grenadoes spiritual Doctrine, translated by Rich. Gibbon, Lon.
1599. p. 393.
every point, contained in the Symbol of the Faith, that the holy Roman
Church does use; to wit, to believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven
and Earth; of all things visible and invisible: And in one Lord Jesus Christ,
the only This book I got into my hands as a special Secret of theirs, not
without much ado; and if this, had bin administered only to Graduates, it
might in some sort have been endured: but to administer the same to Lay and
unlettered Papists being so dangerous, and ^leane contrary to the Kings
Supremacy, I know not how it can be defended. Again, of the points pressed in
the Oath, some are crved down by all, as Indulgences, some denied by almost
all, as adoration of Images: some doubted of by their best learned, as
Purgatory: some held with a distinction, as that of the seven Sacraments: and
yet the simple Papists must swear to them all, and that no man can be saved
without holding them all.
begotten Son of God, and borne of the Father before all Worlds; God of God,
Light of Light, true God of true God; begotten, not made, of the same substance
with the Father, by whom all things were made; who, for us Men, and for our
salvation, came down from Heaven, and was incarnate by the holy Ghost of the
Virgin Marie, and was made Man: was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate;
suffered, and was buried; and rose again the third day according to the
Scriptures, and ascended up into Heaven; sits at the right hand of the
Father; and he shall come again with glory, to judge both the Live and the
Dead; of whose Kingdom there shall be no end. And in the holy Ghost, our Lord
and giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son; who with the
Father and the Son, is together adored and conglorified, who spoke by the
Prophets: And one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. I confess one
Baptism for the remission of sins; and I expect the resurrection of the
Dead, and the Life of the World to come. Amen.

I do most steadfastly admit and embrace the Traditions of the Apostles, and of
the Church, and all other obseruances and Constitutions of the same Church. I
do likewise admit the holy Scripture, according to that sense, which our holy
Mother the Catholic Church has holden, and does hold, unto whom it does
appertain to judge of the true sense, and interpretation of the holy
Scriptures; neither will I ever understand, nor interpret the same otherwise,
then according to the uniform consent of the Fathers.

I do also profess, that there be truly and properly seven Sacraments of the
new Law, instituted by Jesus Christ our Lord, and necessary for the salvation
of Mankind (although they be not necessary for all men,) to wit, Baptism,
Confirmation, Euchariste, Penance, Extreme Unction, Order, and Matrimony; and
that these Sacraments do give Greece; and that of them, Baptism, Confirmation,
and Order, cannot be reiterated without Sacrilege. I do also receive, and
admit all the received and approved Ceremonies of the Catholic Church, in the
solemn administration of all the aforesaid Sacraments. I do embrace and
receive all, and every of those things, which in the holy Council of Trent
have been defined, and declared, touching Original sin and Justification. I
do profess also, that in the Mass is offered unto God, a true, proper, and
propitiatory Sacrifice for the Live and Dead; and that in the most holy
Sacrament of the Altar, there is truly, really, and substantially, the body and
blood, together with the Soul and Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ; and that
there is made a Conversion of the whole substance of Wine into the Blood; which
Conversion, the Catholic Church does call Transubstantiation. I do also
confess, that under either kind only, is received Christ, whole, entire, and
the true Sacrament.

I do constantly hold, that there is Purgatory; and that the souls which be
there detained, are helped by their Prayers of the faithful. Also, that the
Saints, who reign together with Christ, are to be worshipped, and called
upon, and that they offer up prayers to God for us, and that their Relics are
to be worshipped. I do most steadfastly affirm, that the Images of Christ, of
the Mother of God always Virgin, and of other Saints, are to be had and
received, and that due honor and reverence is to be given to them. I do
affirm, that the authority of Indulgences, was left by Christ in the Church,
and that the use of them is very behoofefull for Christian people. I do
acknowledge the holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church, to be the Mother
and Mistress of all Churches, and do promise and swear true obedience to the
Bishop of Rome, who is the Successor of Saint Peter Prince of the Apostles,
and the Vicar of Jesus Christ. All other things defined and declared by the
holy Canons and Ecumenical Councels, and chiefly by the holy Council of
Trent, I do undoubtedly receive and profess. And also all contrary things, and
whatsoever heresies condemned, rejected, and accursed by the Church, I likewise
do condemn, reject and accurse.

This true Catholic Faith, without which no man can be saved, which now I do
willingly profess and hold, I the same I. N. do promise, vow, and swear to
hold, and confess most constantly, by Gods help, entire, and uncorrupted,
even to the last end of my life; and to procure, as much as shall lie in me^,
that my subjects, or those of whom I shall have care in my office, shall
accordingly teach, and preach the same: So God me help, and these holy Gospels
of God.

they are namelesse almost all of them, but not worthless, and impossible to be
counterfeited by us, being written many hundred of years before our times, as
the writing shows, and are all given to the Public Library, and are there to
be read of all men.
