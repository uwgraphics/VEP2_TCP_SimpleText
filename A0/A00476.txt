A most notable and worthy example of an ungracious Son, who in the pride of
his heart denied his own Father: and how God for his offense turned his meat
into loathsome Toades. To the tune of Lord Darley.
IN searching famous Chronicles,
it was my chance to reed.
A worthy story strange and true,
whereto I took good heed:
Betwixt a Farmer and his Son,
this rare example stands:
Which well may move the hardest hearts
to weep and wring their hands.
This Farmer in the Country dwelt,
whose substance did excel:
He sent therefore his eldest Son
in Paris for to dwell:
Where he became a Merchant man,
and traffic great he vsd,
So that he was exceeding rich,
till he himself abusd.
For having now the world at will,
his mind was wholly bent,
To gaming, wine, and wantonness,
till all his goods were spent:
Yea such excessive riotousnesse,
by him was spewed forth,
That he was threi times more in debt
then all his wealth was worth.
At length his credit clean was cract
and he in prison cast:
And every man against him then,
did set his action fast.
There lay he lock in Irons strong,
for ever and for aye,
Unable while his life did last,
his grievous debts to pay.
And lying in this careful case,
his eyes with tears besprent,
The lewdnes for his former life,
too late he did repent.
And being void of all relief,
of help and comfort quite,
Unto his Father at the last,
he thus began to write.
Bow down a while your heedful ears
my loving Father dear,
And grant I pray in gracious sort,
my pittious plaintes to hear.
Forgive the soul offenses all
of thy unthrifty Son:
which through the lewdnes of his life,
has now himself undone.
O my good Father take remorce,
on this my extreme need:
And succor his distressed state,
whose heart for woe does bleed,
In doleful dungeon here I lie,
my feet in fetters fast:
Whom my most cruel creditors,
in Prison so have cast.
Let pity therefore pearce your breast,
and mercy move your mind,
And to release my misery,
some shift sweet Father find.
My chiefest cheer is bread full brown
the boordes my softest bed:
And flinty stones for pillowes serves
to rest my troubled head.
My garments all are worn to rags,
my body statues with cold:
And crawling vermin eats my flesh,
most grievous to behold.
Dear Father come therefore with speed
and rid me out of thrall,
And let me not in prison die,
since for your help I call.
The good old man no sooner had,
perusde this written scrowle:
But trickling tears along his cheeks
from watery eyes did roll:
Alas my Son, my Son quoth he
in whom I ioyed most:
Thou shall not long in prison be,
what ever it does cost.
Two hundred heads of well fed beasts
he changed then for gold:
Four hundred quarters eke of corn,
for silver there he sold.
But all the same could not suffize,
that heinous debt to pay:
Till he at length constrained was,
to sell his land away.
Then was his Son released quite,
his debt discharged clean,
And left likewise as well to live,
as he before had been.
Then went his loving Father home,
who for to help his Son,
Had sold his living quite away,
and eke him self undone.
So that he lived poor and bare,
and in such extreme need,
That many times he wanted food,
his hungry corpse to feed:
His Son mean time in silks did swim
whose substance now was such:
That sure within the City walls,
few men were found so rich.
But as his goods did still increase,
and riches in did slide,
So more and more his hardened heart,
did swell in hateful pride:
But it befell upon a time,
when ten years woe was past,
Unto his Son he did repair,
for some relief at last.
And being come unto his house,
in very poor array,
It chanced so that with his Son,
great states should dine that day.
The poor old man with Hat in hand,
did then the Porter pray,
To show his Son that at the gate,
his Father there did stay.
Whereat this proud disdainful wretch
with taunting speeches said,
That long ago his Fathers boones,
within the grave was laid:
What Rascal then is that quoth he,
that stayneth so my state?
I charge thee Porter presently
to drive him from my gate.
Which answer when ye old man heard
he was in mind dismayde:
He wept, he waild, he wrong his hands
and thus at length he said.
O cursed wretch, and most unkind,
thou worker of my woe:
Thou monster to humanity,
and eke thy Fathers foe.
Have I bin careful of thy case,
maintayning still thy state:
And do thou now so doggedly,
enforce me from thy gate?
And have I wronged thy brethren all
from thrall, to set thee free?
And brought my self to beggars state
and all to succor thee.
Woe worth the time when first of all
thy body I espide:
Which have in hardness of thy heart,
the Fathers face denide.
But now behold how God that time,
did show a wonder great,
Even when his son with all his friends
were settled down to meat.
For when the fairest Pie was cut,
a strange and dreadful case,
Most ugly Toads came crawling out
and leaped in his face.
Then did the wretch his fault confess
and for his Father sent,
And then his great ingratitude,
full sore he did repent.
All virtuous Children learn by this,
obedient hearts to show:
And honor still your Parents dear,
for God commands so,
And think how God did turn his meat
to poysond Toades indeed:
Which did his Fathers face deny,
because he stood in need.
FINIS.
