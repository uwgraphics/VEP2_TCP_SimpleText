AN HVMBLE Petition offered to the right reverend, honorable, and worshipful
estates of this present Parliament assembled at Westminster Palace: Wherein
the wandering Ghost of the late Pyramid demolished lately in Paris, discourses
his hard fortunes, travails, and strange accidents to the new Britain
Monarchy, to whom he wishes all peace, wealth, and prosperity.

Written by Philopatris, pitying his downfall, and persuading his new
erecting, and building up again in Westminster.



At London Printed for Matthew Lownes. 1606.

To ancient and famous Troynovant.
WIth sunburnd Afrike Europe bore debate,
And France with fertile Egypt did contend;
With Memphis old Lutetia strove of late,
For Monuments; but now that strife has end:
The Pyramies of Paris do decay,
But Memphis stones remain and stand for aye.
Shall Afrike thus triumph in Europes shame?
Can Britain brave, endure so great disgrace?
No, Troynovant; fly thou on wings of fame,
From Memphis both, and Paris take thou place:
Build monuments, in spite of Popish fire,
Which Afrike both, and Asia may admire.
To the high Court of Parliament.
AFter that my sudden downfall and unexpected overthrow (most ancient and
famous great Britain) was plotted secretly in Rome, prepared cunningly in
France, and executed ignominiously not long since by public authority in
the chief City of the French Kingdom. This favor yet I had for my
continual and faithful service done to so great a King and State, that some
of my dearest friends and favorers (whose long pleadings in Law, strong
reasons in equity, and earnest suit in Court nothing prevailing for the saving
of my faultlesse and innocent life) should be permitted at last after my
death, to gather together the fatal relics and ruins of my sumptuous
builded corpse, to be secretly laid up in some sure place, there to be shrouded
unto a better and more favorable age following, from the cruel persecution of
my bloody Esauiticall enemies, seeking and pursuing (like unto Herod through
all Judah) from corner to corner for the anatomy of my bruised bones, to be
offered up as a sweet smelling sacrifice to that Antichristian and bloody
Dragon, who daily thirsts for the poor lives of such harmless creatures as
I am, manifesting to the world his foul shame, and monstrous parts. But may it
not seem ouer-strange and marvelous to the eyes and ears of the world, that
dumb and insensible creatures should speak and cry out of cruel injustice
used against them? Mervailous indeed it is, because against nature, but not
therefore untrue nor yet unlikely, considering what the Prophets have truly
foretold, how in the latter days there should many miraculous things fall
out, and wonderful visions appear, both in heaven and earth. And surely (thou
new Monarchy) the eclipse of the Sun seen here of late, with the new
star, but more likely a prodigious Co^met in thy Hemisphere, the
extraordinary rednes of the firmament like to blood, the continual raines and
land floods, the monstrous births of children, and beasts on the earth, and of
fishes in the Sea; but more notable, that a new and unknown Astrologer in his
Prognostication set out in our City of Paris, should fore-shew such strange
and incredible matters to come to pass, three months before this wonderful
accident was known among you, to wit, that this year 1605 here should be a
turbulent Parliament, a black Christmas, and a bloody Lent. Did not all these
things agreeing as it were, and conspiring together speak and fore-warne you
(beloved great Britain) even as they had been reasonable creatures, of the
great disastre likely to fall out, coming to my ears. Mervaile not then, if I
that had my erection established by the sound advisement and firm decree of
the gravest, wisest, and most learned Parliament of the world, and perfected by
the sacred influence and infusion of all the Muses through every member of my
body, and life given to me by my Sovereign King, to witness the safety of
his life, should not as well speak, at least my Ghost, as did the counterfeit
spirit of Samuel, and rather to be better thought of, then it, because both my
warrant and cause is approovedly good. But while I stood long time in a muse,
pondering betwixt hope and despair, what should become of my wandering soul,
and at length, thinking with my self, to find out some Pythagorean
Philosophers (if any were yet alive) for consulting, what body should be
fittest for my receptacle; certain my loving friends in this time, inspired
(as the sequel shall testify) with some divine instinct, convayed me safely
to great Britains Ocean Sea: where Neptune receaving me courteously at their
hands, commanded Aeolus with his fairest and readiest winds safely and
speedily to transport me from that dangerous shore I was on, to the famous
Microcosme of ancient Britain, the great Conqueror, sometime of my ingrate
Country, as to the chief harbor of all poor distressed Pilgrims. But while
Aeolus was preparing all things necessary for my safe conduct, Neptune willed
me, briefly to report the causes of my sudden flight and departure from my
native Country, which though at first I was in doubt what to do, as fearing
that he might either bewray me to mine enemies, when I had told him all, or
might stop my passage, if I told him not, at last I resolved upon all hazards
that might follow, to satisfy his demand, as far forth, as the shortness of
the time, and peril of the place would permit. Then thus I spoke unto him. The
causes that have compeld me (O great Neptune, thou great God of the Ocean) to
seek thy favor in this my misery, are truly and upon my alleagiance unto
thee, the extreme and more then inhumane persecutions of my bloody enemies
the Jesuits both before, and since my lamentable and undeserved death and
overthrow, procured for no other cause, then for truly witnessing to the world,
but more particularly to true Catholic Hugonets, and to all foreign
Strangers who might daily behold me in the prime of my tryumphant estate, in
the most famous City and place of the universal world, how this mighty King
and martial Monarch Henry the fourth, that now reigns, was treacherously
wounded, but yet miraculously preserved of his life, from the Esauitical plot
executed by Chattell one of the novices, trained up in their tragical School
erected lately for teaching of bloody precepts, for the killing of all such
Kings and Princes, as being either Romanists or true Christians, shall be
stumbling blocks to hinder the politic courses of their new established
Machiavillian Government. Me miserum vox faucibus haeret I cannot utter the one
half I would say, such have I have to be gone for the fear and danger I am
in, by the furious pursuit of my professed enemies, who tyrannouslie triumphing
in mine overthrow, mangled all the members of my body as was pitiful to see,
and yet not so satisfied, will not suffer my broken bones, no, nor my very
Ghost to remain in rest or safety within any part of this ample Kingdom.
These men (or to speak more properly monsters of men) being justly (and as
deservedly, as ever any the most heinous malefactors that ever were)
bannished out of this Realm by a general decree of Parliament, without hope
of being ever recalled home, or to creep again into any grace or favor of
my great Sovereign, which they had so foulely forfaited, are now again (a
wonder it is to hear) after a few years exile, come not submissiuely, but
triumphantly home, glorying in the spoils of my heavy and sad fall; dying;
and lying prostrate at their proud feet. And thus are they grown into great
credit and authority by the distraction of my Sovereigns late singular
favor toward me, which I surely hoped, should, nay could never have been
withdrawn, being so fast tied and conglutinate to my person, as a public
decree of the wisest humane wits could devise, and engraven besides in letters
of Gold and Azure, for the more honor and ornament to us both. But what shall I
say, Nibi sub coelo durabile, et Regum gratia saepe mutabilis: For my crafty
enemies had so closed up and stopped the princely ears of my Sovereign
(which should have been open alike to all Complayners) with a fine and subtle
kind of black Cotton cunningly wrought by the finest and most expert
Esauiticall Artificers that were in all Italy and Spain, who bore his
Majesty in hand, that my bruised bones broken all to pieces would be the most
effectual preservatiue for resisting all pestilent venom of such Heretics,
as should oppose themselves against the wholesome and sound reestablishment of
the Jesuits, adding moreover (no small falsehoode) that these would prove
hereafter the most profitable and serviceable people unto him, that were under
his obeisance. So my dread Liege being fully possessed by little and little
with the sly insinuations of this counterfeit Cotton, neither the credit of
sundry of his faithful Counsailors, neither the weighty arguments of the
most grave and iuditious Presidents of his Parliament, nor the eloquence and
smooth reasons of learned Advocates, neither the subtle inventions and
scholastic Sophistry of the Sorbonist Doctors, nor the pittious plaints of
poor Scholars, who delighted their eyes, refreshed their minds, and filled
their papers and books with the learned Muses that guarded my square body;
all these my favorers, I say, and continual intercessours could prevail
nothing with my dread Sovereign, whose pity my enemies had captiuated wholly
to their cruelty and malice, that no place was left for prayers, nor means
any longer for my continuance there, but Discere dura pati, and comfort my
self with that encouragement that virtuous Aeneas gave to his Sea-beaten
Soldiers. Durato et temet rebus seruato secundis.

Pluck up thy heart, and drive from thee
both care and fear away:
To think of this, may pleasure be
to thee another day.
Thus remained then no other comfort to me, near half dead before hand
through despair, but that of necessity (as I well perceaved) it behooved one
to die for the sins of this people, and who should that be, but even I poor
Pyramid, who not long before, had life with the promise of a long life, (but
what mortal men can promise life to another, that are not assured of their
own) given unto me, for recording their barbarous cruelty, and now again
must loose my life, even in that place, alas, where I first received life, and
for no other thing, then for testimony of the truth, and to give them a surer
and longer life by my speedy death, and withal a greater honor and credit by
my downfall, then ever they had since their first original, or ever could
hope for themselves in this world. And thus is the world there turned topsie
turvie: The good and faithful are taken away, and and the wicked and
ungracious are hoysted up in their rooms. O scelus, O mores, O tempora
perversa in quibus vixi. O poor and miserable wretch that I am, what have I
committed, that I should suffer so cruel a punishment? I have continued there
but a small time, considering the eternity of years I should have endured,
erected also in the most eminent place of our Monarchy, to the amazement of my
professed enemies; where I endured daily opprobrious railings and infamous
Pasquils on my frontispice, taxing both King, Counsel, Parliament, and State
for my sumptuous building in so famous a place, besides my nightlie danger (for
witnessing the decree of their bannishment for so infamous a fact) to be
dismembered, and by the Stir and tumults of their adherents pulled down
before the morrow, and that not perchance without the shedding of innocent
blood. All this and much more it behooved me to endure, yea and much more would
I patiently have suffered, so as I might have continued there, until I had
either received some recompense for my faithful service, or had been bestowed
in some other famous place, to have served for a perpetual memory of that
infamous treachery, that can never be forgotten.

Nec tamen annoru^ series, nec flamma, nec ensis,
Aeternum poterit hoc abolere scelus.
Thus ending my discourse to Neptune, and craving his favorable aid for my
passage to great Britain, my last and only refuge left unto me. The God
smiling spoke with a gracious countenance unto me, Fauet fortuna votis. And so
by the favor of Aeolus and the swift wings of his winds, I was upon the
sudden (before I could bethink my self where I was) set upon the white and
pleasant Britain Coast, where upon a green mountain, not far from the place
of my arrival, was first presented to my view, a goodly company of frollique
Shepherds, who as they drew somewhat near me, cast off their mourning
garments, which they had worn (as seemed) before, for the great and horrible
danger they apprehended by their long experience, knowledge, and insight of
the heavenly constellations and caelestiall signs, of some great fatal
coniurations plotted by Pluto and his Stygian furies, for the total subversion
of this ancient Kingdom and State, and were all presently clothed in white,
playing and singing sweet and melodious congratulalions, for the happy
deliverie both of their native Country from that great imminent peril, as
also for my fortunate arrival in so fit a season, whereby I might not only
testify to them my Countries cruelty, and her ingratitude toward me, but
that I might likewise in short success of time eternize my name, by offering
my service in publishing by open testimony both to the great and little World,
a more horrible and damnable fact, then before I served for. And so being a
little comforted and put in some good hope by this their news, my faint spirit
begins to take fresh courage, and to strengthen my weak limbs, so that I
began to march a faster pace, then before I was accustomed to, with desire to
learn more certainty of this news, which yet was a mystery unto me: and
casting mine eyes round about me, to see if I could discern any thing, I
perceaved betwixt me and the sky, being then the dawning of the day (before
Phoebus had sent abroad his rays for the clearing of the air with universal
light) the whole company of the sacred Muses adorned with their ever
flourishing green Laurel Garlands, who holding in their hands sundry and
several instruments of music, made the hills, valleys, and groves to resound
with their heavenly harmony, melodious Songs, sweet sonnets, and shrill
Echoes of their learned Poetical inventions in all languages; and all this
they did to signify the exceeding joy they had lately conceaved of the thrice
happy deliverance of that their great friend, darling, and favourer, the most
wise, prudent, learned, mighty, worthy, and in all heroical virtues and
valor, the most rare and great Apollo, whom Mars that stern God of bloody
battle evermore envied and hated even to the death, for no other cause (as
can be coniectured, or as I could learn out of their rare Ditties and
Sonnets) then only, for that he was entered into a sincere league and sweet
society of the caelestiall Graces, the devine Muses, and sacred Peace,
(whereto he was preordayned at the very hour of his nativitie) and thereby,
and by means of the common tranquillity thereof ensuing, had brought and
deduced from above, into this little world, and from thence derived to all the
most famous parts of the great world, such manifold and exceeding rich gifts,
bounteous favors, and invaluable benefits and blessings, as the like had
either seldom, or not at all been enjoyed in any former age, for which he
was (as he well deserved) universally admired, honored, and blessed over all.
And therefore the greater indignation boiled in the breast of angry Mars, who
ever more grudging at humane felicity, left no means or ways unsought or
vnatte^pted, whereby to bring our great Patron and Benefactor, and
consequently this little world to confusion. And such was his innated hatred
against him, even when he was yet in his Mothers belly, knowing by the
favorable aspects of Sol and Venus, that he should prove a most potent,
prudent, wise, and blessed Prince of Peace, beloved both of Gods and me^, that
he this wicked Mars set on his cruel Sergeant the elder Gowrie to have
murdered that most noble Heroine the Queen his mother, and this blessed fruit
of her womb, at one stab. And being prevented by divine providence of his
malignitie, in this his abominable intention, after many other mischievous
plots and practices (all of them, as all other shall ever be made frustrate by
the high hand of just Joue) he conspired with that variable Aeolus GOD of the
winds (who either by fair means, or sharp menaces of any great Power is
lightly won to work the worst mischief he can) to give full scope and free
license to his turbulent and unruly winds, at such time, as our bright
day star Apollo having accomplished the notable solemnity of those famous
nuptials in the strong Dacian Kingdom, the middle Region of Europa, with his
peerless Paragon, of all rich perfection the divine Cynthia (otherwise then
by himself immatchable) had imbarqued him with his most lovelie beloved above
all other, sailing from thence through the Ocean, toward his ancient Kingdom
the lesser Albion, lying to the north of Albion mayor, (now both by his Highness
happily reduced to one Monarchy) then was seen the boisterous rage of
blustering Boreas and his rude companions, domineering with might and maine
uncontrolled in Neptunes maine dominion, (but without that great Gods assent or
knowledge) as sometime by the like permission of their flexible Master Aeolus at
the request of angry Juno, they practiced the like peremptory pranks
(unwitting to Neptune) upon the virtuous and valorous Prince Aeneas in the
Tyrrhene Seas. So that colleaguing themselves with that great Sorceresse Circe,
and a great number of her most impious and detestable impes, all practicing to
drown and destroy our Apollo and his fairest Cynthia with all their noble
train (as after upon their conviction they freely confessed) they sturdilie
heaved, tossed, and tumbled the fearful billows, hoysing one while his
drearie ships upon the high-raised waves almost to the azure sky, and then
throwing them down again as low as the foundations of the earth. Yet
notwithstanding all their furious tumults, and violent commotions, Almighty
Joue (whose name be therefore magnified for ever) beholding this outrageous
tempest, and knowing the wicked occasion thereof; brought them safe and sound
to their own desired continent and Country. Which, when Mars understood, he
sta^ped and stared, foming at the mouth, and his eyes sparkling like fire for
very anger, that his conspiracy prevailed not, he fared like a mad man, and
vowing still to pursue him with immortal hatred, swore by the black river of
Stix, that his day of Mars whereon he was born, should ever prove the most
fatal day of all other unto him. And for that purpose he combined himself
with Pluto that dreadful Prince of Erebus, who complotting together, brought it
so to pass under cunning policies and fair shows of great matters, that
co^cerned his own person, state, and Kingdom, to bring him by the earnest
labor of one of his dear favorites, to the dishonorable and disloyal house
of the other Sergeant of Mars the younger and last Gowry, the bloody nephew of
a cruel traiterous Grandsire, where having locked him up in a close room in
the hands of their sworn friends, his mortal enemies, he had no way nor means
to escape, but even miraculously by his own stout manhood, or rather Heroic
magnamitie, and the succor of a few of his faithful servants, but chiefly
again by the almighty providence of high Joue, waiting over him, at all times
and places for his safeguard, he was also delivered out of that danger. Then
were Mars and Pluto more enraged then ever before, gnashing their teeth, and
cursing and banning the fiends and furies, that had no more policy or power
to accomplish their infernal plot, they were almost at a point to have given
over any longer pursuit of their co^spiracies, but that Pluto bethought
himself of his dear son the red and bloody Dragon, who through long and
continual practice for many ages, of all sorts of hellish stratagems, horrible
massacres, black murders, deceitful lies, and false miracles was grown to
be as much famed and feared in the world, as himself, so as it might be a
question disputable in Schools, whether Satan the roaring and devouring Lion,
or his son the Pope, that red and bloody Dragon was to be held for the
greatest and chiefest lier and murderer. Pluto therefore crying out, Flectere
si nequeo superos, Acheronta mouebo, they began to be recomforted in his dear
son, of their wicked hopes and divellish drifts for the acting of their
bloody Tragedy, (as the last hope of all their mischiefs). And so adjoining
themselves to this other great enemy of man's welfare, who was exceeding proud
to have the mannaging of that action referred to him, wherein the Prince of
Devils had failed, conceived presently a more horrible plot, then all the
Stygian furies called together in a common Counsel could have devised, not
only against the sacred person and life of Apollo, but also his divine
Cynthia, and all their Godlike progeny, and all the Heroes, Prelates, Nobles,
Statesmen, and chief Gentry under his Domination; all whom, and many more, by
force of his invention, he made sure account to have destroyed upon that
ominous day of Mars, with one blow of his fatal engine. Which complot he gave
in charge for the more surety to certain of his trusty Enginers the
Esauiticall band (whose charge, profession, and practice, is nothing else but
the undermining and blowing up of Princes, great States, and Kingdoms) to see
the same with all secret conveyance and diligence put in execution. Never
before was heard of, the like inhumane stratagem, though many cunning and
cruel conspiracies proceeding from this terrible Dragon, had often been
attempted against our Apolloes Predecessor, his most honored and hallowed
virgin sister, the great and mighty Diana, whom he most maliced and hated
deadly above any other Potentate on the earth, for that she as a most
virtuous and courageous Princess, and Faiths valorous Championess, had not
only given to him a wide and dangerous wound, that still, and still shall
ever to his dying day put him to most grievous pain; but also destroyed a
great number of mischievous monsters that were conceaved and crept forth out of
his foul mouth. All his practices notwithstanding, and though he did the very
worst he could, could nothing prevail against her most blessed life, reign,
state, and government, but that for 44 years together and upward, while she
ruled the famous Kingdom of Albion mayor, to the high pleasure of Almighty
Joue, a more flourishing and blessed estate was there seen, then was ever
heard of in those times, when divine Astraea lived and ruled among earthly men.
And in this mean time, while as the Almighty God perceaving this earthly
Kingdom of her most happy and gracious Majesty, to be compassed and clogged
with so many daily conspiracies and dangers, and that her sacred person having
by the due course of nature run out, and ended the glass of her thrice
happy and most renowned government; than it pleased him in his great and
loving favor and mercy (most happily and peaceably without any danger or
disturbance to her well long governed Kingdoms) to translate her hence to the
highest Imperial heaven, there to live and reign in the greatest glory with
his Angels to all eternity. Constituting in her place this our Apollo, whom
he has predestined to vanquish, and finally destroy this monstrous red
Dragon, whereby he shall purchase so much the greater glory and immortal
renown to himself, then did the old Apollo, by killing the huge serpent
Python, by how much this Dragon is a thousand fold more great, virulent,
violent, terrible, strong, and horrible then that was. This is the great cause
indeed, why Mars fretteth, Pluto fumeth, the Dragon rages, and all jointly
conioyne and conspire with all their forces against the life and state of
Apollo, for whose most happy preservation from all their intended mischiefs;
the melodious Muses sang Jo Pean, with many heavenly notes (sweeter far
then the concentfull harmony of the sphericall Orbs) full of joy and triumph.
But reserving the residue of the rarest and secretest matter of their divine
songs, until I shall see the end of my travailes, I will briefly show, what
further befell me. Thus being hereby somewhat more confirmed of the truth of
so wonderful news, and advauncing my steps forward to see the end and
success of these strange incounters, I cast my sleepie eyes here and there
(the day being all spent, and black and raynie clouds covering the bright
stars in the firmament) when lo in an instant, there appeared to me, as it
were Vulcan in fiery sparks and shining flames of great burning fires,
environing me on all parts, where I went. I misdoubting at first, that Vulcan
and Pluto had conspired the burning of the whole Island I was entered into,
resolved with my self (if it were possible) to return and escape so great and
imminent a danger. But being soon advertised, that the matter was nothing so,
as I supposed, but that these fires were kindled only for joy, according to
the commendable custom of this Island, when any good news happens to the
State, or Country: Behold, I was no sooner rid of this fear and perplexity,
but that I might see three several Currors of sundry nations (as appeared by
their cognizances on their breast) going for France, Spain, and Jtalie, and
seemed to be very passionate and sad by their countenance and carriage,
whither it were for the ill success of the plot then discovered, or for that
they feared, the passages were all stopped, so as they could not give the first
advertisement to their Masters, I leave them to your good and friendly
consideration (great Britain) who can better judge in their matters, and tell
by the Weathercocke what quarter the wind holds, the^ I poor Pilgrim. Yet
thus far I can say of them, that their courtesy and favor was such to me a
poor stranger, that they could not afford me one Aue, but making sighs, and
crosses upon their faces and breasts, looked and beckened so on me, as to a
Hugonet. But I sore fearing, that they had been Sergeants at arms sent after
me for my apprehension, where soever they might find me, was glad to make a
low curtsie, and pass by them, with as much speed as my weary feet could
carry me, and having posted a mile further (without once looking back) It was
my good hap to meet with two English Posts, bearing the red rampant Lion on
their breasts; who were so full of indignation, as that after my double
salutations, they could not for anger speak unto me, and showing a sad and
sorrowful countenance, whither it were, that the stranger Posts had got the
start of them, or fearing that thorough favor they might get passage before
them, to carry the first news to their Masters, and other foreign Princes,
or for what other cause I know not, nor was it fit for me, being a stranger and
a bannished Pilgrim to be nimis curiosus in aliena republica. Yet staying, and
viewing one another more nearlie, I began to remember my self, that I had
seen these two English Posts oftentimes not only pass by me in their going
to the Palace of Paris, but that they had bin also accustomed theretofore, in
pointing out their fingers to me, as to a rare miracle, to show to their
Country men newly come over, my whole Genealogy, birth, and memorable story:
And on the other side, one of the^ being well travaild in all Countries, by his
employment in the service of the late renowned Queen your Lady, and given
withal to the observations of antiquities abroad, drew out his books of those
matters, which he ever carried about him into foreign parts, and turning the
leaves over, he finds the whole discourse of my life, which pondering to and
fro in his mind, he begins to look on me more nearly and circumspectly, and
(the architecture of my stately building being yet fresh in his memory) he
fell somewhat to bless himself, and after to crave pardon of the oversight,
(as he said) of his duty to me, by who^ he had received so many courtesies for
his Country me^, and other strangers while I stood alive, and in credit with
the great Princes and Peers of the Realm of France, then both of the^ with a
laughing countenance striving which of them should first embrace and welcome me,
were so astonished at my presence, as they stood in doubt, whither they should
rejoice at my coming over, or lament for my exile and hard fortune, I was
fallen into. But yet upon better advise, they rejoiced rather, that it had
pleased the mighty Jehouah, to bring me safe into this famous Island, and that
I had arrived in the best opportunity, that ever could have been wished,
affirming that Gods great and miraculous providence was so favorable unto me,
that whereas my sworn and cruel Esauiticall enemies hoped to have triumphed in
my late down-cast, and consequently have buried me in everlasting oblivion,
they should now be frustrate of their ungodly hopes, saying thus unto me. Be of
good comfort renowned Pyramid, thou shall be more welcome to this our new
Monarchy, then were thy enemies to their home-caller and restorer; and whereas
thou were permitted there to stand scarce the space of the fourth part of an
age, in thy glorious Trophee, as a witness of two teeth stricken out of the
mouth of the Lords anointed, and for preserving one King, which their novice
and parricide Chattell had intended to have killed, and for putting but one
Kingdom in danger of forfaiture to the Pope their Creator, which before in
color of a false presupposed right, he pretended he had given to the holy
Leaguers, and their coniured adherents, by excommunicating that your sacred
Monarch; we doubt not, but here thou shall shortly serve for a greater use,
and more glorious end, to be erected as a witness and perpetual Record of
the wonderful and thrice happy deliverie of our great and sacred King the
rarest and most learned King that ever bare Scepter either in this Island, or
in any age present, or past; of his most gracious Queen that shall be by the
loving favor of the Almighty, the joyful and blessed mother of many Kings
and Queens; his tender and dear son and heir, a Prince of the greatest
hope of his age; the rest of his royal Progeny, all the reverend Bishops,
grave Counsailours, and Judges, all the ancient Nobility, Gentillity, and
Burgesses chosen and deputed for Commissioners to a solemn Parliament, and of
many thousand more that were attendant to that solemnity, and of a number of
foreign Ambassadors, if they had come thither, as was supposed, they should;
All these, and many more, which were all in a moment to have been blown up, by
a false and cruel Fox, (for so was his name) sent forth out of some of the
Popes dens, or rather Plutoes dungeons, to kill, rent, and blow up all the
innocent and simple sheep of Christ's Fold, in this new established Monarchy,
at one blow. This was one of the Popes Cannons, that has been making this
year and half, by his finest and most subtile-pated Artificers, which he had
hired for this horrible work of his, and this blow should have been given by
such a small Cannon, that was charged with no more then 34 great barrels of
powder, and with 24 stone of gad Iron for her bullet. All the thundering Ca^nons
forged and made in the bloody Counsel of Trent were not so dangerous, as this
one was. And yet true it is, that a few of these Cannons of Trent blew up in
Paris in one night, and one morning ten thousand people, besides 20000 they
blewe up in other Towns a little after, where one barrel of powder furnished
all those Cannons. But the greatest difference was this, they there killed but
thousands of poor Hugonets, but here they aimed their murdring shot against
King, Queen, Prince, Dukes, Earls, Barons, Prelates, Counsailours, Judges,
and Gentillitie of the Land; there they preserved Houses, Palaces, Chapels,
and Schools; but here they would have blown up the most stately buildings,
Churches, Palaces, and Schools that pertained to the Crown, yea the treasure
and Records of the Kingdom; there they spoiled the living only, but here
they would have burnt and blown up the sacred and dead bodies of the famous
Kings, Co^querours, Queens, and Princes, sleeping in their sumptuous Toombs,
as the rich and costly beds of their last honors they had here upon the
earth. There they imagined by killing of King Henry the third, and wounding the
fourth Henry, to have wrought the overthrow and desolation of one ancient
Kingdom; but here of three several most ancient and warlike Kingdoms of
Christendom. But having not leisure to stand on more particulers, what shall I
say to thee (O thou thrice happy exiled Pyramid) of these their never before
invented cruelties. Talia horret meminisse animus. O this wicked treachery,
and false perjury of theirs! O cruel conspiracy, and Grecian perfidie! O
Sathanicall enimitie, and more then Neronian cruelty! O Scythian barbarity,
and Iudaisme infidelity! O Gentilisme vanity, and more the^ Heathenish
impiety! and finally, O poisoned Papisticall idolatry of theirs, proceeding
from their blind and devilish devotion, the ground of their abominable and
hellish treason. The treacherous conspiracy of wicked Ha^mon that he wrought
against the Jews, to have had them all killed in one day, wheresoever they
should be found in the vast Dominions of the great Monarch Assuerus, is not
co^parable to this: Nor the cruelty of Mithridates, who in one night and a day
killed thirty thousand Romans: Nor the tyranny of wicked Nero who killed his
mother, his master, and that burnt almost whole Rome the chief City of the
world, with a number of other cruelties that he committed: Nor the
bloud-thirstie mind and wicked desire to reign of Caligula, who wished the
whole Senate and chief men of the Roman Empire, to have had but one neck,
that he might have stricken it off at one blow: Neither the secret and
bloody conspiracy of treacherous Catiline, who had privilie plotted not
only the death of the whole Senate, and chief men of name in Rome, but also
had destinated the most of his own kindred to that cruel slaughter: Neither
the damnable Sicilians evening sacrifices committed by them upon the French
men: Nor the Mattens of Paris performed by the French themselves in massacring
their own Country men and dearest friends, can in no degree be matched with
this unnatural cruelty of theirs. And which is most strange how it could be,
all this their whole pernicious and detestable enterprise of our tyrannous
Traitors and cruel bloud-sucking Papists, that had been more then a year in
hatching, was so cunningly and secretly contrived and managed by the subtle
and Machiavillian practices of some few maleconted Gentlemen joined to the
Jesuits and Seminary Priests, who had the chief employment for matters both
of Counsel and execution, that it was brought forward unknown and vnrevealed
even to the space of a very few hours, before the time of putting the same in
execution; and according to the relation of the chief Counsailours of our
Estate, if the Almighty God had not miraculously made our gracious Sovereign,
by divine inspiration rather, then by humane wisdom and foresight, to cause
diligent inquiry to be made of such suspect places of the Parliament house,
as his Majesty greatly misdoubted after the reading of a mystical and
strange letter, out of the which, his Highness collected and apprehended more,
then a great part of his Counsel could, doubtless this monstrous contrived
treason would have sorted to that wicked destinated event. Therefore O
glorious, wise, and ever famous King, preserved we hope, for a greater work
of God, that by thy providence and sacred experiences have saved thy self, thy
succession and Kingdoms, a work which time and memory shall never deface,
but shall be eternized to the worlds end, to thy immortal glory and renown.
But O thou mighty Jehovah, to whom the highest glory shall be ascribed, that
so miraculously have preserved thy own anointed, and with him thy dear
Church, which was environed with such incomparable danger that never was heard
of before, neither was ever hatched the like by all the cursed brood of Satan,
until this never before expected wicked time. Thus ending his tragical
discourse, I became so astonished and amazed thereat, as I became speechless,
and as half dead, until these Currors began friendly to comfort me: assuring
me, that the Almighty of his great providence had brought me here, that
whereas my enemies the Jesuits and Seminary Priests, and their bloody
associates and followers, hoped to have gotten credit and eternal reputation
by the downe-cast of me poor Pyramid at home in Paris, that now I should be in
a sure way of preferment, by the gracious assistance of the most High, and the
favor and piety of the great, mighty, and religious Monarch, and this estate
of the new Monarchy, and little world, to receive here a greater glory and
honor by my new erection in so famous an ancient Country, and place, then
the disgrace I had in France by my overthrowe: and that where my enemies
intended to have raced out utterly all remembrance of me, they should make me
Jpsis invidis etiam nolentibus, to be more renowned then ever I was before, and
more infamy to redound to them in the succeeding ages, the^ did to Erastratus
that made himself infamous to this day, by burning that rare and sumptuous
temple of Diana in Ephesus, held for one of the seven mervailes of the world;
and whereas I had continued there scarce the quarter of a man's age, they hoped,
that I should stand here and, endure to the worlds end: and whereas I was
builded there in the ruins of a Merchants house, that here I should be
erected in the ruins of Plutoes destinated Palace, to stand as a witness of
their damnable plot for the perpetual ruin and downfall of many hundred
fair houses of Nobility and Gentry: and that where my erection was there
decreed by one Court of Parliament of Paris, consisting only of Presidents and
Lawyers, that here I should be ordained and confirmed by the Sovereign
Monarch, and three Estates of Parliament, solemnlie to stand in Amphitheatrick
form, after the ancient Roman manner. PROPTER REGEM, REGNVM, ET SVBDITOS
SERVATOS. For preserving the King, Kingdom, and Subjects, in that same place
where the fact and cruel conspiracy was intended to have been put in
execution. And thus having discoursed unto me this strange conspiracy, (of all
conspiracies that ever were the most capital) and encouraged me upon an
assurance of my advancement, they courteously took their leaves, after they
had directed me to the famous Abbey of Westminster, whitherward I hied me fast,
that there I might complain and lament among the graves of the dead, thereby to
move all zealous and well affected Britain Commissioners of all the three
States in Parliament, that detest the cruelty of so great and horrible a
crime, and hate the mischievous plotters of such heinous treason, to be
intercessors and petitioners to their dread Sovereign, for my erection and
advancement to the Office of High Recorder of the preservation of this new
Monarchy of great Britain, and that place no longer to be a
Parliament House, that was dedicated to Pluto and his infernal Furies, but
that I may succeed thereto, (after that it shall by a general decree be cast
down) as a just demolisher of that Stygian field. I say no more now for very
faintnes, but Misericordia Dei super omnia opera, giving thanks in the mean
time to the Author of my first life, and to him next, whosoever he be, that
has preserved my relics and broken bones to so happy a time, thereby to give
me a second life, as if I were a new Phoenix rising out of my burnt ashes, to
make the world hereafter wonder at, and detest more and more the cruelty of
the Pope that bloody Dragon, and his divelish children, and from terrifying
such miscreants ever hereafter in any age subsequent, to attempt the like
against the Lords anointed and his Church, fully persuading my self, that
this great work of the Lord in discovering so horrible a fact, by which, they
promised to themselves a final and infallible overthrow of Christ's Church, and
true religion in this Island, shall be the means by Gods wonderful favor and
judgment, that out of this Isle shortly shall march that mighty and fearful
Lion, that bears in his Scutchion that martial poesy Parcere subiectis, et
debellare superbos, who shall overthrowe the bloody Dragon, that Antichristian
beast, with all his whelps in his devouring den, and shall establish Gods
word there, which they purposed to have extinguished here. And I think
verily, that this is their last blow, that ever they shall be able to strike,
and which by the reverberating force of it shall be the most dangerous and
deadly to themselves, and for their own overthrow, yea sorer then Luthers,
that was the greatest wound that the Romish Antichristian Church received in
our memory, and which (as I trust) shall drive them in time to acknowledge
their wickedness and blindness, and to embrace the true faith in humility, and
to crave me pardon for my downe-cast and bannishment from my native Country.
And thus having made relation to thee (O renowned Monarchy of great Britain)
both of my passed and present fortunes, and of the strange accidents that have
hitherto happened unto me, I implore thy gracious aid and accustomed bounty
never denied to any oppressed stranger, in vouchsafing to become an earnest
intercessor for me, to the high and most sacred Majesty of thy great Sovereign
(in whose potencie, and your authority, the hope not only of my preferment,
but the certain accomplishment of all those great matters before spoken of,
assuredly consists) that I may be received and brought to the presence and
most comfortable favor of his princely mercies, that by the^ I may have a new
life breathed into me, and be preferred to that eminent place, where I may best
perform (as duty and thankfulness shall bind me) both to his Highness and thy
excellency, that worthy and faithful service, that shall never be but
exceedingly well thought, and highly commended to all posterity. And to my
auspitious mind, no fitter place for demo^stration of my dutiful service (I
speak not I protest out of ambition, or any vicious humor) can be assigned me,
the^ that Parliament house, which these Monsters of mankind, the Pope and his
miscreant crew had meant to have subverted and demolished by Plutoes and
Vulcans violent and boystrous fires and flashing thunderbolts, and so to have
made and consecrated it as a ruinous and fit Palace for the habitation of the
black infernal Prince, and his damned spirits and Ministers of darkness. But
that I may with the greater right, and without cavil of curious or captious
heads stand there aucthorized, Let me also request this favor at your hands
(most mighty Monarchy) to move and stir up the well affected minds and fiery
zeales of the States of your Parliament, that at the next Session, I being as
yet but an Alian here, may by Statute and decree be naturalized, and
infranchized as a borne subject within your territory, and so thereafter to be
erected and stand in the place that was destinated for Plutoes Palace, as a
perpetual monument and Record of this horrible conspiracy, and of thine, and
our Monarchs most happy co^servation, and as a caveat to the ages following of
the Papistical treasons of the Romish Church, which I hope shall shortly
infer an end to that long usurped tyrannical reign. And so persuading my
self, that if neither my poor and pittious distressed estate; neither the
fine eloquence of the bannished Pyramid it self, speaking to you in his own
French language: newly set forth in your own tongue, cannot persuade you to
immortalize your own deliverie from the greatest apparent danger that ever
befell to you. I say, if this above mentioned reason, cannot move you to
testify in some measure, the earnest desire you have to make this notable
deliverie of GOD to be known to the ages subsequent by my public erecting
again in a glorious Pyramid, by testifying your inward tha^kfulnes to him by
this outward monument for your preservation: Yet I beseech you, although I seem
perchance a stranger in outward show, suffer me nevertheless as a loving
Patriark and simpathizing Christian, in the common cause, that these two great
and wonderful works of the Almighty God, (may at least move and touch your
hearts, from the highest degree to the lowest, from the head to the body, and
so to all the members of this your Monarchy) I mean his great mercy toward
you all, and his fearful judgment against your enemies in this never to be
forgotten thrice happy and admirable deliverie. His mercy, I say, appears
not only in discovery of your danger, but in disappointing of their cruel
Parricide, and in preserving your lives from the snares of the bottomless
Locusts of hellish Babylon, his judgment again in the other part is to be
admired, in suffering a great part of them to be apprehended, and made a
perpetual spectacle to all posterity, by a just and most severe punishment,
and the chiefest of them to have suffered that same cruelty of punishment, by
Gunpowder, which they ordained for your death. Psalm. 17.
Blessed therefore be the Lord of Hosts in all his works, for his mercies be
everlasting, and his judgments unsearchable. And let this again be your
morning and evening sacrifice, recommended to all Christians of mercy and of
judgment both, O Lord, Psalm, 10^.
my song shall be: But if all this cannot persuade you to erect me for a
public Monument of your deliverie, yet let the godly example of Abraham,
Jsaack and Jacob, stir you up to this, who in their often deliveries and
favors received at the hands of God, erected both Altars and Momuments of
stones, as witnesses of Gods inestimable favors and blessings toward them, to
their posterity; and seeing also that, that spiritual Monument of public
prayers religiously ordained by his sacred Majesty to be celebrated through
all his Kingdoms, for stirring up of all men's affections in thankfulness to
GOD, appears almost in the very beginning to be neglected, both in Court,
Country, and City; at least permit then the erection of this temporal and
material Monument, to be an occasion and a means not only to lift up your
external eyes to GOD, but also rather to lift up the eyes of your minds and
hearts to the memory of GODS mercy toward you all, and of his judgment
upon your enemies. I could speak far more in this so ample and worthy
Subject, if I should not be thought too forward in so good a cause: but
howsoever I, or the Pyramid that has made me thus to speak be liked of, so
that I have preserved my self far from Joue et fulmine, I care the less the
censure of the rude, and unlearned that knows not, but extra crepidam, neither
would I wish the covetousness of the rich, nor the envy of the malecontent,
nor the partiality of the indifferent, neither the favourer of Popery, hinder
so good a work, neither dislike of me the Patronizer thereof: adding only
this short caveat, with your good leave and friendly favor, that if the least
countenance of clemency shall be shown to the Roman conspiratours and
their associates, either now or hereafter: it is to be feared, that your
clemency shall be called cruelty, and your courage cowardnesse, and your
love hatred: And last of all, your Religion and Zeal toward Christ's Church
and your Country, shall be thought Atheism and Popery. Which GOD forbid
should ever come to pass in such a Christian and flourishing Monarchy, where
Christ's word is so universally and religiously preached. And if that you
either save any of the greatest or meanest sort of those coniured Traitors
that be now in hands; but especially the Jesuits and Seminary Priests, the
chief inventours of all those pestilent plots, and ringleaders of the rest to
this damnable Rebellion, either for fear, favor, or for any other worldly
or politic respect: I fear not only all such that fears God truly at home,
but all sincere and faithful Christian neighbors abroad shall suspect you as
betrayers both of Christ's Church, his true religion, your gracious King,
Country, yea your own lives, to your very enemies: and to this end surely
the eyes and ears of all those which be bound by the band of Unity in true
religion in all foreign Kingdoms, are bent to attend and hear of the good
success of so great a work, put in your hand at this time; so persuading
themselves in this mean time, that seeing it had pleased God to have blessed you
by all other Nations and Kingdoms of the earth, with so wise, learned, and
religious a King, so grave, godly, expert, and foreseeing a Parliament,
wherein I wish, Abraham's faith, Salomons wisdom, David's zeal, Jonathans
faithfulness, Iosuahs courage, and Judiths spirit and resolution, may appear in
every one of you at this present, having also so faithful and obeysant
Magistrates and Subjects to execute, whatsoever your sacred King and three
Estates shall decree in this present Parliament, expecting in this mean time at
your hands, such godly, necessary, and strict laws, with their due execution
without delay and acception of persons, as Christ's Church and true religion,
may be without all fear of danger; and on the other part the Papists your
enemies, may be in such sure guard, with a care to disarme them, and enable
them of all such means whatsoever, as in any way hereafter may give but the
least suspicion of any thing, that may endanger his Majesty's person,
succession, and Kingdoms, either by themselves here at home, or otherwise
abroad, by their favorers and associates. And so consider with thy self
(beloved great Britain) the singular goodness of thy God toward thee, and
thine anointed King, in delivering you both (who were appointed as Sheep to
the slaughter) from that most barbarous and savage imminent massacre, and
unnatural conspiracy (no age ever yielding example of like cruelty) and that
thy deliverie and safety came not of thy merit, but of Gods great mercy, not
thy foresight, but his providence, not thy love to God, but his to thine
anointed King and his chosen people. Forget not therefore, to praise, thank,
and glorify the Lord of Hosts continually, for his mervailous and most
merciful work of thy preservation and safety, for his mercy endures for
ever. Which that thou, and thy faithful people, and their seed after them, may
not only the better remember and be taught to do, but learn also to abhor
the odious hainousnes of so foul a fact: Let it be (as it is most worthy to
be) written and engraven in my Pillar of lasting Marble ad perpetuam rei
memoriam. And so praying the most High to bless our good proceedings and well
intended indevours with happy and prosperous success to his glory, the good
of his Church our own comforts, and the conversion (if it may be) or else the
confusion of his and our enemies; I conclude with this my last request, that
such obdurate and stiff-necked Papists, as will not be yoaked or reclaimed
from their gross and abominable idolatries and wicked superstitions, but
still like Swine swill and swell themselves with the filthy dregs, that the
great whore of Romish Babylon gives unto them, refusing to be cured by the
healthie and wholesome potion of Gods most holy truth, may not be suffered to
dwell together with me in this land; for neither is it lawful for such to
live amidst Gods chosen Heritage, to defile the Land with their filthiness, nor
(if they should) can my life be without continual hazard and danger, by their
secret and villainous attempts. Call upon thy King therefore, to execute
justice and judgment in cutting off these workers of iniquity, whose religion
is rebellion, whose faith is faction, whose piety is wicked policy and
practice of murdring both souls and bodies of Kings, and all estates of
people, and to root and rid them clean out of the confines and limits of thy
whole Monarchy, which being clearly purged of them, may ever hereafter grow
up, prosper, and flourish in quiet safety, sound health, and invincible
strength in every member of the whole body of all true and truly devoted
subjects, with their righteous and religious Head and Sovereign.

Deo soli gratia and laus.
