A little treatise of the manner and form of confession / made by the most
excellent and famous clerk, M. Eras. of Roterdame.

Cum priuilegio Regali.

John^ Byddell.



To the reverent father Frau^^^^^ke Moline, the bishop of Condome, newly
elected, Erasmus of Roterdame sends gretynge.
OUR friend Hillary bringing unto me your letters, most honorable prelate /
full of a certain rare and singular favor and benevolence toward me: did
doubtless bring unto me very much hilarite and gladness. For asmoche therefore
as it has pleased you to let me have knowledge and understanding, what thing
you do there in those parties, where you are abydyng: me thought it was my
part again to provide that you should not be ignorant, nor unknowing
wherabout I (...) occupied at yt time, wha^ yo^ lettre was delivered unto m^^
Horace at what time his m^^ was occupied about such thy^^ges as do apperteyne
to living well, and virtuously, writes in this wise: Li. j. epist. j.
Condo et compono que mox depromere possim.

I do (says he) gather and lay up in my mind wholesome precepts / which I
may shortly hereafter utter and express in my conversation and living. But
this said verse may I more ryghtfully and truly use and apply to my self /
which was at yt time occupied about such things as do help unto dyeng
well, and maky^g of a good end. For this is the chief and principal part /
and also the most ernest part of philosophy, and wisdom.

This thing albeit it y^^ it ought to be the principal study and busynes of
a^l men, all the time of their life: yet are we the most perte of us, I wot
not after what facyon, much of the property that the people of Phrigia were
of / and we are not lightly amended nor made better / but by strokes and
punysheme^t. The pain and grefe of the raynes of the back, has in deed very
often at other times payned me: but specially of al other times / it did so vex
and turment me in the month of July last passed / that there was none other
remedy / but ernestely to think of departing out of the world: but the same
disease did so come upon me again at Christenmas / that not only I was in
despair of life / but also I did desire and wyshe to die: The stoone is a
warpe and a churly ^e warner and teacher^ even more cruel also than death it
self: but yet for all that hereof I may thank it / or rathe^ our lord Jesus by
it / that I do now diligently and hertely give head and provide, that death
may not come upon me, and take me unprepared, and unready / although he do come
so suddenly, yt he shall not grant me laysure and space to make confession at
my last end. A little treatise, whereupon I do at this time send unto you as
a^nexed to my letters written unto you: with the which, if you ^hal judge your
epistle to be well recompensed / I shall have cause wherefore greatly to be glad
and rejoice, for your good and favorable mind borne toward me / I know right
well that I shall

(...) deyned of Christ him self / so that it in no wise may be put down,
or taken away by men: or else being brought in of our fore fathers, and elders
/ it has by little and little gathered such strength, that the auctorite of it
is as great / as if it had been instituted of Christ / namely in as much as y^
auctorite of ye bishop of Rome, and the consent also of the christen people
has confirmed the same. Furthermore, if a man does grant that it has been
instituted and ordained first of men / than whether it should be more expedient
and profitable, that it be left and do remayn still / because of innumerable
vtilities and profits / which we do se to come of it: or else it should be
better that it were taken away / for because of innumerable inconuenientes and
harms / which we do find by experience to rise by the occasion of it /
through the defaute of them that do make confession / and of them that here
confession. But thou shalt look for none of these thiges in this book good
reder / either because these things have been long syns diligently handled and
treated of / by most connyng men: or else because I list not now in this
unquiet world, Proverb.
and troublous state of times, to stir such botches or soores: neither is it
my purpose and en^ente now to move and stir such things / Proverb.
as are not to be moved or styrred / but rather according to the counsel of
Plato, to order that well that is present. For with how so ever many and
great arguments the one perte does labor and strive to prove this confession,
not to have been instituted of our lord Jesus him self / and that so great a
burden can not by any person being but a pure man, be laid upon men's
shulders: yet doubtless this thing can not be denied, that he is sure, and safe
from ieopardie, which has made his confession well unto an able and mete
preeste. These men also, which do defend and maintain the opinions of
Luther, do confess and grant that this confession is wholesome and profitable
/ and not to be despised. But I likewise as I can not by strong effectual
testimonies of the scriptures, and invincible arguments / force and constrayne
them yt list to be styffe, and froward / for to grant this confession (this
confession I mean, such as it is, now used) to have been instituted of Christ,
or else of the apostles: even so do I judge it religiously for to be observed
and kept of all good men / as a thing at the least wise brought in of ye
hedd and prelates of the church / not without the inspiration of the holy
ghost / even unto this present condition and state: how well other men do
provide for them selves / which do teach that this confession is not of
necessite, advise them: but I for my part, if any deadely sin do combre and
prick my conscience / durst not be bold neither to go to gods board / neither
to look after and abide my dyenge day / onles I be reconsiled to god by a
priest, accordy^g to ye most common usual custom of the church. Therefore in
asmoche as this is certain and undoubted, How the author ^oth esteem
confession / hereof thou may judge good reder.
that this confession is many ways, and for many causes very profitable and
wholesome / if both parties do their duty: yt is to wit, both he, which by
confession sechethe physic, and the help of his soul / and he also of whom
counsel is asked / as of a ghostly leache or surgean: I have thought it best
somewhat in few word to show and declare, by what means it may be brought to
pass / yt very much fruit may be taken of confession / and very little hurtes
or yuels admitted or received: which yuels or inconuenientes, we do se to
arise not so much of the thing it self, as of the defaute of men: Like wise
as there is nothing welnere in the world so holy / nor so godly / nor (if I
may so say) so heavenly / that the corrupt manners of men do not turn to their
own harm and hurt. And verily those certain persons do greatly myslyke me,
which go about to take away the thing that is good of it self / because of
the defautes of men that mysuse it: where as a medecin and remedy were rather
to be ministered and given to the men so misusing it.

As many as yet hitherto have treated and written of this matter of confession,
I se that their most principal labor, and study has been to show the commen
kinds of sins, both special, and general / and they have only instructed
and taught the person that makes confession / and not also the hearer of
confession: albeit that this thing was most specially and principally to be
done / namely these days / in which we do se, and sorrow religious men, and
priests, for the most part, to be fallen and common to that point / that
both in ignorance and in corrupt manners, they do well nere pass ye common
unlearned lay people: I have therefore in this work studied and endeavored my
self to admonyshe both parties / to the end, that whiles he that hereth / and
he that makes confession do both of them their part and duty. There may of
this thing, being of it self very good / greatte and plentuous vtilite come
unto them both. Now moreover, because there are some men / which do believe,
Diverse op^nions concerning confession.
that this confession was instituted and ordained of Christ? and some again
there be / which do doubt thereof: and some also there be / which although it
were instituted of men / yet do observe it no less religiously and devoutly /
than if Christ had instituted it with his own mouth: and some other again
there be / which do suppose it to be in deed a thing arbitrable (that is to
say, not of necessite / but standing in man's will and pleasure to do it, or
leave it undone) but yet they counsel (as I said) that it is not to be
despised / for asmoche as it is wholesome and profitable. To all these persons
have I ordained this book. From those men, which do say, and teach that it is
arbitrable / I do plainly and utterly disagree. And as for those, which do
affirm, that it was instituted of mere and pure men / in this book, I do
neither consent and agree unto them / neither I do repugne and strive against
them: how be it yet I am more enclinynge and leanyng toward that part /
which believes it to have been instituted of Christ: and this sentence and
opinion I shall also gladly maynteyne and defend / when I shall be ons
instructed and appointed therefore with sufficient and due armor of scriptures
and arguments / lest I might else chance to make the cause the worse, and
hinder the matter / if it should fortune me not to have good speed / nor the
thing to come well to pass with me / whiles I went about to prove it. For it
is no great busynes or maystrye for a man to say or affirm a thing: but it is
a point apperteynyng to a catholic doctor, to prove ye thing which he
says / and to confute his adversaries, by evident and open testimonies of ye
scriptures. I remember and follow this saying of Horace: he sat still and
would not meddle / which feared lest the busynes should not frame well with him
/ and that he should labor in vain. For it is better to leave the matter hole
and untouched, to other men: than by yuell handelynge of it, to bring it in to
more ieopardie. we therefore leauyng that thing to other men / which requires
an excellent warrior: have taken unto our self the perte of a rascal
soldier, purposynge to show certain things / by which it shall be
brought to pass / that more fruit and profit may come of confession. And to
the end that this thing may be ye more manifest and clear / we shall first
show in few words, The division of this work.
how great commodities and perfites are in this confession. Seco^daryly, how
great a pestilence or destruction of very virtue and godlynes does arise hereof,
by occasion among men. Thyrdly, by what means and ways we may attain the
commodities / and by what means the disco^modities and harms may be avoided
and eschewed. Fourthly, we shall pursue and speak of other things / which do
apperteyne to the office of him that hears confession / and of him that
makes confession. which labor of mine, for asmoche as it does help no less
to the profit of the hearers of confession, than of them yt do make
confession: As I suppose, it is mete and accordy^g that both perties do take it
in good worth / although the nature of the argument or matter shall cause
certain things to be brought in / little liking or pleasant to man's
judgment. For it belongs to phisicions, not so much to speak pleasant and
delectable things, as it does to speak wholesome and profitable things.

The first vtilite coming of confession.
THe first than and the chief vtilite yt comes of shryft and confession of
sins (as I suppose) is this / that by none other means the pride of man's
mind is either better or more effectually and strongely abated and pulled down
/ and stubburnnesse or sturdynes against god / (which, onles it be with great
study and diligence depressed and thruste down / it does in conclusion auaunce
and raise up it self against all thing that is worshypped or called god. 2.
Thessa. 2.
For this has been and is the founteyne of all impiete and wyckednes / that we
do think our self to be some what / when in very deed we are nothing. This
pride and presumption did cast down Lucifer with his unhappy company, Esai. 14.
for yt he ascribed unto him self, that thing / which he had freely received
of gods goodness: and being lift up in mind against the majesty of his
creator and maker / he was cast down heedlonge in to the lowest place /
whiles he goth about to win unto him self the highest: and he began to be
most abiecte and vile of all creatures / after yt he ons had to much lyky^g
in him self, and stood over much in his own co^ceipte. And by his
instigation and also ensample / the first authors and pare^tes of mankind /
whiles by tastynge the fruit of the forboden tree, Genesis.3.
they did covet to be made equal with god / were driven out of Paradise. Lucifer
was a certain mind / noble / immortal / bodyles / endued with gifts /
scantely able to be esteemed of us: but yet for all this, because he did not
submyt and humble him self unto him / of whom he had received what soever
felicite he had / and in comparyson unto whom, he was nothing: he fell, never
after to be repaired or restored. How much less than is it convenient or
accordy^g, that man, being so far in condition and estate lower than angels
/ should be proud / presumptuous / and stubburne against god / of whom he was
created and made / and without whom, naught he has / nor naught he may do?
And yet this not wtsta^dynge, this myscheuous vice is rooted in the minds of
men / and that wyly serpent does not cease, by this pestilent sin to draw
men unto that place / whereunto he him self is fallen down. Like wise as unto
wyckednes the first degree, and the first step was an high proud mind /
and trustyng much on it own self: even so the first degree or step unto
godlynes, shall be a mind utterly myslykynge it self / and submyttynge it
self unto god. Now can there not be any more submission, or humblyng and
mekenynge of a man / than yt one man wyllyngly do cast down him self at the
feet of another man / and do show and diclose unto him not only his own
deeds / but also ye preuie and secret thoughts of his mind / namely seeing
that certain of them are such manner ones / that they may not be told and
rehearsed without great shamefastnes / and certain also of that kind / that they
are not without very great danger and ieopardie of a man's life, discovered and
uttered unto him / which either through folyshenes / or dronkennes / or malice
/ or syckenes / may at any time disclose that / which he has herd. Besides
this, co^sydre this thing also / of how arrogant and proud minds, certain
persons be even by nature. Again, how greatte pride of mind welthe and
prosperity, does cause and enge^dre in some other men / as for example / in
rich men / in beautiful and fair persons / in princes, or governors / in
learned men / in hypocrytes / or those, which other wise are excellent in
dignity among men. These persons no doubt of it must needs do great
violence to their own mind / when for the fear of god / and for the love of
their own souls health / they do lay away all pride and high stomach / and do
fall down lowly and mekely at ye feet of a priest / being often times but a
vile and an abiecte person / and of no reputation in the sight and judgment
of the world / and unto him as unto a divine and godly physician, do uncover
and disclose all the corruption of their minds / and all the boyles and soores
of their conscience. But whiles a man does in such wise humble and meken him
self before man ^. Petri. 5^
God does resist and withstand proud persons / but he never despised a
contrite and a meke humble heart. Psalm. 50.
That heart that is contrite, A contrite heart.
and broken with sorrow / is not lyfted up / it does not swel with pride. But if
thou do mengle with it the moystnes and liquore of tears / it will like moist
claye / or soft paast / that follows the hand of the workman / in to what
soever facyon or shape he list. And if thou shalt have humbled and mekened
thy heart to god / it shall be no pain or grefe to the, for to submit and
humble thy self to a preeste. In the co^myttyng and doing of sin / thou wast
proud, and disobedient against god / and submittedest thy self to the yoocke
of the devil: and does it now grieve the to submyt and humble thy self to
the minister and vicar of god^ when thou, being allured and begyled with the
bayte of vices / dydest hold forth thy neck unto the halters and snares of
the devil / than it was convenient and semely for yt to have remembered pride
and high stomach: and not here / where thou doste for a season humble and cast
down thy self / that thou may from hell be exalted and lyfted up in to
heaven. If any part of thy body have a boil, or a botche / thou submittest thy
self unto the surgean, being a man / thou vncouerest and make bare unto him
even the most secret and privy parts of thy body: And when thy mind is
wounded with so many and sundry wou^des / does it grieve the for so little a
while to submit thy self unto the phisician of ye soul? Similitudes
For likewise as he yt does minister unto a poor man / does not think in
this wise: how vile and low a person is this, to whom I do service: but he
does rather think thus with him self / how high and honorable is he, for
whose sake I do this service and benefit: even so, he that gothe unto the
preeste / let him not consydre the condition and state of him / as touching ye
world / but let him consydre how great and excellent he is / whose stead the
priest bears / and how great auctorite and power is given to him / far higher
than either the auctorite of king or emperor.

If any beggar can ease the of the fever / would thou not, be thou never so
rich, and honorable / gladly kneel on thy knees unto him / to have him
restore the unto health? If thou were taken prisoner of rouers on the Sea: who
is there of so low degree and estate / to whom thou would not gladly fall
down on thy knees / if thou kneweste that it lay in his power to deliver the /
and to restore the home again to thine own.

If the emperor, being grievously offended and displeased with the / had assigned
or appointed any one of his cooks, either to punyshe the / or else to restore
the in to the princes favor again: woldeste thou not gladdely fall down at
the cooks knees / and do what soever thing even those that are most humble
suppliauntes are wont to do / not so much reputing, and consyde^yng what
manner person he is / but how much he may do for the: and would you not in
that person of low estate, honor and worship the majesty of the emperor?
Thou would fall wyllyngly, and gladly submytte thy self unto the rod or
wande of the officer / which might turn or change thine estate / and make
the of a man's bond servant / a man's free servant: And doste thou here refuse
and flee from the priests hand / which may make the of the deuyls bond
servant / the son of god? To loose and destroy thy soul, it did not grieve
the / to give thy self to be trode^ under the foot of Satan: and to receive
health again / disdaynest thou to commit and betake thy self unto a preeste?
what a folyshe manner of pride is this, contrary to all reason and right order?
and what a perverse and leude kind of hu^blenes or mekenes is this? whiles thou
do auaunce and lift up thy self / thou art overthrown and cast down. If
thou will be exalted and enhaunsed / there is no remedy, but thou must needs
cast down thy self, and bring thy self low. There is nothing more high
than is god / but yet thou go away from him, Psalm. 137.
when thou lyftest up thy self / and art high by pride: and tha^ thou
drawest nere to him / when with ye lowly publicane thou do wtdrawe and cast
down thy self by mekenes. Luc. 18.
Upon the hills and mountains that be higher than the clouds / god throws
lyghtni^ge. Upon the low dales, he sends forth the showers, and ryuers /
that they may be fresh and grene with much grass / and may be ple^tuous with
much fruit. For this doubtless is it / wherefore ye scripture says, 1. Petri. 5.
to the humble and lowly persons he gives grace. Iacobi. 4.
There are the cursed mountains of Gelboe / upon which, neither dew nor
rain does light. There are also mountains / wherewith the lord is delyted.
Gene. 22.
There was the mount / upon which Abraham made ready and went about to offer
up his only son in sacrifice. Exodi.19. et. 20.
In a mount also was the law given. The mou^te Syon is famous and greatly
commended / which trusts and puts confidence in the lord. Psalm. 124.
And there are mountains also / unto which the godly men do lift up their
iyes / and fromwhens they do look and wait after help. Psalm. 120.
In the mountains also our lord did often times make his prayers. Math. 17.
On a mou^teyn also he was tra^sfigured. Actuum. x.
On the mou^te he went or styed up to heaven. Therefore that you may be made a
mount^ or hylle pleasant unto the lord / cast down the heyghte or top of
thy heart / and be thou made a low valley or dale, that you may receive yt
benediction and blessyng of ye lord: Hebre. 9.
and that all thystels and thorns / which the cursed ground brings forth,
being cleansed and ryd out / thou may plentuously bring forth much fruit of
virtues. Believe me, whose soever mind does vehemently and greatly refuse and
grudge to submit and meken him self to a preeste / he has not yet
sufficiently humbled and cast down his heart before god / nor he does not yet
hertely repent. Considre who he is, that thou have offended. Consydre also,
how soore and grievous punyshement thou have deserved. Consydre again, to what
unworthiness and shame thou haste cast down thy self / through co^mittyng of
sin / and how vnhonorable and foul thou have made thy self in the syghte
of god / of all saints and angels / whiles thou, thy garmente and ring cast
away from the, Luc. 15.
being shaken out from the felyship and company of the children and sons of
god / art made the servant of the devil / the heir of hell fire / and
do think and reken that you ought to be ashamed of any thing / what
soever it be / that may from so great unworthiness and vileness, restore the
again in to so great felicite. Art thou ashamed to seem a sinner? why art
thou not than by that reason as well ashamed to seem a man? And if thou have
respect and regard unto shamefastnes, or honesty: it is more shame and
dishonestie, not to be wyllyng to change ye bondage, than it was to have
fallen in to it. Finally, let one shamefastenes drive out another / likewise as
one nail is driven out with another. A ^rouerbe.
Considre and bethynke the, whether of ye two is more tolerable / I mean ons
to be ashamed here before one man: orels afterward to be ashamed in ye sight of
god / and his aungelles / and of all the holy saints / which have been from
the begynny^g of ye world / and which shall be until ye worlds end.
Consydre and think with thy self, what a theater and multitude of lokers
shall be there / with what face dare thou there behold thy maker / thy redemer
/ and deliverer: whom thou haste despised / notwithstanding that he ^yd provoke
the with so many benefits / did make the so great and royal promyses / and
also did tolerate and suffer ye with so great patience and gentilnes? how
shalt thou lift up ^hyn ^yes, to look upon that most blessed felyshyp and
company of the heavenly citezins: from which thou have wy^lyngly of thine own
my^de, withdrawn thy self / and cast thy self in to a miserable and
wretched company? If you do think well upon this dishonor / this rebuke /
this ignominy / and this shame: thou would sone despise and make light of
this temporal and transitory shame / which puts away euerlasty^g rebuke
and shame. Blessed are they, whose sins ar covered or hyd, Psalm. 31.
for confession covers and hydeth sins: so yt now, neither god does
remember him, neither the devil does know him. And for asmoche as the hole
man in serving sin / has lyfted up him self by proud disobedience against
god: it is convenient and mete that he do humble and meken him self euin in
body also. And likewise as ye body often times does give the occasion of doing
sin: even so often times either it does engendre and cause / or else does
help and further the virtue of the mind. For this cause the governors and
rulers of holy church in old time / not only in the administration of the
sacraments, and in the divine service: but also in ye castyng forth of them
that were relapsed in to any heinous and odious crime / and in the receyuynge
in again of them / which were purged and cleansed by penance / did use
certain visible rites and ceremonies, to thentent that both the people should
be feared away from doing sin / and also that they / which yet were not
soorye for their sins / should be provoked unto repentance and amendeme^t /
and that they, whose repentance was weyke, should be the more provoked to
horror and hatred of sins. For ye imbecilite and weykenes of man's mind,
needs many styrrynges and prouocations to this, that it do conceive and gather
in it self ye fire of divine charity / and that it do keep it / and that
being possessed of it, waxyng strong / it be transfigured and tra^sformed of
ye same. In the old time, they were repreued and rebuked of the bishop / The
sharp penance enjoined to sinners in old time.
they were separated and departed from the company and felyshyp of the christen
flock / and bare heeded and clothed in course sackeclothe / and besprincled with
ashes / they stood before y^ church porche / humbly besechyng and desiryng of
them that passed by / and that came in to ye church, the suffrages and help
of their prayers / there was enjoined unto them fastings / often drinking of
water / slepyng on ye bare ground / and other things mo, very hard and
paynfull in deed to the affections of man / but wholesome and profitable both to
them, which had regard and mind to the saving of innocence / and also to
them, which did suffer such things / to the purging and washing away of
their sins. And of this said custom, there remains still even yet at this
day certain tokens / namely in ye church of Rome. The manner at Rome.
For certain men's shoulders are made bare, and naked, and without the
church they are beaten with a rod, other whiles even until the blood do
follow / and that a very great nombre and multitute of people lokyng on: but
yet only the penitentiarie does know, what offense, or crime ye penitent
has committed / saving only, that all men do judge and deem some heinous
offense to have been committed. But what time the charity waxed cold, and
wyckednes came in a floote: the heedes and prelates of the church, having
respect unto man's imbecilite and weykenes, did release the greattest perte of
the shame, and of the pain: lest they might alienate and turn many men away
from the faith of ye church, if they did use their auctorite toward all men.
But it is our part to recompense and make up that, which is abated and taken
away of bodily ceremonies, with humblenes and lowlynes of mind, and with
co^trition and sorrow of the heart. The more remysse and slack that ye
correction and chastisement of the church, that was in old time, is made
toward us: so much the less we ought to be favorable toward our own
selves. It is granted unto us, that we may (only a certain few kinds
excepted) be purged and cleansed by secret confession, without any loss or
empayri^g of our honesty and good fame, from all manner offenses and crimes, be
they never so heinous and grievous. But we must take heed and beware, that this
myldenes and gentilnes of the church, do not teach us to hate our sins but
sclenderly and smally / for those sins may not seem small or sleyghte to
every one / of which is due the eternal pain of the fire of hell. Therefore
this unprofitable, yea pernicious shame fastnes, is to be cast away / and this
folyshe and wicked pride, is to be shaken of. For what manner a thing is it to
dread the conscience or knowledge of one man / and not to dread and fear ye
iyes of god / which sees and beholds all things? it is doubtless a peuyshe
and a mad pride.

The second vtilite coming of confession.
THe second vtilite or profit yt comes of confession, is that there are very
many men / which either by reason of age / or else for lack of knowledge, do
not perceive the qua^tite of their offenses: but through error and mystakyng,
do judge that thing to be none offense at all, which is a deadely sin / and
contrary wise again, do suppose and wene that to be a grievous sin, which is
not so. Or if they do perceive ye qua^tite of their offense: yet are they so
combred and entangled / that they wot not how to rydde out them selves /
which thing happens and chau^seth in many cases of matrimony / of vows /
of restitution / and such other like / in which cases some time even well
learned divines, and lawyers also are in perplexite and doubt. Here in this
point there is not only need of absolution / but also ye matter requires a man
that is virtuous and well conscienced / and besides y^, well instructed and
skylled in ye knowledge of holy scriptures / and also in ye knowledge of both
laws. Furthermore, like wise as in ye bodies of men there are certain fevers,
yt are not perceived / but by so much they are the more perilous: even so are
there often times in ye minds of men also certain secret vices, either not
espied and perceived / or else deceyuyng men with the visour and face of
godlynes. Here in this thing the priest does help / as it were a co^nyng
physician: and by tokens and conjectures, gatheryng the unknown disease and
syckenes of the mind, does revoke the pertie from error. Again, he
conforteth and encourages him, that is afraid in vain, where there was no
ieoperdie. Moreover, those that are wrapped and entangled in perplexe and
doubtful euyls, he does with wise learned and faithful counsels unwrap them,
and set their conscience at rest: shewi^g unto them ye way, by which they may
shake of the vice, which either cle^eth toughly, and is loathe to go away / by
the reason of natural inclinaon: or else often times among has recourse, by
the reason of long custom and familiarite. For in no manner diseases are ye
phisicions put to more busynes, and labors, for to find ye remedy by their
co^ning: than in those, which thrughe long process and continuance of time,
are beco^men familier: in so much yt they are utterly in despair / and do
rather promise mitigation and aswagement of the disease than ye heling of it:
as for example in the falling syckenes, being ons rooted and of long
continuance, in the gowte / or in the stoone, if it be in aged men. But in the
diseases and syckenesses of the mind / that is to wete, in vices / no man
ought at any time to despair of health, An spiritual diseases, let no man
despair to be healed, be they never so great
saying that Christ did cleanse and make hole both the lepers / Luc. 17.
and the woman that had so many years ben combred and diseased with flux and
issue of blood / and also did set upright upon his feet, Luc. 8.
the man being diseased with the palsay / which had lain bedreden so many
years. Marc. 2.
Finally, did call again and restore to life lazare / which had lain deed four
days in his grave. John^. 11.
Furthermore, this thing also does a conning and a trusty physician cause,
that he may by certain tokens and signs, perceive and know before the
sickness and disease of the body, that is toward him / and with no great
busynes avoid and keep it of in the coming / where as if it had ons entered in
him and had gotten ye victory, he should scacely be able to drive it away with
exceeding great labor. Even the same does a wise and a trusty physician and
leche of the soul / when he perceyueth evident ieopardie of any vice and
spiritual disease coming toward: he gives monition and warnyng thereof / and
shows by what means it may be avoided and eschewed. And this thing is never
done in better or more convenient season, than in sacramental confession.

THis vtilite, The third vtilite^
which I will now speak of / it shall be at every man's free choice / whether he
will make it ye third vtilite / or else join it to the next order / and it
is this / that ye priest in confession does remedy and cure two of the most
greattest vices that can be / of which, the one is pestilent securite or
rechelesnes / or else (which is yet more pestilente than this) reioysynge and
bostynge of sins: the other is much more perilous than they both / despair
of the mercy of god / whereof the first author and begynner was Cain / and ye
counterfeter was Judas, Genesis. 2.

Math. 27.


yt betrayed our lord. There are certain sins / which have a secret pride
and reioysyng in them: as for example, the defylyng of fair and beautiful
damsels / or the over coming of noble and rich wives / or the lesynge of a
great sum of money at ye diese / or ye shrewde and evil handlyng of a man's
enemy and foo / or the outrageous expense done in maky^g of a feast or banquet.
These things certain men do so confess, and in such wi^e shryue them selves
of them, that not only they are not ashamed of ye offenses that they have
done: but also do rather booste them, as noble and glorious acts. The preeste,
when he shall perceive this in his ghostly child / shall labor and go about
by all manner means, to cast out this folyshe pride, and reioysynge from the
mind of him, that makes his confession / and by showing unto him the
shamefulnes and foulenes of the sin / instead of that pestilent pride and
reioysyng / to bring in to his mind wholesome shame and sorrow. Contrary wise
again there are certain sins of that kind and sort / that the very
judgment of nature does abhor them / and that he which has committed
them, does condemn and hate his own self: as for example / killing of
father or mother / babeslaughter / wondrous and abhomynable kinds of lechery
/ such as are not to be named / common theftes and robberies / which are done
without any manner sleyght or craft / poysonynge / collusion with wicked
spirits / blasphemy against god / and such other like to these.

The grievous enormitie of these said offenses and crimes, does otherwhyles
bring a man in to desperation / which is the most grievous and sorest offense
yt may be, of all other. Desperatio^ is the most grievous offense of all other.
For that man seems less to offend god / which is made negligent and
careless, through ouermoche boldness and trust upon his goodness: than he, which
despayrynge of forgyuenes of his sins, does deny god to be good and
merciful / when he is even very mercy it self / and does deny him also to
be true of his promise / when he has promised without any exception, to
forgive the sinner, that is penitent and sorry / which promise doubtless he will
ful^yl and perform, if he be true, And finally denies him to be omnipotent
and almighty / as though there were some offense or sin of man / which he
were not able to remedy and heal. Here therefore in this case, the preeste
shall leave nothing unspoken, whereby he may conforte and reyre up the person
being thus out of conforte, and despayrynge of him self, unto hope of
forgyuenes / and also whereby he may, after that he has brought him to yt point
/ so confirm and establyshe him / that he do not fall down again in to the
same.

The fourth v^ilite.
ANd there are some persons also, whose minds ar so weyke, and feeble / that
they dare not hope, nor, promise unto them selves forgyuenes / no, not even of
small and light offenses / nor can have their conscience at quiet and rest:
except by the priest such solemn and common accustomed ceremonies be
enjoined them / to the which absolucion is given. Now do I suppose and wene
it to be a point of christen humanite, to bear, and apply our selves unto ye
infirmite and weykenes even of such manner persons, until they grow up unto
the firmite of more strong mind: whereunto it shall be mete and convenient
often times among to stir and exhort them.

I have known certain persons / which could not persuade unto them selves,
that they were assoyled from their sins, except the preeste did witness and
record the same by his own hand writing. Besides this, very many men do
scrupulously and carefully confess them selves even of those things, which
among venial sins are of least weyghte / yea and sometime even of those
things, which are very tryfles: as of pollutions in the night time, which
chance to come through no vicious occasion / but only of natural disposition
of the body / neither has any consent followed or delectation in the same. Of
which thing John^ Gerson has written so diligently, yea and so specially, that
he has caused many men's consciences, by reason thereof, to be very scrupulous.

Scrupulosite in saying of service, and prayers.
In likewise there are some men, which in saying of their orisons and prayers /
do never satisfy their own minds / and they are greatly troubled euin with
very small tryfles. And often times it happens / that to this weykenes is
joined also peruersite, and a froward will and mind. They are only careful,
and do take thought, whether they do plainly and distinctly pronounce and
sound out the letters and syllables: but whether they do understand what they
read / or whether they do worship, and be styrred with the words of god,
which they do sound with their mouth, they are excedyngly careless / and hereof
do take no keep at all.

Semblablye, they do so shryue them selves of sodeyn and fleing thoughts /
which do but as it were only touch lightly, and skym over the ouermost or
vttermoste part and skyn of the mind, and not synke or tarry in it. I say they
do so confess these thoughts, as if they had certeynly or steadfastly ben
determined and purposed upon that thing, which came in to their mind, or had
also fulfilled it in very deed: wha^ other whiles such thoughts are of
things even abominable to be spoken of / as when there happens to come in
to a man's mind a certain doubtfulnes of the verite and truth of the
scriptures, of the articles of the faith / or else a thought of incest / or of
monstrous forms or facyo^s of fulfyllynge of fleshely lust or pleasure. To
confess these things rehearsed, scrupulously and perticularly, it does both
charge and ouerlade the hearer with things superfluous and nothing ne^efull:
and also does trouble the mind of him, that is confessed with fear and dread
unprofitably. They say it is a sign and token of a good mind, there to fear
sin, where no sin is. Admit that it be a sign of a good my^de: yet
certeynely it is no token of a a perfect mind. And albeit such a thing in
young boys, or wenches, do betoke^ a nature or disposition mete to the lerning
of virtue and good life: yet the same thing in men is unmeet and unprofitable,
yea pernicious also and hurtful / for that y^ supersticious and superfluous
fleinge and eschewynge of one vice^ does bring a man in to another more
grievous and more weyghtie / which thing we do se brought to pass in many men
/ by the subtilte and craft of the devil. This peruersite and learned mind is
to be rebuked: and simple and unlearned in^irmite is to be instructed and
taught. It is a point of christian virtue and godlynes, to be sorry for such
manner infirmities and fraylte of man's nature: and to withsta^de them asmoche
as a man may / and to labor toward more perfect things. A man that is
verily virtuous and godly / wyssheth and desires the perfect integrite and
cle^nes of his body / which he hops to have in the general resurrection /
and therefore he is sorry, that his vessel is polluted and de^iled with unclean
dreams: but it follows not, Not every thing y^ greueth a good and virtuous
man is syn.
because it greueth him, and he is sorry for it / that it is therefore
strayghtways sin. For so a good virtuous man is grieved also, and sorry, that
with hu^gre / with thurst / with slepinges / with faintnes or werynes of the body
/ he is feign to break up the continual fervor of prayer / he is sorry for the
rebellious motions of the members agay^st ye mind / he soroweth, that the
flesh does lust against ye spirit. But these things are so farof from being
sins / yt they be rather matter and occasion of virtue / if a man do strive
against them to the utter most of his power. which self same thing, I do
judge for to be done to wards them / which of like infirmite do often times
repete and rehearse again the confession of one, and the same offenses / both
putting their own selves to pains, and disease / and also spending in wast
the preeftes time. In deed a man other whiles to follow the minds of such
persons, it is a point of christen charity / but yet so, and in such wise,
that by admonicion and counsel they be promoted and brought forward unto
more perfect things / and do learn to love, and to fear less.

THe fyfthe vtilite is, The fyfthe vtilite.
that for asmoche as there is no remission or forgyuenes of sins / except
there be a due and mete detestation and hatered, of the offenses committed /
procedyng of the love of god, and also an earnest, sure, and steadfast purpose
to forbear and refrain in time after to come, from all things, where with god
is offended and displeased: to the attaynynge of these things, the meditation
and recordyng of confession to be made unto man, helps not a little. For
likewise as he, which shall speak of any matter, and tell his tale before a
judge, does more diligently bethynke him self / and more attentively considre
and wey all the circumstances of the matter, than if he did consydre it without
any such care of speaking it before any man: even so he that studieth and
bethynketh him self, what he shall say unto the priest / does more depely
considre ye grauite and foulnes of his sins / calling to remembrance how
often he has fallen again in them / and how long season he has continued in
his darkness and fylthynes of sin / and of how great co^modites and welthe
he has in ye mean while deprived and berefte his own self, being out of the
favor of god / and departed and severed from the communion and felyshyp of the
hole mystical body of Christ / and bond unto the eternal punyshement of
hell fire. Of the attente and diligente consideration of these things,
spring or rise horror and hatered of sins, which sometime is engendered, and
takes his original beginning of the fear and dread of punyshement, and
causes desperation, onles it do go forwards unto hope of forgyuenes / through
the consideration of the mercy of god / and thrughe confidence and trust in
our lord Jesus Christ / which has ons suffered and made satisfaction for the
sins of al men: until that after servile fear and dread do succeed and
follow love semely for a son / which is displeased and disco^tented with his
sins, not for that y^ they now do bring a man to the fire of hell: but for
that that they do offend and myslyke the most good father, which has done so
much for us. For if the son, which unfeignedly, and from the heart does love
his father and mother / would not, although there were no fear of punyshement
at all / wittingly do that thing, which might displease their minds: how
much more does he that loves god, which is to be loved above all things /
both hate his sins committed in times passed / by which he has displesed
god / and also take heed and beware, that he do not commit any such like
offense in time hereafter to come? This co^modite and profit therefore should
move and stir a man to be shryuen unto a priest, although confession were not
necessary: how much more than is it to be embrased, if necessite do draw us
unto this vtilite?

THe sixte vtilite is, The syxte vtilite.
yt like wise as the greatness of sorrow engendered and conceived of the
consideration and ponderyng of a man's offenses and sins / does purchase and
obtain the mercy of god, to the releasyng of the crimes and offenses / and
does make the purpose of absteynyng from sins, in time coming, the more
firm and stable: even so does shamefastnes to uncover and disclose that is in
his breeste unto a man, take away a great part of the pain / and holds a
man back, yt he shall not lightly fall again in to ye same offenses. Like
wise as children with beatynge, and shame, are taught to beware, that they do
not fall twyes in to one defalte. Now the most part of men are weyke and
feeble / and prone and ready to commit sin. And this shamefastnes is so
grievous and paynfull unto men of gentle and high stomach / yt there are many
men, which had rather dye, than ons to be shamed / were it not so, that either
they did love god / or else did fear the fire of hell.

The seventh vtilite.
THe seventh vtilite is, that for because (according to the old proverb) the
principal part, and the chefeste point of wisdom is, yt a man do know him
self: there is nothing that does more cause this thing / than does
confession / which sets the whole man often times forth before his own
iyes / leaving none of all the secret corners of his mind unshaken and
unsearched, whiles he does inwardly consider to what things the
commandments of god do call him / and to what things he him self is
inclined / and by what occasions he does fall in to sin. Psalm. 1. what ye
very meditation in the law of the lord is.
For this is the very meditation and study in the law of the lord, that a
man do order and dispose him self unto that estate of life / in which he would
desire to be, if the last day of his life were nere at hand.

THe eyghte vtilite, The eight vtilite.
is that he, which makes his confession to a preeste / not only is helped by
his counsel, confort, and exhortation: but also by his prayer. For he prays
and wyssheth to him that is confessed, the grace of the holy ghost / and
ghostly strength to resist and withsta^de the devil. And if it be so, that
the prayer of each good man, who soever he be, is auaylable to the obteynyng of
the grace and favor of almighty god: how much more than is the prayer of the
preeste profitable and helpefull to the same? For doubtless this is it /
which s. Iamis teaches / that even in this thing also, the fervent prayer of
a just person is very much worth, Iacobi.^.
and of great strength. Here I entende not in the mean season to speak any
thing of the power and auctorite of the keys, whereof divines have so
copiously and largely written and taught / that it needs not me to rehearse it
again. For as for what thing attrition is, Attrition.
and whether thereof by the means of confession may be made co^trition / and
whether confession does cause and bring to pass, yt the sin is forthewith
forgyuen in the first instau^te: I do leave all this gear to be disputed and
reasoned of the subtle scotistes.

THe nynthe vtilite is, The nynth vtilite.
that likewise as by baptism we are delivered from the tyranny of Satan, and
being made the sons of god, are graffed in to the body of Christ, which is
the church / and are chosen in to so blessed a company or felyshyp of angels
/ and of all those that are predestinate unto the heavenly inheritance, in what
soever part of the world they do life / have lived / or shall live: even so by
penance are we duly restored again in to the same societe and felyshyp. And
albeit yt he, which has of god received hatered of his sins / is delivered
from his gylte and offense: and though we do grant, yt the confession, which
is made unto a man / is not utterly necessary (which thing certain men both in
old time did teache, and also some men now a days do teache, from whom yet I do
gladly and wyllyngly dissent and disagre) yet yt notwithstanding, Despisynge of
the usual custom and tradition of the church: both displeseth god / and also
causes bretche of charity, and concord.
the despisynge of the publyke custom / which has so many years continually
ben used / and the co^tuma^y and disobedience against the tradition of ye
church / does both offend and displease god / and also does hurt the
tranquilite and quietness of the christen common weal. This offense at the
least wise does he avoid and eschew / which does confess him self unto a
preeste. Besides this, although he were before free from his sins: yet
nevertheless by confession in due form made unto a pressed, is increased much
light / and much grace. which lucre and wynni^g, no man yt is in very deed
virtuous and godly, will despise, and make light of. Moreover, there be some
men, which in the time of their health, have, or rather in their own
judgment do seem to have, a careless and a quiet conscience: but when they are
in extremes and lykely to die, they are otherwise minded / either because tha^
ye ieoperdy draws more nere, either else because ye crafty te^pter the devil
does tha^ use all his crafts, and subtylties against them. Against this
trouble and unquietness of c^ience / the most sure undoubted remedy, is in
convenient and due time faithfully and truly to be confessed unto a preeste.
Last of all, the church will more gladly knowledge for her child, him that
does make confession to a preeste, than him that does not: Like wise as ye
jews did more gladly knowledge for one of them, him which was circuncised,
than him that was uncircumcised. Math. 3.

Roma. 14.


And this also is a part of godlynes, a man to fulfylle all ryghtewysenes, and
to eschew offendynge of his brother / and (according to s. Paul's saying) to
please all men in all points. ^. Cor. 10.
I would not speak these things for mine own cause, but for cause of them,
which have not yet surely, and undoubtedly persuaded unto them selves, that
this confession, as being instituted by men / is utterly necessary unto soul
health. 1. Cor. 2.
A spiritual man does discern and judge all things / and him self is judged
of no man / but (as ye common sort of men is, prone and enclyny^g to shake of
their necks, the yocke of the lord) I se and perceive, that the contempt and
setting at naught of confession, is a special and a principal step or
stayre unto paynymry and hethen manner of living / whereunto we do se many men
now a days to fall again / under the false title and name of euangelical
liberty. Hitherto I have rehearsed and showed the chief and principal
vtilities and profits that do come of confession: which else I do know to be
innumerable. Now ye very place does monyshe and put me in remembrance to say
somewhat in few words, of the yuels or harms, which ar seen to chance, by
the occasion of confession / but through the defaulte fault of the men, rather
than of the thing self.

The first ^isco^modite or harm
ANd first to begin with all, this communication and showing of sins among
men, one of them to another / does seem somewhat to corrupt and infecte that
natural simplicite and innocency, such as we do se to be in young boys, and
young wenches, that are not yet infected with ye corruptions and fylthes of
this life, a great part of this innocency is not to know sin at all, and
not so much as ons to suspecte, or deem yt there be any men, which do
committee such or such offenses and sins / which thy^g even those priests
are wont to knowledge and grant, which are well learned / and which by redynge
of books, might know very many things: saying, that they would never have
suspected or demed such abominable sins to be committed among men / as
they do here told to them other whiles in confession. But those sins of al
other are most contagious, and do most infecte, which do apperteyne unto
lechery, or to curious arts. For there are certain kinds of lecherye /
which no wise man would to be rehearsed or told before his sons, or his
daughters / because that nature, ever when occasion is given / is redye and
inclined to the experience and proof of yuell and ungracious things. wherefore
the surer way is, to be ignorant of such things, as nyghe as a man can.
There are again unlawful crafts and sciences / as witchcrafte / neogramantie
/ and such other / which do entyse and provoke those persons that be
curious, and ouermoche desirous of knowledge, unto thexperience and proving of
them. And there is given commonly by nature to the most part of men, a vicious
and lewd curiosite / tyclynge the mind with lust and desire of knowledge. And
priests are men often times young / and some times also leude and noughtie: or
at ye least wise weyke and frail. The mind of such men is corrupted by
hearing ye wonderful offenses of other men: and are often times moved and
styrred to do the same things / which they have learned to have been committed
and done of other men. And this canker or pestilence spredeth it self yet more
abroad: as often times as ye priests (which thing happens among) do rehearse
and report before other men that thing, which they have herd in confession /
in deed not namynge the persons / yea, and other whiles, not ons sparynge to
tell even ye names of them also. But though they do never so much forbear to
name the person: yet ye thing it self that is told / often times does
infecte and poison the hearer. How be it yet, those men do more grievous
offense, which do report things, such as ar at no time to be spoken, in
open sermones or preachynges. Therefore the temporal officers and rulers /
such as are wise / and do covet yt the city be uncorrupted / when they do
execution of death upon a malefactor / they do always pronounce and declare
all the offenses and crimes committed by ye said malefactors / because it is
not expedient for every manner man to know, yt there are some men, which do
commit such offenses or crimes.

Many years ago, wha^ I being than a very young boy, was abiding in
Dauentrie / I herd certain harlots / whereof great plenty was there at that
time / reioysynge and showing them selves glad each to other, yt they gave
their my^des to their own lovers: because the curate had said in his sermon
/ that certain pastors had confessed them selves, that they had used them
selves not very chastely toward their flock / of which they had cure and
charge. And it was than Iubilee. what more folyshe curate could there be than
this / which neither constrained by any necessite / no nor yet provoked
thereunto by any vtilite / did babble forth this thing among the people / by
reason whereof hooremongers and adulterers should flatter them selves / and have
the more lyking in their own vices and sins. Of late days also, a certain
gray friar said openly in his sermon / in a worshypfull ^owne / that if ye old
law were yet still remaynyng / by which, women, which had committed adultery,
should be stoned to death: an hole mou^taigne made of stones heaped together,
would not suffice to ye stoni^g of those, yt were worthy to be stoned to death.

THe second yuell or harm is cosyn to this before rehearsed, The second yuell.
yt many men by ye reason hereof, do flatter their own vices, that is to
wit, by the comparison or worse vices: as for example / when he which is all
together defiled with horedoms and adulteries, seems to him self pure and
fautles / when he lerneth by hearing of confession, ye foul kinds of lechery,
committed with fendes, or with brute beasts: or else when he does get knowledge
and perceyuyng, that such men are laden with great sins, whom he did suppose
and believe to have been conning men / sad / and virtuous. For such is the
nature, and disposicion of men: yt every man does gladly exaggerate, and make
^ery heinous other men's defaultes / and does extenuate and make very light
matters of his own offenses.

I herd ones a certain divine, which loved well the company of unchaste
women, report, yt he herd ons a certain man / which had the rule and
governance over certain nuns / say to him in confession / that him self
had defiled.CC. virgins. By ye reason hereof, he that reported this tale, did so
flatter him self / and think his own offenses light / and in a manner to be
none offense at all: that as it appeared by him / he would never purpose or go
about to exercise and use chastity.

THe third disco^modite and harm is, The third yuell.
that this confession causes many priests to be more proud and high minded /
whom god would to be fathers, and not lords. Now he is lord over another man
/ which knows his secret counsels and priuities. Neither can that man but
fear / which has disclosed his own secrets to another man: and co^me^ly he
does despise / which knows any such secrets of another man's. It seems
therefore, that by confession is taken away liberty and fredome from christian
men: among whom Christ would not yt there should be any dominion / and also
that charity and love is quenched: for who soever fears, hates: and scarcely
can yt man love, which knows any foul and shameful thing by another man.
At the least wise, doubtless he does less regard him, for asmoche as he has a
weapon, wherwt he may undo / destroy / and make afraid the person that has
confessed such things unto him. And in case that the preeste be more
virtuous, than that he will abuse the knowledge of such secrets: yet for all
that there do happen many things often times by chance, which are taken in
to suspicion. So by the reason there of it comes to pass, that there is no
sincere or faithful ^rendshyp between him that makes confession / and him yt
hears it.

THe fourth yuell or hurt is, The fou^th yuell.
that the party, which makes confession / often times does happen upon yuell
and lewdly disposed priests / which under the pretense and cloak of
confession, do commit sins, not to be spoken or rehearsed: and in stead of
leaches or phisicio^s / are made either fellows and parteners / or else masters
and teachers / or else disciples and learners of fylthynes and vice. would god I
might seem to have written this in vain and without cause / and that we did not
every where se and here so many examples hereof / which neither I do remember
without sorrow / neither can rehearse without shamfastnes.

The fyfthe yuell.
THe.v. discommoditie and harm is, that this confession brings many men in to
ieopardie of their good fame, and of their life / by the means of certain
priests / very laueshe and liberal of tongue / and which do not keep closse /
but babble out what soever they do here in confession. And what member of man is
there more slypper than is the tongue? whom shall a man find / which will not
by occasion, utter any thing to his friend in counsel / to whom he dare show
asmoche as has been showed to him self? because I will not speak of many
persons / which are endued with such natural disposition / that they should
brast / onles they did blabbe out that, which has been showed unto them of
trust. would god this defaute were only restyng in women. Here I do not doubt
/ but unto every man over many examples do come to mind and remem^rau^ce /
from the rehearsal of which, I do wyllyngly and gladly forbear.

Besyd this, though we do grant the priest to be sobre and closse of tongue:
yet for all yt, often times hatred and debate sodeinly rysyng, breaks the
bars or rayles of silence: sometime dronke^nes also does the same / which
causes the thing that was secret and hid in the hette, to swymme and flete
above in the tongue. Finally syckenes or frenesy suddenly risen, breaks this
silence / which thing, I my self, when I was young, did know to have
chau^sed in a certain curate: which wha^ he was waxen hoote in his sermon /
did by name utter and disclose the sins of many women. And thexamples are not
selde or gesome of them / whom it has cost their lives / the words that they
have spoken to the preeste in counsel, or confession. Now are there also
certain cases excepted / in which it is laufull to utter and bewray him, that
made his confession. But unto these cases certain me^ do impute and blame what
soever thing does move or stir them to blab out ye secrets showed unto
them. Some other men do think, that they do not offend / so that they
forbear ye names: though they do s^launder and defame an hole house / or an
hole college, or company. And yet who could be content, or take pacie^tly, to
here his city, or his country besprent or spotted with infamy? But how many
men have I herd report at feasts and bankettes, before al manner men that were
present, what they have learned by ye confession of certain persons, being
than deceassed: thinking that they might do that thing laufully / albeit
that no man being alive would be contented that his own memory should be
infamed and sclau^dered among them that should come after him? Last of all,
princes do otherwhyles require of priests / and compel them by oath to utter
and bewraye the doer of the crime. But I, as I would greatly commend and
allow it, if ye priest, not bewrayinge the man, could provide for the
saluegard of ye common weal: so would I not take or account him for perjured,
Nota.
though he so do swear that he is ignoraunte / when he is demanded of such
things / whereof he ought not to be demanded. Now it seems a cruel thing,
and agay^st all humanite, to expose and set forth any man unto this so great
ieopardie: namely seeing yt there are so many examples of them, that be in
ieopardie by the reason hereof. Moreover, this burden of confession does seem
not only to charge and grieve sore him that makes confession: but also the
priest that hears confession. For though I do pass over, and speak no
word, how grievous and how paynfull a thing it is to a good and well learned
priest, to spend so much time in hearing the fylthes and sins of man's life
/ otherwhyles (as I have said) even with the ieopardie of his own integrite,
chastity or clennes / and to suffer and abide the stynkyng and unwholesome
breathes of them that savor and smell of garlycke / or which be infected with
syckenes and disease / namely, saying that many are diseased and combred with
lepry / which are not yet kept aparte, or with the french pockes / which is
a spice or kind of lepry / considering there is no way more sure and
undoubted to take infection by / than by taking in the brethe of the person
diseased: so that besides the pain and grefe, there is not a little ieoperdie
also joined thereunto. I say, though I pass over this, yet how hard and how
sore a thing is it, yt a curate, being a man young of age / and in his flowers
/ and profitable to the common weal, for his learning and virtuous manners, is
compelled and driven unto this necessite / that if he be called, he must at
mydnyght enter in to the chamber, where he that is sick of the pestilence has
empted his belie / has perbraked / or else where he does sweat / is bathed
/ is anointed / is seared / which is diseased with the french pockes / and
must be feign to remain and continue still this ieopardie, until the person
so diseased, have fynyshed and made an end of his confession. Neither is it
sufficient that he has gone ones: but he is sent for / and called again and
again / as often times as the person lyinge at the point of death / and now
past his wits does say, that he did forget, I wot not what. For these
causes divines do deduce and make an argument, that this confession was
institute of men, and not of Christ. Actuum. 15.
For saying that Peter, the chief of ye apostles did judge and think it not
reasonable nor mete to lay upon the ge^tyles the yocke of the law of Moses /
which neither them selves, nor their fathers were able to bear: it might seem
a very cruel thy^g / if men should have laid this burden of confession upon
men's necks / which alone is a more heavy and paynfull burden, than was all
the whole law of Moses / with the ceremonies whereof saint Peter did judge and
think Actuum. 15.
that the gentiles were not to be charged and laden / yea and did exone rate /
discharge / and unlade / even the jews also of ye same / when brotherly
charity does seem rather to move and exhort us here unto / that asmoche as we
may, one of us should lyghten or ease the burdens of an other. Math. 19.
Christ did not compel or bind any man to keep him self single / and to live
soole without a wife: and should one man bind another man to so paynfull a
thing / as is this confession. 1. Cor. 7.
Paul appliinge him self to the infirmite and weykenes of men, does remitte
and release somewhat of the precepte of ye lord: and how than (say they) should
they be so bold / which are not to be lykened or compared unto Paul / to lay
on such a burden upon men's necks / over and beyond the precept of the lord?
namely confession, being as it is now a days, so intricate and made
comberous with doubts and scruples invented by men: that scarcely any man does
depart from ye priest with a quiet and restfull conscience.

THe syxte disco^moditie is, The syxthe yuell.
that this vncoueryng or disclosyng of the secret offenses committed / yea and
even of the thoughts also / seems to teach boldness and vnchamfastnes. For
after yt men have ons or twyse so overcome shamefastnes / that they dare
confess such things unto a priest: they are by so much made ye more bold
to do and commit what soever they list. At this po^^ be the prestes
Now is shamefastnes the chief keeper of innocency. And there are certain
vices of that kind and sort: that the rehersall of them does welnere infecte
/ than does the doing or actual co^mittyng of them.

The seventh yuell.
THe seventh disco^moditie is, that this rehersall of secret crimes and
offenses does bring many weyke and feeble persons into desperation / and
certain persons also in to frenesy: where as principally we should study and
go about / that the sinner might take trust and courage of Christ's promyses
/ and that he might love, rather than fear. For who soever shall not have
conceived this affection and mind toward god / yt man does make his
confession all in vain? But the ouermoche careful and scrupulous rehearsal and
rekenyng up of the general and special kinds of sins / and of the
circu^staunces aggreuyng the offense / and drawyng it in to another kind /
does call away the mind from love toward god / and engenders hatred and
desperation: namely saying that certain men have enta^gled and enwrapped this
busynes of confession with so many snares and grynnes, yt a man can not lightly
find one that does depart and go away from the preeste with his conscience
utterly quiet and at rest.

This disco^moditie or yuel chau^seth most specially in children / women / and
aged folk / and such as be by nature of a timorous and a fearful my^de: of
which sort I do know many one. And tha^ is there more ieopardye also / when
such persons do happen upon a sharp and a chiding ghostly father.

The eight yuell.
THe eyghte disco^modite is this, There ar other some over bold, and yt trust to
much / which when they have thought and ben purposed either nothing at all /
or else very sleyghtly, of the chau^gyng of their life / neither have they
conceived in their mind a serious and ernest detestation and hatred of their
life before led: do yet reken and think this to be sufficient for them selves /
if they rehearse unto ye preeste what they have done. And if he do pronounce the
absolution. But there is nothing more pestilent and perylous, than this
confidence and trust. And there want not priests / which do flatter such
manner persons / or at ye least wise do wynke at the^ / and let as though they
saw them not / and all because they love better, and set more by the lucre /
which confession and the rehearsal of sins does bry^g unto them: than they do
love or set by the health of souls, which is brought or caused through love
toward god / which love dryueth away all supersticion and fear. And hereof
it comes, that we do here so many men, after that they are comen from ye pest
/ bourde and ieste in this wise: I am free and quite delivered from this
burden / I have cast it all together in the friars hoode. Such manner
persons are to be revoked and called back from such manner confidence and
trust.

THe nynthe yuel or harm is, The nynth yuell.
that the exaction and byn^ynge of men to make this confession / seems to give
unto many men an occasion of hypocrysye. For albeit yt it is a very onles he be
in learning / in ryghtnes of mind / and wisdom / but most specially above al
other things, The preeste ought not to come to here confessions: but being
very able therefore / and also wi^h great reverence and due prepa^ation.
in virtue / able and mete therefore. And though he had in other things / and
at other times / any carnal and worldly affections: yet at such time as he is
about to here confession / he ought to take unto him self, the person of a
priest / and not to have any thing before his iyes / but god alone: whose stead
he does after a certain manner, there represent or bear. For if they, whose
life is fylthy and unclean / yet when they come to receive ye sacrament of the
blessed body and blood of Christ / do preapre them selves, that they may not
come unworthy to it: even likewise ought he, yt is about to here confession /
to prepare his mind unto this, so earnest, and so holy a thing / lest
playinge the yuell physician / he do both encreace the spiritual disease and
syckenes of his neighbor / and also do provoke the wrath and indignation of
god against him self / and either of them depart from other, worse than they
were when they came together. But now a days for the most part / fylthy /
and covetous priests / unlearned / light / blabbes / and some also mad
brayned / and some time also dronken / for a little v^gracious lucre, do offer
and preasse in them selves unto this so great a busynes. And a great part of
the defaulte and blame hereof, is in ye bishops: whose part and office it was,
diligently to take heed and provide / that unworthy and unable persons were
not so commonly received to the order of preesthode. For it is better to have a
few priests, Better few prestes and good: than many either unprofitable, or
else noisome.
being mete and able / than a flock of such as are unprofitable / because I
will not say, noisome or hurtefull. But far most diligently of all, they
ought to have provided, that no cure or charge of any flock, were committed to
one, yt were not mete therefore. The same admonition is given unto the
prouincialles and chief fathers of ye gray freers / and of the black friars /
which specially of all other, are wont to take in hand this office and
busynes: yea otherwhyles also do prease in them selves / which that they have
gotten place / it was long of the exceeding and notable ouersyght rechelesnes
of the persons, and other pastors. For this office is not to be deputed and
assigned to every mane^ man. Now a days we do se none more gredye and
desirous to here confessions / than young prestes / or such as be unlearned /
or else be lewd of their conversation and living. For such as are wise and
virtuous, Good priests, and such as are wise^ are loathe to here confessyons /
but when they must needs.
as often as they be drawn unto this busynes: they do declare well enough,
that they would not do it, except either charity did move them / or else the
auctorite of their superior / or the necessite of the office and charge taken
upon them, did constrayne and drive them thereunto. Consydre and look well
about, what manner persons those are / which make so exceeding much a do /
and do so greatly rage, if any man speak any thing of the auoydyng and
eschewyng of the supersticiousnes of making confession: and thou shalt se,
that they are hungrye fellows / covetous / given all to the bellye / yea some
of them also fylthy / and abominable: whose ryotousnes / covetousness / and
voluptuousnes / if confession did not maynteyn and uphold: they could never
cry out in such wise as they do. A well ordered common wealth, does not admit
or receive every manner leche or physician to cure the bodies of men: and to
cure the souls of men / is it enough to have a hode / or a shaven crown?
Temporal judgments of vile things, are not done, but of them that are sobre
/ and fasting: and unto this busynes do they come from feasts / dronken / and
ready to sleep. It was therefore the perte and duty of the bishops / or else
also of the heed officers and rulers / to chose out such persons / as are
mete to take this office upon them / both in age / in living / in learning /
in trustynes / in wisdom / in myldnes: and on the other side, to keep from it
such as are unprofitable, and unmeet therefore / or if they have made a
defalte, sharply to punish them. And he, which purposes and is about to be
confessed, ought also to provide for him self in this matier / that he do
chose an able ghostly father / and that he do not lyghtely change him / whom
he has found and proved to be good. In the syckenes or disease of the body /
we do look about to get an able and a connyng physician or leche: And do we in
the sickness of ye soul take what manner one soever he be? Namely seeing that it
has been known certain times by experience / that curious lay men have
disguysed them selves like priests / and so herd the confession of such as
they desired? And such as have not yet any judgment in this matier / either
by the reason of youth / or for lack of knowledge: they ought to be helped by
the wisdom of their pare^tes, and of their teachers / and to be showed unto
whom it shall be most expedient for them to make their confession. But now a
man may se many men / which purposely do chose unto them selves ye worste
ghostly father yt they can find: to thentente that they may with little a do,
be rydde and delivered of this hateful busynes. Such manner of confession is
no confession: And not much more fruit or profit do they take of confession
/which lyghtely, and as of custom do go unto the preeste. He that purposes,
and is about ward to be confessed / let him remember and think that he goth
about a great thing / and most serious and ernestfull of all other: and let
him so study to confess him self / as if he would never make confession
again. Confess the ones: as if thou would never confess again
For penance is as it were another baptism. Now, no man does receive
baptism, but with this purpose and promise / that he will never do or commit
that thing / wherefore he should again be baptized. So likewise, though because
of the weykenes and fraylte of man's nature / those persons be not rejected
and refused / which often times falling again / do return unto the medicine
and remedy of penance: yet for all that, he that receives and takes open
penance, what mind and purpose yt penitente ought to have.
ought to be of this mind and purpose / that he had lever ten times suffer
death, tha^ ons to commit the same offenses again / for which he does now
wayle and sorrow.

In old time, in very many churches / those persons were not received to open
penance / which after they had ons done penance were relapsed and fallen
again. So desirous is the church, that there should be no recidination and
retourny^g again unto sin / if it might be. And herin likewise as in very
many other things / the care of me^ is all out of order. The preposterous and
disordered care of me^ / as concerning making of confession.
They do very carefully trouble and busye them selves, that they may faithfully
and truly reken and nombre up their offenses and sins unto the priest / and
that they do not leave out any special kind, nor ouerhyp any circumstaunce:
(and in deed these things they ought not to leave undone) but whiles their
minds are all together occupied in these things / that thing is neglected and
not regarded / which is the principal point of all the hole busynes. First
of all therefore they ought to confess their sins unto god. First and
principally confess the to god.
But it is a very hard thing to confess unto god / which hears not but ye
voice of the heart. which thing if it be ons done, It is no small nor easy
things to confess the to god.
than it is an easy thing to make confession unto the preeste. That former
part therefore of this busynes is to be handled with so great study and
diligence, as it alone were sufficient. The principal point of this part is
/ that a man do inwardly, and from ye heart root / conceive a loathe and hatred
of sins / not of one or two, but of all things that do offend and displease
god: and that not for fear of vengeance and punyshement to be done either by
god or by man / but of free love toward god. Nota.
For that man, which does so far forth hate his sins / that he would fall
to them again / if he might be unpunished for them: that man, I say, shall not
escape the fire of hell. And he, which does so abhor and hate dronke^nes /
that yet nevertheless he gives his mind to unlawful loves: He that hates
sins for ye love of god, hates all sins.
doubtless he does not hate sin, for the love of god: for else he would
likewise also have hated, what soever thing does offend and displease him.
Besides this, yt purpose of chau^gynge and amendynge the life, is neither
stable / neither f^utefull: onles it do spring and come forth of the love of
god. Now it lyethe not in a sinners power to give unto him self this
affection and mind / it is the free gift of god: but yet it is to be desired
of him with tears / with prayers / with alms deeds / and with other virtuous
and godly works. It is expedient other whiles to beseech and desire the
intercession of good and virtuous men unto god for him. And in case that it be
not forthwith granted, that is desired: yet must he not therefore cease and
leave from his good begynnynges and purposes.

God often times does differ and put of his gifts, God otherwhyles
differreth his gifts to ye more advantage of the receyuer.
to the^tent that he may give them more habundantly: he is beninge and liberal
/ and he gives his graces and benefits freely: but he gives them not to idle
and recheles folk. Therefore that man, which of the consideration of his life
synfully, and fylthyly before led / and of the fear and dread of the fire of
hell / does conceive and gather in his mind some detestation and hatered of
his sins: let him not forthwith run to ye priest / but let him continue in
weeping and sorowynge / and by prayers Luc. 11.
let him seek / let him ask / let him knock / until he shall perceive and
feel another kind of fear joined with a sure steadfast purpose of chaungyng
his life / and with love well hopyng / when he shall feel this spirit / which
Paul calls the spirit of the sons: let him beware / that he do not
ascribe any part hereof unto him self / but let him knowledge it to be the
free gift of god: and casty^g him self at his feet, let him give thanks to
his bounty and goodness / prayinge and besechynge him, that he will according
to his goodness, grant that thing, which he has freely given to continue and
always to encreace and wax more and more. And let him not so trust to his own
purpose, yt he do think him self able of his own strength to absteyne and
refrain from sins / but with great dread let him desire and call for the
heavenly help / that the same will vouchsafe to establyshe and help forward
the purpose / which gave it. But this purpose does not only contain the
eschewynge of sins: but also of all things, by which he was wont to be
tempted and provoked to sin. when a man is ons comen unto this point / than
is he restored again to the church / than is he made of the deuylles slave,
the son of god / than is he free from sin / and (as it is to be hoped) free
from pain also / if his sorrow for his sins / and his love to wards god
shall have been very great. How little a thing than is this, that remains
behind / if thou do compare it to that is gone before? He that is verily
ashamed of him self before god / he shall be the less ashamed before man: but one
shamfas^nes shall drive out another shamefastnes / and one sorrow shall drive
out another sorrow / likewise as one nail dry^eth out another. Proverb.
Neither shall be grieved faythefully and truly to discover unto the priest
these things / which he shall not tell but ons / namely if he do remember and
think that he does speak unto god by the preeste. Merues^ous good and wise
counsel.
And it shall be a wise point / that every man do every day examine his own
conscience / and confess him hertely and unfeignedly to god, renewynge his
purpose: or if he may not have laysure to do this for busynes / at the least
wise, let him do it ons in a weke / with a purpose to go to the priest / as soon
as time and occasion shall offer it self / onles the weykenes of his
conscience be so great, that he can not be quiet, onles he shryue him self
forthewith unto a preeste. I will not here search and discuss, how much men
ought to regard and set by those snares / wherewith certain men have entangled
this confession: I mean of the power of the priest / to whom confession is
made / of the cases reserved of the ce^sures. But yet I would wysshe for the
tra^quilite and rest of consciences / that bishops / and popes / to whom soever
they did give auctorite to here confession / that unto the same they would give
authority to assoyle from all sins / of what soever kind / or what soever
greatness they shall be of / and also power to release all manner censures /
only in the court of conscience. Finally, to dispense in all such cases / in
whihe the perplexite ryseth of the co^stitutions of men / as for example / in
matrimony, which is made between kynnesfolke in those degrees / which are
not excluded by the divine scripture from liberty and power to co^tracte
matrimony the one with the other / or between those that are joined together
by spiritual cognation or kyndred. Also to dispe^ce with vows / namely if ye
offense that is committed, be committed thrughe error or mistaking / and not
thrughe malice. And in other things also, auctorite to release the common
law, for greatte and weyghty causes. For who shall better perceive / whether
it be expedient, that this thing be done / than he, to whom all the whole life
of the man has been disclosed and made open? But this thing might be done by a
more redye and shorter way / if the popes would now for necessary causes,
abrogate and adnulle certain constitutions / which in old time they brought
in for good and devout causes: and also if they would declare, with which
constitutions they will men to be bound unto sin / and with which not, (if it
be so, that a man may bynd unto any sin.) For whosoever have power and
auctorite utterly to abrogate and adnulle the constitution: the same also have
power to cause, that it shall not bind to sin / onles there be joined also
thereunto a stubburne and disobedient malice. But as long as things stand in
this state, that they be in / I would counsel and advise every man to chose a
priest / which beside learning and virtue, has also laufull authority / that
no scrupule or grudge do remain in his mind / wherefore he should need
afterward to make his confession again. But that auxite and precise diligence
in rehersing and declaryng all manner circumstau^ces, Ouermoch precise and
scrupulous rehersall of sins, is not to be allowed.
I do not greatly allow: for asmoche as that, which is rehearsed concerning
this matier in the master of the sentence / is welnere every whyt taken out of
the work / which is entitled, De vera et falsa penite^tia: The work De uera
et falsa penitentia, is falsely ascribed to saint Augustine.
which work, it is evidently known to be falsely and wrongfully fathered
upon saint Augustine. Likewise I do not allow the ouermoche fear of them,
which, as though under every stone a venomous scorpion did sleep / as it is
said in the proverb: Proverb.
do make every offense a deed syn. Of which sort I also knew a certain
person many years ago / which fasting ye day before / had about supper time
eaten some little thing that had sugar in it. And when he stood at the altar,
prepayred and made ready to sing mass before the people / and the chief lord
of that place, which than was present / and by washing of his mouth, had
perceived some taste of a crumme of sugar / which (as I guess) had stycked fast
in a hollow tothe: he came in all y^ have unto me, being very careful and
ha^fe dead for fear / and asked me counsel / whether he ought to do mass:
I laughed at ye weykenes of the man / and bad him be not afraid / but go to do
mass boldly. And such manner scrupules and doubts, do commonly rise and
spring of constitutio^s made by men. For it is constituted and ordained by
men, (and yet not but well,) yt the priest shall be fasting, when he does
mass. By the reason hereof certain men are wonderously troubled and amassed in
their minds / if whiles they wasshe their mouths / it fortune a little drop
of water to go down in to their throtes / and either they do absteyn from
doing of mass / or else they do mass, with a fearful and unrestful
conscience. But this was not the mind and intent of them / which made that
constitution / that if any man perhaps ministryng unto a sick man / had
tasted his mete before him / and whiles he does spytte it out again / somewhat
happened to go down in to his stomach: that he should therefore absteyne from
doing mass / as though he had broken his fast. Here some men will say it is
a point of godly mi^des / even there also to fear syn / where no syn is. I here
it, and I hold well with it / but yet a man al his life time to do none other
but fear: it may seem no less monstrous, than if a man should always
continue stylle a child or an infant. I had lever yt a man were
supersticiously devout and holy / than boldly and licenciously wicked and
sinful. But we se it happen most commonly, that those persons / which in
such manner things as this is, are most superstitious and fearful: in
weightier things are merueylously negligent and recheles. How many men have I
my self known / which durst not have been bold to do mass / if they had
thrughe unawares, tasted any little quantite of gynger, to put away the
wambelynge of the stomach? and yet the same persons were never a whyt
affrayde to go to ye altar for to do mass / hauy^ge in their breast great
hatred toward their neighbor / and purpose to be reue^ged upon him? But true
charity, which dilateth and enlarges the mind / and sure and steadfast hope
and trust conceived toward Christ: does asely and sone put away all such
manner scrupules and grudges. In like manner certain men do vex and trouble them
selves about ye manner and study or labor of ye pparation, which those men do
say, ought to be most diligent and perfect / that desire and will to glory,
not in the flesh only / but also in the consciences of me^. Therefore moderate
and mesurable pparation of men / according to their power, I will with a good
will allow, and hold well withal, so that they have perfect hatred of their
sins / and a sure and steadfast purpose to change their life in to better.
But yet for all this, ye man shall be less troubled about the preparation /
which shall have accustomed him self (according to my counsel) every day,
or at the least, ons every weke, by searching his own life, to confess him
self unto god. Confession ought to be as compendious and short as is possible.
And this thing he ought to study and mind / yt makes his confession: that
he do make it as compendious and short, as he can possible / that he do not
lade the ears of the priest with things superfluous, and more than needs.

This thing shall be brought to pass / if he do rehearse only such things,
which not without good cause, do charge and give the conscience: of which sort
are such sins / as be either without doubt deadely / or else are vehemently
suspected, to be deadely sins. And yet are not venial sins to be made
light of / specially in thexamynyng and amendyng of our life. Ueniall sins
are not to be made light of.
For they, if they be neglected and not taken head of / do bring men unto
greatter and more wayghty offenses: and they (if we do give credence to saint
Augustine) being received and tet in by little and little, of one side and other
/ do inco^clusion dre^che the ship of the conscience / no less than does an
horrible great wawe / which suddenly ouerwhelmeth the ship. There are
certain persons / which of confession do make a communication or talkyng /
babbling in ye mean season of every manner things: and this defaulte have
peuyshe women specially, which have a delight and pleasure, at the least this
way, to common and talk with men / and to pour it out in to their bosoms /
if they be any thing myscontented and angry toward their husbands / or their
neighbors. I have known certain persons / that do confess them by a
confessionall / and that a very long one / which they had learned without book
perfectly by heart. Out of it they do rehearse and reken up, not what offenses
they have done: but all the offenses that possible might have been done. Than
which thing, there is none more peuyshe, after mine opinion and judgment:
neither does it become the preeste / either to demand any thing / or to
mengle and bring in any thing there / but only that, which belongethe to
penance: neither does it become the party that makes confession, to speak
any thing else, but of that only. Now what tales are told secretly / and
what communication is had under the name of confession among many persons:
it is more co^me^ly known, than is expedient. Certain do excedyngly commend
and praise it, Often making of general confession.
often times among to make confession / and that general: and they do
counsel men to iterate confession / be it for never so slayght a cause: from
whom I do greatly dissent and disagre. I do reken and judge it a great thing /
if a man do ons faithfully and truly open and disclose his crimes and offenses
unto the priest / and does wasshe them away with the shower of tears: though
he do not wax old in perpetual and continual sorrow and mournyng / but taking
courage and good trust / do merely and cherefully buckle and prepare him self
unto thexercise of a better life. And if it chance him to fall again unto
sin / let him only rehearse those things unto the preeste / which he has
committed and done / sithe the time that he was last confessed. For else
confession is made a thing of custom, rather than of remedy: and the thing
begins also to like and please some men / which of it self is vnplesau^t, I
mean, to trouble and stir often in the dyrte and mire of sins: and in ye
mean season shamefastnes, which (as I have said) is the most surest keeper
of innocencye is forgetten / and by little and little laid a part. Some men if
they have affection to a thing / they have never enough of it
Such is the nature and condition of some men / that in that thing / which
they have begone to like and cast a mind unto / they are never satisfied, nor
have enough. Like wise as in old time it seemed a devout thing and well done
/ that every day some co^memoration were made of the blessed virgin and mother
/ which can never be praised enough. There was said in the honor of her,
Anthem of our lady.

content them: but they have put to besyd this, the knollynge of a belle in the

it is uncertain and doubtful / whether Gabriel did great our blessed lady

what entente and purpose speak you these things? Uerely to show, that many
things / which sprange of good begynninges: are through the affections of men,
carried forth and grown paste measure. The same thing seems to have happened,
and to have come to pass in confession.

First, Confession ons in the life.
it seemed a thing commendable and well done / to make confession ons in the
life. After that, it was commanded to be made every year ons. Confession ons
in the life.
All this seemed mesurable enough. Than began it to be exacted and required of
men twyes in the lent / besides the commandment of the church. Confession
twyes in the lent.
And there are some men also / which do dispute / that a man ought to make
confession again, as often times as he falls again in to sin. Some again
are there / which do require, that a man should reken again a fresh, all the
sins that they have done al their life time before / if it have fortuned him,
through forgetfulness / to ouerhyp and leave out any sin untold / oneles he do
come again to the same preeste, unto whom he had made his confession before.
There are invented and devised diverse and sundry causes of repetynge confession
/ neither is there any end of making confession. The priest, when he is
about to do mass: he makes his confession ones or twyes to a preeste.
Again, when he comes down from the alter: he makes confession, the, proheme
and first beginning of the mass. This seems to be done because of the people.
Again, after that the gospel is read, The mane^ in Italy.
the manner is in Italy / and paraduenture in some other nations also / that
the paryshe priest does turn him self to the people / and in stead of
declaryng of the gospel / pronou^seth the common form of confession, and of
absolution. And according to the old manner and custom / when men are about
to enter in to the church / they are sprincled with holy water. The same thing
is done again to them, when they do depart from the church. And this is also
a certain manner of confession. Besides this, the sacrament of the body and
blood of Christ, is not given to lay people / except they be shryuen before.
Again, when they klene now down before the alter / confession is required
and called for of them: at which time it were better, Nota.
that the priest did say some thing unto them, that might kendle ye my^des of
them, that are houseled / in to the love of him / whose body and blood they do
receive. Finally, when a man is in ieopardie and like to dye: how often times
is confession offered to him? And wha^ the very ghost and breathe is even now
passing forth at his lyppes: there is present either a preeste, or a friar /
which does ask, whether he has forgotten any thing: and wha^ he is now
dead / than is the absolution pronounsed to him. Let no man think, that these
things are spoken to the despite and hatred of confession: Nota.
but at that time another song were more mete to be songen / of the love of
Jesus Christ toward mankind / of hope and trust toward his goodness / of
the promyses of the gospel / of ye miseries and wretchednesses of this life /
and of the joys of the heavenly life.

The form and manner of confession.
BUt thou perauenture, good reder, do look, that I should teach the some
form or manner of making confession / which you myghtest follow / to rehearse
all thy sins, so as you ought to do, unto the preeste. For this use very
many me^ have made little books / and certain have also put forth books in
the vulgar and common langage / reckoning up what soever syn either is
committed / or may possibly be committed among men. As I do not deny it to be
well done, that such books be read of men that are strong, by reason of age
/ and experience of the world: so in my judgment it is ieopardously done, yt
they are sparpled abroad among the common people. And much like defaulte do
the priests commit / which do of al manner men demand questions,
concerning all manner vices: having no regard or respect unto the sex / unto
the age / or unto the disposition of the person / whom they have in handlynge.
And saint Thomas has written most copiously and largely of the genealogies of
virtues, and of vices. But we do now write these things principally and most
specially for lay men. And therefore a more simple, and a more plain way and
manner is to be sought. The knowledge of the creed or belefe, and of the
commandments of god, is necessary to living well: although there were no
necessite at all of maky^g confession to any man. These things the persons
and curates ought ons a year, breuely and plainly do teach unto y^ people:
and also by little books made out in to the vulgar tongue, to prynt them fast in
the minds of them. How be it often times to here sermones and preachynges,
Hearing of sermons.
does greatly prepare a man to make a good confession / either to god / or to
man. To the same also does help greatly the redyng of holy books. Redyng of
holy books
Now the heed of all the commandments is faith / which works by love. Of
love there is two sorts: the love of god / and the love of thy neighbor.
Th^se things known / every man shall easily and sone perceive / where he has
declined and swarued from those things / which belong unto faith, and
charity. And faith ought not to be light, Faith.
or fletynge only in the lyppes: but inwardly and depely rooted fast in the
heart / that there may with the mouth confession and knowlegynge be made,

to health and salvation. This faith consists and stands principally in this
/ that we do believe, what so ever thing the divine scriptures / received by the
consent o^ al christian people / do either tell and rehearse to have been done in
times passed / or else do promise for to be done in time herafter to come / or
else do command to be done: and that all the whole hope and trust of this
present life / and of the life to come / be set in god. But how many thousands
are there of them / that have professed the name of Christ / which do either
mystrust / or else doubt of the rysyng again of the bodies: and some also of
the immortalite of souls?

And we do se the most part of men / namely of those yt are preeminent and
excellent in honors and dignities / to live after such manner and facyon /
that either they do seem not to believe ye holy scripture / or else not to
think of it. which persons, if they did often times among ernestly examyne
them selves: they should find and perceive them selves to be far away from the
office and duty of a christen made. But this is the fou^tayne of all sins.
And to have been negligent and recheles in this behalf: is even it self a
great and weyghty offense or crime. Of which thing, the common sort of
christen men toutchethe nothing at all / supposyng it to be sufficient, if
they do rehearse and reken up their dronke^nes / their adulteries / their
theftes / or robberies. we ought to pray much more busily and continually, we
ought much more effectually to desire the increase of our faith / than any
temporal commodities
that god will increase faith in us: than that he will give us health of body
/ or that he will grant us plenty of corn and vitayles. And y^ spark of
faith is often times among to be quikened with other exercises and passetymes
/ as with the study of holy scripture / with ye communication of good and
virtuous men / with holy and devout meditations and thoughts. Certain men do
confess, that they do not believe the creed and symbol of the faith. Such
confession is no sacramental confession / onles it be made for this purpose,
that either they may be taught of the priest, and be converted to the faith: or
else that they may by some manner means make satisfaction to the church. To
have doubted of ye faith / or to believe but coldely and fayntly / is a matter
of confession: not to be without believe. These two therefore are the two
principal squiers or rules / by which we must try and examyne all the manner
and facyon of our living: Faith and charity are the two rules / by which all
our acts are to be tried and examined.
I mean, faith / and charity. And the same two are also the fountaynes / out
of which issues or spri^geth every work, that is pleasant and acceptable to
god: which two fou^taynes / if either they be corrupted / or else be utterly
wantyng: even those things / which seem to be virtuous, ar vices: what soever
spryngeth of pure faith and true charity can be no sin
neither can that thing be syn / what so ever spryngeth and comes forth of
pure faith, and true charity: although it have the semblaunce and apparau^ce
of sin. Contrary wise, these persons, are utterly void of faith, and
charity: all their life is none other thing / than one continual sin (if I
may so say.) But the common sort, and most part of men, being occupied and
busyed about ye bows, and the leaves / takes no head of the roots: where as
both the first / and also the most diligent search and examination, ought to
be made about the roots. There are some me^ / which have set up a mark unto
them selves, either riches / or worldly glory / or dignite among men: and
every man for the^tent to hit his own mark / do many things in apparaunce
virtuous and godly: they do give ames: they build monasteries: they do fight
for their country. But whether with such manner good deeds, they do displease
god, let other men l^ke: without doubt, they win no favor or thank of god.

Nota.
Contrary wise, those persons, which being illuminated and lyghtned by faith
/ and brennyng in charity / do direct all the operatio^s and works of their
life to these marks / I mean, faith / and charity: even also, wha^ they do
refreshe and conforte their bodies with meat and drink / when they do
refreshe their minds with sport and play / finally, when they do sleep: they
do win or get the favor of Christ unto them selves. And there be also
found certain men / which are naturally of such disposition / that they do
help no man hertely / but they do measure all things by their own profits
and aduauntages: and yet they do seem free and void from great and heinous
offenses / that is to say / they are no dronkardes / nor whoremongers. They do
pray, and are very diligente and devout in gods service. what need many
words? both they think them selves holy / and so also they are reputed of
other men.

There is none other disease of ye mind more incurable, than is this: and
therefore by so much the more a wise and discrete gostly father ought to give
a diligent mind to the healynge of such manner persons: and they do all in
vain flatter them selves / and stand in their own conceypte / as though
they loved god for him self / when either they do not love their neighbor at
all / or if they do love him / they do not love him for gods sake / but for
their own profits sake. Of these two fountaynes, Princes and prelates.
specially princes and prelates are to be enfourmed and taught / which do
nothing well, onles they do bear their office, and use their auctorite to ye
honor of god, and the profit of the common weal.

Faith therefore drives away, and puts by all those lewd excusations,
which the malicious craft and subtilte of men is wont to inuente and deuyse.
If I do give any thing to poor folks / I shall want and lack my self. If I
shall exercise and use byeng and sellyng, and mine occupatio^ or craft, without
fraud or gyle / in the stead of gaynes / I shall sustain and bear damage and
loss. Such manner men do plainly mystruste these promyses of almighty god.
Covetous me^ mistrust gods promyses.
Cast thy care and thought upon the lord / and he shall nouryshe the. Psalm.
54.
I have not seen a right wise man forsaken. Psalm. 36.
And first of all seche you ye kingdom of god: Math. 6.
and all these things shall be added and given unto you. Do they suppose yt
god is a liar / that he will not perform those things / which he has
promised? Or else do they wene, that he is impotent, and unable / that he may
not perform his, pmyse? Or else do they trow / that he is recheles / that he
does not mind the care of his servants?

This same faith shall conforte virtuous men / if the kyndnes of men do not
recompense their benefits / nor show kyndenes again / according to their
deservings. God is faithful / and true of his promise: to whom they have
lent their benefits / he shall render and restore them their own stock,
which they have laid forth, with inestimable encreace and advantage. But it
is commonly seen / that those persons / which allege such excuses / do lose
and cast away very many things, in revel and riot / in fleshely lust / and
in dysynge and cardynge: to whom even that lucre and gaynes also is lost,
which they might have gotten / if they did not love ydlenes / better than
they do lucre and advantage. Such manner of men doubtless are shameless: if they
do say, onles I did use fraud and guyle / I could not live. Charity.
Now charity or love stretches it self (as it was said before) unto two
things / that is to wit / to god / and to thy neighbor. Here offer them
selves unto us, three persons / the father / the son / and ye holy ghost /
being all three one god / which is to be loved above all things / both
visible and invisible. But he loves not god / who soever mystrusteth his
promyses / who soever sets naught by his commandments / who soever
makes any thing egall unto him / or pferreth any thing before him / that is
to say / who soever loves his life better than him / and who soever does fear
less to offend and displease him / than he does to dye even a thousand
times. The person of our neighbor stretchethe far and brood. Here it is
to be considered / whether we have done our duty, yt we are bound to do / to
our wives / to our parents / to our children / to our teachers / to our
scholemaisters / to our pastors or curates / to the prince / to ye heed
officers / to our kynsfolkes / to our friends / and to those that have done us
good / breuely, to all christen men. Moreover / each man is neighbor to his
own self / and no man is more grievously, and more sore hurted / than of him
self. Thou haste hurt and appayred thy neighbors good name: Confess y^ of
it. But thou haste blabbed out thine own rebuke and shame / either through
dronkennes / or else thrughe lyghtnes of tongue: weep, and be sorry for it. Thou
haste two manner ways hurt thy neighbor / that is to wit / thou haste hurt
thy self / and thou have also hurt him / to whom you haste blabbed it forth.
He that will diligently bethink him self of all these things: he shall soon
call it to remembrance / if he have done any thing worthy repentance. And
this thing shall help his remembrance well / if he reken with him self, A
manner and way to help remembrance.
in what places he has been conuersaunte and abydyng in ye mean season / in
what businesses or matters he has been occupied / and among whom he has lived
and companed. For so by that mean, one thing shall ever bring another to
mind. There are some men / which even of their own selves do fetch places
(as they call them) of making confession. For every sin, either it is
committed by the mind / or else by some of the five senses, or wits. Unto
the mind do appertein / faith / and love / toward god, and our neighbor: and
the vices contrary to these / namely those spiritual vices / envy hatered /
wrath / and desire of vengeance / pride / hypocrysye / yuel will / and
malice. And albeit yt every sin yssueth and comes forth from the fou^teyne
and spring of the heart: yet that notwithstanding those sins / which
apperteyne to glotenye / and riotousnes / to lechery / to violence / and to
doing injury, are referred to the senses, and to the members of the body. The
iyes do commit many offenses and sins / and many also do the ears commit /
many the bellye / and the throat / many the hands / but of all other me^bres /
the tongue does commit most. For what soever sins are done of all the
members, in diverse and sundry manners and facyons / and all those offenses does
the tongue alone commit. The tongue casts forth blasphemies The offenses
committed with the tongue.
against god / ye tongue back byteth and speaks yuell of the neighbor / the
tongue departs and breaks in sundre amiable peace, and co^corde / and
styrreth up cruel and deadely bataylles or wars. The tongue joins and
brings together foul and sinful lovers / and plucketh in sundre holy and
virtuous loves and frendeshyppes. The tongue with flaterynge / with backebytynge
/ and sclaunderynge / with fylthy and rybauldous communication / does infecte
and poison pure and clean minds. The tongue without either sword, or poison /
kylleth and sleeth both brother and friend. what needs me to make many
words? This tongue teaches heresies / and of of christen men makes
antichrists and adversaries to Christ. These things I suppose are sufficient
for lay men to thexamination of their conscience: so yt they do know the
common creed / and the su^me or effect of the doctrine of the gospel. Now, yt
I may add somewhat (rather for cause to put men in remembrance, tha^ to teach
them) unto those things / whihaue ben very copiously and largely taught of
divines / concerning the circu^staunces of sins / concerning omission, and
restitution. They do syn, who soever, to the^tent yt they would know the
perreners and fellows of him yt makes his confession / do enq^re and demand
of those circu^stau^ces, No man ought to discrie another man's offenses in
confession, if he may otherwise do.
whereby the persons also may be known. And no man ought to utter and disclose
the sins of other men to the priest: if it may by any means be eschewed and
avoided. For other whiles it can not be avoided / but thou must needs utter and
bewray the person / as for example: If any woman have lain with her own
father: Or if any man have provoked his prince to unjust and wrongful
battle. Here in this case, they do counsel to seek such a priest / which
does know neither of both persons / or at y^ least wise, not the pertie /
which thou would not to be discovered. Again, in those sins / which are
committed through fleshely lust, and lechery / certain men of a lecherous
curiosite and desire of knowledge / do enquere, and demand such things, as are not mete, nor ought to be demanded. For likewise as he, which has had
carnalli to do with a woman / does very well and right / to add and show
further / whether he has committed adultery with another man's wife / or else
incest with a nun / or whordome with a common harlotte / or fornication with a
syngle woman / or else rape with a virgin: even so it is nothing needful to
reherce and show all the forms or manners and facyons of doing the fleshely
act / which does not change the kind of the sin. But here ofte^tymes they
do leave out the circunstaunces / which are more apperteinyng to ye purpose /
than are these common circu^stau^ces. They make a distinction and separation
between adultery, and sengle fornication: Single fornication in some cases / by
reason of the circu^staunces, is more grievous offense than adultery.
but oftentimes by reason of their circu^stau^ces / fornication is much more
deadely offense / than adultery. For that man does lyghter offense / which by
chance, through occasion falls in adultery / tha^ does he, which lyinge a
long season about an honest and a simple virgin, comen of honest pare^tes /
and purposed and appointed to an honest marriage / and by long co^tinuau^ce with
malicious crafts and means / prouokyng and temptyng her to folly / at the
last does defile her: and when he has done, afterward making his vaunte and
boste of his sinful deed / brings her in infamy, and an yuell name / and
also makes her common to other men. which thy^g to certain courtiers, seems
also a propre and a merry passetyme. Also that man does less offense / which
finding a thing by chance in a hallowed place / takes it away secretly,
when he is in need and necessite: than does he / which without any necessite
or pouerte co^straynyng him / enters in, in the night time with weapon in to
another man's house / and robs the coffers of a lay man: or else, which
does rob a poor man / which had much a do with his bodily labor, to find
his wife, and a greatte many children. Neither is only consideration and
respect to be had of the time / of the person / and of the place: but also a
regard is to be had unto ye malice of the mind / unto the greatness of the
temptation. Furthermore, unto how many the hurt of one syn does come / and
how many do take harm thereby / as for example. If one does kill a man / of
whose cou^sayles ye whole common weal did hang: he does with this one sin
hurt many men. Or if one does counsel and move a prince unto tyranny and
cruelte.

Now as touching ye syn of omission / and also tra^sgression / a greatte
part of men does esteem and judge them by the constitutions of men / as for
example. Omission and tra^sgression
If a man did not here mass on the sunday: or else did eat flesh on the
frydaye. But those omissio^s are more grievous and weyghtie / which are
contrary to the commandments of god: as if a man, when he has gotten and
found occasion to help, and succurre his neighbor / have nothing regarded
it / but left it undone. Also he does more grievously offend and sin /
which enuieth his neighbor: than does he / which does not refrain from
eating of flesh on the frydaye. And the omission is the more grievous / if it
be so, that the leaning of the good deed undone, be joined with ye great hurt
of his neighbor. For that man kylleth his neighbor / who soever sees him in
ieoperdie of his life: and when he might save his life, will not do it. Again,
the omissio^ is ye more grievous offense / when malice or wyckednes succedeth in
to the place of the good work / which he ought of duty to have done. As for
an example. why ye sunday was instituted.
The sunday was i^stituted and ordened for this intent / that a man should by
laysure, having rest from other bodily occupations / examine and search his
own conscience / and reconsile him self to god: and that by devout
conte^platio^s / by prayers / by heryng sermons / by holy and godly
co^municatio^s / or by holy redi^ges / he should stir up charity and love
toward god, and toward his neighbor. Here they do twyes offend / and do
commit double sin / which do spend and pass forth ye whole day / with
folyshe plays / with whordome / with dronkennes / with rybauldous
communication, and filthy tales / or else with brallynge also and fighting. And
with this sin do they specially and principally offend / which are high
above in auctorite or dignite / as princes / bishops / persons / curates /
abbottes / common officers / and householders. For these persons rehearsed / as
they do not sin / but to the hurt of many men: even so they can not cease,
and be slack in doing their office / but to the hurt of many men. For it is
not sufficient and enough for the Pope / Pope.
if he do not him self stir and raise up wars and bataylles between
princes: but also it shall be rekened in stead of a great sin to him /
except he have studied and labored to the vttermoste of his power, to allaye
and cease the wars already risen up or begone. Princes.
So likewise it shall be laid to a princes charge / not only if he do spoil
or oppress the common welthe: but also, if he do not exclude unjust officers,
that ministre not justice egally and in differe^tly / or such as otherwise are
oppressors of the common liberty / wha^ it lies in his power to do it. But
than it shall be double sin: if being corrupted either with money / or with some
other affection / he shall both wittyng and ware thereof / commit an heed
office to a leude and a noughty person. So likewise the bishop does double
offense and syn / Bishop.
if not only him self be not diligent and busye to make his flock better /
but also by his yuell doctrine / or else by his leude and noughty living, does
make his flock more corrupt: or else being corrupted with some crooked
affection / he does wittingly commit the charge and ouersyghte of his flock to
an unable and unworthy person. In asmoche as these things are thus / he that
is a prince, or a bishop, ought not to be idle or negligent and recheles: but
at every occasion to be diligent and busy to profit and do good. How be it
every man also, privately and severally, ought to do their endeuoire to the
same / that if they be able / they may, when occasion is offered / do good to
their neighbor / the rich man with his good / the learned learned man with his
auctorite / the eloque^t man with his eloquence, and good and goodly vtteraunce
/ the old man with his reverence / the gracious and well-beloved man with his
favor / the young man with his industry and witty diligence. Young men do
shryue them of the frayes and braule / or of the whordome that they have
committed: but they do speak never a word, how that they have suffered so
much of their youth to pass away vnprofitablye, and without fruit / when
they had occasion to learn those things / which might stand them in stead
all their life time. In these things therefore a man may find often times
folyshe judgments, and quite out of order / both of their perte that makes
confession / and also of theyrs, which do here confession. If a prince do
confess, yt he has killed a man with his own hand: in deed he does confess a
grievous crime. For it becomes the life of a prince to be in every point
inculpable, and blameles. But the same paraduenture does not confess and
shryue him self / that by the reason of the bataylle / which he has begone
through ambitiousnes, or wrath / so many innocents are slain / so many men
vndeseruynge it, were spoiled of their good. Finally, yt so many abominable
sins, not to be named, are committed and done. He confesses it, if happily he
have, contrary to right, usurped any man's goods: but he does not confess,
that wittyngly he does selle the office of Escheter / to a man, openly known
for a raue^nour, and extorsioner / and unright wise / by whom he knowethe well,
yt innumerable people shall be spoiled, and robbed. Here it is to be considered
/ what is every man's propre office and duty: and thereof is ye sin of
omission to be esteemed. The peculier and propre office be^ongynge to a bishop
is, The office and duty properly belonging to a bishop.
to feed his flock with holy doctrine. But paraduenture he does neither
feed them him self / neither does give diligence to provide yt they may have
able and mete pastors: but either for lucre, or else for favor / commits ye
cure and charge of the souls, to unworthy persons. He passes not upon it to
make confession hereof: but confesses him self paraue^ture of his harlot / or
of leaving his euensonge vnsayde. Likewise the propre office and duty of a
prince is, The propr^ office of a prince.
to provide that no wrong be done to any man / to maynteyne and uphold the
common liberty and tra^quilite. But here he, speaking no word of so many and
so heinous injuries and wro^ges / which are done by his commandment / or at
ye least wise by his negligence and ouersyghte / confesses, that he has some
day not herd mass / or else, that he has left his matens / or euensonge / or
some of the hours vnsayde. But these were not the peculier and propre defaltes
and sins of princes. For this manner is cropen in now a days in to the
courts of certain princes / that they do every day say over the whole
service of the day / as the priests do: and in the mean time are sure, yt no
man shall trouble them, nor break them of their prayers. For who dare be so
bold to trouble a prince / or speak to him / when he is occupied in his
prayers? I do not disco^me^d nor disalowe devotion and holiness in a prince (if
it be so, that devotion and holiness does stand in these things:) but I do
disprayse it / if they trusty^g to these things / do neglecte and leave undone
those things / which specially and proprely were apperteynynge to their
office. There are so many wydowes / and so many fatherles children / which are
oppressed wrongefully / and against all law and right: there are so many
poor men / which do suffer many piteous and cruel wro^ges. God is not angry
nor myscontented with a prince / if for such causes he shall suffer his prayers
to be troubled and broken of / yea even the hearing of his masses also: For
always, and in all things, man's constitution ought to give place to a more
perfect work or deed of charity. Man's co^stitution ought to give place to
a more perfect work of charity.
Therefore the principal and chefest study and care of the priest ought to be
/ yt he may know in what state of life he is, that makethe the confession. And
for asmoche as he that is confessed, does speak to god by the priest (as
certain men have said, and not amysse) there ought to be right judgments,
as being before god / which judges all things after the affections of the
minds. But now the most part of men do greatly esteem and make much of
these things / which are belonging to the flesh, and to the ceremonies: and
very little or no thing do regard these things / which are belonging to y^
spirit. Again, those things which are instituted and ordained by men / they
do greatly set by: but those things / which are commanded of god / they
neglecte, and make light of them. For who does not execrate and abhor it /
if a preeste go with his crown vnshauen? But no man abhors it / if he do
find a preeste dronken, and fighting in the stewes^ who does not have a
monk or friar in abhominatio^ / if he do wear a lay man's garmente? But how
it is accounted and taken but for a play and passetyme / if a monk / or a
friar / abiding in his habit / be a whoremayster / be dronken / does subuerte
other me^nes houses / does exercise and occupy neocromancy / and such other
arts magycke. It is taken and accounted for an horrible o^fence and sin / if
a preeste shul^e go to mass / or say his matens / being not fasting: But it
is accounted for a sleyghte mat^er, and for a very tryfle / if a preeste do go
to the altar to do mass / his brother not being reconsiled / whom he has
offended and hurt. Though a cause could be showed, why and wherefore men do
punyshe more grievously those things / which are more sleyghte, and of less
weyghte: yet doubtless in confession there ought to be strayghte and right
judgments.

Restitution
Now ye very course of our speech has brought us to the mention of restitution
/ concerning which, I do not profess or promise / that I will teach any new
thing: for asmoche as this matier has been treated and tossed of divines in
many and huge volumes. Only I will admonyshe and give warnyng / in what point
very many unlearned men do amysse / and are ouerseen. Concerning making
restitution of money, or of a garment / they are wondersly careful and
troubled in their conscience. But he, which with pestilent and poisoned
communication has corrupted and venomed ye minds of simple persons / he
which with his venomous tongue has taken away from his neighbor, quietness and
rest of mind / he which with backebytynge and sclaunderous words, has
appayred and hurt his neighbors fame and good name. They which with leude
and ungracious counsayles / have provoked and styrred up princes / or the
people unto wars: these persons (I say) do think but lyghtely and sleyghtly
of making restitution and satisfaction for ye hurt and damage, that they have
done: and yet for all that, many men do set more by their good name, than by
their life: neither is there any thy^g, wherein restitution has more convenient
place, and ought more to be made than here. But in these things (they say) it
is scarcelye possible at any time to make restitution. Uery truth it is / and
therefore by so much the more they ought to labor and ^o about to make
restitutio^ as far forth as they may: and they ought always to be sorye,
that they can not make restitutio^ perfectly, and to ye full. Now there are
certain unthrifty and leude courtiers, Courtiers.
which think, yt they have made a fair and a goodly amends to the maiden
whom they have defiled, yea and often times also after that they have defiled
her the^ selves, have made her common to other: they think (I say) that they
have gayly recompensed the loss of her virginite, and honesty / if they do at
the last bestow her upon some fellow in marriage, and give some little sum of
money with her: yea and in a manner they do think, that them selves ar worthy
reward, for that the young damsel has gotten an husband, what manner one
soever he be. In deed she is married / but to a simple, and god wot what manner
a person: which being a clean maid / and of good name / should have been
married to an honest and a worshypful person. Neither does marriage wipe away
the blotte of her yuel name. O goodly and propre satisfaction and amends: and
yet some men trusting and being bold herevpo^, do continue and hold on to
corrupt and defyle mo, one after another. How be it even in those things
also / which do only make us poorer. Certain things are done so commonly, and
euerywhere / yt by ye reason of custom / they do not seem to be any theft at
all. And of this defaute co^me^ly ar dispraysed al artificers and crafts men
welnere / which have ye ha^deling and ordri^g of other men's stuff: but
specially and chiefly myllers, Myllers.
and tayllers: Tayllers.
in so much that it is a proverb also commonly said / that every man is a
thief in his own occupation and craft. But among those yt are of this sort,
they do most greuouslye syn / which do corrupt meats and drynkes / and the
vitaylles ordained for the suste^tation and nouryshement of man's body / as
for example. Uinteners.
They which do corrupt and mar wine / either by powryng water in to it / or
else by putty^g in alume / lyme / brymstone / salt / and such other unwholesome
things: for these persons do not only steal a man's goods / but also they
do mynyshe and hurt the health of the body / and they are not far away from
poysonynge of men. For how many sicknesses and diseases / how many dethes do
we se by experience to rise and spring among men of wynes corrupted? And yet
for all that, this is accounted but a play and a iape. Neither do they begyle
any man more gladly / than such as were in no wise to have been disceyued. For
brotherly charity does require this / that ye equite and good conscience of
the seller should succor and help such buyers / which for lack of skyl and
knowledge, can not certeynly judge of the ware. But now a days, how many
shall a man find / which does not at every occasion go about to get lucre,
with fraud and gyle? And so though we do all live with tearinge each other in
pieces: yet do we for all yt think our selves christen men. And these things,
because they be turned in to a common custom, we do not so much as ones
confess at all: or if we do confess them, we reken it su^ficient and enough,
to have told to the preeste what we do. Besyd this, who are more bound to
restitutions / than great rich men, and me^ of power? And yet to those men
restitutio^ seems to apperteyne nothing at all.

They run to compositions. Co^positio^s
I do not conde^pne nor disalowe what soever manner of remedy: But I fear me
lest god will not ratify and allow many of the compositions, that are made
among men. They say, that they should not have whereof to find their wives and
their children / if they did restore all such things, as they have wrongfully
taken away from other men. But by rauynes and extorsions, they were made great
estates / and have advanced and promoted their kynnesfolkes and friends / they
live gorgiously in pomp and superfluite. If they be in very deed repentaunte
and sorye for their offenses and misdeeds: let them forsake and give over
harmefull and damagefull dysynge and cardynge / and such other ryotous
gaming: and in stead of riot / excess / and waste / let them exercise
frugalite, and temperaunce / let them exercise husbandrye / or some other
honest work. By this mean it shall be brought to pass / that they shall
have, whereof they may make restitution. Let them teach and bring up their
children to the same things. when they have done all these things diligently,
to the very vttermoste of their power: than that that shall be wantynge unto
their goods / the composition peradventure shall supply and make up. Certain
men do thus excuse them selves / saying, that the parties are deed, whom they
have deceived and beguyled of their goods: yea but yet ye heirs of them are
living. Other some again do say, that they do not know the perties whom they
have robbed / but in ye mean season they do labor and go about to know them /
and they suppose and believe them selves to be safe and quite out of ieopardie /
if with a little money they do purchase and bye justifying of their good.
Iustifienge of yuel^ gotten goods.
Those persons that do justify yuel gotten goods / why do they not by the
same reason as well justify adultery and ma^slaughter? For a little money even
those persons also do compou^de and make their end / which have robbed
churches or monasteries.

Can than these persons also be ignorant / to whom they should make
restitution? But they are affrayde to bring them selves in to an yuell name.
They ought than to have feared this thing / when they went about to do that
myscheuous deed. How be it even here in this thing also is some remedy: Let
them make restitution by some suborned person / whom they know right well to
be faithful and trusty. To conclude, if we do receive and allow such manner
excusations: I do think and judge it to be ye surer way / yt such money be
given to poor folks / rather than to co^missaries. Moreover, there are
certain kinds of rauynes and theftes / which few men do confess / so far
of is it, Certain kinds of rauynes and thef^es which are nothing regarded.
that they do not think of making restitution. Such things as I do mean /
are specially and chiefly committed in pactes / couenauntes / and bargaynes. I
was present at dinner / where a certain person, one of ye company, did bost
and make his vau^te, that he had sold an horse for.vj. angel nobles / which
he confessed not to be worth.vj. pence. Do not vinteners and tauerners every
where, Uynteners and tauerners
now a days / to those yt can not skylle of wynes / selle one wine for
another: as wine of altissiodore, or spanyshe wine / for gascoigne wine / or
wine of Louaine, in stead of Renyshe wine / and small wine vnmeasurably
allayed with water / for a full and pure wine of it self? who among all these
that thus done / has any purpose or mind of making restitution: albeit that
it is very rauyne, and robbery that they do? Is it not accounted and taken now
a days, for a play and a good sport / to sell a dogs skin, Skynners or
furriers.
for a skyn of some fine and costly furre: or to sell clothe dyed without purple
and vngrayned, for scarlet in grayn? who is he, yt of an vnskylled byer or
chapman / will not get four times ye price and value of ye thing that he
sells, if he can? I know what men of law do say / yt the seller is not
bound always to make warra^tyse, and to make good the defaulte of the thing /
which he has sold? But yet such persons are not assoiled and quite by ye
law of ye gospel / which says: Thob. 4. Math. 7.
do not y^ thing to another man / which thou woldeste not to be done to thy
self. Men of law.
what advocate or man of law did ever confess / that through his either
negligence, or else craft / the sueter has lost his possession? Soldiers and
men of war.
what shall I say now of soldiers / which do excuse all manner of sin and
myschiefe, by the law of battle or arms? But it is the law of the devil /
and not of bataylle. The law of war is ye law of the devil.


Likewise carters and shypmen / which have taken upon them the carriage of
wynes from one place to another / Carters and Maryners.
do as it were by a certain liberty and law of their own / draw out and
drink as much as they list / and that of the best: and in stead of
excellent good wine, do pour in noughty water: wha^ otherwhyles that / which
is delivered them, is carried to a sick and diseased person. which of them
does confess this as theft? which of them thinks of making restitution?
Because this sort of men are hard necked / stubburne / and sturdie / ye
priest ought in confession, not only to admonyshe and give them counsel: but
also sharply to rebuke them / and utterly to pluck out of their heart / which
they are wont to allege for them selves. They say, that it is the law or
liberty of carters, and maryners, in vitaylles / and yt they do so all. But
this law is written in the tables of ye devil / and not among the laws of
Christ. And taylours have also found a color, Taylours.
to excuse them selves. The stuff (say they) is put forth to us, that we should
thereof make an honest garment. Now, that will a good workman, better make of
four yardes: than an vnconnynger workman of mo yardes. The overplus therefore,
that is spared and left, is the reward of his connyng and craft: and ye
owner, yt puts forth the garment to the making, is satisfied / contented /
and pleased. After this facyon, no man shall hang a thief / neither, if he, yt
is pe^hed and e^dited, might be his own judge / and give ye sentence his own
se^fe. Let him yt put forth ye stuff, be asked the question / whether he do
think and judge him self satisfied? I pass over goldesmythes / and certain
sellers of precious stones / which do corrupt ye stuff that is betake them /
with mengling of other worse stuff / and which dymynyshe of that, which they
have received / and which do selle cou^terfait stones / in stead of very
natural precious stones. And it is marvel, yt here in this thing even ye
civil also do sleep: which do co^de^pne a poor thief to ye galowes / which
has pyked out.v. grotes of a ma^s purse, retchelesly kept, and lyinge at
large. In these things, whereof more hurt and damage comes to ye common
wealth: it were convenient otherwhyles, to give some example, by the soore
punyshement of one / whereby other may be feared away from doing of the like.
As for such things as do happen in the corrupting and the valuing of coins /
because they do apperteyne to princes and rulers, I will say nothing at this
time. In our book of a christen prince, we have touched somewhat concerning
this matter. I come now to them / which do let forth their work or labor,
Laborers y^ work by y^ day, or by the weke.
according to the quantite and measure of the time. These persons do not
think, that they do commit theft / if they do fynyshe the work that they
have taken in hand four days space / which they might have made an end of
in one day: and in the mean while, they be fed with another man's meat /
and take their whole wages for every day / according to promise and
covenant. Neither do they think that they make any lie / when they do promise
that they will do that thing / which they do not perform. And how do they
(trow you) excuse their leasyng? This is a point (say they) of our occupatio^
and craft. Nay, it belongs to their occupation, truly and faithfully to do
that thing / which their craft promyseth to be done / and not to lie or
steal. But yet poticaries and phisions do more grievously offend / than
Poticaries and phisicio^s.
do these persons now rehearsed / which have a proverb among them, quid pro
quo, one thing for another. They do otherwhyles sell this thing, for that
thy^g / they do minister stuff that is rotten, and without any virtue or
strength / yea and now hurtful / in stead of remedy and helpefull medecin.
The byer asks for rebarbarum / and they do give him rebarbarum above fortye
years old. There is no spice / no gum / not only there is no root / none
herb / of so durable and virtue and strength / but in long process of time,
the virtue of it will be quite gone and lost. But they do say / if we did not
mengle old stuff and new together / and so utter the one with the other / we
should else be stark beggars / and might famyshe, for all our occupatio^. I
say, it were even better also to die / than unto thy sick brother (whom you
ought even freely without money to succor) for to ministre that thing,
which shall augme^t and increase his disease / yea or paraue^ture also be
cause of his death. The defaulte and offense of the poticaries, redou^deth also
to ye phisicions. And here in this thing it were right and according, that
the common officers and governors of ye cities, or common weals, did their
diligent cure and busynes. Charity byddeth, yt in the time of necessite and
need, we should succor and releue our poor and nedy brother. And yet certain
men do think them selves to be good christians: which do enhau^ce and augment
ye price of their wares / according to ye greatness of their brothers necessite.
Some man has a pome granate / which peraue^ture stood not him in an half
penny / his neighbor lies sick, and is in ieoperdie of his life / and there
will none be gotten any where else: here yt pome granate is holden at.xl. d. and
for less it shall not be sold. So likewise certain men do lay up corn / to
thente^t, yt if there fortune a penury and scarcite of corn to come / they may
sell for four times or ten times the value: and they do not perceive, that
this is very rauyne. I have set forth these few things for cause of example:
other things the wise reder shall guess and gather of him self.

I will make an end, had I first spoken two or three words concerning
satisfaction. Satisfaction commonly called penance


There be two manners of satisfaction / that is to wit, open satisfaction /
and private or secret satisfaction. In open satisfaction, I would that this
auctorite should be committed unto the priests / to whom soever auctorite is
committed to here men's confessions / that they might according to the
circumstau^ces moderate and measure the said satisfaction or penance / or
also if need so require / even to turn it in to private and secret
satisfaction. For if the fathers / which did institute and ordeyne open
satisfactions / do grant this auctorite to ye ordinarye bishops / that they
may according to the qualite of the person / either augment or diminishe ye
pain enjoined: why should not the same power and auctorite be committed to
them / which in the thing far most paynfull of all other / do bear and
fulfill ye bishops rownes? And if they be not able nor mete for the office and
charge committed unto them / than the defaulte and blame thereof redoundeth to
ye bishops. And in ye satisfactio^s or pains, The preeste enioynyng secret
penance ought to have the propretie of a connyng physician.
which are secretly enjoined / the preeste ought to cou^trefayte and follow
connyng phisicions, which do not prescribe and appoint every manner medecin to
every manner man / but yt only, which they do know to be most profitable and
helpful / according to the nature of the disease / and accordy^g to the qualite
of the person: in so much yt even in one and ye same disease / they do
prescribe one medecin to him yt is strong / and another medecin to him yt is
weyke and feeble / another manner medecin to him that is brought up after this
facion / than to him that is brought up other wise. Yea moreover, sometime
even in the same kind of sickness and disease / and to the same person / they
do minister one medecin in his youth / and another sundry medecin in his
age. But now a days a great perte of priests do prescribe and enjoin
nothing else / but certain prayers and orisons. Read (say they) the psalm,
Miserere mei deus / with the collecte, Deus cui propriu^ est misereri. etc.
Besides yt, the Antheme, Salve regina / with the collecte, Co^cede nos famulos
tuos. etc. Also the psalm, De profundis, for all christen souls / with the
collecte, Fidelium deus omnium co^ditor. And I do not yet disprayse and disalow
these things, I do know that the merit of obedience is great: but yet they
do much / which do prescribe, and enioyn such prayers as have special
remedy and help against that vice and yuel / through which they perceive the
maker of the confession to stand most in ieoperdie. Of which kind and
sort, there have been certain psalms showed of our forefathers: as specially
mete to obtain this thing, or yt thing. And it shall not be unprofitable, in
the stead of prayers, to prescribe and appoint unto some persons, the redyng
of such a work / which may engendre hatred of the syn / wherewith he yt
makes confession is enco^bred and enfected: as for example. If any man be
enfected with the ^uperstition of ye hethen paynyms / or else be leaning and
affectionate toward the ceremonies of the Jews / and has no good opinion of
ye christen faith / either for lack of knowledge / or else being corrupted
with the redynge of poets, or philosophers: let him be bydden to bestow every
day one hour or two in redynge of Lactance / and in redynge of those books /
which Origene / Tertullian / Cipriane / Chrysostom / or such other, have
left written against hethen paynyms / against ye jews / or agay^st heretics.
For it is uneath possible / but that he, which has ons atte^tly read ye
books of Origene / written agay^st Celsus / shall have better opinion of
Christ's most holy doctrine. There are diverse books of holy fathers / written
of the praise of chastity / of the disprayse of backebytyng and sclaundre / of
the information and instru^tion of religious men, and clerks / of keeping of
wydowhed / of the office and duty of bishops / of the office and duty of a
prince and governor / of ye holiness of matrimony / of unite and concord /
and of other inumerable / either virtues or vices: of which works, yt redyng
is to be e^ioyned unto every man / which may most remedy and heal the vice,
wherwt he that is confessed, is encombred and holden. But he is in the mean
season to be admonyshed and cou^sailed / that he do read it atte^tly / with a
pure and perfect purpose and desire to amend his life. But generally to young
men / which for ye most part, are in ieopardie to be lost through ydlenes: it
shall be expedient to enjoin certain labors of study. And I do not greatly
commend those ghostly fathers / which unto persons, being yet of tender age
/ which has a certain wanto^nes belonging unto it, do perscribe fasty^ges, or
watchinges, It is not very commendable to enjoin much fasting or such like
pains to very young folks.
or other labors / which do betake and deliver a weyke and sykly body unto
greater age. Youth or the first age, is much better amended by reverence of
their elders, and by honest occupacions. To those that are rich, it is well
done to co^mannde and enjoin liberalite toward poor folks: but I thy^ke yt
they ought to be admonyshed and cou^sailed, yt they do not bestow liberalite
amysse. It is not to be disco^me^ded, if any man do bielde or found a chapel
/ an altar / a monasterye / a schole / a college / or any other such like
thing: but yet ye most holy deeds of alms of all, The best and most holy
kind of alms.
are these / which do succurre and releue ye persent need of the neighbors:
and which do as it were vanyshe out of sight between the fyngers of ye gyuer,
and of the receyuer / and the glory and praise whereof is lost among me^: but
is so much ye more sa^^e before god. And they, whose age and the qualite and
state of their body shall seem to require this, that fasti^ges should be
enjoined unto the^: are to be warned hereof also / that (if they be of
habilite) that thing, which they do spare and save by absteynyng from meat /
they do give it forth to those, that are poor and nedye. There are some,
which do enioyn pilgrimages in to cou^tres / as for example: that some man
having on his body a cote of maylle, and beggyng his living all the way, shall
go to Rome / or visit saint Peter's church / or go to Jerusalem / or to saint
James in Compostella. which kind of penance, I will not verily disalowe. But
it is not well done, to enjoin such things as these, It is not well done to
enjoin far pilgrimages to them, which may yuell be forborne at home.
unto them, which have at home wife and children / to whom ye absence of them
should be either painful, or ponderous and dau^gerfull. And there is danger and
ieopardie also, in co^mau^dyng such things to yo^ge men / or to women being
of yt age / that for the keeping of their chastity and honesty / it should be
more expedient for them to abide and tarry still at home. Such manner pains or
penance as this, is more convenient and setting to be enjoined of the
temporal and lay officers. For it is very like unto those punysheme^tes /
when they do beat a man with rods / when they cut of a man's hand / or else do
cut of a piece of his ear / or do put out his yies / or do bore a hole through
his tongue / or mark him in ye forhed, or in ye hand / with a bre^ni^g whote
iyerne. Neither were those sole^pne pains much unlike to these / which the
church was wont in ye old time openly to enioyn and command: wherewith they
did not so much make satisfaction to god, as they did to me^: Albeit yt they
made satisfaction even to god also. How be it yet even ye te^porall officer
also in my judgment, should do much better and wisely / if he did chastise and
punyshe certain kinds of theft, A polytyke way to punish certain malefactors
/ by temporal punisheme^t
with the iniunction and co^maundyng of work and labors, to ye behofe and
profit of the common weal: and so likewise of other offenses, being in deed
grievous and weyghtie: but yet not so weyghty, that they ought to be punyshed
with death / namely among christen men. Me think (I say) this were a much
better way / tha^ to bren them with an whote iyern / or else to mayheme the^. As
we do read, that in ye old time, The manner used in old time.
the dettours / which were not able to pay / being in bonds / did labor to
the use and behofe of their creditours: and other again being bounden, did
dygge and delue in the feldes / or did hew tymbre. And there be some also of
them / which can some syttyng occupation: such it were mete to keep at work
in prisone. This manner and kind of punyshement, is profitable two manner of
ways. For both it does amend, but not destroy the malefactors: and also it is
profitable and aduau^tagefull to the common weal / or else to him, which was
hurt and damaged by their offense and trespass. To certain persons the priest
shall command and enioyn, yt they shall hertely forgive him / of who^ they
have been hurt or offended / and yt they shall go about to overcome yuelnes with
goodness / prouokyng him to love and frendshyp, with curtesy and gentle word / and
with benefits and kyndnes. If the priest can not obteyn this thing of them, at
the least wise let them grant to cast out of their breast all desire and lust
to be revenged / and that they will no more remember the injury and
displeasure done to them. This manner and kind of satisfaction, has our lord
Jesus him self showed unto us: Likewise as ye holy scripture of god has
commanded unto us alms deeds. The preeste therefore shall have always respect
herunto / yt if he do enjoin an^ pain or labor: that the labor or travail
be joined with a work or deed of charity: and that it be such manner of labor /
which shall not excedyngly hurt and hyndre the health of the body: so that by
reason of it, the body might be the less able and apt to execute and do the
mysteries and services of the mind / but only which may keep under and subdue
ye wantonness of the flesh. Here I list no^ to strive with them / which do say^
that satisfaction does not apperteyne or belong to penance or repentance.
Only god (say they) does forgive sy^nes / and to whom soever he has forgyuen
ye gylte or offense / to ye same he has forgyuen also the pain or
punyshement. For by charity and by ye holy ghost, is losed yt gylte or bond of
sin: which ons losed, there rests no more behind / but only yt he go
forward, and encreace more and more in charity. For this (say they) is the only
satisfaction before god. And of these things they do gather and conclude / yt
not the popes perdons can release any pains / but only those, which man has
enjoined / or which man might enioyn: and yet not so much as those neither /
onles it be for great and weyghtie causes. I, as I will not utterly co^de^pne
the popes dispensations or relaxations: It is a surer way to hope full
^emission of sins, of charity and the mercy of god: tha^ of any pardons
given by man.
so I do think it ye more surer way, to hope full remission and forgyuenes of
sins / of charity, and of ye mercy of Christ / than of any bulls, or
wryti^ges made by any man. If charity be away, what does the bulle profit or
avail? If a man have charity sufficient / than is ye bulle superfluous / and
more than needs. If charity be diminute and imperfect in any perte (they say)
that it can not be perdoned of the pope / which belongs only to god. Thee is
nothing found in the holy scriptures concerning pardones / nor yet in the old
doctours^
As concerning pardons, holy scripture does teach nothing at all / no nor yet
in the old ancient doctors of ye church. The divines of later time, have
always concerning this matier / both varied in their opinions and sentences:
and also have spoken very doubtfully. But what these me^ do affirm auise them
selves: but this is undoubted / that we have the bulle of gospel, Luc. 7.
Many sins are forgyuen her / because she has loved much. Now if any man
do think, yt these things also are not to be neglected and despised: I will
not strive with him / so that he do not upon boldness and trust in them,
neglecte and little regard those things, which undoubtedly are chief and
principal. Of these things, which we have disputed and said / I think it is
evident and open enough / by what means such yuels or harms may be avoided
and eschewed / which by the occasion of confession are wont to happen /
partly thrughe the default of them that here confession / and partly of them
that do make their confession: how be it yet for their cause / which are more
simple / I shall not stycke nor be grieved, after a more plain and familiar
manner, to apply unto every one of the said yuelles their own propre
remedies. Such is the world, that there is nothing, which is not some manner
way viciated and corrupted.

Remedy against the first yuell.
The first yuel therefore or harm that comes of confession, shall less hurt /
if the diligent solicitude and care of ye bishops / and of other / to whom that
charge belongs / did provide and se here in this thing / that ye power and
auctorite to here co^fessio^s, should not rashely, and indiscreetly be
committed to every manner priest: what manner persons they ought to be, which
should here confessions.
but only to men well stryken in age / and whose virtue and good living is
well known: besides this, being sobre / well advised / and close of tongue.
And those priests are to be rebuked / which on their ale be^che do clatter
and babble for their pleasure / what soever thing they have herd in secret
confessions. If any thing shall require counsel / there ought communication
to be made secretly / with wise / sad / and well learned men. In like manner
those also are to be reproved / which in open sermones do babble forth of the
mysteries and priuities of co^fessions / such things as were better to be
kept in, and not to be spoken at al. And the priest yt hereth co^fessions /
shall be more safe from ieoperdie of taking harm: if he do come to his office
and busynes^ being sobre and well advised, and armed before with prayer / and
also with fear and dread. Also if he do demand and ask questions no
further, tha^ is needful to ye knowelege of the crime and offense. Now as
touching to him that makes confession / al be it that there is peril and
ieopardie otherwhyles to him, by reason of the rehearsal and vtteryng of his
offense: yet doubtless there is more greatte and more often ieoperdie to him, of
the ignorance and lack of knowelege of his sins. And therefore a wise and
faythefull minister and servant of god, shall so order and tempre all things:
that neither he shall enfecte ye minds of simple and weyke persons / neither
suffer any thing to be unknown / which being not known, could not be
eschewed, or healed.

And in showing the remedy against the first yuell / we have also showed the
remedy against the second yuell / that is to wit / the silence and
vertuousnes of the preeste. Remedy against the second yuell.
For a godly and a very pastor, is not by the reason hereof provoked to flatter
his own vices: but rather to the dread and love of god / and to pray more
fervently, and to watch diligently for the flock of ye lord: whiles he does
se and perceive in to what mo^struous vices and sins those men do fall / that
either thrughe ignorance / or else through malice / have ons shaken of the yocke
of the lord: which thing they should not have done / if ye pastor, having
cure and charge of their souls / had done his diligence / by teaching /
counsaylynge / rebukyng / and besechyng of them. For else neither ought ye
crimes and offenses of them to be bublished and openly pronounsed and declared:
which for unlawful mixtures, or curyous arts / or for other abominable
offenses / are punyshed according to ye laws.

The third yuell or harm, Remedy against the third yuel.
for asmoche as it does chance or come but through ye defalte of the priests:
it is to be remedyed by setting such priests to here co^fessions / which will
rather weep and sorrow at the yuels or vices of men / than take any pride or
high mind by reason thereof: Likewise as blessed Paul does wytnes and
record, 2. Corin. 12.
that him self was provoked to mourninge and sorrow / for that there were
certain persons among the Corinthians, which did deserve sharp and sore
correction and rebukynge. And otherwhyles the sins and ungraciousness of the
people do rebou^de back unto the prestes heedes: because they did not with such
diligence as became them, teach and show unto the people ye right and
straight ways and paths of the lord. Such manner pastors, when they do
remember in their minds, that the lord shall require his sheep of the
sheperdes hand: it is more convenient and according, that they be styrred and
provoked to repentance, than to pride. what soever offense and sin has any
time ben committed among all the hole multitude of men / the same may be
committed and done of every one of us, who soever he be: and if we have any of
us not committed this sin, or that sin / we have cause to thank the
goodness of god therefore, and not to ascribe it to our own strength and power.
Therefore the common nature and condition of man ought to bow them downewardes
unto compassion or pity: and not to lift them up to pride and high mind. He
is no mete priest, A preeste should have fatherly affection toward his^
flock.
which does not bear fatherly affection toward his flock. Now what father
is there, which is made by so much the prowder toward his son / because
his son is taken and holden with some grievous and sore disease: and does not
rather, being very sad and sorrowful in his heart / make have to get him
remedy? And if men have so greatte desire and delight toward liberty: let
them also have like desire and delight toward innocencye. That man, which
keeps and mainteineth his heith: upon him the physician or leche has no power
and authority at all. And if thrughe thine own defaulte thou art fallen in
to spiritual syckenes and disease: thou must first of all labor and give
diligence / that thou may be free before god. Finally, likewise as in the
disease and syckenes of the body, thou doiste chose the physician or surgeon /
which shall not vpbrayde the with thy disease / but which shall remedy and
heal it: do even the same lykewy^e in choosing of the preeste / which shall
be thy ghostly leache.

The which do allege the.iiij. disco^modie or yuell / what thing do they
else / but only show, Remedy against the fourth di^co^modite.
that there are certain yuell and noughtye priests? would god we might deny
that to be true. But physic or leache craft is not therefore taken away /
because there are found certain yuel and noughtye phisicio^s and surgeons: But
so much the more dilligent provision is to be made, yt there may be good
phisicions and surgeons. So much ye more circunspecte you ought to be in
chosyng him, to whom you will betake thy sele for ^o be cured and helped.
Finally, it is the office and duty of the bishops, so to handle such
priests / which do abuse the sacraments unto fylthynes and sin: that all
other should take example to beware by them.

Remedy for the.v. disco^moditie.
As touching the fyfthe discommoditie / what other thing shall I say: than that
seldom chances are now to be taken in to an example / whereupon to give
general sentence? For how many men have we known / which by the reason of a
fever, or of a franesy, has uttered and disclosed secret priuities? And who
again is so mad / as to give credence to a frantyke person? Besides that,
even here also, it shall be a good help and remedy, the choosing out of an able
and mete ghostely father / whereof I have so often times spoken heretofore. Last
of all, if the crime be such / that the discoueryng of it might put the in
ieopardie of thy ^yte / and if thou doste also mystrust thyn own curate, and
the pestes nere home: thou may go somwhere from home / where thou may make
thy confession to him that knows the not / nor thou him / either chau^gyng
thy clothes / or else in the darke^ Finally, thou ought more to love and
set by the health and save guard of thy soul / than of thy body. To have thy
body cured and made whole / thou do other whiles show unto the bodily
leache thy disease / which came of some heinous offense, and myscheuous deed,
worthy death: and art thou affrayd here, where thy soul is to be cured? Let
this be an answer to him that makes confession. Now as concerning the
priests that do here confession / I do grant and confess it to be a greatte
and a ^oore thing / with evident ieopardie of their lives, to visit them that
are sick of the pestilence / or of such like disease: but you ought to
remember, that they have taken an high office / and a sore charge upon them
selves. And if they will be good pastors or herdesmen: John^.10.
they ought for the hel^he and salvation of their flock / to put even their
lives also in ieopardie / namely, when the souls of their flock are in peril
and ieopardie. It is a very excellent and great work that they do: but they do
it for an excellent and high reward. And they may also in the mean season,
arm and fence them selves before with remedies, against the contagiousnes or
infection. For they are not constrained and compelled to tempt god. Deutero. 6.
And if it be so, yt the priest is necessary and needful to the people / and
does commit or betake him self with full trust to god: he shall not dye
before his day / but god shall fulfill this his own promise. Marc. 16.
And if they shall have drunk any deadely thing, it shall not hurt them.

Uery many of them dare go unto him that lies sick of the pestilence / for a
thing yt is bequest to them: and be they affrayde to come nere him / when his
soul is in ieopardie and peril? And this thing shall be a point of ciuilite
and good manner also in the people / to make the place, in to which the priest
shall be received, very clean / and with fire and fumigations, to make it as
little ieopardous and contagious, as may be. ^yse coun^ayle.
There is also another kind of remedy / if at all such times as the
pestilence does reign soore / every man whiles he is in health / do ones in a
weke confess him self, and be houseled: In the old time, they were house led
wekely.
(which thing in the old time, the most part of men did even in wholesome
time / when no co^tagious sickness did reign at all) and after confession
made, do with greatte study and diligence take heed and beware, that they do
not fall again in to deadly sins: which is no very hard thing to do, with
the help of the grace of Christ. By this means shall it come to pass, that
neither the preeste shall be put in ieopardye of his life: and yet the other
party shall be safe, and out of danger / if either sodeyn death / or else
any such dissease / which for the contagiousnes of it, is to be avoided and
shonned, shall fortune to take him.

Again, even this thing also shall be very profitable herunto: Chief hope of
salvation, is to be put in charity, and in the mercy of god.
if we do put the chief and principal trust of health and salvation / in
charity, and in the mercy of god / rather than in the rehersynge or reckenynge
up of our sins / namely, when death is nere at hand.

Now to say somewhat concerning the syxte yuell / who soever by the rehersyng
of their sins, Remedy against the syxte yuell.
do learn to be bold, and to forget shamefastnes: those persons are not yet
verily and truly penitente and sorye for their offenses and sins. To such
the preeste ought to declare and lay before them / what he is, whom they have
offended / and how great is the filthynes and ouglynes of syn: that ye oftener
they do fall again in to syn / so much more and more they may be ashamed of
them selves. And they are also to be admonished and told / that confession
without contrition of heart avails nothing: which contrition, if it have
ones possessed the mind, it shall both bring shamfastnes, and also put away
shamfastnes: it shall bring shamfastnes / causyng him to be ashamed of ye
filthynes of his sins in the sight of God: and it shall put away shamfastnes,
yt he shall not through shamefastnes hyde and keep in yt thing, which is cured
and healed by openyng and disclosyng.

Remedy against the seventh yuel.
Unto the seventh, thus it is to be answered, yt many moo are in ieopardy of
confidence and over much trust / by reason of neglectyng and not regarding
their sins: than are in ieopardie of desperation, by the reason of
examination and serchyng of their sins: and the priest has more busynes and
labor to bring men away from confidence and presumption, unto the fear and
dread of god / than he has to call them back from desperation. There is a
mean therefore between both / that there be due and sufficient examination of
the sins and offenses / but not ouermoche careful and scrupulous: And if
there be any anxietie and scrupulosite / there follows after it / that does
also recompense it: high and perfect tra^quilitie and quietness of conscience /
after ye charity and love have begone to drive out fear. For fear without
charity and hope, engendre and cause desperation.

Against the viij. yuell.
The remedy of the eyghte disco^modite, I have all ready sufficiently showed.

Remedy against the ix. yuell.
Now as touching the nynthe discommoditie and harm, I do grant, that of the
two yuelles / the less and lyghter is, to absteyne from receyuynge the
sacrament of the altar. If the mind be in certain and steadfast desire and
purpose to sin deadely / so that a man do wrestle and strive to the
vttermoste of his power / against such affection and desire or purpose / and
can not yet cast it forth of his mind. For else utterly and all together to
absteyne and forbear from the sacraments and mysteries: is a degree and
step toward paynymry, and ye manner of living of hethen people. As touching
confession / there is not the same reason and skylle: that is, as touching to
the sacrament of the altar. Neither does that man seem utterly unpenitent /
which gothe unto the preeste with this mind and purpose / not to deceive or
mock: but partly to obey the church / and partly to thentent that he may
by this way conceive and gather more perfect hatred of his sins / which he
can not yet of him self so hate, as he ought to do. For even this also is a
certain spice and kind of repentance: a man to be displeased and myscontente
with him self therefore / because he is not repentaunt and sorrowful for his
sins. And it happens often times / that he, which comes to the priest /
being but coldly and sclenderly repentaunt and sorry: yet whiles he makes his
confession / does conceive just and laufull hatered of his offenses and sins.
This co^memoration therefore and rehersall of the disco^modities and harms, yt
come by the occasion of confession / is not made of us, to thentent that we
should abhor and withdraw our mind from making confession: but to the end
that we may make confess^on with more fruit and profit coming thereof unto us.

THese are the things, most good and honorable father / which me thought
best to be admonished and taught concerning confession / besides the
traditions of old divines / to thentent that confession might be very
fruitful and profitable: which confession shall seem unto any man to be joined
with peril and ieopardie: Let him consider and be^thy^ke him well, how much
more ieopardous thing it is to bear about an unclean conscience. If it shall
seem paynefull and grievous: let him remember and consider how great
tranquilite and quietness of mind does ensue and follow of this bitter
medicine. And let him so much the more diligently take heed and beware, that
he do not again so order him felfe, that he shall need to receive and devour
such a bitter pylle very often. But let him so make his confession ons, that he
need never after to make confession again / and that it may be sufficient to
be ashamed ones for ever, before man. That man shall not lightly fall again in
to deedly sin / which shall have ones inwardly and hertely conceived in his
mind, hatered of all his sins. This holy and godly purpose, god shall help
and bring forward / if so be, that we will knowledge it to be his benefit,
what soever has already chaunsed to us: and if trusting to his aid, rather
than to our own might and strength / we do enforce our selves, and endeuer
daily more and more to amend our living / and to wax better and better /
until that we may grow up in to a perfect man / in to the measure of the
fulness of Jesus Christ. Ephe. 4.
