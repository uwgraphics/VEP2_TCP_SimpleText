there now does flow.

Anno. 1588.

To the Christian Reader.
I Touch not those which godly be,
my pen blames none of them:
I wish no ill to he or she,
but good unto all men.
But this I wish with all my heart,
God grant it may be so:
That wicked persons may convert,
and all their vice forgo.
I wish that virtue may increace,
in every Christians heart:
I wish that wicked vice may cease,
and quite be laid a part.
I wish that England may so frame,
it self unto Gods word:
That other nations seeing the same,
may praise the living Lord.
The cause why that I made this book,
is this I tell you plain:
I would all those that heerin look,
from vices should refrain.
And not all those alone I say,
but all the rest beside:
God grant us now and always,
in him for to abide.
Accept this Treatise in good part,
most humbly I desire:
And let me have of every heart,
good will even for my hire.
Although it rude and simple be,
yet do it not detest:
But where as any faults you see,
of them make you the best.
That I by hearing good report,
of this the first of mine:
May be encouraged with comfort.
to write an other time.
I trust at this my simple work,
there is none will be offended:
Except be those that means to lurk,
in sin while life be ended.
Edward Pecke.

FINIS.
Have thou forsaken Covetousness,
that greedy gulping sin?
Have thou given over thy great excess,
which thou do wallow in.
Or have thou now exiled quite,
the vice of Fornication?
With envious hate and deadly spite,
and all abomination.
From swearing, lying, and all deceites,
do thou thy self refrain?
All polling measures, and crafty waightes,
with heart do thou disdain?
If that thou have forsaken those,
with all the rest beside:
Then may thou say as I suppose,
thou have no more but Pride.
I doubt thy self thou can not clear,
of never a one of them:
The which I have rehearsed here,
with this my scribbling pen.
Wherefore it makes me to lament,
that such vices should dwell:
In thee, for whom Christ shed his blood,
as witnesses his Gospel.
He that does walk thy Coasts abroad,
O England at this time:
May see what strife and great discord,
is in the Children of thine.
Where one there is O England now,
that walks aright in thee:
There is a thousand I dare abowe,
that follows iniquity.
O England, is it not a shame,
and a filthy shame to thee:
That thou which have a Christians name,
should make this true to be?
The mighty God of his mere grace,
did send his word to thee:
To that intent thou should embrace,
the same most lovingly.
But thou forsookest his word and grace,
when he gave it to thee:
And willingly thou did embrace,
all kind of vanity.
And now thou art so trained therein,
thou will it not forsake:
But day and night in horrible sin,
thy pleasure thou do take.
What eyes be they that can refrain,
from streming floods of tears:
To see the vices that do reign.
in these thy latter years?
Wherefore, O England now repent,
thy wicked life amend:
That God, thy God, incontinent,
his grace to thee may send.
And if thou have any respect,
unto thy health at all:
His righteous laws do not neglect,
but come when he does call.
And with an heart and right good will,
his word see thou obaye,
And then he will defend thee still,
from Satan's filthy way.
Thy Usurers if thou root out,
and hoysers up of rentes:
With all the Rogish ruflling rout,
which does defile thy tents.
Then may thou bear Christ's name aright,
then may thou boldly say:
Thou art a Christian clear and bright,
^
But of this thing thy self assure,
O England now I say:
So long as such in thee endure,
from God thou go astray.
Therefore with Christ's Gospel true,
thy Usurers reprove:
With all the rest of Satan's crew,
which he so well does love.
And so if that they will repent,
by Preaching of Gods word:
If the^ will not Incontinent,
on them place Justice sword.
This thing if thou do put in ure,
thy wicked vice shall cease:
And faithful love with virtues pure,
in thee shall still increase.
sword of Justice be not slack,
^leep not in silence so:
Least little England go to wrack,
through vice which there does slew.
Awake therefore, take up thy sword,
and view England about:
And root out those, which at Gods word.
