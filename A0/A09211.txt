A SHORT Instruction unto Christian Religion, Briefly noting our profession,

By Thomas Pearston.

1. Peter. 3. 15. and 16. Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready
always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope
that is in you, with meekenes and reverence, having a good conscience, that
when they speak evil of you as of evil doers, they may be ashamed which
slander your good conversation in Christ.

Romans. 1. 16. I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ: for it is the
power of God unto salvation, to every one that belieueth.

REVERENDISSIMO IN Christo patri Domino Iohanni Londinensi Episcopo
vigilantissimo.
QVm vt inquit Apostolus, reuerendissime Pater, non sublimitate sermonis vel
sapientiae annuntiandum est Dei testimonium, nec persuasorijs humanae
sapientiae sermonibus praedicandum, sed spiritus and potentiae demonstratione:
id est probatione, quae fit certis and necessarijs rationibus, Iesum Christu^
and hunc crucifixum, in infirmitate, in timore, and tremore multo agnoscere
simulac profiteri oportet. Magnopere me haec atque his similia indesinenter
animo inuoluere conducunt, quonam modo hac nostra aetate rudiores (qui quidem
verba proferre, sed non intelligere possunt) Jesus Christi mortem aliaque quae
ad huius vitae normam, and ad futura^ immortalitatem magnopere co^ducunt,
intelligerent. Simplici igitur modo, attamen in Dei timore ad simpliciu^
informatione^ edificationemque principalia quidem ac etiam particularia, tum
fidei, tu^ Decalogi, orationisque dominicae parte^ me^braque breuiter componere
statui. Vestro igitur studio magnaque Dei Ecclesiae cura cognitis ac
diuulgatis: ita veheme^tius tuae reuerentiae has meas perpauas Questionum and
Respontionu^ annotationes dedicare, subque tui honoris nomine promulgare, me
(quasi calcaribus indigentem) stimulauere. Hanc a tuo Honor meam industriam
quamuis minutissima^, accepta fore sperans ad Dei misericordiam, gratiam,
pacemque qui omnium es^ Creator, Gubernator, ac conseruator, Honorem tuum
precibus mei commendo.

Tui honoris obseruantissimus, Thomas Pearston.

A. By Christ, for he has fulfilled it for us.

Q. Should we live careless because Christ has fulfilled the law?

A. God forbid.

Q. What must we do then?

A. Learn to pray unto the Lord God in the only name of his son Christ Jesus
our Lord.

Q. How must it be then that we pray?

A. Thus, Our father which art in heaven, etc.

Q. Why do thou call God father?

A. Because by faith in Christ we be chosen for the children of God. John. 1.
12.

Q. Why say thou our father, and not my father.

A. Because he is not only my father, but also the father of all the faithful.

A. Yes, he is in all places at once, and therefore in our Creed, we call him
almighty.

Q. Why does our master Christ teach us to say heaven?

A. Because in praying we should lift up our minds to heaven whether he is
gone before.

Q. What desire you in this petition? Hallowed be thy name.

A. Here we desire God to give us grace that we may reverently esteem of his
holy word which teaches him unto us.

Q. What more do we pray for?

A. That we might live a holy life agreeable to his word.

Q. What does Christ teach us to pray for, in this petition? Thy kingdom come.

A. That the love of God might be among us, and that his word which teaches
him unto us, might freely of us be received.

Q. How should this be known, that Gods love is among us?

A. By this, if we have love one to an other.

Q. What more are we taught?

A. We are also taught to pray for a patient waiting for of his coming to
judgment.

Q. Are we not also in this petition taught to pray for the increase of faith?

A. Yea, for the more that our faith increases, the more does Gods kingdom
increase.

Q. In that Christ teaches us to pray that Gods will may be done, in earth as
it is in heaven: what does he seem to forbid?

A. In teaching us so to pray, he would not have us to seek our own wills,
or to stick to our own wisdom.

Q. Then it follows yt we pray against pride, covetousness, extortion, usury,
bribery, excess, dronkennes; whoredom, theft, lying and such like vices, for
these be the will of man, and contrary to the will of God.

A. We do so I confess.

Q. If we pray against those sinners, and to be endewed with righteousness,
and yet take a delight in them: what do we?

A. Even mock with God, and so do heap punishment upon our selves for it.

Q. Because I see this to be against me, should I not therefore pray?

A. If we should not pray, we were the despisers of his commandment. Mark. 14.
38.

Q. What are we here taught to ask? give us this day our daily bread.

A. All things necessary to this present life.

Q. Why does he teach us to pray daily for daily bread?

A. Because without his daily blessing our food could give small nourishment
unto us.

Q. What desire ye in this petition: Forgive us our trespasses.

A. Here I desire his mercy: for unless he be pitiful unto us, we are ready
to fall into utter destruction.

Q. What means the condition? As we forgive them that trespass against us.

A. Here we desire, that it may be his pleasure to give us grace that we may
be ready to pardon those that have offended us.

Q. Why do you say? Lead us not into temptation?

A. Here we pray that God will not suffer us to be overcome of temptation: but
that being for our profit or trial, we might boldly be strengthened in him to
abide that which his pleasure is to lay upon us.

Q. Why is this added? For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory for
ever.

A. This does teach us to confess that all rule and authority does come from
God, and rules all things according to his will.

A. Why say thou, Amen, in the latter end of the prayer?

A. By that word I desire the Lord God to grant all things which before I
prayed for.

Q. Tell me the effect in few words of all that thou have said upon the
Lords Prayer?

A. I desire Gods grace to do his will, and things necessary both to body
and soul.

A Prayer.
THe Lord give us grace to lay these things up deeply in our hearts, and
always to be mindful of them, as it behooves his true and faithful Children
in Christ Jesus. So be it.

FINIS.
