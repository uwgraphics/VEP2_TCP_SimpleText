A NEVVE BALLADE INTITVLED, AGAINST Rebellious and false Rumors. To the nevve
tune of the Black Almaine, upon Scissillia.
GEVE GOD THE GLORY NOW AND EVERMORE


WHat Rumores now are raised of late
Within this English land:
Which is not much for to be praised
The case so hard does stand,
For every one does talk,
There tongues contrary walk,
And semes to meddell, of this and that,
There babbling tongues, so large does chatte,
As foolish fancye, moves them say,
So out there foolish talk they braye.
And every one does besie him still,
About the thing he has no skill.
Some of his neighbors does inquire,
What news abroad there is:
If that he any thing does here,
Of those that did amiss.
Some longs to here tell, reversed
Of those that did Rebel,
And whether they be fled or take,
Thus still inquiry they do make,
Some says to Scotland they be go,
And other says it is not so,
The Rumerous Deuell is now abroad,
Which makes them so to lay on lode.
Some says this year there shall be hapte,
Much trouble in the land: reversed
Of Prophesies they carpe and clappe,
As they that have them skande.
Does tell them so abroad,
And thus they lay on lode:
And filles the peoples ears with lies,
Thus Rumor still abroad he flies.
Which makes them now in such a rore,
As all true hearts may well deplore.
And pray to God if that he please,
These foolish Rumores once may cease.
And let us now apply our time,
In prayer to the Lord: ()
That he may cease this furious crime,
That now is blown abroad.
And every one to stay,
His tongue and nothing say:
But of the things he has in hand,
And see his besynes well be scand?
And not to meddle of Princes acts,
What they will do nor of there factes,
If occupied, well we thus abide:
The Lord for us will well provide.
For surely Plagues we do desarue,
Most horrable and great:
Because from God we still do swerve.,
And daily does him frette.
And still provoke his Ieare,
Which glous as hot as fyare:
His Bow is now all redye bent,
Therefore in time let us repent,
Least he for sin do us deprive, reversed
For warned folks they say may live?
And warning take by other men,
Which we before our eyes have seen.
We have hard in France the Rumur there
That has been many a day:
There country spoiled in Ruth and fear,
Unto there clean decay.
With loss of many a man,
Since first that stir began:
And many a Noble has been slain,
A Duke, and eake a Prince certain.
Which wear the chief stays of that land,
Wherefore in hazard now they stand,
For where the chief are taken away,
The rest must needs run to decay.
In what estate does Soldiers stand,
Great ruth it is to here:
That there is wrought the Tirants hand
We need not to declare.
Experiaunce well may show,
What numbers here does flow.
Of Flemminges fled from Tirantes hand,
Which daily comes to this land:
Whose hearts in wrath full long has boyld
And eake there Country clean dispoyld.
Which thing may warn us well I say
Least that we feel the like decay.
The Lord has suffered us full long,
And spared has his rod:
What peace has been us now among,
A leven years praised be God.
And round about us has,
Been war and cruel faith,
And all to cause us to repent,
For we desarue worsse punnishment,
Then any of these Lands have done,
I fear we shall be plagud right sone,
Thy Judgment sure our God has had,
To plague the good still for the bad.
Wherefore let us with one accord,
Fall all to fast and pray:
And Pardon crave now of the Lord,
To keep us from decay.
And leave this murmoring spite,
Which God does not delight:
The Scripture plainly does declare,
The Isralites they plagued wear:
Because the murmered at there God,
Therein we do desarue like rod.
With hearts devout now let us pray,
To keep this Realm from all decay.
Finis.
