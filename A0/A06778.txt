THis night past, arrived here four galleys of the religion and order, two

Michaels fortress, that carts and chariottes may pass in at the breaches,
and that it is great marvel that ever our men could keep them. Moreover, they
reported how that Don garcia de Toledo, did imbarke 4000. soldiers of the
bands of Sicilia, Naples, and Corsica, and departed from Malta with 58. galeis
after the Turkysh army: God send him good success.
