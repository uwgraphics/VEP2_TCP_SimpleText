THE FAMOVS History of GEORGE Lord FAVKONBRIDGE, Bastard son to RICHARD
CORDELION King of England.
CHAP. I. How Richard Cordelion King of England, going to the holy Land, slew
Phillip the Prince of Austria, and how Don John doomed him to a most strange
punishment, and of his woeful lamentation in prison.
WHen the true spirits of illustrious atchieuements, possessed the Nobility of
Europe, and that the Babes of honor, fed upon the milk of Knightly
adventures, here reigned in England, a royal minded King, named Richard
Cordelion, a Prince replenished with the commendable reports of renown, in
whose government, both Arms and Art flourished, wars wrought peace, and
peace brought happiness. In this Kings time, the blessed state of Gods holy
City of Jerusalem, groaned under the heavy yoke of Paganism, and the despised
Infidels with pride and tyranny suppressed all her royalties, for recovery
whereof, all Christendom took Arms, and the rumors of war wrathfully
thundered in all our Northern Nations.

Five Christian Kings, (under the bloody standers of Godfrey of Bullin,) (that
imperious Monarks, and worthy of the World) marched. Amongst which glorious
number, one matchles King, Richard Plantaginet, was too aduenturous forward,
for he in the blooming bud of his youth, with the chiefest Chiualry of England,
clothed in steel, fired with fame and full of resolution, left the government
of his kingdom to his brother John, then Duke of Ireland, and arrived in
Austria, the meeting place of these Christian Potentates.

The rest of this Camp royal, not then in a readiness, according to the
customs of Princes, caused King Richard to request entertainment for him and
his Knights. Don John then Duke of Austria, being a Prince so courteous and
noble, that he could do no less then grant it. Now Fame and Fortune in King
Richards thoughts smiled, and the smooth brow of wished good speed, bad him and
his hundred Knights welcome.

A hundred he had as then for his guard, called Knights of the Bath, a title of
dignity first given by this King: but now while the rest of his Army planted
their standers upon the downs adioining to the Court, these Knightly Gallants
so reuelled in the Dukes Palace, that well were they that could purchase their
favors, and highly graced were all such as had but the smallest employment of
an English Knight.

So amiable, pleasing, and courteous, were the conditions of King Richard and
his followers, so truly were their minds devoted to honor, that they even
enforced love from all estates, the haughty minded of their own accords became
gentle, the stubborn nature pliable, and the frown of every English brow by
desert challenged both cap and knee, Don John himself began to grow
disgracious, his Subjects wavering, alegiance waxed cold, and none but the name
of English Richard merited Fortunes high graces: All Austria esteemed England a
happy Nation, by nature the darling of virtue, and the only hopes of
Christendom, so grealy are still the favors of our English people in the eyes
of foreign kingdoms.

This detracted love of his subjects did not a little displease Don John, and
his son Prince Phillip, and no little envy by it were bred in their two fired
breasts, that nothing could quench the increasing flame thereof, but King
Richards shame and confusion. Politic and close were their purposes, deadly
and devilish their intents, and most unhuman and unchristian like their
proceedings, the law of Arms was quite laid aside, the honor of Princes
forgotten, and the dignity of Knight hood vilely abused, malice, and wrath, the
champions of pale death hourly possessed their two hearts, with a secret
imagination of vengeance, plotted against the life of royal Richard, to
murder by violence, would but incur displeasures of foreign Nations, to kill
innocents offends Heaven, and to betray Princes, has rewards in hell, a
thousand thousands of displeasing motions, disquieted their discontented
minds, dishonored as they thought by the virtues of King Richard, disgrace
boiling in her greatest heart, could no longer be suppressed, but needs the
flames of fury must break forth, and a flattering practice of reuengement
mollify their intolerable torments, and in this manner was it accomplished.

Prince Phillip the only son and heir apparent to Don John, the pride and
hopes of Austria, in whose life and good Fortune consists his countries
honor, like a desperate and prodigal gallant, in a dissembling shape of
friendship, challenged King Richard at a Princely turnament, and in the
knightly games of tilting, personally to combat hand to hand, the English King
in the April of his manhood, nothing inferior in prowess to Prince Phillip,
having the sparks of Majesty glowing in his bosom, in a most princely manner
accepted his challenge, and against the day appointed, provided al things
fitting for so noble an enterprise.

Time with his lazy wings, seemed to fly too slowly, and to cross the forward
attempts of these youthful combitants, each minute seemed an hour, each hour
a day, and each day a month, till the appointed time came of this royal
turnament, so bold, forward, and illustrious were these martialists, the one
striving for honor, the other for revenge.

I need not here speak of the sumptuous preparations, the exceeding charge,
and costly habilliments provided against that day, numberless were the
eyewitnesses of this Court-like pastime, ready prepared to bid them welcome
with a gracious applause. To come to the fullness of this glory, the day
approached, the morning Sun cheerfully rose with a bright smile, the
crystal Sky put on her fairest robe, and the moderate air seemed to further
their proceedings, all things by nature were as furtherers to summon them to
Arms, Don John himself attended by his greatest Nobility, sat as Vmpiers in
the case, and each Lady with a prepared eye, was ready to censure of their
deserts, the tilting place being rayled in quadrangle-wise, round about beset
with lofty galleries, whereon people in degrees were placed in such multitudes,
as memory it self could hardly number: the Sun beams had not more motes by
imagination, then this theater spectators, equally wishing good fortune to them
both, bright honors scene being ready to begin, the Drums and Trumpets gave
warning of the two combitants approach, in such a melodious manner, as both air
and earth resounded, the first that entered the listes, was Prince Phillip in a
black caparison, his horse betrapt with sable, his beuer close, made of the
fashion of a flying Griffon, his Lance and Scutchion borne before him by a
naked Indian, all agreeable to his black desires: for the steeled point of his
Lance, and the keen edge of his sword, were both impoisoned; his motto was,
True honor has no equal.

Immediately after entered Richard of England, mounted upon a Spanish Gennet,
as milk white and spotles as were his thoughts, his Armor bright and
glistering, his Helmet of the fashion of a sun sparkeling fire, expressing
both malice and mercy. Upon his breast he had the honorable red cross of
England, platted with Arabian silk, his Motto was; Honor tainted, in vain
repented.

Thus all things in readiness for this royal turnament, the cheerful reports
of relentlesse Drums and Trumpets, thundered a charge, whereupon the two
courageous Princes, fired with resolution, so fiercely assailed each other,
that a strange admiration of their man-hoods possessed all the beholders. The
old Duke Don John himself, sitting with a longing desire of his sons
victory, was immediately discontented which the spite of Fortune, for after he
had wounded the English Prince with his impoisoned weapons, to the great danger
of life, courageous Richard expressing his Lion-like nature, closed Prince
Phillip with such a manly power, that with his heavy courtelax, at one blow he
broke his neck: Folly it were to resist destiny, for even at that instant he
yielded up the ghost, and in the sight of his old father embraced death.

This sudden accident advanced not so much the honors of King Richard, as it
settled fury in Don John's heart, for having lost the hopes of his Kingdom, his
only son and glory of his age, like a man desperate of all good fortune,
joy, and consolation, he raged both against heaven and earth, blaspheming his
Creator, swearing both by God and the world, that the treasures of Europe
should not redeem King Richards life, nor the unknown treasures of the deep
Ocean (were they laid at his feet) preserve him from a dishonorable death: for
(quoth he) in loosing my Son, the sight of the World displeases me, I will
pine in grief, I will famish with woe, I will live foodlesse, feeding upon
nothing, but desires of vengeance. Assist me thou spirit of destruction, that
in wrath I may confound the murderer of my son, in whose life I more
delighted, then in my royal crown: for in wanting him, I live as a forlorn,
woeful, and deposed King, exild and banished from this worlds royalty: my second
soul adores the smallest drop of thy dear hearts blood, shall be quittanced
with the purple goa^e of King Richards bosom. Having spoken these, or such
like words, he commanded the Marshall of Austria, to take the English Prince
unto his charge, and to keep him close prisoner in a square Tower of Marble
stone, adioining to the uttermost part of his Court, and likewise to discharge
all the followers of his Country, upon pain of death not any one of them to
be seen in his territories after the date of seven days. All which according
to the angry Dukes command, was by the Marshall speedily accomplished, the
woeful King he to prison, and his sorrowful followers to their native
country, where his loyal Subjects made not a little moan for his hard
misfortunes; Don John with his Nobility mourned as grievously for Prince
Phillip, whom in most solemn manner they enterred in a Princely Tomb, where
we will leave him sleeping in peace, and persevere in this our woeful History.

King Richard having now neither Crown, Kingdom, nor liberty, but (by his
late received wounds, from Prince Phillips poisoned weapons,) lay bleeding in
prison, to his lives greatest danger, and being destitute of friends, and all
hopes of recovery, he dolefully breathed out this lamentation.

Oh unjust Fortune (said he) why in the prime of youth have thou thus deceived
me, and by thy flattering promises of advancement thus betrayed my Knightly
adventures? Those blessed wars, where the standard of Christ by their
encouraging flourishes, makes cowards inconquerable, must by me be forsaken,
and my unhappy days by Don John's unprincely doom, have ending, sweat with
tears.

Oh you ungrateful walls, that with your pitiless bounds claspes in a royal
Prince; merciless woe like a cruel tyrant feeds upon my heart, and the sun
shine of delightful consolation is now for ever dimmed with the black clouds
of despair, banished be all hopes of liberty, and the freedom that attends on
Kings, is curbed with the base penance of captivity: Far more fortunate is
the humble estate of the Plow-mans life, he suffers only the cross of private
disgraces, when principalities endure the general scandal of dishonor,
wherein Kingdoms, and the glory of Diadems, lose their illustrious dignities.
Where are now all my courtly trains of starre-bright Nobility, my attendant
followers, my gardiants, and humble seruitors, my pompous state, royal
banquetings, and delightful music, all so my souls eternal grief, now
vanished, and converted into continual lamentations: no fellowship have I to
comfort me, but discontent, sighs, and melancholy despair: Care is my food,
and tears my drink, nothing but the imaginations of woe, intercepts all hopes
of freedom.

Oh unhappy England, thou nurse and mother of my life, dishonored in thy Kings
disgraces, and made most miserable by this injurious and most unprincely
dealings, Heaven I hope with black vengeance, deadlier then the fear of hell,
will in time spy out a most dreadful quittance, written in the bloody brow of
a cursed Austria, stained with inhumane murder of a King, whose death the
child as yet unborn shall rue, and after ages shall speak off: pity my
distresses thou revenger of mankind, that my soul may sleep in peace, and
rest in that blessed mansion prepared for Monarchs.

These or such like heartbreaking complaints being breathed from his grieved
bosom, the pain of his impoisoned wounds so enraged, and so furiously
tormented his body yet bleeding that (poor King,) he fell into a swound,
liuelesse, and breathles, saving a little panting breath moved in his breast, a
sign that the sparks of life were not quite extinguished. But now, ever as
this sudden trance assailed King Richard, there entered into the prison the
Lord Marshall, under whose charge he was then kept, where when to his great
amasement he beheld as he supposed, the King bereft of life, having a mind
framed of a noble disposition, began to pity his misfortunes, and to accuse
his Lord and Master of injustice, whereupon according to his gentle nature, he
dressed his wounds with a precious kind of balm, by nature so excellent, that
it not only recovered life, but also health, and in less then in three days,
made him as sound as he was before his combat with Prince Phillip, where we
shall leave King Richard, making his prayers to heaven for his delivery from
death, and speak of other accidents that followed hereafter.

CHAP. II. How the two English Earls of Arundell and Oxford, disguisedly
comforted King Richard in prison, of the love betwixt him, and Clarabella the
Dukes daughter; how he how he pulled out the Lions heart, and thereby came to
be called Richard Cordelion, and of other accidents.
ACcording to the heavy and bitter command of the angry Duke, (in revenge of
his sons death,) the Nobility and Knights of England departed Don John's
Kingdom, leaving the woeful King in prison, as ashamed of so hapless a
voyage, where being no sooner come, and the reports thereof bruted in the ears
of the Earls of Arundell and Oxford, but like two English spirited gallants,
not able to brook this foreign disgrace, they resolutely departed England,
protesting either to bring their Sovereign Lord safely to his Kingdom, or to
leave their bodies buried in Austria: that blood (quoth they) spent in the
honor of our King and Country, is the sweet sacrifice of Knighthood, and the
true vermillion color, that beautifies the rich robes of honor.

Thus nobly minded, they with all speed crossed the Seas, which they were
joyful off; so with so glorious a burden, and the whisling wind, proud of
these Princely resolved Gentlemen, loving kind, and loyal, set open their
gentle portals, and beyond the expectation of man, set them safely upon the
costs of Austria, where being no sooner come, but they attired themselves in
the disguised habits of Friars, the most secret, and fittest policy to attain
the wished presence of their imprisoned King, and by that means thought they
to relieve him, if his extremity so much required; so coming to the prison
gate in a professed zeal, as they said they had of King Richards souls
health: they desired access, and that the Lord Marshall would admit them to
the Kings presence, who being a man of a courteous nature, could do no less
then grant their request, being so honest and virtuous a demand.

Frowning Fortune began now a little to smile, and a little to ease his
languishing sorrows: for no sooner had his gentle eyes cast their dim sights
(almost blinded with tears) upon his two dear friends, but a sudden rejoicing
hope assailed his heart, and like a royotous heir newly possessing his
patrimony, surfetted in pleasure, all dispairing passions by the delightful
presence of these two English Earls, were immediately converted into iollity,
their embraces were as the closes of new married Damsels, where the extremity
of joy so swelled in their bosoms, that even their eyes distilled tears, (and
their hearts as it were danced.) These two supposed Friars had no other
Orisons, but comfortable reports from his loyal Subjects in England: their
Books were their loves, and their Beads their fealties.

Thus in this secret manner unsuspected of any, repaired they daily to this
distressed King, expecting hourly his lives metamorphoses, either of liberty
or death: Freedom, or confusion, royalty, or captivity: in which wavering
doubt, while these three subjects of sorrow remained, the displeased Duke
(still harboring in his heart black malice, called a counsel of flattering
sicophants, such as be still the attendants of Monarkes, where against both the
law of Arms and Nations, it was decreed that King Richard should combat with
a Lion, which if he overcame, his liberty thereby might be purchased; but being
overcome, he should endure the sharp punishment of this merciless beast,
whose greatest favor were but death: upon which pitiless doom, this bloody
counse^l concluded, and thereupon appointed the time and hour, to the extreme
grief of many thousadns, whose whose gentle hearts even trembled at this
remorslesse judgment. But now mark the difference in nature of a cruel
Father, and a kind Child; the Father merciless, the Child mild, the Father
proud, the Child humble, the Father unreasonable, the Child reasonable, the
Father cruel, the Child loving, betwixt whom tyranny and remorse strous for
superiority: for Don John bore not more extreme hate against the English King,
then his daughter fair Clarabella extended love: In her heart partial Cupid
builded his Bower, and pity with his smooth countenance, sent dumb messengers
to the distressed King, which were modest sighs, bashfully sent from her
maiden-like breast, fearing to offend in affecting her Fathers enemy: yet love,
which has commanded even the Gods themselves, and still blindly leads earthly
Monarkes with unequal affections, making no difference betwixt Kings and
Beggars, so ruled the desires of divine Clarabell, that she wished no other
consolation in this world, but the sacred love of English Richard; whose
presence (if she might possess) were to her soul as the pleasures of
Paradise: duty and obedience (by nature her Fathers right) were now exchanged
into desire and love; the Princely behavior of King Richard guided her
thoughts, and (though as yet unknown to him) entangled her loue-sicke heart in
the toiles of Venus, wherein was no hope of recovery, but the uniting of them
both in the equality of desire. These were fair Clarabels discontents, which
as an incurable wound, dismembered all the lively wishes of virginity, offending
only in thought, and with the chilling fear of her second solues destruction,
by the terrible censure of her angry Father, she grew like mad Medea,
lunaticke and distraught, expecting the savage murder of royal Richard, she
railed both at Heaven and Earth, conspiring thus against all her good Fortunes:
For in loosing him (quoth she) the bloome of my maidenhead withers, and I
am like to pine in the languishing estate of misery: made only miserable by
the Eagle like pitch of my lofty desires. In this manner spent she away the
day, till the sable Canopy of Heaven covered all the earth, a time of silence,
a time of peace and rest, a time that the eyes of all things closes up: yet
sleep (the comforter of distressed minds, could not lock up her eyes, for
care had made them watchful, grief and distrust like two dreadful companions
waited in her chamber, every idle imagination buzzed in her cares, the
misaduenture of her love, fighting with all the misdoubts of desire, she
consumed away the slow night, where every minute seemed a day till morning
came, and then like a careful bride, she clothed her self in her richest
attire, and by the Suns rising came unto the prison, where she found royal
Richard upon his Princely knee, pleading for his souls salvation, preparing
himself ready for his Lion-like combat, the night before brought to the Lord
Marshall in a warrant from the Dukes counsel. Farewell vain world (quoth he)
thy flattering pomp has been to me, as water bubbles in a rainie day, or as
April showers, or the flourishes of Gardens, sudden and variable. Comfort me
God, only in thy power is my delivery, and without thy assistance, this day is
like to be my doomes day, and the last day of all my lives fortunes. At these
words fair Clarabel sunk into a swound, and so abounded in grief, that her
senses were hardly recovered, but being again come to her self, she fell at
King Richards knee, and in a most mild nature, spoke as follows.

Most imperious Potentate, in whose happiness consists my lives joy, and in
whose welfare my glory shines: In thee thou pride of manhood, have I built my
hopes, and in loving thee, do I purchase my fathers frown, the Diadem of
Austria. Now my right and patrimony do I utterly forsake, changing all my
native honors into foreign hopes, and for thy sake make my self a stranger
to my country; even in death springs my love, and being dead, all earthly
loves in me ends: Cast me not off in disgrace, but lock my true heart in thy
Princely bosom, there keep it as an inestimable Jewel, pure, unspotted, and
unstained, and tender as the budding Rose, blasted with the least wind of thy
dislike: As for thy lives danger (sweet Prince) fear not, heaven I see with a
smiling countenance, promises comfort, and legions of Celestial Angels stand
ready armed to defend thee from that hunger-starued Lion, prepared for thy
lives destruction, a death dishonorable, and unfit for so royal a person.

In speaking these words, she took a green scarf from about her iuory
neck, and gave it to King Richard, saying; Take this (sweet Prince) as the
maiden-like promise of my love and remembrance, wear it for my sake, it may
prove thy lives preserver, and the only instrument to glut up the Lions greedy
Iaw, even at that deadly minute, when he seaseth upon thy noble body. Pardon my
immodest presumption, for desire and love imboldens me, and all my maiden like
bashfulnesse is abolished, by the delightful presence of thy sweet self: For
thee, and for thy love, have I sold all my royal promotions; Then equal it
(great King) that my affection be not blasted in the bloome, and I made the
most woeful and despised Lady alive.

More would she have spoken, but that the gentle King took her from the
ground, (yet kneeling) and with the delightful joy of a courteous kiss, sealed
their lips together, and after gratified her kindness with this loving
discourse.

Thou fair of all faires, thou paragon of beauty, in whose countenance (I see)
sits inthronised both virtue and modesty, what undeserved favor has true
judging Heaven graced me with, in that thy inspiring love has eluminated my
cloudy Fortunes, now scowling with a dismal countenance? Were the whole world
mine, and I commander of Monarchies, yet should all my dignities enrich thee,
and my powerful regalties advance thee to the imperial estate of all earthly
graces: This thy kindness has enchanted me, ravished my senses, elevated my
soul, and of an earthly substance, made my desires immortal. Now fly I with
the wings of good chance, which nothing can clip, but the sharp sickle of
despitefull death: For death (I know) with his gasily visage, walks here
inuisibly, with his tirannous command, ready to seize upon me: now is the hour
of my lives adventure, and the minute of that fearful judgment to be put in
practice, to the appeasing of Prince Phillips angry ghost.

At this word speaking, came in the Lord Marshall with an armed guard, having a
commission to conduct King Richard, to a square Court walled round: wherein was
a Shee-Lionesse newly bereaved of her Whelps, to make her the more mankind:
about which Court sat the Duke and his Barrons in a gallery, to behold this
unnatural tradegy: unto which place being come, attended on a far off, by
the Princess Clarabell, who with tears and sighs did not a little solicet
heaven for his strengthner: all which forced pity from the hearts of his
enemies, and might have mollified even Tigers to relent.

The two English Earls of Arundell and Oxford, his approved friends in misery:
High spirited, and full of resolution, attended as before in their Friars
habits, feeding him (as the beholders supposed) with the food of divine
counsels: but indeed with the animation of courage imbouldening him to take his
fortunes patiently, and to think of the honor of his Country, by whose death
England was widdowed, and his subjects made Kinglesse.

These motions of encouragement, bred in his manly heart an inconquerable
strength, committing his life to the disposing of fate: He stripped himself
from all Court-like habiliments, and in his cambricke shirt, with fair
Clarabels scarf wrapped about his arm, he stood prepared for the
entertainment of the remorslesse Lion, which at the sound of a Trumpet was let
loose, whose roares were as thunder from the clouds, and in whose grim visage
sat the fearful president of destruction; heartbreaking afflictions possessed
all his well willers, and the quiuering fear of his confusion assailed every
gentle eye, excepting Don John and his associats. To be short, the Lion like
the galfe of burning Acharon* gaped to receive the royal body of King Richard,
who neither fearing death, nor the threatenings of tyranny, with an unknown
courage, he most valiantly thrust his arm (wrapped about with fair Clarabels
silk scarf) into the gaping jaws of the ouer-furious Lioness, and by the
force of his manhood to are out his savage heart, (yet leaping warm in his
hand) and threw it at Don John's face, saying; Take that thou monster of
humanity, thou unprincely Potentate, heaven thou see has defended me, to the
wonder of ages, and thy vile disgraces. General was the applause, the
intolerable vexation of the wrathful Duke, who like an untamed Panthar, rose
from his seat, and in great wrath departed. King Richard seeing the Lioness
heartlesse and liuelesse, lying on the ground, to the great amasement of all
the beholders, yielded the glory of this victory to the all-seeing praises of
Heaven. No little joy had the two English Earls at this lucky successe^, but
espe^ially the heart of divine Clarabell danced in delights.

Never had Lady the like cause of content, nor never Lady more bound to thank
the Almighty powers of heaven. The relieved King, as the ignorant Lamb newly
escaped from the bloody fury of the Wolie, with a countenance of a crimson
blush, declared the like gladness, and in most kind manner cast the
reflecting beams of his eyes toward Clarabell, that she well perceived his
courteous thoughts, and that grateful thanks harbored in his Princely heart
After the Dukes departure, the whole company soon broke off, bearing a secret
favor to the English King, who by fair Clarabell, the Earls of Arundell and
Oxford, with some few other attendants of England, conducted him to a private
chamber, where after some refreshing repast, they prepared for England, but not
meaning discourteously to leave fair Clarabell behind, caused her to be
attired in the habit of a Court Page, in a suit of watched colored velvet, to
signify the trunesse of her love, (for his sake) in refusing both Country,
Parents, and Kindred, and in this sort to become estranged from al her
acquaintance. Such an imperious God is love, and so commanding.

The next day, unknown of any of the Dukes Court, but the Lord Marshall, who
assisted them in all their proceedings, they took leave of Austria, and
iournied toward England, where by the way King Richard and fair Clarabell, so
secretly closed in affections, that her blooming bud of virginity was cropped,
and the quittance of his loue-stroake sealed in her womb, a condition of such
content, as both pleasure and desires pleased each party. Clarabell in her
Pages attire, seemed in decentnesse to exceed Ganemede, Jove's minion, or wanton
Adonius the delights of Venus. Never had Paris the Troyan Prince, a greater
conquest in the love of fair Helena, then royal King Richard, of his admired
Clarabell. Nature in her greatest pride, framed this beautiful Lady, as then
the only miracle of woman kind, he muses in her praises may write eternally.
and those lasting reports which advanced so many Grecian dames, may now tell,
and forever speak off the super-abounding graces of this fair Lady, that like
unto that Angell-faced Rosamond, wrought wonders in all eyes.

No other comforts could possess the Kings fancy, but this celestial Lady,
Europes admiration, and the worlds glory. In this rau^shing content spent they
the time away, till happy Fortune se^ them safely upon the shores of England,
whose sweet sight was as ioyf^ll to them all, as the return of banished exiles
to their w^shed dwellings. This joyful day of their arrival in England, was
by the King and his Counsel canonized for a holy day, being the third of
March, and to thi^ time called Saint Richard (...) our English Almanacks can
yet testify. King Richard having again taken possession of his Kingdom, and
imperial dignity, first gracing his two dear friend of A^undell and Oxfor^,
^o^th commendable ad^^ancement for their loves and loyaltie^, then preparing in
his City of London a royal lodging ^o^ his fair love, near unto Cheape-side,
called his Tower Royal, Men royal (as he said) in harboring so fair a
Paramour, as was divine Clarabell: In this place repaired he full often unto
her, and tasted of those delights in nature, spotting her name with the title
of a Kings Concubine. Long was he lulled in the cradle of pleasures, careless
of honors advancement, neglecting his countries fame: knightly Chiualry was
converted to courtly dances, the lullabies of idle pastimes rockt him asleep,
till the disgraces of England (received by his late imprisonment) awaked him,
and called to arms: Then rowsing up his Knightly courage, like Fames darling
(being set amongst his Barrons) he said as follows. Now Fire and Sword, the
two instruments of consuming war, shall forage Austria, and by the Kingdoms
ruin, work me a sweet revenge.

My wrongs there received by the unjust decrees of Don John, shall be
quittanced with more then common spoils, his Court shall swim in blood, his
turrets flame in fire, heaps of mangled men, choke up his streets, woe upon
woe, shall beset him round.

Troy in her ten years wars did not endure more calamities then Austria
shall shortly suffer. These and such like high spirited speeches, did King
Richard speak amongst his Lords, to the great encouragement of them all, and
so fired their lusty bloods, that well were they that could the most
gallantliest set forth themselves, and be the most forwardest in his noble
enterprise.

So desirous were all estates, and so willing in this noble war, that in
less then twenty days the King was the royal General of fifty thousand
Soldiers, all provided so manfully, as if they had gone to make a new conquest
of Jerusalem. In which honorable journey we will leave him, and also the
preparation that Don John made to withstand him, and his army, and speak of
the birth of Faukonbridge, borne and kept secretly in King Richards Tower
royal, with many other strange events that happened in the birth of this
Princely babe.

CHAP. III. Of the birth of Faukonbridge, and how he came to be so named: and
likewise how he was nursed by the Queen of Fairies. Fair Clarabels
lamentation for the loss of her young son, and of other accidents.
TIme the conclusion of all events, brought to the worlds eye, the springing
womb of Clarabell, and nearly ten Moons had now wandered out their wained
courses, when as therein King Richards royal fruit began to grow ripe and
ready to fall, against which joyful hour, the careful Lady spared for no
cost, and with her dear relenting heart solicited heaven for a happy
delivery, the only desire of all weomen. I will not speak of the tender
natured Nurses, the diligent Midwiues, nor the rich furniture provided against
that time: needless it were to report the sumptuousness of banqueting dishes,
nor the variety of services belonging to so noble a business, most honorable
and gracious were all the proceedings of this her Christian-like childbirth,
not any displeasing object hindered her content, nor any way disquieted her
mind, but only the want of her beloved, whose presence in her eye had been
more delightsome then the pleasures of Elizeum: Little supposed she that King
Richard had taken arms against her Father, the success whereof would have but
bred a strise betwixt love and nature: For nature in reason took her Fathers
part, when as love leaned to her Lord, yet shrouded were all imaginations in
the closet of secretnesse, and she least report thereof sounded in her ears.
Unknown were all these proceedings: For King Richard at his departure gave
commandment not to reveal them, till heaven had brought light to the fruit of
her body. To be short, the minute approached of the Babes coming into the
World, a sweet tender blossom, a most joyful wish for the pained Mother, who
being borne, was to the beholders an excellent piece of natures worke-manship,
upon whose Infant brow sat the promises of good Fortune.

After the Midwife (according to her manner) had trimmed up the sweet Babe, and
showed him naked (to the other weomen her associats) being a man child, upon
his breast it had the picture of a golden Faulkon, soaring over a most
dangerous bridge, the which being showed as a wonder in nature, the honorable
Ladies in the Kings Court, by whose means it was generally reported through
the Land, and after called in Christendom, by the name of George Lord
Faukonbridge: A title fitting for so noble an Impe of virtue, being descended
from so royal a stock (as was King Richard and fair Clarabell.) But to come
to our purpose, before one month had run out thirty days, to the more then
common grief hf the mother, the tender Infant lying in his cradle, attended on
by three careful nurses, even at the middle hour of the night, when the
silver Moon in her greatest glory danced on the crystal Seas, even at that
silent hour when the God of Dreams governed the World, there was heard in the
chamber such a melodious sound of Music, as if it had been the harmony of
Angels, or the singing Cherubins of Heaven, which in a bewitching manner so
enchanted the wakefull Nurses, that their eyes closed, and their senses yielded
to sound sleeps.

In this still time of silence, came in the Queen of Fairies, with a troop of
her invisible attendants, being the pretty dancing Elues of an unknown
Kingdom, and stoale away young Faukonbridge out of his Princely cradle: whose
miss (at his Nurses waking) bred such an amasement amongst them, as almost
procured lunasie, and forced them (like Bacchus froes) to run madding up and
down, not knowing in what manner to answer this their negligence: But yet
this grief of thiers, was but the induction to the true maze of calamity: the
woeful mother (unhappy Clarabell) made hapless, miserable, and most woeful, by
the loss of this her sweet Babe: this dear collop of her own flesh, being so
dearly fed with her own blood, forty weeks cherisht in the Closet of her
womb, and even now (contrary to all expectation) by the loss of it, to be
bereaved of all worldly consolation. Oh thou unjust guider of man's life (quoth
she) what secret sins have I committed against thy commanding deity? what
blake offense has now dimmed the clear beams of mercy, that her eluminating
glory is thus withheld from me? Why had it not been strangled in my womb,
and made Deaths sacrifice before it had saluted the Worlds eye? then for the
want thereof had I not thus mourned, nor the title of a mother thus unhappily
wrought my hearts discontent. Weep eternally (oh mine eyes) till you grow
blind with lamentations; break heart with swelling sobbes, split and burst
asunder: Nothing but motions of cross chances intercepts my imaginations,
consuming sorrow (like a wasting tyrant) revels in my distresses: Not any
comfortable thought will in mercy seize upon my soul, pity is fled, remorse
banished, and gentle relenting passions, works wonders in my griefe-tired
heart.

Now this sudden loss of her young son, gave her an occasion to desire the
presence of King Richard, that in his company she might a little ease her
sobbing bosom, and that an equal partition of grief might be made betwixt
them, considering half of mischances spite belonged to him, being the Father,
and begetter of this blooming Faukonbridge: But when she had intelligence of
his departure for Austria, and of his revenge pretended against her Fathers
Country, and her native soil, and birthplace, a sorrow beyond humane
imagination assailed her heart, and a grief (beyond the misery of Hecuba
Queen of Troy, having lost one and twenty sons) seized upon her soul: words
were not sufficient, tears of no force, sighs sobbing in blood, could not
reveal the least part of her bitter anguish: All the tongues that ever spoke,
all the pens that ever writ, nor all the books that ever was, could more tell,
write, or contain, the true manner of the disquietnes of this sorrowful Lady,
the true pattern of grief sat heavily upon her cloudy brow, and her eyes
sparkeled as it were streams of afflictions, day and night spent she
comfortless away, food was as poison to her body, sleep as strange company,
loathsome: solitary silence wrought her the best case: nothing but idle visions
of discontent appeared before her: sometime she supposed that grim-fast death
with legions of worms sat devouring the tender body of her young bade: Sometime
again, she imagined that an army of Angels conducted the pretty Impe into the
blessed kingdom of heaven: by and by again, that wild beasts and rauing
Fowls, banquetted with his tender limbs: one while she thought it lay
staruing in the fields frozen to death with cold, another while parched with
the beams of the hot Sun: A thousand doubts had she of the misaduenture of
this young babe, believing never to see it more, but that the doomes day of his
lives ending had concluded all his Fortunes. Upon which resolution, she
exempled her self from the company of all people, excepting one ancient
Gentlewoman, that daily attended in her Chamber, which brought her such
necessaries as sufficed nature, where like the picture of woe, vnbrast, and
disrobde of all Lady-like attires, with disheuelled hair hanging down to the
earth, we will leave her in this her Tower-royall, so called by the reason of
her royal beauty, to the bitterness of lamentations, fitting so sorrowful a
Princess, and speak of the fearful Fortunes, that the three nurses had.
After young Faukonbridge was in the possession of the fair Queen, the eldest
of these unhappy nurses, was a widdowed Lady of the Court, of a clear
complexion, fair and beautiful, whose face declared the lamentable show of
discontent. Poor sorrowful soul, after the young Infant was thus taken away,
not knowing by what means, nor by whom, considering this her negligent care
proved a scandal to her reputation, she exempted her self wilfully from the
society of people, and gave her self to travel, protesting by the sacred
Majesty of Heaven, to leave no kingdom unsearched, nor no nation unseen into,
till she had found out young Faukonbridge, and brought him again safely unto
his careful mother. The second of these woeful nurses, being a rich London
Merchants wife, in like manner (in penance for this her negligence) put her
self unto a heavy task, which was, to refuse all the joys of marriage, not
to take the fruition of her husbands love, not to sleep upon downy beds, but
to rest her self upon the hard ground, making the dusty earth her pillow,
where sighs and sobbes were her only companions, care her chamberlain, and
grief her guardian, not any motion of delight could any more seize upon her
heart, but all her meditations were still made upon the wished return of
young Faukonbridge. The third and last, but not the least woeful of these
grieved nurses, was a plain, wholesome natured countrey-woman, of a complexion
like unto the Shepherds of Idea Mountains, never more fairer were the
tripping Nymphs of Diana, sporting upon Cipresse banks, nor never did nature
frame woman more beautiful: upon her ^heekes the lilly and the rose strove for
supremacy, and the Vermillion blush of her beauty wrought desire in all eyes,
even love himself danced in her countenance, yet all these rich gifts of
nature, were quite blemished by the sudden fright taken at the loss of this
tender babe, whose absence was as the bitter doom of death, and transformed
all her wonted graces into pale fear, her face by it was changed into the
shape of an ashy visage, or the wan countenance of a long dead body, all
earthly consolation ended, no hope had she of her former joy; despair, black
melancholy, deadly hours, and unlucky thoughts harbored in her pensive
bosom, and by the loss of that sweet Infant, (at whose birt heaven the Muses
danced,) all following good Fortune (was quite from this Nurse exiled:) and as
a punishment therefore, for her negligence, she promised by a solemn vow made
secretly with her own heart, never to taste other food, but roots, herbs,
and such things as grew in the desert woods, nor never to drink other liquour
but clear water, taken from running rivers, her companions were siluaine
beasts, and fowls of the air, which in their natures seemed to assist her in
this her languishing life: long lived she, with the rest of her woeful
partners, making their daily orazons for the sweet return of this royal babe,
for whom the whole land in great sorrow mourned, whom we will leave till
another time, and persevere in these following events that happened to King
Richard, being wading in Austria through Seas of blood.

CHAP. IIII. A woeful report of King Richards death. Of fair Clarabels
lamentation for the same. Of her grievous punishment by famine, and of other
accidents.
AFter some little ease, like the sweet return of some long absent friend, had
mittigated the inward sorrows of fair Clarabell, and that a little the
remembrance of her Infants loss, somewhat ceased her former laments, thinking
to cheer her sad heart with infusing delights, that she hoped to enjoy by the
sweet presence of King Richard, wishing hourly his company, little dreaming of
his departure for Austria, but that he revealed in his own Court, to her great
joy, and his own renown, that at his first arrival into her presence, they
might like Mars and Venus surfeit in delight, or like Paris with his Helena,
seal up the true quittances of desire, but all was not as she wished; for her
hearts beloved, King Richard, flourished in the royalties of Belonaes battles,
wading in blood, and mounted upon his undaunted courser, treading upon mangled
men, and marching after the cheerful melody of war.

Which when the poor distressed Lady hard off, like a condemned exile,
banished from all solace, she exclaimed against cruel desteny, reuiling the
angry Queen of chance, accounting all her hopes ominous, and her self the
only pattern of misfortunes.

Oh (quoth she) what unlucky planet predominated my birth? why was I borne to
these miseries? I live destitute of friends in an unknown kingdom,
dishonored with the title of a Curtizan, a pointing mark for virtuous Ladies,
a stain of woman-hood. Oh why was I borne to commit so foul a sin, that
blemisheth the glory of all Princes? Oh unkind King Richard, now I see thou
heapest upon my back a second misery, as thou have disrobed me of virginity,
making me neither wife, widow, nor maid: so will thou orphane me, and entitle
me by the name of a parentlesse child: Woe upon woe I see pursues me, calamity,
discontent, sorrow, despair, yea, and all the miseries that ever hapless
woman endured, now like whirle-winds, or tempestuous gusts, tumbles my care
killed heart into the gulf of unpitied afflictions; be just thou punisher of
black trespasses, for my skarlet sins knock at Heaven gates for revenge,
and my desert exceeds Tarpies that sold Rome, or the daughter of Ninus that
betrayed her fathers kingdom: for even as the Viper I feed upon my Parents
woe, and as the curse of nature, have gloried in disobedience, what good
fortune can I challenge at the hand of destiny, in loving my fathers foe?
yielding that vnrecouered iem to his pleasure, as being well bestowed, might
have merited the worlds fame; but being lost to satisfy his lust, has placed
me (for a strumpet) in the black book of infamy? who can pity my
extremities, or what gentle eye will vouchsafe thereat to shed one tear?
Tears from a remorslesse bosom are most comfortable dewes, and the sweet
waters of hearts ease. These, or such like passions breathed she from her
discontented bosom, which manner of lamentations once a day she made to the
sightlesse air, till the time of six months ouerpassed, at the end whereof,
there arrived at her lodging, the two Earls of Arundell and Oxford, newly
returned from Austria, being the only counselors to King Richard in all his
proceedings, which two Lords brought the heauiest news that ever nearly
touched England, such news that might even have broke a savage heart, news of
death and dolor, the signification thereof sat like characters in their
foreheads, and as it were made dumb shows of discontent, being with heavy
countenances both come into the presence of Lady Clarabell, the good Earl of
Arundell said as follows. Prepare (sweet Lady) with a gentle silence, to
entertain the wofullest tale that ever man at arms reported, for it tells of
blood and death, and of the ruin of imperious soueraignety. Know fair
Clarabell that in one day by the fury of relentlesse war, thou have lost both
thy Father and thy Love: First thy Father when the battles joined, closed with
high spirited Richard in such Princely resolution, as even fired his whole army
with the lively sparks of valor, and so proudly managed himself against the
gunshot of chance, as if Hector and Achilles combated each other. On the other
side English Richard, under whose ensigns our selves marched so nobly, and so
beyond expectation he behaved himself, as if Mars fought upon the earth, both
Heaven and Earth thundered forth their glories: Our two Armies were in number
like the Camp of Scythian Tamberlaine, which (as it were) made the huge earth
to groan.

Never since the ten years wars at Troy, did man's eye behold so numberless
a multitude, all valiant, fearelesse, and aduenturous; we for the honor of
England, they for the honor of Austria: Seas of blood covered the green
fields, and the feet of horses trampled out dead men's brains, the cries of
dying soldiers seemed like thunder, and the christ al Air spread forth her
sable Canopy, mourning at so woeful a massacre. After thousands lay breathless
on the hungry earth, glutted with the blood of so many thousand Christians,
the victory grew so doubtful, that Lady Fortune sat wavering, not resolved to
what side to yield it: But woe is me, even then the glory of both our Armies
faded, and the eluminating light of two Princes was by consuming death
extinguished: Austria lost royal Don John, your Father, and we imperious
Richard our King. Two such losses, as Europe for them weeps blood, and may
well consume in grief: Upon whose deaths, both our Armies sounded retreat, a
peace proclaimed, and both their bodies had such funerals as befitted the
persons of such high dignities.

Our Leaders and Captains (having lost their Princely General, embraced
peace, and with the Swords sheathed, Colors rolled up, and with heavy hanging
countenances, are now arrived in England, where (with the general consent of
the whole Nobility) we have crowned John his brother, King of this Country,
whom in all allegiance we will henceforth honor and obey. More would they have
spoken, but the grief of Clarabella so abounded, that she could keep silence
no longer: but in great extremity of passion burst out into these speeches.

Here (quoth she) let the World end; for the terrible extremity of woe (like
the raging Ocean,) breaks in, and ouerflowes all my joys: I have lost my
Father, Friends, Country, Kindred, Acquaintance, yea, and my Child: and the
dearest of all Jewels, Royal King Richard, by whose death I am made most
unfortunate.

Descend some unlucky star, fall upon me you fatal planets, and strike me
blind, that my sightlesse eyes may behold no further miseries. Where art thou
mischance? afflict me with some fearful confusion; that like the wife of
Oedipus, the whole World may report my shame. Heavens blessings (I see) has
refused me, and like an outcast laden my blood-red heart with more then
earthly sorrow, and with which it is rent, torn, and most lamentably tormented.

At these words she offered to tear forth her own eyes, had not the gentle
advice of the two Earls persuaded her to patience, which she willingly
embraced, and so for that time parted company: She to her sorrowful closet,
they to the new refined Court, where (after K. John had intelligence of the
successes of Clarabella, sent to her a commission of banishment, with a
commandment that no English subject upon pain of death, should give her any
sustenance of food, whereby her wantonness might be scourged with pining
famishment: a grievous and severe penance, deserving the name of heathen
tyranny. But such was the indignation of King John, and so violent in wrath,
that even death quittanced her favorites. (Poor map of misery!) she was
forced to forsake Courtly fashions, and to exchange her costly attires into
beggars weeds: she that had wont to feed upon the variety of dainties, was now
sufficed with course services, no otherwise then with those things that
satisfied hunger-starued hounds: many a little dog (in the laps of young
wantons) had more abundance of food then this gallant Lady had. Day by day
walked she comfortless up and down the streets, moning her own
misfortunes, yet vnpittied, and left to her complaint. Night by night wearied
she out the long hours with remembrances of her former life, where every
minutes thought begot new grief, and every thought of new grief almost split
her heart: sighs were as common objects to satisfy her discontents, being
displeased with all things she cast her eye upon. Not any comfortable motion
could she entertain, wearied she grew of the wanton world, not knowing which
way to turn her self: Misery followed her up and down; when she remembered
Austria her Fathers Kingdom, disobedience cut her heart, when she called to
mind her Virginities wrack, a thousand woes (joined with repentance)
overwhelmed all ensuing hopes, and almost cast her into desperation, she
supposed pity to be deaf, and the tender remorse of humane gentleness to be
shut up against her. She that lately abounded in plentuousnesse, now lived in
want of a beggars pittance, she only fed upon sorrow: Sighs were her food,
and tears her drink, woe, misery, and penury, in most extreme manner,
tormented her pining carcass, till pouerties thin countenance converted her
rose-like cheeks into a pale complexion: her hollow eyes seemed like the empty
cells of death, sorrows badge (which is a wrinckled brow, declared to the world
pitiful prospects, to the wringing handed grief of the beholders, which were
not a few in number.) See into this globe of misery (you blazing stars of
Christendom) you flourishing Damsels, that sels your bodies pleasures to make
your souls black: You that live by the spoils of youth, making a pastime of
wantonness, gathering to your selves the hated names of common Curtizans,
corrupted with most vile diseases, loathsome and full of leprosy. To ouerpasse
many woes, poor Clarabell endured in this pining penance, we will leave her
lying upon the bare earth (by a spittle gate) only for an example to all such
careless livers, being too simple a lodging for a Princes daughter, and
return to the succeeding event of young Faukonbridge, and those three unhappy
Nurses, seeking for this Babe of honor.

CHAP. V. How young Faukonbridge was found by King John in his hunting. How he
preserved his Mothers life (unknown to him: And likewise how he succored the
three Nurses; and of the three gifts given him by the Queen of Fayries.
NOw must we suppose Time (in his swiftest course to run along) and some
certain years to pass over the head of Faukonbridge, where (taking leave of
the Fayry Queen,) he had three of the richest gifts given him by her, as never
worldly man was owner off. The first was a garment made him of the Lions
skin, that his Father Richard Cordelyon slew in Austria, of virtue so
precious, that the wearer thereof should never faint in courage, but ever
continus Victor in all atchieuements. The second a purse of gold, of such a
plentiful treasure, that can never grow empty, but as it is taken forth, the
virtue thereof replenisheth it again, by which means it continues full. The
third a ring of such inestimable price, that by the touch thereof heals all
diseases (never so dangerous and incurable.) These were the blessings of the
Fayry Queen bestowed upon this young gallant, which he received as his
patrimony, and kept them as the only gifts of good Fortune.

Thus being of the age of fifteen years, he continued in the woods (like unto
a savage satyr) unacquainted with worldly people, rouing up and down, until
such time as King John of England, (his uncle by the Fathers side) found him
in his wild quality: but seeing him replenished with such lineaments of nature,
strong, and sturdy, as promised ensuing honors: He took him to his keeping,
and gave him in charge to an ancient Noble man of his Court, to be trained up,
and taught perfectly his natural English tongue, which he most speedily
accomplished to his high renown: whereupon the King soon advanced his estate,
and made him groom of his privy chamber; but he having the lofty spirit of
Knighthood springing in his breast, aimed at nobler adventures, and to win
credit by the strength of his body, desired the Kings leave to depart his
Court, and to try foreign atchieuements in the honor of God and his
Country: which princely request did not a little content the King, whereupon
he gave him a horse well furnished with all the abilliments fitting so resolved
a Gentleman, and with all graced him with the picture by nature set upon his
breast. Thus after leave taken, like one of Fames darlings, this knightly
Faukonbridge in the springtime of his youth, committed himself to fortunes
fickle favors, where after he had traveled some few days iournies from the
English Court, he arrived at the gate of an Hospital, whereat lay Clarabell
his unknown mother, begging for relief, with these lines graven over her head
upon the wall in capital letters, according to King John's commandment.

A Princes daughter by the Kings decree,
Here pines in care, stand still, and pass not by,
Till this poor map of perfect misery,
With wringing hands heau'd up to heaven high,
Tells how her wanton life in sin was spent,
And why she thus makes woeful languishment.
Pity her not, her life is staind with shame,
By her a Kingdoms ruin was begot:
Lust and desire has blotted her good name,
And true repentance must make clear that spot.
To succor her is death, authority commands,
Against which power, lift no presumptuous hands.
Lord Faukonbridge having read this superscription, in pity rued her estate,
not knowing her to be his mother, for as yet his parents were unknown to him,
yet harboring in his breast noble thoughts, he could not choose but extend
charity unto her, and being the first of his adventures, and the maidenhead of
his mercy, the first good deed that ever he did, therefore he willingly
alighted from his palphrey, and in tender pity took the half starued Lady by
the hand, saying; If thou be descended royally, as these letters witness that
thou art, I am bound in all knightly courtesies to defend thee, and in maugre of
black Fortunes spite, succor thy distressed estate, as it seems now the
worlds outcast. Tell me fair Lady thy name, thy birth, and abode, and as I am
sworn true Knight, I will be thy champion, and conduct thee safely into thine
own country. These gentle promises made by Lord Faukonbridge, aspired new
life into her fading body, who with a cheerful countenance spoke as follows:

Dear Knight thy desert I know not, but surely thou seem to be gracious in
all thy proceedings, and desires not I know to enforce a Lady, to speak of
that which will break her heart to remember: Yet because thou promisest me thy
gentle aid, to deliver me from this miserable vale of woe, and set me wishedly
upon the shore of my native kingdom, vilely dishonored by my wilful follies:
Understand then I was borne in Austria, my name Clarabell, Princely my Father,
from whom I disobediently fled for the love of a Northern Monarke, unto whom I
yielded up the pleasures of my virginity, the loss whereof made me, (though no
wife) yet an unhappy mother: for which black sin I am now thus punished.
Question no further sweet Gentleman, for the rest will bereave me of life, but
according to thy noble disposition, be my guardian, and conduct me to my native
country, and the rewarder of all good deeds, will quittance your courtesies.
Indeed fair Lady (quoth he) as our oaths in Knighthood be so to do, so in
performance thereof I will adventure my life, though it be to the Kings high
displeasure. So taking her up behind him upon his horse, he carried her to the
next town, and there both cheered her pining body with comfortable victuals,
and after clothed her in such garments as befitted the degree of a
Gentlewoman, and so set forwards toward Austria, spending the slow time away
with pleasing discourses, little thinking of the near alliance that was
betwixt them two, the one the mother, the other the son: but heaven meaning
to show a wonder in their lives, would not as yet suffer their kindreds to be
brought to light.

So traveling on as I said before, they were intercepted by a most strange
object, which were three most distressed creatures, seeming by their attires to
be weomen, and the three nurses (in former times) of young Faukonbridge, which
Clarabell full well knew, but that she feared to be discovered. The good
Knight being still pitiful, beholding their miseries, the one dumb, the next
blind, and the third lame. Three woeful companions, whom age and time had thus
crossed with heavy calamity, he like a true godly minded man, with that ring
which the Fairy Queen had given him, cured all their maladies, the virtues of
it being so excellent, that it no sooner touched their dismembered bodies, but
immediately they were all made perfect, the lame could go, the blind see, and
the dumb speak: which miracle done by Lord Faukonbridge, according to the will
of heaven, enforced tears through extreme joy, to fall from the three
recovered Nurses eyes, desiring the maker of all things to reward his
courtesies. The good Knight, not only cured their griefs, but gave them great
store of gold out of his most plentiful purse, another gift from the Fairy
Queen by him received. Now these three new revived weomen being safe and
sound, no sooner departed, but fair Clarabell greatly desired to be Mistress
of two such precious Jewels as this Ring and the Purse was, whereupon in most
gentle manner she entreated Lord Faukonbridge to bestow them upon her, that
for his sake she might were them, a favor to her heart (as she said) more
inualuable then was the Jewel that Mark Anthony, gave Cleopatra Queen of
Egypt, gifts in his imagination, prised above the worlds Monarchy, yet being
loath to deny her request, he most willingly gave her them, and with his own
hand putting the Ring upon her pretty finger, and tying the rich purse by her
comely side, he said, Never let Knightly prowess advance my reputation, nor
record my lives fame in the book of memorable time, but let me die blotted
with cowardice, the foul stain of matchless Knighthood, when I refuse to
accomplish the least motion of your Lady-ships desire: for in your countenance
shines honorable graces, and promises dignified virtue. To whom Clarabell
with a modest behavior answered in this sort: And much were I too blame (Sir
knight) if I should not seek by desert to requite your kindness, and vile
ingratitude as a disgrace to my calling, might be well allotted to my share: If
time and good fortune ever advance me to my former estate, I will make thy
credit equal Grecian Achilles, and cause the worlds famous antiquaries to
signify thy martial condition: thou have bewitched me with thy virtues, and
with the chain of manly carriage bound my life to thy service: Reserving my
honor, I humble my self to thy nobleness, which honor only I once
submitted to a King, the fruit thereof might I but live to see, my earths
content were then grown to a perfection. Living, or dead, great Jove protect
him: this is my orizon to heaven, and upon this do I daily meditate. These
mystical speeches of hers, might have lighted the fire of discovery, but that
blind fate would not as yet have them known. These and such like, were the
pleasurable discourses betwixt these two travelers, with the which they spent
away many a long day and weary night, without any adventure worth the noting.
But as Fortune is not always smiling, here she began again to frown, and
to cross their desires with an unlooked for chance: For upon a hot summers day,
when the bright Sun in his greatest glory shined in the horizon, in a most
intolerable heat, the poor Lady wearied with travel, sat her down to rest
in a pleasant green shade of trees (where dallying with the Ring upon her lap)
she fell fast asleep, during which sweet slumber, there came a huge black
Raven soaring by, and thinking the yellow Ring to be some prey, which lay upon
her lap, with her tallents caught it up, and therewithal flew quite away, to
the great amasement of Lord Faukonbridge, standing by the sleeping Lady as her
gardiant, and being loath to loose so rare a Jewel, mounted upon his Steed, and
in most swift manner followed the Raven so far, that he quite lost the
presence of fair Clarabell, whom (for a while we will leave sleeping) and
speak what strange adventure happened to this noble Knight.

CHAP. VI. How Lord Faukonbridge was found by the Moors, and presented to the
King of Morocco. Of his adventures in that Kingdom. The lamentation of
Clarabell for her passed life: and how in penance thereof, she builded a
Monastery for the receipt of poor Pilgrims.
NOble minded Faukonbridge, followed the flight of this rich prised Raven,
carrying in his beak the worth of a Kings ransom, not resting nor pitching
upon any tree or branch, till she had let the Ring fall into the Sea, which
struck such terror to the heart of Faukonbridge, (then standing upon the
shore, seeing the event) that he almost cast himself after it into the waves,
but that better graces guided him, and hope of better Fortunes restrained his
desperateness. Standing thus amassed, and calling to mind the loss of
Clarabella (whom he had left comfortless behind) sleeping in a green shade of
trees, not knowing how, nor which way to return back, believing never more to
behold her Angelical countenance: Therefore like a mournful Traveler
(loosing himself in some desert wilderness) he breathed out this vnpittied
lamentation:

Many and unlucky are my first adventures (quoth he) attended on by cross
chances, and untoward proceedings; no motion of relief can I premeditate upon.
For I am come by ill Fortune into a place of desolation, not frequented by the
habitation of man: Here lives nothing but green bellied Serpents, roaring
Wolves, and beasts of fearful shapes, such as may well terrify the proudest
courage: Here sounds no other Echoes but the croakes of Ravens, night-Owles,
cries, and the bellowing of untamed Tigers, such as thunders forth nothing but
sounds of death and destruction: here is no other food to sustain nature, but
wild hemlocks, henbane, and such impoisoned weeds, the only storehouse of
black inchanters, witches, and charmers, the air seems to be corrupted, and
the earth casts up putrefying savors, worse then the smoking lake where
Sodom and Gomorra stood. In this manner complained he for the space of thrice
twelve hours, looking every hour to be devoured by wild beasts, but that his
Lyon-like garment which he wore, made them think him to be one of their
number, which savage creatures in tame manner lodged by his side.

As he thus between fear and hope, expected present death, he beheld a
Turkish galley houering by the shore side, the Captain whereof (being a noble
minded Gentleman) at the first sight of young Faukonbridge, cast a Land, where
(beholding his distresses) took him aboard, which ^nlookt for favor, not a
little reioiced him: but being so happily preserved from death, most willingly
submitted to their mercies, they being Moors, he a Christian: they
misbeleeuing, he true in faith, they black, he fair, two extreme
contrarieties: yet when these Heathen people beheld his face stored with such
majesty, resembling the beauty of his Creator: they admired his Angelike
countenance, never before that time seeing a man of his color, but all black
like themselves, therefore supposing to have found some heavenly Angel, they
presented him to their King, as then keeping his Court some four miles
distance from that place, on the other side of the Sea, (being but a creek of
the maine Ocean) in a most sumptuous Palace, for brightness like to the Tower
of the Sun.

The Morrocco King with his black countenance, advancing himself in his
royal throne, with great admiration received Lord Faukonbridge, not as a
Captive, or a chained Galley-slaue, but like the Darling of Majesty, or as the
Paragon of Fame, sent from Heaven to glorify his Court. Legions of reports
might we make of his entertainment with the Morocco King and his Nobles, who
esteemed him rather to be some God, then a worldly man, more dignified honors
heaped they upon his back, then ever that country gave unto a stranger. The
wealth of that Kingdom made they his treasury, and masses of Indian pearls
lay still at his commandment, the time of his abode there passed on apace, and
iollity of his life made seven years but as a month-

Which being ouerpassed, it was his chance upon a solemn festival day, which
was the birth day of their King, only once in seven years solemnized, to
behold the chiefest of the Kings Nobility in their richest ornaments, going as
it were on procession in the honor of their Prophet Mahomet. Placing him (as
it seemed in heaven) to the high dishonor of the Christians God, whose wrath
and indignation is the whole Worlds confusion, and whose favor the
preservation of mankind.

This God and living Power, was the Patron of Lord Faukonbridge, by whose
favor he hoped to conquer Fats, and subdue Kingdoms: This God when he saw him
thus highly dishonored, fury possessed him, and to the great disparagement of
all that heathen Nation, he desperately tore down the picture of Mahomet, and
with his keen edged Semitary cut it in small pieces, to the great amasement of
the Kings Nobility, who in greedy revenge furiously set upon him altogether
(like a number of whelps upon a princely Lion) who so Lyon-like behaved
himself, that in less then half an hour, he left breathless upon the
blood-died earth, more then six and twenty of the Kings Nobles, approving here
his unconquerable valor, proceeding from the virtue of his Lion like garment,
which the Fairy Queen had given him.

At this bold enterprise performed with his own hand, he caused the Moors to
ring forth their Alarm Bells, and to fire their Beakons, to raise up their
country forces, thinking that heaven had thither sent a confounder of mankind,
and that by his only means their kingdom should be subdued.

This matchless enterprise performed by noble minded Faukonbridge, did not a
little perplex the King, nor no idle fear assailed his mind, but such a fright
as made his very soul to tremble: wherefore to rid his kingdom from present
danger, in most kind manner he proclaimed truce, and dissemblingly applauded
Lord Faukonbridg for this desperate attempt: (and though to his grief of mind)
with fair and princely promises, he persuaded this English Gallant to depart
his Country: and the more to advance his deserved honors, the King bestowed
upon him twelve barrels of good red gold, and withal a ship well furnished,
to conduct him home into his own Country. Which kind favor was most
gratefully accepted off by noble Faukonbridge, who leaving the Morocco
Kingdom, put himself to Sea, committing his fortunes again to the merciles
waves, but making the Pilot and Mariners believe, that the twelve barrels of
gold, were but twelve barrels of red lead: a commodity most precious in his
native Country. The Pylot supposing no otherwise, sailed amain with
prosperous wind toward the Northern nations. In which succesfull journey, we
will leave now Lord Faukonbridge, and return to his unknown Mother (Lady
Clarabell) whom we left as you heard before, sleeping under a shade of trees,
where Lord Faukonbridge began to follow the chase, after the unlucky Raven.

Clarabell as we spoke of before in her sweet sleep, little dreaming of the
absenee of Faukonbridge, at her awaking, both mist him, and the ring; two
losses so precious, as even caused sorrow to revel in her bosom, that Joy was
a stranger, and content exiled; diverse were the doubts she had of his
misaduentures, one while she supposed death like a tyrant had possessed him,
another while she feared the breach of his promise, and that he had secretly
fled from her, bearing away with him the enchanted Ring: Now one thing, then
another, not knowing what to conjecture, but when she saw her self quite
bereft of his sweet presence, the only preserver of her life, exempted from al
hope of his recovery, in great grief of mind, she betook her self to
travel, and so with weary steps followed on the first path she found, wherein
she wandered day and night, receiving little rest, and less food, making this
sorrowful moan unto her self. Oh thou just doom (quoth she) of all
offenses, will thy heavy wrath be never mittigated? shall this my pining
punishment never end? shall woe upon woe still pursue me? weep in tears oh mine
eyes, be never dried fair lamentations: even at that hour when I hoped all
sorrows to be finished, began new grief, when in loosing my Son, I found a
Friend, whom now wanting, I find eternal causes of discontent: It cannot be
possible, but that some dismal mischance has befallen him, or some unlucky
Lot deceived me of him, there is no likelihood of his selfe-wild departure,
for in his breast he harbored thoughts of true humanity, honor guided him,
and virtue was his friend: how can it then be that of his own accord he is
departed? Surely some unlucky event has befalne him: therefore, oh my heart
sob in grief, and for his sake make thy life but a pilgrimage of woe, consume
in care, waste with weeping, for I have lost the Paragon of Knighthood, whose
countenance promised me to advance my desired hope, and bring me safely unto
the shore of my native Country: but seeing dole and discontent has crossed
all my good Fortunes, I will for his sake, with the treasure of my never
emptied purse, received from him, built up a Monastery, and in the same (like a
Monasticke Nun) spend out my days in the service of that God that has thus
crossed me, and there be a continual comforter of distressed Pilgrims, and
warfaring travelers, hoping that if life be in my dear friend, he will once
again arrive in that happy place, and once more satisfy my thirsting eye with
his Princely person. Being thus resolved, she traveled some three months
journey from the place, where she lost her dear friend the Lord Faukonbridge,
and there close by the Sea side, she builded a most stately Monastery,
relieuing still the wants of such distressed travelers as passed that way,
yielding as well lodging, as meat and drink, to such as stood in need thereof:
For the maintenance thereof, she had her enchanted purse still ready
furnished; thither resorted people of all degrees, thither came Princes,
Monarkes, and maiesticke Kings, that traveled in devotion to the shrine of
Christ in Jerusalem. Thither came worthy champions, Knights errant, and such as
sought for knightly atchieuements: t^ither came religious Churchmen, Prelates,
and holy minded men, zealously seeking by Pilgrimages to wipe away worldly
offenses, thither came Plowmen, Shepherds, Fishermen, and such as were numbered
amongst the common people, thinking thereby to obtain absolution for their
misdeeds, every one offering in zeal unto her great store of riches, whereof
she had little need, accounting it meritorious to give toward the maintenance
of so virtuous a custom. Amongst which number of Benefactors, there was one
Peter a Fisherman, that in devotion of mind, presented unto her a most dainty
Fish called a Dolphin, a present more fitter for a Prince, then such an humble
minded woman as she was, whose humility almost in that Country purchased her
the name of a Goddess: This gift from the fisherman was by her most courteously
received, and most bountifully requited with great store of gold, which she
took from out her enchanted purse: Herewith was old Peter well pleased, and
the Lady better contented, for in the Dolphins belly she found the same Ring,
which the Raven let fall into the Sea, the same Ring after which Lord
Faukonbridge so unhappily followed, the same King that by the precious touch of
it healed all diseases. In this accident fortune showed the pride of her glory,
and brought more strange admiration into the heart of Clarabell, then ever she
expected: but being possessed thereof, she verily believed that noble
Faukonbridge lay intombed in the watery Kingdom, and that never more the
consolation of his presence should in joyful manner delight her desirefull
eye: pale death (as she supposed by the finding of this Ring) had made prize
of his life, too rich a Jewel, as she said, for this ungrateful World,
therefore in the true zeal of heart, and in remembrance of his worthiness,
she caused a Faulkon of Gold to be set upon the top of the Monastery, wherein
she dwelled, the bright eluminating color thereof shined into the Sea, and
was ever after that made a mark, or a guide for Mariners to sail by. Also
like a courteous Lady, to quittance old Peter the fishermans rich present, by
good Fortune bestowed upon her, she canonised the Monastery, and called it
after his name, Saint Peter's Hermitage a place of charity, and a receipt for all
such as wanted maintenance. After this, thousands of oppressed people in this
place found succor, Pilgrims and weary travelers here freely found lodging:
Widows and succourlesse Children, here tasted bounties liberality, maimed
Soldiers, and such as lost their limbs in the service of their Country, here
slept upon downy beds, more softer then naples silk: Blind, deaf, and dumb,
in this place found help, not any diseased creature went from hence uncured,
all which by this virtuous Lady, was only done in charity for Gods sake, and
to appease the torments of his soul, that in guiding her to her native
Country, lost his dear life. Wherefore from this day, to her lives departure,
she desired the fellowship of virtue, abandoning all immodest behavior,
vowing her self to the service of Heaven, and good deeds, in which she
continually striued to exceed all others of her time: which good devotions we
for a while will ouerpasse; and report of other delightful accidents, agreeing
to the course of this our History.

CHAP. VII. How Lord Faukonbridge lost himself in a barren Island. His means
of recovery. The finding again of Clarabell. How these two were made known to
each other. And of the great ioies betwixt the mother and her Son.
NOw is it time to report again of Lord Faukonbridge, and his fortunes on the
Sea, and how his ship laden with his barrels of gold, lay houering on the
billows, many a day expecting a prosperous wind for England, but obtained
none: For fate and good Fortune crossed their hopes, and want of victuals so
oppressed them, that hunger almost surprised their lives, and like a pitiless
Tyrant would grant them no remorse: twice six months continued this their
extremity, to the terror of all good men, a death bringing horror both to man
and beast. At the last, after they had made many submissiue prayers to God for
a good wind, Aeolus set open his brazen gates, and sent them such a gentle
gale, that they in three hours sailing, arrived upon an Island so barren, that
therein they found no other thing to succor their distresses, and preserve
them from famishment, but only fresh water, with the which they sufficiently
stored their ship, giving Heaven thanks for so blessed a favor. But this
suffised not the desires of noble Faukonbridge, hoping to find better relief
for him and his men, resolutely adventured further up into the Island, to
discover if he could wherewithal to vittaile his ship. But woe is me to report
it, this aduenturous Gentleman traveled so far, that he lost his way, not
being able to return back unto his company, by which means he was
constrained to stay all night upon the top of a tree, for fear of wild
beasts, whereof the Island was full. But now mark how unlucky all things fell
out, the same night the wind rose, and so violently drove the ship from the
shore, that the Pilot was enforced to leave Lord Faukonbridge a Land, and
commit his Fortunes to the Sea, where before day light they were cast upon the
coast where Saint Peter's charitable Hermitage was situated, they being
Infidels and Moorish natured people, never expected the safety of Lord
Faukonbrdge, being a Christian, but left him comfortless in the barren Island,
and cast a shore where fair Clarabell abode, where coming a Land, desired her
for his sake that created her, to afford them some relief, whereby their
lives might be saved, and their ship sufficiently replenished with food fitting
their intended voyage. Pitiful Clarabell good Lady* she greatly reioiced
that it lay in her power to furnish their wants, most willingly gave them
entertainment, and yielded them such refreshing comforts, as preserved both
their ship and lives from perishing. Likewise they meaning to express no
ungrateful thanks for so kind a favor, as an humble sign of good will,
courteously bestowed upon her, the twelve barrels of gold which Lord
Faukonbridge reported to be red lead, all which according to her gentle nature,
noble minded Clarabell received. So parting with thanks to each other, the
Pilot returned to Morocco, very joyful for the riddance of Lord Faukonbridge,
their Countries supposed enemy, and she no less delighted in the performance
of her bountiful charity extended to the preservation of so many dying men.
All this while Lord Faukonbridge remained in the barren Island, almost
hunger-starued for want of food, in which place was nothing found to satisfy
his gentle nature, but the flesh of wild beasts which he killed with his own
hands, which (for want of fire) he roasted in the sun, and with the same, (to
his content) made more pleasinger banquets, then when he feasted in the Morocco
Court, only patience chiefly guided him, but being thus lost, and exiled from
the society of humane creatures, he lived a long time in the woods, in such
penury and want, that his strength began to fail, sickness grew on, and
danger of life tormented him for want of natural sustenance, caused a grievous
kind of leprosy to grow quite over his body, in such sort, that his Princely
countenance was suddenly changed into a most ugly visage, and pale death as it
were sat perching upon his heavy brow, betwixt life and death, he sat him
down upon the root of a dead withered tree, making this complaint unto
himself. If ever pity (quoth he) entered the celestial gate of Heaven, or
ever remorsfull mercy tenderly looked into the poor estate of a miserable
Gentleman, then by this my lives ruin, may be seen the true patter^e of
calamity: woe upon me, cross upon cross, and extremity upon extremity, makes
a unity, and all conspires together to work my good Fortunes confusion. Here
am I now left in a wilderness of desolation, friendlesse without comforter,
not knowing which way to get forth, but committed to the vile tyranny of
untamed Tigers, even ready to intombe my dying body within their
blood-thirsting bowels, a grave most unfit to close up my new created life. In
speaking these words, he heard from a far, as it were out of a hollow vaute,
a voice sounding forth these speeches: Faulkonbridge, rise up and follow me:
Fate and good chance will prosper thee. This seemed to be the voice of the
Fairy Queen, his old Nurse, being still most careful of his lives
preservation, as it was indeed; which no sooner ecchoed in the ears of Lord
Faukonbridge, but he arose from under the tree where he lay, and being ready to
go forward all weak and sickely as he was, he espied before, one of the Fairy
Instruments, which was an Ignis Fatuis, the fire of destiny, or a going fire,
which by nature fully leads wandering travelers out of the way. This as his
guide went still before him, he with a slow pace followed after, not
intercepted by any misaduenture, till he came to the Sea side, where being
joyfully arrived, in good time he beheld a Bark sailing by, to which he made
show of entertainment, as one desirous to be taken into their ship, and to be
conducted in to some better resting place: both his motions and his intent the
Mariners soon perceived, whereupon they satisfied his desire, and within few
^aies set him safely upon the next inhabited kingdom, which was the happy
place where Clarabell affoorded such bountiful liberality. Being thither come,
the Country people and such as beheld his perplexed estate, led him as
diseased as he was unto Clarabels Monastery, where being arrived, and standing
shaking at the gate, he desired for his sake that pardons all sins, and
requiteth all good deeds, that she would with the oil of her skill balm his
grieved pains, and with the mercy that she freely bestows upon distressed
souls, cure his malady. Gentle Clarabell at this his humble request, called
him in, leading him up inio a close chamber, prepared only for the comfort of
such woeful creatures, in which place after she had received his drooping
senses, and by the virtues of the same ring (he in former times had bestowed
upon her) recovered his wonted health, she seeming in his face, that beauty
replenished again, which before that time she supposed to have seen, and
calling to remembrance his former Favor, she perfectly knew him, whereupon
seeking to embrace him, she sounded in his arms, and for the sudden joy that
he received by his strange return, lay for a good season in a dying trance:
but being by great diligence recovered, they recounted each to other the
wonderful Fortunes passed betwixt them, from the first loosing of one another
to that hour, Likewise he spoke, how he neither knew Father nor Mother, nor
from whence he descended, and withal (opening his bosom) he showed her the
golden Faulkon, by nature pictured upon his breast, which when she beheld, her
very soul, as it were elevated it self to Heaven, and more then mortal joy
possessed her heart. By this she knew him to be her only Son, begot by King
Richard Cordelion, King of England, and so made it known unto him. Which when
good Lord Faukonbridge understood, he in the true duty of a Son newly
created, down upon his knees, craved her blessing, and in great humility of
mind gave thanks to heaven, in that it was his Fortune to defend his mother in
an unknown Land, from so many dangers, and she likewise made many devout
Orizons to God, that in his mercy had so preserved them, and in this manner
brought them most strangely together.

FINIS.
