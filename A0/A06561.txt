The proverbs of Lydgate.





GO kiss ye steps of them yt were forthery^g
Laureate poets which had soueraynte
Of eloquence to supporte thy making
And pray all tho / yt shall this process se
In thyn excuse / that they list to be
Favorable to lack or to commend
Get tyhgrounde upon humylyte
Unto their grace that thou may up ascend
In a short clause thy content rehersynge
As one up clymbeth to great prosperyte
So another by expert knowlechynge
Fro great richesse is brought to pouerte
Alas o book what shall I say in the
Thy tragedyes thrughe all the world to send
Go forth I pray excuse thyselfe and me
Who loves most virtue highest shall ascend
Black by the wede of complaynt and morning
Called fall of princes from their felycyte
Like chantyplur^ now singing now weeping
Woe after myrthe / next Joy aduersyte
So intermedled there is no surete
Like as this book does preyse and reprehende
Now on the whele / now set in low degree
Who will increase by virtue must ascend
SOdeyne departing out of felycyte
In to myserye and mortal heaviness
Unware depryuynge of our prosperyte
Change of gladness in to wretchedness
Long languysshynge in woe and bytternesse
Contynuell sorrow dread / dole and offense
Were first brought in by inobyence
Adam and Eve lost their lyberte
Their fraunchyse and their blyssednesse
Put in to exyle and captyuyte
To live in labor woe and pensyfnesse
Through false desire of pompous wylfulnes
To the serpent when they gave credence
The lord mystrustynge thrughe inobedyence
But oo alas as they were fre
Of Joy eternell stood in sykernesse
They were to blind alas it is pity
To leave their rest and live in werynesse
All their of spring to bring in dystresse
Drawing fro god his dew reverence
Through false consenting to inobedyence
Wherefore ye princes auysyly do se
As this tragedye in manner bears witness
Where as wants in any comonte
Subieccyon for lack of meekness
And while pouert pride has an interesse
There follows after thrughe froward insolence
Among the people falls inobedyence
And noble princes which has the soueraynte
To govern the people in ryghtwysnesse
Like as ye cherysshe them in peace and unity
Or frowardly dystroye them or oppress
So agaynwarde their courages they will dress
Lowly to obey / to your magnyfycence
Or dysobeye by inobedyence
Paupertas conqueritur super fortuna^
THis wredchyd world is transmutacyon
As well / and woe / now poor / and now / honor
Withouten order / or wise dyscrecyon
Governed is by fortunes error
But nevertheless / the lack of her favor
Ne may not do me / sing though that I dye
Iay toutz perdu mon temps et mon labor
For finally / fortune I defye
Yet is me left the sight of my reason
To know friend fro fo in my myrroure
So much has yet thy turnynge up and down
I taught me to know in an hour
But truly no fors of thy reddoure
To him that on himself has maystrye
My suffysaunce shall be my socoure
For finally fortune I defye
O Socrates thou steadfast champyon
She might never be thy tormentour
Thou never dreddest her oppressyon
Ne in her chere found thou no favor
Thou knew well / the deceyte of her color
And that her most worship is to lie
I know her eke / a false dyssymulour
For finally fortune I dyffye
Fortuna ad paupertate^.
No man is wretched / but himself it wene
And he that has himself has suffysaunce
Why say thou than / I am to the so kene
That have thyselfe out of my governance
Say thus gramercy of thyn haboundaunce
That thou have lent / or this thou shall not strive
What wotest thou yet how I will the auaunce
And eke thou haste / thy best friend alive
I have the taught / dyuysyon between
Friend of effect / and friend of countenance
The needs not / the galle of none hen
That cures eyes / duk for penance
Now seyst thou clear / that were in ygnoraunce
Yet hold thyn anchor / and yet thou may aryue
There bounte bears / the keye of my substance
And eke thou have thy best friend alive
How many have I refused to sustene
Sith I the fostered / have in my pleasaunce
Will thou than make / a statute on thy queen
That I shall be ay at thyn ordinance
Thou borne art in my reygne of varyaunce
About the whele with other must thou drive
My lore is better than thy wicked governance
And eke thou have thy best friend alive
Paupertas ad fortunam.
Thy lore I dampne / it is aduersyte
My friend / may thou not reave blind goddess
And that I friends knew / I thank it the
Take them again / let them go lie on press
The negardes / keeping their richesse
Pronostyk is / her toure thou will assayll
Wicked appetyte / comes a before sykenesse
In general this rule may not fail
Fortuna ad paupertatem
Thou pynchest at my mutabylyte.
For I the lent a drop of my richesse
And now me lyketh to withdraw me
Why sholdest thou my royalte oppress
The se may ebb / and flow more and less
The sky has might / to shine rain and hayll
Right so may I stowe my brytylnesse
In general this rule may not fayll
Paupertas ad fortuna^.
So execucyon of the mageste
That all puruayeth of his ryghtwysmesse
That same thing fortune clepe ye
Ye blind beestes / full of rudeness
The heaven has properte of sykernesse
This world has ever / restles trauayll
Thy last day is end of mine intresse
In general I this rule may not fayll
Finis.
Ecce bonu^ consiliu^ galfridi chaucers contra fortuna^.
FLe from the prece and dwell with so the fastness
Suffyse unto thy good though it be small
For hoorde has hate / and clymbynge tykylnesse
Prece has envy / and well is blente over all
Sauoure no more than the behoue shall
Rule thyselfe that other folk can reed
And truth the shall deliver it is no dread
Pain the not each crooked to redress
In trust of her that turns as a ball
Great rest* stand in little business
Be ware also to sporne against a wall
Strive not as does a cocle with a whall
Daunt thyselfe that dauntest other deed
And truth the shall deliver it is no dread
That the is sent receive it in buxumnesse
The wrastlynge of this world asks a fall
Here is none home / here is but wilderness
Forth pilgrim forth / forth be out of the stall
Look up on high / and thank our lord of all
Weye thy lust / and let thy ghoost the led
And truth the shall deliver it is no dread
THe unsure gladness the Joy transytory
He unstable surenes the transmutacyons
The gloury bryghtnes / the false eclypsed glory
Of erthly princes which have possessions
And monarchies and domynacyons
Their sudden change declares to us all
Their pompous fygures meynt with bitter gall
This blind goddess in her consystour
With her pleasaunce medleth dyscencyons
After tryumphes conquest and vyctour
Reueth fro princes their sceptres and their crowns
And troubles the people with falls rebellyownes
Sith by these dukes which from her whelebe fall
All worldly sugar is meynt with bitter gall
This tragedye makes a memory
Of dukes twain and of their hye renownes
And of their law write a great hystorye
And how they conquered diverse regyownes
Governed cytees countrees and eke towns
Till fortune their prowess did appall
To their sugar was meynt with bitter gall
Princes pryncesses sees how deceptour
Been all these worldly reuolucyons
And how fortune in her reclinatour
With her tryacle tempreth false poisons
So meruaylous been her confeccyons
Of frowardness she will what so befall
Ay with her sug^r of custom temper gall
A co^mendacyon of pacyence.

In thaureate throne / perpetually to endure
Three Ierarchyes / there being in presence
With whom humylyte / has sovereign acquayntau^ce
Where Osanna / with devout dylygence

Tofore the throne / keeping their obseruaunce

Grave in their hertes / and in their conscience
Voydynge all trouble / of worldy perturbaunce
Chaunges of forture / with her double haunce
Louyd god and dradde / above each creature
In hope with him perpetually to endure
Mine auctour Bochas writes no longer process
Of Julius death complaining but a while
To write of Tully in haste he began him dress
Compendyously his life for to compyle
Complaining first / his baren style
Is insuffycyente to write as men may seen
Of so notable a rethorycyen
The name of Tullius / was known in many place
His eloquence in every land was ryfe
His langage made him stand in grace
And be prefered during all his life
Married he was / and had a right fair wife
Children many servants young and old
And I find he held a good household
This thing was done / when yt in rome town
The strife was grettest between Caesar and po^peye
And for Tullius drew him to Caton
With Pompeyus Caesar to warreye
And of Julius the party dysobeye
Out of Rome Tullius did him hye
Fled with Pompeye in to Thessalye
Caesar after of his free mo^cyoune
When that he stood highest in his glory
Him reconsyled again to Rome town
Upon Pompeye accomplysshed the vyctorye
But Iulyus slain in the consystorye
By syxty senators being of assent
Tullius was again in to exyle sent
And in a cite called Farnuan
Tullius his exyle did endure
For Anthonius was to him enmy than
Because that he / parcase of adventure
Compyled had an Inuentyf scripture
Again Anthonyne rehersynge all the case
Of his defautes and of Cleopateas
Thus of envy and of mortal hatred
His death was compassed by Anthonius
And afterward execute in deed
By procuring of one Pompilius
Gate co^myssyon y^ storye tells thus
Of falls malys and forth anon went he
In to Gayte / of champaygne a cite
And by the virtue of his co^myssyowne
Taking of Anthyne license and lyberte
Chief Rethorycyen yt ever was in the town
Among Romans to worship the cite
Was slain alas of hate and enmyte
By Pompilius rote of all falshede
Proferynge himself to smite of his head
Tullius before had been his defense
Fro the galowes and his death eke let
Which had deserved for his great offense
To have been hanged upon a hye gybet
Who saves a thief when the rope is knet
About his neck as old clerks write
With some falls torn ye brybour will him quyte
Lo here the vice of ingratytude
By experyence brought fully to a prefe
Who in his heart treason does include
Cast for good will to do a man reprefe
What is the guerdon for to save a thief
When he is escaped look ye shall find
Of his nature ever to be vnkynnde
This poplyue traitor most odyble
To show himself false cruel and vengeable
Toward Tully did a thing horrible
When he was deed / this brybour most culpable
Smote of his right hand / to here abhomynable
With which hand he living on him took
To write of virtues many a famous book
The hand / the heed of noble Tullyus
Which every man ought of right complain
Were take and brought by Pompylyus
Upon a stake set up both the tweyne
There to abide whether it did shine or rain
With wind and weder till they were yffyed
In token all favor was to him denied
THis tragedye does naturally complain
Upon this vice called unkindness
Which to punysshe is torment / none nor pain
Rygoure condygne / flagell / nor duresse
Enprysonynge / nor none erthely dystresse
That may suffyce bryefly to conclude
Again the vice of ingratytude
All creatures on this vice complain
Law / nature / deeres / ryghtwysnesse
This monster in kind does the light dysteyne
Of every virtue derketh the bryghtnes
Alysander can bear hereof witness
Which to his for there is he of tatches rude
Showed the vice of ingratytude
Of Cerberus thynfernall tryble chain
Nor of Tantalus honger nor thrustynesse
Of Xxion or Cicius both twain
Reken their torment remember their sharpness
All were to little to chastyce or redress
The hateful vice of them yt can delude
Their friends old / by falls ingratytude
Noble princes which in your demayne
Have governance of all worldy richesse
Again folk unkind look that ye dysdayne
Suffer them not have none interesse
For to approach to your high nobleness
For there is no vice more hateful to conclude
Than is the vice of Ingratytude
Consulo quisquis eris: qui pacis sedera queris
Consonus esto lupis: cu^ quibz esse cupis
I Counsayll what so ever thou be
Of polycye / foresyght and prudence
If thou will live in peace and unity
Conform thyselfe and think on this sentence
Where so ever thou hold resydence
Among wolles / be woluysshe of courage
Lion with lions / a lamb for Innocence
Like the audyence / so utter thy language
The unicorn is caught with maidens song
By dysposycyour record of scryptuee
With cormorauntes make thy neck long
In pondes deep / thy prays to recure
Among foxes / be foxysshe of nature
Among raueners think for auantage
With empty hand / men may not hawks lure
And like thy audyence so vttre thy language
With holy men speak of holiness
And with a glouton / be delycate of thy fare
With dronken men / do surfettes by excess
And among wasters no spending that thou spare
With wodcockes / learn for to dare
And sharp thy knyfe / with pyllers for pylage
Like the market / so preyse thy chaffare
And like thy audyence so utter thy language
With an Otyr spare river none nor ponde
With them that forette / rob conyngers
A blood hounde with bow and arowe in hand
Maugre the watch of fosters and parkers
Like thy felawshyp / spare no dangers
For life nor death / thy life put in morgage
Among knights / squyers chanons monks freers
Like thy audyence utter thy language
Danyell lay / a prophet full notable
Of god preserved / in prison with lions
Where god list spare / a Tygre is not vengeable
No cruel beestes / beres nor gryffons
And if thou be in caves with dragons
Remember how abacuk / brought potage
So far to danyel / to many regyons
As case requires so utter thy language
With wise men talk of sapyence
With philosophers speak of phylosophye
With shypmen sayllynge that have experyence
In troubly sees / how they shall them guye
And with poets talk of poetrye
Be not presumptuous / of chere nor of vysage
But where thou come / in any company
Like the audyence / so utter thy language
This little dytee / concludynge in menynge
Who that cast him / this rule for to keep
Must conform him / like in every thing
Where he shall bide / unto the felawshyp
With watch men wake / with sloggy folk sleep
With wood men wood / with frontyke folk savage
Run with beestes / with wild worms crepe
And like thy audyence / utter thy language
Among all these / I counsayll yet take heed
Where thou abydest / or rest in any place
In chief love god / and with thy love have dread
And be ferefull again him to trespace
With virtuous men / increase shall thy grace
And vycyous folk / are cause of great do^mage
In every felawshyp so for thyselfe purchase
Where virtue regneth / there utter thy language
Be paid with little / content with suffysaunce
Clymbe not to hye / thus byddeth Socrates
Glad pouert is / of treasours most substance
And Caton says / is none so great encreas
Of worly treasour / as for to live in peace
Which among virtues / has the vassalage
I take record of Dyogenes
Which to Alexander had this language
His palace was a little poor tonne
Which on a whele / with him he began carye
Badde this Emperor / ride out of his son
Which dempte himself / rycher than king darye
Kept with his vessel / fro wyndes most contrary
Wherein he made daily his passage
This philosopher / with princes list not tarry
Nor in their presence / to utter no language
Between these twain a great comparyson
King Alexander / he conquered all
Dyogenes lay in a small dongeon
Like sundry weders / which turned as a ball
Fortune to Alexander / gave a sudden fall
The philosopher dysposed the comynage
He thought virtue / was more imperyall
Than is acquayntaunce / with all his proud language
Anthony and Poule despised all richesse
Lived in deserte / of wylfull pouerte
Caesar and Pompeye / of marcyall woodnesse
By their enuyous / compassed cruelte
Between germany and affrycke was great enmyte
No comparyson between good greyn and forage
Praise every thing like to his degree
And like thy audyence / so utter thy language
I found a likeness depyct upon a wall
Armed in virtues / as I walked up and down
The head of three / full solemn and royal
Intellectus / memory / and reason
With eyes and eres / of clear dyscrecyon
Mouth and tongue / auoyden all outrage
Again the vice of falls detraccyon
To do not surfeit / in word nor in language
Hand and arms / with this dyscrecyon
Where so man have / force or feblenesse
Truly to mean / in his affection
For fraud or favor / to follow ryghtwysnesse
Outrayles inward / devotion with meekness
Passing pygmalyon / which graued an image
Prayed to Venus of lovers chief goddess
To grant it life / and quyckenesse of language
Of hole entente / pray we to christ Ihu^
To quyk a figure / in our conscience
Reason as heed / with members of virtue
Before rehearsed / breefly in sentence
Under supporte of his magnyfycence
Christ so list govern / our worldly pilgrimage
Between vice and virtue / to set a dyfference
To his pleasaunce / to vttre our language
Lenuoy.
Toward the end of frosty Ianuarye
When watery phoebus / had his purpose take.
For a season to soiourne in aquarye
And Caprycorne had utterly forsake
Toward aurora amorowe as I began wake
A feldfare / full erly took her flight
Tofore my study / sange with her feathers blake
Look in thy myrrour and deem none other wight
Though the pecocke / have wings bright and shene
Granted by nature to his great auayll
Withgolde and azure / and Emendes grene
And Argus eyes / portrayed in his tayll
Berynge up his feathers / dysplayed like a sayll
Toward his fete / when he cast down his sight
To bate his pride there is no bet cou^sayll
Look in thy myrrour and deem none other wight
The king of fowls / most imperyall
Which with his look / perseth the fervent son
The Egle as chief / of nature most royal
As old clerks / well deuyse konne
To phoebus palace / by flight when he has won
What follows after / for all his great might
But men remember / upon his feathers done
Look in thy myrroure and deem none other wight
In large lakes / and ryuers fresshe renuynge
The yelowe swanne / famous and agreeable
Again his death / melodyously singing
His fat all notes / pyteous and lamentable
Plainly declare / in earth is nothing stable
His byll his fete / who look a right
In token of morning / ben of color sable
Look in thy myrrour and deem none other wight
The hardy lion / of beestes lord and king
When he sit crowned / as prince of wilderness
All other beestes / obey at his bidding
As kind has taught them / their lady and maystresse
But notwithstondynge his bestyall sturdynesse
When he is most furyous in his might
There comes a quartayn / sith in his great actesse
Look in thy myrrour and deem none other wight
The Tygre of nature / excels of swyftnesse
The Lynx with lokynge / perceth a stone wall
The unicorn by musycall swetnesse
Between two maidens / is take and has a fall
All worldy thing / tourneth as a ball
The heart / the roo / ben of their course full light
By their prerogatyues / but none alone has all
Look in thy myrrour / and deem none other wight
Among all beestes / the lion is most strong
Of nature the lamb / has great meekness
The wulfe dysposed / by rauayne to do wrong
The sleyghty fox / small pollet does oppress
To fysshe in water / the Ottyr does duresse
Great dyfference between day and night
Lack of dyscrecyon causes great blyndnesse
Look in thy myrroure and deem none other wight
Though thou have power / oppress not thy parayll
Of one matter / was made each creature
Pride of a tyrant / a season may preuayll
A chorle to regne / is contrary to nature
No vengeable heart / shall no while endure
Their tort power / nor falls usurped might
List for no doctor / nor techynge of scripture
Look in their myrour and deem none other wight
eyse up a beggar / that came of naught
Set in a chayer / of worldy dygnyte
When falls presumpcyon / is entered in his thought
Has clean forgete / his state of pouerte
And as up raised / unto the royal see
Of a lion / knows not day fro night
A fool list not / in his prosperyte
Look in his myrour and deem none other wight
Thus by a manner / of symylytude
Tyrauntes lykened / to beestes rauynous
Folk yt ben humble / plainly to conclude
Resemble beestes / meke and virtuous
Some folk peasable / some contraryous
Sondrymelled / now heavy / and now light
One is froward / another is gracyous
Look in thy myrrour and deem none other wight
Some man of heart / dysposed to pride
By dysposycyon / of froward surquedye
Some man may suffer / and long time abide
Some man vengeable / of old melancolye
Some man consumed / with hate and falls envy
To hold a quarrel / whether it be wrong or right
But unto purpose this matter to apply
Look in thy myrrour and deem none other wight
No man is clear / without some trespace
Blyssed is he / that never did offense
Do man is meke / another does menace
Some man is fyers / some man has pacyence
One is rebel / another does reverence
Some man coorbed / some man gothe vpryght
Let each man search his own conscience
Look in thy myrrour / and deem none other wight
Things contrary / be not according
A poor man proud / is not commendable
Nor a fair saphyr / set in a coper ring
A beggars thret / with mouth to be vengeable
Nor fair behestes / of purpose varyable
A lords heart / a purse yt peyseth light
Outward gay speech / in menynge dysceyuable
Look in thy myrrour / and deem none other wight
Some give no forse / for to be sworn
Only for lucre / abraydynge on falsnesse
Some can dyssymyle / and blow the buckes hoorne
By appearance / of feigned kyndenesse
Under flowers / of fraudulent fresshenesse
The serpent dares / with his scales bright
Galle under sugar / has double bytternesse
Look in thy myrrour and deem none other wight
Cure not thy conceyte / with no feigned glosys
Some golden flowers / have a bitter rote
Sharp thorns / hid sometime under rosys
Foul heyr oppressed / with synamomes soote
Let falls / presumpcyon play ball under foot
Torches compared to phoebus bemes bright
What does clear perle / on a baudy boot
Look in thy myrroure / and deem none other might
Kind in her works / can hinder and prefer
Set dyfferences many mo than one
Atwene phoebus / and a little sterre
Between a flynte / and a precious stone
Between a dull mason / and pygmalyon
Between Tercytes / and Hector a good knight
Let every man gnawe on his own bone
Look in thy myrrour and deem none other wight
Some man is strong / beres to bind
Another feeble / preferred with prudence
One swyft to run / another comes behind
One has slouthe another has dylygence
Some man has conning / lacking eloquence
Some have force / yet they dare not fight
Peace most profyteth with this experyence
Look in thy myrrour / and deem none other wight
Some man has beauty / another has goodness
One has Joy / another aduersyte
Some man fortune / and plentuous richesse
Some man content / and glad with pouerte
Some one has health / another infyrmyte
What ever god sent / thank him with all thy might
Grutche not again / and learn this thing of me
Look in thy myrrour / and deem none other wight
There is no gardyn / so full of fresshe flowers
But that there are / among them some wedes seen
The holsom Roser / for all his sweet odoures
Grows on thorns / pryckynge sharp and kene

Dysplayeth her crown / again phoebus bemys bright
In storms dreepeth / conceive what I mean
Look in thy myrrour and deem none other wight
The summers day / is never or seldom seyn
With some clear air / but that there is some sky
Nor no man erthly / so virtuous in certain

As says musycyens / which know yt craft aryght
On true accord / stands all armony
Look in thy myrrure and deem none other wight

To race out pride / and set in first meekness
Again couetyse compassyon and alms
Fro poor people let no man turn his sight
Again flesshely lust / chastyte and clennesse
Look in thy myrrour / and deem none other wight
Of every man by report of language
Affyle thy tongue / of true affection
Of haste nor rancour / with mouth do no do^mage
Restrain thy courage / fro falls detraccyon
Fro flaterye / and adulacyon
Withstonde wrong / sustain truth and right
Fle doubleness / fraud and collusyon
Look in thy myrroure and deem none other wight
No man of kind / is more suspeccyous
Than he that is most vycyous and culpable
Because he halteth / and is not virtuous
He would cche man to him were resemblable
A galled horse will wynche in a stable
For noise of sadels heavy either light
A fool that is / by report reprouable
Should look in his myrroure and deem none other wight
That man for virtue may were a dyademe
With stones. xii remembered by auctours
And as king / well crowned he may been
That has no wede / growing among his flowers
Though apryll have many sweet showers
Fro Iupyter / an unware thundre light
Sith with an hayll / fro sagyttaryes toures
Look in thy myrrour / and deem none other wight
With virtuous pity / and just compassyon
Rewe on thy neighbor / when he is culpable
Let mercy mode^ye / rygorous correccyon
All we be sinners / though god be not vengeable
We might not live / but he were mercyable
That his pacyence / peysed adowne his right
After your domes / ye Iuges most notable
Look in your myrrour and deem none other wight
Set a myrrour / of light dyscrecyon
Tofore your face / by polytyk governance
Fare farer with them / that have contrycyon
And for their surfettes / in heart have repentance
Let not your sword / be whet to do vengeance
Between flat and edge / though sharpness token light
The flat of mercy / prynte in your remembrance
Look well your myrrour / or ye deem any wight
Go little byll / with out title or date
And of hole heart / reco^mau^de me
Which that am called Johan Lydgate
To all tho folk / which list to have pity
On them yt suffer trouble and aduersyte
Beseech them all yt the shall read a right
Mercy to meddle with truth and equity
And look well their myrrours and deem none other wight
