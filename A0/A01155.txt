A Discourse of things happened in France, since the Month of September.
Anno. 1568.
When Gods goodness and providence, with manifest help and fatherly care had
withdrawn (as al me^ know) the Prince of Condyes grace, and my Lord the Admiral
from the extreme peril, and almost vnaduoydable danger of their lives, in
which they were at Noyers and Tanlag, he guyded and conducted them to Rochel:
(from one part of the Realm to the other) without any harm or danger, with
their wives and children, yea their cradles and nourses, with small train, and
great iourneys, by bye ways and villages, unhandsome and ill appointed. Not
long after, continuing his goodness and favor toward Monsieur Dandelot,
which was in Britayne, so assisted him, that though he were pursued by the
Lords Montpensier and Martigues, accompanied with great strength both of
footmen and horsemen, to hinder his joining with the prince, this
notwithstanding, beyond al expectation he passed over the river of Loyre, with
all his troop in their sight, at a foorde, which was never marked or known
of the dwellers them selves. The favor of God appeared also in the passage of
the Queen of Navarre and the Prince her son, which went through the whole
country of Gascoigne passed the river of Garonne and Dordoigne, with other
rivers, foordes and perilous streights though they were straightly followed by
the Lords of Montluc, Terides, Descare, and Losses with great force, without
any hyndrance at all. The like was seen also in the passage of Monsieur Dacier
which marched with all his troop thorough the whole countries of Dalphine,
Languedoc and Gascoigne, to meet with my lords the Princes, in the sight and
knowledge of the Lord Ioyeuse, which had express charge to stay him: so that
in despite of the said Princes enemies, they have gathered together from all
corners of this realm, to the number of five and twenty thousand
hargebouziers, and five or six thousand horsemen, notwithstanding the order
taken by their said enemies at all ports, bridges, straights and passages, and
having their army ready four months before, wherewith (God be thanked) they
could never touch the said Lords princes, or let them from taking of their
towns of S. Maxant, Fontenay, Nyort, Coignac, Xantes, S. John d' Angely,
Angoulesme, Ponts, Bourg, Taillebourg, Taillemont, and other towns, from the
river of Gyronde, unto the suburbs of Salmure upon Loyre, some by composition
and other some by force. And though the same were done in the sight of all men,
but only that the said Lord Princes were at the siege before the said town
of Ponts, they were advertised that the said Lord of Assier was arrived with
his troop at Aubeterre, which was with a hundredth and three score enseignes
of footeme^, being in number a fourtene thousand harguebouziers, and six
thousand pikemen, and twelve hundredth horsemen: and that the enemies had
suddenly taken the Captain Mauuance, and the Captain Pieregourdis, and had
overthrown them with certain number of their soldiers, which caused the
said Princes, fearyng some greater mischief, to march with their army
toward the said place of Aubeterre, myndyng to fight with the enemies if
they would stand to it: who so soon as they had news of the Princes
coming, removed incontine^t. And because they understood they took the way to
Poitiers, they determined to overtake them if it might be with as great
iourneys as was possible, seeking al means to make them come to the battle,
wherein they used such diligence, that the third day they were so nygh them,
that where the fore ward of the said Princes lodged, the enemies were
vnlodged a little before: and oftentimes they found their bread, munition and
carriage, so that seeing them selves pursued so nygh, they were constrained to
retire to Chastellerault and those parts, where they entrenched them selves
and their artillery, and met with Monsieur the kings brother with new
force. And for that it was reported by the Gentlemen that were sent to descry
them near, that the coming to them was so daungerouse and hard, that it had
been to no purpose, and without reason to assail them in their camp, which
they had so well fortified with trenches, and so well provided with munition
and artillery, which did so beat the said comers thereto, that it had been
impossible to keep array without great loss of men: it was determined to
present them selves to the sight of the army, to see if they would come out of
their fort, which was done by the lord Admiral with his foreward which he
kept a whole day in battle raye on the top of a hill, from whence they might
see the said town of Chastellerault, but the enemies made no countenance of
coming out to them. For this cause devising how they might get them out of
their forte, to a place where the said princes might fight with them, they
caused their army to march toward Mirebalois, which is a very good and
fruitful country, and whence their enemies had their most commodity of
vittayles, and where the said princes might best vittayle their men to the
hinderance of their enemies. And drawing thetherward, it happened that the
enemies appointed to lodge at the same place where the Princes army was
appointed. And that monsieur the Admiral and Monsieur Dandelot his brother
approchyng nyghe their lodgyng, accompanied with four or five Hundredth
horsemen at the most, they discryed their enemies which had all their horsemen
of the fore ward, to the number of two thousand horse. So that the said
Admiral sent incontinently on all parts for all the troops of horsemen, as
well of the battle as of the foreward, delaying still till the said Princes
began to appear with their battle and other troops of the fore ward, which
somewhat abashed the enemies, and then they caused certain harquebouziers to
approach nygh the enemies, and there was shot on both sides: but because it
was upon the closing in of day, and began to wax very dark, the battle
was deferred till the next day, at which time the said Princes with all their
armies began to march by break of day straight to the place where they had
left their enemies the even before, and the said princes perceiving that they
were departed, caused certain cornettes of horsemen to post after the said
enemies, to descry which way they took, and to assay once again if they
could provoke them to fight. Which they did to a village named Sausay, where
the lords of Guyse, Martigues, Brissac, Tauannes, Sansac, and diverse other
had lain that night, who were not the last that took their heels, and that
with such have, that they left all their carriage behind them, which was not
less worth than two hundredth thousand crowns, and eight or nine score
drawing horses, with certain powder. The said Princes being advertised that
all the fore ward of the enemies was out of array and confused, and that
Mountsalan amongst others was put to flight, and the most part of his company
slain and taken, and had their cornettes and enseignes, they began to march
as fast as they could after them to overtake them, which they could not do
till they came to a village named Iazeneuil, into which the enemies retired,
and where the Kings brother had fortified and trenched himself with his
artillerye. Where the Princes gave them the brauest skirmishe that ever was
given by memory of man, which lasted no less than four or five long hours,
where was shot on both sides, above fourscore thousand harquebouze shot, and
three hundredth seven and thirty great shot on the enemies side only, for that
the Princes great shot was not brought from the siege of Ponts: and it was
found by ye confession of the enemies themselves, yt they lost at this
skirmishe five or six hundredth Souldioures, and fiftene or sixtene Captains:
and on the Princes side there were two hundredth hurt and slain. Yet it was
written to the Queen by some of her trusty servant that are in the enemies
camp, that never French kings son was in so great danger, as my Lord the
kings brother, for the space of three days and three nights: and in deed it
is most certain that at the same skirmish, the said Princes footmen wanne
the trenches twice or thrice, and set upon the Artillery, and killed some at
their pieces, yea that many of the Souldioures entered into certain houses
which were within the enemies Fort, and brought away armor, and eat and
drank, whereof they had great need: for that three days together they wanted
vitailes, yet were they so pacie^t, and so desirous to fight, that they
forgatte the hunger that they suffered. This skirmish being ended, by ye means
of the night, the said Princes ordained that the next day by break of day,
they should present them selves in the same place of Iazeuenil, to see if they
could provoke the enemy to fight. Which was done, but none of ye enemies
durst show their heads, saving a hundredth or six score horsemen, and that so
nighe their fort, yt it was impossible to buckle with them. Since they had
news that they were retired to Luzignon, and thence to Poitiers: which caused
the said Princes to lodge their army in the Country of Myrebalois, where they
found great quantity of bread and munitio^, that the enemies had caused to be
provided, and understanding that they were come to lodge at Ausance, which is
within a league of Poitiers, and four leagues from the place where the said
Princes lodged, they prepared them such an enterprise, that the said Lord
Admiral with a thousand horsemen and only two thousand harquebouziers, drove
the said enemies into ye said village of Ausance, bet them from a bridge which
was there, and put all ye army to flight, who retired into Poitiers in great
disorder and confusion with the loss of many of their men, and of all their
carriage. And although things passed in this wise, yet are the said enemies so
shameless, that they give out rumors wholly contrary to the truth, yea they
sent letters to the Court wherein they were not ashamed to send word, yt they
withstoode the said Princes, where continually they put the^ to flight, and
sought all means possible to provoke them to fight. Whereto the said Lords
Princes seeing their enemies have so little lust, by reason of the ill success
that they had in the former encounters, to enforce the^ to fight, and (will
they nill they) to prevent such subtilties and disguisings as they commonly
used, this other day in the sight of their enemies, and of all their camp,
they took a town and castle belonging to one of the principal heads of their
army, although the said Town was furnished with men, artillery, and all
other kind of munition, as he to whom it belongs, has had good mean and
leisure to do: the taking whereof shall be so clear and evident witness of it
self, of the faint courage that they have to fight, that they shall never be
able hereafter to disguise and color their cowardice as they have done
heretofore. Afterward the said Lord Princes, seeing that neither the taking of
the said town and castle, nor any other occasion that they could give to the
enemies, could provoke them to fight, and that they kept them selves always on
the farther side of the river of Clain, whyther they fled when they were driven
from Ausance, having further a good river before them, and sonke all the boats
to hinder any enterprise that might be attempted against them: giving out yt
they tarried for the strength that came with the Seigneur of Ioyeuse which they
said was of six thousand hargebouziers and fiftene hundredth horse men: and
then they determined to fight with the army of the said princes. This caused
the Princes (to give them new occasion to pass the river, and to increase
their will and desire to fight) to force in their sight the town of Salmure,
which is a passage of the River of Loire, which drove the enemies into such a
jealousy, that they prepared themselves to hinder the said Princes from taking
of that town, and for this cause they marched forth their army, lodging their
fotemen in one of the Suburbs, but when the battery was ready, tidings came
yt the ennimies had passed over the River of Clain, making a countenance to
come to the rescuing of Salmure, with the forse of the Lord of Ioyeuse, which
was arrived two or three days before, which made the said Princes immediately
to raise their siege from Salmure, causing their army to march straight upon
the enemies, which was easy to be done, for that there was no river between
them and the said enemies which they met before the town of Loudun, which
were appointed to lodge in the Suburbs, where their lodging was ordained, from
whence my Lord the Admiral raised them, so that they retired and camped in
the places and villages about the said Loudun. The next day the two armies
faced one an other, their scoutes being within an hundredth paces the one of the
other. They shot their Ordinance on both parts, and so passed all that day
with certain small skirmishes only. And although the enemies had encamped the^
selves to the vauntage, which commonly they do that chose their place first,
and might have approached the said Princes army without any danger, which the
said Princes could not do to them, yet when they stepped two paces, the Princes
army stepped four to join with them: two days after the said two armies met
again in the same places, as they likewise did the day after yt. But ye
Princes could never get them from their vauntage, which is marvelous,
considering the bruites that they gave abroad, that they were so strengthened
with the Lord of Ioyeuses power, that they determined not to depart the places
till they had fought with the said Princes army, and said also that they had
express commandment so to do, or at the least to raise them from that
place, for thereon depended the honor of both the armies. But how soon this
hot courage was cooled, is easy to be judged by their sudden retiring a league
back from the place which they had taken, and getting a brook between them,
and the said Princes army. Who being not content with the vauntage that they
wanne of their said enemies, in raising them from the place that they said they
chose to fight on, followed them to the second place, and although the said
enemies had a great vauntage by reason of the brook which made them hard to be
come by, yet what with cannon shot and continual skirmishes that they gave
them, they constrained them again to lean that second place, and to retire,
(yea the kings brother himself) toward Chinon, and to pass the river of
Vienna, leaving all their sick behind them, and much of their carriage and
munitions. The Princes seeing this, appointed certain troops of horsemen and
foot men to follow them which set upon one place of the enemies where there
were seven Ensigns, whereof four were put to flight, and the other three
wholly discomfited, and their ensigns were burned in a house, where some of
the soldiers had withdrawn them selves. Afterward the said Princes seeing
all means of fighting to be taken away, by reason of a great and strong river
between them, determined to march with their army toward Towars and
Montreuilbellay, as well to refreshe them and for commodity of vitayles,
whereof they had great need for five or six days, as to coast the army of
the enemies, which being thus retired, diminishes and breaks away daily by
little and little, so that we hear from diverse places, that they talk of
passing over the river of Loyre again: to place part of their Army in all the
towns that lie on the said river, and to border it with warriors at all the
brydges, gates, passages and villages, and the other part to send toward the
camp that the King leuyeth against the Prince of Orange, and the Duke of
Swebrug. Which causes the said Princes now to determine, that as soon as
they have received those ten thousand footmen, and twelve hundredth horsemen
that the four Vicountes of Bourniquel, Poulin, Monclay and Calmont, bring unto
them to strenghten them, and which are almost arrived at their camp, to march
forewarde to the siege of some one of those towns on the said river, that
they may with all expedition join with the prince of Orange, and the duke of
Swebrug. From whom they have received news by certain Gentlemen that they
have sent unto the^, that they are not less than five and twenty or thirty
thousand horsemen, and three score thousand footmen when they be al met.
In the mean while the said Lord Princes have 35. enseignes of footmen and
twelve guydons which they have won of the enemies, besides the seven
enseignes of companies of footmen that were discomfited, at the departing from
before Loudun, which were burnt in the lodgyng to have the Soldiers that were
within. On the other side, the said four Vicountes lost no time where they
were, but took and put to fire and sword the town of Gaillac in which diverse
cruelties with marvelous stoutnesse had been committed against those of the
Religion, and also the low town of Carcassonne was taken by them, with twelve
or fiftene other towns Monsieur of Grammont in the country of Basque has
also disco^fited the seigneur of Luye which had raised four thousand me^
against those of the Religion, and won certain pieces of artillery from him.
The Cardinal of Lorayne perceyuyng that al things went not on his side as he
hoped and purposed, caused the Queen to send out Mo^s. Portall the general
receiver, to make some motion of peace, to the said Princes, to whom the like
answer was made, that was made to ye master of requests Malassise, that was
also sent by the Queen to the like end, which is this, that as long as the
Cardinal of Lorayne ruled and used such tyranny over France, and namely the
kings counsel, out of which they have driven away my Lord the Chancelour,
and the principal Officers of the crown, they would accept no letters nor
messages made under the name of his majesty, but only as coming from the
forge and invention of the said Cardinal, and that they had used so much
unfaithfulness in the treaty of peaces heretofore, that those of the Religion
are driven to this extremity, to believe that there is none other safety for
them, but by the mean of the sword.

Since that time the company of Monsieur Dinoy, took the last of Decembre in
the suburbs of Chynon four score Switsers with the Provost of the Kings
Brothers guard, which was on the far side the water, from whence the army
fled in great have. This is the happy success that it has pleased God
hitherto to give to the affairs of the said Princes, and the reward and
recompense that the enemies have received for their treason and
unfaithfulness, which is more then sufficiently verified by the contents of
the Popes Bull, which they sewed for in the Month of June and July last, and
dispatched at Rome, the last of August following, which said suit shall always
evidently co^uict them, yt they never intended but to break the faith and
public safetye, both promised and sworn, and further to revoke the Edict:
which came forth anon after, and in substance has relation to the laid Bull.
Whereby they revoke all the Edictes which have been heretofore made in the
favor of those of the Religion, as being made in the assemblies of men hired
or brybed thereto: though it be well known, that it was done in the solemnest
assemblye that ever was made in this realm, namely the Edict of January,
where all the Princes and Lords of the Council of both Religions, with the
greatest and most notable personages of all the high Courts of this Realm
were present, and further being made at the Request of the Estates. And for
sufficient proof to all those of the Religion, that they never meant but to
abolish and bring to naught ye said Religion, they declare in express words
by the same Edict, that they never minded or intended any other thing,
notwithstanding any commandments, Lettres patents, and declarations that have
been given forth or otherwise, and notwithstanding the great assurance of
words, that his Majesty has given, as well to his subjects, as to strange
Princes.
