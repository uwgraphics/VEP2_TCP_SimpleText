Saylors for my money.
A new Ditty composed in the praise of Saylors and Sea affairs, briefly
showing the nature of so worthy a calling, and effects of their industry.

To the tune of the Iouiall Cobbler.


Country men of England,
who live at home with ease:
And little think what dangers,
Are incident o'th Seas:
Give ear unto the Saylor
Who unto you will show:
His case,
His case:
How ere the wind does blow.
He that is a Saylor*
Must have a valiant heart:
For when he is upon the sea,
He is not like to start:
But must with noble courage,
All dangers undergo.
Resolve,
Resolve:
How ere the wind does blow.
Our calling is laborious,
And subject to much woe:
But we must still contented be:
With what falls to our share.
We must not be faint hearted*
Come tempest rain or snow:
Nor shrink:
Nor shrink:
How ere the wind does blow.
Sometimes one Neptunes bosom
Our ship is tossed with waves
And every minite we expect,
The sea must be our graves
Sometimes on high she mou^teth
Then falls again as low:
with waves:
with waves:
When stormy winds do blow.
Then with unfeigned prayers,
As Christian duty binds,
We turn unto ye Lord of hosts,
With all our hearts and minds,
To him we flee for succor,
For he we surely know,
can save:
can save,
How ere the wind does blow.
Then he who breaks the rage:
The rough and blustrous seas*
When his disciples were afraid
Will straght ye storms apease.
And give us cause to thank
On bended knees full low:
who saues:
who saues,
How ere the wind does blow.
Our enemies approaching,
When we on sea epsy,
We must resolve incontinent
To fight, although we die,
With noble resolution
We must oppose our foe,
in fight,
in fight:
How ere the wind do blow.
And when by Gods assistance,
Our foes are put to the foil,
To animate our courages,
We all have share o'th spoil,
Our foes into the Ocean,
We back to back do throw,
to sink,
or swim,
How ere the wind does blow.
The Second part.
To the same tune.


THus we gallant seamen,
In midst of greatest dangers,
Do always prove our valor,
We never are no changers:
But what so ere betide us,
We stoutly undergo,
resolved,
resolved,
How ere the wind does blow.
If fortune do befriend us.
In what we take in hand,
We prove our selves still generous
When ere we come to land,
There Is few yt shall out brave us
Though near so great in show,
we spend
and lend,
How ere the wind does blow.
We travel to the Indies,
From them we bring some spice
Here we buy rich Merchandise
At very little prize;
And many wealthy prises,
We conquer from the foe:
In fight:
In fight,
How ere the wind does blow.
Into our native Country,
With wealth we do return:
And cheer our wives and children,
Who for our absence mourn.
Then do we bravely flourish,
And where so ere we go:
We roar:
We roar:
How ere the wind does blow.
For when we have received*
Our wages for our pains:
The Uintners and the Tapsters*
By us have golden gains.
We call for liquor roundly,
And pay before we go:
and sing:
and drink,
How ere the wind does blow.
We bravely are respected,
When we walk up and down,
For if we meet good company,
We care not for a crown,
There Is none more free then saylrrs
Where ere he come or go,
th'elle roar
o'th shore,
How ere the wind^ does blow.
Then who would live in England
And norish vice with ease,
When he that is in poverty,
May riches get o'th seas:
Lets sail unto the Indies,
Where golden grass does grow
to sea,
to sea,
How ere the wind does blow.
