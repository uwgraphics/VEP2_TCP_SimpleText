A Judicious and painful EXPOSITION upon the ten Commandments; Wherein the
Text is opened, Questions and Doubts are resolved, Errors confuted, and sundry
Instructions effectually applied. First delivered in several Sermons, and now
published to the glory of God, and for the further benefit of his Church. By
PETER BARKER, Preacher of Gods Word, at Stowre Pain, in Dorsetshire.

Psalm. 19. 7. The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the
testimony of the Lord is sure, and gives wisdom unto the simple. Esaias. 8. 10.
To the Law and to the Testimony. Printed at London for Roger Iackson, and are
to be sold at his shop near the great Conduit in Fleet Street, 1624.

To the Right worshipful the Deane and Canons of the Cathedral Church of
Sarum, his very good Patrons.
RIght Worshipful, when contrary to my custom, I had penned these Sermons, I
could not at first determine whether If I should smother them in my deske, or
send them out into the common light: I should let them perish as soon as they
were brought forth, happily some would endite me of closenes; If I should
suffer the world to take a view of them, others would condemn me for
profusion; especially seeing that this age being furnished with Books even to
satietie and surfeit, may say of the Priests, as Bezaleel of the people; The
people bring too much, and more then enough for the use of the Tabernacle, Ex.
36. 5. But while I was thus musing, at last I resolved rather to press then to
suppress them, and now they lay open to all censures: If your Worships shall
think I sound from my emptines, yet blame me no more then you will the full
handed, which commonly are most sparing: herein mine own heart sometime
endited a good matter, then with the spider did I weaue my web out of my own
breast: at other times my tongue was the pen of other Writers; then with the
Be did I gather honey out of the flowers, yet so as with the Dog at the River
Nilus I never did but touch and go, lap, and away, and being desirous to be
rather Scriptor then Exscriptor, a water-spring then a leaden spout, did in
gleaning commonly, make others mine own for form by many alterations. If your
Worsh^ps shall mark these my poor pains with your stars, you shall encourage
me the second time to put pen to paper; but if with your spits, your dislike
shall drive me to a non plus, my second Sermons shall never stand in white
sheets, and so referring my self and my labor to your charitable censures: I
rest

your Worships in all duty and true affection P. Barker.

THE PREFACE upon the ten Commandments.
IN the first age of the world from Adam to Moses, men had no other guide to
conduct them for the carriage of their lives, then the Law of Nature, which
Saint Paul calls Romans 2. 1^
a Law written in the heart, and others ius gentium the law of nations, because
all Nations had some glimpse of knowledge by it: but great things are not seen
in the dark, nor little things in the common light, but in the sun beams the
least mote may be discerned, so in the darkness of nature great sins were
little seen, and therefore the heathen thought simple fornication to be no
sin, but this the literal sense of the Law condemned. But the motions of the
heart are discerned by the Law spiritually understood, and therefore men being
as young scholars, which cannot frame their letters without a Copy, God gave
them a Law written as a mould wherein to cast all their thoughts a touchstone
whereby to try all their words, the Beam of the Sanctuary, whereupon all their
actions should be balanced, all their works weighed, a written warrant
without which a good man dare do nothing, and with which what dare he not?
This is the Moral Law contained in the ten Commandments, unto which this is
the Preface, like the forefront of the Sanctuary like the sound of a trumpet
before some weighty proclamation, a forerunner of the law, as John of the
Gospel with letters of commendation.

Exodus 20. 1. God spoke all these words and said, I am the Lord thy God which
brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

Wherein consider. 1. The Lawgiuer: God spoke all these words. 2. His natural
properties 1. his greatness, I am the Lord. 2. his goodness set out 1.
generally thy God. 2. specially in having a regard 1. of their souls in
drawing them out of a place subject to superstition 2. of their bodies in
bringing them from bondage.




GOd spoke these words: 1 In other parts of the Bible God used other men's
mouths, Luc. 1. 70
he spoke by the mouth of his holy Prophets, and 2 Pet. 1. 21
holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the holy Ghost: 2 he used other
men's pens, there were Scribes which were the pens of Gods own finger, as there
were (...) so (...), 2 Chr. 24 11.
men's Scribs called Notaries, Ier. 36. 10
Secretaries, 2 Reg. 18. 18.
Recorders, and Ier. 8. 8.
Gods Scribes whose office was to write the words of the Lord and to expound
it; but in delivering this law, God spoke himself. The Decalogue was the
immediate word of his own mouth, he did Ex. 31. 18
write himself, he made his own pen public Notary of his tongue, his own
finger was the pen, so that we may say as the Inchaunters of Egypt in another
case, Ex. 8. 19.
Digitus Dei est hic, this is the finger of God.

This double dignity in speaking and writing, which the law has above other
scripture, teaches us to lend a most attentiu^ ear unto it.

The holy Ghost commends unto us some scriptures as more excellent then other,
in respect of our use or several necessities, by remarkable notes, either in
the beginning of the speech, as Mat. 1. 23
behold, which mark of attention is as the ringing of a Bell before the
sermon, or in the end of the speech as Ps. 3. 2. ^
Selah, which is a postcript, and teaches us to look back and in this case
to be like Genesis 19. 26.
Lots wife, who turned back and looked behind her.

Sometime the holy Ghost writes more artificially then at other times as Psalm.
111. 112. 119.
some psalms, and the Lamentations of Jeremy are written in an Alphabeticall
order to note their dignity, and help the memory.

Sometime the holy Ghost gives some scripture a name above other names, as
David calls the 120 Psalm and 14 Psalms following, songs of Degrees, not
for that the Levites did raise the tune in singing those Psalms, for these and
other Psalms had the like tune, nor yet because they were sung on the stayers
of the temple, for Solomon built the temple after those Psalms were styled by
that name, but because (as a learned writer of our time has well observed)
they were excellent Psalms of a higher degree, and more special use.

But neither note, nor name, nor any thing else can commend unto us any
especial scripture, whereby to move attention so much as this which is
superlatiue to them all, God delivered the law with his own mouth, God did
write it with his own finger, so that he might say for the one as Joseph to
his brethren; Ge^. 45. 12
Behold, your eyes do see that mine own mouth speaks to you: and for the
other, as Paul to Philemon, Philem. 19
I have written this with mine own hand.

2. God is a Judge, his Law is a Charge, and when the Judge does give the
Charge, every man is ready to harken to it.

3. There is an interchangeable speech betwixt God and us, we speak unto God
in prayer and thanksgiving, he speaks to us, by the audible sound of his
word, or secret voice of his Spirit; we cry unto God that he would hear us,
that our prayers may go up, and his mercy may come down, that God and our
prayers may meet together in heaven, Ioh. 4. 7.
as Christ and the woman at Jacobs well, and God interchangeably cries to us
that we would hear him: the voice that descended from heaven gave nothing else
in charge but this: Mat. 17. 5.
hear him: as though other duties were comprised in hearing, and Christ speak
of hearing, when he told Martha, Luc. 10. 32.
one thing was necessary, as though other necessities were to give place unto
it. Pro. i. 24. 28.
He that stops his ears when God speaks, shall speak himself and not be
heard.

Therefore be not like hounds, which have their ears hanging toward the
earth, by reason whereof the sound and voice cannot so soon enter; much less
be like the deaf adder, Psalm. 58. 4
which stops her ears, but be like the little birds which peirk up their
heads when the dam does bring them meat, and be ready to say with Samuel when
God speaks, 1 Samuel 3. 10.
speak Lord thy servant hears.

Secondly God speaks. Therefore wash away the dregs of sin before you come
to hear, as the adder slips of her skin as the Eagle casts her bill, as blind
Bartimeus the legger threw y Mar. 10. 50.
away his cloak before he came unto Christ.

Es. 55. 1.
Come to the waters and drink, but be like the Serpent, who when he comes to
drink, first spues up his poison.

Gods law is pure, and will ask pure and clean vessels wherein to keep it;
it is new wine, and will not be put into old stinking bottels: Ps. 119. 105.
Gods word is a Lantern and light, sin is a curtain drawn over the heart,
which hides and eclipseth the light from shining unto you, and therefore first
Iam. 1. 27.
lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of maliciousness, and then receive
with meekness the word that is graffed in you which is able to save your
souls.

Thirdly, God speaks: therefore hear with reverence.

If a Proclamation come from the King, we uncover our heads to harken to it:
when Iud. 3. 20.
Ehud told Eglon, he had a message from God, he arose from his throne: Deu. 31.
26.
The Arc wherein the law was put Ex. 25. 11 14.
was within and without ouerlaid with pure gold. It was carried upon bars
that the Levites might not touch it, that so the majesty and dignity might
breed in the people reverence: when the Arc came from the Philistims, the
Bethlemites received it with great gladness, but using it with little
reverence, 1 Samuel 6, 19.
it caused the destruction of many.

It was not given in charge to the Elders of Israel to teach the people as it
was to the Levites, yet when the law was delivered to the sons of Leui, Deu.
31. 9
it was also delivered to the Elders, and they were joined as assistants with
them, that it might be the more reverently regarded of the people.

If we hear the law as Sarah did the message of the Angel, Ge^. 18. 12
who laughed when she heard it, or as Pharaoh did the message sent unto him
from God concerning the deliverance of Israel, Ex. 5. 2.
who blasphemed when he had heard it, or as Iehoiakim did the roll which
Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremy, ^er. 36. 23
who cut it in pieces with a penne-knife, and burnt it when he had heard it,
if we can dispute and talk of it as though our tongues did run upon
pattens, if we cast it behind us Ps. 50. 17.
as the ungodly in the fiftieth Psalm, then the excessive reverence of the
Jews shall condemn our defect, who at this day hear and read, keep and use
the law of God with all reverence, they never lay any other book upon the
Bible; they wash their hands before they touch it, they will not sit upon the
bench where it lies, as often as they open or shut it, they use to kiss it.

Fourthly, God speaks therefore believe.

That men might get credit to their laws they were reported to be inspired by
the Gods at Rome, at Athens and other places, the Heathen gods were lying gods
and dying gods, but God who gave this law is truth and life, and his law like
himself, vera est, viua est, sana est, plana est, what he speaks passes by
indenture, by covenant, by oath, before good witnesses, signed with the finger
of the holy Ghost, and sealed with the blood of the Son.

2. If inferior persons speak they persuade by reason, knowing they have no
authority to give them credit: Ex. 4. 1.
They will not believe me (says Moses) they will say the Lord has not
appeared unto thee, therefore the Lord tells him, he shall have a testimonial,
he shall have evidence to show, the miracles which he works shall prove his
commission: but Kings and Princes of their mere authority look to be
believed, here God speaks 1 Timothy 6. 15.
who is King of Kings, take the word of a King for it.

3. Ipse dixit, among Pythagoras scholars went current, if their master said
it, it was enough, they set up their rest, and shall not we that are scholars
of Christ, give the like credit to our master in heaven? Believe when he says
he will visit, believe when he says he will show mercy. Neither does the
Angel use any other argument to confirm the women in the resurrection then
this, Mat. 28. 7
Lo I have told you.

Lastly, God speaks. The law is his word, and therefore it must not go in at
one ear, and out at another, it must not be as music, which once ended there
is no more remembrance of it, or as untimely fruit, which perishes as soon as
it is brought forth: if it were of no reckoning, it were no matter, if it went
as it came, if it were of little moment, it were no matter though it went no
further then the outward ear, then the porters lodge; but it is purer then
gold, yea then much fine gold, Mat. 13. 46.
it is a precious pearl, and therefore must be kept under lock and key in the
closet of the heart, Col. 3. 16
it must dwell in us, we must be like Jacob; Ge^. 37. 11
who noted the saying, and like Mary, Luc. 2. 51
who kept all the sayings in her heart. If we can say as Job in another case,
Job 16. 2.
We have often heard such a thing, and do not incorporate it, and keep it in
us, we shall receive the same check which the Jews did, Io. 5. 38.
His word have ye not abiding in you.

God spoke all these words. When God would bless the people which kept his
law, and curse the disobedient, Deuteronomy. 27. 12. etc.
six Tribes should stand upon mount Gerizhim to bless, and six upon mount
Eball to curse, and the people should not be left out, for they should answer
and say, So be it: In setting down the Articles of our faith, it has been
held as a tradition that Peter began, and afterward every Apostle added his
Article, and therefore called the Apostles Creed, but in delivering the Law,
God was not one of six, nor one of twelve, he had no copertner but spoke all
himself as, Iams 2 11
He that said thou shall not commit adultry, said also, thou shall not kill,
and so of the rest.

If God spoke all, then we must hear all, obey all. The Jews could be content
to hear Steven, till he touched the disease; Noli me tangere, Act 7. 54
but then they gnashed at him with their teeth: to hear Paul, till he
delivered words which stood not with their liking, then they said, Act. 2. 22
Away with such a fellow from the earth, for it is not meet that he should
live. The blasphemer who arms himself to strike the Lord with some deadly
wound can happily be content to hear the first, to hear the second
commandment, but if God will speak further, he shall have better leave to
hold his peace, if he will write further in the first table, he will be ready
to cry manum de tabula, harp no more on that string, untoothsome is that
truth, which treads down his own likings. The Adulterer waits for the
twilight, and commonly faulteth in the dark, and because the seventh
commandment does light him a candle, he does not willingly give it the
hearing: and so of the rest, if any one commandment does cross the paths of
our special delights, would wrest us in tune, would call the eye of the soul
home to it self, and make us see a glimpse of that we would not, we can no
more away with it, then the owl can with the sunshine, or then the frantic
man can with him that binds him: Heb. 11. 25.
Sin it self is sweet, but the check of sin is bitter, and no commandment
gracious that is a censure of that iniquity we delight in, but God that
speaks all bids us Deu 12. 28.
hear all.

Secondly: God spoke all, therefore we must obey all.

The breach of one commandment is enough to stanch the blood of the dying
Lord: he that is hurt may as well die of one mortal wound as of an hundred:
the least forfeit forfeiteth the whole lease, the least leaking may drown the
ship, and Mat. 5. 19
he that shall break one of these least commandments and teach men so, he
shall be called the least in the Kingdom of heaven.

This meets with those which can be content to abandon many sins, to observe
some commandments, but they have a beloved sin, and for that they will
dispense with themselves, it is their darling and shall live and die with them:
Mar. 6. 20
Herod had many good motions, he feared John, knowing that he was a just man
and an holy and reverenced him, and when he heard him, he did many things and
heard him gladly, but he will not leave his brother Philips wife, say he what
he will, in that he will not dance after John Baptists pipe, but rather give
John's head to the dancing damsel, whordome is his delight, and he will have a
gappe for his incest.

2 King. 5. 17. 18.
Naaman protests that he will do service to no other God save to the Lord:
but yet he must needs be present at the service of Idols, and herein the Lord
be merciful unto thy servant, who carries an upright soul in a prostrate
body: but what is this, but as if the wife should say unto her husband, husband
you shall have my heart, but I pray bear with me, if you take my body in bed
with another man.

The Israelites destroyed the Citizens of Hay, but fa^ed g Josh. 8. 23
the King alive, we can be content to stay many sins, to nip them on the head,
and as if we had marshall law in our hand, when we see them condemned,
presently proceed to execution, but we save the King alive and favor some
principal sin in our selves. The whoremonger says, forgive me the sweet sin
of lasciviousness, if I come into the sin of vsery, God then spears me not:
but this is to be like Benhadad who recouers of h 2 King. 8. 10.
one disease, and presently dies of another.

The cunning fisher uses not one bait for all fishes, nor always the same
bait for the same fish, but as he sees the fish will bite so he baits his
hook, so Satan tempts not all men to one sin, nor always the same man to
the same sin, but applies himself every way, as he sees every man given
either by inclination of nature or condition of life, Some bite at pleasures,
and he takes them with the i daughters of Moab, Nu^. 25. 1.
other gape at riches, and to catch them he baits his hook Luke 14. 18. 19.
with a Farm or with Oxen, 2 King. 5. 22.
or a talent of silver, other post for preferment as fast as Iehu hasted forth
his chariot, 2 King. 9 20.
he dro^e as if he had been mad: and if they may climb up to honor they care
not though they climb, ^ Sam. 14
as Jonathan and his armor bearer did to the Garrison of the Philistines by the
raggedness of the ro^kes, he shows to these some honorable place that is
void, so he took Siluester the second, he by the devils help got to be Pope
on this condition, that after his death he should be his: Satan has the length
of every man's foot, and then he fits him, thus uncleanness is the sin of
one man, covetousness of another, ambition of a third, these they favor, but
God who spoke all these words, forbids all sins against his words, and
therefore all must be eschewed, and Saint Paul will have us take a purgation
which may rid us of all sin, 1 Cor. 5. 7
purge out the old leaven, and make us cast up all corruption, as Christ when
he cast out one devil cast out all, Luc. 8. 33
even a whole legion together.

Indeed Princes upon special occasions dispense with some of their subjects
for penal statutes, as for example, fish-daies are commanded to be observed by
a Statute 2. Ed. 6. 19. 5 Eliz. 5. under a sub pana, that the Tribe of Zabulon,
Ge^. 49. ^^
which dwells by the Sea side might have maintenance, Neh 13. 16.
that Tyrus and such as live upon navigations might have utterance for their
commodities, that there may be maintenance of store, for Number. 11. 21. 22.
what abundance of flesh will a multitude consume in one month, that God* Genesis
1:
who created the fishes of the sea, and Genesis 9. 2
gave man an interest therein, Ps. 10^. 25.
might have praises as well for sea as land, but yet all persons which by
notorious sickness shall be enforced for the recovery of their health to eat
flesh for the time of their sickness, shall have a license to eat flesh upon
the days forbidden, but God who spoke all these words, binds us all to all in
general, binds us all to all in particular.

Therefore the Pope is to blame two ways, 1. In leaving out one commandment,
2. In dispensing with other, and as the Papists when they put in print Origens
work upon John, left quite out the sixth Chapter, for fear it should reprove
their error touching the communion, so do they omit in their prayer books,
and catechismes the second commandment, because it is sharp and rips the
heart-string of the Church of Rome, and to fill up the number of ten, they
divide the tenth into two, and this has been an usual custume among them, if
they meet with any thing, that thwarts the grounds of Popery, they labor with
some cunning gloss, as with a wrest to make it tune to the key thereof, if the
gloss will not help (which many times is viperina, and eats out the bowels of
the text) if no shift of Descant will serve the turn, then with the dash of a
pen as with a sponge they blot it out clean, and cut the knot which they
cannot untie: thus in keeping back part, Act. 5. 2.
as Ananias and Saphira, they are pickers of their masters treasure, and very
thieves, which suppress the marks whereby they may be known, least they
should be taken, like the devil in the Gospel, who when he tempts Christ,
presumption comes like a divine, and brings the Psalter with him, but in
alleging the psalm, he as subtle as the Cranes, who flying over the hill
Taurus which is full of Eagles, carry stones in their mouths, least their voice
bewray them, concealeth these words; they shall keep thee in all thy ways,
because they z Ps. 91. 11.
made against him, the ways to which he tempted, being none of Christ's ways,
and like the painter which Plutarch speaks of, who when he had drawn a hen
in very badde proportion, chased away the living hens from his shop window,
lest his evil workmanship should be perceived, but it fares with them as it
did with the painter in Queen Mary's times, whom when he had painted King
Henry the eight in harness, with a sword in the one hand, and a book in the
other, whereupon was written verbum Dei, the Bishop of Winchester sent for him,
and after many reuiling words, commanded him to wipe out the book and verbum
Dei too, the painter because he would be sure to wipe out both clean, wiped
away a piece of the hand withal: and the Papists while they wipe out verbum
Dei, and take away what they please out of the word of God, have wiped out
their hand too, they cannot so much prevail with men, seeing their legerdemain, as otherwise they might, no by this and the like means not only their
arm is shortened 1 Samuel 2. 31.
like Elyes arm, but the very legs of their holy father the Pope are broken,
Io. 19. 32
like the legs of the thieves, which were crucified with Christ. King Henry the
eight broke his right leg of rents and revenues, whereas before that time his
legs were strong like the legs of the image in Nebuchadnezars dream, because
many patrimonies went down his throat, and by the foisted name of Peter's
patrimony, he devoured the natural inheritance of secular Princes, whereas
before that time his kitchen full of gridyrons and caldrons to broyle and boil
souls, was like an iron mill, which consumes all the wood in a country, and
all the floods in England did run into his sea. King Edward the sixth broke
his left leg, of Idolatrous service, when the temple was well purged, Images
burned, when many papists shipped over their trinkets, and packt away their
paltry; but our late Q. Elizabeth of famous memory crushed his head, Iud. 9. 53
like the woman who cast a piece of a millstone upon the head of Abimel^ch, and
brake his braine-pan.

Secondly, if God spoke all, and all must be obeyed, then is the Pope to blame
to dispense with the law, or any part of it, yet he allows of curtizans (who
pay tribute for license to be common whores, the Auditor of his Exchequer
excommunicating those, which keep not touch in bringing it in;) neither is
only fornication finable in Rome, and a good ^alable kind of sin, but very
incest it self, for the Pope permits the brother to marry his wne brothers
wife, and the uncle his sisters daughter.

Neither dispenses he with the breach of the seventh Commandment alone, but
if he be displeaseed with the King, as he was with King John, then against
the fifth Commandment he assoileth Earls, Barons, Knights, and all other
manner of men of their homages, services, and fealties that they should do
unto him, commanding under pain of his great cuise, that no man should obey
him, keep him company, eat or drink or talk with him, forbidding his own
household to do him any kind of service, either at bed, or at board, in Church,
hall, or stable: But what need I speak of this or that particular
Commandment, when the Canonists say, he may dispense with the laws of God and
sins of men, that he may dispense against the law of God, aagainst the law
of Nature, against Saint Paul the Apostle, against the old, against the new,
against all the Commandments of the old and new Testament: May I not say unto
him as Moses to Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, Nu^. 16. 7
ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Leui. But I proceed being indeed more
desirous to lead men in the road way, then to show them the turnings, or point
at them that wander out of the way.

I am the Lord thy God: Judge. 14. 14.
In Sampsons riddle, out of the strong came sweetness, honey out of the Lions
belly, here is a medely of the name according to Sampsons riddle, both of
strong and sweet: the Lord, see how strong God is: thy God; taste and see how
sweet the Lord is: he is fort^er suauis, and suauiter fortis, there is a sweet
intercourse of both, that both the one and the other might win obedience to
the law.

I am the Lord: God has a Lordship in heaven, where he has good servants; in
hell where he has bad, in earth where he has both: he is not a God of
heaven alone, as the Poets feined Jupiter, not of hell alone, as they fained
Pluto, nor of earth alone, as 1 King. 20 23.
the Aramites spoke, as though there were gods of the mountains, and gods of
the valleys, but of all.

The Pope, though he has but some angle, not all the corners of the earth,
though he is but as a fox in a hole, yet the Papists say as much of him, as
God says here of himself: his discreet Doctors say, he is potestate maximus,
bonitate optimus, which Epithites in former times were proper to God, who was
called, Deus Optimus Maximus. Others say, he is not wholly God, nor wholly man,
and this was true in Pope Ioane, they speak righter then they are aware, for
she was a woman: but a Canonist says plainly, onr Lord God the Pope, and the
Pope (as Bishop Jewel reports) was content to suffer one of his parasites to
say unto him in the late Counsel of Lateran, Thou art another God on earth,
and he wears a triple crown, either because he would usurp the
Antichristian power over the three divisions of the world, Europe, Asia, and
Affricke; or else for that he would be a Lord of heaven, where he may Canonize
Saints of hell, where he may free souls out of Purgatory, of the earth, where
he may bind and loose, set up and put down at his pleasure, and because
happily you will not believe their own bare words, you shall hear how they
bring scripture for it, Ps. 8. 6.
he has put all things in subjection under his feet, the beasts of the
field.i. men living on the earth, the fishes in the sea.i. souls in Purgatory,
the fowls of the air.i. the souls of the blessed, risum teneatis? this would
make Heraclitus himself, who always wept to fall a laughing, it were present
remedy against all his tears.

But in earnest, if the Pope cannot do this, why do they attribute so much
unto him: if he can, what can God do more? he can say no more in general
terms to show his power and dominion, to show his mercy and goodness then
this, I am the Lord thy God.

A Lord whose title is alike to all places, and therefore inordinate quarunt
Io. 8. 19.
vbi est, quia vbique est, the Pharisees should not ask where he is? but where
is he not? he is a circle whose center is no where, and circumference every
where; he fills all things, not that they contain him, but rather that he
contains them; he is whole in all things, and all things in him, and as he
bears up heaven and earth, and yet is not burdened, so he fills heaven and
earth, and yet is not enclosed. Heaven is his chamber of presence, there he is
by glory, the heart of his elect is his preuy chamber, there he is by grace,
and though he be far off from the thoughts of the wicked, yet is he not away,
for where he is absent by grace, there is he present by vengeance.

The argument then is this, I am the Lord, therefore you that are servants must
obey: Mat. 8. 8.
I say to my servant do this, and he does it: It is G^rrans observation. The
other Apostles call Christ Mat. 26. 22. 25.
Lord, because they meant to obey him, but Judas does not so, because he had
shaken off the yoke of obedience: they say (...), but he (...): howsoever it
come to pass that our Geneua translation in English make no difference in the
title.

Luc. 19. 3. 8.
Zacheus desired to see Jesus, because he needed a savior, by and by he called
him Lord, as though he were at his beck to do his will.

The whole order of nature is naught else then a proof of the obdience, which
all creatures both above and beneath yield unto the Lord, the Job 37. 12.
Rain, Wind, and Storms execute that he commands: Mat. 8. 27
The Sea obey him, when he stilleth the raging waves thereof, when he treads
upon it, as his freehold, Mat. 14. 25.
when it is so stiff, that he may walk upon it. Luc 5. 6. 7
The inhabitants of the sea obey him, when they come thick and threefold into
Simons net. The earth obey Ioh. 11. 43
him, when he bids Lazarus come forth. The heavens obey him, Act. 1. 9.
when it opens and receives him into glory. This is sufficient evidence to
condemn us, and shall set a gloss on our rebellion, if we which have sense,
wit, and reason, shall disobey, if the heart of our heart, and the inmost
concauity thereof, which is made to contain vital breath, be not filled up
with subjection to the will of the Lord, that we can say every one of us, thy
law is within my heart.

The Lord thy God: the Lord of all by right of possion, the Lord God by right
of ereation, but the Lord thy God O Israel by ^ight of special election, for
thou art separated from other Conntries as Es. 20. 6.

1 Pet. 2. 25.
God is a Bishop, and Mat 28. 19.
he gives his Apostles a commission to visit all other Diocesses of the world,
but Israel was a Peculiar, and this Luc. 1. 68
he visited in his own person, Deuteronomy. 7. 6
others were as the Commnos of the world, these as Gods own enclosure: Other
nations like wild beasts wandered among mountains, woods and deserts, these as
his own flock he received into his fold, Hos. 11. 3. 4.
He led Ephraim as one should bear them in his arms, he led them with
cords of a man even with bands of love: They which voluntarily come into any
Kings dominion, even by the common law of Nations are subjects to that King,

Jacob and his family go into Egypt, yet God gives them a privilege, calling
in Israel his son and Ex. 4. 22.

At the first, before the covenant God made with Abraham, one person was not
more respected then another, but as soon as it was said, Genesis 17. 7
I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed after thee, the Church was divided
from other nations, no otherwise then light was from darkness in the first
creation, but as in the time of Brutus (sic par^is componere magna solemus)
Britain was but one Monarchy, which after him was divided into three
Kingdoms, till our gracious King James pulled down the partition wall, and
joined not only Roses but Realms together; so the people of the world before
the covenant, being of one and the same condition, and all alike under one God,
were afterward divided into Jews and Gentiles, and one much more respected
then the other, till Christ the Prince of peace came, who breaking down the
wall of partition made, an union, made of Jews and Gentiles one people, so
that Ro^. 2. 29
he is not now a God of the Jews alone, but of the Gentiles also: and the
Greeks may as well say Christ, as the Hebrews Jesus: the one Ro^. 8. 15
(...), as well as the other Abba, and this, that God is our God, is the second
argument here used to allure us to obedience: Genesis 27. 12.
Jacob is afraid to abuse old Isaac, because he is his father: Ge^. 39. 8
Joseph will not consent to the inticements of his mistrisse, because Putifar
is his good master; and we must be afraid to offend, because we have a good
Father, a good Master, a good God: if we wander out of the way and go astray
from his Commandments, turning aside to the right hand, or to the left he may
justly challenge us, and say* I am thy God, thy God, why have thou forsaken me?

1 King. 12 ^.
The gray headed Counselors in Israel which had stood before Solomon while he
yet lived, told Rehoboam his son, If thou speak kind words unto this people
this day, they will be thy servants for ever: God speaks kind words unto us
this day, I am the Lord, I am thy God, and therefore we must not be servants
unto sin, but in a resolute detestation, whipping that bad merchant out of
the temple of our heart, be his servants for ever.

Which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt: Egypt was a land full of
superstition: it honored devils, it honored men, it honored beasts, it
honored plants, what thing was it, but it was to them a God? and therefore
this was a great favor of God to be delivered out of it: Nature has ingrafted
in every creature to love the place where it took birth and beginning: Ecc. 1.

Hadad lacks nothing with Pharaoh, yet in any case will go into his own
Country; but yet if Caldea the place of Abraham's nativity serves strange gods,
then the Lord says unto him, Ge^. 12. 1
Get thee out of thy Country, and from thy kindred, and from thy fathers house:
and Joshua Josh. 24 2
reckons this among the great blessings of God, that God brought him from
thence, and Genesis 11. 31.
Terah his father an old man, weak and broken, having no commandment from God
to go with his son, which might have seemed tolerable excuses, if he had
abode behind yet when he knows the place accursed for idolatry, from which his
sonmust depart, he bears him company, the contagion of spiritual diseases,
being as the lepers sore, dangerous to them that dwell near it, and therefore
the holy Ghost Ier. 51 6.
wishes us to go out of Babylon, and looking behind us, see whether we have
left it upon our backs: Be not separated from the company of good men, thou
may participate of their goodness, as an impe grafted into a stock
participates of the influence and virtue of the root, so that it withers not,
but waxes green and greater: if there be Moses and Elias good company, good
doctrine, good example, good report make choice of those places, and say with
Peter, Mat. 17. 4*
It is good to be here: but be not like the Swine, who had rather be
tumbling in the mire, then laid in the cleanest places, come not near stinking
carrion, except thou have the wind of it. But let us take a little further
view of this peoples idolatry, and then come to our selves.

The Egyptians were such as Saint Paul speaks of, Ro^. 1 23.
They 1 turned the glory of the incorruptible God, to the similitude of the
image of a corruptible man, and 2. of birds, and 3. foure-footed beasts, and 4.
of creeping things.

1 Of a corruptible man, they deified their King Axis.

2 Of birds, they worshipped the Hawke and Ebi^, for that he destroyed the
serpents which came out of Libia into Egypt, very hurtful to their Country.

3 Of foure-footed beasts, they worshipped an Ox, a Dog, a Cat, and a Swine,
for the invention of tillage, which he showed them, by rooting up the ground
with his groine.

4 Of creeping things, they worshipped the Crocodyll, and some Ichneumon, now
called a mouse of Indie, who kills the Crocodyll, for when the Crocodyll
gapeth, he creeps into his body, and eating his bowels, slaieth him: they had
so many gods, that a man had need to have made a Catalogue of them, as Vano did
of the Romish gods, for fear (as he said) they should stray away: It may be
this land had not the like variety of images, but that here were canonized many
new gods, both he Saints and she Saints, none can deny; men thought God could
not attend to so many things at once, and therefore several offices were
committed to several Saints, and they dealt out the virtues belonged to God:
Saint Cornelis was an excellent Saint to keep men from the falling sickness:
Saint Apolline as excellent to help men of the toothach, these were not so
good for men, but other were as good for beasts, as Saint Antony for Swine.

If men did hear that some blocke-idoll did sweat, did speak, did weep, did
smile, did shift it self from place to place, would not their bare feet carry
them thither with an offering? what repair was there to our Lady of Walsingam,
our Lady of Wilsdon, the same Lady but distinguished by the place, as Baal was
a common name to many Idols, but distinguished Number. 22. 41. and 25. 3.
by the high places and hills wherein it was worshipped: but did God bring us
out of this land when it was infected with superstition, surely he showed this
favor to many of our predecessors, who counted themselves happy, if while
those Mariana tempora continued, they might go to Geneua, to Strasbourg, and
other religious places, whereas many many, which kept their station, did stick
ad ignem inclusiue, the father with the son, the husband with the wife, the
mother with the newborn, no not borne infant, for in the I Will of Garnesye the
belly of Perotine Massey bursting asunder by vehemence of the flame, the child
with which she was great, fell into the fire, and eft soon being taken out by
one W. House, was again by the censure of the Provost and Bailiffe cast into
the fire, so that this child baptized in his own blood, both at once began and
ended a Martyr: but God has showed a far greater favor to us, then to those
which avoided the land, for many of them might say, as Paul of himself, Night
and day t 2 Cor. 11 25. 26. 27.
have I been in the deep sea: in iorneying often, in perils of waters, in
perils of robbers, in perils of mine own nation, in perils among the Gentiles,
in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in
perils among false brethren, in weariness and painfulnesse, in watching often,
in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

But we without this travail, without this trouble, without this danger are
freed from superstition: God has not brought us out of an idolatrous land, but
has taken idolatry out of the land, and we continuing still in our native
Country, he has cleansed it, having swept idolatry and superstition from it:
he cast that Dagon of Rome down to the ground, when in the days of King Henry
the eight, the Pope lost his supremacy, when that King would sit no longer, as
in the distinguishing at Paris, to pay the minstrels wages, when England, which
before that time was counted the Popes Ass, did now cast his rider: he cut off
his head and his hands, when in the days of King Edward the sixth, men might
not prostrate themselves before Saints several shrines, nor provoke God with
high places, nor sacrifice unto Baalim, and burn incense to images, but must
take away their fornications out of their sight, and their adulteries from
between their breasts: only the stumpe of Dagon is left (a few recusants
which our mighty King James by the help of God will sooner cast out, then it
shall recover it first wounds, and those disordered members, the Papists are
now but as parts of an adder cut asunder, which may retain some life for a
time, but never by the grace of God shall in this land grow into a body again:
Now if the Prophet Jeremy blames the Jews, for that they said not, Ier. 2. 6.
Where is the Lord that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, much more will
he condemn our silence, if we do not open our lips and show forth the praises
of God, who has taken the superstition of Egypt out of our land.

If this was a blessing of God upon Israel, to be brought out of Egypt,
because there the Egyptians entitle ^ creatures to the honor of the creator,
and gave God for companions not men alone, but fowls of the air, and beasts
of the field; they then are much to be blamed, who being bred and borne, and
brought up in that Country void of idolatry, in a Country which burn their
images with fire, overthrow their altars, cut down their groves, pluck down
their high places, and beaking in pieces the Calfe of Samaria will make no
mention of it with there lips, yet leaving this their country, convey themselves
into Egypt, into places which bringing in Idols put God and his truth out of
doors, who with a wicked eye hasting to riches, and coveting an evil
covetousness, and being desirous to load themselves with thick clay, or upon
a discontented humor, or to get them a name contrary to the commandment of
God, Amos 5. 5.
seek Bethell, when it is Bethauen, enter into Gilgall, and go to Beersheba.

Ioh. 4. 9.
The Jews would not meddle with the Samaritaus, and this law among them was
like the decree of the Persian King that altered not, He that eats a Samaritans
bread, be as he that eats swines flesh: and on the otherside, the Samaritans
would not converse with the Jews, no if one of them had but touched a Jew, he
would have thoughi himself the worse, till he had thrown himself into the
water clothes and all: The clean and the leprous will not dwell together, nor
the tame beasts keep with the wild. What shall we say then of such, as being*
separated from idolatrous wine, will seek to join themselves unto her again.
when God is not served and worshipped aright, they forget what Paul taught
Tim^^^ first by precept; ^ Tim. 6. 5
from such separate thy self: and then by (...) when Act. 19. 8. 9.
he departed from Ephesus, after the way of God (...) spoken off before the
multitude: Heb. 11. 24.
Moses left Pharaohs Court, and had rather wander in the wilderness, then be
^^conciled to superstitious Egypt then fall again, what shall we say of such
as being separated from idolaters, will seek to join themselves to them? Paul
says, 1 Cor. 1^ 14.
Fly from idolatry: then how are they to blame that fly to it, to places full
of it, Which seat themselves there, and seeing their gains come in, set their
hearts at rest, and say this is my rest, here will I dwell, I have a delight in
it: to be short, if thou now make thy abode in Idolatrous Egypt, which is
stained with it own works, and goes a whoring whit it own inventions, which
boweth it knees unto Baall, and kisseth him with it mouth, say not as Peter of
an other place, Mat. 17. 4.
it is good to be here, but Mat. 9. 5.
arise and walk: as Christ says to the palsy man, and think thou hear
the voice of the Lord speaking to thee, as the Bridegroom to the Spouse, Chron.
2 10. 13.
Arise my love, my fair one and come thy way: if thou art come out of Egypt,
out of a place where thy fathers worshipped strange gods, say not with Hobab,
Number. 10. 30.
I will again to my Country and my kindred: but think thou hear the vioce
of the Lord speaking to thee as Solomon to Pharaohs daughter, Forget thine own
people, and thy fathers house: say not with the Israelites, when they are i Ps.
45. 10.
come to the borders of Caanan, Number. 14 4.
we will return again into Egypt: but say with Ephraim. Hos. 14. 9
what have we to do any more with Idols? Be not like Orphah who being in her
way to Bethlehem, Ru. 1. 15
goes back again to her gods, nor like the ships, Ps. 107. 26.
which go up to the heaven, and down agoine to the deep, nor like swine, 1
Pet. 2. 22.
which being washed turn again to the muddle and to the mire.

Out of the house of bondage: Nimrod was a tyrannical oppressor, an oppressing
tyrant, his cruelty was such, that (as hated both of God and man) it grew into
a proverb, Ge^. 10. 9.
Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord: hunting has snares and nets, and
death at the last, but

-- Gaudeto Nimrod, vincit te crimine Pharaoh.

Pharaoh thou have not walked after Nimrods ways, nor done after his his
oppression, but as though his hunting had been a very little thing, ^^ou have
been more cruel then he, his cruelty was not heard off in the day of thy
oppression, he has not used half thy tyranny, but thou have exceeded him,
justified him, comforted him, and made his cruelty mercy; but when God di^^ee,
that Israel his first borne was calamitatis fabula, infalicitatis tabula, that
it could not breath from it first cross in body, but it must feel a worse in
loss of children, the cruel commands did come from the King like Jobs
messengers, Job 1.
no sooner one had told his tale, but another stepped in, Ps. 42. 7.
as one departs, calls another, then Hos. 11. 1.
out of Egypt God called his son, Ps. 105. 26.
then sent he Moses his servant to be a deliverer, to bring Israel out of
Egypt, Deu. 4. 20.
out of the iron furnace, out of miserable slavery, out of the house of
bondage, Ps. 81. 6.
then did God withdraw his shoulder from the burden, and his hand did leave
the pots, so that the Israelites might say of their former miseries, Ioh. 8.
as the Adultresse of her accusers, they are all gone: The Doctrins are two.

1. Many cloudy days go over the heads of the godly, and Job 22. 11.
abundance of waters cover them.

2. Ps. 3. 3.
God is the lifter up of their heads, and 2 Samuel 22 17.
draws them out of many waters.

God ioynes these two together; Deuteronomy. 32. 39.
I kill and give life: I wound, and I make whole: so does Hannah in her song,
1 Samuel 2. 6
the Lord kills and makes alive, brings down to the grave, and raises
up: and Eliphaz in his reproof, Job. 5. 18. 19.
he makes the wound, and binds it up: he smites, and his hands make whole,
he shall deliver thee in six troubles, and in the seventh the evil shall not
touch thee.

In the first Gods hand is heavy, in the second his mercy is plentiful: In the
first the sun is shadowed with clouds, in the second it shines out bright: in
the first Es. 8. 17.
God turns his back upon Israel, and hides his face from the house of
Jacob, in the second he Ex. 2. 25.
looks upon the children of Israel, and has respect unto them: In the first
Ps. 10. 1.
God stands far off, in the second Phil. 4. 5.
the Lord is even at hand.

But lest I should seem with Abraham Ge^. 18. 1
to sit still in the tent door, give me leave to go a little further into the
house of bondage and make privy search what I can find by the going in, by the
going out of Israel.

God brought Israel into the iron furnace, to show that Job 23 10.
the righteous must pass through afflictions, as gold passes through the fire.

Gods children are as 1 Pet. 2. 5.
lively stones to make a spiritual house, and therefore must be hewed, must be
beaten, must be polished, as were 1 King. 6 7.
the stones that served for Salomons temple, at the Quarries side. Mat. 8. 27
The ship whereinto Christ entered with his disciples was so tossed with wind
and waves, as if it would have been overwhelmed.

The fruitful tree is beaten, whereas we meddle not with that, which being
fruitless is reserved for the fire: Christ began to us of a most bitter cup,
but he did not drink it off, for he said, Mat. 26. 39.
Let this cup pass, they that are his, must pledge him of it: it was the
saying of a good martyr, when we learned A. B. C. our lesson was Christ's
Cross, the Cross is the worke-house in which God frames his servants like to
his son: Gods children are as well called 2 Timothy 2. 3.
soldiers to show what they must suffer as Mat. 20. 8
laborers to show what they must do.

We are to God as the aple of his eye, no part of man more tender then the
eye, yet when it is sore or dim we put sharp pouders or waters in it, to
eat ont the web, pearl or blindness of it: nay there is no greater
temptation, then not to be tempted, no sharper whippe, then not to be
scourged of God: Ezec. 16. 24.
I will cease and be no more angry says the Lord; God is then most angry
(says Bernard) when he is not angry, this pity is beyond all wrath: There
are two punishments of God upon Israel, because they went a whoring from under
their God: Hos. 4. 13. 14.
the first punishment is sin by sin, when God turns malum culpa into malum
poenae, your daughters shall be harlots, and your spouses shall be whores. The
second punishment is want of punishment, and this is a greater then that, I
will not visit your daughters when they are harlots, nor your spouses when they
are whores: The vine waxes wild, if it be never cut, the sea would be
infected and stincke if it were not troubled with the winds: the cross is a
fire to consume the refuse metal, a file to take away the rust of the soul, a
purgation to expel corrupt humors, a rod which falling upon stony hearts
causes them to bring forth tears, Number. 20. 11.
as the waters gushed out when Moses with his rod smote the stony rock: Job
16. 15. 16.
when God rayned Job with a rough byt, he stooped under his hand and uttered
signs of repentance.

The use of this doctrine is manifold: First in respect of the agent, it
abateth the edge of every cross to consider, it comes from the hand of God,
the child is content to bear with his father who brings him up, though he be
rough to him, though he visit his offenses with the rod and his sin which
scourges: God is our father y and brings us up as children, if he nurtureth us,
Deu 8. 5
as a father nurtureth his son, as it is in Deutronomy, and 2 Samuel 7. 14.
chastneth us with the rod of men, as it is in Samuel, this consideration
does relish the grief, Ex. 15. 25
as the tree cast into the spring seasoned the bitterness of the waters it is
my father let him do what seemed him good.

The Ox is without understanding, yet knows his owner, c Esa. 1. 3.
and holds down his horns, and boweth his neck to bear the yoke that he
does put upon him. If a strainger strike the savage beasts, they tear him in
pieces, but if their keeper smite them, they grudge not, Job 7. 20 and Genesis 28
15.
God is the keeper of men, this is armor of proof, and will ward the blow of
every repining thought, and breaking the stroke of every cross, will save the
heart, when the body suffers to consider, my Keeper smites me. God is a
physician, and knows what is better for us then we for our selves, nothing
displeases the patient that pleases the Physician.

Blows of our equals we hardly digest, but will secke to put in practice,
whatsoever desire of revenge does put into our heads, but we never storm at a
blow from a Prince, God is a Prince, a King of Kings, if he strikes, this does
moderate the stroke, and must make us encounter the grief with strength of
resolution.

Again in respect of the patients: Afflictions must not make us think, God
loves us the less, when we see his first born and best beloved in greatest
calamity.

God made Job a byword of the people, that is so afflicted him, that all the
world talked of him, and therefore he speaks of astonishment, Job 17. 6. 8.
righteous shall be astonished at this, as if they did imagine, God had turned his
back, and respected not his children, that he would not think on worldly
things, or pass how men lived, but he concludes, the righteous will hold
their way, and consider that God in his wisdom does punish both the good and
the bad, and in very deed there could be no show of patience, if God did still
grant his servants a patent of exemption and a privilege, and always suspend
the effects from their causes (for if they have not open, yet at lest they have
secret sins) and stay the streams of waters, that they should never cover
them: what victory can there be where there is no fight? what grace can be
given to overcome, where there is no temptation of the flesh? and what
patience, where there never is cross? besides, how could it be known that
God delivers his children out of troubles, as he does here out of bondage, if
they never were in them? how should they know what it were to call upon God,
and to feel his goodness toward them? therefore he punishes both, though
he smites the wicked with his fist, the godly with the palm of his hand,
though he Esa. 30. 28.
fanneth those wtih the fan of vanity to drive them to nothing, Mat 3. 12
these with his wheat fan to cleanse them, though his punishments be Ex. 11.
1.
plagues, Genesis 4. 11
curses, and destructions upon the one, Ps. 89. 32
corrections, chastisements and rods on the other.

An other use is this, let no man at any time so fix his mind upon his
prosperous estate, as to resolute himself, it shall never change for the
sunne-shined bright upon Jacob Genesis 47.
when he with his family came into Egypt, when his posterity were multiplied
and were exceeding mighty, but it waxed dim when Ex. 1. 7. 8. 9.
a King arose that knew not Joseph: the sea at full tide ebbed, the calm
continued not long without a storm, and all the sails hoised gave vantage to
a tempest, therefore the heathen painted fortune with feet and wings because
she comes running and goes flying. Job said Job. 29. 18.
I shall die in my nest, not dreaming of any trouble: and David in his
prosperity said, Ps. 30. 6.
I shall never be moved: but both these reckoned without their host, and
therefore might reckon twice, God did hide his face and they were both
troubled; if God deals thus with those that are his, what may either the
better sort promise to themselves, or the evil not fear? he that is mounted
on high knows not how soon he may fall from the top to the foot of the
hill: Est. 7. 10
Haman at least was as high on his own gallows, as at first he was high in the
Kings favor.

Daniel is no sooner made Ruler over the Governors, but by virtue of an Act
made against him, Deu. 6. 16
he is cast into the Lions den: Joseph from the degree of honor which he had
in Egypt, is Genesis 39. 20.
taken and cast into prison, and that without bail or mainprise, ( Ps. 105. 18.
for they held his feet in the flocks, and he was lai^ inyrons) with an
intent, that from thence he might be drawn unto death: and for the womankind
she that is now N^^mi, upon sudden accidents which by Gods providence may
fall out, may say, Ru. 1. 20.
call me not Naomi, but call me Mara, for God has given me much
bitterness, and falling into the widows misery, may change her name to the
likeness of her lot: In a word, if God send health, wealth, and liberty, Deu.
12. 7.
rejoice, but be not drunk with it, do not so rest thy self on these
present benefits, that thou think the case cannot alter, and if it alter, be
not impatient of a change, but say with Paul, Phil. 4. 11 12.
I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content, I can be
abased and I can abunde, every where in all things: I am instructed both to
full, and to be hungry, and to abound and to have want.

Lastly, because afflictions will make their way upon us, and camp about our
tabernacle; it is a good course to make them present in conceit, before God
sends them in event: In resolved minds it takes away the smart of evils to
attend their coming, Nam leuius ledit quicquid prauidimus ante. foreseen
mischeiefes hurt not so much, as they which come unlooked for.

One cause why troubles are so combersome and grievous, is because they happen
to unwilling minds, and therefore not only carry the cross, but Mat. 16. 24.
take it up, that is, suffer willingly, and voluntarily bear what thou can
not avoid: another cause is, that they happen to unwitting minds, therefore in
a calm forest a storm, forecast the worst of all events, prevent them in
thought, they will be half digested before they come, speak with crosses
(which thou accountest thy enemies) in the gate, meet them, as Ge^. 19. 6
Lot did the Sodomites, before they came into his house: encounter them, as 1
Mac. 12. 25.
Jonathan did his enemies before they came into his country.

But I proceed to the second general doctrine, which is this.

Ps. 4. 1.
God sets his children at liberty when they are in distress, as here he
brings Israel out of the house of bondage.

As he delivers from evils by prevention, in evils by sustentation, so out of
evils by giving issue, when having punished, he gives a Quietus est.

The Sun shadowed with clouds within a while shines out bright.

Ps. 107. 28.
The mariners which abide the storms of the sea, are within a while brought to
their desired haven: Mat. 8, 25
Christ did awake when the ship was like to be covered with waves, and Mat. 14.
31.
took Peter by the hand when he was almost under water: Ex. 3. 2.
The Bush burned, but it was not consumed: God eclipseth the good to show that
their light was but borrowed, but their light shall return, whereas the candle
of the wicked shall be put out: The Whale Ion. 1. 17:
which swallowed up Jonas in the deep sea, Ion. 2. 10
cast him out upon the dry land: If a sheep run from his fellows, the
shepherd sets his dog after it, not to kill it, but bring it in again, God
deals with us as a shepeheard with his sheep, when we go astray, poverty,
sickness, dearth, imprisonment, bondage, are his dogs which he sends to
bring us again to the sheepefolde, which done he calls in his dogs again:
Saint Paul says, 2 Cor. 1. 10.
he has delivered, does deliver, and will deliver out of dangers, speaking of
the time past, present and to come to assure us that God who did give does
give, and will give an entrance, did give, does give, and will give an issue,
and is preparing an issue while the cross prepares us.

Esa. 51. 71
Tribulation is called a cup to show the measure of it, we shall have but a
cup of affliction, and it shall pass from us as the Act. 28. 3.
viper which leapt upon Paul's hand, leapt of again.

If any object and say, experience shows the contrary, for we see many
children of God can no sooner breath from one cross, but they feel an other,
and as though one of their troubles hatched another, a plurality and tot quot,
like waves fall one on an others neck, neither is there an end of their evils
before God put an end to their lives.

The answer is this: the disposition of some children is such, that they are
never well, but when they are under the rod, whereas if others of a little
better nature should but see it continually, they would be quite out of heart:
would thou have thy father take away the rod, and thou have still a cursed
heart? would thou have the judge cease from holding thee on the rack, and
thou will not yet confess thy faults? thou art full of corruption, and happily
can not be well purged with a single clister, will thou blame the Physician
if continuing his medecin he give thee a stronger purgation? Thy fault is not
single, and will thou blame God if he double or treble his stripes? he is not
as a waspe, which having once stunge, stings no more, he stingeth yet more, But
Ps. 78. 32
when Israel sins yet more, he stingeth yet more: besides, if God smite
the hard heart again and again many drops of remorse may be wrong from it,
Nu^. 20. 11
as the waters gushed out, when Moses smote the rock twice, which came not
forth, when he did but hold his rod over it, know therefore that Gods
promises of deliverance from troubles, and so all temporal blessings are
hypotheticall, if they stand with his glory and our good, these two are as the
hinges of a door to turn forward or backward the promise.

The use of this is in all our afflictions, to wait patiently upon the Lord,
and hope in him, to say with the sweet singer of Israel, o yet my soul
keeps silence unto God, of him comes my salvation.

A man that wadeth through a strong stream, sets his eye ^ Ps. 26. 1.
steadily on the firm land, and is not dismayed because he sees the place of
his arrival, so Gods children patiently pass through an Ocean of troubles,
when they lift up their eyes, and marking Gods goodness, foresee their
deliverance, though it may be as Abraham saw the day of Christ, a far off:
they suffer, but patience keeps them from being ouercomme, they never sink
under the burden of their crosses, because they lay hand on Gods promise, and
hold by his goodness.

In Music we bear with changes and breathes, with pauses and discords,
because we know the Musition will make all fall into a good concord.

We grudge not to go through a piece of foul way, if the way be afterward
pleasant, and our journey nigh at an end.

If we may have a joyful harvest, we are content with a wet spring, content to
sow in tears, so we may reap in joy: therefore take up the cross, and
though God add still to the sardle, stand up still, be like the palm tree
inclinata resurgit, press it down with weight, yet mounting up, in time it
draws it on high, be like the Bullrush, flectitur non frangitur vndis, the
waves may bow, but not break it, in misery show forth the fruit of patience,
as spice sends forth it savor when it is beaten, and Camamile it sent when it
is trodden on, as the Rose yields sweet water when it is distilled, as the
Grape does yield it iuce when it comes to the press, hope even against hope,
uphold thy mind against the rage of main afflictions, for let them be like
those of Israel, many in number great in weight, grievous in circumstancec nay
long in continuance as we think, yet in very deed, a very little while, and
they are all gone, and therefore resolve with Job, Job 14. 14.
all the days of thine appointed time to wait until thy change come.

Again, this that God brings out of bondage, and having pressed us,
refreshes us, and looking on our tribulation has compassion on our gronings,
must cause us to give thanks to God for his holy remembrance to sacrifice unto
him with the voice of thanksgiving, to bind the sacrifice with cords, even
unto the horns of the Altar, this use would Moses have the Israelites make of
their deliverance: q Deuteronomy. 6. 12. and 26. 10.
Beware lest thou forget the Lord, which brought thee forth out of the land,
etc.

Three things Christ commended in the Samaritans; First, their readiness to
believe: John disciples were hard of belief, and therefore he teaches them
both by words, Mat. 11. 3
Go tell John what ye have heard, and by works, tell him what you have seen:
but he knew the woman of Samaria would believe him on his bare word Ioh. 4. 26
therefore he does but tell her what he was, and that therefore she did ask
him, and many other of the Samaritans not abiding to have their minds suspended
in uncertainties, but hating, doubting where they should be resolute believed in
him, many upon the report of the woman, many more because of his own word.

The second thing commended in them is their piety and compassion, for whereas
Luc. 10. 31.
the priest and Leuits passing by the wounded man, did but gaze on him, Behold,
but not consider, Lam. 1. 12.
both which the holy Ghost advised, the Samaritan looked upon him, with the eye
of the body, and looked into him with the eye of the mind, and as though he
had as much grieved to see his distress, as if himself had felt some part of
the misery, he is a diligent servant unto him.

The third thing is, the acknowledging of a benefit, for when the rest went
away speeders not thankers, Ln. 17. 15
the Samaritan when he saw he was cleansed turned back, and with a loud voice
praised God, as there was in God the course and descent of his grace, so was
there in him the recourse and tide of thanksgiving, God showed his benefit to
him by donation in clensing him, the Samaritan by declaration in praising him,
Gods was a real the Samaritans a verbal showing both patent, Gods was a
voluntary kindness to him, his a necessary duty to God, and therefore he will
not hide his deliverance in the earth, and conceal a blessing in his bosom,
he will not take without giving, but his praising God with a loud voice is a
grace for grace, great thanks for a great cure, and a new song for a new
salve, and this was the least recompense he did owe, and the greatest he could
pay, and a sacrifice that pleased God better then a bullock, which has horns
and hoofes to power rivers of praises out of his lips for a sea of Gods
blessings upon him, which cleansed him from his leprofie, as well as the waters
of Israel did Naaman, when he had washed in Jorden. y 2 King. 5 14.


God would not save his people Israel Ex. 23. 32
converse or enter any league with the Egyptians, the general reason was this,
lest they should be plunged in their superstitions, but a special reason was,
because he would have them mindful of their deliverance out of Egypt, and from
the house of bondage, which conuersing with them might cause them to forget:
and therefore though a weak people, when other nations like vultures seek to
prey upon them, nay seek aid of straingers, yea though they be bad yet this
was not Esa. 30. 2
permitted to Israel, and for them to join in league with the Egyptians, was
as much Eze. 23 3
as if the whore should hunt after the whore-master, and commit fornication
with him: God registers us upon his hand, that the remembrance of us might be
always present with him, and Ex. 13. 9.
we must register him upon our hands, that the remembrance of him might be
always present with us. The heathen having travailed the seas, and escaped the
danger, were wont in token of thanks to sacrifice part of their gain, to that
God which they supposed had delivered them: Genesis 7. 2
More clean then unclean beasts were preserved in the Arc: Genesis 22. 12. 13.
Abraham spyeth a Ram behind him caught him by the horns in a bush after the
Angel had said, lay not thine hand upon the child, Moses f Ex. 10. 9.
said unto Pharaoh f we will go with our sheep, and with our cattle: all
this was done, that there might be sacrifices of thanksgiving at hand to offer
to God, for escaping the danger of the flood, for his mercy coming inter
pontem and fontem, betwixt the bridge and the brook, inter gladium and
ingulum, betwixt the knife and the throat: when Abraham lifted up his hand to
have killed his son, for escaping the cruelty of Pharaoh, when they were
brought out of the land of Ham, and once a year, and that was in september,
Leu. 23. 42.
the Israelits must dwell in tents seven days, that they might better remember
their preservation in the wilderness.

But the Prophet Mulachie may charge us as well, as he did the Jews, both
with the forgetfulness of our own sins, for they said, Mar. 1. 6. and 2.
17. and 3. 8. 13.
Wherein have we blasphemed thee? i Wherein have we wearied thee? k Wherein
have we spoiled thee? l What have we spoken against thee?) as also of Gods
blessings, for they said, Mal. 1. 2.
Wherein have thou loved us? We are like L^ts daughters, who quickly put out
of their mind, as well their own deliverance, as the destruction of Sodom,
and when they were gone with their father from Zoar to the mountain, Genesis 19.
33.
committed such incest, as they might seem to have been carried to a land,
where all things were forgotten: In this we resemble Abraham, who said the
second time of his wife, Ge^. 20. 2.
she was his sister, as though he never remembered Gods former punishent upon
Pharaoh, or his own deliverance from danger: Surely says Jacob, God is in p
Genesis 28. 16.
this place, and I was not aware, and God is among us, and many times takes
away his hand from us, whereas he did hold our noses to the grind-stone, and
we are not aware, we think not of it: in extremities we vow and promise
fair, but being delivered, we forget the grief of our misery, and comfort of
our deliverance: Gods blessings go round about earthly men, and they are no
more moved then the earth, which has the circumference carried about it, and
it self stands still: give me leave to instance in two particular
deliverances, one of the body, another of the soul, first from the gunpouder
treason, though a match should have gone to the working of it, yet a treason
matchless for example for it is of the first impression, never before seen or
allowed, nameles for vglynes, or at least it has no name adaquatum, sufficient
to express it, the name of Legion comes nearest to it, Mar. 5. 9.
it had in it so many murderous spirits, which cared not though their friends
did fall so as their foes might dye withal.

Which regarded not either safety of the King, or of the Country, of the
Queen, or of the Prince, but would have swept away both Moses, and Aaron,
Prelate and Potentate, Priest, and people, high and low, one with another, have
killed the young ones with the damme, and have made Acheldama a field of blood
both of Church and common wealth. But when the proud did thus rise up against
us, and the assemblies of wicked men did seek after our souls, 2 Cor. 1. 9.
10.
when we received as the Apostle speaks of his own dangers the sentence of
death, then God, who raises the dead, delivered us from so great a death, kept
all our bones, that not one of them was broken: he to whom the shieldes of the
world belong covered us, and with his favor compassed us as with a shield, he,
who stands about his people as the mountains stand about Jerusalem,
delivered our souls from the lowest grave, as for those traitors which
willingly drew to sin, against their will were drawn to pain, God was
terrible out of his holy places, they did drink of the wrath of the King, and
of the the state, which brought them to naught, as the rocks repel, break,
and consume into froath the boisterous waves, which beat against them conantia
frangere frangunt; so let thine enemies perish O Lord, but they that love thy
name, let them be as the Sun, when it rises in its might, and let the land
have peace Nest^rs years.

As Job spoke of his words, so say I of this great work of ^ Job. 19. 24.
God in preserving us? Oh that it were written, oh that it were written, even
in a book, and graven with an iron pen, in lead or in stone for ever, that it
might be a sign unto us upon our hands, and a remembrance between our eyes,
that it might be bound upon the heart and go down into the bowels of the
belly, but it is almost forgotten as a dead man out of mind, buried in
oblivion as Christ was buried in the earth, and in very deed we deal with all
our preseruations. They are so many as Solomon did with the brass of the
Temple, 2 King. 7. 47.
it was so much, he weighed it not, but if Moses will have the Ex. 12. 42.
Israelites, keep the night holy in which they were brought out of Aegipt, and
bids them Ex. 13. 3.
remember that day in which they came out of the house of bondage, then
remember and keep holy the day of this deliverance and say. This is the day
which the Lord has made we will rejoice and be glad in it: If you be silent,
rowse up one another with the four lepers, which being delivered from death,
when they were in the midst of it, 2. Kin. 7 9
said one to another, this is a day of good tidings, we do not well to hold
our peace.

Come to the deliverance of the soul from the tyranny of Satan, the thraldom
of finne, and the very gulf of hell, for the devil is a Pharaoh, the world is
an Egypt, subjection to Satan, is a bondage: but Christ is our Moses, who
having conquered sin, death, and hell, has wrought our deliverance: 1. Sam.
17 34.
when David the youngest son of Iesse kept sheep, there came a Lyou and a
Bear, and took a sheep out of the flock, but he went out after them, slew
them both, and took away the sheep though they rose against him: our Savior
Christ not the youngest, but Romans 8. 29.
first begotten of his brethren is the true shepherd, who watches over his
flock Luc 2. 8.
like the shepherd of Bethlem, there came a Loyn 1. Pet. 5. 8.
that roaring Lion, which goes about seeking to devour us, and a Bears Pro.
28. 15.
like that hungry bear in the Proverbs of Solomon, and Dan. 7. 5.
like that bear in Daniels vision which devoured much flesh, and took not one
sheep but the whole flock, but the shepherd following took them out of his
mouth: As for the bondage and thraldom of sin, by nature it reigns in our
mortal bodies, it has gotten such a jurisdiction over us, as Julius Caesar
had over the Senate Perpetuam dictaturam we obey it in the lusts thereof, and
fall from sin to finne, as Gally slaves fall to rowing when they are fast
chayned, but God who is above Nature rescueth us from our oppressors, and we
that we^e servants unto sin, getting the maistry, break the yoke of
iniquity from our neck, we break it bands a sunder and cast away it cords
from us, we withdraw our minds from the yoke and bondage of those natural
perturbations, that are in us, God has set our feet at large, and having
broken the bounds of our yoke made us go upright, saving, having been long
used to fetters, we halt a little after they are taken from us: and though we
bear about in our bodies the remnants of sin, yet sin does not domineire,
it is not so insolent against the spirit as it was, nor keeps it under with so
strong a hand, Genesis 16. 5. 6.
nor with the servant Hagar any longer set it foot in the neck of
her-mistresse, but is beaten out of doors, when she begins to overrule; Mat.
8. 9.
we are Centurions over our affections, and in all the regenerate, that is
true, Genesis 25. 23.
the elder shall serve the younger; for the flesh is subject to grace though it
pricketh, it is not unto death, it does not grow cankerous, it is not like the
stinging of an Aspe, which, let Art or Nature divise what plasters it can to
help it, is incurable, for Christ having blunted the sting, it cannot enter
into the inward parts of the soul to destroy it.

1 Samuel 18 6.
If the daughters of Jerusalem, when David returned from the war and the
slaughter of the Philistine, came out singing and dancing in token of joy, and
thanksgiving for the victory; then let all true Christians, what little
reckoning soever they have heretofore made of freedom from spiritual enemies,
from their heart tell forth their deliverance, and say with Paul, 1 Cor. 15 57.
thanks be to God, which has given us victory, through Jesus Chist our Lord;
and no sooner mention with Paul their deliverance from this present evil world
and corrupt life without Christ, but presently breaking out into the praise of
God, say with him: Gal. 1. 4. 5
to him be glory for ever and ever, Amen.

Lastly, one use more that God will have the Israelites make of their
deliverance is this, to learn thereby to serve him, and be stirred up to the
obedience of his Law: when Joshua had distilled this and other blessings of God
upon his people, the Quintessence that he wringeth out is this; Ios. 24. 14.
ver. 17. 18.
Fear the Lord and serve him, and in consideration of this freedom they give
their honest words to serve the Lord, and keeping touch are men of their words
all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the Elders that ouerliued Joshua.
The note is this.

The more God does free us from misery, the more we should submit our selves
to his will: but it fares with us, as with the snake, who being frozen lies
quiet and still, but waxing warm stirs and stingeth: Pharaoh so long as he
is under the cross, will not have Israel under his rod, but promises their
departure, but farewell pain, farewell promise; deliverance makes him forget,
what punishment promised. 2 King. 8 8.
Benhadad King of Aram, in his sickness commanded Elysha the Prophet to be
honored, 2 King. 6. 13.
whom in his health he would have killed, what was the cause that Ier. 48. 11
Moab was settled on the lees of their sins, but this; they lived at rest, and
were not powered like other nations from vessel to vessel?

The Moon the fuller it is, the further it is removed from the Sun. The tree
is never so much subject to hurtful winds, as when it blossometh, Segetem
nimia sternit vbertas, Rami onere pramuntur: too much rancknes makes corn lie
down, boughs are broken with their own burden. The horse too well cherished
does often cast his rider; Hos. 13. 6
as in their pastures; so was Israel filled, and when they were filled their
heart was exalted, and Deuteronomy. 32. 15.
when he waxed fat, he spurned with his heel, when he was fat and gross, and
laden with fatness, he forsook God that made him, and regarded not the
strong God of his salvation: when Nebucaduezar Deuteronomy. 4. 31.
had been bound seven years prentise to the cross, he knew from whom his
Kingdom came, and honored him that lives for ever: in a word, adversity can
teach us more of God and our selves in one week, then we can learn of
prosperity all our life long. Man cannot manage a prosperous estate, but if he
be of great power he forgets God, if he abounds in pleasure, he forgets
himself, whereas God would have our freedom from affliction, to be a hand to
lead us, and a foot to carry us to the remembrance of him, and obedience to his
law, that we might say, now thou have set us at liberty, we will run the way of
thy commandments, and now thou have set our feet in a large room, as it is in
Michas, Mic. 4. 5.
we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.

If Israel must, Ge^. 5. 22.
like Henoh walk with God, conform themselves to the obedience of his law,
and Ge^. 6. 22.
like Noah, do according to all that he commands even so do, because he
delivered them from ^ondage, which was grievous to the body, then must we
entertain obedience, determine to keep his word, and by observing his will,
get him honor, because he has redeemed us by Christ from the bondage of sin,
which was grieuo^s to the soul, which went over our heads, and was like a sore
burden, too heavy for us to bear.

This, as Saint Paul writes to Titus, Tit. 2. 12.
must teach us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world: this (as Luc. 1. 74
it is in the song of Zachary) was the end of our redemption, that we should
serve God without fear, in holiness and righteousness, all the days of our
life.

AN EXPOSITION Of the ten Commandments.
COncerning the ten Commandments, this is general to them all* every one
has an Iniunction and a Prohibition: that which enioyneth us to any virtue,
forbids the contrary vice: that which forbids any vice, enioyneth the
contrary virtue: The first five have special reasons annexed to them, to bind
us to obedience: the first four make the first Table, and comprehend that duty
we owe unto God, of which,

The first Commandment contains the inward worship of God, in these words;
Exodus 20. 3. Thou shall have no other Gods before me.
The Iniunction, Thou shall have one God.

The Prohibition, Thou shall have but one.

THe reason in these words, Before me: as if the Lord should say, the service
which I will and require by virtue of this precept, rests in the soul, you
may dissemble with men, you may set up Idols in your heart, and conceal it
from them, for I have walled in the heart, and man's eyes cannot be let into it:
but deceive not your selves, see you do it not, for I know the Anatomy of the
heart, and can gage the very bottom of the thoughts: your doings are not
behind my back, but before me, before my face, in my sight, I am all eye, all
hand, all ear, all foot, I see, work, hear all, and am every where, I view
all things as one, and each one thing as all, being whole together without
division, change, or abatement. Thus you see the streams into which this
fountain diuides it self, now come to the waters and drink, raste of every
one as they present themselves in order to your view.

We must have one God, and he must be David's God, Ps. 31. 14
I said unto the, e Lord, thou art my God: this God shall be our God unto
death: therefore we must 1. love him above all, 2. fear him above all, 3. trust
in him above all, for whatsoever we love fear or trust in most, that is a god
to us; for the first, love him above all, our Savior Christ said unto Peter
three several times, Ioh. 21. 13.
Simon Ioanna, love thou me, that his three-folde confession might wipe away
the shame of his threefold denial, or as Bernard c Mat. 26. 70.
says, to teach thee that thou must love God plus quam tuos, tua, te, more
then thy kindred, more then thy substance, more then thy self.

1. More then thy kindred: Great is the love of children toward their parents,
it was a strange thing, that Sarah Genesis 18. 11.
old Sarah when it ceased to be with her after the manner of women and 21. 7.
should give children suck, it was as strange that a child should give suck
to the parents, yet Moses witnesses the one, and the French Academy reports
the other; for when a father was condemned to die of famine, his daughter gave
him suck with her own breasts, which being made known to the Magistrates, she
obtained pardon for her fathers life: here was love, much like the natural
love of the Storke, which feeds the dam when she is old, because the dam did
feed her when she was young: greater is the love of parents toward their
children, magis discendit qua^ ascendit amor, of the children the Poet said,
filius ante die^ patrios inquirit in annos; but the parents prayed and offered
to the gods to preserve their children, that they might over live them, and
therefore called superstitiosi: the child is many times sick of the father, and
weeps because his father lives so long, whereas the father is ready to dye, for
sorrow that his child does dye so soon. When Jacob supposed verily that his
son Joseph was dead, he would not be comforted; but said, Genesis 37 35.
surely I will go down into the grane unto my son mourning, and David
showing his fatherly affection, when he heard of the death of Absolon, wept as
he went, and thus he said; 2 Samuel 18 33.
O my son Absolon, my son, my son Absolon, would God I had died for thee,
o Absolon my son, my son: but this notwithstanding, if our parents, if our
children stand betwixt us and our God, we must not regard them, nay in this
case our holy carelessness must make them our footsteps.

God is love, and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him; yet
love it self speaks of hate in this respect, and exhorts it: Ln. 14. 26
If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and
children, and brethren, and sisters, he can not be my disciple: in this case
odium in suos is pietas in Deum, and if they lie in his way, as he is going to
God, he must tread and trample them under his feet, and for love unto God
forget his blood, as Genesis 29. 18.
Jacob forsook his kindred, for love he had unto Rachell.

This serves to reprove the father, which makes a God of his child, as father
Hely did, he himself was a good man, but his children of disposition unlike
himself, the white Halciones hatch black young ones, and Esa. 5. 2.
the vine in Esaias brings forth wild grapes: these children were young twigs,
that liked not under the old tree, weeds that waxed out of measure noisome, and
fruit upon which a bad air falling, it did quickly rotte, and fall from the
tree; and because their cockering father doting on them, gave them but light
admonition for heavy sins, and small l 1. Sam. 2. 23. 24. 29.
rebuke for great offenses, ( Why do you such things? for of all this people I
hear evil reports of you: do no more my sons, for it is no good report I
hear) he is said to honor his children more then God: on the other side, it
serves to reprove the child which makes a god of his father, Elisha was
somewhat faulty this way, who being too much wedded to his parents, would first
go 1 King. 19. 20.
kiss his father and mother, when he was called to the service of God: more
blameable was that disciple, who being called to follow Christ, would stay,
till his father was dead; Mat. 8. 21
Master suffer me first to go and bury my father: when the matter respects
faith and religion, and serving of God; Mat. 23. 9
call no man your father upon earth, (which should have superiority over your
faith, or hinder you when God calls) for there is but one, your Father which
is in heaven.

2. Love God plus quam tua, more then thy substance: we may roue a riches, but
God must be our standing mark: Crates, otherwise a wise man, in this was
reckoned but a Philosophical fool, to throw his money into the sea, with these
words, Ego te mergam, ne mergar a te, I will drown thee, lest thou should
drown me. The Cappuchines are but Hypocrites, who neither take nor touch
silver, but start back when it is offered as Ex. 4. 3.
Moses did from his rod, when it was turned to a serpent: the prodigal man
is blameworthy, who coming to his wealth before he comes to his wits, runs
beyond his pale, and living without compass, makes his own hands his
executors, and his own eyes his overseers; supposing he only knows the
value of the world, and that others ouerprise it: we may have riches, as the
Egyptians had their bondmen for use only, and use them as travelers do their
third leg, to help them along to their iourneies end: but the immoderate
love of them must be left to the heathen, which know no other heaven: os homini
sublime dedit, whereas other creatures look downwards to the ground, God has
given man a contrary countenance, that he might look up unto him, and has
placed the earth under his feet, to teach him, he must not set his heart upon
it: his chief affection must not be set on goods, but God who gives them: God
is the true Bread, goods as the crumbs that fall under the table, God as an
habitation to rest in, goods as a thorow-fa^e to pass by; money is a prisoner,
we keep it under lock and key, let it not be lord over us, make it out
master, we condemn our selves to our own; galleys make it our God, ( Col. 3.
5.
covetousness is idolatry) we set up an idol in our hearts.

Phil. 3. 8.
Paul esteemed all things as dung to win Christ, esteem not we lightly of God
to win all things besides. Mat. 19. 27.
The Disciples forsook all things and followed him, do not we forsake him,
and follow all things besides: lose God for gain we lose a golden hook for a
silly fish.

Weigh God lighter then the world, we are deceitful upon the balance: let
wealth seem better in our sight then God from whom it comes, 1 Samuel 11 2.
Nahash puts out our right eyes, and brings shame upon us.

Love the world better then we love God, we love an harlot better then our
own spouse; and therefore as Hosea advises Israel, we Hos. 2. 2.
must take away our adulteries from between our breasts.

This serves to reprove those which make gold their hope, and say to the wedge
of gold, thou art my confidence, who set up a new God for the old vpstart
Mammon for the Ancient of days, as treason set up a new King 2 Samuel 16. 8.
Absolon, for old King David: which make the world bird-lime, with which they
so belime their affections, that they cannot ascend upward, who hang their gold
on their souls, which like the weights of a clock, draws them to the earth,
which no Alchimist can draw out of their hearts, though it may be abstracted
out of the earth; who for love of gold, bury it, though even then they have
themselves one foot in the grave, who are Ps. 76. 5.
viri diuitiarum, men ^friches, not possessors of them as lords, but possessed
of them as servants; who contrary to this commandment, do greatest homage to
that, which should be their basest drudge: such are those stall-fed beasts in
the Gospel, which are so Luc. 14. 18.
yoked to their oxen, and harnessed to their farms, that being sent for, will
not come to the supper, they are fettered with the things of this life, and so
manacled, they entertain this World as a Queen, and let it so rule in their
hearts, that the messenger may go as he came, and might have had better thanks
to have held his peace; such a one was the young man, forward at first, as
though he would have been a disciple of Christ, but when it comes to poenam
damni, that he must lose some thing, that there must be a parting blow
betwixt him and his riches, then he takes his vltimum vale, Mat. 19. 22.
and goes away sorrowful, that (as the Disciples said of another thing) was
Ioh. 6. 60
a hard saying, he could not endure it: such a one was Demas, 2 Timothy 4. 10.
who to embrace this present world, bids Paul adieu: but love God as this
commandment enioyneth, taste and see how sweet he is, earthly things as plain
dishes will be unpleasant to us; let heaven become our object, the earth will
become our abject; long we after the water of life, we little regard the water
at Jacobs well, ^oh 4 28
but with the woman of Samaria, down goes the pitcher, Mat. 14. 51.
with the young man, away goes clothing, Mat. 4. 20 22.
with the disciples, away goes ship and nets, the love of them, though not the
use; we will not linger about earthly vanities, we will not beat our brains
and weary our selves in pursuit of the chase of this world, superfluous desire
of having, shall not gnaue our hearts, these glowing vanities shall not stick
so fast unto us, we will not thirst after them, to get them with the loss of
the love of God, and with the salve of our own souls.

Or love God plus quam tua, more then thy delights and pleasures, Ioh. 2. 16
this follows the love of the world: where the world is our God, our devotion
is pleasure and delight, when h Mat. 4. 8.
Satan the subtle sophister would bring our Savior Christ to an absurd
conclusion, he presses both the premises together, diuitias and delitias, he
should have Power and glory, the world and the pleasures which it did afford,
not but that there are just delights, which have their warrants and their
terms, and therefore as one being asked, whether a wise man might not eat
sweet and delicate meat, answered, yes, except God made bees only for fools;
so if it were asked, whether a good man may not use pleasures, it may be
answered, yes, except God made the choice commodities of the earth only for
the wicked: I will instance but in one kind of pleasure, which we call pastime
or recreation. There are as well generous delights as ingenius studies, and one
of them must give sweetness to the other, diverse while they have been so
precise, that they have thought they might not delight in any sport, at last
have been so out of heart, that they delighted nothing: but be acquainted with
the quality, let not sports be base, let them not be lawles, draw not occasion
of delight from such pastimes, as we should draw occasion of repentance, think
not the time well spent, when we refresh our selves in setting creatures
together by the ears, since this was bred by man's fall, by our own fault. Be
acquainted with the measure, bend a bow too much, it will break, lose it too
much, it will be a slugge, bend the mind, but do not break it, slake it, but
do not loosen it: Be acquainted with the due and lawful times, make not play
an occupation, let it neither be a vocation (for God would have man labor in
Paradise, and he said, fast and pray, not feast and play) nor yet an auocation
from God: Lastly Be acquainted with good carriage in it, on the one side let it
be as void of rage, as full of relaxation, fall not out with heaven, if thou
art crossed with an unseasonable shower, as though God did thee wrong, if he did
not shine at thine appointed time, on the other side, joy not to much, if thou
beholdest the Sun when it shines in his brightness: for by this over much
delight, thou make a god of thy recreation, these be lists and landmarkes,
within which we must bound the procession of our sports, and in the license of
our desires we must not remove, we must not ouergoe them.

3 Love God Plus quam te, more then thy self. First, more then thy belly to
pamper it, or Secondly, more then thy life to save it.

We are detters to the flesh, to provide things necessary i Romans 8. 12
for it, but not to live after it: Mat. 6. 34
He that will not have us careful will not have us careless: It is a virtue
to have a care of the body, their is one extreme in defect, when pinching and
sparing Col. 2. 23.
we have it in no estimation to satisfy the need thereof, an other in
excess, when Romans 13. 14.
we make provision for the flesh to satisfy the lust of it.

On the one side we must not so weaken our bodies, that we become unprofitable,
and not able to do service in Church or commonwealth, on the other side not
so pamper our paunches, not so barrel up Gods Creatures in our bellyes, not so
mast our selves like Hogs of Epicures heard, that we may save to do service
only to our bellyes.

On the one side we must not be caught up in a whirlepoole, touch not, taste
not, nor on the other side sincke in a quickesand, 1 Cor. 15. 32.
let us eat and drink for to morrow we shall die: on the on side, we must
provide that our teeth be not clean and white for want of food; on the other
side take heed they be not furred with excess: This flesh of ours is ill
inclined, keep it under that it may be obedient to the spirit abstinence is a
certain brime and pickle, to preserve it, that worms and stench do not
breed in it, but pinch it not to much for then we wrong the body, glut it not
to much for then we pine the soul; In a word if our kitchen be our shrine, if
our cook be our Priest, if our Table be our Alter Phil. 3. 19.
if our belley be our god as the Apostle speaks, then transgress we this
Commandment, which forbids us to have any more then one god.

This serves to reprove those which make their belly an Idol, which by
nature is a place of excrements: The bruit beasts take only that food, which
Nature requires for their maintenance, even the Lion, which of all beasts is
most ravenous and greedy of prey, whose appetite cannot be stanched, without
great superfluity of nourishment, contents himself for two or three days,
after he has once satisfied himself; to blame were the Agrigentines, who
builded, as though they should live ever, did eat, as though they should ever
dye: to blame was Philoxenus, who (as Catullus wished all his body were nose,
that he might spend all his time in sweet smelles,) wished he had a neck as
long as a Crane that he might take more delight in meats and drinks: to blame
was that monster of the world Heliogabolus, who was served at one supper with
60. Ostriches, and never served two days with one kind of meat, who near
the sea never used fish, far from the sea, nothing but fish: to blame are all
Epicures, whose senses are their guides, and Purueyors, whose appetites are
their stewardes who stuff, themselves like wooll-packes, who, whereas they
should be like Antes, and Bees, the wisest creatures, and abound rather in
pectore vbi est animus, quam in ventre vbi est stercus, resemble Philopoemenes
Army, which had neither head, nor feet, but whole belley, and being like the
Locusts which has but one gutt, have al their body in belly, whose bellyes may
be said rich, for they have great comminges in, whose throats are open
Sepulchers, for the fat morsells and gobbets, which they ^ury in their
stomachs more then nature requires, do there rotte, putrify and stink, as
dead carcases in the grave, who making but one meal a day, begin early in the
morning and hold out till late in the night, who cramme their bellyes, and fat
themselves like boares, till they be brawned, and have as Elyphaz, speaks
Job. 15. 2^
collopes in their flanks: If the Pagans were to blame which made them gods of
Silver, gods of Gold, gods of Marble, then how blameworthy are they, which
having a greedy gutt, a sweet tooth, and velvet mouth, make their best beloved
god show holy, sacrifising unto it whatsoever they can rap and rend, and
whereas they should be filled, with the Holy Ghost, farce their bodies though
they starve their souls, and if they follow Christ, they do it as they in the
Gospel Ioh. 6. 26.
more for loaves then for love.

Or love God Plus quam te, more then thy life: Our lives are near and dear
unto us, herein the devil who was a liar from the beginning said truly, Job.
6. 26
skin for skin, and all that a man has will be give for his life: and though
the desperate man many times weary out his life dies a dogs death, making his
own hands his executioners, though better men then he, lying sick upon their
bed in extremity of their pain, have entreated death to release them though
some malefactors laughing on their hangman jest away their last breath, yet
naturally we shrink at the thought of dissolved, and would turn our backs
when death shows us his face.

The Papists in time of ignorance were content to be at cost to set up
Idolatry, happily with the Ex. 32. 3.
Israelites, they would not spare their earings, and 1 Kin. 18. 19.
with Iezabell would harbor a crew of trencher Chaplaynes for the service of
Baall, again in their blind zeal would macerate their bodies, whipp
themselves, go in sackcloath, and fast till they were as hungry as a
Churchmouse, but I never read of any that went so far as the Prophets of
Baall. 1 Kin. 18. 28.
to cut themselves with Kn^ues, and Lances, till the blood gusht out upon
them, but yet more then that,

vt serves vitam, ferrum patieris et ignem. Men will be content to be launced,
yea and seared to, for the preseruarion of their lives: bondage is bitter Ex.
2. 23.
the children of Israel sighed, and cried, and made a moan for their
servitude, but when they thought their freedom would cost them their lives in
the wilderness, they wish they had endured it, and the Gibe^nites think they
have great favor showed them of the Israelites, if they spare their lives,
though they make them bondmen Ios. 9. 23.
hewers of wood, and drawers of water, for the house of the Lord, for the use
of the Tabernacle, and Temple, when it should be builded. A man is hardly
brought to alter his religion he makes such a league with it as Elisha with
Elyas, 2 Kin. 2. 2
I will not leave thee, he will not reele from faith to faith like a drunken
man from post to pillar, or as an unskillful builder misliking his own doings,
he will not be still pulling down, that he is still setting up, on the one
side Constantine will not consent to have images, though therefore his mother
Irene, takes him and pulles out his eyes, he tries the spirits, and retayning
the good in a resolute courage throws Iezabell out at the window: On the
other side that holy man (for so they call him) in the 2. counsel of Nice will
not leave worshipping of our Lady though, if he will do it, the devil
promises by his honesty, he will no longer tempt or trouble him: yet all this
notwithstanding Ios. 9. 9.
idolaters in Joshua to save their lives, pretend to honor God and receive his
religion: but if death and all the torments which can be devised should stand
betwixt us and our God in our journey to heaven, this Commandment enioyneth us
to pass them all, rather then give over our love unto God, for whose sake Esaias
is content to be killed with a Saw, Jeremy with stones, Amos with an iron
bar, Daniell to be thrown into the Lions den, these were but Originalls,
there followed Counterpaines which agreed with them, Ignatius, Polycarpus,
Irenaeus, and others suffered not death without a Copy, without an example,
Paul was content to lose his head, Bartholomew his skin, Luke to be hanged on
an Olyue-tree, Steven to be under a heap of many stones, and as our Savior
Christ said to Peter and Andrew Mat. 4. 19
follow me, so they followed him (though not Passibus aequis) in his life
though not with like innocence, in his death though not with like constancy,
these pledged their predecessors in the cup of afflictions, and began to their
successors, and amongst other to our English Martyrs, who in this time of
Queen Mary did stick ad iguem, and to show they loved God more then their
lives were content to go to him, with Elias in a fiery chariot, not doubting
but that same mantle, that same body, which they should leave behind them,
should at the resurrection of the just be restored in a more Glorious sort: the
former Martyrs stood in the forefront of the battle, and therefore 2 Samuel
11. 15.
like Vriah received the first in counter and violence of their enemies, the
latter like old beaten soldiers won the field in the rereward* all of them,
when they could not go the white way to God in time of peace to show they
preferred Gods love before their own lives, were content to go the red way in
time of persecution.

This serves to reprove those, which can be contented to follow Christ in a
calm, but being Mat. 8. 27
unlike the disciples, will give him over in a troublesome sea: who are forward
at first, but if they perceive they shall be pricked for martyrs, shrink back
as snailes, which putting forth their horns, being a little pricked pull them
again, who being crased vessels will not hold, but break in pieces when they
come to the furnace, like the aples, which as men write, grow about Sodom and
Gomorrah, pleasant to behold, buts vanishing into soote or smoke, as soon as a
man put his teeth to them, or like the Crystal which seems a precious stone,
till it comes to the hamering, such are they, which forsake Christ, because
they will not give their flesh for him, as they in the Gospel Ioh. 6. 66
forsook Christ, because he said, he would give his flesh for them, who when
the sun of tribulation scorcheth hot, are Mat. 13. 5. 6.
like the seed, which fell upon stony ground, which sprung up, but when the
sunn^ rose up, parched, and for lack of rooting withred away, unlike the Egels
young ones, who look directly against the face of the sun, and endure the
perching beams thereof, whereby the Egle which carries them up to make
trial, whether they are natural Egles or bastardly branches, acknowledges
them as her own, which otherwise she would extrude out of her nest.

Indeed Gods Church is made stockfish, and goes along by weeping cross, Ge^.
25. 22
Jacob cannot be quiet for Esaias, no not in his mothers womb, Mat. 2. 16
Herod turns his rage upon the poor infants of Bethlehem, when his malice
cannot dispatch Christ himself. Luc. 13. 34.
Our Savior compares himself to a Hen, and his Church unto chickens, because
Herod plays the fox, and lies in wait for them. The Kites and birds of
cruel kind deal hardly with the little, Mat 13. 32.
which build their nests in the branches of the little mustard seed. Genesis 4 8.
A thorn of his own blood troubles Abell. Ex. 2. 15.
Phaaroh seeks for Moses to slay him. Ioh. 21. 18.
Peter must be bound, and led whither he would not, in respect of flesh and
blood, which is unwilling to this sacrifice, not in respect of the inner man
and of the spirit, Act. 5. ^
for he went away rejoicing when he was whipped: but when the persecutors
thorough their beastly cruelty and tyger-like tyranny have sought to rack and
rent the babes of Christ's spouse, and like curdogs with their teeth to tear
the lambs of Gods pasture, even then life has not been dear unto the Saiuts,
in respect of his love.

Read we the Acts and Monuments of the Church, we shall find, that Saunders
took the stake whereunto he should be chained in his arms, and kissing it
said; welcome the cross of Christ, welcome everlasting life, and being
fastened to the stake and fire put to him, full sweetly he slept in the Lord:
and Doctor Tailor, coming to the place of his execution, thanked God, that he
was even at home.

Carolus, according to his name, was careless of his body in this respect, and
thirsting after the cup of Martyrdom, had it last filled up to the hard
brimme, Alas, says he, I lie Ioh. 5. 5.
like the lame man at the pooles side by Salomons porch, and every man goes
into the place of health before me, but God will appoint me one, one day to put
me in, these and a thousand besides.

These were good grapes, and feared not the press, were good gold, and feared
not the fire, were good corn, and feared not the flayle, or grindging of their
bodies, with the teeth of the wild beasts, they desired to hold life with
Christ, and therefore feared not death for Christ, and if some of them thorough
infirmity of the flesh, have a little yielded to their enemies, and stained
their cheeks with blushes of recantation, yet like valiant soldiers after
flying did again fight, and not give over the field, till they had finished
their course, rejoicing, that the sentence of death did send them sooner to
heaven, then the course of nature would have done, and that their aduerfaries
did help them to everlasting bliss, by their speedy dispatch.

The next duty to love, enjoined by this commandment is sear, Love, and
fear, are sweetly tempered together in the hearts of the faithful, they love
God fearfully, they fear God lovingly, whereas the ungodly fear him
slauishly without love, and therefore are said to Job 18. 14
go to the King of fear. The godly know God to be a merciful father,
therefore they love him, they know him to be a powerful Lord, therefore with
Job r they are stricken in fear to stand in awe of his Majesty, q Job. 23. 15.
David makes a sweet conjunction of both: Psalm. 5. 7.
I will come unto thee in the multitude of thy mercies, there is the first: and
in fear will I worship toward thy holy temple, there is the second: Love
without fear makes us presume, fear without love makes us despair, therefore
as in God mercy and truth are met together, so in the godly, love and fear do
kiss each other: by the first, they rejoice according to the joy in harvest,
as men rejoice, when they divide a spoil, their mouth is filled with laughter,
and their tongues with joy: in respect of the second they say with Job, Job 23.
15
I am troubled at his presence, and in considering it, I am afraid of him: In
respect of both the Prophet says, Ps. 2. 11.
serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice unto him with reverence: both concur
in the godly in their journey to heaven, as they did in the woman Mat. 28. 8.
who departed from the sepulcher, with fear and great joy. Mat. 22. 7.
The Scripture compares God unto a King, and Goran has observed four things
commendable in a King; the greatness of his power, the depth of his wisdom,
the severity of his justice, the serenity of his mercy: such a King is God* of
great power, Quantus Deus est, qui deos facit? he is not shaken with fear, for
^ Sam. 1. 3
he is the Lord of hosts, he is not seduced by error, for he is wisdom it
self, he is not corrupted with affection, for he is justice it self, he is
not subverted by fury, for he is mercy it self, accidents in others are
essences in him: we must reverence him for the first, hear him for the second,
fear him for the third, and love him for the fourth: In the Gospel the Mat.
25. 15.
Talents are delivered, the charge is given, the account is taken: The delivery
to one five, to another two, to another one, shows that God bestows gifts
and graces on his servants in several measures, one shall have an Ephah full,
which contains ten pottles, an other shall have but an omer full, Ex. 16. 36
which is but the tenth part of the Ephah: The charge, occupy till I come,
teaches us to use those gifts and graces to Gods glory, and the benefit of his
Church: the account, that he comes and reckones with them, foresheweth that he
will one day say to us, as the rich man to his steward, Luc. 16. 2
Give an account of thy stewarshippe: We must love him, because as a good God
he delivers his talents, fear him, because as a just judge he will take an
account: The Prophet Es. 8. 12. 1 3.
Esaias exhorting us to this fear, does first dehort us from two sorts of fear,
which hinder it. First, fear not those things which the wicked fea^e.
Secondly, fear not the wicked themselves: and now I am entered into so large a
field, that in it I may easily leese my self, but my speech shall draw it
self up within some few of their fears, which my charity serves me to
particularize.

First, the wicked are brought in fear where no fear is, they frame to
themselves fears out of their own imaginations: and as Iud. 9. 36.
Zebul said to Gaal, The shadow of the mountains seem men unto thee, so are
they many times afraid of a shadow: which makes their hare to stand upright,
their bodies to shake, their hearts to throb, their senses to fail, and wits
to faint, it is said of Antenor allied to Priamus King of Troy, that he would
either have a target borne over his head, or close his coche on every side,
whenever he went out of his house: he did fear as a sparrow out of Egypt,
and as a dove out of the land of Ashur. Mar. 8. 24
The blind man in the Gospel, when he began to recover sight, thought trees
to be men: so it is written of the Burgundians, that expecting a battle, they
thought long thistles were lances, their eye was a false glass which did not
represent things unto them in their right proportion. God does send a
faintness into the hearts of the wicked, in the land of their enemies, Leu.
26. 36.
and the sound of a leaf shaken, shall chase them, and they shall fly, as
flying from a sword, and they shall fall, no man pursuing them, so that, as he
says in Martial;

Non amo te, Sabidi, nec possum dicere quare,
Hoc tantum possum dicere, non amo te.
I do not love thee, but I cannot tell, why I do not love thee and as the
malecontent Antipodes ever contradicting will not walk in the beaten path of
the Church, yet cannot tell why they seek by paths, so those are brought in
fear, yet cannot tell why they are afraid, in Arithmeticke of nothing comes
nothing yet they fear where no fear is: What need I speak of Cardinal
Crescentius, who feared that, which indeed never was, nor never had any but a
fancyed being, for while he was busy about writing letters to Rome against the
Protestants, Act. 8. 2.
as Saul was to have letters written to Damascus, for persecuting the
Christians, upon a sudaine he did think verily, that the Devil walking in his
chamber, like a great masty curre, at last coucht under his table, and this
conceit he did find so vnsportable for weight, that let his friends comfort
him what they might, his Physicians counsel him what they could, in a
melancholy humor he died comfortles. The superstitious man deserves not so
much to be spoken of, as to be laughed at, with disdain, who intending to
take his journey for fear alters his mind. if he stumbleth at the threshold
at his setting out of doors, who ^utending to take his dinner, for fear alters
his color, if the salt fall toward him, and is as much afraid of that fall,
as of the elevation of a Comet, which he thinks always to presage some
fatal and final ruin: if any of these fearful or foolish conceits call at
the goodmans door, he uses them as passengers with slight respect, they
shall not lodge with him, but away they shall, as Posts upon the spur.

Another thing that the wicked fear is, the constellation of the stars, and
as in time past they did attribute a certain power to the planets, to work in
men good or bad effects, so at this day Astrologers make Calenders, which are
full of good and bad aspects, Saturn they say, is a terrible, Venus a mild
Planet, and so of the rest: and as they thought men and their affairs were
governed by the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, and influence of the heavens,
and therefore called them, Ier. 44. 17
the Queen of heaven, and burnt incense unto her, and powered out drink
offerings unto her, supposing plenty and scarsity, health and sickness, weal
and woe came by her: so do the superstitious in our times following,
Astrologers, which (are as Oecolampadius says) the greatest of all Impostors (
an Impostor is a Coniurer, Iuggler, or cony-catcher) worships these heavenly
bodies, supposing mankind is ruled by them, and therefore when they fall
sick, the stars are their counselors they take their Calender, if they
find it an evil day, when their sickness began, their soul is powered out
upon them, they persuade themselves, that they shall not only be weakened,
and sore broken, that their health shall pass away as a cloud, but that they
shall go the way of all the earth, that the grave shall be their house, and
they shall make their bed in the dark, and the worm shall feel their
sweetness, and therefore making their wills, take their leave of all the world:
but if it be a good day, they doubt not, but all sickness shall be taken away
from them, health shall be unto their navel, and marow to their bones, that
their flesh shall be as fresh as a child's, and return as in the days of
their youth. But the Prophet Esaias derideth such as these are, saying, Esaias. 47.
13.
Let now the Astrologers, the Starre-gasers, and Prognosticators stand up and
save thee; not that he condemns Astronomy, for it is good to know the course
of the heavens, the rising and setting of the stars, Ge^. 1. 14
which God appointed to give light, and to make difference of times and
seasons, but utterly disliketh Astrology, whereby men will undertake to know
things which are to come, and attribute the operation in the elements to the
stars, which belongs to God, who made the stars, Ps. 147. 4
and calls them all by their names, which serves to no use, but to delude
the people, and contrary to this commandment, to bring them from depending
only on God. We must not fear this fear, and as our Savior Christ
dehorting us from carking care, says, Mat. 6. 31 32.
take no thought, saying, what shall we eat, or what shall we drink? or
wherewith shall we be clothed? using this argument, after all these things do
the Gentiles seek, so the Lord in the prophecy of Jeremy, by the like reason
dehorteth from this fear, saying, Ier. 10. 2.
Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not afraid for the signs of
heaven, though the heathen be afraid of such.

Moreover the wicked fear rumors, when it was noysed that there was borne
Jesus King of the Jews, Mat. 2. 2. 3.
King Herod was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him: their hearts were moved
as the trees of the forest by the wind, rottenness entered into their bones,
and they trembled in themselves: so Es. 7. 2.
when it was told the house of David, that Aram was joined with Ephraim, the
soul of the King and his people was pressed down, fear and trembling did
come upon them, an horrible fear did cover them. God hates this fear, and
therefore will have his people, Ier. 51. 46
go out of the midst of Babell, lest their hearts should faint, and they fear
the rumor, should be heard in the land concerning the taking of Babell, for the
news came the first year, the siege came the second year, and it was taken
in the third: and Ps. 112. 7.
a good man will not be afraid of any evil tidings, for his heart is fixed,
and believes in the Lord: he is well grounded, and therefore like Mount Sion
he cannot be removed, but stands fast for ever, the fear of God does
balance his heart, and therefore he floateth steadily, blow what wind it
will, he sails to the port.

A fourth fear disliked, is fear of disgrace, which many times makes not
only the wicked, but even good men backward in performing their duty: this was
one cause why Jonas was unwilling to go to Niniu^h, and preach unto it the
preaching that God bad him, Ion. 3. 3.
Yet forty days and Niniu^h shall be ^uerthrowne; for he did not only despair
of success, being out of hope, that the children of Ashur would turn to the
Lord, when the children of Israel would not repent; but fear of reproach did
trouble him more, when considering there was in God Ion. 4. 2.
great kindness, and Ps. 63. 3.
loving kindness; which simples compounded make great loving kindness in God,
considering he was not only of long suffering before he inflicteth
punishment, but penitent in the stay and intermission of it; he thought he
should be counted a false prophet, that would be a reprofe unto him, he should
be a proverb and a common talk among the people, and therefore flies to
Tarshis, saying in effect with Moses, Ex. 4. 13.
send by the hand of him whom thou should send. This fear of disgrace
began to work upon Paul, when God called him to preach to the Gentiles, Act.
22. 1^
They know, says he, that I prisoned and beat in every Synagogue them, that
believed in thee: and now if I shall preach thee, whom before I persecuted,
what will they say? they will say, that I weaue and unweave like Penelope, and
being as variable in my practices as Proteus in h^s shapes, set up one day, to
pull down another; that I am changed as the Moon, which never viewes us twice
with the same face: thus because he would not suffer contempt he seeks
covert, would stop Gods mouth upon good terms, alleging a plea, to put off
the office which he was to execute. To come to our selves, I am persuaded that
among us many papists on the left hand, many schismatikes on the right hand
(betwixt which two the Church and liturgy of the Church is crucified, Mat. 2^.
38.
as our Savior Christ between the two malefactors) would be brought to the
tabernacles of peace, and follow the truth in love, where it not for this that
they think, they should be a reproach unto their neighbors, a scorn and
derision to them that are round about them, have I been thus long a Recusant,
thinks some Papists, have I thus many years held these and these opinions,
and shall I now stain my cheeks with the blushes of recantation, and not
second my beginnings with suitable proceedings? shall a Retraxit be entered
against me, as against the person plaintiff, when he comes into the court
where his plea is, and says he will not proceed? what will men say? they will
say* that I am a wavering weathercoke, a reed shaken to and fro with the
wind, that I am so light, that I had need to have lead tied to my heels, lest
every wind should blow me away, that I ebb and flow, that I have one mind
sitting, another standing: in a word, this fact of mine will be so deeply died
in Crimson, that time in all my time will never wear out the color, in
consideration hereof, he takes unto him a whores forehead (as it is in Ier. 3.
3.
Jeremy) and will not blush, and and 8. 12.
puts upon him a brow of brass, and will not be ashamed: Again, on the other
side, many a schismaticke would love peace, as well as he seems to love truth,
being an Hebrew, he would not smite an Hebrew, and counting it a miserable
praise to be a witty disturber, would cast a good liking upon received truths,
and return to the bosom of the Church, like the dove to the Arc with leaves
of Olive in his mouth, were it not for this, what will men say? they will say,
I am like the wind which continues not long in one quarter, that following the
common stream, I respect profit, that as the divided tongues of the multitude
agree not each with another, so I do not agree with my self, I shall be a
byword of the people, and as a tabret before them, I shall be their song and
their talk, my soul shall be filled too full of the mocking of the wealthy, and
despightfulnesse of the proud; such a blot of infamy will be brought to my name,
as never will be wiped out. In consideration hereof, he holds on, his bones
shall be full with the sins of his youth, and having before published the
private conecits he had in his breast, will still continue to vent them by
word or writing, to the disturbance of the common peace: but the fear of God
must so take up our hearts, and keep such residence therein, that the fear of
rebuke, reproach, and disgrace must not possess them to dismay us, according to
that in Esaias, Esaias 51. 7
fear ye not the reproach of men: neither be ye afraid of their rebukes.

But besides these, there are other two fears more troublesome then all the
rest: the first is terror of conscience, when the sin of the wicked does
testify to their faces, when God does send his plagues upon their hearts, and
they knowing all the wickedness whereunto their hearts are privy, see Gods
justice following them at the hard heels, when recording with exceeding great
grief that which they did with ouer-great delight, their hearts ache and every
joint tremble, when they feel sin stirring in them as it were some living
thing crawling in their bodies, and gnawing upon their hearts: This, this is
the fear which when it has taken possession of the heart, excludes the fear
of God required by this commandment, this wringing, this torment, and gnawing
of bad consciences that torment malefactors, are the only three Faryes feyned
by Poets to dwell in hell, and to be nails in the heart, not but that a man
may sin, yet not have a present feeling of sin: for he may have a
spiritual Palsy, a numnesse, yea dumbnes of Conscience; conscience as a foul
Glass will not so soon represent his sin unto him, and he being cordis sui
fugitivus, dares not so much as view his filthy soul, but is like the
Elephant, which seeks to drink of puddle water, lest that which is clear
might show him his deformed face, quo peius se habet minus sentit, he is like a
sick man, who in his sleep feels not his pain, like one Dionisius into
whose belly, though they thrust needles to let out his fat, yet by reason of
his grossenes, he felt them not; like Maryners, who accustomed to the sea,
perceive not the stink of it: He is dead, smite him, yet he feels it not; he
is naked, yet view him, he is not ashamed; he is deaf, hammer on him, he
answers not, his conscience is of proof, able to repel good admonitions, he
has long sucked poison, and being nourished with it, now he perceiues it not:
tell him of a reckoning, he is so far in debt that he will not give it the
hearing; bid him search his wounds, durus est hic serm^, they are so deep, he
had rather suffer them to fester: admonish him to take a view of his life past,
his eyes are at home in a box: he has made a covenant with death and hell,
the devil is at secret peace with him: he will not hear his conscience when
it would counsel him to be at peace with God, and at war with sin, if by
crying loud; for audience it grows troublesome, he is ready to endite it for a
common barrettor, Genesis 4. 17.
with Cayn he can cast away care, with Gen 25. 34.
Esau he can eat and drink, rise up and go his way, but tranquillitas ista
tempestas est* this calm continues not long without a storm, Job. 27. 20.
fearefulnes shall overtake him as a rape of waters, and 15. 24.
and prevail against him as a King ready to the battle: Conscience is a
book, and God has given every man one to carry in his bosom, which though
he be unwilling to open, yet at last he must needs unclasp it, it is a
monitor, and at last it will complain, it is a watch, and at last it will give
warning: it is our Domestical Chaplain, and will not always stop his mouth,
bur cry out of the fullnes and foulenes of iniquity, of the ripenes and
rottennes of sin, let a man have so large and able a gorge that he can
swallow and digest sin as the Estridge does y^on, and upon digestion sleep,
and with Epimenides take a nappe of 47. years long, yet many times even in
sleeping, Conscience which he would restrain and imprison will put him in
mind of his sin.

Richard the third that usurper, who to have the Crown set on his own head,
put his two innocent Nephews to death, did think in his sleep, he did see
diverse images like torrible devils pulling and haling at him, not suffering him
to rest, he did take the sword, and did perish with the sword, at last 1 Kin.*
32.
like Ioab because he sm^t two men more righteous then him, with the sword of
his enemy, but at first like Goliath 1. Sam. 17 51.
with a sword of his own, with the stabbing and launcing of his own heart,
what an hell did he feel in himself; how did his guilty conscience gall him,
what an inward worm and fire did gnawe and burn his heart; what heart-bytings
did sting him in spite of his teeth, when his thoughts afforded him not
sleep, when his sleep afforded him not rest? who woare out many waking
hours, when a man would have thought his senses had been fettered in the
bands of rest. The good man falls on sleep with sweet Meditations, and says
with David l have I Psa. 63. 7.
not remembered thee in my bed? Therefore Pro. 3. 24
when he sleeps he shall not be afraid, when he sleeps, his sleep shall be
sweet; but the wicked imagines mischeife on his bed, Pro. 4. 16
he cannot sleep except he has done evil, his sleep departs, except he
cause some to fall, therefore God will punish him on his bed, sleep shall
depart from his eyes, or if he suffer his eyes to sleep, or his eye-lydes to
slumber, or the temples of his head to take rest, if his senses be tied up, his
sins are loose, and representing themselves unto him in most ugly shape do
affright him with hellish and terrible dreams, Esa. 57. ^1.
there is no peace to the wicked says my God* the trouble of his mind is not
inferior to the raging of the Ocean Sea: A servant that is wearyed with over
much work can fly from his master and be at rest, but a servant of sin
whither shall he fly, he carries with him, a bad conscience whither soever he
goes, because whither soever he goes he cannot go from himself, his
friends do wait upon him, are within him, and are as parts of himself when
his soul departes from his body, his conscience will not depart from his
soul, nor his sin from his conscience. He that is deeply wrapped in vseries
bands, can hardely sleep, therefore Octauian the Emperor commanded, that the
pillow of a certain soldier, which died in great dett should be bought for
him, to whom when answer was made, that it was a base pillow and nothing worth:
buy it notwithstanding says he, for it has some virtue in it to cause
sleep, that he that was so so much indetted could sleep upon it, and
therefore when cares come upon me, I will lay it under my head. But what pillow
can he quietly rest himself upon, who is more entangled in his own bands
then any can be in the Usurers? he knows his tongue, his hands and all the
members of his body are bound to the good abearing, he knows his soul is in
body bound with them, he knows he has broken the good behavior when by
lying, and killing, and stealing, and whoring, he has broken out, he fears he
shall be taken upon an execuution that it will be said to him, as to the rich man,
Luc. 12. 20.
they will fetch away thy soul from thee, hins ille lachrima now is he wounded
at the very heart, and strocke in a marvelous great fear of Gods heavy
vengeance to be powered out upon him, now is he like Es. 57. 20
the raging Sea that cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt: now is he
as a man lying in a portall, or near unto it, who can take no rest for any
long season* by reason of comers and goers, in and out by it, or that are
still knocking at it to have it opened: his sin lies at the door of his
heart, and when the fire of concupiscence has consumed all the servants of
sin the senses, the will, and affections, the conscience alone remains
unburned, and says as Iobes messenger Job. 1. ^6.
I only am escaped alone to tell thee: and if in the beginning his conscience
does not say to him as Peter to Christ, Mat. 16. 22.
look to thy self: if it be not as 1. Sam. 20. 20.
Ionathans arrows shot to give warning, if this light be not borne before him
that he do not stumble upon iniquity, in the end it will follow him with Hue
and cry, and when he has finished his sin, this light shall be borne after
him, and volens (...) he shall look upon it, whether he will or no: let him
muffle his conscience for a time as Genesis 38. 15.
Thamar muffled her face, let it go merely like the Winde-mill with the gale
of selfel^king, yet at last he shall be sure it will article against him, and set
before him the things that he has done. Cleopatra Queen of Egypt may suck
out the poison of Aspes, left Augustus C^sar should carry her to Rome in token
of triumph, and so dye sleeping: but if Satan triumphs over the wicked, who
drink iniquity like water, and have the poison of Aspes under their lips,
they roar and cry like the swine, which thinks he is never taken but to be
slain; let them eat and drink, and be merry, chea^e themselves as though all
the world were their minstrell. O how short is this Hillary Term, or in very
deed, no Hillary Term at all, for even in laughing the heart is sorrowful,
though no body knows where the shoe wringes but he that wears it; this their
iollity is but dissembled, like that of the thief, who may set the best side
outward, and revel and sport, as though he took no thought, but he has a sad
remembrance, within he has conscience to accuse him, memory to bear witness
against him, reason to judge, and fear to condemn him, without, a lock on
the door, boltes on his legs, a brand in his hand, and his neck in
suspense; I deny not, but that the best men know their iniquity, and their
sin is ever before them, but within a while, God does make them hear of joy
and gladness, that the bones which he had broken might rejoice: wickedness is
as Zac. 5. 8.
a talent of lead, and the best men are pressed under it as a Cart is pressed
that is full of sheaues; and though no element is burdenous in the proper place
of the element, for example, the water though it might annoy us otherwise, yet
would not offend us with burden, though we were in the bottom of it, but a
small vessel full, taken from thence, and laid on our shoulders, would be
heavy; so sin, though it seems not a burden in the will of man, wherein the
region and element of sin is, yet bring it from it house and home, convent it
before reason, examine it, see the plagues due to it, then shall we see the
weight of it and say, Psa. 38. 4
my sins are gone over my head, and are like a sore burden, too heavy for me
to bear: but though the good man does thus labor and be heavy laden, yet
within a while he repaireth to God, and Ioh. 13. 23.
with the Disciple, whom Jesus loved, leaves, as it were in his masters
bosom, and approaches to God, as Act. 8. 29.
Phillip to the Chariot that he might be eased, and is eased by drawing the
circumference of Gods promises to the center of his heart.

David was the sweet singer of Israel, yet in his Psalms we hear many notes
which jar unpleasantly, and are quite out of tune, as, Psa. 38. 3
there is no rest in my bones by reason of my sin; and 8.
I have roared for the very disquietnes of my heart: but God does put Psa. 40.
3.
a new song in his mouth, and there follow notes of a better sound, as this.
Psa. 51. 8
Thou shall make me hear of joy and gladness, that the bones which thou have
broken, may rejoice: Ion. 2. 4.
I am cast away out of thy fight, says Jonas, here Act. 20. 9

O wretched man that I am, says Paul, herein consideration of his infirmity
setting up sails of discomfort, he is ready to run upon dangerous shelues:
but I thank God thorough Jesus Christ our Lord, this is a breath of faith,
which coming stopes his course, and standing as a rudder in the sentence,
turns it quite another way, but as for the ungodly, it is not so with them,
when they hit upon discord, they never fall into a good concord: when they
fall, they fall away, Prolapsi, id est, prosus lapsi, they fall like the
Elephant, who being down, rises not again, 1. Sam. 4. 18.
they fall backward with Heli and can have no help of their hands, in a word,
this fear and terror of conscience, in the godly lasts but for a time and
they are delivered from it, in the wicked it abides always and they are
devoured by it: to the one God gives the thread of grace to bring them out of
the laberinth of a troubled mind: the sense of sin sendes the other headlong,
Mat. 8. 32
as the devils the heard of swyne, to the lake of disperation, fear in the one
Psa. 114. 3.
like Jorden is driven back, in the other like 2. Kin. 5. 27.
the leprosy of Gehezi it clea^eth fast for ever, of all fears, fear not
this fear, it is most opposite to the true fear of God, which this
Commandment requires. Lastly the wicked fear death and that because they
never feared God in their life, they carnally fear to dye, they hellishly
fear to be dead, the intolerable pain in the very act of dissolution causes
the first, the conceit that they shall be ever dying causes the second. A good
man looks death in the face, and goes out courageously to meet it with a
smile, and taking it by the hand before it takes him, does at once welcome and
contemn it, he knows that 1. Cor. 15 56.
the sting of death is sin, and that Christ having pulled it out calls it
droane to it face; 1. Cor. 15 55.
O death where is thy sting: and therefore he is like the Swan, which by a
natural instinct finisheth his life with joy and singing.

-- vbi fata vocant, vdis abiectus in herbis
Ad vada Maandri concinit albus olor.
but to the wicked, it is a death to think upon death, when they consider on
the one side, what evil they have done, and on the other side, what evil they
shall suffer; on the one side, what bad stewards they have been, on the other
side, what reckoning they shall make at the audit: they cry loath to depart,
and are still willing like slaves to be chained to their gallyes, and are as
unwilling to go out of life as Genesis 19. 16.
Let out of Sodom, and and are pulled from the earth with more violence, then
1. Kin. 2. 28.
Ioab from the horns of the Alter. But if the fear of God possesses our
hearts, then are we void and empty of this and all other base fears,
according to the admonition of Esaias, Esa. 8. 12
we fear not the fear of the wicked. And secondly we fear not the wicked
men themselves according to that of our Savior Christ, Mat. 10. 28.
fear not them that kill the body, and Justinius Martyr said: the persecutors
could only kill, they could not ill, much like that of Petus concerning Nero,
occidere me potest, l^dere vero non potest: they have no more power over the
soul, then Satan had over Jobs, and can hurt the soul no more, then he which
cutteth a garment hurts the body, for the body is the garment of the soul.
Jacob Genesis 31. 3
when God bids him leave Padan Aram, and go again to Isaac his father in the
land of Canaan, has a wolf by the ears, which he can neither hold, nor let
go without danger: if he disobeyes, he has God against him, if he obeyes, his
brother Esau comes against him, but the fear of God as the stronger iron
drives out the fear of man as the weaker nay^e. Gods Commandment is of more
force to make him obey, then present peril to make him afraid, he fears God
more then man, whose life is in his breath, whose breath is in his nosthriles;
Saint Laurence feared not his persecutors, who speak to the Emperor who
caused him to be tormented on a fiery gridyron on this wise.

This side is now roasted enough; turn up O tyrant great:
Assay whither roasted or raw, thou think better meat.
Apollonia feared not her persecutors, who for confessing the faith of Christ,
had all her teeth pulled out of her head: (Hereupon I suppose it came that
Apolline, was the Saint for the Toothache) and when the Tyrant threatened to
burn her, except she would blaspheame Christ, she breaking from the Officers
willingly leapt into the fire. I commend her constant courage: but set no
Rosemary branch upon her fact, for when our Saui, our Christ says to Peter,
Ioh. 21. 18.
another shall bind thee and lead thee whither thou would not, he
teaches, that we must suffer of another, not of our selves; we must not lay
violent hands by no means upon our own bodies. In latter times Latimer
feared not his persecutors for -- tim^r addidit alas, fear would force flight.
But he having forewarning six hours before, that a Pursiuant, was coming
down to call him up to London, there after examination to be clapped in the
Tower, and condemned, was so far from flying, that in that time he provided
himself, that he might be ready to ride with the Messenger: all these knew
that if they be blessed that dye in the Lord; then much more blessed are they
that dye in the Lord; and for the Lord, they knew that Christ did forsake his
father, heaven and all to come unto them, and they would forsake their friends,
earth and al to come unto him. Their enemies being more weary in tormenting
them, then they of the torments, which seemed* more harsh to the beholders then
to themselves, who did endure them: they were not afraid though ten thousand of
people did beset them round about, who could but kill the body, but they feared
him who having killed the body was able to cast both body and soul into hell
according to the charge which Christ gives, Luc. 12. 5.
fear him, which he doubleth, yea I say unto you fear him, hammering upon us
again, and again, because nay les the oftener they are smitten, the deeper
they pierce.

The last thing required by this commandment is to trust in God, which
follows the fear of God, as we see in Exodus, Ex. 14. 31
the people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord: Abraham believed the Lord,
when he promised him the land of Canaan, though he had not in it the breadth of
a foot, his faith was as sure as his sense, that which was to come many years
after was as present with him, as if he had taken livery and season, and
present possession.

He believed God, when he promised to multiply his seed as the stars of
heaven, when as yet he had no child, himself was stricken in years; and his
wife past childbearing, though God, who is above nature, having given him a
son: Ge^. 22
bad him offer him up for a burnt offering, he submits his reason to faith,
not his faith unto reason, he believes that which reason cannot comprehend.
Jacob resting on Gods promise, with an heroical mind declares the land of
Canaan to be d Genesis 49.
his, whereas at most he had in it but a place of burial, and that by
entreaty, and lying sick, but on a base couch, as though he had been some
mighty Monarch; deuideth the land by will to his several sons; he believed
that God who had promised, was able to perform, he believed Gods providence,
whereby he did foresee his power, whereby he could effect, and therefore
against all logic he holds the conclusion in spite of the premises. This
serves to reprove those which distrust Gods promises, which distrust his
providence, which distrust hie power, for the first, Palaam the liar was
enforced to acknowledge that Number. 23. 19.
God was true, and every man a liar, therefore the Psalmist compares his words
Ps. 12. 6.
to silver, seven times fined, wherein is neither dross nor superfluity, and
says, Ps. 62. 11
God spoke once two things there are Power and Judgment in God, as if he
should say, God needs not to repeat his words to give assurance, as Pharohs
dream Genesis 41. 32.
was doubled because it should surely come to pass, for if there were but one
syllable of his truth, it were all one, as if there were a great volume: Job
therefore distrusting Gods faithfulness, speaks as a man not well in his
wits, when he would have God Job 17. 3.
lay down a gage, or put in a pledge or surety with him. Concerning his
providence, as a man has a care over his whole family generally, but more
particularly over his wife and children; so God has a care generally of all
his creatures, as creation was the mother to bring them forth, so his
providence is the nurse to bring them up; the first sets up the frame of the
house; the second keeps it in reparations; but he has an aspeciall care of
the Church his spouse, his providence houereth over it, Ex. 25. 20
as the wings of the Cherubins over the mercy seat, he sets his providence
between it, and all hurts, that might oppress it, as Ex. 14. 20
the pillar of the cloud was set between the hoasts, that no harm might
befall unto Israel. 2 Sa^. 24. 1.
David therefore was to blame to number his people, as distrusting Gods
providence, and trusting in the multitude of his strong men it: was not a fault
to number the people, if it had bin Ex. 30. 12
toward the taxation of the Tabernacle, Number. 1. 2
o^ for the war; but to number them as David did, either for curiosity to
know, or vain glory to boast, or for a distrust in Gods providence; this was
it that brought in the plague. Concerning Gods power, Ex. 4. 3.
Moses rod turned into a serpent, does not speak, yet cries with a loud
voice, Luc. 18. 27.
that which is impossible with man, is possible with God: who but he could
turn the Ioh. 2. 9.
pots of water into wine? who but he could Ex. 7. 19.
turn rivers of water into blood? Act. 12. 13
who but he could plague one man by lyce and worms? who Ex. 8. 17
but he could plage all Egypt with these vermin? who but he could Genesis 19.
11.
blind one city? who but he Ex. 10. 23
could blind all Egypt. Let no man doubt of his power, when he has assurance
of his will, to God nothing is wonderful, because he knows all things,
nothing impossible, because he can do all things, nothing hard, because he
can do all things with his will, and therefore Job 42. 2
Job having spoken of his power, speaks of his thoughts: as Calvin says, to
teach that his power and will are things inseparable, his mind and hand agree
together, the one to determine, the other to bring to pass.

Therefore the Israelites are to blame to distrust his might, Ps. 78. 19
can God prepare a table in the wilderness? but twice to blame, for that
contrary to their own experience, they limited the holy one of Israel. He
smote the stony rock indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
ouerflowed, can he give bread also, or prepare flesh for his people? How
incredulous were they, when the repetition of former blessings could not breed
an expectation of future hopes? he shot somewhat near the mark, that said,
Rhetoric was the art of persuading, for many times truth it self being
delivered by one that has been slow of speech, slow of tongue and of
uncircumcised lips, has not had so much likelihood of truth, as falsehood has
had by means of good utterance. A poor man complained to the King, that such
a man (naming a Lawyer) had taken away his Cow from him; I will hear (says
the King) what he will say to the matter, nay says the poor man, if you hear
him speak, then have I surely lost my Cow indeed; he thought that smooth
speech and cleanly carriage was as a golden chain, which coming from the
Lawyers tongue would fasten to the Kings ears, to persuade and lead him
whither he would. It is worthy the observation, what Socrates said before the
Judges in his own defense, touching his accusers; my Lords (says he) I know
not how you have been affected with mine accusers eloquence, while you heard
them speak, for mine own part, I assure you, that I, whom it touches most,
was almost drawn to believe, that all they said, though against my self, was
true, when they scarsely uttered one word of truth; but let Rhetoric do the
best it can, no ornament can be so good an argument as experience. Experience
teaches that, which Rhetoric was never able to persuade, it teaches by
effect that, which we never would comprehend by discourse, Ex. 7. 15.
God bad Moses take his rod with him, when he should turn the river Nilus
into blood, that hereby remembering the former, he need not doubt, but God was
able to work an other miracle.

1 Samuel 17. 34.
David gathers strength to go against Goliath, because he had experience of
deliverance from the Lion and the Bear. Experience is a faithful man's proof,
instances his remonstrations, but the Jews speak of Gods power by experience,
they instance in what particular his power did appear; yet chain his hands,
and curb his might, as though he which had given them bread and water of
affliction, could not as well give them bread, as he had done water for their
consolation. The reason of all this distrust is, because we stand reasoning
with God, how shall this be done? thou fool will thou measure Gods power by
that thou perceiuest, or make thy conclusion by the slender means thou see.

but where shall we have bread for such a multitude? Io. 6. 5. 9
there is a little boy here, which has five barley loaves and two fishes, but
what are they among so many? what, they are enough, and more then enough. God

God feeds the young ravens that call on him, yet no ordinary feeding without
sowing, Mat. 6. 28
though God cloathe the lilly of the field, yet no ordinary clothing without

as well the labor of the Mariners in casting the wares out of the ship to
lighten it, as their fervent prayers to save it. As for those heretics
Bednini among the Saracens, which affirm that all things happen by desteny,
and therefore go to battle unarmed, saying, death cannot be eschewed, they
and the like would be used as Zeno used his servant, who when he alleged for
himself, it was his desteny to steal, as though that should have excused his
theft, told his servant, it was his desteny to be punished, and therefore he
must expect no favor: If we suffer evil, we must as well look to the justice
of God, who suffers, as to the malice of man, which offers the wrong, else
shall we be impatient, and biting the stone neglect him that threw it. So if we
expect good, we must as well look to the means to procure it, as to God who
gives it, else shall we be terre invtile pondus, and by doing nothing come to
nothing, as though we were very thieves to our own estates.

As on the one side we must not neglect the means, so on the other side we
must not be to much tied to them, for then contrary to this commandment, we
make the means a god, as they which Hab. 1. 16
sacrifice to their net and burn Incense to their yarne: this was the fault of
Israel, they trusted to much to the Egyptians to whom they used to fly in their

they trusted to much in Esaias. 31. 1

I was in the day consumed with heat, and with frost in the night, and my

In our own profession, 1. Tim. 4. 13. 15.
every man to his study, Sermons must not come forth as untimely fruit, from
uncircumcised lips, therefore use means; but if God bless not our studies,
we may fish all day, Luc. 5. 5.
as Peter fished all night, and take nothing, we cannot ^^n the point aright,
except God give wind to our sails, we shall be as barren and childles as
Sarah. (I speak as Paul, 1. Cor. 4. 15.

thither: Non possum facere, not that it passes his power, but that it is
contrary to his nature, this impossibility proceeds not of infirmity, but of
might and Majesty, for what he purposes in his mind, he can effect and
execute without let, without means: But means without God can never work,
therefore use good means but rest not in them as in God, so rest on God, that
our confidence in him do not exclude our taking pain, yet so take pain upon
trust in him, that our endeavors never be perplexed.

Before me: A tyrants own will goes for a law, without regard of right or
reason:

Sic volo, sic iubeo, stet pro ratione voluntas. When Constantius, would have
Paulinus, Lucifer, and other Bishops subscribe against Athanasius, and
communicate with the Arrianes, he yielded no other reason but this; Quod ego
v^lo, pro Canone sit, do as I bid you, or get you hence into banishment. Thus
he made a stawking horse of his own will, but in God (in whom things cannot be
divided, one from another) righteousness is linked with his will, when he
shows his will, right is seen to go with it; his word agrees with his
intention, because he is truth, his work with his word, because he is power:
his will with his equity, because he is right. When he shows his law, unto
Jacob his statute, and ordinance unto Israel, reason is seen to go with it:
as in this place, see you have no other Gods but me that brought you out of the
land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, for if you set up an idol in your
hearts, and sacrifice your souls unto it, howsoever you may conceal this
iniquity from men, yet it is open and manifest to me, who have made a window
into the heart; though I reserve it under lock and key for mine own view.

Before me: we do good as before God, not caring who sees us, we do good
with a witness, and wish it might be on record, but we do ill as behind God;
for we hide and cloak our sins, and dawbe them over with some whorish
complexion, as our Genesis 3. 7.
first parents with Fig Tree leaves did cover their nakedness. But Heb. 12. 29.
God is a consuming fire and in his presence all couers, all false colors,
all Poppean paintinges of these pictes do soon fall away, Io^. 1. 2.
the wickedness of the Niniuits comes up before God: Eccl. 8. 13
they feared not before God, if our heart be not perfect with the Lord, but
divided, this wrong in parting his right among other is before God. 1. Cor. 2.
11.
No man knows what is in man but the spirit of man that is in him: Momus, who
controuled all the gods without exception blamed Vulcan, for that he did not
set a grate at man's breast; that others might pry into his thoughts, yet Luc.
9. 55
a man knows not his own spirit except he does examine it, but let him
examine it, yea double his examination, as the Apostle does 2. Cor. 13 5.
double his exhortation, yet when he has done all, and sifted what he can, his
spirit is not so manifest to himself as it is unto God, and therefore David
confessing, that Psa. 13. 29
God knows every man's thoughts long before they enter into his mind,
desires God Psa. 19. 12
to cleanse him even from his secret faults, he could not understand his own
faults, but confesses that God is well acquainted with those sins in the
inmost concauity of the heart, unto which he himself was but astranger.

The mind of man goes up to the heavens, goes down to the deep, enters
into a thousand places without removing, the light of the sun cannot be shut
up in any place, but sheddeth it self into all places, and is present with all
things: we see in essence and presence, if the creature be in so many places,
where shall the creator not be? if there be such light in the one, what light
shall be in the other: in the father of lights: in respect of whom the sun
it self is but a snuff. God is as Giges, when he had turned the head of his
ring to the palm of his hand, he is seen of none, and ouerseeth all: we see
God but in a glass, saculum est speculum, this glass was clear before the
fall, but now Cor. 13. 12
we see through a glass darkely, but God sees us in open light, ex antica
facie, as well as ex postico tergo: ad intra, as well as ad extra, the thoughts
of our hearts, as well as the words of our lips, and works of our hands.

Jonah, Ion. 1. 2.
Arise and go to Nineveh that great City, and cry against it; but Jonah
knows that the justice and mercy of God, like the Ioh. 20. 4
two disciples run together, and that his mercy out-runs his justice, as the
other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulcher: and
therefore thinking, that when Justice and mercy had a while striued together,
as Ge^. 25. 22
Esau and Jacob in Rebeccaes womb, mercy at length (to the cracking of his
credit) would get the upper hand; therefore he is bound for Tarsus, and
imbarking himself in a ship intends to cross the seas, hoping that a
favorable wind will send him a short cut, but howsoever his hope was
frustrated in the latter, yet his opinion did not deceive him in the former:
for when Justice would have prevailed, mercy did put in, and sped herself to
the rescue, herewithall. Jonas being at dagger drawing, says, Ion. 4. 2.
was not this my word, when I was yet in my country? Jonah it was not thy word,
it was but thy thought, this thought was locked and closed up in thy heart, as
in a privy chamber, it had not yet gone out at the door of thy lips, and
vented it self by words to other men's ears, thy tongue had not yet been a
public notary of thy heart, nor thy mouth a messenger of thy mind, or a
vocal interpretor of that, which thou had contrived; why then do thou
say, was not this my word; when as yet thy tongue was hid in thy heart? on the
one side I would not have the tongue tied, or have the put a gagge in thy
mouth; or hide thy sins either by negation as Selom^ns curtizan; Pro. 30. 20.
who wipeth her mouth, and it is not she: or extinuation, as to say as Lot of
Zoar, Ge^. 19. 20
is it not a little one? or Justification, as the Jews, s Ioh. 8. 48
say we not well, that thou art a Samaritan and have a Devil. Sin is a bad
blood, and let confession be the opening of a vain to let it out, let the
mouth be as that gate in Jerusalem, Neh. 3. 14
thorough which all the filth in the City was carried out; but on the other
side, wilt thouly accusing thy self of that, whereof thou art not guilty, make
thy self worse then thou art: shall other men's tongues lick their own sores,
as Luc. 16. 21.
the dogs do Lazarus, and shall thy tongue sting thy self, and make a sore
when none is. Why will thou be such a Cipher and cutter of thy self? is not
enough for thee to have some venom in thy stomach, when thou wishest, that
God would rather overthrow x Ion. 4. 3.
the City, then that thy credit should be empaired in sparing it; but thou
must also affirm to the slandering of thy self, that like a mad dog, thou
did lay out a venomous tongue? but I condemn not thy discretion; thou
spakest to God, to whom thy thought is a word, for he to whom darkness and
light are both alike, sees the very entrails of the soul, the very heart of
the heart as clearly, as he understands the language of the tongue, and speech
of the lips; Nay sometime, as in prayer, a thought is a cry, and a cry, but a
still voice, for such may it be, that God will turn away his ear, and he
will never hear it: Why does the holy Ghost charge the Scribes with speaking
slander, when they did but think, Christ did blaspheme, in saying to the
palsy man, Mat 9. 3.
Thy sins are forgiven thee: it was within themselves; how was it then a
saying? this is a kind of solecisme, and being like unto false Latin, seems
to have much incongruity: the heart is a scabbard, wherein the thought is
sheathed: it is not a word, till the tongue, as a hand does draw it forth: the
heart was a cisterne, which held this poisoned licour, it was not a word,
except the tongue as a pipe had sent it out. The tongues then of the Scribes,
not being busied about this blaspheming, but co^cealing what they thought: why
does the holy Ghost say, they said it? was it because he would clippe the
credit of the Scribes, and by this means make them lighter esteemed? that be
far from him, God forbid, that the righteous God should find fault, because
he would deprave, because he would disgrace, or sack any man's name: Job 24. 12.
he does not charge men with folly, when they deserve it, and will he charge
them, when they deserve it not? that be far from him. But the reason is
this, because the thought and the voice are equally audible to him, that
hears without ears: because he that made the heart and the tongue, the
reins, and the lips understands the language of both, of all alike. Because
he is as near to the speech of the thought, as voice of the mouth: And
therefore I shut up this Doctrine with that excellent saying of Saint
Augustine: God is a light which no other light can see, a brightness, which no
other brightness beholds; a light which darkeneth all othet lights; a
brightness which blinds all outward sight: a light of whom comes all
light: a brightness in comparison whereof all other brightness, is but dimnes:
a light unto whom all darkness is light, and all dimnes bright: a light which
no blindness can ouershadow, no mist can dim, no let can foreclose, no
shadow keep of, which enlightneth all things wholly, together at once, and ever:

Thus much of the Doctrine, gathered from the Argument, used in this place;
that therefore we must not withdraw our hearts from God, to set them upon
strange Gods; because our inside as well as our outside is before him: full
before his face.

But as they which have blemishes in their eyes, think the sky to be over
cloudy; so some, when the Prince of this world has blinded their eyes, (as the
Raven strikes out the sheeps eye, as Judge 16. 21.
the Philistims boared out Sampsons eyes, as 1 Match. 1 23.
Antiochus took away the candle-sticke for the light of the Temple) think,
that God is covered with clouds, Esaias. 29. 15.
that there is a mist before his eyes, so that he cannot gage into the bottom
of the thoughts. Why (say they) did God, when he would overthrow Sodom, and
break the gall of Gommorhas heart, and power the cup of his wrath upon
Admah, and Zeboim; why did he say, Genesis 18. 21.
he would first go down, and see, whether they had committed crying sins,
before he rained fire and brimstone upon them from heaven; if his insight were
such, as he did understand the thoughts long before? For resolution whereof
we must consider, that God speaks (...) after the manner of upright judges,
who sift the cause and sound the depth of the matter, before they send a plague
upon malefactors: whereout as the Prophet speaks, they shall not be able to
pluck their necks. Unjust Judges sitting in Caiphas d Mic. 2. 3.
seat, Mat. 26. 66^
first give the sentence, then ask the opinion what other think.

The Captain perverting all equity, Act. 22. 24
commands Paul to be scourged and examined; here is (...), the cart before
the horse, justice turned topsie turuy, Captain, is this soldier like to
wound a man upon his back? is it justice like, to throw away the balance,
that Justice holds in her hand: to sit and judge according to the law: this
is the Magistates duty; but to command one to be stricken contrary to the law,
before he be examined, this is tyranny: will thou have an archer shoot
right, before he sees the mark: why do thou thus turn judgment into
gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood. God does not take this
course, but Amos 7. 8.
he sets his line before he heweth with his axe, and our Savior Christ
speaks first of the accusation, then of the condemnation, Io. 8. 10
woman where are thine accusers, has no man condemned thee? God will spend his
plagues upon the wicked, and bestow his arrows on them, he will speak unto
them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure: upon the Sodomites,
he will rain snares, fire and brimstone, this shall be their portion to
drink, he will make them like a fiery oven in time of his wrath, but to show
that his hand shall not take hold on this judgment, before his eye has taken
view of the indictment: he says, I will go down and see: and still observe
this in the will of the Lord, he never makes his hands executors: but first he
makes his eyes the overseers, and this is that which is in the Prophet Amos,
Amos 9. 8
the eyes of the Lord God, are upon the sinful Kingdom, and I will destroy it
clean out of the earth.

But again, if God does spread his eyes upon all, and Job 25. 3
as Bildad says his light does arise upon them, if he be like Minerua, who
was so portrayed by the cunning Painter Amuli^s, that which way soever on cast
his eye, she always looked on him, Job. 1. 7.
why does he ask Satan from whence he came? Why, Genesis 44. 19.
will not you give Joseph leave, to ask his brethren that which he knows
already. Our Savior Christ knows that the blind man's suite, is for recovery
of his sight, but yet asks, Luc. 18. 41.
what will thou that I do unto thee: First that the blind man might be the
more stirred up to pray, as one loath to loose audience for want of speaking
out. Secondly that the Miracle in restoring sight might appear the greater,
when the infirmity was made known by his own confession. Thirdly that the
standers by might be edified by his putting up so discreet a Petition, Lastly
to show that God will have as well Mat. 6. 8.
the calves of the lips, as calves of the heart, and though being wisdom
Romans 8. 29.
he knows our need, and being mercy hears our very groans, yet will have
both heart and tongue to pay tribute, though the prayer be never so short a
Brief, never so little a Current of speech. For a great Ocean of matter Elisha
to Gehezi, whence come thou Gehezi? not but that Elisha knew that he had
followed after. Naaman, for 2. Kin. 5. 25. 26.
went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his Chariot to
meet thee. But that the answer of Gehezi might show us the equity of the
punishment which was inflicted on him, not only for running after Naaman, not
only for taking Talents and garments, but for lie and all: so the Lord said
unto Satan: Job. 1. 7.
whence come thou? Not but that he knew from whence he came; but that the
answer of Satan, I come from compassing the earth too and fro, and from
walking in it, might teach us the nature of Satan, 1. Pet. 5. 8.
who goes about like a roaring Lion seeking whom he may devour. And as the
Panther so hates man that he sets upon the image of man and tears it in
pieces, so Satan, when he cannot set upon God, sets upon man the image of God.

Again Job. 1. 12.
Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, not that he went out of Gods
sight, but that he hasted to speed his commission.

Again Job. 22. 12.
is not God on high in heaven: not that he is enclosed in the heavens, but
because there is such a mark of his Majesty and glory.

Again, Genesis 28. 16.
surely God is in this place, not that he is not in another place, but there he
shows a plain evidence of his presence.

Again Genesis 13. 13.
I am the God of Bethel: not that he is Anchored in those narrow straights, but
that he might put Jacob in remembrance of the promise, that there was made unto
him. For if he can truly say in Plautus vbi sum, ibi non sum, vbi non sum ibi
animus est. If 2. Kin. 5. 26.
Elishaes spirit goes with Gehezi if 1. Cor. 5. 3.
Saint Paul absent from the Corinthians in body, was present with them in
spirit; much more shall God, (I speak now of the second person in Trinity) who
is gone hence and absent in his humanity, be in his Divine nature present with
all things as one, and with each thing as all to the end of the world. God then
is clear from misty clouds and cloudy mistes which the ungodly say, do dazzle
his eyes, that he cannot see. The Doctrine remains true God is as one that
watches to spy what we do, he keeps watch and ward over us, day and night,
marketh all our walks, all our talks as a continual ouerseer, and therefore
Job calls the Lord, Job. 7. 20
the Keeper of men: and indeed he is the Lord Keeper, who whither we consider
him as he is in the heaven that same Star Chamber, or in the conscience, as
in the Chancery, to do equity, has our sins as a seal against us borne
and laid before him, and though he hold his tongue, Ps. 50. 21
(which makes us to think that he is even such a one as our selves) yet when
he sees his time, he will reprove us; and set before us the things which we
have done.

The use of this Doctrine is manifold, First it serves for the comfort of such
as are oppressed, let men's hearts be as hard as brass, and as the nether
Mil-stone, let oppressors be, ^os. 5. 1.
as a snare on Mizpha, and a net spread upon Tabor, let gain be their godlynes,
fraud and violence their direct way to wealth, let them coin their money on
poor men's skines, and wring the sponges of poor people into their own
purses: Let them not watch and prey, but watch to pray, let them like great
fishes devour the small, and be nibling on every bait, though Mat. 17. 27.
like Saint Peter's fish their mouths be full of gold, let them when they
should Ex. 23. 4.
deal well with their enemies Ass; make their friends Asses and send them a
begging, let them when they Mat. 25. 36.
should cloth the naked, strip those that are clothed, and when they Deu. 27.
17.
should let stand still the mark of the Land, take away house and land both,
this as it is a terror to the oppressors, so a comfort to the oppressed, to
consider, that all this is before God: it is sap in the Vine in the winter of
affliction, a golden shield in the hand, which breaks the stroke of all
oppression, to consider that Gods eyes are open, and he does as well behold
them which do the wrong, as them which suffer it: Act. 7. 3
I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people, doubling his sight,
because he did behold and consider, look upon with the outward eye of his
countenance, look into it with the inward eye of compassion. And this did
season the bitterness of the bondage of Israel, as Ex. 15. 2.
the Tree which Moses cast into the spring of Marah did season the bitterness of
the waters, and in the captivity of Babylon this was a comb of honey in the
Lions belly, a sauce to make the sower sweet, when Israel should consider that
though they were taken away from their country, they could not be taken away
from God, whose title was a like to all places though they had gone up into
heaven, or down into hell, or dwelt in the utter. most parts of the sea.

Secondly this serves for our instruction, it is a provocation to virtue, to
consider that though man minds not our good deeds, yet God vieweth them,
though there were no reward for well doing, yet virtus per se, and the
testimony of a man's own conscience were sufficient to move him to good, but
there is a greater testimony, for God is greater then the conscience, and sees
all, and Mat. 6. 6.
he that sees in secret will reward openly.

Again it is a bridle to pull us back from much ungodliness, what sin is it
but might go a begging for want of service, if we did thoroughly see that Gods
eye were upon it. The Adulterer that lays wait at the door of his neighbor,
and delighteh in a strange woman, and transgressing the bounds of honesty
yields his flesh to the service of Venus, would make this sin a Mittimus,
would not moyle his body in filth and infection, no not in the dark, as though
he could closely convey his sin under a Canopy, if he did thoroughly bethink
himself that to God darkness and light were both alike. Rash censure would
restrain their verdict, if they consider, they entered upon the possession and
freehold of God whose consistory is in the heart.

Hypocrysie and gilded piety should have a pasport, if we thought that God
did search narrowly the very inward and hidden pith of the root, the fear of
God would stand at the door of the heart, and not suffer the close idolatry
forbidden in this precept to have an entrance if we mark that God says here,
it is before me, open in my sight.

In a word what one sin should find entertainment with us, if we thoroughly
weighed this, that not only the conscience which is a thousand witnesses. But
God who is a thousand consciences did still ouer-looke us, the one as an
accuser to lay to our charge, against which there is no exception, the other as
a Judge to give sentence, from whom there is no appeal who has his name (...)
of (...) to see, because the very grave is naked before him. Neither is he such
a God as the heathen fained their bifronted Iaxus, to whom they dedicated the
first month of the year, setting him out with two faces, with the one looking
back to the year past, with the other looking forward to the year to com: for
if he did only see such sins as were but a year old, we need never pray
with David Psa. 25. 7
forgive me the sins of my youth, then such sins as we had a year
outliued, being like our common Almanackes out of date at the years end,
should be cast behind his back, and we might hane a pardon by course, or be
quit by Proclamation, for who should lay any thing to our charge, when God
against whom we have offended, had forgotten, but therefore we must avoid
sins of youth, sins of age, sins of dotage past present and to come,
because they are all before him, Reu. 1. 8.
who is the ancient of days a and o the beginning and the end the first and
the last. If we meet with bad debtters, yet happily upon good terms, such as
the debtter uses in the Gospel, Mat. 18. 26.
have patience with me, and I will pay thee all: we are content to bear with
them, and to suffer them to delay the payment, but if thorough breaking many
days we despair of the debt, we either let them go upon some easy
composition, or dismissing them for want of ability we burn their bands, but
it is not thus with God, we are debtors to him, and he must be satisfied, the
band is written, signed, sealed, yea forfeited and broken, he calls upon us
to take some order with him, he knocks at the door of our ears by his word,
and having a patience beyond all patience, sends his Bayliffes to warn before
he does arrest, a sound of woe before we, but if the debt be not discharged, he
does not burn the band, but still our sins are before him, not sins of the
year past, or sins of the year to come, but sins wherein we were
conceived, sins which shall lie down with us in the dust, they all remain
scored up, and being registered in his book of accounts, stand in Record; for
without satisfaction, there is no remission, the only remedy we have is to
repair to Christ for a quittance, to beg of him a Quietus est, to show God a
general release upon his satisfaction of the det, desiring, that it would
please him, in him to be well pleased.

The second Commandment.
Exodus 20. 4. 5. 6. Thou shall not make to thy self any graven Image, nor the
likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath: or in
the water under the earth. Thou shall not bow down to them, nor worship them:
For I the Lord thy God, am a jealous God, and visit the sins of the Fathers
upon the Children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,
and show mercy unto thousands to them that love me and keep my Commandments.
IT was a saying of the Orator Demosthenes, non modo scripta, but if it were
possible, sculpta etiam loqueretur: for mine own part I cannot speak scripta,
in print (as they say) for the form of my words, (nor prune my syllables,
mince my words, martial my phrases, and grave my speech with paintings: let
bad spokesmen do this; who being sent to woo for God, do speak for
themselves; only my care is, that too rude and careless words do not slubber
up good matter, and unhandsome clothes mishape a good body:) but I must needs
speak sculpta: for the substance of my matter, speak of that which is carved,
of that which is graven, of that which is painted, Thou shall not make to thy
self any graven Image, nor the likeness, etc. in which words, the prohibition
forbids us falsely to worship the true God, or give his true worship to a
false God; condemning such, as are stained with their own works, and go a
whoring with their own inventions.

The Iniunction requires us to worship one true and everlasting God, in
sincerity and truth as he has prescribed in his word; commending such as kiss
the son, and washing their hands in innocence, do compass his altar.

Tereasons to make us bow our necks to this yoke are two.

The first is taken from Gods love unto us, I the Lord thy God a^ a italous
God: as if the Lord should say, my heart did cleave unto thee, my soul did
long for thee, I did kiss thee with the kisses of my mouth, I entered into a
covenant with thee and thou becamest mine, neither can I in any case abide,
that thou should be unto any other, therefore let me be as a bundle of
mirrhe unto thee, let me and none other lie between thy breasts.

The second is taken from the love of man to his posterity, visiting the sins
of the Fathers upon the Children, etc. As if the Lord should say; if you love
your children, which are flesh of your flesh, bone of your bones, divided
pieces of your own bodies, and lively pictures of your selves, then do not
say to the work of your hands, ye are our gods; but serve me with gladness,
and offer to me the sacrifice of righteousness, for my song is judgment and
mercy, my visitation is like checkerworke, black and white, they which
dishonor me shall come to shame they and theirs, their children, and their
childrens children, but those that honor me, I will honor them, and their
posterity for ever more.

The hand of this Commandment leads me to consider: First the manner in
delivering it, then the matter contained in it, each of these having such
variety of notes, worthy to be observed, that plenty it self making me
poor: I know not where to begin, but let my first Observation in the manner
of delivery be this: Our nature is very subject and prone to this sin of
Idolatry.

We are very ready to erect up altars unto Baal, and to hold up our hands to a
strange God, for otherwise this commandment might have been as short, as that
which went before, or that which follows after; and the Lord needed not have
given a double charge, or have made a double fence hadge, and ditch to keep us
within bounds, that we transgressed not: for this cause Jeremy compares
Israel Ier. 2. 20. 23. 24.
to a run-about harlot, because she multiplied her fornication, and could not
be satisfied: s to a swift Dromedary, because she did run more swiftly, then a
horse to the superstition of other Nations: t to a wild Ass, because she
could not be wearied or made tame. One sin of Israel was covetousness, Hab. 1.
15
they took up all with the angle, they catched it in their net, and gathered
it in their yarne: they loved silver and were not satisfied with silver,
whatsoever their measure held, it was still capable of more, but to set up
ido^atry; they are content to part not with their silver only, but with their
gold also, though they be far fetched and dear bought, even with the
adventure of their own lives, Ier. 10. 9
Silver plates are brought from ^arshis, and gold from Vphaz, for the work of
the workman* and the hands of the founder. But this metal was not yet tried
and fined, but remained in a rude lump, and so it was a smaller matter to
depart with it, and therefore more then so, Iud. 17. 4
Michahs mother took two hundred shikels of silver, and gave them to the
founder, who made thereof a graven and molten image; and more then so: In
Exodus the women (though women commonly love to brave it more then men, and to
attire themselves more, trimly then stands with their husbands state, to whom
it is death to go from their jewels) are content to strip themselves of that,
which is most dear unto them to make a golden Calfe. Ex. 32. 2.
Pluck off (says Aaron, hereby thinking to restrain themselves from sin,
especially considering, Ex. 30. 13
their taxation lately past, and the displeasure that might arise unto the
husbands from their wives in time to come) the eare-rings, the golden
earerings, (which to wear was, and yet is the fa^^ion in the east Countries)
which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters:
and bring them to me: stay there Aaron, go no further, never add, that you
wilt make an Image of them, for thou have already said enough, and more then
enough, for the women like an arrow out of a bow, or a bowl down a hill
without commoning hasten about the business, being ready to fulfill thy
demand before thou have ended thy words; and to bid the husbands pluck the
ear rings was more then needed, for they themselves pluck them from
themselves, and bring them to thee: if Aaron hadbut said, bring me some gold,
though not wrought, a man woudl have thought it had been as good as a
supersedea^ to their idolatrous petition: if but a little silver be demanded of
us, to buy a Bible, make a pulpit, repair a Church, or provide any thing fit
for Gods service, we play Mat. 19. 22.
the young man in the Gospel: and if we cannot possibly slip the collar, we
go away sorrowful: but to make an image the women bring gold, wrought gold,
Jewels of gold, and and though they love to be in the fashion, yet put
themselves out of fashion, to fashion an Idol.

What great affection and love does Nature work in parents toward their
children, being lively pictures and welking images of themselves? How near
went this saying to Abraham's heart, Cast out the bond woman and her son; he
knew that the promised seed should come of his son Isaac. Genesis 21. 11.
yet this thing was grievous in his sight; because of his son. Jacob
supposing that Joseph had been dead, vowed to mourn for him all his life long,
Genesis 37. 35.
I will go down to the grave to my son mourning: but hearing of his
welfare, the text says, that (as though he had been as good as dead before)
Genesis 45. 27.
the spirit of Jacob revived. Necessity is a sore weapon, and what a plague is
this, when God does not help men with the barn, or the wine press, when they
must cut up nettles by the bushes, and Juniper roots must be their meat: when
God gives cleanness of teeth in all their Cities, and scarsenesse of bread in
all their habitations: yet when God called for a famine on the land, and
destroyed the provision of bread, Jacob had rather remain hungry and thirsty,
and have his soul faint in him, Genesis 42. 38.
then part with Benjamin his son to fet^^ provision, supposing it would be
to the danger of his life. Moses shows, that when his mother Iochebed was not
able to keep him any longer then three months from the tyranny of Pharaoh,
she committing him to the providence of God, Ex. 2. 3.
dawbed an Arc made of reed, with slime and pitch, and put it into the water:
not mentioning any thing that Amram his father did in the husines, because he
was so overcome with grief, that he could not do any thing: for as luctus
loquitur, le^es, ingentse stupent, sorrows in their mediocrities speak, but
in their ext^emities are silent. so in their mediocrities they work; but in
extremities sit down and let all alone.

When Agamemnon must offer up but his daughter Ithigeni^ only, though happily
not his only daughter, such as was the Judge. 11 34.
sacrifice of Iphtah, the paint^r sets him out with his face covered, because
he could not sufficiently express his sorrowful countenance, neither (though
the tears stole down his cheeks) could the sighs, which brake from the
center of his heart, be discovered by the map of his look; Therefore when his
colors would not serve to express that he meant, he shadowed him with a
Veyle. But so ready were the Jews to this sin of Idolatry, 1. Kin. 11. 5.
that in honor of Moloch, alias Milcon, the Idol of the Almmonites, they not
only cast out one son with Abraham, expose one son ^o danger with Jacob,
sacrifice one daughter with Agamemnon: but 2. Kin. 23. 10.
burned and sacrificed many of their children both sons and daughters, though
they had Leu. 18. 21.
a straight Commandment to the contrary, yea and that Leu. 20. ^. 5.
under a grievous pain, no less then death: which God would inflict, though
man should wincke at it, and to the end nature might not move them to
compassion, when they should hear the pitiful cry of their children, they
had instruments of Music, and sounding of Bells to drown their woeful noise
and lamentation.

It is a shame for any one to take away that which of right belongs to
another, a shame for the father (...) to bring up a Child with crooked nails,
and for a husband to match with a wife that is as light on finger as Asahel on
foot; 2 Samuel 2. 18.
as light as a wild Roe: yet Rahel not regarding her own shame, the shame
that might arise to her father Laban, and to her husband Jacob, nor the
displeasure that she might incur of them both, is so adicted to superstition
that Genesis 31. 19.
she steals away her fathers Idols.

To come unto ourselves, a man may say of us, as Saint Paul of the Athenians,
Act 17. 23.
I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious: What great cost in
former times have great men bestowed in building of Abbeys, and Cells of
superstition, and that in the fat of the land: What free liberties did they
grant them, with how large privilege and possessions did they endowe them, and
though men did not really with the Jews offer their sons and daughters unto
devils, yet did they in very deed delicate them to the service of images:
though with Rahel they did not steal away false gods, yet did their Priests
steal away the hearts of the people, and entering upon the right of the
almighty rob, the true God of his honor.

What pilgrimages did men make far and nigh to Saints several shrines; when
the Bull of Pope Clement 6. given out An. 1350. for his year of Iubiley
bellowed thus; No pain of hell shall touch any, which for devotion sake take
their Peregrination to the holy City, what a number of calves flocked to Rome?
five thousand Peregrines did every day go in and out at the gates of the City:
Neither did this superstition rest only in the common sort of people* but King
Henry 2. went on Pilgrimage to Thomas Beckets Tomb, Edward the first escaping
a danger, (it was the fall of a mighty stone from a Vawte directly over the
place where he sat playing at Chesse with one of his soldiers, which place,
having no occasion given, he but even then had voyded) in stead of honoring
the living Lord for his great deliverance, goes on Pilgrimage to our Lady at
Walsingham. that this hot devotion in man might not wax cold, there was many
times a vow made, the more to kindle it, a vow did set a ^^tor and ouerseer
over the will to keep it from going back, and indeed was an entering into band
to perform it: such was the vow of Queen Blanch, who when Jews the French
King her son was sick, as it was thought, unto death, vowed in the person of
her son: that if the Lord would visit him with health, he should visit his
Sepulcher, and there solemnly give thanks, in the land which he had
sanctified with his blood. But let this suffice to have spoken of the prone
inclination of man to this sin of Idolatry, for love whereof he spareeth no
cost, he spares no travail, but goes his Pilgrimage to Caunterbury, to York,
to Beuerly, to Karligton, to Wilsdon, yea beyond sea to Compostella, to
Jerusalem, to Rome, even thither should his bare feet carry him with an offering.

This forwardnes in our predecessors, to honor Idols, in the time of darkness,
and blind ignorance, shall condemn our backwardnes for the true service of
God in these sun-shining days of the Gospel; they had zeal without
knowledge, without learning, and therefore were blind: we have knowledge
without zeal, without discretion, and therefore are pur-blind: they had cause
to wring their hands and take up an howling, that they did know so little, we
have cause to rent our hearts, and 2. Sam. 13 91.
with Tamar clasping our hands upon our heads to go to crying, to cry as a
woman travailing, or as one laboring of her first child, because we have known
so much to so little purpose. This knowledge is but contristans, because we
run with our eyes open to sin.

We may be ashamed to put on that loose, and tattered garment in the day,
which they with less shame did wear in the night,

Our defects are so much the greater, by how much we have better means to
supply our wants: Mat. 11. 20.
therefore were the Jews worse, then the Gentiles, because these only
transgressed the law of Nature: but they the law of Nature, of Moses, of grace;
therefore were they worse, because they might have been better. This
possibility gave height to their sin: in a word, let us not who have the
bright light of the Gospel, come short in zeal of those which had but the dim
candlelight of Nature; let us not, who have the law of God in our mother
tongue, pointing more directy to the true God; then any finger to the dyall,
have our motions kindled with less true zeal then theirs were igne fatuo,
which had the book of God but clasped up in an unknown language; let us not,
who have knowledge, and can speak diverse tongues, be to seek in the language
of Canaan; be to seek to sing the songs of Sion: divine notes of Halleluiah,
and glory to God in the highest. Knowledge without zeal is a lame sacrifice,
zeal without knowledge is a blind sacrifice: Mal. 1. 8.
Malachy will have neither offered to God; therefore let them not like Ioh. 20. 4
the two Disciples, Peter and John, or 2 Samuel 18 21.
the two Messengers, which Ioab sent to carry David tidings of his deliverance,
one outrun the other; but as the two Luc. 24. 13.
Disciples when they went to Emmaus, go together, arm in arm like man and
wife, cheek by ioul as Hippocrates twines, if one be lacking, there will want
a ronge of Jacobs ladder, it will be too short to reach unto heaven.

Or the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth
beneath; or in the water under the earth: Ex malis moribus bona'leges natae
sunt, bad diseases have given occasion of good remedies in that; therefore God
forbids not only images in general, but so many sorts in particular; (some in
heaven, as birds that fly in the firmament of heaven, the Sun and Moon, and
Sarres, the whole host of heaven: some in earth, as the similitude of men and
beasts, and creeping things, some in the sea, as the likeness of fishes): I
note that to be true which the Lord speaks, according to the number of thy
Cities were thy Gods O Judah, y Ier. 11. 13
and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars
of confusion.

The mind of man is a glass, so long as a glass remains whole, there is
but one face of him, which looks in it, represented back again; but if it
be once cracked or broken; let but one man look in it, there appears so many
faces, as there be crases: so is it with the mind of man, as long as it
continued sound and whole, there shined in it but the image of one true God;
but when by a fall it once lost this integrity, then it received sundry images,
and Gods majesty was disguised by variety of Idols.

But yet I do not read of any open idolatry before the flood, but after the
flood, it entered even into the posterity of Sem; for Joshua said unto all the
Tribes of Israel, that their fathers, Ios. 24. 2
even Terah the father of Abraham, served other gods, the threads of this sin
did thy draw so big and so long, that they made them cords of vanity; they
did wreath these cords till they became cart-rops of iniquity; busying
themselves in their own dreams and doting fancies, till God caused them to be
carried away captive unto Babylon.

But after the captivity Israel said; Hos. 14. 9.
what have I to do any more with Idols; Hos. 2. 7.
I will go and return to my first husband, I will not play the harlot, and be
to any other, neither did they change the house of God into a shop of Idolatry;
no when the Roman^ Emperors would have thrust images upon them, they chose
rather to die a thousand times, then lay Gods honor open to the spoil of
creatures: neither could they ever be brought to admit into their Temple the
Standard of the Romans: neither was there found any pensill, relike, or image
in their temple; 1 Mac. 1. 23.
neither when Antiochus Epiphanes sacked it for covetousness, or when Pompey
spared it for reverence; nay they were so far from worshipping the work of
men's hands, that they would not admit painter or caruer into their City.

But all this while among the Gentiles, Idolatry did lift up her head, till the
Apostles came, who cried out upon it, down with it, down with it even to the
ground, then such as God had added to his Church that they might be saved; put
away the strange Gods that were among them, overthrew their altars, broake
their images in pieces, cut down their groves, destroyed all their pictures,
plucked down all their high places, broake down their pillars, and burnt their
images with fire. But in process of time (for if the devil be cast out, he
is discontented, and says; Mat. 12. 44.
I will return into mine house from whence I came) God was again put out of
doors, and his house changed into an idolatrous shop. For about the year of
our Lord 490. Gregory the first, (the worst of all the 63. Bishops of Rome,
that went before him, and the best of all the 175. that followed, since him;)
though he utterly condemned the worshipping of images; yet thought it not
amiss, to have them in Churches, as necessary Alphabets for lay men, and good
shepherds Kalenders. The devil now having gotten an inch would take an ell,
and having gotten in his head, like a subtle serpent, made his whole body
follow after; for when the Emperors of the East, and the Popes of Rome were at
daggers drawing, they, to put down images, these, to uphold them, so mightily
grew the power of the Popes, that they prevailed: then men's hearts were not
perfect with the Lord, they went a whoring after their own eyes, looking to
other gods; they said to the wood awake, and to the dumb stone, stand up; they
asked counsel of their stocks, and their staff taught them, they had many
altars to sin, and villainy was seen in their houses: I would spend no further
pilgrimage in this walk, but that so many several gods present themselves
unto my view: which if I should go about to number, they should be more then
I am able to express. To omit therefore the Persians, which had as many gods,
as there were Stars in the sky, and fires on the earth, the Greeks, which
had as many gods, as they had fancies, the Romans, which canonized so many new
gods, as their Senate would allow: to omit this infinite variety, there were
twelve principal gods:

Juno, Vesta, Minerua, Ceres, Diana, Venus, Mars, Mercurius, Jupiter, Neptune,
Vulcanus, Apollo. To these were added Saturn, lest he might seem to be
wronged, since his son Jupiter was a god, and his mother Vesta was a
goddess, and also Bacchus, because being a hot fellow he might make some
fray: seeing C^res was one goddess, and Venus was another: herein Europ were
gods for particular Countries; S. James for Spain, S. Dennis for France, S.
Patricke for Ireland, S. George for England, and in England were gods for
particular Cities, S. William of York, S. Thomas of Caunterbury, and
Bonauenture. (but it is a venture if you find any good in it) in his Ladies
Psalter, makes the Virgin Mary as good a Goddess, as Jehovah is a God in
David's Psalter; he Lord, she Lady, he our Patron, she our Patroness, he the
King, she the Queen of heaven: there were gods for particular Parishes, S.
Stephen for one, S. Nicholas for another, S. Eustan etc. yea particular houses
(for how low will not this sin creep) had their Lares and Penates, their
Household gods, gods which were thought to belong to every several person, thus
did they give God as many companions, as there were Saints sometimes sainted
those, which never were, but had only a fancyed being. The relics of Saints
being as it were feathers of these same birds, were birds of the same
feather, and as much abused to idolatry as were the Saints themselves,
commanded to be worshipped in Germany in the time of Pope Gregory the second.

There was anciently in the time of Popery a relic sunday solemnly kept in
diverse places of this land, in which this was acustome in some Church, where
were many Ministers; (for I know not how general the custom was) they did
bear in their hands about a procession on that day every one a relic; as
Bishop Beckets Ratchet, S. Georges his dagger, or the like trash: Which the
Sexten was wont to deliver to them, and to be sure none should be without his
relic, after the Sexten, came the Verger down from the high Altar, with a
relic in his hand, asking this question, who lackes a relic? I will not
speak here of our Ladies milk, of the blood at Hayles, of good King Henry
his spur, nor of the nails* which nailed Christ to the Cross, which I
marvel they should be so idolatrously worshipped being instruments in the
death of Christ* I let pass lic^re sundry other creatures, as Wax, Water,
Oil, Salt, Incense, Pilgrimstaues, and I know not how many beside; which after
exo^cismes, hallowingrs, consecrations, and blessings over them, were made
Idols: and thought to be of more (...) and power then they were by their own
proper nature, though (...) alteration and change in them, but a word or (...)
and Crosses and then I proceed.

The public, the private, the trentall and dirge Masses forged in the Popes
shop, and as they are now, but some of his youngest daughters are whelps of
the same hare: in which they worshipped an Idol Cake, as Israel did an Idol
Calfe; they first worshipped the sacrament, and then offered it up as a
sacrifice for remission of sins, they carried it about in Gold and Silver to
be worshipped, and showed it to the people, attributing great virtue to it, for
it delivered (as they taught) ex opere operato, by the deed once done quick and
dead a pana et culpa from the punishment and the fault. By virtue thereof they
did apply the merits and passion of Christ to whom they pleased them, and what
could be more derogatory to this Commandment, or more prejudicial to the
blood of Christ, to his blood, I say, which every man must apply to himself by
his own believing, not the Priest or any other Parson apply to an other by any
work doing. What disease was there in man or beast, against which this (as
they would persuade the people) was not a remedy: By this, if any man went
beyond sea, they promised to him prosperous Navigations, if he kept home, it
would safely keep him from dangers, and sufficiently defend him from all bugs;
And therefore when danger was toward Becket, for his misdeameanors against the
King, his friends counsayled him to have a Mass in the honor of S. Stephen, to
keep him from the hands of his enemies: who accordingly addressed himself to
his Mass with all solemnity, thinking thereby to charm away all evils. In a
word they would have this idolatrous persuasion confirmed, that it did merit
release of all calamities, it merited gain and lucre in common traffic, it
merited wharsoeuer the careful heart of man could desire. Concerning the
Cross, Popery made it as great an Idol, as the Mass, and attributed no less
virtue to it, by this, if any went to war, they hoped for protection, and
expected victory. What creeping to Crosses upon bare feet was then used in the
time of Popery too long it were to number up their particular superstition in
this kind.

These our forefathers lived in a thick mist, in the darkness of Egypt, Ex. 10 21
a darkness that might be felt, and as Genesis 29. 23.
Laban deceived Jacob in the night, bringing him Leah, which was bleare-eyed in
stead of Rahell, who was beautiful and fair; so Satan in the time of
ignorance presented unto them many foul false gods in stead of the true God
which is beautiful out of his holy places: S. Paul makes ignorance the
mother, and superstition the daughter, when he says to the men of Athenes;
Act. 17. 22 23.
In all things ye are too superstitious: for in your Altar was written unto
the unknown God: but to our understanding which was deaf and dumb God has
said Ephata, be thou opened 1. Sam. 14 27.
with Jonathan, we have tasted a little honey and our eyes are opened: God has
taken from our eyes the skales of ignorance by the finger of the holy Ghost
Act. 9. 17.
as he did from Paul's eyes by the hands of Ananiaes* and therefore we must
thank God, who as he commanded 2. Cor. 4. 6.
light to shine out of darkness 1. Pet. 2. 9
so has called us out of darkness into his maruailous light. Secondly take
heed we do not (as it is in Job) Job. 5. 14.
meet with darkness in the day time, and grope at noone day as in the night.
It is a plague not to see Gods will, but to see, and yet willingly wink,
brings a plague without all remedy or compassion.

Thou shall not bow down to them nor worship them. It seldom times falls
out, but where there are Images in a land, there is also the worshipping of
those images: and therefore in the Prophet Esaias one follows in the neck of
the other, Esaias 2. 8.
their land was full of Idols: then, they worshipped the work of their own
hands, which their own fingers had made; our nature is as ready to
superstition as wood to take fire, and therefore God having mentioned the
making of Images and their variety, presently mentions the bowing down unto
them and worshipping them. Pope Stephen the 3. maintaining Idolatry of Images
in Christian temples, advanced their veneration, commanding them to be
incensed; here in England were they not wont, to wipe their hands upon the
images, and then to stroke them over their faces, as though there had been
great virtue in touching the pictures: did they not rub their beads and
hand-ketchers upon them, light candles to them, ask pardon and help of them,
did not a company of Pilgrims lick and kiss a white Lady made of Alabaster
in Windesor, whicn image was mortrest in a wall behind the high Altar.

In the second year of Queen Mary, when Bishop Boner, erected the Roode at
Paul's, did they not anoint it with Oil in diverse places, and after the
anointing, creep unto it and kiss it: did not the whole Quyer in honor
thereof sing, Te Deum, and ring out the Bells: and that images might have the
more veneration: this was a fashion beyond sea, as Archbishop Arundell
affirms in the examination of Thorpe, when the image-maker should carue, cast
or paint an image, he should go to a Priest and shriue him as clean, as if
he should then die, he should take penance, vow to fast and pray, and go on
pilgrimage; but especially he should pray the Priest to pray for him, that he
might have grace to make a fair and devout image, and therefore considering
this abuse, 1 King. 6 27.
God would not have the Cherubins seen, but only of the high Priest: and
Saint John says, 1 Ioh. 5. 21.
Keep your selves from Idols. The last words of a friend are commonly best
remembered: they are John's last words in his general Epistle, like an vltimum
vale, and a postscript, Babes k^ep your selves from Idols: and therefore in
reformed Churches they have been abolished: Constontine Emperor of
Constantinople, abrogated and plucked down images set up in Temples; the noble
and valiant Zisca conquering in Bohemia, would not suffer any image or idol to
be in the Churches: they were thrown down at Basil, about the year of our
Lord 1528, and upon Ash Wednesday that year, all the wooden images there were
given to the poor of the City to burn: but when they could not agree in
dividing the prey, they being burnt all together in nine great heaps, upon that
Ash Wednesday, were consumed to ashes. At the same time or very little before,
were they put down within all the Dominion of Zuricke, though the Bishop of
Constance writing to the Senate, what he could in their defense, did stand for
their standing. Indeed Luther much misliked Carolostadius, for stirring up the
people, to cast down images in Wittenberge, not that he would uphold them; but
that he would not have the people run before the Magistrate, and do it by
force, and considering the time (for Pope Adrian the 6. had then written to the
States of Germany, inciting them against Luther, as a fautor of tumults, and
supplantor of obedience) he could do no less to check this Adrian, then
find fault with proceedings which were without order and authority of the
higher powers. Here in England King Henry the 8. Anno 1538, abolished by
Iniunction the most notable stocks of Idolatry, as the images of Walsingham,
Ipswich, Worcester, Wilsdon, and the like; Afterward down went their
reliquies, shrines, couerings of shrines, writings, and monuments of fained
miracles, as being allurements to superstition; down went the Mass, and down
went the Roodes.

But having been long in this Laberinth of superstition, and taken view of the
manner how it is here set down, my clew of thread guides me now to the matter;
and will bring me out again into my accustomed walk.

First, therefore for the matter, this commandment meets with such as make
puppets, to counterfeit God or any idols for his service.

Secondly, with such as entering upon Gods right, are liberal in bestowing his
glory upon them.

For the first; when God delivered his law, Deuteronomy. 4. 12.
the people saw no similitude, but only heard the voice of the words, lest if
they had seen a similitude, they should go about to make a resemblance; the
fire indeed was a sign of Gods presence, but such a sign as might testify
unto them, that his glory was incomprehensible, and therefore might restrain
them from making his similitude, which would rather show the baseness of their
fancy, then resemble the brightness of his glory.

Jupiter and Mercury were the gods of the Greeks, but when their painters
would draw the image of Jupiter in a Table, they were still mending it, but
never ending it: saying, herein they showed him to be a god, for that they
might begin to paint, but could not perfect him: Zeuxis about to paint June
took a veiw of the Virgins in Agrigentine; but singled out five, portraying
that which he saw most commendable in any one, but when he would draw Venus,
he had before him fifty fair virgins of Sparta, and yet said, fifty more
fayrer then they, were not sufficient to counterfeit that goddess. Therefore
when his art could not shadow her, he drew in a Table a fair Temple, with the
doors open, and Venus going in, so as the beholders could perceive but her
back, if these could not fet out sufficiently, that which was but flesh and
blood, though they had so many helps to further them, whereunto shall we liken
the spiritual God, or what similitude shall we set up unto him, Tim. 19. 16.
who dwells in vnaprochable light, Ex. 33. 23.
whose back parts only even Moses himself was but permitted to behold: Ioh.
4. 24
God is a spirit, and must be worshipped in spirit and truth, and therefore
we must have our minds thinking on him, not our eyes gazing on his image.
False representations to metamorphise God, are called Idols, and what is an
Idol? 1 Cor. 8. 4
An Idol is nothing, there is one note of shame and disgrace, it is worse then
nothing: it Deuteronomy. 27. 15.
is abomination, it is worse then abomination: 1 Cor. 10 20.
it is a devil: let the Papists therefore (as they did in their common prayer
books in the Reign of Queen Mary) figure the image of the Trinity with three
faces, let them figure, as in many Church-windowes the Father like an old man,
with a long gray beard and a furred robe; his Son sitting by him, with a Dove
between them: those men do but feed their eyes and adore the pictures with
dishonor of God, and injury to his divine nature, and is no likeness of God,
but only an imagination of man. b 1 King. 5 13.


Solomon, when he would build the material Temple, appointed sufficient
workmen to lay the foundation, and set up the whole frame; so when our Savior
Christ for framing his spiritual Temple, which is his Church; culled out such
as were necessary for the bulding of it: Ephesians. 4. 1^
gave some to be Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some
Pastors, and Teathers: he does not in this numeration so much as mention either
Engrauers in stone, Caruers in wood, Painters on walls, or workers in Metal;
therefore let Demetrius the Siluer-smith stand back, let Alexander the
Copper-smith bear him company.

-- procul hinc Zenxis procul esto Licippus. Let not Zeuxis come here with his
pensill, nor Licippus with his tools these may serve for some good use in
civil imploiments, but are but ciphers, and must go for naught in this
Arithmethick.

Their cunning workmanship may beguile men, as pigeons were beguiled by the
counterfeit, and flew to pigeons painted in the shop, as birds were beguiled by
Zeuxis painted grapes; as Zeuxis himself was beguiled by Parrhasius painted
sheet.

The God of heaven sees without eyes, hears without ears, walks without
feet, speaks without mouth; but the gods of d Ps. 115. ^
the heathen have eyes and see not, ears and hear not, feet and walk not,
neither speak they thorough their throat: and as the painter may paint a
flower with fresh color, but not with sweet savor with this motto: no further
then colors; so the Caruer may draw out an image, but not make it draw in the
breath with this motto, no further then fashion. But such was the cunning of
the craftests men, the craft of the Priests, the simplicity of the people, that
men did think, they did see, did hear, did go, did speak; and therefore in
Elyas time, 1 King. 18 26.
they called on the name of Baal: saying, O Baal hear us, and cried loud as
though he had slept and must be awaked. And in the time of King Henry the
eight, when these idolatrous stocks were broken in pieces, the false iuglings
were found out; and the engines espied, which made their eyes to open and role
about, and other parts of their body to stir; Oh but they be lay men's
books, and where as the Bible to them that cannot read is as a sealed letter,
images be letters patents, they lie open to every one, are written in folio,
that standing a far off they may read, they are great capital letters that
running men may read God, and the very sight of them does stir up a
maruailous devotion in men, women, and children. Indeed this was the cause why
Gregory the first, condemning their adoration, yet allowed their presence in
Churches tanquam essent memoracula, and rudium literae, as though in them dumb
lectures were read unto the people, and they might spell God in them. And more
then so, Concilium Cenonense agreed on this, that we might learn more in a
short while by an image, then by long study and travail in the Scriptures; but
against these I oppose Jonas, and Habakuk, as of greater authority, of which
Jonas says, Ion. 4. 8.
They are lying vanities, not only for that they proceed from the father of
lies, but for that, as Habakuck says, Hab. 2. 18
they teach lies, teaching us to take the creature for the Creator: a thing of
nothing, for that which is infinite; teaching us to hope where nothing is to be
expected.

But Idolators grace their Idols with glorious titles, as to say to one, Esaias.
44. 17.
Thou art my God: Es. 41. 29.
whereas it is nothing but wind and confusion: to another thou art my helper,
whereas there is no help in it, whereas they are all such gods as Virgill
says, Aeneas brought from Troy, which he calls vanquished:

-- victosque Penates: But let it be granted, that images are laymens books,
yet because they are not allowed but prohibited; who dare print them for the
service of God, or who dare keep them contrary to Proclamation, and not rather
say of them, as Judah of Thamar: Genesis 38. 24.
bring ye her forth, and let her be burnt. Let God himself appointe how he
will be served, let it be man's part to be ruled by his direction.

I read of a great man, I think it was Manlius, who sending his son to
war against his enemy, gave him a commission, by virtue whereof he was
charged what to do; when and where to set upon the enemy; but the son
espying advantage as he thought, and seeing hope of conquest, if he did borrow
a point of the commission, was bold to follow his own course, and indeed got
the victory: but returning home, and expecting great commendation, after his
cause was decided at Rome; he was put to execution. I may err in some
circumstance for want of memory, but I know, this is the substance of the
story; now our life is a war-faring upon earth, three mighty camps enuiron us,
the World, the Flesh, and the Infernal forces; if the Greeks be gone, there
is a Sinon within that, will betray them the place; God has set down a law,
and prescribed us how we shall fight, and under whose colors; he will be our
General: we must fight under his banner, to serve under him in Baptism: we
took our presse-mony, if now we seek many inventions, and follow other
colors, though they be such, as in our opinion might help us to the
obtaining of the victory; yet are we punishable for breach of obedience. God
will not allow these books, no not for laymen, he allows no other books, but
the golden book of grace, Ioh. 5. 39
Search the Scriptures, for they are they which testify of me: and the godly
book of Nature, which is bound up in the three large volumes; 1. the heavens,
Ps. 19 1
for they declare the glory of God. 2. The earth, for Ps. 33. 5.
that is full of the goodness of the Lord. 3. The sea, Ps. 104. 25.
for therein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts: He
that cannot read in the first, cannot choose but read in the second, though it
were but once printed and never since translated; yet all Nations, Languages,
and Tongues must needs read in it; therein every creature is a letter, every
day a line, every night a new leaf, neither can any manmetry, any Carpenters
chips, any sacred blocks, or puppets of wood, which every boy can make, after
he has been a while apprentise with a caruer in wood, put us more in mind of
God.

If we would enter into due consideration, then the wonderful frame of man's
body created by God, in which the bones are the timber-worke, the head is the
upper lodging, the eyes as windows, the eie-lids as caseme^ts; the brows as
penthouses, the ears as watch-towers, the mouth as a door to take in that
which shall uphold the building, and keep it in reparations, the stomach as
a kitching to dress that which is conveyed into it: the guts and baser parts
as gutters and sinkes belonging to the house, compare now this workmanship
with that of an image, and happily in the one we may commend the cunning of
the crafts-man; but we do not marvel much at his work, for that we know an
other his crafts master, can do the like, can hew, can carue, can polish, and
varnish as well as he. But consider man in whose framing, God is the principal
agent, our carnal parents but instruments, and that in framing the baser part
only, that is the body, not the more principal part, which is the soul; for
that God created without them; consider that man is not only a little world,
as the world is a great man, but an Epitome; both of God, who is a spirit, and
the world, which is a body. Then though we be not like Phauorinus, who
maruailed at nothing in the world besides man, at nothing in man besides his
mind, ( Ps. 139. 14.
for wonderful are thy works O God, Ps. 104. 24.
in wisdom have thou made them all) yet as most astonished at this work,
which is as Gods text, and all other creatures commentaries upon it, we say
who is like unto thee O Lord? none can do as thou do.

But say, Images are books, and say further, that they are seen and allowed,
and that they come forth cum gratia and priuilegio; yet books serve only to be
read, if they be kneeled unto and worshipped, if we vow unto them or bow unto
them, then are they made Idols, and why shall they not then be broken in
pieces. And indeed so prone we are to idolatry, that our nature is occupied and
fixed on those things, which lie before our eyes, rather then on those which
are not seen: and then our inward wits be most fervent, when our outward
senses be least troubled, and therefore let true religion labor as much to
take away these blockish books which are so much abused, and which do so much
steal away our hearts, as Papistry took pain to pull away English books, and
(thrusting on Christians for a benefit, which the Esaias. 28. 11.
Lord laid on the Jews for a punishment) to ouershadow with mists and darkness
the sunshine of the word, making it appear like sackcloth, which seen, read,
and preached, is able to carue the true image of God in our hearts.

I speak not this, as though images and pictures might not be made, to
represent man, or any other creature; but we must not make them to our selves,
or set them up for any devotion to worship God by them.

The beginning of Images, was nimius amor amicorum, nimius timor tirannorum;
too much love of friends: and so Ninus King of Assyria; some 2055 years before
Christ's incarnation: caused the image of his disceased father Belus to be
drawn; thereby to keep his countenance better in remembrance; so Xenophanes,
among the Egyptians; after his son was dead, caused his image to be made for
his comfort; and so far the image is tolerable. But when that which at first
was taken only for solace, grew at length unto holiness, and the servants
thorough flattery adorned it with garlands, and in continuance of time
worshipped it as God; then was neither it, nor the like sufferable, but to be
plucked down; as 2. Kin. 18. 4.
Ezechias to his great commendation broke in pieces the brazen serpent; though
it were commanded to be set up by God, when the people burnt Incense unto it,
God is the Lord, that is his name, Esa. 42. 8
his glory he will not give to another, nor his praise to graven images, and
this brings me into the second part of my subdiuision, to wit, we must not be
liberal of another bodies goods in giving Gods glory to others.

Thou shall not bow down to them nor worship them, they must neither have
(...), nor (...), neither the greatest, nor the least honor, we must neither
^ow the body nor bend the soul unto them: In Elyas time, God acknowledged none
for his, but 1. Kin. 19. 18.
they which bowed not the knee to Baall; and did not kiss him with their
mouths. 2. Kin. 5. 18.
Naaman confesses this a fault, that he should bow himself in the house of
Rymmon, and cries God mercy for that he shall fall into it: Dan. 3. 18
The three children Sidrach, Misach, and Abednego, will not use any reverence
with bodily gesture in falling down and worshipping the golden image which
Nabucadnezzar set up.

The image of a Prince, is then honored when his person is absent, but a man
does not turn to and worship the image in presence of the Prince: Now God
fills all places, and we may say of every place as Jacob of Bethell, Genesis
28. 16.
Surely the Lord is in this place, and therefore let his image alone.

The workman is ever better then the work, as, Heb. 3. 3.
he that builds the house, has more honor then the house: now Psa. 13. 5.
15^
the images of the ^eathen; are silver and gold even the work of men's hands:
Ba^. 6. 45.
Carpenters, and Golde-smithes, make them, neither be they any other thing; but
even what the workman will make them, neither is there any grace in the image
that comes not from the Caruer. If now the workman be better then his work,
which he graceth or disgraceth at his pleasure; and no man boweth to the
workman, why then should they kneel to the work of his hands? If any handy
work were to be worshipped, it were the work of Gods hands; either man, Psa.
8. 6. 5
for he has put all things under his feet, or Angels for he has made them
superiors to man: But Peter Act. 10. 25
took up Cornelius when he fell down at his feet, and showed to much
reverence as though Peter had been a God, and Act. 14. 14.
Barnabas and Paul renting their clothes, took up the men of Lystra more
roundly, when they heard they would do sacrifice unto them, and the Angel
said unto John; Reu. 19. 10.
See thou do it not, when he fell before his feet to worship him: The devil
indeed would purchase at a great price, that which men and Angels refuse, being
given unto them, and as Caffrani a people in India, worship devils in most
terrible figure; believing that they are permitted of God to punish or spare
them at their pleasure: And as in China they put the devils picture before a
sick man, that he may learn to know him in another world, and take him for
his friend, so the devil would have Christ, fall down and worship him, and to
bring this to pass; he makes him large offers: (but he cuts large thongs in
another man's hyde) he promises him Kingdoms, to see if an omnia dabo; will
bring him on his knees: Mat. 4. 9.
All these will I give thee, if thou will fall down and worship me, of which
words Gorran says pretily, Been dicitur, (cadens adoraberis) quia nunquam
sine casu diabolus adoratur, he says well, when he says if thou will fall
down and worship me, for the devil is never worshipped without a shameful
fall: Heathen men did reverence the Sun and the Moon and the Stars. But
God, ( Genesis 1. 16.
though these were his creatures) Deu. 4 19
will not allow them any part of his worship, the Sun is a servant, the Moon
is an hand-mayde, the Stars are made for man's use? What is more unseemly then
that the sons of God should worship the Sun which is the servant of the whole
world? If we may not worship the creatures themselves, which are Gods handy
work, much less may we serve the shadows of those creatures, prepared by art
to resemble the Creator; Neither their matter, which make the best of it, is
Ex. 20. 23
but gold and silver, neither the form which is but the skill and draught of
the Crafts-man: say there may be an historical use in paynting the images, as
the West Church used images as Ornaments and Monuments for the ruder sort
thereby to learn the lives and death of ancient and undoubted Martyrs, yet is
it no piety to worship the picture, say it may be used for remembrance, for
religion it may not. Deu. 19. 14.
It was a great fault to remove the land-marke, Deu. 27. 17.
there is a curse upon him that does it, but they which transgress the bounds
of their duty in serving Idols, Hos. 5. 10
are like them that remove the mark, and though a stone might be set up to
bound ground from ground, yet if any imagery were wrought in it, if it were
consecrated, if men putting religion in it, worshipped God in the stone, Leu.
26. 1.
then it was forbidden: God is a husband, the Church is his spouse, the one
must perform that office in faith, which the other in flesh, the desire of the
woman must be to her husband, the appetite of the Church must be unto God: when
Serapion in time of persecution for fear of death offered sacrifice to an
Idol, the faithful being there with offended put him out of the congregation,
and gave him over to Satan; If sedition arise among any people, and the
contagion thereof spread it self far and nigh, only the ringleaders and chief
doers are punished, but if inhabitants of a t Deu. 13. 13.
City be drawn to idolatry all the inhabitants must be slain with the sword,
and though women are the weaker vessels, and therefore more to be borne
withal, yet in this case Deu. 17. 5.
the woman as well as men must dye the death.

God would not suffer the Jews to make themselves any other King to rule over
them, then such a one Deu. 17. 15.
as should come out of the bosom of the Church, that true religion might be
maintained among them: The Israelites must bring their offering to the door of
the Tabernacle, Leu. 17. 6. 7.
and the Priest only must offer the beasts, that this way the people might be
bridled; that they did not lay themselves open to devils.

Nu^. 33. 4
God did execute his judgments upon the Gods of Egypt, which makes for the
commendation of true religion, lest the children of Israel should incline to
the superstition of other nations.

The Country, and the house of Laban was stuffed with superstition, God
therefore says unto Jacob Genesis 31. 13.
I am the God of Bethel, to teach him to walk religiously in the midst of an
idolatrous generation.

If it should be said, God is in this world, we being carnal would fasten him
to a pillar or mountain, and therefore that we might pass beyond our
fantasies Job. 22. 12
Elypbaz says, that God dwells in heaven.

Ios. 24. 15
Joshua bids Israel make choice of him, whom they will serve; and shows his
own resolution, that if afterward they should follow Idols, it might turn to
their shame; since they had bound themselves, to serve the Lord with their own
consent.

The distrustful man preferring his five wits, before the four Evangelists,
will not believe God upon his word, and therefore Job. 17. 3
God must get some other creditor, except he leave a pawn with him, but the
Idolater is worse then he, for the one does not honor God, but the other sets
up an other God against him.

A fountain has water in it self, and has no need to receive it from other,
but gives it to other: a cesterne has no water of it self, but remains
empty, except there be some brought unto it from some other place: A fountain
from whence water springs naturally is not dried up, but let other drink of
it, yet it still sends out little streams; but take water out of a cesterne
or pit, the more ye take, the less it has, and at length it will be clean
empty. A fountain still sends forth fresh water and healthful, but let
cisterne or pitwater stand a while, it stinkes and is unwholesome, God is a
fountain of living waters, Ier. 2. 10. 11. etc.
Idols are pittes even broken pittes that can hold no water, God therefore
maruaileth, as at a thing that was never seen before, that his people should
change the one for the other, and in stead of him, serve Idols which did not
profit them, but turned to their own decay.

Nu^. 35. 2
When the other Tribes had their portion, each Tribe by it self, the Leuits
were scattered in the land, that keeping watch and ward, they might see that no
superstition crept in among the people.

God would have all the Inhabitants of the land of Canaan rooted out. One
reason was lest Israel joining with them, might deprive themselves of the
lawful inheritance, which God had appointed for them. An other reason, lest
those incredulous Nations the Amorites, Canaanites, the Hittites, and the rest
should pollute the land: but a principal reason was, Ex. 34. 11
lest they should allure the elect people of God to the worship of false Gods,
and to the busying of themselves in their doting fancyes.

This serves to rebuke the Papacy, which even from the Alpha to the Omega
thereof, is nothing but error and superstition: it serves to reprove Julian,
who ordained that no Christian might take degree in School, keep lecture,
read any art, or be admitted to study, unless he did worship the Idols: to
reprove wicked Hest. 3. 9.
Haman, who in a manner offers all his goods to satisfy his lusts, and
uphold Idolatry, when he would not have given a dodkin to the service of God:
To reprove some people of Affricke, who worship that which they meet first in
the morning; supposing the same for that day to be their God: to reprove the
Assyrians, who worshipped as many gods as they had Towns: To reprove the
Persians, who had as many gods as there were Stars in the sky: to reprove
Alexander, who having subdued the Persians made men worship him as god: to
reprove the Saracens, who sacrifice in mount Mecha to Abraham, Isaac, and Saint
Thomas: to reprove the Egyptians, who besides their other gods, deified their
King Apis, forbidding all men upon pain of death, to say he was a man: to
reprove that Council of the Greeks at Frankeford, who said, that he, that
fears God, adoreth an image as he would the Son of God, with that worship
which is due to the Original: to reprove Orphey, Homer, and Hosiodus, who
first brought gods into Greece, and did set down their petigrees in writing,
giving them names and sir-names, and appointing them honors at their pleasures.

Again on the contrariside, this serves for the commendation of Jacob, Ge^.
35. 4.
who in token of detestation buried the Idols under an Oak, for the
commendation of Moses, Ex. 32. 20
who ground the golden Calfe unto powder; for the commendation of Pythagoras,
who condemned Orphy, Homer, and Hesiodus, for their so damnable diuices; for
commendation of Charles K. of France, who above 800 years ago called a great
Synod of the Bishops of France, Italy, and Germany at Frankeford, where the
second general Council of Nice, which two years before decreed it lawful to
worship images, was rejected and refured; for commendation of that Synod in
Greece, where 330 Bishops at Constantinople condemned reuerencing of images.

Zac. 10. 2
For they speak vanity, and Ion. 2. 8.
they that wait upon lying vanities, forsake their own mercy; and therefore
Ex. 23. 24
God will have them utterly overthrown, and will not have us serve them,
either in praying to them, in Canonizing them, or swearing by them; not in
praying to them, for when the faithful speak the best they can for themselves
without boasting, they say, Ps. 24. 20
they have not held up their hands to a strange God, and how could the heathen
blaspheme the true God more, then to worship false gods with prayer, when they
had dedicated their Temples unto them, and to say, as they did to Jupiter,
Whether thou be god or goddess, we call upon thee? Oh but experience
shows, that prayers unto images have been happy for success, and have been
so far from coming weeping home, that they have laden our heads with a
blessing, they have been as a key to open the lock, when God has shut out his
mercies from us; yea but they are but fabulous legends which the papists
allege in this kind.

Indeed I read, that in the time of King Henry the fixed, there came from
Barwicke to Saint Albones a beggar with his wife, both affirming that he was
borne blind, and being warned in a dream to seek Saint Albon for his eyes, he
was as he said; come thither, the Saint at first lent but a deaf ear to his
prayers, but at length at his shrine he recovered his sight, a miracle was
solemnly ronge; Te Deum song, and what more talked off in all the Town then
this miracle? What say you now, is it not well done to bestow some part of our
time in a set course of prayer to Saints, to be clyents to them, that they may
be helpers to us? I answer, bad dealing has many times steps whereby it may be
traced out.

Julius Caesar conveyed 3000 pound weight of pure gold out of the Treasury in
Rome, and laid in the like weight of copper gilded, but this was bewraied by
the touch: Lysander picked a great sum of gold, out of the bottom of a bag
(for the mouth was sealed) and sewed it skilfully up again, but this theft was
discovered by a Bille still remaining in the bag: this beggar played the
dissembling rogue, and his dissimulation was espied by his own confession:
for Duke Humfrey, then Lord Protector going about to persuade him, that he
could not see, the beggar, to prove his sight good, told him the names of all
the colors that could be showed him, which he could not have done, except he
had known them before (though he might see the colors were diverse) no more
then the names of all the men that he should suddenly see.

If such virtue be in the Saints, as they fabulously suppose, then in
perplexity, what need the superstitious man use old wives, and Stars for his
Counselors, he may ask counsel of of the Saints, as Hos. 4. 12
Israel did at their stocks, and at their sticks? in danger, what need his
night spell? the Saints may be his guard; in sickness, what need he charms?
the Saints may be his physicians: what need he Paracelsian characters for his
tooth each? a word to Saint Apolline is present remedy: then what need hollowed
wax as an Antidote against all evils, when several Saints can in counter
several evils; if men do but pray unto them? nae then let ordinary means for
any grief be set apart, let not him that is troubled with the falling
sickness, use any longer to eat the flowers of Rosemary, crumbs of rye bread,
and honey meddled well together, for Saint Cornelis (though he carries a recept
but for one cure) can help that evil, if he does but pray unto him.

But these are all but fopperies, and wicked superstition, have any of these,
which promise great help, approved their skill to their credulous patients? I
say of them, as Job does of his friends; Job. 16. 2
Miserable comforters are ye all, they know not, what particular miseries men
upon earth are entangled and clogged with, how then can they cure them? but
say, that some sick and diseased have recovered after prayers made unto Saints
(as Lewis the French King, being so sick, that some supposed he was dead,
after prayers made by the Bishop of Paris and others there present, and after
Queen Blanch his mother had blessed him, with a piece of the holy Cross;
began with a sigh to pluck too his arms and legs, and so stretching
himself began to speak.) I say again have not many sick mended with their
physic in their pocket? I know where a sick patient sent to a physician for
his council, the physician wrote down a Recipe in a piece of paper, and sent
him word he must take that to do him good: the simple Patient hearing he
must take that, not thinking of the contents, did eat up the paper, and
shortly recovered his health, but what was it that wrought his recovery, was
it his Receipt? or was it not rather his conceit? or was it not rather strength
of nature in the Patient: (though I know a conceit may do much) rather then
any virtue in the one or in the other, so it may be some have mended after
they have been at Saints shrines, but has this come to pass by virtue in the
Saint, or not rather by the power of God, who heals all our infirmities; I
know a Saint many times had the thanks. And as that man in the Gospel was r
Ioh. 7. 23
to offer up unto God every member he had, because he had made him every whit
whole, so men were commonly wont to offer ears of wax to the Saint, who (as
they supposed) cured the ears, eyes of wax to the Saint that cured the eyes,
feet of wax the Saint that cured the feet, though it be only God, who
gives medecin to heal the sicknesses, and ease the grief 2 Cor. 1. 4.
who is ready to comfort us in all tribulation, and not the Saints, whom
therefore we must not worship with any adoration.

If they cannot help the body, much less can they cure the t Mat. 4. 2*
soul to cure this our Savior Christ used sundry sorts of medicines, as diet,
in his forty days fast, Electuary, Mat. ^^. 26.
in giving his body and blood at his last supper; Sweat, Luc. 22. 44.
which like drops of blood trickled down to the ground, Potion, Mat. 27. 48.
when they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall, Ioh 19. 34.
letting blond, when they peirced his hands and his feet, and when Longinus,
thrust a spear into his side, and strocke his heart vein, by his nativity, he
made himself in case able to work this cure, by circumcision he entered bond
for it, by blood at his passion he performed it. Blood is a great comfort to
nature, and hastes thither where is most need of succor, when a man
blusheth, it goes to the face, when he is afraid to dye it goes from the face
to the heart to comfort the heart, because it is distressed, and when we which
are members of Christ were as good as dead, it came from the head to the
members, for Revel ^. 5
he washed us in his blood, and therefore the Church of God may be called
Aceldama, because it is a field purchased by the blood of Christ, and therefore
we pray his blood be on us and our children, not as the Jews prayed, Mat. 27.
25.
his blood be upon us to revenge it, but his blood Reu. 1. 5.
be upon us to wash us, 1. Pet. 1. 19.
to redeem us, Heb. 9. 14
to sanctify us.

Leuit* 25. 10.
The year of Iubily was a figure of Luc. 4. 19
that acceptable year, and Mala. 4. 2

is conveyed unto us by the Sun in the firmament. He was that Dove which after
the flood of our sins brought a branch of Olyue, that is peace, and i Genesis 8.

mercy to the Arc, that is the Church, in the evening and end of the world.
The world is a sea, death is a hook, Christ is that fish, Mat. 17. 27.
in whose mouth was found a piece the price of our redemption, the tribute is
paid and we are delivered,

Number. 16. 48.
Aaron stood betwixt the living and the dead, Moses betwixt God and the people,
and 1. Tim. ^ 5.
Christ is a mediator betwixt God and us: A mediator, one that deals
privately for us, he is more then so, 1. Ioh. 2. 1
an advocate, one that comes to the bar in our cause; 2. Cor. 5. 19.
he is a reconcilation, one that in such sort deals betwixt God and us, that
he will not punish us, he is more then so, 1. Io. 2. 2.
he is a propitiation, one that deals so with God for us, that he will reward
us, this latter is more then the former, for King David is appeased toward
Absolon by means of Ioa^, after he had slain his brother Ammon, but 2. Sam.
14 24. 33.
yet let him see my face no more there is reconciliation, but in the end he
comes to the King and r the King kisseth him, there is propitiation: as he is
a mediator an advocate, a reconciliation, and propitiation; so is he our only
mediator, o^r only advocate, our only reconciliation, our only propitiation, he
is the only high Priest which entered before the Arc, where was the sign of
Gods presence, when all other were forbid to come near, the Heb. 7. 23
one Priest who by Heb. 10. 12.
one sacrifice Heb. 9. 28
once offered, has reconciled God to us. And us to know the original cause of
our death and damnation we must not range, beyond the fall of the first Adam,
for by him sin entered into the world and death, by the means of sin, so to
find our recovery we must not seek elsewhere then in the second Adam Christ
Jesus, for thorough him salvation is conveyed from the Father to all his living
members, as through the veins, life is conveyed from the heart to all the
vital parts. Ioh. 14. 6.
He is the way, the Kings high way to heaven, we have no whither to go but to
him, nor no other way but by him, no man can ascend but by him that did
descend, Genesis 28. 12.
he is Jacobs ladder, there is no other hy whom we can go up unto God, no
building without this stone, no perfume without this balm, no Pa^adise without
this tree, no God without this Christ, no entrance unto heaven without this
door, no saving from the flood without this Arc; he is the only Luc. 10.
Samaritan that powers in Oil to cure our wounds, the only rock Genesis 35. 14.
which Jacob anointed with Oil, and erected up for a title of peace between
God and men, the only vessel full of Oil, wherewith, 2. Kin. 4. 7
with the widow we must all pay our debts. Mat. 1. 25
Jesus is his name, Act. 4. 12.
and there is no other name under heaven whereby we can be saved, and therefore
he is not only called a savior but Luc. 2. 30
salvation it self, because he is the only Savior, as for Saints they are no
such saviors as can cure our evils in body, their letting blood cannot ease
the plurisie of our souls, and therefore as that man in the Gospel was to
worship Christ because Ioh. 7. 23.
he had made him whole every whit, so on the other side are not we to worship
Saints because they can not make us whole any whit.

The Church of Rome then is to be reproved, which worshipp the Virgin Mary
their Patroness and Protectresse, desiring her to exhibit to them the breast
of her grace (great babes* to suck our Ladies breast) attributing their happy
estate to the help of her medecin, acknowledging themselves servants of her
own inheritance and of her peculiar dowre, much such stuff may we find in the
Catholic Primer called our Ladies mattens, and in our Ladies Psalter made by
Bona^e^ture, to be said and song in the praise and service of our Lady, which
make her an advocate pray for the people, entreat for the Clergy, make
intercession for the devout woman-kinde. Which make her not only blessed her
self but a giver of blessedness to others, not a vessel but a fountain a
mother of grace and mercy: Neither shall the Virgin be alone in this service,
but other Saints shall bear her company, as Saint Nicholas, grant by his
merits and prayers we may be delivered from the fire of hell: as Mary Magdalen:
Let her purchase for us the bliss everlasting: And as Pilate mingled the blood
of the Galileans with their own sacrifice, that is killed them while they were
sacrificing, and so mingled their blood and the blood of the beasts together,
so they make their mixtures and their medleyes, mingling the blood of Christ
and of their Saints one with another as Beckets blood,

Tuper Thome (sanguinem, quem pro te impendit
Fac nos Christ, scandere, quo Thomas ascendit.
Thou by the blood of Thomas (speaking of Thomas Becket) which he for thee did
spend,
Make us, Christ to clime, whether Thomas did assend.
Thus do they extenuate the worthiness of Christ's death, in that they supply
the weakness thereof with the prayers and blood of their Saints, but as wax and
water cannot meet together; so Christ and any thing with Christ cannot meet in
the salvation of man; the blood of Saints defaceth the blood of our Savior,
and the impression of their prayers dasheth out the inscription of Christ. As
for the Saints themselves the Virgin confesses her Savior, and therefore
acknowledges her self a sinner, s Luc. 1. 47.
si peccatrix, non depre^atrix, qu^ egebat, non agebat ad^ocatum. Mary Magdale^
stood behind Christ weeping; she wept, this was an g Lu. 7. 38.
acknowledging of her fault, and now she would, that her eyes at which sin
had entered as at a window, might now let it out as at a door: she stood
behind him, as though she thought her self not worthy to behold him; and
again behind him, that God through Christ might look upon her, shall now any
stand behind her a sinner, that God thorough her may look upon them, or they
thorough her may look upon God? as for the blood of Saints, the heart blood of
the best of them could not merit for themselves, and therefore could no more
wash us from our sins, then 2 King. 5 14.
other waters besides Jorden could cleanse the leprosy of Naaman. And
therefore hunt not Mar. 5. 2. 3.
with the mad Cadar^n the graves of the dead, as they did Thomas Beckets tomb,
seek not among the Saints departed for mediators of redemption, no not of
intercession. God did not send the King of Gerar, to Noah or any of the dead
Fathers, but to Abraham then alive and present, Ge^. 20. 7.
he shall pray for thee: Indeed Brusierd says, if we pray to Saints
departed, they, as stricken with some compassion, may say the like to God for
us, as in the Gospel they did for the Canaanite, send her away, for she cries
after us: but I answer, if the Saints should have a feeling of our miseries,
then little Mat. ^5. 23
would be their ease, small would be their rest, and heaven would be no haven
of happiness. An other says, No man comes to an earthly Prince without making
means to some that are about him: but I answer, God respects not one person
more then an other, and therefore one need not an Attorney, rather then an other
to speak unto God, and therefore dashe out that subscription; which Anton^nus
says was used in his time, where Saint Paul and Friar Dominicke were painted
together, under the Image of Saint Paul was written; Per hunc itur ad Christum:
under the other, sed magis per istum: the like story we read of King Oswy, who
taking up the matter about celebrating Easter betwixt the East-Churches, which
received their rite of Saint John, and the West-Church which received theirs of
Saint Peter, judged with the West-Church, that is, the Church of Rome, lest (as
he said) gainsaying Peter the porter, none should open when he came to heaven
gate, if he were displeased that kept the keys. The prodigal Child did use no
other means to come into his fathers house, but Luc. 15. 20.
he himself did come to his father.

As we are not to worship Saints in praying unto them, so not giving that
honor unto them, which belongs only unto God: under the Law God appointed the
Jews three several n De^. 16. 9.
Feasts, the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles; the first in
remembrance that God spared their houses, when he slew the firstborn of the
Agyptians: the second in remembrance, that God gave them his Law, 50 days
after their departing out of Egypt: the third in remembrance that they dwelt
under tents and tabernacles forty years in the wilderness: but after the
Idolaters forged Feasts of their own heads, 1 King. 1^ 32.
as Jeroboam made a new holy day, in honor of the Calves which he had set up
at Dan and Bethel. Under the Gospel we celebrate Easter, Whit-sunday and other
festi^al days, the first in remembrance of the death and resurrection of
Christ; the second in remembrance of the sending of the holy Ghost, quod
abeuntem Christum non amisimus, and v^n^^tem Spirit^^ possidemus: other holy
days of Saints we keep to the ho^our of Christ, and not of them, as the
Anuntiation of the virgin, in remembrance that Christ was then conceived in her
womb; the Purification, in remembrance that Christ was then presented in the
Temple: Saint Peter's day as proper to Christ professed by Peter's mouth, Man.
16. 16.
Thou art Christ the Son of the living God: Saint John's day proper to Christ
published by his writing, and so of the rest, whose holy days our Churh does
most piously q Io^. 21. 24
and religiously bind us to observe: but after this, especially within this
500. years, the Pope that great god maker of Rome coined a great number of new
holy days, as the Feast of the Conception of the virgin Mary, which when the
Franciscan or gray Friars had newly found out in remembrance that she was
conceived without original sin, was established by Sixtus the fourth, who
sent forth his decree, commanding all men to solemnize the said Feast, himself
adding at the end of her, Aue, and b^nedicta sit Anna matertua, de qu^ sin^
macula, tua processit caro virginea, and to stop the mouths of the Dominicke
or black Friars, who (taking side with Peter Lombard, Tho. Aquinas, Bernard,
Bonauenture, and other School Doctors) taught that it was heresy to affirm
that she was conceived without guilt of original sin, they said, her flesh
might well proceed without this infection, for she was not concei^ed as
others were, and therefore they made a picture of I^achim and Anna kissing, by
which kiss Anna was conceived with the virgin Mary.

I omi^ here the feast of her Nativity, brought in by Innocent the fourth, the
Feast of her Assumption, brought in by Leo the fourth, the Feast of Corpus
Christi, ordained and confirmed by Clement the fifth, who assigned indulgences
to those that heard the service thereof.

For besides these, that great Saint-maker shrined a rabble of blind Saints of
his own creating, prescribing the same to be universally received in the whole
world, and binging them as holy children of Rome, into his Romish Calender,
some with a Festum duplex, some with a Festum simplex, and celebrating his
double and simple feasted Saints. He commonly appointed a vigill before them,
that they might as well be honored with a fast, as with a feast; but what were
they, that he did thus dignifie, that did fi^d such place or favor with him,
that they should be canonized and deified, and being set down in red or black
colors: should be called upon for gifts and graces, and be worshipped for
Aduocat^ and Mediators? were they not commonly some Popes, or some rich
Bishops, or some fat Abbots, or some blind Friars, Monks or Nuns, some builders
of Monasteries, or such as had stood for the dignities and liberties of the
papists Church. What made Innocent the third to Saint Friar Dominicke and
confirm his order of Preaching Friars, but that dreaming that the Church of
Lateran was ready to fall, Dominicke with his shoulders did underprop it? why
was Thomas Becket, fifty years after his death taken up and shrined for a new
Saint, made of an old rebel; but that he died for the ambitious liberties of
the holy Church? had not that deformed Gilbert of S^mpringham in Lincolneshire,
erected many Monasteries 13 to the dossen, he had never been numbered in the
Catalogue of Saints, neither would Pepe Innocent himself have made that
blasphemous Collect in his honor, wherein he prays that we being succored
by his suffrages may be delivered from all diseases of our souls.

I will not here rehearse any more particulars, lest the reader should blame me
as much, for stuffing my paper with this route, rifraffe and rablement of
Saints, as I do find fault with the Pope, for placing them in his Calender.
He that will know more, may find them dispersed in Pantaleons Chronographie,
and in the Acts and Monuments of the Church, only this: the year was cumbred
with so many idle holy days, and the Calenders with so many rascal Saints,
some of them as good as ever were they, that put Christ to death; that Simon I
slip (though he were made* Archbishop of Canterbury, by the Pope, to wit, by
Clement the sixth) by his letters patent directed to all Persons and Vicars
within his Province, straightly charged them and their Parishioners under pain
of Excommunication, that they should not abstain from bodily labor upon
certain Saints days, which before were wont to be hallowed and consecrated to
unthrifty idleness, afterward were more put down by Iniunction, in the Reign
of King Henry the eight.

Concerning those therefore that are departed, let our remembrance of them
shortly depart after them: Varr^ thinks that death was called Iethum (...),
that is, forgetfulness, because they which have now forgotten all the world,
should soon be forgotten of the world: on the one side, if they were bad, do
not so much as bring forth thy tears upon them, they of the Kings stock, in
the Prophet Jeremy, shall not lament Ieho^akim; saying, Ier. 22. 18
Ah my brother, neither shall they mourn for him, saying, ah Lord, or ah, his
glory, let him that lives without love, dye without tears, without piety,
except we say, it was pity, he died no sooner. Again if their lives were
black, do not we paint their sepulchers with white colors: yet withal, if
any good inch were in them, disdain we as much to derogate any thing from
them, as we would scorn to rob an Hospital: set not thy foot on a carcass,
scourge not a dead man, fight not with a shadow; be not like the dogs, which
bite the stones cast at them, when they cannot touch those that hurt them. The
Papist finds in his Mass to pray for the dead, but not to play upon them;
fie upon Pope Stephen the sixth, whose lightning being kindled against the dead,
took up the Carcass of his predecessor Formosus out of the grave, brought it
to judgment before a Council of Bishops, spoiled it of all Papal robes,
clothed it with a laymans garments, endited it, arraigned it, condemned it,
cut off three fingers of it, and cast it into the River. On the other side, if
they which are diseased were good men, take up a little while David's
Lamentation for Jonathan, weep with Saint Ambrose, both because they are gone
before thee to glory, and because the Church has lost such laborers in the
vineyard; but let sadness bewray rather a tender then dejected mind, and let
the felicity wherein they are now placed exchange the sorrow of thy loss into
rejoicing of their gain, commending the virtues that were in them, break a
box of spikenarde among others, and fill their ears with some part of that
sweet perfume which they left behind them, praise the^ when as good sea men
they are come to the haven, when as good warriors they are come to the
triumph: lastly if thou have Phil. 4. 8. 9.
learned and received and heard, and seen in them, (that I may use the Apostles
words) any thing that is true, honest just pure, pertaining to love, and of
good report, praise God for it; think on it, and imitate it in thy self,
follow their good ^cts in thy living, as they followed Christ in their lives:
Honoramus eos charitate non seruitute, says Saint Augustine, give therefore
unto the Saints thy tears, give them their praise, give them the honor of
imitation, less thou can not give, more thou may not, and more do they
not desire, Nol^ut enim fic honorari a nobis etc.

Lastly we are not to communicate Gods worship with Saints in swearing by
them, for herein we make them not so much lower then God, as God has made us
lower then Angels: hereby we confess their wisdom, their justice, their
power; see all this in one oath of the Romans, among whom this was a custom,
he that swore, held in his hand a stone, saying: The City with the gods thereof
being safe, so Jupiter cast me out of it, if I deceive willingly, as I cast
from me this stone.

Here they attribute unto Jupiter wisdom, acknowledging that he sees the
secret conceit of the heart, their deceit, and whither their deceit be a
willing deceit; 2. power, that he can, and 3. justice that he will punish
their perjury, if they swear not in truth: and therefore God threatens, that
they shall fall, and never raise up again (which was 1 Samuel 4. 18.
old Hely his fall): Amos 8. 14.
which swear by the sin of Samaria, that is, by the Idols, which the
Samaritans worshipped and that say, thy God, O Dan lives, and he will cut off
them, Zep. 1. 5.
which swear by the Lord, and swear by Malcham; neither might the Judge admit
an oath, y Ios 23. ^
that any should take by their Idols. Nae the holy Ghost will not have us give
so much honor to them, as to mention them with our lips, and therefore it is
probable that Ios. 18. 14
Kiriath Baal* was called Kiriath-Iearim, that the name of the Idol might be
forgotten and not honored so much, as with the naming of it, and Socrates in
desp^ght of those Heathen gods did swear by an Oak, a Goat, a Dog, as
though he denied less godhead to be in those gods then in the least creatures.

This serves to reprove the Turk, whose oath is this, I swear by God the
maker of heaven and earth, and the 4. Historiograp^ers of Evangelical
Histories, and by the 8000 Prophets that came from heaven, and by our mighty
god Mahomet, above all other to be worshipped; and by the spirits of my father
and Grandfather, and by this my sac^ed and imperial head. It serves to
reprove Ch^^st^ans, who by their oaths lay open Gods honor to the spoil of
creatures, and (though it be a thing forbidden by flat statute) beautify and
set our the Saints with the ornaments of his name. Let not therefore the name
of Saints wait upon our wor^es, to serve where our humor shall place them,
let us not fill our mouths with them, as though the sentence were not full, if
they were left out, let not Oaths by Saint An. by Saint Mary, by Saint George,
or other fly at all adventures and wait at the heels of every word; these and
other oaths are but custom in the elder sort, imitation in the younger sort,
bravery in the rich, necessity in the poor, no pleasure in them, no profit of
them, and sins clothed with no delight or gain are less excuseable even in
the sight of men.

As wear not to impart Gods worship with Saints, so not with relics of
Saints, which Clement the 5. thought were to be bad in the highest veneration;
Heb. 11. 22.
Joseph gave commandment of his bones, and Genesis 50. 25.
lying on his death bed took an oath of the children of Israel to carry his
bones with them out of Egypt, least (as Chrysostom says) the Egyptians
remembering the good c Deu. 34. 6
things he had done should use the good man's body to an occasion of Idolatry,
God buried Moses body the Jews knew not where, one reason was, left they
should bring his carkeis into the land of Canaan, from which he was excluded by
the judgment of God; another reason was that by this means, he might meet
with all and prevent their superstition, for therefore (says D. Raynolds) it
may be thought, that the devil, when he did strive with Michaell about the
body of Moses, did strive that his body might be revealed to the Jews, that
thereby they might have occasion to commit idolatry: when a miracle was wrought
at the martyring of Policarpus, the Centu^ion would not have his body divided,
least the remnants of the dead corpse should be worshipped of the people:
Indeed if that were true that the bones of Siluester the 2. did commonly ratle
in his tomb before the death of Popes, (for this they say the rattling of his
bones does portend) then there were some reason why they should be esteemed,
but his bones are used like Dice, made of women's bones to cozen a man, and no
such rattling indeed, and therefore let this rattling lie be buried with them.
The Israelites must reserve nothing of the Paschall lamb, lest d Ex. 12. 10
they should mix that holy banquet with their daily bread, 2. lest the sight
of raw flesh might make it less esteemed, 3. lest any superstition might
creep in by reserving the relics, and therefore the very bones must be
burnt, and more then so, Ex. 32. 20
Moses took the sin of Israel and the calfe which they had made, and
ground it to powder, and strowed it upon the water, and made the children of
Israel drink of it, both in despite of their idolatry, and that there might
remain no monument thereof, lest they which were most given to superstition
might gather together the relics.

This serves to reprove such, as while they live, appoint or observe any
festival day in honor of relics, as Pope Innocent, who ordained the feast
of the holy spear, and of the holy nails; and though we do well to observe
the seventh day, that thereby we may learn to rest from sin that day, and make
the rest of the week suitable to the same, yet to make more reckoning of one
Sabbath then another in regard of relics, and to have our Gaudees and feasts
on relic Sunday, as they call it, cannot be without sent of superstition:
Again it reproves such, as when they dye think relics will help them the
sooner to heaven: as those which are of this mind, that if they be buried in a
Gray Friars frocke, the third part of their sins shall be forgiven them,
which dignity was indeed granted by a Bull to that religion. But never think
that these, nor Saint Peter's Cope or his other vestiments can be a quittance
for our debts, they are pallium breue, not talaris tunica, a short cloak, not
a gown long enough to hide our sins, only the coat of Christ without seame
can cover them all: Esa. 43. 25.
I, even I, am he that puts away thine iniquities for mine own sake, where
even as God excludes all other motives, when he says for mine own sake, so
he excludes all other means when he says, I, and that with an ingemination,
even I do it. He has grace, if we sin, Ephesians. 2. 7.
riches of grace if our sins be great, exceeding riches of grace, if they be
many: 1. Tim. 1. 13.
mercy for Paul, for he did it ignorantly, Psa. 51. 1.
great mercy for David, for he sinned willingly, he can pardon, for his mercy
is omnipotent, he will pardon, for his omnipotency is meryfull, as for relics
they come short of his mercy that remitteth sins, and come not near the
value of that ransom, which was paid for them.

The Mass, wherein is consecration, transubstantiation, missall oblation, and
adoration, is a great Idol, and should have as little worship as these
relics; much virtue (as I have already showed) was attributed to it, whereas
in very deed there was no virtue in it, it could not so much as defend it
sacrificer who in some place of this land in the reign of Queen Mary was
beset with Swords and Bucklers, lest he should be disturbed in his missall
sacrifice, to blame also therefore were they which did fly to it for succor:
neither did men think it only present help for themselves, but if their
pigges were sick, they had a Mass called the Mass of Saint Anthony to rid
them from their diseases, another for their Hens that were sick and lost:
again to blame were men to use it for the conversion of those which were
thought heretics, as did Anthony Kechin Bishop of Landaffe in Queen Maryes
days: to use it for delivering of souls out of purgatory as did Odilo Abbot
of Cluniake, who thought that his Masses had delivered diverse souls from
thence, saying more over that he did hear the voices and lamentations of
devils crying out, for that the souls were taken from them by the Masses and
Dirges funeral: by reason whereof Pope John the 19: brought in the feast of
all souls. Again to blame were they to use it, and offer it up as a sacrifice
for remission of sins for the quick and for the dead: Besides to blame was
Urban the 4. to appoint festum Eucharistia in honor of it: lastly to blame were
all they, who did use to swear so often by it, that custom being almost
turned into nature, they could scarce leave it, if all these were to be blamed,
then when the Mass with the appurtenances thereof (by reason of Mass Priests)
preasing upon us Genesis 19. 9.
as the Sodomites upon Lot shall go about to break up the door of our
hearts, and stepping in shall labor to have some part of Gods honor, say as l
Let to his sons. Get Genesis 19. 14.
you out of this place; what portion have ye with the God of Jacob? To your
tents, ye cursed brood of an adultrous and Antichristian generation.

The Cross in time of superstition was made as great an Idol as the Mass,
and comes likewise within the compass of this prohibition, Thou shall not bow
down to them nor worship them; I will not here mention one half of the
miracles which I have read, were wrought by it: only this, in the Catholic
Primer called our Ladies mattens, we read this of Saint Laurence, Saint
Laurence the Deacon did work a good work, for by virtue of the holy Cross he
gave sight to the blind etc. But here by the way* I will overthrow the
Catholic at his own weapon, and 2. Sam. 23. 21.
with Benaiah slay the Egyptian with his own spear, for how could Saint
Laurence give sight by virtue of the Cross, when as he was dead many years
before the Cross was found, for Laurence, Claudius Se^erus, Crescentius,
Hippolytus and Romanus were made Martyrs, Anno 265. or a little before, and
Saint Helen the mother of Constantine first (as they say) found the Cross Anno
325. which was 60. years after he was dead. Besides Ioh. 9. 32
never any man opened the eyes of one that was borne blind besides Christ,
therefore could not Laurence do it by the Cross, to blame therefore were the
Papists to worship the Cross in praying to it and saying. O God which have
ascended thy most holy Cross, and given light to the darkness of the world,
vouchsafe by the virtue of thy Cross, to illumine, visit, and comfort both our
hearts and bodies: And again.

All hayle, O cross, our only hope, in this time of the passion.
Increase thou justice to the godly, and give to sin^ers pardon.
To blame were they which did appoint festival days for the celebration of
it, as Pope Eusebius, who is said to ordain the feast of the invention of the
Cross, though it was not found, as some say, till Siluesters time; the next
Pope after him, and Honorius the 1. who ordained the exaltation of the Cross
to be celebrated, both it feasts, were, and yet are among us called the two
holy R^^de days; Lastly they are to blame that swear by it, Ier. 5. 7.
for how shall God spare us for this, if we forsake him, and swear by Idols,
by the Mass, by the Cross, by them that are no gods? But as some are to blame
in attributing to much unto the Cross, so other are to blame in detracting too
much from it. Theodosius went too much on the one hand, and was too
superstitious, when gathering a Council together, he made a Law, that no man
should make a cross upon the ground, or upon a marble, or any stone which
should be laid upon the ground; lest men should perhaps tread upon it with
their feet. The Turk went too much on the other hand, who when he had taken
the City of Constantinople, and found there in the high Temple of Sophia the
image of the Crucifix, writing this superscription upon the head of it, hic est
Christianorum Deus, i. the God of the Christians, gave it to his soldiers to
be scorned, and commanding it to be carried through all his Army with a
trumpet, made every man in most contumelious sort to spit at it. In medio
tutissimus ibis, it is good to keep the midway betwixt these two, like Sir
John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, who being asked what honor he would do to the
holy Cross, answered (as it is in his examination set down by Master Fox) if
it were his, he would lay it up honestly, he would only do it this honor, he
would make it clean and lay it up safe: and concerning other Idols, as on the
one side there was a fault in Marcellina (whom therefore Irenaus, Epiphanius,
and Augustine reckoned and detested as an Heretic) to have images in her
closet, to set garlands on their heads, and burn incense to them: So on the
other side there was a fault in the Jews, who forbad theirs to drink of that
fountain, whose water spowteth out of the image of man or woman, lest that
bowing down their head to the water-pipe* they should seem to worship the
image, and therefore, they say, Mardochee would not bow his knee before Haman,
lost he might seem to worship an image; for they fable, that Haman wore a
certain golden picture about his neck. On this side there was a fault in the
Pharisees, the great Masters of Israel, and such as excelled the rest for
Piety, for they (as Doctor Hall in a Sermon at Paul's Cross) taught their
disciples, that if in their travail an Image were in the way, to fetch about
some other way, if they must needs go that way, to run, if a thorn should
light in their foot near the place, not to kneel* but to sitdown and pull it
out, lest they should seem to give it reverence. The mean is sweetest melody,
too much of the best is evil and excess in virtue vice, it is no good sign if
Nilus ouerflow less then 12 cubits, or more then 18; there is a measure for
Manna, gather not to much, gather not too little; run past the goal, thou art
accounted rash, run but half way, thou art accounted slow: go too much on
the one side, thou returnest into Egypt, go to far on the other, thou art
carried away to Babylon, the counter poize of the heart is framed by God, like
an even and just pair of Balance, turn not therefore to the right hand or to
the left: spit not at the Crucifix with the Turk, kneel not to it with the
Papists, the one with Zachee is to low, and therefore Luc. 19. 4
must climb up, the other with the same Zachee is to high, and therefore must
come down, or else Christ will never dine at his house.

I will not speak here of their fire, waterincense, wax, bread, wine, the
Church, the altar, the Churchyard, Ashes, Belles, Copes, Palms, Oil,
Candles, Salt, and such like things, which blessed or hallowed were had in too
too much estimation, for that then exceeding great virtue was supposed to be
in them, especially in holy water, which Steucus (as Bishop Jewel affirms of
him in his Apology) said we did well to hallow with salt and prayers, that by
the sprinkling thereof our sins may be forgiven: neither was it only
available for the soul, but the water of Canterbury like a certain Panacea,
could heal all diseases, as feauers, fistula, gowte, toothache, palsy,
consumption, falling sickness, leprosy, headache, broken arms, maimed legs,
swelling throtes, with infinite other, like as a cunning smith with one key
should open all manner of locks. I need not strive to put down these, they are
so weak that they fall of themselves, and the miracles wrought by them were
said to be so many, that they loose their own credit: only a word or two for
confutation of that which is alleged in defense of Idols, and then an end of
the Prohibition.

In the Prophet Hosea, Hos. 4. 17
Ephraim is joined to Idols: let him alone: if we must let him alone, why then
do you blame those that keep the statutes of Omry, and all the manner of the
house of Ahab which sacrifice to Baalim, which have borne Siccuth their King,
and Chilum their Images, and the star of their Gods, which they made to
themselves? I answer, the liberty that the Prophet Hose^ gives us a permission
with indignation, as if a father should say to his graceles son, when he
sees that he has shaken hands with hell, and standing at defyance with
goodness proclaims open war to his soul, and will not reclaim himself
by good admonition, but runs riot like a lawles and awles person, every day
faster then other, because the devil drives him, sirrah, run your race, take
your swinge, sape thy felfe in thy sins, give head to thy lusts, still dance
after the devils pipe, I will warn thee no more, I will let thee alone, see
what will come thereof at the last? the like speech concerning the same sin
is that of the Lord: Eze. 20. 39.
Go you and serve every one his I doll, seeing that ye will not obey me: the
like is that of Solomon, concerning an other sin: Ec. 11. ^.
Rejoice, o young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days
of thy youth, walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine
eyes: the like is that of the Angel, concerning all sin: Reu. 22. 11.
he that is unjust; let him be unjust still, and he that is filthy, let him
be filthy still: otherwise when the Lord speaks simply and plainly he
blames Israel, for that they Ps. 106. 28.
joined themselves to Baal-Peor, like the ^arbarian Tyrants, which bound the
bodies of the living to the bodies of the dead, till they rotted together.

Again some say, they worship God in their hearts, though they have images,
the better to stir up devotion, though they kiss these images and bow down
to them, yet they be not so sottish, but they know, they are but stocks and
stones, and therefore as the Grecians said, they would not worship images, lest
they should seem to agree with the Roman Church, but yet they would adore
pictures, or rather as Frederick the Emperor, when he prostrated himself in
such sort before Alexander the third, that the proud Pope troad upon his neck;
said, non tibi sed Petro: I do not this honor to thee, but to Peter. So say
they when they prostrate themselves before an image, non imagini sed Deo, they
do not this honor to the Image, but to God: but this is as if the wife should
say, she loves her husband in her heart, but she will have another man in her
house, she will keep company with other men* when he is abroad, she will set
her eyes upon them, she will embrace them, but this she does not for any love
to them, but that by them, she might better remember her husband, but this is
to be like Clodia, who to excuse her incest said, she did company with
Metellus as with an husband, but with Clodius, as with a brother. Thus though
every string be out of tune, yet the Music shall not sound amiss, but as
Asinus is Asinus, quanquam aurea gestit insignia, so this whore is a whore,
though she set never so fair a gloss upon her sin, and varnish her
lewdness, and in very deed, howsoever men sooth themselves in this sin, yet
are they so sottish, that as the Prophet says, Esa. 2. 8.
they worship the work of their own hands, with an ingemination which their
own fingers have made: otherwise why did they forbid ( ne Sanctorum imagines
confringantur) the breaking of images, inflicting a greater punishment upon him
that should break an Image, then upon him that should rent and tear God in
pieces with his carrion and stinking mouth? Why was one Rochus, a caruer of
Images, borne in Brabant, burned at Saint Lucas in Spain Anno 1545. when he
did but take up a chisell, and dashing it upon the image of our Lady, did
blemish her face; though he alleged for himself, it was his own work, and
if the workmanship disliked him, what had any man to do with it? Why were
they so wood and so testy with Testwood Anno 1544, as to threaten to kill him,
and therefore drew upon him, and that in the Church at Windsore, but that he up
with his hand in which he had a key, and smiting down a border about an
Alablaster Image, which the glance chanced to break off the nose. When Thomas
Beckets Image was set up at Mercers Chapel in London, in Queen Mary's time,
Anno 1555, why was there such a great reward promised by Proclamation to him,
which could bring news, who broke away first his two blessing fingers, and
afterward struck off his head, but that this and the other images were prized
at a greater value, then they deserved to be esteemed.

The word of God is comprised in the Bible, yet sometimes the paper thereof is
wasted, sometimes for that the translation disliketh us, sometimes for that it
is old and worn, and this we do without any exclamation, but let one break
or burn an Image that is worm-eaten by reason of age, or for that it has been
abused:

Iam faces, iam saxa volant, furor arma ministrat. Men rage, as though not a
stock or stone, but a true Saint of flesh and bone should be cast in the fire,
which argues, that they are to much addicted to the image it self, and have
it into high a veneration: but what need I light a candle in the sunshine, do
not they themselves write that the image and Cross of Christ ought to be
worshipped with the same honor that is done unto God; do they not say, when
we salute the Cross that procured us life, we do well to sing, thy Cross,
Lord do we adore the spear which opened thy sacred and life-giuing side, do
we adore, and that you may not marvel that men are so far gone as in such
sort to forget themselves, do you not see that many a man, though he has a
wife like Sarah, of whom Abraham said, Genesis 12. 11.
thou art a fair woman to look upon, and Genesis 26. 7.
like Rebecca beautiful to the eye, yet this notwithstanding, will go up to
the bed of a deformed harlot, in whose moulding, nature did never bestow the
like cunning: on the other side, does not many a woman, though she has an
husband like Absolon, 2. Sam. 14 25.
in whom was no blemish, whose personage may seem to have stolen away all that
nature was able to bestow, this notwithstanding, does she not many times
couple her self with another man, whose countenance, proportion of body, and
qualities of mind, are no ways answerable to her own husbands? If it be thus
in man and wife, then marvel the less at this, that the Church of Rome Ier
2. 12.
should change her glory, like the Reu. 2. 4.
Church of Ephesus, should forsake her first love, and casting off the God of
her salvation (who as the spouse says Can. 1. 15
is beautiful and pleasant, fairer then the children of men) should look to
other gods, go a whoring after them, couple her self with them, and breaking
her faith like a filthy strumpet, bow to Baall Peor, and separate her self to
that shame: but let this suffice to have spoken of the prohibition and negative
part of this commandment, now to the Iniunction.

Men reap as great displeasure by omission of duty, as commission of
iniquity, he is as honest a man that does nothing at all, as he is a good
Archer that never shootes at all; and therefore we must not only pass a secret
vow in the soul constantly to refrain from Idolatry; but also to perform
true and Canonical obedience to God: we must bow down unto God, and glorify
him in our members; we must worship him, and therefore glorify him in our
spirits, God made body and soul therefore 1. Cor. 6. 20.
they are Gods, therefore both must pay tribute. Religion is outward, Rom 12. 1
I beseech you therefore by the mercyes of God, that you offer up your bodies,
religion is inward: and therefore sursum corda, Pro. 23. 26.
my son give me thy heart, give God the heart and the hand, the mind and the
mouth, the faith and the feet.

This condemns those that will bow but not worship; Secondly those that will
worship but not bow; Thirdly those that will neither bow nor worship, and
approves only such as knowing God has joined those two together 2. Cro. 29
29. 30.
according to the practice of Prince, Priest, and people will not put them a
sunder.

The first sort are hypocrites, who will bow their knees, ducke like Friars,
cast up their eyes, cast forth their hands, but Nemo tam prope proculque Deo,
Mat. 15. 8
they draw near, and yet are far off, they are all for sight, nothing for
substance, the substance of their hearts is not answerable to the show of their
gestures, like Stage Players they represent the persons of those they are not,
acting religious parts, but doing nothing else but play devotion, and indeed
are little better then devils wrapped up in ^. Sam. 28 14.
Samuels mantle, hot meteors shooting, yet showing like stars, having foul
souls and fair liueries. Let these Gospellers or Gospel-spillers, shaming
goodness by seeming good, Esa. 1. 15.
stretch out their hands, God will hide his eyes from them; let them paynt and
trim, plaster and white-lime, and as smothly as they can dawbe on this fair
complexion, God shall smite these whited wales: God forgive them their holiness,
and grant they may carry themselves, in an honest and simple truth, free from
affectation of seeming that they are not, and give them as well good affections
as good gestures, as well a good text as a good gloss, as well the fruits of
piety as the blossoms of the knees, and leaves of the lips.

The second sort are a base kind of careless Christians, which regard not how
irreuerently they perform the duties of piety, Iud. 3. 20
with Eglon they will never arise to hear the word of God, 2. am. 6. 20.
with David they will not be bare headed before the Arc, Mat. 18. 20.
with the servant that feared they will not fall down, when they pray they
care not for kneeling, as subjects to their Prince nor standing as servants
before their Master, and while they would avoid the hypocrisy of seeming holy
by humbling themselves, they neglect and cast off all care of such comely
gestures as might stir up devotion: never suffering the inward affection of
their soul to appear by any outward carriage of the body Genesis 17. 3
Abraham fell on his face and worshipped, Act. 7 60
Stephen kneeled down, Luc. 18. 13.
The publican stood a far off, the first is as he that kisseth the feet of
the Lord, the second as he that kisseth his hand, the third as he that kisseth
his mouth, all these gestures are found in one Mary Magdalen, first Luc 7. 38.
she went to his feet for the remission of her own sins, then Ioh. 11. 32
to his knees for the raising of her brother Lazarus, then to his mouth Mat.
26. 7
when she powered the ointment upon his head: indeed when Joshua fell to the
earth and prayed, the Lord said unto him, Ios. 7. 10.
Get thee up, wherefore lie thou thus upon thy face? But it is not for that
he misliked the gesture of his body, but for that he condemned the excess of
his sorrow, as if he should say, why is thy spirit thus long in perplexity
within thee, why is thy heart within thee desolate, why do thou roll thy
self in the dust, and make lamentation like the Dragons, and mourn as the
Ostriches, why do thou forget to eat thy bread? thou have lain long and too
long upon the ground to make intercession for Israel, get thee up, lie no
longer, another means must be used to turn away my wrath, that I do not
suffer my whole displeasure to arise: otherwise though prayer be the substance,
yet gesture is a kind of formality to set it forth, and must wait upon it,
Iudit. 13. 10.
as Iudiths hand-mayde does upon her Mistress, when she goes unto her prayer.

The third sort which neither bow nor worship are plain Atheists, which have
no feeling of Gods love, no feeling of his fear, whose hardened hearts are as a
piece of dead flesh to matter of religion: Our Savior Christ in his Sermon,
upon the mountain would teach us to pray privately, for there is Mat. 6. 6. 7.
Oras in the singular number, and to pray publickely, for there is Oratis in
the plural number, but this man regardes neither private nor public service
of God, you shall never blame his hypocrisy, for he is so far from standing
in the corners of the street to pray, so far from saluting one of the pillars
of the great Church on one knee, that he never worships God with body or soul
in Church or in chamber, or any other place whatsoever whether he should pray
with the Protestants toward the East, with the Jews toward the West, with
the Saracens toward the South, whether prostrate with Ahraham, kneeling with
Stephen, or standing with the Publican, be questions that never trouble his
brain: when Gregory Bishop of Rome sent Austen the Monk into this land in the
Saxons time to bring this Nation out of darkness into light, Austen consulted
with Gregory what form of divine service he should commend to the Saxons;
Gregory willed him to bind himself neither to the form of Rome, Millan,
French, or any other Church, but the best and pikedst things to choose out of
all Churches, and them to induce and deliver to the English: but this man would
save Austen a labor in consulting, and Gregory in resolving, no service is
accpeted with him, no religion; Lucian is his old Testament, Machiauell is his
new: he says with the Sadduces Mat. 22. 23.
there is no resurrection, Act. 23. 8
neither Angel nor spirit, he has said in his heart, there is no God, no
judgment, no hell, no heaven, this one thing he has, whereof let him rejoice,
he will commit no solecisme in Gods service, and be sure that his prayer, Est.
7. 7. 8
like that of Haman, shall never be turned into sin; he is a great deal
worse then Agrippa, Act. 26. 28.
for he was almost persuaded to be a Christian, worse then Protagoras, for he
did but doubt, de dijt vtrum sint non ausim affirmare, worse then the
superstitious man, for better to have many go^s then to have no god, as bad as
the devil, but that he has a body; nay in this worse then the devils, Iac. 2.
19.
for they believe and tremble, Luc. 4. 34
and acknowledge the holy one of God.

The fourth sort which (according as they are enjoined by this commandment)
bow down unto God and worship him, are Ioh. 1. 47
with Nathaniell true Israelites indeed, Ps. 105. 1.
which sing unto God, and therefore they give him the tongue, sing heartily,
and therefore they give him their souls, fall down and kneel before their
maker, and therefore they give him their hands and knees, and with Jacob they
will use some corporal service, Genesis 47. 31.
who therefore leaned on his staff and worshipped God, when he was not able
to kneel or stand; if their heart do believe, they say with the young man,
Mat. 19. 20.
what lack I yet, their mouth shall confess their eyes shall wait, their
ears shall hearken, their heads shall be bare, their hands shall be lifted up,
their knees shall bend and Camel themselves before God, they serve God with
all their soul, therefore God shall have all that is within them, they serve
God with all their might, therefore God shall have all that is without them,
the former is the substance, the latter is a kind of formality to set it forth;
to conclude this point therefore: Ps. 25. 1.
Sit cordis intentio, sit manuum extentio, with David lift up thy soul unto
God, Ex. 17. 11.
with Moses hold up thy hands the preparing of the heart and stretching out of
the hands are in Job Job. 11. 13
joined by God, let them not therefore be sundred in man.

I am the Lord thy God: In the fourth year of King Richard the 2. when the
Rebels had assembled themselves together to the number of more then three
score thousand, having for their Captains Wat Tiler and Jack Straw; the King
came in amongst them at a day and place appointed, and speaking unto them in
gentle sort said: Sirs, what ayleth you, ye shall have no Captain but me, I,
am and will be your King and Captain be you therefore quiet. In like manner
when the heart of Israel was not perfect with the Lord, when the house of Jacob
did not give God his due glory, but following other Gods rebelled against him:
when they esteemed that Idol Sic^nth as their King, and took up the
Tabernacle of Moloch, when all the people walked every one in the name of his
god, then God came down amongst them Ex. 19. 11
at his appointed time and place, and giving them good words said, hear O
Israel, what ayleth you, ye shall have no God but me, ye shall not join
your selves to Baal-Peer, nor subject your selves to your god Remphan nor ^eepe
the statutes of Omri, I am the Lord your God, therefore cleave unto me, serve
me with gladness, wash your hands in innocence and so compass mine altar. The
first argument then here used to induce obedience, is the love of God, and this
that he says, thy God, atgueth the contract and marriage betwixt God and his
Church according to that in Ezechiell, Eze. 16. 8
I swear unto thee, and entered into covenant with thee, and thou becamest
mine; God was not ashamed to be called their God, he was as an husband, the
Israelites as his spouse, his soul longed for them, his heart did cleave unto
them, his secret was with them, his beauty was upon them, his light shined
upon their heads, he did lift up upon them the light of his countenance; he did
hide them under the shadow of his wings, he did cover them all the day long,
under his arms they were for ever, he did endow them, and say, all that I have
is thine, goods of grace re, goods of glory spe, the first in present
posession, the second in future assurance.

The love of this Bridegroom to his spouse shall appear the greater, if we
consider her estate and quality, first for estate.

Men in their matches commonly respect the mending of their means, and will
look to this that in tying themselves fast, they do not undo themselves;
this makes many roue at a mark with their thoughts, which is beyond the pitch
of their bow: like 2. Kin. 14. 9.
the thistle which in the parable would have the Cedars daughter married to his
son: but in this match God which is as a Cedar in Lebanon maryeth himself
unto a thistle, tantus tantillos, so great a God, so small a worm, as Jacob,
he did not therefore respect his own good, when he made choice of his Church,
that would not enrich him, if there be any good in us, Ps. 16. 2.
our well-doing extends not to him, but he aimed at the good of his spouse,
that he might make her free which was bound unto Satan, for even in our law, if
a freeman marry a bondwoman, she is made free, because her husband and she are
one person, and if he does make her free, then is she free indeed.

Again men in their matches have an eye to the qualities of those, to whom
they intend to contract themselves, whether they be ( caeteris paribus) of a
mild and gentle disposition, least as meats of contrary qualities digest not
well together, so they should be always one sick of the other. In our land,
the Guardein in chiualry shall not mary his Ward in chiualry to one that is
unequal to him, as a bondwoman, the 2. to one that is lame, or the 3.
deformed, or the 4. has some horrible disease as Leprosy, or the 5. to a
woman that is past childbearing, for it is disparagement, but God joined
himself to Israel when she was bond, for sin reigned in her, when she was
lame, for Joshua takes her up for halting, when she was deformed and Eze. 16. 6.
Polluted in her own blood, when she was diseased, for from the sole of the
foot unto the crown of the head, there was no whole t Esa. 1. 6.
part in her, when she brought forth nothing but sin unto death, when
Shechem would marry Dinah Jacobs daughter, her brother said Genesis 34. 14.
they might not give their sister to a man uncircumcised, but God espoused
Israel, when she was of an uncircumcised heart and lips, and wedded her, which
wanted a wedding garment, tantus tantillos, tales, so great so righteous a God
made choice of a spouse, betwixt whom whether we respect estate or quality,
there was great inaequalitie, Jacob loved x Genesis 29. 17.
Rachell more then Leah, he had some reason, she was more beautiful, but that
God should praefer Jacobs sons before the rest of the world, he had no reason
but his own good will, Genesis 34: 25.
for two of them Simeon and Leui were treacherous and bloody men, and the
eldest Ruben came not behind them in another kind of iniquity: Genesis 35. 22.
for he went and lay with Bilhah his fathers concubine, and what dignity could
be in him, who went up to his fathers bed and defiled it? The rest, they and
theirs were a Ps. 78. 8.
froward and crooked generation, a generation that set not their hearts aright,
whose spirit cleaued not steadfastly unto God, and as Mount Sion was not better
then other Mountains, but more noble because it pleased God to dwell there, so
the Jews were no better then other, till God vouchsafed to make them his
people, because he had a favor unto them, because his good pleasure was such.
And this is that which our Savior Christ says, Ioh. 15. 16
ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you: he chose them first by
predestination, and afterward by calling and culling them out from the rest,
but then did they also choose him by consenting to that calling: of both these
mutual choices does Moses speak, of the on, Deu. 26. 17. 18.
thou have set up the Lord this day to be thy God: of the other, the Lord has
set thee up this day to be a precious people unto him: now out of this that
has been spoken, conclude as the Jews did, when they saw manifest tokens of
Christ's affection Ioh. 11. 36.
to Lazarus they said see how he loved him, so when you consider the premises,
and see the disparagement, say, see how he loved her, see how great affection
he bare to his Church.

1. Io. 4. 9.
This must teach us first, to love him, because he loved us first, love must be
reciprocal, and therefore the Bridegroom and the spouse, in that sweet
marriage song call one another Lone; secondly, it must teach us to keep us
only to him so long as we live, for if while the husband lives, the wife shall
Romans 7. 2*
take another man, she shall be called an adultresse. Neither does wife admit any
plurality when she is construed with one husband, and therefore it was a kind
of Solacisme when Lamech said, bear ye^ wines of Lamech, neither does husband
admit any plurality, when he is construed with one wife, now neither must vnus
or vna have a plural number, socium de te nesciunt: God Mal. 2. 15.
had abundance of spirit, and might have made two for one, but he made but
one, one man for one woman, one woman for one man, and as the woman has not
power over her own body, either to deny it to her own husband, or to yield it
to another man, so neither has the spouse of Christ: ye are not your own: 1
Cor. 6. 20
for ye are bought for a price, therefore glorify God in your body, and in
your spirit: for they are Gods. we must therefore acquaint our selves with God,
as for Idols they are called strange gods, as the harlot is called a strange
woman, because they should be Mal. 2. 11. Pro. 7. 5.
strangers to us and we should be strangers to them.

It is good for me (says the Psalmographer) to keep me Psa. 73. 28.
fast to God, for there is a nearer conjunction betwixt God and us then betwixt
man and wife, for man and wife are one flesh: Gen 2. ^4.
but he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit: if therefore a wife may 1.
Cor. 6. ^7
not forsake the guide of her youth, and forget the covenant of her God, if her
holy days must not be feasts of quicunque vult, if she must not turn to
uncleanness from her husband, much less, may Gods spouse break her faith, and
giving God sundry companions, bestow his glory on them, she must not bow her
knees to Baal, nor kiss him with her mouth.

A jealous God: some men being better husbands then Christians, and better
bawdes then husbands, can be content to be panders to their own beds, Nicholas
(the same as most men Act. 6. 5.
think which was one of the seven deacons) being blamed for jealousy,
brought his wife, who was fair to look upon, among all the disciples, giving
free leave to all that would to use her, of him came the heretics called
Nicolaite, who held that wives should be common, whose works the Church of
Ephesus hated Reu. 2. 6.
to their great commendation: Abraham is not much displeased that the
fountains be not his only, but the strangers among who^ he is, and therefore
gives his wife this counsel, say, I pray Genesis 12. 13.
thee, that thou art my sister, that I may fare well for thy sake: nay his own
silence and his own words are the cause that she is taken into Pharaohs
house to be his wife, for Pharaoh blames him both for the one, and for the
other: for his silence, why said thou not, she was thy wife? for his speech,
why said thou she was thy sister: having great cause to expostulate the
matter with him; for hereupon if God had not kept Pharaoh, Pharaoh Genesis 20. 2.
had kept Abraham's wife: neither did he leave by this, but as though this sin
had been glued to him, and that he did clean as fast unto it, as it unto him,
he stumbles the second time at the same stone: and though a son should not
iumpe in every foot-steppe of his good father, and keep the same pase, and
turning in all points as he does: (for ego and pater meus in the Oeconomicks
is no good plea) though God registers the sin of the father, not for
imitation, but admonition of the son, and though the father repents the ill
he did, that the son might not do that which he repented) yet Isaac the
son of Abraham, as though God in setting down his fathers fall had said, tu
quoque fac simile, treads in his fathers steps, though he did tread too much
outward, the imitation of his fathers evil did aequall the example, or rather
exceed it, as much as the imitation of his fathers good Genesis 26. 7.
came short of the pattern. I know the hope of faring well, and the danger
which Abraham and Isaac foresaw to be toward them in strange Countries, if by
this means they had not prevented it, does some thing extenuate their fact and
may seem to patronize it: but now a days there be diverse wittals, who though
there be little hope of profit, less fear of peril can be content that
their own bosoms should be false to them, that others like fed Horses, as the
Prophet speaks, should ^eye after their Ier. 5. 8. Exodus 8. 3. Ge^. 49 14. 1
King. 22. 11.
wi^es, and croke in their Chambers like the frogs of Egypt; they themselves
being but cloakes for the rain, while they smother the fault: the blessing of
Issachar be upon them let Zidchiah do the best he can for them: let these
Caffrani still father the cra^le, and with the wood-culuers or filly hedge
sparrowes hatch and bring up, that which cuckows lay in their neasts.

Others of a more honest disposition think, no injury on earth can parallel
this wrong: they think this, that others should have the same conjunction with
their wives in wickedness, which they have in holiness, and by the
appointment of God to be one of the greatest punishments inflicted by God or
man: by God, for it is the first of the two punishments, when God did gather
his lap full of plagues to power upon Israel for their idolatry: Your
daughters shall be Hos 4. 13.
harlots, and your spouses shall be whoors by man; for it was the saying of a
great man, when diverse gave their verdict what judgment it were best to
execute upon a notable malefactor brought before them, one saying he should
be whipped at an horse tail, an other that he should be hanged, no, says he,
I will punish him worse then so, I will marry him to a whore.

Men of good minds, and such as have care of their credits, think that if
other men should use their wives more familiarly then honesty requires, that
if other should gage the vessels, and they should drink the lees, that if
other should gather the grapes, (they should gleane the vine, that if other
should have the entertainment of husbands with their wives, and they should
see the staff stand at their doors: this stain they think to be the
greatest blemish that might be to their reputation, and a reproach which never
could be put away, and as the woman for her part does stomach the matter, when
her husband, having a wise of his own, is sick of a plurisie: And therefore
Olympias the mother of Alexander the Great (though Genesis 16. 3
Sarah for want of children gave her servant Hagar into her husbands bosom)
wrote unto her son, that he should not according to his custom, call
himself the son of Jupiter, lest in so doing Juno the wife of Jupiter might
envy her, and take displeasure: so on the other side, the husband especially
if he be jealous, cannot digest this villainy: Jealousy is the rage of a man,
therefore will he not spare in the day of vengeance; he will Pro. 6. 34.
seek his death that does abuse his wife, and divorce his wife, that takes her
pleasure in dalliance with another man: now God is a jealous God, an husband
that cannot abide a partner in his love, and therefore we cannot wrong him
more, or dishonor him more, then by going aftet other gods, and coupling our
selves to them: nae his name is Jealous, and Ex. 34 14.
thererefore in any case he cannot away with a Rival, and therefore forsaking
all other, we must keep our selves only to him, so long as we both shall live.

A good wife, though her husband be not jealous, yet will give him her hand,
her heart, and her body, but if she know him jealous, she will not give him the
least cause of suspicion, either by talking of others, or walking with others;
so the spouse of Christ, though her Lord were not a jealous God, yet having
betrothed her self to him, and received pledges of his love, should delight in
him and none other: but considering he is jealous, she should have a greater
care to retain and keep all her senses chaste, to observe all loyalty and
faithfulness, she should not (according to the precept of Moses and promise
Ex. 23. 13.
of Daaid) not so much as make mention of other gods with Ps. 16. 4.
her lips: But making protestation (as they in the Psalm) that she has not
forgotten, the name of her God, should reckon other Ps. 44. 20.
gods such strangers to her, as though she knew not their names, neither
should they ever be heard out of her mouth, much less should she ever come to
Gilgall, or go up to Bethauen, desire oaks and choose gardens, bow herself
and humble her self, do shamefully and follow her lovers.

Visiting the sin of the fathers upon the children: A good man hates
iniquity, not so much for the danger of it, as the indignation, but fear
keeps back the bad man, when he foresees the danger, if he run into it: A
galley-slaue falls to rowing, for he sees himself fast chained, and knows he
shall be surely Ex. 8. 8. and 10. 17.
beaten, if he row not. Pharaoh becomes somewhat tractable, but punishment
drives him to it. Balaam boweth and gives Nu^. 22. 31. 34.
good words, but danger is toward him.

O derunt peccare mali formidine pa^a. As God therefore has compassion of
some, so others he Jude. 22.
saues with fear, in this place he has salt in his speech, and puts a wedge
of iron into knotty wood: God will wrestle with the wicked, with them and
theirs, not using his right hand of mercy, as he did with Jacob, when he
supported him: Ge^. 32. 24.
but his left hand of justice, as Jacob did with Esau, when he Ge^. 25 27.
supplanted him, and if he punish the posterity of wicked Idolaters, how great
then and terrible shall their own destruction be, when their issue shall
perish thorough their default.

Visit: Almighty God the Bishop of our souls goes his visitation, he inquires
of faults, and thoroughly sifts them out, 1 Pet. 2. 25
then ministers the quantity of the punishment, according to the quality of the
offense, this is the right visitation. Among us are some visitations, non morum
sed nummorum visitationes: But God visits not the purse, but visits the sin,
he will not spare the poor for pity, nor the rich for bribes, he will not
commute the penance, or respect any external thing, whither it be comelines of
body excellency of wit, nobility of stock, antiquity of descent, the soul
that sins shall die, and there is Ro^. 2. 11.
no respect of persons.

The sin of the Fathers upon the children: Men are dull upon the spur, and
do not easily bend when God bids them bow, therefore God threatens to extend
his rigor to their posterity, he will lay up the sorrow of the father for his
children: but Job. 21. 19.
does this stand with the justice of God to punish the child for the fathers
offense? how then is the Scripture true, every Gal. 6. 5.
man shall bear his own burden? how is the proverb true, every fat shall
stand on his own bottom? if it be so, let that proverb which was out of date
be renewed again, the fathers have eaten Eze. 18. 2.
sour grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge. The Civil law (to
fetch this point from our first original) says, Partus sequitur ventrem, the
birth follows the womb, that is, the child shall be as the mother, if she be
free, her child shall be free, though she marry a bondman; and according to
the laws of the Realm, the child shall be as the father, but when father and
mother are bond both, as ours are, then there is no question but the children
are bond. The whelps of wolves though they can do no hurt with hunting, yet
already do sport themselves in biting and delight in blood: the brood of
serpents (like the disciples of the Pharisees younger in years, Mat. 22. 16
but like in malice) are shorter in stature, but aequall in poison, and who
will blame him, that shall kill these whelps and destroy the young serpents,
though they have yet no strength to hurt and cast forth their poison? non prius
nati quam damnati. And though children being young bring forth no bad fruit in
the boughs, yet are they infected at the root, but leave this original and
go on, if the father be a traitor to his Prince, do you marvel, if his
children do smart for it: if the husband has public notice of his wives
adultry, shall he not give her a public discharge? shall he smother the
fault, which she is not ashamed to set abroach? the disease of marriage is
adultry, and the medecin is deuorcement: shall he put away the mother, and
retain her children, which he knows to be an adulterous generation: now God
is the husband of his Church, he married Israel to himself, but she in
joining her Hos. 4. 12.
self to Idols went a whoring from under her God, God therefore Hos. 4. 12.
Esa. 50. 1.
forsakes her, and gives her a bill of diuorcement, and therefore if her
children feel the smart, God bids them reason the case with their mother and
not lay the blame upon him; plead Hos. 2. 2.
with your mother, with an ingemination, plead with her: Again God may punish
the sin of the parents on the Children, yet the cause of punishment may be in
themselves, as if any being sick of the plague, infect other and they dye,
every one of them is said to dye of his own plague: God will not have this
proverb used in Israel, the fathers have eaten sour grapes and Eze. 18. 3.
the Childrens teeth are set on edge, but if they eat sour grapes as their
fathers did, no marvel though their teeth be set on edge. When God takes away
his grace, they eat sour grapes, and drink their own poison, then are they
as ships cast upon the rocks, dashed in pieces, or sunk in the sands, when
God not giving them his grace they want all their tackling, then are they as a
house which falls of it self, because God as a Sampson, Iud. 16. 29.
has withdrawn the pillars, then are they as old lame men, which sink of
themselves when God will not lend them his grace, as a staff to uphold them.
This God does visit the iniquity of the fathers on their Children, not by
taking away any thing they had, but because he will not supply that they
wanted, and this is no injustice in God; for every good gift comes from him,
grace is his, he may give it to whom he will, he may withold it from whom he
please, it is lawful for him to do with his own what he list: and he many
times withholdes Mat. 20. 15
it from the Child, when he considers the sin of the father, and for that
the father ran further and further into wickedness, he gives over the Children,
so that they sell themselves to work wickedness, that filling up the the
iniquity of the fathers, they might have their punishment cast into their
bosom. And this is that which Hosee says concerning Israel, because Hos. 2. 5.
the mother played the harlot, and she that conceived Hos. 4. 13.
them did shamefully: therefore their daughters shall be harlots, that they might
be punished for their own faults, but mediately for the sin of their parents
which caused God to give over their offspring, that so they might give head to
their lusts, and bring a speedy destruction upon themselves.

This must teach both parents and children, each of them a several lesson,
Parents to have a greater care then other of discharging their duty to God, for
the neglect hereof brings a plague on themselves and on those which come out of
their loins, and if God accomplish not his judgments as soon as a sin is
committed, he can well work them upon the offspring of such as seem to have
escaped his hand: I have seen says Eliphaz the foolish well rooted, and
suddenly I cursed his habitation, saying* his Children shall be far from
salvation, and they shall be Job. 5. 3. 4.
destroyed in the gate: judgment shall find out the Children, though happily
sometime it pass by the father: his blood be on Mat. 27. 25
us and on our Children say the Jews, to Pylate concerning the blood of
Christ, cruenti plane genitores (says Saint Augustine) qui ante facti sunt
paricide quam parents. O cruel fathers which were paracides before they were
parents: but though this wish had not been, yet this cruel crying sin had
come home to their Childrens doors, and been powered into their bosoms. We
have a proverb, happy is the Child, when the father goes to the devil, for
example, the father not so much as rouing at God, makes the world his standing
mark, he never thinks of compassing heaven, but as Satan came from compassing
the earth to and fro and from walking in it; so he will compass earthly
things for him and his, and having the greedy worm under his tongue with Esops
Dog, would ingrosse the world for himself and his issue, now no way comes
amiss to wealth, usury, extortion, oppression, sacrilege, swearing, lying,
subtelty, as porters shall bring in his gain, now poor Naboth shall not hold
his own, because Ahab is sick of his Vineyarde: like enough such a father
goes to the devil, but how is his Child happy? you will say, because he shall
gather all these riches which his father raked together, yet I say not happy,
for many times we see there comes a son, that is as good with a forke as his
father with a rake, as good a spendall, as his father getall, and scorning to
think of the troubles and sighs of his father in heaping up his goods,
consumes the fat of his predecessors in few years, as the lean Kyne did eat
up the fat in Pharaohs dream. Of all goods these may most truly be called
Genesis 41. 4.
moveable, for like larkes they fall to the ground faster then ever they
mounted up, and like clouds never rest till they fall as they climed: Job
speaks as though the wicked, when they set up their houses by pilling and
poling, and rake other men's goods by hook and by crook, did but make a stacke
of wood, and then comes a spark of Gods wrath and makes an end Job. 15. 34.
of all: if therefore parents will be happy in themselves, happy in their
posterity, let them love God, keep innocence and do the Psa. 37. 37.
thing that is just, for that shall bring a man peace at the last, that Psa.
112. 2.
shall bring Gods blessing upon their children: the generation of the righteous
shall be blessed when the ungodly shall perish, they shall see it.

Secondly Children may here learn to pray to God, not only to hide their own
sins in his wounds, to bury their own offenses in his death, to cross
their accounts and forget them al, but to pray further as in the Letany;
Remember not Lord the offenses of our forefathers: not that we must pray for
the dead, while we live we must take an obligation of our selves, daily to pray
for other, and commend each other to God by interchangeable prayers, but when
men are dead, he that prays for the good, does wrong to the good, he that
prays for the bad cannot mend him or help him with prayers. We allow not the
sacrifices made for souls, nor those feralia dedicated to the infernal gods,
that they might be pacified with those that are departed, happily some will
say, were I not better pray for them, then to say, the devil go with them, as
good a reason, as if a thief being blamed for robbing a man upon Shooters
hill, or in Stangate hole, should reply and say, were I not better rob him,
then kill him, of evils every one is to be avoided. But thus far we pray,
that God would not remember the sins of our forefathers to visit them upon us
who do succeed them, for because Dan. 9. 16.
of our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers God will set his face
against us, and let in one punishment or other upon us.

Of those which hate me: they which transgress the law of God, especial they
which lay his chief honor open to the spoil of creatures, hate God and
desire to spoil him of his government: Qui diligit meretricem, odit sponsam
suam, he that loves an harlot hates his own spouse: and on the other side she
that loves an other man, hates her own husband: now Idolaters Ho. 2. 5. 13 Nu.
15. 39.
play the harlots, and do shamefully, and say, I will go after my lovers,
they follow their lovers, go a whoring after their own Ho. 3. 1. and 4 17.
eyes, look to other gods and are joined to Idols, therefore may they well be
said to hate God.

The effects do sufficiently show forth this hatred, for the bringers in of
Idols, put God and his truth out of doors, and Judge. 11. 7.
thereupon does Iephtha prove that his brethren did hate him, because they did
expel him out of his fathers house: Again when men are out of love with any
thing they care not how little while they keep it, either they will sell it,
as Joseph's brethren sold him to the Ishmaelites, or change it, as Israel did
the ordinances: Genesis 37 28 Esa. 24. 5.
now Idolaters make an exchange of God, and though no Nation ever changed their
God, which yet are no gods, yet they change their glory. Therefore do they
hate God, because God Ier. 2. 11.
hates all them that work wickedness. 1. Their God who made them Psa. 5. 5.
glorious. This must teach Idolaters not to flatter themselves in their sin,
and to think they do God good service, and love him as well as the best; and
therefore have his image to show their devotion, for God says they hate him.

Secondly this teaches, that we are not to give Papists the commendation of
good honest men, and to bind their religion as a crown unto them, for they be
such as hate God, and lift up their hands against him: therefore we must say
with David: I Psa. 31. 6.
hate them that hold of superstitious vanities* and I hate them that hate Psa.
139. 21
thee, I hate them right sore as though they were mine enemies, or at leastwise
we must be like the Physician, which loves the patient and hates his disease.
2. Therefore we must have no fellowship or join in any league of friendship
with them, for therefore in the old Testament, Iehu takes up Iehosaphat for
that he would 2. Cro. 12. 2
help the wicked, and love them that h^ted the Lord; and in the Mat. 9. 14.
new Testament the Disciples of John are blameable who joined themselves with
the Pharisees, whom Christ condemned: who hated Christ, and sought to entangle
him in his words. 3. We must not contract marriages with them, give our
daughters to them, or take their daughters to us, as adultry is a cause of
divorce, so should Idolatry be a cause of restraint, and should hinder it as
well as the other does separate it: when the birds assembled themselves in
Parliament there was a Decree past, that the Eagle for breeding of fairer birds,
should join in marriag with the Ostrich, whereupon he makes suite unto her,
but having been a while in her company, and perceiving she did eat iron, and
steel, and devour that which he could not abide, he gave off his suite, so on
the one side, if there be any external thing, as antiquity of descent, great
kindred, much alliance, great wealth, many friends, good hope of raising, the
house that should move Protestants to match in the houses of Papists and to
graffe in their stock; let them consider again on the other side, that they
be haters of God, procurers of the Kings evil, hard-hearted, flagella
Reipublicae, flabella seditionis, that they would devour a whole
Parlament-house, and could well digest it, if Jerusalem were made an heap of
stones.

And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
Commandments. Our Savior Christ says to Martha, thou art Luc. 10 41
troubled about many things, but one thing is necessary, so we are troubled
about many things; some about their farms, some Luc. 14. 18
about their oxen, some about their wives; all these in the beginning of
Ecclesiastes, are vanity of vanities, and all vanity, Eccl. 1. 2.
but one thing is n^c^ssary* and that is in the end of Ecclesiastes, Ec. 12 13.
fear God and keep his Commandments: but here the Lord does not say fear,
but love me, and keep my Commandments, to show that all the duty we
perform to God must proceed from love: the law (says Saint Paul) is not
given to 1 Timothy 1. 9
the righteous man, either to condemn him, or to compel him, for he will do
good of a good affection, without further constraint. God will have the
Israelits* bring offerings, for the making Ex. 25. 2.
of the Tabernacle, but he will not strain upon any, but every one shall give
as his heart does encourage him, and Ex. 35 21
as his spirit does make him willing: Son, go and work today Mat. 21. 28
in my vineyard: vineyard, therefore a fit place; to day, therefore a fit time;
son, therefore a fit person, for he will go with good will, as readily as
Samuel comes at a call, Here am I, 1 Samuel 3. 5
not that thou compelledst me, but, here am I, for you calledst Ex. 8. 25.
me. The obedience of the wicked is wrested from them, as was Pharaohs, and
their good deeds are spoiled in the working, as many a good tale is mard in the
telling; but the godly yield freely to obedience for love, are not haled and
dragged by force, my heart is ready says David, with an ingemination, Ps. 57.
7.
my heart is ready, ready for adversity, ready for prosperity, ready to be
humbled, ready to be exalted, ready to do whatsoever thou command.

This must teach us to take heed we do not good things amiss that is true
of the Canon Lawyers, God loves aduerbs better then adjectives: not quam bonum,
but quam been; Luc. 18. 4.
and therefore a good deed must be well done: Justice readily, and therefore
fie upon the unjust Judge; Alms willingly for 2 Cor. 9. 7.
grudging, like Colloquintida spoils the whole pot of pottage. A good mind
cannot free a man from offense, when 2 Samuel 6. 6.
he does ill; and therefore Vzzah does ill to put his hand unto the Arc: but a
bad mind may make a man sin in doing good, and therefore Judas was not without
great fault in saluting Christ Mat. 26. 49
to betray him. First therefore, we must look what we do for the matter, to
know this we must ask counsel at the mouth of the Lord, his word must be a
touchstone to try our actions, and the standard from which we must not
depart. Secondly, we must look how we do it for the manner, whither of love
or of fear, of a cheerful or grudging mind; and to know this, we must
consult with our own hearts, with Moses put our hands into our bosoms, rip up
our consciences, Ex. 4. 6.
take our souls to task, and with the possessed return unto our own house,
virtus uolentium nulla est. He that Luc. 8. 39.
does good against his will, does ill; God will have us voluntary men, good
deeds must not be wrung out of us, as veriuyce out of the crabs when they are
pressed, nor beaten out Ex. 17. 6.
of us, as waters came out of the rock, when Moses smote it with his rod, but
they must sweetly flow from us, as rivers Ioh. 7. 38.
from the fountain. The service we do to our neighbors is not accepted with
God, except it proceed from love; If I give all that I have to feed the poor
(says the Apostle) and have not 1 Cor. 13. 3
love, it profits me nothing: If I give, and not lend, which is not so great
liberality, mine own (which I have) not another man's; for many rob Peter and
pay Paul, build Almes-houses with the superfluity of their usury, make
Hospitals with racking their rents, enclosing of commons, with that which they
have gotten by briberie, oppression, and extorting from other, which indeed is
not their own: again if I give not a part but all, at the only hearing
whereof the young man Mat. 19. 22
shrunk back and went away sorrowful, not to the rich but to the poor, for
that were but to cast water into the sea: if I did all this to feed them, and
as you would say to put life into them, when they were ready to perish for want
of sustenance, yet all this notwithstanding, if love be lacking, there is
wanting the best flower in the garden, without which the rest yield no sweet
smelling savor to God: so likewise God accepts no service we do unto
himself, except love as in this place like a Gentleman Usher does go before
it, and therefore Saint Paul wishes us to offer up our bodies a quick
sacrifice unto God, quick not only because we must offer Romans 12. 1.
them quickly, against those which say of the temple of their Hag. 1. 2.
bodies, as the Jews of the Temple of Jerusalem, it is not yet time to build
the Temple of the Lord, but because that which is quick does love to be
stirring, is ready and willing to move of it self.

And keep my Commandments: Love and obedience are Ge^. 38. 30.
twins, and one follows the other, as Zarah came after Pharez out of Tamars
womb; mix the one with the other, and then is compounded the cup of salvation.

This makes against Hypocrites and proud boasters, which will enable
themselves with their tongues, and say they love God, but there is no such
matter, for then would their outward works bear witness of their inward
affection: Gods spirit works in a spiritual man, and makes him bring forth
fruits of love: as nature works in a natural man, whose love does creep
where it cannot go, and enclosed (as we see in Joseph) shines as a candle
thorough the chinkers. Ge^. 43 34.


The Angel put on the shape of man, that Manoah might Iud. 13. 1^
see him, and love must put on obedience, that the world may see it; Gideon
must have none to be his soldiers, but such as Iud. 7. 6. 7
use as well their hand as their tongue; let no man therefore glory more to be
a linguist then a realist. The Church is a widow, for as she is called a
mother, because she brings forth children to God, and nourceth them with the
milk, which stream out of her two breasts, the Old and New Testament, as she
is called a virgin, because she keeps the faith, the faith of Christ sound
and whole, as she is called a bride, because Christ did marry her to himself:
so is she called a widow, because her husband is ascended into heaven, there
sitting at the right hand of Majesty, which here lived at the left hand of
adversity, and her love and obedience are like the two mites, which the widow
threw into the treasury Luc. 21. 1.
more accepted of God, then the gifts which the rich threw in of their
superfluity, here they go hand in hand, and never must be put asunder.

Ye are my friends (says our Savior Christ) if ye do whatsoever Ioh. 15. 14
I command you: as for others which do not that which he commands, which
will not wait upon him, and conform themselves to his obdedience, which will
not study to acquit their duties, and by observing his will get him honor,
they are but retainers, and do only wear his livery for a countenance, and
God is so far from accepting them as his friends, that he will never, either
by favor or wages owe them for his servants.

Show mercy: The upper region of the air is calm, Every living creature the
more power it has by nature, the more prone it is to mercy; the Lion the
prince of all the rest, spares those that are prostrate, the king of bees
wants a sting, now God who sits above the heavens, is high above all gods,
of greatest power; because the powers that are, are ordained by him: Romans 13. 1
cuius iussu nascuntur homines, eius iussu constituuntur Principes (says
Irenaeus) and inde illis potestas, vnde spiritus, says Tertullian; he that
gives birth and breath, gives might and majesty, and therefore of greatest
mercy, because of his power: wherefore David having mentioned his wonders
doubleth his grace Ps. 111. 4.
and mercy, for he is merciful in his wonders, and wonderful in his mercies.
It is Gods property to show pity and favor, he is best acquainted with it;
but to punish is a strange thing to him, his work, his strange work, his Act,
his strange Act: and Esa. 28. 21.
therefore when he visits iniquity, he is said, to go out of his place: God
does in this place set down his goodness, I the Esa. 26. 21.
Lord thy God: then his justice, visiting the iniquities: but as though he had
not so well liked the left hand way, he turns again on the right hand,
saying, he will show mercy, and not suffer the sun to set in a cloud: but
what needs mercy, when a man loves God, and keeps his Commandments? shall not
such a man have a reward as due debt? Steven Gardener Bishop of Winchester, in
the Reign of King Edward the sixth, having many Articles laid against him,
stood much upon his innocence, saying, he had neither offended Law, Statute,
Act, or Proclamation, thinking he had so little need of mercy, that very
Justice would relieve him; but in conclusion, being asked by the Lord
Chancellor, whither he would not desire the King to be his good Lord, and
accept his pardon, alas my Lord (quoth he) I have not so forgotten my self,
but I will on my knees desire the King to be good to me: so let a man's
innocence be such, that no body can say, black is his eye: let him be as just
as Job 1. 1.
Job, who was many an ace before Gardener) one that feared God, and eschued
evil; who intending to make protestation of his vprightnes says, he has not
dealt amiss toward men; for there is no wickedness in his hands, and
secondly has performed his duty to God, for Job 16. 17
his prayer is pure, let his desires be good, and his deeds answerable to his
desires, yet he may bear a part in that song of mercy, Ps. 51. 7
Asperge me Domine: and the best lamb should abide the slaughter, except the
Ram were sacrificed that Genesis 22. 13.
Isaac might be saved, if we loved God with all our heart, with all our soul,
with all our strength, and our neighbor as our selves, then might we
challenge a reward at Gods hands, as though sal^ation stood on our merits not
Gods mercies, but we do it but in part, and therefore not in so great a
measure as we ought, and therefore had need of mercy. If we could say indeed
unto God, as the elder son unto his father, never Luc. 15. 29.
brake I at any time thy commandment, and as the young man unto Christ, Mat.
19. 20.
I have observed all these things from my youth; If we could fulfill the law in
every point, then upon discharge of debt, every one might call for an
acquittance, ask for a quietus est, and say further, Luc. 15. 12.
give me the portion, which to me belongs; but we keep it no further forth
then God by his spirit does in able us, and in many things we sin all, and
therefore had need of mercy: Ve hominum vitae, quantumuis laudabili, si remota
misericordia iudicetur; though I were just, says Job 9. 15
Job, Yet could I not answer, but I would make supplication to my Judge: Job
10. 15.
If I have done wickedly, woe unto me: if I have done righteously, I will not
lift up mine head. Ro^. 7. 19.
Saint Paul speaking of his life confesses his infirmities, that the good that
he would do, he did not, and the evil that he would not do, that he did;
that his flesh was insolent against the spirit, and kept it under with a strong
hand, that his will like another Eve, was still provoking him to reach after
the forbidden fruit: that his nature was rotten in the root, so that when he
should be lifted up to heaven, with the wings of grace; he was kept down with
the leaden lump of the old man; like a bird which would fly upward, but is
kept back by a string tied at her leg; but he carried himself so
faithfully; so uprightly in his office, that he could not only say, which of
you can rebuke me of sin, but he seeing further into himself then another
man could, did truly say; I know nothing 1 Cor 4. 4
by my self, he disposed the secrets of God, his sound was heard like Ex. 28.
33.
Aarons belles, he did cry down sin in earnest, made Moses and Christ to
meet on the Luc. 10. 30. 34.
Mount, preached the law, which like the thieves wounds, then sets abroach
the Gospel, which like the Samaritan salueth, that the wounded conscience
might drink of the water. But what of all this? shall he, or can he glory in
it, or challenge any thing for it? noe 1 Cor. 4. 4.
I know (says he) nothing by my self, yet am I not hereby justified, for God,
who sees further into us, then we can into our selves, (for he is greater
then the conscience) spyeth imperfections in our best works, and in very deed,
the best men have some let, spot, or want, even in their very devotions: go to
prayer, when the best men have prayed, they had need to pray again, that God
would forgive the faults in their prayers; and therefore there is an Angel
that powers sweet odours into the prayers of the Saints, to show that they
yield no sweet savor to God, without favor in Christ: Go to love, Reu. 8. 3.
Peter loved much, but yet he did fault in his love, when he heard of the
passion, as he did afterward fall from b Mat. 16. 22.
his love, when the passion was hard at hand. We desire to be c Luc. 22. 57.
but conformable to the Angels, Mat. 6. 10.
( They will be done in earth, as it is in heaven) but the Angels are not
without blemish in his sight; and though there were no other thing, yet the
very corruption of our flesh it self does infect that, which of it self is
pure as a muddie ground does the clean water, and as an unsavory caske does
the good wine that is put into it.

This serves to condemn such, as rely upon their own merits, especially
such, as think Gods law too strait for their holiness; stand for
supererogation above law, supposing they are so far from need of mercy, that
they have satisfactions to spare for others, over and above their own
discharge; for when the Lord says, he will show mercy to the best, he
insinuates Luc. 17. 10
that when we have done all we can, we are unprofitable servants; and that
reward is given not according to our deserts, but according to the worthiness of
him that does bestow it: our merit is the mercy of the Lord, and as long as God
is manifold in mercies, man is manifold of deserts: indeed we are ready to
stand too much upon our good actions, and therefore the Psalmographer teaches
us to speak twice against our selves; Ps. 115. 1.
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give the praise: A good
man does that for which he came, not so as he can boast, but so as God
accepts it, while he pardons his weakness, so that our righteousness consists
rather in forgiveness of our sins, then perfection of our virtues, and when
God rewards us, he recompenseth us according to his own honor, not
according to the baseness of our own hearts, or the estimation we have of our
own worth.

Again this serves, for the comfort of those, which are determined to keep
the word of God, which enforce themselves to obey it, and to walk in the name
of the Lord their God for ever, yet groan under the burden of their sins, and
when they would do good, evil is present with them, calls at their doors,
craves entertainment, and of force will be their tennant; I say this is their
comfort to know, that God will show mercy, si faciunt pracepta, etsi non
perficiunt, if they keep his commandments in truth, though they fulfill them
not in perfection: God accepts that, which his children do willingly though
weakly, he takes the will for the work, and measuring the deed by the desire,
and the desire by sincerity, will show mercy, he will show it, it shall
appear and shine, as Saint Tit. 2. 11.
Paul speaks of the grace of God, as if the Lord had reared it up in the
midst of the firmament like the sun, that all the world might see it.

To thousands: The Lord is merciful and righteous, and our God is full of
compassion: Ps. 116. 5
I the Lord thy God, here the Lord is merciful: visiting the sins, here he
is righteous: showing mercy to thousands, here our God is full of compassion:
visiting sins to the third and fourth generation, not that he confines himself
to three or four discents, for when he had executed vengeance upon the
posterity of Ham; to the sixth and seventh generation; yet his wrath was not
turned away, but his hand was stretched out still; and showing mercy to
thousands; not that he ties himself to any set number, but making comparison
of justice and grace, he shows that he is more prone to mercy, and that this
mercy does outgoe his justice, as that other Discipel did out run Ioh. 20. 4
Peter, as they posted to the sepulcher. Justice is Gods left hand, mercy is
his right, now God is righthanded, he uses his right hand more then his left,
therefore that is the greater of the two: if his wrath like Nilus has
ouerflowed a while, at last like the floods in Ex. 15. 8.
Exodus, it stands still as an heap; or else like Jorden, it is driven back;
or is like the waters about Jerusalem, which might be dried up with l Ps. 1 14.
3
the tramplings of an army: Es. 37. 25
but his mercy is as the fountain of the gardens, Can. 4. 15
a Well of living waters, and the springs of Lebanon the one, like the garments
of the Gibeonites, worn out o Ios. 9. 13.
in a few discents, the other like the Deu. 29 5
garments of the Israelites in the wilderness, which did not wear; the one
like the wings of the Eagle in Dan. 7. 4.
Daniels vision, plucked off, the other r 1 King. 6 27.
like the wings of the Cherubims, never pulled in but ever stretched forth,
the one like 2 King. 4. 6.
the widows Oil which ran a while, and then ceased, the other like Ps. 133. 2
Aarons oil, for as that rested not on Aarons head, but ran down upon his
beard, and went down to the very skirts of his garments. So Gods mercy rests
not on the head, on the good father, but discendeth to his children, to the
next generation, and so along still to the lowest borders of his religious
issue. Gods mercy died not with Abraham, but stretched it self to his
righteous seed, from generation to generation: as the kindness of the
Athenians to that same good and just Aristides dyed not with him, but extended
it self to his posterity, for when he died so poor, that he left not to bury
him according to his place and desert, they respecting his children, gave his
son Lysimachus one hundred Minas, that is 240. pounds, and married his
daughters at the charge of the City.

This serves first, for the comfort of those good parents, which have a great
charge of children, and small means to leave them, who do not see the rivers,
and floods, and streams of honey and butter themselves, whose children
inheriting the wind, are like enough to be filled with poverty, this I say, is
a comfort to think, that though they cannot make their sons and daughters
plenteous in goods, though their hand did not get much, though they did not
heap up riches for them, though they did not lay up gold for dust, and the
gold of Ophir as the flints of the River; yet they shall leave them the
blessing of God, his mercy shall descend to them, which is as Maryes, the
better part and shall not be taken away from them, which will make that little
which they have, like the 2. Kin. 4. 6
widows Oil, to increase or raise them up friends to supply their want, as
it did Boaz unto Ruth: or teach them every one to say to his heart from a
contented mind, Ru. 2. 8.
this is my lot appointed by God, this little that I have suffices and
therefore I will not so often say with the multitude, who will show us any
good? as pray with David, Psa. 4. 6.
Lord, lift up the light of thy countenance upon us.

Again on the other side, this serves for the comfort of good children, which
descend of poor parents, but yet of such as fear God and eschew evil; to
think that though their fathers substance was not great, though he was not
fat in the earth, though there were no riches and treasures in his house,
though his Tabernacle did not flourish, though he could not bequeath unto them
Cattle, silver, gold, sheep or beeues, because he had but according to his
necessity, that which others have in abundance and superfluity: yet he 1.
Tim. 6. 6.
had the riches of the soul, godliness, which the Scripture calls great
riches, he was not plunged in the superstitions of Popery, nor would ever say
to the wood awake, or to Ex. 3. 2.
the dumb stone stand up, he was a temple of God, Gods spirit dwelt in him. And
therefore though the world did frown upon him, yet the blessing of God, and
the good will of him that dwelt in the bush did come upon his head, I now will
follow his steps, and be such a perfect pattern of his best parts, that he
that sees the suruiuor may know the disceased, and then I know though I cannot
have the world at will, yet I likewise shall have Gods blessing some other
ways, and the extent of his mercyes will reach unto me and mine, from one
generation to another.

Again this does win our hearts unto G^d* if not in piety yet in good nature,
how was Meph^bosh^th bound unto King David, that he would look upon such a b
dead dog as he was and show him mercy, and so great favor for Jonathan his
fathers sake, how much more are good children bound unto God, who shows mercy
to them for their fathers sake and to their children after them: who is
constant in his favors, who gives no period to his goodness, where there is a
true concurrence, whose promises are without conculsion, whose mercyes are said
everlasting, because when they begin they have no end, whose former favors are
patterns of his future blessings, and an earnest penny laid in hand, to assure
that which is to come, the foot of whose blessings on the father, are still
treading on the heels of the child.

Lastly to conclude this Commandment, as David wishing a curse upon his
enemies, says, Psa. 109. 14.
Let the wickedness of his fathers be had in remembrance with the Lord, and let
not the sin of his mother be done away, so on the other side let us wishing a
blessing upon our selves, as it were tie God to it by putting him in
remembrance of his mercyes to our good predecessors: So does Solomon at the end
of his prayer, 2. Cro. 6. 42.
Remember the mercyes to David thy servant: Solomon had many times desired God
to have mercy on his people, and used diverse arguments to persuade him to it,
but reserved the strongest, ( Ioh. 2. 10.
as the governor of the feast did the best wine until the last,) to the
shutting up of his prayer, that like a postscript it might not be forgotten:
and Ethan the Ezrahite seeing the desolation of David's Kingdom meruailes much
that he could not see the stream of Gods mercyes run on still as it had
begun, Psa. 89. 49.
Lord where are thy former mercyes, which thou swearest unto David in thy truth.

As therefore the Lacedaemonians, craving aid of the Athenians, did not once
mention the good that they the Lacedaemonians had done for them, but only the
kindness which they and their predecessors had received from them; so in craving
any thing of God, let us not allege our merits, for if we do well, Psa. 16. 2.
our well doing extends not to him, but the blessings that we and our
forefathers have received at his hands, as to say, O Lord thou did never
pull in thy hand from rewarding our fathers, or hold it out empty, but did
still teach what thou would do, by what thou hadest done, be still like
old Isaac, bless where thou have blessed, let thy favors to them be an
obligation, and bind thee to watch to do us good, though thou did give,
yet thy store was not abated, when they had the most, they did leave no less
behind, thou being infinite can not admit of any diminution, let thy
goodness, which is without lymit, stretch and stream from them to us and ours
for evermore.

The third Commandment.
Exodus 20. 7. Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vame: for the
Lord will not hold him guiltles, that takes his name in vain.
THE tongue is a little member, but it is an unruly a Ia. 5. 5. 8. 6.
evil, full of deadly poison: fire and water are two good servants, but two
bad masters, the tongue is fire, a good servant, if we overrule it, a bad
master if it overrule us; the best dish for Gods service, if it be well
seasoned with salt, the worst, if it stinkes and be corrupt, and therefore in
this Commandment God would bind the tongue to the good abearing, 1 Kin. 2 36.
and as Solomon does to Shemei, set down bounds to lymit it, that it
transgress not: here therefore first we have a hedge, secondly a binder: the
hedge first keeps out the beastly profanation of Gods name that it enters not
into us, secondly keeps us within the grounds of Gods glory, that we have a
care to hallow his name according to the first petition of the Lords prayer.

Gods name is profaned in Words in oaths swearing idly, when there is noe
use of an oath.

without oaths forswearing villanously, when we make it serve for an
unlawful use, thereby to bring a wicked purpose to pass.


Deeds

Our Savior Christ to teach us to avoid oaths, even the ^ Mat. 9.
least idle oaths sets down first his precept, swear not at all, then his
pattern for as the Angel to confirm the two Maryes in the faith of the
resurrection uses these words, Mat. 28. 7
Lo, I have told you: so does he in other cases the like words, as, if it
were not so, I would have told you: Again Ioh. 14. 2.
I tell you the truth, how often do we hear him speaking thus. Verily, verily
I say unto you, or using the like protestations, thus both the lesson of his
lips, and practice of his lesson must reach us that we suffer not oaths to
fly at all adventures, and wait on our words and talk of no importance, to
serve where our humor shall place them, that we defile not our tongues with
swearing at random, with an oath at the end of every word: But let men's
throats be open sepulchers and by swearing cast up a stinking savor into the
nostrells of God, yet they cloak them with excuses as Genesis 27. 16.
Rebeccah did cover the smooth of Jacobs neck with the skins of the Kiddes
of the Goats.

1 I swear truly says one, this is a salve for his sore not to heal it but
to hide it.

2 I shall not be believed without an oath says another, here is another
whorish complexion dawbed on, that this sin might not appear in it own
colors.

3 I mean no body any hurt says a third, but being used to let fall an oath
now and then, it drops from me with other words, before I am aware, this is
his figge-leafe.

4 I do not use oaths of sound says the fourth, but now and then a petty
trifling oath; that is nothing, that's not to be stood upon.

Thus sin is not without a shift, and it is a desperate fault that has no
plea, as it is a course wool that will take no dye, but plead not, this sin
is past all sufficient excuse able to bear it out; Mar. 10. 50.
with the beggar cast away this cloak, this wrinkle will not be hidden, and
howsoever you boulster this crompt shoulder, yet it is a blemish. To the first
sort: say the oath be true: truth is but one circumstance belonging to an oath:
Ier. 4. 2.
thou shall swear, the Lord lives in truth, in judgment, and in
righteousness, in truth, and therefore away with a false oath, 2. in judgment
and therefore away with a rash oath, in righteousness and therefore away with an
unlawful oath: say the oath with which we sport our selves be not false: yet
it may be idle, otiosum est, quod caret ratione just necessitatis, aut
intention piae vtilitatis, Mat. 12. 36.
and if we shall give account for idle words, shall not idle oaths be called
to a reckoning: shall not an Item for idle swearing be put in the counting
book, when idle speech is not without an Item? but do they always swear
truly, who suffer oaths to run always in their mouths, and toss them like
tennisbals, up and down at their tongues end? some gravel or mudde passes
away with much water, some lies with much talk, and false oaths upon lies,
and no marvel if he that swears often, does too often forswear himself,
nay a marvel, if he does not, how can he keep any faith or truth in him,
that swears it out continually, he swears it all away.

To the second sort, he that trusts thee, will believe thee without an oath, he
has experience of thy fidelity, and knows that neither fear nor love, gain
nor loss, can make thee eat thy word, and as Ioh. 19. 22
Pilate says Quod scripsi, scripsi, so an honest man, Quod dixi, dixi, that
which he has said, he has said, as though he speaks once Mat. 5. 37
and twice, yea yea, nay nay, as though his word were a double bond, his yea is
his oath, his word his obligation, his saying as current as his coin, so
strong that substantiuelike it can stand by it self, and needs no oath to
underprop it: but on the other side, he that believes thee not, the more thou
swearest, the more he mistrusts thee, thou have so often broken the head of
truth, and cracked thy credit, that thou art become bankerout, become like a bad
hound, who has so often spent his mouth upon no sent, that now the rest of the
hounds will lend no longer ear unto him, he has been ouerseene with
credulity dammaged by thy disapointment, thon have said Promitto did signify
to promise, and not to pay, and therefore he will lean no longer upon a broken
staff, he will trust thee upon thy obligation, not upon thy oath, upon thy
parchment, not upon thy prattlement, he will believe annulo, not animo,
knowing thou more regardest thy seal, then thy soul.

Iuras? credit minus, nou iuras? credere non vult. He will not believe thee if
thou swearest not, he will less believe if thou swearest; he will not take
thy bear word, much less will he take it, if it come covered with an oath;
but say thou meanest to deal honestly and truly, yet thou meetetst with some
men, with whom thy yea and nay will take no place, whereas thy oath would carry
the matter. In this case prefer Gods honor, before thine own credit, Jet
rather the incredulous suspect thee without a case, then God condemn thee for
transgression.

To the third sort, which writh and wreath like snakes to hide this sin,
under the covert of custom: I say it is true, every sin looks for continual
entertainment, where it has once gotten an haunt, as humors fall toward
their old issue. We are not weaned from usual evils, for custom hardens the
heart, and stiffens the neck, and seareth the conscience; it is a waterstreame
carrying us away, and we had rather follow the course of the stream, then row
against it: as soon shall a man learn to leave his mother tongue, as an usual
oath, it is faex in dolio, cleaves fast unto us, and is almost turned into
nature: the single cord is soon snapt a sunder, the double work is like to
hold out, Ec. 4 12.
but a threefold co^d is not easily broken. Sin is single in the thought,
doubled in the work, and trebled in custom, it begins in the buds of
infirmity, creeps to the twigs of negligence, and the slender twigge becomes
a stately tree, and that which at first with the hands might easily be plucked
up, being overtaken by custom, grows to a stowt tree of contempt, and will
hardly afterward with an axe be cut down, being readier to break then to
bend, to any good instruction: Genesis 42. 15. 16.
Joseph accustoming himself to the oaths of Egypt, swears again and
again, and if we go about to repel an accustomed sin, the devil does vex
us with soliciting, and say to us, as the people to Pilate: Mar. 19. 8
Do as thou have ever done? But it is therefore safely done, because it is
done commonly? shall we account this a good plea, we have so often used our
tongues to swearing, that now we cannot leave it; this is so far from
excusing us, that the plea is as bad as the fault, for oaths are precious, and
things precious through common use lose their estimation: neither will it
excuse us any more, when we shall come to be arreigned before the judgment
seat of God, then that Apology would the thief, who being indicted, desired
the Judge he might escape unpunished, for stealing was his custom from his
youth, and now he could not leave it, to whom the Judge replied, it was his
custom to give judgment against such malefactors; and therefore he must be
condemned: let therefore little by little good custom, shake off and pluck up
that, which evil costume has brought in and ingrafted, and the more deeply
it is rooted in us, the more pain let us take to root it up, and do the best
we can to cross this and every bad custom, yea though we cannot turn the
stream, yet let us swim against it.

To the fourth sort, which say they do not curse God, nor choppe his heart in
pieces, nor throwing his name to the ground, tread and trample it under their
feet, they do not like mad dogs fly in their masters face; indeed they deny
not, but that they use small oaths as, faith, troth, mass, cross, or the
like, and what matter is it, if they be so prodigal of these trifling oaths,
that they pawn them for every trifle at every word? To these I say; Our nature
is such, that we say of a great sin, as Lot of the City Zoar, Genesis 19. 20.
is it not a little one? and as when we have sinned, the devil shows us one
of his two false glasses, wherein he makes our sin appear so great, that it
cannot be forgiven: so before we have sinned he shows the other glass,
making the sin appear little, and the punishment none at all, the case being
thus; no marvel though we think we have yielded much if we acknowledge a
beam to be a mote, an heinous offense to be a crime, or a crime to be an
error: but howsoever men flatter themselves, yet thse petty oaths are great
faults, and to be refused in our talk, as poison in our meat, he that shall
give his fatih, and lay his truth in pawn, pawneth whatsoever is most precious
in his soul, and he that swears by the Mass, is as he that swears by Zeph.
1. 5
Malcham, against whom God will stretch out his hand to cut him off. Our
Savior Christ forbids them all by flat statute, Mat. 5. 34
swear not at all, mentioning certain oaths usual among the Jews, neither
by heaven, or earth; including in them all natural creatures, or Jerusalem,
including all artificial; I like his wit well, but give him no other
commendation, who sitting at a churles table, but yet an unbidden guest, would
be still swearing, by this meat, by this bread, by this cheese, by this
drink, that thereby he might take occasion to eat and drink with him, for it
confirms the matter, if a man takes down that, by which he swears,
insomuch as his host, weary of such a guest wished him to leave off his
swearing. Our Savior Christ dehorts us from these small common oaths, because
they have a bad beginning, Mat. 5. 37
whatsoever is more then yea yea, nay nay, comes of evil; proceeds from an
inward, and secret corruption, whereby the devil tempts us, and Saint Ia. 5.
12.
James disswades us from them, because they have as bad an end, and will have
men refrain them, lest they fall into condemnation: if no excuses are strong
enough to uphold these kind of oaths, which men reckon are of no reckoning;
then I need not to take pain to put down blasphemous oaths, for being a
heavy burden, they fall of themselves. To blame therefore are those dogs, which
make no bones in tearing Gods name, who cast up their children to God, as
though he were their underling, as an angry and fumish master gives his servant
a buffet with his fist. The common gamester, if he be on the loosing side, will
make his tongue run as fast against God, as Cards, Dice, and bowls do run
against him, he will rent and tear his name, as a draper rasheth out a piece
of cloth to the buyer, his oaths like hail-shot shall fly up and down the
room, where he has his loss. Let a man taking these injuries done unto
Christ as his own wrongs (for Christ took all our sins upon him) tell him of
his blaspheming, let him go about to bring home this Ass from going further
astray, as the law provided we should our neighbors Ass: let him cross him u
Ex. 23. 4
in his swearing, all this is but loss of diligence, there is no possibility
of reformation, persuasions are in vain, better suffer him in his fury, then
minister advice, his wound by meddling with it, is made the greater, and like
hot water by stirring, it casts up the more fume; say to wrest the strings of
his tongue in tune, they will snappe and break upon you, this old bottle will
break with new wine, the more you rub him, the more will this gald horse
kick, the more you touch him, the more will this toad swell, the more you
meddle with him, the more will this serpent gather poison in his throat, and
in his head to vomit out, go about to cool him, you shall but add to his
fire, and increase his heat, as the water does the heat in lime, and the
smithes forge, for he has sworn he will swear it out, and fill up his
periods with oaths of sound: go to the profane swaggerer, as he seldom
thinks upon God but in time of affliction, (for the crosse-house is his
schoole-house his adversity his university, his rue his herb of grace) so he
will seldom name him but in his oaths, of which he will upon small occasion
shoot such chaine-shot, that you would think he would make the windows of
heaven to shake and totter. The soldiers put Christ to death, but did not
break x Ioh. 19. 33.
a bone of him, but these gallants crucifying to themselves again the Son of
God break his bones, divide him into bones, hands, feet, blood, heart,
sides, curse and ban and champe him in their mouths.

I read of an adultresse wife, who having had three sons, told her husband
upon her deathbed, that she had turned to evil and committed a trespass
against him, that having forgotten the covenant of her God, other men had bowed
down upon her, and of her three children, one only was his, and so dyed
without further discovery, this father, desirous that the son begotten of his
own body might inherit his land and goods, making his last Will, entreated his
exequetors to use the best means they could to try out which of the three was
his natural son, and unto him he bequeathed his land and all that he had;
these exequetors, not like many other, which like vultures prey on the dead,
and as the Phoenix do rise on others ashes, told the children that their
fathers Will was doubtful, the land little, the goods not great, and divided,
what were they among so many? The best way was to try by hap hazard, which of
them should have all: Whereupon setting up the dead corpse against a tree they
delivered to every of them a Bow and Arrows, telling them, that he that could
shoot nearest the fathers heart, should carry the whole, the two bastards in
whom was never kindled any spark of natural affection, drew to the head and
shot with good will at the heart, but the third did feel nature so working in
him, that he refused so unnatural a fact, whereupon the wise and trusty
Exequetors, judging him to be the true son, delivered unto him his fathers
legacy, according to that saying;

-- Legum seruanda fides, suprema voluntas
quod mandat fierique iubet paerere necesse est.
Now if blaspheming swearers shall prepare their Bows and make ready their
Arrows within the quiver; that they may not priuiely, but openly shoot at
God, if they arm themselves to stricke him with some deadly wound; and letting
their oaths as arrows fly, pierce the honor of the most highest, it is an
argument they are bastards and not sons, and therefore Job. 39. 37.
with Job we must either lay our hands upon our mouths, and with David keep
Psa. 39. 1.
our mouths as it were with a bridle, or else set the fear of God as a Porter
at the door of our lips to examine our words before they go out. But as
the Lord having showed the Prophet Ez. 8. 8.
Ezechiell, the abominations of the Children of Israel, bad him dig in the
wall, and he should see yet greater abominations which they did; so though you
have already seen the abomination of the profane man in blaspheming God* Yet
dig deeper, and diue further into the words of his mouth, and you shall see
greater abominations; you shall have a man vow to do mischief, and then
strengthen himself in his sin by an oath, and then he thinks he must not
go back, for he takes his oath to be an entrance into band to perform his
vow. Such was the Ios. 9. 15.
oath of the Princes in a case of pity, and the oath of those forty men and
upwards in a case of cruelty; but it is a great fault to make such a rash Act.
23. 12.
vow, and therefore men should recall it, and being sorry for it, draw water
out of their hearts and power it out before the Lord: but to perform it
because of their oath is a double fault, for by this doing they make as though
God did patronize their sin, and as though he did approve of it. It was a
fault in Mar. 6. 22. 23.
Herod to promise the dancing damsel whatsoever she asked, even to the half
of his Kingdom, but to add an oath and grant her request, because of his
oath, and thereupon to send and behead John Baptist (for it was his head which
she desired) did double his fault: Genesis 49. 5
As Simeon and Leui were brethren in evil, so subtelty and cruelty sisters in
sin were combined in that usurper Richard the 3. subtelty took order for the
time, place, and means, when, where, and how the Lord Hastings should be
brought to loose his head, cruelty hastily undertook the Act and gave the
stroke but to behead him, not upon any just cause, without examination, without
any stay after his apprehension, because of his oath, (for he had sworn that
he would not dyne, till he did see his head from his shoulders, was a fault
far greater then would have been the breach of his unlawful oath: In Lattin an
oath is iusiurandum, ius must go before iurandum, and when that which thou
swearest is lawful and right, then pedem hinc ne discesseris, be sure thou
abide by it, else thou runnest into pariury which is an especial fault
forbidden in this Commandment. Leu. ^9. 12
Thou shall not forswear thy self: An oath has been always holden as most
religious Genesis 21. 23.
Abimelech took no other band of Abraham, for assurance that he should deal
well with him and his children after him then his own oath. Ios. 9. 4. etc.
The Gibeonites thought themselves safe enough, when Joshua and the Princes of
the congregation had sworn unto them to save their lives, though the oath was
wrested from them by subtelty; in the war betwixt Rome and Carthage when the
Carthaginians had taken Regulus a worthy Roman prisoner, they, upon his oath
only to return again, sent him home to Rome on a message, which when he had
performed, he returned back again a prisoner to Carthage, according to the
faith he plighted. Their own faith were the best pledges that the Emperor
Charles, and King Frauncis the first laid in pledge, when they made their
leagues, the one with the Souldian of Persia, the other with the Turk. Pharaoh
did never swear that Jacob should be buried in the land of Canaan, when he
dyed in Egypt, but he thinks it a foul fault, if he should keep Joseph (who
lived in his Dominion) from keeping touch with his father; and therefore says
unto him, Genesis 50. 6
Go up and bury thy father, as he made thee to swear: Act 7. 16.
The other Patriarchs as well as Joseph were removed into Sychen and put in
their Sepulchers, Ex. 13. 19
but there is an especial mention made of Joseph's bones, because of the oath,
for Joseph dying in Egypt, made the children of Isra^ll swear, that they
should carry his bones thence: Genesis 50. 25.
God who is called a witness, is called a revenger if we make no conscience of
an oath: Romans 1. 9
God chalengeth the children of Israel 2. Cor. 1. 23.
because they had forsaken him, and sworn by them that are no gods, Ier. 5. 7.
and threatens that they shall fall and never rise up again, which swear by
the sin of Samaria, Amo^. 8. 14.
that is by the Idols there worshipped. Yet is it a greater offense to swear
q by the true God falsely, then by a false god truly, for he cares not to
offend God, who abuses his name to color his lying, but he that shall do
this in an open assembly, when a matter shall come to try all before a Judge
betwixt party and party, is offensive to three persons. 1. Deo, quem peierando
contemnit, 2. iudici, quemmentiendo fallit, 3. innocenti, quem falsus testis
laedit to God, of whom he makes no reckoning, for as though he were a Knight of
the post, he brings him at a call to witness a lie at his pleasure, 2. to the
Judge, for he binding his lie with an oath, causes the Jury to bring in a
wrong verdict, and thereupon the Judge to give an unjust judgment, 3. to the
party innocent, for he robbes him of that which of right belongs to him, and
so is as well guilty of injury, as perjury, and if it were better r for a man
Mat. 18. 6
to have a millstone hanged about his neck and be drowned in the depth of the
sea then offend one little one, then what judgment remains, for him which
offends great ones, God in heaven that great Judge, the indge in earth, that
little god. Deu. 27. 17.
If there be a curse for him that remoueth the mark of the land, then how is
he accursed which by a false oath shall take away house and land, Mat. 25. 43.
if there be a curse against those which cloth not the naked, what shall
become of those which by their perjury strippe those that are clothed, Ex. 23.
4.
if we must deal well with our enemies Ass, how ill do they* deal which
upon their oath giving in a false evidence, shall make himself an Ass and
send him a begging: A man is known to be his fathers son by his manner of
going, they say, he has his fathers gate or going, Ep. 5. 2.
why walk in love, as he has loved us: 2. by following his fathers qualities,
1. Pet. 1. 16.
Be ye holy as I am holy. 3. By his speech now, God has sworn in his Psa. 8
9. 35.
holiness and will not lie, and therefore let a false oath never defile our
breath, let this poison never infect our heart or touch our tongue.

As Gods name is profaned, when the rod of pride being in men's mouths, they
strike God and despite him with their oaths, so again this may be done in
speech without an oath, as first when we profane his word, or any thing which
his word speaks of him, and again when we do so slightly speak of his
works, that there by no glory is gotten to his name. Gods word is profaned,
when profane men undertake to meddle with it, and to be prattling of it, for now
there is a ring of gold in a swines snowt and a precious pearl muzled up and
down in the mire; this serves to reprove bad ministers, for if they shall be
like bad minstrels, which sing one thing and play an other, not consonant to
that they sing; if like Shepherds they shall have a good voice, with which
they acquaint their flock, but not feet as good guides to go before them, if
extrinsecally they take heed to their flocks, but not intrinsecally to
themselves, as the Act. 20. 28.
Apostle advises; then do they dishonor God and his word, for in respect of
God, they make him like a goat which is fed with leaves, that is, with words,
and in respect of his word, they clippe the credit of it, for they would not
have believed (as it is in the Lamentations) that the adversary and the enemy
should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem, for the sins of her Prophets,
and iniquities of b Lam. 4. 12 13.
her Priests. This made a mad fellow desire a bad-liuing preacher to teach
him a nearer way to heaven, then that which he had pointed out in his sermons;
for he did not think that to be the nearest way, for that he did not go that
way himself; this made Origin to give full scope to his eyes to bring forth
floods of tears, for after he had committed a grievous offense; coming into
an open assembly gathered together to hear the word of God, and seeing none
present to expound it, he steps up into the pulpit, and being unprovided, did
think to speak of that text, which after he had opened his Bible, should
first present it self to his view: now the place of Scripture which he light
upon was this: unto the ungodly, c Ps. 50. 16 17.
said God, why do thou preach my law and take my covenant in thy mouth,
seeing thou hate to be reformed, and have cast my words behind thee?
Whereupon calling his sin to remembrance, and saying within himself truly,
that Genesis 27. 20.
which Jacob said untruly to his father Isaac, concerning the venison, the
Lord God has brought this text to my hand, and therefore did I find it so
quickly; surely the holy Ghost had a finger in it, and would have me keep my
mouth, as it were with a bridle, because I have sinned against heaven; he
clasped his book, this rebuke did break his heart, and he was full of
heaviness, his spirit was in perplexity within him, and his heart within
him was desolate, his tongue did cleave to the roof of his mouth, and did
comment upon the Text only with sighs and tears.

Secondly this serves to reprove such people as will be talking of
Scripture, and have the pure word of God in their mouths, when as yet they
are not washed from their filthynesse, Ex. 19. 10
God would not deliver his law before the people did sanctify themselves, will
God have them sanctified before they hear it, and will he have the
unsanctified busy their tongues about it. The word of God is clean, and
desires to come out of a clean vessel: Mat. 9. 17
it is new wine, and would not be out poored out of old bottles; it is good
seed, and would spring out of such, as have broken up their fallowed ground. g
Tit. 1. 15.
To the pure are all things pure, but to them that are defiled, and
unbelieving, is nothing pure, but they pollute that, which h Hag. 2. 13.
in it self is pure and clean: As the polluted person did the sacrifices, for
therefore were the sacrifices called unclean, as being unclean in themselves,
as Mat. 1. 7.
the blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or skiray, or scabbed, or
else offered by unclean persons, and k Leu. 22. 22.
by such as had minds and consciences polluted; circumcise therefore the heart,
as the Eagle casts her bill, and the adder slips l Deu. 10. 16.
off her old skin, 1 Cor. 5. 7.
purge out the old leaven; as the serpent spues up his poison, cast away the
old man, Mar. 10. 50.
as the beggar did his old cloak, when he was to speak unto Christ: Deu. 6. 7.
then talk of the word of God, when thou tarriest in thy house, and as thou
walk by the way, and when thou lie down, and when thou risest up,
otherwise thy good words are but splendida peceata, and thy lewd life, as a bad
string, bringes thy good words, as sweet music, our of all tune, they are an
abomination to God, he cannot suffer them, his soul hates them, they are a
burden unto him, and he is weary to bear them.

Again Gods word is profaned, when men abuse it to charms or any sorcery
whatsoever, when having lost any thing, they will have a sieve and a pair of
shieres, then by repeating a certain place of Scripture (which I will not
repeat, for let no man know that knows it not;) they think to find out the
finder, when having the toothache, or being forespoken, or pricked with a thorn
will have a Paracelsian character, or a blessing, or Pater noster, said for
their cure. Colloquintida rank poison, did make good nourishable meat p 2
King. 4. 41.
for the Prophet, but these men on the other side, with good food do poison
themselves.

As Gods word is profaned, when we turn it to a bad use, so also, when we
make no good use of it, the speaking of Gods mercies, should restrain us from
sin, as the very name of a father, did Genesis 27. 12.
Jacob from subtlety and lying, till Rebeccah his mother did egg and draw him
to it, and as the speaking of a good Ge^. 39. 8.
master did Joseph from adultery, when his mistrisse spoke unto him day by day
to commit it: the speaking of Gods correction of other should be a direction
for us, and paternes pensiled out to us; not that we should insult over them,
but aliena insania fruentes, consult against our own misery, if we can speak
of others woes, and not grow wise, if we cannot take a pearl out of the
serpent, or a good stone out of the toads head, or gather with the Be sweet
honey out of the bitter weeds, if we do not draw the better, when we see one
horse whipped in the teame, if we cannot make use of their death, by whose life a
man could reap no benefit: If we can read or speak of Gods judgments on 1
King. 22 34.
Ahab and 2 King. 9. 33.
Iezabell, and yet gine our selves to oppression, if read or speak of his
proceeding against Act. 5. 5. 10.
Ana^ias and Saphira, and yet give our selves to lying, if we do not set a
memorandum on his punishments and mark his spitts with our stars, if we
read them and there an end; if we bring them forth of our mouths as untimely
fruit, which dies as soon as it is borne, then do we profane the word, and
so take Gods name in vain, and may be taxed with the ungodly to whom God said,
Ps. 50. 17
thou have cast my word behind thee, quoties legis, toties negligis, thou do
no sooner getit, but thou do forget it.

This as it serves to condemn the negligent and careless, so most of all,
such as make a mock of Gods word, and will not believe it; and secondly, such
as make a jest of his word, and delight to make themselves merry with it.

The first sort are they, which sitting in the seat of the scornful contemn
the word, and t^ead religion under their feet; of whom David complains, when
he says, the proud y Ps. 119. 51.
had him exceedingly in derision, because he studied the law of God, whom 2
Pet. 3. ^
Peter charge with this, that they said, where it the promise of his coming?
they said because the world had continued so long, it should still continue as
it had done without alteration, and as when Ge^. 19. 14
Lot said unto his sons in law, Arise get you out of this place, for the Lord
will destroy the City, seemed to them, as though he had mocked; so tell these
of the judgment day, they say, there is no such matter, they be but words,
and words are but wind, where is it? let it draw nigh, that we may see it: and
though it were so that others should perish, yet there shall no harm happen
unto us, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at
agreement, though a scourge run over and pass thorough, it shall not b Es. 28.
15
come at us.

The second sort are they, which make the word of God their minstrell, which
sport themselves with scripture, and think no other mirth so cordial unto
them, such a one was he, who, as though he had been borne with ink in his
mouth, did so soon foul his paper with Pruritanus.

Lastly Gods word is profaned, when we will hurt the truth, which is done many
ways: First when we maime the sentences, as the devil, when he alleged the
91^ Psalm, cuts off these words, Mat. 4. 6.
to keep thee in all thy ways; and the Pope, who when Christ says, Mat. 26.
27.
drink ye all of this, scrapes out all, and regards not all, but says the
Priest shall drink for all.

Secondly, when we add unto the word, as the Jews did traditions, by which
they Mat. 15. 6
made the commandment of God of no authority, as for example, the law was, no
leper might come into the Temple; the tradition of the Pharisees was, that if
they uncovered the roof of the Temple and let him down, as the porters
uncovered the roof of the house, Mar. 2. 4.
and let down the palsy man and set him before Jesus, this was no trespass,
no transgression: whereas the Le. 13. 46
truth was, that no leper should be in the Temple, whither he did come in, were
brought in, or were let down, and therefore though Vzziah did come clean into
the Temple, yet when God did stricke him for usurping the Priests office, and
when the leprosy did rise up in his forehead, Azariah 2 Chr. 26 19. 20.
the chief Priest, with all their Priests caused him hastily to depart thence,
and he was even compelled to go out, because the Lord had smitten him.

Thirdly, when we alter some word in it, as Alcumists would change the
substance of Metals, like them who take Mat. 27. 46. 47.
Ely, for Elias, and as they, who to get honor to the virgin Mary, in stead
of he translate, she Genesis 3. 15.
shall break thy head, as they which in our Ladies Psalter (for so they term
it) attribute that unto the Virgin, which the holy Ghost does attribute to the
Father and the Son, and as they, which thinking men are not so subject to
sin, as though they were bond-slaues of Satan, translate prone unto evil, in
stead of evil, when the Scripture says, the Genesis 8. 21
imagination of man's heart is evil, even from his youth: there is a worm
Clerus, which destroys and marres Honycombes, and the popish Clerus is like
unto it, which would this way corrupt the word, which is sweeter then honey and
the honey comb.

Fourthly when we will seek all the corners of our wits, to color the
Scriptures, because we think that men would otherwise reject and condemn
them, as for example, the Scripture says, election is of grace, now say some,
if it were so, then God should be an accepter of persons, therefore they think
to help it thus, God chose some because they would be ready to receive his
grace, and so they compose the matter like those, who when they see the Papists
do attribute to much unto works, and the Protestants, according to the
Scriptures, say, we are saved by faith, will as men indifferent step in, and
make a mean betwixt them, saying, faith is the chief Pillar: Job takes up his
friends for their too much kindness in this case, Job. 13. 7. 8. etc.
will ye speak wickedly for Gods defense, and talk deceitfully for his case?
and tells them that if they contend for God, and make a lie for him, as one
lies for a man (for bad cases may be so well handled that they may bleare the
eyes of men) they neither conceive his Majesty, nor yet know their own
infirmity, and therefore may be laughed at, as Elihu in the person of God
mocketh Job. 34. 31.
Job, if I see not, teach thou me, if I have done wickedly, I will do no more,
as if he should say, let me know where I have done amiss, and I will be ready
to mend it: God likes not those nor will ever thank them for their kindenes,
which will lend him false colors, he will break those false glasses which
do not represent his own face.

To conclude this point, we hurt the truth, when we adulterate the sense of
Scripture, and change the meaning of it, when we take a wrest to make the tune
sound to our key, when as though we had the wind in a bag, we make it blow
with oursayles; when we make it the hindge, and rudder, to turn all about as
we please: when we fit it to our fancies, imitating Scyron and Proc^stes, who
fitted the passengers to the bed of brass, which they had framed to their
own bigness, if they were to long for the bed, they cut of their legs for
catching cold, if to short they rackt them at length, like those which set
Paul's Epistles on the tenters, and would make them walk a mile or two further
for their fancyes, then ever the holy Ghost meant to go, such are they which
invent viperous glosses to eat out the bowels of a text, as quirking heads
have found ways to eat out the meaning of good laws, which in stead of
natural milk, which the Church gives out of her two breasts the Old and New
Testament, enforce out the blood of violent interpretation: as he Pro. 30. 33.
which wringeth his nose causes blood to come out, as this is done at other
times so then, when we understand plainly that which is spoken by a figure,
and contrariwise, figuratively that which is to be taken in the literal sense,
for the first the Pharisees did wrong to the law, who following the bare words
defrauded the meaning, and the more they bound themselves to the show of the
letter, the further they were from the truth: As for example Deu. 6. 8.
Thou shall bind the commandments for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall
be as frontlets between thine eyes, hereby God commanded the meditation and
practice of his law, but hereupon the Pharisees got two lists, skroles or
pieces of parchment, and therein they wrote the two tables, putting one on
their left arms next their hearts, and binding the other to their brows,
(which custom the Jews observe to this day) and then they thought they might
well say with the servant, Luc. 14. 22.
Lord, it is done as thou have commanded: again, beware of Mar. 8. 15
the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod: hereby Christ meant
the corrurpt doctrine of the Pharisees, the adultery, incest, unlawful vows,
swearing, dissimulation, and cruelty of Herod; but the Disciples (for indeed at
that time they had forgotten to take bread) said, it was because they had no
bread, these are like those simple men, who if they should hear us say,
deuorem^^ hominem, would by and by gather that we would turn Cannibals, or
like the foolish patient who eats up the paper, when the Physician bids him
take the Recipe, that he prescribed unto him.

For the second, as we must not take that plainly, which is spoken by a
figure, for many times the sense of the Scripture, is against the show of
words, and the show of words against the trut^: so on the other side, we must
not understand that figuratively, which is to be taken in the literal sense;
for then we wrest the rule of truth: for example, our Savior Christ says unto
Peter, Lu. 5. 4.
launch out into the deep, and make a draught, here is a Text, say some, to
prove that Peter's successor, which they say is the Pope, shall catch the great
fish of Constantines donation, for they feign that Constantine the great, gave
unto the Bishops of Rome, the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over all, but both
Ecclesiastical and Political over the west parts of the world, and this they
say was meant, when he bad Peter launch out, whereas by such gathering, they
reap that, which the holy Ghost sowed not; Not but that one text may have two
senses, literal, which the very words understood aright do import, mystical,
when they conteyne a deeper mystery, but the mystical is not known to be the
meaning, except God himself reueales it, for example, Deu. 25. 4
thou shall not muzell the mouth of the Ox that treads out the corn: this
is plain, the cattle that work must eat, but this litterall sense is but
chafe, the mystical is the corn, and with the Apostles we must Mat. 12.
pluck the ears of corn, and rub them with our hands. In the first Jacobs
rods are covered with rindes, in the second they are in part pilled, Saint
Paul shows us the corn, and takes the pills from it, when he says, 1. Cor.
9. 9
does God take care for Oxen? Nay he had a further reach in it, to teach that
they who sow spiritual things should reap carnal things: Again, Ex. 12 4^
ye shall not break a bone of the Paseball lamb, here is a bone, and there
is marrow in it, the first is the outward shell, but Saint John Ioh. 19. ^6.
expoundes this of Christ's bones, there is the inward kernel. The first is the
foot of Genesis 28. 12.
Jacobs ladder next the earth, the second is the top of the ladder reaching to
heaven; in the first thy mother and thy brethren stand without, O Christ, and
cannot find thee: in the second with the Disciples they are within, and lean
upon thy bosom, and therefore the first of these senses must call for the
second, as one depth calls an other. If we go no further then the' first,
with Abraham's c Ge^. 22. 5
servants we stay with the Ass, that is our foolishness at the foot of the
hill, but if we go to the second, with Abraham we go up to the mount, and
Eze. 1. 16
with Ez^chiell see a wheel in a wheel, the wine of the spirit in the dregs
of the letter, but yet withal, we must take heed, we go not to a mystical
sense, except we have the word for our warrant, for Mat. 2. 9.
the wise men went no further, then they were guided by the star, and the
star no further then Christ, if we strain a text too high, we must know
the note above Ela is a iarring note, and makes a discord in the Harmony, and
if we climb with Duns his ladder, we may be sure, we cannot come down
without a fall, if we wrest the truth, we wrong the truth, and so profane the
word, and contrary to this commandment take the name of God in vain.

As Gods name is profaned, when his word is profaned, so likewise, when we
profane any thing which his word speaks of him, for as Bishop Latimer upon
the first petition of the Lords prayer, Whatsoever is spoken of God in his
word, that is his name.

First therefore if we profane his bare titles, and abuse his name unto lying,
as Jacob did, when he said unto Isaac, Genesis 27: 20.
the Lord thy God brought it, that is, the venison to my hand, if we abuse it
to coniuring, as the Act. 19. 13
Exorcists, who took in hand, to name over them, which had evil spirits the
name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preaches:
If we abuse it to cursing, as when we say, God confound me, or God plague
him, if we abuse it to blessing, as when we say, God speed you, if we see men
working of mischief, as though we did make our selves accessory, and as though
God would patroniz^ that wickedness, they had in hand, and would further their
work, if we abuse it to color any impious practice, as does the Pope in the
beginning of his instruments, and therefore it became a common byword among
the Germans, In ^omine Dei ineipit omne malum, all mischief begins in Gods
name, then do we profane his glorious name.

Again, when we profane his properties, as his mercy, his justice, his power,
his providence,

First his mercy, if we abuse it, and take thereby occasion to sin, making it
a pack-horse to bear the burden of our sins; when we do not only hope, but
as though hope were out of his wits, we presume, and say, let us continue in
sin, that grace may a bound; we are not under the law; but under grace,

Secondly, His justice, when we being uncharitable in our censures, condemn it
of cruelty, and therefore challenge nothing, in the blood royal of the valiant
conqueror of the Tribe of Judah; Mat. 8. 32
but suffer the devil to drive us headlong, as he did the heard of swine, to
the lake of desperation.

Thirdly, His power, when we abase it to the state of our infirmities, as the
Jews, who breaking his arm short off, brake out into these words, Ps. 78. 19
Can he prepare a table in the wilderness, or provide flesh for his people:

Fourthly, His providence, when men say, God lets the world go at havoc, and
though his providence be the nurse to bring all things up; as his power is the
mother to bring all things forth, and thoug the one keeps all things in
reparations, as the other sets up their frame, yet they say, things here below
are ruled by haphazard; the heavens meddle not with earthly things, Fortune
swaies all, though they paint her blind, yet they think she can guide the
uniform order that is in the world, and in all the parts thereof, though they
paint her standing on a bowl, and turning with every wind; yet they think
she can rule and welde others howsoever she be unconstant and carried away
her self:

Te faciunt fortuna, deam coeloque locarunt.

Thus while men like beastly Epicures hold this fantasy, that God sits in
heaven idly and at ease, and will never encomber and trouble himself with
the rule of the world, while they had rather make a false God of Fortune, then
acknowledge the truth of Gods providence, they attribute unto God eyes without
sight, ears without hearing, might without mind, mind without reason, will
without goodness, yea, and a God head without properties peculiar to a
godhead, and while they speak vainly of the appurtenances, they take his name
in vain.

Again Gods name is profaned, when men slightly pass over the wonderful
works that he has done; if we regard not the works of the Lord, and the
operation of his hands, but speak of them, as if the frequence thereof caused
neglect, if we do not say unto God Ps. 66. 3.
How terrible art thou in thy works, but make but little reckoning of them,
because common custom has inured us to them, then we take his name in vain.

This serves to reprove those which will not stamp this character, Ecce, even
upon those works of God, which are triuiall, as if seeing but a spiders web
they do not say, what a wonderful work of God is this, that such a simple
creature should weaue such nets out of it own bowels; or seeing but the honey
combs, do not say, what a strange thing is this, that the most cunning
Geometrician cannot observe a iuster proportion in any thing he does by art,
then these silly bees do by nature in the platform of their buildings: but
especially it serves to reprove such, as will seek out natural reasons, of
Gods immediate and supernatural works, with whom, Mat. 11. 4
Go tell John what you have seen, is no sufficient argument to prove the
Messiah, for they will fetch a reason even of extraordinary events, be they
never so strange, or else conclude, it is but their ignorance of the cause,
there is a reason, though their wits be so shallowe, they cannot sound it.

Lastly as the name of God is profaned by our words, so by our works, when
speaking like Angels we live like devils, when aliud proponentes, aliud
supponentes, like Lillies we be fair in show and foul in sent, Ro^. 2. 24
for now like the Jews we give occasion that the name of God is blasphemed;
This serves to condemn such Gospellers' as are Gospelspillers, these blots of
goodness, which use religion for a fashon, or as a cloak in the rain which
they lay away in the house, for others are backward in drawing nigh unto God,
when they see the lewd lives of such, as make such fair protestations, that a
man would think, they would run upon God for haste; let not therefore thy life
be like silver dross ouer-layd upon a potsheard, let not thy outside be lambs
wool, and thy inside fox furre, let not thy staple be fine, and thy liver so
corrupt that it putrify the flesh, if thou speak of the name of God, and
thy good life does not speak for thee, thy simulata sanctitas, thy counterfeit
holiness is double ungodliness, for in naming God thou defilest his name, and
causest others to say, lo this is the man that acts so high a part; I like
not these fellows which have Jacobs voice, which speak as though nothing but
Gospel could drop from them; for you see how, as though they had Esaus hands,
they be rough in their dealings, they lean upon the Lord, and say as they in
Michas, Mi. 3. 11.
Is not the Lord among us, and yet they turn aside by their crooked ways:
thus they which shame goodness by seeming good, and cause Religion to be
less regarded, run with full sail into the breach of this Commandment; but
let this suffice, to have spoken of this hedge or fence extrinsecally, so far
forth as it keeps out such beasts, as would profane the name of God, now a
word or two of it intrinsecally, as it keeps us within the grounds of Gods
glory, that we have a care to get glory to his name.

A sinner sits in sin by consent, lies in it by working it, sleeps in it by
custom, every one of these must arise, and not arise only; but as it was said
to the palsy man, Luc. 5. 23
Arise and walk: we arise by eschewing evil, we walk by doing good, we
purchase no greater displeasure by committing iniquity, then omitting of duty.
The Mat. 25. 26. 45.
slothful servant, and they on the left hand, are endited and condemned for
sins of omission, and therefore as this Commandment charge us, that we do
not dishonor God by committing sin: So on the other side, it warns us to
glorify God in giving, and getting him honor, by our words and deeds, and
first in our words by our oaths, for as God, who is the truth not deceiving
cannot be more dishonored, then when he is called to witness a lie, for in
this case the holy Ghost uses the word, defiling: Leu. 19. 12
Ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shall thou defile the name of
thy God: so can he not be more honored, then when he is produced to testify a
truth and therefore Gods service, and a lawful oath are coupled together when
the holy Ghost says, Deu. 6. 13
Thou shall serve him, and swear by his name: this condemns the Heretics
Cathari, which affirmed that it was not lawful for a Christian man to swear
for any cause at any time, but because one iarring string is enough to bring a
whole noise of music out of tune, let us see here what strings we must harp
upon, to make a sweet concord.

First the persons that swear must be such as fear God, and eschew evil,
for Moses the Captain of the Israelites places Deu. 6. 13
fearing God, and eschewing evil serving him in the forewarde, the swearing by
his name in the rereward, and Saint Paul as though he liked well this mustering
of Moses, mentions the true service, he does unto God, when he calls him to
witness, Ro^. 1. 9.
God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit: Job. 16. 17 16. 19.
and Job uses the like kind of trayning, when in Marshalling he first sets
out the integrity of his life, then, my witness is in the heauin, and my
record is on high: the mouth of other, which magnifying themselves use to say,
God is privy to my heart, he knows my care, when as yet they are but
hypocrites, and full of infection should be stopped, as the lips of the leper,
were covered Leuit. 13. 45.
according to the law, and if they come publicly to depose, a good Magistrate
should rebuke them, as Christ did the unclean spirit, saying; Mar. 1. 25
hold thy peace and come out.

Secondly they must not in this case be voluntary men, but stay for a call, as
Abraham's servant did, whom his master z Go^. 24. 3
caused to swear, for a man's forwardness in offering himself brings great
suspicion, that he is prodigal of his credit, and of his souls health.

Thirdly the person called to witness, must be the God of heaven and earth, for
by him does Abraham minister an oath, Ge^. 24. 3
I will make thee swear by the Lord, and Jeremy commands it, Ier. 4. 2.
thou shall swear, the Lord lives, and therefore the Egyptians were to
blame, to swear by the life of their King, the Scythians by his throne, and
Nouatus, who ministering the Communion to the people, used to swear them by
that, they had in their hand, that is, the Sacrament, as the Papists did by
their Mass, and by their other Idols; but he that swears by Malcham, and
that shall say. Am. 8. 14.
thy God O Dan lives, robs God of his honor, and gives too much unto an
Idol, attributing unto it wisdom to see into the breast, and power to punish
him that shall bind his lie with an oath, and reward him that shall swear in
truth, in judgment, and in righteousness,

As there are rules for the persons, so for the matter, it must be a known
truth, for a man must not swear that which is false, and he knows it false,
nor that which is true, if he thinks it false, nor that which is false though
he thinks it true, for a wise man looks or he leap, Ec. 2. 14
his eyes are in his head, and 5. 1.
he is not rash with his mouth, and 10. 2.
his heart is at his right hand.

Again we must not produce the name of God, in matters of no moment, but in
such as shall be of great importance, marriage is a weighty matter, and if a
man will not undo himself, when he ties himsele fast, if he seeks a godly
seed, he must join himself with such a wife as is not separated from God,
for men do not Mat. 7. 16
gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles, there fore Abraham swears his
servant in a matter of marriage, that he shall not take a wife for his son
among the Idolaters, but in a Genesis 24 3
godly family: it is a shame to plaintiff and defendant, and a dishonor done
to a great man to produce him, either ad testificandum or respondendum in a
matter, that is not worth the speaking of, much more shameful is it for a man
to dishonor the great God in calling him out of heaven, and making him wait
in matters of no weight, to serve where his humor shall place him: let
therefore other means, Ex. 18. 22.
as inferior Officers, end smaller causes, but let God have his glory, as
another Moses, in determining doubtful matters, when they shall be of great
importance.

As we must bring glory to God by our oaths, so by our speech, without oath
first in speaking of his word, when leaving the book that is clasped up to the
Lamb and the Trinity; our tongues are occupied in his statutes, so as on the
one side God shall not have cause to complain on us, as of the Jews, Hos. 8.
12.
I have written unto them the great things of my law, but they were counted as
a strange thing, and on the other side man shall have cause to give us the
commendation, which S. Luc. 24. 15
Luke does the two disciples going to Emmaus, who as they went did not busy
their tongues about slandering or vain words, but talked of the death and
resurrection of Christ.

Secondly in speaking (...) his nature, of his name, as David naming (...)
glory, Psa. 50. 1
the Lord, even the most mighty (...) two ^isciples naming Jesus (...) Luc. 24.
19.
of Nazareth a Prophet mighty in (...) we speak of Kings, we make their names
glorious, when the 1. Cro. 29 26.
Scripture mentions the death of King David, it makes four wheels whereon
the height of his honor did run, David had reigned over all Israel super
totum Israelem, super, therefore he was a superior, 2. he reigned, therefore
he was a principal superior, 3. not a superior or King of an infamous
Kingdom, as Ogge the King of Basan, but over Israel, a Country which if God
Ios. 12. 24
had fashioned the world like a Ring, as he did like a Globe, might have been
the Gemme of it, 4. not Regulus over part of the Kingdom as the one and
thirty Kings before David's time, 1. Kin. 12. 17. 20.
and Rehoboam and Jeroboam, who succeeded his son Solomon, and parted the
Kingdom, or as the three sons of Brute, among whom their father parted this
Island, or as one of the seven Kings which were in England in the reign of the
Saxons, but an absolute Monarch, super totum over all Israel: so when we
speak of our gracious King James either in our private instruments, or in his
Letters Patents, we make him glorious in his Titles, James by the grace of God
of England, Scotland, France and Ireland King defender of the faith etc. so in
styling a noble man we do not derogate from his honor in barring or abasing
his titles, and shall we not then make his name glorious, who is King of Kings,
God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, as to fay with Abraham, Genesis 24. 3.
the Lord God of the heaven, and God of the earth: the King of Israel, Judge
among the heathen, Lord of hosts with addition of every other style
whatsoever, by which the Scripture does set out his glory: so likewise must we
glorify God in speaking of his nature and properties, as of his mercy, to say,
there is mercy with God, that he might be feared, there is justice in God, for
he rewards every man according to his works: power and vengeance belong unto
God, for he is a consuming fire, by which he takes away all the ungodly of the
earth like dross, as he did the Sodomites: there is providence and great
loving kindness in God, by which the Lions, being savage beasts, became men in
humanity toward Dan. 6. 22 13.
Daniell, when men, which are kind by nature, became savage beasts in cruelty
against him: by which the flame was martyred with spending her heat, when the
three Dan. 3. 25
children, as so many Salamanders, were in the fire: Again we must set out the
glory of God, in declaring his wonderful works, even before the sons of
men, for if the builders of Babell did think to make themselves famous by
making the Tower; shall Genesis 11. 4.
not God get him a name by the works of his hands? now all the works of God
are wrapped up in three large volumes; the heavens, the earth, and the sea, the
heavens declare the glory Psa. 19. 1.
of God, and the firmament shows his handy work, what a thing is this, that
the Sun should rejoice as a Giant to run Psa. 19. 5. Josh. 10. 13.
his course, and again, that it should stand still as in the days of Joshua,
go back as in the days of Ezechias, and being Esaias. 38. 8. Luc. 23. 45
ever bright, should lose it light as at the passion of Christ? The earth is
full of the goodness of the Lord; what a thing is this, Psa. 33. 5.
that it being founded upon the seas, and prepared upon the Psa. 24. 2. Job.
38. 5.
floudes, and being poysed in the just proportion by line and measure, should
abide steadfast, when the high mountains, which do as it were imbosse the
earth, may seem able to shake it, ouersway it and tumble it into the sea.

They that go down to the sea in ships see the wonders Psa. 107. 23
of God in the deep, is not the Whale a wonder in nature, that Psa. 104. 26.
takes his pastime in it? is not the ship it self an artificial wonder, that
Merchandise should go from countery to countery in such a wooden conueyance,
if we do not speak of these and all his other works (for his name is stamped
upon them all) to his glory, we do in speech, though we swear not, take his
name in vain, as God must win glory by our words, so by our deeds, when being
transformed into the image of Mat. 17. 4.
Christ, we shine before other like lights, as the face of Christ, when he was
trasfigured on the Mount did shine like the Sun; therefore minds and souls
are likened unto Lamps, because we should shine each unto other, superiors to
in feriours, in being talking laws and walking Statutes, inferiors to
superiors, in being like the tree in Genesis, fair to look upon, Genesis 3. 6.
1. Pe^. 3. 1.
every one owes good example as a due tribute, that God may have the glory due
to his name, and thus much of this fence or hedge both ad extra and ad intra,
as far forth as it keep out beasts, and keep the good Christian within the
bounds of Gods glory.

The binder of this hedge is the rod of Gods Judgments, the Lord will not
hold him guiltles that takes his name in vain.

The sin of the blasphemy has been so odious, that even civil authority
has set sharp censures upon it, Henry the first and Maximilian the Emperor,
set fines upon their heads, which should open their mouths to swear vainly,
the greatest fines upon the greatest persons, as being not only guilty of the
sin it self, but of the bad example they gave unto other.

Ludouicke, commonly called Saint Lewis, caused the lips of blasphemers, to be
seared with an hot iron: Philip the French King did punish this sin of
blasphemy with death, yea though it were committed in a Tavern, where many
wise men many times forget themselves.

But if any did bind two sins together by binding a lie with an oath, few
nations had any pity on him. The Egyptians did strike of his head, because
thereby faith and truth among men might be decayed; in this case the Scithian
did suffer death, and he that made proof of perjury should have his goods. The
like did Philip an Earl of Flanders, decree for the precinct of his dominion,
King Edmond before the Conquest, (as Gregory the 9. in another place) gathered
a Council at London, where he made this law, that periurers should be
separated from the company of God, and our law (as I have read) is, that if a
false verdict given by twelve men be found, the twelve men be attainted, and
their judgment shall be the same that is appointed for petty treason, their
meadows shall be ared up, their houses broken down, their woods turned up, and
all their lands and teneme^ts forfaited to the King: but laws of men are like
cobwebs, little flies hang fast, great flies break forth.

But let men wink at this sin of blasphemy, of perjury, and suffer it to go
scot-free, yet God will not put it up so, the the periurer sins against God,
and who shall plead for him. It is reported in the Acts and Monuments of the
Church, and Mr. Fox takes the story out of Eusebius, that when Narcissus, a
good Bishop of Jerusalem, intended to accuse three notable malefactors of their
misdemeanors, they (dealing as that lewd husband, who having disordered
himself abroad, lost his money at dice, and wasted his goods, and now thinking
his wife would be in his top, comes home and begins to chide first) thought
to prevent his accusations by accusing him first, and laying a grievous crime
to his charge, and to get credit to their accusation, each of them bound it
with their several oaths; one wishing to be consumed with fire, if it were
not true: an other to die of some grievous disease, the third to loose both his
eyes; Narcissus seeing three to one was odds gave place; but what became of
these perjured fellows: the first was consumed by casulaty, of a spark of
fire, he, his family, and all that he had: the second was taken with a strange
sickness from top to the toe, which brought him to a miserable end, the third
seeing Gods judgments upon his brethren in evil* confessed the fault, for
which he continually shed such abundance of tears, that he wept out his eyes.

In latter time within the memory of man, the eleventh of February, Anno 1575,
A certain woman (her name was Anne Aueries) forswearing her self at a shop in
woodstreet of London, praying God she might sink where she stood, if she
had not paid for the wares she took, fell down presently speachles, and with
horrible stincke died.

Thirdly this serves for our instruction, to teach us to sift our words, to
let them be prius ratione, quam prolatione, prius ad limam, quam ad linguam;
for the tongue is placed near under the brain and understanding part, as at
the feet of her schoolmaster, that it might not run before the wit, and the
heart is counsailor to the tongue, that it might have a good guide above and
beneath: sport thy self with oaths, thou make sport with Iud. 17. 30
Sampson who will pull the house about thy ears: set thy self against heaven,
and curse God: thou dealest with fire, which will burn all that touch it, Heb.
1. 7
he makes his Angels a flame, and 12. 29.
and himself is a consuming fire; hold up a staff, the dog is afraid, here
God holds up his rod, here a Lion roareth in the forest, and who will not be
afraid, here is a snare set, and he will not take it up, until he takes the
blasphemer in it.

Again this serves for confutation of such, as make no reckoning of an oath,
as Lysa^der, who being charged with the breach of the league, whereunto he was
sworn in Miletus, answered, tush, we may go beyond men and beguile them with
oaths, as with aples and trifles, we train and deceive little children:
again such, as though they think they must keep touch with others: yet they
think, they may break their oath with Infidels, as Thyestes in the Poet, Ego
vero fidem neque ded^ infidel^ cu^quam, neque do: as though Gods Majesty did
depend on men's deserts, and they might abuse his name to wrong those, which do
not give God his right, 3. such as hood themselves with Hypocrisy, who have a
double heart, whose hearts and tongues are not made of the same flesh, who use
congruity in thought; but in word commit solecisme, whose mouths belie their
hearts, as their fingers belie their mouths, who harken to Gregory the 13. who
sending certain tokens to such as were to be reconciled to him, did set down
in them this goodly poesy, fili, da mihi cor and sufficit: such a one was he
which said, iuraui lingua, mentem iniurata^ gero, I mean as truly, as a man
upon his deathbed, though I speak as falsely, as one that makes Almanacks.
4. Such as patronize this sin with some cunning shift, as that Captain, who
having made a truce for certain days, brake out in the night, saying that
truce was made for days, and not for nights. And that Roman Soldier, who
being taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, and dismissed by Hannihall, upon
oath given to return again to the Camp, craftily lest his sword behind him,
and being gone a little way, returned back to the camp to fetch his sword,
and now thinking he had performed his oath, never meant to come there again:
but the Romans sent him back again, as a perjured person, for that they
thought an oath was so to be performed, as he, to whom the oath was made, did
understand the promise. Lastly this makes against the Pope, who dispenses
with an oath, yea with the oath of allegiance, which Subjects make unto their
Prince; the law of God bridles the hands from working treason, n touch not mine
anointed: of our selves we forbear to Ps. 105. 15
touch that which is anointed, but if a Caveat be put in, we are the more
wary: in these words are both these, touch not mine anointed: It bridles the
mouth that we speak not ill of the King, Ex. 22. 28
thou shall not speak evil of the Ruler of thy people: It binds the heart not
to imagine evil against him, Ec. 10. 20
Curse not the King, no not in thy thought, for the foul of the heaven shall
carry the voice, and that which has wings shall declare the matter: If the eye
of Inquisition could extend so far, the Common law would punish treason in
the very heart, the Civil law punishes with death, even the very thought of
bringing the Prince into any fear or danger, if it can any way be sifted out,
when Hest. 2. 21
the two Ennuches Bigthan, and Teresh were attainted, there was no more put in
the indictment then this, they meant to lay hands on King Ahassuerus, their
meaning being found by inquisition, they were both hanged on a tree. In the
French Academy I read of a Gentleman of Normandy, who confessed to a Franciscan
Friar, that he once was minded to have killed King Francis the first, but
afterward was angry with himself, that such a treacherous thought should enter
the door of his heart: the Gray Friar gave him absolution, but yet went and
discovered the matter to the King, who sent the Gentleman to the Parliament of
Paris, there to be tried, where he was by common consent condemned to die,
and afterward put to execution. A man would think here were binders enough to
tie Subjects to true obedience, when the law of God binds, the law of man
binds, when fear of punishment binds: but besides these their own oath
binds, which makes the cord more then threefold, that is not easily broken;
yet the Pope says, break these bonds a sunder, and cast away these cords from
you, compass or imagine the death of your King, leuy war against him, adhere
to his enemies, give them aid or comfort within or without the Realm, I will
discharge you of your oath and fealty, I will license you to withdraw your oath
of allegiance to take arms against him, yea to lay violent hands upon him,
occidite or excidite, kill him, or ill him, deponite a thron^, or exponite
periculo, depose him from his throne, or expose him to danger, thus an oath or
any other thing to the contrary notwithstanding, subjects shall have law to
lift up their heels against their head, under whose feet they should lay
down their lives. But I may say unto the Pope in this case, as Moses to the
Rebels, Nu^. 16. 7.
Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, Ye take to^ much upon you ye sons of Leuy: and
as they in the Gospel, but more justly, Ma^t. 2. 2^
By what authority do thou these things? and who gave thee this authority:
thou have no commission to dispense with an oath, no power to discharge a man
of it, thou blasphemest in saying, thou will free him that breaks it, Mar. ^.
^1
Who can forgive sins but God only? though thou perdon, God will punish,
though thou do promise fair, God will pay home, and condemn him as guilty,
that takes his name in vain.

The fourth Commandment.
Exodus 20. 8. 9. 10. 11. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day: Six
days thou shall labor, and do all that thou have to do: but the seventh
day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shall do no manner of
work, thou and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-seruant, and thy
maid-seruant, thy ^attell* and the stranger that is within thy gates. For in
six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and
rested the seventh day. Whererefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and
hallowed it.
IT is written of the Lacedaemonians, that by common exercise they could behave
themselves soldier like in the camp, but knew not how to use the time of
peace, so many have still to husband their business, and to trade in their crafts
and occupations on the working days, but are to seek how to use the Sabbath a
time of rest; and therefore God in this commandment would teach us a lesson,
with which common use is not acquainted, Remember the Sabbath day to keep it
holy.

The words contain, 1. A charge.

2. Several reasons to induce us to put the charge in execution.

In the charge we are to consider,

1. The matter given in charge.

2. The persons to whom the charge is given.

The matter given in charge is, to hallow the Sabbath, which consists, 1. In
resting from our own works.

2. In laboring in the service of God.

The persons to who^ the charge is given, are either Superiors,

and they more private, as Parents and Masters,
More public, as Magistrates,

Or Inferiors, whither they be home bred, as

children thy son or thy daughter.
servants thy man-seruant, thy maid-seruant.

or forenners the stranger that is within thy gates.

The reasons to induce us to execute this charge are

1. Gods bounteous liberality, in giving six days for dispatch of our own
business.

2. Justice which should be in man, in giving every one his due, it is Gods day.

3. Gods own pattern, he rests the seventh day.

4. The benefits that ensue upon observing it, that is the blessing of God, he
blessed etc.

In it thou shall do no manner of work: there be opera, fortunae, ^ulp^
naturae: works of our calling, works of sin, and works of nature, from the
first we must abstain the seventh day, from the second, every day, from the
third, not by co^pulsion on any day.

Deu. 5. 14
God would have all our Cattle rest, by name the Ox, and the Ass, I say in
this, as Saint Paul in an other case, does God take care for Oxen? had God
respect properly to the cattle, or does he not speak it rather for us, to
teach us to rest on the seventh day, on which the cattle cannot be employed in
any labor without the service of man?

2. Sam. 7. 2.
David's care was not to dwell in a house of Cedar trees, whiles the Ark of God
remained within the curtains? Luc. 7.
and Iairus is as much commended for building a Synagogue, as others in their
covetous humors are blamed for demolishing Churches, leaving nothing but rude
heaps of stone; but though this be a work of so great commendation, yet in
the law is a Caveat put in, that such a good work be not performed on the Ex.
31. 13
Sabbath day, or any thing then taken in hand, that belongs to the Tabernacle:
Mat. 26. 13.
The good work of Mary Magdalen^, in pouring a box of ointment on the head of
Christ, shall be spoken of for a memorial of her unto the worlds end; so on
the other side the withholding of her ointment on the Sabbath day is set down
to her commendation, that though she and the other Mar. 16. 1
Mary James his mother had prepared sweet ointments to anoint the dead body
of Christ, yet they came not to the Sepulcher till the Sabbath was past, but
rested that day according to the Luc 23. 56.
Commandment.

Here-upon Can^tus a King of this land, not full 32. years before the
conquest, ordained that fayres, Courts, and worldly works on that day should
be forborne, and in the 4. year of King Henry the 2. the common Council of
London, decreed, that nothing should be bought or sold within the liberties of
that City, and that no artificer or handy crafts-man should bring his wares or
works to any person to be worn or occupied on that day, for by this means
they thought the day to be profaned.

Two sorts of people are here to be blamed, the first are they which over keep
it as the Jews which are too nice and too strickt in observing this day, and
therefore if a man were sick or diseased they thought that upon this day
means might not be Ioh. 7. 23. ^
used for his recovery; for Christ charge them with this, that they were
angry with him for that he had made a man whole on the Sabbath day: yea the i
Pharisees, in reputation Act. 23. 8.
greater then the Sadducees, and sounder in belief, the Act. 26. 5
most exact sort, and coming nearest to the law; began to pick a quarrel
with Act. 22. ^1
Christ, for that his Disciples being hungry did Mat. 12.
pluck the ears of corn on the Sabbath day: they find no fault for plucking
the ears, for this the law permitted, n Den. 23. 25.
but to pluck them on the Sabbath day this they thought a point next the
worst, nay more then so, if a house were on fire, they thought on this day they
might not fetch water to quench the fire, if a vessel did run out, they
thought on this day they might not stop it, and as in Prester John's Country
they which receive the Sacrament may not so much as spitte, till the Sun set,
so the Jews thought that on this day no body might in public scratch where
it itched.

Lu. 14. 5.
If an Ox or an Ass did fall into any pit, it was lawful to pluck him out
on the Sabbath day, then what an ass was that Jew, that would not be plucked
out of a stinking pit which he fell into upon the Sabbath day.

But the Jews went not so far on the right hand in ouerkeeping it, but we
some of us in our practice go as far on the left hand in vnder-keeping it: we
do not so cast to dispatch that we have to do in the six days, but we
reserve until the seventh matters which we think to be of smaller importance,
the Farmer will not now yoke his Oxen or set his Plough forward, but he will
saddle his Horse, and speed himself to business abroad: the craftes-man will
not be seen to keep his shop-windowes open, but he can follow his occupation
closely within doors, as though God did not see him: but above all other the
superstitious Seafaring man deserves most blame, who occupying his business in
great waters, and saying the better day the better luck, will never set to sea
but on a Sunday, and so runs with full sail into the breach of this
Commandment.

Again as we must rest from works of our vocation; so from works which are
an auocation from God, and this is that which the Apostle says, he that is
entered into his rest Heb. 4. 10
has also ceased from his own works as God did from his, figures of this
resting from sin was the land of Canaan called a rest because Israel ceased
from the bondage of Egypt, from travail in the Wilderness from fear of enemies
that rose up against them: again the resting the seventh week, the seventh
month, the seventh year, the seven times seventh year, which was the year
of Iubilye, and this seventh day should be as salt to draw out our inward
corruption, to f^et and consume and eat out the concupiscence of the whole
man: the Jews might not carry a burden thorough the gates of the City on the
Sabbath day. Ier. 17. 27.
Sin is a burden, and lies upon the heart it must not on this day enter into
the soul thorough the gates of the senses: the flesh is troublesome, our
passions are unquiet, naturally all that is within us all that is without us
rebelleth against the spirit, on this day have a care that they may be cut off,
which trouble you: Qui quiescit, quiescat (for so it is in the old translation:
Englished in the Geneua, thus, Eze. 3. 27
he that leaves off, let him leave) so let him that rests from the labor of
the body, rest from the sin of the soul, but our Tauernes in towns
Alehouses in country, the Kings high ways abroad, our own streets at home,
do too truly witness that the devil has more service on the seventh day then
all the six days besides, whereas the Prophet Esaias would have us on this day
to have an eye to our thoughts, words and deeds when he faith, Esa. 58. ^3
not doing thine own ways, nor seeking thine own will, nor speaking a vain
word: and this is to celebrate a feast unto the Lord, when neither the soul is
vexed inwardly with the slavish works of sin, nor outwardly with the servile
works of the world: not that we should have a care to refrain sin this
day, and being careless let go the bridle to iniquity all the week after, for
what were it to rest from sin the seventh day, and afterward to run riot,
then to rest our selves and our horse a while, that afterward we might ride
out of the way with fuller course? but an especial regard is to be had to this
time, which if we riot out, we may assure our selves that God will sue us upon
an action of wast, then must one day teach another, this day, the week day,
that so we may serve God in righteousness, and holiness all the days of our life.

As upon this day we must rest from works of our calling, and from works of
sin, so we must set our selves to another task, keep it holy, dedicate it
wholly to the service of God; to rest from our labors only is to keep it
idly, and all this while the Ass at the cribbe keeps as good a Sabbath as
we, to rest from sin only is to keep it by halues, and therefore we must
go one step further, consecrate it as glorious unto the Lord, Esa. 58. 13
call the Sabbath a delight, and delight in the Lord: Not but that we should
study to acquit our duties to God on other days, and by observing his word get
him honor, but whereas Number. 28. 9.
under the law a single sacrifice was appointed for other days, two lambs
were commanded to be offered on the Sabbath, to show that on that day men
should double their devotion and under the Gospel, our Savior Christ wrought
more miracles on the Sabbath and feast days, then upon any other days
besides: what religious exercises are to be performed this day, we may learn
out of several places in Scipture, especially out of two Psalms: the 92.
Psalm, for of all the Psalms that is the only Psalm which bears the title:
a Psalm or song for the Sabbath day, as being used every Sabbath by the
Levites, when the congregation was assembled together; and the 95. Psalm which
in the liturgy of our Church, we read every Sabbath day before the several
Psalms, which in thirty days are appointed to be said or soung in the
congregation.

First therefore early in the morning we must prepare and make our selves fit
to receive the word: Gods word is a lantern unto our feet, and a light unto
our paths, but it cannot shine unto us, if sin as a curtain be drawn over
our hearts; it is seed, good seed, but cannot prosper if it be sown among
thorns: it is water to wash us, and therefore we must slip off our sins, as
we slip off our clothes when we go into the Bath and this is that which
Saint James says x lay apart all filthiness, and superfluity of maliciousnes
and recieue with meckenes the word that is graffed in you.

Secondly having prepared our selves we must repair to the Church, and come
before his presence: the prodigal child says Luc. 15. 17.
In my fathers house is bread enough: this is our fathers house, in which it
pleases him to dwell: here is the spiritual Manna to refresh the soul, here
is the poole Bethesda, in z Ioh. 5. 2.
which the Rivers of life do spring forth to heal the brokenhearted, and
quench the thirst of these which long after them.

Thirdly repairing to the Church, as Christ to Ioh. 4. 6.
Jacobs Well, We must bring our pitchers with us, our minds and meditations,
vessels with which we must receive the liquour of life; we must not be like
Serpents, which have their bodies in the water, and their heads out of the
water, nor we our bodies in the Church, and our heads out of the Church: sleep
not here with Act. 20. 9
Eutychus, as though this house were a nest for dormise, let not thy eyes go a
whoring in it, as though thou would make a stews of it: sit not for a
cipher, as though bare hearing were all, both duty and fruit of thy Religion,
but let thy ears be open to good advice, let not thy heart and resolution be
shut against it, if thy regard in hearing be not answerable to thy care in
speaking, thou may come to Church, and return without returning to God, and
art but as the Salamander, which lives in the fire, and is not made hot with
the fire.

Fourthly, having brought our vessels with us, every man must gather Nu^. 11. 6
his Gomer full, and take heed he be not cropsicke, as the Israelites, which
loathed Manna; but still hungering and thirsting after righteousness, tarry out
the whole service, this is that, which is commended in Luc. 2. 42
Joseph; and Mary, they came to the Temple with the first and went away with
the last, do not therefore touch and go, sippe and away, but tarry the peace
of God, take the Priests benediction, and valediction with you, it is like the
blessing of Nu^. 6. 24
Aaron, which God commanded, and all the people tarried for.

Having thus gathered with the Bees the sweet of heavenly flowers, we must by
meditation work our hony-combes within our hiues: Ez. 1.
the door of the inner court shut six days, must now be opened; the meat,
which by speaking was set before us in a dish, must now by meditation concocct
and digest in the stomach, and with the clean beasts chewing the h Act. 17. 11
Cudde we must still find a sweetness in that we have received; When once
we begin to be cloyed with our own company, I mean with our inward self
talk, then are we with the men of Berea to use conference, for they, when
they had heard the word with all readiness, took their Bibles that that they
might try the truth, of that which was spoken, and laying their heads
together, like bundles of sticks, might kindle one an other.

Having used these good means of hearing, meditation and conference, we are to
pray unto God, that his word may bring forth in us the fruit of good living,
that the worm of security, and contempt may not eat up the fruit; that God
would still water our souls with the dew of heaven in this life, that
hereafter we may be translated as glorious plants into his Paradise: I omit
here other religious exercises of this day, as the partaking of the Sacraments,
collection for the poor saints of God, visitation of the sick, the sacrifice
of thanksgiving, and also the meditation of the works of God, the
consideration whereof, the forenamed Psalms i Ps. 92. 4. and 95. 5.
would teach us to be one special use of the Sabbath day, and now I proceed in
order of my division to the persons to whom the charge is given.

Thou, that is, thou that art a father or mother, and have under thee son or
daughter: thou that art a master or mistrisse, and have under thee man-seruant,
or maid-seruant: thou that art a Magistrate, and have under thee proselites and
people of an other nation, thou and thou, and thou must have a care to hallow
the Sabbath: and here that in this rank, they which are Superiors have the
first charge; my note is this, that they must begin to their Inferiors, like
an Alarm, and be Ier. 50. 8
like the he Goats before the flock: they must not be like Mat. 2. 8.
Herod, who bade the wise men, Go search diligently for the child, and then
he would lagge after and worship; but like Ge^. 33. 3
Jacob who sets himself for most; like Josh. 24. 15.
Joshua I and mine house will serve the Lord; and Hest. 4. 16
Hester, I and my maids will do the same: Inferiors giving more credit to
their eyes, then to their ears, do rather imitate the works they see their
Superious do, then the words they hear them speak, their deeds are copies,
their copies rules, their rules the shortest cut of teaching, their good lesson
never does so much good, as their good life: they are the great wheels of a
clock, which turn the lesser weeles the same way; they are pillars, Nu^. 9. 17
when the pillar stood still, Israel stood still, when that went they went, and
in the book of Judges, q Iud. 16. 29.
when the pillars of the house went down, down went all; the other parts are
distempered, if the head be sick, if the eye be dark, all the body is full of
darkness, and then must the Sun needs be set in the valleys, when it does not
shine on the mountains: And therefore as Caesar never said to his soldiers,
ite, but venite, so should not the householder say to his family, nor the great
man, to those of smaller account, go to Church and hallow the Sabbath, but
himself be primum mobile, and say; O come let us go unto the house of the
Lord; O come let us sing unto the Lord, for then does the breach of this
Commandment lift up the head, when it sees the sin and slacknes of those
which are above them: and in this case well may the inferior say to those
which are above them, as the daughter of the crabbe-fish to her mother crabbe,
who swimming her self backward, (for such is the property of the Crabbe) bade
her young one swim straight forward, to whom she answered, prae I, sequar,
mother go you first, and I will follow after.

Again, as they which are above other, must be a good example to others, so
must they see, that they which are under them follow it, their good example is
a bladder, they must see, that they which are under them do swim by it, that
their good life be a glass for them, and a lead-starre to direct their course;
for if thou art a father, it is thy son or thy daughter, if a master, he is
thy servant, if a Magistrate, though the stranger within thy gates be not
thine, yet is he now within thy liberty, within thy jurisdiction; and therefore
Neh. 13. 16.
Nehemiah carried a hand over the Merchant strangers that profaned the Sabbath
day: concerning children and servants, as the Apostle speaking of the children
of God says, Ye are not s 1 Cor. 6. 19.
your own, you are bought with a price, so say I of children and servants they
are not their own, they are bought with a price, though not with so great a
price, as the price of blood, householders are not more their own, then their
families are theirs: now a man must have a care of that which is his own, that
which Saint Paul says particularly to Timothy, 1 Timothy 6. 20.
serua depositu^, will stretch further, a man must have a care to keep that
which is committed unto him, therefore Job 1. 5.
Job offered sacrifice, for his sons; first to show his watchfulness,
secondly to show he held himself blameworthy before God, if they had
offended: and the Pharisees most blasphemous are ready to cast this in Christ
his teeth, and censure him for it, that his Disciples in their imaginations
were not well ordered: u Thy Disciples do that which is not lawful to do on
the Sabbath day: Mat. 12. 2
thy Disciples fast not: Mat. 15. 2
thy Disciples wash not: the vice of the children y Mar. 2. 18
reflect upon the parents, the sin of the servants is the masters reproach,
concerning strangers, as the Israelites dwelling among the Egyptians learned
many ill things of them, so on the other side strangers of an other Nation
dwelling among us, must learn good things of us, and being pecus erraticum,
must hear the voice of good shepherds, and be enforced to follow good
Governors, when they shall see steps before them worthy of their traching.

Indeed strangers are further from us then our sons, then our servants, then
our own Countrymen, but yet are they nearer then beasts, and though they
cannot all say, have we not Abraham to our Father, yet let all go up the
stream until they come to the Fountains head, they may all say as in
Malachy, Mal. 2. 10
have we not all one father, has not one God made us? but the law provided,
that a man should have a care of beasts, Ex. 21. 33
of an Ox or an Ass that it fall not into a pit, shall we then suffer
strangers to run headlong to the pit of destruction? the Ex. 23. 4
law provided, that if a man met an Ox or an Ass going astray, he should
bring him back again, shall we not then reduce strangers, when we see them
wandering in the broad way, that leads unto death.

Besides where is our zeal, if dishonor done unto God, by any be he never
such a stranger does not eat us up, and grieve us as much as if a worm were
gnawing on our hear? men are charie of their own honesty, and cannot endure
that any, no not a stranger should wound it, and shall they be careless, if
strangers shall put Gods honor to shame and reproach? A good man is grieved,
when being in a strange Country he shall see God dishonored, as Paul in Act.
17. 1^.
Athens, and shall he suffer with quietness strangers to dishonor God in his
own country? If therefore thou being Alderman or any other Magistrate have a
stranger within thy ward or liberty, yea, though he does ouer-see thy business
as thine own eye, or procure things necessary as thine own hand, yet if he
does offend thee, or cause thy blood to rise by dishonouring God and profaning
his Sabbath, have a pluck at him, or with our Savior Christ bestirre thy
self with a whip, or at leastwise, seeing him dead in trespasses and sins,
without any hope of quickening, thou being zealous, be like the sea, which will
not suffer in it the carcasses of those which are dead, but casts them on shore.

Again as superiors being the foremen in this charge, are thereby taught to
begin to others in the observation of this day, so in that inferiors are also
put in the charge, though subordinate, they are to learn to conform
themselves, and be ready of themselves, to follow the pattern set before them,
to take true stitches out of those samplers, and to say in this, as Genesis 3^. 14.
Jacob in another case, pracedat dominus, ego paulatim sequar, and as Job. 23.
^^
Job, my foot has followed his steps: his way have I kept, and have not
declined: when thy betters bear the lantorne of Gods word, if thou will be out
of danger, follow them that carry the light, when thou see their good
carriage, do thou thereby better thine own: tu quoque fac simile, Luc. 10. 37.
go and do thou likewise. Nay more then so, because thou art within this
charge, though thy superiors fail in the premises, yet do thou hold them,
live not now by example but by law, and know that I and my father is no good
plea for the son, I and my master no good plea for the servant, I and the
governor, no good plea for the stranger, that which God says unto one, he
says unto all: every one shall bear his own burden, every fat shall stand on
his own bottom: the excuse will not go for current to say I did follow my
parents, I did humor my master or dame, the Magistrate did so as well as I:
the soul that sins shall dye, and there is no respect of persons.

Six days shall thou labor. The laboring hand is the staple of the land, and
raises up the pillars of it, without which the cords of the common wealth
would soon be loosed, for our good therefore, God has given us six days to
labor, that by taking pain in them we might live by the sweet of our own
sweat, were it not then great unkindness in us, if we would not allow him the
seventh day?

Six days. This Commandment does neither respect our laboring six days,
(for these first four precepts enjoin us such duties as we must perform unto
God) neither yet our ease and rest on the seventh day; for the substance of the
Commandment is the service of God, the rest is but an accident that cannot be
separated from it, not but that we must take pain, for standing water soon
stinketh, and what are idle persons but a colder earth molded with standing
water? When the householder says Mat. 20. 6
why stand ye here all the day idle? He heapeth up many reasons to induce us
to labor in the Vineyard: First, why? as if he should say, you have no reason
to it, it was at the first Gods ordinance, Genesis 2. 15
to have man take pain, Genesis 3. 19
afterward it was enjoined as a punishment for sin, Job. 5. 7.
now man is borne unto travail, as the sparks fly upward, and while he gives
himself to sloth and idleness the devil takes his free ease on him, as on a
cushion: God called David Psa. 78. 7^.
to feed Israel, when he was following the Ewes great with young, not when he
lay idle under an hill, besides what are the effects of idleness, but either
theft, for the slothful like drones live by the honey gathered by the Bees, and
like vultures prey on carcasses they killed not, one beats the bush and they
catch the bird, they suck the blood of other men, and become as fat as
body-lice by eating up others brewesse: they tossed themselves at their
neighbors fire, and keep no warmth in their own chimneis, other men's labors
are in their houses, they drink the waters of others cisternes, and of the
rivers out of the midst of others wells, or else adultery, for the mind is
apt to all uncleanness, 2. Sam. 11. 2.
when the man is idle; the mind being void of exercise the man is void of
honesty.

Queritur Aegystus, quare sit factus Adulter:
in pomptu causa est, desidiosus erat.
Besides it wears strength as rust does iron, and overmuch rest makes men
not more fit, but less willing to take pain, again the slothful hand makes
poor, hereby Ecc. 10. 18
the roof of the house goes to decay by the idleness of the hands the house
dropeth thorough: by doing nothing men come to nothing, and enter into the
plain high way to Needome, and when a man will be of no calling, he shall be
sure that poverty or beggary will find a calling to arrest him; and therefore
in the time of Cat^ Censorius, when any would be a Citizen of Rome, this
question was not demanded, whence or what he was, but only they took his
hands between theirs, and if they felt them soft and smooth, they presently as
an idle vagabonde gave him a mittimus, but if hard and knotty they forthwith
admitted him to dwell in their City: And if a malefactor were apprehended,
whose hands were laboring hands, his punishment should be mitigated though
his crime were grievous, but if idle hands, a severe punishment should be
inflicted for a small offense: therefore the Lacedaemonians would have labor
and sweat, hunger and thirst as the best spices to season their pottage,
therefore the ancients painted the image of virtue girded, therefore God gave
the Israelites but a short time to gather them Manna, for when the Ex. 16. 21
heat of the Sun came, it was melted: therefore might the householder well say,
why stand ye here all the day idle. The elements move, the heavens turn, the
worms creep, the fishes swime, the birds fly, why stand ye idle another
reason that the householder uses is, the strength and ability of those, to
whom he speaks, why stand ye, as if he should say were it so that you were
criples or impotent, and not otherwise provided for, you might lie with Lazarus
at the rich man's gate, I would not hasten you forward to work, but you have
the powers of your bodies, are lusty and strong why stand ye idle: Pro. 30. 25.
the Antes are feeble, the pismires a people not strong, yet are they diligent
at their work, and will you that are strong be negligent? Draco (but his laws
for their cruelty are said to be written with blood) deprived them of life,
which would not labor for their living: the drones of Hetruria like
unprofitable bees, entering into the hyue and consuming the honey, were expelled
from others and reputed as vagabonds, were condemned to exile, and dealt
withal much like as Philip King of Macedonia dealt with two of his bad
subjects, he made one of them run out of the country, and the other drive
him. In other places they have had Stafford law, and at Bridewell in our land
whipping cheer, and in the 23. year of Edward the 3, there was a statute made
that no man under pain of imprisonment should give any alms to any sturdy
beggars, that necessity might compel them to get their bread with the sweet of
their brows.

The householders third reason to induce us to labor is taken from the place,
here, why stand ye here idle, heaven is a place of rest, let the world toss
how it list, our rest is pitched alost, and we shall be as the Genesis 8. 4
Arc, which when the flood ceased did rest on the mountain: Hell is a place
of torment, there be heavy fines but no recoueries, they deal in this Court
upon the capias, Mal. 22. 13.
take him away, and cast him into utter darkness, upon babeas corpus bind him
hand and foot, upon the ^ Ge^. 3. 24
Ne exeat regnum, the gates are kept from egresse, as the gates of Paradise
were warded from entrance, though we have a writ de homine replegiando,
directed to the sheriff to cause a man to be repleued, when he is in prison,
yet here is no repleuie, no flying to a Court of conscience for relief, no
judgment reuersed by writ of error: This world is a place of labor, where we
must wear our bodies, and still be doing some thing, that God may not find us
idle when he comes, and the devil may find us busy, when he tempts, and
therefore stand not idle here.

The fourth reason is drawn from the time: Work while u Ioh. 9. 4.
it is day, the night comes when no man can work: therefore stand not idle
in the day time, if thou have let slip part of the day, if thou have not sown
thy seed in the morning, yet in the evening let not thy hand rest, stand not
all day idle, nulla dies sine li^ea, if thou suffer one day to pass without
drawing some line, thou may say, diem amisimus amici, and have lost that
which cannot be recovered, and called back again: on the one side be not an
idle person, who being an unprofitable piece of earth, will not do all that he
has to do, on the other side be not too curious in thy work, but see when a
thing is well done, and do not more then all, hate both these extremes doing
nothing, and doing more then need to no purpose, keep the mean, labor six
days, and do all, leave nothing till the seventh day then to be dispatched,
do not more then all, yet do all, for sufficient unto the seventh day is the
travail thereof.

The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: we must give to every one
that which belongs unto him: the seventh day belongs to God, therefore we
must give it unto him: the minor proposition is in the text, the mayor in
Matthew, Mat. 22 21.
and it is an axiom that goes current without contradiction: Iustitia suum
cuique tribuit, whosoever therefore conuerteth to any profane use that which is
consecrated to God, robs God of his due, and takes his right from him: for
example, you shall see this in these three things, the Temple, Tithes, the time
of the Sabbath; in the Temple thus, it is Gods house, there faithful men
inhabit, Angels frequent, God himself is present, it is (...), the Kings court
and greatest Princess Palace: and because those merchants in the Gospel did
buy and sell in it, they are called thieves, not such thieves as are
commissioners on Salisbury plain, which by mistaking a word, take up such
purses as fall in the lapse, for want of sufficient defense, but Den thieves,
Mat. 21. 13.
my house shall be called the house of prayer, but ye have made it a Den of
thieves, you have crept into my right, made a false entry upon my freehold as
great a blot does cleave unto your hands, as if the wilderness had given you and
your children food.

Again Tithes and offerings, are appointed and dedicated to the service of
God, and therefore they which with Dan. 5. 3.
Balthazar carrowse in the bowls of the Temple, and the Merchants, which
breaking into the Church take away that, which is the Ministers maintenance,
and let them sterue at the altar, that serve at the altar, are as bad as the
thieves which Christ whipped out of the Temple, and would crucify Christ again
for his coat, God makes them no better then thieves, when he says, Mal. 8. 3.
you have robbed me, or you have spoiled me in Tithes and Offerings: so
likewise the eternal God, who made time, who Genesis 1. 3.
brought light out of darkness, who put difference betwixt day and night,
betwixt day and day, consecrated the Sabbath to his service, and therefore it
is sacrilege to take it up for our own use, for what is sacril^gium, but
sacril^dium, a profaning of that which is holy? Mat. 22. 21.
give therefore as unto Caesar, the things which are C^sars, so unto God the
things which are Gods: give him the calves of thy lips, the root of thy heart,
the first fruit of thy age, the tenth of thy substance, the seventh of thy time.

But for so much as six days are common to all men, and God has his seventh
several to himself, as his own enclosure; it would be known (that God might
have his due time) which of the seven is the day that he claims as his own
special right and interest.

The Jews according to Gods institution set apart the Satterday for the
service of God, and that which we call Sunday was their Luc. 24. 1
first day of the week, this they did in remembrance of the creation,
celebrating that day to give credit to the greatest work that ever was before,
but as the benefit of Isreal's deliverance from the captivity of Babylon was so
great, that it abolished the remembrance of her deliverance from Egypt: Ier.
16. 14
It shall no more be said, The Lord lives, which brought up the children of
Israel out of the Land of Egypt, but the Lord lives, that brought up the
children of Israel from the Land of the North: So the benefit of our
deliverance from the captivity of Satan, and the rising of Christ from
finishing the work of our redemption was so great, that in respect of this,
other benefits are forgotten, this shines as the Sun among the lesser
stars; and therefore God did change the day, and put it off from that day he
did lay in the grave, till the day when by rising again, he did overcome death
and opened unto us the gate of everlasting life. And to show the alteration,
the Apostles gave this day the name of Re. 1. 10.
the Lords day, Act. 20. 7.
they themselves kept it, and 1 Cor. 16. 1.
ordained that the Churches in their time should observe it: this is indeed a
day of good tidings: We do not well if we hold our peace, this is indeed the
day which the Lord has made, we must rejoice and be glad in it, this is indeed
a day like that night in Exodus i Ex. 12. 42
to be kept holy unto the Lord, that day of the Lord, which all of us must
keep throughout our generations.

Great was the work of creation, and therefore we must now mount upward with
the wings of nature, greater was the work of redemption, and therefore we must
now soar aloft with the wings of grace; It cost more to redeem us then make
us, for in our creation, Ps. 148. 5.
dixit, and factum est, he spoke the word, and it was done, but in our
redemption he spoke, and did, and suffered many things, he created the world
in six days, but in restoring man he labored more then thirty years: In
creating us he gave us our selves, in redeeming us he gave himself for us, so
that how much he is greater then we, so much is this day greater then that, and
more worthily to be observed in regard of redemption, then that in remembrance
of creation, not now to be altered any more, because there can be no greater
work then this of redemption, nor can so well deserve an ^cce in the
beginning, or Selah in the end to be stamped upon it.

For in six days, etc. and rested the seventh: Longum it^r per praecepta breue
per exempla, to teach by praecept is tedious, but by example but a short cut:
All the people cut down every l Iud. 9. 49.
man his bough, when they saw Abimelech cut down boughs of trees and bare them
on his shoulder, to set the hold of the Shechemites on fire: Reason should
rule, and to show that it should bear sway it lodges in the midst of the
brain, the highest part of the frame of man, but when reason cannot persuade,
example will mo^e; all the reason that Origin did beat into Alexander Seuerus
could not so soon persuade him; that Christ was the Son of God, as the
example of Origin: And the Christians keep holy the Sabbath day, here is the
precept which should bind us, especially seeing there is a memorandum set upon
it, but if this cannot enforce obedience, yet yield to reason, God gave you six
days for your own service, judge then whither you are not to blame, if you
grudge him the seventh: if this hedge will not hold you in, ^ee further whether
this be stronger, it is his own day, give him his due, if you yet break
thorough take God himself for an example, and let this yoke you, that he
finishing his work in six days (his work of creation not of preservation)
rested the seventh: In that God prescribing a law is himself an unprinted
statute, and makes his own doing a commentary upon that he prescribes, my
note is this, that they which teach other, must as well instruct them vita as
verbo, be as well lamps shining, as voices crying, knowing that the Act. 2. 3.
holy Ghost descended not in the likeness of tongues alone, or fire alone, but
in the likeness of fiery tongues, and then do they make themselves Nu^. ^0. 1.
two trumpets, when they lift up their voice as a trumpet, their life as a
trumpet.

The use is this, to trace God by this fragrant odor, and sweet sent: let the
resting on the seventh day descend from God unto man, as the ointment runs
down from the head by the beard to the border of the garment: he rested,
Level at this mark, let him be the white whereat you aim, the straight line
to correct that which is crooked, a spectacle from whence you may draw your
impression, a Stern to guide you, and like Bees see you follow your King: if
you could take exception against him this reason were weak to persuade, but he
is absolutely perfect Mat. 5. 48
be ye perfect, as your father which is in heaven is perfect: say you are
singular, and the world on this day do the devil most service, yet imitate
this president Luc. 6. 40
whosoever will be a perfect Disciple shall be as his Master: he rested, here
is a thread which reaches from God unto man, from the beginning to the end of
the way, follow it, you cannot err, ne in domo Dedali no not in the laberinth
of the world, he rested, follow him, though not passibus aequis, though not in
aequalitie yet in quality, as fast as you can, and as far as you may, let
him be Doctor, and Ductor, let the example of him that sits above the clouds,
direct you, Ex. 13. 21
as the cloud did the children of Israel in their passage toward the land of
Canaan, still remembering this that he makes but a bad piece of work that
regardes not his pattern.

The Lord blessed the seventh day, either he thought honorably of it, for we
are well conceited of that we bless, and therefore Laban calls Abraham's
servant, he Genesis 24. 31.
Blessed of the Lord, or else he bestows a blessing on them which observe
it: and here we are to consider that as God giving a charge to observe all his
Commandments in general, bids us here in the very entrance especially
remember this, much like as if a father should charge his son to perform
many several duties, but commends one unto him above the rest, which he
tells him he must not forget, so promising his blessing to those which
observe his statutes and keep his laws in general, does here in the end
especially mention a blessing on this, as though God had a greater care to
bind us to the observing of this Commandment, then any one of the rest. 1.
Sam. 2. 22.
God had an especial care of his Temple that it should not be profaned, and
therefore it aggrauated the faults of Esa. 53. 7.
Elies sons that they abused themselves at the door of the Tabernacle, and
therefore our Savior Christ, though for meekenes compared to a sheep, though
he gave precepts of sufferance, Mat. 5. 39
yet when his fathers house was made an house of Merchandise, Ioh. 2. 15.
he bestirred himself with his whip, but God had not a greater care of his
Sanctuary, then of his Sabbath, of the place of his service, then of the time
when he would be served; and therefore in the law they are joined together Leu.
19. 30.
ye shall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary, now if the Israelites
say to Joshua, Ios. 1. 16.
all that thou have commanded us, we will do, if the Rulers and Elders say to
Iehu, 2. Kin. 10. 5.
we are thy servants, and will do all that thou shall bid us, much more then
must we that are the servants of God, be at his beck to do his will, and
incline our hearts to keep all his laws, but especially that law, which he
shall give in especial charge.

Blessed the seventh day: Ioh. 2. 10
The governor of the feast tells the the Bridegroom that he kept the best
wine till the last, so here the governor of all the world, and the Bridegroom
of his spouse the Church, reserueth the best and strongest motive till the
last, that if the rest should fail, this might fasten obedience upon us: Gen
27. 8
What means did Rebeccah use, nay what means did she not^se to get a blessing
for her son Jacob? how did Esau weep and howl for the blessing of old
Isaac. Genesis 27. 34.
Bless me even me also my father: have thou not reserved a blessing for me,
have thou but one blessing my father, bless me even me also my father: He
will not let his father rest before he blesses him, no more then Genesis 32. 26.
Jacob will let the Angel go before he blesses him, he will not leave him,
till he fastens upon him with his prayers, as the 2 Kin 4. 27.
Shunamite upon Elysha with her hands: here is a blessing not of an earthly but
of an heavenly Father, not for our children only, but for our selves also, if
we hallow the Sabbath, as God hallowed it, that is appointed it to be kept
holy, we shall drink of the cup of Gods blessings, and our posterity shall
pledge us. Ex. 16. 27
Some of the people of Israel went out on the seventh day contr^ y to the
Commandment of God to gather Manna but found nothing, so let men disobey this
law, profane this day, and trade in their callings, when they have cast up
their accounts, they shall find they get nothing: Luc. 5. 5.
Peter fisheth all night and catches nothing, for Christ is not with him, so
they may labor and take pay ne all this day, but gain nothing, for God is not
with them. The superstitious seafaring man runs not the point aright, for
never setting to sea, but on a Sunday, God will not give wind to his sails,
and though the wind be a benefit to sailing, yet God conuerteth it to a plague
as he did in the prophecy Ion. 1. 4.
of Jonas for another fault: say he is brought to the haven where he would be
and his ship well fraught, yet his gains shall melt as butter against the Sun,
and in the end he shall find he put his wages into a broken bag. In a word,
let every one that disobeyes this law look for nothing, but the curse of God,
or if he has a blessing, let him look that God will curse that blessing, if
he has a wife, he shall be afflicted by the wife of his bosom, who should be
his helper, if he has fruit of his body, he shall be afflicted by his son,
who should be the staff of his age, if he has fruit of his ground, God will
break the staff of his bread, his Manna shall stink, and he shall find
Colloquintida a bitter herb in the pottage: but if we have a care of the
Sabbath to sanctify it, the blessings of God shall ouer-take us, and one shall
bind him to give another, God will not pull in his hand from rewarding or hold
it out empty, and as he is skillful in dirigendo, because he is a perfect
Master, pitiful in corrigendo, because he is a loving Father so will he be
bountiful in Porrigendo, because he gives what he will without abatement of
his store, he will display the banners of his favor, and unlock the closet of
his benefits, we shall have privative blessings which consiste in delivering
us from evil, we shall have positive blessings which consiste in doing us
good, some in possession, some in expectation, some in act, some in hope,
corporal, spiritual, temporal, eternal, his grace shall prevent us, and his
mercy shall follow us all the days of our lives. Let therefore the end of the
sixth day be a bound to ou^ business, like the bound on the Ex. 19. 12
Mount, which the people must not pass, like the river, which Shemei 1. Kin.
2. 37
must not go beyond, an Herculis columna, wherein is g^^uen non vltra, no
further then thus: let nothing draw our business without the gates, within which
God has confined it, let not now worldly affairs look in at our windows, if
our covetous affections would be to bold, let religion overrule them, curb
them, put them to a non plus, and with check and frown keep them under, go
no further, then we are led by this law, as the wise men went no further then
they were guided by the star; let our Omer be filled the sixth day, then set
we down our rest, and gather now no more Manna for refreshing the body, till
the seventh day be past, never set upon that day which God has set apart for
himself, let our trading stand still, when it is come to the Lords day, as
Mat. 2. 5.
the Star when it came unto Christ, so God shall bless us, and save us, and
show the light of his countenance upon us, which shall shine more and more
until it be perfect day, until we celebrate an everlasting Sabbath, and find
continual rest in Christ Jesus, to whom with the Father and the holy Ghost,
three persons and one God, be all glory, power, Praise and Dominion now and for
ever. Amen.

The fifth Commandment.
Exodus, 20. 12. Honor thy father and mother, that thy days may be long in the
land, which the Lord thy God gives thee.
ON two Commandments, hang the whole law and the a Mat. 22. 40. ver. 37.
Prophets. The first, thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thine heart,
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, on this hangs the first table of
the law, as upon a great nail of the Sanctuary.

The second is like unto this, thou shall love thy neighbor ver. 39.
as thy self, on this hanges the second table, as on another nail fastened in
the holy place: When the love of God does carry us along toward the haven of
happiness, we take a good course, as when one river runeth toward the Ocean, it
goes as it should, but when this does meet with the love of our neighbor, as
one river meets with another then there is a current indeed, and we set
forward with a maine stream to a sea of blessedness: and therefore as Act. 2. 2.
the holy Ghost was given from heaven, that we should love God, so was it given
on earth, that we should love men, and therefore the Scripture makes ^ 1 Timothy
2. 2
godlynes and honesty to meet together, Luc. 1. 75
holiness and righteousness to kiss each other, or rather weaues them
together, as o* 19. 23:
the coat of Christ without seame, that they might not be put a sunder, both
of them make up one perfect pair of compasses, which can take the true
latitude of a Christian heart, the first like the top of Jacobs ladder reaches
to heaven, the f Ge^. 28. 12
second like the foot of the ladder rests on the earth, or rather walks about
in a perfect circle of all such duties, as one of us owe unto another: by the
first we walk in reverent regard of all that duty we owe to Gods Majesty: by
the second in simplicity we serve our brethren, and yield to every callings
several person, that duty which belongs unto him.

The first of these I have already with the help of God passed over, to the
second I am to set forward at this time, God again give wind to may sails,
that I may run the point aright, and let my words be not only like Peter's
Angle, Mat. 27.
which cast into the sea took a fish, but like Peter's net, Luc. 5. 6.
which let down to make a draught, enclosed a great multitude of fishes.

Honor thy father: The words rest your ears on these two heads.

1. A charge, Honor thy father te^porall, as the father of the house, as thy
father by Nature, Office,
country thy betters in place, thy Elders in years,

Spiritual, thy Pastor and Minister, which begets thee to God by the immortal
seed of his word.
2. A motive to induce us to harken to the charge. i. a promise of long life,
that thy days may be long, pleasant and fruitful habitation, in the land
which the Lord thy God gives thee.
Honor thy father* A duty so necessary, that Philo the Jew placed this fifth
Commandment; in the first Table, as though we had not performed our whole
duty to the God of heaven, except we gave the honor here required, to
Parents, to Magistrates, to all such as represent the person of God upon earth.
Frst therefore honor thy father, thy natural father, because thou art 2 man:
Heb. 12. ^
God indeed is the father of Spirits: and therefore called Number. 16 22.
the God of the spirit, of all flesh, and though he made all his works in six
days and then rested; yet this resting was from works of a new kind, ^ot of
the same kind, for he that Ge^* ^. 7.
breathed in the first man's ^ace breath of life, so that he was a living
soul, does still after a wonderful manner create the soul in the infusion of
it, and infuseth it in creating it; but go to the flesh, he uses our parents
as instruments of the work, and they are means in framing that part, and
therefore should children yield honor unto them.

The Scripture uses diverse Arguments, to draw us on to the performance of this
duty, as the care which parents have of their children good education, of which
the Apostle speaks, when he says; Ephesians. 6. ^
Bring them up in instruction and information of the Lord, bring them up, this
respects meat, drink, and apparel, parents are not like the Raven which
forsakes her young, till they are of color like unto her self, nor yet like
the Kite, which grieueth to see her young in good plight: Indeed we read of
parents, which have cast out their children, whom the wolves have nourished,
which though it be not true, yet has a semblance of truth, for wolves may
become fathers, fathers have become wolves; but these are such as Saint Paul
brandeth with this mark, Ro^. 1. 30. 1.
without natural affection, but by nature parents, servant depositum, keep
that which God has given them, and have a care to preserve the tender bud of
their decaying stock,

Again they bring them up in instruction, this respects ciuility and good
manners, nurture helps nature forward, and though among Jacobs sons four
were borne of his maids, ^et Jacob did so instruct his younger sons borne of
the lawful mothers, that they gave place to their el^er brethren, g Genesis 43.
33.
the eldest sat according to his age, and the youngest according to his youth.

Thirdly, they bring them up in the information of the Lord, this respects
the fear of God, they seek as much to fashion their minds to goodness, as
they are careful for the comely behavior of their bodies: Better not borne,
then not brought up, better not brought up, then not taught, better not taught,
then not taught the fear of the Lord: and therefore the Apostle ioynes them
together, bring them up in instruction and information of the Lord: but say
parents are backward in performing these duties, yet children should be forward
in giving this honor, and though there were no other reason, yet this must be
sufficient to drive them to it, they are their parents, by them they are
brought into the world, by their means they have their being, without them
they had not been: and if Mar. 12. 2
the Lord of the vineyard sent to the husbandmen for the fruit thereof, because
he planted it, 1 Cor. 9. 7
for who planteth a vineyard, and eats not of the fruit: then even in this
respect (for the Philosopher said, se plantare hominem) should children pay to
their parents, that fruit which this Commandment, as a Collect or goes to
gather from them: and this is that which Solomon says, Pro. 23. 22. 25.
obey thy father, that has begotten thee, and despise not thy mother, when
she is old, thy mother that bear thee.

This honor consists, 1. in reuerencing their persons, 2. obeying their
precepts, 3. in relieuing their wants. For the first, when Heb. 12. 9
the Apostle speaks of the fathers of our bodies, he speaks also of giving
reverence: Among the Lacedaemonians, the arrogance, and saucines of a child, was
the cause that one of the Ephories, (men of great place and authority among
them) published the law of testaments, by which it was lawful for every man to
appoint whom he would to be his heir. And among the Romans, when the father
was dead, the child was not admitted to plead his fathers will by way of
action, but only by way of request, speaking very humbly, and reverently of
his disceased father, leaving the whole matter to the Judges discretion, this
served to bind children to have their parents in greater reverence and
estimation. This reverence must show it self in word and in gesture, in word
by speaking submissiuely, and reverently unto our parents, as the prodigal
child does unto his father, who having drawn much of his patrimony through his
throat, and spent the rest among harlots, so that now he became fellow
commoner with swine; uses all reverence in his words; 1. When he attacheth
himself, and brings himself into his fathers presence, Luc. 15. 18.
I will rise and go to my father. 2. When he indites himself, Father, I have
sinned against heaven, and against thee. 3. When he judges himself, I am no
more worthy to be called thy son: such a reverent submission, is an Adamant
to draw the heart of an hard-hearted father, and Genesis 32. 24.
wrasleth with him according to the policy of Jacob, it wins by yielding,
and the lower it stoopeth toward the ground, the more advantage does it get to
obtain a blessing. Solomon, though he were a King, yet speaks to his mother
with great reverence, for when she is to make a petition to him, he says unto
her, Ask on my mother, for I will not say thee nay, he that builded the
Temple, was himself a true temple of God built g 1 K. 2. 20
with a low roof, and therefore he disdained not his mother, but gives her so
good words, that she that bear him might rejoice.

This reverence is showed in gesture, by uncovering the head, bending the knee,
and giving place; it is written of Thanu a Stoicke Philosopher, that though for
his deserts, he was made Consul and chief Ruler of the City, yet meeting his
father at a banquet, gave him the highest room saying, naturaeleges in
conuiuio debere obseruari, sicut in praetorio ciuiles, in place of judgment
let the order of the Civil law be observed, but at a place of merriment, let
the law of nature go before it.

How reverently did the foresaid Solomon, carry himself in his gesture toward
his mother, when she came to desire a Request of him, 1 K. 2. 19.
the King rose to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his
throne, and he caused a seat to be set for the Kings mother, and she sat at
his right hand: this he did in token of reverence, and to give good example to
other; neither let the child count this any disgrace, for now it is true that
Aristotle says, honor est in honorante non in honorato, and the more we abase
our selves before our parents, the more we increase in honor both before God
and men; and the Ps. 128. 3
children which like olyue branches stand round about the table shine, like the
seven stars, which go about the pole brighter then the rest.

c Cursed then be Canaan, cursed be Ham, and the wicked nation of the
Canaanites that proceed of him, for when his father overcome with wine was
uncovered, (for drunken po^ters keep open gates) in the midst of his tent, he
had no reverence as Shem and Iapheth, but in token of derision and contempt
told it his brethren, let Adoniahes bad carriage against his father King
David, be still remembered to his everlasting shame, for when his ^ather is
grown old, he gets a guard to set forth his estate, and exalting himself
says, Kin. 1. 5
I will be King. So did the son of King Henry the second. for when his father
joined him with him as King, and at his coronation renouncing the name of a
King for that day, did as Sewer serve at the table, my father, says he, is not
dishonored in attending on me, for I am both a King and a Queens son, and
so is not he: Euilmerodach, (as the Hebrews report) went further then thus,
for he using his father Nabu^adnezzar, very irreuerently after he was dead,
drew his body out of the grave, burnt it to ashes, parted the ashes, put them
in four several purses, bound them to four Aegles necks, and caused them to
fly to the four quarters of the world. The Scites a barbarous people, yet
held the very Sepulchers of their fathers in great reverence, in so much that
when Darius seeing them fly before him, would know how far they would fly,
they answered, to our fathers Sepulchers, unto which when thou shall approach,
O King Darius, thou shall see we set not so much by the life of the living, as
bones of the dead. What an evil son then was this Euilmerodach, who himself
would work that cruelty the like whereof the Barbarians to dye for it would
not suffer their enemies so much as to attempt? But I proceed.

The second point of honor required in children is to obey their parents
precepts, and to suffer themselves to be led and guided by them, in matters of
marriage men are commonly carried by affections, their choice is not so much
led by virtue and religion, as by gain or pleasure, their flesh sleeps not,
while their wines are chufing, as Adam slept while his wife was ^ Genesis 2. 21
making; this makes them like those, whom they soon mislike again, and to
take wives, as men do flowers, which they cast away, when they are once
withered: but Isaac in matching himself is well content to be at his fathers
disposition, for otherwise Genesis 24. 3.
Abraham had reckoned without his host, when he sent his servant to take a wife
unto his son Isaac, and the servant would have cast a doubt of Isaac as well
as of Rebecca, but he said only what if the woman will not come with me? he
makes no question of Isaac, for he saw before, Geu. 22. 6.
how obediently he went with his father to the Altar, though he saw no burnt
offering, he perceived that he showed no semblance of dislike, though he saw no
reason of the thing commanded.

Mordecai was not father, but in stead of a father to Easter, yet being made
Queen, Est. 2. 20.
she was obedient to him that had brought her up.

This serves to reprove. First those children, which shaking off their fathers
yoke, slatly deny their obedience. Secondly those which promise fair, but are
slack in performing, patterns of both these, we have in the Gospel by Saint
Matthew; for of the two sons, which the father bids go work in his Vineyard,
Mat. 21* 28.
the elder said, I will not, ye afterward he repeuted himself and went, the
younger said, I will sir, yet he went not: in the one is a deed without show,
in the other a show without deed, worse are they, in whom is neither deed nor
show of obedience; such were those graceles waggestringes in Terence, Clitipho
and Clinia, of which the first, when his father Chremes gives him good
counsel, to wit, that he should not give himself to Wine and women, that he
should resist the beginning of evil, for that by continuance it gathers more
strength and more, and will hatch if her eggs in time be not broken, O says
he, Quam iniqui sunt patres in omnes adolescentes iudices, qui aequum esse
censent nos iam a pueris ilico nas^i sen^s etc. is not this a pretty matter,
that our fathers would have us in our dotage, before we are past our nonage,
shall not we take our swinge, as well as they did, when they were of our years
the crafty old fox, tells me now that I should make use of other men's harms,
ne ille haud s^it quam mihi nun^ surdo narrat fabulam, I wis little wots he
what a deaf ear I lend to all his talk, let him say what he will, I will do
as I list: here is true pattern of a child past grace, to whom truth is
untoothsome, because it treads down his own likeing, to him I send other
children to school, but as that cunning Musition, who set his scholars to an
ignorant and homely minstrell, but before he sent them out, he bad them take
this lesson with them, see you shun your masters doings, the matter of his
songs, the manner of his playing, his lessons, his fingring is naught, so when
you see graceles Clitipho pensiled out unto you, see you follow not his floting
iumpe not in his steps, he treades too much outward, and will not be
vnderlayde, yet make this use of such carrions, gather honey out of their
weeds, by their enormities learn to correct your own, otherwise go ye not
after them, fashion not your selves like unto them, be not as 1. Sam 2. 25.
Hophni and Phinehas the sons of Eli, for they obeyed not the voice of their
father, therefore 1. 5. 4. 11.
the Lord slew them: harken rather what Saint Paul says, Ephesians. 6. 1.
Children obey your parents, but he adds; in the Lord, obey your parents in
the Lord, for parents loose their right to be obeyed when they command against
God. Luc. 2. 51 ver. 29.
Our Savior Christ went down with his parents to Nazareth, and was subject to
them, but yet prefers his duty to God before any duty to them, and
therefore he says, Heb. 12. 9
knew ye not that I must go about my fathers business? We have fathers of our
bodies, and of them we have esse naturae, our being in Nature, we have a father
of our spirit, and of him we have esse gratiae, of the one our being, of the
other our well being; both these we call father, we obey both, so long as they
both inioyne the same duties, but when they command contraries, and he whose
son thou art by nature, will have superiority over thy faith, and lie in thy
way as thou art going to God, in this case Mat. 23. 9
call no man your father upon the earth, for their is but one, your father,
which is in heaven: now go from thy father as Genesis 12. 1
Abraham from his fathers house, now Luc. 14. 26
hate thy father, as charity it self does exhort, now let thy holy carelesnes
make thy father thy footestep.

The third thing wherein this honor of children consists, is in supplying
their parents wants, if they be in case able to relieve them, to raise their
fathers out of the dust, when they are impouerished and fallen in decay, and
cannot see the rivers, nor the floudes and streams of honey and butter; this
does very nature teach, for we see that all boughs do incline and bend
themselves toward the root, from which they took their original, and more
then so in summer time receiving from the root leaves and flowers and fruit,
do in winter time let them fall again to the fatting and nourishing of the
root: The Storkes, (and Pliny writes the same of the birds Meropes,) do feed
their* dammes when they are old, because their dammes did feed them when they
were young; if Nature works thus in creatures which have life without sense,
and sense without reason, shall not Nature and grace do the like in children,
which besides life and sense, have a reasonable soul? The good nature of
Joseph, shall be remembered to his great commendation, Gen ^6. 29. 31.
who after that for honors sake he had gone to meet his father coming into
Egyt, had his next care that he might dwell in the land of Goshen, the fatt of
the Country: and the natural affection of that daughter shall not be
forgotten, who seeing her father had his judgment to be famished, and that
none might be suffered to bring him meat, did give him suck with her own
breasts: On the other side to blame were the Jews, who disanulled this law,
for it is written in their Talmud, a man is bound to honor his father and
mother, unless he did vow the contrary, and accordingly Hubaldus, as Gratian
notes in the decretals, would not help his mother in her need, for he had
vowed he would not: too blame were the scribes and Pharisees, whom our Savior
Christ reproves for this, that they dispensed with children which neglected
their parents though they stood in need of their supportation, so as they would
give (as they use to say) to the Church, Mar. 7. 11
as though the commandment did not rather drive them to their parents care,
then to the Priests Corban. In a word to blame are all such children as being
fat upon earth, and seeing their Tabernacles to flourish, are ashamed of their
parents when they are filled with poverty, when Opus, and Vsus, knocks at
their doors, when they are brought to a morsel of bread, and drinking of the
beggars dish taste the smart of needy want: which without all pity and
compassion will suffer them still to go to the fountain for their best
cellar, to the ground for their bed, to the gate for their bread, to the
brokers shop* or I know not whose wardrob for clothes, to cover the nakedness
of their bodies, these I say, because they will not raise their parents out of
the dust, and lift them up from the dunghill, run into the breach of this
commandment, honor thy father, and thy mother: The mother is the weaker sex,
and commonly most doteth upon her children, which makes her look for less
honor, and them less to esteem her, therefore there is express mention made
of the mother, honor thy mother, and Deu. 21. 18.
Moses speaks of harkening both to the voice of the father, and voice of the
mother, to show it is as well the mothers duty to instruct her children, as it
is the childrens part to submit themselves, as well to the one as to the other;
nay more then so in Leuiti^us, the mother has the Bedels seniority, and though
she be the junior yet has the first place, Leu. 19. 3
ye shall fear every man his mother and his father, that none might take
exceptions against his mother, or think himself exempted from her
jurisdiction.

This serves to reprove such sons as, being without natural affection, are
ready to hold their mothers short, when the Churchyard has the length of
their fathers bodies, such as empayring their mothers true titles, are ready to
turn them out of doors; such beasts are like young Kites, who when their
dammes have hatched them, taken pain and gone about the camp with much danger
to bring them meat to feed them, do not withstanding, when they are grown
strong, beat them with their wings, will not suffer them to eat of their
prey, but with their bill and with their wings expel them from their nest.

I need not speak here against Parricides, there are few Christians grown so
barbarous, except some moth, which destroys the cloth wherein it bred, or some
few vermin, which eat into the flesh whereof they came, or some Salamander,
which being a long while nourished in the sire, at last quenches it, or some
worm, which being bred at the foot of the tree, and growing with it, at last
killes it, or some frozen snake in Aesop, which intoxicateth and infecteth him
with poison, who warmed her in his bosom: such a monster in nature was Nero,
who caused his own mother Agrippina, to be slain and ripped open, that he might
see the place where he lay in her; little better were the Bactrians, among whom
was such in humanity, that when there parents, were sick or old, they threw
them to dogs to tear them in pieces: Caspij a people in Tart^^i^ nourished
dogs of purpose to do the like piece of service, here in England in the
days of persecution, I know not whether I should more cry out of the cruelty
of the persecutors, in commanding children to set fire to their parents, (which
in the reign of Henry the 7. 1506. one Ioane Clarke the only daughter of
William Tilsworth, and afterward the children of John Scri^ener, were enjoined
to do with their own hands) or of the unnatural fact of the children in
obeying this cruel command.

Jacobs children though they were not guilty of this sin by committing the
fact, yet might have been somewhat charged with it, for omitting that comfort
which they might have mi^istred to their father, for when Jacob saw his son
Joseph's ^a^ti-coloured coat all imbrued with blood, he was even at deaths
door and said, Genesis 37. 33.
it is my sons coat, a wicked beast has devoured him: Joseph is surely
torn in pieces, whereupon he rent his clothes, put sackcloth about his
loins, would go down into the grave unto his son mourning, and mourn for
him as long as he lived, yet none of them said, be of good cheer, thy son
Joseph lives, this coat was but dipped in the blood of a Kid, the worst that
has befallen thy son is this, he is sold to the Ishmalites: but nature it
self does so much abhor the sin of parricide, that me thinks I have a
Supersedeas to meddle no more with it. If you would know the reason why
children run into the breach of this Co^madement is the turning of the
commandment topsie turuy, for therefore the son does not honor his father,
because the father does honor his son, that is, does not correct them but
cocker them, for therefore is 1. Sam. 2. 29.
Ely said to honor his sons, because he gave them but light rebukes for
heavy sins, and the quantity of the punnishment was not answereable to the
quality of the offense: Heb. 12. 9
we have had the fathers of our bodies (says the Apostle) which corrected us,
and we gave them reverence; first he speaks of correction, and then of
reverence, as though reverence would not follow except correction as an usher
did go before it, what was it that caused Adoniah to deal so treacherously
with his father, as to usurp the Kingdom but this, 1. Kin. 1. 5. 6.
his father would not displease him from his childhood, to say, why have thou
done so? will you keep meat well sauoured, yet will ye neur salt it, will
you have sprigges sprout well, and yet will ye never loppe them? can children
have list in age to live as they should, and yet you give them liberty in
youth to live as they list? cast away correction, the child becomes rude, as
Ex. 4 3.
Moses rod cast from him turned to aserpent, but bring it forth it makes him
bring forth good fruit, as Number. 17. 7. 8.
Aarons rod laid forth brought forth buddes, brought forth blossoms, and
bare ripe almondes: therefore say not the rod causes blewnes, chiding
discourageth, breaking is violent, the yoke is heavy, but with the birch bend
children in youth like the birch, least you bewail them in age, for their
wilful irreuerence and stubborn disobedience: you parents many times jar
and snarre, you men and wives sometime bestow blows each on other, leave off,
reserve them for your children, they will do your sons and daughters more
good: correct them, make them know themselves, they will be a joy to your
hearts, they will be your glory, and as the Apostle speaking of the faithful
says, Heb. 11. 16.
God was not ashamed of them to be called their God, so you need not be
ashamed of them to be called their father, but let them run riot and take their
own swinge, dote upon them and displease them not, they will grieve your
hearts, and assure your selves that so many sorrows shall afflict you as a due
punnishment in age, (if 1. Sam. 4. 18.
with Elie you do not break your necks before) as you suffered vices in
them, in their youth they will prove like a generation of vipers, which rend and
tear their mothers sides, and the dishonor which they will do unto you, will
be as a sword passing thorough your hearts: thus having stepped a little aside to
show the cause of childrens disobedience, I return to the charge.

Honor thy father, that is thy master for he is paterfamilias, the father of
his household, and therefore 2. Kin. 5. 13.
Naamans servants call their Master father: and on the other side the Master
(as Mat. 8. 6.
the Centurion) calls his servant son, for the word (...) signifies son
as well as servant, and we may say of servants, God has made them little lower
then sons, as David said of man, Psalm. 8. 5.
thou have made him a little lower then Angels, but a little lower, and God
accounting servants as sons says, Col. 3. 24
they shall receive the reward of the inheritance.

The Master has a care of his servant to give them meat in due season, and
though he does not say by and by when his servant comes from the field, Luc.
17. 7. 8.
Go and sit down at table, yet afterward he says, eat thou and drink thou.
And Pro. 31. 15
the wise and worthy woman for her part rises while it is yet night and gives
the portion to her household, and the ordinary to her maids, if God does visit
the servants with sickness, the Master does not shut his doors upon them or
send them to an hospital, but keeping them in sickness uses the best means
he can for their recovery, 1. Sam. 30 13.
not dealing as the Amalekite, who left his servant because he fell sick, but
like the good Centurion, who coming unto Christ in the behalf of his servant
says, Mat. 8. 6.
Master, my servant lies sick at home of the palsy and is grievously payned,
but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed. Again he allows
them lawful times of honest recreation, and will not wear them to the back,
as though they were made for nothing but his servitude: he will pay them their
wages at their time concluded on, and not find or frame excuses to discarde
them empty, in a word he will so use them, that if opportunity serve, they
shall feel the sweetness of their service, and his bounty: In regard of the
soul, he is a Seraphim to kindle their zeal, and reckoning his servants as
much his, as he is his own, has a care that they walk with their God, and
do not transgress the limits of honesty, like that noble man, who had for his
Impresse, two bundles of ripe Millet bound together with this Motto, seruari et
seruare meum est, for the nature of the Millet, is both to guard it self from
all corruption, and also to preserve from putrefying those things which lie
near it: thus does the good Master, and therefore his servants honor him, but
if he should be of a contrary disposition, Psa. 123. 2.
yet the eyes of servants, must look to the hands of their Masters, and the
eyes of a maiden to the hand of her Mistress, a good servant must be subject
to his bad Master, as far forth as he may do him service with clean hands
and with an honest heart, and this is that which Saint Peter wishes, when he
says that servants d 1. Pet. ^. ^8.
should be subject not only to good and courteous Masters, but also to the
froward, for then a clean napkin does wipe a foul mouth.

This honor consists in reverence, in token whereof 2. Sam. 9. 11.
Ziba does acknowledge, David his Lord, and himself his servant: in obedience,
in witness whereof the Centurion says, Mat. 8 9.
I say tomy servant, do this and he does it in diligence, and therefore Genesis
2 54.
Abraham's servant, when he nath suffered his eyes to sleep and his eie-lids to
slumber, and the temples of his head to take a little rest, will not for all
entreaties admit for any longer stay, but like an arrow out of a bow hastes to
dispatch the business whereabouts his master sent him: in faithfulness, which
caused Ge^. 24. 33
Abraham's servant to prefer his masters business before his own necessity,
which made Ge^. 39. 9
Joseph true to his master, notwithstanding the inticements of his mistrisse,
which makes many servants hazard their own lives for their masters safety.

This serves to condemn such servants, as will be hail fellow well met with
their masters, secondly, such as being bid to do any thing will give their
master leave to do it himself, or at least murmur and grumble, reason the
matter and answer again; Thirdly, eye servants, which will do good service,
but yet no longer then their masters eye is upon them, such a one is that
servant in the Gospel, who Mat. 24. 49.
in his masters absence does revel and take on, as though he would throw the
house out at the window; such a servant did that fat man meet withal, who
being asked, why being fat he did ride upon lean horse, answered, I feed my
self, but trust my man to feed my horse: Fourthly, such as are treacherous to
their masters, and by discovering them, or their secrets do bring them into
danger; but here a question may be moved, how far forth a master or his
secrets may be concealed.

We read in Chronicles, that when Richard the third that usurper did pursue the
Duke of Buckingham to put him to death, for tyrants use to cut down the
stairs by which they climb up: the Duke in extremity did fly for succor to
one Banaster his servant, upon whom he had bestowed great means to enrich
him: Banaster very carefully conveyed him into a Cops, adjoining to his
mansions house and there preserved him, but within a while there is
proclamation made, that whosoever can reveal where the Dnke is, if he be a
bondsman he shall be infranchised and made free, if a freeman, he shall have a
general pardon, and be rewarded with a thousand pounds, hereupon Banaster,
either for fear of danger, which might ensue, if he did conceal him, or hope
of gain which he thought to receive, if he did reveal him, bewrayed where his
master was, whereupon he was apprehended, examined and executed: he that
writes this story does much condemn Banaster as one that betrayed his master,
and therefore the judgments of God did follow him, and his as long as he
lived, for shortly after his son and hair waxed mad, and died in a bores
stye: 2. his eldest daughter of an excellent beauty was suddenly stricken with
a foul leapery: 3. his second son became lame and very deformed in his
limbs: 4. his younger son was drowned in a shallow puddle: 5. he himself in
his old age was arraigned and found guilty of a murder, and had been hanged
had he not been saved by his Clergy: 6. where he looked for a thousand pounds
King Richard gave him not one farthing, but as much disliking his doing, said,
he that would be false to so good a master would never be true unto any: but
let this suffice to have spoken of the honor due unto the father of the house,
whither he be Pater or Paterfamilias a father by nature, or a father by office
for the good ordring and training up of those, which are committed to his
charge.

Besides fathers of the house, which the Philosophers call Oeconomicall, there
are fathers of the country, or common wealth called political land these are
first our betters in place, as Kings, and all that are in authority: concerning
Kings the Scripture calls them Esa. 49. 23.
nourishing fathers, we must therefore honor them, and willingly bend our
necks to be subject to them.

The Scripture inforceth this honor by diverse reasons; First from Gods
ordinance, Ro^. 13. 1.
the powers that are, are ordained of God, inde illis potestas vnde spiritus,
Pro. 8. 15
by me Kings reign (says Wisdom) and Princes decree justice. Genesis 1. 2
In the beginning the earth was without form, void, and darkness was upon the
deep.

Ante mare and terras, and quod tegit omnia coelum;
Vnus erat toto naturae vultus in orb:
Quem dixere Chaos, rudis indigestaque moles.
Now lest the body of the common wealth should be like the confused Chaos,
when hight and depth, light and darkness were mingled together, God ordained a
power, a right of rule and government, which superiors have over inferiors,
a King over subjects, there is some show of this superiority and subjection in
things without life: for in music, which consists in voice and sounds, the
counter-tenor seems to command over the base, and oil does swim above other
liquours, in things without reason, for in the earth the Lion is President
among the beasts, the Eagle among the birds, in the salt and fresh waters, the
Whale rules in the sea, the Pike in the pooles: and man to whom God has given
life, sense, and reason rules over all: He has put all things in subjection
under a Ps. 8. 6.
his feet, but the King above other men as the head above the members, the
Cedar among the trees, the Sun among the Stars, and God himself among the
Angels, this is Gods ordinance, which to cross is to war against God, and
therefore on the one side, Pro. 28. 2
because of transgression, the land has many Princes; But Non been cum socijs
regna venusque manent, and that which is the same with it,

Nec regna socium far nec tedae sciunt, Love and Lordshippe can abide no
fellowshippe: many master Pilots when every one desires to hold the rudder
hinder one another, and therefore the common wealth where many will rule,
except it be subordinat^ly, one under another; is like Plinies Amphisbaena, a
serpent which had an head at each end of her body, and while both strive which
should be the master head, the body is toyled miserably, and in the end rent
and torn both sometime: on the other side no King is a judgment, for then the
Esa. 3. 6.
Prophet shows, there follows confusion, when every one refuses to be a
Governor: and one cause of great disorder, which was among the people of God
is noted to be this; Iud. 17. 6
in those days there was no King in Israel, and it is noted as a just wonder
that Pro. 30. 27.
the grasshoppers have no King, yet they go forth by bands: for the body of the
common wealth which wants a chief Rul^r is like the body of Poliphemus without
an eye, and in such a state men are as fishes Hab. 1. 14
which devour one another: to blame therefore are the seditious Anabaptists,
who liking best an Anarchy like untamed horses lift up their heels against
government, but whatsoever they teach yet in their rebellion, popular
aequality was so burdensome unto them, that contrary to their own doctrine
they had John Matthew to their captain, and John Alyed to their head, and
amongst their devils, Beel-zebub the chief of devils:

I speak not here against free States, which are ruled in common, not by one
Prince, but by the best men, or by the whole people, yet even amongst these one
had the preeminence, as the Consul at Rome for his month, the provost at
Athens, each of them (...) for their week, each (...) for his day, but this I
say to the commendation of a Monarchy, that whereas no Aristocraticall or
popular estate has lasted longer then six hundred years, and few so long
many Monarchies have continued twice as long in the same estate, neither does
any government draw so near to nature as this herein, because God has
ordained the King to have the supremacy, therefore the subjects must honor
him: and secondly honor him, because he appointeteh judges and Magistrates
under him, 1 Pet. 2. 14.
for the punnishment of evil doers, and praise of them that do well: for the
punnishment of evil doers, and therefore as they carry a balance in one hand,
so do they bear a sword in the other, with the one they justly weigh
litigious and controuersed causes, with the other they punnish malefactors, and
maintain the innocent, they are physicians of the common wealth, and minister
Potions to rid out distemperate humors, for the wicked are as it were the
oppression of nature, the surcharge and surfit of the stomach, which cannot be
eased, except such inhabitants be spued out of it: if any bad member be bred in
the body of the common wealth they cut him off, as surgeons cut off certain
limbs in the body, which are infectious -- ne pars sincera trahatur: if bad
members come from other places as Seminaries, and Jesuits, do from Rome, they
be like the bird Ibis, which destroys the serpents which come out of Libia
into Egypt, very hurtful to their Country: Aaron and his sons do
consecrate their hands to God in the holy slaughter of sin, but when Aarons
vrim and Thummim will do no good, then comes Moses with his rod and staff,
when the tongue cannot persuade, the rod does compel, and when the sword of
the spirit meets with such iron hearts, that it enters not, but is rebated,
then does the arm of the Magistrates bruise them with a rod of iron, and
break them in pieces like a potters vessel.

As the Magistrate is the Comet of the guilty, so is he the refuge of the
innocent, his seat is a shelter to such as are oppressed, and a sanctuary to
all that are distressed; his breast is an Ocean, whereinto the cares of private
men do empty themselves, which when he has received, he presently seeks to
ease them by repressing the violence of such as do vex them, and as though
there were a writ directed to him from God, much like a fieri facias, he goes
about to right those that are wronged: Neither does a good King always this by
Deputies alone, but as though he had received an Impresse from God, much like
the Roll of Eze. 2. 9.
Ezechiell, with this motto of Moses, Number. 11 12.
carry them in thy bosom: he himself is a guarde unto his subjects, against
catterpillers and cormorants, and bastards fawcons.

It is written to the commendation of Marcus Aurelius, that dividing the hours
of the day for the business of his Empire, he allotted one hour to hear the
complaints of the grieved, the suits of poor men and widows wanting justice,
and that two days in the week; he would walk abroad to see if any person
would speak with him, or make complaint unto him; On the other side, it is
written to the discommendation of other persons, that they admitted not those
Est. 4. 2.
which by their apparel did testify their mourning.

Thus you see the good milk, which Kings as nurces send forth in the streams
of justice, pity, and compassion: Saint Paul setting out the blessings which
we reap by means of good Kings, mentions especially these three, 1 Timothy 2. 2
Peace, Godliness, and honesty, each of these is a great blessing, peace,
whither we respect deliverance from enemies abroad, for therefore was Arabia
called faelix, because the people living in continual peace, had their towns
unwalled: or whither we respect quiet from discord at home, it is well with
Bees when they make a noise in their hiues, but it is well with men, when they
be at quiet in the common wealth, happy is this land of ours, which has
received this benefit by good Princes, happy be the remembrance of King Henry
the 7. who joined the Roses, the Houses of York and Lancaster together, and so
freed it from civil dissension: and before that time happy be the remembrance
of King Henry the 2. in subduing Wales unto England, though this was done
Armorum strepit^, but since that time, still twice happy be the remembrance of
our gracious King James, who with quietness has pulled down the wall of
partition betwixt England and Scotland, and having come over on this side
Jorden, has planted the Tribes of his Israel and people on both sides the
Rivers, thus the Rivers go again unto the Sea, and the dove is returned with
an Olyue branch in her mouth to the Arc from whence she came forth; and we
hope that all three peoples shall long and long, yea for ever dwell in the
Tabernacle of peace, and in sure dwellings, and in safe resting places, for
their peace sing Te Deum in the highest note, when many other Nations cry
Miserere in a mournful voice, since the same continent contains them all,
the same Kingdom and government rules them all, the same Religion instructs
them all, since these three most sure bonds, natural, civil, and religious,
knits them all together, which has been twisted by our mighty Monarch, and
therefore surely like to hold out for ever, E^ 4. 12.
a three fold cord is not easily broken.

The second benefit mentioned by the Apostle is Godliness: A good Prince like
Canutus before the conquest makes laws by counsel of his sages, binding his
subjects one rule of Christian Religion, well and advisedly to hold, not giving
countenance, either to Jewish, Turkish, Greekish, or Popish Religion, though
all these stand for competition of truth, but only to the Reformed, driving
his subjects as a good shepherd his sheep altogether to green pastures, not
dispencing with any, since none are exempted by God, denying a tolleration,
either to the cause of Papists, lest it should infect the persons, or to the
persons lest it should credit the cause.

The third benefit is Honesty: A good Prince has a care that there be just and
honest dealing betwixt man and man, that he which has much, setting honesty
aside, does not tyrannize over him that has little, that the fat cow does not
devour the lean, and the full ear eat up the poorer corn, that one does
not by fraud take away another land, or by violence hold that, which is none
of his, or convert other men's goods to his use: in a word, that men do not
live like beasts; but honestly and uprightly one with another: these three I
say are great blessings, which we enjoy under good Princes, and the want of any
one of them is a great blemish in a common wealth, peace without godliness is
but security, godliness without honesty, is but hypocrisy, honesty without
godliness is but paganism, and a glistering sin, neither godliness nor honesty
without peace can well be maintained: Godliness is the sum of the first
Table, honesty the Sum of the second, peace an happy manner of enjoying them
both.

Lastly honor the King, for God himself honors him, in stiling him by his
name, for as Patriarch and Prince have interchangeable names (for the Hitites
called Abraham the Patriarch a Prince, thou art a Prince of God among us: and f
Genesis 23. 6
to make even Peter calls David the Prince, Patriarch, Act. 2. 29
I may boldly speak unto you of the Patriarch David) so God and the King have
interchangeably borrowed names; Ps. 20. 9.
God is a King in heaven, the King is a God on earth, herein honoring the
King, in giving him his own name, as Jacob honored Joseph's b Ps. 82. 6.
sons, when he said, Genesis 48. 16.
Let my name be named upon them: now as the people honor him, whom the King
does honor, (in token whereof they cried before Joseph Ge^. 41. 43
Abrech, that is tender father, in token whereof Haman brought Mordocai on
horseback, after he had arrayed him in royal apparel through the streets of
the City, and proclaimed before him, ( Thus e Hest. 6. 11
shall it be done to the man, whom the King will honor) so must they much more
honor the King, whom God does honor.

This honor consists not only in reverence, in regard whereof it was not
lawful so much as to laugh in the Court of the Areopagites, and even the
Roman Censors disgraded a Burgess for yawning too wide in their presence,
not only in allegiance, which is as well pledged unto him by the obligation of
an oath, as it is due unto him by bonds of Nature, not only in fear, in token
of all which three, God has given Princes three special ensigns of honor,
Ps. 21. 3.
a Crown of gold for their sublimity, for which they must be reverenced, Eze.
19. 11.
a Scepter of righteousness for government, for which they must be obeyed;
Ro^. 13. 4
a Sword for vengeance, for which they must be feared; but especialy, it
consists in serving him with our goods for his maintenance, and with our
lives for his defense: with our goods for his maintenance, and therefore though
our Savior Christ wrought many miracles, yet he never wrought any about honor
or money; but that about tribute, b Mat 17.
rather then that should go vndischarged, he commanded a fish to pay it: for
this cause Christ does not say, date, but Mar. 22. 12.
reddite, quae sunt Caesaris, Caesari, and Saint Paul says, Ro^. 13. 6
ye pay tribute, as though it were a due debt, and therefore we must be
willing to discharge it.

Secondly, this honor to the King must show it self, in serving him with our
lives for his desense: The Bees in their common wealth have a King, whose
palace they frame as fair in show, as strong in substance, if they find him
fall, they establish him again in his throne with all duty, with all devotion,
they guard him continually for fear he should miscary, for love he should
not. The people 2 S. 18. 3
in the second book of Samuel would not have the least hurt befall King David,
and therefore when they went to war would not suffer him, though he were
forward in offering himself, to go forth with them, but they would put their
lives in hazard to save him harmeles. This serves to teach every subject to
do the best he can for his Princes safegarde, he that is in the place of
counsel by all the ways of wisdom, he that is in the seat of justice, by
due and just execution of the law, he that is in the Priests office by bowing
his knees and lifting up his hands: and not only this, but to go further, and
say to his King as Peter to Christ, Mat. 26. 35.
I will ieoparde my life for thy sake, and though I should die with thee, yet I
will not deny thee. Again this serves to condemn those, who are so far
from putting themselves in ieopardy for their King, that they will adventure
their lives to make him away, as Brutus and Cassius, who slew Caesar in the
Senate house, as Simon the Monk who first drank himself of the Wassall bowl
into which he had conveyed the venom of a toade, that he might poison King
John, at the Abbey of Swinestead. This in latter time condemns the Pope, who
promised earthly and heavenly recompense to Parry for offering his service to
kill Queen Elizabeth. It condemns Doctor Allen, who taught that Princes
might be violently handled, deposed from their throne or exposed to danger. It
condemns the Jesuits, who celebrate them as Martyrs, who lost their lives
in the North, for bearing arms against the Queen.

I conclude therefore this point of honor, with that saying of Saint Paul;
Ro^. 13. 1.
Let every soul submit himself to the higher powers: every one, without
respect of persons, not every body, but every soul, with respect to a willing
mind, to higher powers without exception against their qualities, which makes
against the priests in Hildebrands time, who taught the people that they owe no
subjection to evil Kings, and though they have sworn fidelity, they must not
perform it, nor yet be accounted periurers for holding against their King; but
whatsoever they are that bear rule, we must submit our selves, their will
must be done, aut a nobis, aut de nobis, of us, or on us; when their laws
agree with Gods, then we must be agents, when they are dissonant, then we
must be patients, if Kings entering upon Gods freehold will broach a new
Gospel, or coin another Creed, they must not be obeyed therein, Dan 3. 18
Be it known unto thee O King, (say the three children Sidrah, Misach, and
Abednego) that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden Image, which
thou have set up. He that obeyes a wicked command, is as much to blame, as he
that does enjoin it, yet must we submit our selves to the punishment which
shall be laid upon us, for that we obey not, knowing that bad Kings are
tempters, and we must receive our trial with patience.

An other sort of Fathers to whom honor is due, are our elders in years, for
the Apostle teaching Timothy, how he should behave himself in rebuking all
degrees, calls them fathers; 1 T. 5. 1. 2
Exhort an elder as a Father, the younger men as Brethren, the elder women as
Mothers, the younger as Sisters. This the Prophet Esaias notes to be a sign of
extreme confusion; Esa. 3. 5.
when the children shall presume against the ancient, and the vile against the
honorable, and there fore Leu. 19. 32.
Moses gives in charge to rise up before the horehead, and honor the person of
the old man: In token of this honor at Rome the younger sort were wont to lead
the elder sort home.

Magna fuit quondam capitis reuerentia cani,
Inque suo praetio rugasenilis erat.
how were they wont to reverence a man that had ouerliued the taste of his
pallat, the sight of his eyes, the hair of his head, the teeth of his gummes,
on whose forehead was figured the map of age, in the furrows of whose face
appeared the calenders of death: but sape nigrum cor est, caput album.

Some are in their nonage for affections when they are in their dotage for
years, and are such as Plutarch says of Sardanapalus, 1. Tim. 5. 6.
and Paul of a widow living in pleasure, they are dead while they live, such
as Seneca says of an old man, non ille tam diu vixit sed tam diu fuit, as
though being altogether unprofitable he had out lived himself, told three or
foure-score years and then dyed, these have but barely age, and therefore but
one step unto honor, but if they be like flowers, which have their roots
perfect, when themselves are withering, if with roses they keep a sweet savor
though they loose their color, if with the Sun they give greatest glimpse at
their going down, if they be so pregnant and ready to give counsel, as if many
years were gone back again in the course of their days, like 2. Kin. 20 11.
the hours upon Ahaz Dial, if their silver hairs containing great experience
have more certain skill then younger heads Job. 15. 10.
as Elyphaz argues they have, if they give a good example of sobriety,
honesty, discretion, soundnes in faith, in love and in patience Tit. 2. 2.
as Paul says they should if they have not only senectutem bonam, but bonum
senectutis, the fruits of piety, when the harvest of their years is come,
then honor them in giving reverence Leu. 19. 32.
as God commands, in giving ear to them as Job. 32. 4
Elihu to his ancients, in taking patterns from them, and bettring our own
carriage by following their steps, let them have all the honor that may be
according to the residue of the Poet saying.

-- sed quibus album
Et caput et cor est, sint in honor senes.
Now concerning spiritual fathers, these are Pastors and Ministers, which
work in us our regeneration and new birth, in which respect Paul says to the
Corinthians, 1. Cor. 4. 15.
ye have not many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you thorough the
Gospel, c Gal. 4 1^
and therefore he calls the Galathians his little children of whom he
travailed in birth again till Christ were formed in them: honor therefore
these fathers first in regard of their calling, Mala. 2. 7
for the Priest is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts, not a common Ambassador,
but legatus a latere, 1. Cor. 4. 1.
a disposer of the secrets of God, and as Nicodemus said unto Jesus, Ioh. 3. 2.
Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher sent of God, so they are first Rabbis
for their learning, having been Doctorum discipuli, before they come to be
imperitorum magistri, and sat at Gamaliels feet, before they warmed Moses
chair, they have not like lapwings run away with some part of their shell on
their heads, but stayed at Jericho till their beards were grown and had their
Nunc dimittis in the University, before they came to exuultemus in the
Country: Secondly they are sent of God for their license, and their commission
is sealed, when Christ says to his Disciples Mat. 28. 19.
go teach all nations: now he that contemns the Ambassador despises him
that sent him, 2. Sam. 10 6.
David accounted the abuse offered to his messengers as a dishonor done unto
himself, and therefore our Savior Christ says, Luc. 10. 16.
he that despises you, despises me, and he that despises me, despises him
that sent me: Again honor them in regard of their message, they bring tidings
of salvation, and Romans 10. 15.
how beautiful are the feet that is the coming of them which bring glad
tidings of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things? I say not, but they
may preach the law, but then they go plus vltra, they set abroach the Gospel
and make the wounded conscience drink of the water, they may bring their
hearers to the brinke of hell, but withal they tell them, they may stand fast
in Christ Jesus and look in, not so much as with a little thrust driving them
down, whom they see to stand on narrow footing: their message is to tell those
that are terrified by the law, that they must account Moses as an excomunicate
person: to let them hear, like John, Reu. 14. 2.
the voice of music after the voice of thunder, and 1. Kin. 19. 11.
with Elias a soft and still voice after a mighty strong wind which rent the
mountains, and brake the rocks before the Lord, to unbind the chains of
those which are held prisoners, Io. 11. 44.
to loose Lazarus and let him go, in a word with the Genesis 8. 11.
Dove to bring an Olyue branch to the Arc when the flood is ceased.

Now the first thing wherein this honor consists is in having the Minister
in reverent regard and estimation, as the Apostle advises, saying, 1. These. 5.
1^.
I beseech you brethren, know them that labor among you, and that are over you
in the Lord, etc. There is an hireling, enters in by the door, but regardes
not the sheep, yet tolerate the hireling, there is a thief, which enters not
by the door, and comes to destroy, beware of the thief, there is the good
shepherd, which enters in by the door, and cares for the sheep, know such
a one, account of him, and have him in singular love for his works sake. In
the old Testament why Ex. ^9. 42
does God appoint a place to parley with the Priest? why does God entering them
into commons, c ^eu. 6. 16
make them as his fellow commoners? Nu. 3. 12
why does he compare them to the first borne, and Number. 27.
appoint that the Prince should ask counsel of God, by the mouth of the
Priest? why would f Le. 21. 67
he not have the least spot of dishonesty in their houses? why does he manifest
by a miracle, that he is the author of the priesthood? why (when he would
brand the Israelites with a mark of greatest reproach) does he say, Hos. 4. 4.
Thy people are as they which rebuke the Priest? One special reason of all
this is, because the Priest should be priced and accounted off by man, as he is
esteemed by God: and here letting pass the Prophets, which are called 1 K. 13.
1
men of God, which are said to be of Gods Am. 3. 7.
privy counsel, which are counted 2 Ki. 5. 8.
the glory of Israel: why in the new Testament, are the Ministers called 1
Cor. 3. 9
Gods laborers? why is their 1 Th. 5. 20
preaching called prophesying? why are the hearers said to sit at their feet?
one special reason was this, to add more honor unto them, and make you
receive them with reverence.

To let pass Scripture, had it not been to make the very name of a Priest
venerable, they would not in former ages have chosen their Priests out of their
Philosophers, and their Kings out of their Priests: I speak this to the shame
of such proud and arrogant Squires, which think so basely of their Minister,
that he is not worthy so much as to wait upon their trencher, to the shame of
all Atheists, which make as much reckoning of their Ministers as the Egyptians
did of their shepherds, Geu 46. 34.
every sheep keeper was an abomination to the Egyptians: to the shame of all
such, as like the dog will bite the stone in stead of him that threw it, and
like Job 1. 15.
the devil will smite Jobs servants, when he cannot smite Job himself: The
Jews could say of Christ, Mat. 13. 55.
is not this the Carpenters son, is not his mother called Mary, are not such
and such his brethren and sisters, so the Gentiles can be content to know their
Ministers in the baseness of their birth, in the poorenes of their kindred, in
the smalenes of their livings, in whatsoever may any way disgrace them, they
will not know them in the worthiness of their calling, in the weight of their
message, in any thing which may make to add unto their commendation: God did
give honor to the builders of his material Tabernacle in calling them by
name, do not you then dishonor the builders of his d Ex. 35. 30
spiritual Temple, in calling them out of their name, as 2. Kin. 2. 23.
the children called Elisha baldehead neither do by mistaking a word in stead
of Sir, give them the Sirrah, you know that in respect of themselves they have
a commission from God, and that he who has a commission from a Prince, be he
never so mean a servant, yet excelles the very Nobles in those things
whereunto his commission reaches, you know again in respect of your selves,
were it not for their Ministrey, you were like Turks and infidels, never shipped
with Christ in Baptism while you are infants, that afterward, you might sail
with him in the pi^nisse of the Church, and at last anchor in the haven of
happiness, you could never partake the sacrament of Christ's body which should
strengthen you in your journey to heaven, 1 Kin. 19. 6. 8.
as Elias having eaten the baken cake walked to the mount of God: were it not
for their Ministry, you lived in adultery, and had the same comiunction with
harlots in wickedness, which now being husbands you have with your lawful wives
in matrimony, and by the appointment of God: were it not for their ministrey,
your children now lawfully begotten, were illegitimate, were base and therefore
even by the law of the land excluded from inheritance, happily you think I
take too much pain in rolling this stone, but considering your contempt, less
I cannot speak, and presupposing that with Sisyph^^ I shall spend my strength
in vain, more I will not.

A second point of this honor is to harken to them and yield obedience to
their Doctrine: Job speaking of his glory, says g Job. 29. 21.
men gave ear unto him, and waited, and held their tongue at his counsel, in
this respect 2. Cor. 1. 44.
Paul esteemed the Corinthians his glory, for that as Gods sheep having an
eare-marke they listened unto him, and therefore he says, though other 2. Cor.
3. ^
have need of letters of recommendation, yet he needed not, for when men
should hear of their faith, which by his means was wrought in them, when they
became teachable, this was sufficient certificate for him, there should need
no other epistle, no other hand and seal, they themselves were walking
pasports, they themselves were his epistles, letters testimonial, and the very
seal of his Apostleship, whom therefore 1. Cor. 9. 2.
he calls his rejoicing: and as on the one side detrimentum pecoris, est
ignominia Pastoris, for what greater dishonor can there be to the Minister,
then when men shall say, he has been in such or such a Parish, these ten,
twenty, or thirty years, yet his parishioners have need of milk, they are
unacquainted with the first rudiments of Christian Religion, they know not what
they must do to be saved, surely he has not chalked them out the way to
heaven, or else there is some great fault in him, God does not bless his
labors, he spends his strength for nothing, he runs in vain, without the
fruit of that he ran for. So on the other side, the profit of the people is the
praise of the Pastor: when men say of him and his flock, as they did of
Octauius and the walls of Rome, for what commendation was this to Octa^ius,
that coming into Rome and finding walls of brick, at his departing he left
walls of marble, so what honor is this to the Minister, that coming into a
Parish, and finding hearts of stone, at his departure like a cunning Alcumist
he leaves hearts of flesh, that finding the inhabitants like Luc. 15. 13.
the prodigal child a far off, like Luc. 15 ^
the lost sheep strayed out of Gods enclosures, into Satan's common; not only
by whisteling, but by crying unto them, he has brought them again to the
sheepe-fold: that finding them following the world, the flesh, and the devil,
he has made them Antipodes, and caused them to run contrary courses to other
men: this I say is an especial point of honor, when people are bettred by
their Pastors doctrine, when their words kindle with faith, and utter with
zeal, 1. Sam. 17 49.
like the stone out of David's sling has struck the sin and sinner at the
heart, when being before unprofitable trees, they are now filled with the
spirit, and bear fruit on every bough, and on every branch.

This serves to condemn such, as Ru. 2. 17.
with Ruth will not gleane the ears of corn, with the laborours in Gods
harvest, let fall, which come to Church for fashion sake, or to save the
penalty of the statute, or to find some Recipe to procure a sleep, which like
Ex. 5. 2.
Pharaoh will not harken unto Moses, though he comes with a message from God,
which Es. 53. 1.
will not believe the Prophets though they speak in the name of God: Luc. 16.
30.
which like the rich man makes no reckoning of Moses and the Prophets, which
Genesis 19. 14.
like Lots sone in laws, count the denouncing of particular judgments but a
mockage, and 2 Pet. 3. 4
the general judgment but a fable: but especially it condemns such as
resist the truth, 2. Tim. 3. 8.
as Iannes and Iambres withstood Moses, such as persecute their preaching which
was Alexanders fault, of whom Paul complaining says, 2. Tim. 4. 15.
he withstood our preaching sore, not our person, which had been a breach of
charity, but our preaching, which was a direct offense against piety: it
commends only such as get honor to their teachers, by receiving with
meekenes the word that is grafted in them, Ia. 1. 21.
which is able to save their souls.

The third thing, wherein this honor consists, is in giving maintenance, and
this must be pro, and contra; first in supplying things necessary for the
maintenance of their lives; secondly, in replying words necessary to maintain
their credit, when the lewder sort shall go about to take their good name from
them: Concerning the first, before the law, even in superstitious places as in
Egypt, when the famine was great, the Priests Genesis 47. 22.
had an Ordinary of Pharaoh, and did eat their Ordinary, which Pharaoh gave
them: If Idolatry fed her Priests, let not the Gospel sterue her Ministers; in
Nu^. 18. 21.
time of the law, God gave the Levites all the tenth in Israel, for an
inheritance for their service, which they served in the Tabernacle of the
congregation, after the law, Saint Paul gave as strict a charge for tithes as
ever Moses did, and therefore he uses (...) emphatically. Gal. 6. 6.
Let him that is taught in the word, make him that has taught him pertaker of
all his goods. But some say Act. 18. 3.
Paul wrought with his hands, true, but it was to win Disciples, which
otherwise he was not likely to have gotten, since at that time, false Apostles
preached freely to win the favor of the people.

Other say the Apostles were poor, I say these have the devotion of Judas,
Ioh. 12. 6.
who was a thief, and bare the bag. Another says, he takes no pain, he is
lazy, tongue tied, he is like Balaams Ass, which never opened his mouth to
speak, but it was a wonder to hear him: but I say tithes are laid forth by
public law, and public orders must not be privately altered: A fourth says,
I reap no profit by him, but go into the Church as an Aethi^pian into the
Bath, who comes out as black as he went in: this should as much discourage him
from preaching as thee from praying, what a grief is this unto him, that his

I give tithe of all that ever I possess, do not you come short of him who
comes short of heaven: you that are Ministers, be not contentious in small
matters, but in great wrongs, be not too much patient, to the hurt of the
Church, Ios. 21. 1.

the division; the workman is worthy of his hyre, and therefore look for your
penny, when you have labored in the Vineyard, and require that allowance which
is made over unto you as a deed of gift by this commandment.

The second kind of maintenance is in standing for the Ministers good name,
when bad men shall broch false rumors of him, and ill will disperse spightfull
narrations to disgrace his worth by malice; when the Mar. 12. 2
Pharisees did think the Disciples faulty they come and tell their Master,
when the Master, Mat. 9. 11.
they tell the Disciples, the lines of Satan boldly open their mouths with a
conceit of impunitie to speak their pleasure of the Minister in his absence,
setting their tongues to sound nothing but detraction and slanders, croking
like frogs in the fen till he come near them, but Christ, though he stoppes
not the Pharisees mouths from speaking ill, yet he opens his mouth to reprove
them, and to make an apology for his Disciples, in such a case Rom 16. 4
Aquila and Priscilla stand for Paul, though they do it with dangering of
their own lives: In the law, Ex. 23. 1.
thou shall not receive a false tale of any much less of thy Minister, thou
must not be a nurse of his ill fame* but let the reporter see in thy face, that
he has no room in thy heart, he that opens his mouth to detraction is a
thief, he that opens his ears to entertain it, is a receiver, both of them
carry the devil with them, the one in his tongue, the other in his ears: we
have a saying, and it is true, their would not be so many thieves, if there
were not so many receivers, so there would not so many rob the renown of their
Minister, and clip his cridit to make him lighter esteemed, were it not that
the heare^s open their ears to receive, and suffer untrue and malicious
reports to get credit among them. To conclude this point therefore, let not the
ear be an open Sepulcher, therein to bury thy Ministers good name, but let thy
mouth be open to reprove those, which like madd dogs, lay out their venomous
tongu^s and hasten to byte it with their teeth; neither thy self pare his
estimation, as 2. Sam. 10 4.
Hanun did the garments of David's Ambassadors, neither give way to such as
carry his dirt on their tongues, as though their mouths were Neh. 3. 14
the doung-gate, thorough which the filth in Jerusalem was carried forth,
speak thou well of him always, if it may be done with truth, if it cannot,
then lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and of the two rather harken to him, which in
censuring the Ministers makes a bad one good by partiality, and smothes his
unworthiness by favor, then to him which makes a good one evil by malice, and
does disgrace him by envy: for men will not willingly taste of the fruit, when
it shall be said, a bad tree did bear it. Thus you see what the honor is
which this commandment requires, you see who the fathers are which have a
charter for it, to each of which we give the more honor the better patterns
they have been of virtue, not so much honoring them, whose wit has contrived
a plot of preferment, as them, whose worth has been a stirrup to raise the^
out of the dust. There are other; which set in foot for this honor, but their
title to it is like that claim, which the harlot laid unto the child, 1.
Kin. 3. 23.
who, when she had ouerlayde her own son, made challendge to that which was
none of hers, the first and worst of these are they, which being fathers of
mischief, lords of misrule, and notable in some kind of villainy, as though
they were gallant fellows glory in their sin, and will, like wartes and
swellings in the body, be above other, such a one was Nouellius Tricongius, who
looked for an honorable place, for that he was able to drink three pottles of
wine together with one breath, and true it is, that in recompense of this good
service, the Emperor Tiberius made him Proconsull.

Other, though not so full of vice, yet as void of virtue, being tainted with
ambition, seek the greatest dignities: In war we honor such as will not
turn backs upon the enemy, nor niggardly grudge their blood when God or their
Country call for it; such a one as Leonides was, to whom, when his soldiers,
as being dismaide, said, that the shot of the enemies arrows was so thick,
that it covered the Sun, then said he, let us fight in the shade: but Comineus
upon the battle of Montlebery says, that even those, which showed themselves
most dastardes and cowardes, not only sought after great offices, but also did
obtain them, some, says he, lost their offices for running away, which were
bestowed on other, that fled ten leagues further. Thus many times both empty
vessels swime aloft, and rotten posts are guilt with adulterate gold, the
worst weeds spring up brauest, and when the twines do strive in Rebeccaes
womb, Ge^. 25. 25
the worst comes forth and has the first place: I wish I could not exemply
this in some few of our own coat, of our own calling, who though they know
themselves fitter implements for the belfrey, then to open Gods book in the
pew, or in the Pulpet, though they see men of excellent parts content
themselves with a low sail, and shrowding themselves in willing secrecy, like
good corn l^e in the bottom of the heap, till they are called forth of their
chosen obscurity, yet do they put themselves forth before their time, do
iustle for great places do hold out their cap to ^eceiue the alms of fortune
complaining, if they ( Ex. 9. 10.
like the ashes sprinkled toward heaven, when God sent botches and sores on man
and beasts) be not lift a loft, if they be crossed or defeated, or brought to
a loss in the heat of their chase, Dan. 2. 31
with Nabucadnezzar they dream of great Images, Dan. 4. 8.
of great and strong trees, Genesis 41. 2. 5.
with Pharaoh of fat kine and full ears, the imaginations of their sleep
show what their disposition is when they are awake: Iud. 9 15
with the bramble in the parable they will be above other trees, 1. Sam 14 13.
with Jonathan and his armor bearer they will climb up, though it be by the
raggednes of the rocks: with the Pro. 30. 28.
spider in the Proverbs, they will ^ake hold with their hands, and be in
Kings palaces: but while they seek the greatest dignities they find the
greatest shame, and like Apes when they be clyming they do the more show their
deformities, for before, some few knew their insufficiency, but now being
importunate to be eminent, all the world may see, that they have pride matched
with their unworthiness: but howsoever, honor, if it rise not of men's own
worth, of their virtues and knowledge is falsely given, is wrongfully taken,
and therefore the heathen building a Temple to honor did in such sort adioyne
unto it a temple to virtue, that a man could not possibly get into that, but he
must of necessity pass thorough this.

An other sort of chafe that will be above the corn is gathergood, a man who
having been good, with a rake and scraped much mucke together, now steps in,
and would be garnished with whole pounds of honor, though he has scarce one
dram of honesty, hereupon he shoulders for a title, he seeks Knighthood
praece et praetio, he has Hares feet to go up the hill, he posteth for pomp
and frothy ostentation, as fast as Iehu hasted forth his Charet, 2. Kin. 9. 20.
he drove as if he had been mad: he has proiected a plotte to rise, he
seeks his rising with importunity, with servile flattery, with cleaving like
a burre to some great man's coat, rather then he will return void of a title?
And indeed, it many times so falls out, that his wealth procures him honor,
as well as his oppression, his usury procured him wealth, this is also a
solecisme and like false Latin, for honor and substance do not agree
together, except substance has some other adiect unto it, we set not so much
by the vessel as by the liquor that is in it, not so much by the chest as by
the treasure it contains, not so much by a man for his outward goods as
inward goods, and therefore let wealth and worth go together, let goods and
goodness kiss each other.

The last sort which would have their share in this honor, and whose plea
seems best for it, are they, which descend of more noble blood then other,
and can fetch their pedigree furthest off, but even these must know, that they
are not to stand on the greatness and antiquity of their race, if they lack
virtue, whereof greatness took her beginning: Beatus Ludonicus being asked,
what honorable surname should be given unto him, demanded again, from whence
it was, that he had greatest nobility, and when some said, of his Predecessors,
others of his birth place, I do not remember, says he, that ever I had
greater honor, then when I became a Christian, and this was at Pissiacum, and
therefore will I be called Ludouicus de Pissiaco. and so he was, he thought no
birth to a new birth in Christ, no parentage to that of having God to his
father. Do we reckon of the wine that runs on the lees, because it was
drawn out of the same piece, the neat wine was, do we reckon of muddy water,
though it came from a clear spring, shall we, with the Israelites, bow to a
molten calfe, because it was made of golden earings? It was the saying of old
English Chaucer, to do the gentle deeds, that makes the gentleman: gentry
without virtue is blood indeed, but blood without sewet, blood without
sinews, blood is but the body of gentility, excellency, of virtue is the
soul, that without this is a body without a soul, and without honor falls
down in the dust: and therefore, when Hermodius a noble man borne, imbraided
the valiant Captain Iphicrates, for that he was but a shoomakers son, my
blood, said Iphicrates, takes beginning at me, and thy blood at thee now
takes her farewell: be the birth never so base, yet honesty and virtue is free
from disgrace, be the birth never so great, yet dishonesty and vice is subject
to dishonor. To conclude therefore if thou be noble by thy birth, prove not
ignoble either by bad vices of thine own, or lewd devises of other, take thy
great birth to be an obligation of great virtue, suite thy behavior unto it,
and inoble thy parentage with piety, and since true honor must come of thy
self, and not of other, work out thine own glory, and stand not on what thou
would borrow of thy predecessors: If thou reach not the goodness of those
which gave the outward glory, know it is thy pride to be transported with a
vain name* if thou do not as much honor thy house with the glory of thy
virtues, as thy house has honored thee with the title of thy degree; know
thou art but as a wo^d^n knife put into an empty sheath, to help fill up the
place, when that if good mettle is lost, and can no more be found: if thou
do^st not learn Patrizare, and let thy fa^hers virtue meet with thy blood,
know thou art but as a painted fire which may become the wall, but gives no
light to the beholder, nay know further that the greater the honor of thy
father was, the greater is thy blemish and reproach, if thou come short of thy
fathers virtue, for now art thou guilty of neglecting so good a President.

They that are noble, will have their retayners seek the worship of their
estates in the service of them, then let themselves seek the honor of their
estates in the service of God, and be as careful to get true honor by serving
him, as their followers to receive civil worship by serving them.

That thy days may be long: Genesis 32. 26.
Jacob would not let the Angel go before he blessed him: nor the Lord part
with this commandment, before it leaves a blessing behind upon them which do
observe it; so that the entrance into this second table Ex 12. 7.
like the door posts of the Israelites has a blessing upon it: Ephesians. 6. 2.
Saint Paul calls this the first Command-ment with promise, not but that the
second Commandment, has a general promise of mercy for the general service
of God: but this is the first, that has a particular promise made unto them,
which perform the particular duties which it requires: and secondly the
first, not that a second follows with any express promise, for first has
not always relation to a second thing Rom ^. 8.
as we may see in the Epistle to the Romans, and therefore Heluidius
argument, is false to prove the virgin Mar^ had a second son, because the
Holy Ghost says, Mat. 1. 25
she brought forth her first begotten son and called his name Jesus: and a
Commandment with promise, not that God does bind himself that they which
honor their parents shall always live long, for Gods promises of temporal
blessings are Hypotheticae an^ go with condition sometime expressed, sometime
suppressed, which condition is as an oar in a boat, or stern of a ship, and
turns the promise another way. The first thing therefore which here I observe
is that long life is to be reckoned among the blessings of God: It was a
blessing of God upon Israel that being in the wilderness 40. years Deu. 29. 5
their garments did not wear Ios. 9. 5.
as the garments of the Gibeonites, so if in many years some men's strength
wears not, their senses do not decay, their bodies, which are as the garments
of their souls, hold out longer then other men's, as though with the Eagle they
did renew their youth, and God did add certain years unto their days. Esa.
37. 5.
as he did unto Ezechias, this is a great blessing of God.

Men are full of holes and take water at a thousand breaches, some go away by
si^kenes, some by violence, some by famine some by fulness, sometime death Mat.
2. 16
is in the cradle, 2. Kin. 4. 40.
sometime in the pot, sometime in the cup, therefore Job does not say the
grave, but the graves were prepared for him, to show that he was besiedged with
many deaths, and that he had but one life among a number of deaths which were
ready for him: now if death, which seeks for us every hour and in every
place, be long before it find us, if having an habeas corpus, he will not
serve his process, till our years be as many ages, and we are satisfied with
long life, if when our life hangs in the balance and there is but a step
between us and death, if we be continually as one traveling with child, if
we walk thorough the valley of the shadow of death, and our soul be always
in our hand, yet we multiply our days as the sand, and even like Salamanders
live long in the fire, this is a blessing of God. Some enter no sooner into
life but they are at the brinke of death, receiving at once their wel-come and
their farewell, their lamp it wasted as soon as lighted, and their life at an
ebb before the tide be full, others like flowers are gathered while they be
fresh, and being like a sentence interrupted before a period, begin like some
summer fruit to rotte as soon as they are ripe, death writes them Dan. 5. 3.
as he did the Chaldean tyrant a letter of Summaunce to appear that night
before him: It is a curse of God upon the bloodthirsty and deceitful man, Ps.
55. 23
he shall not live out half his days, it was a punishment of God upon Elie
for cockering his sons and upon his sons for their disobedience, 1. Sam. 2.
32. 33.
the multitude of thine house shall dye when they be men, there shall not be an
old man in thine house for ever: it was a plague of God upon Israel that
though they brought up their children, Hos. 9. 12
yet God would deprive them from being men: a plague upon the wicked, Job. 36.
14.
that their soul does dye in youth, Job. 22. 16
that they are cut off before their time Genesis 38. 7.
like Er and Onan as not worthy to live upon the earth; and on the other side
it is Gods blessing, if he increase, the length of our days and years of our
life, if we multiply our days as the sand, if death demand not his due, till
the crows feet be in our eyes, if we dye Job. 42. 17.
with Job being old and full of days, and go to our grave in a full age,
Job. 5. 26.
as a ricke of corn comes in good season into the barn.

This serves first to confute that heathen who said, optimum est non nasci,
proximum quam cito aboleri, the best thing is never to be borne, and the second
best is to dye quickly, for though this life be over spread with sins and
cares and crosses, which like a filthy morphew make it loathsome to all
judicious eyes, yet all these are but accidental, life it self is a blessing,
and the longer we live, the more experience we have of Gods favor, a greater
loathing of the sins which our youth delighted in, and larger time of
repentance.

Again this teaches that we must not hasten forward the end of our days, and
bring our selves out of breath before our race be ended, for this is to
throttle and choke the blessing of God, let therefore the thread of thy life be
drawn out by Lachesis till (...) be sent to cut it in sunder: let not the
spirit resign over it borrowed mansion, till natural moisture of it self
does soake away, till like a Sise or wax candle it be consumed to the socket,
and the last drop of moisture quenches the last spark of glory, surrender not
thy self when a conceit takes thee, let the landlord take it at his pleasure,
do not like a coward run away, but then depart in peace, when God says,
return again thou son of Adam, and then willingly pay tribute to Nature,
when of themselves the natural passages do close together: like an empty
bag neither love this life for delights in it, Ec. 1. 2.
for vanity of vanities and all is vanity, yet love it to serve God in it,
neither hate this life for the miseries of it, yet hate it so far forth as it
keeps thee in subjection to sin.

Again come not presumptuously into places, where some bodies are contagiously
sick, lest thou loose this blessing, and come untimely to thy grave, come not
within the lists of destru^ction, if Genesis 19. 20.
with Lot thou can have a Zoar to save thy self, fly as much from him, whose
disease would infect thy blood, as from him whose cruelty would spill it.

Lastly bestow cost as long as thou may, to continue this blessing by
upholding this ruinous house of thine, it is against the course of Nature, and
a way to tempt the very God of Nature wilfully to hinder our health, or not
seek means to continue it, or to recover it, God sends several diseases,
and has appointed several Medicines as reme^ies to encounter the^, therefore
honor the Physician and Es. 38. 21
with Ezechias lay a plaster upon the boil: say not man has his set period
as well as the sea it bounds, which it cannot pass; say not, life and death
is not in our own hands, for some seek death in misery, yet find it not,
others meet with it at feasts and gaudees, where they would fainest forget it,
say not when the glass is run do what we can, we can stay no longer, and
the clock will stricke when the minites be past, say not, let death se^ke us,
yet it shall not find us till our time be come, and therefore away with
Physic, what shall means do? for then a ^ope upon thee, try every knife,
eat Colloquintida thy belly full, freq^ent places where the air about thee
does infect, and where the breath of one body is poison to another, but in
matter of hope, where the end is not known 2. Chr. 16 12.
use means with Asa, though thou rely not upon them though many times they
avail not.

Days: though some men's lives be long, yet the Lord says not, long years,
long months, but long days, and David measu^eth their length not by a goade
or an ell, but by an hand, Ps. 39. 5.
thou have made my days as it were a span long, to show how shorst this long
life is, and howsoever we patch and piece these poor cottages of ours, yet
they will come in manus domini and shortly fall into the Lords hands: Let old
men in their arithmeticke, deduct their night (for sleep which is like unto
death, being the customer of man's life, taxes the nights to his own use) and
they shall find half their time stricken off at one blow. let them deduct
their prime days, for Ec. 11. 10*
childehood and youth are vanity, another part is cut off, let them deduct the
days of sortow, which are rather to be termed death then life, and all their
days are gone, for life and misery are twines Hipocrates twines, borne
together and dye together: The Lacedemonian in Plutarch hearing the
Nighttingale sing sweetly* took her into his hand, and having stripped her of
her feathers said tantum vox, she was nothing but voice, such is the life of
him that can sing the merriest note; if you strip it of sickness, strip it of
cares, strip it of sorrow: Genesis 5. 27.
M^thusal^h lived longest of all our forefathers, yet he lived not a thousand
years, but grant he had, yet a 2. Pet. 3. 8
thousand years to God are but as one day, but we, who commonly exceed not
threescore years and ten, live not an hour to that day, and therefore Solomon
as though our days were not worthy the title of time, mentioned not a time to
live, but Ec. 3. 2.
a time to be borne, and a time to dye, as though death did border upon life,
as though our cradle did stand in our grave.

He said something to the purpose, which said that life was smoke or the
shadow of smoke, or the dream of the shadow of smoke, but I say of him, as
one said of another, in another case, non dixit vt est, dixit vt potnit, he
made life as short as he could, no^ so short as he should: he shot nearer
the mark who being deman^ed what life was, made an answer answereles, for he
presently turned his back and went his way, and indeed we fetch but here a
turn, and God says Ps. 90. 3.
return again, our mortal life is but a living death, the ^a^th receives us
like a kind mother into her entralls, when we have a while trodden her under
foot, and all our time in respect of eternity is shorter then the time
between the drinking of the ^emlocke and death of him that drinks it, mine
Ps. 39. 5.
age is even as nothing in comparison of thee (says the Prophet) and every man
living is altogether vanity.

First therefore affect not a kind of eternity here upon earth; old men as
they are children for simplicity, so would they be for years. Lysicrates in
his old age dyed his white hairs black, that he might s^e^e young still: The
Number. 32. 5.
children of Ruben and Gad, having much cattle, requested Moses leading the
people toward the land of promise, that they might be left in the land of
Gilead, and not go over Jorden, so carnal men having many beastly affections,
and worldly men whose portion is in this life; say as Peter when Christ was
transfigured Mat. 17. 4
it is good to be here, and therefore with the Gadits, Number. 23.
go to building, and make their prison as strong as they can, but when they
have done what may be done, yet within a few days, like the spider and her
web, wherein she thought to have lodged as in her freehold, they shall be
swept away, their days shall soon suffer eclipse, the night will come when
their candle shall be put out, and they shall go to their long home, though
many times against their will, Ge^ 19. 26.
as Lots wife went out of Sodom, as Luc. 16. 3.
the unjust Steward went out of his office; though with the Crabbe they go
backward from death, and are pulled from life with more violence 1 K^. 2. 28
then Ioab from the horns of the Altar.

Secondly, have this life in contempt even for this that it lasts not; Mat.
20. 6
Here we may not stand still, here we can not rest, Re. 14. 13
that is reserved to another life, 1 Pet. 2. 11
here we are pilgrims and strangers, and therefore not in our Country to rest
our selves, but in our journey to walk our selves; if we feel any pleasure,
it is soon dashed with some mishappe, and like a calm continues not long
without a storm, nay our sweet is tempered with sour, and we find a mixture
of both; but say that our life were a Paradise, our joys exquisite, and our
pleasures without composition, yet how can we sing our songs in a strange
land? how can this but cool our delight, and make us less esteem it, to
consider our life is short, our delight vanish, and though we spend our time in
pleasure, yet suddenly we go down to the grave.

Thirdly, we have here no abiding place, therefore seek the place where we
shall have Heb 9. 15
a perpetuity, rather then this from whence we must shortly go of necessity,
respect that where we shall have an everlasting habitation, rather then this,
where like freshmen, we have but as it were a year of probation. In purchasing
you regard not so much three lives as the fee simple, not so much a lease
determinable by years, as land which go to you and your heirs for ever, then
set not so much by this life, which shall vanish away like a scrolle, as by
that where you shall receive the charter of an everlasting being, not so much
by this day in which the sun sets, as by that day which knows no
euentide, nor has any sun going down, where thou shall have no more Sun
to shine e Esa. 60. 19 20.
by day, nor Moon by night, where the Lord shall be thine everlasting light,
and thy God, thy glory.

Thy days. The day to come 1 Pet. 3. 10
is the day of the Lord, but the days present h are our days: A man reckones
of that g Ps. 90. 12
which is his own, though it be but of small value, and he of great ability,
Naball a man of great possessions and exceeding mighty, yet reckones of his
bread and other small commodities, 1 Samuel 25. 2. 11.
Shall I take my bread, and my water, and my flesh, and give unto men whom I
know not whence they be? but if it be dainty then we set the more by it, as
the poor man did by that 2 Sa. 12. 3.
one little sheep which he had bought in Nathans parable, but if further, we
can never recover it, if once it be gone from us, then how great is our grief
to leave it or loose it. Now time is ours, Luc. 19. 42.
this day and nihil nostrum nisi tempus, nothing so properly ours as is time,
it is also rare and dainty, for whereas of other things a man may have Job i.
2. 3
many at one time, he can have but one time at once, and if this be once past,
behind e Ec. ^. 5. 6. 7.
there is no holdfast to pull it back again: The Sun and the wind and the
rivers, all these three return to their places: In the three parables, Luc.
15. 6 9. 31.
the man does find his lost sheep, the woman her lost groate, the father his
lost son, but loss of time comes never again, but is like a bird let fly
at large out of the hand, or a word, which babled out cannot be recalled: If
we have but a short time to enjoy any thing, we take all the benefit we can
reap in that time, as if a lease be shortly out of date, we rip up the
grounds, eat up the grass, cut down the copses, and take all the liberty the
lease will afford. Certain hawks in colder countries are most eager and
earnest to take their prey, when the day light there is of least continuance,
even Re. 12. 1^
the devil him self is most busy, because he has but a short time. Now time
is ours, and it is but a short time we have, he that is young may think he is
old enough to die, he that is stricken in years sees his set period before
him, and may think himself too old to live longer, the palm tree is full of
blomes, the map of age is figured on his forehead, the calenders of death
appear in the furrows of his face, the grave does call him saying, it is high
time to depart this life, to come away and dwell in it, and therefore take the
benefit of this ^ho^t time, Ier. 4. 4.

list, but spend them and end them in God.

In the land which the Lord thy God gives thee: Long life is a blessing, which
God gives to obedient children, but have thou but one blessing my father? Yes
surely thou blessest when thou have blessed, and therefore thou give Israel a
fuitfull land also, the land of Canaan Ex. 3. 17.
a land that flows with milk and hon^, so that thou have Genesis 27. 3^.
blessed Jacob, and therefore he shall be blessed: Ephesians. 2. ^.
thou art rich in mercy: mercy, there is the compassion of thy nature: rich,
there is the abundance, Luc. 8. 1^
thou give after thou have given, as a spring runs after it has run:
Ps. 100. 5
thy mercy is everlasting, and thy goodness is without conclusion: Frst thou
give breath that thy days may be long, then thou give bread in the land
which the Lord thy God gives thee, here is a blessing upon a blessing, as
though one of thy mercyes did bind thee to give another, as though former
benefits, were an earnest lay de to assure us of those which are to come, as
though thou would show what thou will do by what thou have done: The Oil
cease not as long as there are b 2. Kin. 4. 6
vessels to receive it, and thy mercy lasts as long as there is a true
concurrence, as long as there is no let in us to hinder the apprehension: O
Lord make our praise and thanks answereable to thy goodness, that as thy
goodness is without end, so there may be no period to our praise, but that we
may still say, Ps 41. 13.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel world without end. So be it, even so be it.

Gives: not that the Israelits should have this land in present possession,
for they did not enter upon it till the days of Joshua, in whose time God cast
out other nations and planted them in, but he speaks in the present tense for
the certainty, of performance: God forgiues us our debts and when we sue out
our pardon, Romans 8. 33.
he acquits us by proclamation, and crosses our accounts here, that hereafter
we may have our Quietus est: and he is as true a debtor to pay, as he is
merciful creditor to forgive, and does reckon that his promise does as much
indebt him to us, as men's love or desert do indebt us to them; first therefore
O Israel here is a land made over unto thee, and the grant is good, for that it
comes from the right Landlord, the Lord: and it is gracious for that it
comes not from a stranger but from thy God: the Lord is thy God, and
therefore thou shall have it cum gratia et priuilegio, 1o. cum gratia thou
shall not purchase it, or pay a fine or rent for it, but it shall be passed over
to thee by a deed of gift, thy God gives. 2o. thou shall have it cum
priuilegio, there shall be no joint tenants or copartners to hold it with thee,
but thou shall have it solely and wholly to thy self. The Lord, misdoubt not
thy state: thy God look to have it with all favor: gives: doubt not of thy
freedom: the^: fear not any that now keep the possession.

The Lord thy God gives: The devils mouth does run over, when showing Christ
all the Kingdoms of the world he says, Luc. 4. 6.
All these are mine and to whom soever I will I give the power and glory of
them: if thou therefore wilt worship ^e, they shall be all thine: for, first
for his claim he is like the frantic man, who standing on the sea shore,
thought all the ships that passed by to be his own, or he does but dream he
has them, like him, who sleeping thought he held in his hands two staves, and
waking did think verily they should be two crocier staves; and therefore
presently prepared himself, took horse and posted for two Bishoprics, not
doubting but he should be presently installed, but his horse casting him,
himself turned to be criple, and his crociers to be critches: God is the Lord
of all by right, the devil but by usurpation: the Scripture styles him f
prince of darkness, he shows himself like the Poet Accius, who being but a
dwarf, made himself an image as if he had been one of the sons of Anac:
indeed he may Job. 1. 7.
compass the earth too and fro and walk in it, Ps. 24. 1.
but the earth is the Lords and all that therein is, the compass of the round
world, and they that dwell therein. Secondly for his gift, howsoever like the
Persians he may boast of golden mountains, yet there never comes so much as a
mouse forth, he is like that man, who bequeathed great Legacyes though himself
were as poor as Job, did inherit the wind and tasted the smart of bitter
want: it is God, the father, Son and Holy Ghost, who are the fountain, the
conduit and cisterne of all that we have, and therefore Saint Paul says, Romans
11. 36.
of him, thorough him and for him are all things. The Lord gives: we hold that
we have in Capite: Genesis 41. 56.
no corn in Egypt in time of famine but comes from Joseph: Genesis 2. 8.
Adam was brought into Paradise not made in Paradise, and still man comes more
naked e Job 121.
into the world, then Genesis 32. 10.
Jacob did to Laban, when he brought but his staff with him; and therefore we
must not steal the benefits we have from the goodness of God, to father them on
fortune, on Nature, on our own wit and industrey, upon some sained God, as the
heathen did upon Mars, if in war they had the upper hand, upon Minerua if
they had wisdom, upon Mercury, if their business had speedy dispatch, for 1.
Cor. 12 11.
all these works on and the self same spirit, but we must give God his due
glory, in stripping our selves naked, and making an Inuentory of all that we
have, we must make so many Items of receipt as they are blessings bestowed upon
us.

Gives: from above comes all that we have for the matter, and it comes as
a gift for the manner: Ps. 44. 3.
The Israelites gat not the land in possession thorough their own sword,
neither was it their own arm that helped them, but thy right hand, O God, and
thine arm and the light of thy countenance, because thou had a favor unto
them.

First therefore lift not up thine horn on high, and speak not with a stiff
neck, be not the more puffed up with pride, for that thou have greater
endowments and possessions then other, for 1. Cor. 4. 7.
what have thou that thou have not received, if thou have received it, why
reioycest thou as though thou had not received it? it is a Nabals speech, my
bread, my water, my flesh, for who has ought that is not Gods, 1. Sam. 25 11.
bonatua be donasua? We say indeed, our Mat. 6. 11
daily bread, but lest it should be thought to be pulled down by weight of
merit not powered down by gift of grace we say, give us, and therefore Job in
the Catalogue of his virtues rehearses this among the rest, he did Job. 31: 25.
not rejoice when his substance was great, nor beheld the Sun when it shined,
or the Moon walking in her brightness, he knew he was but a weather sheep,
upon whom the shepherd had bestowed a Bell more then upon the rest of the
flock, and therefore he would not cast his nose into the wind, and carry his
crest the higher for any outward prosperity that he did enjoy.

Secondly that thou have is given thee, therefore dispose of it to the good of
thy neighbor, be like the Moon which leteth her light shine unto the world,
which is given by the ouershining of the Sun upon her. It is written of
Alexander Bishop of Lincolne^

Quod nondum dederit, nondum secredit habere, He thought he had it not
himself, if another were not the better for it, neither think that thine own
state will be empayred by relieuing other, for it is written, 2. Cor. 9. 9
he has sparsed a, broad and given to the poor: ^^^ (...) remains for ever,
that is, he shall have to give of continuance, the flowers hurt not their own
fruit, though they yield honey to the painful Be; The Sun loses not it
light, though it lends light unto the Moon, nor he in conclusion hurts his
estate, whose hand is not to close for others need, nor to open for his own,
Lu. 6. 38
give there is a precept, and it shall be given you, there it is backed with a
promise or give, there we are bound, and it shall be given you, there is a
counter-band to save us harmeles: God gives us a bill of his hand, or enters
into band, and becomes surety that we shall be paid with advantage.

Thirdly that which thou have is given, therefore give thanks, if God withdraw
the light of his countenance it is for our trial, if he lets it to shine
upon us it is to cause a reflection of thanks: A dutiful tenant that thinks
to hold his living or buy a further estate, will pay his rent, and sometime
bring his Lord a present; we are tenants to God, and if we will hold that we
have, we must do him service and homage, we must pay him yearly our hourly
rent, gratiarum actio est in^itatio ad plus dandum, this praise may cause him
to open his hand, and fill us with blessings* be therefore like the solid body
which has a reflexe of heat, where the Sun does extend the beams of light,
and though we have even iron hearts, yet let his graces like an Adamant draw
them unto him, draw duti^ from us.

Lastly that which thou have is given, therefore be patient, if God impouerish
thee when thou art rich, abate thee if thou have much, and pull thee down if
thou art aloft. Job. 1. 21.
Job imputed no unreasonable dealing unto God, though he bereaved him in a
minute of all that he had in his life, but is content that God should dispose
of that which he had put into his hands: we hold that we have of God not in
feesimple, that he should pretend no more title to them, for though he puts us
in possession, he puts not himself out of possession, he is Lord royal still
and true owner of all, he is the maker of all, this word maker imports, he
has made all things in such sort, that it is meet all power and sovereign
Dominion should remain to himself, we are tenants advol^ntate^ d^mini, Copy
holders at the will of the Lord, grudge we not therefore if God visit our
estates, but go lightly away with an easy burden.

The land which the Lord thy God gives thee: When Abraham b Genesis 12.
the father of the faithful, first set foot in the land of Canaan, he had not
in it the breadth of a foot, but within a while, such was his humble and
gentle carriage, he got the favor of the Hittites, Genesis 23. ^6. ^0.
bought a field and possession of Ephron, and all the people confirmed the
sale: after that not a field, but a whole country not by purchase but by gift
Ios. 14. and 15.
was allotted to the sons of Abraham, and distributed among the Tribes: Ps.
115. 16
the earth God has given to the children of men, Ps. 105. 1
but this pleasant and plentiful part of the earth did he give unto Israel, as
a particular enclosure out of the commons of the whole world, and therefore it
is compared Esa. 20. 6
to an I Will, because Israel was separated from other countries, as an I Will from
other lands: and as Genesis 43. 34.
Benjamin had his mease by himself, so (according Number. 23. 9.
to Balaams prophecy) the people did dwell by themselves, and were not reckoned
among the nations: Jerusalem was walled about, and Ioh* 4. 9.
the Jews did not meddle with the Samaritans: but after (according to the Zac.
2. 4.
prophecy of Zachary) Ephesians. 2. 14
the partition wall was broken down, and the Church of Christ dispersed far
and nigh, Gal. 6. 16
is called, the Israel of God, which shall enter into his rest, and Mat. 8. 11
sit down with Abraham Isaac and Jacob, in the Kingdom of heaven: whereof
this land of Canaan was a type and figure, whether he bring us that made us,
for his Son Jesus Christ his sake, to whom with the Father and the holy
Ghost, be given all honor and glory for ever.

The sixth Commandment.
Exodus 20. 13. Thou shall not kill.
IT is true, which the father of lies says in the book of Job, Job 2. 4.
Skin for skin, and all that ever a man has will he g^^en for his l^fe.

Men's minds are shut in their chests, as dead bodies are buried in coffins,
they are interred in the G^lgatha of this world, as moles are intombed in their
hills; yet set a man never so much by his wealth, he will give his goods for the
ransom of his life* more then so, men prefer their liberty before their
riches, for say fetters be of gold, yet is the servitude no less miserable,
though it be more glorious, but to save their lives the Ios. 9. 23.
G^b^onites are content to loose their liberty, and never to be freed from
being bondmen. Since therefore life is so precious, God in this commandment
takes order for the life of man; first forbidding all cruelty, which might take
it away, then inioyning us to use the best means we may to preserve it.

The negligent Pastor, the seditious Heretic, which slay the sou^es of men,
and so destroy the life spiritual, the detracting (...), whose tongue as
sharp as the quilles of a Porcupin, wound the good name of his neighbor, and
so destroy the life civil; with bare mentioning I pass^ over, supposing that
other commandments lead me a nearer way into these fields, only the
malicious murderer, who lays wait for blood, and so destroies the life
natural, shall be the subject of my speech, for the hand of this text does
lead me to him, and therefore God assisting me, I will spend this days
exercise in this walk.

There are some sins as more heinous then other, which are said to cry unto
God for vengeance, as the sin of the Sodomites Ge^ ^8. 20.
mentioned in the Epistle to the Ro^. 1. 24.
Ro^^aines: the sin of oppressors, Ia. 5. 4*
which keep back the hire of the laborers: the sin of murder, for G^ 4.
10.
the voice of blood does cry unto God: the wounds opening and bleeding in the
presence of the murderer do after a sort cry and say, Lord how long? how long
will thou cease to be avenged? even Job 24. 12
the soul of the slain does cry out, and therefore when the servants were
slain, which were messengers sent to inuit the guests unto the wedding, God
is not said to see it, as he does this and other sins, but Mat. 22. 7
when the King heard it, he was wroth: Ge^. 4. 11.
The earth opens her mouth to receive the blood of the slain, Esa. 26. 2^
but the earth shall dis^lose her blo^d, and shall no more hide her slain, the
blood which she has drunk, she shall again cast out, that it may cry
against those, which spared not to dislodge the souls of innocents form their
harmeles bodies.

A man cannot water the earth with his brothers blood, but he wrongeth God, for
Genesis 9* 6
in the image of God did ^^e make man: he therefore that batheth his sword in
the precious life of man, razeth C^s^rs picture, and breaks in pieces the
Kings broad Seal.

The G^ 3. 17
earth was cursed for sin, but Genesis 4. 12
the first murderer did loose of that blessing which remained unto it.

Genesis 4 15
God would not have Kain slain^, not that he favored the murder, but to show
how he detested the shedding of blood, when he would not have a hand stretched
out against him, who had committed such outrage against* the person of his own
brother.

The Lord did forbid the eating of blood, Leu. 17. 13.
even the blood of the least bird, the eating of flesh Genesis 9 4.
which died of it self, or which was strangled, because the blood was in it.
Leu. 23. 28.
He would not have the damme and young killed both in one day: and though Deu.
14. 21.
strangers had a larger Patent for eating of flesh then the people of God, yet
the flesh of an Ox that had gored any man or woman to death might not be
eaten, noe not of strangers. All these prohibitions tended to this end to
teach, that we must not lay wait for blould, that we must not devour men's
souls like Lions, and tear them in pieces, that we must not be like wolves
in the evening; eating up our brethren, as if we would eat bread, nor swallow
them up quick, like a grave, even whole as those that go down into the pit.

Again the Number. 19. 11.
the Lord did command, that he which had touched the dead body of any man, as
being unclean should purify himself: the like should he do Number* 31. 19.
which had killed any person, even him or her whom to save alive had been
sin: Gen 9 7
he commands the preservation of seed, Deu. 20. 10.
and commands even in war to be mindful of pity; all these Injunctions
tended to this end, to teach us the more to detest the shedding of blood, and
to show that violence which is hurtful in all things is horrible in life.

God in all ages severely punished this finne, to show he would have no man
break the prison, and let the soul out, but he that did enclose it: before
the law was given unto Moses, God enacted this statute, Genesis 9 6
who so sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.

The Ex. 21. 12
Law was life for life: a law never repealed, for it stands in effect in the
last book of the Bible; Ap. 13. 10
if any kill with a sword, he must be killed by a sword: If a man did smite
his servant that he died under his hand, though among the Romans such a master
went free, because he bought his servant with his money, yet because the life
is more worth then money, God will not free him, Ex. 21. 20*
puniendo punietur, he shall be surely punished.

If men did strive and hurt a woman with child, though there were no intent to
kill, either the mother or the child, Ex. 21. 22.
yet if death followed, life should be paid for life.

A man would think, it had been no great matter, if he had killed a thief,
that should come and undermine his house, or break it up, but yet if this
were done in the day time, by the judicial law of Moses, Ex. 22. 2.
he that did it must dye for it.

Deu. 21. 1
If one were found slain in the field, and he not known that committed the
murder, the next City should bear the blame, should offer sacrifice, protest
before God that they were clear of that fact, desire God to be merciful to
them, and not lay innocent blood unto their charge.

If a man did not lay wait for blood, but had Ex. 21. 14.
killed any unawares, he might take Sanctuary, and fly to the Altar, but if he
had killed any wilfully, the holiness of the place should not defend him, and
therefore Solomon bids Benaiah to smite I^ab, because he smote two men more
righteous and better then he, and slew them with the sword, though 1 Kin. 2. 28
Ioab had caught hold on the horns of the Altar.

God would take vengeance on Genesis 9. 5.
beasts generally, for the life of man, particularly Ex. 21. 28
the goaring Ox that killed any should be stoned to death, to show that
beastly minded man should not go unpunished, who sheds his brothers blood like
water, who oppresses him round about for his soul, and causes his head to
go down to the grave with blood.

The laws of other Nations, as well as Gods law to the Jews, do meet with
this sin, and cutting them off from other men, rewards them to their face, to
bring them to destruction, which lift up their hands against other to destroy
them: To let pass foreign Countries, in our land if a man did run into a
praemunire, he should be put out of the Kings protection, his lands, goods, and
cattles forfaited to the King, but yet there was a law made Eliz 1o. against
such as should slay even such a man, as was attainted in praemunire. King
Richard the first, making orders for seafaring men ordained, that if one slew
an other on the shippe-boarde, he should be bound to the dead body, and thrown
into the sea, if on the land, he should be bound to him, and buried with him
quick. The land is cleansed of the blood that is shed in it, by the blood of
him that shed it, and therefore the statute law takes away all murderers like
dross walking more stubbornly, and taking greater vengeance on those, which
shall imbrue their hands in the blood of them, to whom by nature or duty they
are most bound; by nature, as if a woman since her husband and she are one
flesh, shall kill her husband, she shall be accounted a paricide by the Civil
law, and by the Statute of the land a traitor, and be punished accordingly: by
duty, as if a servant kill his master, it is petie treason, if one kill any
Judge sitting in his place, it is high treason; and such a man shall drink
more depely of the cup of vengeance, but let one s^ay a man be he never so
mean feloniously, his least punishment is suspension, his deathbed is the
gallows, say he does escape, and be not taken, then the Town where the murder
is committed, shall be amerced: say, the matter be compounded, yet God himself
will take the matter into his own hand, his vengeance by justice shall wait
his destruction that does commit it, he will even set his face against the
person, and will cut him off from among his people, for sometime he stirs up
Gen 6. 9.
some other man, to shed the blood of him, thar sheddeth blood, and therefore
Ge^. 4. 14
Cain is afraid, that every man that finds him, will slay him. That valiant
Hercules did cast Di^medes King of Thrace, who fed his horse with men's flesh,
to horses to be devoured: Perillus was enforced to make trial, how his brazen
Bull would roar, and when the Tyrant Phalaris had burned many in it, his own
Citizens falling upon him, put him into the same Bull, and made him end his
life with like kind of death.

It is remarkable how the Duke of Burgundy, dealt with a murderer, A cruel
minded man had taken a noble man prisoner, his wife whose heart did cleave unto
her husband, was an earnest suitor for his life, that no hand might be upon
him; to put him to death, the cut-throate answered; if he might go up to her
bed, embrace her bosom, take his fill of love and his pleasure in dalliance,
he would set her husband at liberty, she thought it were as death to her, to
break her faith plighted in marriage, yet so great was her love, that she did
deliberate, and first craved leave to confer with her husband, who, though this
thing were grievous unto him, because of his wife, yet gave her leave, that he
might have his deliverance, the deed done, and this varlet having lain with her
fleshly, and used her at his pleasure, he notwithstanding the next day chopped
off her husbands head, and sent it unto her, whereupon she complained to the
Duke, who sent for him, compelled him to marry her, that so she might challenge
a right in his possessions, and then causing him to drink of the same cup, cut
off his head. It is true that the Psalmist says, Ps. 5 5. 23
the bloudthirsty man shall not live out half his days, one dies fettered in
prison, another scalded in the brothel house, many in war, when the land of
the enemies does eat them, and lick them up as an Ox lieketh up grass of
the field, when their enemies chase them, as Bees use to do, so that they
cannot stand in the day of battle, but their carcasses fall to the earth and
cannot escape: thus the roaring of the Lion, the voice of the Lioness, and the
teeth of the Lions whelps are broken.

This made Rebec^ah, speaking of Esau and Jacob, to say, Genesis 27. 45.
Why should I be deprived of you both in one day? not thinking that Jacob being
of a gentle disposition would rise up against his brother Esau, and so they
kill one another, but her meaning was, that if Jacob did not avoid the
country, Esau considering that Jacob had the birthright and the blessing,
would kill him: then some judgment of God would light upon Esau for his
unnatural fact, to root him out of the land of the living: Merciful men are
taken away many times, because Heb. 11. 38.
the world c Esa. 57. 1.
is not worthy of them, but cruel and bloodthirsty men, because they are
unworthy to live in the world. But say their days are prolonged, and like
Serpents and Salamanders they live long, yet are they killed with a sword of
their own, as 1. Sam. 17. 51.
Goliath was: the remembrance of their cruel fact wounds them at the very
heart, and strikes them in a maruailous fear of Gods great vengeance to be
powered upon them: and whereas good men dwell safely, be quiet from fear of
evil, and have their delight in the multitude of peace, God sends his plagues
upon murderous men's hearts, their sin lies at the door, they know their
iniquity, and their sin is ever before them, their hearts know the bitterness
of their souls, even in laughing their hearts are sorrowful, their sin does
testify to their faces, their inventions beset them about, their casting down
is in the midst of them, affliction and anguish do make them afraid, and
prevail against them, as a King ready to battle: even the wickedest men, and
they which seem to be touched with nothing, having once slain them whom they
hated most of all other, do presently after the deed done feel heartbitings
which sting them inspight of their teeth, and hold them as it were upon the
rack, by making them feel, that God sets himself against them as an enemy.

When Mariamne Herod's wife, was unjustly made away by her husband, she seemed
every night to trouble him, and wake him out of sleep, pinching and tormenting
him in such a wrekefull sort, as he could not take his rest or ease at any time.

Theoricus unjustly slew Symmachus a noble man, but being at supper, he saw (as
he imagined) the visage of Symmachus in a fishes head, whereupon such a
trembling did come upon him, and such a fear did take hold on his flesh, that
his strength being dried up like a pot sheard, his tongue cleaving to his
jaws, his heart powered out, his soul cast down, his eyes kept waking, his
bones cut in sunder, he never after enjoyed good hour: thus does Gods justice
follow these merciles men at the hard heels, they feel their sin stirring
in them, as it were some living thing crawling in their bodies, and gnawing
upon their hearts, which make them cry out of the foulenes of their sin, and
carry torments and vexations against themselves, until their dying day.

As therefore the Pythagorians went too much on the one hand, exceeding into
too much pity, when they thought no living creature might be eaten, and the
Manichees, who going further then thus, would eat no eggs, imagining that
when they be broken, their life or soul passes from them, and more then so,
would not allow the cutting of herbs or trees, or plucking ought from them,
for that having life and feeling, as they thought, they did by this means
suffer grief pain and smart: so they go too much on the other hand, which
will not suffer the twist of man's life to twine out, but cut it off before the
clue be ended, herein the chief offenders (because every man is nearest to
himself) are they, which but cher themselves, who will not abide in the
station, in which God has placed them, till he call them back again, but
send the soul from the sentinel, wherein she is placed in this body, without
the leave of her Captain, whose calamities cause them to leave life, and
cowardly run away, who suffer shipwreck by taking a shorter cut to their
iourneys end: these are worse then beasts, who sometimes goare one another, but
never rage against themselves; such a one was Judas, who, when the betraying of
the innocent blood lay heavy upon his heart, chose rather to adventure upon the
future pains he feared, then endure the present horror he felt, Mat. 27. 5
and therefore like a fish he leapt out of the pan into the flame. The funeral
of the covetous man is many times wilful, for in the extremity of his covetous
folly, he dispatcheth himself when corn is cheap, he hangs up himself for
the fall of the market.

Laws have provided death for Thieves, for Traitors, and other notable
malefactors, but sometime they can find little opportunity of execution, for
these lewd persons prevent the time, sometime by piece, sometime by poison,
sometime by dagge, sometime by dagger: sometime they make a cutlers shop of
their own bellyes, sometime they choke themselves with a little neck-weede,
one way or other, they desperately sunder their souls from their bodies, and
conclude their own shameful confusion.

There are other, who though they are not guilty of their own death, by laying
violent hands upon themselves, yet by other unlawful means they cast
themselves out of the world, and hasten forward their own days. The glutton
digs his own grave with his teeth, for life is a lamp, excess in meat does
shorten the one, as too much oil does extinguish the other: Intemperate
gulliguts turning that into occasion of death, which was given for preservation
of life, never live long, never live well, plures periere crapula quam gladi^:
Cooks have provided as bad weapons as Cutlers, for all turns to bad humor,
that transcends the due proportion of nourishment. Epicures are as desperate as
soldiers, and meat kills as many as the musket, the glutton therefore as he is
hateful to God, loathsome to man, so is he hurtful to himself in hastening
his own death.

Again the drunkard lays himself in his grave before he be dead, and is as
stinking carrion more then half rotten above the ground: The cup killes as
many as the Canon, and therefore challenging professors drink themselves out
of health, while they drink to the health of their friends.

Vna salus sanis nullam potare salutem:
Non est in pota vera salute salu^.
Unlawful desires do wast the strength of adulterers, as the flame consumes
the tallow: they themselves, like candleflies, venture so near the fire that
they burn themselves, their harlots like horse leaches suck out their best
blood, even their heart blood: howsoever their sin delights, yet nothing
sooner at an end in it self, nothing sooner makes an end of them, and
sticking by them when all their friends forsake them, causes a short life and
most shameful death.

Lastly the envious man does murder himself, for being as sorry for another
man's prosperity, as his own adversity, he lets go the bridle to his cursed
affection, which like a fretting canker does Pro. 14. 30.
eat up his body, dry up his blood, and rotteth his bones: This man is not
like the maid whom Auicen speaks of, who feeding and nourshiing her self
with poison, was her self healthy, yet infected other with her venomous
breath, but like the serpent Porhpyrius, which is full of poison, but wanting
teeth hurts none but himself, like the little flies, who while they would put
out the candle, burn themselves, they burn themselves with the fire of their
own heart as Aetna consumed it self, and Leu. 10. 1
as Nadab and Abih^ were consumed with the fire of their own censors: Malitia
procedit ex te (says Saint Augustine) et quem prius vastat nisi te? quo
profundit ramum ledit, vbi radicem habet non ledit? Equidem dico, quod malitia
tua, vt alteri non noceat, fieri potest, vt autem tibi non noceat, fieri non
potest: the effect is this, ^malice drinks the most part of it own venom:
The snake in the Apologue licked off her own tongue, when thinking nothing
should have teeth but her self, she would have licked the file plain which
she found with teeth at the smiths forge: Act. 2. 38
The viper, which leapt upon Paul's hand with an intent to hurt him, fell her
self into the fire and perished: Saint Paul therefore bringing in these sins
by the brace, Romans 13. 12. 13.
gluttony and drunkenness, Chambering and wantonness, strife and envying wishes
us to cast them all away calling them works of darkness, both because they
proceed from the Prince of darkness, and also lead the way to utter darkness,
where is weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Others though they seek not their own death or wilfully hinder their own
health, yet other men's blood they shed like water, and will not spare their
souls from death bur take them away: either secretly: thus did David make the
sword approach to Vriah, 2. Sam. 11 15.
in causing him to be set in the forefront of the battle, that he might abide
the first encounter and violence of the enemy, that the enemy might persecute
his soul and take it, and tread his life down upon the earth: thus did 1.
Kin. 21. 10. 11.
Iezabell compass Naboth round about to take away his soul, for thorough her
means the men of the City laid to his charge things that he knew not, and
suborned witnesses, brought him within compass of treason: some openly water
the earth with blood, and their hands are upon their brethren to put them to
death, and as among civil men, it is but a word and a writ, so among
swaggering cauilleirs, it is but a word and a wound. A sin so much against
nature, that I would forbear further speech of it, were it not that their are
some which stand for the bloody use of single combats, either to determine a
public war, or to make trial of a private right: First say they, war is
vtrimque triste, even victory many times is like a golden fishhooke, which lost
or broken cannot be paid for with that it takes, therefore 2. Kin. 14. 8
Amaziah King of Judah sends to Iehoash King of Israel, saying, come let us see
one another in the face: as if he should say let common bloodshed be prevented,
let one sword not many try the matter, why should we destroy one another
Cities, let thou and I ( 1. Sam. 17 41.
like David and Goliath) fight hand to hand, better one man perish then many
people suffer, but Iehoash returned him a scornful answer, comparing
himself to a Cedar in Lebanon, and Amaziah to a thistle, which the wild
beasts in Lebanon trodde under foot: and in very deed why should one
Champions neck and shoulders bear all the heads of a common wealth? say he
does vanquish, yet what boldness is it to hazard her? say he be vanquished, what
bold wrong does he to lose her? never therefore cast upon two hands the
trial of a just war, which does concern a whole State.

Again what is the valor of the man to the right of his cause, whether it be
to title of inheritance, when the matter is doubtful and demurred, or the
righting of his name, when it is traduced, indeed the positive laws of diverse
nations allowed this kind of trial, when the truth was not known: but is
therefore the title good, because the man is more valiant and skillful? When
Robert Bishop of Sarisbury in the reign of Edward the 3. sued William de
Montacute, Earl of Sarisbury for the Castle of old Sarum, or as some say,
Sherburne, the Earl answered, that he would defend his right by a Combat,
whereupon at a day appointed the Bishop brought forth his Champion to the
bars, clothed in a white garment, down to the midst of the leg, and upon
it he had a soldiers cloak, in which were drawn out the Bishops arms, him
followed a soldier bearing a staff, and a youth with a Tergat, forthwith the
Earl brought his Champion forth by the hand, clad in like manner, him followed
two soldiers bearing white stau^s, when now these 2. Champions were ready to
enter the listes, they were bid to stand back and stay till men did measure
their weapons, while this was in doing suddenly came the Kings letters
commanding them to differ the matter till another time, while this pause was
made, the matter was compounded and the Earl contented upon the receipt of
2500 marks, to depart with his right in the Castle to the Bishop and his
successors for ever, but say the combat had been fought, might not he, who had
had the right been kept short at the staves end, and might not the hand of him
that had offered wrong have been in the neck of his adversary: Neither was
Richard the usurper a more lawful King, because his Champion after his
challenge triumphed with his cup of gold.

Again another says I am falsely accused, and now by a Duel I will prove my
self innocent: In the 6. year of Richard the 2. Sir John Ausly Knight
defendant held a battle with one Garcon Appellant, wherein the Knight having
the upper hand forced his enemy to yield unto him: whereupon Garco^ was
presently drawn to the place of execution, and there hanged for his false
accusation: but is this a good consequent: the Knight did smite his enemy, get
the mastery, had his lust satisfied upon his accuser, therefore he was wronged,
and clear of the fact whereof he was accused. On the other side, in the 24.
year of Henry the 6. an Armourers Servant of London appeached his Master of
treason, who offered to be tried by battle: Smithfield was the place
appointed for the fight, in which the Servant did overcome the Master,
whereupon as sufficiently proved guilty, his body was drawn to Tyburne and
there hanged and beheaded: might not here the Servant though he were guilty
insult in the conquest, and the Master, though he were guiltles lie bleeding in
the combat, especially since his friends (as the Cronicle reports) brought
him so much Malmesey and Aqua-vitae before the fight to comfort him, that both
wit and strength were taken from him.

Stultus ab euentu, facta notanda putat. This kind of trial is like the
searching out of the truth by lots, lots might and may be used for dividing
several men's right, so I^shua, divided the land of Canaan among the Tribes
Ios. 14. 2
by lot; or for appointing officers, as they Act. 1. 26.
chose an Apostle by lot to succeed in Judas place, but to use them to the
finding out of any secret thing, except it be by the commandment of God, who
this way would Ios. 7. 18.
have Acha^s theft found out, is but mere foolery, and a great tempting of
God. For though God Ion. 1. 7.
in the prophecy of Jonah did order the lots, which the Mariners cast, in such
sort that they found out the party, for whose cause evil was upon them, which
was done both that Jonas might be brought forth who fled from the presence of
God, and that the Mariners moved by this example might give off their
superstition, yet what certainty is there in lots and what building upon them,
when we see that Est. 3. 7.
Haman (who cast a lot from day to day, from month to month beginning at the
first unto the last to find out which might be the luckyest days to root out
the Jews) found them to be most Est. 9. 1. etc.
doleful days to him and his, which by lot were persuaded to be most
fortunate: and on the contrary side, the same days so joyful to the Jews,
that they might say, these are the days which the Lord has made, we will
r^ioyce and be glad in them, and therefore they kept the very same days
festival, they and their seed through many generations: and indeed a man can
no sooner find out any thing unknown by lot, by combat, then he can Judge of
soundes by taste, and therefore those Countries, which in the times of uncivil
ignorance tolerated a trial by battle, do now dislike it, and therefore
have repealed those laws which did allow it, even at this day the barbarous
Turks burn single combattants in the side with hot coals of fire: I will
not here spend time to answer those, which think it a stain to their credit,
and a disgrace to their name, if they shall not answer those, which have sent
them the length of their swords, and from whom they have received proud
challenges: only this I say, men of great valor have rejected challenges,
which have proceeded from them, who have had more heart then brain, more head
then wit, without any blemish to their reputation: but say that some will count
thee a coward, yet non quid alij, sed quid tu de te: fear not so much shame as
sin, love good name, but yet as an hand-maide of virtue, woe and court common
fame no further then it follows upon honest courses, and think thy self but
base, if thou should depend on vulgar breath: never hazard thy life for thy
name, never kill an other man to be accounted a gallant man of thy hands; this
name shall not so much delight thee, as thy conscience shall gall thee, memory
afflict thee, repentance vex thee, perplexity torment thee, when the deed done
thou shall see thy self cited before Gods judgment seat every hour, when
thy heart knowing the bitterness of thy soul shall tell thee, that thou have
neglected thy soul, endangered thy body, hurt thy children, brought a blemish
to thy posterity, which in the next generation shall not be put out.

Indeed we read of spiritual Duels, for in the Mat. 4. 3.
Scriptures we have the Prince of peace, and Prince of this world combating a 1 Samuel 1^ 41.
together, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah is encountered (as David with the
Giant) by the roaring Lion that seeks to devour us.

Again we have the Mat. 15. 22.
Cananitish woman wrestling with Christ, as Genesis 32. 24.
Jacob with the Angel, and fastening upon him with her prayers, as the
Shunamite upon Elisha with her d 2 Kin. 4. 27
hands. In the first Christ did vanquish, and make the devil avoid by casting
in his face scriptum est. In the second he is overcome, for with excellent
wrestlings, the Cananite wresled with Christ, and got the vpperhand: every good
Christian must fight those fights; and therefore for the first, the Church of
God is called Militant: In Baptism we receive our pressed money, and in the Ephesians.
6. 11
Ephesians there is a proclamation ad arma: neither does a crown remain to
any at the last, but to such as first can say with Paul, 2 Timothy 4. 7
I have fought a good fight, he is lured to the crown, that is allured to the
combat: and therefore the holy Ghost setting out the complete armor of a
Christian, does not mention a back Curete, c to show he should never fly and
turn his back upon his enemy, but be like Androclid, whom, when a soldier
did deride him, because being lame, he went unto the war, answered merrily,
he came to fight, and not to run away.

For the second we must wrestle and combat with God by our prayers, and not
leave till we overcome him, who is invincible: if we want any thing, leave him
not, our importun^ty cannot be too great, our impatience cannot offend his
patience, beat upon him still like the Mat. 15. 23. 24.
Cananite, who stands to it though she had many repulses, though Christ first
neglects her, then denies her, then reprocheth her: be like the a widow, Luc.
18. 5
who will not leave the unjust Judge, though at first he lend her but a dease
ear: be like the blindman, who made the Sun of righteousness, ( Ios. 10. 13
which stayed that Sun in the days of Joshua which rejoices as a Giant to run
his course) Lu. 18. 40
to stand still, till his sight was restored: If we endure punishment his anger
is a spear, leave him not, till our prayers break it in pieces, his judgment
is a sword, leave him not till we make him put up his sword into his sheath:
prayers have power with God, and are of such force, that when he intends to
punish a nation, Ier. 11. 14
he forbids his Prophets to pray, lest he should alter his mind and so be
overcome: these are the combats commanded, commended by God: as for other duels
under what habit soever they may be shrouded, and what glass soever may be set
upon them, if their vizors be taken off: they will appear to be flat against
this statute, not that a man in defense of himself, when he can give no
further ground, may with an unwilling willingness smite with the sword, for now
necessity does bind him to strike, and he seeks not so much an others death, as
the safegarde of his own life.

Neither does this Commandment shorten the Magistrates arm, for Romans 13. 4
he bears not the sword inuaine, and when Ioh. 18. 11
private men must put up their swords into their sheathes, he must un sheath
his sword, as the dreadful instrument of divine revenge, and hating merciful
injustice must throw pity over bar, in this respect more willing to be
reputed a busy Justice then quiet Gentleman: to restrain Justice is to
support si^ne, and not to correct is to consent to the crime: nay he he is so
far from breaking this Commandment by drawing out his sword, that he is
guilty of the breach of it, if he draw it not, neither is it so great a fault
to kill a Lamb out of the flock, as to let a wolf go free, Qui parcit Lupo
macta^ greg^m, he that forgiues the bad, does wrong the good.

Hemingius makes mention of a fellon, who was indicted of seven murders* while
the Judge was studying what grievous punishment should be inflicted upon such a
bloody vil^aine; an Advocate steps to the bar, and pleading for him, proved
that the Judge was guilty of six of the murders, for that the fellon was not
put to death for his first offense: therefore let not Judges, which are
appointed of God to prosecute the wicked with the sword, drawn for favor
keep it clean from blood, let it neither surfeit of blood through cruelty, nor
yet rust for want of use through partiality; let them be as ready to execute a
rebel, as defend an innocent, let them cut off those limbs, which lack blood
and life, and hurt other parts of the body, let them root out the wicked, lest
the harvest of weedy nature be over plenteous, when they sit at the bench: let
every one of them lay aside the personage of a friend, if their nearest kindred,
their greatest acquaintance come under trial, let them say, I know you not,
especially let them not pardon such as offend often, lest they fall to further
boldness, and sins unpunished become exemplary.

Neither is this Commandment a Bar to lawful war, for when men are ripe
or rather rotten in sin, so that the stinch of their iniquity ascends up
unto heaven: God sends many times a foreign power as a vultur to prey upon
such carrions, and says, Ez. 14. 17.
sword, go through the land.

The Lord will hiss, Esa. 7. 18
for the flies of Egypt, and for the Be^^ of Assiria to destroy Israel: and it
is a judgment, Esa. 3. 2.
when God does take away the man of war, and Captain of fifty, and yet Esa.
9. 5:
every battle of the warrior is with noise, and with tumbling of garments in
blond: and therefore when the war is just, and Gods cause is in hand, be
pressed and ready to come forth to help the Lord, to help the Lord against the
mighty, break the arm of the wicked, break their horns, break their bars,
destroy all their munitions, as Hos. 10. 14.
Shalman destroyed Arbel in the day of battle; let the horsemen lift up both
the bright sword and glistering spear, let the footmen bend their bows, and
make ready their arrows upon the string, let them press forward with their
boy strous bills and peircing pikes: let not Gilead abide beyond Jordan, nor
Dan remain in ships, nor Asher sit on the Sea shore, let the people offer
themselves willingly, let them all come as a whirle-winde to scatter Gods
enemies, and cry down with them, down with them, even to the ground: this may
they do any thing in this Commaudement notwithstanding it.

Thou shall not kill: Men's laws extend but to the outward man, condemning
him only as guilty of murder, who pollutes and defiles his hands in an others
blood: The Pharisees and best expounders of the law, did but bite about the
bark of this law, not enter into the marrow of it, but the law is spiritual
(...) AND (...) are of great affinity, and therefore our Savior Christ tells
us, that this Commandment does bind the heart and the tongue, as well as the
hands to the good abearing, the heart condemning him of the breach of it, who
is angry with his brother. Anger is a malicious desire of revenge, and will
exercise the arms of the strong, and tongues of the weak; it is a sin that
lies grinding in the entralles, and persuading reason to dissemble and the
party wronged to be avenged, and if it sinde no vent the heart will cleave
asunder, as the waters undermine when they cannot ouerflow: the angry and
malicions man (for anger and malice differ but in time, and as old new wine)
cannot ^igest nor cast up the least displeasure, but will be violent in
pursuit of small indignities, and use what means he can to put in practice
that which desire of revenge does put into his head: A sin directly against
God, for he that reuengeth, steps into Gods chair of estate, and takes the
sword out of his hand, who says, Romans 12 19.
vengeance is mine. A sin against a man's own self, not only for loss of
patience, but for that the remembrance or requital of a wrong does many times
hurt as much as the receipt of it: how many have been seen to lie dead,
because they would not take the Lie? how many had their blood seen, because
they would not have their backs seen? The Be might keep her stinge still,
and not live a drone, did she not in her anger employ it to enuenome the flesh
of him that puts her from him, it is safer to forget an injury or smother it,
then go about to avenge, it every revenge gives occasion of new cruelties,
and therefore one says, if thine enemy be little, let him alone, and thou
do him a favor, but if he be great, let him alone, and thou do favor
thy self: it is good counsel therefore which the Holy Ghost gives, Romans 12.
19.
give place to wrath.

Dum furor in cursu est, currenti cede furori, Neither look so much on him
that does thee wrong, as on God who suffers him, and raises up an enemy as a
scourge to chastise thy faults, and know that if any wrong can conquer thee,
thou have not conquered thy self. Again this Commandment ties up the tongue,
so that reproachful and contumelious words go not out at the doors of our
lips, as Mat. 5. 22
Racha thou fool, or like words of disgrace, which chollericke men shoot
forth, when anger has inflamed their hearts, and made their mouths hotter
then Dan. 3. 19
Nabucadnezzars Oven, when it is made seven times hotter then it is wont; not
but that a man may be angry when Gods cause is in hand, with advised speech and
in a seasonable time, as was Ex. 32. 19
Moses, Nu. 25. 8.
Phinehes and Ioh. 2. 15
Christ himself, impatience in Gods injuries is as commendable, as patience is
laudable in our own wrongs, and they whose blood does not rise when they hear
God rent and torn in pieces with carrion and stinking mouths, are as much to
blame as they, who prodigal of their blood, do point the field to revenge a
disgraceful word against themselves, nor yet but that a man may utter some
contumelious word, so it be by way of advice to direct or correct, for Paul
Gal. 3. 1.
called the Galathians fools Luc. 13. 32.
Christ, Herod a fox, even let thy friends see, that thou love them by thy
approbation, and that thou love not their faults by such sharp reproves;
otherwise that curse will light upon thee, which did upon the in habitants of
Meroz, which came not forth Iud. 5. 23.
to help the Lord, to help the Lord against the mighty: always see that
sharp words which proceed of some heat come not of any hate, except it be of
the sin thou see committed.

Michaell the Archangell, when he said unto Satan, Iud 9.
the Lord rebuke thee, would teach us not to avenge our selves by evil
speaking, but refer the matter to God: when it was told Aristotle, that one
rayled on him behind his back, when I am away (says he) let him beat me
too. When one asked Octauian the Emperor, why doing good to all men, he
suffered some to murmur against him, he answered, he that has made Rome free
from enemies, has also set at liberty the tongues of malicious men. The
answer of Beza to a Spanish Jesuit is worth the observation, worthy the
imitation, the Jesuit, says he, disputing about the Eucharist called us (this
is in an Epistle which he writes to Calvin) vulpes, et serpents, et simias,
Foxes and Serpents and Apes: my answer was this, non magis nos credere quam
transubstantiationem, we did no more believe this, then we did
transubstantiation: this man was made of a mettle more flexible then hard, his
shoulders were broad enough to bear the foul words were offered unto him, he
was like the waters of Siloe, at the foot of Sion Esa. 8 6.
which run softly, he made but small noise though he heard great words, whose
example may teach us not to be so light as to be moved with the breath of man's
mouth so shall we be above Nature, while we seem below ourselves.

Lastly as this Commandment ties up the tongue, that it burst not forth into
words, before a conceiving spirit has delivered them, that it be not like
Gunpowder, which touched with the least spark will instantly be in the face,
so it sets a watch before the eyes, that they do not sparkle with rage, that
the brows be not bent, as if anger had there plowed the furrows of her wrath,
it keeps our countenance that we do not swell like toades, when they be
touched, it binds other members of the body from all froward disposition
whatsoever: if our blood boy leth at the heart, as brimstone at the match, if
our perturbations boil our hearts into brine, and eat the moisture out of our
flesh, if Genesis 4. 6.
Cains countenance be cast down, that he does lowerlooke his brother Abel, if
they Mat. 27. 30. 39.
spit upon Christ, bow their knees, and do him reverence, if they who go by
at his passion wagge their heads, if the Jews A^.* 7. 5^.
gnash upon Steven with their teeth: if the tyrant that martyred Saint Laurence
stamp and stare, rampe and fare as one out of his wits, if his eyes glow, his
teeth grind like an hell-hound, his mouth foome like a boar, if any, naso
suspendit, as it is in the proverb, or medium ostendit digitum which Marciall
calls impudicum. These and every one of these, though their sin grows to no
further height, are guilty of the breach of this Commandment, when the mind
and members of the body be thus out of tune, men are like a troubled spring,
wherein if a man look thinking to behold the image of a man, he can see no
part of his right composition, in this case men make themselves fools, which
otherwise are not, and show themselves fools which are so, did I say fools?
nay very beasts, and the devils are again entered into a heard of swine, when
some being gluttons feed greedily, some being thankelesse, look not up to God
the giver of goodness no more then the swine to the tree from whence their
acornes come, when some being covetous are still moyling and rooting in the
earth, when some being angry are still foming by malice: be therefore neither
chafed in the mind as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field, neither let
anger be in the eyes, look not with a sower countenance, with Number. 24. 10.
angry Balak do not smite thy hands together, let thy carriage be courteous,
and thy dealing without disdain, be amiable and affable to all, look for an
answer, a contemptuous carriage of the body is a preparatiue to hatred, and
murder which this Commandment forbids.

Thou shall not kill: As men must not bath their butcherly swords in the
precious life of man, nor compass them about to take away their souls; so on
the other side the souls of men (to 1. Sam. 26. 21.
use Saules words unto David) being precious in our eyes, and their lives much
set by, must carefully be preserved to this end God commanded that he Deu. 22. 8
which builded a new house, (houses then were so builded that men might walk
upon them, as ^. Sa^. 11. 2.
David did upon the roof of the Kings Palace) should make a battelment on the
roof lest he did lay blood upon his house, if any fell from thence: again
Deu. 20. 10.
that before war, their should go a Proclamation of peace, again that if a
Servant did fly from his Master not for any theft, whoredom or notable
offense, but because his Master was cruel, Deu. 23. 15.
he to whom he did fly should be as his sanctuary, and he should not deliver
him to his Master: but what need further proof hereof when we see that God
commanded Ex. 23. 5.
to help up our enemies Ass, if he did lie under his burden.

First therefore our own lives must be dear unto us, and our bodies being
ruinous houses must have cost bestowed on them, to keep them tenentable and in
good reparations, and therefore miserable minded men are much to blame, who
spare not their bodies, but pinch and defraud them of due nourishment, whereby
they so dry their brain that they soon bring their days to an end: The
Apostle Paul as he will not have men take thought for the flesh Romans 13. 14.
to fulfill the lusts of it: so he blames those Col. 2. 23.
which have not the body in any estimation to satisfy the need of it, and
therefore he bids Timothy, 1. Tim. 5. 23.
he should drink no longer water, but use a little wine for his stomachs
sake, and his often infirmities: Again some Scholars are too blame who surfeit
of immoderate study, neglecting their bodies to satisfy their minds, when
their weakness checkes them, and their bodies control them, they should not
affect so much knowledge, but debar themselves of their chosen felicity,
having more respect to the health of the body, then wealth in the brain.

Again we must carefully look to the safety of our brothren, that their days
may be long in the land, that fulfilling the number of their years, they may
go to the grave in a full age. Mat. 15. 22.
The Cananite is careful for her sick daughter, Ioh. 4. 47.
the ruler for his sick son, the Mat. 8. 5.
Centurion for his sick Servant: Luc. 10. 33.
the Samaritan for the wounded stranger, Mat. 4. 24
the multitude for all sick people, that were taken with diverse diseases and
gripings, and them that were possessed with devils, and those which were
lunatike, and those that had the Palsy: Pompey, when there was a great dearth
in Rome, having provided store of corn abroad shipped the same intending
presently to relieve the hungry and thirsty, whose soul fainted in them, and
while the mariners were backward in hoysing sail, by reason of a tempest, he
himself being ver^ forward first entered, using these words, (...), it were
better for us to dye, then not set forward, preferring the relief of many
before the safety of a few. Nature has ingraffed in beasts without reason, a
care to preserve one another life; and therefore Hearts swimming over great
Rivers, when they go to rut in some Isles, place the strongest foremost, the
second stays his neck on the back of the first, the third on the second, so
all to the last: and the first being weary, an other takes his place, thus
(like Act. 27. 44
Paul's company on boards and certain pieces of the ship) they come all safe
to land: that there may be this care one of another welfare, we must love one
another, for where love is not, men are so far from seeking to preserve life,
that they seek to take it away: Amos 5. 10.
they hated him (says the Prophet) that rebuked in the gate: Es. 29. 21
they took him in a snare (says another Prophet) which reproved them in the
gate: Genesis 27. 41.
If Esau hates Jacob, he will make reckoning to kill him: Genesis 37. 18.
If Joseph's brethren hate Joseph, they will lay their heads together to slay
him, malice would dispatch him whom it hates, and therefore Saint Paul
reckoning up a bedrowle of sins against charity, Gal. 5. 20
begins with hatred, and ends with murder, for the one by degrees and steps,
rises up to that cruel height of iniquity: but where love is, there is
compassion: when our brethren undergo any loss or any cross, if they are set
as a mark to shoot at, and hunted as a Lion, if the arrows of the Almighty
are in them, and the venom thereof does drink up their spirits, if we love
them, they do not more feel the burden of their misery, then we are grieved
to see their distress: neither are we only fellow commoners with them in
their sufferings, but are as active in kindness, as passive in a sensible
feeling of their sorrow, we are not in style, but indeed serui sernorum Dei,
and therefore if God visit any with sickness, so that either with the 2 K. 4.
19
Shunamites son they cry out, my head* my head* or with, Asa, a 2 Mac. 9. 5.
my feet, my feet, or with 2 Chr. 16. 12.
Antiochus, my bowels, my bowels, if Mat. 8. 14
with Peter's wives mother they complain of a fever, with the Mat. 8. 5.
Centurions servant of a palsy, if diseases bereave them of their appetite, so
that they surfeit of the very smell, nay of the very sight, nay of the very
thought of the best dishes, if sickness bereave them of rest, so that they
weary themselves with changing sides, and counting the lingering hours, think
that the sun stands still, Ios. 10. 13
as it did in the days of Joshua, or 2 K. 20 11
go back, as it did in the days of Ezechias; if we love them, we will with
the Mat. 8. 5
Centurion go and speak for them: Mat. 2. 4.
with the Porters we will for their recovery set too our helping hands.

Rise, while it is yet dark, not put out our candle by night, we will girde
our loins and strengthen our hands to good: Again if they be oppressed, so
that great men with their talones and paws catch at them, prey upon them, make
havoc of all they have, and like the sea, making a rupture leave neither land
nor house nor trees, but play sweepe-stake, if we love them, we not only
grieve to see charity, (which in Christ's days was waxen cold, and in Basils
days was dried up) to be now quite dead, to see how much more cunning men are
in substraction then division; but we are painful to help them, and so
willing, that no pain can wear us, we use all good means we can to deliver
them from their oppressors, Esa. 1. 15.
whose hands are full of blond, whose hearts are as hard as iron, and as the
nether millstone, who thinking themselves ill seated while they dwell by
neighbors, depopulate Parishe^s, and being caterpillars and cormorants of the
earth, like whales of the sea, swallow up quick other little fishes, who like
Lions devour other beasts, like Kites seize, plume and prey upon other birds,
like greedy wolves devour all, and are indeed like the Asses iaw-bone Iud. 15.
15
with which Sampson flew a thousand men. Again, if they suffer want of things
necessary, so that being hungry and thirsty their soul faint in them, if we
love them, our plenty shall supply their penury, according to our abllity, we
will fulfill their want, as rivers fill up the empty places as they pass by,
love will drive us to compassion, and compassion to relief, and therefore to
conclude, by love be linked one to an other, as by faith you are united to God,
Ex. 26. 6.
like the c^rtaines of the Tabernacle, be twisted and knit together, be always
paying this debt, yet think you are debtors still, put on this livery coat,
Ioh. 13. 35.
whereby you are known to be the servants of God, Ro^. 13. 8.
this is the complement of the law, Ioh. 13. 34
the supplement of the Gospel, the fulfilling of this Commandment, Thou shall
not kill.

The seventh Commandment.
Exodus 20. 14, Thou shall not commit Adultery.
CHildren and the fruit of the womb, are an heritage and gift that comes of
the Lord; but because a Ps. 127. 3.
Mal. 2. 15
God sought c a Godly seed, such as should be borne in lawful wedlock; in
this Commandment he ^or bids us to run upon the rocks of uncleanness, and
so make shipwreck of all honest behavior, and commands us to keep our
selves chaste, as undefiled members of Christ's body: This is (as the Apostle
speaks) to possess our vessels in holiness and honor, and not in the lust of
concupiscence, even as the Gentiles, which knew not God. 1 Those. 4. 4.


Saint Paul makes the breach of this Commandment to branch it self into
these parts, Adultery, F^rnication, uncleanness, want^nnes; on each of which I
must be resident in this discourse, Gal. 5. 19.
as they present themselves in order to your view.

Adultery is the infringing of the faith plighted in marriage, when the husband
shall turn to evil, and commit a trespass against his wife or the wife shall
turn to evil and commit a trespass against her husband, for Adulterium is
quasi ad alterius Genesis 49. 4.
torum, the going up to another bed, as Jacob says of Reuben, when man and
wife forgetting their faith plighted one to another shall turn to uncleanness
one from another: A sin worse then simple fornication, for herein is a breach
of covenant, herein is an intrusion of the base borne into the inheritance or
possessions of the children, which are lawfully begotten): Deu. 23. 22 29.
and therefore by the law a sorer punishment was inflicted upon it, for the
Adulterer was put to death, and the fornicator to his fine.

If a rich man steal, men think he deserves to be punished, seven times more
then the poor man, who steals to satisfy his need, when he is hungry, for
he having means to maintain himself is without excuse. In Nathans parable
David sets his face against the man, and thinks him worthy to be cut off from
among his people, who having many Sheep 2 Samuel 12.
and Oxen, took the poor man's Sheep to dress for his stranger: if lust does
lodge whithin the married man's breast and the vehemence of affection would
persuade him to folly, God has given him a wife, good means, and a lawful
remedy to cause evil to depart from his flesh, now if such a one embrace the
bosom of a stranger, and will have the same conjunction with an harlot in
wickedness, which he might have with his lawful wife in holiness, and by the
appointeme^t of God, this man, or rather this beast is like a rich thief which
steals.

If a man falsefie a covenant in bargaining, either by subornation of
witnesses, or conueying under hand some secret title, it may be made a
Star Chamber matter: marriage is Mal. 2. 14
a covenant betwixt man and wife, Pro. 2. 17
a covenant of God, a covenant made before God and his Congregation, whereby
man and wife promise to keep themselves one to an other, and to no other, so
long as they both shall live: If now either of them shall break their faith
and troth thus plighted, what can be pleaded in their defense? what but blood
can expiate this sin? therefore Judah, c though there was little honesty in
his fact, yet desired not the company of an other woman, till Ge^. 38. 12
his own wife had yielded up her spirit, and gone the way of all flesh.

(...) makes protestation of his innocence in this respect, defiring God, that
if he be guilty this way, his wife might be made a sla^e, and other men might d
bow down upon her. The beasts by nature make difference betwixt these sins,
for they say that Job 31. 9.
the Lion, if he meets with an Adulterer, knows him, sets upon him, and
tears him in pee^es, not using the like rage against single fornicators: It is
written of the Storke, that wheresoever he flies, he comes in no neast but his
own, and if any of their company leaving his own mate, joins with any
other, all the rest fall upon him, beat him, and pluck his feathers from him.

This condemns the Nicholaita^es, a sect of Heretics, which held that wives
should be common, who took their beginning from Nicholas one of the seven
Deacons, for he being blamed for jealousy, brought forth his beautiful wife
among all the Disciples, saying who so would, should use her: Reu. 2. 6.
the holy Ghost commends the Church of Ephesus for disliking this sect.
Again this condemns the Anabaptists who treading in the steps of the
Nicholaitans argue thus, all things should be common, therefore wives, but one
writes of them that they be like the fox in the fable, who having lost her
tail, would have all the foxes cut off theirs, that so her private shame might
be the less, when the calamity was common to them all. In a word, it
condemns all such as being hot as an Oven, like fed horses ney, every one
after his neighbors wife, who delighting in dallyance and looking on strange
women croake in the Chambers like the frogs of Egypt. Yet what fault so
common as this, it may be said of some Cities (I would it were proper to
Cities) as it was sometime of Rome, vrbs est iam tota lupanar: the whole City
is nothing else but a common stews men hold it the safest way to drink of a
covered cup, and whereas Plato held, all things should be common but wives (
Clemens the first did not except them) now nothing so common as they, many are
become like Cuccoes, which lay their eggs in other birds nestes, Servants are
not now of Joseph's mind, who was backward in yielding to his Genesis 39. 12
Mistress, though she caught him by his garment, saying sleep with me:
considering the time is short, they which have wives should be 1. Cor. 7. 29.
as though they had none: but now they which have no wives be as though they
had wives, such a one was he who bragging of the villainy he had done, and
happily more then he had done, would say, that though he were never married,
yet he had two or three or four wives: Onan would not raise up seed to Genesis
38. 9.
another man, and therefore sinned as much as a woman, which destroys the
fruit of her body, but now men, laying wait at their neighbors door, are
ready to raise up seed to other men, let therefore wedlock be chaste, let the
window of the Arc be shut, that the waters of the flood do not enter into it:
God has set bounds to the sea, and said here shall stay thy raging waves, so
has he made the wife a bound for man's raging affection: and when man is
joined to a woman in marriage he must think he is at a non plus, and learn to
direct humors to their right courses and draw the flood of affections to their
own channel: The wife is a vine, and the husband must bind ^sa. 128. 3.
his affection to her, as Judah tie his Ass unto the Vine. In the Genesis 49. 11
Arc were no more men, then women, no more women then men, four for four,
that each might learn to content himself with one, and it is worth the
observation, that when they enter into the Arc, the holy Ghost puts the men
by themselves, and women by themselves: as Noah and his sons: Noah's Genesis 7.
7. 13
wife and his sons wives: to show that when judgment is toward, they which
have wives should be as though they had none, that they may give themselves
unto prayer: but when they go out of the Arc, God ioynes them together, go
forth of the Arc, thou and thy wife: thy sons and thy sons wives with thee
to show that when judgment is past they must come together again, that Satan
tempt them not for their incontinency, 1. Cor. 7. 5.
but this note came but in by the way, and shall not carry me so far out of the
way, but I will keep my self resident upon my Text: let every man have his
wife says Saint Paul, his wife, 1. Cor. 7. 2.
not his concubine, his wife, not his wives, and they two, not they three,
shall be one flesh: to show that none must be sick of a Plurisie, Edh. 5. 31.
or be like the devil which sowed another man's ground: Mat. 13. 25
if God had dispensed with any, it is like Kings should have had this
privilege, that they might have had an heir of their own body to succeed
them, when their own, wives went childles: but even Kings come within the
compass of this prohibition, neither shall any of them take him many wives:
when De^. 17. 17
a man sees his flesh grow proud and boyleth unto lust, of necessity he must
take a wife, or else fall, but if he fall having taken a wi^e, he is like a
Pilot, which suffers shipwreck, when he is come to the haven, or like Lots
wife which is cast away though she has escaped out of Sodom and might have
been saved in Z^ar. It was therefore a good answer which a Genesis 19. 29
married woman in Lacedemonia, made to a young man who desired her company,
young man, quoth she, I would grant that thou ask, were it mine to grant,
but that which thou demandest, while I was single, was my parents, they had a
care to preserve it, now I am married, it is my husbands, only he must have
it: it was as good which the Lady Gray made unto King Edward the 4, the first
of our English Kings, who married a subject: for when he, being enamored of
her, would have proceeded further, she hearing of a marriage concluded for him
in France, and of a precontract with the Lady Lucy, plainly told him, she
knew her self too simple to be his wife, and thought her self to good to be
his concubine: The example of Alexander is worth the remembrance who having
conquered Darius, and always having in his host the wife of the same Darius,
would after he had once seen her beauty, never after have her once come in
his presence, saying, it would be a great shame to him, who had conquered the
husband, now to be subdued by the wife. It is written of the Parthians, that
they forbid their wives not only to converse with men, but not so much as to
talk with them, or cast an eye upon them, yet they themselves marching under
Venus banner, will have many wives, but this is as much as if they should bid
them fight against enemies, fight against pleasures, to which they would yield
themselves: the man is the head of the woman, the head 1. Cor. 11. 3
should go before, the members follow after, if the woman live more chastely
then the man, the house is out of order, and the head does hang downward.

The means to keep chastity is love betwixt man and wife, for as he, which
loves an harlot hates his wife, so he which loves his wife hates an harlot,
and therefore Solomon dehorting from the strange woman, wishes us to rejoice
with the wife of Pro. 5. 8. 18 19.
our youth, and delight in her love continually: this love is armor of proof,
and will not suffer unchaste thoughts to enter into the heart: First therefore
knit hearts before you strike hands, first be heart fasted, then hand fasted,
first chose your love, then love your choice, like the bridegroom and the
spouse in the Canticles. call one another love: therefore the husband the first
year he was married was freed from the war, that Deu. 24. 5.
love might grow up as the water cresses, little by little but with a deep
root, where this is in the man another woman's person shall not be the prison
of his heart, nor lodge within his breast, his eyes shall not look upon
strange women, nor his flesh yield to the service of Venus: where this is in
the woman she girdeth her loins with strength, her heart is not deceived by a
man, where this is wanting in man or woman, they are ready to embrace the
bosom of strangers, to ouerflowe the banks of chastity, to set fire to their
honesty, to violate the rites of matrimony, and set forth marriage to all
r^proach and villainy: for though they dwell together in one house, yet are they
like two poisons in one stomach, one is sick of another like Eles in the pot
which would feign be out, like Spa^iels coupled, which hale, one one way,
another another way, and if they go any time quietly together, it is because
they cannot go a sunder, and though matrimony be a conjunction, yet in such it
is a conjunction disinuctiue, as are joined in body, but disioyned in
affection: hereupon it comes to pass that some in these days are as ready to
venture their lives for a common wench, as other in former times, have been
forward to hazard them for the commonwealth: hereupon it comes to pass that
man and wife, alleging some foul plea to clowt up their foul play seek to
be separated one from the other: those whom God has joined together man should
not put a sunder, the woman is bound by the law to the man while Romans 7. 2.
he lives: and on the other side, the man to the woman: Kings are bound with
these chains and Nobles with these linkes of iron, but when man and wife love
not, they will not be tied with this tackling, they break these bonds a
sunder, and cast away these cords from them, the heart of the husband must
cleave to his wife, the heart of the wife must cleave to her husband: the wife
is the glory of the man, every man loves his glory: they two are one flesh,
and as God at first made two of one by resolution, Genesis 2. 22.
so marriage makes one of two by composition: they are two boughs of one tree,
and together bear one fruit, as a sience taken from one tree and grafted in
another stock, and as children are a man's self multiplied, so the wife is a
man's self divided: Adam says she is flesh of my flesh, if any man hates Genesis
2. 23.
his own flesh, he is carried to Bedlem, and is like 1. Kin. 18. 28.
the Baalits which wounded their own bodies, Leu. 19. 28.
contrary to the Commandment; Man had his make made of his own flesh, and so
had no creature beside, and therefore man should exceed all other creatures in
the love of his make: and therefore Darius aforesaid, when Alexander the great
had overcome him, yet showed himself stout and invincible, till he understood
his wife was taken prisoner, at hearing whereof his heart did melt, his knees
did smite together, sorrow was in all his loins, being more grieved for her
imprisonment, then loss of his own liberty, victory, credit and estimation.

Again, concerning the woman, she was taken out of the side of man near the
heart, when she was first made, and when she is married, there is a ring put
by her husband on the fourth finger of her left hand, where there is a vein
which goes to the heart, to teach their to love him from the heart.

The Chronicle stores us with a cluster of many singular examples of this love:
some for love to her husbands have been content to hazard their estate as:

Some have been content to leave their Country, when L^ntulus Crustelio was
banished into Sicily, Sulpicia followed Genesis 12.
her husband, like Sarah, for when Abraham by Gods commandment left his
Country, she without commandment left her Country also: as if she should
say to her husband, as Ruth to Naomi, whither thou go, I will g^^, and where
thou dwell, Ruth. 1. 16. 17.
I will dwell, where thou die, I will die, and there will I be buried, the
Lord do so to me and more also, if ought but death depart thee and me. Some
have been content to loose their goods, to loose their good name, to loose
their lives. When Guelfus and other Noble men with their wives were taken
prisoners, after a siege in the Castle of Winsberg, the women having leave to
go away, and carry with them, whatsoever they could bear on their shoulders,
they leaving all other things, took up their husbands, and away they went.

A woman (as we read in the Acts and Monuments) defamed herself to deliver her
innocent husband, it was Calaway a Goldsmiths in London, who should have been
cast away, had it not been for his wife, for he being indicted of a crime, which
was death by the law, and might not have the benefit of his clergy, because he
had married a widow (for the law was that Bigamus might not have his book, and
he was accounted bigamus, who had been twice married himself, or else had
married a woman, whose former husband was dead) his wife came forth before the
Judges and deposed, that she never was married to him that was accounted her
first husband, but lived in adultery with him. When Nero condemned Seneca to
dye, he gave him leave to choose what death he would dye, whereupon he caused
his veins to be opened in a Bath, his wife Paulina of her own accord did the
like, choosing rather to dye with him, then live without him. I cannot omit one
example of an English Queen, and that is Eleonor wife to King Edward the
first, for when he going to the holy Land was wounded by a Morian with a sword
so enuenomed, that art and medecin could not cure him, this good and loving
wife with her own mouth, did day by day suck and draw out the venomous
humor, and without hurting herself helped her husband, cured and closed his
wound, in remembrance of whose great affection, King Edward did build her many
monuments.

A second breach of this law, and branch to be cut off is Fornication, which
though it be not so great sin as Adultery, as I have already proved, yet fly
Fornication: for these 1 Cor. 6. 18
things are common to both these sins, a diseased body, a damned soul, a
poor purse, a shameful name, a wronging of posterity, and of the party with
whom the folly is committed: For the first, these finne against their own
bodies, wasting their strength in pleasure, as the flame consumes the candle,
and therefore are like Sparrowes, which Aristotle says, do therefore live but
a short time, because of their common copulation: they procure to themselves
such infectious diseases, as will hasten their death, and such as will stick
by them, when their best friends give them over.

Concerning their souls, Saint Paul excludes them from 1 Cor. 9. 6
the Kingdom of heaven; as he will have them separated from 1 Cor. 5. 9 11. 13.
the company of men upon earth.

Concerning their estate, poverty comes upon them as one that trauaileth by
the way, and necessity like an armed man: this sin is purgatory to the purse,
though it be paradise to the desires, Danae does then like Jupiter, when he
comes unto her in the form of a shower of golden rain, and therefore the Poet
says;

Nuda Venus picta est, nudi pinguntur amores:
Nam quos nuda capit, nudos dimittat, oportet.
How soon had the prodigal child consumed his portion, Luc. 15. 14
when once he light among harlots; but you will say, this sin may bring a
mean man to poverty, and a poor man to beggary, but great ones may wallow in
this sin, and yet their estate never be empaired, nay women are like enough
to gain by the trade, for they be receivers, with Mat. 26. 15.
Judas they are at their Quantum dabis? as if their lovers bring any thing,
they are welcome, if any of them say with Peter, Act. 3. 6.
Silver and f Gen 38. 16.
gold have I none, ibit for as, there is no entertainment for him, f Thamar.
the string of their hearts reach to the pulse of their hands, and must be
rubbed with gold.

Concerning Name, men have a care of their credit, and would have a good
reputation among men, next to the approbation of God and the testimony of a
good conscience, for if a man's name be once tainted with just reproach, postea
nullus erit, but is like a garment, which once rent is like to be torn on
every nail; now he that commits adultery with a woman loses his name, a
bad report is his portion while he lives, a bad heir when he is dead, and
such a one as shall outline all his posterity, his reproach shall never be put
away: and ^ro. 6. 33.
it were well, if only he himself did pay for it, but this is not all, but
even the children unlawfully begotten do feel the smart of it; for first the
stain remains to them, and bastardy is their blemish, then which, what can
be a greater, and therefore when the holy Ghost would brande the Israelites
with a mark of greatest reproach, he calls them the seed of Esa. 51. 3.
the Adulterer, and of the whore: Again parents are not so careful of the
good education of such children, their birth is not so base, but their bringing
up is as base as their birth, such fathers care not, though with the Israelites
they offer such sons and daughters unto devils, they have no care to correct
them, they care not though they have their swinge, though it be in an halter,
and therefore the Lord compares those, whom he corrects not unto bastards, If
ye be without Heb. 12. 8.
correction, then are ye bastards and not sons: besides all this the Jewish
law does not allow such children the same privileges, which it does those,
which are lawfully begotten, for first they were not called to places of
public government, either in Church or common wealth; and secondly, they
were excluded from inheritance: and therefore when Iphthas brethren were come
to age, they thrust out Iphtah (the only base borne in the Scripture which we
read of came to good, and he is set down lest bastards should despair, and
none but he, lest parents should presume) and said unto him, thou shall not
inherit in Iud 11. 2.
our fathers house, for thou art the son of a strange woman.

A wise traueler when he comes to his Inn, though many pleasant dishes be
presented to his sight, yet he forbeareth them in consideration of the price:
we are here trauelers toward Jerusalem which is above, this world is but a
baiting place to go to another, here the harlot says, as in the Proverbs, I
have Peace offerings: meat at home to make good chere, I have decked Pro. 7. 14
my bed with ornaments, etc. Come let us take our fill of love until the
morning, let us take our pleasure in dalliance: all this founds well, but taste
of her cates and delicates, and how hard is the reckoning? the body must pay
for it, for howsoever Dalilah speaks fair, yet in the end she bereaues
Sampson of Iud. 16. 19.
his strenghth, of his sight and of himself: and yet the shot is not paid,
but thy soul must go to the reckoning, for thou postest to hell on the back
of uncivil pleasures, if thou think that now all is discharged, thou
reckonest without thy host and therefore must reckon twice, thy goods must go
to the payment. This sin makes even the covetous man prodigal, as thy goods
so thy good name must make up the shot: and when thou think all is
discharged, there comes an after reckoning, and thy posterity must pay it, thy
bastardly generation, and the children which are not yet fashioned in their
mothers womb* I had rather want a little honey, then thus be stung with the
payment, I like not the Scorpion, which goes over the body very smothily, but
stingeth with the tail, nor yet the gnats, which making music about the
ears, do evermore sting or they part, nor yet such pleasures, as like
tragedies have as bitter ends, as they have sweet beginnings. When that famous
or rather infamous harlot Lais demanded of Demosthenes a round sum of money
for one nights lodging, he gave off his suite with these words, Nolo tanti
emere poenitentiam, I will not buy repentance so dear: If one single coarde
was strong enough, to draw Demosthenes from fleshly delights, then what shall
a threefold coarde do us, nay a coarde which is five times doubled? When the
mother of Lemuel would dissuade him from giving his strength unto women, she
puts him in mind that he is a man Por. 31. 2. 1. Cor. 6. 20.
of worth: We are men of worth, bought with a price, but if we yield to
fleshly delights, we show our selves base, pleasures, they say, are for the
body and the body for the soul, and therefore if this sin reign in us we
are become servants to our servants servant.

And therefore the law of Nature, before the law of God was written, did
punish this sin with death, Judah, when he heard his daughter Tamar had
played the harlot, and with playing the harlot was with child, gave this
sentence, bring Genesis 38. 24.
her forth, and let her be burnt.

The Egyptians cut off the woman's nose, and the men's members, Augustus Casar
permitted the father to kill his daughter taken in adultery, Canutus a Danish
King in this land did banish them. Tenedius a King in another land did cut them
in sunder with an axe: Lex Iulia and the law of Romulus, did put them to
death, and therefore the Pope is to blame, who allows of Courtisans, which
pay tribute for license to be commen whores: Much to be misliked was that
judgment given against Theodora in the 7. persecution of the primitive Church,
who because she refused to do sacrifice to the Idols, was therefore condemned
to the stews, though by the policy of Dydimus a Christian, who came and
took on him her apparel, and sent her out in his, she kept her self
chaste: let the Church, which is a Virgin married to Christ keep one faith,
and let all that are married one to another keep the same office in flesh,
which the Church keeps in faith, let young men with Joseph strive manfully to
subdue this sin Cen. 39. 9.
knowing that chastity is grace to the body, beauty to the soul and peace to
the desires.

A third sin which the Apostle reckons among the works of the flesh is
uncleanness, which is a general word comprehending the two former sins and
stretches yet further, condemning the sin of the Sodomites when man with man
works filthiness. and therefore to blame was Sixtus the 4. who built a costly
Stews in Rome appointing it to be both maseuline and feminine, making a gain
of that most beastly sin, giving the whole family of the Cardinal of Saint
Luce free leave in June, July and August to use that sin for committing
whereof God reigned upon Sodom and Gomorah fire and brimstome from ^en. 19. 24
heaven, A bird of the same feather was John Casus Archbishop of Beneuentane,
the Popes Legate to the Venetians, who magnified this sin not in word alone,
but commended the same in writing: but as Pho^ion did think he had spoken
somewhat amiss, because the common sort commended his Oration: so think the
worse of this sin, because such lewd persons give it such allowance and so
great commendation.

Buggery with beasts is another sin comprehended under this uncleanness a
sin so hated of God, that the innocent Leu. 20. 15.
and harmeles beast should dye as well as the party that committed the fact:
Other sins of like sort, which nature does abhorte and chaste ears will not
willingly hear, the very thought whereof wounds the heart with horror, I
purposely pass over, and come to the last branch which is wantonness, and this
is either inward or outward, inward in the heart, for he that lusts after a
woman has committed adultery with her Mat. 5. 28.
already in his heart, and God did punish the resolution Genesis 12. 17
in Pharaoh and Genesis 20. 3
Abimelech though neither of them had come nigh unto Abraham's wife: we have a
saying: thought is free: but the Apostle says, I had not known that lust had
been sin, except the Romans 7. 7.
law had said, thou shall not lust: I know this sin shrowdes it self under
the habit of virtue, and as cleanlynes does cover pride, thirst does cover
covetousness, so the conueyance is not cleanely, except the outside of love does
cover the inside of lust, thus the devil will not show us sin in it right
colors, but with the spider weaues a fine web to hang the fly withal, and
with Alcibiades imbroyders a curtain with Lions and Eagles to cover his
pictures of Owls and Apes: but we must take the visour from this sin, that
it may appear as it is, reject it though it comes with a mask, give it no
counteuance though under a good color it would insinuate it self: The best
weeding is to pluck up the roots, lust is the root of sin, which brings
forth a bitter fruit, the holy Ghost will not suffer a Deu. 29. 18
root that springs forth Gall and Wormwood, but will have it weeded out:
When the trees did see that iron milles consumed them so fast, they laid their
heads together and concluded upon this, they would not lend to any axe so much
as an helfe, we are as trees, Gods judgments an axe, our sins yeel^ matter
sufficient to cut us down, conclude upon this not to yield so much as a
thought, it is as easy to quench the flame of Aetna, as the thoughs set on
fi^e by affection.

Outward wantonness is either in the body or the appurtenances, in the body,
when the eye is wanton, the ear is wanton, the tongue is wanton, or when there
is a wanton carriage of the whole body: The wanton eyes like Jacobs sheep, too
firmly Genesis 30. 39.
fixed upon beautiful objects, make the affections bring forth spotted fruit:
the eyes of Putiphars wife caused her to step awry, vritque videndo famina for
glauncing forth their beams on Joseph's beauty, they made their reflection on
her heart with Genesis 39 7.
hot burning lust: sight is set down as the original both of Genesis 34. 2. 2.
Sam. 11.
Shechems and David's fall, the foolish eye like the spider gathers poison of
the best flowers, as the wise eye like the Be gathers honey of the worst weeds.

Vt vidi, vt perij, vt me malus abstulit error. And therefore when there were
some who seemed to have compassion upon a one eyed man, he told them, he had
lost one of his enemies, a very thief which would have stolen away his heart;
an I^^enall makes it a wonder, that a certaien man who wanted both his eyes
should be addicted to this sin.

Qui nunquam visae flagrabat amore puella. For true is the proverb, (...),
lust creepes in at the window of this sense, as the enemy at the gates of
Jerusalem, and pickes the lock of the strongest heart: Lam. 4. 12. Job. 31. 1.
therefore with Job, we must make a covenant with our eyes, since C^rce will
inchaunt all that behold her, having faculty attractiue with the Ieate, and
retentiue with the Diamond, whose face is like a glass, wherein while the
La^kes gaze, they are taken in the day net.

Again a wanton ear lettes in lust: The Basilike or Cocatrice Pro. 7.
is so venomous, that he slays with his sight: the Sirens sing so sweetly,
that they allure all that lend them their ea^es, to come unto them, as Venus is
a Basiliske, and men must shut their eyes, and not gaze at her, least they
perish, so is she a Siren, and men must stop their ears at her melody, like
Ulysses soldiers, or the deaf Adder which refuses to hear the voice of the
Charmer, charm he never so wisely: the care must be like a s^rue which keeping
in the good seed casts out the dust and iuory, and if with the draw-net in
the Gospel, it has taken all manner of things, with the men in that place, it
must keep the good as in a vessel and cast the bad away.

A wanton tongue either in reading or in common talking, is another cord,
which draws on adultery, and a passage whereby it enters into the heart,
evil speech corrupt good manners, 1. Cor. 15. 33.
what contents the tongue, to that consent the heart, and therefore if in
reading any book we meet with, any thing which may make way for this sin,
we must pass by it, as the Priest and Luc. 10. 31.
Leuit by the wounded man, or deal as the Israelites with the Deu. 21. 1^.
captive woman, pare away that which is superfluous lest we be like the
Prodigal Child, who desired to be refreshed with the husks that the swine did
eat.

As for wanton words, refuse them as much in thy talk, as poison in thy
meat: how foul a fault is it to be like the duckes, which still have their
bills in the mire? if thy tongue would feign run over, with Job, lay thy hand
upon thy mouth, be like David, who, as he desired to be a doore-keeper in Gods
Psa. 141. 3.
house, so desired God to be a doore-keeper in his house: Set a watch, O Lord,
before my mouth, and keep the door of my lips. I will not speak here of a
wanton hand, either in writing or being worse employed only it grieueth me, to
see the best wits, lose themselves in the vainest follyes, to see good Clerks
serve Venus in Mineroues raiment to see great scholars long in travail, to be
in fine delivered of some lewd and idle fancy: to see Ovid spill much art in
his book de art amandi, for which Augustus banished him, as knowing that
young minds would thereby be stirred up unto wantonness: As the members of the
body severally, may be arraigned and found guilty of this transgression, so
jointly together they may be indicted for it, when there is a wanton carriage of
the whole body at the same time, Psa. 3. 16.
such as the daughters of Zion used who walked with stretched out necks, and
with wandering eyes, walking and minsing as they went, and making a tinkling
with their feet: such as Dauncers commonly use, and therefore Diogenes being
asked what he thought of dancing answered, the better, the worse, as though he
thought the best dauncers the worst men: Chrysostom seems to dislke
dancing, we read, says he, of Ioh. 2. 1.
a marriage feast, Mat. 22. 11.
of marriage garments, of Mat. 25. 7.
Virgins going before with lamps, but of dancing at marriages, says he we
read not, as though he though it had not a just warrant, because it wanted
express mention.

Now wantonness in the appurtenances, and things belonging to the body, shows
it self in wanton apparel, and strange diet, both these are instruments to
strike up a dance for adultery: apparel whether we consider the cost or the
fashion: the cost, and therefore Lysander would not suffer his daughters to
wear gorgeous attire; saying it would not make them so comely as common. Men
therefore are to blame, which have the cunning, that they can turn two or
three hunderd acres of ground, into two or three trunkes of apparel, who to
set ou^ themselves gorgeously sell away their land so long by the yard, that
they leave not for themselves a foot; who can as easily carry many Oaks and
Woods on their backs, a as 1 Sa^ 1^. ^
Goli^h carried in his hand a spear, as big as a weauers beam: to blame are
women, who tire not themselves as holy women in times past, b who trusted in
God, and were subject 1 Pe^. 3. 5 Esa. 3 1^.
to their husbands; but like the c daughters of Z^on, must have too much
variety, and cloth their flesh like the Raine-bowe with garments of diverse
colors. Not but that men of degree and calling may wear sumptuous habits
according to the custom of the Country, and honor of their place, as in Kings
houses d they wear soft raiment without reproof; but when Mat. 11. ^. Luc.
16. 19
men beyond their degree and place must like the e rich man be clothed in
purple for ostentation, and fine linen for delectation: when they must have
their faced and defaced garments, when they must apparel their apparel with
ruffes on ruffes, laces on laces, cuts on cuts, when they must have pearls to
adorn the body, though the soul be robbed of her Jewels, when they must have
rich ornaments, not so much for use and profit, as for a brag, and to serve
other men's eyes, this, this is liable to reproof, and they which put on this
light attire, cannot lightly put on honest and chaste conversation.

Now for the fashion, attire is as strange in fashion, as the Giants were
monstrous in nature: and Adam was not so much ashamed of his nakedness, as now
men may be of their clothing: Honesty first invented the seemly garment, to
cover our unseemly parts; Necessity the profitable garment, to defend us from
the injury of the weather, but riches and riot did find out the precious, which
vanity did fashion to her trick: and howsoever this land has given other
nations the foil, yet they have given us the fashion, the pride of all
Countries sits in our skirts, the follies of all Nations are fallen upon us, if
there be a new toy or a new fashion, men, but especially women be sick of the
fashions, and never well till they have it, though some of them with their
fashions grow clean out of fashion. But, ad quid perditio hac? whereto serves
this waste? there is no building to that, which is made without hands, no joy
to a quiet conscience, no clothing to the righteousness of Christ, put on
therefore the Lord Jesus Christ, and let Romans 13. 14
not unchaste behavior show it self in the gawdines of attire, what are
silks, but the excrements of worms? what is gold, but the dregs of the
earth? what are precious stones, but the rubble of the sea? compound thy
garment of all these, and make it of the best fashion, yet art thou not clothed
like g the lillyes of the field. Nature has cladde beasts with an hair Mat.
6. 29.
skin, and fowls with feathers, but man, because he is endued with reason, it
brings forth naked, leaving his covering to good discretion, let apparel
therefore be such, as shall not so much satisfy a curious eye, as bear witness
of a sober and chaste mind.

Now for Diet, a full belly makes a foul heart: gluttony and drunkenes lead
the dance, chambering and wantones follow forthwith, fullness of bread bredde
vneleannes in the Sodomites: Romans 13. 13 Ez. 16. 49.
when the mouth is a tunnell, the throat a winepipe, the belly a barrel filled
to the full, whoredom works out: the rankest weeds grow out of the fattest
soil: and therefore as the b Apostle Saint Paul speaking of purity, speaks
first of 2 Cor. 6. 6 Ier. 5. 7. 8.
fasting, so the Prophet i Jeremy speaking of impurity and uncleanness, speaks
first of feeding to the full: The body is a seathing pot, concupiscence is a
fire, plentiful and costly diet does kindle the fire: Venus in vinis: Venus
warmes herself at the sign of the Iuie bush, and sine Cerere and Baccho
friget Venus, not but that Paul and his acquaintance may meet at the market of
k Appins, and at the three tauernes*, for as we may eat Act. 28. 15. 1 Cor.
10. ^5.
whatsoever l is sold in the shambles (though Pythagoras would eat of no
living creature: as Essei people of Palestine would never eat Pigeons) and as
the disciples might eat and drink whatsoever was ^et before them, ordinary
and common victuals, Luc. 10. 7.
so God has given m wine to make glad the heart of man, and oil to make him a
cheerful countenance: only we Ps. 104. 19
must take heed we be not irregulares gulares, and making the corpse a
cloake-bagge, and the gut a gulf abuse Gods good gifts, and take thereby
occasion to sin.

The eight Commandment.
Exodus 20. 15. Thou shall not steal.
AMong other reasons why God would have his Leu. 11. 1^.
people Israel, abstain from fowls living upon prey, this was one, to teach
them, they should not prey one upon another, they should not take away one
another goods, and feed themselves by offending him, who feeds all: This is
also the mark at which this Commandment does level: which forbids us to
have vnc^s vngues, to be light fingered, to increase that which is not our
own, by putting our hands to our neighbors goods; and secondly, inioyneth us
to content our selves with our own estate, to get our own living with our
sweat, and as much as we may, to procure the good and the welfare one of
another.

Two sorts of men live upon prey, the first more public, and these are they,
which prey upon Church or common wealth: upon the Church, these are either
grubbing Patrons of benefices, and their sacrilegious brokers, who rob the
Clarke whom they intend to present, or else greedy Parishoners, who spoiling
the Lord in Tithes and offerings, rub the Clarke presented: the first of
these resembles the horseleach, Pro. 30 15
which cries, give, give, resembles Judas, who says, Mat. 26. 15.
what will ye give, resembles the devil, who says, Mat. 4. 9
all these will I give, if: and before matters be concluded Magus must offer
money, the purse must pay for it, or else the wings of the benefice must be
clipped: Tithes must be compounded for, or else abated, the palmer worm must
have his part, the grasshopper his part, the canker worm his part, the
caterpiller her part, and all that remain shall be but Reliquiae Danaum atque
immitis Achyllis; and the quotum shall consist in a great number of small
Tithes: the Clarke shall have a Camels skin stuffed with straw: a great Canon
that gives a monstrous crack and shootes but paper, with Ixion he must embrace
a cloud for Inno, and with Narcissus make much of a shadow in stead of a water
Nymph: he shall have the shell when Ichnewmon has sucked out the egg of the
Crocodill, or the shelles of the Oyster, when the Latron has had the flesh of
the fish: small matters like the skabbard shall remain untouched, when thunder
has destroyed the sword. The Statute of Mortmaine provided they should give no
more to the Church, and therefore like Moses it cried Hoe, but tempora
mutantur, and nos mutantur in illi^. These latter times have seen the springs
of bounty like Jorden turned back, which heretofore did run fresh and fast
into the Church.

Our fathers forefathers put too much blood into the Churches veins,
succeeding ages for her good, that it might not dye of a plurisie; let it blood
in the swelling vein of her excess, these times are so far from stopping
the issue, that they prick it still and suffer it to bleed to death. The
Egyptians dealt hardely with the Israelites, when they took away their straw,
and so do these Gipcies, which take away the corn, and allow nothing but
straw: they are sick of the dropsy, and a cup as big as a Church will scarce
satisfy it; so they may be golden Patrons, they care not though they present
leaden or wooden Priests, they are content with Michaes Priests, so they may
have them for Michaes wages, they prefer even light angels before Angels of
light, and care not how little reckoning the Clarke be, so they may sell their
presentation at a great price, they do not so much regard aram dominicam, as
haram domesticans, these are not Papistae but Rapistae, Merchants broken into
the Church, a great deal more intolerable, then those which Christ whipped out
of the Temple: This sacrilege is theft in the highest degree, in revenging
whereof Act. 5. 3.
Peter uses his key, in mentioning whereof, Romans 2^. 2^.
Paul makes it a match or ouermatch for idolatry, and indeed, if
covetousness, be Idolatry, and theft the daughter of covetousness, and
sacrilege the eldest daughter of theft, then he that committeh sacrilege may
be said an Idolater: besides he is a means of Idolatry in bringing in
ignorance and superstition, and though there be great fault in the Clarke, for
he should say, by the grace of God I am that I am, not by my smooth tongue, not
by my great friends, not by my bribing purse, yet Sacrilege is a beam in
respect of this mote, and though the beam and mote must both be cast out, yet
Mat. 7. 5.
first cast out the beam Mat. 2^. 12.
though sellers and buyers must both be cast out of the Temple, yet the sellers
have the first place: and therefore ye Patrons, be no longer Pirates of the
Church, neither mangle nor sell that liberal allowance that is committed to
your trurst, do not under color of taking away the superfluity, leave to
little for the necessity of the Minister, be somewhat more friendly to the
Church then the East wind to the fruits of the earth, do not 1. Kin. 14. 17.
with Rehoboham give her sheilds of brass for her sheilds of gold, make her
not a mark to shoot at, pull not still the forbidden fruit, despoyle not the
Church which your fathers clothed, rob her not of her possessions and
endowments, let not your Leuits purchase your Cures, let him have his penny
that labors in the Vineyarde, the false prophets made a spoil of you, do not
you make a spoil of the true, if you are merchants of souls, you are enemies
of religion, you consume the zeal of Gods house, and are harbingers to take up
Chambers for the devil.

Again the Parishoners which withold their tithe are said to rob or spoil
Mal. 3. 8. 10.
the Lord in tithes and offerings: God as he will have the seventh of your time,
so he will have the tenth of your living, Moses gives a strict charge for this
in the Old Testament, and Gal. 6. 6.
Paul as strict in the New: The Minister is borne for the good of many, and
many for the good of him to Minister to him temporal things, as he to them
spiritual, and therefore do not ye like Caterpillars cleave to the fruits
of the Church, say truly with the Pharisee Luc. 18. 12
I give tithe of all that ever I possess, and give it with a willing mind.

Others like greedy cormorants and fawcons seize, and plume and prey upon the
common wealth, such are they who make a private gain of that which should be
for the public good, such as depopulating Parishes think themselves ill
seated, when they dwell by neighbors, such as grating upon poor trades with
hard engrossing, to get much wealth, put in hazard all their credit and
estimation: even Tully a heathen Philosopher, in his third book of offices,
thought this pulling, this catching and snatching from other did overthrow
common society, and that the whole body must then needs be weak and perish,
when every part thereof did think it might be strong, if it had conveyed to it
self the strength of the next lives, but let this suffice to have spoken of
public theft, either in spoiling Church or common wealth: there is a more
private theft, when a man is a thief to himself, or to his neighbor or to
both, to himself, either to his body or his goods, to his body, when he does
not minister to it things necessary, but will be always indebted to his back
and to his belly, and so as he may have his purse full, he cares not though he
keep his back bare and belly thin, and cares not how poor he live, so as
he may dye rich. The good man having nothing is Lord of all things, l habet
^mina, quia habet habentem omina, he has all 2. Cor. 6. 10.
things because he has the Lord of all things, the father the most ancient of
days fills his memory, the son the wisdom of the father fills his
understanding, the holy Ghost the comforter fills his will: on the other side
the miserable man has all things, yet of all he has, he has nothing, he is
good to none but worst to himself: he is like the Cornish-chough, which will
steal a piece of money and hiding it in some hole, will never help her self
with it afterward, unlike the deluer of the earth, for he with his mat^ocke
draws relief and nouriture out of the earth, but this man hides that in the
earth, which should be a means ^^ nourish and relieve him, if he wants any
thing his spirit is troubled with restles thoughts to get it, if he has any
thing, he comforts not himself with it, but accounts it lost that he bestows
upon himself, he is afraid he should hinder himself of a chicke, if he
should but eat an egg, and thinks himself half undone, if he makes a good
meal on his own trencher: this is an evil, which Solomon saw under the sun
and it is much among men: m A man to whom God has given M. Eec. 6. 1
riches and treasure and honor, and he wants nothing for his soul of all
that it desires, but God gives him not power to eat thereof: the body is a
servant, let it feel the sweet of it sweat, let it have which is sufficient
for quantity, and wholesome for quality. let a Ecc. 2. 24 and 3. 22.
man eat and drink and delight his soul with the profit of his labor, and
know that there is nothing better then that a man should rejoice in his
affairs,

Again a man may be a thief to himself in his estate, either when he shall
foolishly hazard his goods for others, as in rash and unadvised suerty ship, or
else when he shall prodigally waste them upon himself upon back, belly, or
building, these three b b b; like the daughters of the Horse leach suck out
the very blood of many a man's substan^^: The Prophet Hosee speaking of the
destruction, that the Assyrans and Babilonians, should bring upon Israel,
says Hos. 7. 9.
strangers devour their strength: so still strangers devour men's strength:
strange apparel, strange diet, and strange building impair many particular
men's estates, and take their pu^ses from them: strange apparel, when a man's
attire shall be more worth then himself, and change of garments shall cover a
threadbare purse: strange diet, when frugality is not the purse-bearer and
hunger the cook which assigns the diet, when men have velvet mouths and
sweet teeth, which must be furred with excess of meat and drink, when making
their senses their purueyours, and appetite their stewards, they draw their
goods thorough their throats. whose purses may be said poor for the great
going out, while their bellyes may be said rich for the great coming in:
strange building pickes a man's purse making some like the builder in the
Gospel, who began to build, but was not able to make an end, others to leave
their houses desolate, for they spew out the owner, so that they are like the
slothful man's Vineyard: Pro. 24 3. 1
the nettle possesses the pleasant places of their silver, the thorn is in
their Tabernacles, and grass grows at the doors, or if they be resident on
their houses, they keep but few fires in many chimneyes, the smoke comes all
out at one hole, and though a man may see them a far of, yet they cannot
smell them nigh hand, bread and beef is turned into stones: the stately ro^fe,
the costly parements, the curious workmanship, has chased away hospitali^ie,
robbed the purse, and brought it into a consumption not to be recovered.

Of those which put their hands to their neighbors goods, some are notorious
thieves, as on Shooters hill or in Stangate hole, which take up such purses as
fall in the laps for want of sufficient defense, some whereof are like the
Owl, which preyes in the dark, who turning the order of Nature vpside down,
watch the night and sleep the day, others like the Kite prey in the light both
sorts watch for a man: and as fowlers take birds, so are they Hos. 6. 9.
a snare on Mizpha, and a not spread upon Tabor: God to show that he would not
have any man spoiled of that which was his, took order that the wife should
not marry to a stranger, if her first husband dyed childles: that if a man had
builded an house, Deu. 20. 5
planted a Vineyard, betrothed a wife, he should not go to war, till he
first had had the use of them all: that the father when he dyed, should not
give to one son, that which of right belongs to another: he should not give
away the inheritance from the first borne, though happily he bare more
affection to one of his younger sons, except 6. 7.
he had just cause to do it: as Jacob had, who therefore set his eldest son
Deu. 21. 6
Ruben besides the cushion, because he went up to his fathers bed to defile, it
if God would not suffer the father to dispose of that which was his own, much
less will he have on man's goods to be at another disposition: and therefore
when ^ Genesis 49.
a prigging fellow said to Demosthenes (who took him up short for fingring
that which was none of his own) nescieba^ quod h^^ tuum esset: I did not think
it had been yours: Demosthenes well replied, at tuum non esse satis sciebas,
but thou knew well enough it was none of thine, and therefore hand off, thou
should let it alone: neither let any say, God commanded the Israelites to
rob the Egyptians, for Gods commadement against his law is no warrant for any
to break the law. Besides the common Gailebirds which are limefingred, and
spoil them that pass by peaceably, as though they returned from the war,
there are others which rob men privily and more closely increase that which is
not theirs: I will not speak here of the Lawyer, who is little better then a
thief, if his hand be open to receive a fee, and his mouth be shut, when he
should speak in his Clyents cause, nor yet of the Physician, who is little
better then a thief, if of purpose he keeps his Patient low, that he may be
still in request nor of the Minister, who if he enters not in by the ^oore into
the sheepe-fold, if he takes the (...) and feeds not the flock, is a thief
and a robber: I come to those, who though they have no calling, can make an
occup^tion of close theft, either in taking from other that which they have, or
keeping back that which they should have: in the first rank is the usurer,
who breeding money of money, to the third and fourth generation proves like the
butlers box, which at last draws all the counters to it. The Canon law makes
this man a thief, and therefore does not only excommunicate him, detain him
from the Sacraments, deny him burial, but makes his will, no will, as though
his goods were not his own: and therefore when an usurer asked a prodigal
man, when he would leave spending; I will then, says he, leave wasting that,
which is mine own, when thou do give off stealing from others. Saint Luke
makes this man worse then other sinners, when he says, Luc. 6. 3^
Sinners lend to sinners to receive the like: but these to receive more.

The ancient law of the Romames makes him worse then other thieves, therefore
whereas it enjoined thieves to r^store double, the vsu^er should restore
fourefold. The Hebrews make him a biting thief, who gnaweth the debtor to the
very bones, yea the most roothles usury has sharp gummes, which bite as sore
as an old dog, or an hungry fly, and under show of licking whole suckes out
the heart blood, and therefore when on a time the bill and bonds of vserers
(for these men turn their estate into obligations) were at Athens all heaped
together in the market place, and burnt before their faces, Alcibiades
laughing, said, he never saw a clearer or purer fire. There is a spiritual b
Mat. 25.
usury, God delivers his talents he lets out his gifts and looks for
increase, and we must pay it, he is n^uer needy yet delights to gain, neu^r
covetous yet he demands usury: and Bornardine thought a man might let his
money to use without offerce, but it was when he let it out to such, as were
never able to return the principal, as for other usurers, one says, they are
the very vermin of the earth, whom God never made, but when the flood ceased,
they rose up a other v^rmine of the sl^me of the earth, and ever since held by
intrusion.

But what says the usurer? the law of the land will allow ten of the hundred:
therefore you do not well to inueigh against it: first concerning the
argument, the law of the Lord, not of the land, must be the square of our
lives, else are we like the Jews, who when they would crucify Christ, said,
Ioh. 19. 7
We have a law, and by our law he ought to die: Now concerning the
Proposition, the law is wronged, for it allows not ten for lone of an
hundred, but punishes him which extorteth more, neither shall a man by law
recover ten, if he put it in suite but forfet his principal, if he compound
for more then ten.

Another says: I may let or lend other things, and take rent, or have for the
lone, and why not for my money? the reason is not alike: for other things are
the worse for wearing, not the money, as good current money must be returned
as was let out: Again though a man let out other things, yet is he Lord of
them still, so is not the of his money, after that he has parted with it:
again other things yield a commodity of their own nature, so does not money,
the labor and travail of him which borrowes it, brings in all the profit;
Lastly, if a man let other things, the borrower does not bear the loss if
they miscarry, except it be by his default, as for example, the sea makes a
rupture into a piece of ground, the lessor, who owes the ground shall bear the
loss, the lessee who rents the ground shall not be constrained to it. A man
lets a Horse, which falls sick and dies, if the owner knows there was no
fault in the borrower, the borrower Ex. 22. 15
shall not make it good for it was an hired thing, and went for his hire, but
let money miscarry any way: he that lends it will look it should be repaide.

An other says, it is lawful to give use, ergo to take it: rhis Argument is
as weak as the rest: A true man may deliver his purse, as many times he does
to save his life, or prevent a further mischief, this does not prove it
lawful for a thief to demand or to take his purse. A man may suffer wrong,
is it therefore lawful to do wrong? Saint Paul commands the ^ 1 Cor. 6. 7 8.
one, and condemns the other: do not therefore let money, sell not time for
price, make not a gain of uncharitable charity free not a man from one band
and wrappe him in many; 1. be not worse then a Jew, one Jew will not take use
of another; be not like b Joseph's brethren, who comforted their d Genesis 37. 35.
father, yet caused his woe, nor the Iuy, which kills by culling, nor the
Aspe, which with his sting casts a man into a pleasant sweet sleep, but
disperseth his venomous infection into every member of the body to the loss of
life: be not a legal thief, do not breed money of money, as soon as it
has any being, set it not to beget more, like the hare, which while she
brings up one, bringes forth an other, and conceiueth an other young after her
first conception, lay not this heavy burden upon thy brethren, much less look
for a secret gratuity besides the maine interest: usury is a trade too easy to
be honest, the bane of charity, and very death of life, and therefore as other
Nations did punish this sin, some with Zachees restitution, as the Romans,
some with banishment as the Lacedaemonians, some with burning bands, as the
Athenians so God mentioning the cruelty of Jerusalem, in taking e Ez. 22. 12 13.
usury and the increase, like a man in a rage imites his hands together, that
they may be sure, he will be avenged of it.

There are other Takers which Job ranketh among thieves, and of these he sets
those in the forewarde, which take away a man's land, not only such as do this
under color of law, as ^ Ki. 21. 16
Ahab took away Naboths vineyard, but such as by displacing bounds, incroach
one upon another ground: ome, says he, Job 24. 2.
remove the landmarkes, that rob the flocks and feed thereof: God who set
bounds to the Sea appointed bounds betwixt land and land: what a care God had
of upright dealing, herein we see by the curse upon them, which would set in or
out the bound at their pleasure, f Cursed be he that remoueth his neighbors
mark: what a care man had hereof, we see g Deu. 27. 17.
by the laws and constitutions made for this purpose; for not only the Canon
law takes order for perambulations, but there is a writ in England de
perambulatione facienda. Even among the heathen there was an Idol or god
Terminus, whom they supposed to have the preeminence over bounds of lands, to
him they dedicated a Temple, which always had a hole in the roof, to show the
bounds of land should not be covered or hid, and besides this, they were wont,
as Siculus Flaccus says, to put under bounds either ashes or coals, or
potsheards or broken glasses, or burnt bones or lime or plaster; and therefore
Mr. Cambden in his Britannia is of this mind, that a certain little hill or
barrow near Lilborre in Northhamptonshire, was some bound, for that when men
dug into it, upon a conceit to find great riches, in stead of gold they
found coals, and exijt ridiculus mus, and he is rather induced to be of this
opinion, for that Saint Augustine writing of coals says: Nonne miranda res
est, etc. is it not a strange thing that coals, which are so weak, that they
are broken with the least stroke, and crushed in pieces, if you do but tread
upon them, should nothwithstanding never be worn out in any age, which was the
cause that they which set up bounds, were wont to put coals under them, for if
a troublesome fellow, says Saint Augustine, should rise up in succeeding ages,
and standing in contention should say, that the bound set up, were not the true
bound, he might be convinced hereby, when by digging they found coals under
it: that we run not into this fault, we must remember the Proverbs, Feed
within thy teather, cut within thy leather.

There are others who break this Commandment by taking pledges when cruel
covetous misers will take for pledges those things, with which poor men get
their living, or which they cannot lack without danger of life and health: the
first of these Job lays to the charge of the wicked, Deu. 24. 6 17.
they lead away the Ass of the fatherless, and take the widows Ox to
pledge: with the latter Elyphaz, though most untruly, charge Job 24. 3.
Job himself, Thou have taken the pledge from thy brother for Job. 31. 19 20.
naught, and spoiled the clothes of the naked: this was one of the Job 22. 6.
transgressions of Israel, for which God would not turn to it: Amos 2.
they lay down upon clothes laid to pledge by every Altar: First they take
any thing, not having respect to the necessity of the party that parts from
it, whereas by the law n Deu. 24 10. 11.
they should stay the deliverance, and take that which might best be spared:
Secondly Ex. 22. 26
they lay down upon it: and so keep it longer then the law will allow:
Thirdly, they use it as their own, and that publicly, even in their solemn
Feasts: this is a kind of theft, of which this Commandment does make
restraint.

Others break this law by taking and making unlawful gain in bargaining: as
the buyer, when to have a thing under value, will say, Pro. 20. 14.
it is naught, it is naught but when he comes home, be praises his penny
worth: the seller, when to fetch the buyer off, will lade him with deep and
unseasonable prices, when he will make him pay dear for days, when he will
conceal the fault of that he sells, when with fair words, false measures,
light weights, forsworn valuations, adulterate wares he shall empty his purse
to fill up his own: to avoid this fault we must use that simplicity and
plainenes in buying and selling which was between Genesis 23. 15. 16.
Ephron and Abraham: for the one in few words tells the true value what the
thing is worth, and the other, letting pass the vain words and idle oaths,
which commonly pass between us in the like exchanges, presently tenders the
money.

This is another kind of theft when a man shall keep hacke that which of
right belongs to another, as when he shall deny unto his Leu. 6. 2. 3.
neighbor that which was taken him to keep, or that which was put to him of
trust, or that which he has found, or that which is strayed into his ground or
that which he has gained by false reckoning, or that which is worse, when he
shall keep back the wages of his hired servant, for this is one of the four
sins which cry to God for vengeance.

Clamitat in calum Genesis 4. 10

And it is worth the observation, that God is never called the Lord of Hosts
in the New Testament, but when Saint Jaws makes mention of this sin, to show
that, though he may wink at many other sins, yet to be avenged of this, he
will awake as a man out of sleep and as a Giant refreshed with Wine. I will
not speak here of bad Exequutors, which keep back the right from poor
Orphants, which never knew the price of their father, who (when they should
become the heirs of the fathers affection, and the burden of his cares, when
they should bring up his children in instruction and information of the Lord,
and deliver them their portions in due season) never regard with what licour
they season them: like Vultures they prey upon the dead, and as the Phanix rise
on others ashes: these and the like thefts, though they may be committed
closely, and the world takes not like notice of these den thieves* as it does
of those which as wild Asses in the Wilderness go forth to their business and
rise early for a prey; yet God will reprove them, and set before them the
things which they have done: God and a good conscience detesteth close evils:
Moses and the Craftsmen might have made a privy gain of such offerings as the
people would have brought for the Tabernacle, but this they thought no good and
honest course, and therefore, when they saw that the people offered themselves
willingly and their hands had ministered enough, and more then enough, they said
not still, as those rulers in Hosee Hos. 4.
bring ye: nor cried as the daughters of the Horseleach* in the Proverbs Pro.
30. 15. 16.
give give: they were not like the grave, the barren womb, the earth and the
fire which never say, it is enough though they might closely have licked their
own fingers with the overplus but on the contrary side, they cried Ex. 36. 6.
Hoe, and caused proclamation to be made, that neither man nor woman should
prepare any more work for the oblation of the sanctuary: so the people were
stayed from offering: they said in effect, as the Lord to the Angel in another
case 2. Sam. 24 16.
it is sufficient, hold now thy hand: and now I hold my tongue from further
speech of this vice, and come to those who are both thieves to themselves and
to others, and these are the idle loyterer and common gamster. The loyterer
says Pro 6. 10.
a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: in
the shortest days he will have the Sun witness of his rising, loving to keep
his bed warm, not so much for will to sleep, as unwillingness to dress
himself, but Solomon tells his fortune k the sleeper shall be clothed with
rags: by doing nothing, he brings himself to nothing: thus is he a thief to
his own estate, who getteh naught, as much as the spendall who wastes all: In
like manner he does rob others while he lives by the sweet of others sweat:
this would Paul insinuate when he would have those which work 2. Tim. 3. 12.
not at all, to work with quietness and eat their own bread: as if he should
say, they which work not, eat not their own bread, but eat up other men's
stoare, as the Drones the Bees honey, Genesis 42. 7.
and the seven thin ears, the seven full ears of corn, let every one
therefore walk diligently in the vocation whereunto he is called: every one
must be a factor, occupy till I come, man is borne unto labor, therefore
nulladies sinelinea: let the tradesman keep his shop, the seaman his ship,
let the dresser of the Vineyard say I will dig about it, let the shepherd
follow the Ewes great with young, let the husbandman sweat his brows, the
scholar his brains, let every one go forth unto his labor until the
evening and if necessity compel, encroach upon the night for time, let labor
and sweat, hunger and thirst be spices to season and relish our meats: if we
be dumb shows on Gods stage, false lights in his house, blankes in his
Calendar, ciphers in his Arithmeticke, mutes in his Grammar, idle in his
Vineyard, if work be the greatest torment we can dream off, we rob our selves
we rob others, and do as much loose the cords of the commonwealth as they
which take pain, raise up the pillars of it: if we will take rest or recreate
our selves, we must as well measure our case as our pain: Christ permits
his Disciples to ease themselves, but limiteth the permission Mar. 6. 35
Rest awhile.

The common gamster is also a bird of this feather, and therefore Solomon
reading his desteny says, Pro. 21. 17
he that loves pastime shall be a poor man: a sweet tooth and velvet mouth
make some begger-bare: disease or pennery is the best end of aduletrers, and a
gamesome hand does as soon impouerish a man, as a lickerous tongue or a wanton
eye, but some will say they pick out a pretty living by play, indeed they
cannot use a fitter term, for now they pick and prey upon others, but let
them cast their account and in the end they shall find, that they put their
winnings into a broken bag, and may say of such gettings as Nabucadnezzar did
of his dream. I had a dream, but Dan. 2. 8
the thing is gone from me, and of all goods they which are thus gotten may be
said moveable, for that they are like the clouds which fall as they climbed,
and therefore make not an occupation of play and pastime, God in the beginning
did not make man for disport, who would have him work in his Paradise, and
when men were multiplied upon the earth, he never said, feast and play, but
fast and pray, and though thou may sometime recreate thy self, (for a bow
to much bended may break) yet make not an habit, no not of generous delights,
much less of base disports: make not an habit of Card-play: make not a habit
of Dice-play, thou shall pick thine own or another purse, thou shall hurt
thy conscience, lose thy time, look ou^^ pale with fear to lose, or be
ouerhot with desire to win, thou shall fret and fume, disquiet thy self, make
thy heart shake within thee, and rage as if thou went bit with a mad dog,
and therefore if thou have been to much addicted to this vanity, leave off,
and know for a surety that the best cast at Dice is to cast them quite away.

I speak not here of a greedy desire of other men's goods which the Scripture
comprehends under theft, and therefore though Judas did not steal yet
because he would have had the price of the ointment come ^o his bag, he is
accounted Ioh. 12. 6
noe better then a thief, and therefore let every man cleanse himself of this
sin, and draw gold out of the heart, as cunning Alcumists draw it out of
the earth, and now I draw to an end of the prohibition, and come to the
iniunction which is the second stream that issues from this fountain, and a
bough into which this law does branch it self.

The first virtue therefore which this Commandment requires is contentation:
we must learn with Paul in what estate soever we are therewith to be content,
if we sustain want, we must not by unlawful means seek to enrich our
selves, but bear poverty with patience: A rich man which loses that he has
is not so happy, as he that has nothing to loose: again, the blessings that
poverty brings, ouermatch the evils and discommocities that come with it: say
a poor man's fare is homely, yet it is wholesome, and better relished to him
then dainties to the rich, because it is sawced with hunger which is a better
spice then the other has, optimum cibs condimentum fames and an Onyon pleases
him better then an Olive, say his lo^ging is not soft, yet his sleep is sound,
say his apparel be plain, yet it keeps out cold, say he labors and takes
pay n^. yet his life is quiet, his mirth is free, he is witkout fear, without
care, without suspicion: say he drinks no Wine not strong drink, now he is
not troubled with the Gowte, say he does not barrel up in his belly that
variety of Gods creatures which other d^e, now he does not ^urfet with excess:
we are here trauailers to the spiritual Canaan Genesis 28. 20.
and with Jacob must be content, if God give us bread to cate, and clothes to
put on. We are here as on a sea, and must be content, if we have but water
enough to carry the ship: Why should we desire other men's goods, and seek to
get them by hook and by crook, seeing we shall carry with us at last nothing
but our winding sheet; why should we encroach upon other men's land, and seek
quouis iure, quauis iniuria, to join land to land, since at last we shall have
but each of us seven foot of earth? God has cast every man's lot, if the lot
does not fall to one in so good a ground, as it does unto another, or in so
plentiful manner, yet seek not to better it by entering upon another man's
right, but be content with the portion which is allotted, for as the greatest
evils are beneath our sins, so the least favors are above our deserts.

The second virtue required is restitution: The best thing is to do no man
wrong, and the second best is, to make him amends: and therefore the law
required restitution of stolen goods, whither a man had stolen Ex. 22. 1.
either great beasts of the heard, or small beasts of the flock, neither did
it only compel him to make restitution, which had robbed another, Ex. 22. 5.
but him also which had any way damnified his neighbor, and not him only
which had damnified another, but him also, r Ex. 21. 33
which had any way been a cause of his impouerishing: and if you will have all;
take nine together in these two old verses,

Iussio, consilium, consensus, palpo, recursus:
Participans, mutus, non obstans, non manifestans.
A good man cannot take taste in goods wrongfully gotten, it takes away the
contentment of the thing, to think when, and by what means he came to it, and
though Genesis 43. 21
Jacobs sons were not faulty this way, yet they could not be quiet, till
they had carried back the money, which they found in their sackes mouths:
therefore Genesis 12. ^9
Pharaoh restores Abraham his wife, therefore Luc. 19. 8
Zachee righteth those, whom he had wronged, and repaieth them with the usury,
which he himself would not take.

Diseases of the body are healed by contraries, so are the soars of the mind,
covetousness by liberality, whoredom by chastity, oppression by restitution,
this is as the Prophet speaks an Dan. 4. 24
healing of the error, neither is there any other way to cure it according to
that saying:

Non tollitur peccatum, nisi restituatur ablatum.

Wrong offered is an impostume, contritum pricks it, confessum lets out the
filth, restitution lays on the plaster, this is vnica tabula post
naufragium, the only board whereby with Act. 27. 44
Paul's company we escape shipwreck: this is that which Theodorie told a Baily
of his, who like the Luc. 16. 6
unjust Steward had made an unlawful gain of his masters goods: A serpent,
says he, finding a viole full of wine, went in at the mouth of the glass, and
sucked it up, and now being all belly and stuffed like a Tun he could not get out:
the owner of the glass coming, and seeing what was done, thus he says,
miser, euome quod hausists, etc. thou art now in a pitiful case, the way to
get out and save thy self is, to cast up which thou have sucked up, and
therefore as the chains did fall from Peter's hands, and then he a Act. 12. 7.
came out of prison: so let the chains of covetousness with which our hands
and hearts are bound fast fall from us, then shall we make free restitution:
But as every one is not a good archer, which can draw a strong bow, which has
a fair loose, which can shoot far, for all this a man may do, and yet not
shoot near the mark, so a man's hands may restore his substance, yet his hands
may miss the mark, and his good deed be like a good tale marred in the
telling, and therefore as Paul takes the Christian before his race and gives
him this watchword, q 1 Cor. 9. 24.
so run: so that this good deed may be well done, that a man may do iustum
just, let me tell him to whom, and when he must restore.

Some restore ill gotten goods, but as though they had mistaken the party, they
rappe at the wrong door: Judas when ^ Mat. 26. 48.
he had wronged Christ did not make him amends, but restores the money to the
Temple, some utterly spoil and undo their neighbors, by usury, by extortion,
by racking of rents, by enclosing of commons, and then with the superfluity of
their sin, they will build an Almes-house, and if they have spoiled many and
made them beggars, now they will keep some, and relieve them with the
plasters of their bounty: but as if one wrong us, we do not seek to right our
selves upon another, for then we take the wrong sow by the ear, and are much
like the fool, which smites his next fellow, so if we wrong any, we must
right the party wronged, else we rob Peter and pay Paul: Justice goes before
mercy, and as justice gives d Mi. 6. 8.
of it own, so it gives every one his own, it gives it (according e Leu. 6. 5.
the Commandment) unto him to whom it pertains.

Others will make restitution, but they will linger like Lot, f Ge^. 19 16
they will do it in their last will and testament. I knew a man, who among
other legacies gave two thousand pounds to satisfy those, which could make any
just proof that he had wronged them, better late then never, but better soon
then thus late, gratia, quae tarda est, ingrata est gratia, restitution after
death is lead, in sickness is silver, but in health is gold, and therefore with
Zachee make present pay, in this case let our own hands g Luc. 19. 8
be our exequutors, and before we die, let us see this will proved before our
face, propo^tioning our restitution at least, according to the wrong we
offered, else are we deceitful upon the balance, and false balances are an
abomination unto the Lord, but a perfect weight pleases him. Herein we must
observe the measure of tantum quantum, and observing the times toties quoties,
deliver a tot quot: and as Peter Pro. 11. 1 Mar. 14 68.
who denied thrice, Io. 21. 15
confesses thrice as Paul Act. 26. 11
who persecuted more then they all, 1 Cor. 15 10.
labored more then they all, and as ^ Cro. 33. 12.
Manasses made the prison of Babylon run with tears, 2 K. 21. 16
who had caused the streets in Jerusalem to flow with blood, Luc. 7. 38
as Mary who sinned much wept much, so they which have robbed often, must
restore often, and they which have done much wrong, must make much
satisfaction; this is the revenge of a Christian, which a Sain Paul speaks h
2 Co. 7. 11
of, this is according to John Baptists counsel, to bring forth fruits b Mat
3. 8.
worthy amendment of life; this is as Daniel speaks, to break of c D^^ 2 24
our sins by righteousness; this is not to go the same way we e Mat 2. 12
came (according to the (...) 13 9
charge given to the man of God) but with the wise Men to return into our
Country another way.

The ninth Commandment.
Exodus 20. 16. Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
THe Philosopher said, that man is (...) a little world in the great, and the
holy Ghost says, that the tongue is a great world in the little: Ia. 3. 6.
A world of wickedness, an unruly evil, full of deadly poison to govern this
world, and to rule this unruly evil, as nature has fenced it in with a double
bar, so the law has made for it a bitte and a bridle, by setting down a
double restraint: A bitte, thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God
inuaine: therefore let not thy tongue rent and tear God in pieces, or cast up
choler against his Majesty: A bridle in this place, Thoushalt not bear false
witness against thy neighbor: therefore sit not and speak against thy brother,
poysen him not with the venomous sting of thy tongue, whet not thy tongue like
a sword, nor shoot for thy ar^ owes bitter words.

Thou shall not bear, etc. As Abraham sinned both by his speech, and by his
silence, and therefore Pharaoh expostulating the matter with him, blames him
for both, for his speech, Genesis 12. 18. 19.
why saidest thou (speaking of Sarah thy wife) she is my sister: for his
silence, wherefore did thou not tell me, that she was thy wife? so do
men transgress this law, both by speech and by silence: by speech publicly or
privately, publicly when in open assemblies, or at Judgment seats a child of
Beliall shall come forth, and give false evidence, an unconscionable Counselor
shall plead and further a bad case, a Jury shall pass a wrong verdict.

The giver in of false evidence, because he cuts the throat of all good
proceedings, and is the beginner and first cause of turning Justice topsie
turuy, worthily deserves the first place.

This man slaieth as much with his tongue, as the bloudsucker with his sword,
and therefore the holy Ghost couples them together in the Prohibition, Thou
shall keep thee far from a false matter, and Ex. 23. 7
shall not slay the innocent and the righteous: The two wicked men that
witnessed against Naboth in the presence of i Kin 21. 13
the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the King, they were the men
that cast him, for upon their false accusation he was stoned to death.

God to restrain this sin would have those to execute the punishment, which
did bring the accusation, for many men's tongues are a two ^dged sword, and some
will wound him with their words, whom they dare not touch with their fingers,
and therefore if any did accuse any man of such or such a crime, the law did
bid them take heed what they did, for if their tongues did cast any man, their
hands should execute the punishment: If they cahrged any man with Idolatry,
because the Idolater must be put to death, Deu. 17. 7
their hands shall be first upon him to kill him, and then the hands of all the
people: l Ioh 8. 7.
If they accused any of adultery, they like the accusers in ^ the Gospel,
should throw the first stone.

2. The punishment which the law of God inflicted on this sin, is sufficient
to restrain it, for he which did falsely accuse another of any crime, should
endure the punishment, m Deu. 19. 19.
which the other should have incurred, if he had been found guilty, as if he
accused any of adultery, if the party accused could be proved clear, the
accuser (because adultery was death by the law) should dye himself, which
judgment we see executed upon the two Elders in the Story of Susanna; God
will not suffer this sin to go unpunished, and therefore, though Haman, who
oppressed the innocent n Est 3. 8. ^.
Jews with false accusations and lies, that they might be rooted out and
destroyed, was not for those unjust and slanderous speeches put to death, yet
was he oppressed himself and falsely accused of a fact which deserves the
Gibbet: for his intent was not to force the Queen, when he fell down at her
beds feet or couch whereon she sat, but to make supplication for his life,
when he saw the mischief was toward him, howbeit the King taking and making
the matter worse then he meant it, will he (says the King) Est. 7. 8.
force the Queen also before me in the house? marry hang him: so they
covered Hamans face and hanged him on the tree, that he had praepared for
Mordecai.

3 Whereas a man may deal against his neighbor two manner of ways, either by
way of denuntiation and telling him of his fault and in this case one man is
sufficient, Mat. 18. 15. 16.
if thy brother trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between
thee and him: or else by way of accusation, and in this case there must be two
at the least, neither should one Deu 17. 6
witness be sufficient to condemn a man, or rise against Deu. 19. 15.
him for any trespass or for any sin, or for any f^ult he offended in, but
two or three should concur together, tha^ every one might be circumspect what
testimony he gave, least any one should be found a false witness, if, as at the
passion of Christ, the witnesses agreed not together: let not therefore the^
which are produced as witnesses in any kind of trialls, by perjury sin
against God in dispising his presence, sin against man by taking away his
life, his goods, or good name, sin against the Jury, by leading them into by
paths out of the Kings high way, nor sin against the Judge in deluding him
with falsehood and lies, but without hope of gain or fear of punishment,
without favor on the right hand, or malice on the left hand, let every one
speak the truth from his heart: sell not the truth like Judas, deride not the
truth, like the thief on the left hand, testify not against it, as the Jews
at the passion of Christ, neither conceal it, as did the keepers of the
Sepulcher being corrupted with money, but speak the truth and nothing but the
truth, refraining thy tongue from evil, and thy lips that they speak noe
guile. That Lawyer who pleades a bad cause, and knows it to be a had cause, is
the second person who runs into the public breach of this Commandment,
neither is there any great od^es betwixt doing of a wrong and maintaining it,
and therefore the Scripture condemns as well s him that shall put his hand
with the Ex. 23. 1.
wicked, as him that shall give a false report.

The Lawyer should be a true glass, and by him should judge and Jury see the
truth of the cause, as it is, but if with his smooth tongue and good utterance
he makes falsehood have ^ore show of truth then truth it self, he is a
Crystal glass, which howsoever il favored ^ man be will show a fair face:
I speak in the honor of good pleading, where by mere Narrations, men unfold
the equity of the cause, when truth stripping her self naked comes to the
bar, this is a thing most honorable, but false glasses and glosses varnishing
and garnishing, false bodies and counterfeit colors are staynes and blemishes:
I speak not against plausible speech, let men martial their words the sooner
to overthrow a badde cause and to win the truth, but let not a rotten cottage
be well hanged: let a fair body have a well fashioned garment, smooth thy
self at Tullies glass, speak not only scripta, but sculpta, make not a good
cause har^h to the hearers by slubbering it up in rude and careless words, but
never set a good coat on a misshapen, body never garnish a ragged house with
fair paintings, if the cause be bad, let not thy speech be full of florishes,
like the first letter of a Patent to better it, seek not to lead Judge or
Jurors out of the way with a golden chain, which comes from thy tongue to
their ears, let thy eloquence, Rhethoricke and Art of persuading serve only
for Clyents of truth. Again the Jurors publickely break this law, when they
being corrupted shall give up a false Verdict, when they do not enquire
diligently of the fact, and truly relate to the Judges what they find that
they may do Justice and Judgment, ( Iudices n. apud no^ iuris solum, non
facti sunt iudices, Judges with us do not so much enquire of the fa^ whether
such a thing were done, as set down the law, what the fact deserves, if it
were done: to refrain this sin, even the law of our land does punish it with
great severity, for if but one Iurour in any inquest shall take money of one
party or the other to give his verdict, there lies a Writ against him called
D^cies tantum, and he shall pay ten times as much as he received, but if a
false verdict given by twelve men be found, the 12. men be attaint and their
judgment shall. be this, their Meadows shall be ared up, their houses broken
down, their Woods turned up, and all their Lands and Te^ements forfaited to
the King.

Lastly, Judges they must hear and consider, and then after give sentence
because they represent Gods own person: Be wise now therefore O ye Kings, be
learned ye that are Judges of the earth, let your skill in discerning be
answerable to your power in commanding: put on justice let it cover you, let
judgment be your robe and crown* though the mat^er be known, yet let the
party offending come to his answer that other may hear^ an^ fear, D^^. ^^. 21.
Joshua examines Achan and will have him confess that which he knows
already, if the matter be doubtful, commandment of God is, Deu. 13. 14.
thou shall seek and make search, and enquire diligently: this was Jobs
practice Job. 29. 16.
when I knew not the cause I sought it out diligently, God the Judge of all the
world would teach particular Judges of several circuits to prefer
consideration before conclusion, when he says Genesis 18. 21.

cognitae veritatis: say one man does accuse yet the matter may be doubtful,
P^tiphar cannot be excused, who upon the accusation of his wife cast Joseph his

agree in a controversy to decline after many and overthrow the truth Elihues
anger was kindled against Jobs three friends Job 3^. ^. 11. 12.
Eliphaz Bildad and Zophar, because they could not find an answer and yet
condemned Job: Behold says he, I did wait upon your words and harkened to
your knowledge, whiles you sought out reasons, yea, when I had considered you,
lo there was none of you that reproved Job nor answered his words. As Elihu
is to be commended in this, that he heard all parties, as Kin. 3. 16.
Solomon did the two harlots, and then blamed the accusers, who would condemn
a man yet could not answer him, so Pilate is to be condemned, who did not
oppose himself against the accusers of Christ, but to please the people
condemned the innocent, for though he sought means to deliver Christ, first by
comparing him with Barrabas, secondly by delaying the sentence, thirdly by
pronouncing him guiltles, what Man. 15. 12. 14.
evil has he done^ yet because the high Priests accused him, the Elders did
witness many things against him, the people cried out for judgment, he forgot
to put on righteousness on the right hand or on the left, in that against his
own conscience, he loosed the wicked and condemned the innocent.

Sometime there is no evidence, yet many times the party but suspected is
guilty, in this case wise Solomon found out the truth by making show of
dividing the living child: I read of a Judge, who having sundry persons
conuented before him, among whom it was well known, that one must needs be
guilty of a murder that was committed, and yet no sufficient proof to
convince any one; laid his hand on every ones heart, and at last found him
guilty, whose heart did butte and pant more then the rest, for an accusing
conscience did work some distemper within him: I know this is no sufficient
argument to condemn any man, except it be a means to wring from him his own
confession, yet is it as strong to argue a man guilty, as that in Tully, to
prove the two young men guiltless of a murder committed in their chamber,
because they were found quietly asleep in the morning: Now as a man may be
guilty, though there be no sufficient proof to convince him: so he may be
guiltless, though evidence be brought against him: false witnesses may rise
up, and lay to his charge things that he knows not: and therefore let Judges
hear and consider, and give sentence: let them try the spirits of accusers,
whither they be of God or no; happily they may be of the same spirit that James
and John were, who desired vengeance, Luc. 9. 54. Mat. 26. 59.
and with the high Priests, may rather seek to put a man to death, then desire
to have the truth known: let them be like the Grecians, who when they were
v^ged to give ouerhasty sentence, answered, Patres suos apud Antipodes solemn
non vidisse, sed semper expectasse donec and ipsis oriretur. Life is precious,
1 Kin. 2. 18. etc.
all that a man has will he give for his life, pull not men from it with
violence, as Ioab from the horns of the Altar: cut not off the limbs, except
it be well known they lack blood and life, as you would say, and also hurt
other parts of the body.

Again, this Commandment is broken by speech privately, when men either shall
report the truth to a bad end, as those malicious flatterers, which come and
accuse the Jews of ingratitude and rebellion, or else report that which is
false, Dan. 3. ^^
either of themselves (when they shall too much magnify themselves, and boast
of those gifts they have not, or on the other side too much vilify themselves,
and extenuate the gifts they have) or of others, when they shall disgrace worth
by malice, or smoothe and grace unworthiness by flattery, ^^uour or affection:
the Prophet Esaias dislikes both sorts, as well Esa. 5. 20.
condemning those, which speak evil of good, as those which speak good of
evil: the first sort which speak evil of good, are liars and slaunderers, of
which some rob the renown of the dead, other sack the good name of the
living: the first sort are like Hyenae that woluish beast, which vntombes the
bodies of the dead, that he may feed himself with putrified flesh like the
dogs, not the dogs which did li^ke the sores of Lazarus to heal them, but the
dogs which did eat Iezabel by Luc. 16. 21. 1 King. 9. 35.
the walls of Israel, and like the Raven who having found the dead carcass
does rest upon it, such a one gave occasion of the proverb (...), because they
are the scourge of the dead, while they delight to die their tongues in their
blood: on the one side therefore paint not the Sepulcher of the deceased with
false colors, in giving him that tribute which belongs not unto him; make him
not white as snow, that was as black as the black Horse in the Revelation, as
now and then a black Reu. 6. 5.
prophet, will for a black gown, on the other side, bury that with him which
was blameworthy, repeat it not either to blot the name of the dead, or
disgrace his kindred he left behind him: much less make his good evil, by
setting thy foot on his carcass.

Others sack the good name of those which be alive Ier. 9. 3.
they bend their tongues like their bows for lies, Psalm. 11. 2
Then they make ready their arrows upon the string Psa. 120. 3.
even mighty and sharp arrows, which will pierce like the quills of a
Porcupine, these they shoot sometime against those that are present as Eliphaz
does against Job: thus and thus thou have done, Job. 22. 6.
Thou have taken the pledge from thy brother for naught, and spoiled the
clothes of the naked, etc. Sometime against the absent, as Haeman in his
Oration against the Jews, who lets his tongue run too much at liberty, that
they might be rooted out to avoid this sin; let the accuser with the wise
Man, affirm no more H^s. 3. 8.
then he knows; with the good man, no more then stands with charity, but if
his tongue like the clacket of a Mill will still be wagging, if he does what he
can to grind to powder the good name of his neighbors; let the accused learn
to make this use of an enemy, so to live, as no credit shall be given unto him.

They which make evil good, are either the inferior sort which smooth
unworthiness by flattery, whose tongs are willing slaves to other men's ears,
and so as they may speak that which can please, much regard not how little
truth is in their words: such were those parasites who did gather about Herod
when he made an Oration, and as though nothing proceeded from him unworthy of
admiration Act. 12. 22.
gave a shoute, saying, the voice of God and not of man: There Math. 9. 23.
were Minstrels about the dead maid, so let great men be dead in trespasses and
sins, yet shall they have Trumpetors to sound out their commendation: the very
spots of Cato were beauty, and if any objected drunkenness unto him, Citius
efficeret crimen honestum, quam turp^m Catonem: to avoid this sin, praise
not every action as good, nor the best too much, and in presence.

As the meaner sort soothe and smoothe, and with Nephthali, Genesis 49. 21.
give goodly words, blessing with their mouths those whom God accurseth, so
the richer sort for favor and affection will be heralds to blaze the praise
of those which deserve it not, and so are found false witnesses. God forbid
(says Job to his friends, when he knew them faulty) Job 27. 5.
that I should justify you: so should every great man say, when he is
solicited to speak or write in a bad man's cause: God forbid that I should
justify the wicked, I were as much to blame to justify the wicked, as to
condemn the innocent, I will testify the truth, Job 27. 3. 4
so long as my breath is in me, and: he spirit of God in my nostrels, my lips
surely shall speak no wickedness, and my tongue shall utter no deceit. And
thus much of the breach of this commandment by speech, it is broken by
silence, either in suffering, when we shall lend our ears without reproof to
those which shall give false report, either of our selves, or of others, or
secondly in doing, when (though our voice be not heard) we shall vilify our
neighbor either outwardly by our gesture, or inwardly in our heart.

Men give false report of us two contrary ways, either by untrue commendation,
or unjust accusation: the first sort are flatterers, which will commend in us
those qualities we have not, or too much extol those we have, which will
commend all our actions as good, and the best with wondering interiections,
which will make us believe we know not our own worth, and bless themselves
with both their hands, if any thing proceed from us worthy, but mean
commendation: We must not give ear to these claw-backs, but stop their
passage, and bend our brows upon excessive praise, never courting it otherwise
then it follows upon good courses. There be three special reasons which
should move us to open our lips, and reprove these kind of persons: some of
them level at their own profit, their Art is nothing but delightful
cousenage; the Fox in the Fable commends the Crow, to see if he can make him
open his mouth and let fall the prey; these men will spend their tongues to
maintain their teeth; they are Moathes which will cate out a liberal man's
coat, Vines which will creep to the stakes that stand by them, not for love
to the stakes, but to uphold themselves; therefore Antishenes would say, it
were better for a man to fall among Ravens then among flatterers, for Ravens
will eat none but the dead, but these will eat out a man while he is alive.

Some of them intend mischief, as the Pharisees, who like Barge-men look one
way when they row another, who under enticing baits have entangling hooks,
who in propounding a question to Christ concerning paying tribute, give him
great commendation that they may the sooner entangle him in Math. 22. 16.
his answer. Joseph's words to his brethren were rough, but his meaning was
smooth, he carried a brotherly affection toward Genesis 42. 7.
them, but these men's words are soft as oil, when they be very swords: this
fawning hypocrisy, this Court holy water, this dishonest ciuility, this base
merchandise of words is nothing but gilded treason, carrying us up as they in
the Synagogue did Christ to the top of the hill, to throw us down ^uc. 4. 29.
headlong: therefore Diogenes being asked what beast biteth sorest, answered,
of wild beasts, a back-biter; of tame beasts, a flatterer; he is like the
luie, which kills with culling.

Lastly, all of them make us forget our selves, for pride seaaeth upon us, when
we are commended through flattery, as the two Elders did on Susanna, when she
was anointed with oil: therefore one says, if they among whom thou live,
do not commend thee, when thou deseruest well, they are in fault, but if they
commend thee, thou art in danger, for men are blown up with praise, as it were
with Gunpowder: the people in saying, after Herod had ended his Oration, Nec
vox hominem sonat, committed verbal symonie; so Herod depending on vulgar
breath, was too well conceited of himself, and robbing God of his honor,
committed sacrilege, therefore he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.
This flattery Act. 12. 22. 23.
what can it not? therefore Alexander the great, though at first he delighted
in those which said he was filius Iouis, yet being wounded with an Arrow at
the siege of a City, he regarded no longer the false colors of adulation,
with which others are tickled to death; therefore Canutus, a King of this Land,
about thirty years before the conquest, did break that false glass, which
presented him a face not his own; for when as one, to sooth him up, told him,
he was as God, and all things were at his beck and command, he caused his
Chair of estate to be brought to the Sea shore at Southampton, and as the
water flowed, thus he said, Tu me ^ ditionis es, etc. Thou art under my
dominion, never any one who disobeyed me, went scot-free* I charge thee enter
no further on my land, presume not to wet the robes or any member of me thy
Lord and Master. The Sea notwithstanding keeping it course, without doing any
reverence, wet the Kings feet: whereupon he giving back, said, The Lord is
God, and him only do winds and Sea obey: and after to know what he was, he
would give no credence to other. Thus if within thy self thou do not behold
thy self; if thou, who art most privy, and should be least partial to thine
own worth, restest on others commendation, and stand not on thine own
bottom, if thou can be silent when others flatter with their tongue, and
feed thee with the wind, thou consentest with those which against this law by
flattery bear false witness.

Contrary to these are another sort, whose tongues are ever walking in the
track of unjust accusations. Job would not be silent in this case, for if he
had held his tongue, it would have bin thought he had bin even such a one as
they said; therefore when Elyphaz charged him with cruelty, injustice, and
oppression, that he had spoiled the clothes of the naked, that he had not
given to the weary water to drink, that he had withdrawn bread from the
hungry, Job 22, 6. 7.
Job cleares himself, and says, he did not eat his morsels alone, the
fatherless did eat thereof, that the loins of those which wanted clothing,
blessed him, because they were covered with the fleece of his sheep: so when
Job 3^. 17. 20
Festus said of Paul, Thou art besides thy self, much learning does make thee
mad. Paul is as ready to make his Salve, as Festus is to give the wound: I am
not mad Act. 26. 25.
O noble Festus (says he) but I speak the words of truth and soberness.
Christ was a Lion and a Lamb, so is every Christian, patient as a Lamb to
suffer in his innocence, bold as a Lion to plead and defend it, not a Lion in
his conversation, nor sheepish when slaundered; he sets his foot by his, that
shall wrongfully accuse him: when his accusers, as busy as Flies, will light,
where there is no sore, his tongue shall be a flap to fray them away, and now
is his speech powdered with salt. Indeed Mary was accused three several times.
Luc. 7. 39.
The Pharisie accused her of presumption that being a sinner she would touch
Christ: Luc. 10. 40.
Secondly, Martha accused her of idleness, that she suffered her to serve
alone: Thirdly, Ioh. 12. 5.
Judas accused her of prodigality, that she wasted the ointment: she was
always patient, and put up all, she knew her self a stranger even at home,
and let the dogs of the world bark at her, she was a woman, and would be
seen and not heard, her sex required the more silence, besides her Savior did
at all times answer for her, according to that saying in another case: Exodus
14. 14
The Lord shall fight for you therefore hold you your peace.

Again, if any wrong other, by scandalous imputation, and open, their mouths
boldly to sound out detraction and slander, as some will sit and speak
against their Brother, and Psalm. 50. 20.
slander their own Mother Son; we sin by silence, if we do not with courage
bear out the accused, whom we know then Innocent, and therefore when Peter
heard that the Apostles were accused of Drunkenness as being full of new Wine,
his spirit was hot within him; and while he was musing, the fire kindled, and
at last he spoke with his Tongue. Act. 2. 15.
These are not Drunken, as ye suppose, since it is but the third hour of the
day, etc. If a malicious man be given to traduce a man's name, we cannot stop
his mouth from speaking ill, yet must we open our mouths to reprove him, else
lending him a willing ear we consent with him, and have been partakers with
the backbiter, bearing the Devil as much in our ears as the other in his
tongue, h^rting our neighbor as well by receiving as the other by giving out
and dispersing spiteful narrations, and therefore this giving forth and
receiving, in the Law are coupled together, or rather meet in one word, Exodus
23. 1.
Thou shall not report or receive a false tale: You will blame a Thief for
stealing, and will not you blame him that receives stolen goods? Were there
no Receivers there would be no Thieves: You will blame a man that robbes one of
his* good name, and will you not blame him that opens his ears to take in the
theft? There would not be so many to broach false rumors, were it not that
they see they please other men's taste: ye will blame him that robbes God of
his honor, else the Curse will come upon you which does upon the men of Meroz,
because they came not forth Judge. 5. 23.
to he^pe the Lord, to help the Lord against the mighty: blame him likewise
which wrongeth man by false report, wink not at his folly, smother not his
fault; do not swallow it, do not digest it; reprove such a man, tell him his
own; there is little difference Faueas ne scelus an illud fa^ias, if the
Backbiter shall see by thy face, that he has a room in thy heart, thou art
an abetter of evil, a Pander to his sin, a good Nurse of ill fame, a Wolf
to thy Brother, and in a word, possessed with a dumb Devil.

Again, other break this Commandment by silence, either outwardly in their
gesture, when indeed they do not scourge with their Tongue, nor speak words
like the prickings of a Sword, when they do not dig up evil, neither is
there in their lips like burning fire, but though they shoot not out the
venomous sting of their Tongue, yet they nippe men by their gesture, and spit
out their venom by the malicious carriage of their bodies, the Prophet
complains of such, Psalm. 22. 13
They gaped upon me with their mouths as it were a ramping and roaring Lion,
Psalm. 35. 15.
making mowes at me and ceased not, such were they Math. 27. 39
which wagged their heads as they passed by at the Passion of Christ, and
before that Ioh. 13. 18.
Judas who lift up his heel against Christ, and after that the Jews Act. 7.
54.
who gnashed at Stephen with their teeth, if we shall hiss or point at any
with our finger, or shake our heads against them without any offense or fault
of theirs, we disgrace them with this kind of gesture, and are a kind of
false witnesses while we make them vile in other men's eyes: or else we break
this Law inwardly in our heart, when though we neither whet our tongue like a
Sword, and shoot for our Arrows bitter words, though we shoot not out the
venomous sting of a reproachful gesture, yet we have a hard conceit of our
neighbor, when he deserves it not: Abraham faulted this way when he thought
the Aegiptians would have killed him, if they did but know that Genesis 12. 11.
Sarah was his wife: So did Joseph's Brethren, who though they saw that Joseph
was made of a metal not so hard as flexible, though he let all their injuries
go as they came, though he would not go beyond the word of the Lord, but
render them good, when they had rendered him evil, yet when their Father was
dead as though before that he made but small noise as the waters of Sil^^ at
the foot of Sion, because he was unwilling to trouble or grieve the Old man,
they thought he would deal more roughly with them, and pay them again all the
evil, that they had done unto him: So Gen 50. 15.
Pharaoh, though he had no cause to distrust the Israelites, yet he Exodus 1.
10.
thought they would watch a time, and set themselves against him when they
could find opportunity to rebel. Math. 9. 3.
So the blasphemous Scribes slaundered our Savior, because he said he had
authority on earth to forgive sins, but their malice against Christ caused
them to take all his sayings, all his doings with the left hand; whereas if we
have love, all our constructions are full of charity and favor: and if any
thing be spoken which may cari^e a double sense, our gloss shall not corrupt
the Text, we w^ll make a good exposition, if we have but a good disposition.

The tenth Commandment.
Exodus 20. 17. Thou shall not covet thy Neighbors house, etc.
THis Commandment is as the Sun-beame, in which the least mote may be
discerned; Paul had not known lust had been sin, except this Commandment
had said, Thou shall not lust; it plucks up every root, that it bring not
forth Gall or Wormwood, it breaks the Egg, that sin hatch not, with the
Physician it takes the Viper in the spring, and presently cuts it in pieces,
it shuts up every vain thought, as in an Ephah, and casts a Talent of
Lead upon the mouth of it, it speaks with our enemies in the gate, and with
Lot, will not suffer them to enter, it stops not the watercourse, but
dries up the fountains head, it kills the first begotten of the Devil, and
slayes Goliath by hitting him on the forehead: in a word, it is a sword which
cuts asunder the heart strings of every fleting imagination, though we yield no
consent, or cast and plod how to bring it into act.

The things forbidden us to covet, are set out
Particularly as that which our neighbor has at home his house. his household
his wife. his servants manserua^t. maid.


abroad, his Ox. his Ass.


Generally any thing that is his.
Thou shall not covet.] The other Commandments will not let Satan have a
chamber to dwell in the heart, this thrusts him out as soon as he looks in at
the door, and therefore the word used is inceptivum, to show that the very
first motion is sin, though no consent be yielded, though it conceiues not,
though it passes away like Lightning, which oritur, moritus, is but a flash
and away, though like a Post upon the spur, it stays not to drink at the
door, though presently we give it over, as the Physician does his Patient,
when he lies a dying. Here we see the perfection of Gods law, here need no
statute of Addition to keep man within the compass of his duty: Laws of men
look but into words, or prune only the outrage of evil actions, at most
they punish but the intent, and never that, except it be confessed, as the
Parliament of Paris put a Gentleman of Normandy to death, for that he
confessed to a Franciscan Friar, he was once minded to have killed King Francis
the 2. And therefore Sen^ca said, Quam a^gusta est innocentia ad legem bonum
esse; it is but half a man's hone^tie to be no better then the Law makes him,
but the Law of God cuts in sunder as well the cords of vanity, as cart-ropes
of iniquity, and is not only severe against the actions of ^u^ll, but against
the affections, condemning every idle thought, though it be concealed within
us, though it make not so long abode with us, as the small flies do by the
river Hipanis, which are bred in the morning, are in their full strength at
noone, and gone at night but though they be but as a Diuedapper, which peereth
up and is down again in a moment, though they be but as a dream, not Genesis
41. 8
Pharaohs dream, which he could remember to tell his Wisemen the next
morning, but Dan. 2. 5.
Nabuchadnezzars dream, which he had presently forgotten. This teaches us to
humble our selves before God, not relying on our own worth, but Gods mercy: A
good man happily may say for the fact, as the elder son, Luc. 15. 29
never brake I at any time thy Commandment; or as Paul, 1 Cor. 4. 4.
I know nothing by my self. And for his words, happily he may say with David,
Psalm. 39. 1.
I kept my mouth as it were with a bridle, and so with Job, Job. 2. 10.
not sin with his lips: but who can say My heart is clean, that, though
filled with the holy Ghost, has it blemishes, as the full Moon it dark
spots, therefore David having spoken of the righteousness of the Law, cries
out, Ps. 19. 12.
Who can tell how often he offends: O cleanse thou me from my secret faults
Job. 23. 4.
. Job is ouerseene when he speaks as though a righteous man might plead with
God, and make his farthing good silver; his friends tell him in effect, all he
faith is but prittle prattle, and if God should enter into judgment with him,
who did think so well of himself, he were not able to abide it, for though it
were so that he had brought forth no evil fruits in the boughs, yet God might
cut him down, because he was faulty at the root.

Thy neighbors house. Not naming house first, because we should set more by
the house, then by the wife, for God repeating this commandment Deu. 5. 21
in Deuteronomy, and setting down all things according to their due
estimation, puts the wife in the first place, Thou shall not covet thy
neighbors wife, neither shall thou desire thy neighbors house: but here for
orders sake, he sets down first contineus, then contentum, first the house,
then the householder, and in very deed, though a wife be prior honor, and more
to be esteemed, yet a house is prior tempore, and first to be provided, neither
will a wise man take a wife before he has a house, though some be so
indiscreet, that when they be single, they think they lack nothing but a
wife, and when they have a wife, they lack an house and all things besides.

House. God in his Law would not allow that a man should take for a Pledge any
thing in the house, which was necessary for sustentation of life and health
Deu. 24. 6.
: for this is to kill the borrower, he does but change the kind of death, as
if one should be in danger to be hanged with his own hands, one should come
and untie the rope, but yet cut his throat; if we must not take such a Pledge
in the house, much less the house it self. If a man did meet his enemies
Ass going astray Exo. 23. 4.
, he should bring him home to him again, then must he not make his neighbor
an Ass, turn him out of house and home and send him a begging. This
condemns such as never think themselves well seated while they dwell by
neighbors, and therefore depopulate Parishes, as though they would dwell alone
upon the earth. Zophar showing how Cormorants devour other, says, Job. 20. 19
they spoil houses which they builded not. As if he should say, their
predecessors had a care to set up houses, and were glad to have their poor
Tenants dwell by them, but their posterity, a preposterous and pitiles
generation, do pull down their houses, with down with them, down with them
even to the ground: Job speaks of such as Job. 3. 14.
builded themselves desolate places: not only meaning such as builded in
barren places, to get them a name, nor such as having builded houses, did leave
them desolate, but such as by pulling down neighbor houses did dwell alone,
like master-Hares, which are of this property, that if there be a bucke or a
female which keep one quarter commonly together, they will not suffer any but
their own young to sit by them, or abide near them. This has been noted as
a great fault in our Nation, and therefore Goropius thinks the English men
were called Angli, because they were good Anglers, and had skill to lay diverse
bayts, when they fished for other men's livings: which though it be not true
(for therefore were we called Angli, of a people so called, which came in with
the Saxons, who were numerosissimi and fortissimi, more for number, and
stronger for power, then the rest) yet has it a semblance of truth, for men
draw unto them other men's livings by hook and by crook, and devour houses,
even widows houses, as great fish devour the small: the fault and cause
hereof in Sr Thomas Moors Vtopia is laid upon sheep, which (as it is there
said) were wont to be Mites and exiguo ali, gentle, and contented with a little
food, but now are so great feeders, and so unruly, that (as it follows) they
eat up men, fields, houses, and lay whole Villages wast: insomuch, as some
market Town in our Country do take their names of the abundance of Cattle,
as, Shipston, and Kineton in Warwickshire, in or by the vale of Redhorse.

I know it is a great blessing of God when sheep do bring forth thousands and
ten thousands in our streets, for wool is the staple of the land, and one
means to raise up the pillars of it, but are not children a greater blessing?
the Prophet stampeth this blessing with an Ps. 127. 3.
Ecce, lo, children and the fruit of the womb are an heritage and gift that
comes of the Lord. In the Catalogue of Deu. 28. 4
Blessings, the fruit of the body is set before the fruit of the cattle, and
the devil tempting Job. 1. 16. 19.
Job by degrees, each temptation being greater then other, takes away the
sheep before the servants, and feruants before the children, is not man (says
our Savior Christ much) Mat. 12. 12
better then a sheep: does not the honor and strength of the King and the
kingdom consist in the multitude of subjects, let sheep therefore have their
coats and their foldes, but while sheep are penned in, let not men and
children be penned out, let sheep have their pasture, let Exodus 3. 1.
Moses feed the sheep of lethro: let Genesis 29. 10.
Jacob roll the stone from the wells mouth and water the flock, but let sheep
rather be as much abomination to us as Genesis 46. 34.
shepherds to the Egiptians, let a man rather nourish but one kowe and two
sheep, then so many flocks, as he cannot feed, except he pull down
neighbors houses, and joining land to land to feed them, give men as sheep
to be eaten up. The people under Moses charge were so many, that Moses says,
shall the sheep and the beeues be slain to feed Number. 11. 22
them: as if he should say, there are men enough to eat them up all, and shall
now the sheep be so many that they shall eat up the people. He that does but
dream of his neighbors living, and thinks his own habitation would be more
pleasant or profitable, if he could once wind out him that dwells near him,
though he presently nips this imagination as the frost the forward springs,
though he stops this stone at the top of the hill before it be in a violent
course, though he suffers not consent to hearten that which he does imagine,
nor his will resolve upon it, yet is he guilty of the breach of this law, and
therefore (to conclude this point) never say when thou see any thing fair or
commodious, as men commonly do, I would this were mine, but if thou be ready
to draw any thing thou see to an occasion of offending, stopp there as Job.
31. 7.
Job did, whose step turned not out of the way, whose heart did not walk
after his eye, but when it would be gadding, whither it should not, he did
presently daunt it with dislike.

Thou shall not covet thy neighbors wife. Our adversaries the Papists who take
away the second commandment, because it cuts a sunder the hart-strings of
their superstition, to fill up the number of Ten, devide this commandment into
two, so that thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, shall be the ninth, and
this concerning the wife etc. shall be the tenth, but Saint Paul conf^teth
them, who speaking of the law in general says, o the Romans 7. 12.
law is holy: and of that which forbids concupiscence in particular makes it
but one commandment, (...) with an emphasis is holy. iust^ and good.

Not covet thy neighbous wife: The greatest injury and indeed a wrong not to
be paralleled upon earth, is when the man shall break the faith plighted to
his wife, or the woman be false to her own bosom, God punished this sin in
Ge^. 12. 17.
Pharoh, and Genesis 20. 3
Abimelech, though God kept them that they came not nigh Abraham's c Genesis 39. 9
wife, and therefore when Putiphar committed all that he had into Joseph's
hand, he barred him of his wife, and in this case Xenophon was put to his non
plus, for being asked if his neighbor had a better house then he, whose he had
rather have, his or his own? he answered, his: if he had a fairer horse then
he, whose had he rather have? he answered, his: if he had a better or fairer
wife then he, whose had he rather have? hic Xenophon ipse tacuit: at this
Xenophon was silent: a man must hold his own wife for better for worse, so
long as they both shall live: corrupt affections like Eve lie in our bosom,
and will seduce us: unruly motions are to our understanding as Dalilah to
Sampson, they burn within us as brimstone at the match, let this law draw out
the burning venom of those fiery serpents that lurk in our hearts: if a man
be upon a horse that flingeth and kicketh, and does what he can to run over
all the field, the cunning rider will reine him up) and bring him to a good
pace, so a good Christian will ouer-master his passions, and suppress them,
when they are miscarried to rebel, he will direct humors to their right
courses, and draw the flood of affections into their own channel.

Wife: In that God setting down the household, goods, and chattles and all that
a man has, put the wife in the first place, I note that to be true which
Solomon says Pro. 31 10
the price of a virtuous woman is far above the pearls: which teaches first
the husband to love his wife more then any earthly thing: when Alexander had
overcome Darius, Darius seemed little to regard his estimation, if he were to
die, he seemed little to regard his life, but when he heard his wife was taken
prisoner, hincillae lacrimae, then his eyes did spout forth tears, as the
conduit waters, each tear did overtake other, he did ouerweepe his weeping,
and sighs did break from the center of his heart, as fast as the tears
stoale down his cheeks: again it teaches that of all other things a man
should not wrong his neighbor in his wife, as the wife of Hieron was
acquainted with no bodies breath, but her husbands, for when he (his enemy
casting in his teeth his stinking breath) blamed his wife, who never told him
of it, she desired him not to think the worse of her, for she thought every
man's breath had smelt like unto his: so on the other side, should the husband
be acquainted with no bodies breath, but his wives: she for her part must be as
the Marigold, which of all the Plants opens only to the Sun: let not him for
his part be as the sed horse, ^eigh after his neighbors wife, and croake in
the chamber like the froggs of Egypt, his eyes must be eyes of Adamant, which
will turn only to one point, let not his be wandering eyes, let him not make
the faces of other men's wives like glasses, which the Larke-taker has in his
day net, least while like the birds he gaze too much, he be taken in the net:
it is set down as one of 2 Samuel 11 4.
David's greatest faults, that suffering lust to enter in at the windows of his
eyes he gave way to his sin, till he did lie with the wife of Vriah, and
therefore set not the thoughts on fire by affection, much less follow the
lusts of the flesh, much less fulfill the lust of the flesh, much less
provoke the lust of the flesh, but put the axe of Gods judgments to the root
of wanton nature and cut it off, circumcise the foreskin of the heart, that is
the true circumcision, in the spirit not in the letter, whose praise is not of
men but of God.

Nor his manservant nor his maid: As well Solomon the divine, as Aristotle and
other Humane Philosophers in their Oeconomicks, set down not the wife and
servants only, but the children also; and God commanding to hallow the sabb^th
says, in it thou c Exo. 20 10
shall not do any work, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant,
nor thy maid: a question then may here be asked, why sons and daughters are
not mentioned as well as the wife, the manseruant and the maid: the reason I
take to be this: men are addicted either to their pleasure or their profit:
Pleasure, like ^yr^e, inchanteth the mind, transformeth men into swine, and
mastereth reason with sensuality, neither was it a greater miracle to see the
three children walk untouched in the midst of the fiery furnace, then to see,
how Joseph held his body short of pleasures in the present provocation,
therefore covet not thy neighbors wife, was a necessary precept: again for
profit, it is true which the Apostle says, Phil. 2. 21
All seek their own, and therefore like Martha they are Luke 10. ^0.
cumbred with much business, and are so far from serving one another Gal. 5.
13.
by love, as the Apostle advises, that as though they did enu^e that another
should have a better servant then they, they are ready to lay baits to draw
him to them, and therefore it was not without need, to say thou shall not
covet thy neighbors servant: but children are a charge to him that keep them,
must be led into wholesome pastures, because they be Gods lambs, watered because
they be the seed-plot of heaven, they must be kept clean, because they be Gods
vessels, and kept in, that after flowers of youth, may follow fruits of good
living they have no list in age to live as they should, which have liberty in
youth to live as they list, because men are loath to take this care and this
charge, therefore they never covet other men's children, nay they will hardly be
entreated to take another man's son or his daughter, nay let a father give
money with his child that another may take him, but as his apprentise, yet
hardly will he take him and teach him the trade of his way, and bring him up in
instruction and information of the Lord: in a word therefore as well sons as
servants are commanded to keep holy the Sabbath, because both sorts are ready
to transgress it, but none are forbidden to covet sons, as they are to covet
servants, because that without a prohibition men are ready to observe it.

Manseruant nor his maid: As God has made the servants lower then the wife,
so he has here given them place before the Ox or the Ass, which must teach
the master to make more reckoning of his servants, then of any Cattle he
keeps: he must have an especial care of their bodies, and of their souls;
of their bodies in sickness, and in health, in sickness not to let Gods
visitation be an excuse to discarde them, that so they may lie at Lu. 16. 20.
the gate with Lazarus, but with the good Mat. 8. 6.
Centurion, let them lie at home with them, and seek the best means they can
to recover them: in health, not to lay more on them then they are able to
bear, for a good man is Pro. 12. 10
merciful to his beast much more to his brother: 2. with the good householder
to give them their penny which labor in the Vineyard: 3. with the good
housewife to give Mat. 20. 9.
the portion to Pro. 31. 15
their servants, and ordinary to their maids: As he is careful for their
bodies, so he must labor to fashion their minds to goodness. Job. 11. 14
Zophar tells Job, it is not enough for him to serve God in his own person,
but he must see that no wickedness dwell in his Tabernacle: and therefore
David had a care to have Ps. 101. 4.
his household well reformed, and the care of John for his Disciples was at
liberty when he himself was bound in the prison: the reason that the Master
should have this ^ Mat. 11. 1.
care is very good, for as it is here said, they are his servants: and in
deed, Masters are not more their own, then their servants are theirs, and
therefore the faults of the Family reflect upon them, and the sins of their
servants are their reproach. Again, they of the family because they are
servants must serve, must with the laborers in the vineyard bear the burden
and heat of the p Mat. 20. 12
day, and when necessity requires, not suffer their eyes to sleep, nor
eyelids to slumber, but with Jacob incroach upon the night q Genesis 31. 40.
for him, they must not be like the servant in the Gospel, who r Mat. 24. 49.
plays Rex, as though he would throw the house out at window, but like those,
which are under the Centurion, which go when s Mat. 8. 9.
he bids them go, come, when he bids them come, which do this or that when he
bids them do it, neither must they be servants only, but men and not beasts,
mayds and not strumpets, there be many that will not eat the bread of idleness,
but eat the labor and fruit of their hands, who diligently and willingly put
their singers to their masters business, who knowing they are borne to labor,
as the sparks fly upward, rise up early and late take rest, gird their
loins, and strengthen their hands to work, but there is more force in one vice
they have, to disgrace all their pains, then in all their pains to maintain
that vice.

Nor his Ox nor his Ass. He has made a good step to perfection that can
say with Samuel 1 Samuel 12 3.
whose Ox have I taken, or whose Ass have I taken: but he that can say thus,
may yet say with the young man, Mat. 19. 21
what lack I yet, and with Elizabeth he has 1 Kin. 19. 7
a further journey to go: for the law of God is of such perfection, that it
not only binds the hand to the good abearing, that it take not, but the heart
that it covet not, condemning (...), though the motion dies in the conception,
and the grave preventeth the cradle.

Nor any thing that is his. The holy Ghost in the Epistle to the Romans,
having expressed many Commandments of the second Table, which forbid special
sins by name, at last comes in as it were with a statute of Additions, which
cuts off all in general, Ro^. 13. 9.
If there be any other Commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this
saying, even in this; Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self: so if God
has not set down every particular thing in this Commandment by express
name, which we are forbidden to covet, it is briefly comprehended in this
saying, namely; Thou shall not covet any thing that is his. Some will say, I
desire not my neighbors house, but he has a piece of land bordering upon my
ground, I would that were mine, but this is forbidden by flat statute, Deu. 5.
21
for Moses repeating the Law, says, Thou shall not desire thy neighbors
house, his field. And Mic. 2. 2.
Micah charge Israel with this, they covet fields: and 1. Ki. 21. 1.
Ahab is much blamed for that he was sick of Naboths vineyard, which lay near
to his house: but were it not expressly forbidden, yet it came within the
reach of this addition, Thou shall not covet any thing that is his. Another
says, I covet not my neighbors wife, happily he thinks he has too much wife
of his own, as that young man, who at first was in hand with his father to
give him two wives, his father because of his importunity, gave him one in
hand, promising at the years end to give him another, but when the year was
expired, he told his father, he had wife enough, and did find compact in a
little flesh a great number of bones, too hard to digest, and if other men's
were like unto his, they were all molten out of that salt pillar into which
Lots wife was transformed: neither does he happily covet any servant of his
house, but feign he would have some of his household stuff, his goods or
chattels; but Paul, who says, Be followers of me, does pattern against this,
Act. 20. 33
I have, says he, coveted no man's silver, nor gold, nor apparel; but were
there no particular example or law to the contrary, yet this prohibition meets
with it, Thou shall not covet any thing that is his: Our nature is ready to
find a starting hole to get out, when we have offended: sins and shifts are
borne at a birth, we will have a salve for every sore, as he that sels Anchusam
or Orchanet, complexion for every face: Saul says, 1 Samuel 15. 13.
I have kept the Commandment of the Lord: Mat. 25. 44.
they on the left hand say, they have ministered unto Christ, though they
neglected his members: and were it not for this closing up, some would say with
the elder son, Luc 15. 29
at no time brake I thy Commandment: therefore to prevent all pleas, the law
says, he has transgressed that coveteth not only this thing or that thing,
but any thing that his neighbor has: it is his, therefore hand of, that thou
do not take it: it is his, therefore heart of, that thou do not covet it.

Is his. There be some things in which man has a property, which makes
against (...), and community of the Anabaptists, and in deed, if all things
were common, what use could there be of charity, which the second Table
requires? How could the Commonwealth endure, who would labor and take pain,
if men's goods were mingled altogether, if there were not meum and tuum: indeed
in the primitive Church, Act. 2. 44.
the Disciples had all things common, but this community stretched no further
then to the relief of those that wanted: for whereas in these times, men are
given to hoard up, and like dogs devour, what they can catch, and gape
continually for more, so that this is true, Some all, some never a whit; (and
this, they say, is good in policy, lest equality should breed confusion, as
if there must needs be equality, if there were not so great inequality) in
those times it was other wise, for many (as Act. 4. 36.
Ioses is set down by name, as though he deserved better this way then the
rest) when they saw how hard the world went with the poorer sort, would relieve
them with their yearly revennewes, if that were not enough, they would sell
some part of their possessions, and moderately relieve the necessity of other,
according as they saw their want, not that all did this, that were accounted
Christians, or that they which did it were compelled to it, for Act. 5. 4.
Peter tells Ananias, that before he sold his possession, it was his, and
after it was sold, it was in his own power, he need not have sold it, or
put his money to the common use) or that S. Luke would urge us to take the very
same stitches out of their Samplers, and yet, as the inequality is divelish,
where one is ready to dye for want of meat, another is killed with surfeit and
excess, so that equality is always commendable, where the plenty of one
supplies the penury of another: When David stands in need of succor, Nabal is
too churlish to stand upon this, 1 Samuel 25 11.
My bread, and my water, and my flesh. In these times rich men would have all
waters fall into their sea, and yet their sea is not full; in those times
Aarons oil rested not on his head, but ran down upon his beard, and went
down to the very skirts of his clothing. Again, it is a common saying, which
Tully, in his first book De legibus, fathers upon Pythagoras, others upon
Plato, (...), all things should be common among friends; What then should there
be no enclosures, should no man have any thing private to himself? Aristotle
2o Politicorum, expounds the saying thus, That should be common for use, which
is proper to possess, so that which is one man's quo ad (...), should be other
men's quo ad (...); and indeed, as Joseph said to his mistress, My master has
not kept any Genesis 39. 9
thing from me, but only thee, because thou art his wife; so should no man
keep from other that he has, but upon reasonable terms let him have
according to his necessity, the use of it, except it be the wife, because she
is his wife, and this is a virtue enjoined by this commandment, for as we must
content our selves with our own estate, which is a preservative against
coveting that which is another man's, so must we have a desire to do our
neighbor good, which is a preparatiue to help him with that which is our
own. Exo. 17. 12
Aaron and Hur lent Moses their hands, when he was weary in holding up his
hands: Luc. 5. 7.
Peter's partners helped him with their Nets, when his own Net was broken; a
good man as he is no man's enemy, so is he not more his own, then another man's
friend; thus the Moon receiving light from the Sun, lets it shine unto the
world; thus the true lights of the firmament are still in motion for the good
of others, thus the heart receiving spirits from the liver, does minister them
to the brain, and the brain to other parts of the body. Nature has taught
the Dear to help one another in swimming; the Cranes one another in flying;
one stone bears up another in buildings contrived by art; nothing is made for
it self; and nothing is good unto us, except we communicate the same good unto
others, and therefore the Gal. 5. 13.
Scripture will have us servants to all, and God binds us unto it by force,
and draws us as it were by the hair of the head, in distributing to sundry
persons different graces, that they might mutually succor and interchangeably
help one another. Of the three 1 Cor. 13
Sisters which never part from one another sides, faith looks to God and his
Word, hope to his gift and reward, charity to the profit and commodity one of
another: God make our charity like the lamp of the Ex. 27. 20
Tabernacle, which always burned, and the fire of the Altar which never went
out; make our hope as the pillar of fire, which guided Israel to the land of
Ex. 13. 21.
Canaan; increase our faith till we receive the end of our faith, even the 1
Pet. 1. 9.
salvation of our souls, thorough Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with the
Father, and the holy Ghost, three persons and one everliving God, be given all
honor and glory, power, praise, and dominion, both now and for ever, AMEN.

FINIS.
