Sermo die lune in ebdomada Pasche



Ipse Ihu^s apropinquans ibat cu^ illis.
These Words ben contained in the xxiiij. chapter of Luke* and rad in the
holy gospel of this day. To say in englyssh tongue The same Ihu^s nyghynge
walked with mankind / This Joyous troth conteyneth in itself two parties /
In whoos declaracyon with our lordys mercy and your suffrau^ce. shall stand
the so^me of this poor collaco^n. The first is this / that the same Ihu^s
nyghed to mankind. The second is. that the same Ihu^s has wallryd with mankind
/ Of which two pryncyples follows as a conclusyon the intent o^ his nyghyng
and walking. That the same Ihu^s has brought mankind to the everlasting
rest of heaven / For sure it is. y^ this same Ih^^ of which I purp^^ to
treat. never put man to labor / but to the intent. that he should after his
labor have full rest, ye and for thorte labor have eternal rest / as after
shall appear. Yet or I descend to the declaraco^n of thise two parties / for
as much as I say. that the same Ihu^s nyghynge walked with mankind / I shall
show you of which Ihu^s I mean. which it was that nyghed to man that walked
with man. and that finally brought man to everlasting rest in heaven. Where
ye shall understand. that of diverse we read in holy scripture which were
named Ihu^s. of three in especyall / al men of noble memory. and of great
praysyng And but figures and servants of the same Ihu^s of whom with his
mercy. I purpoos pryncypally to trete. The first was) Ihu^s filius Naue (The
second was (Ihu^s filius Iosedec^) And the third was (Ihu^s filius) the sone
of Sirach / All these three. and each of this. was for his time y^ figure of the
fourth Ihu^s / called (Ihu^s filius dei) Jesus the sone of god / The same
Ihesus which nyghynge. walked with mankind / To whose declaraco^n ye shall
understand. that Ihu^s by interpretaco^n. is to say (saluator) a savior or
helper / Now soth it is that each of these three rehercyd. was in his time an
helper or sauer of the people / And yet but in figure of Ihu^s Christ. Whereof
folowyth / that they were not the same Ihu^s of whom I purpoos talk For he
both was and is (saluator mu^di) the savior of the world. How each of these
three Ihu^s rehercyd did help. and save y^ people in his time / I shall show
you. The first Ihu^s the sone of Naue. sauyd the people (per potencia^) The
second (per obediencia^) And the third (per sapiencia^) The first saved the
people by might and power. The second by pe^fyte obedyence. The third by his
great wysdom. The first of them called Ihu^s Naue. at hebreees named Iosue
Benun after saint Ierom i^ his prologe (cu^ Iosue) the first ruler of y^
children of Israel after the death of Moses the servant of god / as it
appears in the first chapter of Iusue. was conuenyently named Ihu^s / For by
the great might and power given unto him of very Ihu^s. he notably sauyd the
people of god / as in the story of Iosue plainly does appear. acordynge unto y^
promise of god made unto him in the first chapter of the same book / as
follows (My servant Moses said god unto Iosue is deed and from this world
departid. Arise thou and pass over the water of Jordan. thou. and all my
people with the. in to the land of repromyssion. which I shall give to y^
chyld^n of Israel. what so ever ground ye shall set on your fete. I shall give
it to you. as I promysid to Moses my servant. It folowyth soon after / No
man shall mow resyst thy power in all thy life. be thou hereof comfortid. and
take strength unto the. Now how this mighty prince executyd the high
commandment of god in helping the people and saving y^ same by the great
power given unto him of god y^ said story of Iosue plainly does declare Shortly
rehercyd. eccliastic. the.xlvi. chapit^e (Ihu^s naue says he successor unto
Moses strong in were and bataylle. was a man of great name / but of grettest
name was he in helping of the people of god. to distroye his enmyes. where by
he might atteyne to the people of god promysid / which glory and reno^mee of
name he obsteyned in lyftyng his hondes and scute. in shetynge of sharp and
fy^y arowes against y^ cite of hay. etc^ / This mighty prince dilygently
executynge the high commandment of Ihu^ christ of whom. and to whom. he was
both figure and servant. through the great might and power to him gracyously
given. so lad. so guyded. so sauyd y^ people to his rule co^myttid. that he
brought them in y^ land. to Abraham. Ysaac. and Jacob. repromysid / thef
vaynquisshyd and distroyed the enmyes of god / dyuydid the land among goddis
servants. and finally set them in rest and peasyble possession of the same
As bryefly declares saint Ierom in his epistle (ad pa^linu^) Ihu^s says he y^
sone of Naue. beryng the figure of Ihu^ Crist. as well in name as in deeds.
passid the water of Io^dan. distroyed the reames of Crystis enmyes. diuyded the
land to goddis servants / And by every cytee. town. village. by hills:
fluddes and ryuers. dyscryued in figure the spirytuall regaly of Crystis
heavenly church and Jerusalem / Then apperyth y^ this noble prince Ihu^s Naue
was in his time a man of laudable memory / now called in all the world one of
y^.ix. worthyes for diverse causes / For by his great might and power he sauyd
the people to him committed from enmyes and from peril. He distoryed the
adversaries of Christ. and set his people in rest and peace / Ye but among
all his praysynges: his memory is specially laudable / For what co^maundid him
to do. that gladly fulfilled he without grutche o^^ ieluctaco^n. leuynge
example unto all pryncis and rulers of the people under god to do the same.
Our lord co^maundyd him. as in the first chapter of Iosue does appear this
wise. Be thou says god unto this valiant knight strong and hertely com
for^id. se ye thou observe and keep al my laws co^maundyd unto the by my
servant Moses. Declyne thou never fro them ne in to y^ right hand. ne yet in
to the lift hand / that is to say. ne in prosperyte. ne yet in aduersyte /
so y^ understanding of my laws be thy leder. Let in no wise the book of my
law depart from thy mouth: ^ut set therein thy meditaco^n both night and
day / so y^ thou may truly observe al things there within written and
commau^dyd / This commandment of god he gladly fulfilled as it appears in
the.xi. chapter of ye same book. in this word (As our lord commanded unto
Moses: so Moses commanded unto Iosue) And he gladly accomplysshed all goddis
precepts There escapyd him not one word of goddis precepts / but to the
extremytee he fulfyllyd them all. Look and this well behold ye Iuges of this
world. learn the laws of god / and se ye them obseruyd and kept^leest ye
perysshe from the right way of god / For and ye be one in prosperyte. a another
in aduersyte One for affecco^n. a another for money. one for love. a another for
hate: thenne^er^e ye fro the right way of Ihu^s. Of y^ second Ihu^s named
Ihu^s of laudable memory in the scripture of god. was Ihu^s y^ sone of
Iosedech. the great priest of y^ law and one of the.lxx. Interpretours of the
Bible / This great priest of the law at the high commandment (...)
of god in y^ mouth of Cu. 9. king and first Monarke of Perse. whom our lord
had with his grace inspyred / as in y^ first chapter of the first book of Esdre
does appear. to release the captiuyte of the Iuys Which for their sins hadr
ben in thraldom in Babylon by the space of.lxx. year after the distrucco^n of
Ihrlm. and subversion of the temple of god in the same. by Nabugodonosor. and
Nabuzardan his capytayne / This great priest I say Ihu^s the sone of Iosedech.
was in his time conuenyently named Ihu^s. y^ helper and sauer of the people of
god (per sacram obediencia^. by holy obedience / as Ihu^s Nau^ was Ihu^s. sauer
and helper of the people (per magnifica^ potencia^) by his great and mighty
power geuyn unto him of god. To show you this. ye must understand / that for
the sins of the Jews it pleysyd god. to have them punysshed / so were they
acordyng to the propheci of Ieremye. the.xxvij. chapter. Their cite. their
temple of great honor was dystroyed. (...)
Sediche their last king was exoculate and made blind. brought with all his
noblesse in to Babilo^e by Nabugodonosor. and there kept in streyte captiuyte
by the space of.lxx. year. And here was an end of kings in the genelogy of
Crist as by the process of the Bible plainly does appear. For soth it is y^
after the time of this transmigraco^n unto Cristis natiuyte. where regalyte and
preesthode were Joined in one in our savior Ihu^ Crist The Jews being in there
lyberte or captiuyte. had never moo kings / but oonly prestes and dukes.
bishops and pryncis / But then were bishops rulers of the people. and
p^yncis helpers and coad^utours / So yt the line of kings after this
transmigraco^n sessyd as in rule. not in succession / And then began the line
of bishops in rulynge of the people. which contynuelly enduryd unto Cristis
te^porall natiuyte / This declaryth the Master of the stories who so list to
se it. Now the first of these great preestis or Bishops having rule of the
people. was this Ihu^s the sone of Iosedech A man of great zele. and deuowte
obedyence unto god / so yt he was conuenyently named Ihu^s. helper or sauer of
ye people by deuowte obedyence. leuynge example to all preestys. prelates in
especyall to beer deuowte obedience unto almighty god. and teache other the
same For when it pleysid our lord to have his people releuyd from their
captiuyte. and his temple in Ihrl^m to be reedifyed to his honor and praysyng:
he co^mittid thereof the rule unto Zorobabel sone to Salat^ell. and to this Ihu^
the sone of Iosedech / as in ye prophecy of Agge plainly does appear. Declarid
at large in the first book of ^ldre. the first. third. and syxte chapytours.
And full conuenyently was this besynes co^myttid unto thise two men of
auctoryte and honor / For of y^ one. that is of Zorobabel our Ihu^s. our
savior descendyd by his temporal natiuyte. as it apereth in the first
chapitre of Mathewe. The other. that is Ihu^s Iosedech preparyd the people by
due obedyence. truly to serve god in this materyall Temple which they then
to goddis honor reedifyed / but more v^rely to serve god in the temple of
Crystis holy body which he took of Zorobabell. and was in it together god and
man in one person / Of which holy temple of his body. himself said. the
second chapter of John / Dissolve ye this temple. and within three days I
shall reyse it again. and soon after follows. These words said our savior
Ihu^ Christ of the temple of his holy body. Of which holy temple of cristis
body was spirytually understand the prophecy of Agge. in the second chapter.
Far gretter says this prophet. shall be the glory of this second temple.
than was of the first builded by Solomon / Spyrytually I say For the letter
full hard it is. to expowne of this temple reedifyed by Ihu^ Iosedech.
Zorobabell and other Jews. Sy^ this second temple was never half so glorious
as was that first buylyed by Solomon. ne in buyldyng ne ^et in aparell as
Josephus declares / For in y^ first temple was contained the arc of the old
testament. in it concerning the tables of the law. Manna and the rod of
Aaron. which flourisshid and fructifyed by miracle. The appostle this
declares to the Hebreos the.ix. chapter. Many also precious Jewels and
tresours were in that temple born away by Nabugodonosor. and Nabuzardan his
capytayn / as it apereth in the fourth book of the kings. the final and
final but on^ chapitours. which were never fully restored again in the
reedifycaco^n of ye same temple able it. that Cirus and Darius many great
things restoryd to the second reedifycacyon as it is declared the first book
of Esdre the first and syxte chapytours / So y^ this second temple was no
thing like unto the first ne in building ne in garnysshyng: Wherefore holy
christian doctors as saint Ierom and Bid expowne this prophecye to the letter /
That gretter shall be the second glory of this second house than of first /
For as much as Criste god and man. Many wyses this second temples with his
holy presence did dedicate and inourne / For in to this Temple by his holy
vyrgyn and mother at her purifycaco^n he was offryd unto god / In this Temple
his holy mother fond him in mids of doctors. From this temple he drove out
byars and sellers / In this temple he often prayed. preached. and many miracles
showed. great then was y^ glory of this holy house. and far gretter than
ever was the glory of Salomons temple. sy^ our savior Crist Ihu^s this second
temple so many ways made holy and glorious / Then to my purpoos I say y^
this great priest and bishop Ihu^s Iosedech was full conuenyently named Ihu^s
an helper or sauer of y^ people by his holy and zelose obedyence / For when: as
the people of god long time in captiuyte of Babylon. confusyon by
interpretaco^n. were after their custom fall in to ydolatry. worshipyng falls
ydoles. and mawmettes: and so had lost their due obedience unto almighty god:
Following the wicked laws of Gentiles. This great priest and bishop acordynge
to his office and duty. with help of Zorobabell the true prince and servant
of god. as tymely as they had license of Cirus and Darius to return home. and
to reedifye. the temple of god: what obedience was in this holy bishop. ye and
with dylygence also to bring the people to the true and fast obedyence of
god. the first book of Esdre plainly does declare / So y^ himself was fully
obedyent unto almgyghty goddys will. and taught all the people to the same / As
it does appear as well of the spedy building of the temple / as of ympnes.
oblacyon^ sacrifyces. with other praysynges of god / which he and the Levites
at his commandment. showed and made unto goddis worship and praysynge.
First in setting the fundacyon of the said temple. as it is declared the
first book of Esdre the third chapter. Zorobabell says he the sone of
Salatiel. and Ihu^s the sone of Iosedech. and other of there brethern priests
and Levites and all the resydue of Jews delyuerde from captyuyte ordeynyd
Levites from.xx years age and above. to survey the artifycers gadered to the
new building of this temple. that they did not neclygently their labor.
Iosue also. which was Ih^s Iosedech. with his chyld^n and bredern. as one man
of one mind and heart did all their dilygence to speed this holy work. What
Joy what gladness was there made by this holy Ih^s. and other the servants
of god by his example and techynge. at the setting of the fundaco^n of this
second temple. there forthwt appears. All the people says Esdras there
gadryd. cried with great voys to goddys prasynge / for as much as the
fundaco^n of the temple was set. Many also of y^ old faders which had seen
the temple of Solomon stondynge. and this temple now begin. wept with an high
voys / And many there present lift their voices in Joy and gladness. Such
agmixco^n was there of cry among the people to goddys praysynge / that no
man might discern the voices of wepers. from y^ voices of Joyful people. so
y^ all enjoyed in god. Of this appears morally. that one virtuous prelate
does much good in crystis church / as well for his own virtue and zelose
obedyence unto the law of god: as in ledynge other men ^o do the same by his
holy doctrine and virtuous example. Again where this building of the temple
was interruptid in ye time of Cambises sone unto Cirus. whom some called
Assuerus. some Arthazarses / But in the time of Cambises was it. yt the work
of god. this building went not forward / but lettyd was it by falls accusars /
which never cesse in the church of Christ to let the works of god / as
daily experyence does show: When Darius king of Babibilon inspyred by god
the second year of his reyne gave license unto the Jews to perform the
temple of god begone. And foundid at the license and commandment of Cirus /
what obedyence / what dylygence / what zele. this Ihu^s Iosedech. with ye
prestys. Levites and all the people had. to perform this holy temple to
goddys worship and praysynge. Ye and what Joy and loouyng was given to god in
dedicaco^n of the same temple: in the syxte chapter of the first book of
Esdre plainly does appear. Some men here present. ye and not a few. woll
perauenture muse / why and to what intent I bring in this long story of Ihu^s
Iosedech. the great priest of ye old law / Surely this is my cause / For sith
al holy scripture is written for our erudico^n after y^ apost^e the.xv. chapter
to the Romans / That we to whom truth is made open by Ihu^ Christ. as
techeth saint John in the first chapter. should lern obedience. learn zele
and dilygence to the law of god of these faders passyd in figure. And again to
take great sham^ and conscience when we read them to have done so zelously in
goddys cause. And behold ourself. how neclygent we ben in the same / For
cursyd is he which does the works of god fraudelently. after Ieremye.

curyd. we kylle. They made. we mar. I woll no man accuse / but look on our
deeds. and behold theyrs. and ye shall find that there is no comparyson
between light and derkenesse. Then have we here of two named by this name.
Ihu^s of laudable memory in the scripture of god. The fyrsste was Ihu^s Naue.
helper and sauer of the people by might and power. The second was Ihu^s
Iosedech. sauer of the servants of god by deuowte obedyence / as now has be
declared / The third of laudable memory of the same name was Ihu^s filius
Sirach. the sone of Sirach. sonnys sone unto Ihu^ Iosedech / as himself
rehercyth in his Prologe of the book named by him Ecclesiasticus. And full
conuenyently was this fader named Ihu^s. an helper or sauer of the people (per
sapiencia^ by his great wysdom given unto him of god. and by him taught to the
people. unto the worlds end. by reason of his laudable wysdom left behind
him in writing in the book of wysdom called Ecclesiasticus. which book.
himself first made and wrote in Hebrewe tongue. and after translatyd the same
in to Greeks tongue / As. Ysodorus declaryth and shows in the syxte book of
his Ethemologyse / For the declaraco^n and expownynge of this truth.
expedient and right necessary it is to know and understand. what help and
saluaco^n. wisdom does unto man. Where ye shall understand and mark in your
mind That oonly man of creatures under heaven dyrectyth and orders his acts
and deeds by his understanding to his end natural or supernatural / Thus I
say. to the intent. it is / or thus it should be. Now for as much as man's
understanding is radically corrupt by sin. and so by ignorance. which is
the mother of error after saint John Crisostom the.xxv. Omelye of his Imperfyte
work on Mathu. expedyent it is therefore. y^ man err not from his end.
naturally. or supernaturally intendyd: that his understanding be dyrected by
some ready light / This light at philosophers is comynly named the light of
wysdom And therefore naturally men desire cu^nynge and wisdom. as says Aristotle
in the beginning of his Metaphisyke That every man naturally desires to know
/ for the more y^ any man has of of wisdom the better shall he dyrecte all
his deeds to a due end. the less he has of wysdom. the worse he shall direct
his deeds: but comynly err. And very wise men comynly order well al their deeds
and never err And for this cause. that men would not err from their end. ye
naturally entendyd. what zele and business old faders had to atteyne wisdom /
wonder it is to read. as at large declares saint Ierom in his epistle (ad
paulinu^) the prologe of the Bible it is / We read says saint Ierom in old
stories. many men have sought far countrees. strange nacyns. and passid
right peryllous sees / that they might speak famyliarly with such
philosophers. whose works they before time had rad. to learn of them wysdom /
This did both Pictagoras and Plato. of whom says saint Ierom in the same
place (Such zele had Plato to wysdom and cunning. that he folowyd science in all the world / as though science had fled from him. And on a time was he
taken by pirates in the sea. and sold to Denyse y^ great tyrant / yet for as
much as he was a philosofer a lover of cu^nynge and wysdom. he was more of
price than the tyrant that boughte him. sith by reason of his cu^nynge. he
cowde more temperatly bear himself in all aduersyte than his master and
sovereign him having in seruytude) There shewyth forth saint Ierom of Titus
Liuius. of Appolonius. and other wise men of the world in great and profounde
wysdom and lernyng. How their fame of cu^nyng and wysdom. drove men from the
ferthest party of the world. to here them. to learn of them wisdom. whereby
they might surely order their acts and deeds to a perfyte end. and not err
from the same / This labor and business says saint Ierom. ^oke gentyl
philosophers oonly lenyng unto ye light of reason. and with faith no thing
Endowed / And of this wysdom to be atteyned by man's Inquisico^n. Aristotle
one of the great enserchers. of the same: said there were two kinds or
parties. in the syxte book of his Ethikis. That one is called Prudence. the
other Sapyence. Prudence* after him is a wisdom to lead man that he err not
from his reasonable end intendid in worldly occupaco^n and business. And
Sapyence after him stondeth in speculaco^n of high and presume causes. so that
sapience is a wisdom to lead man y^ he err not from his end naturally after
Aristotle / but in very deed supernaturally ententyd / And in this sapyence
after him restyth mannys felycyte. In so much y^ he might atteyne to
sapyence. at his opinion was (felix) blessed or happy. For he should not err
from truths necessary to his bliss and perfyte end. and (...)
able it thise philosofers did much to atteyne there intent and purpose. not
to err from the end: yet failed they often times thereof. which appears as
well of their errors abowte the last and perfyte end. as of their errors
abowte means ledynge to the same end / as declares Aristotle in the first
book of his Ethikis / Where he shows that some put there fynall end in
riches. some in concupiscence. some (...) honor. and other transytory
pleysures. which may not endure: but must needs faylle / Yet were these called
and acount^d wise men in the world / And ^uche wise men. that for their
wysdom. they ben of Immortal fame among worldly men. and called Sapientes.
wise men. se^in by excellence. yet fayllyd they and erryd from the ^^outhe /
For neither by their prudence. ne yet their ^apyence. ladde they or themself.
or their folowers to the right and perfyte end natural. or supernatural
Then^e was none of this Ihu^s) per sapiencia^) the helper or sauer of man to lead hy^ by wysdom to his right end. The second cause of this error declares
y^ apostle Poule in y^ first chapter to the Romans / This philosofers erred
says saint Poul / For when they knew god: they worshypt not hy as their. god
/ but wanysshid in their proud reasons. and calling them self wise men. were
foolys in deed / But a q^estion is this / How knew these philosofers god: the
apostle ansuereth in the same place. The Invisible misteryes of god says he be
know of man. ye chief creature of this world. by other smaller and lower
creatures of the same / But how vanysshid these philosofers. how erred they:
For sothe for they gave not due thanks to god their maker and geuer of there
benefytes. Says saint Austin on this letter / These philosofers saw the end
of all creatures: knew there was one god by the light of reason / but unkind
unto there maker y^ gave to them this knowledge: ascribed to themself proudly
there knowledge and wysdom / and for their pride: lost there true knowledge and
made both blind and errynge from troth. according unto y^ prophe^ye of Ab^y.
y^ first chapter. rehercyd by the apostle ye first epistle. and first
chapitre unto the Corinthees. I shall says god by his prophet. distroye and
bring to naught y^ sapience of sapient men: and I shall reprove and bring in
confusyon the prudence of prudent men of this world. In which words god
Joins ^ogyders sapience and prudence of this world. showing yt they ne yet
any of them. ledeth or helps man to his perfyte end And forwt shows
thapostle in y^ same place. what sapience. and what prudence it is. y^ redily
ledeth man to his perfyte end. yt he ne err abowte the end. ne yet in means
to y^ same. It plesyd god says the apostle. by prechyng of his holy gospel
and wysdom there with in contained ^at the world acou^tyd folyssnes.

not in his final end. and truths to the same required. Fulgens in his sermon
of Confessors this shewyth at large In holy scripture is contained both milk

/ This holy and ghostly wisdom was it. yt good fads ever desired to have. yt
they with light. might pass through this world in such astates as the^
stood on. without error or offense to god. and finally their supernatural
end. to which end. y^ wisdom of the world might never led the hauer / As
of Solomon* we read in the third book and third chapter of the kings.
which commanded by god to ask him what petyco^ns he wol de and it should be
grauntyd. asked of god only wysdom to order himself and his people to goddis
pleysure god gave him wysdom above all mortal men / as appears in the fourth
chapitre of the same book. Almyty god says he gave unto Solomon plenteuous
abundance of sapience and prudence. And with this wysdom. came generally all
other profitable goods. The wisdom of this prince was so great. that the
people of far countrees came to seek him. and learn of him wysdom: Some in
Iugementes Some to order well their reames or housholdes. some to order
themself to goddis pleysure / In somoche that (regina Saba) the noble
pryncesse heryng the merueyllous wysdom of Solomon. came out of far
countrees. to here and learn of his wysdom / as it is open the third book of
the kings ye x. chapter / Of which apperyth that this ghostly and godly
wysdom of old time was greatly desyrid of great men. of mean men. of eueri
astate / For by this wysdom they might order all their lives to goddis
pleysure. know their end. atteyne their end. not be ignorant ne yet err
abowte their end. ne means to the same / This world is goon and in effect
tornyd up and down / For where sometime men ^oughte for ghostly wysdom to save
their souls. Now labors eueri man in effect for worldly wysdom / For now
from the highest to the lowest. every man studyeth in avarice. and from ye
prophet to the preeste every man does gyle and sleyght Jeremy. the. vi.
chapter. if they labor for wysoo me of cu^nynge and knowledge as did
Phylosophres of whom I spoke above. of whom says the apostle the first
chapter of the first epistle to ye Corinthees Jews ask signs and Greeks
wysdom somewhat were it. ye and somewhat commendable were it. For after
Aristotle's cu^nynge and wysdom is. acou^tid among goods honorable / But this
wysdom is goon. also. Men force neyher of ghostly wysdom ne yet of seculare
wysdom. called science and cu^nynge / But only wise men ben acounted in this
world. which can find subtle and crafty means to get goods. plain
falsnesse in english / Whoos end is everlasting death. and god is glorified
in their confusyon which savor all of the world. written to the Philipenses
the third chapter / Now to my purpoos. I say this man Ihu^s filius Sirach of
laudable memory. was conuenyently called Ihu^s. an helper or sauer of the
people by his great wysdom. which wysdom / what worldly nay ghostly. He first
taught. and then left in writing. whereby man may duly order his life to his
end natural and supernatural. and neither to be ignorant ne err abowte the
same. or any of the same. as in the process of the book named Ecclesiasticus
of his writing and translacion as I said aaboue plainly does appear. In
which book says saint Ierom. this holy fader ledyth and persuadyth men in
this mortal life to the zele and love of wysdom / as wysdom conteyneth all
virtues / So that in the techynge and declarynge of wysdom. he taught all
virtues / and how man should every manner wise live virtuously / whereby he
might redily and surely atteyne his end. and thereof err ne fail.

Now is there here showed you from the beginning of three men of laudable
memory conuenyently named by this name Ihu^s / for each of them in his time.
was an helper or sauer of the people. The tyrste by power. The second by
obedyence. And y^ third by wysdom / as it has now be declared: yet was there
none of y^ three (^p^e thu^s qui a^pinqua^s that prou^ illis) The same Ihu^s
which nyghynge. walked with mankind / but rather fygures or ser^au^tes of the
same Ihu^s. of the essenciall Ihu^s. of the very true Ihu^s / which is the
sone of god and man / And that I show this / For where as each of them was
conuenyently named Ihu^s. that is to say^. an helper or sauer of the people by
virtues perticulare / as that one was by power. that other by obedyence / and
the third by wysdom / Yet was there not one of these three. which had all
these virtues / neither any of them plenarily / but by partycipacyon of our
Ihu^s Christ / Of whoos fullness and abundaunce we all have received diverse
virtues and manyfolde gracyous yeftes. the first chapter. of John. Ihu^s Naue
had power: but (al mensura^) at a melure. Ihu^s Iosedech had obedyence: but
(and mensura^) So had Ihu^s Sirach wisdom (ad mensuram) in a mesure as god gave
unto him / Bu^t Ihu^s Christ was (plenus g^e and veritatis) the first chapter
of John. almighty of power perfyte of obedyence. And full. ye infenyte of
wysdom. So that y^ same our Ihu^s gave power is Iosue. obedyence to Ihu^s
Iosedech. And ghostly wysdom to Ihu^s Sirach / For at his high word al
things were made: He co^mau^did. and all creatures were create and brought
forth of naught. the. C. xlviij psalm / Then of this* Ihu^s our savior
Christ purpoos I to talk with his mercy (Om^ ip^e ^hu^s apropinquans that cu^
illis) The same Ihu^s nyghyng walked with mankind. In which words I said
there be two parties to be declared. containing two notable truths. The
first is. y^ the same Ihu^s has nyghed to mankind. The second is. that the
same Ihu^s has walkid with mankind / And of these two. follows as a
corelary. y^ third troth. that the same Ihu^s has finally brought mankind
to everlasting rest in heaven. and in this has showed himself to be very
Ihu^s. y^ perfyte savior of mankind. He nyghed I say to mankind (per
potencia^) by his almighty power. He walked with man (per obedie^cia^) by perfyte
obedyence And finally brought man to rest and bliss (per sapiencia^) by his
Infinyte wysdom. First I say our savior Ihu^s has nyghed to mankind by his
almighty power three ways (creando. nascendo. mi^nistrando) by his act of
creaco^n. by his act of Incarnaco^n. and by his holy mynystraco^n. which three
with our lordis mercy I shall show you in this first party. And with all. how
mankind has ever and contynually be way ward. and goo from god. Of which
will appear the goodness of god. and the unkindness of man. First I say our
savior Christ nyghed unto man by his almighty power in y^ act of creaco^n /
To whoos declaraco^n I shall show you three conclusyons. First wherein stondeth
y^ act of creacion. Second yt Ihu^s Crys^e the eternal sone of god the
fader. excersyced and showed this act as well on man. as on al other
creatures. And, third how in executynge of this act. he nyghed unto man.
First in this party. ye shall understand / that (c^eare est ex nichilo
aliquod facere) after the master of the sentence in the beginning of the
second book. The act of creacyon is to bring forth a substance of naught.
that is to say. of no thing forgoynge. ne matere. ne form. / This is called
properly the act of creaco^n after the master. all be it largely taken
Creaco^n may be where as is matere forgoynge in making a new form of
naught / As the reasonable soul of man is daily create of god. And ryseth not
any power of the matere sith by creaco^n she is infoundyd from god in to the
body of man. and in her infusion she is create of god / This act of creaco^n
oonly apperteyneth unto almighty power. or power of itself infinyte / So that
no lymyte ne determynate power. may any wise in this act of creacyon / that
is to bring forth ought ofnoughte. Said therefore gentle philosofers oonly
considering determynate and lymyte powers / That of no thing. can no thing
be made. ne every thing: of every thing / but of determynate thyng^s: may
other determynate things be brought forth / so that they denied creaco^n. and
put oonly natural producco^n. And no wond though they this wise erryd / for
they neither consydred ne yet granted any almyty powwer. ne actually Infinyte
/ For after their oppynyons. there is no thing actually infinyte / But surely
they vanysshyd and erryd in their thouhtes. they were amasyd in their minds
not knowing their almighty maker which made al creatures of naught. / It is
not that thing that I woll dyspute with them / But to us all of crystis
relygyon and holy faith: enough it is to confess that there is an act of
creaco^n / which is to bring forth a substance of no matere fore going. and
that immedyatly / Which act is the act of all mighty power oonly to god
belongyng. The master of the sentence the first distyncco^n of the second
book this declares. putting there dyuersyte atwyxe Creare and Facere.
creaco^n and facco^n. Creator says he is which of no thing makyth somewhat.
so yt this act of creaco^n properly is to make ought of naught Facere. y^ is to
make. it is not oonly to make any thing of naught: but of some fore going
matere. So y^ both angel and man ben named Factours / but not creatours / For
this name of creaco^n is only to god belonging. which makyth some things of
naught: And some things he makyth of ought yt is to say of a matere forgoyng.
all be it in holy ^crypture. these names ben often take. the one for y^ other.
as the creator for the factour. ye and many times the factour for the
creator. Then have we first in this party. wherein stondeth the act of
creaco^n: I say in the act of almighty power. which is to bring forth ought
of naught. only to god belonging. The second conclusyon is in this party to
be declared. yt our eternal Ihu^s. the sone natural of god the fader
everlasting. excersyced this act or deed of creaco^n / This truth declared
Moses the great prophet of god. Genesis prio. ye first chapitre of Gen) (In
principio inqd creauit deus celu^ and terra^) Almighty god says he. fader.
sone. and holy ghost. three persons. and one god at the begyny^ge made heaven
and earth of naught Of which words apereth. yt the outward ac^ or deeds of y^
holy trynyte be indivisible. and therefore is this act of creacyon. rather said
her of a term esse^cial than personal as when Moses says. god create and not
ye fad. son^ and holy ghost And yet the fader did create. so did the sone.
and so did the holy ghost. And yet not three creatours / ^t on^e creator. as
not three almyghte^^ but one almighty. ne three goddis / but one god. y^ and on^
man doubt where this act of creaco^n: be to the sone of god Ihu^ Criste
apperteynynge and belonging / as to true christian men is no doubt: goo to the
gospel of John. and there ye shall find it plainly expressyd. First by his
secretary saint John. and after by himself / Saint John purposyng to declare of
Crystys holy diuynyte. begins in this wise (In principio erat verbu^. et
ve^bu^ erat apud deu^. and deus erat verbu^) The sone of god says he was
euerlastyngly in the fader. with the fader. and one god with the fader. To
stand much in declaraco^n of this letter. I trust it nedyth not / For every
good christian man here understands. y^ verbu^) is Ihu^s Christ the eternal
sone of god. of whom folowyngly in the same chapitre says saint John (Ex
verbu^ caro factu^ est and habitauit in nob, The sone of god eternal is become
man says he and has gracyously made his habitaco^n with us. / When saint John
had said. deus erat verbu^) The sone of god was euerlastyngly god. it folowith
(hoc erat in principio apud deu^) Upon which words says Hilarious the holy
bishop / as though saint John should say / This essenciall word or sone of
god y^ fader. was never from god the fader separate ne diuyded / Then to
show his almyty power egall with the fader: he addyth forthwyth Oia per ip^m
facta (su^t) All creatures says he were create by the sone of god. The
apostle callyth him therefore in y^ first chapter to the Hebrees. the
bryghtnes and glory of the fader. by whom the fader created all creatures. Oour
savior Christ himself declares y^ same. the fy^the chapter of John. My fader
says he werketh unto now. and I work unto now. Here says saint Austyn. as
though Christ should say. By me all things be made. The fader of heaven made
light: but he saying made it / if he said and made light: then folowyth
that by his word he made it. And I am his eternal word. then by me he made
light / My fader then wroughte and made when he create the world. and unto
now werkyth in guydynge the world / Then follows yt by me he made when he
made. and by me he guydith when he guydeth. Then have we here in this party
first wherein stondeth the act of creacion. where is showed In om^ipotencia)
in almighty power. to bring forth a substance of no thing ought of naught.
Second in this party is showed. that this act of almighty power. Ihu^s Christ
with the fader. and the holy ghost one god. showed and put in execuco^n in y^
formaco^n and first making of all creatures. Now folowyngly and third in this
party. shall I show you / and this process is specially to be notyd. how by
this act of creaco^n and almighty power: our Savior Christ nyghed unto
mankind / Where ye shall understand That by this act of creaco^n. he nyghed
unto mankind dyuersly. That is to say both generally and specially /
Ge^erally / for as he left in all creatures (vestigium) a sign or a ^oken of
his hondwerke. So left he in mankind a sign of his handwerke. as in famylyar
ensample / If a man step in snow or sonde. after his departing remains a
step. So after the act of creac^n remains behind y^ hond work of god in
the creature. Sygnefyenge that god is thereof the dooer / This is a general
nyghinge of god to all creatures / For in all creatures app^ryth his handwerke.
that they ben of god create and made / But in this act of creaco^n of man.
apperyth how specially god has nyghed unto man by his almighty power. For
where as in all creatures he left destigium) a general sign or token. In man
he left over this (ymaginem and similitudin^ suam his propre image and
symylitude. The first chapter of Genes. said god the fader unto the sone and
the holy ghost. Make we man to our ym age and symplytude. And it folowyth
Almighty god create man unto his image and symylitude. A g^^te dignyte is this
/ if it were dylygently consydryd Wherein this image and symplitude stondeth
D^dareth the master of the sentence the.xvi. dy^^y^cco^n of the second book.
Man says he was made to the image and symylytude of god in his soul. wherein
he excellyth all unreasonable creatures / But to the image of god was he made
by reason of his memory. understanding. and will. To the symylitude of god. by
reason of Innocence. Justice and other virtues moral. in which man was made
and created by the all mighty power of god. in his soul. of goddys goodness.
not of or fore any mannys decerte or merytes / Then here appears That by
this act of creaco^n. god greatly nyghed unto man both generally and specially.
Ye and over this. god diverse ways nyghed unto man by this said act of
creacion. as that god then began first to be lord unto man. and man
servant un to god / As declares saint John Crisostom in a sermon beginning.
The dygnyte of man's condycyon is soon known. dylygently consydred the
sublymyte and heyghte of god his maker. and^.

Over this god nyghed unto mankind ^per illapsum gracie specialis* by his
inspyred grace. to al men generally in geuynge unto them the law of kind /
written in enery mannys heart. and stondinge in these pryncyples / that is to
say* Do unto thy neighbor as thou would be done unto / And do to no man
that thing which thou would not it were done unto the / Ye but to some men
god gaaf special grace / as to that Just and ryghtwysman Abel. the first
cheyf and pryncypal membre of his cytee in earth. and to other faders. his
elect and chosen predestynate servants. which all stood in his special
grace. and acceptable favor. For they yeldid unto him their creator
kyndnesse for kyndnesse / Who so lust well and studyously consydre the order of
holy scripture unto the Incarnacion of our savior Christ Ihesu / where I shall
declare how he nyghed unto man by the act of his Incarnacion: shall most
plenteuously find. how from the first of the creacyon of man. our most
merciful lord Ihu^s Christ our savior / as the time passyd from the first
creacyon of the world. ever more and more nyghed unto mankind. leuyng with
him certain remembrance and tokens that his mercyful lord god had been with
man. vysyted man. and with his manyfolde graces nyghed unto man / For by cause
man should again* night unto him. and yield unto him kyndnesse for kyndnesse /
As to Abrahaam he gaaf Circumsicion signaculum fidei) A very and perfyghte
token of true faith which man should beer unto hrs lord god. The seuententh
chapitre of Genes. god wonderly and kyndly nyghed unto man by this mystery /
For this was a very sacrament taking away orygynall sin. As now does the
sacrament of of Baptysme. exceptynge that Circu^msicion did not open the gates
of heaven / For as at that time the price was not paid of our savior
Crist-Ihu^s most precious blood and death / This declares and shewyth the
master of the sentence. the first dystynccyon of the fourth book.

God also gave after this by his holy prophet Moses a law written to makynde
as plainly does appear in the Penteteuch. In the which law he nyghed unto
man very greatly / For in this he taught man what he should leave / what he should
take / what he should refuce / what he should follow. and what he should fle.
How man-sholde please god with sacrifyces acceptable / whan^e he were unclean
or had offended / as y^ books of Leuiticus and Numeri does show. Ye. and in
this nyghynge of god to man he nygheth (...) men specially / as to Moses. to
whom our (...) spoke very famyliarly / as friend to friend. Which after holy
doctors exposyco^n was in some high creatur. the. xxxiiii. chapter of Exodus
/ And from this time forward toward his holy Incarnaco^n. god ever nighed
unto mankind more and more. leuynge in diverse his servants special tokens.
that he had be with them / which tokens remain unto this day / and shall unto
y^ worlds end / As the high light of prophecy. and certain knowledge of
things to come. In especyall the mystery of his Incarnaco^n with sequeles of
the same. Here is now declared how our savior Christ Ihu^s has nyghed to
mankind by his almighty power in the act of creacion. as well of man as of
all other creatures. and so unto the time of his holy Incarnaco^n. how he
nyghed to man more and more. leuyng contynually with man tokens that he had be
with him. vysyted him. and done a^es helping to the saluaco^n of man / Of
which well appere^h y^ great kyndnes of god showed unto man. Now in the other
side. god was never so towardly. ne so nyghynge unto man fro the beginning: but
man has ever ben as untowardly to god. and weywarde from him. and that show I
this. God I said nyghed to man by the act of creaco^n. sith he left in
mankind (vestigium) as four me or effect of his hond work: but allo he left
in man his propre. image and symylitude as I showed above / by whythe image and
symylitude. man might suffyciently order himself to god. yeldyng to him
kyndnesse for ky^d nesse / But forth with man was unkind. and always ward from
god: and lost his symylitude by sin Et in ymagi^e pertransit homo) the.
xxxviij. psalm Man now passes through this world in the image of god: but his
symylytude has he lost. Upon which words y^ prophet says Cassiodor /
(Man passith in this world) And true it is: sith in this world we have no
dwelling cite / But where in passyth man: surely in the image of god / And
where is yt holy symylitude of god to which man was create: Where ben the
virtues: where is grace: where ben other holy gifts which led man to
everlasting life: surely the wretchyd man by his sin lost all this. when he
fell in to y^ hondes of thieves: which robbyd man: wou^dyd man. and left him
but half a live. Man was robbyd from his gifts of grace: and sore woundyd in
his natural gifts. in som^che that fro the foot unto the heed was in man no
health / And yet that little that was of any virtue or perfeccion. in the image
it was understanding memory. and will remain soryly and full of affecco^ns. as
we se in daily experyence / But Innocence Justice. and virtue be goon by sin.
which causes such abundace of wyckydnesse. as in this world continually
reyneth / but as man is remedy (in aqua and sp^usancto) in ye water of baptym.
and the holy ghost in the same received. Again I said that god nyghed to man.
geuyng him for a token of the same. the law of kind. To love thy neighbor as
thyself. Caym would none of this token: but wrong from god. slew his innocent
brother Abel. And where he should have nyghed unto god again: he fled from the
face of god. as it is open the fourth chapter of Gen: and then dwelled he in
ye land called Nayde. by Interpretacion called fluctuaco^n. or vnstablynesse.
And full conuenyently says saint Ierom in his epistle to Damasus. of y^. vij.
vengau^ces of Caym / For he so depart and go from god says he: Anon his fete
ben mouyd. that is to say. his affecco^ns. and in al^his ways is made
unstable / Of this folowyth a corelary or a mo^all erudyco^n and learning.
Which is so say. y^ sinners departed from god: be very Inconstaunt and right
chaungeable of their condycyons and manners. But and if that this be true. it
should seem That many one are separate and departed from god in this mortal
world. And should seem that there ben many sinners / For much Inconstaunce is
there in mennys condycyons and manners. and much change in their clothing.
The one fol^wyth of the other comynly / For where as men's minds ben
inconstaunt to god or man. to y^ prince or the common we will: there is never
certente ne fastenesse. Take this as ye list: but sure it is. y^ sin and
departing from god is ever full of vnstablinesse Then where so ever is much
vnstablynesse. sign it is. y^ men ben fled from god and woll not nyghe unto
him. as he does to them. so they yield unkindness for kyndnesse. I said over
this. that god nyghed unto man geuyng him a law^^^ryten by Moses. willing to
be known for his god. for his lord ^ for his maker. saying unto man / Thou
shall give adoraco^n unto thy lord god. and with this service. serve him
oonly. Ye shall not make unto you goddis of god. ne of silver / For I am only
god. the. xix. chapter of Exodus / Came Ieroboham the sone of Nabath. and said
plainly that god was strange unto him in this commandment / and was not so
famylyare with man. ne so nyghe unto him as he should be / And finding a new
falls way. made two calfes of gold. the. xij. chapter of the third book of
kings. And said unto the children of Israel (Ascend ye no more in to Ier^m.)
y^ gloss) there to. do. worship unto god For in Ierlm was the temple of Solomon
/ in which almighty god was solempnely honored. Then folowyth in the same
place the words of Ieroboham unto the people* Behold Israel. these ben thy
goddys which delyuerde the from the seruytude of Egypt. and^) By this mean
he brought the poor foles to ydolatry / And where as they should have given
unto god (cultu^ late) honor oonly due unto god / they chaungid says David
the prophet the glory of god in to the symylitude of a calfe etynge hay. This
was not the first unkindness and way warnes of ydolatry that I read in
scripture. by which god nyghynge to man was unkindly cast from him / For I
find that both Abraham and Tha^e. Moses and Aaron with many other holy
faders. were with this wretchydnesse of ydolatry grievously trowblyd / But of
Ieroboham I bring this in especyall / For he mayntenyd and bare out the matter
and said plainly That these were the great Ioddys that had done to them all
their great benefytes / yt brought them out of seruitute. and put them in to
liberte. And in remembrance hereof. he sett^ one of these ydolles in Bethel.
and a another in Dan. which after Rabi Solomon ben two hills distyncte. The
one in the south party. and the other in the north party. where the. x. tribus
dwelled / that from y^ mydyll parties of the same. the people might at their
pleysure vysyte that. or y^ ydoll / This was tuyn a mean to draw (mobile
wlgus) the Inconstaunt people. to be unkind to god their maker. and lene unto
the devil their distroyer: And to bring his purpoos abowte: somewhat more did
he / as folowith in the letter^ ^m^ fecit sacerdotes de extremis pp^i qui' non
erat de filij^ leui) He made says the gloss priests of every trybe
indifferently / For so it was The tribe of Leui would not consent to his
ydolatry / wherefore he said unto the people That it neded not take preestis
oonly of the tribe of Leui But it was suffycyent: That who so ever cowde offer
a solemn sacrifyce as Aaron did in his co^secraco^n. that such one might
be priest well enough. she forsyd not what pressed he took to make his sacrifyce.
were he good. were he bad. of whatso ever kynne or condico^n he was. cu^nynge
or no cu^nynge al was one with him. And in sign of this I said he took
(sacerdotes de extremis ppli) I trow y^ bes^e english here to He took his
priests of y^ worste of the people. God co^maundyd. there should be no priest
in his law. ne mynystre his sacrifyce: but he were of the tribe of Leui. The.
v^ij. chapter of Numeri. leui by Interpretaco^n is asmoche to say / as
Assu^ptus / elect or chosen of god / So there should no man presume to take the
dygnyte of preesthode but he were called and chosen of god. Thapostle this
commands the. v. chapter to the Hebrees (No man says he presume to take
on him the honor of preesthode but he y^ is called of god as was Aaton / That
and this were true in the old law where was offrid oonly blood of bestes That
there should no man take on him the office of preesthode but he were chosin and
called by god / as was Aaron and the Levites / How much more in our new
law. where is daily off^yd unto god for sinners. the very flesh and blood of
our savior Criste Ihesu. should no man presume the office of preesthode / but
he were elected and chosen by god to that right excellent office and dygnyte /
For as the sacryfyce of y^ new law Incomperably excedyth all the sacryfyce of
the old law: So should the mynystre in holiness. excede the mynystre of the
old. law. I said. that Ieroboham in taking preestys (de extremis populi) of
the worste of the people contrari to the commandment of god: brought by
their means the people to declyne and torn from god. which right often had
nyghed unto them by his manyfolde graces and benefytes as plainly declar^th
Moses (in exodo) and so forward / And not oonly by these evil preestys were
the people tornyd from almighty god: But over this. tornyd were they to falls
goddys: geuynge unto them (actum latrie (...) ^ur which oonly belongyth unto
god. contra^^ dyrectly to the great commandment of god / as it is above
manyfestid / and in many places of the old law plainly does apere / That in
somoche and these evil preestys not chosen elect then of god: but by byenge
and selling. and diverse and many (...) means / causid in this manner wise the
(...) err from almyty god their maker by ydola^^^ Much more I think. that
our evil prestys in ye new law. not chose. ne assu^pte of god / if any such
be, bring the people in to scisme and heresy. as well by their ignorance: as
by their evil condyco^ns. I trust the^ ben not many-suche / of some I fere
me. Criste had but.xij. apostles: and yet one of theirn was the child of
perdico^^ / And therefore no wonder is it: though in such a multitude as we
ben. there ben some children of the devil. and of perdico^^. God amend all. I
woll accuse no man I said over this. y^ our Ihu^s Christ against the time of
his holy, Incarnaco^n nyghed unto mankind greatly: leuynge with him a notable
token of the same / which was the light and spyryte of prophecy: whereby holy
faders knew the suretee of Crustis coming in to our ky^de. Among many
prophets Ysay in especyall / There shall goo forth says he a rod of y^
rote, of Iesse: and a precious flower shall ascend of that rote: the.xi.
chapter of Ysai. But for this was some what derkly spoken and in an allegory.
he more plainly by the light of prophecy in him inspyred: expressyd the same
coming of Criste in to our kind / sheynge how he should be borne of a vyrgyn
/ Behold says Ysai. a vyrgyn shall conceyu^ and beer a sone / whoos name
shall be called (god is to us) the.vij. chapter. Daniel the prophet by his to
ken left with him: showed in the. xij. chapter of his book / when our savior
Christ should come. After says he time: and times and half a time / all these
trouthes of Christ forsay^ shall be acomplysshid. Baruch the the third
chapytour of this bo^e declared the condyco^ns of Ihu^ Christ in our nature.

was seen in this earth. and conuersaunt was he with man / And so forth of other
prophets. Eueryman spoke of Crystis coming / after the light and token left
with him by god / So that in genynge this light of prophecye: and certain
knowledge of his mysteries to come: god nyghed wonderly to man. The devil
seenge this: enuyed the mate^e. and besyed h^self to torn away man from god /
that man should not yield kyndnesse for kyndnesse. ne ^orne to god. and nyghe
unto him / as was his duc^y. / And what did trow ye the devil to bring his
purpoos abowte I shall goo says he. and I woll be a lyenge spirit in the

And where as almighty god lyghted his holy prophets with troth: The devil

people / This openly aperyth in the same chapter ^yng Achab said of Miche ye
prophet of god (that Miche never prophesied. or foresaid good unto him) He
told Achab the troth. that and he. werred in Ramoth Galaade. he. should be
slain. and never return again. If ever said Miche to Achab thou re^orn home
in peace: god has not spoken in me. Four hundrid prophets of the deuylles were

declared unto you. how that our savior Ihu^s Crist has nyghed unto mankind

first his image and symylytude / Then the law of kind, and other special

all his kyndnesse. And for each of the same somewhat have I showed you.

Second in this party of the nyghynge of god to man by his almighty power. I
said was by his right high and mighty act of his holy and most blessed
Incarnacion / when the sone of god became man and dwelled with us in our
kind. The first chapter of John. To talk much of this matere of Crystis
Incarnaco^n. is to al sinners both peryllous and much dredefull / In as much
as saint John Baptist. the friend of the spowse durst not this presume / As it
is open of his own words in the first chapter of John in thise words.
After me says saint John comyth by temporal natyuytee Ihu^s Christ god and
man / which was before me in excellence of everlasting dygnytee / whoos shoo
I am unworthy to lose / Upon the which words says saint Gregory (John
Baptist the humble and meke servant. and true friend unto Christ. considering
his high and excellent dygnytee. says of him in this wise) Saint John Baptist
was unworthy to lose y^ welte of Crystis shoo / For he was Insuffysaunt to
Inuestigate the mysterye of his Incarnacion / As though he should plainly say
(What wonder is it though Ihu^s Christ be to me preferryd in dignyte / whom I
know well by temporal natyuyte bo^ ne after me. sith I can not attain the
secrets of his Incarnacion) Then in so much as this holy friend of god. the
grettest man in virtue and holiness that ever was borne bytwyxe man and woman.
durst not presume to treat in this high mystery of Christ Ihu^s blessed
Incarnacion: Much less should all sinners presume the same. I shall therefore
in this matere no thing talk by way of determynaco^n / But with all
reverence and honor. show and declare unto you three truths after my little
learning. First wherein stondeth this high act of Lryst Ihu^s Incarnaco^n.
Second that this act. is an act of the almighty power of god And third. how
in this act. our savior Christ Ihu^s nyghed unto mankind. / As to y^ first.
wherein slondeth this act of Lrys^ts In carnaco^n: ye shall understand / That
when the full abundau^ce of the time of grace was come. acordynge to the high
counsel of the holy trynyte. From for ever determined. The holy trynyte sent
down the second person of the same / And took our nature in the womb of the
gloryouse vyrgyn our lady saint Mary in to the unity of his person. w^ out
consent of man. without spotte of we^me of sin. According to the words of
holy Gabriel in y^ first chapitre of Luke (The holy ghost said tharchangel
Gabriel to y^ blessid virgyn. shall descend on the by y^ plenteuous abundance
of his grace And the virtue of god shall shadow the from all sin) So that
this act of Crystis Incarnaco^n stondeth herin. y^ by thanctorite of the hoole
trinyte y^ second person of the same. has take our nature in to^ ^hunite of
his person. bileue ye this truth. it is enough. it nedith not dispute the
matere. Second I say / this act was an act or deed of the almighty power of
god / For as in creaco^n of the world all things were made at goddis o^nly
word and commandment / So this act of Incarnaco^n was accomplysshed at his
word. The angel saying unto our lady (Hayle full of grace. our lord is with
the) For at goddys power: is no word impossyble. the first chapter of John /
All be it in this act of Incarnaco^n was had consent of the holy vyrgin /
sayeug to Gabriell Behold me the hondmayde of god: I am contented. Be thy
word in me fulfill lyd. In sign that this act was partly preiudic^all to
nature. sith it was don by the almighty power of god: vsyd she the word of
creaco^n. saying / Fiat / partly natural. and of her own consent / And
therefore said she (Ecce ancilla dm^) co^myttynge her will fully unto the will
of god / So that this holy child. Ihu^s Christ in his temporal birth. was
create by god: and yet the natural sone of the holy vyrgyn Mary. And she is
natural mother. god supple ed the office of the natural fader / not by
mynystraco^n of the sede of man: but rather excercysynge the almighty power of
god the creator. She did the office of a natural mother. after saint John
Damascene. in mynystrynge the purest dropes of her holy blood. Third is here
to be showed. how in this act of Incarnaco^n. our Ihu^s our savior. nyghed
unto mankind / Where ye shall vn^stonde That in this act. our savior more
Intrinsecally or more in wardly. ye and more thankfully nyghed unto mankind /
than ever he did before his Incarnacyon / For where as is above showed That in
all his nyghynge unto man before his Incarnaco^n he left contynually tokens in
man. that he had be with him / as his image. his symylytude. and many other and
diverse tokens / as Circumcision. the law written. the light of prophecy. and
many other graces to draw man unto him as is above showed / and yet has man
contynually be waywarde unto god and declyned from him. So it is that in this
act of Incarnaco^n. he left himself for a token with man / For in taking our
nature in to the unity of his person: he vouchydsauf to Join himself to man.
and man to him. that for ever after it should be true. that god is man. and man
is god / For as sa yth, John Damascene That god ones assumid of man in to the
unity of his person. he never after left or forsook. / How kind and
thankful was this nyynge of god to man. to assume and take man in to the unity
of* the second person. Shewyth saint Austin (de verb dn^i) the. xxxvij.
sermon. in treating these words contained in the. x. chapter of Luke. of the
meke Samaritane. which nyghyng curyd the plages of the miserable man. which
hadr fallen in the hondes of thieves. where says saint Austyn in this wise. /
What thing was there ever. so far from other / as god from man. Immortal
from mortal. Ryghtuouse from synner^. Gracious from wicked / Not far by
dystaunce of place: but more rather by dyssymylytude of condycyons. when
therefore our merciful lord Christ Ihu^s our savior had in himself two great
goods. Justice. and Immortalyte / And we of mankind had in us two great
maladies or euyls Wyckydnesse. and Mortalyte / If Christ Ihu^s should have
taken on him both our euylles and maladies. he hadr ben but egall with us. And
should have nedyd a Redemer as we nedyd / Then to the intent that he would
deliver us from our mysery and wretchydnesse. he would be nyghe us of
condycyo^ns: but not to take all our condycyons / He would not therefore be a
sinner as we ben: but he would become mortal as we ben / So that in taking
our pain of mortalyte: and not taking our sin: he delyuerde us both from
pain and from sin.

Then is there here showed. how our savior Ihesus Christ has nyghed unto
mankind by his almighty power in the most high act of his Incarnacion /
where it is showed That he is come by this said act so nyghe man. That god is
man And man is god. The most excellent and highest deed of grace and kyndnesse
was this after saint Austin. y^ ever was done of time / For by this gate had
man his first enter to heaven. which so many thousand years was closid out /
and yet was man ever froward and vnky^de to his savior. as at his te^porall
Incarnaco^n and Natyuyte plainly did appear / For where as angels song.
kings honouryd. sheperdes enjoyed. virtuous men praised god for his me he
coming in to our kind. Herod was trowblid and all Ierl^m with him. the second
chapter of Mathu / wheryn says saint Gregory in his Omely (The king of heaven
borne: the erthly prince. was trowblyd) and no wonder / For surely Temporal
dignyte is sore confoundyd / when the dygnyte of heaven does appear. Herod
feeryd Crystis coming Suspectid his regaly. and without cause Inquyred or
^rouyde. sought to distroye him. He fledr in to Egyte. There was all y^ world
full of ydolatry direct contrary to the due honor of god. He cam^ home again.
Archelaus laid watch to spylle him / And as he grew ferder in to aege: much
contradicco^n had he according to the prophecy of holy Symeon in the second
chapter of Luke / This is a sign said he of Christ / which in his time shall
have much contradicco^n / So that hereof does ape ^. that god was ever to
wards mankind. and man was contynually waywarde from god. Third and
pryncypally in this first party I said our savior Ihu^s nyghed unto mankind
(ministrando) by his holy mynystraco^n in, this world / And all be it so.
that the perfecco^ns of god run contynually t^^der. sith they ben in him
Infinyte. and really one / as his power. his wysdom. his godenes. and so of
other his perfecco^ns. Yet ascribe I this act of (approximacion) or nyghynge
of god to man. unto the power of god / For his power has in this act be
greatly showed / So has his wysdom so has his goodness / All be it not so
plainly to y^ syghte of man / Then to my purpose. I laid our savior Ihu^s
Christ has nyghed unto mankind by the act of mynystraco^n. according unto
his own words written. the. xx. chapitre of Ma^hu The sone of man says criste
comyth in to this world not be served / but rather to be a mynystre and serve
/ And to give his life for the redempco^n of much people. He said not for all:
but for many / for his holy death took not in all effect / and yet was yet for
all the world suffycient. Three ways our savior Christ in our kind. and now
Incarnate has nyghed to man by his admynistracyon / But what shall I say:
Bodily or ghostly. / For soth to say y^ troth: both bodyly and ghostly. all
be it. more ghostly thanne bodyly / And all has he done. that man should nyghe
unto him again. and be made one spyryte with god. He has nyghed unto man I
say three ways by thacte of mynystraco^n / that is to say (in mynystrynge
light. In mynystrynge cure. and in mynystryng his holy sacraments) For whose
declaraco^n ye must understand That at our saviors coming in to this world.
mankind had many defawtes / Three in especyall. which lettyd him to come unto
god non pedibus: s morib) not with his fete: but with his condico^ns. he was
bly^de and might not se. Syke. and might not goo So vnwyldy and Impotent in
every party. yt he cowde in no wise nyghe. and come unto god. Now this defawte
our savior did help by his admynystraco^n / First I say where man was
blind / what bodyly: Nay rather ghostly by ygnoraunce. mynistryng his holy
word: he lytned greatly the soul of man. through prechynge of his holy word.
he took fro mankind ignorance / And lyghtnyd him with the assurid lyte of
faith / which after saint. John Crisostom is the very light of mannys soul.

To show this: I let you wit. that man was Create of god. very god: having
knowledge necessary of god. of himself. and of other creatures abowte him / as
declares the master the. xx^ij. distyncco^n of the second. Now so it was as
is above rehercyd Mankind fell in to the hondes of thieves. which robbed him.
woundyd him. and left him but half alive. He fell in to the deuylles hondes
and power by consent to sin / They dispoyllyd him of his yeftes of grace. and
sore woundyd him in his natural yeftes / when he lost the symylytude of god
his maker / and in this world passid forth in his image / In which image man
was sore woundyd / For he had lost Ignorance in his understanding Oblyuyon in
his memory / And in his will dyffyculte to do well. Where my saying be true /
nay I report me to yourself. / Which is he among us all which can excuse
him of Ignorance / which can remember him of all his dewetyes and not to
forgete any of them / Which has no dyffyculte ne pain to do well: I deem
verily not many in this audieuce. and also I am well assuryd. no man.

Now by this ignorance in to which man was fallen by sin: He fell in to
many other great inconuenyencts / As in to ydolatrye against the due honor of
god. In to rebellyon against his souereynes and princes. In to myscheyf and
murthur between man and man / In to a thousand Inconuenyences moo than I can
reherce or show / For after saint John Crisostom. the. xxv. Omely of his work
Imperfecte on Mathu Ignorance is the mo^er of error: And evil will the
fader) Then^e Join these two togyders Ignorance of truth And evil will. to
know the same / And by all ma nere lyklyhode. error comyth soon after. A sorry
kynredr And a right wicked genelogy. This Ignorance. In especyall of things
necessary to mannys salvation. sometime in scripture is called derkenesse /
Sometime it is called. the shadow of death. Also sometime the image of death /
And some time the pain of. sin / So y^ Ignorance I say of things necessary
to m^nys saluaco^n. has ever Joined with him. s^ne. derknes and death. Christ
coming in to our hy^de. fond y^ world in derknes and y^ shadow of death. and
in ignorance. and he mynystryd light / For after y^ wo^de of Symeon: he was y^
very lyte to releue all Gentiles being blind by sin. Then I say our san
your Christ gave light.: What was that: Sothly he declarid his holy faith to
the world / which as I said above is the very light of mannys soul. And in
sign that all y^ world should be releuyd by the light of his faith At his
temporal birth. he apperyd. with great light / as declares saint Luke in the
second chapy^^e (At the time says he of Crystis holy birth. she peherdes were
there in that regyon observing the night watch on their flocks. And suddenly
y^ angel of god was among them. and the great clerenesse of god bryghty did
beshyne them all abowte) Upon which words says saint Gregory (y^ where in
holy scripture we often read that angels have aperyd to holy faders: we never
read that they appeared with such light as did this holy angel at Crystis
birth) For full conuenyently says saint. Gregory was this priuylege reseruyd
unto cristys natiuyte / when was bome very light to men sitting in the
derknesse of Ignorance and sin / So that as our savior came with great
light in to this roorlde: So by his power in mynystryng his holy word to the
people. he lyghtned mennys souls greatly with his faith. according to the
words of David the prophet in the. xxiiij. psalm (Nyghe ye unto god says
the prophet: and ye shall be lyghtnyd with his faith / For he nyghed unto you by
mynystraco^n of the same light) Then thou heretyk how cannest thou excuse
thyself. let se. god offreth to the his light of faith. contained in holy
scripture saying (Blessed be those which here deuowtly the word of god. and
it observes the xi. chapter of Luke. He nyghed to the with necessary light.
thou sparest thy derke and ignorant soul. and wolt not come to god / what
wonder then if thou err from troth. and fall in to the derke pytte of
everlasting dampnaco^n. / This is the way war denes of all great sinners / As
of great extorcioners great usurers. great oppressers of the people. Offer to
them light / Show to them the peril of their great sins. They sparre their
souls. Shytte out the light. And delight to dwell in ignorance. lay^ng holy
scripture for them. the. xij. chapter of Luke. A servant knowing his
soueraynes will / and it not perfourmynge: shall be grievously punysshyd And
therefore had they much lever contynually live in^gnoraunce. than to know the
troth / But he that is ignorant of trouthes necessary. shall be of god
unknown. that is to say (vnalowed at y^ great Judgment. Saint Austyn says
(y^ one thing is evil Not to know. and a another Not to will know. The will
of them is at god reprouyd / Of whom says the prophet David (They woll not
know to do well Second in this party. I said our sauuour nyghed unto man
mynystryng unto him cure both ghostly and bodyly. Ishewe it this At his coming
in to this world. All the world of men was syke. All ghostly / And many
bodyly / All were ghostly syke by sin / For all were sinners. as shows the
apostle to the Romans the third chapter / how this syknesse of sin entryd
in to all the world. the same apostle declares to y^ Romans the fyfth
chapitre. As by one man laych the apuostle. sin entered in to all the world /
and by sin. death. So by ^o man. death passyd in to al men / In which o^ man:
all men have offendyd god by sin. Now for this ghostly syknesse of sin:
many have fallen / and yet fall in bodyly syknesse / As declares saint John
Crisostom upon these words of Crist unto the palsy man by him curyd / which
lay. xxxviij. years sore sike in his sickness (Goo thy way said Christ unto
him. and se thou sin no more leest if chance the worse) the vi. chapter of
John. Here learn we says saint John Crisostom. that this mannys syknesse came
unto him for his sin / For so it is. that almighty god often punyssheth the
body for sins of the soul. And it follows (though it be so. that al men ben
not in this life punysshid bodyly for their sins. let us not thereon trust.
ne be to proud / For assurydly a sinner to pass this life without aduersyte:
sign it is of great punysshment and dampnacy on in hell) After the words of
Job the. xxi. chapter (great sy^ners says he passyth this world full of ten in
much prosperity and at a soden point they descend in to hell. Then some
there be which be here punysshid bodyly for there ghostly sy^nes and yet not
all having bodyly syknesse. have it for their sins: but sometime of natural
causes: Many times of surfeyte. ye and sometime for god woll show his great
power. and be glorified on wretchyd persons / As Christ plainly showed in the.
ix. chapter of John: where his discyples asked him of y^ blind man of
natyuyte. / Who offendyd: this man or his friends. that he was borne blind:
Criste answerde and said. that neither he ne yet his t^endes: but that the
glory of god should be made open on him. Whereupon says saint Austin Hadr this
man not original sin. ne yet actual in progress of his life. that Christ
said of him. he had not offendyd: yes lurely says said Austin / both he and
his friends had diverse ways sinned / And yet for ^heyr sins. was not this
man born blind: but y^ cause was. that god would show his almighty power and
be glorified in him) So theme at our saviors coming in to this world. al were
syke ghostly. and many bodyly. Now he like a great physicyen b^ his almyty
po^er. mynystrid cure unto them He nyghed unto them that were sinners. and like
both ghostly and bodyly. He disdayned not their company. etc and drank with
them famylyarly / This meke act of christ. displeysid the proud Scribes and
Pharisees. and said to his disciples (Whi ete^h and dryketh your master with
great and open sinners) the v. chapter of Luke. Christ was then in y^ house
of Leui or Mathu. which made him a gre^e fest whereunto came many Publicans.
great sy^ners. usurers I deem many of them. Cr^ste I say ete and drank with
them. to cure them. not to follow them. to draw them to him. not him to them*
y^ they should follow his steps. not he theyrs. He nyghed unto them by grace.
y^ they should nyghe unto him by penance / Wherefore he answerde forth with to
the acusaco^n of the Scribes and Pharisees this wise Sike men needs a
physicyen. and not hoole men* Where upon says saint John Crisostom in these
words Christ remembered them of the common Infyrmy ^e of sin. showing them to
be of the nombre of sinners. And himself to be a perfyte physicyen / and
therefore adds forth with (I came not in to this world. to call ryghtwysmen:
but rather sinners to penance As though he should say I disdain not sinners.
sith oonly for sinners love I came in to this world / not y^ they should
remain sinners: but rather to be converted and live euerlastyngly) Then^ I say
our savior Ihu^s Christ dispysed not the company of syke men. gostly. ne bodyly
/ but of his infinyte goodness by his great power cured them all. all y^ would
come. nyghe. or cleue unto him. and forsake hy^ not / For y^ virtue of him yede
forth. and curyd all men. y^. vi. chapitre of Luke We never read y^ crist ever
cast any sy^ner or syke man fro him y^ sued to hy^ for mercy and grace. Al be
it. we find. y^ some cast away themself. and would not come at his calling: but
were all waywarde. and wrange from him / As the rich man of whom we read the.
xviij. chapter of Luke. after much comunycaco^n atwyxe them. criste said unto
him Goo thy way. selle all thy gods. give them to poor men. Come and follow
me / and thou shall have a tresour in heaven) It folowyth / This rich man
departed heuyly and soryly fro Criste / for he had great possessions. Christ
lokynge abowte / and knowing this man departed. said to his discyples (Full
hard it is a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven) and^. Takes good head
here unto ye rich men of this world: Full hard it is to you. to nyghe unto
god: but ye with Leui cast from you your burdon. and follow Christ. We read
also in the. viij. chapter of John That many refusyd and cast Christ from
them / when they went back from him. walked no more with him: but followed the
devil / This was it of the. ix. leprous men of whom we read in the. xvij.
chapter of Luke / This was it of Judas the traitor to Christ. and of few
other we read that raste Christ from them saying in a parable the. xix.
chapter of Luke We wol not this man to regne on us) But we never read that
Christ cast any seek man from him ghost ly. or bodyly / which would come unto
him and be curyd. In token of this. he said himself in the. xi. chapter of
Mathu (Come ye unto me. all y^ ben chargyd with the burdon of sin / and I
shall cure you) Ye but thou as^ryst me here a questyon:. Curyd Christ his
pa^yentes. / Ye surely: Never physicyen like unto him / For he made all the man
hoole. the vij. chapitre of John: He never curyd man in his body / but he
first curyd him in his soul. And full resonably / For a perfyte physicyen
should first cure that thing in his pacyent which is of great peril. and of
grettest price / Now is there incomparably grettest peril in syknesse of the
soul than of y^ body / For the syknesse of the soul follows comynly
everlasting death / which is everlasting dampnaco^n in hell / And the
syknesse of the body follows but temporal death: the departing of the body
and the soul / which Christ accountyd for no great thing / as it is open in
the. x. chapter of Mathu (Dread ye not says Christ to his servants. the^.
which when they have slain the body can hurt you no ferther / But dread ye
him which has full power to committee both body and soul to everlasting
pain of hell. Ye says Christ. him dread ye) Then sith there is so great
peril in syknesse and death of the soul above the syknesse and death of y^
body: our savior Lryst curyd always the soul first. and folowyngly the bodies
/ of whom was less charge Ye but ye must understand. all his phisyk was
heavenly. not erthly. all from above. not fro by neth / For after saint Austyn
He. which with his oonly word made all thing of naught: he with y^ sam^ his
oonly word: repaired his creatures at his pleysur) He mynistred al his cures
both gostly and bodily. by his almighty power. saying to one blind man
respice^ behold and se. To a another that was long with the Palsy contracte
(Rise up. take with the thy bedr and walk) To a another (Be it unto the after
thy faith) And to Lazare four days in his grave veni for as / come forth and
live) Christ never vsyd emplastre. pocion. bayne ne ointment / but it were ones
/ when with his holy spotell meddled with clay he enoynted the eyes of him that was
borne blind / Which after saint John Crisostom was mo^ for mystery than for
the matere / Of this apereth how our savior by mynystraco^n of his great cures
on the souls and bodies of syke men. nyghed to man kind by his great and
almighty power. showing himself a meke servant. to cause mankind to nighe
unto him by hertly love. his great benefits duly consydred. Third and finally
in this party I said our savior Crist nyghed unto man my nystrynge unto him
his holy sacraments. leuynge in his holy church with man for ever. auctoryte
and power to do the same / This did our savior of his great goodness: but by
his power and auctorite / For as hy^self said in ye. xxviij. chapter of Mathu
All power in heaven and earth is yeuen unto our Ihu^ Crist For the declaraco^n of
this troth. how crist has nyghed unto mankind by his sacrament I shall
shortly show you three truths / First whi criste instituted y^ holy sacrament^
in his church. second what sacramen^* he instituted / and third how he nyghed
to man in y^ same First whi our savior instytutde holy sac^amentes in his
church: declares the master of the sentence in the first dis^ynccion of the
fourth. For three causes / For man's hum^lyacion / for his e^udyco^n / and for
his exercytaco^^ Thise holy sacraments were Instytute ones / for man should
meke himself: which had offendid by pride. and seek help everlasting in
things sensyble / not of themself: but of god in them. and by them. Again
these sacraments were Institute. for mannys ghostly erudyco^n / That man
which by his sin had lost the syghte and perfyghte knowledge of god had in
the state of Innocence: might by vysyble signs. and outward tokens. come to
the knowledge of secret mysteryes and graces of god. in these vysyble to kens
sygnyfyed and contained / For ye must understand. that (sacramentu^) a
sacrament after y^ master in the same place. is a token. or a sign of an holy
thing (That is true says master Dwns) on the same / but that it is a practik
and effectuous sigge. not fayllynge. ne uncertain of his sygnyfycacy on / For
it puts in effect. and under god in a manner is cause of that thing.
which is thereby sygnyfyed. for the thing surely. And vndowtidly folowyth / if
there be no defawte on him which should receive the sacrament. Third I say
the holy sacraments were Institute for mannys excercytaco^n. that man should
be contynually ocupyed in the service of god / and not give himself to vayn
ydilnesse / For as says saint Austyn / That man is not l^ghtly won by the
deuylles temptaco^n. which geuyth himself to good occupaco^n. Exhortyth
therefore saint Ierom (Be thou man ever more besyed in some virtuous labor.
that the devil find not the ydyll) Then here appears the first why our
savior did mstitute sacraments in his holy church. I say for our
humylyaco^n. erudico^n. and excercytaco^n / but finally for our saluaco^n / as
in the second troth of this party shall appear / which I said to be this /
What sacraments our savior did ordeyne. and institute in his church (Vij. I
say) as the master declares at large in the.^ij. which all ben effectuous
signs of grace. to each man. which them. or any of them. worthyly does
receive / And so be means of man's fynall saluaco^n / To talk of all these
sacraments to y^ purpoos: time woll not permit I wot / I shall therefore
talk of three of them. showing how kyndly our savior Christ Ihu^s nyghed unto
man in each of them / For that is my purpoos to show. The first is the
sacrament of baptym / The second of penance. The third the holy sacrament of
the awter The first is of necessite simplic^^ to man. The second is of
necessyte condicional. The third is of necessyte convenient. The first that
is the sacrament of baptym. is of necessyte simplic^^ / For baptym is that
first gate by the which every man must pass of necessite that purposes
enter in to heaven. Christ this affermed in the third chapter of John. May no
man said Christ unto Nichodeme enter in to heaven / but he be regenerate and
redemyd in water. and the holy ghost I call this sacrament of necessite
simplici^ / for sith all men be borne sy^ners as is above declared: al men must
be clensyd of there sins or they enter into heaven / for therne comyth. ne yet
abides sith any sin. or sy^ner^ Then our savior Ihu^s Criste of his great
godenes ordenyd and Instituted the sacrament of baptym as a necessary gate to
entree by toward heaven. Here is none excepco^n: but young and old. christian
ma^nys child and hethens. Jew or gentile: what soever state he be of: by this
holy sacrament must he pass. without the baptym of blood / as holy martyrdom.
it let or prevent / And for this sacrament is so necessary. Christ preached
and declared this specially / as testifies both Mark and Ma^^u. a little
before his Ascencyon. he co^maundyd his dyscyples this wise (Go ye forth said
Christ in to all y^ world. teache ye all people. ^aptisynge them / in the name
of the fader. and the sone. and the holy ghost / Who so ever have true faith.
and is baptized. he shall be sauyd) Second. I say the sacrament of penance is
of necessite condicionall. That declare I thus For as baptym wassheth away
origynall sin and actual where it is. So does y^ sacrament of penance. take
away sin. or sins actual after baptym committed. In witness of this.
Christ geuyng auctorytee to preesthode for ever to give remyssyo^ of sins.
^nsufflate and gracyously brethyd in his discyples. saying. Receive ye the holy
ghost / who so ever sins ye forgive. forgeuen be they at god / And whose
sins ye retain retained be they at god. the. xx. chapitre of John / Now for
as much as every man is a sy^ner in this life comynly as saint John shewyth the
first chapter of his first epistle in these words / If we say y^ we be no
sinners: we disceyue ourself. and troth is not in us / And not oonly in one
sin we offend god: but in many sins: as declares saint Iamys in his
epistle the first chapter (We all says he offend god in many offenses and
^respasses. is therefore y^ sacrament of penance. necessary to man
condicionally) That is to say (if man offe^de / as we do all cominly: then^ is
y^ sacrament of penance necessary to y^ releyf of ma^nys sin. to put hy^ in
surete of remyssion) For (penite^cia habitus) thabite of penance is not of
such surete as declares master Dwns in the.iiij. / Then^ sith this sacrament
is of necessyte required to all sy^ners. Crist saying in y^.xiij. chapter of
Luke (Without ye do penance. all shall ye perysshe) Cast not away this holy
sacrament. ne the grace thereof. Despise it not / But amend we ourself in to
better life. taking penance for our offenses by ygnoraunce committed. leest
we suddenly prcuente with death. seek for penance. and can not ^henne find it.
Third I said the holy Sacrament of the aweer is of, necessytee conuenyent /
which. I declare thus like as bodyly meet and drink is necessaryly required
to the bodyly sustenaunce of man in this erthly life: So is this holy sacrament
required as ghostly sustinaunce for mannys spyrytuall life) As declares saint
Austyn on these words of Criste in the.vi. chapit^e of John (My flesh says
he is very meet. and my blood is very drink) Sith men says saint astyn
desire by meet and drink to satisfye their hungre and thy^ste. this oonly
does that holy meet and drink which makes the deuowte receyuers thereof
Immortal and Incorruptyble. the blessed sacrament of the awter. Then sith
this holy sacrament is ghostly mete and ghostly drink: necessary is this mete
and this drink for the contynuau^ce of the ghostly life of man / as in the same
chapter of John declares our savior Christ at large (But ye ete says he the
flesh of the sone of man. and drink his blood. ye shall have no ghostly
life in you / And who so ever ete this meet and drink this drink worthily.
shall therbi live euerlastyngly) And masters all^ I beseech our lords mercy of
one thing. that all we here present. which at this blessed feast of Ester
have received this holy sacrament. sac^ame^tally. have also received the same
spyrytually. that is to say (the grace by this holy sacrament sygnefyed and
given) In haste we shall know of lyklyhode / For as ye know the tree by the
fruit: so shall ye know the man by his condico^ns. He that retorneth hastily
to his old sins again: of lyklyhode never received this holy sacrament
spirytually. Of lyklyhode I say. I dare no ferder presume to Judge. The third
truth in this party I said to be this. how our savior in these three
sacraments in especyall. and in all in general. nyghed. and daily nygheth
unto man / Where ye shall understand. y^ our savior Christ has promised so
to assiste his holy sacraments with his grace. when he ascended unto the fad
of heaven. saying to his discyples / and to all good christian men unto y^ worlds
end for ever in the last chapter of Mathu (Remember ye well what I say I am
with you for ever unto the worlds end) That who so receive worthyly any of his
sacraments. receives by special condiscen dyng in to his soul. almighty
god. and his special grace / Whereby he stondith in the special grace and
favor of god. All his acts ben in the syghte of god specyaly acceptyd and
allowed. and ordered to everlasting reward in heaven. In witness hereof says
saint John in the fourch chapitre of his first epistle God is charity. and he
that dwells in charity. dwells in god. and god in hym^

Then by virtue of his holy sacraments. Criste merueylously nyghed to man /
for he dwe^leth in man. and makes man his holy temple. and place of his
gracious habytacyon / But among all his holy sac^amentes. he nyeth syngulerly
to man in these three. in baptym. penance. and the holy. sacrament of the awter
/ For where man is far from god by sin as is above said: by baptym he
wasshith. hy^. clensyth him. enters in to his soul. dwellyth with him / and
makyth him one of his famyliare household. By the sacrament of penance where
the sinner is fallen from god and his grace. fast bound in the prison of
sin. and oblisshid to everlasting dampnaco^n: god of his Infinyte goodness
nygheth unto him geuyth him water of contrycion. losyth him. takes him in to
his household again. admit teth him in to his fauonr / And dysposeth for him
everlasting saluaco^n in heaven. himself saying by his prophet. In what so
ever hour the sinner truly repent: he shall be saut. and his sins forgeuen By
holy sacrament of the aw^er. most syn gulerly. and most gracyously. he
nygheth unto every man it worthyly receyuynge / For by this blessed sacrament.
he fedyth man. he comfort man. And strengtheth him against all his enmyes.
himself is the feder. himself is the fode. himself is the geuer. himself is
the gift. himself is the prayser himself is the price / So y^ by this holy
sacrament he nygheth so unto man. y^ he Incorporateth man in to his mystycall
body. And makes him one of his precious me^bres / For whom by his great power
he fyghteth. and against al his enmyes he mytily defends / Of whom was Ihu^s
Naue but a figure. for he never sauyd y^ people to him committed: but by y^
grace given unto him by our Ihu^s Christ. Syn there is no power but of god after
the appostle to y^ Romans the.xiij. chapter. Ihu^s Naue by the power of god
given to him. slew and distroyed the bodyly enmyes of his people. Our Ihu^s by
his own almighty power. distroyeth the ghostly enmyes of his servants / For
after thapostle y^.xvi. chapit^e to the Romans (almighty god by his power shall
spedely trede and distroye the devil under our fete. and over this geuyth
power to all his servants to do the same Behold and take good head says
Crist to his servants: I have given power to you to trede serpents and
scorpions under your fete. and none enmye shall mow noye you. the.x. chapter of
Cuke Ihu^s Naue again brought the people to him committed in to the land of
repromission by y^ power of god. Ye but this land was all erthly bryngyng
forth of brymbles and thorns / But our Ihesus has sauyd all his people. not
one of them perysshyd. exceptynge the children of perdyco^n / And has brought
all his servants in y^ to land of everlasting life. And there has
dystrybuted unto every one of his servants. glory in abundaunce Where his
servants shall never hungre ne thryste Ne never be trowblyd ne noyed another
with hete ne with cold. Here is now declared and showed y^ first party and
pryncypall conclusyon of this poor sermon (thus manner form) That the same
Ihesus Christ which did aid. and in all his works did assyste unto
foresaid Ihesu Naue has nyghed unto mankind by his almighty power in three wise
creando. nascendo. ministrando) by his acts of creaco^n. of Incarnaco^n. and
of mynys traco^n / What shall I then say unto all christian men but this (Be
not unkind unto him. Be not froward. be not wayward) For there was never
naco^n in this world so great. y^ ever had their goddis nyghyng unto them as
our lord god nygheth unto us: The fourth chapter of Deutronomij. Then I
exhort you all to nyghe unto god with the act of adoraco^n / y^ is to say with
perfyte love and service oonly due to god) For he nygheth by his manyfold
graces. to all those. which humbly. and of a^^ ^^eyr hertes do seek him.:

Second and pryncypally in ^his collaco^n. I said me to show and declare to
you. how the same Ihu^s has walked with mankind by holy obedyence^ If y^ axe
me. which same Ihu^s: I say the same Ihu^s. the sone of god. and of y^ virgyn
our lady. which nyghed to mankind. and assisted to Ihu^s Naue by his almighty
power: The same Ihu^s it was y^ walked with Ihu^ Iosedech. and so has sauyd
manky^de by his holy obedience / To whose short declaracion. ye shall
understand. y^ our savior Christ has walkid with man three wise by holy
obedience: but this must ye understand of Ihu^ Criste Incarnate and living in
our mortal nature / and all for we should follow his holy steps for our
profit / as aft shall appear. First he was obedyent to his friends and
prela^es. Second he was obedyent to the precep^ and laws. Third he was
obedyent to passions and de^he. First I say he was obedient to his fader
putatiue Joseph. and to his holy mother. and other potestates of the world. In
y^ second chapitre of Luke we read. y^ Ihu^s descendid from Ierlm in to
Nazareth and was obedyent unto Mary and Joseph (the story is there declared at
large) but to mine intent. this appears of the same. That our savior Christ
showed great obedyence unto Joseph and his holy mother ^m^ erat subditus illis)
he was to them obedyent. They co^maundyd. he obeyed. Upon which words says
saint Bid. In this mystery says he is given of our savior to all ^ortall men
a great example of meekness. god was subdued to man. everlasting to te^porall.
the gretter to the less. y^ hyer to the lower (To the intent y^ we should
learn and follow the steps of meekness) which purpose to attain y^ hye
glory of god Of which follows a notable corelari or moral lesson this (y^
who so ever purposes to walk with Christ in to y^ heyth of heaven: he must
first follow him in this world by meke obedyence unto all his heedes and
rulers. both spirytuall and temporal. fader and mother / though he be better
and gretter than they in merits and virtue This shows the apostle to the
Romans in the xiij. chapter by a long process. Every man says he ought to
obey to high auctoryte and power. his cause is this / For there is no power
but of god. whereupon says saint Austin (An evil will and desire to noye. may
be of man himself. and of his own crokydnesse) But power to noye may no man
have: but oonly of god / As it apereth of the deuyls words unto god in the
first chapter of Ioh. wyllyng to enoye this holy man (Put forth thy hand
says the devil to god. towche and stryke all his go^des etc) That is says
saint Austyn as though he should say (give power) He would have enoyed the holy
man: but of himself he might not / wherefore he asked power to noye. Then^e
sith there is no power but of almighty god: every man should be gladly obedyent
unto power / For every thing give and ordained by god. is duly ordryd. Now who
so resyst the ordinance of god. purchasyth to himself everlasting dampnaco^n.
Thou say (sire my head. my ruler is cruel. Impacyent. a great wrong doer or
extorcioner) What then says saint Peter / Be ye obedyent unto every man in
auctorytee For goddys commandment. To the king or prince. as cheyf by
excellence vnd god. to dukes and other great asta^es / as his hye mynistres and
officers / what to good and badde thou say: ye sire / so says saint Peter
(ye servants be ye obedient unto your lords in all dread. not oonly to good
and moderate of condycyons: but also to wild and lewd of their disposycyon)
Saint Austin de natura and gracia (entreatynge this matere says (Our savior
co^mau^dyth children to obey their faders and moders. He commands also
subgettes to obey their hedes and prelates. He did as he taught. Fulfilled
y^ he warnyd / For he descendynge with our lady and Joseph. was to them
obedyent / And as a pupil was guyded under power in his tender a^ge. all be it
he was lord of all the world. He has given unto y^ example of meekness. he
has goon before. exhorts the to follow him. Thou refusest to be of the body
of Christ: if thou wolt not with him be under an heed / But y^ say (I love
power / for it is of god: but I dread my prelate my heed / for often he is an
evil man) Here thou me says saint Austyn: if thy ruler or prelate be good and
virtuous: then^e is he to the a nouryssher. if he be evil: then is he thin
attemptour^ Wherefore take y^ gladly thy nouryssher. And in temptaco^n be y^
pacyent. And provide the follower of Christ / which said unto all his servants
in the fourth chapter of Mathu (Follow me. I goo before you by perfyte*
obedyence. takyth of me ensample. and do ye* the same) Of this appears y^ our
savior Christ walked with man by holy obedyence. to his friends. and other
having power and auctorytee in this world. Said he in testimonye and
witness of this unto Pilate bostynge his power / Thou sholdest said Christ
have no power on me / but it were given the from above the chapter of John /
And in this his obedyence. he left and showed us ensample to follow the same.
Now how the multitude to low our savior in his great meekness and obedience.
god knows / full evil I fere. Christ said honor thy fader and mother. that y^
may live long on earth) We say (what so alms. or good dedys we do thy party
fader or mother is therein. and it shall stand you instead. so leuyng them many
times in necessyte and dystresse. the.xv. chapter of Ma^hu. originally
grounded the.xx. chapter of Exodus / And yet I trow verily the defaw^e hereof
much in the friends. which should learn the chyldn. and in their young aege
bring them up (in timore dn^i) in y^ dread of god. to learn them to know god.
to dread god and their friends. Example hereof in especial was holy Thoby /
which taught his sone from his young aege to dread god. and absteyne from all
sin. y^ first chapter of Thoby. according to the wise mannys counsel in
the.vij. chapitre of Ecclesiasti God has given to the children says the
wyseman. teache them the law of god / For sure it is. y^ for lack of
obedyence. and good erudico^n. the chyldn often rise by vyolence against y^
faders: And puts them to great peril. and many times unto death. y^ xiij.
chapter of Mathu. If I should here speak of our chyldn of the cite. I report
me. how well they thryue. comynly none worse / Why trow ye: plainly they lack
erudico^n in youth. with due chas^ysement / So did Offny and Phinees the sons
of Hely. They fell to ryotte as it appears in the ^yrste chapter of y^ first
book of the kings. The conclusion of there folly was (there fad Hely brake his
neck for his necligence. Both his sons were slain in a day by the
Philistees. And tharche of god. y^ true figure of his holy church was taken in
to y^ hondes and power of sinners and thenmyes of god) The.iiij. chapter of
the first book of kings. A common proverb it is and a wise (y^ better is a
child unborn than untaught) Teache ye therefore your children to walk with Ihu^
Christ. by true obedyence to god* to their friends. ye and to their prince. and
other hedes. This ben they bound under y^ pain of everlasting dampnaco^n as
is above showed. For there is no power but of god. The cause whi comynly men
^^bell against their heedys and souereynes. is pride and high mind. Now our
savior taught meekness Learn ye of me says he to al his folowers. y^ I am
meke and humble of spyryte. the.xi. chapter of Mathu. Mekenes ledyth to
obedyence. and obedyence to pacyence. Then where lackyth mekenes lackyth both
obedience and patience: Then follows rebelly on. and where men be unable to
rebel* often they distroy themself for malice. as of Cato Vticense declares
saint Austyn y^.xxiij. chapter of y^ first book of y^ cite of god. which
through his pride was so impacyent and inobedient. y^ he would rather distroy
hy^self than to live under the dominion of Julius Caesar. This did he.
distroyed hy^self. and here was the end of his pride / For sure it is of Crystis
saying (That who exalte himself: shall be mekyd. the.xiiij. chapy^re of Luke.
Second is said in this party. that our savior Ihu^s was obedyent.
accomplysshyd and fulfilled the law. and precepts of the same / which ought
no duty to the law / And that I shall show by this reason (The law was made
for to punysshe trangressours. the third chapter to the Galathees / Now our
savior Christ did never sin. ne yet gyle was any time found in his mouth.
the second chapter of the first epistle of saint Peter) Then folowyth that
he was no thing bound to the law: And yet of his perfyte me kenesse. for our
merit and ensample: fulfilled he the law as detter to the same. both in his
circumcision. in his oblaco^n at the temple. in observing ^he Pasche day in
Ierlm whan^e he was of the aege of.xij. years. all contained in the second
chapter of Luke / Of which holy and deuowte obedyence of Ihu^ Christ. says
the blessed bishop Cirillus the discyple of saint Ierom this wise. O high^
profundite of the great wysdom and science of god. Christ in our kind was
circumscided / which by the auctorite of his godheed daily circumcideth the
sins in men's hertes. He offrid ooutes to god / which in every oblaco^n
made unto god: is honou^yd egally with his fader. The lord of Pasche day.
mekely as a servant obseruyth the pasche. Tronthe observes the fygures of the
law. The maker of the^ law as god: kepyth y^ same as man. And over this. in
observing and keeping of the law: What dylygence. and what obedyence our
savior Christ Ihu^ did. apperyth in the, v. chapter of Mathu / Where he said
unto al his folowers. Think ye not. that I am come in to this world to
dyssolue or break the law. or the prophets / I came not to break them: but
rather to complysshe them. Whereupon says saint John Cri^ostom in his Omely
(Christ fulfyllyd the prophets in accomplysshynge all the tronthes written of
him by them) He fulfilled the laws two ways / First no thing trangressyng
or brekynge. commanded in the law. second in iustifyenge sinners by faith
and charity. that the law by the letter might never do. And so prescice was
he in his obedience. and obseruaunce of the law. that he said forth within
the same chapter (That the leest Jot. or leest precepte of the law should
not pass him vnobseruyd and kept) signyfyeng. That he would keep the law to
every point. and vttermoost precept commanded in the same. I say commanded
in the law. Not in the / Talmodyke tradico^ns of the Jews / which were
besides And out of the law. Many in nombre. And great of charge. To whoos
obseruaunce. the Jews took gretter keep. Ye and gave gretter obedyence. than^e
to the law / As to ete their meet with wasshen. and clean hondes. The
discyples of Christ took no head to this cerimony. The Jews therefore blamyd
Christ And said to him / Why break thy dyscyples the tradicions of our old
faders: They wasshe not their hondes whan^e they ete bread. Christ preterrynge
obedience of the law to their tradicions: Answered / Why break ye ypocrytes
the commanndementes of god For any of your tradicions As who says (Ye should
not so do: But compare to gadre the law of god. And the tradicions of man:
ye should away be obedyent unto the law of god For any tradicion of man) I
fere me we ben in the Jews caas: We take more dylygence. and ben more obedyent
to mannys tradicion. thanne to the law of god. Stomblynge at a straw And
lepynge over a block. Our savior said (That we ought of duty observe and
keep the law / And not to leave the other vnkepte) Let therefore every man do
his duty and follow Christ in the way of his commandments. That he may
truly sing and say with David the prophet (good lord I have run the way
of thy commandments) He went before. he gave us ensample. he called us with
him in obedyence to y^ law. to which he was not bound / but for his mekenes.
and our example. as it is open in the.xiij. chapter of John. where of his
great mekenes he wasshyd y^ fete of his discyples. saying unto them. I
hauelgeuen to you ensample. As I have done: so do ye. For there is no servant
gretter. ^e better than his lord and master. Signyfyeng that al Cristys true
servants should walk with him by meke obedience. in obseruyng and keeping the
laws of god Third I say this party. y^ our Ihu^ Christ. our lauyour was
obedient to passions and death. To passions as to hungre. thryste. cold.
werynesse. to persecuco^ns and aduersyte. to blasphemye. and detraccyon. to
thorns. scourges. naylles. to aysell and galle. and finally to death) And to
what death trow ye: plain to then^ the most shamfull death in the world. to
the death of the cross. the second chapitre to the Pphilipen^. Our savior
Christ says there the apostle mekyd himself. made obedyent unto death. ye and
unto the death of the cross. / Why walked Christ trow ye this streyte path of
obedyence which ledeth to death / for himself: nay. he nedyd not / sith he
never was the detter of death / For as I said above. he never did sy^ne. ne
gyle or dilceyte was any time found in his mouth. Then was it al for our sake.
which were synners^ and of duty the dettours of death / As she with saint Peter
in the second chapter of his first epistle (Christ he says suffryd for our
sins. leuyng you and us al example to follow his holy steps) Then have we
here declared of our Ihu^s Christ. y^ the same which nighed to man hy^ saving
by his great power. showed in the acts of creaco^n. Incarnaco^n. and
mynystraco^n / whose figure was Ihu^s Naue. The same Ihu^s has walked with man
in our kind. him saving by perfyte obedience. to his friends and other
astates. to y^ laws and commandments. to passions and death of y^ cross /
Whose figure was Ihu^s Iosedech: Of which two pryncypall parties. does follow
a corelari That the same Ihu^s which nyghed to mankind. which walked with
mankind. has finally by his wysdom brought mankind to everlasting rest in
heaven / whose figure was (Ihu^s fili^ sirach (which by his. wysdom has greatly
helped and sauyd the people of god / But never like to our Ihu^s Christ / For
as Ihu^s Naue was but a figure of power and strength. Ihu^s Iosedech a figure
of holy obedyence / So was Ihu^s Sirach but a figure of the wysdom of Christ /
which is the eternal. and substancyall wysdom of god y^ fader (attaynyng
