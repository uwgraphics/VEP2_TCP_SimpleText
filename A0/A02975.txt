The Kings edict or declaration.
HEnry by the grace of God King of France and Navarre, to all men present and
to come, greeting: Whereas since it pleased God to call us to this Crown, our
principal desire and intent whereat we have leuelled all our actions, has
tended only to the establishment of a good and assured peace within this our
Realm, to the end that all disorders, violence and miseries of war ceasing,
God might be served according to his holy commandments: and the authority of
our laws and justice restored, under the protection whereof the three estates
of our Kingdom might quietly and peaceably enjoy such things as justly unto
them do appertain. For the compassing whereof we have (as it is well known)
employed whatsoever our habilities, our blood, yea even our life, nothing
regarding death in respect of such reproach and infamy, as justly we might be
charged withal, in case we should endure the wrongful usurpation and
dissipation which some men do presume to make in this our Crown of France.
To the end therefore not to omit any thing consisting in the power of a good
Prince, that may tend to the restoring of the so long expected, so necessary
and desired union, peace and tranquillity among our Subjects, we have with much
patience supported, and in respect of common commodity pardoned the offenses
and rash enterprises of diverse, who (were it not for this respect) have
deserved to be chastised and repressed with most grievous, rigorous and
exemplarie punishments. In consideration hereof, after all our victories, we
have pardoned and given life to those that leuelled at ours: And in regard of
the great compassion that we have taken of the capital City of our Realm,
and to the end to eschew the sack thereof, and to save the blood of many good
Citizens, who were no partakers in the cursed driftes of the favorers of this
rebellion, we have chosen rather to frustrate our selves of that obedience
that unto us is due, then to see the innocent inhabitants, the women and young
children, together with so many beautiful buildinges exposed to the violence,
rage, and fury of fire and sword. We have therefore upon the causes and
considerations aforesaid, in the month of July last, agreed and condiscended
to a general truce, for three months, during which time the Deputies of the
Faction of our disobedient Subjects, have given us to understand and assured
us, that speedely they would send to the Pope, to have his good advice upon
such resolution as they were to take for the conclusion of a good and steadfast
Peace, and reconciliation of us, who are their King and natural Prince.
Wherein also for their parts they have most expressly promised to employ
themselves with all loyalty and affection, for the restoring of the Peace of
this Land, which made us the more ready to yield to the said Truce, albeit we
were sufficiently informed of such disaduantages as otherwise unto them might
arise, also that in matter of arms, we had them far on the hippe: yea and
that during the said conference, we had perforce taken the Town and Castle
of Dreux, even in the face of the principal Leaders of their Faction.
Notwithstanding the assistaunce of the Spanish Protectors: as also that we
wanted no means so to oppress the said City of Paris, that the want of
victuals should in the end have counseled them to shake off the yoke of those,
who for many years had tyrannized, and insolently abused their miserable
patience. To all the which notwithstanding we of our authority did yield, the
rather in respect of the Pope, whom we wished to be every way satisfied, and
to be truly informed of our actions and behavior, to whom also we purposed
to have recourse, to lay open our greuances, and to crave his aid, favor, and
assistance: and to the same effect had chosen our dear and well beloved Cosen,
the Duke of Neuers, a Prince accomplished with all virtues, endewed with
wisdom, piety, and good deserts, who preferring the service of God, and
benefit of this Estate, before the discommodities of his health, and the
dangers and tediousness of the way, has cheerfully undertaken the voyage
toward him: But as for the Deputies of the said Faction, who so assuredly
promised with all diligence to send, we have not perceived that during the
said three months of Truce, they ever made any account to depart. Further,
albeit that since the conclusion of the said Truce of three months, we have
in all their actions found in manner no desire to reestablish the public
Peace of this Realm, of the spoil whereof they purpose to clothe themselves,
and to grow rich with the goods and blood of all good and loyal Frenchmen:
with all, that there is come to our hands a certain Oath, taken by the
principal of that Faction, almost at the very time that they signed the said
Truce, and had promised faithfully to deal, and to consider of the means, how
to conclude a good Peace, and to reconcile themselves unto us, and to that end,
to send to Rome for the good and wise advise of the Pope: the said Oath
importing that they should never treat of any Peace or agreement with us,
wherein they suffered themselves to be so far carried away with the passions
of the King of Spaynes agents, that they reserved not so much as the Popes
authority, to whom they promised to send: we were therewith grieved, and
provoked, according to the exigence of the case: All which notwithstanding,
upon their desire to prolong the Truce for two months more. vz. to the end
of the month of December last, showing us that it was impossible upon our
refusal of this delay, for their Deputies to come to Rome time enough to be at
ye resolution, which might be there taken for the reunion of our Subjects to
our obedience, we upon a desire to justify whatsoever our actions in the
presence of the Pope preferring our purposed respect unto him before our own
profit, and the surety of our affairs which we much hindered and prolonged,
by reason of the said delays and prolonginges of the Truce, we yet granted
them the same for the months of November and December. Howbeit gathering by
the small desire that they had to see an end of the miseries of this Realm,
together with the authority that unjustly they have usurped over a part
thereof: judging also by the delays, so artificially by them procured, that in
all likelihood they tended only to prolong the calamities of France, and to
assure to themselves the wrongful usurpation of the towns and Provinces by
them possessed. We upon these causes having referred all these matters to the
consideration and mature deliberation of the Counsel, have resolved to deny
them the prorogation of the said Truce, for the months of January, February,
and March, which they craved with such instance, as we had cause justly to
believe, that such pursuit never tended to grow to any good conclusion of
Peace, but rather to temporize until the Spanish forces might arrive in our
frontiers of Picardy, by whose coming into the Realm, they might have the
better oportunitye to prosecute war against us, to the destruction of our
good and loyal Subjects: which God of his holy grace would not permit, who
has opened our eyes to see, (by such their missiues as have been intercepted,)
into their wicked devises, and obstinate resolution to mainetaine a perpetual
mischief within this our Kingdom: his divine clemency having taken into his
especial protection the defense of our just cause, and enspired the hearts of
an infinite number of our good vassalls and Subjects, to acknowledge the duty
wherein they are naturally bound unto us, as appears by the coming in within
these three months into our obedience of the towns of Meaux, Lions, Orleans,
Bourges, Pontoise and others, among all others shall never be forgotten the
happy coming in of our good town of Paris, the head City of this Realm,
which happened the two and twentieth of March, with such clemency, policy,
good order and moderation, that not so much as one only Citizen can justly
complain of any injury or offense against him any way committed: where the
entry of our Army showed no coffeehouse, but rather resembled the joyful
entry heretofore made by the Kings our predecessors at their coming to the
crown, in that the joy and applause of the people, upon the sight of their so
long desired King, were no whit less then if they had even then enjoyed the
like surety, as by these presents is unto them granted of our grace, favor,
and protection, with forgetfullnesse of all things past, and assurance that we
will never put in oblivion the deserts of such as in our service have made
show of their virtue and steadfastness. The consideration hereof, together with
the especial goodness wherewith (upon this occasion) it has pleased God to
favor us, has, and still does bind us more then any other mortal creature,
to imagine, and continually to devise how we may make our actions and
behauiours agreeable before the holy majesty of his divine providence, who as
he surpasses in goodness and clemency, whatsoever the spirit of man is able
to comprehend, so has he voutchfafed to leave unto us as an instruction and
testimony, the example and word of his son Jesus Christ, to testify unto us
that whosoever will be accounted his children, must forget others
transgressions. Upon this occasion acknowledging that nothing is unto us a
greater witness that we are made to the likeness of God, then courtesy and
gentleness, freely forgetting all passed offenses and transgressions: We have,
and by these presents do declare, that we have, and do accept into our
favor, the Citizens, dwellers, and inhabitants of our good town of Paris: Of
our especial favor and authority royal, we have and do abolish all matters
happened in the said town during, and by occasion of these present troubles,
we will and ordain, that the same do remain suppressed, abolished,
extinguished, and taken as things never happened: and to that effect with the
advice of the Princes and Lords of our Counsel about us we have ordained and
decreed these things ensuing.

1 First we will and ordeine according to the Edict of pacification established
by the late King our dear brother and Lord in the year 1577. together with
the Declarations since by us made for the observation of the same, that within
the City and Suburbs of Paris, and within ten leagues round about,
determined by the said Edict, there shall be no exercise of any other then the
Romish Religion: We do also expressly forbid all manner of persons, under the
pains in our Decrees contained, not to molest or disquiet the Clergy in the
celebration of divine service, in the enjoying or receiving of the fruits, and
revenues of their benefices, or of any other the rights or duties unto them
appertaining, whereof to that purpose we have, and by these presents do give
the full possession. Also our will and intent is, that whosoever since these
troubles have seized upon any Churches, houses, goods or revenues appertaining
to the said Clergy, resident within the diocese of Paris, as well of such as
are resident in our said town, as elsewhere throughout our Realm, and which
do detain or occupy the same, shall redeliuer unto them the full possession
and free use of the same, together with all rights, liberties and priueledges
that they enjoyed before they were disseased of the same.

2 Also for a more full and perpetual declaration of the singular affection
and love that we bear to our good town of Paris, we have remitted,
reintegrated, and restored, and do remit, reintegrate and restore the same to
all her ancient privileges, rights, graunts, franchizes, liberties and
freedoms wherewith she has heretofore been endued by the Kings our
predecessors, all which we do by these presents a new grant, confirm and
continue the same to use, and from henceforth to enjoy well and duly as in
times past and before these present troubles, as well in all matters concerning
the university, the body and town house, the provost of Marchaunts, the
Shriuewicke and officers of the same, as all other bodies, Colleges and
Commonnalties of whatsoever title or quality, which heretofore and before the
said troubles have been established.

3 To the end also to take away all cause of enquiries, processes and quarrels
in time to come, upon occasion of any thing happened, during the said troubles:
upon a more ample declaration of our will concerning the discharge and
abolishment before contained, we have ordained and decreed, and by these
presents do ordain and decree, that the remembrance of whatsoever has passed
in the said town of Paris and therabouts, so far as the same may concern
the said inhabitaunts and others that were present in the town at the
yielding of the same, who shall within eight days after the publication of
these presents, exhibit their oaths and promises contained in our declaration
heretofore published in our Parliament at Paris, from the beginning of these
present troubles, and upon occasion of the same unto this day, shall remain
extinct and quenched, as well for taking of arms, surprise of Towns, forcing
of towns, Castles, houses or fortresses, razng of the same, leuying of Coin
of the recepts general or particular, of Tenthes, Gable, and sale of Salt,
taxes imposed upon the same, and all other impositions and levy of Coin, as
well in the said town as near there about, all treaties and foreign
imposition exacted upon wares, Merchandise, Victuals, casting of Ordinance and
Bullets, making of Poulder and Saltpeter with other instruments of war,
coining of money, practisings and leuies of Soldiers, conducts and exployts of
the same, leagues, negotiations and treaties either in the Realm or without,
sale of mooueables, selling of woods, either underwood or Timber, amends,
booties, raunsomes or any other acts of hostility: And generally all other
things that have been done, wrought and negotiated after whatsoever form or
manner, public or private, during these present troubles or by occasion of the
same: So as neither the said inhabitaunts, neither any of them shall from
henceforth be troubled, molested, disquieted or sifted in any manner or sort
whatsoever: Willing that to that effect they remain quit and discharged, and
in such cases imposing perpetual silence to all our atturnies general or any
other Parsons whatsoever. Our meaning also is, and (expressly) we do enjoin
them that they give over all Leagues, treatise, assotiacions, practices or
intelligences as well within the Realm as without, that may any way be
repugnant to our authority, under pain to be punished as guilty of treason.
Likewise for the avoiding of all occasions of quarrel or debate that may arise
among our Subjects, we have inhibited and forbidden, and by these presents do
inhibit and forbid them any way to injury, reproach, offend or provoke one an
other, either by deed or word for any thing passed or during these troubles,
enioyning them to continue themselves, and to live quietly together as good
brethren, friends and fellow Citizens under the observation of our Edicts, upon
pain to all offenders presently to be punished without farther form of law
or process as disturbers of the common quiet.

4 Furthermore we will and ordain that all arrests commissions, and executions
of the same, all decrees, sentences, judgments, contracts, and al judicial acts
passed between parties of one faction, and between all such as voluntarily
have gone to law as well in Sovereign courts, in the prouostie of Paris, in
the presidiall Sea, and in other courts and jurisdictions of the said town,
prouostship and vicomptie during the said troubles, shall be good and in force:
Neither shall there be any inquiry taken upon executions of death that have
passed by the authority of justice or course of war and commandment of
leaders. Also as concerning decrees, sentences and judgments granted against
the absent of contrary factions, whether in criminal courts or civil, or in
any the Sovereign courts of this Realm or the jurisdictions of the same,
they shall remain void and of none effect upon any cause or occasion
whatsoever: Likewise all judgments passed against the County Brissar in
respect of the party that he followed, shall be cancelled and revoked, as also
shall be whatsoever gifts by us or our predicessors of any the goods to him
appertaining made or granted, and that in consideration of the great Loyal and
most commendable service done to us and to the whole estate of the Realm, in
reducing of the good town of Paris unto our obedience. Also as concerning all
executions of death passed against any the inhabitants for any matter depending
upon the said troubles, our will and meaning is that the said executions shall
be no way prejudicial to the honor or memory of the dead: Also that such
confiscations as our attournies have or may pretend unto, shall take no place
to the prejudice of their widows children and heirs.

5 We will and our pleasure is, that all the said inhabitants that shall
perform the said promises, submission and Oath, shall reenter into the
enjoying of their goods, offices, dignities and demaines whatsoever situated or
being, wherein we revoke all gifts and graunts of any such things that may be
prejudicial to those to whom they did appertain, or to their widows, and
heirs.

6 In consideration of seazures heretofore made upon the goods, inhearitances,
rents and revenues of the said inhabitants of Paris, or elsewhere within the
said prouostship or vicoumpt, who shall fulfill the said promises and
submissions, in whatsoever place the said goods be situate or remaining, they
shall remain void: And we do grant to the said inhabitants full and perfect
recovery of the said seazures and have acquitted and restored unto them
whatsoever may be unto us due in respect of the same, notwithstanding
whatsoever graunts that may be passed, which we have cancelled and revoked,
and by these presents do cancel and revoke, without respect of any promises
or bonds not discharged, made by the laborers or fermers as well to the
graunts as to the Commissaries and Fermers in law, which are and shall stand
void: Also as concerning Debts or credit due to the said inhabitants, our
pleasure is that with respect of gifts that thereof may have been granted, al
which we have, and do cancel and revoke, they may compel or cause to be
compelled all such as are to them bound by bond, promise, Obligation or setting
over to pay in like form as they might have done before the said troubles.

7 All provisions of Offices granted by the Duke of Mayenne shall remain void
and of no effect. Howbeit such as have obtained the said provisions by the
death or resignation of such as have been of their own faction (except the
estate of presidents in our Sovereign courts) shall be continued in the said
Offices by our letters of provision, which to that end shall be dispatched unto
them, without paying any thing as also shall be continued in like form all new
Officers by us erected in matter of salt, that have purchased their provisions
of the Duke of Mayenne, which also shall remain void and of no effect.

8 Such as by the Duke of Mayenne have been promoted to benefices not
consistoriall, being within the said City void by death shall be continued
in the same by taking of us their dimissories necessary, whereby such as they
have had from the Duke of Mayenne shall rest void and of no effect.

9 In respect of such the inhabitants as were not in the town at the yielding
of the same, wheresoever they were or might be, they shall enjoy the like
benefit as others that were present, in case within one month after the
publication of these presents they do come in, and make the said submissions
and promise to live under our obedience.

10 All such inhabitants as under our Pasports shall depart the town and
betake them into any other parts of our obedience, bearing them selves modestly
and committing nothing repugnant to the fidelity they owe unto us, upon their
submissions and promises before mentioned, shall enjoy their goods without
trouble or molestation,

11 For the ease of the said inhabitants, during this present year, the
Debtors of set rents shall not be compelled to pay more of their arreareges
quarterly then the yearly stint, without prejudice to other former
arreareages, for the which there shall be order set down, as much to the ease
of every man as may be.

12 That the accounts made at Paris during the troubles by any that were
accomptable before the officers of accounts there resident, shall not be
subject to the reuiew, but only in case of ordinance.

13 We mean not notwithstanding in these presents to comprize any thing
committed in form of theft or without aduowe: In consideration whereof we
have permitted and do permit unto every man all free liberty by course of law
to seek their remedy as they shall think good, as also we do except all
such as shall be found guilty of the horrible murder committed on the Parson
of the late king our dear Lord and brother or of any conspiracy against our
life: As also all trespasses and transgressions punishable between men of one
self faction.

We do therefore command our dear and trusty Chauncellor, the officers of
our Crown, all Dukes and Peers of France and all the Lords of our Counsel

The Kings Letters Patents for the reestablishment of the Court of Parliament
of Paris.
Translated out of the French copy, Printed at Paris by Frederick Morell, by
E. A.
HEnry by the grace of God, King of France and of Navarre: To all them to
whom these present Letters shall come, greetinge. Whereas through the mishap
of the dissension raised and continued in this our Realm, by the wicked
driftes of some foreign Princes our enemies, and other our rebellious
subjects as well in the time of the late King our most honorable Lord and
brother, as also since our coming to the crown, sundry towns have been
withdrawn from the obedience due to our said Lord and brother, and to us:
among the which our good town of Paris, having been occupied by our ennemies
and manifestly endaungered to the intolerable yoke and shameful dominion of
the Spanyard, has perpetrated many things contrary to the obedience due to
their lawful King: where remained an infinite number of Citizens, some for
fear of the loss of their goods, others for that they could not abandon such
persons, to whose preservation by nature they were bound: others for want of
means and ability to live elsewhere: and some upon a desire to do service to
us, and to the whole commonwealth of this Realm. Among whom sundry Officers
of our Court of Parliament did there make their residence and continued the
exercise of the Office to them committed, which before the troubles they had
executed in our said Parliament: for the which our said Lord and brother
having conceived against them most just indignation, did inhibite them, and
thereupon made certain declarations since published in the Court of Parliament
transferred to Tours: The like whereof, and upon the like cause and occasion
our selves continued as declaring whatsoever their decrees, judgments, and
ordinances to be void and of none effect. Howbeit in respect of the causes
contained in our Edict which we caused to be published in our great Chamber of
Parliament: we of our especial grace, full power and authority royal, have
extinguished and abolished all matters committed in our said good town of
Paris, during and by occasion of the troubles: As also, we have thought it
requisite and necessary for the benefit of our service and common quiet, to
the end so good a town should not remain destitute of the exercise of justice
royal, for the preservation of the good, and punishment of the wicked, until
we may reassemble the whole body of that our said Court, by the return of our
trusty and well-beloved, the members of our said Court of Parliament transferred
to Tours: Also the Chamber erected at Chalais for the exercise of Justice,
whom to that end we have sent for: that the Counselors and other Officers of
the said Court, who have had their provisions from the kings our predecessors,
and have made their residence in this said town before the said troubles,
should be restored and reintegrated in the exercise of their functions as
having deemed the said Counselors worthy this our favor and grace, in respect
of the virtue and constancy by them showed in sundry matters, namely in the
resolution taken to make the Decree which they published and virtuously
mainetained in the month of June last past, against such as endeavored to alter
and infringe the orders of the lawful succession of this Realm. In
consideration whereof, we have taken away, and disanulled, and do take away and
disanull the interdiction made, as well by the said King, as by us against the
said Counselors and other officers, at this present in good number resident
in this said town, who after they shall have taken the oath herein requisite,
in the hands of our trusty and dear Chauncelor, shall be reestablished and
restored to the exercise of their Offices: as by these presents we have
restored and reestablished, and do restore and reestablish them: to the end
after the said oath, they may enjoy the like honors, prerogatives, rightes,
authorities, privileges and preeminences, which before time they had and did
enjoy, before the said interdictions: so as the said Counselors may do, and
perform all acts and exercises of jurisdiction, and sovereign Justice, that
appertains to our Parliament, in as ample manner, as they did or might have
done, in case the said Interdictions had never been against them declared,
proceeding to the publication of Edictes, admission of Officers, sovereign
judgments and all other expeditions and orders heretofore made in our said
Parliament. We do therefore command our most trusty and well-beloved
Chauncelor: the Officers of the Crown: the Dukes and Pieres of France: the
other Lords of our Counsel, and the ordinary Masters of Requests, by us
committed and deputed, that they cause these presents to be read, published,
and registered, to the end the contents of the same may be kept, observed and
put in execution, according to their form and tenure: For such is our
pleasure: In witness whereof, we have signed these presents with our hand,
and to the same affixed our seal. Given at Paris the 28. of March, the year
of grace 1594. and of our reign the fifth.

The Decree of the Court of Parliament of Paris, of the 30. day of March 1594.
Gathered out of the Registers of Parliament.
THe Court having from the xii. day of the month of January last, solicited
the Duke of Mayenne to acknowledge that King, whom God and the laws have
given to this Realm, and to procure the Peace, whereunto he would never
condescend, as being inuegled by the policies of the Spanyardes and their
adherents: and God having sithence of his infinite goodness delivered this
Town of Paris, out of the hands of strangers, and reduced the same into the
obedience of her natural and lawful King. Having yielded solemn thanks to
God for this happy success, desirous to employ the authority of the Sovereign
Justice of this Realm, to the end, that by preserving the Roman Religion, we
might hinder strangers under the false pretense thereof, from seasing upon the
Estate: and call again all Princes, Prelates, Lords, Gentlemen, and other
Subjects to the grace and clemency of the King, and to a general
reconciliation, and to repair whatsoever the license of the Civil wars has
altered in the authority of the Laws, and foundation of the Estate, Rights,
and Honors of the Crown: the matter deliberated upon in the said Court, all
the Chambers assembled, Has declared, and does declare all Arrestes, Decrees,
Ordinances, and Oaths, given, made, and taken, sithence the nine and twentieth
of December Anno 1588. in prejudice of the authority of our kings and Laws of
the Realm, to be void and wrested by force and violence: and as such, has
revoked, cancelled and annihilated them, and ordained that they shall remain
abolished and suppreued: And especially has declared, and does declare
whatsoever has been done, contrary to the Honor of the late King Henry the
third, as well during his life, as since his decease, to be void: Does
prohibit all persons to speak of his memory, otherwise then with honor and
reverence. And moreover ordayneth that information shall be taken of the
detestable parricide committed on his person, and extraordinarily proceeded
against those that shall be found guilty thereof. The said Court has revoked
and does revoke the power heretofore given to the Duke of Mayenne, under the
quallity of Lieftenaunt General of the Estate and Crown of France: It
prohibiteth all persons, of what estate or condition soever, to acknowledge him
in this calling: To yield him any obedience, favor, comfort, or aid, upon
pain to be punished as offenders guilty of high Treason. And upon like pain
has enjoined the said Duke of Mayenne, and other Princes of the house of
Lorrayne, to acknowledge King Henry the fourth of that name, King of France,
for their King and Sovereign Lord, and to yield unto him the obedience and
service to him due. And to all other Princes, Prelates, Lords, Gentlemen,
Towns, Comminalties, and particular persons, to forsake the pretended party
of the Union. Whereof the Duke of Mayenne has made himself head, and to yield
unto the King service, obedience and fidelity: Upon pain, that the said
Princes, Lords and Gentlemen be degraded from their Nobility and declared
Peasantes, both they and their posterity, with confiscation of body and goods,
razing and ruinatinge of Towns, Castells, and places, which shall be
infringers of the commandemente and ordinance of the King. Has cancelled and
revoked, does cancel and revoke whatsoever has been done, decreed and
ordained by the pretended Deputies of the assembly holden in this Town of
Paris, under the name of the General Estates of this Realm: as void and done
by private persons, chosen, and wrought for the most part by the Factious of
this Realm, and partakers with the Spanyarde, and having no lawful power at
all. Does prohibit the said pretended Deputies, to take upon them this
quality, or to assemble themselves any more in this Town or elsewhere, upon
pain to be punished as disturbers of the common rest, and Traitors. And does
enjoin those of the said pretended Deputies, which yet at this present are in
