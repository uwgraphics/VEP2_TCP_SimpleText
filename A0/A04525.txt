THE POPE. De Paus.
The French King shall be driven out of his land by his own Subjects / for he
shall exercise tyranny against the Professors of the Gospel of Christ /
thereto styrred up / and sporred forwards by the Priests and Bishopps. Who being
with money bought treacherously to betray him / shall mislead and deliver him
/ yet he shall seem to do the same in respect of his Friends / and being
thrust out and deceived / he shall be left and forsaken of those whom he most
trusted to / this shall happen in the end of the second course of time / then
the Arms hang on a dry or witherdstock. Now this is understood as passed, in
the time of H. de valoys.

The Lion prepares for his young a strong and everlasting neast / but none of
the same shall possess it / though they were set in it / but when the Lion
shall fall into the third course of time / then shall there forthwith be
elected in his place a zealous resolute person / by name Frederick on the Rhyn
/ by Aken / whose offspring shall stretch it self to the end of World / for the
end is at hand.

The King of France after being a weary of banishment / and Crosses turning /
about shall join himself to the assembly of the Christians / striving against
the enemies of the Word / and be received again of his own / for in those times
shall the Christian Church there have no other Antistes nor head.

The Pope shows the declining and help-seeking Emperor the Ballaunce /
saying: ponder with your self and consider wheither I have any place at Rome or
not / for I am quite of all except your help / otherwise I should hold my oath
/ but the R. C. shall be remooved to Ments.

Their Bishoppricks shall get others / who shall with more fruit of Godliness
and less pride raygne then the other have done.

In the years 67. and 68. shall these things come to pass / and he that shall
then live shall much admire the peace / unity / rest / and ease among men. For
there shallbe so great Slaughters and Bloodshed that those very few / which
remayn over / shall see and have God and the old Peace to dwell with them / and
that for a certain space of time.

At the same time shall the Pope Cardinals Archbishops / and all Spiritual
states by diverse punishments and suffering be driv'ne unto the former life of
the Apostles

I Capis: Serve: of Ies; Chr: after this have seen in a vision 4. streams /
from the 4. corners of the World / in strife with the great Seo / who when they
could not get the victory came Oceanus / but Oceanus and the 4. streams
overmaysterd the great Sea.

By Oceanus compared with the great Sea, the interpreters understand the Island
of Brittayne.

O Pope, o Duke of Millyane, how faeminine is thy war, how woman like are
they that depend on thee, whereas al war bends itself against thee, to the
end that thou may fall.

The Hellish Dragon his Counsel giver.

All the Empires of the world shall be cast under our feet.

The Antichr: Beast, sprung up anno: 313: who shauld have power for 42 vveeks,
which make 1260. days, or years, from which abstract 18. vvherby it agrees
with the Prophetical time, the remaynder joynd to the former make 1555. the
time that C: V. must give liberty of conscience, adding thereto 67 or 68.
according to Capistranus so have we 1622. 1623.

This strange Figure has been thus drawn / and painted out two hundred
Years before the birth of Carolus M: and found in a stone Wall / but then
alltogeither without any interpretation thereby / only that by the one person
was written the name of Carolus / by the other the Pope; neither did any man
presume to foretell or prognosticate any thing therout / save only Mr. John
Carrion, who fortold the death of some / although not wholly so well as this
figure / for he failed 10 years in his accoumpt. But there has lived in our
times a Moonk in a Cloister in Slesia / named Capistranus, who was highly
esteemed / and of great accoumpt among the Mathematicians / and in many things
(as it is said) a Prognosticatour and a Prophet. Who as he chanced to get this
Figure / which was of it self without any explication thereof thereby / he
labored very diligently / to discover the mysteries thereof / and by all means
to make known the secrets of the same / but when he saw his labor lost and
all in vain / he committed therefore the revelation thereof wholly unto God /
not long after which time appeared a very fearful Commeet in the Firmament /
by means whereof began the revolution of the same / and by Calculating upon
that Celestial Figure / with examining and curious looking therinto / he found
that it threatened all Germany / and the Romayne Empire / with great
destruction and ruin / then caused he this Figure to be drawn upon a
Francine or Parchement / and carefully shutting the same into a clefte of a
wall / leaving there a marckable sign / whereby it might after his death be
found out dispersed and divulged / it was in Anno 1548. when I got the same
of hem that found it.

I Capistranus a Servant of God have seen by the revelation of the most High /
the signification of this Figure / even through Calculating upon the fearful
Commeet / the variation of times and Empires. Namely that in the year 1547.
shall arise a very bitter enemy of the word of God / while he shall give
himself out for a defender of the same / then by falsehood and deceit
pretending to join with the Duitch Princes / he shall seem to set before them
the disobedience of some particular men / as also a pretense for the
reformation of the Church / this shall from North and south bring great
destruction with it / al these things notwithsta^dinge he shall chastise the
foolish bewitched Germaynes with their own weapons / and oppress the heads of
the Empire / in the first course of time he shall without bloodshed have all to
his own will / he shall enlarge the corners of / or between his Columns or
Pillars / in those 3. years shall he deprive them of their might and
Privilege. In the second course shall he privilege and make free al those of
his belief labor to break down and destroy Gods building / and to curb
those that withstand him: than shall the desolate Dukes and Princes see that
they are deceived / and shall be possessed with terror and fear on every side.
In these 3. years shall he attempt to do many things / but in respect of the
manyfold troubles that shall come / he shallbe hindered from his deseignes / yet
he shall give no credit unto the traitors / and he shall in all quarters shed
much Christian blood. In the third course he shall in a kind of a Frenzy bring
a number less multitude of all sorts of people / for to root out and displant
both the word of God and the Christian Princes / and so shall there be every
where madness and bloodshed / then shall there be elected a King / who
notwithstanding his being a King / he shall not be honored with Kingly honor
/ yet many shall depend upon him. In these 3. years shall they bring Carolus
his offspring and posterity / with all his Confederates and adherentes under
subjection and obedience.
