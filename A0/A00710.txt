To the Reader.
THE MANIFOLD untruths which is spread abroad, concerning the detestable
actions and apprehension of those Witches whereof this Historye following truly
entreats, has caused me to publish the same in print: and the rather for
that sundry written Copies are lately dispersed thereof, co^taining, that the
said witches were first discovered, by means of a poor Peddler travailing to
the town of Trenent, and that by a wonderful manner he was in a moment
conuayed at midnight, from Scotland to Burdeux in France (being places of no
small distance between) into a Merchants Seller there, and after, being sent
from Burdeux into Scotland by certain Scottish Merchants to the Kings
Majesty, that he discovered those Witches and was the cause of their
apprehension: with a number of matters miralous and incredible: All which in
truth ar^ most false. Nevertheless to satisfy a number of honest minds, who
are desirous to be informed of the verity and truth of their confessions,
which for certainty is more stranger then the common report runs, and yet
with more truth I have undertaken to publish this short Treatise, which
declares the the true discourse of all that has happened, and as well what was
pretended by those wicked and detestable Witches against the Kings Majesty,
as also by what means they wrought the same.

All which examinations (gentle Reader) I have here truly published, as they
were taken and uttered in the presence of the Kings Majesty, praying thee to
accept it for verity, the same being so true as cannot be reproved.

A true discourse, Of the apprehension of sundry Witches lately taken in
Scotland: whereof some are executed, and some are yet imprisoned.
With a particular recital of their examinations, taken in the presence of the
Kings Majesty.
GOd by his omnipotent power, has at al times and daily does take such care,
and is so vigilant, for the weal and preservation of his own, that thereby
he disapointeth the wicked practices and evil intents of all such as by any
means whatsoever, seek indirectly to conspire any thing contrary to his holy
will: yea and by the same power, he has lately ouerthrown and hindered the
intentions and wicked dealinges of a great number of ungodly creatures, no
better then Devils: who suffering themselves to be allured and enticed by the
Devil whom they served, and to whom they were priuatelye sworn: entered into
ye detestable Art of witchcraft, which they studied and practiced so long time,
that in the end they had seduced by their sorcery a number of other to be as
bad as themselves: dwelling in the bounds of Lowthian, which is a principal
shire or part of Scotland, where the Kings Majesty uses to make his cheifest
residence or abode: and to the end that their detestable wickedness which they
priuilye had pretended against the Kings Majesty, the Commonweal of that
Country, with the Nobility and subjects of the same, should come to light: God
of his unspeakable goodness did reveal and lay it open in very strange sort,
thereby to make known unto the world, that their actions were contrary to the
law of God, and the natural affection which we ought generallye to bear one
to another: the manner of the revealing whereof was as follows.

Within the town of Trenent in the Kingdom of Scotland, there dwells one
David Seaton, who being deputy Bailiffe in the said Town, had a maid
servant called Geillis Duncane, who used secretly to be absent and to lie
forth of her Masters house every other night: this Geillis Duncane took in
hand to help all such as were troubled or grieved with any kind of sickness or
infirmity: and in short space did perform many matters most miraculous,
which things forasmuch as she began to do them upon a sudden, having never
done the like before, made her Master and others to be in great admiracion,
and wondered thereat: by means whereof the said David Seaton had his maid in
some great suspicion, that she did not those things by natural and lawful
ways, but rather supposed it to be done by some extraordinary and unlawful
means.

Whereupon, her Master began to grow very inquisitiue, and examined her which
way and by what means she were able to perform matters of so great
importance: whereat she gave him no answer, nevertheless, her Master to the
intent that he might the better try and find out the truth of the same, did
with the help of others, torment her with the torture of the Pilliwinckes upon
her fingers, which is a grievous torture, and binding or wrinching her head
with a cord or roape, which is a most cruel torment also, yet would she not
confess any thing, whereupon they suspecting that she had been marked by the
Devil (as commonly witches are) made dilligent search about her, and found the
enemies mark to be in her fore crag or foreparte of her throat: which being
found, she confessed that all her doings was done by the wicked allurements
and inticements of the Devil, and that she did them by witchcraft.

After this her confession, she was committed to prison, wheee she continued
for a season, where immediately she accused these persons following to be
notorious witches, and caused them forthwith to be apprehended one after an
other, vidz. Agnis Sampson the eldest Witch of them al, dwelling in Haddington,
Agnes Tompson of Edenbrough, Doctor Fian, alias John Cunningham, master of the
School at Saltpans in Lowthian, of whose life and strange acts, you shall
hear more largely in the end of this discourse: these were by the said
Geillis Duncane accused, as also George Motts wife dwelling in Saltpans, Robert
Griersonn skipper, and Iennit Bandilandis, with the Porters wife of Seaton, the
Smith at the brigge Hallis with innumerable others in that parts, and dwelling
in those bounds aforesaid: of whom some are already executed, the rest
remain in prison, to receive the doom of Judgment at the Kings majesty's
will and pleasure.

The said Geillis Duncane also caused Ewphame Meealrean to be apprehended, who
conspired and performed the death of her Godfather, and who used her art upon
a gentleman being one of the Lords and Justices of the Session, for bearing
good will to her Daughter: she also caused to be apprehended one Barbara Naper,
for bewitching to death Archibalde, last Earl of Angus, who languished to
death by withcraft and yet the same was not suspected, but that he died of so
strange a disease, as the Physician knew not how to cure or remedy the same:
but of all other the said witches, these two last before recited, were reputed
for as civil honest women as any that dwelled within the City of Edenbrough,
before they were apprehended. Many other besides were taken dwelling in Lies,
who are detayned in prison, until his Majesty's further will and pleasure be
known of whose wicked doings you shall particularly hear, which was as
follows.

This aforesaid Agnis Sampson which was the elder Witch, was taken and brought
to Haliriud house before the Kings Majesty and sundry other of the nobility of
Scotland, where she was straightly examined, but all the persuasions which the
Kings majesty used to her with ye rest of his counsel, might not provoke or
induce her to confess any thing, but stood stiffely in the beniall of all that
was laid to her charge: whereupon they caused her to be conveyed away to
prison, there to receive such torture as has been lately provided for witches
in that country: and forasmuch as by due examination of witchcraft and witches
in Scotland, it has latelye been found that the Devil does generallye mark
them with a privy mark, by reason the Witches have confessed themselves, that
the Devil does lick them with his tung in some privy part of their body,
before he does receive them to be his servants, which mark commonly is given
them under the hair in some part of their body, whereby it may not easily be
found out or seen, although they be searched: and generally so long as the
mark is not seen to those which search them, so long the parties that has
the mark will never confess any thing. Therefore by special commandment this
Agnis Sampson had all her hair shaven of, in each part of her body, and her
head thrawen with a rope according to the custom of that Country, being a
pain most grievous, which she continued almost an hour, during which time she
would not confess any thing until the Devils mark was found upon her
priuities, then she immediatlye confessed whatsoever was demanded of her, and
justifying those persons aforesaid to be notorious witches.

Item, the said Agnis Tompson was after brought again before the Kings
Majesty and his Counsel, and being examined of the meetings and detestable
dealings of those witches, she confessed that upon the night of Allhollon Even
last, she was accompanied as well with the persons aforesaid, as also with a
great many other witches, to the number of two hundredth: and that all they
together went by Sea each one in a Riddle or Ciue, and went in the same very
substantially with Flaggons of wine making merry and drinking by the way in
the same Riddles or Ciues, to the kerke of North Barrick in Lowthian, and that
after they had landed, took hands on the land and daunced this reill or short
dance, singing all with one voice.

Commer go ye before, commer go ye,
Gif ye will not go before, commer let me.
At which time she confessed, that this Geilles Duncane did go before them
playing this reill ordaunce upon a small Trump, called a Jews Trump, until
they entered into the Kerk of north Barrick.

These confessions made the King in a woderful admiration, and sent for ye said
Geillis Duncane, who upon the like Trump did play the said dance before the
Kings Majesty, who in respect of the strangenes of these matters, took great
delight to be present at their examinations.

Item, the said Agnis Tompson confessed that the Devil being then at North
Barrick Kerke attending their coming in the habit or likeness of a man, and
seeing that they tarried ouer-long, he at their coming enjoined them all to a
penance, which was, that they should kiss his Buttockes, in sign of duetye
to him: which being put over the Pulpit bar, every one did as he had
enjoined them: and having made his ungodly exhortations, wherein he did
greatly enveighe against the King of Scotlond, he received their oaths for
their good and true service toward him, and departed: which done, they
returned to Sea, and so home again.

At which time the witches demanded of the Devil why he did bear such hatred
to the King, who answered, by reason the King is the greatest enemy he has in
the world: all which their ^nfessions and depositions are still extant upon
record.

Item, the said Agnis Sampson confessed before the Kings Majesty sundry
things which were so miraculous and strange, as that his Majesty said they
were all extreme liars, whereat she answered, she would not wish his Majesty
to suppose her words to be false, but rather to believe them, in that she
would discover such matter unto him as his majesty should not any way doubt
off.

And thereupon taking his Majesty a little aside, she declared unto him the
very words which passed between the Kings Majesty and his Queen at Upslo
in Norway the first night of their marriage, with their answer each to other:
whereat the Kings Majesty wondered greatly, and swore by the living God,
that he believed that all the Devils in hell could not have discovered the
same: acknowledging her words to be most true, and therefore gave the more
credit to the rest which is before declared.

Touching this Agnis Tompson, she is the only woman, who by the Devils
persuasion should have intended and put in execution the Kings Majesty's death
in this manner.

She confessed that she took a black Toade, and did hang the same up by the
heels, three days, and collected and gathered the venom as it dropped and
fell from it in an Oister shell, and kept the same venom close covered, until
she should obtain any part or piece of foul linen cloth, that had
appertained to the Kings Majesty, and shirt, handkercher, napkin or any other
thing which she practiced to obtain by means of one John Kers, who being
attendant in his Majesty's Chamber, desired him for old acquaintance between
them, to help her to one or a piece of such a cloth as is aforesaid, which
thing the said John Kers denied to help her too, saying he could not help her
too it.

And the said Agnis Tompson by her depositions since her apprehension says,
that if she had obtained any one piece of linnes cloth which the King had worn
and fouled, she had bewitched him to death, and put him to such extraordinary
pains, as if he had been lying upon sharp thorns and ends of Needles.

Moreover she confessed that at the time when his Majesty was in Denmark, she
being accompanied with the parties before specially named, took a Cat and
christened it, and afterward bound to each part of that Cat, the cheifest
parts of a dead man, and several ioynes of his bodies, and that in the night
following the said Cat was conveyed into the midst of the sea by all these
witches sailing in their riddles or Ciues as is aforesaid, and so left the
said Cat right before the Town of Lies in Scotland: this done, there did
arise such a tempest in the Sea, as a greater has not been seen: which
tempest was the cause of the perrishing of a Boat or vessel coming over from
the town of Brunt Island to the town of Lies, wherein was sundry Iewelles
and rich gifts, which should have been presented to the now Queen of
Scotland, at her Majesty's coming to Lies.

Again it is confessed, that the said christened Cat was the cause that the
Kings Majesty's Ship at his coming forth of Denmark, had a contrary wind
to the rest of his Ships, then being in his company, which thing was most
strange and true, as the Kings Majesty acknowledges, for when the rest of the
Ships had a fair and good wind, then was the wind contrary and altogether
against his Majesty: and further the said witch declared, that his Majesty
had never come safelye from the Sea, if his faith had not prevailed above their
ententions.

Moreover the said Witches being demanded how the Devil would use them when
he was in their company, they confessed that when the Devil did receive them
for his servants, and that they had vowed themselves unto him, then he would
Carnallye use them, albeit to their little pleasure, in respect of his cold
nature: and would do the like at sundry other times.

As touching the aforesaid Doctor Fian, alias John Cunningham, the examination
of his acts since his apprehension, declares the great subtiltye of the
devil, and therefore makes things to appear the more miraculous: for being
apprehended by the accusation of the said Geillis Duncane aforesaid, who
confessed he was their Regester, and that there was not one man suffered to
come to the Devils readinges but only he: the said Doctor was taken and
imprisoned, and used with the accustomed pain, provided for those offenses,
inflicted upon the rest as is aforesaid.

First by thrawing of his head with a roape, whereat he would confess nothing.

Secondly, he was persuaded by fair means to confess his follies, but that
would prevail as little.

Lastly he was put to the most severe and cruel pain in the world, called the
boots, who after he had received three strokes, being enquired if he would
confess his damnable acts and wicked life, his tung would not serve him to
speak, in respect whereof the rest of the witches willed to search his tung,
under which was found two pinnes thrust up into the head, whereupon the
UUitches did lay, Now is the Charm stinted, and showed that those charmed
Pinnes were the cause he could not confess any thing: then was he immediately
released of the boots, brought before the King, his confession was taken, and
his own hand willingly set thereunto, which contained as follows.

First, that at the general meetinges of those witches, he was always
preasent: that he was Clarke to all those that were in subjection to the Devils
service, bearing the name of witches, that always he did take their oaths for
their true service to the Devil, and that he wrote for them such matters as the
Devil still pleased to command him.

Item, he confessed that by his witchcrafte he did be witch a Gentleman
dwelling near to the Saltpans, where the said Doctor kept School, only for
being enamoured of a Gentlewoman whom he loved himself: by means of which
his Sorcerye, witchcraft and devilish practices, he caused the said Gentleman
that once in xxiiij. hours he fell into a lunacie and madness, and so continued
one whole hour together, and for the verity of the same, he caused the
Gentleman to be brought before the Kings Majesty, which was upon the xxiiij.
day of December last, and in his Majesty's Chamber, suddenly he gave a great
scritch and fell into a madness, sometime bending himself, and sometime capring
so directly up, that his head did touch the feeling of the Chamber, to the
great admiration of his Majesty and others then present: so that all the
Gentlemen in the Chamber were not able to hold him, until they called in more
help, who together bound him hand and foot: and suffering the said gentleman
to lie still until his furye were past, he within an hour came again to
himself, when being demanded of the Kings Majesty what he saw or did all
that while, answered that he had been in a sound sleep.

Item the said Doctor did also confess that he had used means sundry times to
obtain his purpose and wicked intent of the same Gentlewoman, and seeing
himself disapointed of his intention, he determined by all ways he might to
obtain the same, trusting by coniuring, witchcraft and Sorcery to obtain it
in this manner.

It happened this gentlewoman being unmarried, had a brother who went to school
with the said Doctor, and calling his Scholar to him, demanded if he did lie
with his sister, who answered he did, by means whereof he thought to obtain
his purpose, and therefore secretlye promised to teach him without stripes, so he
would obtain for him three hairs of his sisters priuities. at such time as he
should spy best occasion for it: which the youth promised faithfullye to
perform, and vowed speedily to put it in practice, taking a piece of coniured
paper of his master to lap them in when he had gotten them: and there upon
the boy practiced nightlye to obtain his masters purpose, especially when
his sister was a sleep.

But God who knows the secrets of all hearts, and reuealeth all wicked and
ungodly practices, would not suffer the intents of this diuilish Doctor to
come to that purpose which he supposed it would, and therefore to declare that
he was heauilye offended with his wicked intent, did so work by the
Gentlewomans own means, that in the end the same was discovered and brought
to light: for she being one night a sleep, and her brother in bed with her,
suddenlye cried out to her mother, declaring that her Brother would not suffer
her to sleep, whereupon her mother having a quick capacity, did vehemently
suspect Doctor Fians entention, by reason she was a witch of her self, and
therefore presently arose, and was very inquisitiue of the boy to understand
his intent, and the better to know ye same, did beat him with sundry stripes,
whereby he discovered the truth unto her.

The Mother therefore being well practiced in witchcrafte, did think it most
convenient to meet with the Doctor in his own Art, and thereupon took the
paper from the boy, wherein he should have put the same hairs, and went to a
young Heyfer which never had borne Calfe nor gone to the Bull, and with a pair
of sheeres, clipped off three hairs from the vdder of the Cow, and wrapped them
in the same paper, which she again delivered to the boy, then willing him to
give the same to his said Master, which he immediately did.

The Schoolemaister so soon as he had received them, thinking them indeed to
be the Maids hairs, went straight and wrought his art upon them: But the
Doctor had no sooner done his intent to them, but presentlye the Hayfer or Cow
whose hairs they were indeed, came unto the door of the Church wherein the
Schoolemaister was, into the which the Hayfer went, and made toward the
Schoolemaister, leaping and dancing upon him, and following him forth of the
church and to what place so ever he went, to the great admiration of all towns
men of Saltpans, and many other who did behold the same.

The report whereof made all men imagine that he did work it by the Devil,
without whom it could never have been so sufficientlye effected: and thereupon,
the name of the said Doctor Fien (who was but a very young man) began to grow so
common among the people of Scotland, that he was secretlye nominated for a
notable Cuniurer. Al^ which although in the beginning he denied, and would not
confess, yet having felt the pain of the boots (and the charm stinted, as
aforesaid) he confessed all the aforesaid to be most true, without producing
any witnesses to justify the same, and thereupon before the kings majesty he
subscribed the said confessions with his own hand, which for truth remains
upon record in Scotland.

After that the depositions and examinations of the said doctor Fian Alias
Cuningham was taken, as already is declared, with his own hand willingly set
thereunto, he was by the master of the prison committed to ward, and appointed
to a chamber by himself, where forsaking his wicked ways, acknowledging his
most ungodly life, showing that he had too much followed the allurements and
entisements of satan, and fondly pra^tised his conclusions by coniuring,
witchcraft, enchantment, sorcerie, and such like, he renounced the devil and
all his wicked works, vowed to lead the life of a Christian, and seemed newly
converted toward God.

The morrow after upon conference had with him, he granted that the devil had
appeared unto him in the night before, appareled all in black, with a white
wand in his hand, and that the devil demanded of him if he would continue
his faithful service, according to his first oath and promise made to that
effect. Whom (as he then said) he utterly renounced to his face, and ^ayde
unto him in this manner, Avoid Satan, avoid, for I have listened too much unto
thee, and by the same thou have undone me, in respect whereof I utterly
forsake thee. To whom the devil answered, That once ere thou die thou shall
be mine. And with that (as he said) the devil brake the white wande, and
immediately vanished forth of his sight.

Thus all the day this Doctor Fian continued very solitary, and seemed to
have care of his own soul, and would call upon God, showing himself
penitent for his wicked life, nevertheless the same night he found such
means, that he stole the key of the prison door and chamber in the which he
was, which in the night he opened and fled away to the Salt pans, where he
was always resident, and first apprehended. Of whose sudden departure when
the Kings majesty had intelligence, he presently commanded diligent inquiry
to be made for his apprehension, and for the better effecting thereof, he
sent public proclamations into all parts of his land to the same effect. By
means of whose hot and hard pursuit, he was again taken and brought to
prison, and then being called before the kings highness, he was reexamined as
well touching his departure, as also touching all that had before happened.

But this Doctor, notwithstanding that his own confession appears remaining
in record under his own hand writing, and the same thereunto fixed in the
presence of the Kings majesty and sundry of his Council, yet did he utterly
deny the same.

Whereupon the kings majesty perceiving his stubbourne wilfulness, conceived
and imagined that in the time of his absence he had entered into new
conference and league with the devil his master, and that he had been again
newly marked, for the which he was narrowly searched, but it could not in
any wise be found, yet for more trial of him to make him confess, he was
commanded to have a most strannge torment which was done in this manner
following.

His nails upon all his fingers were riuen and pulled off with an instrument
called in Scottish a Turkas, which in England we call a pair of pincers, and
under every nail there was thrust in two needles over even up to the heads.
At all which torments notwithstanding the Doctor never shronke any whit,
neither would he then confess it the sooner for all the tortures inflicted
upon him.

Then was he with all convenient speed, by commandment, conuaied again to
the torment of the boots, wherein he continued a long time, and did abide so
many blows in them, that his leg^es were crushte and beaten together as small
as might be, and the bones and flesh so bruised, that the blood and marrowe
spouted forth in great abundance, whereby they were made unserviceable for
ever. And notwithstanding al these grievous pains and cruel torments he
would not confess^ any thing, so deeply had the devil entered into his
heart, that he utterly denied all that which he had before avouched, and
wound say nothing thereunto but this, that what he had done and said
before, was only done and said for fear of pains which he had endured.

Upon great consideration therefore taken by the Kings majesty and his
Council, as well for the due e^ecution of justice upon such detestable
malefactors, as also for example sake, to remain a terror to all others
hereafter, that shall attempt to deal in the like wicked and ungodly
actions, as witchcraft, sorcery, cuniuration, and such like, the said Doctor
Fian was soon after araigned, condemned, and adjudged by the law to die, and
then to be burned according to the law of that land, provided in that
behalf. Whereupon he was put into a carte, and being first strangled, he
was immediately put into a great fire, being ready provided for that purpose,
and there burned in the Castle hill of Edenbrough on asaterdaie in the end of
January last past. 1591.

The rest of the witches which are not yet executed, remain in prison till
farther traill, and knowledge of his majesty's pleasure.

This strange discourse before recited, may perhaps give some occasion of doubt
to such as shall happen to read the same, and thereby conjecture that the
Kings majesty would not hazard himself in the presence of such notorious
witches, least thereby might have insued great danger to his person and the
general state of the land, which thing in truth might well have been feared.
But to answer generally to such, let this suffice: that first it is well known
that the King is the child and servant of God, and they but servants to the
devil, he is the Lords anointed, and they but vessels of Gods wrath: he is
a true Christian, and trusts in God, they worse than Infidels, for they only
trust in the devil, who daily serve them, till he have brought them to utter
destruction. But hereby it seems that his Highness carried a magnanimious
and undaunted mind, not feared with their inchantmentes, but resolute in this,
that so long as God is with him, he fears not who is against him. And truly
the whole scope of this treatise does so plainly lay open the wonderful
providence of the Almighty, that if he had not been defended by his
omnipotency and power, his Highness had never returned alive in his voyage from
Denmark, so that there is no doubt but God would as well defend him on the
land as on the sea, where they pretended their damnable practice.

FINIS.
