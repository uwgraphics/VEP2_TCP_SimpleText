The mad-merry prankes of Robbin Good Fellow.
To the tune of Dulcina.


FRom Oberon in Fairy Land
the King of Ghosts and shadows there,
Mad Robbin I at his command,
am sent to view the night-sports here.
What revel rout
Is kept about
In every corner where I go,
I will ore see.
And merry be,
And make good sport with ho ho ho.
More swift then lightning can I fly,
and round about this ayrie welkin soon,
And in a minutes space descry
each thing that is done beneath the Moon:
There Is not a Hag
Nor Ghost shall wag.
Nor cry Goblin where I do go,
But Robin I
Their seats will spy
And (...) them home with ho ho ho.
If any wanderers I meet
That from their night sports do trudge home
With counterfeiting voice I greet,
and cause them on with me to roame
Through woods* through lakes,
Through bogs, through brakes
Ore bush and brier with them I go,
I call upon
Them to come on,
And wend me laughing ho ho ho.
Sometimes I meet them like a man,
sometimes an ox, sometimes a hound,
And to a horse I turn me can,
to trip and trot about them round.
But if to ride
My back they stride,
More swift then wind away I go,
Ore hedge and lands,
Through pooles and ponds,
I whirry laughing ho ho ho.
When Ladds and Lasses merry be,
With possets and with iunkets fine,
Unseene of all the Company,
I eat their cates and sip their wine:
and to make sport,
I fart and snort,
And out the candles I do blow,
The maids I kiss,
They shrieke who is this
I answer naught but ho ho ho.
Yet now and then the maids to please,
A card at midnight up their wool;
And while they sleep, snort, fart, and (...),
with wheel to threads their hare I pull:
I grind at Mill
Their Malt up still,
I dress their hemp, I spin their towe
If any wake,
And would me take,
I wend me laughing ho ho ho.
The second part, To the same tune.


When house or harth does sluttish lie,
I pinch the Maids there black and blew,
And from the bed the bed-cloathes I
pull off, and lay them naked to view:
twixt sleep, and wake
I do them take
And on the key cold floor them throw,
If out they cry
Then forth fly I,
And loudly laugh I ho ho ho.
When any need to borrow ought,
we lend them what they do require.
And for the use demand we naught,
our own is all we do desire:
If to repay
They do delay
Abroad amongst them then I go,
And night by night
I them affright
With pinching, dreams, and ho ho ho.
When lazy queanes have naught to do,
but studybate and mischief too
twixt one another secretly:
I mark their gloss
And do disclose
To them that they had wronged so,
When I have done
I get me gone
And leave them scolding ho ho ho.
When men do traps and engines set
in loope-holes where the vermin creep,
That from their foulds and houses set
their ducks and geese, their lambs and sheep,
I spy the gin
And enter in,
And seems a vermin taken so
But when they there
approach me near
I leap out laughing ho ho ho.
By Wels and Gils in meadows green
we nightly dance our heyday guise,
And to our fairy king and queen
we chant our moone-light harmonies
When larkes gin sing
Away we fling.
And babes newborn steal as we go,
An elfe in bed
We leave in stead,
And wend us laughing ho ho ho.
From Hag-bred Merlins time have I
thus nightly reueld to and fro:
And for my pranks men call me by
the name of Robin Good Fellow:
Fiends, ghosts, and sprites
That haunt the nights,
The Hags and Goblins do me know,
And Beldams old
My feats have told,
So Vale. Vale, ho ho ho.
FINIS.
