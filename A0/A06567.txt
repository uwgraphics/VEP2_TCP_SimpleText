.Stans puer ad mensam.
mI dear child first thy self enable
With all thin heart to virtuous discipline
Before thy souerayn stondyng at the table
Dispose thy yongthe after my doctrine
To all norture thy courage enclyne
First while thou spekest be not recheles
Keep foot and finger still in pees
Be simple of chere cast not thy look a side
Gase not about tornyng over all
Again the post let not thy back abyd
Make not thy myrrour also of the wall
Pyke not thy nose and in especial
Be right well ware and set in thy thought
Before thy souerayn cracche ne rub naught
Who that speaks to the in any manner place
Lumpisshly cast not thy head a down
But with sad chere look him in the face
Walk(...) (...)tes in the town
Pare clean thy naylles thin hands wasshe also
To fore mete and when thou do arise
Sytte in the place that thou art assigned to
Peer not to hye in no manner wise
And till thou see a fore the thy seruyse
Be not to hasty on bread for to byte
Of gredines lest men the will atwyte
Grennyng and mowes at the table eschew
Cry not to loud keep honestly scilence
Tenbose thy Iowes with mete it is not dew
With full mouth speak not lest thou do offense
Drink not bridled for haste ne for negligence
Keep clean thy lips fro fat of flessh or fisshe
Wype fair thy spone leave it not in thy disshe
Of thy bread no soppis that thou make
Loud for to soupe hit is again gentilnes
With mouth enbrued (...) thou not take
And where so be thou dyne or soupe
Of gentylnes take salt with thy knyf
And beware thou blow not in the couppe
Reverence thy felaws begin with hem no stryf
To thy power keep pees all thy life
Interrupte not where so that thou wend
No man's tale till he have made an end
With thy finger mark not thy tale
Be well auised namely in tender age
To drink by mesure both wyn and ale
Be not copyous also of langage
As time requires show so thy visage
To glad ne to sorye but keep between tweyne
For loss or lucre or any caas sodeyne
Be meke in mesure not hasty but tretable
Over much is not worth in no thing
To children longs not be vengeable
Sone meuyd and as soon forgeuyng
And as hit is remembrid by old writing
Wrath of children is sone ouergoon
With an apple parties be made at oon
Of honest mirth let be thy daliaunce
Swear none oaths speak no rybawdrye
The best mossell have this in remembrance
Hole to thy self allewey do not apply
Part with thy felawe for that is curtesye
Lade not thy trenchour with many remissailles
And fro blaknes allewey keep thy naylles
Of curtosye also again the law
With sown^ dishonest for to do offense
Of old surfettis atwyte not thy felawe
Toward thy souerain have always thy adutence
Pleye not with thy knyf take heed to my sentence
At mete and at souper keep the still and soft
Eke to and fro meue not thy foot to often
Drop not thy breast with sauce ne potage
Bring no knyues vnscowred to the table
Fyl not thy spone lest in the carriage
Hit goo be side which were not comendable
Be quyk and ready meke and seruisable
Well awaytyng to fulfille anon
What thy souerayn commands the to done
In childs war now mirth and now debate
In their quarrel is no great violence
Now play. now weeping. selde in one estate
To their playntes give no great audience
A rod reformeth all their insolence
In their courage no rancour does abide
Who spares the rod al virtue set a side
Go litill bylle bareyn of eloquence
Pray young children that the shall see or read
Though thou be not compendious of sentence
Of the clawses for to take heed
Which to all virtue shall thy yongth led
Of the writing though there be no date
If ought be amys put the fault in lidgate
.Explicit.
Arise erly
Serve god devoutly
The world besily
Goo thy way sadly
Answer demurely
Go to thy mete appetently
And arise temp^ratly
And to thy souper soberly
And to thy b^d merrily
And be there ^o^ondly
And sleep sewrly
.Explicit.
.An holy Salve regina in englissh.
^Alue with all obeisance to god i^ humblesse
Regina to regne euyr more in bliss
Matter to crist as we believe express
Misericordie / unto all wrecchisse
Vita to quyken to help leall and lisse
Dulcedo of most pleasant beauty
And we say this land thy dowayr is
And therefore we sing / et spes nra^ salve
Ad te most meke and most beingne virgin
Clamamns loud with voys tymerous
Exules made / by false frawde serpentyne
Filij freyll careful and dolorous

Ad te best mean to our lord god and man
Suspiramus here in this see trobelous
Gementes as sorofully as we can
Et flentes often with bitter teris smert
In hac doleful / payneful and lamentable
Lacrimarum wonding the mortal heart
Valle restles greuouse and changeable
Eya ergo maiden most amyable
Aduocata nostra our mediatrice
Illos tuos bryghtest and confortable
Misericordes ocules full of Joy of paradyce
Ad nos fletyng in this see of torment
Convert / now of thy souerayn pity
Et ihesum our lord prince omnipotent
Benedictum full of most hye bounte
Fructum of life and rich benygnyte
Ventris tui most ewrous creature
Nobis post hoc exilium ostende
To our eterne grettest joy and pleasure
O clemens full of mercyful richesse
O pia full of rich compassion
O dulcis full of help in each distress
Virgo fairest way to salvation
Maria flower of swettest meditacian
Salve with all our most lowly seruyse
Matter of life and eterne creacion
Salve ever as feir as we can suffyse. Amen.
Wit has wonder and kind ne can
How maiden is mother and god is man
Leave thyn askyng and believe that wonder
For might has maistry and skyll goth under
.Deo laus etc^.
Who so of welthe takes no head
He shall find fault in time of need
This world is mutable thus seith sage
There fore gadre in time er thou fall in age
In welthe beware of woo what so the happis
And here the even for dread of after clappis
Fortune is variant ay tornyng her whele
He is wise that is ware or he harm feel
Better is to suffer and fortune tabyde
Than hastily to clymbe and suddenly to slide
Know er thou knytte and than thou may slake
If thou knyt er thou know than it is to late
