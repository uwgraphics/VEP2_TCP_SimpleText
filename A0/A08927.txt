Here begins thystorye of the noble right valiant and worthy knight Paris /
and of the fair Vye^ne the daulphyns daughter of vyennoys / the which suffered
many aduersytees because of their true love or they could enjoy the effect
thereof of each other /
IN the time of king Charles of France the year of our lord Ihesu Christ
MCClxxj / was in the land of vyennoys a rich baron daulphyn and lord of the
land that was named sir Godefroy of alaunson and was of the kings kynrede of
france / the which daulphyn was ryt mighty and a great lord both in hauoyr
and in lands / and was a right wise man / in so much that for his great
wysedom he was much made of / both of the king of france and of all the
lords and barons of his court / so that no thing was done in the said
royame but that he was called thereto / and had to his wife a much fair lady
which cleped was dame dyane which was of so great beaulte that she was well
worthy and dygne to be named after that fair sterre yt men call dyane that
appyereth and shows a little before the day / and also she was replenysshed of
all noblenes and gentylnes that a lady may or ought to have / The said daulphyn
then and this noble lady dyane were vij year to gyder without issue that
much they desired to have / and prayed our lord both night and day that they
might have children playsaunt and ready to his deuyne service / and our lord
thorugh his benygnyte herd their prayer / and after his playsyr gaf unto them
the viij year of their marriage a right fair daughter for the which / great
gladness ^ Joy was made thorugh all the daulphyns land / and the child was
baptized with great honor and Joy / and in token of great love they named her
vyenne by cause the cite where she was borne in was called vyenne / and this
daughter was delyuerd unto a noble lady for to be nourysshed with her / the
which lady was of the said cite and had a little daughter of the age of vyenne
the which was named ysabel / and so the fair vye^ne was nourysshed with the
same ysabel from her tender age unto many year after / and so great love was
between them both that they called each other systers / and the fair vyenne
grew and encrea^ed ever in souerayn beawte and gentylnesse / so that the
renomee of her excellent beawte flourysshed not only through al france but
also through all the Royame of england and other contrees / It happed after she
was xv year of age that she was desired to marriage of many knytes and great
lords / and at that time was in the daulphyns court emonge many his knytes /
a noble man of ancient lygnage and of fair lands / the which was well byloued
of the daulphyn and of all the lords of the land and was called sir James /
this noble man had a much fair sone that had to name Paris / and his fader
made him to be taught in all good custommes / and when he was xviij year of age
he was adressed to the dyscyplyne of arms / and demened him self so nobly and
worthily in all manner deeds of chyualrye that within a short time after he was
doubed knight by the hand of the said lord daulphyn / No fayte of knyghthode
ne none adventure of chyualrye happed after but that he found him self at it
in so much that the renommee of him ran through all the world and men said he
was one of the best knytes yt might be found in any contree / and held him
self right clean in arms and lived chastely and Ioyefully / and had ever about
him fowls hawks and hounds for his dysporte to all manner of huntyng
suffysaunt enough for a duc or for an earl / and through his prowess and
hardynes he was acqueynted and known of many other great lords / and emonge
all other he was gretely and louyngly acqueynted with a young knight of the
cite of vyenne that hight Edward / and were both of one age and much loved
each other / and as two brethern of arms went ever to gyder there as they
knew any Ioustyng or appertyse of arms to be had for to get honor / And
wete it well that beside their worthynes in arms they were good musycyens
playeng upon all manner Instruments of musyke / and could sing very well /
but Paris passed in all ponytes his fellow Edward / Notwythstondyng Edward was
amerous al ready of a noble lady of the court of braban / but Paris as yet
knew naught of amorouste but not long after Venus the gods of love fyred
his thout with the heart unto a noble young lady / that is to wete the fair
vyenne the daulphyns daughter of vyennoys that was his lyege lord / and the
more he growed toward his flouryng age ye more he was esprysed and brennyng of
her love for the grrte beauty yt was in her / But Paris thought ever in his
heart that this love was not well lykly ne cordable / For he was not of so high
lygnage as the noble maiden vyenne was of / and therefore Paris kept his love
secret that none should perceive it sauf Edward his trusty fellow to whom he
brake and showed his counceyl And the fair vyenne perceived not that paris was
amerous of her / nor paris also durst neither show nor say nothing to her of
hit / but the more that he saw her the more grew ye fire of love within him
self /

How Paris and Edward his fellow played with diverse Instruments by night
tofore the chamber of vyenne /
Paris then and edward with one accord dysposed them self for to give sum
melodyous myrthe to the noble maid vyenne / and with their musycal
Instruments / as recourders / they yede by night time to gyder toward that
part of the castle where as the fair vyenne lay in her chamber / and there
they sange full swetely and sowned melodyously their musycal Instruments and
pypes / and certain the melodye of their songs and the sown of their
Instrument was so playsaunt and so sweet that it passed al other melodye / And
when the daulphyn and his wife and the fair vyenne their daughter herd this
sweet and melodyous sown / as well of ma^s wyces as of diverse Instruments they
had great Joy and took great playsyr at it and had great desire to know what
they were that so great solace and Joy made tofore their castle / and for to
wete and know what they were the daulphyn assygned a day of a feste at the
which he sent for all manner mynstrellys in his land / chargyng them upon
great pain that they should come for to play before him and his barons in his
castle of vyenne / and ^ohan they were al come they played and sange in their
best wise / but among them were not found tho mynstrelles that the lord
daulphyn sought fore / whereof he was sorouful and desired more to know what
they were than he did before / And when vyenne herd all the mynstrellys of the
bond that sowned at ye feste she said to ysabel her damoysel and preuy fellow
/ by my faith sweet sister these mynstrellys playen nout to the regard of them
that were wont to come before our chamber / and me dysplayseth much that I
may not know them / for certeynly they come not hither for naught / for they
love outher you or me /

When the daulphyn understood his daughters words he wyllyng to playse her
said unto her that if it were possible she should know what they were that so
sange every night before her chamber / wherefore he ordained x men of arms and
commanded them to hyde them self pryuely there as the sown was herd / and
that they should bring to him other by force or otherwise them that made that
sweet melodye / Now came the night that the ij young knights Paris and Edward
that no thing knew of thembusshement that was laid for them came with their
Instruments toward the castle and there they began to sing and sowned their
Instruments so melodyously that great playsyr it was to here / and when they
had song and would have returned thither as they were come fro / the x knights
lepte and came forth and sa^^wed them curtoyslle saying that they needs must
come with them for to speak with their lord the daulphyn / Then said Paris to
them / Fair lords abide a little while / if it playse you and of us ye shall
have an / ansuer Then went Paris and edward a part and spoke to gyder / ye
see fair brother said Paris to Edward in what party we be now and I would not
that ye should have by me any dysplay sir nor harm / but so much I tell you
that or I should suffer me to be led tofore the daulphyn I had lever deye /
therefore fair brother advise we what is best for to do / and edward heryng
paris words said / brother mine have no fere of no thing and let us do as
ye will / Then said they to the x men of arms lords through your curtosye
suffer us to return thither as we came fro / for we be at my lord the daulphyns
playsyr and of all the lords and barons of his court but in any manner as for
this time we may not fulfylle his commandment /

When the said x men of arms saw the ij knights dysobeyssaunt / they ansuerd
to them ye shall now come to him other with your will or by force / and bygan
to pulle out their swerdes and came against the two young knights that naked
were from al arms sauf their swerdes and their bowclers / wherwyth they couerd
them and so manfully deffended their bodyees that they hurt and wounded sore
all the ten armed men in so much that they maad them all to void and flee fro
the place whether they would or not / And on the morrow erly the ten men of
arms came tofore the daulphyn all wounded and sore hurt / And they recounted
to him how two young men only had arrayed them so and how they needs must flee
for fere of their lives / whereof the daulphyn was right angry to see them so
sore hurt and took great dysplaysyr of it / and thought well that the said two
young knights were of great strength and virtue / wherefore he commanded an
hundred men to be ready for to espy and take them the night following if they
came ageyn chargyng that none hurt should be done to them / but after their
song done / they should be brought unto him / but this enterprise came to none
effect / for the two young knights came not ageyn but kept all that they had
done secret / when the fair vye^ne saw that she myt not know what these
mynstrellys were she thought they were sum great lords that were amerous of
her / and she and her damoysel ysabel spoke of none other thing than of these
mynstrelles and had great playsyr to talk of them / Paris seeing he durst not
say nor show the great love that he had to the fair vyenne / thought he would
hyde his courage from her / wherefore he took acquaintance with the bishop of
Saint Laurence the which learned him holy scripture / The daulphyn then seeing
his daughter full tryste and pensyful for this that she might not know the said
mynstrelles that so melodyously played tofore her chamber / he ordained a
Ioustyng place within his cite of vyenne and made lystes and scaffoldes to be
set up and sent his herauldes in france in England and in normandye to
anounce and show unto al knytes and gentylmen that would do faytes of arms
and of chyualrye for love of al ladies and damoyselles / that the Ioustes should
be holden the first day of may / in the cite of vyenne / And he that should do
best in arms / should have of the Daulphyns daughter a shield of crystalle of
great valurr / and a garlond with roses and flowers of fyn gold / And wete ye
well that vyenne the noble and fair maiden was right glad of the Ioustes that
her fader ordained for her sake / Fro great talent and desire she had to know
him that was so amerous of her / and she thought he would be at the said first
day of may at vyenne /

After the messagers that had pronounced the Ioustes were comen ageyn to the
cite of vyenne / the most part of the knights and gentylmen of the Royame of
France of England and of Normandye made them ready for to come to the cite of
Vyenne to the said Ioustes / And in especyal many noble barons of the royame of
England and of france that amerous were of the fair vyenne for the renomme of
her great beaulte / came to the said Ioustes with rich and noble array /
emonge whom was Johan duc of bourbon neuew to the king of france Edward the
kings sone of england / Anthony sone to the earl of prouence / Gherard the
marquys sone of Mountferat / and wyllyam sone to the duc of Carnes / Paris
then knowing this noble assemble and the Ioustes that should be the first day
of May thought in him self whether he should goo thither or not / but the great
love that he had to the fair vyenne constrained him thereto / Nevertheless he
took counceyl of Edward his fellow the which answered to him / if ye goo I will
hold you compa^ye thither / but we must depart secretly that we be not known
/ and anon they made ready their harnoys and pourueyed them of good horses
which they harneysed al in whyt / and none other token they had on them
whereby they might be known sauf that they were arrayed al in whyt and one like
that other / The day of the Ioustes then approached and all the lords and
barons before said came ij days before the feste to ye cite of vyenne where the
daulphyn for love of them did do make a noble scaffold where as the fair
vyenne was rychely arrayed / and all that saw her were ameruaylled of her /
great beauty To that feste came many noble knights and squyers clothed and
arrayed rychely after the guyse of their contree / and there were many
mynstrellys playeng upon al manner Instruments / and many good syngars which
the noble maid vyenne herkened full well For her heart was only set to think
how she might know him that was her lover / paris then came thither and was
ordained for to serve at the daulphyns table where vyenne satte / and wete ye
well that full gracyously and curtoysly he served and kerued before her /

How Paris gate the prys of the Ioustes in the cite of Vyenne /
When the day was comen that the lords knights and ge^tylmen should Just for
love of the ladies / Paris and Edward yede to a secret place where they armed
them secretly and syn came to the lystes with their badges and tokens and were
horsed and armed full rychely and well / All other knights there were known by
their arms / but the two whyt knights were unknown /

The daulphyn then commanded that every one should mustre or the Ioustyng
began along the field tofore the ladies and damoyselles / and so they mostred
rydyng tofore the scaffold of the fair vyenne and were so nobly and rychely
armed and arrayed / and so godely men they were that every one said / the flower
of knyghthode may now be seen in this place / a emonge al other princes Edward
of England was most amerous of al and right reno^med in arms / The pucelle
Vyenne soyng all these noble knights / said to her damoysel ysabel / Fair
sister which of them al think you that most does for the love of me / and
ysabel ansuerd / honorable lady me seems he that bears the lion of gold in
his arms does more for your love than the other / Certes said vyenne yonder
two whyt knights that bear none arms in their sheldes are more to my fantasye
than any of the other always / we shall see now what they can do / Then were
the knights ready to do fayte of arms / And first an hardy and valyaunte
knight that bare in his arms a crown of gold bygan the first course / and
against him ran the good knight edward paris fellow and recou^tred each other
so vygorously yt they brake both their speres / many other met each other
sodaynlye gyuyng great strokes / sum were overthrown to the earth and sum
brake their speres worthily and kept their sterops right valyauntly / the other
recountred each other so manfully that both horse and man were cast to the
ground / For every man did his best to get worship there / Edward the kings
sone of england bare him full well and had the better upon many a knyt there /
but the strong knyt paris broched his horse toward him / and met him so
vygorously that at end he ouerthrewe him and had the better of him whereof he
gate great worship and was much praised for his great prowess / This Ioustyng
lasted till souper time / and when yt even came many of them were weary of the
Iouste and rested them / but paris did then more of arms showing his
meruayllous prowess than he had done of all that day in so much that none
durst approach him ne with stand his appertyse in arms / and so much he did
that thonour and prys of the Ioustes rested and abode in him that day /

How the shield of crystal and the garlond with flowers of gold were yeuen to
Paris as to the best doer in faytes of arms /
THe feste ended / great worship and loenge abode to ye ij knytes with ye whyt
arms / and Paris was led unto the scaffold there as vye^ne was the which
delyuerd him the shield of crystal and the garlond with flowers of gold that
she held in her hand / and then paris with Edward his felawe departed thens
in the secretest wise that they could and went to v^arme them to ye place
where they first armed them self / The ^^^ons and knights that were there
spoke well of the prowess and of the chyualrye of the knights with the whyt
arms so that the daulphyn and the other great lords had great desire to know
what they were and to have their acqu^yntaunce / but they departed so secretly
fro the field that no man knew where they were become nor what way they took

AFter al this was thus done the knights returned in to their contrees spekyng
ever of the ryal feste and chere that the daulphyn had done to them / and of
the prowess of the whyt knights and of the right souerayn beauty and noblesse
of vyenne / And in the mean while there moeued a stryf betwyxte the barons and
knytes of Frauunce and of England For sum were there that were amerous of the
daughter of the duc of Normandye / and sum were that loved and bare out the
bealute of the sister of the king of England / saying she was fayrer than
Vyenne was / and other were there that held contrary oppynyon saying that the
daulphyns daughter vyenne passed in beauty al other wymmen in the world / and
for this reason was great debate and stryf betwyxte the knytes of france and
them of England for the beauty of these three damoyselles / Ever multeplyed and
grew more the bruyt and the reno^me of the daulphyn by cause of the Ioustes
and tournoyment done in his cite of vyenne / whereof he had great Joy / for
they had be much honorable and playsaunt to al knights / And Vyenne ever
thought in her self who might he be that had gotten the worship and prys of the
Ioustes and said to ysabel / Never trust me dear suster but ye knyt to whom I
have yeuen the shield of crystal and my garlond is he that so swetely sange for
the love of me tofore our chamber / for mine heart gives it me / and by my faith
sister he is full noble and worthy / and in all his deeds right curtoys and
gentyl as we might have seen whylere wherefore I say you my sweet sister that in
him I have put the rote of mine entyere heart / my will and al my love / nor
never I shall have playsyr ne Joy unto ye time that I know what he is / for my
love is al his / and of what so ever estate he be of I never shall take mine
heart fro him / Then began she to wayle and syghe for the love of him full
tenderly / for till now she had not felt the sparkles of love that sprange out
of her heart / but paris knew nothing hereof yt she desired to have him and to
know what he was / but he kept his love secret in his heart / For he durst
not show it unto her wherefore he led his life in great trystesse and sorrow
he went ever in the felawshyp of the bishop of saint Laurence and made
semblaunte of nothing And James the fader of Paris that had seen the noble
feast and the ryal Ioustes in the cite of vyenne / wenyng to him that his sone
paris had not ben there was full sorry and had gr^te dysplaysyr of it and said /
Fair sone Paris I am in a great malencolye and in a thought for you that ye be
not so Ioyeful ne merry as ye were wont to be / here before time I saw you ever
ready to the Ioustes and to al manner faytes of chyualrye for to get honor /
and I now see you al changed syn ye took acquaintance with this bishop for
loathe I were to see you bycome a man of relygyon as I fere he will bring you to
/ and right wroth I am that ye were not at that noble and ryal tournoyment
that has be holden in vyenne for the sake of all the ladies of this land /
wherefore dear sone I pray you to take heed to your self that ye lose not your
good renommee / your worship ne the praysyng also that ye gate before time / and
that ye spend not your yongthe in yo^enesse / And Paris heryng all this
ansuerd no thing to his fader but abode stylle pensyf^^ll thynkyng on ye
beauty of vye^ne /

NOw says thystorye that as ye have herd above a great stryf befyl among the
knights aforesaid for the love of the three damoyse^les before said / For the
earls sone of Flaundres was gretely wroth for this cause with the Duc of
brennes and had beten and hurt sore each other so that none myt make the pees
betwyxte them / For either of hem mayntened and bare out the beauty of his
lady It happed then that five knights hardy and valyaunte came forth the
which said that they were ready to fight and for to prove by force of arms
that Florye the dukes daughter of Normandye was the fairest damoysel of all
the world / And Incontinent stert up five other knights that said and
mayntened that cou^taunce the kings sister of england was the fairest / And
forthwyth other v knights rose up that mayntened and vphelde the beauty of
vyenne above all other wymmen in the world in so much that this debute came to
the knowleche of the king of France which said that hereof might grow a great
trouble and dyscorde among his barons and other lords / So sent he word to
them that they should come toward him and that he should give such a sentence
upon their stryf that they al should be thereof content / the which message
p^^sed them well and came (...) toward him as soon as they might / And when they
were come tofore the king they spoke of their stryf / But anon the king
ordained a Ioustes for the lou^ of the said three ladies / and made his
m^undement that they al should come with their arms and horse for to Iouste the
viij day of septembre in the cite of paris / and they that should do best in
arms at that day they should have the prys and the worship of the feste and the
lady on whose beauty they held with should be reputed and holden for the fairest
damoysel of all the world / The king of France then sent word to the
faders of the foresaid three ladies prayeng them to come at same feste and that
either of them should bring with him a present of richesse the which three
presents should be yeuen in the worship of their three daughters to the best
doer in arms in token of vyctorye / And thus the king of england first sent
for his sister Constau^ce a fair crown of gold all set with perlys and
precious stones of great value / The duc of Normandye for love of his daughter
Florye sent a right fair garlond set with diverse perlys and precious stones
much rich and of great extymacyon / And the daulphyn for love of his daughter
vyenne sent a much rich coler of gold al enuyronned with precious stones of,
diverse colors / the which was worth a right great tresour / And these three
Iewellys were delyuerd to the king of France / The foresaid knights then
made them ready and apparaylled al things according to the Ioustes / and in
rich array came al to the cite of Paris / and wete ye well that in France was
not seen before that day so great noblesse of barons and knights as were there
assembled / for there were the most hye princes and barons of england of
France and of Normandye and either of them did set al his wit and
en^endement to uphold and bear out that they had purposed and said / and
every baron gaf his lyuerey that they should be known each fro other / and the
bruyt and reno^me was that my lady constaunce should have thonour of that feste
for this that many a fair and hardy knight made them ready to mayntene the
quarelle of her beaulte / but nevertheless either of these three parties hoped to
have the worship of the feste / and paris that was in vyenne the cite / and
that well knew the great apparaylle of this feste / took counceyl of Edward his
felawe whether he should goo to paris or not / And Edward counceylled him to goo
thither / so that he went secretly / and said if ye goo thither secretly and if
god give you grace that ye get the worship of the feste / great well and good
shall come to you thereby / and if ye goo and be known the. daulphyn and the
other lords shall not preyse you so much as they should if ye were unknown
for cause that ye be not of so great lygnage as they be / another is if ye goo
openl^y and that my lady vyenne happeth to have thonour of the feste by your
prowess / she shall naught be set by / consyderyng the other great lords
that shall be there procedyng your degree / and if she get the worship of the
feste by a knight unknown the love and honor shall grow the more in her
courage toward him that thus has done for her sake / wherefore I counceyl you
to goo thither in the most secretest wise that ye may / for my trust is that
ye shall get great worship there / and but if ye goo / trust me I shall make my
self ready to goo thither for you / For I will be loathe to s^e the beaulte of my
lady vye^ne to be rebuked At these words granted Paris to goo to the said
Ioustes / and when he was ready and ha^^ al things according to a noble knight
he departed in the secretest manner that he might toward the cite of paris
wh^re as the king of France maad great prouysyon of all manner metes and of al
other things necessary to such a ryal fe^te / And in the mids of the cite
of paris he ordained the place where the knights should Iouste and did do make
many fair scaffoldes for the ladies and damoyselles to be set on / for to be
hold the Ioustyng / Also he did do make three baners full fair and rich / the
first baner was whyt / and there was wryton upon hit in letters of gold /
vyenne daughter to my lord godfroy of alenson daulphyn of vyennoys / the second
baner was read / and was wryton thereon in letters of gold / Constaunce the
kings sister of england / The third baner was whyt and in letters of gold was
wryton thereon / Florye daughter to the duc o^ nor^andye / and these iij baners
were pyght up at the three corns of the field / and wete ye that so great prees
was there that the people took their place upon the scaffoldes ij days before
the feste for to see the great people and the fair ordinance that there was /

When it was so that the lords were ready of all ^hynges that were necessary
/ and were departed fro their contrees they assembled al at paris the xiiij day
of septembre / and never tofore was seen so great a company of nobles / For
fro all parties was comen great chyualrye / the so^me for to do arms / and
the other for to see the feste which was much sumptuous and noble / and when
the day assygned came of the Ioustes / On the morning erly he did do set
these three Ioya^^^ or Jewels in the baners / the which shone and
resplendysshed much merueillously for the nombre of perles and precious stones
that were in the baners / Now it should be ouerlonge to recyte of the barons and
of the knights that were in that Iourneye / For many were comen thither fro the
royame of spain / of aragon and of many other contrees for to prove their
strength and persons / and for to mayntene the barons that m^yntened the three
ladies maidens / Of whom we shall reherce of the pryncypallest here after the
shortest wise we may / And when it came in the morning that every man was armed
and apparaylled in the field / and that the king of France was set in his
hrete scaffolde / and began to say al alowde and much meruayllously / that
all the people might here and understand / Knights and barons that been here
for to do the fayte of arms goo ye eueryche under that baner that he will
mayntene for the love of his lady / and we give in commandment that this field
be of love and of curtosye / as i^ to you appert^yneth / how be it we will well
that each of you do valyantly his arms and his chyualryes for that damoysel^
which he will mayntene / And he that shall win the field shall have the prys
and thonour of the feste / and that lady or damoysel shall be mayntened and
allowed for the most fair damoysel of the world / and shall have the prys and
thonour of them of England of France and of Normandye / and that to this no
man be so hardy to gaynsay upon the pain to lose his life / And yet after this
he said / ye see here a fair crown the which the queen of France has
ordained / to the end that it be delyuerd to the fader of the damoysel that shall
have the prys and honor of the field and of the Ioustes / And the knight that
shall get the prys and thonour of the Ioustes shall have all the three baners and
the three Jewels that been in them / and commanded that the baner of Normandye
should first make his mustre / and next the baner of Constaunce and then that
of Vyenne / And first under the baner of Normandye were they that follow / that
is to wete Johan sone of therle of Flaunders / Phelyp of bauyers neuew of the
king of France / Edward sone of the duke of bourgoyne / Johan earl of Armynak
/ Balaxe brother of the marquys of Saluce Geffroy duc of pycardye / And after
them came many other well armed and habylled / After came the baner of
Co^staunce / the which accompanied Johan sone of the duc of bremeos /
Gastamons of gastre brother of the earl of foyes / Anthonye alegre sone of the
duc of Carnes / Larer neuew of the duc of bourgoyne / The honorable Johan of
braban / Salamon de launson brother of therle of the march / and after them
came many other barons and knights / and then after came the baner of the

sone of the king of England / Wylliam sone of the duc of barry / Antonye sone
of the count of prouynce / Paris sone of sir Jacques of vyenne / Dormando of
monferrant sone of the marquys / three sons of the duc of Carnes / Johan
peryllous duc of Normandye / and after them came many other barons and knights
well armed and well horsed / And when the mustre was made / every baner returned
in to his place / which much noble and meruayllous thing was it to see and
to byholde the noblesse of the barons and knights so well horsed and armed as
they were / And the daulphyn and sir Jacques fader of Paris were comen for to
see the feste and the Ioustes /

How Paris wan the prys at the Ioustes in the cite of Paris /
When then it came to the hour of tyerce began the Ioustes / and came in to
the field much nobly armed Johan sone of therle of flaundres / and ageyn him
came Johan sone of the duke of breunes and coped to gyder so fyersly yt they
brake their speres / and Johan sone of therle of flaunders tombled to therthe
under his horse / and after against Johan de breunes came Edward sone of the duke
of bourgoyne / These ij knights beat down puyssauntly Johan de breunes / unto
the time yt there came against him Johan peryllous duc of Normandye / which
smote him with so great force that he ouerthrewe him under his horse and brake
his arm and put him in such estate that he wist not whether it was day or
night / and against Johan peryllous came Anthonye alegre sone of the duc of
carues / and did so moc^^ prowess with his person that he conquered Johan
peryllous and v other knights mighty men of his party whom he smote to the
earth by force of arms / After came against anthony alegre Geffroy of
pycardye and smote anthony in such wise that he fyl to the earth / and vj
other strong knights of his party / and after did so meruayllous feats of
arms / that every man said that he had thonour of the field / And then came
the free knight paris against geffroy beryng low his spear / and they gaf so
great strokes that the knights and horses went al to therthe / wherefore the
king said / that sithe both two were thrown to the earth / that they should
return ageyn to the Ioustes / and paris with a great desire consented / and
so both returned and came rennyng / And Paris gaf to geffroy so great a
stroke / that his horse slode and then geffroy ouerthrewe to the earth / but
by cause that the horse slode it was said that the horse was cause that he
ouerthrewe / For much they mayntened geffroy and said that he was not
vaynquysshed / and that it should be well done that they should Just ageyn / And
by cause that Paris was not known there was none that mayntened him ne
sustained / nevertheless the king of france knew well that geffroy was
vaynquysshed loyally and well / For he had well seen the adventure / and would do
no wrong unto the knight which was of great strength and might / and anon
sent to him an heraulde which said to him in the name of the king of france
/ that the king had well seen and well knew that Paris had vaynquysshed his
knight / Notwythstondyng if he would yet ones return to the Just by his
noblesse that he should do him self great honor And then Paris maad his
ansuer saying that the beaulte of my lady vye^ne was so great that in all the
world was none to her like / that if it pleased the King I am ready for to
furnysshe the Ioustes for his love against the knight yet another time / and to
Just till that geffroy should be vaynquysshed / and that was without any gayn
saying / and the heraulde returned and told it to the king / whereof the king
was well content and said that the knight ought to be sum great lord / For he
was of great valoyr and puyssaunce and spoke much swetely and curtoysly / And
after Paris changed and took another horse / which Edward his fellow had made
ready for him and returned to the Iustes / and smote to gyder with so great
might / that by very force geffroy went to therthe under his horse right evil
hurt /

Then when it came toward even the Ioustes were so great thycke and strong
that all the three parties as well of one as of other were thrown down to the
earth / that there abode no moo of the party of vyenne but paris allone / and
of the party of normandye three knights strong and puyssau^t and they were
Balaxo brother of the marquys of Saluces / Johan sone of the earl of Army nack
/ and phelyp of bauyere / and of the party of constaunce other three strong
and mighty / that is to wete Johan of braband / la^er neuew of the duc of
bourgeyn / and Salamon dalanson brother of ye count de la march and they said
that the Iustes should abide till on the morn / for they were much weary / and
when paris saw that they would have returned / he fewtred his spear / and there
came against him balaxo brother of the marquys of saluces / And Paris at the
first stroke struck him down to the earth under his horse / and in like wise did
to the other v / and much nobly and valyauntly he wanne thonour of the Iustes
and of the field /

How the king commanded that the three baners with the in Iewellys should be
given to Paris champyon of vyenne /
THe Ioustes fynysshed Paris wanne the beauty of his lady the fair vyenne /
and he was led to the scaffolde where as the king was / and the other great
lords and knights and there were delyuerd to him the three baners and the three
Iewellys that were in them / and Paris showed them through all the field / in
sign that the said vyenne had gotten thonour for to be the fairest damoysell
that was in all the world by the same young knight / and when Paris had the
three fair baners and the three rich Iewellys / he and Edward his fellow
departed out of the cite of paris and out of france the most secret wise
that they might / and returned in to dalphyne / Paris returned in to the
company of the foresaid bishop of Saint Laurence / as he had not been at the
feste / and always he demanded tidings of the Iustes that were made in
france / and who had thonour of the Ioustes /

When the feste was made all the barons and knights that were there had (...)
desire to know who was (...) that so valyauntly and so nobly (...) won the
Iourneye and the honor of the Iustes for to do to him worship / but they
could never know him / whereof they had great dysplaysyr / and said that the
knight was of great wysedom / by cause he would not be known / And after this
the barons and knights took leave of the king / and returned in to their lands
al dyscomforted / by cause they had not gotten the honor of the feste / and yet
were they more angry by cause they knew not to whom the honor was given of
the feste ne of the Iustes / The king of France which much loved the dolphyn
made to him great feste and much great honor / And the king delyuerd to him
the crown that the queen had given / for to give to her that should have the
honor of the Ioustes / to the end that he should give it unto his daughter
vyenne in sign and token that she was the most fair damoysel of the world /
and when al this was done / the dolphyn and the fader of paris returned in to
dolphyne in much great honor and gre^e Joy / when vyenne knew that her
fader came she came and met him as she was accustomed / Then when the
dolphyn saw her / he kyssed her and set on her head the crown which the
king had given him / and told to her how she had goton the honor for to be
the most fairest damoysell of the world / and loo here is the fair crown that
the queen of france sends to you in token that ye have gotten the honor /
Not wythstondyng fair daughter / that ye have had many contrary thereto / but
ye have had a good deffendour and ryt strong and has well quyted him in your
need / For of each party were abyden three knights much strong and
p^yssaunte / and on your party was left but one knight only which
vaynquysshed all the other / without any token / and is departed all secretly
that no man knew him ne the king of france has no knowleche of him / but he
has borne away with him the three baners and the iij Iewellys that were in
them and also the prys and thonour of the feste / wherefore sweet and fair
daughter ye wot never to whom to give thankynges of so much honor as has be
done for you / but I pray to god of heaven and to the glorious vyrgyn marye /
that it playse him to give to him good and honor / Joy and excellence and in
all his feats vyctorye / like as he is chyef and head of al honor and of al
chyualrye in this world For I never saw ne herd of knight that so gracyously
and so curtoysly bare him in his arms and in his chyualryes / And when vye^ne
herd sp^ke of these tidings / and saw the great honor and prys that she had
gotten and al was comen by this noble knight / she said to ysabeau her damoysel
/ My suster said I not to you well but late / that I was byloued by the most
noble and valiant knight of france / and and by my faith my sweet suster /
this is he yt so swetely song and that wanne the Iustes in this cite and bare
with him the shield of crystal and my garlonde / and went his way so that no
man might know him / advise you well fair suster what hanour is comen to me by
his prowess and by his bounte / I may well be sorry and dolant / when I may not
know who he is / and mine heart is much heavy and mine entend^ment that I never
can find the moyen to see and know him / and yet she said / Certes my sweet
suster ysabeau / I believe that my days be short / and that I shall deye of
sum cruel and falls death for the great desplaysyr that I have contynuelly in
my heart / for I can none other thing do but weep and waylle / and always to
continue in sorouful life and heavy but none apperceyued it but only her
damoysel ysabeau /

THe fader of paris which had been with the dolphyn in that feste had not seen
there his sone Paris / whereof he had great sorrow in his heart / for he had
seen that he was accustomed to be in all noble Iustes / but then he saw him
goo with the bishop of saint Laurence / and dysposed him not to do arms as
he was woned / wherefore he said to him on a day My sone I had hoped to have had
in the great consolacyo^ / but now thou byngest me in to great heaviness and
dysplaysyr / when I see that thou wylt not depart from this bishop wherefore I
pray the that you leave him / and do so that it may be to me playsaunt and to
the honneste / Paris herd him well / but he gaf not a word to ansuer The fader
of Paris seeing this went to his secret fellow Edward and said to him / I see
well that the great amytye and love that ye have to my sone / and know ye for
certain that I have in my heart great melancolye when I remember that Paris has
had great honor and fame of chyualrye / and now I see that he gooth al with
this bishop / and leteth his hawks / his hounds and horse to deye for hongre
/ wherefore I pray you that ye will give me sum counceyl / which am so
meschaunt that I deye for sorrow / And when he had said these words / Edward
had pity of him / and comforted him the best wy^e he could / and departed fro
him / and went strayte to his fellow Paris and said to him I know well that
love constrayneth the so strongely / that thou have no power over thy self /
wherefore thy life may not long endure / And also thy fader and thy friends ben
evil content against the / and I say to the that for to be virtuous and
valiant it playseth much to god / And for the love of one woman thou do
much desplaysyr to thy fader / And also for no person what someuer he or she
be / thou ought not to lose the well and renomee that thou have of chyualrye
/ It appyereth not in the / that thou have ouy virtue or courage / wherefore I
pray the that thou wylt do sum thing that it may be playsaunt to thy fader
which has desired and prayed me that I should so say to the / when paris had
herd all this / he ansuerd to edward and said to him / I know well that these
things that thou have said to me been virtuous and honnest / but they been to
me grievous / for to put me from the thoughts in which I am contynuelly /
Nevertheless I pray the that thou give me counceyl what is best that I do /
Then said edward it should well playse me / if it were thy playsyr that we
should goo in to braband / For it is vj months passed that I have not seen my
lady / and there shall we do arms / by which we may get fame and honor / and
paris agreed thereto saying that he was content if it playsed him so to do /
and Incontinent they made ready their harnoys and horses and all things
necessary to them / and or Paris departed he put in his chamber all the things
and pryses that he had wo^ne by chyualryes and closed them fast in his chamber
/ and delyuerd the keye to his mother and prayed her much derly that she should
not open it / ne suffer yt any person should enter therein / And after they
went toward Braband / where as they did great feats of chyualrye and Ioustes
whereof they gate great honor and worship / and were much praised of ladies
and damoysellys / And paris made countenance for to have abyden in braband for
the love of edward but his heart drew unto the fair Vyenne / whom he so
much loved in his heart secretly /

How Dyane and vyenne her daughter wenten to vysyte the fader of Paris the
which was seek /
NOw it happened that during this time that Paris and Edward duel leden in
Braband / the fader of Paris fyl in to a sickness of foures or access / And
the cause came of the thought that he had of ^ys sone Paris / And he being seek
the doulphyn went on a day to see him / and demanded the cause of his maladye
/ and comforted him the best wise that he could / and after returned home / and
said to his wife / that it were well done that she should goo see and vysyte
messyre Jacques which was seek / And forthwyth Incontinent my lady dyane / her
daughter Vyenne and ysabeau her damoysel with a great company went to the
castle of Sir Jacques / and salewed him much nobly as it well apperteyned / and
the best wise that they might And when they were in the chamber where messyre
Jacques was and lay / Dame dyane demanded him of his sickness And messire
Jacques said that al his dys^ase came for his sone Paris / by cause he lost so
his time / and that he went always with the bishop of Saint laurence / whereof I
fere me that he shall become a man of relygyon / I have no moo children but him
/ I wot not what I shall do with the goods that god has given to me / And
my lady dyane comforted him and said that his sone was much well byloued of the
doulphyn / and that he had much great amytye of many great lords / barons and
knights / and also she said that among al things he should ordeyne for his
health / and after all this the mother of paris prayed her that it might playse
her to come see the castle / and she ansuerd that she much desired it Then
the mother of paris showed her all the castle / and led her in to an halle al
full of arms and abylemens of war for to fight in battle / After she ladde
her in to anothrr halle where as were many hawks / faulcens / and many other
fowls of chase / And after in to many other halles and chambres rychely arrayed
which were over long to reherce / And after the mother of Paris showed unto
her the chamber of Paris where that he slepte / wherein were many abylments /
which should well suffyse ye chamber of a great prince And in the said chamber
were two great standards couerd after the guyse of France / That one was full
of clo^he of gold and sylke / and that other of harnoys and of many other
things / Then said Vyenne to y^abeau / by my faith fair sister I have no
great meruaylle of th^s young knight Paris though of him be maad great m^ncyon
/ For thordynaunce of these things show well that he is of great valor / And
in byholdyng of these things she saw a couerture of an horse all white / And
her seemed that it was the same that the knight b^re that wanne the prys of the
Ioustes that was made in the cite of Vyenne / and that had the shield of
crystal and the garlond which she told to ysabeau And ysabeau ansuerd to her /
never think ye so / For all day been made semalable couertures and tokenes
white / whereof ye may well be deceived / Vyenne enforced all way her self to
t^ke better head / and of the great Joy that she had she said to her mother /
Madame I am a little crased and suddenly taken / wherefore if it playse you I
would feign rest a little in this chamber / and late me be all allone with my
suster ysabeau / for I will have none other / and anon each body avoided out
of the chamber / and ysabeau did shytte the door that none might come in /
Then said vyenne now we shall see if we may find any thing that we may have
better knowleche of / For mine heart says yes / After that they had serched and
vysyted all the chamber / they came on a side of the chamber where they fond a
little door / of which henge a little keye by a thwonge / and anon they opened
the door and entered therein And there was a little chamber which was xij foot
long / and was an oratorye / where as was the mageste of our Lord Ihesu Christ
upon a little altar and at each corner was a canstyke of silver / and thither
came Paris for to make his sacrefyse when he aroos / and when he went to his
bed /

And there were the three baners that the noble knight Paris had won in the
cite of Paris / And the three Iewellys of the three damoyselles before said / And
in the same place was also the shield of Crystal and the garlond that Vyenne
delyuerd to him when he wa^ne the prys at the Ioustes in the cite of vyenne /
And all these he kept secret in that place / And when vyenne saw these
things / she was sure that Paris was he whom she had so much desired to
know / and that so much honor had done to her / and for the great Joy that
she had / she set her down on the ground / and there abode a great while /
and could not speak a word / And after she spoke to ysabeau / and said my sweet
sister / blessed and preysed be our lord of this good Journey / For me thinks
I should never depart out of this chamber / Alas I have so long abyden to
know / who he was that so swetely played in his Instruments so nygh unto me /
and now he is so far / and then ysabeau began to repreue her and said to
her / Sweet lady I pray you that ye say ne do any thing which might torn you
to folly / and be ye ruled by wysedom and reason / For not wythstondyng that
paris have so much good and virtues / yet ye ought to consider that he is not
^gal to you in lygnage ne in estate / For I know well that many noble and
puyssaunt lords have demanded you in marriage / and love you and do great
things for you / and also thonour of Paris which is your vayssal and subget
is not egall ne worthy unto you / Then vyenne was much angry on ysabeau and
began to say / A very god I am well dyscomforted and deceived by the / that
thus again say me of him that I so long have desired to know / Alas I had
supposed that in no thing ye would have dysplaysed me / And in good faith I say
to the / that this man I will love and demand / and I promise the in good
faith / that if thou any more gaynsaye me I shall slay my self / and then thou
shall be caus^ of my death / For I will not lose him that I have so long loved /
but I say to the for truth / that if thou ever say to me such words of my
friend paris / that thou shall never after have space to say them ageyn another
time / for if thou consyderest well his noble condycyons and custommes / thou
sholdest preyse him better than thou do / And know thou not well that the
king of france would that it had cost him half his Royame that his sone Lowys
were as valyaunte as paris is / And also there be many notable lords that
desire to know his nam^ / and to have his amytye /

Then take heed and byholde by my faith if ever thou saw man that might be
compared to him / certainly all virtues been in him / And sithe that fortune
has brought me to his love / he is worthy to have my love / and yet more than
is in me / And have I not reason and cause then to love him / which has
done to me so great good and honor and doubtyng no peril of his person / and
is it not well great worship to my fader to have for vaissal and subget the
best knight that is in all the world For in all the world is no knight that
I would forsake paris fore / ne oone that has done so much for me / And thus
to speak of the feats of Paris she doude not stynte /

Then came two / damoyselles knockyng at the chamber door saying / Vyenne ye
must come to my lady / And ysabeau sprange out saying that she should come
anon / And vye^ne seeing that she must needs depart fro thens said to ysabeau
/ My suster sith we must depart hens late us take sum of these Iewellys /
and we shall keep them secretly till that Ptrys be comen and we shall see what
countenance he shall make in him self Then they took the colyer and the white
baner of vyenne and other Iewellys and hid them under their clothes / and
went in to the chamber of messyre Jacques / but vyenne desired gretely to speak
with pari^ and thought long or he came home / And in the mean while messire
Jacques recouerd of his maladye and bycam all hool whereof Vyenne had great Joy
but she durst not show it /

How Paris and Edward returned out of braband /
AFter certain time that Paris had be in Braband with his fellow Edward / he
desired strongely to see the fair vyenne / For the love of her destrayned him
much strongly / Nevertheless he durst not tell it to his fellow / to the end
that he should take no dysplaysyr of his departing / And sone after the space
of v days Paris received a letter that his fader was seek / and then he said
to Edward / Right dear brother and fellow / pleseth it you to wete that my
fader is sore seek / and me seems it were good that we departed if ye consent
but I pray you that ye take no desplayryr in this departing / for if it
playse god we shall sone return / And edward seeing the Just reason of Paris
and his good will / said to him that he was well content and plesyd / wherefore
Incontynente they departed out of braband and came in to the cite of vyenne /
of whose coming messyr Jacques had souerayn playsyr specially / by cause he had
herd that Paris his sone had done valyauntly feats of arms / Now it happed
that when Paris was arrived at home with his fader like as he was accustomed /
Allewaye tofore or he went to his ^edde / he went to make his orysons and
prayers / and after he aduysed if he lacked any thing / and fond that tho
things that he loved best were taken away / whereof he was much angry / and
quasi half in despayr in such wise that all the night he could not sleep And
when it came i^ the morning he came to his mother and said / Mother how is it
that ye have not kept my chamber cloos and shytte / For I lack certain
things which I would not gladly lose / and have for them great dysplaysir / To
whom his mother ansuerd / My sone by my faith there never entered therein person
/ but on a time when your fader was seek came my lady dyane and her daughter
vyenne / and when they had vysyted your fader / they went al about for to see
this castle / and then they entered in to your chamber / But I can not think
that they took any thing for they tarried not long / sauf only vyenne which
tarried only allone sauf her damoysel / by cause she was evil at ease at her
heart / wherefore my sone I pray you to take no dysplaysyr / And then Paris
said to him self / if none other thief have taken it sauf she I shall not be
dyscouerd / Nevertheless I wot never if Vyenne has taken it away for any
thing / And after he arrayed him self and cladde him much nobly / and went to
do the reverence to the daulphyn / and to dame Dyane / And after to Vyenne
their daughter / And the dolphyn received him much curtoysly / And the
daulphyn demanded him tidings and of many other things / And when the fair
lady Vyenne saw paris of the great desire that she had to see him / and of the
great love that she bare to him / all her ch^re was colored like a fresshe
rose in the monthe of May / and could not be content ne filled to behold her
fair love and friend Paris / And the more she byhelde him / the more grew and
encreaced her love toward him And Paris being tofore the dolphyn on his knee
much humbly durst not book on Vyenne / But in his heart he had great pain /
And who had well by holden him / had well seen in his vysage his thought / And
after that the dolphyn had demanded him of that it plased him Paris took leave
of the dolphyn and of my lady dyane and of vyenne their daughter and returned
home to his faders house /

AFter a few days Vyenne in such wise as love destrayned her said to her
damoysel ysabeau / my suster know ye for troth that me seems that paris is
much pensyf / and I believe that it is for his things which he fyndeth not in
his oratorye / me seems it is ^este that we let him have knowleche that we
have them / Isabeau ansuerd / it were well done so / but that it be done
honestly and secretly / Then said vyenne I shall advise the manner After
certain days vyenne said to her mother / Madame I let you wete that I am a
little charged in my conscience / and I would fayn confess me to sum good
person / And it is told me that the bishop of saint laurence is a much
honest man and devout / wherefore madame I pray you to send for him yt I
might speak with him / And my lady dyane seeing the good will of her daughter
sent for to fetch the bishop / And vyenne confessyd her to him much
deuoutely spekyng always of our lord and of his commandments / and after
that she was confessyd / she prayed ye bishop that he would come ageyn on the
morn / for she fond great comfort in his words / and that she would tell
him sum things in great secret / And on the morn the bishop came ageyn to
vyenne / and vye^ne said to him thus / My ghoostly fader sum things have
been taken away in a place / the which longen to paris sone of messyre Jacques
/ And the person that has them has thereof conscience / And therefore I pray
you as much as I may / that by your benygnyte ye say to him that if he may /
he come to morn hither wy^h you / and the bishop which aduysed him no thing
of thentencyon and thought of vye^ne said that he should bring him without
fault /

How vyenne dyscouuerd her courage to Paris
ON the morn the bishop came much dylygently and brought paris with him /
And vyenne salewed paris without to make any semblaunte of love / and paris
rendered his salewes ^ ageyn much humbly / And then Vyenne wythdrewe her fro
the bishop and the other / and said to paris It is not long sithe ye were
goon in to braband / and that I accompanied my lady my mother for to goo vysyte
your fader which then was seek / and we saw and byhelde all the castle until
we came to your oratorye and there I saw certain Iewellys which much well
pleased me and I took them and have kept them until this present time / And I
shall now render them to you ageyn / and therefore I pray you that if I have done
any dysplaysyr or maad any defaulte that ye will pardonne me / for I promise to
you by my faith that I have done it for none evil / To whom paris answered
humbly and with great reverence and said much curtoysly / Madame by your
curtosye ye came to vysyte my fader / of which vysytacyon not only my fader /
but all^e our friends have received great and souerayn honor / wherefore mine
excellent lady / my fader / my mother / and I been all youres / and all that
we have also / And if by adventure your ladyshyp had any playsyr to take of my
Iewellys / I ensure you by my faith / that mine heart has therein much gretter
playsyr tha^ heart of man may think and yet more should have if the said
Iewellys were better the half than they be / So then I pray you right
honorable damoysel that ye will pardo^ne me For not al only these Iewelles
which been of little valewe but my fader my mother and I been al youres / and al
ready to obey to your service / and know ye verayly that it is not long
sythen / that the said Jewels were by a frensshe knight given to me /

Then said Vyenne ye need not to say to me fro whens these Jewels ben comen /
For I know them as well as ye / And vyenne said / I merua^^le me gretely how ye
so long have hid your love fro me / I pray you as much as I may / and by
the faith that ye have toward me that ye say to me the truth of that which I
shall demand you / for much I desire it to know / Then said Paris right
honorable damoysel / ye ought not to pray me / where ye have power to
command me / For all that / your ladyshyp shall plese to demand me / I shall
say to you the troth with good heart and good will / Then said vyenne I will
first that ye say the truth / that if ye were he / that in such a year came
every night syngyng and sownyng Instruments so swetely tofore my chamber /
After I will that ye tell me if ye wa^ne the Iustes that were made the first
day of may in this cite / And if ye bare away the shield of crystal and the
chape^let which I have seen in your oratorye / After I will that ye say to me /
if ye wanne the Iustes the xviij day of septembre which were made in the cite
of paris / where as were so many noble knights and barons / and if ye had
gotten there the iij baners which I have seen in your oratorye / and I pray
you that ye tell to me / if ye have done to me such service / for such
things ye ought not to hyde / And if by adventure ye have done them for the
love of my fader or of his court / we be much holden to you and be bounden to
thank you / And if by adventure for any lady or for the love of me ye have
done it / I thank you as much as I may / and it is well reason that ye
therefore be rewarded / And yet said Vyenne to Paris / know ye for truth /
that it is long sithe that I have desired to know / and yet desire strongely
to know it / wherefore if ye will do me any playsyr / I pray you that ye say to
me the truth / without leuyng of any only thing or word /

Then said paris much humbly with great shamefastnes that he had to utter
the folly that he had enter prysed / Right honorable and fair lady I am not
worthy to be named him which has done this / which it has pleased you to
demand of me / but notwythstondyng that I be a man of little estate I humbly
supplye you that in caas ye shall find dysplaysyr in my words that it playse
you to pardonne me / and that ye take no dysplaysyr in that I shall say / for
your noblesse shall not be the less in valor / For my caas enforces me to say
that / which is to me folly to think / Then Paris al shamefast and in great
reverence knelyng upon his knee said / Right worshypful damoysel paris your
Indigne servant is he of whom ye have spoken and demanded / and shall to you
obey and serve in all things that ye have me demanded / For sithe that I have
had any rememberaunce / my will and my thought has be submysed to your
person and shall be as long as I shall live / Then said vyenne / Paris my
sweet friend it is not now time that I make ansuer to your words / for it
should be ouerlonge to recounte / But that not wythstondyng I will well that ye
know that your love destrayneth me so strongely / that there is no thing in
the world that I love so much as you / wherefore abide in good hope Ioyously /
for if it playse god ye shall s^e that th^s which I sa^ shall be true / Then
said paris / Madame who may think the Ioyouste in which I am by your ansuer
which is to me right sweet / For I never supposed to have had so sweet an
ansuer of you / but for to have endured in pain and in languysshyng / For not
only to me / but unto a king should be over much to have your love / and I
pray god that I may do such things as may be to you playsaunt / and that I
never live to do to you thing that should desplayse you / ne torn you to
melancolye / and thus departed that one fro that other in gretter love than
tofore / and took term to see each other ageyn as hastily as they might / and
vyenne returned more Ioyously than she showed / and went in to her moders
chamber / and after the bishop departed / and paris accompanied him unto his
paleys and took leave of him / and returned home unto his faders lodgyng / and
after told to edward his fellow / all the parliament that he had had with
vyenne / and Edward said to him / fair brother and friend / herein is no Iape
ne truffes / but I pray you that ye do your things secretly for there ben
many false tongues And Vyenne was much more Joyous than she had been accustomed
/ and Paris also / And the said Paris and edward his fellow made great
chyualryes and did great arms / which were much playsaunt to the fair
vyenne / Then it happed that after certain time seeing the dolphyn that his
daughter was come to xv year of age / treated for to give to her an husbond /
And many times he had been required of many noble princes but by cause he had
but her only and no moo sons ne daughters / uneath he would consent And in
treatyng thus of marriage Paris herd sum things whereof he was sore ennoyed
in him self / and thought / why think not I to have this noble lady which is
so much desired of so many noble princes and barons / and sore bewaylled him
self / and did so much that he spoke to vyenne and said / O sweet Vyenne /
where is your fair and agreeable promise that ye made to me when I departed fro
you / and how may it be / that your fader speaks for to marye you /

When vyenne herd Paris speak in this manner / she said to him paris if my
fader speak to me of marriage / it is no great meruaylle / for I may not
deffende him / Nevertheless I have not consented to any marriage / And ye know
well that marriage is nothing worth / without the consentyng of both parties /
wherefore I pray you to be content / for I promise to you that I shall never
have man in marriage but you / and I would that it should be shortly accomplysshed
if it pleased god / honestly and Justly and not in sin ne in ordure /
Therefore I will that ye assaye one thing / which shall be much dyffycyle to do
and right peryllous / but nevertheless it byho^eth that it be done / then said
Paris / honorable lady / that which shall playse you to command me / I shall
accomplisshe it with good heart though I should deye / and thanne said Vyenne / I
will that Incontinent ye say to your fader / that he goo to my lord my fader /
and require him that he give me in marriage to you / and that herein there be no
deffaute / and when Paris herd the will and desire of vyenne / he was quasi
al abashed and said / Right honorable lady and how / will ye that I deye thus
/ I pray you if it playse you / that it be not do / Then vye^ne said set
ye so little by me / that ye will not enterprise this / Alas where is your
entendement / Certes it must needs be done / Incontinent Paris ansuerd /
worshypfull lady / sithe it playseth you / I shall accomplysshe your
commandment though I should deye therefore an hundred thousand times and thus
took leave of vyenne and went to his fader Incontinent and said to him / Dear
fader always ye have showed to me great love / wherefore I byseche al myty god
that he reward you like as I desire / Dear and honorable fader I would pray
you of one thing / and by cause it is doubtous I will that ye promise it to me
tofore I say it to you / for else I will not say it unto you / and his fader
said to him / My sone there is nothing in the world that I may do for the /
but I shall accomplysshe it by the grace of god / therefore say to me thy playsyr
and will / and then paris told to his fader a part of the pryuete and
promise that he had with vyenne / by cause he should with the letter will do
that / which he would require him / Then said paris to his fader / the prayer
that I pray and require you is / that it playse you to say to the dolphyn /
that he give to me his daughter to wife and in marriage / And I humbly byseche
you that herein ye will not faylle me / and messire Jacques heryng his sone thus
speak / almoost he was fro him self for the great folly yt he said to him / and
he said in repreuyng him that he never should speak more of that fayte / for he
would not deye for his daughter / and that he should demand of him sum other
thing / for it were great folly to speak to him of such a thing / And paris
said worshypful fader / as much peryllous is it to me as to you / therefore I am
not abashed thugh ye reffused to do it / But love enforces and constreyneth
me so strongely / that I am half confused / and am as well content that he do
it not / as to do it / but that ye do your deuoyr only / and so long paris
prayed his fader / that be promised him to do it /

How messire Jacques demanded of the doulphyn his daughter vyenne in marriage
for his sone Paris /
Then went messire Jacques to the dolphyn all changed of color and said to
him / My right redoubted and souerayn lord a certain request is made to me /
which I must say unto you / the which me seems is of passing little reason /
and therefore it must be at your mercy / and in caas ye find therein dysplaysyr
/ that ye pardonne me / and to take no regard to my great folly / The
doulphyn trustyng in the great wysedom of messire Jacques granted him to say
what someuer he would / Then said messire Jacques / Mine hye and souerayn lord /
Paris my sone has prayed me so much that I should require of you vyenne your
daughter to be his wife / the which thing is not only to say / but also to
think great presumpsyon and great folly / but the love of my sone constrayneth
me so strongely / that by force I must say it to you / And suddenly the
doulphyn was moeued in great felonnye / and would not suffer him to end his
words / but repreued him much hardly saying / vylayne and vassal that thou
art / how kepest thou my worship / by god I shall well chastyse you / that ye
shall never think such things / and commanded him that Incontinent he should
depart thens / and that never been his sone should come in his sight / wherefore
messire Jacques departed thens much rebuked holdyng down his heed / and
returned in to his house / and told to his sone Paris all that had be said and
done between him and the Doulphyn / whereof Paris thanked much his fader /

THe doulphyn went in great thout through the paleys having great Indygnacyon
and all angry in so much that none durst speak to him ne come in his way /
and he being thus in this manner he sent for his daughter vye^ne and made her
to come to him / and said to her / we have had words of great dysplaysyr /
This vyllayne messyre Jacques has said to us that we should give you to wife and
in marriage to his sone Paris / Advise you what wysedom it were / by god or that
I should do it / I would rather make you a nonne or a menchon / and it shall not
be long to / but that ye shall be hyely married / so that ye shall hold you
conde^^e / and here I swear to you that if it were not for the great seruyces
that he has done to me Incontinent I should do smite of his head / and when
vyenne saw her fader in so great anger against messyre Jacques and his sone /
she sent for to seche Edward for to come speak to her / and when Edward was
come Vyenne said to him / Edward it is so that my fader is much angry against
messire Jacques and against paris whereof I have great dysplaysyr and have great
doubt that my fader will do sum harm to Paris / and therefore I will that ye
say to him / that he keep him self in the most secretest wise that he may /
and I shall also see the manner if I may appease his felonnye and anger / Then
edward Incontinent took leave of vyenne / and went and said to paris all that
vyenne had said to him and said fair brother / me seems that it were good that
ye departed out of this country for to absente you for a space of time For it
may be that to the doulphyn shall long endure his anger / as I understand by
that which vyenne has said to me / Then ansuerd Paris / sithe that ye have
counceylled me so I shall so do / not wythstondyng that it shall be to me a
sorouful and an heavy departing / but er I depart I shall take leave of Vyenne
though I should deye /

Then Paris did so much that he spoke unto vyenne on a derke night at a
low wyndowe / where as they might well say what they would / I am certain said
vyenne that my fader has will to hurt you / whereof I live in great
melancolye / For in all the world is no thing that I love so much as you / and
if by adventure ye deye I will not live / Then said paris / h^nourable lady it
seems me best that I depart fro hens a certain time till my lord your fader
be more peased and has passed his evil will / how be it / that it shall be to
me a much sorouful thing to wythdrawe me fro you / For my life shall be much
heavy / Nevertheless I shall ac^omplysshe your will in all that ye shall
command me / what someuer come thereof / And vye^ne seeing the good will of
paris after many words she said to him / Paris my friend I know well the
great love that ye bear to me / and sithe it so is / I swear to you by my faith
/ that ye shall never depart fro this cite without that I goo with you / For
it is my will / wherefore as soon as ye may / make you ready of al things
necessary / and / find ye the manner that we may escape out of the royame of
france / and that we may goo in to sum other lordshyppe / where as we may
live Ioyously and surely Nevertheless tofore or we depart from hens I will that
^e promise two things / The first is / that ye touch not my body unto the
time that we be lawfully married / The second is that ysabeau part in all the
goods that we shall have / and other thing will I not as for this present time
/ but that only our departing may be shortly / and I shall pourueye sum
Jewels and money for our necessyte / and al this Paris promised to her / and
each departed fro other for tadresse such things as to them should be
necessary /

When Paris was departed fro vyenne he went to a man named george and said to
him / George my friend always I have trusted in you / and have always loved you
/ wherefore I pray you now that to this that I shall say you ye faylle me not /
for I promise you ye shall not lose thereby / and George promised to him to do
all that shall be to him possible with ryght^ good heart / and then Paris said
to him / know ye for cartayn that I have wrath and rancour to a man of this
to^^ne for certain desplaysyr that he has done to me / wherefore I will slay him
/ and Incontinent as I have slain him / I will depart out of the royame of
France / wherefore I pray you yt ye will goo to Aygues mortes / and that ye
there make ready a galeye furnysshed of al things necessary till that we be
arrived there as we would be / And also I pray you that ye do ordeyne fro hens
to aygues mortes fro v mile to v mile always good horses ready to the end that we
may surely refresshe us if it be need / and also I will that ye do this as
secretly as ye may / and loo here is money enough for to furnysshe these said
things / George said / I shall do al this gladly / And Incontinent made him
ready / and when he came to aygues mortes he hired a galeye / and establisshed
all the passages / and did well all that paris had charged him / and came ageyn /
and told to paris how he had pourueyed all that he had charged him / whereof
paris was much Joyous / and anon paris went and told to Vyenne that all
things that she had commanded were done And then they concluded that the
next night following that at a certain hour each of them should be ready /
then he took leave of her and went home / and bad George to take two horse out
of his stable / and that he should sadle them and abide him without the cite in
a certain place till he should come / and Edward the fellow of Paris wyste no
thing of all this / whereof he was much abusshed and meruayllously angry when
that he knew it /

How paris ladde away vyenne and ysabeau by night /
When Paris was pourueyed of money and of al other things being to them
necessary / he went allone the secretest wise yt he myt and came to the place
emprysed at the hour taken / and he made a tokene which vyenne knew And
anon vyenne and ysabeau cladde them in man's array and ^epen out of ye
castle by a fauce port / and so came these two damoyselles to the place where
as paris was allone / which awayted upon their coming / and Incontinent they
departed and went where as their horses were whom they took and rode as fast
as they might / and george rode always tofore by cause to know well the way /
and whiles they thus rode / aroos a storm with a great rain which endured
till on the morn at night / and then they arrived nygh unto a little town /
but they entr^d not by cause they would not be known / and went and lodged
them in a little church nygh unto the town / where they fond a chapelayn
which received them gladly the best wise he might / and then when the night
came Paris and the chapelayn slepte in a little house Ioynyng to the church /
George and paris servant slepten in the stable with the bestes / And vyenne
and ysabeau slepten in the church / and in the morning erly they went lightly
to horsback / and rode till they came nyghe unto a river / which was risen hye
by cause of the rain that had fallen / Then paris was much angry by cause
he saw well that it was much peryllous / and said to George / that he should
search and advise sum good place where they might pass over / and george
wythdrewe him a little from them / and chaas a place which thought him good /
and took the river with his horse / And when he was in the mids of the streme
his horse faylled him that he was drowned and his horse also / Paris seeing that
george was drowned was much sore abashed / and durst make no semblaunte / by
cause that fair vyenne should have no me lancolye / And after Vyenne demanded
of Paris where george was bycomen / and paris answered to her / that he had sent
him for to search sum good passage / and they would torn in to the church
ageyn till George were comen / And vyenne ansuerd to him that it playsed to her
well so to do / For she had great doubt and fere for to pass the water / And
when they were in the church / Paris was much aferde to abide long in that
place / for he saw that it was / not sure / wherefore he demanded the
chapelayn / if they might in any wise pass that water / And the chapelayn said
not in three days till the water were decre^ed and aualed / And paris said to
him that he should goo in to the town to seche and see if he might find any
men that would make a bridge so that they myt pass And that he should spare for
no money / For I shall pay to them as much as they will have / and the
chapelayn said that he should do his best / Thus did Paris no thing but
think how they might pass the river / Now leave we Paris and torn we to the
doulphyn / which had lost his fair daughter vyenne /

How the doulpyn did do search and seche vyenne by his servants /
ON the morn that vye^ne was lost and departed fro the house of her fader /
and that the doulphyn knew it / he supposed to have goon out of his wit /
and all the court was troubled / and sent hastily men on horsback and a foot
by diverse parties the most secretly that he might / and prayed them that they
should bring home to him vyenne quyck or deed / It happed by adventure that one
of his men a foot that was sent to seche Vyenne came in to the town where as
the chapelayn was comen to seche men to make the bridge / The foteman demanded
every man if they had seen two damoyselles which were fled fro the doulphyns
court / Then the chapelayn said to him that it was not long sith such
tweyne departed with other men And the man supposed that the said chapelayn had
said it in Iape or in mockyng / And said that the Doulphyn was much angry /
and had sworn that if any man or woman knew where they were and showed it not
/ that he should make them to lose their hedes / And when the chapelayn herd
these words he remembered him of them that were hyd in his house / And in great
dread said to him / that he should tarry there a little / and that for the love
of my lord doulphyn he would gladly seche for them / and as soon as he might
find tidings of them he should let him wit / And so departed fro thens / and
returned home ageyn / and told al this to paris / and what he had herd in the
town / saying also that he doubted that it was for them of his company /
wherefore he said to him ferthermore / sir I pray you that ye depart from hens
/ and suffer not that I lose my life / but take ye the best counceyl ye can /
For there ben fyfty men on horsback that seche you / when Paris herd him say
this it needs not to demand if he were heavy and melancolyous / and for the
great sorrow that he had he changed al his color / And he said to the
chapelayn / I pray you that ye tarry a little and I shall make you an ansuer /
and then Paris went to vyenne / for to tell to her al this feat / And when
vyenne saw him enter / and so changed in his color said to paris / what
tidings bring ye which are so pale and your color changed / I pray you as
hertely as I can that it playse you to tell me / Then Paris said to her The
tidings that I bring ben evil for you and for me / For shortly shall be
accomplisshed our adventure / and therefore ^ I will slay my self / and also he
said complaynyng / O god how my life is sorrowful and heavy to have brought this
excellent lady as ye ar in such danger / O good god why gaf thou not to me
the death tofore or that I fette her out of her faders house / O alas my fader
and my mother what shall be fall of you / when the doulphyn shall know / that I
have stolen from him his daughter / O my good fellow Edward why counceylled not
I with the tofore or I had done this folly And after he returned to vye^ne
saying / and what shall fall of you my lady / when your fader shall see you /
Certes I think that how cruel that he be / when he shall see your noble person
/ his heart shall not suffer to do you any harm / O god almighty do to me that
grace yt I only may bear the pain of this fayt and none other / O lady unhappy
was that day for you and for me when first ye had acquaintance of me / And
when Paris had fynysshed his complaynte / he told to Vyenne all that the
chapelayn had said to him / And forthwyth as a person despayred / took his
sword and would have ryuen it through his body / And Vyenne as virtuous and
valyaunte took to her heart / and took the sword fro him and comforted him and
said / O free knight / my Joy / my life / and my solace / what will ye do /
know ye not well / that who that sleeth him self wytyngly / sleeth the soul
and the body / and if ye deye / I assure you I shall deye also / and so shall ye
be cause of my death as well as of your own O Paris where is your wysedom and
your prowess / Now when ye should have most strength and most virtuous
courage ye be aferde / O my knight this is no new thing that the persons
that lyuen in this world have trybulacyons / of what someuer lygnage they be /
Certes this is not the courage of one so valyaunte knight as ye be / For now
whom that ye ought to comfort / she must now comfort you / And therefore my
fair brother and friend I pray you as much as ye may / that Incontynente ye
depart fro hens / and that ye goo your way / and if ye do not so I shall slay
my self with your sword / For your departing is as greuons to me / as mine shall
be to you / but it by houeth to eschew of two euyls the werse / And also ye
ought to consydere one thing / that not wythstondyng the great fault and
trespaas that I have made to my fader / yet therefore he shall not put me to death
/ considered the great love that he has a^way had toward me / and if ye were
taken / I wot well that ye and I should both deye / And yet I have good hope /
that mine entencyon shall come unto a good end / For be ye sure though he never
pardonne me / I shall never have other husbond but you and that I promise you by
my faith / But all way of one thing I pray you / that for none other lady ye
forgete not me / And when ye shall be in another contreye write unto me of your
adventure / And to the end that ye the better remember me loo here is a ring of
gold with a dyamonde / the which I pray you that ye will keep for the love of me

How Paris departed from Vyenne / and left her in the church /
AFter much other langage paris kyssed vye^ne with great syghes and thoughts
/ and she comforted him the best wise she might / in prayeng our lord Ihesu
Christ that in short time she might see him / like as her heart desired most
of any thing that was in the world / And then Paris departed fro Vyenne with
great sorrow and heaviness / And took his way with his servant till he came
to the river wh^re they could not tofore have passed / and as despayred doubted
no thing but entered the^m / and the water was so aualed that they passed
without any peril / And they rode two days without any mete / for they durst
not pass through any town / And they passed till they came to aygues mortes /
And there he found the galeye that george had hired / which anon he took /
and so long saylled and rowed till that they arrived at Gene / Paris made
meruayllous countenaunces in the galeye / that all they that were therein / had
supposed he had be a fool / for allewaye he was pe^syf / and ymagynatyf / and
uneath would speak ne say a word / Then when he was at gene he hired him a
lodgyng and lived there in great heaviness and sorrow / Now leave we to speak of
Paris and return we to vyenne which abode in the chapelayns house

How vyenne was found in the church by a foteman / and how she was brought
ageyn to her fader /
When Paris was departed fro vyenne she abode allone with ysabeau making the
grettest sorrow of the world that it was a great pity to byholde / like as she
had as leef to deye as to live / And when she was well weary of weeping / and that
it was force that she must return to the mercy of her fader the doulphyn / she
appeased her self / And anon the chapelayn went for to seche the foteman and
brought him in to the ^hyrche / And when Vyenne saw him / she knew him well /
For she had oftymes seen him in her faders hows / And this man said to her all
his charge / and that many knights were out for to seche her / And Vyenne
said to him goo and tell them that thou have founden me here / and bring them
hither / Then the man went and fond the knights that then were comen in
to the town / and told to them how he had fou^den her / and that they should
come with him and he would bring them to the place where she was / when ye
knytes herd these tidings anon each made great haste till they came to her /
then wha^ they were tofore vyenne they salewed her and said to her that the
doulphyn had do seche her in diverse contreyes / and after they comforted her /
and said that she should not be aferde of her fader / for he would do to her no
desplaysyr / for be shall have so great Joy / when he shall see you / that he
shall pardonne you and appease his ire /

And than Incontinent they went to horsbacke / and brought forth the chapelayn
with her to the end that he should excuse her tofore her fader / and told how
she was pure and clean of her body /

NOw says ^hystory that when Vyenne was comen tofore her fader the doulphyn /
he made toward her heavy and evil ^here / But not wythstondyng Vyenne kneled
down on both her knees to the earth saying and in weeping / Redoubted fader I
see well and know in my self that I have mesprysed and faylled toward you /
whereof I have great desplaysyr / Nevertheless folysshe love has enforced me to
love him / which is well worthy to be byloued of the most grettest lady of the
Royame of france allewaye seen the noblenes that is in him / For I wene that
in all the world is none to him like ne pareylle / And also I think that I am
not the first that have trespaced by semblable reasons / wherefore redoubted
fader I am in your mercy / and take of me vengeance / such as shall playse you
/ and to me chastysement / and example to other Neuerth^les I will well that ye
know and that I ^swere by my soul / that I am as pure and clean of my body as
I was* that day that I departed fro hens / And loo here is the chapelayn which
can say to you the truth / And then the chapelayn told how she came with
in men of whom that one was a much fair knight young and curtoys the which I
believe is drowned in passing a river / And they were in mine house / and the two
damoyselles slept to gyder in the church / and the knight slepte with me / And
the other two slepte in the stable with the horses / Then when the doulphyn
herd these tidings he had ryt great playsyr / of which he made no semblaunte
/ and gaf to the chapelayn much money and g^^te yeftes / and bad him return /
After the doulphyn took vyenne by the hand / in repreuyng her much gretely /
and lad her in to her moders chamber with ysabeau / for her mother was seek of
the great sorrow that she had for her daughter / and there the mother blamed
them both two / And ysabeau said that vyenne was as pure and clean of her body
as she was the day that she departed / Alas said the doulphyn / thou have put
us in the most grettest shame of ye world And I promise that all they that
have consented thereto shall be well punysshed / and in especyal that evil traytre
Paris which is cause of al this fayte and if ever I may have him I shall make
dogs devour him and also both ye tweyne shall suffer therefore great
penytence / Then said vyenne weeping / I see well and know that ye have
enten^ion to do to me much gryef and harm / and I see well that my life shall not
long endure / Therefore I swear to you in good faith / that there is no man in
the world that I so much love as I do him whom ye so menace and thretene /
For in him I have my thought and courage without ever to faylle him / and if
ye shortly give to me my penance / so much shortly shall be my death / And if
ye suffer me to endure it long / so much more shall I bear it / and my soul
shall be the more sure to fore almighty god / and know ye for certain that for
him and his love I am ready to deye / Then the doulphyn issued out of the
chamber in great Indygnacyon / and commanded that the fader of Paris should be
put in an evil prison / And that al his goods should be taken fro him / And
also that vyenne and ysabeau should be enclosed in a chamber / and that well
little mete should be given to them / and much he menaced and thretened them /
and thus they abode a long time in that chamber / and contynuelly Vyenne
dremed of Paris /

And when she might have any space to speak to Edward fellow of Paris / she
required him that he should search if he might have any tidings of paris / and
that he should let her know thereof / In this manner vyenne passed her time in
great sorrow and in great thought all way desyryng for to here sum tidings
of that noble knight Paris /

When Vyenne had been a great time in this manner / The doulphyn bythought him
that then his daughter Vyenne had been well chastysed /

And thennne the Doulphyn fader of Vyenne ordained that she came out of prison
/ And then he purposed to give to her an husbond / and set her in her first
estate / whereof all the court was much Joyous / and in especyal Edward
fellow of Paris / And after certain time the doulphyn wrote to the Earl of
Flaunders that he would do marye his daughter vye^ne whereupon he required him
that he would give to him counceyll in this matter / For it was unto him
chargeable / And during the time that vyenne was out of prison her heart was
never in rest / but ever she was heavy and sorouful for her sweet and faithful
friend paris / whom she might not see / and knew not whether he were deed or
a live / And when the doulphyn saw her so heavy / On a day he said to her / My
sweet daughter / wherefore be ye so sorouful / give your self to playfyr / For
as to me I remember no more the things passed / And there is no thing in the
world that ye demand me but I shall do it for you / And then vye^ne which
had not forgeten Paris said to him / Honorable fader if I were sure of the
things passed that they were forgoten by you / I should be more sure than I am
/ but I believe fermely / that ye have them yet in your remembrance / For ye
hold always messyre Jacques in prison the fader of Paris / which is not
culpable of any part of this deed ne cause / And if ye would do to me so much
grace that ye would pardonne him and render to him al his goods and things I
should be much Joyous / And the doulphyn for the playsyr of his daughter said
to her / that it well playsed to him / and Incontynt the doulphyn did do deliver
messyre Jacques out of prison / and did do return to him al his goods and
things that had be taken from him / whereof messyre Jacques had great playsyr /
for if he had abyden leng^r in prison he had be deed for hungre / for there was
none that comforted him but edward / which comforted him the best wise he
might / and gaf to him daily that which was necessary for his life / when
vyenne knew that messyre Jacques was out of prison / she was much Ioyeful and
had great playsyr / Nevertheless all the consolacyon of vyenne was when she might
speak with edward of her love Paris / And thus she passed her time in right
great pain and heaviness the best wise she might /

When the Earl of flaunders had read the letters of the doulphyn and
understood that he would marye his daughter vye^ne which was of the age of xv
year / he trayted that she should have of two barons that one / that is to wete
the sone of the king of england / or the sone of the duke of bourgoyne / which
then had great renomme^ in france / and that was for the great prowess that
was in him / and the said earl made this said traytye / and sent word unto the
doulphyn / that him seemed best that the sone of the du^ of bourgoyn were best
for ^yr / by cause that it should be great playsyr to the King of france / and
that he was a noble knight and of great prowess / and when the doulphyn had
received these letters fro therle of Flaunders / he sent to the king of
france to wit of him which should best playse him of these two princes
aforesaid that should have his daughter For whom that he would should have her /
whereof ye king had great playsyr / and reputed it to him great honor / And he
sent to him word / that it should playse him best that he married with the sone
of the duc of bourgoyn his neuew / and in so doing he should do to him right
great playsyr / and would do as much for him when time and place requires /
And seeing the doulphyn the will of the king of france sent word to therle
of flaunders / that he had counseylled with his barons / and also that it was
the will of the king of france that his daughter should be married to the sone
of the duc of bourgoyne / And then therle labored so much in this matter
that he made the said sone of the duc to agree as for his party /

How Paris sent a letter to his fellow Edward /
NOw late us leave to speak of this matter / and return we unto Paris which
abode in the cite of gene much heavy / and whiles this marriage was in trayty
Paris dwelled in gene out of al Joys and pl^ysaunses worldly / and al for the
love that he had to the fair vyenne whom he had so much at his heart / And
abode always in his lodgyng allone / and bycame so devout and so humble
toward god / that it was great meruaylle / and also for the good countenaunces
that he made / he was much well byloued of all the people of the cite and they
held him for a noble man / and said he must needs be the sone of a great lord
/ And Paris being in this manner had great desire to have tidings of vyenne /
and what was her adventure / And anon ^^dry ^ed two letters / that one to his
fader / and that other to his felawe Edward / Of which the letter to his fader
said in this manner /

Right dear and honorable sir and fader playse it you to wete that I am much
sorouful and heavy of my cruel adventure / and also I endure great heaviness /
sorrow and afflyctyon / doubtyng that for me ye have suffered great pain and
trybulacyon / and I late you wete that I am at genes / and dwell in a lodgyng
allone deposed fro al Joys and consolacyons mondayne / For mine entendement is
to serve god and our lady fro hens forth / and purpose that ye shall see me
no more / for I will depart and goo through the world to seche holy pylgrymages /
And if by adventure I shall deye tofore that ye shall see me / I pray you that
it may playse you that I deye not in your evil will / but humby by seche you
that it playse you to pardonne me / and to give to me your benedyctyon / Also
dear sir and fader I pray you and supplye that my dear brother and fellow
Edward ye will take in my name and place / and that he be recommaunded as your
sone instead of me / as well in your heritage as in other things / and the
grace of the holy ghoost be with you / Recomaunde me to my mother and c^ / And
the letter of Edward said thus /

Dear and specyal brother and synguler friend edward the peril of pa^ris and of
his adventure is poursyewed of all evil and cruel fortune / I comaunde me to
you as much as I may say or thynk Nevertheless like as we have been accustomed
to write letters of love and of chyualrye / Now I must write letters
anguysshous of sorrow and of evil fortune / for alas I am unhappy al allone in
a strange contre / and exyled fro al Joys and fro all playsyr / and out of al
worldly playsaunce thynkyng night and day on the bele vyenne / the which I
think that for me has suffered mortal sorrow / and I say to you that if I
knew that for me she suffered pain and sorrow I should be in despayr / for I am
worthy for to be punysshed cruelly for that fayte and none other wherefore I
pray god and all his saints that she may be kept from al evil / and give
her grace to prospere in all good and honor like as she is worthy and mine heart
desires / My dear brother and fellow the most dear things that I love in this
world is first the fair and sweet vyenne / and next you to whom I pray you if
it may be in any wise that ye will say to her in my name / how that I am living
in genes / Passing my life much heavy and sorouful for thabsence of her noble
person / and for the cruel and evil fortune that has poursyewed me / and also
say ye to her that I cry her mercy / and that it may playse her to pardonne me
/ if by me she have any dysplaysyr and god knows mine entency on / and in what
trybulacio^ I live And sith that it has not play sed to our lord / that we
accomplysshe not our desire and will / we ought to bear it pacyently / And
also ye shall say to her / that I pray and supplye her as much as I may that
she yet take no husbond / unto the time that she shall see the end of our
adventure / and after this I pray you dear brother of the consolacyon of my
fader and my mother / and that ye be to them as a sone / For seeing the love that
always we have had to gyder / I have wryton to my fader / that in the stead of
me he take you for his sone / and that after his life / he will leave to you his
heritage / for so much brother and fellow I pray and bysoche you that ye be to
them humble and obeyssaunt / and the better part shall be youres / and if by
adventure ye write to me any letter late the letter be kept in my faders house
/ ye holy ghoost have you in his keeping / And he delyuerd this letter to a
courrour which within few days was at vyenne / and secretly delyuerd his
letters to edward the good knight / when Edward had received these letters and
knew that paris was a live / he had right as great Joy as any man could
think or believe / Nevertheless he held ye courrour secretly in his house to
the end that the dolphyn should not know thereof / and when he had herd the
letters / he went to the house of messyre Jacques the fader of the noble paris
and said to him / Messyre Jacques I bring to you this letter / And when messyre
Jacques had read the letter / (...) could not be sacyat of redyng / he took so
great playsyr therein / After that he had read it at his playsyr / he prayed
Edward to write to him an ansuer well at large of all that was byfallen sith
his departing / and this done edward departed fro him / and went unto beale
vyenne / whom he fond much heavy and sorouful for her love and friend paris /
and Edward said / honorable lady / and how is it / that ye be thus heavy / and
vyenne said to him / alas fair brother Edward / I have good reason and cause to
be heavy For mine heart abides thynkyng day and night on my good knight Paris /
and I know not whether he be alive or deed / of which thing I much desire
to know / For if he be deed I am cause thereof / And certes if he be deed I may
not live after him / if our lord would do so much grace that he be a live /
fayn would I know in what land he is / to the end that I myt send to him a
little money / so that he have no necessyte for his person / And edward said
to her / Madame what will ye give me / if I tell te you good tidings and sure
of him / Then said Vyenne / by my faith there is no thing that I have in
this world / which I may give with mine honor / but that I shall give it to you
Then said Edward / loo here is a letter which he has sent to me / and when
vyenne saw the letter she opened it and read it al allonge / and when she had
read it she had so great Joy / that her seemed god had appyered to her / and
the Joy that she had in her heart showed well in her vysage / For sithe that she
departed fro paris she had not so good vysage ne chere as she had then and
when the solace had enough endured Edward said to her Madame give to me ageyn
my letter / that I may make to him an ansuer / And Vyenne said it pleseth me
much that ye make to Paris my sweet friend an ansuer / but surely the letter
shall remain with me / Then he said / Madame have ye not promised to give to
me that thing that I shall demand you / yes said she / Then edward said I
desire ne will have none other thing / but that ye give to me my letter / for
as soon shall I give to you my life / but and if ye will demand any other thing
/ I will well / Then said Edward I am content that the letter abide with you /
and after he ordained another letter to Paris which said in this manner /

How Edward^ sent ansuer of his letter to Paris / which abode in the cite of
genes /
Right dear brother friend and fellow paris / your fader and your mother great
you well / the which have suffered for you much disease / pain and desplaysyr
/ and in especyal your fader which has long been in prison / and all his
goods were taken fro him / and also I certefye you that by the grace of god
and at the request and prayer of Vyenne / the doulphyn has pardonned him all
his evil will / and delyuerd him out of prison and restored to him all his
goods ageyn / And plese it you to wete fair brother that vyenne has had so
much Joy and so great playsyr when she had knowleche that ye were a live /
that it is wonder to believe / For all her consolacyon was for to have tidings
of you / and she recommaundeth her to you as much as she may / and has much
great desire to see you and also prays you not to wythdrawe you fro her ne
fro that contreye / ^ut that ye write often to her of your estate / And she
sends to you an eschaunge of three thousand floryns / of which she will that
ye take your playsyr and Joy / for all her hope is in you / Also ye shall
understand that she has be kept in prison a certain time / but thanked be
god she is now out / Also I have showed to her your letter / which she
reteyneth / and after that she had read it / I might never have it ageyn / but
she said / that she had lever to lose all that she had / than the said letter
and ye shall know that the doulphyn treats a marriage for her the which is the
sone of the duc of bourgoyn / and he hops fro day to day / that it shall be
accomplysshed / Nevertheless I trust so much in vyenne / seeing yt which she
has said to me / that she will never have other husbond but you / wherefore live
ye forth Ioyously in hope / Dear brother I thank you as I can or may for the
presentacyon that ye have done for me / your soul be with god / to whom I
pray that he keep you in his holy ward and protectyon etc^ / when this letter
was written he delyuerd it to the courrour / which made hasty Iourneyes so that
he arrived at genes / where as the good knyt Paris dwelled and abode /

When the noble paris had read the letter / and knew that vyenne had been in
prison / almoost for sorrow he was out of his wit cursyng his evil fortune /
and after he cursed the day that he was borne and much dyscomforted him self /
and also he cursed the doulphyn saying / O cruel fader and uncunning / how may
your heart suffer to put in prison her that is so noble a creature / which is
full of al virtues / that is the fair vyenne / which is no thing cause of
this fayte / For I my self only have done it / and ought to bear allone the
penance / alas and wherefore did not god to me so much grace / that I had be
taken instead of her / O fair vyenne what have I do for you / which have
suffered so much pain for me / Thus he made a great while his sorrow in
weeping strongely / After Paris saw that the fair vyenne was returned in to her
first estate / whereof he was much Joyous / and when he had received the
eschaunge that vyenne had sent him he hired a much fair house and cladde him
honestly and rychely and took acquaintance and amytye with the grettest and
best of the cite / in so much they did him much good and honor / and thus
duellyd paris a great while / always remembryng in his heart the love of vyenne /
for alleway his love encreaced / And every month they wrote letters each to
other / of which here is made no mencyon / for it should be over long to
reherce / and torn we here in to flaunders for the fayte of the marriage of the
excellent vyenne /

NOw says thystorye that when therle of Flaunders had accorded the marriage
with the duc of bourgoyn he made ready his sone and apparaylled him of company
and of horses / and let it be known to the doulphyn / that he should make ready
al thing necessary / and that he should hastily send to him his sone / when
the doulphyn herd these tidings / that he / whom he so much desired should
come he was much Joyous / and Incontinent did do make ready many great and
meruayllous festes / and during the same did do make ready his sone the duc of
bourgoyne / horses and people for to accompanye him which was a fair thing to
see / And after sent him to therle of flanders / which received him with
great Joy and with great honor and fested him two days / and delyuerd to him
his sone in his company / and sent him to the doulphyn / and when the
doulphyn knew their coming / he did do make ready to receive him / and when
they were by a day Iourneye nygh unto vyenne / he rode out with much great
chyualrye / and received them with much great Joy and playsyr / and each made
great feste to other which were over long to recounte / Nevertheless tofore
that the doulphyn came to the sone of she duc of bourgoyn / he and his wife
entered in to the chamber of vyenne to whom the doulphyn said / Fair daughter
it was the play sir of god that I and your mother were to gyder vij year
without having any child / and in the viij year our lord comforted us with
you / in whom we have al our affectyon / For we have neither sone ne daughter
but only you / ne suppose never to have / so we trust that by you we have one
/ It is true ^hot so as god will and has ordained we will assemble you to a
much honouble marriage / the which to us playseth much / for I ensure you the
daughter of the King of France has much desired to have him / that ye shall
have / for god has endowed him with so much good and honor as heart of knight
may have / thus to the playsyr of god / and of the vyrgyn marye / we have made
the marriage of the sone of the duke of bourgoyne and of you / wherefore we pray
you / that thereto ye will give your good will and playsyr / and also that ye
will have the marriage agreeable / Then vyenne ansuerd to her fader / Honorable
fader and lord I wot well that this that ye entende is for my well and prouffyt
/ But not wythstondyng that I be in age for to marye / and that in this marriage
I should receive honor more than I am worthy / Nevertheless I shall not yet be
married for if we have not this man / if it playse god we shall have another as
good or better / And think ye not mine honorable lord / that I say this for
any excusacyon / but it is sythen xv days that I have be evil dysposed of my
person / and the maladye that I have causes me to take no playsyr for to be
married / For I have auowed unto god never to be married to this man ne to none
other / as long as I shall be in this maladye / Then thought the dolphyn that
vyenne said it for shamefastnes / Nevertheless he trauaylled her every day with
fair words that she should consent to this marriage / but it auaylled nothing
all that he did / for the will of her was more in paris than in any man of the
world /

Then on the morn the sone of the duc of bourgoyne / and the sone of the
earl of Flaunders entered in to the cite of vyenne / whereof the doulphyn had
great Joy and playsyr / and this feste endured well fyftene days / that they
did no thing / but dance / sing / and did other diverse playsyrs / and during
this feste the doulphyn said to the sone of the duke of bourgoyn to the end that
he should think none evil by cause he abode so long or he might espouse his
daughter / Fair sone I pray you and byseche that ye take you to playsyr and
Joy / And gryeue you no thing of this long abydyng here / for certain my
daughter is so seek / that uneath she may speak / which does to her great
desplaysyr and shame / for fayn she would be out of her chamber / And then the
sone of the duc of bourgoyn as he shat mente but good faith / byleued it
lightly / Nevertheless the doulphyn did nothing nyt ne day / but admonested his
daughter one time in fair words / and another time in menaces / but in no wise
he could make his daughter to consent / And commanded that she should nothing
have but bread and water and vyenne abode one day so in this manner / and al
this did the doulphyn / to the end that she should consent to the marriage / and
always he did to her more harm and pain / and vyenne was always more hard /
and ferther fro his desire / whereof the doulphyn had much great dysplaysyr /
and not without cause / and seeing the Doulphyn that his daughter was so
Indurate / he thought that by sum good moyen he would send home ageyn the
sone of the duc of bourgoyn for he doubted that if he abode long / that this
feat might be dyscouerd / and he gaf to him fair Iewellys / and after said to
him / Fair sone I will that ye take no desplaysyr in that I shall say to you /
Me seems well that at this time this marriage may not goo forth of you and of my
daughter / for after that I see / and as me semethe the will of god is ferther
than I would at this time / For he will not that the marriage of you and of my
daughter take now effect / wherefore I have right great desplaysyr in my heart
only for the love of you / Then the sone of the duc of bourgoyne seeing that
at that time he might do no thing / took leave of the Doulphyn and returned in
to his contree by cause that Vyenne was not in health / and promised that
as soon as he might know that she should be hool / he would return for to
accomplysshe the marriage like as the doulphyn had promised to him /

How the doulphyn did do enprysonne vye^ne by cause that she would not consent
to the marriage to the sone of the duke of bourgoyne /
AFter certain days that the sone of the Duke of bourgoyn was departed fro the
cite of vyenne / the doulphyn for great desplaysyr that he had did do come
tofore him the master Iayler of his prison / and did do make within his
paleys a little prison derke and obscure / and he did do put vyenne and ysabeau
in to that prison / and commanded that they should have nothing to ete but
bread and water / and one damoysel in whom the dolphyn trusted should bring it
to them And in this manner vyenne and ysabeau passyd their time in great sorrow
/ And think not that for this prison / the heart of vyenne would in any wise
consent to the will of her fader / but always encreaced with her ye will
toward her sweet friend Paris / and with sweet words she comforted ysabeau
saying / My dear suster abasshe you not for this derkenes / for I have
confydence in god / that ye shall have yet much welthe / For my fair suster /
It is a much right full thing that for the good knyt paris which for me
suffers so much pain / that I suffer this for him / and also I say to you
that all the pains of this world be nothing grievous to me when I think on his
sweet vysage / And in this manner that one comforted that other / in spekyng
all day of the valyaunte knight Paris /

How the sone of the duc of bourgoyn departed fro his contreye for to come see
the fair lady Vyenne /
When the sone of the duc of bourgoyne had abyden long time in his contree /
On a day he had great thought of vyenne / and that was for the great beauty of
her / and it dysplesed him much that at his being there he had not seen her /
and so concluded to goo and see her / and it was not long after that he came to
the dolphyn and the doulphyn received him much gladly and with great honor /
Then prayed he the dolphyn that it might plese him to show to him vyenne
also seek as she was / For in the world was nothing that he so much desired
to see as her / And the doulphyn seeing the will and desire of him would no
longer hyde his courage / but said to him / My fair sone by the faith that I
owe to god / I have had great desire that this marriage should be made / but my
daughter for this present time will take no husbond ne be married wherefore I
have great desplaysyr and that for the love of you / and to the end that ye
know / that it holds not on me / I swear to you that sithe ye departed fro
this town / I have done her to be kept in a prison derke and obscure / and
has eten nothing but bread and water only / and have sworn that she shall not
goo out of prison till she shall consent to have you in marriage / And thus I
pray you that ye take no desplaysyr / if at this time ye see her not / for ye
may not faylle to have great marriage / in caas that this faylle you and then
he ansuerd / honorable sir I pray you much hertely / sith that it is so /
that er I return I may speak to her / and I shall pray her as much as I shall
mow / and shall see if by any manner I may convert her fro her will / then
said the doulphyn he was content / Then he sent to his daughter clothyng
and vestymentes for to clothe her / and also mete for to ete / For in two
months she had eten but bread and water / whereof she was much feeble / and
that showed well in her vysage / and thus he did by cause she should consent to
the marriage / And then it was concluded / that the sone of the duc of
bourgoyn should come see her and speak with her / and then when Vyenne saw
this and had re^^yued all and knew that the sone of the duc of bourgoyn (...)
speak with her she (...) her damoysel / fair (...) how my fader and mother we^^
by these vestymentes and this (...) that I should ete to deceive me and put me
fro my purpoos / but god forbid that I should do so / and then she took the
hen / and said to her that brought it / sith it playseth to the sone of the
duke to come and speak to me / say ye to him that he may not come these iij
days / and when he comes that he bring with him the bishop of Saint laurens
/ She that had brought to her the hen said all this unto the doulphyn and to
dame ^y^ne her mother / Then vyenne took the two quarters of the hen and put
them under her arm hooles / and held them there so long / that they stonken
much strongely / And when it came to the third day / the bishop of Saint
Laurence and the sone of the Duke of Bourgoyne camen for to see vyenne / and or
they entered they opened a treylle which gaf light in to the prison /

Then when the sone of the duc saw Vyenne in the prison he said to her by
great pity that he had / Noble vyenne how will ye deye thus for hungre so
folyly by your own defaulte / And know ye not well that your fader has given
you to me to have to my wife / wherefore I live in great pain / and in much
great sorrow for the duresse of your courage / whereof ye do right great sin
/ And doubt ye not that god punyssheth you for thynobedyence that ye do to
your fader and to your mother / wherefore I pray you fair Vyenne to tell to me
for what cause ye will not have me in marriage to your husbond / Doubt ye that
when ye shall be with me / that ye may not serve god as well as ye now do that
suffer this pain / I promise you by my faith yt ye shall have playsaunces and
lybertees in all the manners that ye shall conne demand / Then I pray you
that ye will not here deye so dolorously / and if ye will not do it for the love
of me / yet at the least do it for the love of your fader and of your mother
which live for you in great sorrow and in great heaviness / wherefore ye ought
to have pity on them /

When Vyenne had herd these words she was quasi abashed and said sir saving
your honor I am married / how be it ye know him not whom I have in mine heart /
And also I know and grant right well that ye be worthy to have one much
gretter and more hye a lady than I am / and I la^e you wete that for him that I
desire I should suffer more pain than I feel / And therefore I pray you that
fro hens forth ye speak to me no more of this matter / And also I am so evil
dysposed in my person that if it endure in me / my life shall not be long / and
if it were honest I should show it you and than should ye see how it stondeth
with me / Nevertheless approach ye ner to me / and ye shall the better believe me
/ And the sone of the duke of bourgoyne and the bishop of saint laurence
approuched unto vyenne / fro whom issued so great a stenche / that uneath
they might suffer and endure it / which savor came fro under her arm holes
of the two quarters of the hen / which were roten / And when vyenne saw
that they had felt enough of the stenche she said to them / lords ye may now
know enough in what adventure I am dysposed / Then they took leave having
great compassyon on her / And they said to the dolphyn that vyenne was then
half roten and that she stanke / and demed in them self that she might not live
long / qnd that it should be great damage of her death for the souerayn beauty
that was in her / And Incontinent the sone of the duc of bourgoyn took his leave
of the doulphyn / and returned in to his country / and recounted to his fader
the life of vyenne / whereof all they that herd him had great pity in their
heart /

When the doulphyn saw that the marriage was broken / by the deffaulte of his
daughter Vye^ne / he swear that she should never depart fro thens / but if she
would consent to his will /

And so she abode long time in that prison where she had great thought and
sorrow for her sweet and true friend paris / and her desire was on no thing
but for to here tidings of paris her love / But in the estate that she was in
/ no man might bring her tidings / And Edward the fellow of Paris seeing that
Vyenne abode in so great pain / and that none durst speak to her / he had in
his heart great sorrow / and was much moeued of great pity / and also for the
great love that he had to paris / And concluded to make a chapel in the church
that touched the palace of the dolphyn and in a corner he did do dygge so deep
that it was nyghe to the foundement of the prison / where in vyenne was / and
by cause he would not have the thing dysclosed / he would that they should dygge
no ferther / and when the chapel was achyeued and fynysshed / Edward all
allone dygged him self so far / that he made an hole / by which he spoke to
vyenne when he would which cave was made so secretly that no man myt apperceyue
it / So it happed on a day Edward byhelde vye^ne through this hole / and
salewed her / and then when vyenne herd him and knew him / she had so great
Joy and consolacyon / that she seemed that she was risen fro death to life / and
the first tidings that Vyenne demanded of him were if he knew any tidings
of paris and edward told to her that it was not long sith / that he had
received a letter fro him / wryton at genes / Then said vye^ne al weeping to
him / alas when shall ye day come that I shall see him / and that done I would be
co^tente that god should do his will of me / for none other thing I desire in
this world / Alas fair brother what seems you of my life and of this fair
chamber in which I dwell in / certeynly I believe verily / that if paris knew
it / yt for his love I suffer thus much sorrow / that the heart of him should
swelte for sorrow / and after she told to Edward the parliament that she had
with the sone of the duc of bourgoyne / and also of the hen / and prayed him
yt he would send word of al this to paris and that she recommaunded her to him
/ and also that she had none other hope in this world but in him / Edward
brought to her every day fro then forthon mete and drink / and all that was
necessary to her / for her life / and comforted her with fair words the best
wise he might / and Edward wrote al plainly to paris / how for hungre she should
have been deed / ne had he ben / which daily pourueyed for her all that was to
him necessary / and he wrote to him all the manner that Vyenne had holden
with the sone of the Duke of Bourgoyne And that this fair lady Vyenne desired
no thing in this world but for to see him only And also that she prayed him
that he should not depart out of the contree that he was in /

When the noble Paris had received the letter fro Edward and knew that vyenne
abode in prison / it is no need to demand if he had great despaysyr / and
almoost was in such caas / as to l^se his wit for sorrow / And on that other
pa^^e he had great dread that she should be married in eschewyng of the great
harm and pain that she suffered / and herein he was pensyf night and day /
saying to him self / I see well that I may not escape but that vyenne must needs
be married / and by that moyen her love and mine shall faylle / Alas now see I well
that now me byhoueth no hoope ne trust / Alas caytyf and unhappy what shall
byfalle of me / I shall goo so far / that fro her I may never here tidings /
ne also she fro me / and after this he bygan ageyn his complaynte saying / O
ve^ay god of heaven wherefore have thou not done to me so much grace / that in
the stead of her I might suffer the pain that she suffers for me / O cruel
fortune full of cruel tormente / and what has vye^ne done or made that she must
suffer so gr^uous penance / Alas were it not more reason / Justice and cause
that I which have done all this evil bear the punycyon / certes yes /

How Paris sent a letter to Edward his fellow /
AFter that he had made his co^playnte / he wrote a letter unto Edward / doing
him to wit how he had souerayn sorrow for vye^ne which was in prison / and he
thanked him of the goodness and dylygence that he had done toward her / in
prayeng him that he never would faylle her / but contynuelly aid and help her
/ And after he wrote to him how for very dysplaysyr and melancolye he would goo
in to sum strange contreye / And that fro than forthon he should send to him
no moo letters / And that he never reiche for to here moo tidings fro him /
no more than of a deed person / Then when Edward had received these letters
fro Paris and knew that he would ^straunge him fro that contree of genes / and
would goo in to a strange contreye he was much wroth and sore agryeued / And
then Incontinent paris went and told it to the fader and mother of Paris /
whereof they took so great sorrow that they supposed to have lost their wit /
And after edward went and told it also to vyenne / whereof it needs not to
demand the great sorrow that she, had / for it was so great and ouermoche /
that if edward had not comforted her / she had been deed / And then she
complained to ysabeau saying that sythen she never intended to here tidings of
her love Paris she was right well content to deye and that she would never more

How paris went to ship at venyse / for to goo to the holy sepul^re in
Iherusalem /
AFter that pari^ had sent the letter to Edward In contynent he departed fro
genes with his servant / and went to venyse where he took shyppyng / and
saylled so far that he came to alexandrye / where he abode a space of time /
and after in that country he informed him and learned the way to the mou^te of
caluarye and of Iherusalem / and how he might pass surely / And afterward
Paris concluded to goo in to that country a pilgrimage / but tofore or he took
his way / he learned for to speak the langage of moors / And when Paris could
well speak mouryske / he and his varlet took the way toward ynde / And^ so
far labored by their Iourneyes / that they arrived in the land of prester
Johan / In which he dwelled a long time And in that while hye berde grew
long / and after he took the habyte of a more / and also learned all the
custommes and manners of the contree / And he had all way fast by^^ue in our
lord Ihesu Christ / and in the glorious vyrgyn marye his sweet mother / And thus
abydyng in this manner he had great will to goo to Iherusalem to the holy
sepulture / for to see the holy sayntuaryes / and for tacoomplysshe the holy
pylgremage / Then when he was in Iherusalem / he set al his courage in
devotion / and bycam so devout that it was meruaylle / and prayed contynuelly
our lord that by the merit of his passion he would give to him salvation of his
soul / and consolacyon for his body and also for fair vyenne / and after he
departed fro thens and went in to Egypt / and arrived in the contree of the
soudan / and his money bygan to faylle / and hired him a litel house wherein he
dwelled much heavy and sorouful for his Infortune / And also he had great
desplaysyr when he saw other tryumphe and wexe bordes / Now it happed on a day
that paris went to play and dysporte him out of the town in the feldes / and
there met with the faulconuers of the soudan / which came fro hawkyng / and
emonge them was ^ne fawcon much seek / and that fawcon the sowdan loved best
of all the other / Then demanded Pary^ of the fawconner what sickness the
fawcon had / And the fawconner said to him that he wys^ not / Then said paris
truly if he continue in the maladye that he has he shall not live (...) days
/ but if ye do that (...) shall say to you / and if he be not ho^e therwyth he
shall never be hole / Then said ye fawlconner to him / I pray you that ye will
tell me what I shall do for I ensure you faithfully / that if ye may make him
hole / it shall mow auaylle you and me also and that I promise you / for the
souldan had lever lose the best cite that he has than this fawcon / Then
Paris went and sought certain herbs / and gaf them to the fawlconner and bad
him to bind them to the feet of the fawcon / and so he did / and sone after
the fawlcon amended and becam as hole as ever he had be tofore / whereof ye
souldan was much Joyous / and for love of thye faulcon / the souldan made the
fawlconner a great s^rd in his court / Then the faulconner seeing that by the
moyen of paris he had gotten this lordshyp / he did to him much playsyr / and
showed to him as great amytye and frendshyp as be had been his brother / and
brought him in the grace of the souldan / and was received in to his court /
and the souldan loved him so well / that he gaf to him great office / and
mayntened him in great honor / ye shall understand that in this time reigned a
much holy pope / the which was named Innocent / and was a much holy person
and ^^uoute / And it plesed so him that he gaf out a croysee / against the false myscreauntes and hethen men / to the end that the name of our lord Ihesu
christ were more sayntefyed and enhaunced through out al crystyente / And
therefore was maad a great counceyl emonge the cardynals and prelates / and was
concluded by their parliament that this croysee should be wryton to the king of
france / and to other kings christian / dukes / Earls and other great lords /
and so was it done /

How the doulphyn came toward the king of France /
When the king of france had received the letters fro the pope / Incontyne^t he
sent for the doulphyn of vyennoys / that he should come and speak with him /
the which Incontinent came at his commandment / Then the king said to him
/ Sir Godefroy / we have made you to come hither / for ye be one of ye most
wysest of our court / and also ye be of our lygnage / And we late you wete
that our holy fader the pope has wryton to us that he has yeuen a croysee
against the mescreau^tes wherefore we for the love and reverence of god ente^de
for to goo thither / Nevertheless we have aduysed / that ye should goo first in to
thoo parties / and we pray you for the love and reverence of god that ye take
on you the charge for to espy the contrees and also the passages / Then the
doulphyn said / I am ready and apparaylled to do your commandment with good
will / But how shall I mow do it for to pass surely emonge the hethen people
/ For if they apperceyue in any wise that I goo for to espy their contree / I
shall not conne escape / but that I must deye by cruel death if god keep me not /
Then said the king ye may goo and your company surely clothed in habyte of
pylgryms / for ye know well that this is not the first time / that many christian
men have been in the holy land / wherefore I pray you yet eft ones that in ye
name of Ihesu christ that ye make you ready for to goo thither / and take with you
of our knights as meny as it shall playse you / Then the doulphyn seeing the
will of the king / and that Incontinent he must depart / he sent letters to
his wife / that he would goo in to the holy land to seche the holy sayntuaryes
and pylgrymages / and prayed her that she much wisely should govern his land
/ and that vyenne his daughter should not escape out of prison till he returned
for in short time he would come ageyn /

How the Doulphyn took his shyppyng for to goo in to Iherusalem /
AFter that the doulphyn had taken his ship / and passed in to Surrye and
damask / to Iherusalem and in many other places / and had aduysed and espied
much wisely and well all the contree / And inquired of the christian men that
dwelled there many things / without dyscoueryng his will and entente /
Nevertheless sum evil christian men for to get money told it unto the souldan
of babylone / Then when the souldan knew it / he maad no semblaunte / but
Incontinent he made all the passages to be kept where as the pylgryms went by
in such manner as the doulphyn was taken and all his company with him in a
place called Ramon not far fro Iherusalem / which was brought tofore the
souldan / and he ordained that the doulphyn should be tormented and pyned / The
doulphyn seeing him self in such a point said that they should not tormente him
/ and he would say to them the truth / and thus he recounted to the souldan
how the Pope had given out a croysee against them / and how he was comen to
espy the contreye / when the souldan saw this / he said that he would advise
him of what death he would do him to death / in manner that al other should take
ensaumple / And commanded that anon he should be led in to alysandrye / and
there to be put in to an hard prison / and also that none should give to him
but bread and water / Then the doulphyn was brought in to Alysandrye / and
was put in to an hard and strong toure / and there he suffered a miserable life
/ and had kepars that kept him nyt and day / Thus was the doulphyn in great
sorrow / thynkyng never to issue out of ye prison but deed / Nevertheless the
Pope and the king of France / did often times great pain to have him out by
fynaunces / but they might not have him / For the souldan said that he should do
on him such punycyon / that al other should take ensaumple^ / Now late us leave
to speak of the doulphyn / and return we to Paris that knew no thing of
these tidings

NOw recounteth thystorye that paris was in babylone like as ye have tofore
herd / which knew no thing of this fayte / So it happed that by adventure
ij freres relygyous sought thyndulgences of the holy land and aryueden in
babylone / where they would see the seygnorye and the puyssaunce of the sowdan /
For then the sowdan held him in Babylone with much great puyssaunce / These
two freres were of these parties / which being in tho parties it happed as
they went in the town paris fond them / Then paris salewed them and
demanded of these parties and said to them in this manner / After that I have
herd say emonge you christian men ye have a Pope / the which is much strong
and puyssaunt / And also ye have many kings / and great lords / and so great
towns cytees and castellys / that I have merueyll how ye suffer that we that
be not of your law have the seygnorye of the holy land which ought to
apperteyne to you as ye say / And when the freres had herd Paris thus speak /
they were sore aferde / And one of them ansuerd in the langage of moure / For
they wist none other but paris was a moure / and so did al they of the country
/ and he said to him / Sir I believe well that ye have herd say / that in our
parties been assembled great companyes of people and men of war for to come in
to these parties / by cause that our holy fader the Pope / has granted out a
croysee / and in the time whiles our men of war assembled / the king of
france which is the grettest of crystyente / sent a noble baron which is
named the doulphyn of vyennoys for to vysyte and espy these parties / Then
he being in these parties / the souldan set men in such places where as the
pylgryms were accustomed to pass / And suddenly he did do tak^ him in a cite
named Ramon / and after sent him in to Alysandrye / and there set him in an
evil prison / wherein I suppose that he be deed / and thus for this cause / the
fayt was dyscouerd / Then said Paris how is that lord named / Then said the
friar / he is named godefroy of Allaunson doulphyn of vyennoys / And when paris
herd this he was much abashed / but he made no semblaunter / And thought in
his heart / that his adventure might yet come to good and effect / Then he
demanded them of many things / and said to them / that he would more speak to
them another time / and demanded them where they were lodged / and they told
him more for dread than for love / for they thought he would have done to them
sum harm /

When Paris was departed fro the freres / he was much pens if how and in what
manner he might goo in to Alexandrye for to see the doulphyn / and how he might
get him onte of prison / and so much he thought on his fayte / that he
purposed to goo to the hostry where the freres were lodged / and so went
thither / and when the freres saw him / they were sore aferde Then paris took
them by the hands / and ladde them to solace through ye cite spekyng of many
things always in the langage of moure / and said to them / I have great desire
to see that christian knight which is in alexandrye For I have always had good
will to the christian men / peradventure I might yet well help him / and if ye
will come with me I promise you by my law / that I shall make you good chere /
and doubt ye nothing / and then when the freres herd him thus speak they
wist not what to ansuer / they had so great fere / Nevertheless they trustyng in
the mercy of god / they promised him / that they should goo with him / though
they should deye / and prayden god in their courage that he would grant grace
that he might come out of prison / Then Paris had great playsyr of the
ansuer of the freres and wend never to see ye hour / that he might be with
the doulphyn for to see the end of his adventure / and so departed fro the
fretes / and went strayte to the faulconner of the souldan with whom he had
great knowleche / and said to him / Seynour I thank you of the great honor /
curtosye and gentylnes that ye have do to me / and playse it you to wit that I
will depart fro hens in to alysandrye / and I promise to you that for your love
I shall not tarry long / but that I shall return hither ageyn / And by cause I
am there unknown / and that I never was there / I pray you right humbly /
that I myt have a maundement ^f the souldan / that he command to the
governors that I may goo thorugh all his land surely / For ye know well that
one may not keep him over well fro evil people / Therefore I pray you and require
that ye will get me such a maundement / and also that ye will command me
humbly to the good grace of my lord the souldan / and forthwyth the faulconner
went to the souldan and made his request for Paris / and Incontinent the
souldan granted him al his desire / saying that it much desplaysed him / of
the departing of paris and if he would abide and dwell in his court he would
make him a great lord / Then the faulconner said / Dear sir he has promised
me / that in short time he shall return / Then the souldan did do make the
maundement like as he would deuyse / chargyng al his lords officers and
subgettes of towns cytres and castellys of his land that they should do to him
great honor / and that they should give and deliver to him all that should be
necessary to him without taking any money or any other thing of him / And
also the souldan gaf to Paris many rich clothes and vestymentes of cloth of
gold and of sylke / and also he gaf to him great tresour / prayeng him that he
should not long tarry / but hastily return ageyn / and promised him that he
should make him a great lord / and delyuerd his maundement / the which was
sealed with the propre seal of the souldan / and sygned with his own hand

When Paris had received all these things that the souldan had given to him /
he took leave of him and of his court and went with the freres in to Alexandrye
/ Incontinent after he was comen he showed the maundement to the admyral / the
which anon after he had seen it did great honor to Paris / and delyuerd to
him a fair lodgyng pourueyed of al things necessary / and delyuerd another to
the freres / Thadmyral came every day to see paris in his lodgyng for to do him
honor and company / and went and rode to gyder thorugh the cite / and by
cause that Paris was rychely clad / every man made to him great honor and said
that he seemed well to be the sone of so^me great moure And on a day as they rode
in the cite they passed forth by the toure where as the dolphyn was in prison /
Then Paris demanded of the admyral what toure it was that was so fair /
Then he told to him yt it was a much cruel prison and terryble In which
the souldan held a prysonner a great lord and baron of the theste / which was
comen for tespye these contreyes / Then said paris I pray you late us goo
see him / and the admyral said he should gladly / Then they alyghted fro their
horses / and entered in to the prison / and when paris saw the doulphyn / he
had in his heart great desplaysyr / by cause of the miserable and sorouful life
that he suffered / and Paris demanded of ye kepars what man he was / And they
said / that he was a great baron of France / Then said paris / understands
he mourysshe / and they said nay / but that notwythstondyng if he would speak to
him / that they should find tour^hem^n enough / Then said Paris he would
return another day for to demand of him of the parties of the weste / and
prayed thadmyral to give commandment to the kepars / that as often as be sh^^d
come / that they should show him to him / and Incontinent he commanded like as
paris had desired / and then they departed / and a few days after paris
returned and came to the prison and brought one of the freres with him that
could speak mouryske / and when they were within the prison / paris said to the
friar that he should salewe him curtoysly / Nevertheless the friar knew no
thing that paris could speak frensshe / Then the friar said to the doulphyn
/ that that lord was come for to vysyte him / and that he loved well christian men
/ and that he was well in the grace of the souldan / and that he trusted is
much in him as in any man of his contreye / and thus the friar demanded many
things of the doulphyn in the name of paris / and said if he might do for him
he would gladly

When the doulphyn herd the relygious friar thus speak in the person of the
moure / he was much abashed in his courage / bysechyng our lord that he would
put him in such courage and good will for to bring him out of prison Paris
desired to here tidings of the fair vyenne said to the friar / that he should
ask of the doulphyn if he had any wife or children / Then the dolphyn began
to weep / and said that he had a wife / and a daughter holden for the fairest of
France / whom he held in prison because she would take no husbond / Then
paris began to comfort him by the mouth of the friar / saying that he should
take all in pacyence / and god should yet ones deliver him out of prison / by
which words the doulphyn was so rejoiced and Joyous / that him seemed that god
had appyered to him / and the doulphyn said to the friar that it was great pity
that the moure was not christian / and prayed our lord that he would give to him
puyssaunce to keep him in that good will that he had and so departed that one
fro that other much comforted / Then paris said to the kepars that he had
found so great playsyr in the prysonner / that he would often times come for to
dyspo^te him and they said when it playsed him he should return and be welcome
/ and then paris said to the freres that were in yt place if I thought to be
sure of you / I think well to find the moyen to bring this prysonner out of
prison / and the freres were much admerueylled of this which paris had said
to them / and they said to him / by the faith that we owe to our god / that of
us ye need not to doubt / and in caas that ye be in will late us assaye but
it must be done secretly / for ye see well how many kepars been there
contynuelly / Then said Paris I shall give to you good counceyl and remedy of
all this / but I will have two things / The first thing is I will that ye goo
with me / That other is that he shall give to me my living honorably in his
contre / for I am in great doubt when I have delyuerd him / and shall be in his
contreye that he will set naught by me / and I can no mestyer ne craft / and
so I might be well deceived / Therefore if he will assure me / and that he will
give to me a yefte such as I shall demand him when I shall be in his contreye
/ I shall deliver him and shall leave my contree for love of him / and ye may see
in what estate I am /

On the morn Paris and the freres came in to the prison and the friar
recounted al this to the doulphyn / and when the doulphyn understood this / him
thought that god bare him away / and said / I thank god and this moure of the
good will that he has toward me / For I never did him service ne playsyr
wherefore he ought to do so much for me / Nevertheless I hope that is the
playsyr of god that he shall deliver me out of prison / I am ready to swear upon
the body of Ihesu Christ or I ever depart from hens / that as soon as I shall be
in mine own land I shall mayntene him in more gretter estate / than he ne is
here and I will that he do all his will of al my land / for it shall suffyse
to me only that I have a ^yuyng for me and my wife / and I shall do all that he
will / and so say ye to him on my behalue / And then the friar told al to
paris that which the doulphyn had said and promised to do / and to the end that
paris should be more sure / he said to the friar that he should bring to fore
him the body of our lord Ihesu christ / and that tofore him he should swear to
hold all that he promised / and the friar told it to Paris / and the
doulphyn swear it tofore Paris to accomplysshe all that he had promised And
when he had sworn / to the end that Paris should be the better content / the
doulphyn received the precious body of our lord Ihesu Christ / saying that it
should be to the dampnacyon of his soul / in caas that he accomplysshed not all that he had promised when they should be in his land / and when this was do
paris and the freres departed fro the doulphyn / and went to the port / for
to wit if there were any fuste that would come hytherward / and by adventure
they fond a fuste / and Paris with the freres spoke to the patron / and
promised him a M besaunts of gold if they would let have passage five persons
/ The Patron seeing the great tresour / said to them that he was content / but
he would have half at the port / and said to them / lords I pray you make you
ready / For in caas that the moures of this land fond us we should be al deed /
Then said Paris make your self al ready / for this night at mydnyght I shall
come / And after this Paris returned to his lodgyng and did do make ready much
vytayll and the best wynes that he could get and he with the freres maad
prouysyon of all other things and mantellys and towellys /

When al was ready paris went to the kepars of the prison and said / I thank
you many times of the playsyrs that ye have done to me / I will now depart fro
hens for to return to my lord the souldan / but for your love I will soupe with
you this night and pray you that we may soupe to gyder / and they ansuerd that
it well pleased them for his love Then Paris sent for the vytayll and for the
wyn / and after it was come / they souped to gyder / And the kepars which had
not been accustomed to drink wyn / drank so much that they all were drunk
/ and Incontinent l^yed them down to sleep / and slepte so fast / that for no
thing they could not awake them / and when paris saw that / he said to the
freres / that they should vnfeter the doulphyn / and that they should opene the
yates of the prison / and if any of the kepars awake I shall slay him / Then
the freres began to vnfetere the doulphyn with great dread / prayeng god to be
their aid and help / And when the doulphyn was loos he cladde him like a
moure After Paris slew all the kepars one after another by cause if they
awoke they should not come after them /

This done / the doulphyn with paris and his varlet / and the two freres camen
to the port / and hastily entered in to the fuste which was al ready / and wonde
up their saylle / and by the help of god began so fast to saylle that with in
few days they arryueden in a place that then was christian and there the
doulphyn went a land by cause he was much grieved and annoyed as well of the sea / as for the harm that he had suffered in prison / and there borrowed money
/ and fro thens came in to cypres / where was a king which had dwelled in the
court of the king of france The which as soon as he knew that the doulphyn
of vyennoys was come / he went to mete him and prayed him that he would come and
lodge in his paleys / And the doulphyn went thither / whereof the king had great
Joy / and there he made him great chyere / for many times they had seen each
other in ye kings court of France / and after the king demanded him of his
adventure / and the doulphyn recounted it to him al alonge / and because of the
coming of the doulphyn he made much great feste / and received him much hyely
/ and made him to soiourne there as long as it playsed him / And when the
doulphyn had sojourned there at his playsyr / he took leave of the king and of
al his court / thankyng him much of the great playsyr yt he had done to him /
The king seeing that the doulphyn would depart / he gaf to him great yeftes /
and did do arm two galleyes which accompanied him / and brought him upon the sea / and had so good wind that in few days after they brought him in to
aygues mortes /

When the doulphyn was arrived / the knights of the doulphyne herd it anon /
and forthwyth maad them ready and went to horsback and met with him at aygues
mortes / and there received him in great honor / and so came forth the ryt
way to vyenne / and for Joy of his coming / al they of the cite made a much
noble and meruayllous feste / which endured well fyftene days / and the
playsyr and Joy was so great emonge them by cause they had recouuerd their
lord / that no man should and could have thought it / Paris in all this wise
never changed his vesture ne clothyng but contynuelly went to mass / and by
the commandment of the doulphyn the people did him great reverence and honor
/ so much that paris was ashamed thereof / and spoke no thing but mouryske /
And he had a great berde / and made to no pers^ne of the world any knowleche /
and after a while of time / the doulphyn for taccomplysshe that he had promised
to paris by the friar / did do say to paris and do demand if he would have the
seygnourye of his land and contree / For he was al ready for taccomplysshe that
/ which he had promised / And Paris made to him ansuer / that he should keep
stylle his land / Then the doulphyn did do demand him if he would have his
daughter vyenne / and paris made the friar to say ye / for that pleased him well
/ And then they went to her / Then when they were tofore Vyenne the friar
spoke first Madame ye know well that my lord your fader has been a great while
in prison / and yet should have been / ne had have been / this moure / which
has saved him / puttyng his person in right great peril and danger for the
love of my lord your fader / And thus ye may well know how much he is holden
to him / and by cause hereof your fader is subget to him ever / wherefore your
fader prays you that upon all the playsyr that ye will do for him / that ye
will take him for your husbond / And he shall pardonne all the desplaysyr that
ever ye did to him / when the friar had fynysshed his words / vyenne ansuerd
to him saying / The bishop of saint laurence knows well that is here present
that it is long sith that if I ^^old have be married / I might have been married
with more honor unto my fader / than unto this moure / for the sone of the duc
of borgoyne had espoused me if I would have consented but god has put me in
such a maladye / that I may not long live in this world / and every day my
maladye encreaceth and so enpayreth me that I am half roten wherefore I pray you
to say to my fader that he hold me excused / for at this time I will not be
married / Then they took their leave of vyenne and recounted all this to the
doulphyn / Then the doulphyn said to the friar that he should say it to the
moure / and so the friar told it al to paris / and then paris which was
aferde to lose the love of vyenne / went for to see her in the prison with the
friar and the bishop of saint laurence / Then when Paris saw vyenne in that
dysposycyon / he had much great sorrow and great merueylle / and then he
made the friar to salewe her in his name / and vyenne ansuerd unto his gretyng
right curtoysly / and the friar said in the name of paris / Madame ye know well
I have delyuerd your fader out of prison / whereof ye ought to have synguler
playsyr / and yet he should have been there if I had not have been and helped
him out / and he pardonneth you with good heart and good will all the
desplaysyrs that ever ye did against his playsyr / And prays you that ye take
me for your husbond / and will that we have the lordshyp of the doulphyne / and
therefore I pray you / that neither ye nor I lose not this honor / And yet more
though this were not / ye ought not to dysobeye the commandments of your
fader / And then vyenne ansuerd to the friar as to the person of Paris
saying / I know well that ye have delyuerd my fader out of prison / Not
wythstondyng my fader shall have such regard against you that ye shall lose no
thing / And I wot well that ye be a man of great lygnage / and are thorthy to
have a gretter lady than I am / But the bishop of saint Laurence which is
present knows well that for the maladye that I am in / I may not long live /
and then said the friar in his name this is by cause I am a moure that ye
refuse me / I promise you that I shall become christian / but I think well that if
ye knew who that I am / and what I have left for to bring your fader out of
prison / that ye would preyse me more than ye do / know ye for certain that
your fader shall be pariured / for he has promised that ye shall be my wife
whereof ye shall have blame / therefore if it playse you grant ye him his will
/ Then said vyenne / lord I have herd say much good of you / and that ye be
he that have done so much for my fader / but nevertheless in the maladye in the
which I am / none ought to counceyl me to take an husbond / For my life may not
long endure / and by cause that ye may know that I say troth approach ye ner
to me / and ye shall feel and smelle in what dysposycyon I am of my person /
And then they approuched ner to her / and vyenne had put two quarters of an
hen under her two arm hooles / and there issued so great stenche that the
bishop ne the friar might not suffer it / Nevertheless the* stynche was to
paris a good odor / for he smellyd it not and said I wot not what ye smelle /
for I feel none evil savor / And they meruaylled strongely / by cause he felt
not the odor / And the friar said in paris name / For this odor shall I never
leave you and I assure you I shall never depart fro hens until ye have consented
to that your fader will / and vyenne answered much angrely and said by the faith
that I owe to god I shall rather re^ne with my head against the wa^^e that I shall
make my brayn issue out of my mouth / and so shall ye be the occasyon of my
death / Then said the friar ye shall not so do madame / For I promise you fro
hens forth / that I shall never speak more to you / sithe that it is not your
will ne plesyr / but at lest of one thing I pray you / that this night ye
advise you / and I shall return to morn for to have of you an ansuer / and ye
shall take counceyll of your fellow / and I pray to god that ye may be well
counceylled / and all these things said the friar in the name of paris to
vyenne / And after they took their leave of vyenne / and said all to the
doulphyn / whereof he was then much dyspleased / and bad the friar to tell
it all unto Paris for to excuse him / and that he should not leye the blame on
him / And when they were departed fro vyenne / she said to ysabeau / My fair
suster / what seems you of the wysedom of my fader / that thinks that I
should take this moure to my husbond / and have refused the sone of the Duke of
bourgoyne / but god forbede that ever in my life I have other lord than Paris to
mine husbond / whom I hope yet to have / and ysabeau said / Certes Madame I
wot not what to say of your fader which would give you to a moure in marriage /
I have thereof great thought / for he has said that he shall return to morn to
see you / and has said that ye should remember and advise you /

How Paris came to see vyenne in the prison / and how she knew him /
ANd on the morn betymes Paris cladde him much more rychely than he had be
accustomed / and gyrde with a much rich sword / and came to the prison with
the friar and the friar said to her / Madame we been returned for to know your
good answer / and your entencyon / And vyenne ansuerd / lords mine entencyon is
that I shall never break my promise that I have made / For I have auowed that I
shall never take husbond / ne goo out of this prison / but deed sauf him to
whom I have promised / and therefore return ye in good time Then said the
friar / by my faith I wot not what to say / for it is great dommage that ye
suffer so much sorrow and pain / and sith it is thus your will and that ye
will none otherwise do / Nevertheless the moure prays you / that it may playse
you to do to him so much grace / that sith ye will not take him in marriage /
that ye will were this ring for the love of him / Now this ring was the same
ring that vyenne gaf to paris when he departed fro her in the hows of the
chappelayn / and vyenne by cause they should no more come ageyn took the ring /
and when she had received the ring / paris said to the friar / I pray you
that ye tarry a little without / For I will see what countenance she will make
of the ring / and the friar said gladly / Nevertheless he meruaylled much /
and Incontinent the friar went onte / and vyenne began to behold the ring /
and when paris saw that vyenne byhelde the ring so strongely / he began to
speak in his plain tongue / and said / O much noble lady why be ye so much
admeruayled of that ring / Then said vyenne / Certes to my semyng I saw
never a fayrer / Then said paris / Therefore I pray you that ye take therein
playsyr for the more that ye byholde it the more ye shall praise it /

When Vyenne herd the moure thus speak / then she was more admeruaylled than
tofo^^ / and was as a person al abashed and said / Alas am I enchaunted / and
what is this that I see and here speak And in saying these words she would have
fled for fere out of the prison / by cause she herd the moure so speak /
then said paris / O much noble lady vyenne / meruaylle ye no thing / ne
have ye no doubt / lo here is paris your true servant / and vyenne was
then abashed more than tofore / Certes said she this may not be but by work
enchaunted / and paris said / Noble lady hit is none enchaunted work / For I
am your servant paris which left you with ysabeau in such a church / and
there ye gaf to me the dyamond which now I have delyuerd to you and there ye
promised to me that ye would never take husbond but me / and be ye no thing
admeruaylled of the berde ne of the vesture that I were / for they take away
the knowleche of me / and many other words said paris to vyenne / by which
she knew clearly that he was paris and for the souerayn love that she bare to
him / and for the great Joy that she had / she began to weep in his arms /
and tembrace and kiss him much swetely / and there they comforted each other
with sweet words / and so abode long time / vye^ne could not enough kiss him
and enbrace him / and also paris demanded of her of her adventure / and she
told him all / And of all this ysabeau had nothing herd of / for she was
fast a sleep by cause she had watched all the night before / and for the
great Joy and swetenes that paris and vye^ne demeaned between them she awoke /
and when she saw vyenne being enbraced with the moure she said / Madame what
is this that ye do / have ye lost your wit / that so enbrace this moure /
has he enchaunted you that ye suffer him so famylyer with you / and is this
the faith that ye keep to paris / for whom ye have suffered so much pain and
sorrow / and vyenne said / Sweet suster say ye no such words / but come and
take your part of the solace that I have / for also well have ye founden good
adventure as I have / See ye not here my sweet paris / whom so much we have
desired / Then ysabeau approached ner to him and byhelde him well and saw that
it was paris / and she went and kyssed him / and demened so much great Joy
between them three / that there is no person in the world that might say ne
think it / but so abode a great while in this soulas and Joy / till at last
paris spack / Sweet vyenne it byhoueth that we goo hens tofore my lord the
dolphyn your fader / For now fro hens forth it is necessary that he know all
our fayte / Nevertheless I pray you to say nothing / till I desire you / and al
three came out of the prison / and sonde the friar which meruaylled gretely
and all they to gydre went to the doulphyn / which had souerayn playsyr when
he saw them And nevertheless he was much abusshed how his daughter was so come
/ and then paris said to the friar / Say ye to the doulphyn that I have
converted his daughter to his will and to mine / and that it playse him that
she be my wife / and the friar said so / Then the doulphyn said to his
daughter / will ye take this man for your husbond / which has delyuerd me out
of prison in great peril of his person / Then demanded vyenne of Paris if
he would that she should speak / and paris said ye / And then Vyenne said to
the doulphyn / My fader I am ready to do your commandment and his / and pray
you to pardonne me and to give to me your benedyctyon / and when she said thus
/ her fader pardonned her and gaf to her his blessyng and kyssed her / Then
said vyenne loo here is my good friend Paris whom I have so much desired /
and for whom I have suffered so much pain and sorrow and fader this is he
that so swetely song and floyted / and that wanne the Ioustes in this cite /
and bare with him the shield of crystal and my garlonde / and also this is he
that wanne the Ioustes in the cite of paris and wan there the three baners with
the iij Iewellys / and went away with them without knowing of any man / And
also he has delyuerd you out of prison puttyng his life in Ieopardye for you /
and when the doulphyn understood al this he was meruayllously glad and Joyous /
After al this paris went to his fader / and when he saw him and knew that he
was his sone paris / whom he had so long desired to see / he enbraced him and
kyssed him / and for the Joy that he had he could not speak a word and after
all the other lords and knights ran for tembrace and kiss him / and after
this Joy Paris fader said to the doulphyn / My lord playse it you that I may
borowe my sone home to my house for to see his mother and his fellow Edward /
Then said the doulphyn it playseth me right well only for this day / For to
morn I will that the marriage of him and my daughter be made and solempnysed here
/ And then messyre Jacques went with his sone unto his house / And when he was
there / verayly his fader / his mother / and his fellow Edward wist not where
they were for Joy and playsyr that they had and that was no wonder / for they
had no moo children but him / and he should wedde the daughter of their lord /
and also Paris was in that time become a valyaunte knight / and full of al
beaulte / and for many reasons it was no meruayll though they had in him great
Joy and playsyr / and Edward demanded of him of his adventure / and many
other things / And he recounted and told him all /

How Paris espoused and wedded vyenne / and of the feste that was there made /
Then on the morn the dolphyn gaf his daughter in marriage to paris And the
feste was much noble and sumptuous / For much people were comen thither for to
see the feste / and it endured fyftene days / And the playsyr and solace
which was done for the love of Paris and of vyenne was so great / that
uneath it may be byleued / which paris and Vyenne lived to gyder a great
while in right great consolacyon and playsyr / but after thaccomplysshement of
the marriage / the fader and mother of paris lyueden not long after in this
world / and Paris had by Vyenne his wife three children / that is to wete two
sons and one d^ughter / And the doulphyn ordained for them much noble
matrymonye / And paris after the death of his fader and his mother would that
Edward his dear fellow should be herytyer of all the goods that his fader left
and gaf to him ysabeau to his wife / which lived to gyder long time in great
love and concord / And sone after the doulphyn and his wife deyeden / And
then was Paris doulyhyn and had the possessyon of all the seygnourye / the
which lived with vyenne in this world forty year and led a good and holy
life / in so much that after thentendement of sum men they be saints in
heaven / and they deyed both in one year / And semblably Edward and ysabeau
deyed both tweyne in one year / Therefore late us pray unto our lord that we
may do such works in this world / that in such wise we may accompanye them
in the perdurable glory of heaven Amen /
