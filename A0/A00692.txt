THE Burning of Margaret Ferne-seede.
THe grosest part of folly, and the most repugnant, even unto our own natural
reason, is to think that our hidden abominations can be concealed from the
eye of the Almighty, or that he seeing our bloody and crying sins, will
not either reveal them before his Ministers of public justice, or in his
best pleased time, power down sharp vengeance for such presumptuous and
rebellious offenses. Oh! the miracles in these Revelations are such, and so
infinite, that the thought of man or his wisdom is but mere weakness, going
about to comprehend such unspeakable judgments: and of this we have before
our eyes a most notable example in this wretched woman, of whom my present
discourse entreats, named Margaret Ferne-seede, a woman that even from her
time of knowledge (if the general report of the world, according to the old
adage, may be taken for an Oracle) was given to all the looseness and
lewdness of life, which either unlawful lust, or abominable prostitution
could violently cast upon her, with the greatest infamy, yea, and with such a
public and inrespectiue unchastity, that neither being chaste nor caute,
she regarded not either into what ear the loathsomeness of her life was
sounded, or into what bed of lust her lascivious body was transported: in this
more then beastiall lasciuiousnes, having consumed the first part of her youth,
finding both the corruption of her blood to check the former heat of her lust,
and the too general ugliness of her prostitution, to breed a loath in her
ordinary customers, being then confirmed in some more strength of years,
took a house near unto the Iron-gate of the Tower, where she kept a most
abominable and vilde brothell house, poisoning many young women with that
sin wherewith her own body long before was filthilie bebotched. From this
house at the Iron-gate, she was married unto one Anthony Ferne-seede a Tailor,
dwelling in Ducke-lane, but keeping a shop upon Addle-hill near Carter-lane.
This Anthony was amongst his neighbors, reputed to be both sober and of very
good conversation.

Now it happened that some few months ago in the fields of Peckham near
London, there was found a man slain having his throat cut, a knife in his
hand, gold ringes upon his fingars, and forty shillings in money in his
pursse, his wounds of so long continuance that it was not only corrupted, but
there was also Maggots, or such like filthy worms ingendered therein, which
gave testimony to the beholders, that he had not slain himself in that place,
as well because the place was free from such a spectacle the day before, as
also that such corruption could not proceed from a present slaughter. Again,
what the person slain, no man knew, both because his phis^^omie was altered
in his death, and because his acquaintance was little or none in those parts
about Peckham: in the end, searching his pockets, and other parts of his
apparaile, amongst other notes and reckonings, they found an Indenture wherein
a certain youth which did serve him was bound unto him: this Indenture gave
them knowledge both of his name, and of the place of his dwelling, whereupon,
certain discreet persons of Peckham, sent to Londdon to Ducke-lane, and
inquiring for the house of one Anthony Ferne-seede, delivered to his wife the
disaster and mischance which had befallen her husband, which her hardoned heart
received, not as a message of sorrow, neither did ye grudging of an afflicted
countenance gal her remembrance, but as if it had been the report of some
ordinary or vulgar news, she embraced it with an inrespectiue neglect and
carelesnes, and demanded instantly (before the message would tell her how he
dyed) whether his throat were cut, or that he had cut his own throat, as
either knowing or prophesing how he did, yet to observe a customarie fashion,
or (as the proverb is) to carry a candle before ye devil, she prepares
herself and her Servant, in all haste to go to Peckham to behold her husband:
and in ye way as she went, it was her chance to meet with one of her Husbands
ancient acquaintance, who feeling that in charity which she ought to have felt
in nature, began to complain her misfortune, telling her she had lost a most
honest and good husband: she whom the devil now would not suffer to
dissemble, (though his greatest art be in dissimulation) told him her fear
was, she should not hear so well of him: he wondering at her ungodly
carelessness, let her pass, when presently she met another of her
acquaintance, who with like charity to the former, began to pity her
griefs, (though grief was never further from her heart) and to wish her those
comforts which are fit for affliction, but she as careless as before, gave him
(by the neglect of her words) true testimonye how far sorrow was from her
heart, which when he noted, he said, why mistress Ferne-seede, is ye loss of a
good husband so slightly to be regarded? for mine own part, had such a
unschance feign to my fortune, I shouldere this have wept out mine eyes with
true sorrow: but she quickly made him answore, tut six, mine eyes are ill
already and I must now preserve them to mend my clothes not to mourn for a
husband: after that, in her going, the wind blowing the dust in her face, she
takes her skatff and wiped her eyes, and said she should scarce know her
husband when she saw him, these curtizan like speeches made her
acquainta^celeaue her, and wished her more grace, so she and her boy came where
the body was, where more for awe of the Magistrate then any terror she felt,
she made many sower faces, but the dryness of her brain would suffer no
moisture to dessend into her eyes: many questions were asked her, to which she
answered with such constancy, that no suspicion could be grounded against her:
then was her boy taken and examined, whod liuered the abomination of her life,
and that since her marriage with his master, she had lived in all disquietnes,
rage, and distemperature, often threatening his life and contryuing plots for
his destruction: that she had ever since her marriage, in most public and
notorious manner, maintained a young man, with whom (in his view) she had often
committed adultrie: that the same young man since his masters loss was fled
he knew not whether, and that his mistress had even then before the message of
his masters death, sold all his goods (as he supposed) to fly also after him
whom she loved: all these speeches were not only seconded, but almost approved
by some of her neighbors, which lived near unto her, insomuch that she was the
second time taken into a more strict examination: wherein albeit she could not
deny any of her general assertions, yet touching the death of her husband,
that she forswore and renounced the fact or practice thereof to be hers, with
such a shameless constancy, that ^^ee struck amazement into all that heard
her: in the end by authority of Justice she was committed to the white Lion in
Southwarke: during the time of which imprisonment, till her time of trial,
thinking to out face truth with boldness, and sin with impudence, she
continued out all her examinations taken before several Justices in her former
denialls, and whereas the Rod of imprisonment laid upon others, is received as
a gentle correction, whereby to look into themselves, it was to her rather the
bellows of indignation then a temperer to patience: rather a kind of frenzy,
then a cooler of fury, and rather a pruoker to evil then a perswader to
goodness, for she was seldom found to be in charity with any of her fellow
prisoners, nor at any time in quiet with her self, rather a prouoker then an
appeaser of dissentions, given to much swearing, scarce praying but continually
scoulding, so that she was as hateful to all them that dwelt with her in that
her last home the prison, as she was to people of honest conversation, having
deserved the name of a Baud) while she lived abroad.

In this uncivil order, spending her hours, the time of trial coming on,
(when such offenders were to appear before the earthly Judge, to give account
of their lives past) amongst many others, this Margaret Ferneseed was one and
at the assizes last, according to the order of law, she was indighted, and
arraigned, the purpose of which indictment, was to have practiced the murder
of her late husband Anthony Ferne-seede, who as before was found dead in
Peckham field nere Lambeth: to the indit^^ment she pleaded not guilty, putting
her cause to God and the Country, which were a credible Jury paniled, and had
there made their personal appearance for that purpose: then were these
several witnesses produced against her, namely of the incontinentnes of her
life past, her attempt to poison her husband before this murder, as also to
prepare broth for him, and put powder in it, her slight regard of him in his
life, and her careless sorrow for him after death: with other circumstances,
as the flight of the fellow whom she had lived long in adultery with all,
her present sale of her goods upon her husbands murder, as it may be justly
thought, with purpose to fly after him: on which lawful evidence, she was
co^uicted, and after judgment given her to be burned: and from thence she was
conveyed back to the White Lion, till the time appointed for her execution.

How Margaret Ferne-seede spent her time in prison, from Satterday, the day of
her conviction, till Monday the last of February, when in S. Georges fields
she was executed.
BEing come back to the prison, for the first night she disposed her self
according to her ancient habit, being as it were so rooted, and accustomed to
evil, that as even death it self had not power to make her forget it, and
endeavor a better course: but being at the same time in the prison with her,
three Gentlemen who likewise were condemned, and who, through the course of
their lives had not taught them to live well: yet the care of theirs souls
remembered them to dye well these Gentlemen having heard how ill her life past
had been, and that her countenance was as resolute, importuned the keeper that
they might have her company, partly to instruct her, but especially yt she
might see them, and by the reformation of their lives she might learn to amend
her own and as they did, to prepare her self fit for death: whose porsuasion
and wholesome counsels of their own, with comfortable promises of our
merciful Savior Jesus Christ to them that unfeignedly believe in him, and by
unfeigned repentance make way to their salvation, as also with threatening her
with the terrible Judgments of Hell which are prepared for them that perish
through lack of grace, they so wrought in her, she was at last drawn to make
a confession of her former life past, and to repent her of the same. The form
of which was in this manner.

The Confession and repentance of Margaret Ferneseed, after her condemnation in
the White Lion.
TO prepare the reader for this confession of hers, know that I was credibly
satisfied, that when the heat of her fury was past, to which she was much
subject unto) she a woman well spoken, offaire deliverance, and good persuasion:
and so to her confession.

To excuse my self O Lord before thee, who knows the conspiracies of our
thoughts even to the utmost of our actions, (how ever so private or publicly
committed,) were folly, or to justify my self were sin, since no flesh can
appear pure in thy sight: I here therefore, with prostrate knees, and dejected
eyes, as unworthy to look up unto thy divine Majesty, with a contrite heart
and penitent soul, also here voluntariely confess, I am the greatest of
sinners, which have deserved thy wrath and indignation: In this good manner she
proceeded, and withal satisfied all that came, and desired to have private
conference with her, of the whole course of her life, that in her youth, even
from the age of aptness, she had been a prostitute, whore but growing into
desabled years, to please the loose desires of such customers, she after
turned baude, a course of life more hateful in tempting and seducing youth,
then the other in committing sin: the one makes but spoil and ruin of her
self, and the other of a multitude, for (quoth she) I my self have had ten
several women retaining to my house for that purpose: some were men's wives,
which repaired thither both by appointment, and at conuenent hours, when their
husbands might least suspect or have knowledge of their absence: and these
women did I first tempte to their fall, some, by persuading them they were not
beloved of their husbands, especially if I could at any time have note of any
breach or discontent between them: others, that their husbands maintained them
not sufficiently to express their beauty, and according to their own deserts:
of these, the^ having brought my purpose to effect, and that I knew they had
offended, I made this booty that they were as fearful to offend mes, as their
husbands should have knowledge of their offenses: and these allowed me a
weekly pention for coming to my house, and durst not at all times but find
opportunity to come whenever my self or such loose friends, whom either
they had been familiar withal, or now desired to be acquainted with them,
should send for any of them, to supply my house, and make spoil of young maids
who were sent out of the country by their friends, herewith hope to advance
themselves: I went weekly to the Carriers, where if the maid liked me, I so
wrought with the Carrier that she Aldomeleft me till I had brought her to be as
had as I purposed, which effected, every one of them I compelled to give me
ten shillings a week out of their gettings: having as I said sildome less then
ten whose bodies and souls I kept in this bondage: Besides I confess I was a
continual receiver of theft stolen: but in all this, as it was badly got, so
was it worse consumed for nothing of it did prospere with me, whereby (quoth
she) I acknowledge I have deserved death, and in the highest degree, but for
this which I am condemned, Heaven that knows best the secrets of our hearts,
knows I am innocent.

But who knows not that in evil, there is a like impudence to deny, as there
is a forwardness to act: in which we will leave here whom the law has found
guilty, and having thus truly related her own confession, we proceed to thee
manner of execution.

First only touching the evidence of two Sailers, given to the Jury at her
arraignment: Among other circumstances that was auailablest to condemn her,
this was one and the chiefest: during the time while she kept a bad house about
the Iron-gate: by Tower-ditch, there happened a couple of Bargemen to come to
revel at her house with such Guestes as she kept to entertain loose
customers, and having spent the whole day in large riot and much expense, ye
night being late, for that time they made their lodging there, they being a
bed, it happened that night (which was sildome) her husband came to make his
lodging there also, and being chambered with his wife, but a wall between
where these Bargemen lay, they could expreslie hear them every word that
passed between them, the effect of which: was, the reproving of her for her
had life, his persuading her to amendment, which she not willing to listen unto
fell a scoulding at him, and so left both his bed and chamber some time passing.

At last Master Ferneseede heard these Barge-men cough, and wondering to have
strangers lodged in his house (for it was not common to his knowledge) arose
out of his bed, and demanded of them what they were? who asked of him also
wherefore he questioned them? mary (quoth he) for if you be honnest men, and
have a care either of your bodies or souls, avoid this house as you would do
poison, least it be the vndoeing of you all, they seeing him of a comely
personage: and that his words tended to some purpose, demanded of him what he
was that gave them such wholesome counsel? I am (quoth he) the master of this
house (if I had my right) but I am bard of the possession and command thereof,
by a deuilish woman, who makes a stews of it to excersice her sinful
practices: so with some other admonishment left the room, when these Barge-men
told mistress Ferneseed what they had heard of her husband, to which she
replied: ha^g him slave and villain: I will before God be revenged of him
(nay ere long) by one means or other, so work, that I will be rid of him,
which making good in the judgment of the Judge, to gather with her life and
practices, she as aforesaid was condemned.

On Monday being the last of February; she had notice given her, that in the
afternoon she must suffer death, and a Preacher commended unto her to
instruct her for her souls health, who labored much with her for the
confession of the fact, which she still obstinately denied, but made great
show of repentance for her life past, so that about two of the clock in the
afternoon she was stripped of her ordinary wearing apparel, and upon her
own smock put a kirtle of Canuasse pitched clean through, over which she did
wear a white sheet, and so was by the keeper delivered to the Shreue, one each
hand a woman leading her, and the Preacher going before her. Being come to the
place of execution, both before and after her fastening to the Stake, with godly
exhortations he admonished her that now in that minute she would confess that
fact for which she was now ready to suffer, which she denying, the reeds were
planted about, unto which fire being given she was presently dead.

FINIS.
