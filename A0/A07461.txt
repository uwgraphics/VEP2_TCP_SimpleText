THE DODECHEDRON OF FORTUNE; OR, THE EXERCISE OF A QVICK WIT.

A Book so rarely and strangely composed, that it gives (after a most
admirable manner) a pleasant and ingenious answer to every demand; the like
whereof has not heretofore been published in our English Tongue. Being first
composed in French by JOHN de MEVM, one of the most worthy and famous Poets of
his time; and dedicated to the French King, CHARLES the fifth, and by him, for
the worth and raritie thereof, very much countenanced, used, and privileged:

And now, for the content of our Contrymen, Englished by Sr. W. B. Knight.

The use of the Book the Preface annexed declares.

THE FRENCH AVTHOR TO THE READER.
THe Curious Superstition of Ancients in old times, desirous with too great
Affectation to know Fortunes and Adventures, caused them to invent and discover
an infinite number, Diversities of diuinations.
or manner, of diuinations, or devises for the same. As some by the four
elements, whereof came the Geomantie, Piromantie, Hidromantie and Areomantie:
Others by Animals, whereof came the Auspices, Augures, and Aruspices: Others by
Idolatrous Sacrifices whereof proceeded the Arioleans, the Pythonisseans,
Sorcerers, Vaticinateurs, false Prophets, and such like: Others have taken
Argument or matter of Diuinatio^ upon the shape or delineaments of man, whereof
proceeded the Physiognomie, Metoscopie, and Chiromancie: others by
Constellation and Superstitious Annotations of Signs, and the houses
Celestial, portending generally thereby things to come; as also particularly
upon the nativity of any person, the course and success of his life; Some
also by numbers, whereof came a sort of Pithagoriques: and some by the Letters
of the Alphabet, or Poetical verses, as the Homeriques and Virgilians: Others
by Figures, Caracters, and Invocation of spirits, as Magicians, Necromancians,
and the Caballe of the Jews. Besides a number of ways and means by men and
evil spirits, the most part of which has been most curiously sought and
published by the Rabelays in his Pantagouelisme. And although that iestingly,
as mockes, he puts them out, yet never thelesse he speaks not without a
purpose and meaning. There is also yet another kind of divination that has
been used, The Antiquity of lots.
and that is by lottes, the which has not been deemed so ill and pernicious,
as those above named. For we may find that some of the ancient fathers did
use to cast lots for the finding out of matters in question and doubt: And it
is also found in the Ancient law, that Iosuah used a lot to discover him that
had broken the Commandment of God, which lot fell upon Acan, who confessed the
fact, and was stoned to death. Likewise Saul used a lot, by the which he knew
that Jonathan his son had made public offense, for the which he would have put
him to death, but the people saved him. The lot also fell on Jonas in flying
from the Lord, who was thrown into the Sea and received by a Whale. And Saint
Matthias was called and Elected by a lot to be an Apostle. And yet
nevertheless, such kind of lots, though the Ancient Fathers used them, is now
iudicially reproved and forbidden by the Canon of the Church, for that it
might in time, grow to superstition, such as that the faithful might err, and
become idolatrous to the breach of the first commandment of God. But now
again to return to our purpose; I find that besides the said diuinations and
lots, the ancients had diverse plays and Inventions of Fortune for recreation
and pleasure, Plays fortune.
more then for any certainty or belief of truth they had in them, the which
were called plays of Hazard and Adventure: as these; The Tessarae, Talorum, or
Taxillorum, Doctohedron and Dodecahedron, the form and fashion of the figure
being sundry according to the diversity of the play: Not only in the form
and squares of the dye, but likewise in the marks thereof. For in some there
was pricks, or points, in other numerall figures, in some letters, and in some
entire words, and celestial Signs. For I have seen the play called the
Dodechedron, marked with the twelve Signs of the Zodiaque, in the throwing
whereof they were persuaded of some truth or certain event to their demand.
But I will not so persuade you. Because it cannot be so, that these sports of
lots, dice, or such like things of chance which we use, can be such or like
those which the ancients used, which they termed Tessara and Talorum,
notwithstanding that the form and figure be the like. And yet I am persuaded
that then with them, if there had not bin more matter of effect then in these
we use, they had not been so curious, nor used them so much. For it is found
writnen in the life of the Emperor Claudius Caesar, that he was so
affectionated thereto, they caused to be made, or himself made a book
thereof. Also Augustus Caesar was blamed for too much spending his time
thereabouts. Plato in his dialogue of the Republique, does there so esteem or
extol his play of Talorum, that he makes comparison of it to the life of
man. Therefore I will not take upon me to show you the manner of Octohedron,
an Dodecahedron as the ancients used them. For I must freely confess unto you,
I am ignorant thereof. But for this play called Dodechedron of fortune, The
Author of the play called Dodechedron.
It is the mere invention of one Master John de Meum, one of the most famous
French Poets of his time, the which he dedicated and presented to King Charles
the fifth then King of France, as I found by an Ancient Superscription in the
book, when first I found it in a library of a friend of mine, who as well for
the antiquity, as the raritie of the same made great account thereof, keeping
it being a written book ever secret to himself, until that overcome by my
request he was content to let it come abroad, and for that we wanted the
knowledge and direction of the die being strange, and the authors direction
therein; we were forced to seek by the frequent communication of many
Doctors, for the use and discovery thereof. The which by the only industrious
labor and learned Search of the worthy Master John Moreau, Signieur of
Monliger, both the use of the dye, and manner of the book was found, as
hereafter. Then first concerning the Author Master John de Meum, it is known
that he was one of the most famous in the practice of the Mathematickes and
Philosophy of his time. And so concerning this his book he has proceeded
therein according to Astrology, dividing the questions into twelve chapters
answerable to the twelve houses celestial, directly observing the properties
and significations of them: for every chapter or rather house, he has
propounded twelve demands or questions. And the book containing twelve
replies or answers to every one, so that the Questions are in all 144. And
the answers are to them in all 1728. If I should hereupon take occasion to
describe unto you the Significations and properties of the celestial houses,
and what planets reigns in them, it would be superfluous, tedious, and
nothing at all fit or appertaining to this Subject. It only a little shall
suffice me to give a taste concerning the twelve houses. And to begin with the
first house which is called Horoscope Angle of the orient Ascendant, does
signify the beginning of life and works. The second Succedent, signifying
goods, traffic, riches, and other things necessary for life. The third is
termed Cadent, of the Ascendent, portending Brothers, Sisters, cosens, kindred,
associates, Judges, prelates, and such like. The fourth is called the Angle of
the earth, and so has his signification to fathers, possessions, houses, hid
Treasures, and things secret. The fifth house Succedent, being good fortune,
signifying sons and daughters, and their inclinations, Ambassadors, Messingers,
and profit to be had by husbandry or land. The sixth house is called Cadent or
evil fortune, noting banishment, servitude, sickness, false accusations, and
false witnesses. The seventh house is the Angle of the Occident, signifying
marriages, quarrels, war and things lost. The eight house Succedent, the house
of death, does signify sorrow, troubles, long torments, poisons, and qualities
of death. The ninth house Cadent of the orient Angle, the house of God, does
signify voiages, nauigations, faith, religion, ceremonies, diuinations,
dreams, prodigies, and presages, of divine punishment. The tenth house called
the heart of the heavens, or the Meridionall Angle, signifies honor,
dignities, government of Kings, and great men. The cleauenth house being
Succedent, Meridionall or the good Angle signifies love, company, good
Adventures, favor, aid, and succors. The twelft and last house, called Cadent
meridionall, or the evil spirit, does signify and denote Enemies, prisonings,
Captiuities, vengeances, treasons, deceauings, horse to sell, and a
consummation of the persons inquired for, which twelve houses the Ancients of
old time compiled together in these verses following, Natus, Vinci, Fratrem,
Filium, Infernus, Vxorem,
Mors, Ambulat, Regnat, Fortuna, Incarceratur.


And thus it appears that the Author has apropriated his questions to the
property and qualities of these houses, the which are very cunningly found by
means of this dye, called Dodecaedron or Dodechedron. By the which in my
judgment this sport is as subtle and ingenious, as the points of the geomancy.
And that you may the better understand the fashion and manner of the dye, it is
a geometrical body, composed of twelve faces, or sides, which are Pentagones
directly equal, for otherwise it would never fall perfect: ^he form ^f the
Die.
the which sides or faces must be joined together close and equally, as in the
Figure following here under appears, the which cut in squares and then joined
together, carrying the one piece to the other, the body, called Dodecaedron or
Dodechedron, will be a geometrical figure, like unto the lesser pieces here
under.



This figure Dodechedron was much celebrated among the Ancients, comparing it
unto the round circle of the world or heavens. For like as in it is contained
twelve Signs, divided in 360. degrees, so this Dodechedron is composed of
twelve faces, Pentagones, every one of which does part or divide it self into
five Isopleures, or triangles. Then those again subdivided into six scalenes,
which are triangles unequal; Added together make just 360. Scalenes. And thus
being performed, this must be observed, for making the numbers on the dye,
which is, that ever the 2. sides opposed contain thirteen together, so that
if the undermost be marked with eight, then the uppermost must be five: if
with nine, then the other with four: if with twelve, then the otherwith one,
and so of the rest.

The order of the play
And now let us begin to show you the order of the play, which will be very
easy to do, if you but observe and mark the directions. Therefore you must
first note that there is twelve leaves, upon the which are twelve chapters
containing the questions which any one may enquire for, being divided into
twelve spaces. Now if you desire to know the answer or fortune of any of the
said questions, then observe precisely in which of the said houses your demand
is in: for every of the said leaves are numbered at the top: then you must
observe which of the spaces you have chosen, for they be numbered in the
margent: then keeping in your memory the said 2. numbers, first of the house,
then of the question; with these two numbers resort to the table, which on the
other side is prepared for that purpose, being square containing twelve
divisions, or spaces both ways, which is 144. spaces in all. Then you shall
find another particular number written, which begins at the upper corner on the
left hand, and goes down thwart to the lower corner on the right hand,
continuing his number to twelve, which are the numbers of the twelve houses. So
that first seek among these numbers the number of the house where your question
was, and there set your finger or mark it well: then remember your second
figure as I told you before, which is the number of the space in the houses
chapter, that your demand is in. And with this begin at your number where
you held your finger, and what number soever it be you must call it one, and
so tell forward the squares toward the right hand, until you have told to the
number of your question, or so many squares, as the number of your question
was; Saying, 1. 2. 3. 4. and so forth, for you know the number of your question
cannot exceed twelve. Now if it chance that the house be in the middle of the
square, as is the figure 6. or 7. and that you have told to the end of the last
Square, you must then go on to the other end of the same space, continuing
your telling until you come to the number of your question, I mean, to tell
so many rooms or squares, as the number of your question was. So that if your
number were the 5. or 6. you must tell 5. or 6 squares from the number,
counting it for one, till you come to your number, and there now again rest
your finger, The use of the dye.
for that you have done with the first square. And now for your chance throw
the dye Dodechedron, and mark truly what number stands uppermost on the dye.
And then in the table where you held your finger, say one, telling downwards
in the spaces, as before you did thwart or sidewaies between the lines, and so
continue telling until you come to the number that was on the dye. And if you
come to the bottom before you have your number, go up to the upper end in the
same space, continuing your telling till you come as is said, to the number on
the die. And there in that square, where your number ends, mark the number or
figures that you find there, for that will be the number of the leaf or
folio, where the answer of your demand stands. And the number that was upon
the die, is the number of the verse in that leaf, which will answer directly
your demand.

As for example.

I have chosen the seventh house which pretends Marriages, and there the
fifth question, which you shall find to be this following.

Whether there be cause of Jealousy or no.

Here now you see as I told you before, the seventh house, and the fifth
questoin. Now go unto your table for the seventh house which you shall find
marked in the square over seauentie nine, and now proceeding sidewaies toward
the right hand, call this Square of 79. but one, then tell 91. for 2. then 103.
for 3. then 115. for 4. then 127. for 5. which is the number of your question.
And now upon this number put your finger, and throw the die Dodechedron, which
chances with eight upon the top. And now again begin at your finger, or
the number 127. descending downwards, telling 127. for 1. then 128. for 2.
then 129. then 130. then 131. then 132. for 6. then being at the last, go up
to the top to 121. for 7. and 122. for 8. which is the number you seek for,
therefore go to the leaf 122. the 8. verse which is there thus.

122 Be not Ielous nor misdoubt not thy wife,
For she shall be true all days of her life.

By this example the rest are easily practiced to answer you truly your
demand. But how direct I cannot say, for the intent is only for pleasure. So
that if by chance it hit right and say true, yet add not the more belief,
for it is impossible but that in so many questions and replies, some must hit.
And if also it be apparent amiss, be not offended, for the intent is only for
pleasure. And concerning the strange words which are at the top of every leaf.
I know not the meaning nor what language they are, having found them in the
first original from the Author, so that I esteem them invented words, rather
then to signify any import. And because I so found them I have set them down,
least any other might perchance find more in them then I can. And so with my
labors for thy pleasure, and my good will to thy acceptance,

Inter Vtrumque, I rest.
The Translator to the Reader.
AS it is easy to imitate: So may the youngest Scholar of good utterance,
deliver the learned Oration, that ever was penned, by the grauest and most
eloquentest Orator. The painter also with small skill may pomeis out his
pattern, to make his picture like the principal. And so may any imbossed
form be cast in a mould, to shape the same as it was from the first hand in
these slights. Some Commendations the doer may deserve: Yet far from the merits
of him, whose learned school was first the author. But as Theseus having
conquered the Minotaur, remained enclosed in a laberinth, and thereby unable to
get out and manifest his victory to the world: So my self having subdued
sloth, by reading, thought my victory to be but vain, unless I could come
forth to encourage others by my success: wherefore with Theseus, I have but
wound up Ariadnes clew or bottom, and so proceeded by the thread, to translate
so near as I could this most pleasant and ingenious work, written first by
Mr. John de Meum a famous French Poet, wishing it had rather bin by some other
then by me perfected, whose learned skill and scope of words, might have
adorned the same, for the more pleasant recreation to the Reader. But because
my intent was no farther then for the pleasure of some my familiar friends, I
only to give them content, have with ordinary phrases performed the translation
the best I could, craving therefore if it wander beyond my expectation, that
then the gentle Reader will excuse me, in my errors, and rather be silent, then
reprochfully reprove me, confessing my ignorance, as also my profession of a
Soldier to be most unfit to perform the same, as it is worthy for the
invention. And thus, friend and unacquainted whosoever, hoping thou will favor
me to my good meaning, I leave my labors, and the sport to thy good liking,
and rest,

Thine W. B.

TO MEN.
CAst forth, my friend, the Dodechedron Dye;
If he hit truth 'twill move thee to delight;
And if it chance that he do tell a lie,
That is the sport, for thee to laugh out right:
For but to sport, and not for truth, 'twas pend
To give content, and no man to offend.
TO BOYS.
YEt wanton Boys, and Lads that do lack grace,
Let them not cast, for all will here be shown;
And what he says, observe them in the face,
By broken brows unhappy boys are known.
But if they mend, the best is to forbear them,
The Dye says so, but only for to fear them.
TO SERVANTS.
ANd Servants that their Masters do abuse,
Let them take heed how here the Dye they throw,
For howsoever they their faults excuse,
This book their priu^e knaueries all does know:
Yet honest servants throw, and greatly care not
What so he says, but cast the Dye and spare not.
TO MAIDS.
ANd pretty Maids, to cast the Dye forbear,
For he will tell all, if you have done amiss,
Your privy loves, with whom, both when, and where:
He Will make it known and if you do but kiss:
Yet blush not gyrles, but cast courageously,
If it chance ill, then swear it is a lie.

7
For war which now is likely to be,
Good men shall endure the most penury.
8
This unlearned ass, is no doctor at all,
And in that art his skill is very small.
9
He is not such as thou do wish and crave,
To bring to pass the thing that thou would have.
10
There is no thing that can turn to thy grace,
But only this a bare and simple place.
11
This nurse I see does please my mind no whit,
Her milk is naught, and so she is unfit.
12
The miser slave, a farthing will not spend,
For fear his goods, should fail before his end.
Abrataym.
1
His own good nature does him still address,
To practice virtue, and such like goodness.
2
By his complexion he does much incline,
To be of good nature, and so most sanguine.
3
Of all his foes he shall see an ill end,
By the good assistance of his true friend.
4
For to obtain it, it shall not be hard.
Yet take heed of falsehood least that all be mard.
5
After long service, thou then shall obtain,
Preferment to honor, and so shall remain.
6
To seem to be precise, is no other thought,
But a forlorn body, cast off to naught.
7
Though that his body, in health do remain,
His spirit endures great torture and pain.
8
Great Princes shall have, by their great alliance,
Th'expulsing of Mars, and his worst defyance.
9
This doctor in Theorique, and practice also,
Is better in proof then outward in show.
10
This messenger shall do all thing at large,
Forgetting of nothing, that is given him in charge.
11
Of wealth and of treasure, there is store of the same,
But look well unto it, you come not to blame.
12
This truly is she for better or worse,
That sure will prove a very good nurse.
Alimicantharat.
1
This nurse is humorous, and so most fantastic,
And thereby her milk, will prove most collerique.
2
He is most inclined, to adventures strange,
And so his estate, to poverty shall change.
3
He shall be outrageous, collericke and whott,
If that by reason, they temper him not.
4
All his enemies are mighty great and strong,
And so his resistance shall bring but more wrong.
5
Thou losest but labor in so thy pretending,
Then some other where, expect a good ending.
6
He cares still more for profit and gain,
Then for honesty or friend, this is most certain.
7
She shall love better as all men may judge,
An honest good man, then a miserly drudge.
8
Marvel not at all, though tariance be long,
For he is detayned, and does thee no wrong.
9
We are in great danger, by sea and by land,
To have great wars, as I understand.
10
As physic unfitting, no health thou shall have,
For he is but a fool, and an ignorant knave.

And therefore thy secrets, see thou do not tell.
12
Forbear thou a little, and be so content,
But make no pursuit, least thou do repent.
Barchutaly.
1
I will ensure thee he is there as yet,
But yet for to see, the time will not fit.
2
This has milk good store, and excellent good,
Thou can choose no better of flesh nor of blood.
3
He lewdly spends all in vices of treachery,
As dicing, and carding, whoring, and lechery.
4
This good inclination, does tend to no ill,
But lends and spends, with mean and good will.
5
By prudence, wisdom, and good discretion,
He shall be secret and of good condition.
6
After thy misery, thy labor, and pain,
Thou shall heap up friends and be well again.

For trouble spoyleth all, and brings our state to wrack.

This man is skillful, most wise and learned,
Sufficient in all, as well may be diserned.
12
He shall full well perform his charge and message,
If he be not surprised in some strait passage.
Abbachin.
1
To do a message discreetly and well,
I will you ensure that he shall excel.
2
There is store of treasure, I know that most true,
But how to find it, I cannot tell you.
3
If of necessity you will have a nurse,
Then pass over this, for you cannot have a worse.
4
He will endeavor all that ever he can,
To purchase the name of an honest man.
5
He shall of himself be ever mutable,
And in both good and ill, prove most variable.
6
Thy magnimious mind armed with patience,
Shall on thy enemies bring destroying vengeance.
7
This doting nidiot by his foolish desert,
Shall of his fair love at all have no part.
8
If otherwise thou do not soon prepare,
Neither honor nor wealth will come to thy share.
9
Thence shall she increase with resolute courage,
To serve God devoutly in honorable marriage.
10
Leave off from seeking to spurn or to kick,
For if death come not, yet is he very sick.
11
The wars are likely to be of such sort,
That the poorest people shall lie in the dirt.
12
By boasting and bragging he thinks for to gain,
With more words then wit, when both are but vain.
Harsebrety.
1
He is advised, grave, modest, and wise.
As is most apparent in all men's eyes.
2
By wise good deseruings and virtuous parts,
He shall gain the love of most peoples hearts.
3
There was treasure hidden as some men do say,
But now by peece-meale it is all stolen away.
4
Margery good cow, neither good nor bad,
A little soap milk, is all may be had.

In cards and in dice, and in playing at tables.

Shall gain him great wealth reputation and love.

In respect of his own most virtuous mind,
All love shall increase and quarrels shall end.

Has won him great credit and eternal fame.

By inclination he shall prove a better dauncer,
Then to art or learning to be an aduancer.
11
As in perfect health he can endure no ill.
But shall have good fortune attend on him still.
12
God shall give us by his omnipotence,
This year plenty if we have patience.
Agrasamal.
1
This year you shall have neither troubles nor war.
But that every one for profit may prepare.
2
This medicine or Physician has no great skill,
Unable to help, but coming to kill.
3
He is sufficient in every part,
And shall end thy business, to thy own heart.
4
There is treasure which seeking may be found,
But it lies hid very deep in the ground.
5
In all men's eyes she does froward appear,
Being rude, foolish, and of no good manner.
6
He shall more willingly his good still spend,
In releeuing the poor then abroad to lend.
7
This party shall do all things at leisure,
But ever addicted to take his own pleasure.
8
By his sweet word and well plast persuasion,
He shall obtain where he has occasion.

Rear up thy spirit, be pleased and so rejoice,
For fate has said thou shall enjoy thy choice.
10
By virtuous labors in very short space,
Thou shall enjoy an honorable place.
11
If that she have vowed for to live chaste,
The end will prove ill, and her promise displast.
12
Whether he be dead or with sickness tormented,
Suppose you the best, and so be contented.
Sortigrat.
1
If that in short space he do not return,
His part is full played, and you may well mourn.
2
It is in war that this must be done,
And then shall last long, I, so it be won.
3
This Doctor is not yet sufficient,
To give a remedy to your patient.
4
This messenger for all his double diligence,
Shall dispatch nothing well, nor of importance.
5
In seeking treasure you lose but your labor.
Like him that would catch a hare with a tabor.
6
This is not of good education.
Seek out another of better fashion.
7
O notorious nigard that to one poor mite,
He shall not employ one penny aright.
8
Let it not displease that by the complexion,
The child shall be of a wild condition.
9
According to thy nature as thou art inclined,
Many brawles and troubles to thee are assigned.
10
Prevent the worst by discretion and wit,
And loose not thy time with a foolish fit.
11
The heart on covetousness is so set,
That all other good it does clean forget.

Patient, mild, and very virtuous.

As best addicted to good huswiferie.

A worthy Prelate shall peace procure.
4
This man has wit good store, knowledge, and science,
Therefore you may boldly make experience.
5
This is a messenger fit for thy matter,
To cogge, to lie, to feign, and to flatter.
6
There is yet good store of treasure and gold,
And therefore to seek it I wish thee be bold.
7
This for this purpose is an excellent nurse.
Refuse her not then, lest thou get a worse.
8
The fruits shall remain and continue still,
Unto the heirs by testament or will.
9
Nature has here all goodness invested,
So that all vice is absolutely detested.
10
Thou may dissemble and curse them in heart,
Yet make a good show for their ill desert.
11
Thy long service shall be well regarded,
And thy honest labors well rewarded.
12
For his being gentle, humble and mild,
Honor shall begin with him, being a child.
Ambyrac.
1
Be sure that fortune now will leave thee,
And of all worldly pleasures eke bereave thee.
2
Get her a husband let her not be a maid,
For of her chastity I am greatly afraid.
3
The party absent, and from you a stranger,
If the beliuing is yet in great danger.
4
There will be wars daily, worse and worse,
Which will cause many their fortunes to curse.
5
He is unwise collericke and not cool,
Rash and a most obstinate lying fool.
6
Live not in hope nor good expectation,
Where there is no sign of good condition.
7
Be not deceived believe me at a word,
There is no thing there hid that's worth a tord.
8
Word to deed you know should be a sister,
Yet all is not gould that fair does glister.
9
He loves better, let be as it will,
To gain it by troubles war or battle.
10
He shall be lean, dry, morfoundue and spare.
Poor, miserable, covetous and bare.
11
By seeking of law quarrels and debate,
Thou shall soon overthrow thy good estate,
12
Thou shall enjoy thy love and sweetest heart,
But take thou heed it turn not to thy smart.
Baugosiach.
1
He shall enjoy his love, with endless glee,
As virtue, honor, wealth, and honesty.
2
His sudden rising high and over all,
Shall twice as swift come to a shameful fall.
3
It is not his kind to be religious;
For being so wanton wild and vicious.
4
He for whom you now enquire is passing well,
Whose happiness is such as none can tell.
5
This year with us all troubles shall surcease,
For our good God has given us that peace.
6
This Physician is very learned and wise,
To show him your disease be not precise.
7
He shall do his message sure and politic,
As one well practisd with that kind of trick.
8
There is treasure store, if it could be found,
But it rests not hidden under the ground.
9
This nurse is good, healthsome and soft as silk,
Her breasts are sweet, and ever full of milk.
10
By vanity and such like worldly pleasure,
He shall consume his stock, his wealth and treasure.
11
He shall be of a good complexion surely,
Yet no way given to love and letcherie.
12
If he have done evil he must amend it.
If he be wronged then God must defend it.
Ambirac.
1
His enemies shall be by him overthrown,
By his secret wisdom to no man known.
2
Of your love and desires within short space,
You shall fully enjoy favor and grace.
3
Dismay not, but make you preparation,
For you shall attain great reputation.
4
It were better a while to let her grow,
Then yet to let her such secrets know.
5
Whether he be alive or dead do not inquire,
But rather get him help, I you require.
6
This year a new quarrel shall breed us war,
Which shall prove pitiful and a bloody iar.
7
He is wise, good, and full of honesty,
Therefore impart to him thy secrecy.
8
He will not perform what now you expect,
But upon purpose he will it neglect.
9
There is treasure, that is sure a plain case,
but where it is hid, I know not the place.
10
To have all things plenty, then stay here,
Go further and fare worse, this case is clear.
11
In all good things his employment shall be,
Guiding all things uprightly with honesty.
12
Healthsome, lusty, and well he shall appear,
But youth shall not last him many a year.
Amsacoriel.
1
He shall not live in health, nor long endure,
With out great care, he is most hard to cure.
2
How good and just soever thy matter be,
The end shall not be pleasing unto thee.
3
She shall love a man, wise, secret, and grave,
That can conceal the thing that he would have.
4
He shall in the end get credit such store,
And have more grace then when he lost it before.
5
Between his outward show and his conscience,
I am sure there is very great difference.
6
Having his ceuratts most gallant in show,
He shall fall dead into a grave most low.
7
The one and the other are most obstinate,
Whereby the people shall be ruinate.
8
If thy disease be costiue and thee offend,
Then take a glister at the lower end.
9
If it be to good I scarsely believe it,
If it be to ill I then dare approve it.
10
In the same place where it is said to be,
Seek and you shall find it, believe you me.
11
Undertake it not this week I you pray.
For the ill season and unsanctified day.
12
Howsoever he grow welthie and rich,
His ill in the end, shall be twice as much.
Aliarsa.
1
Without all doubt most happy thou shall be,
For fortune is resolved to favor thee.
2
Thou shall live long in health, in wealth and ease,
In honor and all things, that may thee please.
3
From these words, how so ever thou take it,
Thou shall not worth a poor dodkin make it.
4
A woman that will be ever taking,
Will surely endure a good fellows shaking.
5
Although in disgrace thou endure wrong,
It shall bring thee credit ere it be long.
6
Believe not his looks, nor yet his smiling,
But shuune thou the snare of his beguiling.
7
He cannot endure the cannon to hear,
It is other delights, his heart much cheer.
8
The cruel war shall cease and have a pause,
by the death of him that first was the cause.
9
Give him no physic, for that is but lost,
He is in good health, therefore save that cost.
10
What ever news about the town they tell,
Assure thy self it is not the Gospel.
11
By art and reason thou well may wind him.
And seeking the house thou there shall find him.
12
If it be a son then to him take heed,
But if a daughter, then have no dreed.
Alibrat.
1
At this same time the child for to assure,
Neither time nor season will it endure.
2
Many a man shall be his adversary,
And also fortune shall be in his contrary.
3
This same child of whom you do enquire,
Shall yet live long but not as you desire.
4
For this matter I dare be bold to say,
With gain thou shall enjoy it every way.
5
You well may cause a tassell gentles flight,
Through glayes and shades, then in a hole to light.
6
Of this disgrace which so much does you pain,
Though you be clear, some taste shall still remain.
7
He is no nouice but well perform can,
By outward show, to seem a holy man.
8
This party is of too noble a race.
Either to give ground or quite the place.
9
This hot war, as now it is intended,
With most great cruelty it shall be ended.
10
If he be not purged well and in have,
His life is gone, and it cannot long last.
11
Be you most sure that be it good or ill,
All is untrue and this approve I will.
12
You may chance herein much for to spend,
Without finding beginning or the end.
Alluata.
1
Search toward th'orient and look well about,
And in an old wall you shall find it out.
2
If he be two year old, then do what you will,
But take you heed that heat do him no ill.
3
Because he is so soft, kind, and affable,
His fortune shall be thereto agreeable.
4
Assure your self of what I now you tell,
He shall live long in perfect health and well.
5
In this thy law and process I suppose,
Thy charges only thou art like to lose.
6
To be ill shapen, and also ill spoken,
Keeps love far off without a better token.
7
This man in spite of all his enemies,
To his former honor again shall rise.
8
Who would believe him to be religious,
Should be devout, and he suspicious.
9
Assuredly he is a great coward,
And fears to put himself in any hasard.
10
Suddenly this war had a beginning,
and as quickly it shall have an ending.
11
He lives most sober and in diet small,
And so shall need no Physic at all.
12
Without some good cause the seed was not sown.
Nor without fire was never smoke known.
Albothon.
1
Do not think that I tell you a fable,
For the news will fall out most veritable.
2
It Is hid deep in the ground in cunning wise,
Just on that side that the sun does rise.
3
If he have good strength to eat and drink,
The worst is surely past, thus do I think.
4
If with reason he will be well guided,
Fortune cannot hurt, it is so provided.
5
He shall live long what soever men saine,
But that shall be with much dolor and pain.
6
The more you venture the more shall be lost,
For naught shall return to answer the cost.
7
Be vigilant and bold spare not to venture,
For never faint heart fair Lady could enter.
8
It never will him so fortunate hit,
That he may return to his sound credit.
9
Whether Physician, Priest, or Surgeon,
It Is not the habit that makes the man.
10
A valiant man can hardly death escape,
If that by battle for honor he gape.
11
By garboile and war people are anoyde,
And all the country is quickly destroyed.
12
Leave for the present, for only by nature,
This diseased will gain both help and cure.
Aldebaram.
1
For to purge the season is not good,
The best is to abstain from too much food.
2
This news very lickly seems to the view,
And by all apparances will be true.
3
Look carefully for so it is assigned,
Where first thou do it look, thou shall it find.
4
The child has sucked enough with reason,
Yet weane him not in summer season.
5
Fortune is so gracious and favorable,
That he shall be sure to be honorable.
6
You shall have long life happy and good,
Without sickness or infected blood.
7
For neither riches goods nor yet land,
Enter not the law at any hand.
8
To have merry days and a good life,
See that thou brall not, nor chide thy wife.
9
The busy body and buzzing fly,
Is soon caught with dishonor to die.
10
It Is a prating groom and full of chat,
like a chattering Iay or a Parrat.
11
With many strokes he shall die and end,
If he be not saved by a friend.
12
In this great war blood garboyle and strife,
One of the captains shall lose his life.
Allelatha.
1
This great war shall soon have a good end,
Although the vilde Pope be an vnfriend.
2
Take now no physic nor let no blood,
Until the sun and moon be good.
3
If that the news continue yet a space,
Then is it true in every case.
4
You shall find it sure without all doubt,
If that by our art you seek it out.
5
Now weane the child if so you do please,
The season is good for health and ease.
6
If thou with discretion do proceed,
Thou shall be happy and never need.
7
By nature he is like to live very long,
If excess he forbear himself to wrong.
8
Of this thy demand I know certain,
Not all but something thou may obtain.
9
Move her with gifts for so do thou well,
The woman that buies will surely sell.
10
He that lewdly spends his first estate,
Does not recover when it is to late.
11
Such as he seems I know him to be,
Neither more nor less but as you see.
12
He is well content to see them square,
But in the fight he will have no share.
Grarayt.
1
He is worthy, valiant, strong, and stout,
And shall be slain in a warlike rout.
2
The wars shall last and endure so long,
Till both repent and see their own wrong.
3
If with speed thou purge not, then be sure,
Thou will be sore sick and past all cure.
4
It is a thing false and so will be found,
Without any truth or perfect ground.
5
Seek while thou will I am of the mind,
That thou shall never any thing find.
6
It is not now good time nor season,
Although I show not here the reason.
7
It is against all sense and nature,
That thou should have now good adventure.
8
He shall die in his flourishing age,
Which does both grief and sorrow presage.
9
Go not to the law I thee advise,
Rather give the one half if thou be wise.
10
Be stout and bold thy self to defend,
And so beware of a fained friend.
11
Basely he has lost his name and honor,
Which by no means he can recover.
12
Trust not this base fainthearted fellow,
For he is unconstant weak and shallow.
Albachin.
1
What so he does is not fained but pure,
He loves the Church, of this I am sure.
2
He shall not die I see by my cunning,
While he is so strong and given to running.
3
A learned Doctor shall deal in this case,
And by his industry conclude a peace.
4
To cure nature of humors repleate,
Of some good Doctor he must take a diet.
5
This your news being good and pleasing,
You may ensure them is no leasing.
6
His labor is vain for getting wealth,
Yet let him be doing, it is good for health.
7
It is time to weane, if female it be,
But if a boy let him suck hardly.
8
Fortune in the end will do thy desire,
Though time do detract as thou do aspire.
9
He is made of strong and good stature,
And shall live by force of his own nature.
10
His plea by proses he shall obtain,
For good counsel shall his cause maintain.
11
Good behavior and words that are mild,
Increases love and makes a woman yield.
12
Honor lost by fortune and mischaunce,
By virtue and wit a man may advance.
Alameache.
1
Let him do the best of his endeavor,
He shall ever live in great dishonor.
2
For all his fair show he is a knave,
Though he seem never so gallant and brave.
3
With weapon in hand he sure shall die,
Urged by others that stand him by.
4
This pretended war howsoever it shows,
Shall never end but by blood and blows.
5
Though thou art sick be yet not dismaide,
Thou needs no Physic, be not affraide.
6
The news is like to prove but a fable,
Invented by some gross dunstable.
7
Although with labor thou do it seek,
Thou shall not obtain as yet this week.
8
Weane not as yet, be not too hasty.
Attend until the child be lusty,
9
If thou take care as it does require,
Fortune shall help thee to thy desire.
10
He is not shaped long life to have,
For pleasure shall speed him to his grave.
11
Thou shall have gain for so I say it,
In spite of those that do denay it.
12
Set not thy love on bribing shifts,
Nor on a man for fained gifts.
Pharay.
1
I know that I am loved truly,
And I resolve to love as duly.
2
By time he shall prove both wise and sage,
And come to be a great personage.
3
Although he seem most holy to be,
He is naught but craft and subtlety.
4
Thou may enter so far by folly led,
To return with thy heels before thy head.
5
Though this garboyle seem not large,
He that is beaten shall pay the charge.
6
If with good guiding thou will take heed,
Of Phisickes help thou have no need.
7
I will believe it if it be good,
If it be naught, then not by the roode.
8
On the left hand toward Occident,
Thou shall find it there incontinent.

And all his other parts are most notable.

This thy dream to me does plainly presage,
Of some of thy near kin a marriage.

This King shall be good and of a great mind,
And to his subjects gentle and kind.

This thy pleasant dream in his right nature,
Does signify some ill and strange adventure.
3
Thou art afraid of treacherous poisoning,
Thy greatest safety is to keep waking.
4
Of this fortune no farther do enquire,
For I can say nothing to thy desire.
5
This witness urged, and rightly understood,
Is like to say ill, but naught to thy good.
6
This woman is not matched very well,
To have any increase, this I can tell.
7
The father knows it best, when all is done,
Whether that or no, it be his own son.
8
He that most his book and learning does ply,
Shall after liuelong and most happily.
9
Fortune can him no way to riches lift,
Because spending he is such an unthrift.
10
You are abused, and therefore now hark,
He shall never attain to be scoller or clarke.
11
If for thy wrongs amends they do offer,
Take my advise, refuse not their proffer.
12
By the dissoluteness of this thy friend,
This your great love shall soon be brought to end.

1
This amity begun while each has breath,
Shall no way be dissolved, but by death.
2
He shall reign and rule in great equity,
And live and die in great felicity.

Who thinks of ill does dream of the same,
For an ill nature is never in good frame.

Thou have too too feminine a faint heart,
That only fear of poisoning does make thee start.

Trouble not your self for the thing gone,
It shall be found out and brought back anon.

This shall tell truth before all be ended.
But some by his words shall be sore offended.

And shall have many children for his desert.

And nothing like the other, negligent.

Thy forward spirit persuades thee of truth,
That thou shall have great riches in thy youth.

He is not overcome that does endure.

1
The time shall fit thee or ere it be long,
To have due revenge of this thy great wrong.
2
This love shall last long without suspicion,
If they can live quiet with discretion.
3
Under his grace and royal majesty,
All his subjects shall live most quietly.
4
This dream which so much does trouble thee still,
Believe, imports neither good nor well.
5
He is subtle, and wise, and knows which way,
To take a good course without all delay.
6
He that cunningly seeks unto the end,
In brief he shall the party easily find.
7
He is crafty I discern by his nose,
And will say little troth as I suppose.
8
They shall have children, for both love letcherie,
And their barnes shall be inclind to treachery.
9
Believe it you may, and be not dismaide,
For all is true the mother has said.
10
The youngest of all, by his judgment sound,
Shall be rich, and gain him ten thousand pound.
11
So soon as thou first do take any pains,
Thy house shall be filled with profit and gains.
12
If he could be brought to follow learning,
It were for him the best and only thing.
Segenon.
1
Cause him to go and learn at grammar school,
For he shall prove a scholar, and no fool.
2
He is arrested upon suspicion,
And again releast on small condition.
3
The femals love is most constant and true,
But his is not such, I dare well tell you.
4
This King shall be served with fear and love,
For so his royal deeds do him approve.
5
As I understand by this lots pretense,
Thou may do thy business with diligence.
6
It is no poison charm or witcherie,
But only a sickness of infirmity.
7
There is no such sport as to hunt and chase,
And follow the game to the end of the race.
8
He shall never be quiet for ought I can see,
Give credit to this, and believe you me.
9
I believe that they both beyond excess,
Are greatly inclind to covetousness.
10
Live he, or die he, take you no great care,
For of all his goods you shall have no share.
11
Seek yet again farther for true it is,
I am not now very well pleased with this.
12
Neither by destiny, virtue, nor art,
Thou shall not obtain of wealth to have part.
Sachaell.
1
He shall have of goods great plenty and store,
Or else this his fortune does lie the more.
2
Every profession that is honest and true,
Shall fit his humor I dare assure you.
3
In brief he is like to be set at large,
By some friends that will undergo the charge.
4
Unto this lover I must give great blame,
For his so too couldly loving the dame.
5
Among his subjects he shall be esteemed,
Because to do well he is not ashamed.
6
Of this presage there is at all no doubt,
But that in the end it will fall well out.
7
He is sick, and no poison does harm him,
Therefore give Physic, and seek not to charm him.
8
It Is better in the air then in the woods to range,
And so will the sport be pleasant and strange.
9
He shall soon again his liberty have,
In spite of his foes that otherwise crave.
10
There is some cause if the woman make stay,
For otherwise there would be no delay.
11
The man that dying will make stay for none,
Is like to go hence by himself alone.
12
He loves thee well, but thou deseruest not all,
Be thou then to him faithful and loyal.
Meleon.
1
In him there is at all no confidence,
Therefore put thou in him no assurance.
2
All that ever by Art he does obtain,
By great folly he spends the same again.
3
Physic is his sole chief delight indeed,
For that is the Science he most does reed.
4
Twill be very hard a way for to find,
To get him liberty, this is my mind.
5
The one does love well, so much I descry,
The other loves too, but it is but to lie.
6
He shall of his Subjects be loved evermore,
Because he increases their treasure and store.
7
I plain perceive, by this present presage,
That it intends thy loss and damage.
8
A preservative you needs must give him,
If you of poison, intend to relieve him.
9
It Is great pleasure in the Forest to see,
The fierce wild bore hunted most gallantly.
10
The contrary party, he is so great,
That hardly he will his liberty get.
11
The husband is wonderfully too hot,
So the wife must stay, till a time may be got.
12
To dispose his gear, it is great reason,
For now to depart, it is almost season.
Segatoy.
1
If he keep himself from excesses fit,
He may live very long and not die yet.
2
The friend that thou did get, and last obtain,
Shall love thee sure best, and be most certain.
3
Such strange adventure shall unto him chance,
As unto great riches shall him advance.
4
His inclination, spirit, and mind,
Is all and only to music inclined.
5
He shall carry himself so well and wisely,
That he shall soon come forth at liberty.
6
These two lovers so far as I can see,
Associate in love and amity.
7
This King the pattern of liberality,
Beloved is of the communaltie.
8
I see that this thy demand does pretend,
Or ere it be long, the death of some friend.
9
Of poison given him he does not dye,
Yet how he came by it, I know not truly.
10
These Damsels desire, no other delight,
Then in the high soaring faulcons flight.
11
A good loving friend, shall him so sustain,
That in the end he shall return again.
12
The damme is dainty, yet it is not her fault,
But her own good man's, if she turn to naught.
Syraboy.
1
He may her well court, and the damsel woo,
The devil a thing, she will let him do.
2
This shall live long in health assuredly,
And then his natural death he shall dye.
3
His love is true, and of honest intent,
Himself zealous and very continent.
4
By a fine wit, slight, cunning, Art, and skill,
Obtain great riches surely he will.
5
He loves Philosophy, and of each thing,
To know the effect, is his studying.
6
He is so hated, as cannot be told,
Which will stick by him, until he be old.
7
The lovers heart is wavering, and does sore,
But she for courage, is a great deal more.
8
His subjects with ease, may ioifully sing,
And every day say God save our good King.
9
Take thou no-pleasure to know the effect,
For of most vile shame, it does thee detect.
10
Some by ill will, has done him so great wrong,
As will be his spoil, and stick by him long.
11
The One and the other are very good sport,
And yet for to hunt is greatest comfort.
12
Alas his days will soon be at an end,
Except God send him the help of a friend.
Castiphon.
1
Finally, he shall yet once again be,
Recalled with credit honorably.
2
Let not the poor man sustain all the blame,
The fault is his good wives, that is his dame.
3
It Is not unlikely, but long he may live.
If he will take as good counsel, as he can give.
4
Thou may love him well, for who can say nay,
But how he loves thee, I nothing can say.
5
He commands fortune, what will you have more,
Fate has ordaind him, great plenty and store.
6
If he were not faint-hearted I could say,
He might prove a Doctor, another day.
7
I am of the mind most assuredly,
That in short space he shall have liberty.
8
The lover is most constant, firm, and true,
But she I know is of another hue.
9
He shall be gracious, and sweet to look on,
And so be beloved of every one.
10
This sign it presageth great joy and glee,
And so a good hour which God send thee.
11
It is not poison, or any such thing,
But wanton lust, which youth does daily sting.
12
It is a pleasure, which I must commend,
To continue a course unto the end.
Segalcitayn.
1
It is a great pleasure to see dogs that be coming,
In a long courss to take a Hare running.
2
As a banished man he may soiourne,
For he is likely never to return.
3
The damme is not blameable I know,
For she has done the duty she does owe,
4
He shall live out well, to natures best course,
And though some live longer, it is the worse.
5
This though he seem very amiable,
Yet shall his love be very mutable.
6
Thou shall have goods store, and great abundance,
By thy good endeavors and providence.
7
Let him study on still, that does not pass,
For all his learning he will prove but an ass.
8
This odd creker, will find out some strange way,
To get himself out, and yet nothing pay.
9
A thousand turns he proves for her sake,
And she full as many does for him make.
10
This King shall be victorious and great,
Which shall his Subjects hearts with joy repleat.
11
What thou have seen is presage of abuse,
Yet with discretion make thereof good use.
12
This troublesome wind, shall soon wear away,
And then thy health shall increase day by day.
Raloytraton.
1
He has eaten or drunk, or done some excess,
Which is the only cause of this sickness.
2
This gentle faulcon has a most brave heart,
It Is a pleasure to see him play his part.
3
Never think nor hope that thou shall him see,
Enjoy and have all his goods quietly.
4
Neither thou nor the other do their best,
Either to receive, or furnish the rest.
5
His vital sprites are cooled all so much,
That death very shortly, his life shall tuch.
6
You must love, if you beloved will be,
Or else your fault each one will easily see.
7
There is no hope of his good luck at all,
Neither by skill or Arts Mecanicall.
8
He shall still employ all his best study,
In the true knowledge of Philosophy.
9
If some other chance, come not of more worth,
It will be this sennight, ere he come forth.
10
Their loves often change of contrary mind,
For she is more variable then the wind.
11
The King is well loved, and of Majesty,
That on his poor Subjects has love and pity.
12
This fearful presage that makes thee so afraid,
Betokens ill hap, yet be not dismaide.
Vernomastricon.
1
Fortune is favoring, and thy good friend,
And this thy presage a bountiful end.
2
Believe me, for all this his extreme fit,
He never drunk poison nor venom yet.
3
In hawks and hounds, is pleasure for a King,
And of all true content, the only thing.
4
I know he shall ere long remitted be,
Or my cunning fails, and I cannot see.
5
She is ready to take, and loath to leave,
And yet for all that, still hard to conceive.
6
He desires life still, if that it might be,
More then his heirs wish him for charity.
7
This good fellow, of whom thou do enquire,
To be honest and faithful, is his desire.
8
Thy luck above others, is far excelling,
So Fortune gives a stately dwelling.
9
He shall have more pleasure in toys and fooling,
Then in good learning, Art, or his schooling.
10
He may come out now, if that so he will,
But time not yet fit, he tarrieth still.
11
They both love truly, and with affection,
It is no show or fained fiction.
12
He shall reign with such justice, and equity,
That his Subjects shall love him entirely.
Frigoua.
1
The common people, shall well love this King,
Because he is good, bounteous and benign.
2
Make thou no great account of this presage,
But trust in God, and in him have courage.
3
This has, or I am much deceived,
Some spiteful hate in his heart conceived.
4
It is a good sight, to see a foul fly,
And make a brave flight, by towering on hye.
5
He is far from any favor obtaining,
For all his cogging, lying, and faining.
6
The one is too cold, the other too hot,
The one is too forward, the other will not.
7
Inquire thou no farther, concerning his life,
For of all his goods, thou shall have no strife.
8
In this thy friend, there is such defect,
That there is not in him, that thou do expect.
9
He shall be poor, and in miserable estate,
And never fortunate, early nor late.
10
He shall follow wars, and a gallant be,
And love to read books of Antiquity.
11
He shall never come out, nor have an end,
Except by the means of some special friend.
12
The Damsel is best, her heart's most sound,
But he is a ranger in every ground.
Lizemidaron.
1
They are both lovers most faithful and true,
And which loves best I cannot well tell you.
2
He shall be well loved of his subjects all,
And so renowned through the universal.
3
In this presage, and in a most good hour,
It does pretend to thee joy and honor.
4
It is not poison that does him disquiet.
But some excess that he has had in diet.
5
If I of pleasures might make my own choice,
Only then hunting should have my whole voice.
6
His friends so steadfast shall to him remain.
That they shall restore his estate again.
7
The wife is ready and apt to conceive,
It Is he that unable does her deceive.
8
He shall by natures course live very long,
If wenching letcherie, do him no wrong.
9
He is of good nature gentle and kind,
And to all men does bear a faithful mind.
10
He shall have fortune in the best degree,
To rise to riches and authority.
11
All sciences that are delectable,
Shall fit him well and prove profitable.
12
This poison seems to me very strange,
To endanger his life, and make such a change.
Symyagele.
1
This prisoner shall soon delivered be,
It Is true that so the book assures me.
2
It is the man as yet I must commend,
Though her constant courage endure to the end.
3
Father of people called he shall be,
For keeping the good of the communaltie.
4
For one presage be thou not yet dismayed,
For in the next there shall some more be said.
5
He has been in some vilde infectious air,
Which makes him look so lean, feeble and bare.
6
Men may go hunt well without any hawk,
To kill foul without dogs is idle talk.
7
He shall by discretion govern so well,
As following he shall get his apeall.
8
If children betwixt them they cannot obtain,

She is yet very honest, but yet as I feel,
She Will learn very soon the trick of the heel.

This is an ill day, and a worser hour,
To lay the ground work of a happy tower.

Are like to a wethercocke in the wind.

Therefore refuse him, another seek.
10
Inquire no further, nor slack thou no time,
For that a good work is always in prime.

I do not expect, nor do not think it,
That he can rise to any great credit.

Among a whole hundred one does not escape,
And therefore I fear, she has some ill hap.

Forsake and leave this world transitory.

And without fear the first foundation lay.

Thou shall obtain even at thy own leisure,
All that thou would, to thy own pleasure.

Take the horse they proffer thee now to sell,
For where there is a better I know not well.

If thou have great friends thou then shall obtain,
For favor not worth does now a days gain.

1
For all his aspiring to mount so hie,
He may chance come down to base beggary.

There thou must also thy last tribute give.

To a good conscience and religion.

To begin thy building if build thou list.
9
He is gentle and of such discretion,
That he is loved of every one.
10

For of a good life, there can come no woe.

Then to be jealous, and get no relief.

There is no doubt, but that heal it will,
But if he lance it, it shall him kill.

Of all the pleasures that a man can prove,
There is not one equal to sweetlipt love.
10
This work does plainly seem finished to be,
But that it was well wrought you may see.
11
This is a Priest that for profit does seek,

12
This noble prelate of whom you enquire,
Is worthy the best seat for his due hire.
Alhanhan.
1
If I should speak truth, and tell the verity,
He is not worthy of such a dignity.
2
He will be a spend all, mark what I say,
He loves to receive but never to pay.
3
This is an ill time that now we are in,
With any great work to mell or begin.

That without some loss thou put off this year.

8
Fate pretends that on the water thou shall dye,
Therefore leave the waters, and walk on the dry.

1
This building has been very well suruaid,
And by a good workman finished and made.
2
He is well worthy of good preferment,
For his living so chaste and continent.
3
He has very good means to render all,
But he will not hear, and his wit is small.

And therefore attempt to do thy wishing.
5
To live well endeavor and do what you can,
And so you shall die a most happy man.
6
Thou have a good fortune now for this yeree,
But for all the rest, it does not appear.
7
Leave thou off this pleasure, for else I am sure,
That it is like with cost long to endure.
8
If this traveler had been discreet and wise,
He had not begun such an enterprise.
9
Upon thy deathbed remember thou may,
That there like a candle thy life must waste.
10
If he be jealous, it is without cause why,
For she ever has lived most honestly.

For this time he shall recover perhaps,
But then let him take heed of the relapse.

Take thy pleasure be merry and quiet,
And above all keep thou a good diet.

Will not have the tenth, but all their whole locks.

And in hours and days a strong influence.

And come to take his leave of us anon.

If he will be ruld with a temperate vain.
2
Of all the games for health that used be,
Shooting is the best and the most comely.
3
Here is great cost in this building within,
And all is lost and scarcely worth a pin.
4
The people may be pleased and content,
To have so good a superintendent.
5
If he take counsel and guide well his geere,
It will be easy to quit him this year.
6
If for thy pleasure thou will ought begin,
This is a fit time which now we are in.
7
If with advice his business he decree,
It may succeed well for ought I can see.

But the recompense shall be the next year.
9
So is thy love in all their hearts planted,
That what thou do sue for shall be granted.
10
This man his business does wisely carry.
And in his doings, he is very wary.
11
When time has wasted what nature has fed,
He then shall yield, and so die in his bed.

For his wife is true and very honest.

If he be ielous, it is then her hell,
For his wife is honest and loves him well.

This sickness so lingering, it will do the deed,
Therefore look to it, for so you had needs.
3
The tenise court, foote-ball, and the wrestling,
Is for young men's health a very good thing.
4
This fair new building, like a painted sheath,
Will soon come to ruin and moulder beneath.
5
This paultrie prelate, unworthy his place,
Were better imployd in some other case.
6
As good acquit them, as call such to law,
That for a man's money cannot give straw.
7
This hour is not good, therefore refuse,
And forbear a while, a better to choose.
8
He is counted happy, and well may swim,
That by good means is held up by the chin.
9
This year shall be ill, unconstant, and strange,
And every moment subject to change.
10
Ask him now any thing what thou think fit,
For sure not denying he shall grant it.
11
It Is a foul voyage, although a fair wind,
That leaves his wife and his children behind.
12
The grave for the quick, it does serve more fit,
Then for the dead that is buried in it.
Fundel.
1

Shall die, and die to live eternally.

And after him too, so shall all the rest.
4
To discourse with maidens it is a pleasure,
Take heed you touch not the box of their treasure.
5
Of this house the ending and situation,
Is far more stately then the foundation.
6
This prelates knauerie may alter the case,
That he may well be thrust out of his place.
7
Although he had wholly the means and power,
Yet would he never do his endeavor.
8
Begin nothing now, but take my counsel,
If that you do mean to have it go well.
9
It Is very hard to know by any skill,
Whether a man's end shall be good or ill.
10
After all thy weary labor and pain,
Fortune shall once make thee happy again.
11
By thy own means thou will not obtain it,
Except some friend do help thee to gain it.
12
This traveler of whom you so enquire,
Shall very soon return as you desire.

1
This traveler, though far he does soiourne,
Yet shall he again most safely return.

And so, much wrong does jealousy ensue.

And the better after in health remain.

So you can forbear to chafe at the same.
6
I can say nothing, for ought that I see,
For I see nothing reproved to be.
7
This party is honest, prudent, and sage,
Yet some at him by spite are in a rage.
8
He shall acquit and clear himself of thrall,
And royally pay his creditours all.
9
Take my advise, do any thing begin,
For the time is good that thou art now in.
10
If thou do persevere in honesty,
Thy life shall be good, and thy end happy.
11
Whether for credit, or profit it be,
This is the year shall do good unto thee.
12
The time is not good by my consent,
Except you mend it by bribe, or present.
Corbaly.
1
If thou do it pursue courageously,
Thou shall it then obtain assuredly.
2
This traveler may well himself beguile,
For he is very like to die in exile.
3
He is like a very strange death to die,
Except fortune alter his destiny.
4
Be not toyous, nor of a iellous mind,
For so thou shall trouble and sorrow find.
5
If that with speed remedy be not had,
He is in danger, and that very bad.
6
To vaut and wrestle, and play at the fence,
Does show a man's courage, valor and fence.
7
As yet where the foundation must be laid,
Is not well guided, nor deep enough made.
8
Let him now dissemble all that he can,
He is fitter for war, then a Churchman.
9
All that he borrowes, whatsoever that he say,
He never will be able again to pay.
10
To enterprise what now thou do intend,
Shall never prosper, beginning nor end.
11
Oftentimes through false treacherous envy,
Men lose their goods and themselves do die.

If that in this, fortune thy turn do serve,
In some other thing, as far she will swerue.

This according to the revolution,
Shall have fortune in good constitution.

He undertakes the journey with ill will,
Which may well prove a cause his life to spill.

For his natural course shall not hold on.
5
Be not ielous, but by plain proof truly,
For else the whole shame shall redownd to thee.
6
He shall recover though it a while stay,
And physic must be his readiest way.
7
Those of the best nature and swetest mind,
Are ever the most to music inclinde.
8
This work thus ended as now it is begun,
Will be rich and stately to look upon.
9
Here Is want of no wit, or weakness of mind,
But all for the worst, being so inclinde.
10
He shall pay all without molestation,
And live with the rest in good reputation.
11
This is a good time for any to prove,
For working effect, if they be in love.
12
Intend well and do well, then good shall be,
Or else my judgment deceives me.
Estiel.
1
Love to do good, to virtue be friend,
So shall thou live well, and make a good end.
2
The more thou takes care thy fortune to know,
The more she is cross, and often proves slow.
3
Be bold to attempt and make thy request,
And all shall fall out to thee for the best.
4
This traveler, he shall be so frugall,
That with content, return again he shall.
5
Leave worldly care, and covetousness fly,
Least thou leave all, and so suddenly die.
6
Be not so ielous to give thy wife blame,
Least that in the end thou do reap the shame.
7
Never expect thou long to abide it,
Except wisely thou do better guide it.
8
At dice and at cards a gamester to be,
Is fit for fools that are of no degree.
9
This work is well wrought, and with great cunning.
And so is like to prove very lasting.
10
This man is learned and of great prudence,
Bearing in all things a good conscience.
11
Though he absent himself, yet he will pay,
And only a little time you must stay.
12
If that with reason entreat thee I may,
Then I advise thee, keep thy house this day.
Ramuel.
1
The thing of which you so much do enquire,
Will never be finished to your desire.
2
This man's hated, wherefore I cannot tell,
But I know that ill will never spoke well.
3
What you expect you shall obatine and get,
By a happy hour that shall perform it.
4
Let him do his best, and go where he will,
He shall be sure to be talked on still.
5
Make him a cobbler, or carrier of packes,
For you may work him as if it were wax.
6
By his melancolly sadness and cold,
He shall soon grow gray and seem very old.
7
He shall look more, to get riches and gould,
Then in the wars honor a thousand fould.
8
This diseased shall pine do what you can,
And till the spring be a very sick man.
9
In stead of employment, give him a bell,
For he can neither speak, nor tell message well.
10
His intent is good, what he does pretend,
And being followed, shall have a good end.
11
This is a good priest for tables or lurch,
More fitter for the pot, then for the Church.
12
He is generally ill beloved of all,
For being a miser, and had withal.
(...) Amanlis.
1
The thing thou now do in thy heart pretend,
Do follow, for it shall have a good end.

He shall be provident for night and day,
If voluptuousnes bring him not astray.

Above the most men and in general,
He shall be courteous, wise, and liberal.

This enterprise good, it shall not go wrong,
But have a good end though that it be long.
5
For special good all men approve him,
And as he is, so do all men love him.
6
He may be happy, for what he does crave,
So fortune allotteth that he shall have.
7
Go to the court is best if thou intend,
In any good sort thy business to end.
8
In time you shall him a great grand panch see,
And so fit an Abbey lubber to be.
9
He shall have no let but well he may live,
So long as his Nature will vigor give.
10
He shall be forward and of a good sprite
And all but only for a carpet knight.
11
For health Doctor Diet is your best cure,
And by Doctor Quiet you shall be sure.
12
He is of himself, mild, gentle and good,
Except with anger they make him stark wood.
Alpharis.
1
I ensure thee this messenger is wise,
No bragging prater or forger of lies.

If thou have hope of thy fute to be sped,
Then take good advice and run not on head.
3
His government shall be upright and true,
God grant with us he may long continue.
4
He shall be sparing yet not very scant,
But only frugall to keep away want.
5
This business by good friends and industry,
May end very well and prosperously.
6
Through faults the world does so much detect him,
That no honest mind can well affect him.
7
It were a great folly to hope too much,
Then let it suffice, the matter is such.
8
It is only the wars that must grace thee,
For all the residue will deface the.
9
It is contrary to his complexion,
To rest and live in contemplation.
10
By his own procure, his life it shall end,
In some great fault he justice shall offend.
11
He shall not the wars, or garboiles require,
But to live quiet shall be his desire.
12
If he take not courage and a good heart,
It will be long or ere this sickness part.
Berhardus.
1
Whatsoever remedy may be had,
This sickness will be long, grievous, and bad.
2
Mistrust him not this messenger is true,
And the fittest man could hap to you.
3
Thy enterprise is virtuous and stable,
Therefore it shall have an end profitable.
4
His honest virtuous life it shall be such,
As he shall prosper and grow very rich.
5
He shall wast much, and yet rest with content,
For that he spends shall be honestly spent.
6
Leave off to desire, for it will not be,
Nor yet come to good, I assure thee.
7
By loving well, love is gotten with gain,
And by doing well, men happy remain.
8
The thing you expect, though long yet at last,
You shall enjoy part, so hope well thou may.
9
There is in this man no sign of virtue,
And therefore no credit to him is due.
10
With all the ill conditions thou see,
He were very fit to be made a Priest.
11
Take heed of wenching for that is the thing,
That most shall hinder, and thy conscience sting.
12
As it is expected, so he shall be,
Full of great valor and actiuitie.
Alachid.
1
This child if it have good education,
Will come to be of good reputation.
2
Though that this sickness be grievous and strong,
Assure you your self it shall not last long.
3
I insure you this is a very knave,
Therefore let him with you no credit have.
4
You are very venturous, yet take good heed,
Lest that you chance make more have then good speed.
5
A better government there could not be,
If he did not covet all he does see.
6
Of his friends he will get but a small share,
And yet of his friends he shall make no spare.
7
If the builder live, the building shall be
Performed to an end, most gallantly.
8
Be wary and watch well thy own affairs,
For it is not like to pass without some cares.
9
The thoughts of an ass, and a foolish mind,
Are well as constant as the wavering wind.
10
Stay not at home, but like a lusty blood,
Venture abroad, for that must do thee good.
11
And if that he a Churchman should be made,
He would soon cast his gown for a new trade.
12
By time, man's time grows short, and so away,
In time then think how thou may live for aye.
Map.
1
By daily excess thy life thou do spend,
and by it do hasten thee to thy end.
2
Make him rather priest then a man of war,
For he can better sing, then fight by far.
3
Take heed of all things, and tell not a lie,
For that will live ever and never die.
4
This for money is a covetous wretch,
But honestly to live he cares not much.
5
Follow thy purpose, with might and with maine.
And it shall end to thy profit and gain.
6
He shall never his office well perform,
Except from his covetousness he turn.
7
He shall be near and in devotion so could,
That he shall honor no God but his gould.
8
Begin and try your conclusion,
It shall never be but a confusion.
9
Thou art so teastie, and captious beside,
That all do hate thee, none can thee abide.
10
His hope shall be hopeless, thus much I know,
For hope is a fancy, that often breeds woe.
11
Let him spend his time and go where he will,
He Will get no credit, but be a fool still.
12
Let him be sexstone, or clarke at the most,
For he would make but a very bad priest.
Albothon.
1
The world is his God, and Gold his Mammon,
Which he loves better then all Religion.
2
Covetousness will be thy utter fall,
And so soon procure thee ruin of all.
3
Now in his youth you may plainly observe,
That in the wars, he shall gallantly serve.
4
If he be young, the disease man soon mend,
If he old, 'twill languish to the end.
5
He is a messenger loyal and true,
Yet something fantastic, I may tell you.
6
Begin thy suite, and follow it with speed,
For that thou shall have it, it is decreed.
7
If wisely thou govern thy words and ways,
Thou will then get good friends at all assayes.
8
Let him alone, for so he will spend it,
Always to spare somewhat as God does send it.
9
This building very soon shall finished be,
To the owners great praise, as you shall see.
10
Thou art beloved of great and small,
And very well commended of them all.
11
Hope well and have well, for so it shall be,
And what thou hopest for shall be given thee.
12
It Is not likely that good should him betide,
That dare not venture from his fire side.
Ossturies.
1
Let him wander South and North, East and West,
He shall be but a beggar at the best.
2
This shall love better a booty to seek,
Then either to learn good Latin or Greek.
3
It Is surely wrough, ttherefore we have no need,
To make more have then will well prove good speed.
4
He shall be a man exceeding so far,
That none shall surpass him in feats of war.
5
This sickness whereof resolved you would be,
Is like for to prove a long malady.
6
This messenger bears a good honest face,
Yet take good heed he do you no disgrace.
7
Take now my counsel to leave and desist,
Least thou do repent thee, with had I wist.
8
This is a proud prelate most special,
And as well learned as none of them all.
9
If he had thousands it were to no end,
For all he can get, he does idly spend.
10
This longsome work as thou do it pretend,
Is not likely yet to come to an end.
11
Thou will be so busy that in the end,
Thou shall turn thy friends to be thy vnfriend.
12
Thou shall frustrate of thy desires remain,
Yet a good recompense thou shall obtain.
Albeda.
1
If with labor he prease among the throng,
He shall get what hope has promised him long.
2
At home and abroad, by sea and by land,
He shall still get credit, and great command.
3
Though he be untoward, and of ill birth,
Yet he will be learned and of very good worth.
4
He shall kill himself laboring like a horse,
For he wants wit and of himself remorse.
5
This skip-iacke is far better made to dance,
Then to lead a battle in Spain or France.
6
If that they do mean his health to procure,
Himself must then speedy physic endure.
7
This is a good honest, and a true fellow,
And in diligence quick as a swallow.
8
Pursue thy best, it shall succeed thee well,
For fortune will help thee, this I can tell.
9
He would command well, and govern aright,
And 'twere not for hugging with Venus all night.
10
Of that he has he spares not at all,
But with great bounty is most liberal.
11
This thing may yet very well ended be,
By care, diligence, and good industry.
12
His friends are not from him so far exiled,
But if he please, they may be reconciled.
Amalia.
1
Thy greatest vnfriend that thou have this day,
Is thy nearest allied, mark what I say.
2
Now that I must end toward my farewell,
Thou shall have thy wish, accept what I tell.
3
Seek credit or honor far from this place,
For in thy country thou never shall get grace.
4
This younglings manners does so well grace him,
That it were pity at all to deface him.
5
He that lives uprightly and does God fear,
Need not for deaths coming take any care.
6
He is inclined as well you may see,
A cogger and a true coward to be.
7
This sickness to mend, take help of the Cook,
For so I do find in the end of my Book.
8
This messenger being the last of all,
Shall prove most true and very loyal.
9
For this enterprise I stand in great doubt,
'Twill have hard success before the end come out.
10
If wisely he bear himself in this case,
It will fall out to his credit and grace.
11
He is more liberal then fits his degree,
Since he is come of years his own man to be.
12
Behold with labor my book ends you see,
And so must you labor else 'twill not be.
FINIS.
