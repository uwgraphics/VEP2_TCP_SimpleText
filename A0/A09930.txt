In the name of Almighty God.
Gracious Lord God and most merciful father, I humbly beseech thee in Jesus
Christ thy dear sons name, and for his sake, to strike continually,
unfeigned reverence, and humble fear of thy Majesty into my heart, that the
prayers which I shall offer up unto thee at this time, or at any other time
hereafter, may proceed from an earnest mind: To this end I pray thee, not
only to be present with me by thy holy spirit, but also thee only to prepare
my heart unto prayer, and to teach me to pray a right. Lord remove far from
me, all idle discourses, and wandering imaginations: and grant me grace, O
Lord, not only to shake of the heaviness and dullness which hangs upon this
my flesh, but give me in steed thereof all spiritual liveliness and
readiness, that both with the heart and mouth I may power forth in thy
presence, such earnest, hearty, and unfeigned supplications, as for Jesus
Christ thy sons sake, may be accepted and regarded before thee. Indeed Lord I
confess, that if I should one the one side consider mine own sin,
wretchedness, and poverty: and on the other side respect the fullness and
excellency of glory, power, might, and majesty, which is in thee, I might
justly be discouraged from appearing in thy sight, or calling upon thy name:
The comforts and encouragements which thou have given me in thy holy word are
these: Thou do not only command me to call upon thee, but have bound thy
self unto me in the truth of thy promises, that thou will hear my prayers,
and grant my requests, yea that my faith might be the more confirmed and
strengthened in the certainty thereof, thou have ratified and sealed the same
by the death and bloudshedding of thy son Jesus, in whom all thy promises
are yea and Amen. In full and assured confidence whereof, I do with all
boldness and humility present my self before thee at this time, praying thee
to cover and bury in perpetual forgetfulness, all my iniquities, to supply
all my wants and imperfections: and because thou can not at any hand abide
hypocrisse: so to syft and try my very heart and raines, that I may be thy
special goodness and assistance, be always found sincere and round hearted in
thy presence, endeavoring ever through thy strength, to fight against, and to
be free from cloaking of my sin with hypocrites, or excusing of my sin
with Adam and Eua my first parents: but that I may unfeignedly, and from the
bottom of my heart, confess my sins, with thy holy servants David, Paul, and
many other thy dear children, and weep bitterly for them as did Peter, for
if we confess our sins, thou art faithful and just to forgive us our
sins, and wilt cleanse us from all iniquity. O Lord there are an infinite
multitude of sins, which I poor and miserable wretch have without ceasing
committed against thee: many are hid from my self, because I remember them
not, but are yet notwithstanding present and naked before thine eyes: touching
these, I pray with thy servant David; Cleanse me O Lord from secret faults,
and keep thy servant from presumptuous sins. An innumerable heap of others,
many times I feel in my self, and my conscience often accuses me of as great
faintnes, coldness, and unwillingness to prayer, wonderful weakness in faith,
over much love of the world, a greedy desire to satisfy mine own vile, and
carnal affections, licentiousnes in vain and foolish speeches, my heart
fraught almost full with hypocrisy, vain glory, and I my self given to
inconstancy, carelessness, and slacknesse, in turning by repentance to thy
majesty, and very much neglecting my duty toward my house and family. I
feel also in my self, a wonderful want of earnest zeal and sincere love
toward thy majesty, which should consumethe devilish delights, and vile
vanities of this present evil world: and in thee and for thee, the lack of
bowels and charitable compassion toward my brethren, whose miseries do not
lively touch me, and whom I cannot easily forgive, if they do offend me: yea
in one word, to confess all my whole man, both inward and outward, is a very
huge lump of horrible corruption, the soul and the body, yea every part and
piece of the same, both inward and outward, have most vngratiouslie broken thy
holy precepts and commandments, so that in respect hereof, condemnation is
due unto me: the comfort I have is this, that thou have in the abundant riches
of thy mercies, given thy dear son to die for all my sins, and to rise for
my full righteousness: for whose sake Lord I beseech thee, to pardon all my
sins whatsoever, and to make his death and resurrection so effectual in me,
that I may daily die to sin, and live to righteousness: that by the working
of thy holy spirit, I may fight against and over come all the former evils, and
be strengthened and enabled to the contrary good things, that weakness of
faith may be turned into stedfastnes and strength of belief, that the love of
this life being shaken off, I may earnestly thirst and breath after eternal
glory, that I may renounce mine own will as vile and wicked, and be wholly
given over to the obedience of thy most blessed will, that all idle and
unprofitable speeches may be avoided, and my words so powdered with Salt, as
may bring grace and edification to the hearers, that ficklenes of mind being
removed, I may be stayed and steadfast in all goodness and well doing, that all
backwardnes and slothfulnes in turning to thy Majesty, and negligence in
caring for those whom thou have committed unto me, being utterly shaken of, I
may thankfully accept, and rightly use this time of gracious visitation, which
thou offerest unto me, both of repentance to my self, and also of knowledge of
duty toward other, carefully indeuouring to bring up those, whom thou have
committed unto me in thy nurture and fear, having always a diligent and
watchful eye over them, both for the increase of their knowledge, and also for
the yielding and showing forth of the fruits of holy conversation. Work in
me O Lord, with continuance and increase, an earnest zeal toward thy truth
and religion, and unfeigned love toward thy majesty, and an upright affection
toward the brethren. Lord let their miseries pearse me as mine own, make me
ready to succor and comfort them with all the means that thou have bestowed
upon me, that I may not only with good countenances testify my good will,
and with joyful words make their heavy hearts glad, but also be liberal
handed toward them, according to the great measure of graces that thou have
bestowed upon me, even to that end and purpose. And because without brotherly
reconciliation, neither I nor any thing which comes from me, can be agreeable
in thy sight: I do most humbly pray thee, to make me ready and willing
unfeignedly, and from the very bottom of my heart, to forgive those that any
manner of way have trespassed against me, as I would gladly obtain pardon and
forgiveness of all my sins at thy merciful hands. Lastly that it would please
thee of thy great goodness and mercy, to turn away mine eyes from beholding
vanity, my tongue from speaking foolishlie or unadvisedly, my heart from
imagining mischief, my feet from running to do that which is evil: yea so
guide and govern (good Lord) every part and member both of my body and of my
mind, that as thou have created both: so I may in both, set forth thy glory
and praise, in the midst of a froward and crooked generation. And because (O
Lord) I know nothing of my self, for my ignorant heart is full of darkness, I
most humbly beseech thee, first to aid me by thy grace, that I be not puffed
up in the heyght of mine own imagination, to flatter my self that I know
much, when as indeed I know very little or nothing at all: Next, so direct me,
that I may without wearisomnes, use all the holy means that thou have
sanctified in thy blessed word, for my grouth and continuance in steadfast
faith, in spiritual knowledge, and sinceare obedience, that my darkness may be
turned into light, and my ignorance into knowledge, that I may daily learn in
every respect, truly to humble and throw down my self before the presence of
thy majesty, in regard of whom, not only I, but all the creatures in the
world, are but vile dust and ashes. I have not O Lord any good thing in my
self, for I am not sufficient of my self, as of my self to think a good
thought, much less so do any good thing which is acceptable in thy godly
sight. Give me grace good Lord, not to bury this knowledge, but continually
to remember it, that it may stand me in stead of a strong and necessary
weapon, to beat down and overthrow the height and pride which abides in this
my flesh: yea Lord, I further confess, that so vile is the filthiness of mine
own nature, that these good things which I daily and hourelie receive at thy
merciful hands of thy goodness only, without any merit or desert of mine at
all, I do many times, most wickedly profane and abuse, but I pray thee give
me grace, more heedelie and carefully to look to my walking in this and other
respects, thou heretofore I have done, that these good and gracious gifts
which thou in love do continually power forth upon me, may not be
testimonies of judgment against me, but assured pledges of thy love toward
me: and certain seals of fruitful obedience in me toward thy majesty,
Grant me grace (O dear father) to consider of thy unspeakable blessings, and
innumerable benefits bestowed upon me, thou have never been weary in keeping
defending, and providing for me, from the very time of my conception, until
this present hour, thou have bestowed upon me large gifts which I never either
labored for or thought of, yea such a huge heap of benefits have I received
from thy merciful hands, as all the days and times of my life, are not
sufficient enough to think upon them, much less to be thankful unto thee for
them, in such sort and duty as I ought, besides infinite bodelie blessings, as
health, wealth, liberty, and many other such like. Thou have freely bestowed
upon me inward and spiritual graces, for of thine own mercy thou have chosen
me to life everlasting, before the foundations of the world were laid: and for
a sure pledge of the same in my conscience, thou have redeemed me by the blood
of thy dear son, and have made mine election sure by an effectual calling,
in that of thine own good will, then have begotten me unto thy self by the
word of truth, thou have taken me out of the power of satan, and translated me
into the kingdom of thy dear son in light, and made me a partaker of his
mystical body with the saints, that I may enjoy his presence for ever.
Touching which, and all other graces of thine so plentifully powered forth
upon me, I say with thy servant James, that I am not worthy of the least of
all these thy mercies: yea so much the more unworthy am I of them, or any of
them, because that though thou in the riches of thy goodness never ceasest to
heap up continually new benefits and blessings upon me, I am
notwithstanding, a most vile wretch and miserable sinner, have little or no
care at all in offending thy majesty in mine old sins, yea many times in
multiplying new iniquities against thee: but circumcise my heart good Lord I
pray thee, and turn the affections thereof to newnes of life, and holiness of
conversation, that that heart which now is so hard and stony, that it will not
be peirced with the considerations and remembrances of thy manifold graces, may
by the mighty working of thy blessed spirit, be softened and enlarged, that I
may deeply consider of thy mercies, and that my mouth which is greatly
stopped up through sin and iniquity, may of thy gracious goodness be now at
the length opened, and I both secretly and openly speak forth thy praises.

Lord keep me far from murmuring, grudging, or repining at any of thy
gracious and loving corrections, whether it be that thou withdraw from me any
of these temporal blessings and benefits, which most favorably thou have
bestowed upon me, or otherwise shall chastise me for the punishment of my
sin, for the trial of my faith, for the manifestation of thy power and
goodness, or for any other cause best known unto thy heavenly wisdom. Thou
know O Lord what is better for me then I my self, and therefore good cause
have I in all willingness, to subject my self under thy mighty hand, that at
the length I may be truly exalted. Grant me grace therefore O dear father,
in all time of afflictions, patience to possess my soul, and to refer all
calamities to the right end: that is, that by them I might be brought to be
more near unto thee, and so learn to keep thy commandments, and according
to thy promise made in thy holy word: so I humbly beseech thee, in the
midst make a way out for me to escape, as may be most for thine own glory,
and mine eternal comfort at the last, through Jesus Christ thy son, my Lord
and only Savior, in whose name, and for whose sake, I humbly crave at thy
merciful hands, these and all other things necessary for me, concluding with
that prayer that he himself has made, saying: O our Father, etc.
