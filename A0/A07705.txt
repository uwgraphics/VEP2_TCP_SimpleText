A merry gest how a sergeau^t woldel erne to be a frete:


Wise men always
Afferme and say / ye best is
For a dylygently (man
For to apply / ye besynes
yt he and in no wise (can
To enterprise / an other faculte
For he that will
And can no skyll / is never like to the
He that has lafte
The hosiers craft and falls to maky^ge
The smythe that shall (shone
To pa^ty^ge fall his thryfte is welhygh
A black draper (done
With wit yaper / to go to wryty^ge stole
An old butler
Betu^ a cutler / I wene shall prove afole
In old trot
That good ca^ not / but ever kiss ye cup
With her pbysyke
Will keep oneseke / till she have soued him up
A man of law
That never saw / the ways to by and sell
wenynge to arise
By marchaundyse / I pray god spe de him well
A merchant cke
That will good seek / by all the means he may
To fall in suit
Till he dyspute / his monay clean away
Pletynge the law
For every straw / shall prove a thryfty man
with bate and strife
But by my life / I can not tell you when
when an hatter
will go smater In philosophy
Or a pedlat
wax a medlar / in theolegy
All that ense we
Such crafts ne we / they drive so fere a cast
That ever more
They do there fore / boshre we them self at last
This thing was cried
And vere tied / here by a sergeaunt late
That tyfely was
Or he could pas / rapped about the pate
While that he would
Se how he could / in goddes'name play ye friar
Now if you will
Know how hit fill / Take heed and ye shall here
It happed so
Not long ago / a thryfty man dyede
An hundred pound
Of nobles round that had he laid a side
His sone he would
Should have this gold / for to begyne with all
But to suffyce
His child well thryes / ye monay were to small!
yet or this day
I have held say / that many a man certesse
Has with good cast
Be rich at last / That has begone, with less
But this young man
So well he can his monaye to Imploye
That certainly
His po^cy / role hit was a Joy
For lest lum blaste
Might over cast / his ship or by myschaunce
Men with some wyle
Might him begyle / and mynysshe his substance
For to put out
All manner doubt / he made a good putauye
For every why^
Of his own wit / and took other way
(...)te tayre and well
A great dele / he dyghthyt in a pot
But tenh him thought
That was naught / and there he left hit not
So was he feign
From thens again / to put hit in a cup
And by and by
Couetously / he supped hytfayre up
In his own breast
He thought hit best / his monaye to enclose
Then wist he well
what ever fell he could hit never lose
He porowed than
Of a another man / monaye and matchaundyse
Never paid hit
Up he laid hit / in like manner wise
yet on the get
That he would were / he rought not what he
So hit were nyce (spente
As for the price / could him not myscontente
With lusty sport
And with resorce / of ioly company
In myrthe and play
Full many a day / he lived merely
And men had sworn
Some man is borne / to have a goodly flower
And so was he
For such degree / he gate and such honor
That with out doubt
When he went out / a sergaunt well and fair
was ready strayte
On him to wait / as sown as on the mayre
But he doubtless
Of his mekenes / hated such pomp and pride
And would not go
Compnyed so / but drew him self a syde^
To saint Katheryne
Straight as a line / he gate him at a tide
For promocyon
Or promocyon / there would he needs abide
There spence he fast
Till all was past / and to him rame there many
To ask their det
But non could get / the valor of a penny
With vysage stout
He bare hit out / unto the hard hedge
A month or twain
Till he was tayne to lay his gown to pledge
Than was he there
In groter fere / then or that he came thither
And would as feign
De part again / but that he wist not whyther
Than after this
To a trende of his / he went and there abode
Where as he lay
So syke al way / he might not come abroad
Hit happed than
A merchant man / that he ought monaye to
Of an offycere
Than began inquire / what him was best to do
And he answerde
Be not a ferde / take an accyon therefore
I you beheste
I shall him rest / and than care for no more
I fere quod he
Hit will not be / for he will not com out
The sergeaunt said
Be not afraid / hit shall be brought about
In many a game
Like to the same have I been well in ure
And for your sake
Let me be bake / but if I do this cure
Thus part they both
And to him goth / a pace this offycere
And for a day
All his array / he changed with a friar
So was he vyght
That no man might / him for a friar deny
He dopped and doked
He spoke and looked / so rely gyously
Yet in a glass
Or he would pass / he to ted and he peted
His heart for pride
Lepte in his side / to se how well he frered
Than forth a pace
Unto the place / he goes in gods name
To do this deed
But now take heed / for here begy^neth ye game
He drew hy nigh
And softly / at the door he knocked
A damoysell
That herd him well / came and it un locked
The friar said
God speed fair maid / here lodget such a man
It is told me
Well sir quod she / and if he do what than
Quod he maystresse
No harm doublesse / hit longethe for our order
To hurt no man
But as we can / every wight to fordre
With him truly
Feign speak would I / sir quod she by my faye
He is so syke
ye be not like / to speak with him to day
Quod he fair may.
yet I you pray / this much at my despre
vouche safe to do
As to go him to / and say an austen friar
molde with him speak
And matters break / for his avail certyne
Quod he I will
Sto^de ye here still / till I come down again
Up is she go
And told him so / as she wis bode to say
He mystrystynge
No manner thing / said maiden go they way
And fetch him hyder
That we together / may talk adowne she goth
And up she brought
No harm she thought / but it made some folk
But this offycere (wroth
This feigned friar / when he was come alofte
He dopped than
And great this man / relygyously and often
And he again
Right glad and feign / took hy^ there by ye shoude
The friar than said
ye be dysmayde / hith trouble I understand
In deed quod he
Hit has with me ben better than hit is
Sir quod the friar
Be of good chere / yet shall hit after this
For crystes sake
Look that you take / no thought in your breast
God may turn all
And so he shall / I trust unto the best
But I would now
Lomyn with you, in counsel if you please
Or else not
Of matters that / shall set your heart at ease
Down went the maid
The merchant said / Now say on gentle friar
Of all this tydynge
That ye me bring / I long full sore to here
When there was none
But they alone / the frete with evil grace
Said I rest the
Come on with me / and out he took his mace
Thou shalt obaye
Come on thy way / I have the^ in my cloche
Thou go not hense
For all the pense / the mayre has in his pouche
This merchant there
For wrath and fete / waxed welnyghe wode
Said horsone thief
With a maschete / who has caught the good
And with his fyste
Upon the list / he gave him such a blow
That bacwarde down
Almost in sown / the friar is over throw
yet was this man
Well ferder than / lest he the friar had slain
Till with good rappes
And heavy clappes / he dawde him up again
The friar took heart
And up he stette / and well he laid about
And so there goth
Between them both / many aluity cloute
They rence and tere
Each other here / and claue together fast
Till with luggynge
Halynge and iugynge / they fell down both at last
That on the ground
Together round / with many asdde stroke
The roll and rumble
They turn and cumble / like pigs in a poke
So long above
They heue and shoue / together that at the last
They maid the wife
To break the strife / hyed them upward fast
And when they se
They captayues lie / walrtynge on the place
T(...)p (...)ode
They pulled a good: adoune about this face
while he was blind
The wenche behind / lent him on the flore
Many a Jolle
About the noise / with a great batyll door
The wife came yet
And with her fete / she help to keep him down
And with her rock
Many a knock she gave him on the crown
They laid his mace
About his fuce / that he was wode for pain
The friar frappe
Gate many a swappe / till he was fall nyghe slain
Up they hymlyfte
And with evil thryfte / hedlynge all the stayre
Down they him threw
And said a dew / command us to the mayre
The friar arose
But I suppose / amassed was his head
He shoke his eres
And from great feres / he thought him well a flede
Quod he now lost
Is all this cost / we be never the nere
ill morche the
That caused me / to make my self a friar
Now masters all
And now I shall / end there I began
In any wise
I would auyse / and counseyll every man
His own crafe use
All new refuse / and utterly let them gone
Play not the friar
Now make good there / and welcome euey chone
