CANTVS. Primus. The first set OF ENGLISH Madrigalls, to 4. 5. and 6. voices.

LONDON Printed by Thomas Este dwelling in aldersgate street. 1597.

To the virtuous, and very worthy Gentlewomen, Mistress Anne: and Mistress
Frauncis Iermin, daughters to the right worshipful, Sir Robert Iermin Knight,
(his very good Master) G. K. wishes in this life, increase of all virtues,
and in the life to come, the full fruition of all happiness.
IT were a thing very unnecessary (thrice worthy and virtuous gentlewomen) for
me (although I were able) to speak any thing in commendation and praise of
Music, considering (besides that many learned men have learnedly written in
commendation thereof) the examples of times past, and our own experience every
day, does give sufficient testimony both of the pleasure and proffit that it
brings to a distressed and melancholy mind. Also I think it convenient not to
answer (otherwise then with silence) to those (more senseless then brute
beasts) that with open mouths do in-veigh, and speak all the evil they can
against that excellent knowledge. But it stands me in hand, rather to crave
pardon, for this my boldness, in putting to the veiw of so many learned
Musitions, (which this age and Realm affords) these first fruits of my
poor knowledge in Music, yet I hope, that as they themselves had small
entrances, before they came to their perfection, so they will favorably,
accept of these beginnings, looking for better hereafter: And in hope of their
better likings, I have made choice of you to patronise these my labors, as
well for the Haereditarie virtues of your godly parents already dwelling in
you, as also for the delight, knowledge, and practice which you have in
Music, in the which few or none (that I know) can excel you. Vouch safe
therefore (worthy Mistrisses) to undertake the tuition of that, which by right
and equity, you may challenge for your own, being no strangers, but home
bredd, and which for your delight and co^tentments were first by me compiled:
and as you seemed to like them, being mine, so I do not doubt but you will
more favor them, now being your own. Then I (your devoted servant) shall
think my pains herein very well rewarded, and be better encouraged to employ
my time hereafter in your further service.

Yours in all duty, George Kirbye.

TENOR. The first set OF ENGLISH Madrigalls, to 4. 5. and 6. voices.

LONDON Printed by Thomas Este dwelling in aldersgate street. 1597.

To the virtuous, and very worthy Gentlewomen, Mistress Anne: and Mistress
Frauncis Iermin, daughters to the right worshipful, Sir Robert Iermin Knight,
(his very good Master) G. K. wishes in this life, increase of all virtues,
and in the life to come, the full fruition of all happiness.
IT were a thing very unnecessary (thrice worthy and virtuous gentlewomen) for
me (although I were able) to speak any thing in commendation and praise of
Music, considering (besides that many learned men have learnedly written in
commendation thereof) the examples of times past, and our own experience every
day, does give sufficient testimony both of the pleasure and proffit that it
brings to a distressed and melancholy mind. Also I think it convenient not to
answer (otherwise then with silence) to those (more senseless then brute
beasts) that with open mouths docin-veigh, and speak all the evil they can
against that excellent knowledge. But it stands me in hand, rather to crave
pardon, for this my boldness, in putting to the veiw of so many learned
Musitions, (which this age and Realm affords) these first fruits of my
poor knowledge in Music, yet I hope, that as they themselves had small
entrances, before they came to their perfection, so they will favorably,
accept of these beginnings, looking for better hereafter: And in hope of their
better likings, I have made choice of you to patronise these my labors, as
well for the Haereditarie virtues of your godly parents already dwelling in
you, as also for the delight, knowledge, and practice which you have in
Music, in the which few or none (that I know) can excel you. Vouchsafe
therefore (worthy Mistrisses) to undertake the tuition of that, which by right
and equity, you may challenge for your own, being no strangers, but home
bredd, and which for your delight and co^tentments were first by me compiled:
and as you seemed to like them, being mine, so I do not doubt but you will
more favor them, now being your own. Then I (your devoted servant) shall
think my pains herein very well rewarded, and be better encouraged to employ
my time hereafter in your further service.

Yours in all duty, George Kirbye.

disgrace, yet ^if thou do repent thee, I will forgive, yet if thou do
repent thee, ^I will forgive, I will forgive, * that mends shall well content
^mee.

^SEe what a maze of error, and la- borinth ^of terror, my love has tra- ced,
my love ^hath tra- ced, wretched I, * whom love paineth, ^whom love paineth,
and true faith only gains, hope vt- terly disgraced, ^and by disdain, and
by disdain defaced. and by disdain, and by disdain ^defaced.

XVIII.
^IF pity reign with beauty, then may I ^bee assured, * that what my ^harme
procu- red, * will yield me help of duty, For ^wrongfull she was never, then
why should I, for wrongful she was never, then ^why should I, still in
despair persevere.

Here ends the songs of five parts.

^MVst I part: Hapless, must I part, o my Iuell, hapless, must I ^part o my
Iuell, hapless, whose beams me nourish, Alas, ^who now comfort, or does me
cherish, Oh, oh if it so must needs ^bee, my wicked fortune, how can she
further harm me. Oh, if it so must needs ^bee, my wicked fortune, how can

^VP then, Melpomene: Such cause of mourning, never had before, ^Vp griesly

SEXTVS. The first set OF ENGLISH Madrigalls, to 4. 5. and 6. voices.

Made and newly published by George Kirbye.

LONDON Printed by Thomas Este dwelling in aldersgate street. 1597.

To the virtuous, and very worthy Gentlewomen, Mistress Anne: and Mistress
Frauncis Iermin, daughters to the right worshipful, Sir Robert Iermin Knight,
(his very good Master) G. K. wishes in this life, increase of all virtues,
and in the life to come, the full fruition of all happiness.
IT were a thing very unnecessary (thrice worthy and virtuous gentlewomen) for
me (although I were able) to speak any thing in commendation and praise of
Music, considering (besides that many learned men have learnedly written in
commendation thereof) the examples of times past, and our own experience every
day, does give sufficient testimony both of the pleasure and proffit that it
brings to a distressed and melancholy mind. Also I think it convenient not to
answer (otherwise then with silence) to those (more senseless then brute
beasts) that with open mouths doein-veigh, and speak all the evil they can
against that excellent knowledge. But it stands me in hand, rather to crave
pardon, for this my boldness, in putting to the veiw of so many learned
Musitions, (which this age and Realm affords) these first fruits of my
poor knowledge in Music, yet I hope, that as they themselves had small
entrances, before they came to their perfection, so they will favorably,
accept of these beginnings, looking for better hereafter: And in hope of their
better likings, I have made choice of you to patronise these my labors, as
well for the Haereditarie virtues of your godly parents already dwelling in
you, as also for the delight, knowledge, and practice which you have in
Music, in the which few or none (that I know) can excel you. Vouch safe
therefore (worthy Mistrisses) to undertake the tuition of that, which by right
and equity, you may challenge for your own, being no strangers, but home
bredd, and which for your delight and co^tentments were first by me compiled:
and as you seemed to like them, being mine, so I do not doubt but you will
more favor them, now being your own. Then I (your devoted servant) shall
think my pains herein very well rewarded, and be better encouraged to employ
my time hereafter in your further service.

Yours in all duty, George Kirbye.
