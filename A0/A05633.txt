A MORE FVLL ANSWER OF JOHN BASTWICK, Dr. OF PHYSIC, Made to the former
exceptions newly propounded by another wellwiller to him, against some
expressions in his LETANY, with his reasons for the printing of it.

All set down as more Articles superadditionall upon superadditionall, against
the Prelates.

This is to follow the LETANY as a FOVRTH PART of it.

Printed in the Year of the English Prelates malice, and crualty, against and
upon Gods faithful people, 1637.

The fourth part of the Letany, OF JOHN BASTWICK, Doctor of Physic.
Worthy Sir,
AS I most kindly thank you, for the many favors, you showed me in my
prosperity, so I do heartily, for your well wishes toward me in this my
captivity: and as I do cordially thank you for both, so I do likewise promise
all reciprocal endeavor in all Offices of love in way of remuneration: and so
much the more your humanity deserves it, because you condole not only my
present desolation, but study to prevent further fury in my adversaries, which
will tend to my greater ruin as you say, if they have any just, or but seeming
ground for it: and therefore you have freindly I thank you advertised me of
some danger you fear will come upon me, if my Letany should be published, in
regard of some expressions in it, as that I seem to vilify the Service of the
Church established in the Kingdom by Parliament, and that I call the Prelate of
Canterbury William the Dragon, and his brrther of York, the abbey lubber of
the North; now they being privy Counselors, such speeches will be adjudged
scandalous as you suppose, and therefore that I shall be censured for Scandalum
Magnatum. And withal you think it is a revillng those in authority, which the
Angel would not do to the very Devil. And this is the sum of what you have
to object against my Letany. To all which although I have formerly answered in
my letters to others, yet because I know not whether you may ever see them, I
thought fit in breife to reply as follows.

And first whereas you seem to intimate by your words, that I should either
totally suppress the printing of my LETANY, or else take out those words: I
conceive neither of both by any sound reason ought to be done: for that the
LETANY is printed, the Prelates are the cause of it: and of the writing of it:
for would they have let me followed my own employments, I should never have
troubled my thoughts about them: for I most ingenuously confess unto you, that
nothing more greeves me, the that I am constrained to make those men a subject
of my discourse, that at other times I would scorn to make an object of my
cogitations: but they I say, having by their unhuman and unchristian
proceedings deprived me of liberty, and all lively hood, and by this means
ruined me and all mine, and to all this threatened farther calamity and misery
unto me, as the slitting of my nose, the branding me in the forehead, and the
cutting of my ears, all which things being daily related unto me by others, I
must confess it, put me upon my devotions, and was the only cause of my
Letany; and had not their thundering words come unto me, I should never have
done any thing in English: but that my country men, might see something into
the Prelates well meaning toward the Church and State, and withal might be
stirred up to a diligent, endeavor to prevent the mischief, as they fear God,
and honor their King and low their religion and country, I writ that
treatise, and sent it to my good Angel, but hearing withal, that some evil
Angels were abroad, and had misinterpreted it, and the Prelates threatened me
yet more cruelly for that: then I resolved to make that public which otherwise
should have been for my own use, and the benefit of some few friends only: and
this is one of the causes of the printing of it, and all my other
superadditionall articles against them: For at the making of it, I had never
thought to have lived a day: the plague on every side environing me about, and
many poor people coming up to my chamber for cure with soars running on them:
all the Physicians being gone out of town: and therefore my danger being so
great, and all possibility of escaping of it, being also taken away, I took my
self then to my Letany, and that it seems was not well taken by M. Priests
and Prelates; neither could they conceal their venom, and evil intents, but
must for the greater terror of others divulge them, and they as I said coming
frequently to my intelligence, for fear withal, that they should adulterate
my true copy, I therefore writ over another with my own hand which I got to be
copyed out, and so let some of my friends see it, and such also as had been
many years in the High Commission Court, and that knew very well I slandered
them in nothing I said: only out of their good affection toward me, they
feared, and that very much, that the Prelates would proceed to the extremest and
rigerousest punishment that by law could be inflicted upon me. For their
Kingdom was first by blood begun and established, and by blood has hitherto
been continued, and by blood only shall be perpetuated, but for my blood and
life I stand not for that, so that the truth may be known, and their
wickedness, plots, and cruelty be discovered, and truly next unto the especial
providence of God, which always brings good out of evil, I may thank the
Prelates for the honor of this good work (cost it me what it will) for they
only were the cause both of the beginning and publishing of it: for if they
had not breathed out threats against me, presaging their bloudthirstinesse, I
should never have studied to dive so far into this business; in the which
through Gods blessing I have made so good progress, as I hope all those that
either, fear God or their King, or love their countries, through the whole
Christian world, with all the Christian Kings, Princes and Emperors, and all
free States will manifestly see, not only the little need of the Prelates
Government in their Kingdoms and Countries, but the great mischeife and damage
they bring to all Commonwealths and Nations where they dwell. And to say no
more but the verity, there is as little need of them, and their jurisdictions
in Kingdoms for the well administering of them, as is in our Christian and holy
profession of the Service-booke, which yet never either begot grace or the
fear or love of God, or increased any gift of God in any; and is well known
to the whole corporation of those that call upon the name of God in sincerity,
that it does not only hinder goodness, but does hurt, and that abundantly, and
indeed were there no other just cause of casting of it out, but that it does no
good, this I say were enough to remove it: but especially when it is a cause of
much evil every way, it ought to stir up authority to look into it: for
very reason teaches us, that which is no way useful nor needful for the
salvation of men of that there can be no true need: now of the Service book
there is no need nor necessity, for if there had been God would himself have
appointed one, and all Christian Churches would have had that, that had been
needful to their salvation: and therefore, when God has neither appointed
certain prayers to be daily read, nor other Christian Churches which are daily
saved, never had any: and when no man dare conclude that any man was ever
excluded from heaven that never heard any Divine service, it seems a strange
thing to me, that such a piece of service in our Church should be authorized
that was taken out of the Mass book; and of the which all the learned in
reformed Churches where I have lived, wonder that such a learned Prince as King
James was, would ever admit it in his dominions; for they all had seen it, it
being translated into French, and this I was often an ear witness of that the
profoundest men said, if so be they had a purpose to turn again to Babylon,
from which they were commanded to come out, they would for a speedy way bring
in the English service and discipline; and then farewell immediately all true
religion and the entire service of God, and by this means they should give so
great and strong a weapen into their adversaries hands, as they should never be
able to make good their proceeding, and withal should in a little time breed
such a deal of ignorance in the people, as they would be easily seduced. For
whereas many of them, had not time through their many occasions in the whole
week to read the Scriptures, if they should also on the Lords day be taken up
in reading of prayers gathered and collected out of Popish Pamphlets, this
would be an absolute means to extinguish that little knowledge they had
already, and bring in blindness in stead of it. And with all the correspondency
that was between them in rites, Ceremonies, and Service, would kindle a greater
love in the Papists to their superstitious worship, and in the Protestant it
would also upon the least occasion beget some desire to return unto their old
errors: and therefore they protested as they tendered the honor of God, the
salvation of the people, and the advancement of learning, they could never
admit of our service amongst them: of all which they professed they thought it
an enemy, and they add farther, that if they had ever believed that such forms
of prayer had been for the advancement of the Gospel, and the glory of God,
and the edification of the people, they had thousands in their Church that
could make forms of prayer, and never be beholding to the Masse-booke for them.

And I can truly say thus much, I never yet met a Minister in France, were he
in never so mean a place, but he was a diligenr preacher, and able to instruct
any flock, withal he was of so good literature, as I never saw yet Bishop, or
any high Priest in England to be compared to him for that, which I speak to
the eternal honor of that people, that give unto their Ministers such
singular breeding, and have such care in their elections that they be able and
sufficient men, and every way so accomplished for life and doctrine, as they
cannot neither by fear, favor or preferment be brought from their integrity,
nor by all persecutions, wars, bloody massacres be in the least daunted or
deterred from their holy profession. And of this Christianimity is this people
and many more, and of this sound learning, where they never had a Letany or
service book: or either in government, discipline, or ceremonies, were like
unto the Papists, all which have been ever dangerous if not fatal to all true
religion: for when Christians began to bring in Jewish and heathenish
ceremonies, rites, and customs, and their inventions, they then began to
pervert true Religion and corrupt the sound doctrine of our glorious and holy
profession. And King James himself though for some ends, he was willing for a
time to retain the ceremonies, yet he professed in the conference at Hampton
Court, that if he did dwell among the heathens and Papists that then there was
great danger in symbolizing with the^ in any such things, for it would much
animate them in their superstition, by which they might be hindered rather then
furthered in religion: but in regard that they had no Papists among them which
might be hurt by them, he was the more willing to conniue at them, but had he
lived until now, and seen what mischief both ceremonies and service have done
amongst us, or did but King Charles see, or were but truly informed of the
ignorance that is amongst the people both in regard of their duty toward God
and his royal Majesty, of the backsliding to Popery and superstition, which
has ever protested against, he would take some speedy course for the removing
of all the occasions of it which is nothing else bur the service book and
ceremonies, with their corrupt discipline and Gouerners, and as by his authority
and the authority of his royal Predecessors they were established, so when the
inconveniences of all such constitutions are by daily experience seen, which
was ever sufficient cause to abrogat laws, and dismiss Officers, they may
well be removed with the great good to the whole Church and state and to his
excellencyes immortal honor and the perpetuation of his Crown and dignity.
And thus much at this time shall suffice to have spoken concerning the service
book and the tackling belonging to that business, because I have formerly
spoken of it.

And now I am come to your master and capital exception, where you think that
they will heavily censure me for calling the Prelat of Canterbury William the
Dragon and the Bishop of york the abbey lubber of the North. Which you
conjecture will be esteemed scandalum magnatum and will cause a severe
punishment from authority, and which they have also cruelly threatened unto me
for the same words, and therefore you would have them omitted. But before I
come to the distinct answer to that you now suggest, I think it fit to say
something for a proeme concerning this scandalum magnatum, and the orginall of
it you very well know, that Kings have ever been called and esteemed Gods upon
earth, and they indeed went before their people shining in virtues and goodness,
of which they were composed, and so far they were from any commaculation of
vice, that people were not to think evil of the King in their bedchamber, or
to say what do thou? by all which is sufficiently inferred, what excellency
is in Princes and mighty potentates above other men. And as Kings had the
supreme and first degree of dignity both for place and virtue: so next unto
them, had the true Nobility and great Heroes their station, whose first rise to
honors was their wisdom and true service unto their Prince and good they did
to their country, according to that of the heathen, fundamentum nobilitatis
virtus est. So that the true and ancient Nobility were such as next unto their
Kings and Princes were for all excellent endowments so singularly qualified, as
they were not capable of any aspersion, and if any had been so black mouthed as
to have laid any blemish upon their reputation, the evil always returned unto
themselves, neither was their honor impeached by it, but rather illustrated,
for the whole world was well acquainted with their goodness. so that their
traducers, were branded for calumniators amongst the people, which was
punishment enough and eternal shame unto them. And so sarre were those truly
heroical Spirits from making any laws about such a thing that they never
thought so poorly of themselves, as that any could speak the least thing to
their infamy by which they could wound their reputations and virtuous life, And
the same goodness yet dwells in all the ancient Nobility and such as are
truly illustrious and magnates, so that they are like their Kings and Masters
whose dignity no blast of a foul mouth can contaminate among the really
virtuous and heroical: and so conscious they are to themselves, of their
excellent integrity, that they will not so much as sully their thoughts with
what any clamorous tongue says, much less their estimation among the prudent,
as to make them suppose that they are moved with railings which hurt them no
more then the dogs barking against the Moon. Notwithstanding since those
ancient and truly honored Nobility, there have sprung up a new generation of
Lords, who fearing the calumnies of the vulgar, as new Lords are a means of
sounding new laws, have obtained so much of prudent Princes and Kings who were
willing to yield unto their weakness that such laws should be enacted, but
with no intent that the vices of such men should be smothered, or that those
should be punished, that were detectors and manifesters of them, but only for
both terror and punishment if they had unworthily defamed their noble families
out of their private malicious and rancourous minds; neither does the eminency
of place in any subject warrant him securely, to do any thing against the
honor of his King and Master, or the molestation of his Kingdom and subjects,
or is the meanest subject to be punished for doing his duty in this kind, for
the dignities conferred vpom them in such proximity unto the King, is so much
the greater tie unto them for the due hounouring of their Prince, and seeing
that next unto him, whose place it is to protect his people they should add
their helping hands in seeking the safety and welfare of them, and be indeed
mediators between the King and the poor people, if they had failed by frailty
in their duty and loyalty to his Highness. Now I say when all those that are
dignifyed with honors, do neither truly honor the King as they should, and
are so far from making a sweet harmony between the King and his people, as
they continually rather put into his royal heart sinister opinions against his
best subjects, and traduce their best endeavors, and pervert their words to
contrary meanings, and make their poor brother a prey for a word, as the
Prophet I say speaks, and do not only move the King against them, but do in
their own persons, and by the authority that they have given them,
tyrannically abuse the subject to their utter ruin and undoing, all such I say
are so far from having any privilege by the Law, as they themselves are
delinquents in a high degree of contumacy by such demeanor, and are fallen
from their dignity. Neither do I conceive that any King or people can take it
ill at the meanest subjects hand for discovering any such men's practices, when
I say, they are so prejudicial to the State. In the number of which men, to
say nothing neither of the obscurity of their parentage, the meanness and the
poverty of their breeding, the beginning of their order, and whose image they
are, the usurpation of their places, being by them the sworn rebels of
Christ, and the cursed enemies of his Kingdom, as I have in diverse books
sufficiently showed, I say to speak at this time of none of all these but
only of their present proceeding toward the King their Master, toward the
Church and Commonwealth in general, and all the poor people, and my self in
special, you will quickly perceive that the Prelates are justly to be reputed
among the worst of men, and not amongst the Nobles, for ought I know they and
they only are the cause of all the calamities in Church and State, which will
manifestly appear if we look either upon the King or true Nobles, such as
love God, the King, their Country and Religion. And for the Kings most
excellent Majesty's own person, to speak but that equity and justice require,
what were ever any precedent Kings in this or any other Kingdom renowned for,
that is not in him, if you respect either virtues moral or theological, which
are the only honor of Princes, I say name any thing for piety, wisdom,
learning, prowess, temperance, clemency, goodness, bounty, affability, kindness,
or whatsoever else was in any other, do you not see it in him radically, nay
does he not seem to be composed of goodness? so that never was there any nation
more happy in a King, then this our Nation is in ours. Again to reflect our
eye upon the whole secular Nobility either ancient or modern, I say to speak
of them in the general, if you accost them, and by any occasion have to deal
with them, you shall find them so excellently inclined, and so favoring all
virtue and goodness, and of such sweet humanity and kindness, and such honourers
and favorers of learning and true virtue, as they are exemplar to all other
Nations; so that for King and Nobility no Nation or Kingdom can compare with
ours, and yet nothwithstanding all this, there is not in the world any Country
that the subjects for the universality of them, groan under more pressures,
and are more tyrannically abused then amongst us, if you respect either,
bodies, souls or goods, having no certain liberty for a day of either, as
woeful and lamentable experience hourly teaches us. All which proceeds not
either from the King who is goodness it self, and knows not how to do evil,
or from the Lords or Peers of the Kingdom, who are like their King and Master,
and fabricated of humanity; from whence then I pray you proceed all the
greivances of the poor people, but from the Prelates? who make a prey of the
subject upon every trivial occasion, and suggest into his royal ear both in
public and private strange relations concerning them, as though they were the
most disloyal people unto his grace in the world, when I can upon my own
knowledge affirm that never King was more happy in a loyal and obedient
people then the King is in them, never detrecting obedience to the loss of
life liberty and estates, but as they were borne under obedience, desire to
live and dye in that condition, and are ever most willing to spend their best
bloods for his honor, crown and dignity, or in the cause of any of his
allies, which is well known to the whole Christian world. And yet
notwithstanding all this, their condition is most grievous, whether yea respect
soul or body, liberty or means, they being every where deprived by the
Prelates of their faithful and true honorable Pastors and diligent teachers, by
which the keys of heaven are taken from them, and idle drones and Epicures put
in their places, who neither feed the people themselves with the bread of life,
nor will let others do it, or suffer them to provide for their own souls
good, but if they go into any other parish to hear the word when they have
none at home, then they hoyst them up into the high Commission, and there ruin
and undo them, or if the people for fear are deterred from hearing of
sermons, and seeking to be acquainted with the word of God, and if there chance
a two or three neighbors to meet together for to confer about holy things,
or in every thing observe not all their vain and needles, yea too too
chargable and burdensome Ceremonies, any of these things are matter enough to
procure perdition and destruction unto them of body, soul and goods, as daily
experience teaches us. Neither can any secular man, Magistrate or Officer, be
he Justice of peace, Mayor, Bailey, or Constable, Iury-man, or witness, or any
other do his office and duty in putting in execution the Kings Laws, either
for the honor of the King or his Religion against a delinquent Priest, or
against any of their impious Officers, or write or witness the truth against
them or the common enemy, but they are immediately hoisted up in their Courts,
and the King has forthwith strange informations given against them, as if they
were notorious delinquents against King, Church, and State, so that they are
not only deserted of all help from his Majesty and Nobles, and the Laws of
his Kingdom, but made a prey to the merciless fury of their enemies, and the
Prelates being their enemies and parties, witness, Jury and Judge in their own
cause, sit and give sentence against them. And whereas Christ would be no Judge
nor divider, they howsoever they pretend to be his successors, judge the poor
people most cruelly, and divide not only their inheritance, but give away
their whole estates, and commit their souls to the Devil, and commit their
bodies to eternal prisons to the utter undoing of them, their poor wives and
children, and that upon every trivial occasion, and many times against all
Laws of God and nature, and captivate the poor people, and keep them in a
greater slavery both for soul and body, then ever Pharao did. And whereas
Christ came to heal and cure, and spilt his own precious blood for the
redemption of others, and no sooner was Malchus his ear cut off, but he put
it on again, they spill the blood of the people, and cut off their ears at
pleasure, yea with ignorance and cruelty murder them, souls and bodies, of all
which no subject can be ignorant, that knows any thing, and I by woeful
experience have found it; so that for my particular, I may truly say that, in
respect of our gracious King and his clemency, I had rather live with bread and
water under his regiment, then in all plenty under any Prince in the world, yet
in respect of the Prelates tyranny who abuse the authority committed into their
hands, I had rather live under the grand senior, in the meanest condition then
where they domineer, with all plenty, for by their cruel proceedings and
cursed inhumanity, they so imbitter our lives, and make us so odious both in
Court and Country, and such a prey to every profane Priest, that our lives
are not only irksome unto us, but our being and living a very burden, so that
death is most welcome, for by that and that only we are set at liberty. And I
dare presume, that of what I now say, ten thousand thousands will witness with
me of the truth of it: For it is the Prelates that have only enslaved us
against all the Laws of God and the Land, and have made us hateful to all
men, and a spectacle of men and Angels, and yet they persuade his royal
Majesty, that they are his most loyal and faithfullest subjects, and all
those they accuse for Puritans the pest and plague of his Kingdom, and seek
with Human the extirpation of them all. and by all manner of oppressions make
thousands of them fly the land, and others that have no abilities to support
them in strange Countries to eat the bread of affliction, and live here with
wounded consciences, when they put upon them such burdens of Popish Ceremonies,
and force them upon pain of severe punishment to the observation of so many
superstitious performances, which by their knowledge and in their consciences,
they are taught ever to abhor, and by this means the people are made
miserable every kind of way. And all this intolerable bondage proceeds only
from the Prelates who many times arm themselves with his Majesty's authority
pretending to his Highness, that they only injoyne those things for order, when
there is no such matter. And while they do all this annoy to the kings
subjects, can they challenge the name of Mag^^^^es, and be counted among the
truly noble Peers of the Kingdom, especially, when in their open Courts they
renounce his authority, and challenge their own preeminency and dignity (...),
and punish his subjects for writing against Antichrist and the Church of Rome,
which King James calls Babylon and Spiritual Egypt and Sodom, to the infinite
dishonor of King James of famous (...), and the now King their Master? by all
which proceedings they have made themselves guilty of great contumacy against
God and the King, and ipso facto are all in a Praemunire. by which they are
fallen from all honor and dignity: and are at the Kings mercy as delinquents,
and such as for my part, so long as they continue in that condition, I never
intend to honor. Neither have I cause for my own particular to think any
otherwise of them, then of n^cent members of Church and State, both by the
warrant of King James himself, and for their carriage toward me and the Kings
best subjects: for when I was in the high Commission Court, how superciliously
the Prelates carried themselves toward me all the standers by can tell: and
when the advocats saw the violence of his deportment toward me, and earnestly
persuaded me to an humble submission, for otherwise they told me he would
utterly undo me which indeed so fell out. I then replying that I was not
conscious to my self of any delinquency either against God or the King, or that
deserved convention before any Court of Judicature in the world, and for my
part I resolved to dye rather then by baseness of submission to make my self
an offender. Upon which they demanded of me if I would contend with their
Lords grace, I then again answered, that I contended with no man, but for the
truth of God, and the honor of the King, my Country and Religion, and in that
contention I would live and dye. Whereupon one of the chiefest Advocats in v
court told me, that ye Prelat would kill me with his breath, which I conses was
such a diabolical expression, and a speech of such arrogance, as never I
think before was heard of: and therefore upon that, I called him ever after
William the Dragon, for the Dragon only kills men with his breath as
Historians do relate, and as the Apocalips witnesses, and had I not been a
Physician, and had an Antidote against it, what do you think would have become
of me, when his breath is poison? I must ingenuously confess it, I think it
is not safe that such a breath should come nigh the King, and who knows but
that he was the cause of this last years plague that killed so many, and that
he infected the air. And for the Prelat of York, he would have had me
knocked down with club law, for maintaining the Kings prerogative royal
against Papal usurpation, and said in open Court that he was not beholding to
the King for his Bishopric, for Jesus Christ made him a Bishop, and the Holy
Ghost consecrated him, when notwithstanding he never performed the office of a
Bishop and true Pastor of Jesus Christ, but has ever been a mere drone, and a
hinderer of all preaching and teaching by all which he may well deserve censure
from the King and State, as being in a Praemunire, and the title of an abbey
lubber. But you say, they are privy Counselors, and that the Angel would not
revile the Devil, and therefore I have done amiss in that. To all which I
will briefly answer and so conclude, as concerning their dignity, so long as
they had not by their misdemeanour made themselves delinquents. I never
impeached it or hurt their renown in the least, but they falling from grace
and becoming contumacious against God and the King, and noisome to all his
poor subjects, in this condition where now they are, I conceive no honor due
unto them, nor they worthy of any dignity, (...) they acknowledge their errors,
and crave pardon of God and his most Sacred Majesty. And the truth is, it is
great pity, that there is none of the Nobles that will inform his Highness of
their wickedness, by which they have made themselves unworthy of all honor,
much less to be of his privy Council and most secret admission, they are the
privy members of the Clergy that stand up against all goodness and adulterate
the whole Church. And what mischeife may not such men do, who have abandoned
all good conscience nay what misery have they not brought all the Kings
subjects into? For they when they are most disloyal and pernicious to Church
and State: yet make the King believe that they are his best subjects, and the
support of his Crown and Dignity, and the only upholders of Government, and
thus they prate also in open Courts: and this has ever been the language of
Antichrist and his limbs, No Pope, no Church, No Pope, no King, but present
confusion upon all Nations where his Government is called in question: when as
it is well known to all those that are not strangers to the Histories of
times, that the Bishops of Rome have made Kings and Emperors their very
Vassalls, and have been the bane of many flourishing Kingdoms: and to this day
inslave all those Christian Princes, and their subjects where ever I say, they
have power and authority, so that the Kings have only the name, but they
command, and their Cardinals Priests and Prelates, and are attended like
Princes, their very meat being stood bare to as to Kings. For they say, Be
uncovered my Lords meat is coming up, so that they captivate Princes, and make
themselves Lords, Neither can it be otherwise: for they have the breeding of
all those Kings and Princes: and they are resolved to keep them in a
perpetual ignorance: for they say that King Henry's and King James his
learning was the overthrow of the church, and so long as Princes and Kings were
kept in blindness they then held their possessions and honors in all security:
but since that they began to look indeed into learning, they found it fatal
to them, and therefore, they have now decreed amongst themselves hereafter,
that Princes and Nobles which they will have the breeding of, shall be
acquainted with nothing but pleasures, or at most with Grammatical learning,
Nay they shall be persuaded, it is rather a dishonor to a King to know
letters, then a dignity, and that it is not fit for them to look on a book,
it being enough for Kings to have learned men in their Kingdom: and a
flourishing clergy, neither is it for them to trouble themselves about learning
or religion, but to leave it to the reverend Fathers, and to put their
authority into their hands, and they will case them of all cares that way, so
that they shall in time find a sweet content, for they promise to make them a
people subject enough which indeed they do, for they make them beggars and
slaves, and most Kings that they have the tutoring of, either children or
tyrants, and all the Nations where they have place but an unhappy people, for
they keep them ignorant, and deprive them of the liberty of their consciences,
and take away the right of the subjects from them. For all the Kingdom of
Antichrist is a monstrous deformity of Government, and such as advances it
self above all that is called God: and tramples upon all states of men, so that
it is a wonder to me that all the Kings and Princes in the world do not join
together to demolish that Babell, and to ruin the whore. But I much more
admire, that in this Kingdom where there is so much light, and so
understanding a Prince, that the Nobles and Gentry with the Commons do not
join together to petition his Majesty, that we may be eased of this
intolerable yoke of these Prelates that are now by their frequent usurpations,
enemies of his royal prerogative, most burdensome to his poor subjects, and
if there be not some speedy course taken with them will ruin this flourishing
Monarchy. All which is so palpable as all men that see any thing in States
affairs may easily behold it.

There is one thing, that I cannot but stand astonished at, that so many wise
men in a Kingdom should not look into, and perceive the inconvenience of it,
and the wrong it does to the whole Nation, and that is this. That the breeding
of the Kings and Noblemens childeren, and the most illustrious Families through
the Kingdom, should be put into the hands of Priests; and such men who as they
are by nature and education men that never saw farther then a Cloister at
Cambridg or Oxford, never knew what Heroical and Princely virtue was, (...)
never came where either breeding religion, or ^^d manners came: the Universities
themselves ^^ing corrupted by them and, and educated to su^^^stition or
profaneness, and contempt of religion. And yet notwithstanding these men I say,
should be made the tutors of Kings and Nobles children, who ^^ght to be brought
up by learned and truly religious Gentlemen that have been bred up in Princes
Courts, and are lovers of learning, piety, and virtue, (...) all which those
monkish fellows are mere stran^^^rs, and are as fit to bring up Princes, as a
cow is (...) a saddle: for besides their deficiencies both na^^^all and moral,
they are a very ignorant society for the most part, not knowing well themselves
ordinary literature, so that they are commonly ridi^^lous to other Nation, I
must confess, I think ^his to be one of the principal banes of the
Nobi^^ity, and that they know no more in learning and States policy which is
their art; and therefore if they will follow a poor man's counsel, I would
wish them all, never to let a Priest or a Prelat breed their children: for all
the Prelates and Priests are ^^^bs of the beast and his image, and they bring up
^he Noblemen and Princes in the hatred of true re^igion, and all them that
fear the Lord, and brand (...) with Puritanisme and adapt them only to
super^itious observations, and make them believe that ^e has religion enough
that can bow at the name ^f Jesus, or crouch to the Altar, or turn to the
East, ^^d do such other performances, with hearing of a ^^ttle service: and
that all those that are not affected ^ith this superstition, are enemies of
Church and ^ute: and so they make these worthy heroes, but ^^eir executioners
and butchers to torment and af^ict the poor people wheresoever they have
power. The truth is, The Prelates are the cursed enemies of ^he Lord Jesus
Christ and his Kingdom, neither is (...) any railing to call a spade a spade,
the Scripture ^alls their predecessors the Scribes, Pharisees, and High
Priests, a generation of vipers, the Sons of the Devil, etc. and therefore
by the same authority, we may call them by the same names, for they are their
successors and the offspring of Antichrist, who is the enemy of the Lord Jesus
Christ, and by consequent no lawful authority, but an usurping power, that is,
an enemy to all Government appointed by God himself: and therefore they are not
within the compass of those Saint Jude speaks of: being worse then Satan,
who when he was there rebuked, let the Angel bury Moses, but the Bishop of
Rome will keep whole Kingdoms from burial six years together, and the
Prelates have the same power to do the same wickedness, yea they are not only
not so obedient to God as the Devil, but they are greater causes of rebellion
against God, and therefore worse, then the Devil, and ought more to be
detested: for the Devil, in tempting to sin and bringing me^ to evil, he has
buth a simple suggestion: But the Prelates they have a double power, for they
can both suggest evil, and constrain us to do it, as all Kingdoms and
Nations know very well, who groan under the heavy burden of their
unsupportable tyranny; and therefore I do absolutely conclude, that there is no
sin in saying, the Prelates are the little toes of Antichrist, and in calling,
the Pope of Canterbury WILLIAM the DRAGON, and his Legatus a latere. the
Bishop of York, the ABBEY LVBBER OF THE NORTH, for they are enemies all of God
and the King, and of all the Saints and Servants of God. And therefore to draw
now to a conclusion, I could wish that all the world in our daily LETANY would
pray with me, from plague, pestilence, and famine, from Bishops, Priests, and
Deacons, Good Lord deliver us. Fare you well.

Nihil agunt Episcopi, sine typho sacriligae superbia, sine inflata cervice
arrogantiae, sine contentione lividae invidiae (...) asancta humilitate, a pace
Catholica, a charitate Christiana,

Bishops do nothing without the haughtines of sacrilegious pride, without the
swollen neck of arro^^^cie, without the contention of wan envy, far from holy
humility, from Catholic peace, from Chri^^ian charity.


Hear ends the fourth part of my LETANY, the other four are to follow, as
also some of my Latin books are shortly to come out.
