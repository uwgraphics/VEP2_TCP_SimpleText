THE MARRIAGE OF Prince Frederick, and the Kings Daughter, the Lady ELIZABETH,
upon Shroue-sunday last.
BEing desirous to give satisfaction to certain of my acquaintance in the
country, most willing to understand the manner of the tryumphes holden at the
royal marriage, of his Majesty's daughter, Princess Elizabeth.

I have made means for the true intelligences thereof, and I hope according to
the content of the Reader, I have set forth here a true discourse of the same.

First, of the shows and Fireworkes upon the waters before the marriage
performed, upon thursday night, being the eleventh of February.

Then the imitation of a Sea Fight upon Saturday following.

Also of the royal and Princely passage of Prince Palsegraue with his renowned
bride, to his highness chapel at white Hall, where in the presence of his
Majesty and the noble state, they were married, to make us rejoice, with a
wished happiness, with the maskes and revels following, shows of more royalty,
then ever in this Age was seen in the court of England.

Therefore let the Readerd hereof, prepare himself, to entertain them with
extraordinary joy, and receive the good will of the writer, for a tribute, to
be paid as a dew to his country.

The manner of the fireworkes showed upon the Thames upon the Thursday before
the wedding.
TO begin these tryumphant sports, his highness, the Queens Majesty, Prince
Charles, Prince Frederick, with the Princes Elizabeth his royal bride, and
the rest of the nobility of England, upon Thursday the eleventh of February
in the evening, being placed in the galleries and windows about his Highness
Court of white Hall, where in the sight of thousands of people, many
artificial conclusions in Fireworkes were upon the Thames performed, and that
the pleasurable sights on the water, might equal the sumptuous shows on the
land, thus they proceeded.

First, for a welcome to the beholders, a peale of ordinance like unto a
terrible thunder ratled in the air, and seemed as it were to shake the earth:
Immediately upon this, a Racket of Fire burst from the water, and mounted so
high into the Element that it dazeled the beholders eyes to look after it.

Secondly, followed a number more of the same fashion, spredding so strangely
with sparkling blazes, that the sky seemed to be filled with fire, or that
there had been a combat of darting stars fighting in the air, and all the
time these continued, certain cannons planted in the fields adjoining made
thundering music, to the great pleasure of the beholders.

After this in a most curious manner, an artificial fireworke with great
wonder was seen flying in the air, like unto a dragon, against which an other
fiery vision appeared flaming like to Saint George on Horseback, brought in
by aburning Inchanter, between which was then fought a most strange battle
continuing a quarter of an hour or more: the dragon being vanquished, seemed
to rore like thunder, and withal burst in pieces and so vanished, but the
champion with his flaming horse for a little time made a show of a truimphant
conquest, and so ceased.

After this, was heard an other rattling sound of Cannons, almost covering the
air with fire and smoke, and forthwith appeared out of a hill of earth made
upon the water, a very strange fire flaming upright like unto a blazing star:
After which flew forth a number of rackets so high in the air, that we could
not choose but approve by all reasons that Art has exceeded Nature, so
artificially were they performed, and still as the Chambers and Culuerines
plaide upon the earth, the fireworkes danced in the air, to the great delight
of his Highness, and the other Princes.

Out of the same mount or hill of earth flew an other strange piece of
artificial fire-worke, which was in the likeness of a hunted Heart, running upon
the waters so swiftly, as it had been chaced by many huntsmen.

After the same, issued out of the mount, a number of hunting hounds made of
fire burning, pursuing the aforesaid Heart up and down the waters, making many
rebounds and turns with much strangenes: skipping in the air, as it had been
a usual hunting upon land.

These were the noble delights of Princes, and prompt were the wits of men to
contriue such Princely pleasures.

Where Kings commands be, Art is stretched to the true depth, as the performance
of these Enginers have here approved.

But now again to our wished sports, when this fiery hunting extinguished, and
that the Elements a little cleared from fire and smoke, there came sailing up,
as it were upon the Seas, certain ships and galleys bravely rigd with top
and top gallant, with their flagges and streamers wauing like men of war,
which represented a Christian Navy opposed against the Turks, where after
they had a while houered, preparing as it were to make an incursion into the
Turkish country, they were discovered by two Towers or Castles of defense,
strongly furnished to intercept all such inuading purposes, so sending forth
the reports of a cannon, they were bravely answered with the like from the
galleys, banding fire and powder one from an other, as if the God of battles
had been there present.

Here was the manner of a Sea Fight rightly performed: First by assayling one
an other, all striving for victory, and pursuing each other with Fire and
sword, the Caluerines merrily played betwixt them, and made the air resound with
thundering Echoes, and at last, to represent the joys of a victory, the
Castles were sacked, burned and ruinated, and the defenders of the same forced
to escape with great danger.

During the time of all these triumphant exercises, there was not a man
vnbusied, but every one labored, some on Land, some on Water, some one way,
some an other, to move his Highness, and the rest of his princely friends a
pleasing content, which he and the other Princes with a gracious acceptance,
applauded, to the great comort of the performers, and no little joy to the
beholders.

The next morning, being Friday, his Highness, not intending to grace the
following sports with his presence, gave cause of forbeara^ce, with some rest
to the Enginers for their great toil the night before.

Moreover, it was thought convenient that a whole days preparation should be
made, in providing against the Saterdayes pastimes, which moved a more longing
desire in the hearts of his subjects to see the same, which at the time
appointed was in this manner accomplied.

The manner of a Sea fight, showed upon the Thames, upon the Saturday before
the wedding.
Between the hours of two and three of the clock the same day in the after
noone being Sroue-saterday, the Kings Majesty, accompanied with the Queen,
and the rest of the Princes and Peers of estate, to add the more glory to
these pretended shows, placed themselves in great royalty upon the privy
stairs of white Hall, where after a while expecting the beginning of the
desired fireworkes, the Lord Admiral sent forth two or three gentlemen in a
whirrie, with a flagge or banner to signify the King, and the Nobilities
tarriance for the representations, which was answered with an Intelligence by
the report, from a great cannon, whereupon a certain Venesian man of War,
and a ship called a Caruell, came proudly with their flagges and colors
sailing up, in the sight of seventeen Turkish galleys which lay houering upon
Lambeth side, betwixt whom was a most royal and praise worthy Imitation of a
sea fight in such sort performed, as if the danger of such an Enterprise had
been by true action attempted, all which explaines the honors of martialists,
and made his Majesty, with many thousands of people of all sorts, and of many
Nations eyewitnesses of the true manner of such like incounters. But not to be
troublesome in my discourses, I will briefly explain the incounters as they
passed.

There was a bar or a kind of artificial fence made upon the river of Thames
with Barges and Lighters chained together, to keep out passengers, which
otherwise with much unruliness would have hindered the pastimes, and much
troubled the performers, but being thus hemde in, as it were upon the maine
Seas, the two Venetian ships as I said before, falling within danger of the
Turkish galleys, endured a fresh encounter, and long time most worthily
defended themselves, but by reason of the number of the galleys, they were at
last boarded, taken, and carried as boot and prize under the command of a
Turkish Castle, which represented and bare the name of the castle of Argeir,
Furnished with 22. well approved great pieces of Ordinance, which was contrived
and built upon Lambeth side, at a place named Stand-gate, environed with
craggie Rocks as the said Castle is now situate in Turkey.

After the Galleys had taken these Venetian ships, and delivered them into the
Turkish Admiralls command, they had sight of an other Argosay or Galliaza,
which seemed to be of Spain, which likewise after a fierce conflict they made
prize of, and with much triumph rendered the same up also to the Turkish
Admiral.

After this, upon a sudden there was a thundering peale of Ordinance or
Chambers placed in Lambeth Marshe, whereupon the Scoutes and Watches of the
Castle, discovered an English Navy, to the number of fifteen Sail of the
Kings Pinnaces, making up toward the point, with their red crossed Streamers
most gallantly wauing in the Air, to the great delight of all the beholders,
which as then seemed to cover over the Thames in Boats and Barges.

Near unto this place stood a high built watch Tower, or Beacon of the Turks,
which at the first sight of the English Navy was set on fire, as the manner is
at all such incursions, which blazing Light (as it seemed) gave notice to the
Castle, and caused a readiness in the same for defense: In the mean time, the
Kings Pinnaces and the Turkish Galleys ioynde, betwixt whom, were shown many
strange attempts, even as they had ventured their very lives for their
countries safeties: they spared neither powder nor policy, to sack one an
other, but on both sides bestird themselves so bravely, that his Highness
withal the rest of his attendants were therewith much delighted: At last the
Galleys being ouercharged with long and forward incounters of the English
Navy, for refuge and shelter made new unto the Castle, which began likewise to
play bravely upon the English, and with their thundering ordinance made as it
were the ground to shake.

The Kings Navy to answer them was not backward in a performance, but made
the air gloomie with fire and smoke rorering from their loud mouthed Cannons.

The fight for a time continued fiercely, the victory leaning to neither side,
either of them attempting to assault and board each other, but at last the
Galleys being sore bruzed and beaten, began to yield, whereupon the English
Admiral fell down and cast anchor before the Castle, and then spared not in
the best manner to thunder off their Ordinance, whereat the Turks yielded both
Castle and Galleys, and submitted to the conquest of the English Admiral, who
fiered many of the said Galleys, sacked the Castle, and took prisoner the
Turkish Admiral, with diverse Bashawes and other great Turks, and also
recovered the Venetian and Spanish Ships, before taken by the Galleys. After
the performance of all these aforesaid, the English Admiral, in a most
tryumphant manner carried as a prisoner, the Admiral of the Galleys attired in
a red Iacket with blew sleeves, according to the Turkish fashion, with the
Bashawes, and the other Turks, guarded to his Highness privy stairs of white
Hall, where his grace, Prince Palsegraue, and his Lady remained, which
prisoners were lead by Sir Robert Mansfield, to the Lord Admiral, and by him
they were conveyed to the Kings Majesty, as a representation of pleasure,
which to his Highness moved delight, and highly pleased all there present.

All these aforesaid pastimes were most nobly performed between the hours of
three and six in the after noone, to the great content as well of foreign
nations as of our own country people, whereof in one place, and at one time,
has been seldom seen a greater number.

Also for a Farewell to this days pleasures, a train of Chambers were
discharged in Saint Georges Field of a long continuance, and of such an
Ecchoing thunder, that they even amazed the hearers. Thus ended Saterdayes
shows upon the waters, being the eve of this great Mariage-day.

The manner of the Marriage upon Shroue-sunday, with the Royal passage of
Prince Frederick and his Bride to his Majesty's Chapel at White Hall.
But now to relate and make known the royal passage of the renowned
Bridegroom and his fair Bride, (for the satisfying of many thousands) as
they entered into his Highness Chapel at White Hall: the next day being Sunday,
even ouercomes me with a rejoicing description.

The Court being placed full of people of many Estates, sorts, and Nations,
and their eyes and hearts fixed to behold the pompious glory of this Marriage
in great Royalty.

First came the Pals-graue, from the new built Banqueting House, attired in a
white Satin suit, richly beset with Pearl and Gold, attended on by a number
of young gallant Courtiers, both English, Scottish, and Dutch, all in rich
manner, every one striving to exceed in sumptuous habilliaments, fit for the
attendants of so princely a Bridegroom. After came the Lady Elizabeth, in her
Virgin-robes, clothed in a gown of white Satin richly embrodered, lead
between her royal brother Prince Charles, and the Earl of Northampton: upon
her head a crown of refined gold, made Imperial (by the Pearls and Dyamonds
thereupon placed,) which were so thick beset, that they stood like shining
pinnacles, upon her amber colored hair, dependantly hanging plaighted down
over her shoulders to her Waste, between every plaight a role or list of
Gold-spangles, Pearls, Rich stones, and Diamonds, and withal, many Diamonds
of inestimable value, imbrothered upon her sleeue, which even dazeled and
amazed the eyes of the beholders: her train in most sumptuous manner, carried
up by fourteen or fifteen Ladies, attired in white Satin gowns, adorned
with many rich Jewels.

After went a train of Noble-mens Daughters, in white Vestements, gloriously
set forth: which Virgin Bride-maides attended upon the Princess, like a sky
of Celestial stars, upon fair Phoebe. After them, came another train of
gallant young Courtiers, flourishing in several Suits, Embrothered and
Pearled, who were Knights, and the sons of great Courtiers: After them, came
four Herolds at Arms, in their rich coats of Heroldrie, and then followed
many Earls, Lords, and Barrons, as well of Scotland as England, in most noble
manner, then the king of Herolds, bearing upon his shoulder a Mace of gold,
and then followed the honorable Lords of his Highness privy Council, which
passed along after the Train toward the Chapel, and then came four
reverend Bishops of the Land in their Church abilliaments: After them four
Sargiants of the Mace in great state, bearing upon their shoulders four rich
Enamelled Maces.

Then followed the right Honorable the Earl of Arundell, carrying the Kings
Sword: And then in great Royalty the Kings Majesty himself in a most
sumptuous black suit, with a Dyamond in his hatte of a wonderful great value;
Close unto him came the Queen, attired in white Satin, beautified with much
embrothery, and many Diamonds: Upon her attended a number of married Ladies,
the Countesses, and wives of Earls and Barrons, apparelled in most noble
manner, which added glory unto this triumphant time and Marriage.

These were the passages of our States of England, accompanying the princely
Bride and Bridegroom to his Highness Chapel, where after the celebration of
the Marriage, contracted in the presence of the King, the Queen, Prince
Charles, and the rest aforesaid: they returned into the banqueting house with
great joy.

The Lady Elizabeth being thus made a Wife, was led back, not by two
Batchellors as before, but by the Duke of Lineux, and the Earl of Nottingham,
in a most reverend manner, before the Palsegraue. At his return from the
chapel, went six of his own Country gallants, clad in crimson Velvet, laid
exceedingly thick with gold lace, bearing in their hands six silver Trumpets,
who no sooner coming into the Banqueting house, but they presented him with a
melodious sound of the same, flourishing so delightfully, that it greatly
rejoiced the whole Court, and caused thousands to say at that instant time, God
give them joy, God give them joy.

Thus preparing for dinner, they passed away a certain time, and after fell to
Dancing, Masking, and Reuelling, according to the custom of such Assemblies,
which continued all the day, and part of the night in great pleasure.

The order of the Mundayes shows, with the Kings running at the Ring with the
Nobility of the Land.
THe next day (being Shroue-munday) by the King and Nobility of England was
spent in great honor, where their rich Robes of Estate seconded the day
before, with many commendable graces: for the whole Court so gloriously shined
with Imbrothered abilliaments, that it made even a smiling cheerefulnes sit
upon the countenance of many thousand beholders.

For the Kings Majesty in his own person, accompanied with his brave spirited
son Prince Charles of great Britain, the Royal Bridegroom, Count
Pallatine, the Duke of Linneux, with diverse other of the Earls and Barrons of
England and Scotland, together with the praiseworthy Peers of the Netherland
Provinces, performed many famous races at the Ring, an exercise of much renown
and honor, and the knightly sports, and the Royal delights only befitting
the dignity of Kings and Princes, and of the chiefest Nobility.

First, about the rayles or lists in the Tylf-yard, adjoining to White Hall,
were placed many Herolds at Arms, to beautify the honorable atchiefements of
these knightly Potentates, and withal, the Knight marshall of England, and his
servants, all in new liueries with their staves of office, to abate the too
forward unruliness of many disordered people, which otherwise would have much
troubled the Tournaments, and as an aid unto them, many of his Highness Yoemen
of the Guard were attendant in the listes, and withal, most of the Kings
Trumpetters in their rich imbrothered coats, the pentioners and Knights of his
graces household with their gilded Pole-axes, guarding as it were in a round,
the King with his Knightly followers.

The Queens Majesty, with her daughter the Princes Elizabeth, attended on by
many of the greatest Ladies of the Land, being placed in the Galleries and
windows of the Banqueting house, In the presence of many thousands of his
Subjects, the King mounted upon a Steed of much swiftnes, was the first that
began the honorable pastimes, and like a most noble martialist took the Ring
upon his spear, three several times together, whereat the trumpets still
sounded to the great joy of all the beholders.

After him the Illustrious Prince, Count Palatine, upon a horse of that brave
courage, which seemed to stand upon no ground, where with a spirit of much
forwardnes, he took the Ring upon his spear twice together, so lightly, and
so nimbly, that the whole assembly gave him high commendations.

After him, the brave young flower, and hope of England, Prince Charles,
mounted as it were upon a Spanish Iennet, that takes his swiftnes from ye
nature of the wind, most courageously, and with much agillitie of hand, took
the Ring clearly four times in five courses, which was in the eye of the
Kings Majesty and the Nobility, there present, a sight of much admiration,
and an exceeding comfort to all the land.

The Duke of Lineux, the Earl of Arundell, the Earl of Dorset, the Lord
Haddindon, with diverse other Barrons of England, and Scotland, afterward, in
honor of this magnificent marriage, performed many worthy races, and many times
took the Ring with much strangenes, a pleasure so princely, that it even made
the beholders hearts to leap with joy.

The Queens Majesty, with her daughter the Princes, all the while standing in
the windows, as eyewitnesses to these noble delights, smiled with much
cheerefulnes, graciously thanking them all for their loves, but especially the
new married Bride, in honor of whose marriage all these courtly pastimes were
performed.

Of the Maskes and Reuells presented by the Gentlemen of the Innes of Court,
upon the Monday night.
THe proceeding Night, sports were as sumptuous, as the passed days, and in as
gallant a manner performed: whereof to satisfy the desirefull Reader, I must
thus speak of.

The Gentlemen of the Innes of Court, in the best and rarest manner they could
devise, prepared Maskes and Reuells in the Court, that night to be presented:
and about the hours of eight or nine, they passed from the Roles in
Chancery Lane, to White Hall, in as royal manner as ever gallants did to the
Court of England.

First, there rode some three score brave spirited Gentlemen upon great
Bard-horses, most richly trapped with imbrothered furnitures, themselves
attired in cloth of gold and tissue, most gloriously shining, lighted by a
number of torches, to beautify the show with more Eye-pleasing delights.

After them, some six and thirty Maskers, divided by twelues, in most strange
Anticke suits, in a most admirable and stately manner. Likewise upon costly
trapped steedes, each of them having a Blackamoore Page attending on Horse
back, with torch lights burning in their hands.

After them followed three Charriots of Maskers and Reuellers, in garments of a
meruellous fashion, so artificially disguised, that they moved much wonder.
Upon them attended a number of Footmen, bearing burning torches, and withal,
many trumpets sounding melodiously, which was a sight both to Eye and Ear, of
an exceeding glory: These performed many delightful dances in his Highness
presence, and other pastimes of pleasure, to the great comfort of all the
beholders, and to the high honors of this magnificent Marriage.

Of the Tryumphs and Reuells upon the next night following, being
Shroue-tuesday.
THe next day being Shroue-tuesday, a day of pleasure, and Iollitie by custom,
but far more delightful by reason of this magnificent marriage, which moved
many occasions of mirth in his Highness court, for every day in several
attires, were the Nobility of the land seen flourishing in the chamber of
presence, and much was the cost spent in banqueting of foreign estates, as
well Princes Ambassadors, as the Peers and Nobles attending upon the
Palsegraue, which upon this day was as royally performed, as upon the former.

The bounty of his Majesty exceeded, for his Highness court was free for all
people of fashion, as well Citizens as others, and few came thither that
departed without kind entertainment for liberality, with spredding arms kept
open household, whereby the time may well be recorded for a time of Princes
pleasures, by reason Princes were the maintainers thereof.

The night proceeding, much expectation was made of a stage play to be acted in
the great Hall by the Kings Players, where many hundreds of people stood
attending the same: but it happened contrary, for greater pleasures were
preparing, which in this manner were performed, as upon the night before a most
famous mask came to court, by the Gentlemen and studients of the law, from
the Roles Office, by land, so some three hundred Gentlemen more, of the same
estate and calling, by water, to equal them in statelines, came likewise up
the Thames by water, with a mask to White Hall, at whose setting forth from
Winchester-house in their Barges, a peale of ordinance placed on the backeside,
seemed as it were thunder, the Barges were beautified with many flagges and
Streamers, lighted with a number burning cressets and torches, attended on by
Drums and Trumpets, which sounded all the way most melodiously, the Gentlemen
and maskers, had most glorious and rich suites of cloth of gold and silver,
with other Robes of much delight and pleasure, their entertainements in Court
were gracious, and their performance as curious as the skill and Art of wit
could devise, at which the King and all the royal assembly there present,
took high contentment.

The Kings Majesty, in the royalty of his mind, and in regard of these rare
devises of the Gentlemen of the Innes of Court, (being most of them sons to
great states of the land) invited them all within few days after, to a royal
banquet, where not only by his Highness, but by the Palsegraue and his Bride,
they had most kind and friendly thanks.

And now to conclude my discourse, the joys hereof were declared in many
places, as well City as Court: for the Belles of London rung generally in
every Church, and in every street Bon-fires blazed abundantly, there was
neither cost nor pains spared by his Highness subjects, that any way might give
signs of joy, for the Marriage of his princely daughter to her royal Husband,
whom God bless with long happiness, and Throanes of Angels keep and defend.
Amen.

FINIS.
