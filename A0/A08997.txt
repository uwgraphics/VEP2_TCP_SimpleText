LONDON, Printed by W. Sta. for Samuel Man, at the Swanne in Paul's Churchyard.

To the Worshipful, M. Thomas Hanham Esquire, to the well-affected Gentlewoman
his Wife, and to their whole family, found knowledge, with increase of faith,
which works by love, is heartily wished.
WORSHIPFVLL,
AFter I had made an essay in your Family, of this manner of Catechizing, it
pleased you so well to approve thereof, as to desire a written Coppie to
instruct your Household, I promised it: but for that some other have also
requested the like of me, I thought it fit (being thereto also entreated) to
publish it for the greater benefit.

This is easily learned of any that can say the words of the common Catechism,
so much neglected. This binds the Learner strictly to the words of that
Catechism, in answering to the Questions here propounded: And serves more to
direct the Master of the family, to make questions out of that Catechism, then
for other to learn to make answer thereunto, if they, can but say the words,
except in some few places.

This manner of questioning to draw answers from the words as they lie in
order, may be observed not only in Catechismes, but also in reading holy
Scrptures, as is not unknown to my people here at home, with good fruit.

This my labor such as it is for the present, I present you with. For I
acknowledge your good favor toward my son, and I am very thankful in his
behalf, as he also himself is, being ^^^r ready upon any occasion to express
it to your self, as also to that worthy honored Knight, Sir. Walter Earl, at
whose request it pleased you so favorably and freely to bestow the living.

I cannot but make mention of him, when I write of Catechizing to you, for his
more then ordinary religious care in the well trayning up of his family this
way. In all my days, among all my acquaintance I have not seen the like: and
I rather admire it, when I consider his daily employment sundry ways otherwise
in publik businesses, the least whereof does commonly draw most men from almost
alea^^ of instructing their households. But what cannot a settled resolution, an
industrous nature, a holy zeal, and a godly care to have religion in honor,
make a pious and devoted heart to do.

Sir, I pray you accept this vn^aigned witness of my thankfulness, and a some
little furtherance for the instruction of your family, upon which I heartily
wish a blessing from God the Author of all good; to whose gracious guidance, I
commend you and all yours, and so in all due respectfulnesse I take my leave.

Your Worships, to be commanded. Rich: Bernard,
Batcomb.
