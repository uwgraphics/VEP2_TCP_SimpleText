Thocht now of lait God turnit yair mind and will,

To Norhame Kirk, he come withouttin mair,
The counsall yan of Scotland met him their.
Full subtellie he chargit them in bandoun,
As their Ouirlord, to hald of him the Crown.
Bischop Robert in his time full worthy,
Of Glasgow Lord, said that we do deny.
Any Ouirlord, bot the greit God abuif,
The King was wraith, and hame he did remuif.
it Iohne Ballioll followit on him sa fast,
To hald of him, he grantit at the last.
And contrair richt, ane King he maid him yair,
Quhair throw Scotland repentit it full sair.

For Iohne Ballioll yan to Montros yat send.

The Crown he tuik, upon ye samin stane,
That Gathelus send with his Sone fra Spain
Quhen Yber Scot first in Scotland came,

Brocht it to Scone, and gart it stabill their,
Quhair Kingis war Crownit viij. hundredth eir and mair
Befoir the time yat King Edward it fand,
Their Iowellis he gart turs in Ingland.
In Londoun set in witness of that thing,
Be conqueis yan of Scotland maid him King.
Quhair yt stane standis, Scotland should master be,
God cheis ye time for Margaretis airis to se.
Aucht scoir they led, of greitest yat yai fand,
Of airis with them, and Bruce out of Scotland
That office than he bruikit bot schort time,
I may not now put all ye deidis in ryme.
On Cronicklis quhy should I tarry lang?
To Wallace agane, now briefly will I gang.
Scotland was loist, quhen he was bot ane Child
All haill ouir set with our enemeis wyld.
His Father Malcolme in the Lennox fled,
His eldest Sone thidder with him him he led.
His mother fled with him fra Ellerslie,
To Gowrie past, and dwelt in Kilspindie.
The Knicht her Father thidder them sent,
Unto his Uncle with ane good Intent.
In Gowrie dwelt, and had their leuing their,
Ane agit man, quhilk ressauit them fair.
Than to Dundie Wallace to Scuill they send,
Quhill he of wit full worthily was kend.
Thus he continewit in his tender age,
In armis syne did money vassallage.
Quhen Saroun blude in this Regiou^ couth Ring
Markand the will of that vnrichteous King.
Money greit wrang yai wrocht in this Regioun,
Destroyit our Lordis, and brak yair biggingis down
Both wyfis and Wedowis, yai tuik at yair awin will
Nu^nis and Madynnis, quhom yai lykit to spil.
King Herodis part yai playit into Scotland,
Of oung Children, yat yai befoir yame fand.
The Bischoprikis that was greitest of vaill,
They tuik in handis of yair Archebischoppis haill
Nocht for the Pape, yai wald na Kirkis forbeir,
Bot grippit all, be violence of weir.
Glasgow yai gaif, as at their waill was kend,
To the Diocie of Durhame to ane commend.
Small benefice, yan yai wald nocht persew,
Bot for this thing full money other yai slew.
Hangit Barrounis, and wrocht full mekill cair,
It was weill knawin, within the Barnis of Air.
Their auchtene scoir, put to ane felloun dreid,
Bot God abuif hes send us sum remeid.
It is rememberit farther in the taill,
I will follow upon my purpois haill.
William Wallace, or he was man of armis,
Greit piety thocht, yat Scotland tuik sic harmis.
Mekill dolor it did him in his mind,
For he was wise, richt worthy, wicht and kind.
In Gowrie dwelt, still with yis worthy man,
As he Incressit, and with abandoun than.
Into his heart he had full mekill cair,
He saw the Sutheroun multiply mair and mair.
And to him self, often wald he make his mane,
Of his good kyn, yai had slane money ane.
it he was than, semely, stark, and bald,
And he of age, was seuintene winter ald.
Wappinnis he bair, outher good sword or knyife,
For he with them, hapnit richt often to stryife.
Quhair he fand ane out of ane vtheris presence*
After to Scottis, they did na mair offense.
To cut his throit, or stik him suddandly,
He waynit nocht, fand he yame anerly.
Sindrie wantit, bot nane wist be quhat way,
For as to him yair couth na man ocht say.
Lytill of speiche, was courts and bening,
Sad of countenance, he was both ald and ing.
How Wallace slew oung Selbie, the Constabillis Sone of Dundie. Cap. v.
VPone ane day to Dundie he was send,
Of cruelnes full lytill they him kend.
The Co^stabill was ane felloun man of weir
And until Scottis he did full mekill deir
Selbie he hecht dspiteous and of outrage,
Ane Sone he had, neir twenty eir of age.
Into tshe town he vsit every day,
Three men or four, yairto with him to play.
Ane Hielie schrew, wantoun in his Intent,
Wallace he saw, and towart him he went.
Lyklie he was, richt big and weill besene,
Intill ane weid of gudly ganand grene.
He callit on him, and said thou Scot abide,
Quha Devil (quod he) the graithit in sa guide weid
Ane horse mantill it war thy kind to weir,
Ane Scottis quhittill under thy belt to beir.
Rouch Rillingis upon thy harlotis feit,
Gif me thy knyfe, quhat dois thy geir sa meit.
To him he eid, his knyfe to tak him fra,
Fast be the Collar Wallace can him ta.
Under his hand, his knyfe he braidit out,
For all his men yat semblit him about.
Bot help him self, he wist of na remeid,
Without reskew he stikkit him to the deid.
The Squyar fell of him yair was na mair,
His men followit on Wallace wounder sair.
The preis was thick, and cu^merit yame full fast,
Wallace was spedy, and greitly als aghast.
The bludy knyfe was drawin in his hand,
He spairit nane, that he befoir him fand.
The house he knew his Eme had ludgit in,
Thidder he fled, farther he micht nocht win.
The good wife their, within the clois saw he,
And help he cryit, for him yat deit on tree.
The oung Capitane hes fallin with me at strife,
In at the dur he went with this good wife.
Ane Russat gown of her awin scho him gaif,
Abone his weid, that couerit all the laif.
Ane suddillit Courche, ouir nek and heid leit fall,
Ane worn quhyte hat scho braissit on with all.
For yai should nocht lang tarry at that In,
Gaif him ane Rock, and syne sat down to spin.
The Sutheroun socht quhair Wallace was but dreid
They wist not weill at quhat et he in eid.
In that same house they socht him besely,
Bot he sat still, and span richt cu^nandly.
As of his time, he had nocht leirit lang,
They left him sa, and forth this gait can gang.
With heavy cheir, and sorrowful in thocht,
Na wit of him, as yan get culd they nocht.
The Inglismen all than in barrat boun,
Bad fire all Scottis, that war into that town.
it this good wife held Wallace until nicht,
Maid him good cheir, syne put him out of sicht.
Throw ane dirk gait scho gydit him full fast,
In covert went, syne up the watter past.
Forbure the gait, for wachis that was their,
His Mother was into ane greit despair.
Quhen scho him saw, scho thankit heuinis King,
And said deir Sone, sa lang quhair hes you been
He tauld his Mother of that suddand case,
Than weipit scho, and said full often allace.
Or that thou ceis, thou will be slane with all,
Mother he said, God reuilar is of all.
Vnsufferabill is the pepill of Ingland,
Part of their Ire, me think we should ganestand.
His Eme wist weill, that he the Squyar slew,
For dreid thairof, in greit langour he drew.
This passit ouir quhill diverse dayis war gane,
That good man dred that Wallace should be taken.
For Sutheroun ar full subtell euerilk man,
Ane greit Dittay for Scottis ordanit yai yan.
Be the Law dayis in Dundie set ane Air,
Than Wallace wald na langer Soiorne their.
His Mother graithit her in ane Pilgrame weid,
Him self disagysit, syne glaidly with her eid.
Ane schort sword under his weid bair he,
In all the land full money fais had he.
Both on yair fuit, with yame mair tuik yai nocht
Quha speirit scho said, to Sanct Margaret they socht
Quha seruit her, full greit freindschip yai fa^d,
With Sutheroun folk, for scho was of Ingland.
Beside Lundoris, the Ferry ouir they past,
Syne throw the Ochell sped yai wounder fast.
Into Dunfermeling they ludgit all that nicht,
Upon ye morn, quhen that the day was lichr,
With gentill women hapnit them to pas,
Of Ingland borne, in Lynlithgow wynna^d was.
The Capitanis wife in Pilgramage had been,
Fra scho them met, and had oung Wallace seen
Good cheir they maid, for he was wounder fair,
Nocht large of tongue, weill taucht and debonair.
Forth talk and thus, of materis yat war wrocht,
Quhill south ouir Forth with her Sone scho yame brocht
In to Lynlithgow yai wald not tarry lang
Their leif they tuik, to Donypace they gang.
Their dwelt his Eme, ane man of greit riches,
This michtie persoun hecht to Name Wallace.
Maid yame good cheir, and was ane full good man,
Welcu^mit yame fair, and to them tald he than.
Did him to wit the land was all on steir,
Tretit them weill, and said my Sone sa deir.
Thy mother and you richt heir with me sall bide,
Quhill better be, for chance that may betyde.
Wallace answerit, said Westir mair we will,
Our kyn is slane, and that me lykis evil.
And other money, worthy in that art,
Leif I, will God, we sall us wreik on part.
The Persoun sichit, and said my Sone sa fre,
I can nocht wit how that redres may be.
Quhat should I speik of frustrair at this tide,
For gift of good, with him he wald nocht bide.
His Mother and he to Ellerslie they went,
Upon the morn scho for her brether sent.
In Corsbie dwelt, and was Schiref of Air,
His Father was deid, had leuit lang time their.
Her eldest Sone yat mekill was of mane,
Her husband als, at Lochmabane was slane.
Schir Malcolme Wallace was his name but leis
His hoch sennounis he cuttit in that preis.
On kneis he faucht, feill Inglismen they slew,
To him than socht ma fechtaris than anew.
On ather side with speiris bair him down,
Their stickit they, yat good Knicht of Renoun.
Unto my taill I left at Ellersly,
Schir Rannald come unto his Sister fre.
Welcu^mit them hame, and speirit of yair Intent
Scho prayit that he, Lord Peirse to wald went.
Scho Irkit of weir, scho culd na farther fle,
To purches piece, in rest that scho micht be.
Schir Rannald had the Peirseis protectioun,
As for all part, to tak Remissioun.
Than he gart write to his Sister that tide,
In that respect, Wallace wald nocht abide.
His Mother he left, scho weipit with heart full sair
His leif he tuik, syne fra his Eme can fair.
oung he was, and to Sutheroun richt savage,
Greit rowme yai had despyte and eik outrage.
Schir Rannald durst not weill had Wallace yair
For greit perrell, he wist appeirand wair.
For yai had haill the strenthis of this land,
Quhat yai wald do, durst nane aganis yame stand
Schiref he was, and vsit them amang,
Full sair he dred, yat Wallace should tak wrang.
For he and they culd never weill accord,
He gat ane blaw, thocht he was Lad or Lord.
That profferit him any lichtlynes,
Bot they repairit ouir mekill to that place.
Als Inglis Clerkis in Prophecy it fand,
How ane Wallace should put yame fra Scotland.
Schir Rannald knew, weill ane mair quiet steid
Quhair William micht be better fra their feid.
With his Uncle, Wallace of Ricardtoun,
Schir Richard hecht, that good Knicht of Renou^.
They landis haill than was his heritage,
Bot blind he was, sa hapnit throw curage.
Be Inglismen that dois us mekill deir,
In his rising, he worthy was in weir.
Throw hurt of Vainis, and menisching of blude,
it he was wise, and of his counsall good.
In Februar, Wallace was to him send,
Into Apryll fra him he bownit to wend.
Bot good service he did him with plesance,
As in that space was worthy to auance.
How Wallace past to the watter of Irwyn to tak Fische. Cap. vj.
SA on ane time he desyrit to play,
Into Apryll, the three and twenty day.
To Irwyn watter, fische to tak he went,
Sic fantasy fell into his Intent.
To leid his Net, ane Child with him yair eid,
Bot he or None, was in ane felloun dreid.
His sword he left, sa did he never agane,
It did him good, suppois he sufferit pane.
Of that laubour, as than he was nocht sle,
Happy he was, tuik fische abundantly.
Or of the day ten houris ouir couth pas,
Rydand their come, neir by quhair Wallace was:
The Lord Peirse, was Capitane yan of Air,
Fra him he turnit, and couth to Glasgow fair.
Part of the Court had Wallace laubour seen,
To him yair raid fine cled in garment grene.
Sanct Martynis fische, said Scot now we wald haif,
Wallace agane, yame meikly answer gaif.
It war ressoun me think e should have part,
Waith should be dealt in all place with fre heart.
He bad his Child, gif yame of our waithing,
The Sutheroun said, as now of thy deilling:
We will nocht tak, thou wald gif us our small,
He lychtit down, and fra the Child tuik all.
Wallace said than, gentil men gif e be,
Leif us sum part, we pray for cheritie.
Ane agit Knicht seruis our Lady this day,
Good friend leif part, and tak nocht all away.
Thou sall have leif, to fische and tak the mair,
All this forsooth sall in our flitting fair.
We serve ane Lord, their fische sall to him gang,
Wallace answerit, said thou art in the wrang.
Quhom thowis you scot, in faith you seruis ane blaw
To him he ran, and out ane sword ca^ draw.
William was wa, he had na wappinis their,
Bot the Polt staf, quhilk in his hand he bair.
Wallace with it fast on the cheik him tuik,
With sa good will, quhill of his feit he schuik.
The sword flaw fra him, ane fuit braid on ye land
Wallace was glaid, and hynt it sone in hand.
And with ye sword, ane akwart straik him gaif,
Under the heid, his craig in sunder draif.
Be that the laif lychtit about Wallace,
He had na help bot only Goddis grace.
On ather side full fast at him they dang,
Greit perrell was gif they had lestit lang.
Upon the heid, in greit Ire he straik ane;
The scheirand sword, glaid to the collair bane.
Ane other he hit, on the arm haistely,
Quhill hand and sword both on ye land can ly,
The the other two fled to their horse agane,
He stikkit him yat last was on the plane.
Three slew he their, two fled with all yair micht,
After their Lord, bot he was out of sicht.
Takand the mure, or he and they culd twyn,
To him yai raid, anon or yai wald blyn.
And cryit abide, our men ar martyrit down,
Richt cruelly into this false Regioun.
Five of our men heir at the watter baid,
Fische ow to bring, thocht it na proffeit maid.
We are eschaipit, bot in field stane ar three.
The Lord speirit, how money micht they be?
We saw bot ane, that hes ouircu^min us all,
Than leuch the Lord, and said soull mot ow fall.
Sen ane ow all hes put to confusioun,
Quha menis it may, ye Devil of hell him droun.
This day for me, in faith he beis nocht socht,
Quhen Wallace yus, ye worthy work had wrocht
Their horse he tuik, and geir yat was left their,
Gaif ouir ye craft, and eid to fische na mair.
Went to his Eme, and ^ald him of the deid,
And he for woe neir worthit out of weid.
And said sone their tythandis sittis me soir,
And yai be knawin, you may tak skaith yair foir.
Uncle he said, na langer will I bide,
Their Sutheroun horse, lat se gif I can ride.
Than bot ane Child him service for to make,
His Emis sone with him he wald nocht tak.
This good Knicht said, deir Cousing pray I the,
Quhen thou wantis good, ^u^ feche avouch at me.
Silver and gold, he gart ane to him geif,
Wallace Inc^ynit, and lawly tuik his leif.

The Secund buik declairis how Wallace slew the Churll with his awin staf in
Air.
Cap. j.
Oung Wallace yan fulfillit of hie curage,
In pryis of armis desirous of Vassalage.
Thy vassalage may never be forlorn,
Thy deid is knawin, yocht all ye world had sworn
For thy haill mind, laubour and besynes,
Was set in weir, and verray richteousnes.
And felloun lois of thy deir worthy kin,
The Rancour mair remanis thy mind within.
It was his life, and may part of his fude,
To se yame sched, ye byrnand Sutheroun blude.
To Ouchtirhous, withouttin mair he raid,
And bot schort time, in piece yair he abaid.
Their was ane Wallace, yat welcu^mit him full weill,
Thocht Inglismen yairof had lytill feill.
Both meit and drink, at his will had he their,
In Laglane wod, quhen that he maid repair.
This gentill man full often was his refeit,
With stuf of house, full often he can him beit.
Sa he desyrit, the town of Air to se,
His Child with him, as than na ma tuik he.
Ay nixt the wod* Wallace gart leif his horse,
Syne on his suit eid to the market Cross.
The Peirse was in the Castle of Air,
With Inglismen greit number and repair.
And all the town reulling on yair awin wise,
To money Scot yai did full greit suppryse.
All but abaissing Wallace amang them eid,
The rage of outh maid him to have na dreid.
Ane Churll they had, yat felloun burdingis bair,
Exceidingly he wald lift mekill mair.
Than any three yat yai amang them fand,
And als be this ane sport he tuik on hand.
He bure ane sting in ane busteous poill,
On his braid bak of any wald he thoill.
Bot for ane groit, als fast as he micht draw,
Quhen Wallace hard speik of that merry saw.
Than he desyrit at that market to be,
And for ane straik he bad him groitis three.
The Churll grantit, of that proffer was fane,
To pay that silver Wallace was full bane.
Wallace that sting tuik up into his hand,
Full sturdely, befoir him couth he stand.
Wallace with that upon the bak him gaif,
Quhill his Rig bane all into sunder draif.
The Carll was deid, of him I speik na mair,
The Inglismen assemblit on Wallace their.
Feill on the field of folkis fecht and fast,
He vnabaisit, and nocht greitly aghast:
Upon the heid with the sting ane hit he,
Quhill bane and brain he gart in pecis fle.
Ane other he straik on ane basnet of steill,
The tree their raif, and fruschit euerilk deill.
His sting was tynt, the Inglisman was deid,
For his craig bane was brokin in that steid.
He drew ane sword, that helpit him in neid,
Throw out the thickest of the preis he eid.
And at his horse, full fane he wald have been,
Two sairit him may, yat cruel was and kene.
Wallace returnit, as man of mekill mane,
And at ane straik, the formest he bes slane.
Ane felloun straik ye the other gat that tide,
With his good sword, he gart him their abide.
In at the Corslait brymlie he him bair,
The groundin sword, throw out his body schair.
Five slew he their, or he past fra the town,
He gat his horse, to Laglane maid him boun.
And keipit his Child, and leit him nocht abide,
Eschaipit thus, he can to Laglane ride.
Feill followit him on horse and als on fute,
To tak Wallace, as than it was na bute.
The treis was thick, that keipit him full weill,
Bot their to bide, yat couth he nocht adeill.
Good ordinance yat effeirit for his stait,
His custume was, all time both air and lait.
The Squyar Wallace, in Ouchterhous yat was,
Both bed and meit for him he maid to pas.
As for that time that he remanit their,
Bot sair he langit, to se the town of Air.
Thidder he past, upon ane market day,
Wald God as than, that he had biddin away.
His Emis seruand, for to by fische he send,
Schir Ra^nald Craufurd yt schiref yan was kend.
How Wallace slew Lord Peirseis Stewart, and was taken and presonit in Air. Cap.
ij.
QVhen he had taken, sic good as he had bocht,
The Peirseis Stewart, richt sadly to him socht.
And said thou Scot, quhome to byis thou that thing?
To ye Schiref, he said be heuinis King.
My Lord sall have it, and syne ga feche the mair,

He eid to him, said deir friend I pray the,
The Schireffis seruand yat you wald lat him be
Ane Lordly man that Stewart was of blude,
And thocht Wallace him chargit in termis rude.
Ga hyne you Scot, ye mekill Devil the speid,
At thy Schireffis use, thou wenis us to leid.
Ane hunting staf, into his hand he bair,
Their with he smoit, on William Wallace their.
Bot with his tree full lytill sone he maid,
Fast by the Collair, him claucht withoutti^ baid.
Ane felloun knyif fast to his heart straik he,
Syne fra him deid, schot him richt suddandlie.
Catour sen syne, I trow he was na mair,
The Inglismen assemblit on Wallace their.
Four scoir war set in armor burneist boun,
On market day, for Scottis to keip the town.
Wallace baldly he drew ane sword of weir,
Into the birny, the formest couth he beir.
Out throw the body stikkit him to the deid,
And sindrie ma, or he past ^ra that steid.
Ane other akwart, ane lang straik tuik he their,
Upon the kne ye bane in sunder schair.
The third he struik on ane pesane of maile,
His craig in two, na weidis micht avail.
Thus Wallace fairi, als wod as ane Lyoun,
Than Inglismen that war in Bargane boun.
They keip the gait, with speiris rude and lang,
For dynt of sword na man micht to him gang.
Wallace was harnest, on his body weill,
At him they socht, with schairp swordis of steill.
And fra his strenth Inueronit him about,
Out throw the preis, on ane side he brak out.
Unto ane well that stude be the sey side,
For weill or woe, their must he neid abide.
Part of yair speiris in pecis their he schair,
Than fra ye Castle, other help come mair.
Out ouir the dyke yai glaid on ather side,
Brak down the wall, na succor was that tide.
Than Wallace wist of na wane bot to de,
To win his deid, amang them thus eid he*
Other part in greit Ire heuand fast,
His byrneist brand it brystit at the last.
Brak in the hyltis, away the blaid it flew,
He wist na wane, bot forth his knyif he drew.
The first he slew, quhilk him in hand hes hynt,
And other two, he stikkit with his dynt.
The remanent to him with speiris hes socht,
Bure him to ground, that farther he micht nocht.
The Lordis bad, that yai should nocht him sla,
To pyne him mair, they chargit him to ta.
Into their Innis, suppois yat he had sworn
Out of the gait, be force they have him borne.
Thus good Wallace, with Inglismen was taken,
In falt of help, for he was him allane.
He culd nocht ceis, his curage sa him bair,
Freuoll Fortoun hes brocht him in the snair.
Their falls Gods full of vnrichteousnes,
And falls Juno, full of dowbilnes.
They feneit Gods, it Wallace never knew,
Greit rychteousnes, ay him to mercy drew.
His kyn micht nocht, him get for na kin thing,
Micht they have payit y^ Ra^soun of ane King.
The mair they bad, the mair it was in vane,
Of yair best men yat day seuin hes he slane.
They gart set him, intill ane presoun fell,
Of his torment greit piety was to tell.
Evil meit and drink, yai gart unto him geif,
Greit meruell was, gif he micht lang their leif.
And eik thairto, he was in presoun Law,
Quhill yai thocht time on him to hald the Law.
Leif I him thus, into this panefull steid,
Quhill God abuif, do him send sum remeid.
The plane complaint, and pieteous womenting,
The woeful weiping, yat was for his taking.
The tormenting of every creature,
Allace they said how sall our life Endure?
The flour of outh, into his tender age,
Be fortoun of armis, hes left him in thirlage.
Leuand this day, ane Chiftane have we nane,
Durst tak on hand, bot oung Wallace allane.
The land is loist, he is claucht in the snair,
The Apercy of Scotland is in greit cair.
How Wallace was presonit in Air and eschaipit. Cap. iij.
BArrellit hering, and watter yai him gaif,
Quhair he was set into that ugly Caif.
Sic fude for him was febill to commend,
Than said he thus, gif God wald me ressaif,
My pieteous Spreit, and saull ouir all the laif.
My cairfull life, I may nocht now defend,
Ouir few Sutheroun unto the death I drew
And that I rue, in deid and verray true,
That sone I will out of this world wend
Gif I should now, in presoun make ane end.
Eternal God quhy should I yus wyis die?
Sen my belief all haill remanis in the.
And thy awin hand full worthily hes wrocht,
Bot thou remeid, na life they ordane me.
My only Savior that deit on the tree
Fra hellis presoun with thy blude hes me bocht,
Quhy will thou gif thy handy work for nocht?
And money other, in greit pane that I se,
For of my life ellis na thing I rocht.
O waryit sword, of temper never true
Thy fruschand blaid in presoun sone me threw.
And Inglismen ouir lytill harmis hes taken
Of us they have undone ma than anew
My faithful Father despytfully they slew
My brother als, and good men money ane,
This is the dait sall us ouircum Ilk ane.
On this Kingrik, deir God quhen sall thou rue?
Sen my power thus suddandly is gane*
All worthy Scottis, Almichty God ow leid
Sen I na mair in worschip may ow speid
In presoun heir, me worthis to mischief
Now self Scotland, that of help hes greit neid,
Thy Natioun standis intill ane felloun dreid
Of warldlynes richt thus I tak my leif
Of other panis God lat ow never preif.
Thocht I for woe forth of my wit should wend
Nane other gift I may now to ow geif.
Adieu Wallace, vmquhyle was stark and sture
Thou man on neid in presoun now Endure
Thy worthy kyn the may nocht saif for gold,
Ladyis weipis, that was both myld and mure.
In furious pane thy Mother that the bure
For thou to her was deirar than the gold

In warlolynes quhy should any assure?
For thou was formit forsy on the fold.

Of Saxonis Sonis yat sufferit mekill deir.
Complene for him that is in presoun dicht,
And for na cause, Scotland bot for thy richt.

Cellimus his Master Iauelour was now
In Inglismen, allace quhy should we trow?
Our worthy kyn ar pynit on this wise
Sic reull but richt, is lytill till allow,
Me think we should in barret make them bow
At our power, and sa we do feill syse
Fra their danger God make us for to rise.
That weill hes wrocht befoir their tymis now
For they mark ay to wait us with suppryse.
Quhat should I mair of Wallace torment tell?
The Fluxis he tuik into that presoun fell
Neir to the deith, lyklie he was to draw
They chargit ye iauellour on him not for to dwell
Bot bring him forth sone of that ugly Cell
Into Judgment, quhair he should thoill the Law,
This man went down, and suddandly he saw.
And to his sicht, deith had him snappit snell
Syne said to them, he hes payit that he aw.
Quhen they presumit he should be verray deid,
They gart seruandis withouttin langer pleid.
With schort auise, unto the Wall him beir,
They cais^ him ouir out of that bailfull steid,
Of him they trowit, their should be na remeid.
In ane draf mydding quhair he remanit their
His first Nureis of the new town of Air
To him scho come, quhilk was full will of reid*
And purchest leif away with him to fair.
Into greit Ire they grantir her to go
Scho tuik him up withouttin wordis mo.
And in ane Cart vnlyklie they him cast
Atouir the watter they led him with greit woe,
To her awin house, withouttin any ho.
Scho warmit watter, and all her seruandis fast
His body wesche, quhill filth of him was past,
His heart was wicht, and flikkerit to and fro,
And his two Ene, at last kest up also.
His Foster Mother him luifit ouir the laif,
Gat mylk to warm, his life gif scho micht saif.
With all her cure, greit kyndnes couth him kyith
Her dochter had of twelf oulkis ane knaif
Her Chyldis pape in Wallace mouth it gaif
The womanis mylk confortit him full swyith
Syne in ane bed they brocht him for to lyith.
And covertly keipit him in that caif
Him for to saif sa secreitly they micht.
In their Chalmer they keipit him that tide,
Scho gart graith up ane buird in the house side.
With Tapestrie claithis honourit with greit slicht
And that the voce in every land should bide
That he war deid, throuch out the land sa wide
In presence ay scho weipit under slicht
Bot gudly meittis scho graithit at her micht,
And sa befell into that samin tide
Quhill farther mair that Wallace worthir wicht.
Thomas Rymour withouttin faill was than,
With the Minister quhilk was ane worthy man,
He vsit often to that Religious place,
The pepill demit of mekill wit he can
And sa he tald, suppois they blis or ban
Quhilk hapnit suith in money diverse place
I can nocht say be wrang or richteousnes.
In reull of weir, quhidder he tynt or wan
It man be demit be diuisioun of grace.
Their man that day had in the market been,
Of Wallace knew this cairfull case sa kene
His Master speirit quhat tythingis yat he saw?
His man answerit, of lytill hard I mean
The Master said, that hes been seindill seen.
Quhair Scottis and Inglis semblit on ane raw,
Was never it, as far as I culd know
Bot outher ane Scot, wald done ane Sutherou^ tene,
Or he to him, for adventure micht faw.
Wallace e wait, was taken into that steid,
Out ouir the wall I saw them cast him deid
Out of their presoun, fameist for falt of fude
The Master said, with heart heavy as leid
Sic deid to them me think should foster feid
For he was wicht, and cu^min of gentill blude.
Thomas answerit, their tythingis ar nocht good
And that be suith my self sall never eit breid
For all my wit heir schortly I conclude.
Ane woman syne of the new town of Air
To him scho went, fra he was fallin their
And on her kneis richt lawlie them besocht
To purches leif scho micht hyne with him fair
In lichtlynes yai grantit to her their
Atouir the watter unto her house him brocht
To bury him, als gudly as scho mocht.
Than Thomas said, it sall I leif na mair
Gif that be true, be God that all hes wrocht,
The Master hard, quhat Thomas said in plane
He chargit his man to speid him fast agane.
To se the house, and warly to espy
Quhat word he hard amang them besely.
The man went forth, at bidding was all bane,
To the new town, to pas he did his pane
To that Ilk house, and went in suddandly
About he blenkit unto the buird him by
The woman raise in heart scho was nocht fane,
Quha lyis heir, he did demand in plane?
Wallace scho said, full worthy that hes been,
Than weipit scho, that piety was to seen.
The man thairto, greit credence gaif he nocht,
Towart the buird, he bownit as he best thocht.
On kneis scho fell, and cryit for Jesus schene
Lat sclander be, and fra our thocht it fleme.
The man than swore be him that all hes wrocht,
I wald his weilfair, and caist into his thocht.
Micht I on life him anis se with my Ene,
He should be saif, thocht Ingland wald him fle^.
Scho led him up to Wallace be the greis*
He spak with him, syne fast agane can preis.
With glaid bodwart, yair mirthis to amend,
And come agane, and tauld yame haill to end.
He tauld to them the first tythingis was leis,
Than Thomas said, for suith or he deceis
Money thousand in field sall tak ane end
Fra this Regioun he sall the Sutheroun send.
And Scotland thryis, he sall bring to ane peace,
Into this Realm, greit God sall send him grace.
All worthy men, that hes good wit to waill,
Be war that e, do nocht misdeme my taill.
Perchance e say, to Bruce was nane siclyke
He was als good, quhair deidis was to assaill,
As of his handis, and baulder in battaill
Bot Bruce was knawin richt air of this Kingrik
For he had richt, we call na man him like.
Bot Wallace th^yis, this Kingrik conqueist haill*
In Ingland far socht battle on that Ryke.
The Battle of Lowdoun hill.
I Will return to my purpois agane,
Quhen Wallace was releissit of his pane.
The coutrie demit, all haill that he was deid
His derrest kyn wist nocht of his remeid.
Quhill haill he was, lyklie to gang and ride,
Into that place he wald nocht langer bide.
His true keiper he send to Ellerflie,
After him their, he durst nocht lat her be.
Her dochter als, her seruandis and her Child,
He gart yame pas unto his Mother myld.
Quhen they war gane, na wappinnis yair he saw
To help him with, quhat adventure micht faw.
Ane roustie sword in ane Nuik he saw stand,
Withouttin belt, bois, bucklair, or band.
Lang time before it had been in that steid,
Ane agit man, it left quhen he was deid.
He drew the blaid, and fand it wald weill byte,
Thocht it was foull, he tuik it with him tyte.
God help his man, for thou sall gang with me,
Quhill better cum will God sone that may be.
To Schir Rannald as than he wald nocht fai^,
Into that passage for Sutheroun maid repa^r.
At Ricardtoun he wald full fane have been,
To get him horse and part of armor schene.
Than efterwart as he bownit to fair,
Three Inglismen he met rydand to Air.
At yair veyage, in Glasgow forth had been,
Ane Longcastell, that cruel was and kene:
Ane bald Squyar, with him good emen two,
Wallace drew by, and wald have lattin ya^e ga.
To him they raid, and said despyteously,
Thou Scot abide, I trow thou be ane spy.
Or ellis ane theif, fra presence wald the hyde,
Than Wallace said, with sober wordis that ^yde,
Schir I am seik, for Goddis luif let me ga,
Longcastell said, forsooth it beis nocht ^wa.
Ane felloun freik thou se^is in thy fair,
Quhill men the know, thou sall with me to Air.
Hynt out his sword, yat was of Nobill hew,
Wallace with that, at his lich^^ng him threw:
Upon the craig, with his sword hes him ^ane,
Throw braune and lyre, in sunder brak the bane.
Be he was fallin, the two was lichtit down,
To venge his deid, on Wallace maid yame boun.
The taken of them upon the heid he gaif,
The roustie blaid unto the craig him claif.
The the other fled, and durst na langer bide
With ane rude step Wallace culd after glyde.
Out throw his Ribbis, ane sicker straik gaif he,
Quhill Lover and Lungis men micht atanis se.
The horse he tuik, both wappinnis and armor,
Syne thankit God, with glaid heart in that hour.
Silver they had, all with him hes he taken
Him to support, for spending had he nane.
Into greit haist he raid to Ricardtoun,
Ane blyith semblay was at his lychting down.
Quhen Wallace met with schir Richart ye knicht
For him had murnit, quhill febill was his micht.
His two Sonnis, of Wallace was full fane,
They had him loist, it God sauit him agane.
His Eme Schir Rannald, to Ricardtou^ come fast
The woman tald by Corsbie as scho past.
How Wallace eschaipit, syne on their wayis eid,
Schir Rannald it was in ane felloun dreid.
Quhill he him saw, in heart he thocht full lang,
Than suddandly in armis he him thrang.
He micht nocht speik, bot kissit him tenderly,
His trubillit spreit was in ane ecstasy.
Thy blyith teiris, they brist fra his Ene two,
Or that he spak ane lang time held him sa.
And at the last richt freindfully said he,
Welcum Neuoy, welcum deir Sone to me.
Thankit be he, that all the world hes wrocht,
Thus fairlie the hes out of presoun brocht.
His Mother come, and other freindis anew,
With full glaid will, to se their tythingis new.
Good Robert Boyd, that worthy was and wicht
Wald not yame trow, quhil he saw him with sicht.
Fra sindrie partis, they socht to Ricardtoun,
Feill worthy folkis, that war of greit Renoun.
Thus leif I them, in mirth blyithnes and plesa^ce
Thankand greit God, of his hie happy chance.

Abundantly in every slonk and flaid.

And tauld the Peirse yat Wallace leuand was,
And fra their presoun in Air eschaipit hes.
They trowit it weill, that Wallace past yat steid,
For Longcastell, and his three men war deid.
They waryit the chance, yat Wallace was sa past
In euerilk part, yai war full greitly aghast.
Throw Prophecy, yat yai had hard befoir,
Lord Peirse said, quhat neidis wordis moir.
Bot he be fast, he sall do greit meruall,
It war the best for King Edwardis auaill.
Micht he him get, to be his steidfast man,
For gold or land, his conqueis micht stand yan.
We think be force he may nocht gottin be,
Wise men forsooth, be his eschaip may se.
Thus deem they him, in money diverse case,
We leif yame thus, and speik of good Wallace.
In Ricardtoun, he wald na langer bide,
For freindis counsall, nor nocht that may be^yde.
And quhen they saw, that it auaillit nocht,
His purpois was, to venge him gif he mocht.
On Sutheroun blude, that hes his Elderis slane,
They leit him wirk, his awin will into plane.
Schir Richart had, three Sonnis as I ow tald,
Adam, Richart, and Simon that was bald.
Adam Eldest was growin into curage,

Good King Robert, in his time maid him Knicht.
Lang time after in Brucis weiris abaid,
On Inglismen money good Journey maid.
This guide Squyar, with Wallace bownit to ride
And Robert boyd, quhilk wald na langer bide.
Under thirllage of Seigis of Ingland,
To the false King, he had never maid band.
Cleland was their, neir Cousing to Wallace,
Syne baid with him in money perrillous place*
And Edward lytill, his Sister Sone sa deir,
Full weill graithit into their armor cleir.
With their seruandis to Ricardtoun they raid,
To Mauchline mure ane schort time their abaid.
For freindis them tald, was bundin in thir^lage,
That Fenwik sent was for the Peirseis Carriage.
Within schort time, he will bring it to Air,
Out of Carleill they have ressauit it yair.
That pleisit Wallace, in heart richt greitumly,
Wit e they war, ane gudly cumpany.
Towart Lowdoun yai bownit them to ride,
And in ane Schaw ane lytill their beside.
They ludgit them for it was neir the nicht,
To wache the way, als gudly as they micht.
Ane good true Scot, quhilk Oistlair house held their
Under Lowdoun, my Author can declair.
He saw yame cum, he went to yame in hy,
Both meit and drink, he brocht them privily.
And to them tald, the Carriage men in plane,
^hair ^oir Rydar to Air was past agane.
Left them to cum, with power of greit vaill,
They trowit be than, they war in Annandaill.
Wallace than said, we will nocht Soiorne heir,
Nor change na weid, bot our Ilk dayis geir.
At Crossintoun the way was spilt that tide,
For that same way behouit they to ride.
And fra the time, that he of presoun ^ure,
Good Somer weid* daily on him he bure.
Good licht harnes, fra that time vsit he ever,
For suddand strife fra it he wald nocht sever.
Ane Haberoun under his gown he bair,
Ane good steill cap in his bonnet but mair.
Two gluiffis of plait with claith was couerit weil
In his Doublet ane clois Collair of steill.
His face he keipit, for it was ever bair,
With his two ha^dis, ye quhilkis full worthy wair
Into his weid, and he come in ane thrang,
Was na man than, on fuit micht with him gang.
Sa growin of pith, of power stark and sture,
His terribill dyntis was feirfull to Endure.
They traistit mair of Wallace him allane,
Than ane hundredth of Ingland micht be taken.
Their worthy Scottis maid their na tarying,
To Lowdoun hill past in the gray dawing.
Deuysit the place, and put their horse away,
And thocht to win, or never hyne to ga.
Two Scurriouris send, to vesy weill the plane,
Bot they richt sone, returnit in agane.
To Wallace tald, that they war cu^mand fast,
Than to the ground, all kneilland at the last.
With humbill hartis, prayit with all their micht,
To God abuif, to help them in their richt.
They graithit them to harnes haistely,
Their soneit nane of that good cumpany.
Than Wallace said, heir was my Father slane,
My brether als, quhilk dois us mekill pane.
Sa sall my self, or vengit be but dreid,
The tratour is heir, is causer of the deid.
Than hecht they all, to bide with hartly will,
Be that the power was takand Lowdoun hill.
The Knicht Fenwik, conuoyit the carriage,
He had on Scottis, maid money schrewit veyage.
The sone was rissin, lemand ouir landis licht,
The Inglismen saw yat they come to the hicht.
Neir him they raid, and sone the Scottis saw,
He tald his men, and said to them on raw.
one is Wallace that eschaipit our presoun,
He sall agane be drawin throw the town.
His heid I wait, micht better pleis the King,
Than gold or land, or any eirdly thing.
He gart his seruandis bide with ye Carriage still,
Thocht to demane the Scottis at their will.
Nine scoir he led, in harnes burneist bricht,
And fyftie war with Wallace in the richt.
Vnrebutit, the Sutheroun was in weir,
And fast they come, full awful in effeir.
Ane manner of dyke of stanis they had maid,
Narrowit ye dyke* quhait throw the thickest raid
The Scottis on ^uit, tuik the gait them befoir,
The Sutheroun saw, their curage was the moir.
In prydfull Ire they thocht ouir them to ride,
Bot vtherwayis it hapnit in that tide.
On ather side togidder fast they glaid,
The scotts on fuit greit rowme about yame maid.
With prune and speiris, throw plaitis of fine steil
The Inglismen, that thocht to venge yame weill:
On harnest horse, about yame rudely raid,
That with vneis, upon their fuit yai baid.

The groundin speir throw out his body schair.
The schaft he schuik it of the fruschand tree,
Deuoydit it sone, sen na better micht be.
Drew swordis syne, both heavy schairp and lang,
On ather side full cruelly they dang.
Fechtand atanis in that felloun dout,

On force ettillit, out throw yame for to ride,

With swordis schair throw hals and habrik good,
Upon the feildis schot out the Sutheroun blude.

Of sa few folk, greit nobilnes micht be kend.

Of Wallace Father he at the deith had been.
And of his brother, that douchtie was and deir,
Quhen Wallace saw, yat falls Knicht was sa neir
His curage grew in Ire as ane Lyoun,
To him he ran, and freikis feill bair down.
As he glaid by, ane akwart straik can him ta,
Both Thee and Arsoun in sunder gart he ga.
Fra the Cuirsour he fell on the far side,
With ane schairp sword, he straik him in yat tide.
Or he was deid, ane greit preis come sa fast,
Ouir him to ground, yai bure Boyd at the last.
Wallace was neir, and turnit in agane,

Wichtly did him wier, quhil he ane sword had taken
Throw out the stour, yir two in feir ar gane.

In their passage, feill Sutheroun maid aghast.

On the pesane with his sword burneist bair,
The burneist blaid his hals in sunder schair.

The Scottis on fuit gart money lois the sweit.
With men lichtit, them self for to defend,

The Sutheroun part, forfruschit war that tide,

On horse sumpart to strent his can yame found,
To succor yame with money werk and wound.
Ane hundredth deid, in field was leuit their,
And three emen of Wallace deid but mair

Bot women and preistis he gart them ay forbeir
Quhen this was done, to Den^er sone yai wend,
Of stuf and wine that God had to them send.
Ten scoir they wan, of horse that Carriage bure,
With vittall and wine, als mekill as they micht fure
And other stuf, that they of Carleill sed,
The Sutherou^ part out of the field that sled.
With sorrow socht to the Castle of Air,
Befoir the Lord, and tald him of their (...).
Quhat good they left, and quha in field was slane
Throw wicht Wallace, that mekill was of mane.
And how he had gart all their seruandis hang,
The Peirse said, and that Squyar lest lang:
Out of this land he sall exyle us clean,
Sa dispytefull in world was never seen.
In our presoun heir last quhen yat he was,
Ouir sleuthfully our keiper leit him pas.
Than thus our hald, I find weill may nocht be,
we man gar bring our vittell be the sey.
Bot lois our men it helpis us richt nocht,
Our kyn may ban that ever we hidder socht.
Leif I yame now blamand their sary chance,
And mair to speik of Scottis me^nis governance.
Quhen Wallace had weill vincust into plane
The false ty^an that had his Father slane.
His brother als quhilk was ane douchtie Knicht,
Other good men befoir to deith they dicht.
He gart provide, and partit their vittaill,
With stuf and horse, that was of greit auaill.
To freindis about, richt privily they send,
The remanent full glaidly their they spend.
In Clydis wod, they Soiornit their three dayis,
Na Sutherou^ was that did persew they wayis.
Bot he thoillit deith, that come in their dangeir,
The word of Wallace walkit far and neir.
Wallace was knawin on life leuand agane,
Thocht Inglismen yairof had mekill pane.
The Lord Peirse to Glasgow culd he fair,
With wise Lordis, and held ane counsall their.
Quhen they war met, ma than ten thousand,
Na Chiftane was, that time durst tak on hand:
To leid ane Range, on Wallace to assaill,
Speirit about, quhat was their best counsel.
Schir Aymeir Walla^ge, yat falls tra^our and strange
In Both well dwelt, and than was them amang
He said my Lord my counsall will I geif,
Bot e do it, fra skaith e may nocht leif.

As for ane time, we man send to the King.
The Perse said, of our trewis will he nane,
Ane awful Chiftane trewly he is ane.
He will do mair, in faith or that he blyn,
Sutheroun to slay, he thinkis it is na syn.
Schir Aymeir said, trewis behouis ow ta^,
Quhill efterwart, for him prouysioun make.
I know he will do mekill for his kin,
Gentrice and treuth ay restis him within.
How ye Inglisme^ tuik piece with Wallace. Ca. ij
HIs Uncle Schir Rannald may make ye ba^d
Gif he will nocht, recogneis all his land,
Unto ye time yat he yis work have wrocht
Schir Rannald was sone to their counsall brocht
They chargit him to make Wallace at peis,
Or he should pas to Londoun or he ceis.
To King Edward, and bide in his presoun,
They ask to have piece for his Ransoun.
Schir Rannald said, Lordis e know richt weill,
At my counsall he will nocht do ane deill.
His worthy kyn despytefully e slew,
In presoun syne, neir to the deith him drew.
He is at large and will nocht do for me,
Thocht e thairfoir should now gar me de.
Schir Aymeir said, their Lordis counsall send
Me to the King, to make ane final end.
Of his conqueist forsooth he will it haif,
Wallace nor thou may nocht this Kingrik saif:
Micht Edward King get him for gold or land,
To be his man, than micht he bruik Scotland.
The Lord bad ceis, thou faillis to that Knicht,
Far mair in treuth, than it is any richt.
The wrang conqueist our King desyris ay,
On him and us it fall be seen sum day.
Wallace hes richt, both force and fair Fortoun,
e hard how he eschaipit our presoun.
Thus said that Lord, and prayit Schir Rannald fair,
To make this piece, you Schiref art of Air.
As for ane time we may auysit be,
Under my Seill I sall be bund to the.
The Inglismen that they sall do him nocht,
Nor to na Scottis, bot it be on them socht.
Schir Rannald wist, he micht yame not ganesta^d
Of Lord Perse he hes ressauit that band.
Perse was true, and ay of greit auaill,
Sober in piece, and cruel in battaill.
Schir Rannald him bownit on the morn but baid,
Wallace to seik, in Clydis Forest raid.
Sa he him fand bownand to his Denneir,
Quhen yai haif seen yis good Knicht cu^mand neir
Weill he him knew, and tald them quhat he was
Meruell he had, quhat gart him hidder pas.
Maid him good cheir of meittis good and fine,
King Edwardis self culd get na better wine.
Than they had yair, vernage and vennysoun,
Of bestiall into greit fusioun.
Than after meit he schew them of this deid,
How he had been into sa mekill dreid.
Neuoy he said, work part of my counsel,
Tak piece ane quhyle and for the mair auaill.
Bot thou do sa, forsooth thou hes greit syn,
For they ar set to undo all thy kyn.
Than Wallace said, to good men him about,
I will na piece for all this felloun dout.
Bot gif it pleis better to ow than me,
The Squyar Boyd him answerit soberlie.
I gif ow counsall or this good Knicht be slane,
Tak piece ane quhyle, suppois it do us pane.
Sa said Adam the Air of Ricardtoun,
And Cleland als, to their opinioun.
With their consent Wallace this piece hes taken,
As his Eme wrocht, quhil ten monethis war gane
Their leif they tuik with sad comfort in plane,
Fand God to broch, they should meit haill agane.
Boyd and Cleland past to their placis hame,
Adam Wallace to Ricardtoun be Name.
Forth with schir Ra^nald, can William Wallace ride
And his houshald in Corsbie for to bide.
This piece was cryit, in August month myld,
Their Gods of battle furious and wyld.
Mars and Juno ay dois their be^ynes,
Cawser of weir, ay wirker of wickitnes.
And Venus als quhilk Gods is of lufe,
And auld Saturn his course for to apprufe.
Their four schawis of diverse complexioun,
Battle, deba^t, Inuy, and destructioun.
I can nocht deny of their Malancholy,
Bot Wallace culd nocht weill in Corsbie ly.
Him had leuar in travel for to be,
Richt fair he langit the town of Air to se.
How Wallace slew the Buklar player in the town of Air. Cap. iij.
SChir Rannald past, fra hame up on ane day
Fyftene he tuik, and to ye town went they.
Couerit his face, yat na man micht him know
Na thing him rocht how few enemies him saw.
In sober weid disagysit weill war they,
Ane Inglisman on the gait saw he play.
At the scrymmage ane buklair on his hand,
Wallace neir by in fellowschip couth stand.
Lichtly he said, Scot dar thou nocht preif?
Wallace said e, sa thou dar gif me leif.
Smite on said he, I defy thy Natioun,
Wallace their with hes taken him on the Croun.
Throw buklar band, and the harne pan also,
Unto the schulderis ye schairp sword gart he go.
Lichtly returnit to his awin men agane,
The women cryit, our Buklar player is slane.
The man was deid, quhat neidis wordis mair,
Feill men of armis, about him semblit their.
Aucht scoir atanis upon sextene they set,
Bot Wallace sone with the formest hes met.
With Ire and will on the he^d hes him taken,
Throw the bricht Helm, in sunder brist the bane.
Ane other braithly in the breist him bair,
His burneist blaid throw out the body schair.
Greit rowme he maid, his men was fechtand fast
And money ane grome yai maid full sair aghast.
For they war wicht, and weill vsit in weir,
Of Inglismen, richt bauldly down they beir.
On yair enemeis greit martyrdom yai maid,
Their hardy Chiftane sa weill amang yame glaid
Quhat Inglismen that baid into his gait,
In contrair Scotland maid never mair debait.
Feill freikis on fold war fellit under feit,
Of Sutheroun blude lay stikkit in the streit.
New power come fra the Castle that tide,
Than Wallace fled, and drew towart ane side.
With richt good will he wald eschew suppryse,
For he in weir, was worthy, wicht, and wise.
Harnes and heidis he bewit in sunder fast*
Be force out throw the thickest preis he past.
Wallace returnit behynd his men agane*
At the reskew feill Sutherou^ hes he slane.
His men all than, he out of perrell brocht,
Fra yair enemeis, with all the power he mocht.
Unto their horse, they went but mair abaid,
For danger syne, to Laglane wod they raid.
Twenty and nine yai left into that steid,
Of Sutheroun men, that bryttinit wat to deid.
The remanent agane turnit that tide,
For in this wod they durst nocht him abide.
Towart the town, they drew with all their mane,
Curiand the piece yai tu^k befoir in plane.
The Lord Perse, in heart was greitly greuit,
His men supprysit, agane to him releuit.
And feill war deid into their armor cleir,
Three of his kyn, that war to him full deir.
Quhen he hard tell of their greit greuance,
Their self was cause of this mischeiffull chance.
Murning he maid, thocht few Scottis it kend,
Ane Herald than to Schir Rannald he send.
And to him tald of all their suddand case,
And chargit him tak Souerance of Wallace.
He said him hald fra merket, town, and fair,
Quhair he micht best be out of their repair.
The Sutheroun wist yat it was wicht Wallace,
That them ouir set into that suddand ca^e.
Their trewis for this they wald nocht brek adeill
Quhen Wallace had this chance eschewit weill
Vpone ane nicht fra Laglane hame he raid,
In Chalmer sone their residence they maid.
Upon the morn, quhen that the day was licht,
With Wallace forth went schir Ra^nald ye knicht.
Schew him the writ, yat Lord Perse him sent,
Deir Sone he said, this is my haill Intent.
That thou wald grant, quhil yat yir trewis war worn
Na skaith to do till Inglisme^ yat is borne,
Bot quhair I pas daily thou bide with me,
Wallace answerit, good Schir yat may nocht be.
Richt laith I war deir Uncle ow to grief,
I sall do nocht, quhill time I tak my leif
And warn ow als, or yat I fra ow pas,
His Eme and he, on this accordit was.
Wallace with him maid his continewance,
Ilk wicht was blyith to do him plesance.
In Corsbie thus he restit them amang,
Their seuintene dayis, suppois be thocht it lang.
Thocht yai him pleisit as Primate or King.
Into his mind remanit ane other thing.
He saw his enemeis master in this Regioun,
Micht nocht him pleis, thocht he war King with Croun.
Thus leif I him with his deir freindes still,
Of Inglismen now speik sum part I will.
The Fourt buik declairis how Wallace wan the P^ill of Cargunnok.

IN September that humbill Month sweit,
Quhen passit by the hicht was of the heit.
Vittall and fruit ar rypit in abundance,
As God ordanit to mannis sustenance.

The changeing course quhilk makis greit differa^ce
And leiffis had loist their color of plesance.
All warldly thing hes nocht bot ane seasoun,
Both herb and fruit man fra the hicht c^m down.
In this Ilk time ane greit counsall was set,
In Glasgow town quhair money Maisteris met.
Of Inglis Lordis to statu^e this country,
Than chargit they all Schireffis their to be.
Schir Ra^nald Craufurd behouit yat time be yair
For he throw richt was borne Schiref of Air.
His deir Neu^y with him that time he tuik,
William Wallace, as witness beiris the buik.
For he na time should far be fra his sicht,
He luifit him with heart and all his micht.
They graithit them without langer abaid,
Wallace sum part befoir the Court forth raid.
Ouir tuik the Child, schir Rannaldis sowme should leid
With him two me^, yat worthy war in deid.
Softly they raid, quhill yai the Court should know
Sa suddandly that time him self he saw.
The Perseis Sowme in quhilk greit riches was,
The horse was tyrit, and micht na farther pas.
Five men war chargit to keip it weill yat tide,
Two was on fuit, and three on horse can ride.
The Master man at their seruand can speir,
Quha aw this Sowme? the suith you to me leir.
The man answerit withouttin wordis mair,
My Lordis he said, quhilk Schiref is of Air.
Sen it is his, this horse ^all with me gang,
To serve our Lord, or ellis me think greit wrang.
Thocht ane subject in deid wald pas his Lord,
It is nocht leuit be na richteous record,
They cuttit the brace, and leit the harnes faw,
Wallace was neir, quhen he sic rubrie saw.
He spak to them with manly countenance,
In fair form he said but variance.
e do us wrang, and it in time of peis,
Of sic rubrie it war good time to ceis.
The Sutheroun schrew, in Ire answerit him to,
It sall be wrocht as thou may se us do.
Thou gettis na mendis, quhat neidis words mair
Sadly auysit, Wallace rememberit their:
Of the promeis he maid his Eme befoir,
Ressoun him reullit, as than he did na moir.
Bot past away to meit his Eme agane,
Seand this Reif, was muifit with greit pane.
The horse it tuik, yai for adventure micht fall,
Band on their sow me, syne forth ye way can call.
Their tyrit Sowmar yai left their in the plane,
Wallace returnit towart the Court agane.
On the mure side sone with his Eme he met,
And tald how yai ye way had for him set.
And war nocht I was bund in my legeance,
We parrit nocht thus, for all the gold in France.
The horse they reft, quhilk should our harnes beir,
Schir Rannald said that is bot lytill deir.
We may get horse and other thing in plane,
And men be loist we get them never agane.
Wallace than said, als wyselie God me saif,
Of this greit mys, amendis I fall haif.
And nouther lat for piece nor it plesance,
With witness heir, I gif up my legeance.
For cowartly e ar like to tyne the richt,
Sone after syne, our self to deith will dicht.
In wraith their with, suddandly fra him went,
Schir Rannald was wise, and kest in his Intent.
And said I will, bide at the Mernis this nicht,
Sa Inglismen of us sall deem nane vnricht.
Gif any be deid, befoir us upon cais,
Than we in Law may bide the richteousnes.
His ludgeing tu^k at the Meirnis still he baid,
Full greit murning for his Neuoy he maid.
Bot all for nocht, quhat micht it him auaill?
As into weir, he wrocht nocht his counsel.
Wallace raid forth, with his two emen past,
The Sowmar men he followit wounder fast.
Be eist Cathcart he ouir hyit yame agane,
Than knew they weill, that it was he in plane:
Be horse and weid, had arguit them befoir,
The five to them, returnit withouttin moir.
Wallace to ground fra his Cuirsour can glyde,
Ane burneist brand he braidit out that tide.
The Master man with sa good will straik he,
Both hat and heid, in sunder gart he fle.
Ane other fast upon the face him gaif,
To deid on ground but mercy sone him draif.
The third be hit with greit Ire in that steid,
Fey on the field, he hes him left for deid.
Wallace slew three, be that his emen wicht
The the other two, derfly to deith had dicht.
Syne spuil eit they the harnes or yai wend,
Of silver and gold they gat aneuch to spend.
Iowellis they tuik, the best was chosin their,
Good horse and g^ir, syne on their wayis can fair.
Than Wallace said, at sum strenth wald I be,
Ouir Clyde that time was ane good brig of tree.
Thidder they past, in all their gadly micht,
The day was gane, and cu^min was the nicht.
They durst nocht weill neir still be Glasgow bide
In the Lennox, he tuik purpois to ride.
And sa he did, syne ludgit yair that nicht,
As yai best micht, quhill that ye day was licht.
To ane Oistillary he went and Soiornit their,
With true Scottis that his neir freindis wair
The counsel met richt gudly on the morn,
Bot feill tythingis war brocht Peirse beforne.
His men war slane, his treasure als was reft,
With feill Scottis, and yame na Iowellis left.
They demit about of yat d^rf dourfull case,
The Sutheroun said, forsooth it is Wallace.
The Schireffis Court was cu^mand to ye town,
And he was ane for Scot of may Renoun.
They gart ga seik Schir Rannald in yat rage,
Bot he was still yan at his herberage.
Sum wise men said, heirof na thing he kend,
The men war slane heir at the tounis end.
Schir Rannald come be nine houris of the day,
Befoir the Peirse, and his men brocht wat they.
They followit him of felony yat was wrocht,
The Assyse of this to him couth say richt nocht.
They demit about of yat fell suddand case,
Befoir the Judge yair he denyit Wallace.
And sa he micht, he wist nocht quhair he was
Fra this counsall my purpois is to pas.
OF Wallace to speik, in wyldernes sa wide,
The Lord God be his Governor and gyde
Still at yat place, four dayis he soiornit hail
Quhill tythingis come to him fra that counsel.
Than statute they in Ilk steid of the west,
In they boundis, Wallace should have na rest.
His deir Uncle ane greit ai^h gart him ^weir,
That he but leif, na freindschip should him beir.
And money other full woe was that day,
Robert Boyd stall of the town away.
And Cleland als, befoir with him had been,
They had far leuar to se him with their Ene:
Leuand on life, as they knew him befoir,
Than of clean gold, ane fine Myl koun and moir.
Boyd weipit sair, and said our Lord is gane,
Amang his fais is set all him allane.
Than Cleland said, falls Fortoun changis fast,
Greit God sen we with him had ever past.
Edward Lytill in Aunandaill is went,
And wait richt nocht of this new Judgment.
Adam Wallace baid still in Ricardtoun,
Sa fell it thus, with Wallace of Renoun.
He with his power partit meruellously,
Be Fortoun of chance ouir turnis dowbilly.
Their pieteous mane, as than couth nocht be bet,
They wist na wit quhair that they should him get.
He left the place quhair he in ludgeing lay,
To Erll Malcolme he went upon ane day.
The Lennox haill he held into his hand,
To King Edward yan had he nocht maid band.
That land was strait, and maisterfull to win,
Good men of armis yat time was it within.
The Lord was traist, ye men sicker and true.
With waik power they durst him nocht persew.
Richt glaid he was of Wallace cumpany,
Welcu^mit him fair, with worschip reverently.
At his awin will, desyrit gif he wald
To bide their still master of his houshald.
Of all his men he should haill Chiftane be,
Wallace answerit that war aneuch for me.
I can nocht abide, my mind is set in plane,
Wrokin to be, or ellis de in the pane.
Our west country, their statute is sa strange,
Into the North my purpois is to gang.
Steuin of Ireland than in the Lennox was,
With wicht Wallace he ordand him to pas.
And other als, that war borne of Argyle,
Wallace still their, maid residence ane quhyle.
Quhill men it wist, and semblit sone him till,
He chargit nane, bot at their awin good will.
Thocht yai war strangeris, it couth he not yame dreid,
Bot ressauit them all in his weiris to leid.
Sumpart of them was yan of Ireland borne,
That Makfadeane had exylit out beforne.
King Edwardis man, he was sworn of Ireland,
Of richt law birth suppois he tuik on hand.
To Wallace their, come ane yat hecht Fawdoun,
Of Malancholy, and evil complextioun.
Heavy of stature and dour of contenance,
Sorrowful was ay, in dreid without plesance.
Wallace ressauit, quhat men wald cum him till,
The bodylie aith they maid him with good will.
Befoir the Erll, all in ane good concord,
And him ressauit, as their Capitane and Lord.
His special men, that come with him fra hame,
The taken hecht Gray, the the other Keirly be name.
In his service come first in all their mane,
To Lowdoun hill, quhair yat Fenwik was slane.
He them commandit ay nixt yame to persew,
For he them kend, richt hardy, wise, and true.
His leif he tuik, richt on ane fair maneir,
The good Erll than, he bad him giftis seir.
Wallace wald nane, bot gaif of his feill syis,
To pure and rich, upon ane gudly wyis.
Humbill he was, hardy, wise, and fre,
And of riches he held na property.
Of honor, worschip, he was an em^^rour kend,
As he of gold had abundantly to spend.
Upon his fais he wan it worthily,
Thus Wallace past and his good Cheualry.
Sextie he had of lyklie men at wage,
Throw the Lennox he led yame with curage.
Abone Lekky he ludgit them in ane vaill,
Ane strenth their was, quhilk yai thocht to assaill.
On Cargunnok their biggit was ane ^eill,
That stuffit was with men and vntall weill.
Within ane dyke, Clois, Chalmer, and ^all,
Capitane thairof, to name hecht Thirll wall.
They led Wallace quhair yat this bigg^^ was,
Thocht to assail it far by or ^e wald pas.
Two spyis he send to vesy all the land,
Richt laith he was, the thing to tak on hand.
The quhilk be force, yat should gang him agane,
Rather he had throw adventure been slane.
Their men went forth quhe^ it was large mydnicht
About the house they spyit all at richt.
The wachemen heavy was, and fallin on sleip,
The brig was drawin yat ye entry should keip.
The laubouraris lait reklesly went in,
Their men returnit withouttin noyis or din.
To their Master, and tald quhat they had seen,
Than graithit he sone their men of armis kene.
Sadly on fuit unto the house they socht,
And enterit in, for letting had they nocht.
Wicht men assayit with all their besy cure,
Ane lokkit bar was drawin athort the ^ure.
Bot yai micht nocht it brek out of the waw,
Wallace was greuit quhen he sic tarry saw.
Sum part anoyit, wraithly to it he went,
Be force of handis, it raisit out of the sprent.
Three elne of breid, als of the wall pullit out,
Than meruellit all his men that was about.
How he did mair, than twenty of them micht,
Syne with his fuit, the et he straik up richt.
Quhill brace and bandis he bristit all atanis,
Frayi^lie they raise, that was within yai waynis.
The wache man had ane felloun staf of steill,
At Wallace straik, bot he keipit him richt weill.
Rudely fra him, he reft it in the thrang,
Dang out his harnis, syne in the dyke him slang.
The remanent, be that was on their ^eit,
Thus Wallace sone, can with the Capitane meit.
The sta^ he had, heavy and forgit new,
With yat Wallace upon the heid him drew.
Quhill bane and brane all in sunder eid,
His men enterit, that worthy war in deid.
In handis hynt, and stikkit all the laif,
Wallace commandit, yai should na weirman saif.
Twenty and two, yai stikkit in that steid,
Women and barnis, quhen yat ye men was deid.
He gart be taken, and keipit in clois full weill,
That yai their out, micht have yairof na feill.
The deid bodyis yai put sone out of sicht,
Tuik up the brig or that the day was licht.
In that place daid four dayis or he wald pas,
Wist nane yairout, how that the mane^ was.
Spuileit yat ^teid and tuik them began and geir
Iowellis and gold away with yame they beir.
Quhen he thoc^ ^ time, they Ischit on the ^icht,
To the (...) wod yai went with all yair micht.
The Capitanis wife, women and Chylder three,
Past quhair yai wald, for Wallace left yame fre.
In that Forest he lykit nocht to abide,
They bownit yame ouir Forth for to ride.
The Mos was strange, to ride yan was na bute,
Wallace was wicht, and lichtit on his fute.
Few horse they had lytill thairof yai rocht,
To saif their lyf^s, fell strenthis often they socht.
Steuin of Ireland, he was their gyde that nicht,
Towart Kincardin syne restit their at richt.
In that Forest, quhilk was both lang and wide,
Quhilk fra the Mos grew to the wa^ter side
After the Sone Wallace walkit about,
Upon Tech side, quhair he saw money ane rout.
Of wyld beistis, wauerand in wod and plane,
Sone at ane schot, ane greit Heart hes he slane.
Flew fire of flynt, and graithit yair at richt,
Suddandly their* fresche vennysoun they dicht.
Vittall they had, both breid and wine sa cleir,
With other stuf aneuch at their Denneir.
This staf of steill, he gaif Keirly to keip,
Syne past they ouir, the watter of Tech sa deip.
Into Stratherne they enterit suddandly,
In covert past, or Sutheroun should them spy.
Quhome yat yai fand of Scotlandis aduersouris
Without respect, was cum their fatal houris.
Quhome ever they met, was at the Inglis fay,
They slew all down, withouttin mair delay.
They spairit nane yat was of Inglis blude,
To deith he eid, thocht he was never sa good.
This was the grace that Wallace to yame gaif,
They saifit nane, Knicht, Squyar, nor knaif.
Bot waistit all, be worthynes of weir,
Of that party, that micht beir bow or speir.
Sum part be slicht, sum part be force they flew,
Bot Wallace thocht yai waistit never anew.
Silver they tuik, and als gold as they fand,
Other good geir full lichtly red fra hand.
Cut ^ it throttis, syne in Peitpottis yame kest,
Put out of sicht, for yat yai thocht was best.
At the blak Furde as they should yan pas ouir,
Ane Squyar come, and with him bernis four.
To Down should ride, and wenit yat yai had been
All Inglismen, yat he befoir had seen.
Tythingis to speir, he huwit them amang.
Wallace their with ane good sword out he ^wang
Upon the heid he straik with sa greit Ire,
Throw bane and brane in sunder straik ye fire.
The the other three, in handis sone war him,
Derfly to deith, stikkit or they wald slynt.
The horse they tuik, and quhat they lykit be^^,
Spuileit yame bair, syne in the Gog yame kest.
O^ yis matter na mair tarry they maid,
Bot forth yair way, passit without abaid.
Their weirlyke Scottis, all with ane assent,
Sa North ouir Erne, out throw the land yai went.
In Methuen wod yair ludgeing tuik yat nicht,
Upon the morn, quhen yat ye day was licht:
Wallace raise up, went to the Forest side,
Quhai^ yat he saw full weill beistis abide.
Of wyld and tame, walkand abundantly,
Than Wallace said, this country lykis me.
W^^rmen may do, with fude yat yai should haif,
Bot want yai meit, they rek nocht of ye laif.
Of day^tie fair Wallace tuik never keip,
Bot as it come, welcum was meit and sleip.
Sum time he had greit sufficience within,
Now want, now have, now lois, now win.
Now licht, now sad, now blyith, now in baill,
In haist, now hurt, now sorrow, and now haill.
Now weilda^d weill, now called wedder, now hei^
Now moist, now drouth, now wauerand wynd, now wei^
Sa faires with him, for scotla^des richt full eui^
In fell debait, seuin eirts and monethis seuin,
Quhen he wan piece, and left Scotland in plane,
The Inglismen maid new conqueist agane.
In frustrat termis I will nocht tarry lang,
Wallace agane unto his men can gang.
And said heir is ane land of greit abundance,
Thankit be God of his hie purueyance.
Seuin of ow feiris, graith sone and ga with me,

STeuin of Ireland, as God of heuin the saif,

Keip weill my men, lat nane out of thy sicht
Quhill I gang hidder, sall cum with all my micht
Bide me seuin dayis into this Forest strange,

Sum part e have, and God will send ow mair,
Thus turnit he, and to the town can fair.
The Mair keipit the Port of the Village,
Wallace knew weill, and send him his Message.
The Mair was brocht, saw him ane gudly man,
Richt reverently he hes ressauit them than.
At him he speirit, all Scottis gif e be,
Wallace said e and it is piece trow we.
I grant he said, that lykis us wounder weill,
True men of piece man ay sum freindschip feill.
Quhat is our name? I pray ow tell me it,
William Malcolmesone, he said sen e wald wit.
In Ettrik Forest hes my wynning been,
Their I was borne, amang the Schawis schene.
Now I desire this Northland for to se,
Quhair I micht find better dwelling for me.
The Mair said Schir, I speirit for nane evil,
Bot feill tythingis is often tymis brocht us till.
Of ane Wallace, that was borne in the west,
Our Kingis men he haldis at greit unrest.
Martyris them down, greit piety is to se,
Out of the trewis, forsooth I trow he be.
Wallace said than, we heir speik of that man,
Tythingis of him, to ow tell I nocht can.
For him he gart yan ane Innis graithit be,
Quhair nane should cum, bot his awin men and he.
The Stewart Keirly brocht them in fusioun,
Good thing aneuch, the best was in the town.
Als Inglismen to drinking wald him call,
And commounly he dealt nocht their with all.
In their presence he spendit ressonabilly,
it for him self he payit abundantly.
On Scottis men he spendit mekill good,
Nane with his will upon ye Sutherou^ blude
Sone he consauit, in his wit privately,
Into that town quha was of may party.
Schir James Buttellar, ane agit cruel Knicht,
Keipit Kincleuin, ane Castle wounder wicht.
His Sone Schir Iohne, yat dwelt into ye town,
Under Capitane to Schir Gerard Heroun.
The women als, he vesyit at the last,
And sa on ane, his Ene began to cast.
In the South gait, of fassoun ferly fair,
Wallace to her maid privately repair.
Sa fell it thus, fra the town or he past,
At ane accord, they hapnit at the last.
Wallace with her in secreit maid him glaid,
Sutheroun wist nocht, yat he sic plesance had.
Often on the nicht he wald say to him fell,
This is far war than any pane of hell.
That yus with wrang, yir Deuilles br^kis our la^d
And I with force, may nocht aganis yame stand.
To tak this town, my power is to small,
Greit perrell als of my self may be^all.
Set it in fire, it will undo my sell,
Or lois my men, their is na mair to tell.
The ettis ar cloisit, the dykis ar deip with all,
Thocht I wald swo^ne, forsooth yai can nocht all.
This matter heir, thairfoir I will lat slide,
For in this time, I may na langer bide.
Als men him tauld, the Capitane was to pa^
Hame to Kincleuin, quhairof richt glaid he was.
His leif he tuik a^ Heiris of the town,
To Methuen wod richt glaidly maid him boun.
His horile he hynt, and blyithlie bownit to blaw,
His men him hard, and their sone can yai draw.
Richt blyith he was, for yai war haill and feir,
Money at him for, tythingis wald nocht speir.
He them commandit for to make reddy fast,
In good array out of the wod they past.
Towart Kincleuin, they bownit yame yat tide,
Syne in ane vaill, yat neir was them beside.
Fast upon Tay his buschement he can draw,
In ane derne wod, he stellit them on raw.
Set Scurriouris forth, the country to espy,
Bot sone or none yair come foir Rydaris by.
The wache turnit to se quhat was his will,
He yame commandit, in covert hald them still.
And we skaill forth, the house will knawledge haif
And that may sone be warning to the laif.
All force in weir dois nocht bot greuance,
Wallace was few, bot happy was his chance.
Maid him feill syse his aduersaris to win,
Be that the Court of Inglismen come in.
Four scoir and ten, weill graithit in their geir,
Harnest on horse, as lyklie men of weir.
Wallace saw weill their number was na ma,
He thankit God, and syne the field can ^a.
The Inglis meruellit, greitly quhat yai should be,
Bot fra yai saw yai maid them for melle:
In reist they kest, schairp speiris in that tide,
In ouir yai thocht, outouir the Scottis to ride.
Wallace and his, went cruelly them agane,
At the first rusche feill Sutheroun men war slane
Wallace straik ane with his speir of good steill,
Throw out the coist, ye schaft fruschit Ilk deill.
Ane burneist brand in haist yan hynt he out,
Thryse upon fuit, he thrang throw all the rout.
Stern horse they stikkit, should men of armis beir,
F^y under fuit was fuileit men of weir.
Buttellar lychtit him self for to defend,
With men of armis, quhilk full worthy war kend.
On ather side, feill freikis war fechta^d fast,
The Capitane baid, thocht he was sair aghast.
Part of Sco^tis be worthynes they slew,
Wallace was wa, and towart him he drew.
His men than dred, the Buttellar bald and kene,
On him he socht, with Ire and proper tene.
Upon the heid him straik in matalent,
The burneist blaid, throw out his basnet went.
Both bane and brave, he brystit throw his weid,
Thus Wallace hand, deliuerit yame of that dreid.
it feill on fold was fechtand fellounly,
Steuin of Ireland, and all the Cheualry.
Into that stour did worthily and weill,
And Keirly als, with his good sta^ of steill.
The Inglismen fra their Chiftane was slane,
They left the field, and fled in all their mane.
Three scoir war slane or they wald leif that steid,
The fleand folk that wist of na remeid:
Bot tak the house they fled in all their micht,
The Scottis followit, yat worthy war and wicht
Few men of fence, war left that place to keip,
Women and Preistis upon the wall can weip.
For weill yai wenit, the flearis war their Lord,
To tak them in, they maid them reddy ford.
Leit down the brig kest up the ettis wide,
The frayit folk enterit yat durst nocht bide.
Good Wallace ever, he followit them sa fast,
Quhill in the house he enterit at the last.
The et he wore, quhill cu^mit was all the rout
Of Inglis and Scottis, he held na man yair out.
The Inglismen that wynnit in that steid,
Withouttin grace they bryttinit them to deid.
The Capitanis wife, women and Preistis two,
And oung Chylder, forsooth they sauit na ma.
Held them in clois after this suddand case,
Or Sutheroun men, should seige yame in yat place.
Tuik up the brig, and cloisit ettis fast,
The deid bodyis out of sicht yai gart cast.
Within the house, and outwith that war deid,
Five of his awin to bury he gart leid.
In that Castle seuin dayis still baid be,
And euerilk nicht they spuil eit besylie.
To Schort wod schawis led wine and vittal bricht
Houshald and geir, both gold and silver bricht.
Women and they, quham to he grantit grace,
Quhen he thocht time, they put out of the place.
Quhen they had taken, quhat lykit them to haif,
Straik down the et, and set in fire the laif.
Out of wyndois stanchou^is all yai drew,
Full greit Irne werk into the watter threw.
Buirdin durris, and lokkis in their Ire,
All werk of tree they brynt in to the fire.

The country folk, quhen it was lycht of day:
Greit reik saw rise, and to Kincleuin they socht,
Bot wallis and stane, mair good fand they nocht.
The Capitanis wife to Sanct Iohnstoun scho eid,
And to Schir Gerard tauld yis fellou^ deid
Als to her Sone quhat hapnit was be case,
Than demit they all, yat it was wicht Wallace.
Befoir time their he spyit had the town,
Than chargit they all, they should be reddy boun.
Harnest on horse into their armor cleir,
To seik Wallace, they went all forth in feir.
Ane thousand men weill garneist for the weir,
Towart the wod richt awful in effeir.
Schortwod Schawis. Cap. iij.

With five staillis, yat stalwart war and stout.
The sext yai maid, ane fellou^ Raynge to leid
Quhair Wallace was, full worthy ay in deid.
The strenth he tuik, and bad them hald it still,
On every side assail quha sa will.
Schir Iohne Buttellar into the Forest went,
With two hundredth, fair muifit in his Intent.
His Fatheris deith, to venge him gif he mocht,
To Wallace sone with men of armis he socht.
Ane cleuch their was, quhair of ane strenth they maid,
With thortour treis, and baldly their abaid.
Fra the taken side they micht Ische to ane plane,
Syne throw the wod to the strenth pas agane.
Twenty he had, yat Nobill Archearis wair,
Aganis seuin scoir of Inglis bowmen sair.
Three scoir of speiris neir hand yame baid full richt
Gif Scottis Ischit, to help yame at their micht.
On Wallace set, ane bikker bald and kene,
Ane bow he bair, was big and weill besene.
And arrowis als, both lang and schairp with aw
Na man was yair, yat Wallace bow micht draw.
Richt stark he was, and in full souer geir,
Baldly he schot amang they men of weir.
Ane Angill heid unto the huikis he drew,
Syne at ane schot the formest sone he slew.
Inglis Archearis, that hardy war and wicht,
Amang the Scottis, bikkerit with all their micht
Their awful schot was felloun for to bide,
Of Wallace men they woundit feill that tide.
Few of them was sicker of Archery,
Better they war, and they gat euin party.
In field to bide, outher with sword or speir,
Wallace persauir his men tuik mekill deir.
He gart them change, and stand not in yat steid,
He kest alwayis to saif them fra the deid.
Full greit travel upon him self tuik he,
Of Sutheroun Archearis feill men he gart de.
Of Longcastell Schyre, bowme^ war in yat place
Ane fair Archear ay waittit on Wallace.
At ane oppin, quhair he vsit to repair,
At him he drew ane sicker schot and sair.
Under the Chyn throw ane collar of steill,
On the left side, and hurt his hals sum deill.
Astoneist he was, bot nocht greitly aghast,
Out fra his men, on him he followit fast.
In the turning with good will hes him taken,
Upon the craig, in sunder straik the bane.
Than feill of them, na freindschip with him fand
Fyftene that day, be schot deit with his hand.
Be that his arrowis waistit war and gane,
The Inglis Archearis, forsooth yai wantit nane.
Out with they war, their power to renew,
On euerilk side, to them yai culd persew.
William Lorane come with his busteous staill,
Out of Gowrie on Wallace to assaill.
Neuoy he was, as it was knawin plane,
To the Buttellar, befoir that they had slane.
To venge his Eme, he come in all his micht,
Three hundredth led of men in armis bricht.
To leid the Raynge on fute he maid him ford,
Wallace to God his conscience couth remord.
Syne comfort them with manly countenance,
e se he said, good Schirris their ordinance.
Heir is nane chois, bot outher do or de,
We have the richt, the happyer may it be.
That we sall chaip, with grace out of this land,
The Lorane be that, was reddy at his hand.
Be this it was, after none of the day,
Feill men of wit, to counsall sone eid they.
The Sutheroun kest schairply on euerilk side,
And saw ye wod was nouther lang nor wide.
Lichtly they thocht, he should it hald sa lang,
Five hundredth maid on fuit throw it to gang.
Sad men of armis, that egir war of will,
About the Scottis, with money schout full schill.
With bow and speir, and swordis stif of steill,
On ather side, na freindschip couth they feill.
Wallace in Ire ane buirly brand can draw,
Quhair feill Sutheroun, war semblit on ane raw
To fend his men with his deir worthy hand,
The folk war fey, that he befoir him fand.
Throw the thickest of ye greit preis he past,
Upon his enemeis, he wand wounder fast.
Aganis his dynt, na weidis micht auaill,
Quhome sa he hit, was deid withouttin faill.
Of the feirsest full braithly bair he down,
Befoir ye Scottis, that war of greit Renoun.
To hald ye strenth yai preissit with all yair micht,
Than Inglismen, yat worthy war and wicht:
Schir Iohne Buttellar releuit in agane,
Synderit ye Scottis, and did yame mekill pane.
The Lorane als, that cruel was and kene,
Ane sair assay, forsooth yair micht be seen.
Than at ye strenth yai micht na langer bide,
The Raynge sa strange come upon ather side.
In ye thickest wod yai maid their fell defense,
Aganis their fais, sa full of violence.
Richt feill Sutheroun leuit their life in wed,
To ane new strenth Wallace and his men fled.
On their aduersaris, they maid full feill debait,
Bot help yame self, nane other succor yai wait.
The Sutheroun als, war synderit than in twyn,
Bot they agane togidder sone can wyn.
Full subtelly their ordinance they maid,
The Raynge agane, they bownit but mair abaid.
The Scottis was hurt, and part of yame war slane,
Than Wallace said, we laubour all in vane.
To slay commounis it helpis us richt nocht,
Bot their Chiftanis, that hes yame hidder brocht.
M^cht we wirk swa, yat ane of yame war slane,
Sa sair assay they culd nocht get agane.
Be this the Oist approchand was full neir,
Thus yai them held, full manly upon steir.
Quhen Wallace saw the Sutheroun was at hand
Him thocht na time langer yan for to stand.
Richt manfully he graithit hes his geir,
Sadly he went aganis they men of weir.
Throw out the stour full fast fecht and he socht,
With Goddis grace to venge him gif he mocht.
Upon the Buttellar awfully straik he,
Saifgaird he gat under ane bowand tree.
The branche in two he straik abone his heid,
Als to the ground, and fellit him in that steid.
The haill power upon him come sa fast,
That they be force reskewit him at the last.
Lorane was wa, and thidder fast couth draw,
Wallace returnit, sa suddandly him saw.
Out at ane side full fast to him he eid,
He gat na gyrth for all his burneist weid.
With Ire him straik on his gorget of steill,
The trench and blaid it persit euerilk deill.
Throw plait and stuf, micht nocht aganis it stand
Derfly to deith, he left him on the land.
Him have yai loist, thocht sutherou^ had it sworn,
For his craig bane was all in sunder schorne.
The worthy Scottis did Nobilly that day,
About Wallace, quhill he was won away.
He tuik the strenth aganis their fais will,
Abandoundly in bergane baid them still.
The scry sone raise, the bald Lorane was deid,
Schir Gerard Heroun tranoyntit to that steid.
And all the Oist assemblit him about,
At the North side than Wallace Ischit out.
With his good men, and bownit them to ga,
Thankand greit God, that they war partit sa.
Seuin of his men to deith that day was dicht,
To Cargill wod they went that ^amin nicht.
In the field left of the Sutheroun se^ scoir,
And Lorane als, their murning was the moir.
The Raynge in haist they rayit sone agane,
Bot quhen they saw their travel was in vane:
Quhen he was past full mekill mane they maid,
To ripe the wod, ^aith vaill, slonk, and s^aid.
For Buttellaris gold, Wallace tuik gold befoir,
Bot they fand nocht, wald they seik ever moir.
His horse they gat bot nocht ellis of his geir,
With dulefull mane returnit their men of weir,
To Sanct Iohnstoun with sorrow and greit ^air,
Of Wallace forth me lykis to speik sum mair.
The secund nicht, the Scottis co^^h yame draw,
Richt privately agane to Schort wod schaw.
Tuik up their good quhilk was put out of sicht,
Clei^hing and ^^u^, both gold and silver bricht.
Upon their feit, for hor^ was than them fra,
Or the Sone raise to Methuen wod can ga.
The two dayis ouir yair lugeing still yai maid,
On the third nicht yai mouit but mair abaid.
How Wallace was sauld to Inglismen be his Lemmane. Ca. iiij.
TO Elchok Park full suddandly they went,
Their in yat strenth to bide was his Intent.
Than Wallace said, he wald ga to ye town,
Arrayit him weill intill ane Preistis gown.
In Sanct Iohnstoun disagysit can he fair,
To this woman, the quhilk we spak of air.
Of his presence scho richt reioysit was,
And ay in dreid, how he away should pas.
He Soiornit their fra none was of the day,
Quhill neir the nicht, or yat he went his way.
He trystit her, quhen he should cum agane,
On the third day, than was scho wounder fane.
it he was seen with enemeis as he eid,
To Schir Gerret yai tauld of all this deid.
And to Buttellar, yat wald have wrokin been,
Than yai gart tak, yat woman bricht and schene:
Acomfit her sair of resset in that place,
Feil sysescho swore, yat scho knew nocht Wallace.
Than Buttellar said, we wait weill it was he,
And bot thou tell, in baill fire sall thou de.
Gif thou will help to bring one Rebald down,
We sall the make ane Lady of Renoun.
They gaif to her both gold and silver bricht,
And said scho should be weddit with ane Knicht.
Quhome scho desyrit, yat was but marriage,
Thus temptit yai her, throw counsal and greit wage
That scho yame tald, quhat time he wald be yair,
Than war yai glaid, for they desyrit na mair.
Of all Scotland bot Wallace at their will,
Thus ordand they, ya^ pointment to fulfill.
Fell men of Armis they graithit haistelie,
To keip the ettis wicht Wallace to espy.
At the set tryst he enterit in the Town
Wit and na thing of all this false tressoun.
To her Chalmer he went but mair abaid,
Scho welcu^mit him, and full greit plesance maid.
Quhat that they wrocht I can not graithly say,
Rycht imperfect I am of Venus play.
Bot haistely he graithit him to gang
Than scho him tuke, and speirit gif he thocht lang
Scho askit him that nycht with her to bide
Sone he said nay, for chance that micht betyde
My men ar left at misreull all for me,
I may nocht sleip this nycht quhill I them se.
Than weipit scho, and said full often allace
That I was maid wa worth the cursit case.
Now have I loist the best man that leuand is,
O febill mind to do sa foull ane mis
O waryit wit, wickit and variance,
That me hes broucht in this mischeuous chance.
Allace scho said in world that I was wrocht
Gif all this pane on my self mycht be brocht
I have seruit to be brint in ane gleid,
Quhe^ Wallace saw scho neir fra wit couth weid
In his armis he claucht her soberly,
Quha hes done ocht he said, deir heart, have I?
Na I (quod scho) hes falsely wrocht this trane,
I have ow sauld, richt now e will be slane.
Scho tald to him her tressoun to ane end
As I have said, quhat neidis mair legend.
At her he speirit gif scho forthocht it sair,
e Schir scho said, and sall do ever mair.
My waryit weird in world I mon fulfill,
To mend this mys I wald byrn on ane hill.
He comfort her, and bad her have na dreid,
I will he said have sumpart of thy weid.
Her gown he tuke on him and courcheis als
Will God I sall eschaip this tressoun falls.
I the forgi^ withouttin wordis mair,
He kissit her, syne tuik his leif to fair.
His burely brand helpit him often in neid,
Richt privately hid it under that weid.
To the south et the ganest way he drew,
Quhair that he fand of armit men anew.
To them he tauld diss^^nulit in countenance*
To the Chalmer quhair he was in perchance
Speid fast he said, Wallace is lokkit in
For him they socht without noyis or din.
To that samin house about they can them cast
Out at the et than Wallace gat full fast.
Richt glaid in heart, quhen that he was without
Richt fast he eid, ane sture pais and ane stout^
Two him beheld and said we will ga se
Ane stalwart queen forsooth one semis to be.
They followit him throw the south inche yai two
Quhe^ Wallace saw with yame their come na ma
Agane he turnit, and hes the formest slane,
The the other fled than Wallace with greit mane
Upon the heid with his sword hes him taken
Left yame both deid, ^yne to the strenth him taken
His men he gat richt glaid quhen they him saw
To their defense in haist he gart them draw.
Deuoydit him sone of the woman's weid,
Thus chaipit he out of this felloun dreid.

How Wallace eschaipit out of Sanct Iohnstoun and past to Elchok Park. And how
he slew Faudoun. Ca. j*
THe dark Regioun apperit wonder fast
In November quhen October was past:
The dayis fall throw rycht course worthit schort
To baneist men that is na greit comfort.
With their power seir placis worthis gang,
Heavy they think quhen that the nicht is lang.
Thus Wallace saw the nicht is messingeir,
Phoebus had loist his ^yrie brandis cleir.
Out of the wod they durst nocht turn yat tide,
For aduersaris that in their way wald bide.
Wallace them tauld anew war on his hand
The Inglismen war of the town cu^mand.
The dur yai brak quhair yai trowit Wallace was
Quhen they him myssit they bownit hyne to pas.
In this greit noyis the woman gat away,
Bot to quhat stead, I can not graithly say.
The Suthroun socht richt sadly for that steid
Throw the south inche and fa^d yair two me^ deid
They knew be that Wallace was in the strenth
About the Part they set on breid and lenth:
With sex hundredth weill graithit in their armis
All likly men to wreik them of their harmis.
Ane hundredth men chargit in armis strange,
To keip ane hound that they had them amang.
In Gilder land their was that bratchet bred,
Sicker of sent to follow them that fled.
Scho was sa vsit on Esk and Liddisdaill.
Quhill scho had blude na fleing micht auaill.
Than said they all* Wallace micht nocht away,
He should be thairis for ocht that he do may.
The Oist they left in diverse partis that tide,
Schir Gerard Heroun in the staill can abide.
Schir Iohne Butellar the range he tuke him til
With three hundredth quhilk war of hardy will
Into the wod upon Wallace they eid,
The worthy Scottis that war in mekle dreid
Socht to ane place for to have Ischit out
And saw the staill enuyronit them about.
Agane yai went with hiddeous straikis and strange,
Greit noyis and din was raisit them amang.
Their cruel deith rycht meruellous to ken
Quhair forty matchit aganis three hundredth me^
Wallace sa weill upon him tuik that tide:
Throw the greit preis he maid ane way full wide
Helpand the Scottis with his deir worthy hand
Fell famen he left fey upon the land.
it Wallace loist fyftene into that steid
And forty men of Sutheroun their war deid.
The Butellaris folk sa fruschit war in deid,
The hardy scottis to the strenthis throw yai eid
Upon Tay side they haistit them full fast,
In will they war the watter to have past.
Better him thocht in perrell for to be
Upon the land than wilfully to se
His men to drown quhair reskew mycht be nane
Agane in Ire to the field ar they gane
Butellar be than had put his men in array,
On them he set with awful hardy assay.
On ather side with wappnis stif of steill
Wallace agane na freindschip leit them feill.
Bot do or de they wist na mair succor,
Thus fend they lang into that stalwart stour.
The Scottis Chiftane was oung and in ane rage,
Vsit in weir, and fechtis with curage*
He saw his men of Sutheroun tak sic wrang,
Them to Revenge all dreidles can he gang.
For money of them war bleidand wounder sair
He cou^h nocht se na help appeirand their.
Bot gif their Chiftane war put out of his gait,
The brym Butellar sa bauldly maid debait.
Throw the greit preis Wallace to him socht,
His awful deid he eschewit as he mocht.
Under ane Aik with men about him set,
Wallace micht nocht ane graith straik on him get
it sched he them, ane full rude s^op hes maid*
The Scottis went out, na langer their yai baid.
Steuin of Ireland quhilk hardy was and wicht
To help Wallace he did greit preis and micht.
With true Keirly doucht^e in money deid,
Upon the ground fell Sutheroun gart yai bleid.
Sextie war slane of Inglismen in that place,
And nine of scottis yair tynt war throw yat case
Butellaris men sa distroyit war that tide,
Into the stour he wald na langer abide.
To get supple he went unto the staill,
Thus loist he yair ane hundredth of greit vaill.
As they war best arrayand Buttellaris rout
Betui^ parteis than Wallace Ischit out.
Sextene with him they graithit them to ga,
Of all his men he had leuit na ma.
The Inglismen hes missit him in hy,
The hound they tuke, and followit him haistely.
At the Gask wod full ^ane he wald have been,
Bot this sluth Ratche quhilk cruel was and kene
On Wallace fute followit wounder fast,
Quhill in their sicht they approchit at the last.
Their horse was wicht, had soiornit weill lang,
To the nixt wod two mile they had to gang.
Of vpwith eird they eid with all their micht,
Good hope they had, for it was neir the nicht.
Faudoun he tyrit, and said he micht nocht gang,
Wallace was wa to leif him in that thrang.
He bad him ga and said the strenth was neir,
Bot he thairfoir wald nocht the faster steir.
Wallace in Ire on the craig can him ta,
With his good sword, and straik the heid him fra
Dreidles to ground he duschit to the deid,
Fra him he lap and left him in that steid.
Sum demis it to Ill, and sum to good,
And I say heir into their termis rude:
Better it was he did, as thinkis me,
First to the hound it micht greit stopping be.
Als Faudoun was haldin at greit suspisioun,
For he was knawin of brukill complexioun.
Richt stark he was and had bot lytill gane,
Thus Wallace wist, had he been left allane:
And he war falls to enemeis wald he ga,
Gif he war true the Sutheroun wald him sla
Micht he do ocht, bot tyne him as it was,
Fra this questioun now schortly will I pas.
Deem as e list, e that can best and may,
Bot I reheirs as mine Author will say.
Sternis as than, began for to appeir,
The Inglismen wa^ cu^mand wounder neir.
Five hundredth haill war in that Cheualry,
To the nixt strenth than Wallace can him hy.
Steuin of Ireland vnwittand of Wallace,
And good Keirlie baid still neir hand that place.
At the mure side into ane scrogy slaid,
Be eist Duplin quhair they this tarry maid.
Faudoun was left beside them on the land,
The power come, and suddanly him fand.
For their sluith hound the graith way to him eid
Of other tred as than scho tuik na heid.
The sluith stoppit at Faudoun still scho stude,
Na forther wald, fra time scho fand the blude.
The Inglismen demit for other yai couth not tell,
Bot yat ye Scottis had fochtin amang yame sell
Richt wa they war for loissit was their sent,
Wallace two men amang the Oist in went.
Dissimulit weill, that na man should them ken,
Richt in affeir as they war Inglismen.
Keirlie beheld unto the bauld Heroun,
Upon Faudoun as he was luikand down.
Ane subtle straik vpwart him tuik that tide,
Under the cloik the grundin sword can glyde.
By the good mai^e both craig and hals bane,
In sunder straik, thus endit that Chiftane.
To ground he fell, feill folk about him thrang,
Tressoun they cryit, ane tratour us amang.
Keirly with that slaid out at ane side,
His fellow Steuin than thocht na time to bide.
The fray was greit, and fast away they eid,
Both toward Erne thus chaipit yai that dreid.
Butellar was wa of weiping micht nocht stynt,
Thus reklesly this good Knycht have they tynt.
They demit all that it was Wallace men,
Or ellis him self, thocht they culd nocht him ken.
He is richt neir, we sall him have but ^aill,
The f^^ill wod may lytill him auaill.
Forty their past agane to Sanct Iohnstoun,
With this deid Corpse, to burying maid it boun.
Partit their men, and diverse wayis raid,
Ane greit power at Duplin still their baid.
To Danrich the Butellar past but let,
At sundry furdis the gaitis vmbeset:
To keip the wod quhill it was day they thocht,
As Wallace thus in the thick Forest socht:
For his two men in mind he had greit pane,
He wist nocht weill gif they war taken or slane:
Or chaipit haill be any Iepardie,
Threttene war left, with him na ma had he.
In the Gask hall their ludgeing have they taken,
Fire gat they sone, bot meit than had they nane.
Two scheip they tuik beside them in ane fald,
Ordanit the Supper into that semely hald.
Graithit in haist sum meit for them to dicht,
Sa hard they blaw rude hornis upon hicht.
Two send he forth to luik quhat it micht be,
They baid richt lang, and na tythingis hard he.
Bot busteous noyis sa brymlie blawand fast,
Sa other two in to the wod forth past.
Nane come agane bot busteously can blaw,
Into greit Ire he fend them forth on raw.
Quhen that allane Wallace was left their,
The awful blast aboundit mekill mair.
Than trowit he weill they had his ludging seen,
His sword he drew of Nobill mettell kene.
Syne forth he went quhair yat he hard ye horn
Without the dur Faudoun was him beforne.
As to his sicht, his heid into his hand,
Ane croce he maid, quhen he him sa saw stand.
At Wallace in the heid he swakit their,
And he in haist sone hynt it be the hair.
Syne out at him agane he couth it cast,
Into his heart he was greitly aghast.
Richt weill he trowit that was na spirit of man
It was sum Devil that sic malice began.
He wist nane auaill their langer to abide,
Up throw the hall thus wicht Wallace can glyde
To ane clois stair the burdis raif in twin,
Fyftene fute large he lap forth of that In.
Up the watter suddanly can he fair,
Agane he blent quhat apperance he saw their.
Him thocht he saw Faudoun that ugly Sire,
Upon the house, and all the laif in fire.
Ane greit rufe tree he had into his hand,
Wallace as than na langer wald he stand.
Of his good men full greit meruell had he,
How they war tynt throw this fell fantasy.
Traistis richt weill all this was suith in deid,
Supppois that it na point be of the Creid.
Power they had with Lucifer that fell,
The time that he departit fra heuin to hell.
Be sic mischief gif his men micht be loist,
Drownit or slane amang the Inglis Oist.
Or quhat it was in lyknes of Faudoun,
Quhilk brocht his men to suddand confusioun.
Or gif the man endit in evil Intent,
Sum wickit Spirit agane for him present.
I can not speik of sic Divinity,
To Clerkis I will lat all sic matters be.
Bot of Wallace on forth I will ow tell,
Quhen he was went out of this perrell fell:
it glaid he was that he had chaipit sa,
Bot for his men greit murning can he ma.
Flait be him self to the maker abufe,
Quhy he sufferit he should sic panis prufe.
He wist nocht weill gif it was Goddis will,
Richt or wrang his fortoun to fulfill.
Had it pleisit God he trowit it micht nocht be,
He should him set in sic perplexity.
Bot greit curage in his mind ever draif,
Of Inglismen ane mendis think and to haif.
As he was thus walkand be him allane,
Upon Erne side makand ane pieteous mane.
Schir Iohne Butellar to wache yai furdis richt
Out fra his men of Wallace had ane sicht.
The mist was went, and to the mountanis gane
To him he raid quhair that he maid his mane.
On loud he speirit, quhat art thou walks yis gait
Ane true man Schir, thocht my vayage be lait.
Erandis I pas fra Down unto my Lord,
Schir Iohne Stewart, ye richt quha will record
In Down is now, new cu^min fra the King,
Than Butellar said, this is ane selcouth thing.
Thou leid he said, thou hes been with Wallace,
I sall the know or thou cum of this place.
To him he stert, the Cursour wounder wicht,
Drew out a sword, syne maid him for to licht.
Abone the kne good Wallace hes him taken,
Throw Thee and braune in su^der straik the bane
Derfly to ground the Knicht fell on the land,
Wallace the horse sone sesit in his hand.
Ane akwart straik syne tuke him in that steid,
His craig in two, this was the Butellar deid.
Ane Inglisman saw their Chiftane was slane,
Ane speir in reist he kest in all his mane.
On Wallace draif, fra the horse him to beir,
Warly he wrocht, as worthy man in weir.
The speir he wan, withouttin mair abaid,
On horse he lap, and throw ane greit rout raid.
To Dalrich than he knew the fuird full weill.
Befoir him come feill stuffit in line steill.
He straik the first but baid in the blasoun,
Quhill horse and man all flet the watter down.
Ane other sone down fra his horse he bair,
Strampit to ground, and drownit without mair
The third he hit in his harnes of steill,
Throw out the coist the speir it brak ilk deill.
The greit power than after him can ride,
He saw na wisdom their langer to abide
His burnist brand in hand braithly he bair,
Quhome he hi^ richt, they followit him na mair.
To s^uf the chase few freikis followit fast,
Bot Wallace maid the gayest ay aghast.
The mure he tuke and throw their power eid,
The horse was good, bor it he had greit dreid.
For faileing or he wan to a strenth,
The chase was greit scaillit on breid and lenth.
Throw strange danger they had him ay at sicht,
At the blak furd their Wallace down can licht.
The horse stiffit, the way was deip and lang,
Ane large lang mile wichtly on ^ute can gang.
Or he was horsit rydaris about him kest,
He saw full weill lang sa he micht nocht lest.
Sad men in deid upon him can renew,
Without recovering twenty yat nicht he slew.
The feirsest ay rudely rebutit he,
Keipit his horse, and rycht wisely can fle.
Quhill that he come the mirkest mure amang,
His horse gai^ ouir, and wald na farther gang.
Wallace on fute tuke him with good Intent,
The horse he slew, or that he farther went.
That Inglismen of him should have na good,
And left on fute for weill he understood:
For Sutheroun men of him should have na sicht,
In heich hadder he past with all his micht.
Throw that dark mure fra yame yan hes he socht
Bot suddanly their come into his thocht:
Greit power wo^k at Striuiling brig of tree,
Sichand he said, na passage is for me.
For fault of fude, and I have fastit lang,
On weirmen now, me think na time to gang.
At Cambuskinneth I sall the watter till,
Lat God above do with me quhat he will.
Into this land langer I may nocht bide,
Tarry he maid sumpart on Forthis side.
Tuik of his weid and graithit him but mair,
His swo^d he band, that wounder scharply schair
Amang his geir on his schulders on loft,
Thus in he went, to greit God prayand often.
Of his hie grace his cause to tak on hand,
Ouir the watter he swam to the south land.
Arrayit him sone, the sesoun was richt cauld,
For Piscis was into his dayis auld.
Ouirthort the Kers to the Torwod he eid,
Ane wedow dwelt quhilk helpit him in neid.
Hidder he come or day began to daw,
To ane windo, and privately can caw.
They speirit his name, bot tell yame wald he nocht
Quhill scho her self neir to his langage socht.
Fra time scho wist that it was wicht Wallace,
Reiosit scho was, and thankit God of his grace.
Scho speirit sone quhy he was him allane,
Murnand he said, as now man have I nane.
Scho askit him quhair that his men should be,
Fair Dame he said ga get sum meit for me.
I have fastit sen ister day at morn
I dreid full sair that my men be forlorn.
Greit part of them to the deith I saw brocht
Scho gat him meit in all the haist scho mocht
Ane woman he callit and als with her ane child
And bad them pas agane they wayis wyld.
To the Gask hall tythingis for to speir
Gif part war left of his men in to feir.
And scho should find ane horse sone in her gait
He bad them se gif that place stude in stait,
Thairof to heir he had full greit desire
Because he thocht it was all into fire.
They passit forth withouttin tarry mair
Him for to rest Wallace remainit their.
Refreschit he was with meit drink and heit,
Quhilk causit him throw natural course to sleip
Quhair he should sleip at that woman he speirit
The wedow had three sonnis that war leirit,
First two of them scho send to keip Wallace
He gart the third ga sone to Donypace
And tald his Eme that he was hapnit their,
The Persoun come to se of his weilfair.
Wallace to sleip was laid in the wod side
The two ou^g men without him neir couth bide.
The Persoun come neir hand their manner saw
They bekynnit him to quhat stead he should draw.
The Rone was thick that Wallace sleipit in
About he eid and maid bot lytill din.
Sa at the last of him he had ane sycht
Full privately quhair that his bed was dicht.
He him beheld, syne said unto him sell,
Heir is meruell quha lykis it for to tell.
This is ane Persoun be worthiness of hand
Trowis to stop the power of Ingland.
Now falls Fortoun the miswirkar of all,
Be adventure hes geuin him ane fall.
That he is left without supple of ma
Ane cruel wife with wapins micht him ^la.
Wallace him hard with yat the sleip over past,
Feirfly he raise, and said to him als fast
Thou leis falls Priest war thou ane fa to me,
I wald not dreid sic other ten as the.
I have had mair sen isterday at morn,
Than sic sextie war assemblit me beforne.
His Eme him tuke, and went forth with Wallace,
He tauld to him of all his panefull case.
This nicht he said I was left mine allane
In fell debait with Enemeis money ane.
God at his will hes ay my life to keip.
Over Forth I swame that awful is and deip.
Quhat I have had in weir befoir this day,
Presoun and pane to this nicht was bot play.
Sa bet I am with straikis sad and sair,
The schill watter brynt me mekill mair.
After greit blude throw heit and called was wrocht
That of my life almaist nathing I rocht.
I mean far mair the tynsall of my men,
Nor for my self micht I suffer sic ten.
The Persoun said deir sone thou may se weill,
Langer to strife it helpis nocht adeill:
Thy men ar loist, and ^ane will with the rise,
For Goddis saik make as I sall deuyse.
Tak ane Lordschip quhair on that thou may leif
King Edward will greit landis to the geif.
Vnkill he said of sic wordis na mair,
This is na thing bot ^iking of my cair.
I like better to se the Suthroun de,
Than gold or land that they can gif to me.
Traist thou richt weill of weir I sall not ceis,
Until the time I bring Scotland to peis:
Or de thairfoir in plane to understand
Sa come Keirlie and good Steuin of Ireland,
The Wedowis Sone to Wallace he yame brocht
Fra they him saw of na sadness they rocht.
For perfect Joy they weipit with their Ene,
To ground they fell, and thankit heuinis Queen
Als he was glaid for reskew of them two,
Of their feris leuand war left na ma:
They tauld him that Schir Gerard was deid,
How they had weill eschapit of that steid,
Throw the Oichell they had gane all that nicht,
To Earth ferry quhen that the day was licht.
How ane true Scot throw kyndnes of Wallace
Brocht them ^one over syne kend them to that plac^
Als Ke^^y wist gif Wallace leuand war,
Neir Do^ypais that he should find him their.
The Persoun gart good purueya^ce for yame dicht
In the Torwod they ludgit all that nicht.
Quhill the woman that Wallace north had send,
Returnit agane and tauld him to ane end.
Quhat Inglismen in the way scho fand deid,
Fell was fallin fey in money sindrie steid.
The horse scho saw that Wallace had be reft,
And the Gask hall standand as it was left:
Withouttin harm, not steirit of it ane stane,
Bot of his men good tythingis scho gat nane.
Thairfoir he greuit greitly in that ^yde,
In the Forest he wald na langer abide.
The wedow him gaif part of silver bricht,
Two of her Sonnis that worthy war and wicht.
The third scho left because he laikit age
In weir as than micht nocht wyn vassalage.
The Persoun than gat them good horse and geir
Bot wa he was, his mind was sa in weir,
Thus tuke he leif without langer abaid,
In Dundaf mure the samin nicht he raid.
Schir Iohne ye Grahame quhilk lord was of yat land
Ane agit Knicht had maid nane other ba^d.
Bot purchest peax in rest he micht bide still,
Tribute he payit full sair aganis his will.
A Sone he had both wise worthy and wicht,
Alexander the feirs at Berwik maid him Knicht.
Quhair schawin was of battle to have been,
Betuix Scottis and the bauld Persee kene.
This ou^g schir Iohne richt nobill was in weir,
On ane braid sword his father gart him sweir,
He should be true to Wallace in all thing,
And he to him quhill life in them micht Ring.
Three nychtis their Wallace was out of dreid,
Restit him weill, sa hes he mekle neid.
On the feird day he wald na langer abide
Schir Iohne ye Grahame bownit with him to ride
And he said nay, as than it sulde not be,
Ane plane part it I will not tak on me.
I have tynt men throw my ouir reckles deid,
Ane brynt child als mair sair the fire should dreid.
Freindis sumpart I have in Cliddisdaill,
I will ga se quhat they may me auaill.
Schir Iohne answerit I will our counsall do,
Quhen e think time send privately me to.
Than I sall cum with my power in haist,
He him betaucht unto the haly Gaist.
Sanct Iohne to borgh yai should meit hail and sound,
Out of Dundaf he and his four couth found.
In Bothwell mure that nicht remanit he,
With ane Craufurd yat ludgit him privy.
Upon the morn to the Gilbank he went,
Ressauit he was of money with glaid Intent.
For his deir Eme oung Anchinlek dwelt their,
Brother he was to the Schiref of Air.
Quhen auld Schir Ra^nald to his deid was dicht
Than Anchinlek weddit that Lady bricht.
And Chylder gat, as storyis will record,
Of Lesmahago for he held of that Lord.
Bot he was slane, that piety was the mair,
With Perseis men into the town of Air.
His Sone dwelt still, than nyntene eir of age,
And bruikit haill his Fathers heritage.
Tribute he payit for all his landis braid,
To Lord Persee, as his brother had maid.
I leif Wallace with his deir Vnkill still,
Of Inglismen it sum thing speik I will.
Ane messinger sone throw the country eid,
To Lord Persee, and tauld this felloun deid.
Kincleuin was brynt, brokin and cassin down,
The Capitane deid of it and Sanct Iohnstoun.
The Lorane als in schortwod schawis schene,
Into that land greit sorrow hes been seen.
Throw wicht Wallace yat all this deid hes done
The town he spyit, and that forthocht us sone.
Butellar is slane with douchtie men and deir,
In asper sp^iche the Persee than can speir.
Quhat word of him I pray the graithly tell,
My Lord he said, richt thus the cais befell.
We know for treuth he was left him allane,
And as he fled he slew full money ane.
The horse we fand yat him yat gait couth beir,
Bot of him self nane other word we heir.
At Striuiling brig we wait he passit nocht,
To deith in Forth he may for us be brocht.
Lord Perses said, now suithly that war sin,
Sa good of hand is nane this world within.
Had he taken peax and been our Kingis man,
This haill Impyre he micht have conquest yan.
Greit harm it is our Knychtis that are deid,
We mon gar se for other in their steid.
I trow nocht it that Wallace loissit be,
Our Clerkis sayis he sall gar money de.
The messinger sayis, all that full suith hes been,
Money hundredth that cruel was and kene.
Sen he began ar loist without remeid,
The Persee said forsooth he is nocht deid.
The cruikis of Forth he knawis wounder weill,
He is on life that sall our Natioun feill.
Quhen he is stressit, than can he swome at will,
Greit strenth he hes, both wit and grace yairtill.
Ane messinger the Lord chargit to wend,
And this command in writ he with him send.
Schir Iohne Stewart gart Schiref ya^ be maid
Of Sanct Iohnstoun, and all the landis braid.
Into Kincleuin their dwelt nane syne agane,
Their was nocht bot brokin wallis in plane.
Leif I them thus reuland the landis their,
And speik I will of Wallace glaid weilfair.
He send Keirlie unto Rannald that nicht,
To Boyd and Blair, that worthy war and wicht.
And Adame als, his Cousing good Wallace,
To them declarit all this panefull case.
Of his eschaip out of that company,
Richt wounder glaid war their good Cheualry.
Fra time they wist that Wallace leuand was,
Good expensis they maid to him to pas.
Master Iohne Blair was ane of that message,
Ane worthy Clerk both wise and richt savage.
Leirit he was befoir in Pareis town,
Amang Maisteris in science of good Renoun.
Wallace and he at hame in scule had been,
Sone efterwart as verity was seen:
He was the man that principal vndertuke,
That first compylit in dyte the latin buke.
Of Wallace life richt famous of Renoun,
And Thomas Gray Persoun of Libertoun.
With him they war, and put in Historiall,
Often ane or both mekill of his trauall.
And thairfoir heir I make of them mentioun,
Master Iohne Blair to Wallace maid him down
To se his heill his comfort was the mo^^,
As they full often togidder war befoir.
Silver and gold they gaif him for to spend,
Sa did he them freely quhen God it send.
Of good weilfair as than he wantit nane,
Inglismen wist he was left him allane.
Quhair he should be was nane of them couth say
Drownit or slane or eschaipit away.
Thairfoir of him they tuke bot lytill heid,
They knew him nocht, the les he was in dreid.
All true Scottis greit favor to him gaif,
Quhat good they had he misterit nocht to craif.
The peax lestit that Schir Rannald had ta^e,
They three monethis it should nocht be out gane.
Haill Cristmes Wallace remanit their,
In Lanerk often to sport he maid repair.
Quhen that he went to Gilbank fra the town,
Gif he fand men was of that Natioun.
To Scotland they did never greuance mair,
Sum stikkit they, sum throttis in sunder schair*
Feill war fund deid, bot nane wist quha it was,
Quhome he handlit he leit na farther pas.
Their Hessilrig dwelt, yat cursit Knycht to waill,
Schiref he was of all they landis haill.
Of felloun outrage, dispitefull in his deid,
Money of him thairfoir had mekill dreid.
Meruell he thocht, quha durst his pepill ^la,
Without the town he gart greit number ga:
Quhen Wallace saw that they war ma than he
Than did he nocht bot salust courtes^ie.
Als his four men bure them sa quyetlie,
Na Sutheroun culd deem yame vnhonestlie.
In Lanerk dwelt ane gentill woman their,
Ane madyn myld, as my buik will declair.
Auchtene eir auld, or lytill mair of age,
Als borne scho was to part of heritage.
Her Father was of worschip and renoun,
And Hew Braidfute he hecht of La^mintoun.
As feill was than in the country called,
Befoir time they gentill men war of ald.
Bot this good man and als his wife was deid,
The madin than wist of nane other remeid.
Bot still scho dwelt on tribute in the town,
And purchest had King Edwards protectioun.
Seruandis with her of freindis at her will,
Thus leifit scho without desire of Ill.
Ane quiet house as scho micht hald in weir,
For Hessilrig had done her mekill deir.
Slane her brother quhilk eldest was and Air,
All sufferit scho, and richt lawly her bair.
Amiabill, sa bening war and wise,
Courts and sweit, fulfillit of all gentrice.
Weill reullit of tongue, richt haill of countenance,
Of vertewis scho was worthy to auance.
Humbill her led, and purchest ane good Name,
Of alkin wicht scho keipit her fra blame.
True richteous folk ane greit favor her lent,
Upon ane day to the Kirk as scho went:
Wallace her saw as he his Eye can cast,
The prent of lufe him pruneit at the last.
Sa asperly throw beutie of that bricht,
With greit vneis in presence bide he micht.
He knew full weill her Kinrent and her blude,
And how scho was in honest use and good.
Quhyle wald he think to lufe her ouir the laif,
Ane other quhyle, he thocht on his desaif.
How that his men war brocht to confusioun,
Throw his last lufe he had in Sanct Iohnstoun.
Than wald he think to leave and lat ouir flyde,
Bot that thocht lang in mind micht nocht abide
He tauld Keirlie of his new lust and baill,
Syne askit he him of his true counsall.
Master he said, als far as I have feill,
Of liklynes it may be wounder weill.
Sen e sa lufe, tak her in marriage,
Gudely scho is, and als hes heritage.
Suppois that e in luifing feill ane mis,
Greit God forbid it should be sa with this.
To mary thus I can nocht it attend,
I wald of weir first se ane final end.
I will na mair allane to my lufe gang,
Tak tent to me for dreid I suffer wrang.
To proffer lufe thus sone I wald nocht preif,
Micht I leif of in weir I think to leif.
Quhat is this lufe na thing bot fulischnes,
It may reif me both wit and steidfastnes.
Than said he thus, this will nocht graithly be,
Amouris and weir atanis to regne in me.
Richt suith it is stude I in blis of lufe,
Quhair deidis war I should the better prufe.
Bot weill I wait quhair greit ernist is in thocht,
It lattis weir in ye wysest man was wrocht.
Les gif it be bot a^erly till ane deid,
Than he that thinkis of lufe to speid.
He may do weill, have he fortoun and grace,
Bot this standis all in ane other case.
Ane greit Kinrik with feill fais ouirset,
Richt hard it is amendis for to get.
A^anis of them, and keip the observance,
Quhilk belangis lufe, and all his freuoll chance.
Exempill I have, that me forthinkis sair,
I trow to God it sall be sa na mair.
The treuth I know of this and her lynnage,
I knew nocht her, thairfoir I loissit ane gage.
To Keirlie he thus arguit in this kind,
Bot greit desire remaning in his mind.
For to behauld that freely of fassoun,
Ane quhyle he left, and come nocht in the town.
On other thing he maid his wit to wa^k,
Preuand gif he micht of that langour s^aik.
Quhen Keirlie saw he sufferit pane for thy,
Deir Schir he said, e leif in slogardy.
Sa se our lufe, than sall e get comfort,
At his counsall he walkit for to sport.
Unto the Kirk quhair scho maid residence,
Scho knew him weill, bot as of eloquence
Scho durst nocht weill in presence to him kyth,
Full sair scho dred that Sutheroun should her myth
For Hessilrig had ane matter new begune,
And her desyrit in marriage to his Sone.
With her madin thus Wallace scho besocht,
To dyne with her, and privately scho him brocht.
Throw ane gardin scho had gart wirk of new,
Sa Inglismen nocht of their meting knew.
Than kissit he this may glaidly with plesance,
Sone her besocht richt hartly of acquentance,
Scho answerit him with humbill wordis and wise
War my acquentance richt worthy for to pryse:
e sall it have as God me saif in saill,
Bot Inglismen garris our power faill.
Throw violence of them and their bairnage,
That hes weill neir distroyit our lynage.
Quhen Wallace hard her complain pieteously,
Greuit in heart he was richt gretumly.
Both Ire and lufe him set into ane rage,
Bot nocht for thy he soberit in curage.
Of his matter he tauld as I said air,
To that gudely how lufe constraint him sair.
Scho answerit him richt ressonablie agane,
And said I sall to our service be bane.
With all plesance in honest causis haill.
And I traist nocht e wald set to assaill.
For our worschip to do me dishonor,
And I ane Maid, and standis in money stour.
Fra Inglismen to saif my womanheid,
And coist hes maid to keip me fra their feid*
With my good will, I will na Lemman be,
To na man borne, thairfoir me think should e.
Desire me nocht bot into gudlynace,
Perchance e think I war to law percace.
For to attend to be our richteous wife,
Into our service I wald use all my life.
Heir I beseik for our worschip in armis,
e charge me nocht with na ungodly harmis.
Bot me defend for worschip of our blude,
Quhen Wallace weill her true taill understood:
As in ane part him thocht it was ressoun,
Of her desire thairfoir to conclusioun.
He thankit her, and said gif it micht be,
Throw Goddis will that our Kinrik be fre.
I wald ow wed with all hartly plesance,
Bot at this time I may nocht tak sic chance.
And for this cause nane other now I craif,
Ane man in weir may nocht all plesance haif.
Of their talk than can I tell ow na mair,
To my purpois quhat band that they maid their.
Conclude they thus, and to the Denner went,
The sair greuance remanit in his Intent.
Lois of his m^n and lusty pane of lufe,
His leif he tuke at that time to remufe.
How Wallace past to Lochmabane, and how they cuttit his horse taillis, and how
he schaif the blude latter. Ca. ij.
SYne to Gilbank he past or it was nicht,
Upon ye morn with his four me^ him dicht
To the Corheid without resting he raid,
Quhair his Neuoy Thom Haliday him abaid.
And Edward Lytill als his Cou^ing deir,
Quhilk was ^a blyith quhen he wist him sa neir.
Thankand greit God he send them saif agane,
For money demit he was in Stratherne slane.
Good cheir they maid all out they dayis three,
Than Wallace said that he desyrit to se:
Lochmabane town, and Inglismen yat was yair
On the feird day they bownit them to fair.
Sextene he was of gudly Cheualry,
In the Knok wod he leifit all bot three.
Thomas Haliday went with him to the Town
Edward Lytill and Keirly maid them bown.
To ane Oistler Thomas Haliday led yame richt,
And gaif command yair Denner should be dicht.
To heir ane Mes in good Intent they eid,
Of Inglismen they trowit their was na dreid.
Ane Cliffurd come was Emis Sone to the Lord
And three with him, in treuth for to record.
To their Innis sone after Wallace past,
Quha aucht they horse in greit hething he ast^
The good wife said for to have pleist him best,
Three gentill men ar cu^min out of the west.
Quha Devil them maid sa gaylie for to ride,
In faith with me ane wed their mon abide.
Their lewit Scottis hes leirit lytill good,
Lo all their horse ar schent for fault of blude.
Into greit scorn for outtin wordis mair,
The taillis all of they three horse they schair.
The good wife cryit, and pieteously couth greit,
Sa Wallace come, and couth the Capitane meit.
Ane woman tauld him they had his horse schent
For proper Ire he grew in matalent.
He followit fast, and said good freindis abide,
Service to tak for thy craft in this tide.
Marchell thou art without command of me,
Reward agane me think I should pay the.
Sen I of lait new come out of the west,
In this country ane harbor of the best.
To cut and schaif and that ane wounder good,
Now thou sall feill how I use to lat blude.
With his good sword the Capitane hes he taken,
Quhill horse agane he merchellit never nane.
Ane other sone upon the heid straik he,
Quhill chaftis and cheik upon the gait can fle.
Be that his men the the other three had slane,
Their horse they tuke, and graithit yame full bane
Out of the Town, for Denner baid they nane,
The wife he payit, that maid sa pieteous mane.
Than Inglismen fra that Chiftane was deid,
To Wallace socht fra money sindrie steid.
Of the Castle come cruel men and kene,
Quhen Wallace hes their suddand semblie seen.
Towart sum strenth he bownit him to ride,
For than him thocht it was na time to b^de.
His horse bled fast that gart him dreding haif,
Of his good men he wald have had the laif.
To the Knok wod withouttin mair they ra^d,
Bot into it na Soiorning he maid.
That wod as than was nouther thick nor strange
His men he gat, syne lichtit he to gang.
Towart ane hicht, and led their horse ane quhyle,
The Inglismen war than within ane mile.
On fresche horse rydand full haistely,
Seuin scoir as than was in that cumpany.
The Scottis lap on quhen they that power saw,
Frawart the south them thocht it best to draw.
Than Wallace said, it is na wit in weir,
With our power to bide them bargane heir.
^ne ar good men, thairfoir I reid that we,
Innermair seik, quhill God send us supple.
Haliday said, we sall do our counsel,
Bot sair I dreid that their hurt horse will ^aill.
The Inglismen in burnist armor cleir,
Be than to them approchit wounder neir.
Horsit Archearis schot and wald nocht spair,
Of Wallace men they woundit two full sair.
In Ire he grew quhen that he saw them bleid
Him self he turnit, and on them sone he eid.
Sextene with him that worthy was in weir,
Of the formest richt scharply down they beir.
At that return fyftene in field was slane,
The laif they fled unto their power agane.
Wallace followit with his good Cheualry,
Thomas Haliday in weir was full besy.
Ane buschement saw, that cruel was and kene,
Two hundredth haill of weill graithit Inglismen.
Vnkill he said, our power is to smaw,
Fra this plane field I counsall ow to draw.
To few we are aganis one felloun staill,
Wallace returnit full sone at his counsel.
At the Corheid full fane they wald have been,
Bot Inglismen hes weill their purpois seen.
In plane battle them followit hardely,
In danger thus they held them awfully.
Hew of Morland Wallace followit fast,
He had befoir maid money Scot aghast.
Haldin he was, of weir the worthiest man,
In north Ingland with them was leuand yam*
In his armor weill forgit of fine steill,
Ane nobill cursour bure him both fast and weill.
Wallace returnit beside ane burely Aik,
And on him set ane felloun sicker straik.
Both collar bane and schulder blaid in two,
Throw the mid coist ye good sword gart he ga.
His speir he wan, and als his cursour bricht,
Syne left his awin for loissit was his micht.
For laik of blude he micht na farther gang,
Wallace on horse the Sutheroun men amang.
His men releuit, that douchtie war in deid,
Him to reskew out of that felloun dreid.
Cruel straikis forsooth their micht be seen,
On ather side quhill blude ran on the grene.
Richt perrillous the semblay was to see,
Hardy and hait continewit the mellee.
Schow and reskew of Scottis and Inglis als,
Sum keruit bane in sunder, and sum the hals.
Sum hurt sum hynt, sum doungin to the deid,
The hardy Scottis sa steirit in that steid.
With Haliday on fute that bauldly abaid,
Amang Sutherou^ ane full greit rowme yai maid
Wallace on horse hynt ane Nobill speir,
Out throw them raid, as good Chiftane in weir
Three slew he their or that his speir was gane,
Thus his good sword in hand hes he taken.
Dang on derf^y, with straikis sad and sair,
Quhome that he hit, greuit the Scottis na mair.
Fra Sutheroun men be natural ressoun knew,
How with ane straik ay ane man he slew.
Than meruellit they, he was sa mekill of mane,
For their best man in that kind he had slane.
That his greit strenth agane him helpit nocht,
Nor nane other incontrair Wallace socht.
Than said they all leif he in strenth vntane,
This haill Kinrik he will wyn him allane.
They left the field, and to their power fled,
And tauld their Lord how evil the formest sped.
Quhilk Graystok hecht, was new cum in ye land
Thairfoir he trowit nane durst agane him stand.
Wounder him thocht, quhen yat he saw that sicht
Quhy his good men for sa few tuik the flicht.
At that return in field twenty war tynt,
And Morland als thairfoir he wald nocht stynt.
Bot followit fast with three hundredth but dreid,
And swore he should be vengit of that deid.
The Scottis wan horse, because yair awin couth faill,
In fleing syne cheisit the may auaill.
Out of the field thus wicht Wallace is gane,
Of his good men he had not loissit ane.
Five woundit war, but lichtly forth they raid,
Wallace ane space behind yame ay abaid.
And Halyday preuit weill in money place,
Sister Sone he was to good Wallace.
Warly they raid, and held their horse in aynd,
For they trowit weill the Sutheroun wald affaynd.
With haill power atanis on them set,
Bot Wallace kest their purpois for to let.
To brek their ray he vesyit him full fast,
Than Inglismen sa greitly was aghast.
That nane of them durst rusche out of the staill,
All in array togidder held them haill.
The Sutheroun saw how that abandounly,
Wallace abaid neir hand their Cheualry.
Be Morlandis horse yai knew him wou^der weill
Past to their Lord, and tauld him ever ilk deill.
Lo Schir they said, forsooth one same is he,
That with his handis garris sa money de.
Have his horse grace upon his feit to bide,
He doutis nocht throw five thousand to ride.
We reid e ceis, and follow him na mair,
For dreid that we repent it syne full sair.
He blamit them, and said men may weill se,
Cowartis e ar that for sa few wald fle.
For their counsall it leif wald he them nocht,
Into greit Ire he on them sadly socht.
Wailla^d ane place quhair yai micht bargane make
Wallace was wa upon him for to tak.
And he sa few to bide them on ane plane,
At Quenisbery he wald have been full fane.
Upon him self he tuke full greit travel,
To fend his men, gif that micht him auaill.
Ane sword in hand richt manlyke him to weir,
Ay waittand fast gif he micht get ane speir.
Now heir now their, befoir them to and fra,
His horse gaif ouir, and micht na farther ga.
Richt at the Skirt of Quenisbery befell,
Bot upon grace as mine author will tell.
Schir Iohne ye Grahame yat worthy was and wicht
To ye Corheid come on ye other nicht.
Threttie with him of Nobill men at wage,
The first douchter he had in marriage:
Of Haliday was neuoy to Wallace,
Tythingis to speir Schir Iohne past of ye place.
With men to speik quhair they ane tryst had set,
Richt neir the steid quhair Scottis and Inglis met
Ane Kirkpatrik, that cruel was and kene,
In E^daill wod that half ane eir had been.
With Inglismen he tuld nocht weill accord,
Of Torchorwald he Barroun was and Lord.
Of Kin he was to Wallace Mother deir,
On Craufurd side, that mekill had to steir.
Twenty he led of worthy men and wicht,
Be than Wallace approchit to their sicht.
Schir Iohne ye Grahame quhe^ he ye cou^ter saw
On them he raid, and stude bot lytill aw.
His good Father he knew richt wounder weill,
Kest down his speir, and soneit nocht adeill.
Kirkpatrik als with worthy men in weir,
Fyftie in front atanis down they beir.
Throw the thickest of three hundredth they raid,
On Sutheroun side ^ull greit slauchter yai maid
Them to reskew that was in felloun thrang,
Wallace on fute the greit power amang.
Good rowme he gat throw help of Goddis grace
The Sutheroun fled, and left them in that place
Horsis they wan to stuf the chase good speid,
Wallace and his that douchtie war in deid.
Graystok tuke flicht, on stern horse and on stout,
Ane hundredth held togidder in ane rout.
Wallace on them full sadly culd persew,
The fleing weill of Inglismen he knew.
That ay the best wald pas with their Chiftane,
Befoir him ^a^d he good schir Iohne ye Grahame.
Ay strykand down quhome ever he micht hy,
Than Wallace said, this is bot waist folly.
Commounis to slay, quhair Chiftanis gais away
our ho^s ar fresche, thairfoir do as I say.
Good men e have ar it in Nobill stait,
To one greit rout for Godis lufe hald our gait.
Sinder them sone, we sall cum at our hand,
Quhen schir Iohne had his taill weill understand.
Of nane other fra thynefurth tuke he heid,
To the formest he followit weill good speid.
Kirkpatrik als considderit their counsel,
They chargit their men ay follow on the staill.
At his command full sone with them they met,
Sad straikis and ^air sadly upon them set.
Schir Iohne the Grahame to Graystok fast he socht,
His Pesane yan it helpit him richt nocht.
Upon the craig ane graith straik gat him richt,
The burly blaid was braid, and burnist bricht.
In sunder ker^it the maileis of fine steill,
Throw braun and bane it ruschit euerilk deill.
Deid with that dynt to the ground down him draif
Be that Wallace assemblit on the laif.
Derflie to deith feill freikis their he dicht,
Raise never agane quha ever that he hit richt.
Kirkpatrik than, Thom Haliday and their men
Their douchtie deidis war Nobill for to ken.
At the Knok heid the bald Graystok was slane,
And money men quhilk war of mekill mane.
To saif their lyfis part in the wod they past,
The Scottis men they ran togidder fast.
Quhe^ Wallace with Schir Iohne ye Grahame met,
Richt gudly he with hu^bilnes him great.
Perdoun he askit of the reprufe be^oir,
Into the chase, and said he should no moir
Informatioun make to him that was sa good,
Quhen that Schir Iohne Wallace weill understood.
Do way he said, yairof as now na mair,
e did full richt, it was for our weill fair.
Wyser in weir e ar all out than I,
Father in armis e ar to me for thy.
Kirkpatrik syne that was his Cousing deir,
He thankit him richt on ane good maneir
Nocht ane was loist of all their Cheualry,
Schir Iohne ye Grahame to yame come happily
The day was done, approchand was the nicht,
At Wallace they askit his counsall richt.
He answerit thus, I speik bot with our leif,
Richt laith I war any good man to grief.
Bot thus I say in termis schort for me,
I wald assaill gif e think it may be.
Lochmabane house, quhilk now is left allane,
For weill I wait that power in it is nane.
Carlauerok als it Maxwell hes in hand,
And we had this, they micht be both ane wand.
Aganis Sutheroun, that now hes our country,
Say quhat e will, this is the best think me.
Schir Iohne the Grahame gaif first his good consent
Syne all ye laif richt with ane hail Intent.
To Lochmabane richt haistely they ride,
Quhen yai come yair nocht half ane mile beside:
The nicht was mirk, to counsall ar they gane,
Of Moan or Stern apperance was yair nane.
Than Wallace said, me think this land at rest,
Thom Haliday thou knawis the country best.
I heir na noyis of feill folk heir about,
Thairfoir I trow we are the les in dout.
Haliday said, I will tak ane with me,
And ride befoir the manner for to se.
Watsone he callit, with me thou make the bown,
With yame thou was ay nichtbour in yis town.
I grant I was with them aganis my will,
And mine Intent is ever to do them Ill.
Unto the et they two peirtly forth raid,
The Portar come without langer abaid.
At Iohne Watsone tythingis culd he speir,
Oppin he bad, the Capitane cu^mis neir.
The e^ but mair unwisely up he drew,
Thom Haliday sone be the craig him threw.
And with ane knyfe stikkit him to deid,
In ane dark hoill down dreidles kest him deid.
Iohne Watsone hes hynt the keyis in his hand,
The Portar ya^ with wicht Wallace was cu^mand
They enterit in, befoir them fand na ma,
Except women and simpill seruandis two.
In the kiching lang scudlaris had they been,
Sone they war slane, quhen the Lady had seen.
Scho cryit grace for him that deit on tree.
Than Wallace said, Madame our noyis lat be.
To women it we do bot lytill evil,
And oung childer we like nocht for to spill.
I wald have meit, Haliday quhat sayis thou,
For fastand folk to dyne good time war now.
Greit pur^iance was ordanit them befoir,
Both breid and aill, good wine, and other stoir.
To meit they bownit, for they had fastit lang,
Good men of armis unto the clois gart gang.
Part fleand folk on fute they fra them glaid,
On the Knok heid quhair greit melle was maid:
Ay as they come Iohne Watsone leit them in,
And done to deith, without noyis or din.
Na man left their that was of Ingland borne,
The Castle weill they vesyit on the morn.
For Iohnstoun send ane man of good degree,
Secund dochter forsooth weddit had he.
Of Halidayis, deir Neuoy to Wallace,
Greit Capitane they maid him of that place.
They left him their into ane good array,
Syne Ischit forth upon the secund day.
Women had leif in Ingland for to fair,
Schir Iohne ye Grahame, and good Wallace culd cair.
To the Corheid, and ludgit yame yat nicht,
Upon the morn the Sone was at the hicht.
After Denner they wald na langer bide,
Their purpois tuke in Craufurd mure to ride.
Schir Iohne ye Grahame with Wallace yat was wicht,
Thom Haliday agane returnit richt.
To the Corhall, and their remanit but dreid,
Na Sutheroun wist principal quha did yis deid
Kirkpatrik past in Eskdaill woddis wide,
In saiftie their, he thocht he should abide.
Schir Iohne ye Grahame, and good Wallace in feir
With them forty men of armis cleir.
Throw Craufurd mure as that they tuke ye way
On Inglismen their mind remanit ay.
How Wallace wan ye Castle of Craufurd, and how he slew the Capitane thairof.
Ca. iij.
FRa Craufurd Iohne ye watter down yai ride
Neir hand the nicht they lichtit upon Clyde.
Their purpois tuke into ane quiet vaill,
Than Wallace said, I wald we micht assaill:
Craufurd Castle with sum good Ieopardie,
Schir Iohne ye Grahame how say e best may be
This good Knicht said, and ye men war without,
To tak the house their is bot lytill dout.
Ane Squyar than, reullit that Lordschip haill,
Of Cu^birland borne, his name was Mortindaill.
Than Wallace said, my self will pas in feir,
And ane with me, of herbery for to speir.
Follow on dreich, gif that we myster ocht,
Edward Lytill with his Master forth soche.
To ane Ostillary, and with ane woman met,
Scho tauld to yame yat Sutheroun yair was set
And e be Scottis I counsall ow pas by,
For and they may e will get evil herbery.
At drink they ar, sa have they been richt lang,
Greit word their is of Wallace them amang.
They trow that he hes fund his men agane,
At Lochmabane feill Inglismen a^ slane.
That house is tynt, that garris them be full wa
I trow to God that they sall sone tyne ma.
Wallace speirit of Scotland gif scho be,
Scho said him ee, and thinkis it to se,
Sorrow on them throw help of Goddis grace,
He askit her quha was into the place.
Na man of fence is left that house within,
Twenty ar heir make and greit noyis and din.
Allace scho said, gif I micht anis se,
The worthy Scottis in it may master be.
With this woman he wald na langer stand,
Ane bekin he maid, Schir Iohne come at his hand
Wallace went in and said benedicite,
The Capitane speirit, quhat bella^ny may thou be.
That cu^mis sa grym sum tything is to us tell,
Thou art ane Scot, the Devil thy natioun quel.
Wallace braid out his sword withouttin mair,
Into the breist the brym Capitane he bair.
Throw out the coist, and stikkit him to d^id,
Ane other he hit akwart upon the heid.
Quhome ever he straik he bris^it bane and lyre,
Feill of them deit, fell flatlingis in the fire.
Haistie payment he maid them on the ^lure,
And Edward Lytill keipit weill the dure.
Schir Iohne ye Grahame fane wald have been in
Edward him bad at the Castle begin.
For of their folk we have bot lytill dreid,
Schir Iohne ye Grahame fast to the Castle eid
Wallace rudely sit routis on them gaif,
They twenty men derfly to deith they draif.
Fyftene he straik, and fyftene hes he slane,
Edward slew five, quhilk was of mekill mane.
To the Castle Wallace had greit desire,
Be that Schir Iohne had set the house in fire.
Nane was their in that greit defense culd ma,
Bot women fast sair weip and into wa.
Without the place ane auld Bulwark was maid,
Wallace eid ouir withouttin langer abaid.
The women sone he saifit fra the deid,
Waik folk he put, and barnis fra that steid.
Of purueyance he fand lytill or nane,
Befoir yat time their victual all was gane.
it in that place they ludgit all that nicht,
Fra Oistillary brocht sic good as they micht.
Upon the morn housis they spuleit fast,
All thing that docht out of that place they cast.
Treme wark yai brynt, yat war within yai vanis
Wallis brak down that stalwart war of stanis.
Spilt that they micht, syne wald na langer bide,
Unto Dundaf that samin nicht they ride.
And ludgit their with mirth and all plesance,
Thankand greit God yat lent yame sic good chance

In this Sext Buik is declarit the Spousage of Wallace, and how Hessilrig slew
Wallace wife in the Town of Lanerk, and how he ^ew Hessilrig for the samin
cause, and put the Inglismen out of Lanerk.
THan passit was the Octauis of Februar,
And part of March be richt degestioun
Appeirit than the last Month of Ver,
The Sign of Somer with his sweit sesoun.
Be that Wallace fra Dundaf maid him boun,
His leif he tuke, and to Kilbank can fair
The rumor raise throw Scotland up and down,
With Inglismen, that Wallace leuand wair.
Into Apryle quhen cleithit is but wene,
The abill ground throw wirking of natour
And woddes hes won yair worthy weides of grene
Quhen Nympheus in beilding of his bour.
With oil and balm fulfillit of sweit odor,
Canettis in ^race, as they war wont to gang.
Walkand their course in every casual hour,
To glaid the huntaris with their merry sang.
In this same time to him approchit new,
His lusty pane the quhilk I spak of air
Be luifis case he thocht for to persew,
In Lanerk Town, and hidder can he fair.
At residence ane quhyle remanit their,
In her presence as I have said befoir
Thocht Inglismen greuit at his repair,
it he desyrit the thing that set him soir.
The fire of lufe him reullit at sic wise,
He lykit weill with that gudely to be,
Quhylis he wald think of danger for to rise,
And other quhylis out of her presence fle.
To ceis of weir it war the best for me,
Thus win I nocht bot sadness on ilk side
Sall never man this cowardnes in me se,
To weir I will, for chance that may betyde.
Quhat is this lufe, it is bot greit mischance?
That me wald bring fra armis verrily,
I will nocht change my worschip for plesance
In weir I think my time to occupy.
it her to lufe, I will nocht let for thy,
Mair I sall desire my worschip to refer^
Fra this day forth, than ever mair did I,
In feir of weir quhidder I leif or sterf.
Quhat should I say, Wallace was planely set,
To lufe her best in all the warid sa wide,
Thinkand he should of his desire to get*
And sa befell be concord on ane tide.
That scho was maid at his command to bide,
And thus began the stynting of his strife.
The band begun with graith witness beside
Mine Author sayis scho was his weddit wife.
Now leif in peax, now leif in good concord,
Now leif in play, now leif in haill plesance
For scho be chance hes both her lufe and Lord,
He thankis lufe that did him sa auance.
Sa eninly held be favor the balance,
Sen he at will may lap her in his armis
Scho thankit God of her hie happy chance,
For in his time he was the flour of armis.
Fortoun him schew her figurit doubill face,
Feill syse or than he had been set abufe.
In presoun now deliuerit now throw grace,
Now at vneis, now at unrest and rufe.
Now weill at will weild and his plesand lufe,
And thocht him self out of adversity,
Desyrand ay his manheid for to prufe
In curage set upon the stagis hie.
The verray treuth I can nocht graithly tell,
Into this life how lang that they had been
Throw natural course of generatioun fell,
Ane child was cheuit their two luifaris between
Quhik gudelie was, ane madin bricht and schene.
Sa farther forth become time of her age,
Ane Squyar schaw yat yan full weill hes seen
This life lait man gat her in marriage.
This other maid weddit ane Squyar wicht,
Quhilk weill was knawin cummin of Balliollis blude
And their Airis be line succedit richt,
To La^mintoun and other landis good.
Of this matter the richt quha understood
Heirof as now I will na mair proceid,
Of my sentence than schortly to conclude
Of other thing my purpois is to reid.
Richt gudely men come of this Lady ing,
Farther as now of them I speik na mair
Bot Wallace forth into his weir can ring
He micht nocht ceis greit curage sa him bair.
Sutheroun to slay for dreid he wald nocht spair,
And they often syse feill causis to him wrocht
Fra that time forth quhilk mouit him mair sair.
That never in world out of his mind was brocht
Now leif thy mirth, now leif thy haill plesance
Now leif thy blis, now leif thy chyldis age
Now leif thy outh, now follow thy hard chance
Now leif thy lust, now leif thy marriage.
Now leif thy lufe, for thou sall tyne ane gage,
Quhilk never in eird salbe redemit agane
Felloun fortoun and all her feirs outrage
Go leif in weir, go leif in cruel pane.
Fie on fortoun, fie on thy freuoll quheill,
Fie on thy traist, for heir it hes no lest
That sa tra^sfigurit Wallace out of his weill
Quhen he traistit for to have leuit best.
His plesance heir to him was bot ane gest,
Throw thy feirs course, that hes na hap to ho.
Him thou ouirthrew out of his lykand rest,
Fra greit plesance, in weir travel and woe.
Quhat is fortoun, quha drawis the dait sa fast?
We wait their is both weill, and wickit chance.
Bot this false world with money doubill cast,
In it is nocht bot verray variance.
It is na thing to heuinly governance,
Than pray we all to the maker abufe
Quhilk hes ^and of Justice the balance,
That he us grant it of his deir lestand lufe.
Heirof as now, farther I speik na mair, Bot to my purpois schortly will I fair.
TVelf hundredth eir, thairto nyntie and seuin,
Fra Christ was borne the richteous King of heuin.
Williame Wallace into good lyking gais
In Lanerk town amang his mortal fais.
The Inglismen that ever falls hes been,
With Hessilrig quhilk cruel was and kene.
And Robert Thorn ane felloun subtle Knicht*
Hes fund the way be quhat mean best they micht
How that they should make contrary to Wallace,
Be argument as he come upon case.
On fra the Kirk that was without the town,
Quhill their power micht be in armis boun.
Schir Iohne ye Grahame yat worthy was and true
To Lanerk town good Wallace to persew.
Of his weilfair as he full often had seen,
Good men he had, in cumpany fyftene.
And Wallace nine, they war na feiris ma,
Upon the morn unto the Mes can ga.
They and their men graithit in gudely grene,
For the sosoun sic use full lang hes been.
Quhen sadly they had said their deuotioun,
Ane arguit them, as they went throw the town.
The starkest man that Hessilrig than knew,
And als he had of lichtly wordis anew.
He salust them as it war bot in scorn,
Dew guard good day, bone seneour and good morn
Quhome scornis thou (quod Wallace) quha leirit thee?
Quhy schir he said, come e not ouir ye see?
Pardoun me than for I weind e had been,
Ane Ambaxat to bring ane uncouth Queen.
Wallace answerit, sic pardoun as we haif,
In us to gif thy part thou sall nocht craif.
Sen e ar Scottis, it salust sall e be,
Good euin daucht Lord, Ballanch Baneochade.
Ma Sutheroun men to them assemblit neir,
Wallace was laith as than to make ane steir.
Ane maid ane skrip, and tit at his lang sword,
Hald still thy hand (quod he) and sp^ik thy word.
With thy lang sword thou makis mekill boist,
Thairof (quod he) thy dame maid lytill coist.
Quhat cause hes thou to weir yat gudely grene?
My may cause is, bot for to make the tene.
Quhat should ane Scot do with sa fair ane knyfe?
He said the Priest that last Ianglit thy wife:
That woman lang hes callit him sa fair,
Quhill that his child worthit to be thine air.
Me think (quod he) thou dryfis me ^o scorn,
They dame was Iapit or thou was borne.
The power than assemblit him about,
Two hundredth men that stalwart war and stout
The Scottis saw their power was cu^mand,
Schir Robert Thorn and Hessilrig at hand.
Greit multitude with wappinis burneist been,
The worthy Scottis quhilk cruel war and kene
Amang Sutheroun sic dyntis gaif that tide,
Quhill blude on breid, bristit fra woundis wide.
Wallace in stour was cruelly fechtand,
Of ane Sutheroun he smoit of the richt hand.
And quhen that Carll of fechting micht na ^air,
With the left hand in Ire held ane buklair.
Than fra the stump the blude out sprang full fast,
In Wallace face abundantly can it cast.
Into greit part it marrit him of his sicht,
Schir Iohne ye Grahame ane straik hes taken him richt
With his good sword upon ye sutheroun sire
Derfly to deith draif him into that Ire.
The perrell was richt awful hard and strange,
The stour indurit meruellously and lang.
The Inglismen it gadderit wounder fast,
The worthy Scottis the gait left at the last.
Quhen they had flane and woundit money ane,
To Wallace Innis the ganest way they gane.
They passit sone, defendit them richt weill,
He and Schir Iohne with swordis stif of steill.
Behind their men, quhill they the et had taken,
This woman than quhilk was full will of wane.
The perrell saw with felloun noyis and din,
Set up the et, and leit them enter in.
Throuch to ane strenth they passit of that steid,
Fyftie Sutheroun upon the gait lay deid.
This fair woman with besynes and micht,
The Inglismen to tarry with ane slicht.
Quhill that Wallace into the wod was past,
Than Cartlane craigis they persewit full fast.
Quhe^ Sutheroun saw yat chaipit was Wallace,
Agane they turnit, the woman tuke on case.
Put her to deith, I can nocht tell ow how,
Of sic matter I may nocht tarry now.
Quhair greit dule is, but redeming agane,
Renewing of it is bot eiking of pane.
Ane true woman had seruir her full lang,
Out of the town the ganest way can gang.
To Wallace tauld, how all this deid was done,
The panefull woe socht to his heart full sone.
War nocht for schame he had schot to the ground
For bitter baill that in his breist was bound.
Schir Iohne ye Grahame both wise gentil and fre
Greit murning maid that piety was to se.
And als the laif that war assemblit their,
For pure sorrow with heart weipit full sair.
Quhen Wallace feld their curage was sa small,
He feneit him for to comfort them all.
Ceis men he said, this is ane buteles pane,
For we can nocht cheueis her life agane.
Vneis ane word he micht bring out for tene,
The bailfull teiris brist braithly fra his ene.
Sichand he said, sall never man me se,
Rest into eis quhill this deid wrokin be.
The sarkles slauchter of her both blyith and bricht,
That I awow to the maker of micht.
Of that Natioun I sall never forbeir,
oung nor auld that abill is to weir.
Priest nor woman I think nocht for to sla*
In my default, bot gif they causing ma.
Schir Iohne he said, lat all this murning be,
And for her saik their sall ten thousand de.
Quhair men may weip, their curage is the les,
It slaikis Ire, of wrang they should redres.
Of their complaint as now I speik na mair,
Of Auchinlek in Kilbank dwelland their.
Quhen he hard tell of Wallace vexatioun,
To Cartlane wod with ten men maid him boun.
Wallace he fand sumpart within the nicht.
To Lanerk town in all haist they yame dicht.
The watch as than of them had lytill dreid,
Partit their men, syne diverse wayis eid.
Schir Iohne ye Grahame and his good cu^pany,
To Schir Robert Thorn full fast they hy.
Wallace and his, to Hessilrig sone they past,
In ane heich house quhair he was sleipand fast.
Struik at the dure with his fute hardely,
Quhill bar and brais in the flure gart he ly.
The Schiref cryit quha makis that greit deray,
Wallace he said, quhilk thou hes socht this day.
The womanis deith, will God thou fall deir by,
Hessilrig thocht it was na time to ly.
Out of that house full fane he wald have been,
The nicht was mirk, it Wallace hes him seen,
Feirfly him straik, as he come in greit Ice,
Upon the heid, bristit throw bane and lire.
The scheirand sword glaid to his schulder bane,
Out ouir the stair amang them is he gane.
Good A^chinlek trowit nocht that he was deid,
Thryis with ane knyfe he straik him in that steid.
The scry about raise rudely in that streit,
Feill of the laif war full eit under feit.
oung Hessilrig and wicht Wallace is met,
Ane sicker straik Williame hes on him set.
Derfly to deith, ouir the stair dang him down,
Money that nicht they slew in Lanerk town.
Sum Greissis lap, and sum stikkit within,
Affeirit they war, with hiddeous noyis and din.
Schir Iohne ye Grahame had set ye house in fire
Quhair Robert Thorn was brynt up bane and lyre.
Twelf scoir they slew yat war of Ingland borne,
Women they leuit, and Preistis on the morn.
To pas their way of blis and gudis bair,
And swore that they, agane should cum na mair.
Quhen Scottis hard their fine tythingis of new,
Out of all partis to Wallace fast they drew.
Pleneist the town quhilk was their heritage,
Thus Wallace straif aganis that greit barnage.
Ay he began with strife and stalwart hand,
To cheueis agane sum rowmis in Scotland.
The worthy Scottis that semblit to him their,
Cheis^t him for chief, their Chiftane and leidair.
Aymer Wallange ane felloun Tyran Knicht,
In Both well dwelt, King Edwards man full richt.
Murray was out, thocht he was richteous Lord,
Of all that land, as true men will record.
Into Arrane he was dwelland that tide,
And other ma, in this land durst nocht bide.
Bot this false Knicht in Both well w^mand was
Ane man he gart sone to King Edward pas.
And tauld him haill of Wallace ordinance,
How he had put his pepill to mischance.
And planely was, rissin agane to Ring,
Greuit their at, richt greitly was this King.
Throw all Ingland he gart his doaris cry,
Power to get, and said he wald planely:
In Scotland pas, that Realm to statute new,
Feill men of weir to him richt fast they drew.
The Queen feld weill how that his purpois was
To him scho went, on kneis syne can scho as.
He wald desist, and nocht in Scotland gang,
e should have dreid, to wirk sa felloun wrang.
Cristinit they ar, one is their heritage,
To reif their Croun it is ane greit outrage.
For her counsall at hame he wald nocht bide,
His Lordis him feit in Scotland for to ride.
Ane Scottis man yan dwelt with King Edward,
Quhen he hard fell that Wallace tuke sic part:
He stall fra them als privately as he may,
Into Scotland he come upon ane day.
Seikand Wallace he maid him reddy boun,
This Scot was borne in Kyle at Ricardtoun.
All Ingland coist he knew it wounder weill,
Fra Hull about, to Bristow every deill.
Fra Carlisle throuch Sandwiche yat Royal steid
Fra Dover ouir, unto Sanct Bayis heid.
In Picardy and Flanders both he had been,
All Normandy and France hes he seen.
An^ Purseuant to King Edward in weir,
Bot he culd never gar him his armis beir.
Of greit stature, and sumpart gray was he,
The Inglismen callit him bot Grymisbie.
To Wallace come, and into Kyle him fand,
He tauld him haill the tythingis of Ingland.
They turnit his name fra time yat he him knew
And callit him Iop of Ingyne he was true.
In all his time good service in him fand,
Gaif him to beir the armis of Scotland.
Wallace agane in Cliddisdaill sone he raid,
And his power semblit withouttin baid.
He gart command quha wald his pear tak,
Ane fre remit he should gar to him make.
For alkin deid that they had done beforne,
The Perseis piece and Schir Rannalds was worn
Feill to him drew, that bauldly durst abide,
Of Wallace kyn of money diverse side.
Schir Rannald than send him his power haill,
Him self durst nocht be knawin in battall:
Agane Sutheroun, for he had maid ane band,
Lang time befoir, to hald of them his land.
Adame Wallace past out of Ricardtoun,
And Robert Boyd, with good men of Renoun.
Of Cuninghame and Kyle come men of waill,
To Lanerk socht on horse ane thousand haill.
Schir Iohne ye Grahame, and his good Cheualrie*
Schir Iohne of Tynto, with me^ yat he micht be*
Good Auchinlek, that Wallace Vnkill was,
Money true Scot, with yair Chiftane culd pas.
Three thousand haill of lyklie men in weir,
And feill on fute, quhilk wantit horse and g^ir*
The time be this was cu^mand upon hand.
The awful Oist with Edward of Ingland.
The Battle of Bigar,
TO Bigar come with sextie thousand men,
In weir weidis, that cruel was to ken.
They plantit their feill Tentis and pauillonis
Quhair clarions blew with money michtie soundes
Pleneist that place with good victual and wine
In Cartis brocht their purueyance full fine.
This awful King gart two Heraldis be brocht,
Gaif them command in all the haist they mocht.
To charge Wallace that he should cum him till,
Without promis, and put him in his will.
Because we wait he is ane gentill man,
Cum in my grace, and I sall saif him than.
As for his life I will upon me tak,
And after this gif he wald service make.
He sall have wage that may him weill suffice,
That Rebald wenis, for he hes done supprise.
To my pepill often upon adventure,
Aganis me that he may lang Endure.
To this proffer ganestandand gif he be,
Heir I awow he salbe vangit hie.
Ane oung Squyar was brother to Schir Hew
He thocht he wald ga disagysit to persew.
Wallace to se, that tuke sa hie ane part,
Borne Sister Sone he was to King Edward*
Ane coit of Armis he tuke on him but baid,
With the Heraldis full privately forth raid.
To Tynto hill withouttin residence,
Quhair Wallace lay, with his folk at defen^
Ane likly Oist as of sa few they fand,
To him they socht, and wald na langer stand.
Gif e be he that reullis all this thing,
Credence we have brocht fra our worthy King.
Than Wallace gart three Knichtis to him call,
Syne red the writ in presence of them all.
To them he said, answer e sall nocht craif,
Be word or writ quhilk lyks ow best to haif.
In wryt they said it war the liklyest.
Than Wallace thus began to dyte in haist.
Thou ^euar King you chargis me throw case
That I should cum and put me in thy grace.
Gif I ganest and, thou hechtis for to hing me,
I awow to God, and ever I may tak the.
Thou salbe hangit ane exempill to geif,
To King of Reif, als lang as I may leif.
Thou profferis me of thy wagis to haif,
I the defy power and all the laif,
That helpis the heir, of thy falls Natioun,
Will God thou salbe put from this Regioun.
Or de thairfoir contrair thocht thou had sworn
Thou sall us se or nine houris the morn,
Battle to gif, maugre of all thy kyn,
For falsely thou seikis our Realm within.
This wri^ he gaif to the Heraldis but mair,
And good reward he gart deliver them their.
Bot Iop knew weil ye Squyar ou^g schir Hew,
And tauld Wallace, for he was ever true.
He them commandit that they should sone him tak
Him self began sair accusing to make.
Squyar he said, sen thou hes feneit armis,
On the sall fall sumpart of their harmis.
Exempill to gif to all thy falls Natioun.
Upon ane hill he gart syne set him down.
Straik of his heid or he wald farther go,
To the Herald said syne withouttin ho.
For thou art falls to armis and manesworne,
Throw thy cheikis thy tongue salbe out schorne.
Quhen that was done, than to the third said he,
Armis to Judge thou sall never graithly se.
He gart ane Smyth, with his turcas richt their,
Pull out his ene, syne gaif them leif to fair.
To our falls King thy fellow sall the leid,
With thy answer, turs him his Neuoyis heid.
Thus sair I dreid the King and all his boist.
His dum fellow led him unto their Oist.
Quhe^ King Edward his Heraldis thus hes sen^
In proper Ire he woxe neir wod for tene.
That he wist nocht, on quhat wise him to wreik,
For sorrow all may ane word he culd nocht speik
Ane lang quhyle he stude wrythand in ane rage,
On loud he said, this is ane fell outrage.
This deid to Scottis full deir it salbe bocht,
Sa dispitefull in world was never wrocht.
Fra this Regioun I think nocht for to gang,
Quhill time that I sall se that Rebel hang.
I lat him thus in syte and sorrow dwell,
Of the good Scottis schortly I will tell.
FVrth fra his men than Wallace raikit richt,
To him he callit schir Iohne Tynto ye knicht
And leit him wit, to vesy he wald ga,
The Inglis Oist, and bad him tell na ma.
Quhat ever they speirit, quhill yat he come agan^
Wallace disagy^t thus ^ownit ouir ane pla^e.
Betuix Culter and Bigar as he past,
He was sone war quhair ane warkman come fast
Dryuand ane meir, and pitcheris for to sell,
Good friend he said in treuth will thou me tell.
With this chau^cy quhair passis thou trewly?
To any place quha lykis for to by.
It is my craft, and I wald sell them fane,
I will them by, sa God me help fra pane.
Quhat price lat heir, I will have them ilk ane,
Bot half ane mark, for sic price have I taken.
Twenty schillingis, Wallace said thou sall haif,
I will have Meir, pitcheris and all the laif.
Thy gown and hois in haist thou put of syne,
And make ane change, for I sall gif the mine.
And thy auld hude because it is threid ^air.
The man wend weill he had scornit him their.
Thou tarry nocht, it is suith that I say,
The man kest of his febill weid of gray.
And Wallace his, syne payit silver in hand.
Pas on he said, thou art ane bad Merchand.
The gown and hois in clay that claggit was,
The hude heklit, and syne maid him to pas.
The quhip he tuke, and forth the Meir can call,
Attouir ane bray the up mest pot gart fall.
Brak on the ground, the man leuch at his fair,
Bot thou be war, thou tynis of thy chauffair.
The Sone be than was passit out of sicht,
The day was went, and cu^min was the nicht.
Amang the Sutheroun full besely he past,
On ather side his ene he can to cast.
How Lordis lay, and had their ludging maid,
The Pauilloun quhair that the Leopardis baid.
Spyand full fast quhair his auaill micht be,
He culd weill wynk and luke up with ane Ee.
Sum scornit him, sum gleyit Earll callit him ya^
Aggreuit they war of their Heraldis misfait.
Sum speirit at him how he sauld of the best,
For forty pennyis he said quhill they may lest.
Sum brak ane part, sum prikkit at his Ee,
Wallace slaid out privately and leit them be.
Unto his Oist agane he passit richt,
His men be than had taken Tynto the Knicht,
Schir Iohne ye Grahame gart bind him wou^der fast
For he wist weill he was with Wallace last.
Sum bad byrn him, sum hang him in ane cord,
They swore that he had dessauit their Lord.
Wallace be this was enterit them amang,
To him he eid, and wald nocht tarry lang.
Syne he gart lous him of they bandis new,
And said he was both sober, wise, and true.
To Supper sone bownit but mait abaid,
He tauld to them quhat merkat he had maid.
And how that he the Sutheroun saw full weill
Schir Iohne ye Grahame displesit was sum deill
And said to him nocht Chiftane like it was,
Throw wilfulnes in sic perrell to pas.
Wallace answerit, or he win Scotland fre,
Both e, and I, in mair perrell mon be.
And money other the quhilk full worthy is,
Now of ane thing we do sum part ane mis.
Ane lytill sleip I wald fane that we had,
With one men syne, luke how we may us glaid.
The worthy Scottis tuke good rest quhill neir day
Tha^ raise yai up, to array sone ordanit they.
The hill is lefe, and to ane plane is gane,
Wallace him self the vangard first hes taken.
With him was Boyd, and Auchinlek but dreid,
With ane thousand of worthy men in weid.
Als money syne in the myddill waird put he,
Schir Iohne ye Grahame he gart yair leidar be.
With him oung Adam the Lord of Ricardtoun
And Someruell ane bald Squyar of Renoun.
The third thousand in the reirward he dicht,
To Walter gaif of Newbigging the Knicht.
With him Tynto that douchtie was in deid,
And David Sone to Schir Walter to leid.
Behind them neir the fute men gart he be,
And bad them bide quhill they yair time micht se.
e want wappinnis, and harnes in this tide
The first counter e may nocht weill abide.
Wallace gart sone the Chiftanis to him call,
This charge he gaif, for chance that micht befall.
To tak na heid to geir nor it peillage,
For they will fle as wod folk in ane rage.
Win first the men, the good syne e may haif.
And tak na tent of couetise to craif.
Throw couetise men loissis good and life,
I ow command forbeir sic in our strife.
Luke e saif nane, Lord, Capitane, nor Knicht,
For worschip wirk, and for our Eldaris richt.
God blis us all, that we may in our veyage,
Put their falls folk out of our heritage.
Than they Inclynit all with ane good will,
His plane command they hecht it to fulfill.
On the greit Oist the parteis fast can draw,
Cu^mand to them out of the South they saw:
Three hundredth men into their Armor cleir,
The ganest way to them approchit neir.
Wallace said sone, they at na Inglismen,
For by this Oist the gaitis weill they ken.
Thom Halyday they men he gydit richt,
From Annandaill he had led them that nicht.
His two good Sonnis, Iohnstoun and Rutherfurd
Wallace was blyith, fra he had hard that word.
Sa was the laif of his good Cheualry,
Iardane their come into their cumpany.
And Kirkpatrik befoir in Eskdaill was,
Ane wing they war in Wallace Oist to pas.
The Inglis watch, that nicht had been on steir,
Drew to their Oist, richt as the day can peir.
Wallace knew weill, for he befoir had seen,
The Kingis Pauillone quhair it was buskit been.
Than with rich horse ye Scottis upon yame raid,
At the first counter, sa greit abasing maid.
That all the Oist was stoneist of that sicht,
Full money ane derfly to deith was dicht.
Feill of them as than was out of array,
The mair awful and haistie was the fray.
The noyis was hudge, throw straikkis that they dang,
The rumor raise sa rudely yame amang.
That all the Oist was than in point to fle,
The wise Lordis fra they the perrell se.
The felloun fray als rasit was about,
And how their King stude in sa mekill dout.
To his Pauillone full money thousand socht,
Him to reskew be any way they mocht.
The Erll of Kent that nicht walkand had been,
With five thousand of men in armor kene.
About the King full suddandly they gang,
And traistis weill ye assail was richt strange.
All Wallace folk in use of weir was good,
Into the stour, sone lichtit quhair yai stude.
Quhome ever yai hit na harnes micht yame stynt
Fra they on fute assemblit with swordis dy^t.
Of manheid they in hartis cruel was,
They thocht to win or never hyne to pas.
Feill Inglismen befoir the King they slew,
Schir Iohne ye Grahame come with his power new
Ama^g ye Oist with ye myddil ward he raid
Greit martyrdom on Sutheroun men yai maid.
The reirward than set ou sa hardely,
With Newbigging and all the Cheualry.
Pauillone raipis they cuttit all in sunder,
Borne to the ground and money smorit under.
The fute men come, the quhilk I spak of air,
Qu frayit folkis set straikis sad and sair.
Thocht they befoir wantit both horse and geir,
Aneuch they gat, quhat yai wald waill to weir.
The Scottis power than all togidder war,
The Kingis Pauillone brymly down they bair.
The Erll of Keut with ane good Axe in hand,
Into the stour full stoutly culd he stand.
Be^oir the King makand full greit debait,
Quha best did than had the hiest estait.
The felloun stour sa stalwart was and strange,
Thairto continewit meruellously and lang.
Wallace him self full sadly culd persew,
And at ane straik the chief Chistane he flew.
The Sutheroun folk fled fast and durst not bide
Horsit their King and of the field can ride.
Aganis his will, for he was laith to fle,
Into that time he rocht nocht for to de.
Of his best men three thousand their was deid,
Or he culd find to fle and leif that steid.
Twenty thousand fled with him in ane staill,
The Scottis gat horse, and followit yat battaill.
Throw Culter hope or time they wan the hicht,
Feill Sutheroun folk war marrit in their micht.
Slane be the gait as their King fled away,
Both fair and bricht, and richt cleir was the day.
The Sone rysin schynand ouir hill and daill,
Than Wallace kest quhat was his best auaill
The fleand folk that of the field first past,
In to their King agane yai semblit fast.
Fra ather side sa money assemblit their.
That Wallace wald lat follow them na mair.
Befoir he raid gart his folk turn agane,
Of Inglismen seuin thousand their was slane.
Than Wallace Oist agane to Bigar raid,
Quhair Inglismen greit purueyance had maid.
The Iowalry as they war hidder led,
Pauillonis and all they leifit quhen they fled.
The Scotts gat gold, good geir and other wage
Releuit they war that partit that peillage.
To meit they went with mirth and plesance,
They spairit nocht King Edwardis purueyance.
With solace syne ane lytill sleip they ta,
Ane private watch he gart amang them ga.
Two Cuikis fell their lyfis for to saif,
With deid Crocis that lay vnput in graif.
Quhen they saw weill the Scottis war at rest,
Out of the field, to steill they thocht it best.
Full law they crap quhill they war out of sicht,
After the Oist syne ran in all their micht.
Quhen yat ye Scottis had sleipit bot ane quhyle
Than raise they up, for Wallace dreidit gyle.
He said to them the Sutheroun may persew,
Agane to us, for they ar folk anew.
Quhair Inglismen prouisioun makis in weir,
It is full hard to do them mekill deir.
On this plane field we will them nocht abide,
To sum good place my purpois is to ride.
The purueyance they left was into that steid,
To Roppis Bog he gart seruandis it leid
With ordinance that Sutheroun brocht in their,
He with the Oist to Dauidschaw can fair.
Quhair they remanit ane greit space of the day,
Of Inglismen it sum thing will I say.
As King Edward throw Culter hopis socht,
Quhen he persauit the Scottis followit nocht:
In Iohnis Graif he gart his Oist bide still,
Feill fleand folk assemblit sone him till.
Quhen they war met, the King neir worthit mad
For his deir kyn that he their ^o^ssit had.
His two Emis into the field was slane,
His secund Sone that mekill was of mane.
His brother Hew was killit their full called,
The Erll of Kent, that cruel berne and bald.
With greit worschip tuke deid befour the King,
For him he murnit sa lang as he micht Ring.
At this semblay as they in sorrow stand,
The two Cu^kis come sone in at his hand.
And tauld to him, how they eschaipit wair,
The Scottis all, as swyne lyis drunkin their.
Of our wicht wine e gart us hidder leid,
Full weill e may be vengit of their deid.
Upon our lyfis, is suith that we ow tell,
Return agane, e sall find them our sell.
He blamit them, and said na wit it was,
That he agane for sic ane taill should pas.
Their Chiltane is richt meruellous in weir,
Fra sic perrell he can full weill them beir.
For to seik mair, as now I will nocht ride,
Our meit is loissit, thairfoir we man nocht bide.
The hardy Duke of Longcastell and Lord,
Souerane he said, to our counsall concord.
Gif this be ^rew, we have the mair auaill,
We may them win, and make bot licht travel.
War one folk deid, quha micht agane us stand?
Than neid we nocht for meit to leif the land.
The King answerit, I will nocht ride agane,
As at this time my purpois is in plane.
The Duke said Schir, gif e determynit be,
To move ow mait, it effeiris nocht to me.
Command power, agane with me to wend,
And I of this, sall se ane final end.
Ten thousand haill he chargit for to ride,
H^ir in this strenth all nicht I sall ow bide
We may get meit of bestiall in this land,
Good drink as now we may nocht bring to hand.
Of West mure land the Lord had met yame yair,
On with the Duke he graithi^ him to fair.
At the first straik with them he had nocht been
With him he led ane thousand weill besene.
Ane Pikard Lord was with ane thousand boun,
Of King Edward he keipit Calice town.
Their tweir thousand unto the town can fair,
The two Capitanis sone met them at Bigair.
With the hai^ stuf of Roxburgh and Berwike,
Schir Rauf Gray saw yat they war Sutheroun like.
Out of the South approchit to their sicht,
He knew full weill with yame it was not richt.
Aymer Wallance with his power come als,
King Edwardis man ane tyran Knicht and falls.
Quhen they war met, they ^a^d nocht (...) yair,
Bot deid Crocis, and they war spuleit bair.
Than meruellit they quhair the Scottis should be,
Of them about apperance they culd nocht se.
Bot spyis yame tauld yat come with Schir Aymare
In Dauidschaw they saw yame make repair.
The feill Sutheroun sone past to that place,
The watch was war, and tauld it to Wallace.
He warnit the Oist out of the Town to ride,
In Roppis Bog he purposit to abide.
Ane lytill Schaw upon the ane side was,
That men on fute out of the Bog micht pas.
The horse they left into that lytill hald,
On fute they thocht the Mos that they should hald.
The Inglis Oist had weill their passage seen,
And followit fast with cruel men and kene.
They trowit yat Bog micht make yame lytil vaill
Growin ouir with Risp, and all ye sward was haill.
On them to ride they ordanit with greit Ire,
Of the formest ane thousand in the mire.
Of horse with men, ar plungit in the deip,
The Scottis of their cu^ming tuke good keip.
Upon them set with straikis sad and sair,
eid nane away of all that enterit their.
Licht men on fute upon them derfly dang,
Feill under horse war smorit in that thrang.
Strampit in Mos, and with rude horse ouir gane
The worthy Scottis the dry land than hes taken.
Upon the laif fechtand full wounder fast,
And money grume they maid full sair aghast.
The Inglismen that besy was in weir,
Assaileit sair, them fra the Mos to beir.
On ather side, bot than it was na bute,
The strenth they held richt awfully on fute.
To men and horse gaif money grievous wound,
Feill to the deith they stikkit in that stound.
The Pikard Lord assaileit scharply their,
Upon the Grahame with straikis sad and sair.
Schir Iohne ye Grahame with ane stif sword of steill
His bricht byrneis he peirsit every deill.
Throw all the stuf, and stikkit him in that steid,
Thus of his dynt the bauld Pikard was deid.
The Inglis Oist tuke plane purpois to fle,
In their turning the Scottis gart money de.
Wallace wald fane at the Wallange have been,
Of Westmureland the Lord was yame between
Wallace on him he set ane awful dynt,
Throw Basnet and stuf, yat na steill micht out stint.
Derfly to deith he left him in that place,
Swa the false Knicht eschapit throw this case.
Good Robert Boyd hes with ane Capitane met,
Of Berwik than, ane sad straik on him set.
Ouirthort the craig, and keruit the Pesane,
Throw all his weid in sunder straik the bane.
Feill horsemen fled fast, and durst nocht abide,
Rebutit evil unto their King they ride.
The Duke him tauld of all their Journey haill,
His heart for Ire boldnit in bitter baill.
Heichly he hecht, he should never Londoun se,
On Wallace deith quhill he reuengit be.
Or lois his men, agane as he did air,
Thus south he socht, with greit sorrow and cair.
Than at the Kirk ane lytill tarry maid,
Syne throw the land ouir Sulway fast he raid.
The Scottis Oist ane nicht remanit still,
Upon the morn they spuleit with good will.
The deid corpse syne culd to Braidwod fair,
At ane counsall three dayis they soiornit their.
At the Forest Kirk ane meting ordanit he,
They cheisit Wallace Scottis wardane to be.
Craisting he should their panefull sorrow ceis,
He ressauit all that wald cum to his peis.
Schir William come, that Lord Douglas was
Forsuke Edward, at Wallace peax can as.
In that thirlage he wald na langer be,
Tribute befoir to Ingland payit he.
In contrair Scottis with them never raid,
Far better cheir Wallace thairfoir him maid.
Thus treitit he, and chereist wounder fair,
True Scottis men, that fewtie maid him their.
And gaif greitly feill gudis that he wan,
He warnit it nocht to na good Scottis man.
Quha wald rebel, and gang contrair the richt,
He puneist sair, war he Squyar or Knicht.
Thus meruellously, good Wallace tuke on hand,
Likly he was, richt ^air and weill farrand.
Manly and stout, and thairto richt liberal,
Plesand and wise in all good general
To slay forsooth Sutheroun he spairit nocht,
To Scottis men full greit proffit he wrocht.
Into the South forsooth than passit he,
As him best thocht he reullit that country.
Schireffis he maid, that cruel was and kene,
And Capitanis of true wise Scottis men.
Fra Gamyllis peth, the land obeyit him haill,
To Vr watter, both strenth Forest and daill.
Aga^s him in Galloway house was nane,
Except Wigtoun, biggi^ of lyme and stane.
That Capitane hard the reull of Wallace,
Away be sey he stall out of that place.
Leuit all waist, and culd in Ingland wend,
Bot Wallace sone ane keipar to it send.
Ane good Squyar, and to name he was called,
Adam Gordoun as the story me tald.
ANe strenth their was at the watter of Cre,
Within ane roche richt stalwart wrocht of tree
Ane gait befoir, na man micht to it win,
But the consent of them that dwelt thairin.
On the bak side ane roche and watter was,
Ane strait enter forsooth their was to pas.
To vesy it Wallace him self sone went,
Fra he it saw, he kest in his Intent.
To win the hald, he hes chosin ane gait,
That they within should make lytill debait.
His power haill hes gart bide out of sicht,
Bot three with him quhill time that it was nicht.
Than tuke he two quhen that the nicht was dym
Steuin of Ireland and Keirly that culd clym.
Up sone they went aganis that roche sa strange,
Thus enterit they the Sutheroun men amang.
The watch befoir tuke na tent to that side,
Their three in feir sone to the Portar they glyde.
Good Wallace than straik the Portar him sell,
Deid ouir the roche into the dyke he fell.
Leit down the brig, and blew his horn on hicht,
The buschment brak, and come in all their micht.
At their awin will, sone enterit in that place,
To Inglismen they did full lytill grace.
Sextie they slew, in that hald was na ma,
Bot ane auld Priest, and sempill women two.
Greit purueyance was in that roche to spend,
Wallace baid still, quhill it was at ane end.
Brak down the strenth, both brig and Bulwark all,
Out ouir the Roch they gart the tymmer fall.
Undid the gait, and wald na langer bide,
In Carrik syne, they bownit them to ride.
Haistit them nocht, bot soberly can fair,
To Turnbery, that Capitane was of Air,
With Lord Persee to tak his counsall haill,
Wallace purpoisit, that place for to assaill.
Ane woman tauld, quhen ye Capitane was gane,
Good men of fence into the steid was nane.
They fillit the dyke with eird and tymmer baill,
Syne fyrit the house, na succor micht auaill.
Ane Priest their was, and gentill women yairin,
Quhilk for ye manner, maid hiddeous noyis and din.
Mercy they cryit, for him that deit on tree,
Wallace gart slaik, the fire and let them be.
To make defense na ma was leuit their,
He them commandit out of the land to fair.
Spuleit the place, and spilt all that they mocht
Upon the morn to Cummok sone they socht.
To Lanerk syne, and set ane time of Air,
Mudoaris feill, he gart be punist their.
To good true men he gaif full nobill wage,
His brother Sonnis put to their heritage.
To the blak craig in Cumnok past agane,
His houshald set with men of mekill mane.
Three monethis their be dwelt into good rest,
The subtle Sutheroun fand weill it was ye best
Trewis to tak for to eschew ane chance,
To further this they send for Knicht Wallance.
Bothwell it that Tratour keipit still,
And Air all haill was at Lord Perseis will.
Throw greit supple of the Capitane of Air,
The Bischop Beik in Glasgow he dwelt their.
Erll of Stanefurd was Chalmerlane of England,
With Schir Aymer, this Tratour tuke on hand.
To procure peax be any manner of case,
Ane saif Conduct they purchest of Wallace.
In Ruglin Kirk the tryst their have they set,
And promis maid to meit Wallace but let.
The day of this approchit wounder fast,
The greit Chancelar and Aymer hidder past.
Syne Wallace come, and his men weill besene,
With him fyftie, arrayit all in grene.
Ilk ane of them ane bow and arrowis bair,
And lang swordis, the quhilk full scharply schair.
Within the Kirk how sone he enterit had,
Unto his prayer he past but mair abaid.
Syne up he raise and to his tryist he went,
And his good men full cruel of Intent.
In Ire he grew, that Tratour quhen he saw,
The Inglismen of his face stude greit aw.
Wit reullit him, that he did nane outrage,
The Erll beheld fast to his hie curage.
Forthocht sumpart that he come to that place,
Greitly abasit for the vult of his face.
Schir Aymer said, this speiche e may begin,
He will nocht bow to na Prince of our kyn.
Assouerit e ar, I traist e may speik weill,
For all Ingland he will nocht brek adeill.
His saif Conduct, or quhair he makis ane band,
The Chancellar than proferrit him his hand.
Wallace stude still, and culd na handis tak,
Freindschip to them na liklynes wald he make.
Schir Aymer said, Wallace e understand,
This is ane Lord, and Chancellar of Ingland.
To salus him, e may be proper skill,
With schort auise he maid answer him till.
Sic salussing I use to Inglismen,
Sa sall they have quhair ever I may them ken.
At my power that make I God awow,
Out of Conduct gif that I had him now.
Bot for thy life, and all his land sa braid,
I will nocht brek the promis that is maid.
I had lever at mine awin will have the,
Without conduct, that I micht wrokin be.
Of thy falls deid, thou dois in this Regioun,
Than of pure gold ane Kingis greit Ransoun.
Bot for my band, as now I will lat be,
Chancellar say forth, quhat e desire of me.
The Chancellar said, the may cause of this thing,
To procure peax, I am send fra the King.
With the greit seill, and voce of his Parliament,
Quhat I bind heir, our barnage sall consent.
Wallace answerit, ouir lytill mendis we haif,
Syne of our richt e occupy the laif.
Quytclame our land, and we sall nocht deny,
The Chancellar said, of na sic chargis have I.
We will gif gold or our purpois should faill,
Than Wallace said in waist is that trauaill.
We ask na gold, be favor of our kyn,
In weir of ow, we tak that we may wyn.
Abaissit he was to make answer agane,
Wallace said Schir, we Iangill all in vane.
My counsall geuis, I will na fabill make,
As for ane eir, ane final peax to tak.
Nocht for my self, that I bind to our Seill,
I can nocht trow, that ever e will be leill.
Bot for pure folk that greitly hes been supprysit,
I will tak peax quhill farther we be auysit.
Than band they thus, their should be na debait,
Castle and Town should stand in that ilk stait.
Fra that day forth quhill ane eir war at end,
Seillit this peax, and tuke their leif to wend.
Wallace fra them past into the west,
Maid plane repair quhair that him lykit best.
it sair he dred, that they should him dissaif.
This Indenture to Schir Rannald he gaif,
His deir Vnkill, quhair it micht keipit be,
In Cumnok syne to his dwelling went he.

The Seuint part of this Buik declairis how Wallace brynt ye Bernis of Air, and
put Bischop Beik out of Glasgow, and slew Lord Persee.
Ca. j.
IN Februar befell the samin case,
That Inglismen tuke trewis with Wallace
This passit ouir quhill March away was socht*
The Inglisme^ kest all ye wayis yai mocht.
With subtle and wickit Illusioun,
The worthy Scottis to put to confusioun.
Into Aprile the King of Ingland come,
In Cumbirland of pumfret fra his home.
Into Carlisle to ane counsall he eid,
Quhairof the Scottis micht have full mekil dreid
Money Capitane that was of Ingland borne,
Hidder their past, semblit their King beforne.
Na Scottis man to that counsall they called,
Bot Schir Aymer, that tratour was of auld.
At him they speirit how they should tak on hand,
The richteous blude to stroy out of Scotland.
Schir Aymer said, their Chiftane can weill do,
Richt wise in weir, and hes greit power to.
And now this trewis geuis them sic hardiment,
That to our says they will nocht all consent.
Bot wald e do richt as I can ow leir,
The peax to them it should be sauld full deir.
Than demit he the false Sutheroun amang,
How they best micht the Scottis Barrounis ha^g
Four greit Bernis that time stude into Air,
Wrocht for the King quhen his bigging was yair
Biggit about, that na man enter micht,
Bot ane atanis, nor have of other sicht.
Their ordanit they their Lordis should be slane,
Ane Justice maid quhilk was of mekill mane.
To Lord Persee of this matter they laid,
With sad auise agane to them he said.
They men to me hes keipit treuth sa lang,
Dissaitfully I may nocht se them hang.
I am their fa, and warn will I them nocht,
Sa I be quyte, I rek nocht quhat e wrocht.
Fra thine I will, and toward Glasgow draw,
With our Bischop, to heir of his new Law.
Than cheissit they ane Justice feirs and fell,
Quhilk Arnulf hecht as mine Author will tell.
Of South Hamptoun he hecht both Air and Lord,
He under tuke to pyne them with ane cord.
Ane other Air in Glasgow ordanit they,
For Clyddisdaill men to stand the samin day.
Syne chargit them in all wayis eirnestly,
Be na kyn meake Wallace should eschaip yame by.
For weill they wist, and their men war ouirthrawin,
They micht at will bruik Scotland as yair awin.
This band they clois under their Seillis fast,
Syne socht ouir mure agane King Edward past.
The new Justice ressauit was in Air,
The Lord Persee can unto Glasgow fair.
This Air was set in June the xviij. day,
And planely cryit, na fre man war away.
The Scottis meruellit, and peax taken in the land
Quhy Inglismen, sic maistrie tuke on hand.
Schir Rannald set ane day befoir this Air,
At Monktoun Kirk, his freindis to meit him yair
Williame Wallace unto that tryist culd pas,
For he as than, Wardane of Scotland was.
This Master Iohne ane worthy clerk was yair
He chargit his kyn for to bide fra that Air.
Richt weill he wist, fra Persee left that land,
Greit perrell was to Scottis appeirand.
Wallace fra them, into the Kirk he eid,
Pater Noster, he said, and als ane Creid.
Syne to the Greece he lenit him soberly,
Upon ane sleip he slaid full suddandly.
Cleland followit, and saw him fallin on sleip,
He maid na noyis, bot wisely culd him keip.
In that slummer, cu^mand him thocht he saw,
Ane stalwart man that toward him culd draw.
Sone be the hand he hint him haistelie,
I am he said, in veyage chargit with the.
Ane sword him gaif, of burely burnist steill,
Good Sone he said, this sword thou sall bruik weill.
Of Topasion him thocht the plumat was,
Both hilt and all, glitterand as the glass.
Deir Sone he said, we tarry heir to lang,
Thou sall ga se, quhair wrocht is mekill wrang.
Than he him led to ane montane on hicht,
The world him thocht he micht se at ane sicht.
He left him their, syne sone he fra him went,
Thairof Wallace studyit in his Intent.
To se him their he had full greit desire,
Their with he saw begin ane felloun fire.
Quhilk braithly brynt on breid out throw ye land
Scotland attour, fra Ros to Sulway sand.
Than sone to him descendit their ane Queen,
Illuminat licht, schinand full bricht and schene.
In her presence appeirit sa mekill licht,
That all the fire scho put out of his sicht.
Gaif him ane wand of color reid and grene,
With ane Saphir saynit his face and ene.
Welcum scho said, I cheis the to my lufe,
Thou art grantit be the greit God abufe.
To help pepill that sufferis mekill wrang,
With the as now, I may nocht tarry lang.
Thou sall return to thine awin Oist agane,
Thy derrest kyn ar heir in mekill pane.
This richt Regioun, thou mon redeem it all,
Thy last rewaird in eirth salbe bot small.
Let nocht thairfoir, tak redres of this mis,
To thy rewaird thou sall have heuinis blis.
Of her richt hand scho betaucht him ane buik,
Humbly thus her leif than scho tuik.
Unto the Clud ascendit of his sicht,
Wallace brak up the buik in all his micht.
In three partis the buik weill writtin was,
The first letteris, war gros letteris of bras.
The secund gold, the third was silver schene,
Wallace meruellit quhat this writing should mean.
To reid the buik he besyit him sa fast,
His Sprite agane to walkand mind it past.
And up he raise syne suddandly forth went,
This Clerk he fand, and tauld him his Intent.
Of this visioun as I have said befoir,
Compleitly forth, quhat neidis wordis moir.
Deir Sone he said, my wit vnabill is,
To ratify sic for dreid I say mys.
it I sall deem, thocht my cunning be small,
God grant na charge after my wordis fall.
The stalwart man gaif the that sword in hand,
Fergus it is first winnar of Scotland.
That montane is, quhair he the had on hicht,
Knawledge to haif of wrang yat thou mon richt.
That fire salbe feill tythingis or e part,
Quhilk will be tauld in money sindrie art.
I can nocht wit, quhat Queen that that should be,
Bot gif it be Fortoun ane Lady quhylis richt fre.
The pretty wand I trow be mine Intent,
Betaiknis reull, and cruel chaistement.
The reid color, quha graithly understood,
Betaikinis all to greit battle and blude.
The grene curage, that thou art now amang,
In trubill and weir, thou sall continue lang.
The Saphir stane scho blissit the with all,
Is happy chance will God sall to the fall.
The thrynfald buik, is bot this brokin land,
Thou mon redeem be worthynes of hand.
The bras letteris betaikinis bot to this,
The greit oppres in weir and mekill mys.
The quhilk thou sall bring to the richt agane,
Bot thou thairfoir mon suffer mekill pane.
The gold betaikinis honor and worthynes,
Victor in armis, manheid and Nobilnes.
The silver schawis clean life and heuinnis blis,
To thy rewaird that mirth thou sall nocht mis.
Dreid nocht thairfoir, be out of all despair,
Farther as now heirof I can na mair.
He thankit him, and thus his leif hes taken,
To Corsbie syne with his Vnkill raid hame.
With myrthis thus all nicht soiornit their,
Upon the morn they graithit them to the Air.
And forth they raid, quhill they come to Kyncace,
With dreidfull heart thus speirit wicht Wallace.
At Schir Rannald for the Charter of peis,
Neuoy he said, their wordis ar nocht leis.
It is leuit in Corsbie in the kissed,
Quhair thou it laid, thairof nane other wist.
Wallace answerit, had we it heir to schaw,
And they be falls we sall nocht enter aw.
Deir Sone he said, I pray the pas agane,
Thocht thou wald send, thy travel war in vane.
Bot thou or I, can nane it bring this tide,
Greit grace it was, maid him agane to ride.
Wallace returnit, tuke nane with him bot three,
Nane of them knew this Indenture bot he.
Unhap him led, forbid him culd he nocht,
Of falls desait this good Knicht had na thocht.
Schir Rannald raid, but resting to the town,
Wittand na thing of all this false ttessoun.
That wickit Sign sa reullit that Planeit,
Saturn was than into his hiest stait.
Abone Juno in his Melancoly,
Iuppiter, Mars, ay cruel of Inuy.
Saturn as than auancit his nature,
Of Tyranny he power had and cure.
Rebellis reullis in money seir Regioun,
Trubillous wedder, makis money schippis to drou^
His driching is with Pluto in the Se,
As of the land full of Iniquity.
He walknis weir, full of Pestilence,
Filling of wallis with cruel violence
Poysoun is ryfe, amang their other thingis,
Suddand slauchter of Empriouris and Kingis.
Quhen Sampson pullit to ground the Pillair,
Saturn was than into the hiest Speir.
At Thebes als of his power they tell,
Quhen Phiorax sank throw the eirth to hell.
Of the Troianis he had full mekill cure,
Quhen Achilles at Troy slew good Hector.
Burdeous schent, and money Cieteis mo,
His power it, it hes na hap to ho.
In braid Bertane feill vengeance hes been seen,
Of this and mair, e wait weill quhat I mean.
Bot to this house that stalwart was and strange
Schir Rannald come and micht nocht tarry lang*
Ane balk was knit all full of raipis kene,
Sic ane Tolbuith sen syne was never seen.
Strange men was set the enter for to hald,
Nane micht pas in, bot ane as they war called.
Schir Rannald first to make fewtie for his land,
The Knicht went in, and wald na langer stand.
Ane rynnand cord they slippit ouir his heid,
Hard to the balk, and hangit him to deid.
Schir Brice the Blair nixt after in he past,
Unto the deith they haistit him full fast.
Be he enterit, his heid was in the snair,
Tit to the balk, hangit to deith richt their.
The third enterit, greit piety was for thy,
Ane gentill Knicht Schir Neill of Montgomery
And other feill of landit men about,
Money eid in, bot na Scottis come out.
Of Wallace part they put to that derf deid,
Money Craufurd sa endit in that steid.
Of Carryk men Kennedeis slew they als,
And kind Campbellis, that never had been falls.
Their Rebellit nocht contrair yair richteus croun,
Sutheroun for thy yame put to confusioun.
Barklayis, Boydis, and Stewartis of good kyn,
Na Scot eschaipit that time that enterit in.
Upon the balk they hangit money pair,
Beside them deid, in ane nuik kest them their.
Sen the first time, that any weir was wrocht,
To sic ane deith sa money eid their nocht.
Upon ane day throw cursit Saxonis seid,
Vengeance of this out throw that kynrent eid.
Grantit it was fra the greit God of heuin,
Sa ordanit, that law should be their steuin.
To the false Saxonis for their fell Judgment,
Their wickitnes ouir all the world is went.
e Nobill men that are of Scottis kind,
Their pieteous deith, e keip it in our mind.
And us revenge quhen we are set in thrang,
Dollour it is, heiron to tarry lang.
Thus auchtene scoir, derfly to deith they dicht,
Of Barrounis bald, and money worthy Knicht.
Quhen they had slane the worthiest was their,
For waik pepill they wald na langer spair.
Into ane garth kest them out of that steid,
As they war borne, spuleit bair and deid.
Good Robert Boyd unto ane Tauern eid,
With twenty men, that douchtie war in deid.
Of Wallace house full cruel in Intent,
He gouernit them, quhen Wallace was absent.
Keirlie returnit with his Master agane,
Cleland and Boyd, that mekill was of mane
Steuin of Ireland went forth into the streit,
Ane true woman full sone with him culd meit.
He speirit at her, quhat happinnit in the Air?
Sorrow scho said, is na thing ellis their.
Feiritly scho said, allace quhair is Wallace?
Fra us agane he passit at Kyncace.
Ga warn his folk, and haist them of the town,
To keip him self I salbe reddy boun.
With her as than na mair tarry he maid,
To his fellowis he went withouttin baid.
And to them tauld of all this greit misfair,
To Laglane wod they bownit without mair.
Be this Wallace was cu^mand wounder fast,
For his freindis he was full sair aghast.
Unto the Bern sadly he culd persew,
To enter in, for he na perrell knew.
This true woman, upon him loud can call,
O feirs Wallace, feill tempest is befall.
Our men is slane feill tempest is to se,
As bestiall houndis hangit ouir ane tree.
Our true Barrounis be two and two past in,
Wallace weipit, for greit lois of his kyn.
That with vneis upon his horse he baid,
Mair for to speir to this woman he raid.
Deir Nece he said, gif thou the treuth can tell,
Is mine Eme deid, or how the case befell.
Out of one Bern forsooth I saw him borne,
Naikit laid law, on called eirth me beforne.
His frosty mouth I kyssit in that steid,
Richt now manlyke, bair and brocht to deid.
And with ane claith I couerit his Lichame,
For in his life he did never woman schame.
His Sister Sone, thou art worthy and wicht,
Revenge his deith, for Goddis lufe at thy micht.
Als I sall help, as I am woman true,
Deir wicht he said, greit God gif yat thou knew
Good Robert Boyd, quhair ever thou can him s^
Williame Craufurd, als gif he leuand be.
Adam Wallace wald help me in this strife,
I pray to God send me them all on life.
For Goddis saik bid them sone cum to me,
The Justice Innis thou spy for cheritie.
And in quhat feir that they their ludging make,
Sone after that we sall our purpois tak.
Into Laglane, quhilk hes their succor been,
Adieu merkat, and welcum woddis grene.
Heirof as than, to her he spak na mair,
His brydill turnit and fra her can he fair.
Sic murning maid for his deir worthy kyn,
Him thocht for baill his brist neir brist in twyn.
As he thus raid, in greit anger and tene,
Of Inglismen their followit him fyftene.
Wicht waillit men, that toward him culd draw,
With ane Maissar, to teiche him to the Law.
Wallace returnit in grief and matalent,
With his sword drawin amang yame sone he went
The myddill of them he mankit sone in two,
Ane other their upon the heid can ta.
The third he straik, and throw the coist him claif,
The feird to ground richt derfly down he draif.
The fyft he hit with greit Ire in that steid,
Without reskew dreidles he left them deid.
Than his three men had slane the the other fyfe,
Fra them the laif eschaipit with their life.
Fled to their Lord, and tauld him of this case,
To Laglane wod than rydis with Wallace.
The Sutheroun said, quhat ane that he hit richt,
Without mercy dreidles to deith was dicht.
Meruell they had, sic strenth in ane should be,
Ane of their men at ilk straik he gart de.
Than demit they, it should be Wallace wicht,
To their langage, maid answer ane auld Knicht.
Forsooth he said, be he eschaipit this Air,
All our new deid is eiking of our ^air.
The Justice said, quhen their sic rumor raise,
e wald be feirit, and their come money fais.
That for ane man me think ow like to fle,
And wait nocht it, in deid gif it be he.
And thocht it war, I count him bot full licht,
Quha bydis heir, ilk gentill man salbe Knicht.
I think to deill their landis haill to morn,
To ow about, that are of Ingland borne.
The Sutheroun drew to yair ludgeing but mair
Four thousand haill that nicht was into Air.
In greit Bernis biggit without the Town,
The Justice lay with money bauld Barroun.
Than he gart cry about they wanis wide,
Na Scottis beirne amang them their should bide
To the Castle he wald nocht pas for eis,
Bot soiornit their with thing yat micht him pleis
Greit purueyance be sey was to them brocht,
With wine and aill, the best that couth be bocht.
Na watch was set, because they had na dout,
Of Scottis men that leuand was without.
Laubourit in mind they had been all that day,
Of aill and wine, aneuch chosin had they.
As beistlyke folk tuke of them self na keip,
In their vainis sone slaid the sleuthfull sleip.
Throw foul gluttony in swair swappit like swine
Their Chiftane was greit Bacchus god of wine.
This wise woman lang time amang yame was
Feill men scho warnit, and gart to Laglane pas.
Her self formest, quhill they with Wallace met,
Sum comfort than into his heart was set.
Quhen he them saw, he thankit God of micht,
Tythingis he askit the woman tauld him richt.
Sleipand as swyne ar all one falls mean,
Na Scottis man is in one cumpany.
Than Wallace said, gif they all drunkin be,
I call it best with fire for them to se.
Of good men than, three hundredth to him socht,
The woman had tald three ^ew Burges ya^ brocht
Out of the Town with nobill aill and breid,
And other stu^, als mekill as they micht leid.
They eit and drank, the Scottis men that mocht
The Nobillis than Iop hes to Wallace brocht.
Sadly he said, deir freindis now e se,
Our kyn ar slane, thairof is greit piety.
Throw foull murder, the greit despite is moir,
Now sunt remeid I wald we set thairfoir.
Suppois that I was maid Wardane to be,
Part ar away, sic chargis put to me.
And e ar heir cu^min of als good blude,
And richteous borne be auentur and als good
Als fordward, fair, als likly of persoun,
As ever was I, their for conclusioun.
Let us cheis five of this good cumpany,
Syne cauillis cast quha sall our master be.
Wallace and Boyd, and Craufurd of Renoun,
And Adam als, than Lord of Ricardtoun.
His Father than was vesyit with seiknes,
God had him taken into his lestand grace.
The Fyft Auchinlek, in weir ane Nobill man,
Cauillis to cast, about their five began.
It wald on him, for ocht they wald deuyse,
Continually quhill they had cassin thryse.
Than Wallace raise and out ane sword can draw*
He said I awow to the maker of aw.
And to Marie his Mother Virgin cleir,
My Vnkillis deith, now salbe sauld full deir.
With money ma of our deir worthy kyn,
First or I eit, or drink we sall begin.
For sleuth nor sleip, sall never remain with me,
Of this tempest, quhill I auengit be.
Than all inclynit richt humbill of ane accord,
And him ressauit as their Chiftane and Lord.
Wallace ane Lord, he may be clepit weill,
Thocht rural folk thairof have lytill seill
They deem na Lord, bot landis be their part,
Had he the world and be wretchit of heart.
He is na Lord bot to the worthynes,
It can nocht be but fredome Lordlynes.
At the Roddis, they make full money ane,
Quhilk worthy ar, thocht landis they have nane.
This discussing we leif Heraldis to end,
Unto my matter briefly I will wend.
Wallace commandit ane Burges for to get,
Fine calk ancuch, that his deir Nece micht set.
At ilk et quhair Sutheroun war on raw,
And twenty men he gart sone widdeis thraw.
Ilk man upon their arm ane pair threw,
Unto the Town full fast they can persew.
The woman past befoir them subtelly,
Calkit ilk et, they nedit nocht ga by.
Than festnit they the durris with widdeis fast,
To stapill and hesp with money sicker cast.
Wallace gart Boyd neir hand the Castle ga,
With fyftie men ane Ieopardy to ma.
Gif any Ischit, the fire quhen that they saw,
All fast to the et he ordanit them to draw.
The laif with him about the Bernis eid,
This true woman him seruit weill in neid.
With lynt and fire, that haistie kendill wald,
In euerilk nuik they festnit bleissis bald.
Wallace commandit to all his men about,
Na Sutheroun man that they should lat brek out.
Quhat ever he be, reskew nane of that kyn,
Fra the reid fire, him self sall pas thairin.
The l^and low sone lansit upon hicht,
Forsooth he said, this is ane plesand sicht.
To our hartis it salbe sum redres,

Unto the Justice, him self on loud can caw,
Let us to borgh our men fra our falls Law.

Deill nocht their land, the unlaw is ouir sair.
Thou had na richt, it salbe on the seen,
The rumor raise with caitfull cry and kene.
The baill fire brynt, richt brymly upon lofe,
To slepand men their walkning was vnsoft.
The sicht without was awful for to se,
In all the world na greitar pane micht be.
Than they within sufferit for to dwell,
That ever was wrocht bot purgatory or hell.
Ane pane of hell weill neir it micht be called,
Maid folk in fire hamperit in monyfald.
Feill biggingis brynt yat worthy war and wicht

In to the Freir Well that was both lang and deip.
Feill of them fell that brak out of that place,

Drounit and slane was all that harbryit their,
Men callis it the Freris blissing of Air.
Few folk of vale was leuit. Upon case,
In the Castle Lord Peircie fra that place.
Before the Air fra thine to Glasgou drew,
Of men and stuf it was to puruey new.

And gaif command in general of them all.

He maid his men in two partis to fair,
Graithit them weill without the town end.
He callit Auchinlek for he the passage kend.

Quhethir will e the Bischopis taill up beir,

For sickerly e seruit it best to nycht.
To bear his taill we sall in all our mycht,

Adam Wallace and Auchinlek was down.
Seuyn score with tham on the bak side of the town,
Richt fas^ they eid quhill they war out of sicht.
The tothir part arrayit them full richt,
Wallace and Boyd the plane streit up can ga.
Suthroun merwalit because thy saw na ma,
Their Ensene cryit vpone the Peircyis side.
With Bischop Beik that baldly durst abide,
Ane fair semblay was at their meting seen.
As fire on flynt it fairit them betuene,
The hardy Scottis richt awfully them abaid,
Broch feil to ground throw weid ye weil was maid,

Be force of hand gart money cruel kneill.
The strange stour raise as reik abone them fast.
Or mist throw Sone up to the clowdis past.
To help them self ilk ane had mekill neid.
The wourthy Scottis stude in ane felloun dreid.

And they on them greit wounder was to se.
The Peircyis men in weir war vsit weill,
Richt feirsly faucht and soneit nocht adeill.
Adam Wallace and Auchinlek come in,
Ane part of Suthroun richt sadly they twyn.
Returnit to them as nobill men of weir,
The Scottis gat room and money down they beir.
The new countit assaileit them sa fast,
Throw Inglismen main sloppis at the last.
Than Wallace self in to the felloun thrang.
With his guide Swerd that heuie was and lang.
At Peircyis face with ane guide will he bair,
Both bane, and brain, the fruschit steill throw schair.
Three hundredth men quhan Lord Peircy was deid,
Out of the gait the Bischop Beik they leid.
For than them thocht it was na time to bide,
By the freir Kirk to ane wod their beside.
In that forest forsuth they taryit nocht,
On fresch horse to Bothuell sone they socht.
Wallace followit with wourhty men and wicht.
Forfochtin they war and trauellit all the nycht,
it feill they slew in to the chase that day.
The Bischoppis self and guide men gat away.
Aymeir Wallange reskewit thaim in that place,
That Knicht full often did greit harm to Wallace.
Wallace began that nycht at ten nouris in Air,
On day be ix. in Glasgow semblit their.
Be ane ouir none at Bothuell ei he was.
Reprenit Wallange or he wald forthir pas.
Syne turnit agane as weill witnessis the buik,
To Dundaf raid and their resting he tuik.
Called guide Schir Iohne of their tythingis in Air,
Greit mane he maid he was nocht with him their.
Wallace soiornit in Dundaf at his will,
Five dayis out, quhill tythingis come him till.
Out of the hicht quhair guide men war forlorn,
For Buchane raise, Athole, Menteith, and Lorne.
Upon Argyle, ane fellone weir they make,
For Edwardis saik this they can undertake.
The Knicht Campbell in Argyle than was still,
With his guide men aganis King Eduardis will.
And keipit fre Lochaw his heritage,
Bot Makfadeane than did him greit outrage.
This Makfadeane to Inglismen was sworn,
Edward gaif him both Argyle and Lorne.
Falls Iohne of Lorne to that gift can accord,
In Ingland than he was ane new maid Lord.
Thus falsely he gaif out his heritage,
And tuke at London of Edward ane greit wage.
Duncane of Lorne it for the Landis straif,
Quhill Makfadeane ourset him with the laif.
Put him on force to guide Campbell the Knicht,
Quhilk in to weir was wise, wourthy, and wicht.
This Makfadeane was enterit in Scotland,
And merualously that Tyran tuke on hand.
With his power the quhilk I spak of Air,
Their three Lordschippis all semblit to him their.
Fyftene thousand of curssit folk in deid,
Of all gadering in oist he had to leid.
And money of them was out of Irland brocht,
Barnis nor wife they pepill sparit nocht.
Waistit the land als fer as they micht ga,
They beiftly folk couth nocht bot byrne and sla,
In to Lochaw he enterit suddandly,
The guide Knicht Ca^pbell saw guide defense for thy.
To Crag Hummyr with three hundredth he eid,
That strenth they held for all their cruel deid.
Syne brak the brig that they mich nocht our pas,
Bot throw ane furd quhair narrow passage was.
Abandounly Campbell aganis them baid,
Fast vpone Awfe that was both deip and braid.
Makfadeane was vpone the tothir side,
And their on force behufit him for to bide.
For at the Furd he durst not enter out,
For guide Campbell micht set him than in dout.
Makfadeane socht and ane small passage fand,
Had he layser they micht pas of that land.
Betuix ane Roche and the greit Watter side,
Bot four in front they micht nane gang nor ride.
In to Lochaw was beistis greit plente,
And quhill he thocht their with his oist to be.
And vthir stuf that they had with them brocht,
Bot all his cost auailit him richt nocht.
Duncane of Lorne has seen this suddand case,
Fra guide Campbell he went to seik Wallace.
Sum help to get of their torment and tene,
Togidder befoir in Dunde they had been.
Lernand at Scole in to their tender age,
He thocht to slaik Makfadeanis hie curage.
G^michell than with Duncane forth him dicht,
Ane gyde he was and fute man wounder wicht.
Sone gat they with quhair Wallace lugir was,
With their complaynt to his presence they pas.
Erll Malcolme als the Lennox held at peis,
With his guide men to Wallace can he preis.
To him their come guide Richard of Lundy,
In to Dundaf he wald na langar ly.
Schir Iohne the Grahame als bounit him to ride,
Makfadeanis weir sa greuit him that tide.
How Wallace slew Makfadean. Ca. ij.
THan Wallace thocht his greit power to so,
In quhat array he reullit that cuntre.
The Rukbie than keipit with greit wrang,
Striueling Castle that staluart was and strange.
Quhen Wallace come be south it in ane vaill,
To Erll Malcolme he said he wald it saill.
In diverse partis, he gart disseuer his men,
Of their power that Suthroun should nocht ken.
Erll Malcolme baid in buschment out of sicht,
Wallace with him tuk guide Schir John ye Knicht
And ane hundredth of wise weir men but dout,
Throw Striueling raid gif any wald Ische out.
Towart the Brig the ganest way they pas,
Quhen Rukbie saw quhair that their power was,
He tuk seuin scoir of Archearis that war their,
Vpone Wallace they followit wounder sair.
That feill bikker did tham mekill deir,
Wallace in hand grippit ane nobill speir.
Agane returnit and hes the formast slane.
Schir John the Grahame that mekil was of mane
Amang them raid with ane guide speir in hand.
The first he slew that he befoir him fand,
Vpone ane vthir his speir in so under eid.
Ane swerd he drew, quhilk helpit him in neid.
Inglis Archearis vpone them can renew.
That his guide Horse with arowis sone they slew.
On fute he was quhen Wallace has it seen.
He lichtit sone with men of Arms kene.
Amang the rout fechtand full wounder fast,
The Inglismen returnit at the last.
At the Castle they wald have been full fane,
Bot Erll Malcolme with men of mekill mane,
Betuix the Suthroun and the ettis eid.
Money they flew that douchty was in deid.
In the greit preis Wallace and Rukbie met,
With his guide sword ane straik vpone him set.
Derfly to deid the auld Rukbie he draif,
His tua sonnis eschaipit amang the laif.
In the Castle be adventure they eid,
With threttie men na ma chaipit that dreid
The Lennox men with their guide Lord that was,
Fra the Castle they said they wald nocht pas,
For weill they wist it micht nocht haldin be.
For na lang time for thy thus ordanit he.
Erll Malcolme tuke the house to keip that tide,
Wallace wald nocht fra his first purpose bide.
Instance he maid to this guide Lord and wise,
Fra thine to pas he should on na kyn wise.
Quhill that he had Striueling the Castle strange,
True men him tauld they micht nocht hald it lang.
Than Wallace thocht was may on Makfadeane
Of Scottis men he had slain money ane,
Wallace auowit that he should wrokkin be.
On that Rebald or ellis thairfoir de,
Of tyranny King Edward thocht him guide,
Law borne he was and als of sympill bluid.
Thus Wallace was sair greuit in his intent,
To this journey richt ernestfully he went.
At Striueling Brig assemblit to him richt,
Two thousand men that wourthy war and wicht.
Towart Argyle he bounit for to ride,
Duncane of Lorne was their true sicker gyde.
Of auld Rukbie the quhilk we spak of Air,
Two sonnis on life in Striueling leuit their.
Quhen thai Brethir consauit all at richt.
This house to hald that they na langar micht,
For cause quhy they wantit men and meit,
With Erll Malcolme they maid them for to treit.
Grace of their lyfis and they that with them was,
Gaif ouir the house syne couth in Ingland pas.
On the third day that Wallace fra them raid,
With King Edward full money eir they baid.
In Brucis weir agane come in Scotland,
Strueling to keip the ane of them tuke on hand.
Mentioun of Bruce is often in Wallace buik,
To fend his richt full mekill pane he tuik.
Quhairfore should I heir any tarry ma,
To Wallace forth now schortly will I ga.
Duncane of Lorne Gilmichell fra him send,
Ane spy to be for he the cuntre kend.
Be our party was past Strath fillane,
The small fute folk began to irk ilkane.
And horse als on force behufit to faill,
Than Wallace thocht that cumpany to waill.
Guide men he said this is nocht meit for us.
In brokin array and we cum on them thus,
We may tak skaith and harm our fais small,
To them in like we may nocht assembill all.
Tarry we lang ane plane field quhill they get.
Vpone them sone sa weill we may nocht set.
Part we man leif us followand to be,
With me sall pas our power in to three,
Five hundredth first to him self has he taken.
Of westland men war wourthy knawin ilkane.
To schir Iohne the Grahame als money ordanit he,
And five hundredth to Richard of Lundie,
In that part was Wallace of Ricardtoun.
In all good deid he was ay reddy boun,
Five hundredth left and micht not with them ga.
Suppois that they to bide was woundir wa,
Thus Wallace oist begouth to tak the hicht,
Our ane montane syne passit out of sicht.
In Glendochar their spy met them agane,
With Lord Campbell then was our folk richt fane.
At their meiting greit blythnes micht be seen,
Three hundredth led that cruel war and kene,
He comfort them and bad them have na dreid.
one beistly folk wantis wapnis and weid,
Sone will they fle scharply and we persew.
Be Loch Douchar full suddandly them drew.
Than Wallace said ane life we sall all ta,
For heir is nane will fra his fallow ga.
The spy they send the enter for to se,
Upon the Mos ane Scurreour sone fand he.
To scour the land Makfadeane had him send,
Out of Cragmore that day he thocht to wend.
Gilmichell fast upon him followit their,
With ane guide Swerd that weill and scharply schair
Maid quyte of him that tythingis tald he nane,
The out spy thus was loissit fra Makfadeane.
Than Wallace oist upon their fuit they licht.
Their horse they left thocht they war never sa wicht.
For Mos and Crag they micht na langar dre,
Than Wallace said quha gangis best lat se.
Throw out the mos delyuerly they eid,
Syne tuke the hals quhairof they had may dreid,
Endlang the schore ay three in front they past,
Quhill all within their semblit at the last.
Lord Campbell said we have cheisit this hald,
I trow to God their walknyng sall be called.
Heir is na gait to sle one pepill can.
Bot rochis heich and watteris deip and wan.
Auchtene hundredth of douchty men in deid,
On the greit oist but mair process they eid,
Fechtand in front and meikill maistrie maid,
The frayit folk buskit withoutin baid.
Rudly to ray they ruschit them agane,
Greit part of them was men of mekill mane.
Good Wallace men sa stoutly can them steir,
The battall on bak five aker breid they beir.
In to the stour seill tyrant gart they kneill,
Wallace in hand had ane guide stat of steill.
Quhom ever he hit to ground brymlie them bair,
Roumit him about ane large rude and mair.
Schir John the Graham in deid was richt worthy.
Guide Campbell als, and Richard of Lundy.
Adam Wallace and Robert Boyd in feir,
Amang their fais quhair dedis war sauld deir.
The felloun stour was awful for to se,
Makfadeane than sa greit debait maid he.
With Irland men hardy and corageous,
The stalwart strife richt hard and perilous,
Abundance of blude fra woundis wide and man.
Stikkit to deid on groun^ lay money man.
Tua houris large in to the sto^r they stand*
The ^^^rssest they a ^ch of fech^ing and
That ^op himself ^ill wist nocht (...),
Bot Wallace men wald nocht in sounder twyn.
To help them self they war of hardy will,
Of Irland blude full fellonly they spill.
With fell fechting maid sloppis throw the thrang,
On the false part our wicht weirmen sa dang.
That they to bide micht have na langar micht,
The Irland Folk than maid them for the flicht.
In Craggis clam, and sum in watter flet.
Tua thousand their drounit withoutin let,
Borne Scottis men baid still in the feld.
Kest wapnis them fra and on their kneis kneild.
With pietuous woce they cryit on Wallace,
For Goddis saik to take them in his grace.
Greuit he was bot reuth of them he had,
Ressauit them fair with countenance full sad.
Of our awin blud we should have greit piete,
Luk e slay nane of Scottis will oldin be,
Of outland men lat nane chaip with the life.
Makfadeane fled for all his felloun strife.
Unto ane Caif within ane clift of stane,
Under Cragmoir with fyftene is he gane.
Duncane of Lorne, his leif at Wallace ast,
On Makfadeane with worthy men he past.
He grantit him to put them all to deid,
They left nane syne bot brocht Wallace his heid.
Vpone ane speir throw the field it bair,
The Lord Campbell, syne hynt it be the hair.
Heich on Cragmoir he maid it for to stand.
Still on ane stane for honor of Irland.
The Lyflait men that war of Scotland borne,
Sone at his faith he gart them be suorne.
Restorit them that wald cum to his leis.
He leit slay nane that wald cum to his peis.
After this deid in Lorne syne couth he fair,
Rewllit the land had been in mekill cair
In Ardcatan ane counsall he gart cry.
Quhair money man come to his Seneoury.
All Lorne he gaif to Duncane that was wicht,
And bad him hald in Scotland with the richt.
And thou sall brouk this land in heritage,
Thy brothir sone in London has greit wage.

I wald tyne nane that Verity micht saif.
Money true Scot to Wallace couth persew,
At Ardcatane fra feill strenthis they drew.
Ane guide Knicht come and with him men sexty,
He had been often in money strange ieoperdy.
With Inglismen and soneit nocht adeill,
Ay fra their faith he fendit him full weill.
Keipit him fre thowcht King Edward had sworn,
Schir Iohne Ramsay that richteous was borne,
Of Ouchtirhous and vthir landis lord,
And Schirref als as my buke will record.
Of nobill blude and auld ancestrie,
Continewit weill with wourthy Cheualrie.
In to Stroonchane lang time he had been,
At greit debait amang his enemyis kene.
Richt wichtly wan his leuing in to weir,
To him and his Suthroun did meikill deir.
Weill he eschewit and sufferit greit distres,
His sone was callit the flour of courtlynes
As witnessis weill in to this schort trety,
After the Bruce quha reidis that history,
He reullit weill both in to weir and peis,
Alexander Ramsay to name he hecht but leis.
Quhen it was weir to arms he him kest,
Under the Croun he was ane of the best.
In time of peax to courtlynes he eid,
Bot to gentrice he tuke nane vthir heid,
Quhat gentill man had nocht with Ramsay been,
Of courtlynes they comptit him not ane prene.
Fredome and truth he had as men wald as,
Sen he began nane better Squyar was.
Roxburgh ald he wan richt manfully,
Syne held it lang quhill tratouris tresonabilly.
Causit his deith I dar nocht tell ow how,
Of sic thingis I will ga by as now.
I have had blame to say the suthfastnes,
Thairfoir I will bot lichtly ryn that cais.
Bot it be thing that planely sclanderit is,
For sic I trow they should nocht demena mis.
Of Alexander as now I say na moir,
His fader come as I tald ow befoir.
Wallace of him richt full greit comfort hais,
For he weill couth do harmyng to his fais.
In weir he was richt mekill for to pryse,
Bosy and true both, sober, wicht and wise.
Ane guide Prelat als to Ardchatane socht,
Of his Lordschip as than he broukit nocht.
This wourthy Clark cumin of the lynage,
Of Siuclare blude nocht forty ere of age.
Chosin he was be the Papis consent,
Of Dunkeld Lord was maid with guide intent.
Bot Inglismen that Scotland grippit haill,
Of benefice they leit him brouk bot small.
Quhen he saw weill thairfoir he micht nocht mute,
To saif his life three eris he dwelt in Bute.
Leiffit as he micht and keipit ay guide part,
Under saustie of James than Lord Stewart.
To good Wallace quhilk Scotland wan with pane.
Restorit this Lord to his leuing again,
And money ma that lang had been ourthrawin.
Wallace them put richteously to their awin.
The small oist als quhilk I spak of Air.
In to the hicht that Wallace leuit their.
Come to the field quhair Makfadeane had been,
Tuke that was left both weid and wapnis schene.
Throw Lorne syne past als gudly as they can,
Of their number they had not loissit ane man.
On the fifth day wan to Ardchatane,
Quhair Wallace baid with guide men money ane.
He welcumit them vpone ane gudly wise,
And said they war richt mekill for to pryse.
All true Scottis he honorit in to weir.
Gaif that he wan, him self keipit na geir.
How Wallace wan Sanct Iohnston. Ca. iij.
QWhen Wallace wald na langar soiorne their,
Fra Ardchatan out throw the land they fair.
Towart Dunkeld with guide men of renoun.
His may thocht than was of Sanct Iohnstoun.
He callit Ramsay, that guide Knycht of greit vaill.
Sadly auysit besocht him of counsel
Of Sanct Iohnstoun now have I rememberance
Their have I been and loissit men throw chance.
Bot ay for ane we gart ten of them de,
And it me think that is na mendis to me.

And lat them wit they occupy heir wrang.
Than Ramsay said that town they man not keip.
The wallis ar lawt suppois the dykis be deip.

Fill up the dyke that we may planely ga.
In haill ba^tell ane thousand ouir atanis,
Fra this power, they sall nocht hald one wanis.
Wallace was glaid that he sic comfort maid,
Forth talkand thus unto Dunkeld they raid.
Three dayis their they ludgeit with plesance,
Quhill time they had forsene their ordinance.
Ramsay gart big strange Bastaileis of tree,
Be good wrichtis the best in that cuntre.
Quhen yai war wrocht, betaucht yame me^ to leid

Schir Iohne Ramsay richt gudely was yair gyde
Reullit them weill, at his will for to bide.

With eird and stane they fillit dykis fast.
Flaikis they laid on tymmer lang and wicht,
Ane room passage to the wallis they dicht.
Feill Bastaileis richt starkly up they raise,
Good men of arms sone to assail gais.
Schir Iohne ye Grahame, and Ramsay yat was wicht,
The Turat brig assegit in all yair micht.
And Wallace self at mid side of the town
With men of arms that was to bargane boun.
The Sutheroun men maid greit defense yat tide
With Artaile that felloun was to bide.
With Tablaster, gane, and stanis fast,
And hand gunnis richt brymlie out they cast.

At hand straikis fra they togidder met,
With Sutheroun blude their wappinnis sone yai wet.

Into the stour richt baldly can them beir.
Bot all for nocht auaillit them their deid,
The Scottis throw force upon yame in they eid
Ane thousand men ouir wallis eid haistely,
Into the town raise hiddeous noyis and cry.
Ramsay and Grahame the Turat it hes wyn,
And enterit in, quhair greit strife did begin.
Ane true Squyar quhilk Rothue^ hecht to name,
Come to ye assalt with good Schir John ye Grahame.
Threttie with him of men yat preuit weill

Quhen that the Scottis assemblit on ather side,
Na Sutheroun was that micht their dynt abide
Two thousand sone was fuleit under feit,
Of Sutheroun blude they stikkit in the streit.
Schir John Stewart saw weill the town was tynt,
Tuik him to slicht, and wald na langer stynt.
In ane licht Barge, and with him men sextie,
The watter down socht succor at Dundie.
Wallace baid still, quhill the feird day at morn,
Add left nane their that was of Ingland borne.
Riches they gat of gold and other good,
Pleneist the town, agane with Scottis good.
Ro^huen he left, their Capitane to be,
In heritage gait him the office of fe.
Of all Stratherne and Schiref of the town,
Syne in ye North good Wallace maid him boun.
In Abirdene he gart ane counsall cry,
True Scottis men should assembill haistely.
To Cowper he raid, to vesy that Abbay,
The Inglis Abbot was fled fra thine away.
Bischop Sinklair without langar abaid,
Met them at Glammis, syne forth with yame he raid.
Into Brichen they ludgeit all that nicht,
Sone on the morn Wallace gart graith at richt,
Displayit on breid the Baner of Scotland,
In good array, with Nobill men at hand.
Gart planely cry that sauit should be nane,
Of Sutherou^ blude, quhair yai micht be ouirtane
In plane battle throw out ye Meirnis they ride
The Inglismen that durst them nocht abide,
Befoir the Oist full feiritly they fle,
To Du^notter ane strenth within the se.
Na farther they micht wyn out of the land,
They assemblit their quhil yai war four thousand
To ye Kirk yai ran, yai thocht girth to have taken,
The laif remanit upon the Roch of stane.
The Bischop than began tretie to ma,
Their lyfis to get, out of the land to ga.
Bot they war rad, and durst nocht weill affy,
Wallace in fire gart set all haistely.
Brynt up the Kirk, and all that was thairin,
Attour the Roch the laif ran with greit din.
Sum hang on craigis richt duilfully to de,
Sum lap, sum fell, sum flotterit in the se.
Na Sutheroun on life was leuit in that hald,
And they within, they brynt in powder called.
Quhen this was done, they fell on kneis down,
At the Bishop askit absolutioun.
Than Wallace leuch, said I forgif ow all,
Ar e weirmen that repentis for sa small.
They rewit us nocht into the town of Air,
Our true Barrounis, quhen yat yai hangit yair,
To Abirdene than saifly can they pas,

Ane hundredth Schippis, yat Ruther buir and Air
To turs their gudis in hauin was bid and their.
Bot Wallace Oist come on them suddandly,
Their schaipit nane of all that greit navy.
Bot feill seruandis in them was leuit nane,
At ane Eb^sey the Scottis is on them gane.
Tuik out the geir, syne set the Schippis in fire
The men on land, they brynt both bane and lyre.
eid nane away bot Preistis, wyfis and barnis,
Maid they debait, they chaipit nocht but harmis.
Into Buchane Wallace maid him to ride,
Quhair Lord Bewinout was ordanit to abide.
Erll he was maid bot of schort time befoir,
He bruikit it nocht for all his busteous schoir.
Quhen he wist weill that Wallace cu^mand was,
He left the land, and couth to Slanis pas.
And syne be Schip fled in Ingland agane,
Wallace raid throw the North land into plane.
At Cromarrie feill Inglismen they slew,
The worthy Scottis unto him couth persew.
Returnit agane, and come to Abirdene,
With his biyith Oist upon the Lammes euin.
Stabillit the land as him thocht best should be,
Syne with ane Oist he passit to Dundie.
How Wallace laid ane Seige to Dundie, and how he gait battle at the brig end
of Striuiling to Kirkinghame yat was Thesaurar to Edward King, and to ye Erll
or Warrane. Ca. iiij.
GArt set ane Seige about the Castle strange,
I leif him their, and farther I will gang.
Schir Aymeir Walla^ge haistir him full fast
Into Ingland with his haill houshald past.
Bothwell he left was Murray is heritage,
And tuik him than bot to King Edwardis wage.
Thus his awin land forsuik for ever mair,
Of Wallace deid greit tythingis tald he their.
Als Inglismen sair murnit in their mude,
That loissit heir both life landis and good.
Edward as than couth nocht in Scotland fair,
Bot Kirkinghame that was his Thesaurair.
With him ane Lord, than Erll was of Warrane,
He chargit them with numberis money ane.
Richt weill besene in Scotland for to ride,
At Striuiling still, he ordanit them to bide:
Quhill he micht cum with ordinance of Ingland,
Scotland agane he thocht to tak on hand.
This Oist past forth, and had bot lytill dreid,
The Erll Patrik ressauit them at Tweid.
Malice he had at good Wallace befoir,
Lang time bypast, and than Incressit moir.
Bot throw ane case it hapnit of his wife,
Dunbar fra him scho held into that strife.
Throw the supple of Wallace into plane,
Bot he be mean gat his Castle agane.
Lang time or than, and it he couth nocht ceis,
Agane Wallace he preuit in money preis.
With Inglismen suppleit them at his micht,
Contrair Scotland yai wrocht full greit vnricht.
Their musture than was awful for to se,
Of fechtand men thousandis war sextie.
To Striuiling brig past or they lykit to bide,
To Erll Malcolme ane Seige they laid yat tide
And thocht to keip the command of their King,
Bot good Wallace wrocht for ane other thing.
Dundie he left, and maid ane good Chiftane,
With two thousand to keip that house of stane.
Of North land men, and dwellaris of Dundie.
That samin nicht, to Sanct Iohnstoun went he.
Upon the morn to Schiref mure he raid,
And their ane quhyle in good array he baid.
Schir Iohne ye grahame said we haif vndertane
With les power, sic thing that weill is gane.
Tha^ Wallace said, quhair sic things cu^mis of neid
We should thank God, that makis us to speid.
Bot neir the brig my purpois is to be,
And wirk for them sum subtle Ieopardie.
Ramsay answerit, the brig we may keip weill,
Of way about, the Sutheroun hes lytill feill.
Wallace send Iop the battle for to set,
The Tuisday nixt, to fecht withouttin let.
On Setterday unto the brig they raid,
Of good plane buird, was weill and Jointly maid.
Gart wachis wait, that nane should to them pas,
Ane wricht he tuik, the subtillest that their was:
And ordanit him to saw the buird in two,
Be the myd trest, that nane micht ouir it ga.
On Charnall bandis naillit it full sone,
Syne fillit with clay, as na thing had been done.
The the other end he ordanit for to be
How it should stand upon the Rollaris of tree.
Quhen ane war out, that the laif down should fall,
Him self under, he ordanit their with all.
Bund on the trest, in ane Cradill to sit,
To lous the pyn quhen Wallace leit him wit.
Bot with ane horn quhen it was time to be,
In all the Oist na man should blaw bot he.
The day approchit of the greit battall,
The Inglismen for power wald nocht faill.
Ay sex they war, agane ane of Wallace,
Fyftie thousand maid them to battle place.
The remanent baid at the Castle still,
Both field and house they thocht to tak at will.
The worthy Scottis upon the the other side,
The plane field tuik, on fuit maid them to bide.
Hew Kirkinghame the vangard than led he,
With twenty thousand of lyklie men to se.
Threttie thousand the Erll of Warrane had,
Bot he did than, as the wise man him bad.
All the first Oist befoir him ouir was send,
Sum Scottis man that weill the manner kend:
Bad Wallace blaw, and said they war anew,
He haistit nocht, bot sadly couth persew.
Quhill Warranis Oist, thick on the brig he saw,
Fra Iop the horn he hint and couth it blaw:
Sa asperly, and warnit good Iohne wricht,
The Rollar out he straik with greit slicht.
The laif eid down quhen the pynnis out gais,
Ane hiddeous cry amang the pepill raise.
Both horse and men into the watter fell,
The hardy Scottis that wald na langer dwell.
Set on the laif with straikis sad and sair,
Of them their ouir, as than souerit they wair.
At the foir breist they preuit hardely
Wallace and Grahame, Boyd, Ramsay, and Lundy.
All in the stour fechtand face to face,
The Sutheroun often bak reirit in that place.
At the first straik five aiker braid and mair,
Wallace on fuit ane greit scharp speir he bair.
Amang the thickest of the preis he gais,
On Kirkinghame ane straik he cho^^n bais.
In the birneis that polist was full ^cht,
The pruneand heid the plaitis peirsit richt.
Throw the body stikkit him but reskew,
Der^ly to deith that Chiftane was adieu.
Both man and horse at that straik he bair down,
The Inglis Oist quhilk war in battle boun:
Comfort they tynt quhen yair Chiftane was slane
And money ane to fle began in plane.
it worthy men baid still into that steid,
Quhill ten thousand war brocht unto the deid.
Than fled the laif, and micht na langer bide,
Succor they socht in money diverse side
Sum eist, sum west, and sum fled to the North,
Seuin thousand large, atanis flotterit in Forth
Plungit in deip, drownit without mercy,
Nane left on life of all that fell mean.
Of Wallace Oist na man was slane of vaill,
Bot Andro Murray into that strange battaill.
The South part yan yat saw yair men was tynt
Als feirsly fled as fire dois fra the flynt.
The place they left, Striuiling Castle and town,
Towart Dunbar, in greit haist maid yame boun.
Quhe^ Wallace oist had wyn ye field throw micht
Tuik up the brig and lowsit good Iohne wricht.
On the flearis syne followit wounder fast,
Erll Malcolme als out of the Castle past.
With Lennox men to stuf the chase good speid,
Ay be the way they gart feill Sutheroun bleid.
In the Torwod they gart full money de,
The Erll of Warrane that can full feirsly fle:
With Corspatrik that graithly was his gyde,
Vnchangit horse out throw the land they ride.
Straicht to Dunbar, bot few with them yai leid
Money war slane ouir sleuthfully that fled.
The Scottis horse had run wounder lang,
Money gaif ouir, and micht na farther gang.
Wallace and Grahame ever togidder baid,
At Hadingtoun full greit slauchter they maid.
Of Inglismen quhen their horse tyrit had,
Quhen Ra^say come, good Wallace was full glaid.
With him was Boyd and Richard of Lundy,
Three thousand haill was of good Cheualry.
And Adam Wallace, als of Ricardtoun,
With Erll Malcolme yame fand at Hadingtoun.
The Scottis men on slauchter taryit was,
Quhill to Dunbar, the two Chiftanis couth pas.
Full sytefull war for their contrary case,
Wallace followit quhill they gat in that place.
Of their best men, and Kirkinghame of Renoun,
Threttie thousand was deid but redemptioun.
Beside Beltoun Wallace returnit agane,
To follow mair than was it bot in vane.
IN Hadingtoun ludgeing he maid all nicht,
Upon the morn to Striuiling passit richt.
On ye Assumptioun day befell this case,
Ay louit be our Lord of his good grace.
Conuoyar often, he was to good Wallace,
And helpit him in money sindrie place.
Wallace in haist sone after this battaill,
Ane greit aith tuik of all the Barrounis haill.
That with good will wald cum to his presence,
He hecht them als to bide at their defense.
Schir Iohne Menteith was yan of Arrane Lord
To Wallace come, and maid ane plane concord.
With witness their, with his aith he him band,
Lawtie to keip to Wallace and Scotland.
Quha wald nocht with fre will to richt apply,
Wallace be force, puneist them rigorously.
Part put to deith, part set in presoun strange,
Greit word of him throw both yir Realms rang
Dundie they gat, sone be ane schort tretie,
Bot for their lyfis they fled away be see.
Inglis Capitanis that house had in hand,
Left Castellis fre, and stall out of the land.
Within ten dayis, after this time was gane,
Inglis Capitanis in Scotland was leit nane.
Except Berwik and Rorburgh Castle wicht,
it Wallace thocht to bring them to the richt
THat time their was ane worthy true B^roun
To name he hecht Cristal of Setoun.
In Iedburgh wod, for saiftie he had been,
Agane Sutheroun full weill he couth contene.
Edward cout nocht, fra Scottis faith him get,
Thocht he him gaif ane muleou^ of gold weil met
Herbottill fled fra Iedburgh Castle wicht,
Towart Ingland, their Setoun met him richt.
With forty men Cristall in bargane baid,
Agane seuin scoir, and mekill maistrie maid.
Slew that Capitane, and money cruel man,
Full greit riches in that Journey he wan.
Houshald and gold, as they should pas away,
The quhilk befoir they keipit money day.
Iedburgh he tuik, and Rothuen leuit he,
At Wallace will their Capitane to be.
Bald Setoun syne to Louthiane maid repair,
In this story e may heir of him mair.
And into Bruce, quha lykis for to reid,
He was with him in money cruel deid.
Good Wallace than full sadly can deuyse,
To reull the land with worthy men and wise.
Capitanis he maid, and Schireffis yat was good
Part of his Kyn, and of true other blude.
His deir Cousing in Edinburgh ordanit he,
With true Craufurd, that ay was full worthy.
Keipar of it, with Nobill men at wage,
In Manwell than he had good heritage.
Scotland was fre, that lang in baill had been,
Wallace it wan fra our falls enemeis kene.
Greit Governor in Scotland he couth ring,
Waitand ane time, to get his richteous King.
Fra Inglismen, that held him in bandoun,
Lang wrangously, fra his awin richteous Croun.
The aucht part of yis buik declairis how Wallace put Corspatrik out of
Scotland.
Ca. j.
Five monethis yus, scotland stuid in good rest
Ane cou^sall cryit, yame thocht it was ye best.
In sanct Iohnstoun quhair it should haldin be
Assemblit Clerk, Barruun, and Birges fre.
Bot Corspatrik wald nocht cum at their call,
Baid in Dunbat, and maid scorn at them all.
They spak of him, feill Lordis in yat Parliament
Than Wallace said, will e heirto consent:
Forgif him fre, all thing that is bypast,
Sa he will cum, and grant he hes trespast.
Fra this time forth keip lawtie to our Croun,
They grant thairto, Clerk, Burges, and Barrou^.
With haill consent their writing to him send,
Richt lawly thus, they them to him commend.
Besocht him san, as ane than of the land,
To cum and tak sum Governance on hand.
Lichtly he leuch, in scorn as it had been,
And said he had sic Message seildin seen.
That Wallace now, as Governor sall Ring,
Heir is greit falt of ane good Prince and King.
That King of Kyle I can nocht understand,
Of him I held never it ane fur of land.
That Bachiller trowis, for Fortoun schawis her quheil
Their with to lest it sall not lang be weil.
Bot to ow Lordis, and e will understand,
I make ow wise, I aucht to make na band.
Als fre I am in this Regioun to Ring
Lord of mine awin, as ever was Prince or King.
In Ingland als greit part of land I haif,
Manrent thairof their will na man me craif.
Quhat will e mair, I warn ow I am fre,
For our Summoundis e get na mair of me.
To Sanct Iohnstoun this writ he send agane,
Befoir the Lordis was manifest in plane.
Quhen Wallace hard the Erll sic answer makis
Ane greit heit throw curage than he takis.
For he wist weill their should be bot ane King
Of this Regioun atanis for to Ring.
Ane King of Kyle, for that he callit Wallace,
Lordis he said, this is ane uncouth case.
Be he sufferit, we have war than it was,
Thus raise he up, and maid him for to pas.
God hes us toillit to do sa for the lait,
In life or deith, in faith we sall him haif.
Or gar him grant quhome he haldis for his Lord,
Or ellis war schame, in stor^e to record.
I vow to God, with eis he sall nocht be,
Into this Realm, bot ane of us sall de.
Les than be cum and know his richteous King
In this Regioun weill both we sall nocht ring.
His lichtly scorn he sall repent full soir,
Bot power faill or I sall end thairfoir.
Sen in this eird is ordanit me na rest,
Now God be Judge the richt he knawis best.
At that counsall langer he taryit nocht,
With two hundredth fra sanct Iohnstoun he socht.
To the Counsall maid Instance or he eid,
They should contene, and of him have na dreid.
I am bot ane, and for good cause I ga,
Towart Kingorne the ganest way they ta.
Upon the morn over Forth south they couth pas
On his veyage he haist it wounder fast
Robert Lawder at Mussilburgh met Wallace,
Fra Inglismen he keipit weill his place.
Couth nane him treit, Knicht, Squyar, nor Lord,
With King Edward for to be at concord.
On Erll Patrik to pas he was full glaid,
Sum said befoir the Bas he wald have had.
Good men come als, with Cristall of Setoun,
Than Wallace was four hundredth of Renoun
Ane Squyar Lyle that weill the cuntre knew,
With twenty men to Wallace couth persew.
Beside Lyntoun, and to them tald he than,
That Erll Patrik with money Lyklie man:
At Cokburnis peth he had his gaddering maid,
And to Dunbar wald cum withouttin baid.
Than Lawder said it war the best think me,
Fa^^er to pas in Dunbar or he be.
Wallace answerit we may at laiser ride,
With one power he thinkis bargane to bide.
And of ane thing, e sall weill understand,
Ane hardyer Lord is nocht into this land.
Micht he be maid, true steidfast to ane King,
Be wit and force he can do mekill thing.
Bot wilfully he lykis to tyne him sell,
Thus raid they forth, and wald na langer dwell.
Be eist Dunbar, quhair men them tald on case,
How Erll Patrik was warnit of Wallace.
Neir Innerwik cheisit ane field at waill,
With nine hundredth of lyklie men to waill.
Four hundredth was with Wallace in the richt,
And they anon approchit to their sicht.
Greit falt their was of good tretie betuene,
To make concord, and that full sone was seen.
Without reheirs of actioun in that tide,
On ather part togidder fast they ride.
The stour was strange, and wounder perrillous,
Contenit lang with deidis Cheualrous.
Money their deit of cruel Scottis blude,
Of this tretie the matter is nocht good.
Thairfoir I ceis to tell the distructioun,
Piety it was, and all of ane Natioun.
Bot Erll Patrik the field left at the last,
Richt few with him to Cokburnis peth yair past.
Aggreuit sair that his men thus was tynt,
Wallace returnit, and wald na langer stynt.
Towart Dunbar, quhair suithfast men him tald,
Na purueyance was left into that hald.
Nor man of fence, all had been with their Lord,
Quhen Wallace hard the sicker true record:
Dunbar he tuik all haill at his bandoun,
Gaif it to keip to Cristall of Setoun.
Quhilk stuffit it weill, with men and good vittaill
Upon the morn, Wallace that wald nocht faill
With three hundredth to Cokburnis peth he socht,
Erll Patrik Ischit, for bide him wald he nocht.
Sone to the Park Wallace ane range hes set,
To Bonkill wod Corspatrik fled but let.
And out of it, to Norhame passit he,
Quhen Wallace saw it micht na better be:
To Caldstreme raid, and ludgeit him on Tweid,
Erll Patrik than in all haist can him speid:
And passit by or Wallace power raise,
Without resting in Ettrik Forest gais.
Wallace followit, bot he wald nocht assaill,
Ane range to make, as than it micht nocht vaill.
Quir few he had, the strenth was thick and strange
Twelf mile on breid, and thairto twyis als lang.
Into Cokholme Erll Patrik baid at rest,
For mair power Wallace past in the west.
Erll Patrik than him graithit haistelie,
In Ingland past, to get him their supple.
Out throw the land richt eirnistly cout pas,
To Anthony Beik, that Lord of Durame was.
Wallace him put out of Glasgow befoir,
And slew Perse, their malice was the moir.
The Bischop Beik gart sone greit power rise,
Northumbirland, upon ane awful wise.
They ordanit Bruce in Scotland for to pas,
To win his awin, bot evil dissauit he was.
They gart him trow that wallace was Rebel,
And thocht to tak the Kinrik on him sell.
For falls they war, and ever it hes been,
Lawtie and treuth was ever in Wallace seen.
To fend ye richt was all be tuik on hand,
And thocht to bring, the Bruce fre to his land.
Of this matter as now I tarry nocht,
With strange power Sutheroun togidder socht.
Fra Oyis watter assemblit haill to Tweid,
The land Oist was threttie thousand in deid.
Of Themis mouth send Schippis be the sea,
To keip Dunbar that nane should them supple.
Erll Patrik past with twenty thousand but let,
Befoir Dunbar ane stalwart Seige he set.
The Bishop Beik, and Robert Bruce baid still,
With ten thousand, in Norame at their will.
Wallace be this, that fast was lauborand
In Louthiane come with good meu five thousand
Richt weill besene into their armor bricht,
Thocht to reskew the Setoun bald and wicht.
Under ester that first nicht ludgeit he,
Hay come to him with ane good Cheualrie,
In Down Forest all that time he had been,
He had the cu^ming of the Sutheroun seen.
Fyftie he had of wise men into weir,
They tald Wallace of Patrikis greit affeir.
Hay said forsooth, and e micht him ouirset,
Power agane richt sone he may nocht get.
My counsall is, that we gif him battall,
He thankit him of comfort and counsall.
And said friend Hay in this cause that I wend,
Sa that we wyn I rek nocht for to end.
Richt suith it is that anis we mon de,
Into the richt quha should in terror be?
Erll Patrik their ane Messinger gart pas,
Tald Anthony Beik that Wallace cu^mand was.
Of this tythingis the Bischop was full glaid,
Ane mendis of him full fane he wald have had.
But mair prolong throw Laumyr mure yai raid,
Neir the Spot mure in buschment still he baid.
Quhair Erll Patrik than ordanit for to be,
Wallace of Beik, vnwarnit than was he.
it he befoir was nocht haistie in deid,
Bot than he put both him and his in dreid.
Upon swyft horse scurriouris raid betuene,
The cu^ming than of Erll Patrik hes seen.
The house he left, and to the mure is gane,
Ane plane field their, with his Oist hes he taken.
Good Setoun syne, Ischit with few mean,
Part of his men into Dunbar left he.
To Wallace raid was on the richteous side,
In good array, to the Spot mure they ride.
Sum Scottis dred, the Erll sa money was,
Twenty thousand agane sa few to pas.
Bot Iop persauit, he bad Wallace should bide,
Tyne nocht our men, bot to sum strenth e ride.
And I sall pas to get ow power mair,
Their ar ouir good, thus lichtly for to wair.
Than Wallace said, in treuth I will nocht fle,
For four of his, ay ane quhill I may be.
We are ouir neir, sic purpois for to tak,
Ane dangerous chase they micht upon us make.
Heir is twenty, with this power to day,
Wald him assay, suppois I war away.
Money they ar, for Goddis saik be we strange,
one Sutheroun folk, in stour will not bide la^g.

How Corspatrik brocht in Scotland Bischop Beik and Robert the Bruce, and how
Wallace gaif them battle, and put them out of Scotland. Ca. ij.
THe bryme battle braithly on ather side,
Greit reird yair raise ouir all quhair yat yai ride.
The sair se^blie, quhe^ yai togidder met
Feill straikis their they sadly on other set.
Pruneand speiris throw plaitis peirsit fast,
Money of horse down to the ground they cast.
Sadillis they teym of horse but maisteris their,
Of the south side five thousand down they bair.
Good Wallace Oist the formest cu^merit sa,
Quhill yat the laif was in will away to ga.
Erll Patrik baid, sa cruel of Intent,
All haill his Oist tuik of him hardiment.
Aganis Wallace in money stour was he,
Wallace knew weill that his men wald nocht fle.
For na power that leuand was on life,
Quhill they in heill micht be ay ane for fyfe.
In that greit strife money was handillit hair,
The feill dyntis, the cruel hard debait.
The feirs stryking maid money ane grievous wou^d
Upon the eird the blude maid to abound.
All Wallace Oist into ane compass baid,
Quhair sa they turnit full greit slauchter yai maid
Wallace and Grahame, Ramsay full worthy,
The bald Setoun, and Richard of Lundy.
And Adam Wallace, als of Ricardtoun,
Both Hay and Lyle, with good men of Renoun.
Boyd, Barklay, Baird, and Lawder yat was wicht
Feill Inglismen, dersly to deith they dicht.
Bot Erll Patrik full feirsly faucht agane,
Throw his awin hand money he put to pane.
Our men on him thrang ford wart into thra.
Maid throw his Oist feill sloppis to and fra.
The Inglismen began planely to fle,
Than Bischop Beik full suddandly they se.
And Robert Bruce, contrair his native men,
Wallace was wa, fra time he couth him ken.
Of Brucis deidis he was aggreuit mair,
Than all the laif, that day that semblit their.
The greit buschment atanis brak on breid,
Ten thousand haill that douchtie war in deid.
The flearis than with Erll Patrik releuit,
They faucht agane quhair money war mischeuit.
Quhen Wallace saw, the buschment brokin was,
Out of the field, on horse they thocht to pas.
Bot he saw weill his Oist sound in their weid,
He thocht to fray the formest or he eid.
The new cu^min Oist about them semblit yair,
On ather side, with straikis sad and sair.
The worthy Scottis sa feirsly faucht agane,
Of Anthonis men money have they slane.
Bot that tyran sa vsit was in weir,
On Wallace Oist they did full mekill deir.
And the bald Bruce sa cruelly wrocht he,
Throw strenth of hand feill Scottis he gart de.
To resist Bruce, Wallace he preissit fast,
Bot Inglismen sa thick betuix them past:
And Erll Patrik in all the haist he mocht,
Throw out the stour to Wallace sone he socht.
On the Pesane ane felloun straik him gaif,
Keruit the plait, with his scharp groundit glaif.
Throw all the stuf, and woundit him sum deill,
Bot Wallace thocht he should be vengit weill.
Followit on him, and ane straik ettillit fast,
Bot ane Maitland reklesly betuix them past.
Upon ye heid good Wallace hes him taken,
Throw heid and braune in sunder straik the bane.
Deid to the ground at that straik he him draif,
Thus Wallace was disseuerit fra the laif.
Of his good men, amang them him allane,
About him socht feill enemeis money ane.
Stikkit his horse, to ground behuisit him licht,
To fend himself als wyselie as he micht.
The worthy Scottis, that micht na langer bide,
With sair hartis out of the field they ride.
With them in feir, they weind Wallace had been
On fuit he was, amang his enemeis kene.
Good room he maid about him into breid,
With his good sword that helpit him in neid.
Was nane sa strange, that gat of him ane straik,
After agane maid never ane Scot to wraik.
Erll Patrik than that had greit craft in weir,
With speiris ordanit, good Wallace down to beir.
Anew they tuik, was haill into the field,
To him they eid, thocht he should have na beild.
On ather side fast pruneand at his geir,
He hewit of heidis, and wyselie couth him weir.
The worthy Scottis of this full lytill wist,
Socht to good Grahame, quhe^ yai yair Chiftane mist.
Lawder and Lyle, and Hay yat was full wicht,
And bald Ramsay, quhilk was ane worthy knicht
Lundy and Boyd, and Cristall of Setoun,
With five hundredth that war in bargane boun.
Him to reskew full ruidly in they raid,
About Wallace ane large room they maid.
The Bischop Beik was braithly borne to eird,
At that reskew their was ane felloun reird.
Or he gat up, feill Sutheroun they slew,
Out of the preis, Wallace they can reskew.
Sone horsit him, upon ane Cuirser wicht,
Towart ane strenth, rydis in all their micht.
Richt wyselie fled, reskewand money man,
The Erll Patrik to stuf the chase began.
On the slearis, their lytill harm they wrocht,
Good Wallace folk away togidder socht.
Their five hundredth, ye quhilk I spak of air,
Sa awfully abandounit them and sair.
Na followar durst, out fra his fellow ga,
The good flearis sic turning in they ma.
Four thousand haill had taken the strenth befoir,
Of Wallace Oist, his comfort was the moir.
Of Glastaden that Forest thocht to hald,
Erll Patrik turnit, thocht he was never sa bald:
Agane to Beik, quhen chaipit was Wallace,
Curssand Fortoun of his mischancefull case.
The field he wan, and seuin thousand was loist,
Deid on that day for all the Bischoppis boist.
Of Wallace men, five hundredth slane I ges.
Bot na Chiftane, his murning was the les
Neir euin it was, bot Beik wald nocht abide,
In Laumyr mute they turnit in that tide.
Their ludgeingtuik, quhair he thocht may auaill
For weill he trowit, the Scottis wald assaill:
Upon the field quhair they gaif battle last,
The cuntrie men to Wallace gadderit fast.
Of Edinburgh with Craufurd that was wicht,
Four hundredth come into their armor bricht.
To Wallace raid, be his ludgeing was taken,
Of Teuidaill come good men money ane.
Out of Iedburgh with Rothuen at that tide,
Togidder socht, fra money diverse side.
Schir Williame yan, yat Lord was of Douglas
With him four scoir, that nicht come to Wallace.
Twenty hundredth of new men met that nicht,
Upon yair fais, to venge them at their micht.
At the first field their good men had nocht been,
Wallace wachis their aduersaris hes seen.
Into quhat wise they had their ludgeing maid,
Wallace bownit, after Supper but baid.
In Laumyr mute they passit haistely,
Sone to array eid this good Cheualry.
Wallace them maid in two partis to be,
Schir Iohne ye Grahame, and Setoun ordanit he,
Lawder and Hay, with three thousand to ride,
Him self the laif, tuik wyselie for to gyde.
With him Lundy, both Ramsay and Dowglace,
Barklay and Boyd, and good Adam Wallace.
Be this the day approchit wounder neir,
And bricht Titan, in presence can appeir.
The Scottis Oist sone semblit into sicht,
Of their enemeis they war nocht reddy dicht.
Out of array feill of the Sutheroun was,
Richt awfully Wallace can on them pas.
At this enter the Scottis sa weill them bair,
Feill of their fais to deith was brytinuit their.
Redles they raise, and money fled away,
Sum on the ground was smoirit quhair yai lay.
Greit noyis and cry was raisit them amang,
Good Grahame come in, yat stalwart was and stra^g
Fra Wallace men war weill togidder met,
On the South part sa awfully they set.
Incontrair them they frayit folk micht not stand
Atanis their fled, of Sutheroun ten thousand.
The worthy Scottis wrocht upon sic ane wise,
Iop said him self yat yai war mekill to pryse.
it Bischop Beik that felloun tyran strange,
Baid in the stour, richt awfully and lang.
Ane Knicht Skeltoun, that cruel was and kene,
Befoir him stuid, into his armor schene.
To fend his Lord, full worthily he wrocht,
Lundy him saw, and sadly to him socht.
With his good sword, ane akwart straik him gaif
Throw Pesane stuf, his craig in sunder draif.
Quhair of the laif war stoneist in that steid,
The bald Skeltoun of Lundyis hand was deid.
Than fled they all, and micht na langer bide,
Patrik and Beik away with Bruce can ride.
Five thousand held into ane slop away,
To Norhame house in all the haist they may.
Our men followit, that worthy war and wicht,
Money flear derfly to deith they dicht.
Their three Lordis to the Castle they socht,
Full feill they loissit, that was of Ingland brocht.
At this Journey twenty thousand they tynt,
Drownit and slane, with speir and swordis dynt.
The Scottis at Tweid, than haistit them sa fast
Feill Sutheroun men to wrang fuirdis they past.
Wallace returnit, in Norhame quhen yai wair,
For worthy Bruce his heart was wounder sair.
He had lever have had him at his large,
Fre till our Crown, than of fine gold to charge.
Mair yan in Troy was quhen ye Greikis it wan.
Wallace passit, with money awful man.
Ouir Patrikis land, and waistit wounder fast,
Tuik out greit gudis, and placis down can cast.
His steidis twelf that Met hamys was called,
Wallace gart brek they buirly biggingis balo.
Both in the Mers and als in Louthiane,
Except Dunbar standand he leuit nane.
To Edinburgh than upon the aucht day,
Upon the morn Wallace without delay:
To Perth he past, quhair ane Counsall was set,
To the Barrounis he schewit withouttin let.
How his greit vow richt weil eschewit was,
To ane master he gart Erll Patrik pas.
Because he said, of Scotland he held nocht,
To King Edward, to get supple he socht.
The Lords was blyith, and welcu^mit weill Wallace
Thankand greit God of his fair happy case.
Wallace tuik stait to Govern all Scotland,
The barnage haill maid him ane oppin band.
Than dealt he land to good men him about,
For Scotlandis richt had set yair lyfis in dout.
Stanetoun he gaif to Lawder in his wage,
The Knicht Wallange aucht it in heritage.
Than Birgem cruik he gaif Lyle yat was wicht
To Skrymgeour als, full good rewaird he dicht.
Syne Wallace town and other landis yair till,
To worthy men he dealt with Nobill will.
To his awin kyn, heritage nane gaif he,
Bot office haill that euerilk man micht se.
For couetise, their couth na man him blame,
He baid rewaird, quhill the King should cum hame.
Of all he did, he thocht to bide the Law,
Befoir his King, master quhen he him saw.
Scotland was blyith, in dolor had been lang,
In ilk ane part to good laubour they gang.
How Wallace past in Ingland, and remanit yair three quarteris of ane eir, and
come hame agane but battle. Ca. iij.
BE this the time of October was past,
November neir approchit wounder fast.
Tythingis their come, King Edward greuit was
With his power in Scotland thocht to pas.
For Erll Patrik had geuin him sic counsall,
Wallace gat wit, and semblit power haill.
Forty thousand on Roslyng mure their met,
Lordis he said, this is King Edwardis set.
In contrair richt to seik us in our land,
I hecht to God, and to ow be my hand.
I sall him meit for all his greit barnage,
Within Ingland to fend our heritage.
His false desire sall on him self be seen,
He sall us find incontrair of his ene.
Sen he with wrang hes riddin this Regioun,
We sall pas now incontrair of his Crown.
I will nocht bid greit Lordis with us fair,
For mine Intent I will planely declair.
Our purpois is, outher to win or de,
Quha eildis him sall never ransonit be.
The Barrounis than, him answerit worthily,
And said they wald pas with their Cheualry.
Him self and Iop prouydit that mean,
Twenty thousand of waillit men tuik he.
Harnes and horse, he gart amang them waill,
Wappinnis anew, that micht for them awaill.
Graithit their men, that cruel war and kene,
Better in weir, in world couth nocht be seen.
He bad the laif on laubour for to bide,
In good array fra Rossing mure they ride.
At yair muster good Wallace couth them as,
Quhat mysteris ma in ane power to pas?
All of ane will, as I trow set ar we,
In plane battle can nocht discomfeist be.
Our Realm is pure, waistit with Sutheroun blude
Go wyn on yame gold or other good.
The Oist Inclynit all with humbill will,
And said they should his bidding than fulfill.
The Erll Malcolme, with Ireland men is gane,
Bot name of reull on him he wald tak nane.
Wallace him knew, ane Lord yat was worthy,
At his counsall he wrocht full steidfastly.
Starker he was, gif they had battle seen,
For he befoir had in good Iournayis been.
Ane man of strenth, that hes good wit with all,
Ane haill Regioun may comfort at his call.
As manly Hector wrocht into his weir,
Aganis ane hundredth comptit was his speir.
Bot that was nocht throw his strenth anerly,
Sic reull he led of Nobill Cheualry.
Their exemplis war worthy for to ken,
Hector I leif, and speik forth of our men.
The Knicht Campbell maid him to that veyage,
Of Lochow chief, that was his heritage.
The good Ramsay forth to that Journey went,
Schir Iohne the Grahame, fordwart in his Intent.
Wallace Cousing, Adam full worthy was,
And Robert Boyd, forth blyithly can yai pas.
Both Auchinlek, and Richard of Lundy,
Lawder and Hay, and Setoun full worthy.
THis Royal Oist but resting forth they raid,
To Brokis field, and yair ane quhyle yai baid.
Tha^ Wallace tuik, with him forty but leis,
To Roxburgh et raid sone or he wald ceis.
Sutheroun meruellit, gif it should be Wallace,
Without assouerance, come to persew that place.
Of Schir Rauf Gray sone presence couth he as,
And warnit him thus, farther or he wald pas.
Our purpois is in Ingland for to ride,
Na time we haif of Seissing now to bide.
Tak tent and heir of our cu^ming agane,
Gif ouir this house, send me the keyis in plane.
Thus I command befoir their witness large,
Gif thou will nocht, remane with all the charge.
Bot this be done, throw force and I tak the,
Out ouir this wall, thou sall be hangit hie.
With that he turnit, and to his Oist can wend,
This ilk command, to Berwik sone he send.
With good Ramsay, yat was ane worthy Knicht,
The Oist but mair, full awfully he dicht
Began at Tweid, and spairit nocht they fand,
Bot brynt be force, all haill Northumberland.
All Durame town they brynt up in ane gleid,
Abbayis they spairit, and Kirkis quhair yat yai eid.
To ork they raid, but baid or they wald blyn,
To byrne and slay, of them he thocht na syn.
Na sin they thocht, the samin to let us feill,
Bot Williame Wallace quit our querrell weill.
Forthis they wan, and small Castellis kest down.
With asper wappinnis payit their ransoun.
Of presoneris they lykit nocht to keip,
Quhome yai ouir tuik, they maid their freindis to weip.
Na sutherou^sauit, for all yair greit riches,
All sic trustrie he callit bot wretchitnes.
Unto the ettis, and Subuerbis of the town,
Braithly yai brynt, and brak yair biggingis down.
At the wallis assaileit fyftene dayis,
Quhil King Edward scud to yame in this wayis.
Ane Knicht, ane Clerk, and ane Squyar of peis,
And prayit him fair of byrning for to ceis.
And hecht battle or fyftene dayis war past,
Souerance sa lang gif him lykit he ast.
And als he speirit, quhy Wallace tuik on hand
The felloun strife in defense of Scotland?
And said he meruellit, in his wit for thy,
Aganis Ingland, was of sa greit party.
Sen e have maid mekill of Scotland fre,
It war good time for to lat malice be.
Wallace hes hard the message say their will,
With manly voce richt thus he said them ^il.
e may know weill, that richt aneuch we haif,
Of his Souerance I keip nocht for to craif.
Because I am ane native Scottis man,
It is my det to do all that I can.
To fend our Kingrik out of dangering,
To his desire we will grant in sum thing.
Our Oist sall ceis, for chance that may betyde,
Their fyftene dayis, bargane for to abide.
And sall do nocht, les than it mufe in ow,
In his respite my self couth never trow:
King Edwardis writ, under his Seill yai gaif,
Be forty dayis that they should battelll hait.
Wallace than gaif, this credence to their King,
Their leif they tuik, syne passit but resting.
And tald him haill how Wallace leit them feill,
Of yair Souerance he keipit nocht adeill.
Sic reullit men, sa awful in effeir,
Ar nocht Cristinit, as he leidis in weir.
The King answerit, and said it should be kend,
It cu^mis of wit, enemeis to commend.
They ar to dreid, richt greitly in certane,
Sadly they think of harmis that they have taken.
Leif I them thus, at counsall with their King,
And of the Scottis agane to speik sum thing.
VAllace tranoyntit upon the secund day,
Fra ork yai past, richt in ane good array.
North west yai went, in battle buskit boun
Their ludgeing tuik beside Northallartoun.
And cryit his peax, their mercatis for to stand,
They forty dayis, for pepill of Ingland.
Quha that lykit, any vittall to sell,
Of all their schoir war mekill for to tell.
Schir Rauf Rymont Capitane of Miltoun was,
With greit power be nicht ordanit to pas
On Wallace Oist, to make sum Ieopardie,
Feill Scottis men, that dwelt in that country
Wist of this thing, and gadderit to Wallace,
They maid him wise of all this felloun case.
Good Lundy than, to him he callit their,
And Hew ye Hay of Lochorquhart was Air.
With three thousand, yat worthily had wrocht,
Syne privately on fra the Oist they socht.
The men he tuik, that come to him of new,
Gydis to be, for they the cuntrie knew.
The Oist he maid in good quiet to be,
Ane space fra them he buskit priuatlie.
Schir Rauf Rymo^t, with seuin thousand come in
On Wallace Oist, ane Ieopardie to begin.
The buschment brak, or they the Oist come neir,
On Sutheroun men, ye worthy Scottis ca^ s^eir.
Three thousand hail war braithly brocht to ground,
Journey they socht, and sickerly hes found.
Schir Rauf Rymont was stikkit on ane speir,
Three thousand slane that worthy war in weir.
The Sutheroun wist quhen their Chiftane was slane
To Miltoun fast yai fled in all their mane.
Wallace followit with his good Cheualry,
Amang Sutheroun they enterit suddanly.
Scottis and Inglis, into the town atanis,
Sutheroun men schot, and braithly kest down stanis
Of their awin men richt feill their have yai slane,
The Scottis about, that war of mekill mane.
Up Greissis ran, and seisit all the town,
Derfly to deith, the Sutheroun dang they down.
Wallace their hes fundin full greit riches,
Iowellis and gold, wappinnis, and harnes.
Spuleit the town of wine and of vittaill,
To his Oist send, with carriage of greit waill.
Three dayis still within the town he baid,
Syne brak down werk, that worthily was maid.
Wyfis and barnis they put out of the town,
Na man he sauit that was of that Natioun.
Quhen Scottis had taken, and tursit their desire,
Wallis they brak, and set the laif in fire.
The tymmer werk they brynt up all in plane,
On the feird day to his Oist raid agane.
Gart cast ane dyke, that micht sum strenthing be,
To keip the Oist fra suddand Ieopardie.
Than Inglismen was richt greitly aghast,
Fra North and South, unto their King yai past.
At Punfrayt lay, and held ane Parliament,
To gif battle the Lordis couth nocht consent.
Bot Wallace war, of Scotland crownit King,
Their counsall fand, it was ane perrillous thing.
For thocht they wan, they wan bot as they wair.
And gif they tynt, loist Ingland ever mair.
In case it war put in the Scottis hand,
And this decreit their wit amang them fand.
Gif Wallace wald upon him tak the Crown,
To gif battaill they should be reddy boun.
The samin message to him they send agane,
And their Intent they tald to him in plane.
Wallace them chargit, fra his presence absent,
His Counsall callit, and schew them his Intent.
He and his men desyrit battle to haif,
Be any wise, of Ingland ouir the laif.
Him self said first, that war ane ouir hie thing,
Aganis my faith, to reif my richteous King.
I am his man, borne native of Scotland,
To weir the Crown, I will nocht tak on hand.
To send the Realm, it is my det be skill,
Lat God abone reward me as he will.
Sum bad Wallace upon him tak the Crown,
Wise men said nay, it war derisicun.
To Crown him King but voce of Parliament,
For they wist nocht gif Scotland wald consent.
Other sone said, it was the wrangous place,
Thus demit they of money diverse case.
The Knicht Campbell of wit ane worthy man,
As I said air, with them was present than.
Hard and answerit, quhen money said their will,
This war the best wald Wallace grant their till.
To Crown him King Solempnitly for ane day,
To get ane end of all our lang delay.
The good Erll Malcolme, said yat Wallace micht
As for ane day, in fence of Scotlandis richt.
Thocht he refuissit it lestandly to beir,
Ressaue the Crown, as into feir of weir.
The pepill all, to him gaif their consent,
Malcolme of ald was Lord of Parliament.
it Wallace thoillit, and leit them say yair will
Quhen they had demit be money diverse skill:
In his awin mind he abhorrit with this thing,
The co^mounis cryit make Wallace crownit King.
Than semblit he, and said it should nocht be,
At termis schort, e get na mair of me.
Under color our answer we man make,
Bot sic ane thing I will nocht on me tak.
I will ow suffer, to say that it is swa,
It war ane scorn the Crown on me to ta.
They wald nocht lat, the message of Ingland
Cum them amang, or they should understand.
Two Knichtis past to the message agane,
Maid yame to trow wallace was crownt in plane
Gart yame traist weil, yat yis was suithfast thing
Deliuerit thus, they passit to the King.
To Punfret went, and tald that they had seen,
Wallace Crownit, quhairof yai Lordis war tene.
In barrat wox, in Parliament quhair they stude,
Than said they all, their tythingis ar nocht good.
He did sa weill in their times befoir,
And now their King, he will do mekill moir
Ane fortunate man, na thing gais him agane,
And we gif battle, we sall repent with pane.
Ane other said, and battle will he have,
Or stroy our land, na tresour may us save.
In his conquest, sen first he couth begin,
He sellis nocht, bot takis that he may wyn.
For Inglismen he settis na dome bot deid,
Price nor pennyis may make us na remeid.
Ane Wodstok sayis, e wirk nocht as the wise,
Gif that e tak the anter of suppryse.
For thocht we win all that are in Ingland,
The laif ar stark aganis us for to stand.
Be Wallace saif, other they count bot small,
For thy me think, it war the best of all.
To keip our strenthis of Castellis and wallit town,
Sa we sall fend the folk of this Regioun.
Thocht North be brynt, better of souerance to be,
Than set all Ingland on ane Ieopardie.
They grantit all as Wodstok can them say,
And thus they put the battle to delay.
And kest them haill for other governance,
Aganis Wallace to wirk sum ordinance.
Thus Wallace hes in plane discomfeist haill,
Aganis King Edward all his haill battall.
For throw falset and his subtilitie,
They thocht he should for greit necessity:
And falt of fude, to steill out of the land,
Than this decreit their wit amang them fand.
They gart the King cry all their market down,
Fra Trent to Tweid, throuchfair and fre town.
That in they boundis na man should vittall leid,
Sic stuf or wine, under the pane of deid.
This same decreit they gaif in Parliament,
Of Scottis forth to speik is mine Intent.
Wallace lay still, quhill forty dayis war gane,
Abydand them, bot apperance saw he nane.
Battle to have as their promeis was maid,
He gart display agane his baner braid.
Repreuit Edward, richt greitly of this thing,
Bauchillit his Seill, blew out on this false King.
As recryand, turnit bak and eid his gait,
Than Wallace maid full money biggingis hait.
They raissit fire, brynt up Northallartoun,
Agane throw ork schyre baldly maid yame bost.
Distroyit the land, als far as ever they ride,
Seuin mile about, they brynt on ather side.
And wrocht ye Sutherou^ money werka^d wound,
Palicis spilt, greit Towris can confound.
Wedowis weipit, with sorrow in their sang,
Madynnis murnit, with greit mening amang.
They spairit nocht, bot women and the Kirk,
The worthy Scottis of laubour wald nocht Irk.
Gaif to Abbayis richt largely of their good,
To all Kirk men they did na thing bot good.
The temporal land they spuileit at their will,
Good Gardingis gay, and greit Orchartis yai spil
To ork they went, their weirmen of Renoun,
Ane Seige they set richt sadly to the Town.
For greit defense they garneist them within,
Ane felloun salt without they can begin.
The Seige of ork. Ca. iiij.
DEuydit the Oist in four partis about,
With wachis fell, that na man should Isch out
Abone the town upon the south part side,
Their Wallace wald, and good Lundy abide.
Erll Malcolme syne at the west et abaid,
With him ye Boyd yat good Iourneyis had maid
The Knicht Campbell, of Lochow yat was Lord,
At the North et, and Ramsay maid them ford.
Schir John ye grahame yat worthy was in weir
Auchinlek, Craufurd, with full manly effeir.
At the eist port baldly they boun to bide,
Ane thousand archearis upon the Scottis side.
D^le^erit them amang the four party,
Five thousand bowmen in the town for thy.
Within the wallis arrayit them full richt,
Twelf thousand ma, that semelie was to sicht.
Than said Wallace, and one war on ane plane,
In field to fecht, me think we should be fane.
Than saileit they, richt fast on every side,
The worthy Scottis, that baldly durst abide.
With speir and scheild, for gunnis bad ya nane,
Within the dykis yai gart feill Sutheroun grane.
Arrowis they schot, richt feirs as any fire,
Out ouir the wallis, that flawmit in greit Ire.
Throw birneis bricht with heidis of fine steill,
The Sutheroun blude, of freindschip nane yai feil
Our schynand harnes schot the blude sa schene,
The Inglismen that cruel war and kene.
Keipit their town, and fendit them full fast,
Faggaldis of fire amang the Oist they cast.
With pik and tar of feill Sowis they lent,
Money war hurt or they fra the wallis went.
Stanis of Springhaldis they cast out sa fast,
And gaddis of Irne maid money grome aghast.
Bot nevertheless the Scottis yat war without,
The town full often, they set into greit dout.
Their Bulwerk brynt, richt brymly of the town,
Their Barmkin wan, and greit garrettis kest down.
Thus saileit they, on ilk side with greit micht,
The day was gane, and cu^min was the nicht.
The weary Oist, than drew them fra the town,
Set out wachis, for resting maid them boun.
Wisch woundis with wine, of yame yat was vnsou^d
For nane was deid, of greit mirth yai abou^d
Feill men war hurt, bot na murning they maid,
Confermit the Seige, and steidfastly they baid.
Quhen that the Sone on morrow raise up bricht,
Befoir the Chiftanis assemblit they full richt.
And said amendis of the town they should tak,
For all the fence yat the Suther^un micht make.
Arrayit agane, as they began befoir,
About the town they sail wounder soir.
With felloun schot out ouir the wallis full schene,
Feill Inglismen that cruel war and kene.
With schot war slane, for all their targis strange,
Bristit helmys, money to ground they dang.
Brym byrnand fire they kest to every et,
The entres thus in perrell often they set.
The defendaris war of full greit defense.
Keipit their town, throw strenth and violence.
All thus the day they draif unto the nicht,
To Pauillounis bownit money weary wicht.
All Irk of weir, the town was strange to win,
Of artaile and Nobill men within.
Quhen that yai trowit ye Scottis war all at rest,
For Ieopardy the Inglismen them kest.
Schir Iohne Mortoun, was knawin worthy and wicht
Schir william Leis graithit yame ye nicht
With five thousand, weill garnist and savage,
Upon the Scottis, they thocht to make skirmage.
And at the et Ischit out haistely,
On Erll Malcolme, and his good Cheualry.
To chak the wache Wallace and ten hes been,
Rydand about, and hes their cu^ming seen.
He gart ane blaw was in his cumpany,
The reddy men arrayit them haistely.
Feill of the Scottis Ilk nicht in harnes baid,
Be ordinance, for they sic reull had maid.
With schort auyse togidder ar they went,
Upon yair fais, quhair feil Sutherou^ war schent
Wallace knew weill, the Erll to haistie was,
For thy he sped him in the preis to pas.
Ane sword of weir into his hand he bair,
The first he hit, the craig in sunder schair.
Ane other akwart on the face tuik he,
Both neis and front, in the field gart he fle.
The hardy Erll befoir his men our past,
Into the preis, quhair feill war fechtand fast.
Ane scheirand sword, he bair drawin in hand,
The first was tey, that he befoir him fand.
Quhen Wallace and he was togidder set,
Their lest it nane agane them that they met.
Bot outher deid, or ellis fled them fray,
Be this the Oist all in ane good array:
With the greit scry, assemblit them about,
Than stuid the Sutheroun in ane felloun dout.
Wallace knew weill the Inglismen wald sle,
For thy he preissit in the thickest to be.
Hewand full fast on quhat Seigis he socht,
Aganis his dynt, fine steill auaillit nocht.
Wallace of hand, sen Arthur had na maik,
Quhome he richt hit, was ay deid at ane (...).
That was weill knawin in money places (...),
Quhome Wallace hit, yai detrit ye scottis na (...).
Als all his men, did cruelly and weill,

The Inglismen fled* and leit the field p^anely*
The worthy Scottis wrocht their sa hardely.
Schir Iohne Mortoun in yat place he was deed*
And twelf hundredth, but any mair remeid.
Their money was left in the field and slane,
The laif returnit in to the town agan^.
And rewit full sair, that ever yai forth couth found,
Amang yame was full money ane werka^d wound
The Oist agane ilk ane to their waird raid,
Commandit wache, and na mair noyis maid.
Bot restit still quhill that the bricht day dew,
Agane began, the town to sail new.
All thus they wrocht with full greit worthynes,
Assaileit sair, be wit and hardynes.
The Oistis vittall worth skant and faileit fast,
Thus lay they their, quhil diverse dayis war past.
The land waistit, and meit was nane to win,
Bot that wist nocht the folk that was within.
They dred full sair for their awin vernysoun,
For Souerance prayit the power of the town.
To speik with Wallace they desyrit fast,
And he appeirit, and speirit quhat they ast.
The Mair answerit, said we wald pay ransoun,
To pas our way, and deir na mair our town.
Greit schame it war that we should oldin be,
And tounis haldin of les power than we.
e may nocht wyn, us lang thocht yat e bide,
We sall gif gold, and e will fra us ride.
We may gif battle, durst we for our King,
Sen he hes left, it war ouir hie ane thing.
To us to do, without his ordinance,
This town of him we hald in governance.
Wallace answerit, of our gold rek we nocht,
It is for battle that we hidder socht.
We had lever have battle of Ingland,
Than all the gold that good King Arthur fand.
On Mont Michell, quhen he the Giant slew,
Gold may be gane, bot worschip is ay new.
The King promeist, that we should battle haif,
His writ thairto under his Seill they gaif.
Letter or band, e se may nocht auaill,
Us for this time he thocht to gif battall.
Me think we should on his men wrokin be,
Upon our kyn, money greit wrang wrocht he.
His devil like deid he wrocht into Scotland,
The Maif said Schir, richt thus we understand.
We have na charge quhat our King garris us do,
Bot in this kind we sall be bound ow to.
Sum part of gold to gif ow with good will,
And nocht after to wait ow with nane Ill.
Be na kin mean the power of this town,
Bot gif our King make him to battle boun.
Into the Oist, was money worthy man,
With Wallace ma, nor rekkin now I can.
Better it was, for at his will they wrocht,
Thocht he was best, it other lak we nocht.
All sernit thank, to Scotland ever mair,
For manheid wit, the quhilk they schewit their.
The haill counsall thus demit them amang,
The town to Seige, they thocht it was to lang.
And nocht ane way to win it with na slicht,
The counsall fand, it was the best they micht.
Sum gold to tak, sen that they get na mair,
Syne forth away into their veyage fair.
Than Wallace said, my self will nocht consent,
Bot gif this town make us this plane content:
Tak our baner, and set it on the wall,
For our power their Realm hes riddin all.
oldin to be, quhen we think them to tak,
In Ingland lang residence and we make.
This answer sone, they send unto the Mair,
And they consentit, the remanent that was their*
The baner tu^k up, and set it on the town,
To Scotland was, hie honor and Renoun.
Thai baner their, fra viij. houris unto none,
Their finance maid, deliuerit gold full sone.
Five thousand pundis, all good gold of Ingland
The Oist ressauit, with vittall aboundand.
Both breid and wine, richt glaidly forth yai gaif
And other stuf, that they lykit to haif.
Twenty dayis out, the Oist remanit their
Bot want of vittall gart them fra it fair.
it still in peax, the Oist ludgeit all yat nicht,
Quhill on the morn, the Sone was ryssin bricht.
In till Apryll amang the Schawis schene,
Quhen that the ground was cled in tender grene.
Plesand it war to any Creature,
In lusty life this time for to Endure.
The good women, had fredome largely,
Bot fude was skant, they micht get nane to by.
Tursit Tentis, and in the cuntrie raid,
On Inglismen full greit heirschip they maid.
^ry^t and brak down, biggingis spair they nocht
R^cht worthy Wallace, law to ground yame brocht
All Mydiame land they brint up in ane fire,
Brak Parkis down, distroyit all the Schyre.
Wyld Deit they slew, for other beistis was nane,
Thie weirmen tuik of vennysoun good wane.
Towart the south, they turnit at the last,
Maid biggingis bair, als far as ever they past.
The commounis all, to Londoun ar they went,
Be^oir the King, and tald him their Intent.
And said they wald, bot he gart Wallace ceis,
For^aik their faith, and tak them to his peis.
(...) Herald their, than durst to Wallace pas,
Quhairof the King greitly aggreuit was.
Thus Edward left his pepill into baill,
Contrair Wallace he wald nocht gif battall.
Nor bide in field, for nocht that they can say,
Gaif ouir the cause, to Londoun past his way.
At men of wit, this questioun heir I as,
Amang Nobillis gif ever any was.
Sa lang in Ingland throw force or throw case,
Sen Brutus deit, but vittall bot Wallace.
Greit Julius, the Empire had in hand,
Twyis on force was put out of Ingland.
Wicht Arthur als, first of weir quhen he preuit,
Als twyis yai faucht, suppois they war mischeuit.
Awful Edward durst nocht wicht Wallace bide
In ane plane battle, for all Ingland sa wide.
In Londoun lay, and tuik him to his rest,
And brak his vow* quhilk hald e for the best?
D^me as e list good men of discretioun,
Richt clair it is to resolve this questioun.
To my sentence now briefly will I pas,
Quhan Wallace yus throw ork schyre iourna^d was.
Vittall as than, was nane left in the land,
Bot in housis, quhait it micht be warrant.
The Oist heirof, abaissit was to bide,
Fra fude skantit, na plesance was that tide.
Sum bad turn hame, and sum wald farther may,
Wallace callit Iop, and said to him richt their.
Thou knawis the land, quhair may abounda^ce is
Be thou our gyde, and ya^ we sall nocht mis.
Vittall to find, that I wait wounder weill,
Thou hes I traist of Ingland mekill feill.
The King and his, to s^ar^ stren^ his ar gane,
Bot Ieopardie now perrell have we nane.
Than Iop said Schir, be e gydit be me,
The plentiest part of Ingland e sall se.
Of wine and quheit, their is in Rochmo^t Schyre
And other stuf of fude as e desire.
Quhair of I trow, e salbe weill content,
The Oist was glaid, and hidderwart they went.
Money true Scot was semblit in that land,
To Wallace come, weill ma than nine thousand.
Of presone part sum had in laubour wrocht,
Fra ather part full fast to him they socht.
Wallace was blyith of our awin native kin,
That come to him of baill that they war in.
And all the Oist of comfort was blyithar,
Fra their awin folk was multipliand mair.
In Rochemont Schyre they fand abundance,
Of breid and aill, with other purueyance.
Brak Parkis down, and slew beistis money ane,
Of wyld and tame, forsooth they spairit nane.
Throw out the land they past in good array,
Ane semely place sa fand they in their way.
Quhilk Ramiswauch hecht as Iop him self tald
Fehew was Lord, and Capitane in that hald.
Five hundredth men war semblit in that place,
To saif them self and their good fra Wallace.
Ane Royal steid fast by ane Forest side,
With Turatis fair, and garratis of greit pride.
Beildit about, richt lyklie to be wicht,
With five greit Towris weill biggit to the hicht.
Feill men about, on wallis buskit been,
In good armor, that burnist was full schene.
The Oist past by, and vesyit bot that place,
it they within on loud defyit Wallace.
And Trumpetis blew, with money weirlyke soun,
Than Wallace said, had we one gallandis down
On the plane ground, they wald mair sober be,
Than Iop said Schir, e gart his brother de.
In Herald weid, e wait on Tynto hill,
Wallace answerit, sa wald I with good will.
Had I him self, bot we may nocht him deir,
Good men man thoill, of harlottis scorn in weir.
Schir John ye grahame wald at ane bikker been
Bot Wallace sone the perrell hes foirsene.
Commandit him to lat his feirsnes be,
We have na men to waist in sic degree.
Wald we them harm, I know ane other gait,
How we with fire, within sall make them hait.
For fire hes been ay felloun into weir,
On sic ane place it may do lytill deir.
Their bulwark auld, I se of widderit aik,
War it in fire, they micht nocht stand ane straik.
Housis and wod, heir is aneuch plenty,
Quha hewis best of this Forest lat se.
Pull housis down, we sall nocht wane adeill,
The auld tymmer, will gar the grene byrn weill.
At his command full besely they wrocht,
Greit wod in haist about the place they brocht.
The Bulwerk wan, their men of arms bricht,
To the Barmkin, laid tymmer up on hicht.
Than bowmen schot, to keip them fra the cast,
Bot they about had festinit fyris fast.
Women and barnis, on Wallace loud they cry,
On kneis they fell, and askit him mercy.
At ane quarter quhair fire had nocht ouirtane,
They tuik them out fra that Castle of stane.
Syne bet the fire with brandis brym and bald,
The reid low raise full hie abone that hald
Barrellis of pik, sor fence was hungin their,
All straik in fire, their mischief was the mair.
Quhen the bryme fire atoui^ the place was past,
Than they within, micht nouther schuit nor cast.
Als bestiall of nolt and horse within.
Amang the fire they maid ane hiddeous din.
The armit men in harnes was sa hait,
Sum down to ground, duschit but mair debait.
Sum lay sum fell, into the felloun tire,
Smo^rit to deith, and brynt up bane and lyre.
The fire brak in at all oppinis about,
Nane baid on loft, sa felloun was the dout.
Fehew him self lap rudely fra the hicht,
Throw all the fire, can ouir the Barmkin licht*
Wi^h ane good sword, Wallace straik of his heid,
Iop hint it up, and turssit it fra that steid.
Five hundredth men, that was into that place,
Gat nane away, bot deit withouttin grace.
Wallace baid still, with his power that nicht,
Upon the morn the fire had faileit micht.
Befoir the et, quhair it was brynt on breid,
Ane rod they maid and to the Castle eid.
Straik down the et, and tuik that they micht win,
Iowellis and gold, greit riches was thairin.
Spuileit the place, and le^t nocht ellis their,
Bot beistis, brynt, bodyis and wallis bair.
Than tuik they her that was wife to Fehew,
Gaif her command, as scho was woman true.
To turs that heid to Londoun to King Edwart,
Scho it ressauit, with greit sorrow in heart.
Wallace him self, their chargis to her gai^,
Say to our King, bot git I battle ^ai^:
At Londoun ettis we fall assail sair,
In this month we think for to be their.
Traist in ye treuth will God we sall nocht faill,
Bot I desist throw charge of our counsall.
The south west part of Ingland we sall se,
Bot he seik peax, or ellis bergane with me.
Upon ane time he chargit me on this wise*
Richt busteously to make to him service.
Sic sall he have, as he us cause hes maid,
Than mouit they, withouttin mair abaid.
Deliuerit scho was fra this Cheualry,
Towart Londoun scho dicht her ernistly.
Unto the town but mair process scho went,
Quhair Edward lay sair mouit in his Intent.
His Neuoyis heid, quhen he saw it was brocht,
Sa greit sorrow sadly upon him socht.
With greit vneis, upon his feit he stude,
Weipand in woe, for his deir tender blude.
The Counsall raise, and prayit him to ceis,
We lois Ingland, bot gif we purches peis.
Than Wodstok said, this is my best counsall,
Tak piece ane time as for our a win auaill.
Or we tyne mair, we slaik of our curage,
After e may get help be our barnage.
The King grantit, and bad yame message send,
Na man was their, that durst to Wallace wend.
The Queen appeirit, and saw this greit distance,
Weill borne scho was of the richt blude of France
Scho trowit weill, yairfoir to speid the eirair,
Her self purpoissit in that Message to fair.
Als scho forthocht that the King tuik on hand,
Agane the richt, sa often to reif Scotland.
And ^eill men said, the vengeance hapnit sair,
Of greit murder, his men maid into Air.
Thus demit they the counsall them amang,
To this effect, the Queen bownit to gang.
Quhen scho hes seen ilk man forsaik this thing,
On kneis scho fell, and askit at the King.
Souerane scho said, gif it our willis be,
That I desire one Chiftane for to se.
For he is knawin, both hardy, wise, and true,
Perchance he wald erar on women rue.
Than on our men, they have done him sic dei^,
Quhen he them seis, it mui^is him ay to weir.
It may nocht skaith, suppois I do na vaill,
To help this land, I wald make my trauaill.
The Lordis all, of her desire was fane
Unto the King maid Instance into plane:
That scho micht pas^ the King with akwart will,
Half into Ire he gaif consent their till.
Sum of them said, the Queen luifit Wallace,
For the greit voce of his hie Nobilnes.
Ane hardy man, that is lyklie with all,
Greit favor will of Fortoun to him fall.
Anent women, is seen in money place,
Sa happinnit, in this time of Wallace.
In his rising, he was ane luifar true,
And cheissit ane, bot Inglismen her slew.
it said they nocht, the Queen wald on her tak,
As for his lufe sic travel for to make.
Now lufe or leif, or for help of their land,
I make reheirs, as I in Scripture land.
Scho graithit her, upon ane gudly wise,
With gold and geir, and folk at her deuyse.
Ladyis with her* nane other wald they send,
And auld Preistis, that weill the cuntrie kend.
Leif I the Queen to message reddy dicht,
And speik farther of Wallace travel richt.
THe worthy Scotts ama^g yair enemeis raid,
Distructioun greit, upon yame haif yai maid.
Waistit the land, about on ather side,
Na weirman than, durst in their wayis abide.
They Ransonit nane, bot to the deith them dicht
In money steid maid fyris braid and bricht.
The Oist was blyith, and in ane good estait,
Na power was, that wald make them debait.
Greit riches wan, of gold and good their till,
Leuing aneuch to tak at their awin will.
In awful feir they travel throw the land,
Maid biggingis bair, yat they befoir them fand.
Greit Barmkinnis brak, of steidis stark and strange,
Their wicht weirmen of travel thocht nocht lang.
South in the land richt ernistly they socht,
To Sanct Albanis, bot harm yair did yai nocht.
The Pryour send, i hame wine and vennysou^,
Refreschit the Oist with fude in greit fusioun.
The nicht appeirit, quhen they war at that place,
They herbi yet than, fra thine ane lytill space.
Cheissit ane s^eid, quhair they should bide all nicht,
Ten^s on ground and Pauilliou^is proudly picht.
Into ane vaill* beside ane River fair,
On ather side quhair wild beistis maid repair.
Set wachis out, that wyselie couth them keip,
To Supper went, and tymously couth sleip.
Of meit and drink, they ceis with sufficiance,
The nicht was schort, ouir draif* the dirkful chance.
How the Queen of Ingland come and spak with Wallace. Ca. v.
THe merry day sprang fra the Orient,
With bemis bricht, Illuminit ye Occident.
After Tytan Phoebus vprysit fair,
Heich in the Spheir the Signis maid declair.
Zephirus began his michtie morrow course,
The sweit vapor did fra the ground resours.
The donk dew down fra the heuin did vaill,
In every meid, both Firth, Forest, and daill.
The fresche Reuer amang the Rochis rang,
Throw grene branchis, quhair byrdis biythly sa^g.
With Joyous voce, in heuinly harmony,
Than Wallace thocht it was na time to ly.
He blissit him, syne suddandly up he raise,
To tak the air, out of his Tent he gais.
Master Iohne Blair was reddy haistelie,
To Goddis service bownit richt reverently.
Quhen that was done Wallace couth him array,
In his armor, quhilk was both good and gay.
His schynand scheild, yat burneist was full been,
His leg harnes, that claspit was full clean.
Pulanis greis, he claspit on full fast,
Ane clois birny, with money sicker cast.
Breist plait Braissaris, yat worthy war in weir,
Beside him forth, Iop couth his Basnet beir.
His glitterand gluiffis grauin on ather side.
He semit weill in battle for to bide.
Ane good girdill, and syne ane buirly brand,
Ane staf of steill he grippit in his hand.
The Oist him blissit, and prayit God of his grace,
Him to conuoy fra all mistemperit case
Adam Wallace, and Boyd forth with him eid,
Endlang ane River out throw ane flureist meid.
And as they walk atouir the feildis grene,
Out of the South, yai saw quhair yat ye Queen.
Towart the Oist come rydand soberly,
Fyftie Ladyis war in her cumpany.
Waillit of wit, and demit of Renoun,
Sum wedowis war, and sum of Religioun.
And seuin Preistis, that enterit war in age,
Wallace to sic did never greit outrage.
Bot gif to him yai maid ane greit offense,
Thus they approchit on towart their presence.
At the Pauilloun quhair they the Lyoun saw,
To ground they licht, and syne on kneis yai faw.
Prayand for piece, they cry with pieteous cheir,
Erll Malcolme said, our Chiftane is nocht heir.
He bad her rise, and said it is nocht richt,
Ane Queen on kneis, to any lawer wicht.
Up be the hand, the good Erll hes her taken,
Atouir the bent, to Wallace ar they gane.
Quhen scho him saw, scho wald have kneillit dou^
In arms sone he claucht yis Queen with Croun.
And Kissit her withouttin wordis moir,
Sa did he never to na Sutheroun befoir.
Madame he said, richt welcum mot e be,
How pleissit ow, our Oisting for to se?
Richt weill scho said, of freindschip we have neid,
God grant e wald, of our necessair to speid.
Suffer we mon, suppois it like us Ill,
Bot traistis weill it is contrair our will.
e sall remane with this Lord I man gang,
Fra our presence we sall nocht tarry lang.
The Erll and he, unto the Pauilloun eid,
With good auyse to deem mair of this deid,
The counsall sone, Wallace gart call them to,
Lordis he said, wait e quhat is ado.
Of their cu^ming my self hes na plesance,
And thairfoir man we wirk with ordinance.
Women may be contempning into weir,
Amang fuillis, that can nocht them forbeir.
I say nocht this, be their, nor be the Queen,
I trow it be bot good that scho will mean.
Exempill tak, of lang time passit by,
At Runsy vaill, the tressoun was planely.
Be women maid, yat Ganzelone with him brocht,
And Turkey wine, forbeir than couth they nocht.
Lang use in weir, gart them desire their will,
Quhilk brocht King Charlis to felloun lois and Ill.
The flour of France, without redemptioun,
Throw that foull deid, was brocht to confusioun.
Command our men, thairfoir in private wise,
On pane of life they wirk nocht on sic gyse.
Nane speik with yame bot wise men of greit vaill
That Lordis ar, and sworn to this counsall.
His charge they did, als gudly as they mocht,
This ordinance throw all the Oist was wrocht.
He and the Erll both to the Queen they went,
Ressauit her fair, and brocht her to ane Tent.
To Denner bownit, als gudly as they can,
And seruit was with money lyklie man.
Good purueyance the Queen had with her brocht.
Ane assay scho tuik of all that good her thocht.
Wallace persauit, and said we have na dreid,
I can nocht trow Ladyis will do that deid.
To poysoun men for all Ingland to win,
The Queen answerit, gif poysoun be thairin:
Of any thing quhilk is brocht heir with me,
Upon my self, first sorrow e sall se.
Sone after meit ane Marschell gart all absent,
Bot Lordis and they, that to the counsall went.
Ladyis appeirit in presence with the Queen,
Wallace askit quhat her cu^ming micht mean,
For piece scho said, that we have to ow socht,
This byrnand weir in baill hes money brocht.
e grant us piece for him that deit on tree,
Wallace answerit, Madame that may nocht be.
Ingland hes done sa greit harmis to us,
We may nocht pas, and lichtly leif it thus.
es said the Queen, for cristin folk we are,
For Goddis saik sen we desire na mair.
We aucht have piece, he said that we deny,
The perfect cause, that sall I schew for quhy.
e seik na piece bot for our awin auaill,
Quhen yat our King had Scotland grippit haill
For na kin thing that he befoir him fand,
He wald nocht thoill the richt blude in our land.
Bot reft their rent, syne put them self to deid,
Ransoun of gold micht make us na remeid.
His fell falls weir sall on him self be seen,
Than soberly to him answerit the Queen.
Of their wrangis amendis war may fair,
Madame he said, of him we ask na mair.
Bot that he wald bide us into battall,
And God be Judge, he kennis the matter haill.
Sic thing scho said, it war nocht good think me,
Piece now war best, and it micht purchest be.
Wald e grant piece, and trewis with us tak,
Throw all Ingland we should gar prayeris make:
For ow and yame, yat in the weir war loist,
Than Wallace said, quhair sic cu^mis throw boist:
Prayer of force, quhair sa that it be wrocht,
To us helpis, outher lytill or nocht.
Warly scho said, thus wise men hes us kend,
Ay after weir, piece is the final end.
Quhairfoir e should of our greit malice ceis,
The end of weir is cheritie and peis.
Piece is in heuin, with blis and lestandnes,
We sall beseik the Lord of his hie grace:
To command piece, sen we may do na mair,
Madame he said, or our prayer cum their:
Mendis of Ingland we think yan for to have,
Quhat set ow thus, on weir sa God ow save.
Fra violent weir, that e think nocht to dwell,
Madame he said, the treuth I sall ow tell.
After the dait of Alexanderis Ring,
Our land three eir stuid desolat but King.
Keipit full weill at concord in good stait,
Throw two yat clamit their hapnit greit debait.
Sa ernistfully accord them nocht they can,
our King they askit for to be their ouir man.
Slely he slaid in strenthis of Scotland,
The Kingrik syne he tuik at his awin hand.
He maid ane King aganis our richteous Law,
For he of him should have the Regioun aw.
Contrair this band, war all the haill barnage,
For Scotland it, was never in thirlage.
Greit Julius, that tribute tuik of all,
His wynning was, in Scotland bot richt small.
Than our falls King, under color but mair,
Throw band he maid, to Bruce that is our Air.
Undid that King quhilk he befoir had maid,
Throw all Scotland, with greit power yai raid.
To Bruce sen syne he keipit na cunnand,
He said he wald nocht gang and conqueis land:
To other men, and thus the case befell,
Than Scotland throw he demanit him sell.
Slew our Eldaris, greit piety was to se,
In presoun syne, lang time they presonit me.
Quhill I was than, cassin out for deid,
Thankit be God he send me sum remeid.
Vengit to be, I preuit all my micht,
Feill of that Kin, to deith syne have I dicht.
The rage of outh gart me desire ane wife,
That rewit I sair, and will do all my life.
Ane Tratour Knicht but mercy gart her de,
Ane Hessilrig, bot for despyte of me.
Than rang I forth in travel weir and pane,
Quhill we redemit part of our land agane.
Than our counsall desyrit of us ane true,
Quhilk maid Scotland full graithly for to rue.
Into that piece they set ane subtle Air,
Than xviij. scoir to deith they hangit their.
That Nobillis war, and worthy of Renoun,
Of coit armouris, eldest in that Regioun.
That deith wethink to venge in all our micht,
The woman als, that duilfully was dicht.
Out of my mind that deith will never slide,
Quhill God me tak fra this false world sa wide.
On Sutheroun sen, I can na piety haif,
our men in weir I never think to saif.
The bricht teiris was piety to behald,
Brist fra his ene quhen he his taill had tald.
The Queen weipit for piety of Wallace,
Allace scho said, wa worth the wickit case.
In waryit time that Hessilrig was borne,
Money worthy throw his deith ar forlorn.
He should have pane that saikles sic ane sleu^h,
Ingland sen syne hes bocht it deir aneuch
Thocht scho had been ane Queen or ane Princes,
Madame he said, als God gif me good grace:
Princes or Queen, of quhat stait sa they be,
Into her time scho was als deir to me.
Wallace scho said, of this talk we will ceis,
The mendis heirof is good prayer and peis.
I grant he said, of me as now na mair,
This is richt nocht bot eiking of our cair.
The Queen fand weill langage na thing her bet,
Scho trowit with gold; that he micht be ouirset.
Three thousand pund of fynest gold sa reid,
Scho gart be brocht to Wallace in that steid.
Madame he said, na sic tribute we craif,
Ane other mendis we wald of Ingland haif.
Or we return ^ra this Regioun agane,
Of our falls b^ude that hes our Eldaris slane.
For all the gold, and riches in our Ring,
e get na piece but desire of our King.
Quhen scho saw weill gold micht her nocht releif,
Sum part in sport scho thocht him for to preif.
Wallace scho said, e war clepit my lufe,
Mair abundantly I maid me for to prufe.
Traisting thairfoir our rancour for to slaik,
Me think e should do sum thing for my saik.
Richt wyselie he, maid answer to the Queen,
Madame he said, and verity war seen:
That e me luifit, I aucht ow lufe agane,
Their wordis all ar nathing bot in vane.
In speiche of lufe, subtle e Sutheroun ar,
e can us mok, suppois we get na mair.
To tak ane lyking, and syne get na plesance,
Sic lufe as that is nathing to auance.
In Londoun scho said, for ow I sufferit blame,
Our counsall als will lauch quhen I cum hame.
Sa may they say women ar feirs of thocht,
To seik freindschip, and syne can get richt nocht.
Madame we wait how e war hidder send,
e trow we have bot lytill for to spend.
First with our gold, for e ar rich I wis,

Syne plesand wordis of ow, and Ladyis fair,
As quha should dryfe the byrdis to ane snair.
With ane quhissill pype, for it will freschest call,
Madame as it, e may nocht tempt us all.
Greit part of good is left amang our kyn,
In Ingland als we find aneuch to win.
Abaissit scho was, to make answer him till,
Deir Schir scho said, sen that it is our will:
Weir or piece, quhat that ow lykis best,
Lat our hie wit, and good counsall degest.
Madame he said, now sall e understand,
The ressoun quhy that I will make na band.
With ow Ladyis, I can na trewis bynd,
For our falls King wald sone heirefter find:
Quhen he saw time to brek it at his will,
And planely say he grantit nocht their till.
Than had we nane bot Ladyis to reprufe,
That sall he nocht, be God that sittis abufe.
Upon women I will na weir begin,
On ow in field, na worschip is to win.
All the haill pais on him self he sall tak,
Of piece or weir, quhat we happin to make.
The Queen grantit his answer sufficient,
Sa did the laif, in plane that was present.
His deliverance they held of greit auaill,
And stark aneuch, to schaw to their counsall.
Wa was the Queen, her travel helpit nocht,
The gold scho tuik, that yai had with her brocht:
Into the Oist richt freely scho it gaif,
To every man that lykit for to haif.
Menstrallis, and Heraldis, scho gaif aboundantle
Beseikand them, her friend that they wald be.
Quhen Wallace saw the fredome of the Queen,
Sadly he said, the suith weill hes been seen.
Women may tempt the wysest hes been wrocht,
our greit gentrice, it sall not be for nocht.
We ow assure our Oist sall do na thing,
Quhill time e may send Message fra our King.
Gif it be swa, that he accord and we,
Than for our saik it sall the better be.
our Heraldis als, sall saifly cum and ga,
For our fredome, we sall trubill na ma.
Scho thankit him, of his grant money syse,
And all the Ladyis upon ane gudly wise.
Glaidly they drink, the Queen and good Wallace,
Her Ladyis als, and Lordis in that place.
Her leif scho tuik, for outtin langer baid,
Five mile that nicht south to ane Nonry raid.
Upon the morn to Londoun passit they,
In Westmynster, quhair that the counsall lay.
Wallace answer scho gart schaw to the King,
It neidis nocht heir, now mair reheirs this thing.
The greit commend that scho to Wallace gaif,
Befoir the King in presence of the laif.
To true Scottis, it should greitly appleis,
Thocht Inglismen thairof had lytill eis.
O^ worschip, wit, manheid and governance,
Of fredome, treuth, key of remembrance.
Scho callit him their, into their hie presence,
Thocht contrair them, he stude at his defense.
Sa Chiftane like, scho sayis as he is seen,
Into Ingland I trow hes never been.
Wald e of gold gif him this Realmis rent,
Fra honor he, will nocht turn his Intent.
Assouerit e ar, quhill e may message make,
Of wise Lordis sum part I reid ow tak.
To purches piece withouttin wordis mair,
For all Ingland may rue his raid full sair.
our Heraldis als, to pas to him hes leif,
In all his Oist their sall na man them grief.
Than thankit they the Queen for her travel,
The King and Lordis that war of his counsel.
Of her answer the King appleissit was,
Than three greit Lordis they ordanit to pas:
Their counsall haill hes fund it for the best,
Trewis to tak or ellis they get na rest.
Ane Herald went in all the haist he may.
To Auane vaill, quhair that the Scottis lay.
Conduct to have, till they had said their will,
The counsall sone ane Conduct send them till.
Agane he past with Souerance to his King,
Than cheissit they three Lordis for this thing.
The Kene Cliffurd, that than was Wardane haill
Bewmont, Wodstok, all men of mekill vaill.
Quhat their three wrocht, ye laif should stand yair till,
The Kingis self was geuin them at their will.
Sone they war brocht to speiking with Wallace,
Wodstok him schewit forth money subtle case.
Wallace hes hard their Sophysmis euerilk deill,
As it he said, me think we mean bot weill.
In wrang e hald, and dois us greit outrage,
Of housis part that is our heritage.
Out of this piece, in plane I make them knawin,
Them for to win, sen that they ar our awin.
Roxburgh, Berwik, yat ouris lang time hes been
Into the handis of our falls King I wene.
We ask heir als be vertew of this band,
Our awin ou^g King be wrang led fra Scotland.
We sall them have withouttin wordis mair,
To his desire the Lordis grantit their.
Richt at his will they have consentit haill,
For na kyn thing, the piece they wald nocht faill.
The oung Randall, that than in Londoun was,
The Lord of Lorne in this band he can as.
The Erll of Buchane, bot than in tender age,
After he grew ane man of greit vassalage.
Cumyng and Foullis he gart deliver als,
Quhilk after was, to King Robert full falls.
Wallange fled ouir, and durst nocht bide yat mute,
In Picardy to ask him was na bute.
Bot he wald erar have had that falls Knicht,
Than ane thousand of fynest gold sa bricht.
The Bruce he askit, bot he was had away,
Befoir that time, to Calice money ane day.
King Edward preuit yat yai micht nocht him get,
Of Gloucester his Uncle had him fet.
That Calice had, haill into his keiping.
Wallace that time gat nocht his richteous King.
The Erll Patrik als fra Londoun they send,
With Wallace to gang, as weill befoir is kend.
Of this matter ane final governance,
To King Edward he gaif up his legeance.
And tuik to hald of Scotland ever mair,
With full glaid hait Wallace ressauit him yair.
They honourit him richt reverently as Lord,
The Scottis was all reioysit of that concord.
Ane hundredth horse, with oung Lordis of Renou^,
To Wallace come, all fred of that presoun.
Under his Seill King Edward yan gart send,
For to gif ouir, and make ane final end
Roxburgh, Berwik, quhilk war of mekill vaill.
To Scottis men, and all the boundis haill.
For syne eir trewis they promeist be yair band
Than Wallace said, we will pas neir Scotland.
Or ocht be Seillit, and thairfoir make us boun,
Agane we will beside Northallartoun.
Quhair King Edward first battle hecht to me,
As we began their sall it endit be.
Greit weill the Queen he chargit the Message
It is for her that we leif our veyage.
Ane day he set, quhen they should meit him their,
And seill the piece withouttin process mair.
Upon the morn the Oist but mair auyse,
Tranoyutit north upon ane gudly wise.
To the set tryst that Wallace had them maid,
The Inglis message come but mair abaid.
They seillit the piece without langer delay,
The message than upon the Secund day:
To Londoun went in all the haist they can,
The worthy Scottis with money gudly man:
To Bamburgh come, with all their power haill,
Sextie thousand all Scottis of greit vaill.
Ten dayis befoir Alhallowis euin they fure,
On Lammes day they lichtit on Carhame mure.
Their ludgeit they, with plesance as they mocht,
Quhill on the morn that Preistis to yame brocht
In Carhame Kirk, and seissit in his hand,
Roxburgh keyis as they had maid cu^na^d:
And Berwik als, quhilk Inglismen had lang,
They fred the folk in Ingland for to gang.
For their lyfis Ischit of ather place,
They durst nocht weill bide rekning of Wallace.
Capitane he maid, in Berwik of Renoun,
That worthy was, good Cristall of Setoun.
Keiper he maid to Roxburgh Castle wicht,
Schir John Ramsay, ane wise and worthy Knicht.
Syne Wallace self with Erll Patrik in plane,
To Dunbar raid, and restorit him agane.
In his Castle, and als his heritage,
With the consent of all the haill barnage.
Quhen Wallace was aggreit and this Lord,
To reull the Realm he maid him gudly ford.
Scotland atouir fra Ros to Sulway sand,
He raid it thryis, and statute all the land.
In the Lennox, ane quhyle he maid repair,
Schir John Menteith ane quhyle was Capitane their.
Als twyis befoir he had his Gossop been,
Bot na freindschip betuix them syne was seen.
Two monethis still he dwelt in Dunbartane,
Ane house he foundit upon ane Roch of stane.
Men left he their to big it to the hicht,
Syne to the March, agane he rydis richt.
Into Roxburgh they cheissit him ane place,
Ane good Towr their, he gart big in schort space*
The Kingrik stude in good worschip and eis,
Was nane sa greit durst his nichtbour displeis.
The abill ground gart laubour thriftely,
Vittall and fruit their grew abundantly.
Was never befoir sen this was callit Scotland,
Sic wealth and piece atanis in the land.
He send Iop twyis to Bruce in Huntingtoun,
Beseikand him, to cum and tak his Crown.
Counsall he tuik at falls Saxonis allace,
He had never hap, in life to get Wallace.
Three eir as thus, the Realm stude in good peis
Of this saying me wourthis for to ceis.
And farther forth of Wallace will I tell,
Into his life quhat adventure it befell.
Heir endis the first Conqueis of Scotland.

Cap. j.
ANe Royal King that Regnit into France,
Greit worschip hard, of Wallace governance.
The proves, price, and of his worthy deid,
Als Furthwart fair, commendit of manheid.
Both humbill, true, and pruifit weill of price,
Of honor, treuth, and void of couetyce.
That Nobill King Regnand in Royalty,
Had greit delight this Wallace for to se.
And knew richt weill schortly to understand,
The greit suppryse, and ^uirset of Ingland.
He meruellit als, of Wallace small power,
That but ane King tuik sic a Realm to steir.
Aganis Ingland, and gart their malice ceis,
Quhill they desyrit with good will to tak peis.
And richt anon ane Herald gart he call,
In schort termis he hes reheirsit all.
Of his Intent compleitly to ane end,
Syue in Scotland, he bad him he should wend.
And he wrait richt with verray greit honor,
To William Wallace as ane Conqueror.
O Louit leid, with worschip wise and wicht,
Thou verray help, in halding of thy richt.
Thou richt reskewar of thy native land,
With Goddis grace aganis thy fais to stand.
In defense helpar, of thy richteous blude,
O worthy birth, and blissit be thy fude.
As it is red of Prophecy beforne,
In happy time for Scotland thou was borne.

As our brother I cristynit King of France,
To the beirar, e heir and gif credance.
The Herald him bownit, and to ye Schip is gane
In Scotland sone, he cu^mis into ane.
Bot Herald like he seikis his presence,
On land he went, and maid na residence.
In every steid quhair he presumit their,
Sa on ane day, he fand him into Air.
In good effeir, and manlyke cumpany,
The Herald than with honor reverently.
Hes salust him, upon ane gudely maneir,
And he agane with humbill hamely cheir:
Ressauit him, into richt gudly wise,
The Herald than, with worschip to deuyse:
Be tuik to him the Kingis write of France,
Wallace on kne, with lawly obeisance.
Richt reverently for worschip of Scotland,
Quhen he it red, and had it understand:
At this Herald he askit his credance,
With asper speiche, and manly countenance.
And he him tald, as I haif said befoir,
The Kingis desire, quhat neidis wordis moir*
The hie honor, and the greit Nobilnes,
Of our manheid weill knawin in money place.
Him lykis asweill our worschip to auance,
As e war borne ane liege man of France.
Sen his Regioun is flour of Realmis seen,
Als the greit band of kyndnes ow between.
And sen this Realm standis in sic saiftie,
It war worschip his presence for to se.
Wallace consauit, withouttin tarying,
The greit desire of this good Nobill King.
Syne to him said, sa God of heuin me save,
Heirefter sone, e sall ane answer have.
Of our desire that e have schewit me till,
Welcum e ar with ane fre hearty will.
The Herald baid unto the twenty day,
With Wallace still, in good weilfair and play.
Consumit the time with wirschip and plesance,
Be good auyse maid his deliverance.
With his awin hand he wrait unto the King,
All his Intent as tuiching to this thing.
Richt rich rewaird he gaif the Herald to,
And him conuoyit, quhen he had leif to go.
Out of the town with gudly cumpany,
His leif he tuik, and went unto the sey.
Good Wallace than hes maid his purueyance,
His purpois was to se the King of France.
Neirest but weir to Sanct Iohnstoun couth fair
Ane counsall than he had gart ordane their.

To keip the land, ane man of greit honor.

Quhilk Father was as storyis beiris on hand.
To good Walter quhilk was of hie parage,
Mariory Bruce syne gat in Marriage.
Thairof as now, to speik I have na space,
It is weill knawin, thankit be Goddis grace*
And to the Herald withouttin residence,
How he appeirit unto the Kingis presence.
Fra the Rochell the land sone hes he taken,
A touir the land he graithit him to gane.
Seikand the King als gudly as he may,
Sa to the Court he passit on ane day.
To Paris went, as peirles of Renoun,
This King that time held Palice in that town.
Quhen he him saw, hes graithly understand,
He speirit tythandis, the weilfair of Scotland.
The Herald said, into their termis schort,
That all was good, he had the mair comfort.
Saw thou Wallace the Chiftane of that land,
And he said e, that dar I tak on hand.
Ane worthyar, this day is leuand nane,
In way of weir, als far as I have gane.
The hie worschip, and the greit Nobilnes,
The good weilfair, plesance and worthynes.
The rich rewaird, was michtie for to se,
That for our saik he kyithit upon me.
And his answer in writ he hes ow sent,
The King ressauit, it with ane good Intent.
O Royal Roy, and richteous Crownit King.

How yat our Realm, standis in perplexite.

Quhen pleissis them they make us ay ado.
Na band may be maid of sic sufficiance,
Bot ay in it they find ane variance.
To wait ane time will God that I may be,
Within ane eir I will our presence se.
Of this answer weill pleisit was the King.
Leif I them thus in Royalty to Ring.
And glaid comfort richt as I have ow tald,
Of Wallace forth I will my purpois hald.

The Kalend changit as we use to say.
The lusty time of Mayis fresche cu^ming,
Celestial greit blyithnes in to bring.
Principal month, forsooth it may be seen,
The heuinly hewis upon the tender grene.
Quhen auld Saturn his cluddy course hes gane,
The quhilk hes been both bird and beistis bane.

Hie comfort hes be wirking of natour.
All fructeous thing into the eird adoun,
That reullit is under the hie Regioun.
Sober Luna in following of the se,
Quhen bricht Phoebus is in his Chemeis hie:
The Bullis course sa takin hes his place,
And Iuppiter was in the Crabbis face.
Quhen Aries the hait Sign Colerik,
Into the Ram quhilk hes his roumis rike.

Gentill Iuppiter with his myld ordinance,
Both herb and tree reuertis into plesance.
And fresche Flora her floury mantill spreid,
In every vaill both hoip hill and meid.
In this same time, for thus mine Author sayis,
Wallace to pas of Scotland tuik his wayis.
Be schort anyse he schuip him to the sey,
And fyftie men tuik in his cumpany.
He leit na word than walk of his passage,
Or Inglismen had stoppit his veyage.
Nor tuik na leif at Lordis of Parliament,
He wist full weill they wald nocht all consent.
To suffer him out of the land to ga,
For thy anon without witting of ma:
He gart foirse and ordane weill his schip,
And their war they past in his fellowschip.
Two Wallacis was his kynnismen full neir,
Craufurd, Cleland, to him war haldin deir.
At Kirkeudbricht he ordanit his passage,
Seymen he set, and gaif them gudly wage.
Ane good new Barge, richt worthily wrocht for weir
They wa^tit nocht, of wine, vittal nor geir.
Wit e they war ane gudly cumpany,
Of waillit men, had wrocht full hardely.
Boneallies drank richt glaidly on ane morrow
Syne leif they tuik, and with greit God to borrow*
Boittis war schot, and fra the land them sent,
With glaid hartis atanis in they went.
Unto the Schip they rowit haistely,
The Seymen than wirkand full ernestly.
Ankeris wand in, wyselie on ather side,
Their leidis kest, and waittit weill the tide.
Leit Saillis fall, and hes their course anon,
Ane gudly wynd out of the richt airth come.
Freikis on foirstam reullit weill their geir,
Leidis on lebuird, with ane Lordly feir.
Lynis laid out to luik their passage sound,
With full Saill yus, fra Scotland Firth yai found.
Saillit haill ouir, the day and als the nicht,
Upon ye morn quhen yat ye Sone schynit bricht
Their Schipmaister unto the Top is went,

Sextene Saillis arrayit on ane raw,
In color reid, that towart yame couth draw.
The glitterand Sone upon them schewit bricht,
The sey about Illuminit with the licht.
This ma^nis Sprite was in ane ecstasy,
Down went he sone, and said richt sorrowfully.
Allace (quod he) the day that I was borne,
Without remeid our lyfis ar all forlorn.
In curssit time I tuik this cure on hand,
The best Chiftane, and reskew of Scotland:
Ouir reklesly I have taken upon me,
With waik power to bring him throw the sea.
It forcit nocht, wald God I war torment,
Sa Wallace micht, with worschip chaip vnsche^t.
Quhen Wallace saw, and hard this ma^nis mane,
To comfort him, with good will is he gane.

Nocht for my self, this man said pieteouslie.
Bot of ane thing I dar weill vndertane,
Thocht all war heir the Schippis in Bertane.

The best weirman in sey is us beforne.
Leifand this day, and King is of the sea,

The Reid Reuar they call him in his style,
That I him saw, O waryit be the quhyle.
For mine awin life I wald na murning make,
Is na man borne, that one Tyran will tak.
He saifis nane, for gold nor other good,
Bot slayis and drownis all derfly in the flude.
He gettis na grace, thocht he war King or Knicht
This sextene e ir he hes done greit vnricht.
The power is sa strange he hes to steir,
May nane eschaip, yat cu^mis in his dangeir.
Wald e him buird, na buit is to begin,
The lakest schip that is his floit within.
May saill us down unto the dulefull deid,
Than Wallace said, sen thou can na remeid:
Tell me his feir, and how I sall him know,
Quhat is his use, and syne go luge the law?
The schip men said, full weill e may him ken,
Be graith takynnis full cleirly be his men.
His co^t armor is seen in money steid,
All battle bown in raiment all of reid.
This formest schip that persewis us sa fast,
Him self is in, and will nocht be aghast.
He will ow haill quhen yat they cum ow neir,
Without tarry than man e stryke and steir.
Him self will enter first full hardely,

Ane bar of Blew into his schynand scheild,
Ane bend of Quhyte desyrand ay the field.
The Reid betakynis blude and hardyment,
The Quhyte curage, Incressand his Intent.
The Blew he beiris, for he is cristin man,
Sadly him answerit, William Wallace than.
Thocht he is cristin, this is na cristin deid,
Ga under loft, ye Lord God mot us speid.
Both Schipmaister, and Steirisman also,
Into the how, but baid he gart them go.
His fyfcie men withouttin langer rest,
Wallace gart ray, into their armor pressed.
Aucht and forty on lufe buird laid they law,
William Craufurd than to him can he caw.
And said thou can sum part of Schipman fair,
Thou hes been vsit into the town of Air.
I pray the tak this doctrine weill of me,
Luik that thou stand still straightly be the tree.
Quhen they bid stryke, to service be thou bane,
Quhen I the warn, lat down the Saill agane.
Cleland Cousing cum tak the steir on hand,
Heir on the waill neir by the sall I stand.
God gyde our Schip, as now I say na mair,
The Barge began with ane full weirlyke fair.
Him self on loft, was with ane drawin sword,
And bad yair Steirisman lay endlang the buird.
On loud he cryit, stryke doggis or e sall de,
Craufurd leit draw the Saill a lytill we.
The Capitane lap in, full sone and wald not slynt,
Wallace hes him sone be the gorget hynt.
On the ouir loft, kest him quhair yat he stude,
Quhill neis and mouth all ruschit turth of blude.
Ane forgit knyfe, braithly he braidit out,
The weir schippis was lappit them about.
The Barge clippit, bot they nocht festnit fast,
Craufurd drew Saill, schot by and of them past.
The Reuar cryit with pieteous voce full cleir,
Grace of his life, for him yat bocht us deir.
Mercy he cryit, for him that deit on Rude,
Laser to mend, I have spilt mekill blude.
For my trespass I wald make sum remeid,
Money saikles I have gart put to deid.
Wallace wist weill, thocht he to deith war brocht
Fra them to chaip, on na wise micht he nocht.
And of his life sum reskew micht he make,
Ane better purpois, syne sone than can he tak.
And als he rewit, for his life had been Ill,
In Latin tongue richt thus he said him till.
I never tuik man that enemy was to me,
For Goddis saik thy life it grant I the.
Both knyfe and sword, he tuik fra him anon,
Up be the hand, as presoner hes him taken.
Upon his sword, scharply he gart him sweir,
Fra that day forth he should him never deir.
Command thy men, said Wallace to our peis,
Their schot of gun, that was nocht eith to ceis.
They castand war, awful on ather side,
The Reid Reuar commandit them to bide.
Held up ane gluif in taikning of the true,
His men beheld and weill that Seen knew.
Left of their schot, the Sign quhen yat yai saw,
His greitest barge towart him can he caw.
Lat ^e our weir, their ar freindis at ane,
I trow to God our werst houris ar gane.
He askit Wallace to do quhat was his will,
With schort auyse, richt thus he said him till.
To the Rochell I wald e gart them Saill,
For Inglismen we wait nocht quhat may aill.
He them commandit for outtin wordis mair,
Turn Saill and wynd, towart the Rochell fair.
For their will God is our purpois to be,
Luik weill about, for S^urriouris on the se.
His charge they wrocht in all the haist they can,
Wallace desyrit to talk mair with this man.
Wyselie he speirit, in quhat land art thou borne?
In France he said, and all my Elderis beforne.
And their we had sum part of heritage,
Thocht feirs Fortoun, yus brocht me in ane rage.
Wallace answerit, how come thou to this life?
Forsooth he said, bot throw ane suddand strife.
Sa happinit I, into the Kingis presence,
Ouir recklesly to do ane greit offense.
Ane worthy man of good kyn and Renoun,
That throw my deid was put to confusioun.
Deid of ane straik, quhat neidis wordis mair,
All mendis it nocht, thocht I repent it sair.
Throw friend in Court, I chaipit of that place,
And never sen syne couth get the Kingis grace.
Feill of our kyn they gart for my saik de,
Fra time I saw it micht na better be.
Bot leif the land, that me behuifit on neid,
Upon ane day to Burdeous I eid.
Ane Inglis Schip sa gat we on ane niche,
For sey laubour, full ernestly us dicht.
To me assemblit, mysdoaris other ma,
Within schort space we multiplyit sa.
Was few that micht contrair our power gang,
In tyranny thus have we rungin lang.
Their sextene eiris, I have been on the se,
And done greit harm, thairfoir full wa is me.
I saifit quhene for gold or greit Ransoun,
Bot slew and drownit into the sey all down.
Favor I did, to folk of sindrie land,
Bot French men na freindschip in me fand.
They gat na grace, als far as I micht Ring,
Als on the sey I cleipit was ane King.
Now se I weill, that my Fortoun is went,
Vin^ust with ane, that garris me sair repent.
Quha wald have said, this samin day at morn,
I should with ane, thus lichtly down be borne.
In greit heithing my men wald it have taken,
My self thocht als, to have matchit any ane.
Bot I have fund the verray plane contrair,
Heir I gif ouir rubrie for ever mair.
In s^^ mysreull I sall never arms beir,
Bot gif it be in honest use of weir.
Now have I tald part of my blis and pane,
For Goddis saik sum kyndnes kyith agane.
My heart will brek, bot I wit quhat e be,
Outrageously that hes rebutit me.
For weill I weind, that leuand had been nane,
Be force or strenth, micht me as presoner taken.
Except Wallace that hes redemit Scotland,
The best is callit, this day leuand of hand.
Into his weir war worschip for to waik,
As now in world I trow he hes na maik.
Wallace smylit, and said friend it may weill be,
Scotland had neid of money sic as the.
Quhat is thy name, tell me sa have thou Seill,
Forsooth he said, Thomas of Longueill.
Weill bruik thou it, all thus styntis our strife,
Schaip to pleis God in mending of thy life.
Thy faithful friend my self thinkis to be,
And als my name I sall sone tell to the.
For chance of weir thou should na murning make,
As weird will wirk, thy fortoun man thou tak.
I am that man, that thou auancis sa hie,
And bot schort time se^ I come to the se.
Or Scotland borne my rycht name is Wallace,
On kneis fell, and thankit God of his grace.
I dar avow, that oldin is my hand,
To the best man, this day that is leuand.
Forsooth he said, this plesis me mekill moir,
Than of Floringis e gaif me sextie scoir.
Tha^ wallace said, you art heir now throw chance,
My purpois is to pas now into France.
Unto the King, sen I am bown to pas,
To my rewaird, thy piece I think to as.
Piece I wald have, fane of my native King,
And na langer into the Realm to Ring.
Than thou tak leif to cum far it agane,
Into thy service I think for to remane.
Service he said, Thomas that may nocht be,
Bot good freindschip, as I sall keip to the.
Gart draw the wine, and Ilk ane merry maid,
The Schippis be than was in the Rochell raid.
THe Reid Blasou^is, as yai had borne in weir
The town was sone into ane suddand feir.
The Reid Reuar they said was at yair had,
The quhilk throw strenth, micht nane aganis him stand.
Sum schippis fled, and sum ye land hes taken
Clariounis blew, and Trumpetis money ane.
Quhen Wallace saw the pepill was on steir,
He gaif command na Schip should neirar peir.
Bot his awin Barge, in the hauin gart draw,
The folk was glaid, quhen they the baner saw.
Full weill they knew, in gold the reid Lyoun,
Leit up the port ressauit them in the town.
They souerit him, for all he had their brocht,
The Reid Navy into the hauin they socht.
On land syne went, quhair yat yame lykit to pas,
Richt few wist their, quhat Scottisman Wallace was.
Bot weil yai thocht he was ane gudly man,
And honourit him with all the craft they can.
They four dayis still, Wallace remanit their,
Their men he callit, quhen he was boun to fair.
He them commandit upon that coist to bide,
Quhill he them fred, for chance yat micht betyde.
Beir ow euinly, quhat good that ever e spend,
Leif of our awin, quhill I ow tythingis send.
Gar sell their Schippis, and make ow men of peis
It war good time of wickitnes to ceis.
our Capitane sall pas to the King with me,
Throw help of God, I sall his warrant be.
He gart graith him, in suit with his a win man*
Was na man their, yat micht weill Thomas ken.
Lyklie he was, manly of countenance,
Lyk^ to the Scottis be mekill governance.
Saif of his tongue, for Scottis had he nane,
In latin weill he micht have sufficit for ane.
Thus past they on, in all the haist they may,
To Paris town they went upon ane day.
Tythingis war brocht of Wallace to the King,
Sa greit desire he had of na kin thing.
As in that time quhill he had seen Wallace,
To meit him self he waittit upon case.
In ane garding quhair he gart them be brocht,
To his presence with manlyke feir they socht.
Two and fyftie atanis kneland down,
And salust him, as Roy of may Renoun.
With reullit speiche in sa gudly auyse,
All France couth nocht mair nurtour yame deuyse
The Queen had leif, and come in her effeir,
For mekill scho hard of Wallace deid in weir.
Quhat neidis mair of courtesy to tell,
They keipit weill, that to the Scottis befell.
Of Kingis fair, I dar make na reheirs,
My febill mind, my trubillit Sprite transuers.
Of the rich service, quhat neidis wordis mair,
Micht nane be fund, bot I was preseut their.
Sone after meit, the King to Perlour went,
With gudly Lordis, their Wallace was present.
Than commonit they of money sindrie thing,
To speik with him, greit desire had the King.
At him he speirit, of weir the governance,
He answerit him with manly countenance.
To every point, als far as he had feill,
In Latin tongue, richt naturally and weill.
The King consauit sone be his hie knawlage,
Quhat weirmen vsit be reif in their passage.
Into quhat mind the Reid Reuar than was,
Meruell he said, how he leit Wallace pas.
To him he said, e ar sum thing to blame,
e micht have send with our Herald fra hame.
After power, to bring ow throw the se,
God thank ow Schir, thairof aneuch had we.
Few men may pas, quhair they find na perrall,
Richt quhene may keip, quhair nane is to assaill.
Wallace he said, thairof meruell haif I,
Ane Tyran Regnis in Ire full cruelly.
Upon the sey, that greit sorrow hes wrocht,
Micht we him get, it should not be for nocht.
Borne of this land, ane native man to me,
Thairfoir on us, the greitest harm dois he.
Than Thomas quoik, and changit countenance
He hard the King his evil deidis disauance.
Wallace beheld, and feneit in ane part,
Forsooth he said, we fand nane in that art.
That profferit us any sic unkindness,
Be our leif Schir, I speik in hamelynes.
Trow e be sicht, e couth that Squyar know,
To lang it war, sen time that I him saw.
Bot their wordis, of him ar bot in vane,
Or he cum heir, richt good men will be slane.
Than Wallace said heir have I brocht with me,
Of lyklie men that dwelt in our cuntrie.
Quhilk of all their wald e call him may like,
Amang them blent, this Royal Roy may ryke,
Vesyit them weill, both stature and curage,
Manner, makdome, their fassioun and vesage.
Sadly he said, auysit soberly
That largest man ye quhilk standis neist ow by.
Wald I call him, be makdome to devise,
Their ar na thing bot wordis of office.
Befoir the King on kne fell good Wallace,
O Royal Roy, of hie honor and grace.
With waist wordis I will ow nocht trauall,
Now I will speik sum thingis for mine auaill.
Our barrane land hes been ouirset with weir,
Be Saxonis seid, that dois us mekill deir.
Slane our Eldaris, distroyit our richteous blude
Waistit the land, of gold and other good.
And e ar heir in micht and Royalty,
Eye e should have to our adversity.
And us support for kyndnes of the band.
Quhilk is confermit betuix ow and Scotland.
Als I am heir, for our charge at plesance,
My lyflait is bot honest cheuisance.
Flour of Realms forsooth is this Regioun,
To my rewaird I wald have greit guardoun.
Wallace he said, now ask quhat e wald haif,
Good gold or land sall nocht be lang to craif.
Wallace answerit, swa e grant it to me,
Quhat I wald have, it sall sone chosin be.
Quhat ever e ask that is in this Regioun,
e sall it have, except my wife and Crown.
He thankit him of his greit Kinglynes,
All my rewaird salbe asking of grace
Piece to this man, I brocht with me throw chance
Heir I quyt clame all other gift in France.
This same is he, gif that e know him weill,
That we of spak, Thomas of Longoueill.
Be rigor e, desyrit he should be slane,
I him restoir unto our grace agane.
Ressaif him fair, as liege man of our land,
The King meruellit, and couth in study stand.
Perfytlie knew, that it was Longoueill,
He him forgaif, his trespass every deill.
Bot for his saik that had him hidder brocht,
For gold nor good, ellis he did it nocht.
Wallace he said, I had lever of good land,
Three thousand pund have seissit in thy hand.
That I have said, sall haldin be in plane,
Heir I ressaif Thomas to piece agane.
Deirar to me, than ever he was befoir,
All for our saik, thocht it war mekill moir.
Bot I wald wit how this meruell befell,
Wallace answerit, the treuth I sall ow tell.
Than he reheirsit, quhat hapnit on that day,
As e befoir mine Author hes hard say.
Quhen the good King had hard the suddand case,
Upon the sey be for sicht of Wallace.
The King him held richt wourthy to auance,
He saw in him manheid and Governance.
Sa did the Queen and all their other Lordis,
Ilk wicht of him greit honor than recordis.
He purchest piece for all the power haill,
Fourtene hundredth was left at the Rochell.
Gart cry them fre, true seruandis to the King,
And never agane, for ^alt into sic thing.
Quhen Thomas was restorit to his richt,
Of his awin hand the King had maid him Knicht
After he gaif stait to his neirest Air,
And maid him self with Wallace for to fair.
Thus he hes brocht, they men fra reif throw case,
Be suddand chance of him and wicht Wallace.
Thus leif we them in worschip and plesance,
At lyking still with the good King of France.
How Wallace past in Guyan. Cap. iii.
They twenty dayis he ludgit into rest,
Sa to remane he thocht it nocht the best.
Still into piece, he couth nocht lang endure,
For quhy contrarious it was to his nature.
Richt weill he wist Inglismen occupyit
Guyan that time, thairfoir he hes espyit.
Sum Ieopardie upon them for to make,
Ane gudly leif he at the King couth tak.
Of French men he wald nane with him call,
At that first time for adventure that micht fall.
Bot Schir Thomas that service couth persew,
He wist nocht weill gif all the laif was true.
Of Scottismen than semblit haistely
Nine hundredth sone of worthy Cheualry.
In Guyan land full haistely can ride,
Raissit feill fire, and waistit wynningis wide.
Forthis they brak, and stalwart biggingis wan,
Der^^y to deith, brocht money Sutheroun man.
Ane weirlyke town sa fand they in that land,
Quhilk Scheme^t hecht, yat Inglisme^ had in hand.
Towart that steid, full sadly Wallace socht,
Be any way, assail gif he mocht.
Bergane to have, and he micht get them out,
Greit strenth of wod, yair was yat town about.
The town stude als upon ane watter side,
Into ane Park, that was both lang and wide.
They buskit them, quhill passit was the nicht,
Quhen the Sone raise, four hundredth me^ he dicht.
The laif he gart Craufurd in buschement tak,
Gif they mysterit ane reskew for to make.
Than Longoueill that ay was full Savage,
With Wallace past, as ane to that skirmage.
Their four hundredth, yat was full weill arrayit,
Befoir the town, the plane baneir displayit.
It was nocht weill than knawin in yat cuntrie,
The Lyoun in gold, yat awful was to se.
Ane forray kest, and seissit mekill good,
Weirmen within, that wyselie understood.
Sone Ischit out, the pray for to reskew,
The worthy Scottis feill Inglismen they slew.
The laif for dreid, fled to the town agane,
The forray tuik the pray, and passit in plane.
Towart the Park, bot power of the town,
Ischit agane in awful barteil boun.
Ane thousand haill of men in arms strange,
Few baid within, that micht to arms gang.
Than Wallace gart the forrayaris leif ye pray,
Assemblit sone into ane good array.
Ane cruel counter was at that meitting seen,
Of wicht weirmen into their armor schene.
Feill left their life upon the Sutheroun side,
Bot nocht for thy, full baldly they abide.
Of the Scottis part than worthy men they slew,
William Craufurd that weill the perrell knew:
Out of the Park he gart the buschment pas,
Into the field quhair feill men fechtand was.
At their enter they gart full money de,
The Inglismen was wounder ^aith to fle.
Full worthily they wrocht into that place,
Baid never sa few sa lang aganis Wallace.
With sic power, that day as he was their,
On ather side assaileit wounder sair.
Into that stour sa fellounly he wrocht,
That worthy men derfly to deith was brocht.
With pointis peirssit throw plaittis birnist bricht,
Wallace him self, and Schir Thomas the Knicht.
Quhome sa they hit, maid never mair de^ait,
The Sutheroun part was handillit their sa hait.
Into that place they micht na langer bide,
Out of that field with sair hartis they ride.
Unto the town they fled full haistely,
Wallace followit, and his good Cheualry.
Fechtand sa fast into the thickest thrang,
Quhill in the town they enterit them amang.
With him Craufurd, and Longoueill ye Knicht,
And Richard als* Wallace his Cou^ing richt.
Fyftene they war, of Scottis in cumpany,
Thus hapnit they, amang that greit party.
Ane cruel portar gat up upon the wall,
Pullit out the pyn, leit the port Cule^s fall.
The Inglismen saw, enterit in was na ma,
Upon the Scottis full hardily they ga.
Bot to ane wall they have their bakkis set,
Sad straikis and sair baldly about them bet.
Richard Wallace the Turngrece weill hes seen,
He followit fast upon their portar kene.
Upon the wall, deid down in ane dyke him draif,
Gat up the port, and leit in all the laif.
Quhen Wallace men, had thus the enter wyn,
Full greit slauchter agane they have began.
They ^aifit nane upon the Sutheroun side,
That wappinis bair, or harnes in that ride.
Women and barnis, the good they tuik yame fra,
Syne gaif them leif in the rowme land to ga.
The Preistis als, that was nocht in the field,
Of agit men that micht na wappinis weild.
They slew nane sic, for Wallace charge it was,
Bot maid them fre, at larges for to pas.
Riches of gold they gat in greit plenty,
Harnes and horse, that micht them weill supple.
With French folk pleneist the town agane,
On the tent day, the field they tuik in plane.
The River down into the land they socht,
On Sutheroun men full greit maistry yai wrocht.
Than quhen true men to the King tald this taill,
Of French men he semblit ane battall.
Twenty thousand of true liegis of France,
His brother them led, was Duke of Orliance.
Throw Guyan land, in rayit battle they raid,
To follow Wallace, quha maid bot lytill baid.
For French supple to help him in their richt,
Neir Burdeous or they ouirtak him micht.
Good Wallace was their, and cho^in hes ane plane,
For su^ men tauld, yat Burdeous with greit mane.
Within schort time thocht battle for to geif,
Bot fra they wist, that French folk wald releif:
With greit power for helping of Wallace,
Other purpois they tuik into schort space.
In Dicardy sone message couth they send,
Of Wallace cu^ming they haif tauld to ane end.
Of Gloucester Capitane of Calice was,
The hardy Erll, and maid him for to pas.
In Ingland sone, and syne to Londoun went,
Of Wallace deid he tauld in their Parliament.
Sum planely said, that Wallace brak the peis,
Wise men said nay, and prayit them for to ceis.
Lord Bewmont said, he tuik bot for Scotland,
And nocht for France, yat sall e understand.
Gif our Indenturis speikis of any mair,
He hes done wrang the suith e may declair.
Wodstok answerit, said e have spokin weill,
Bot contrair richt, yat taill is euerilk deill.
Gif one be he, that band for him and his,
May na man say, bot he hes wrocht a mys.
For principally he band with us the true,
And now agane beginnis malice new.
Schir King he said, gif e think ever to make,
On Scotland weir, on hand now e should tak.
Quhill he is out, or ellis it helpis nocht,
As Wodstok said, the haill counsall hes wrocht.
Power they raissit, in Scotland for to ride,
Be land and sey, yai wald na langer bide.
Their land Oist they rayit sone in deid,
Their vangard tuik the hardy Duke to leid.
Of Gloucester, that of weir had greit feill,
Of ^ong castle the Duke gouernit weill
The myddill waird, and to the fey they send,
Schir John Psewart, yat weil ye northland ke^d*
The Knicht Wallange befoir the Oist in raid,
And sic ane way with evil Scottis men maid.
Money Castellis he gart sone oldin be,
To Inglismen, withouttin mair melle.
Or the best wist, that it was weir in plane,
Enterit he was into Bothwell agane.
Schir Iohne Psewart that come in be the se,
Sanct Iohnstoun sone gat throw ane Ieopardie
Dundie they tuik, and put Scottis men to deid,
In Fyfe fra them was nocht keipit ane steid.
And all the south, fra Cheuiot to the se,
Into the west, their micht na succor be.
The worthy Lord that should have gouernit this,
God hes him taue, we trow to lestand blis.
His Sone Walter, that bot ane Child it was,
True men him tuik, and couth in Arrane pas.
Adam Wallace, than wist of na supply,
To Rauchlie went, and Lindesay of Cragie.
Good Robert Boyd in Bute maid residence,
For haistie dissait, they tuik them to defense.
Schir John ye grahame, in Dundaf micht nocht bide,
Succor he socht to the Forest of Clyde.
The Knicht Psewart, ane Schiref maid of Fyfe,
Schir Aymeiris brother, and gaif for term of life
They landis all, that Wallange aucht befoir,
Richard Lundy, had greit dreid throw yair schoir.
He lykit nocht for to cum to their peis,
For thy in Fyfe they wald nocht lat him ceis.
To pas ouir Tay, as than it micht nocht be,
For Inglismen sair reullit that cuntrie.
Out of that land he stall away be nicht,
Auchtene with him, that worthy war and wicht.
And als his Sone, that was in tender end,
Bot after sone, he couth weill wappinis weild.
At Striuiling brig, or that the wache was set,
Their passit he, the way withouttin let.
In Du^daf mure schir John ye Grahame he socht,
Ane woman him tald, as yan befoir was wrocht.
Unto ane strenth, he went upon the morn,
Lanerk was taken with ou^g Thomas of Thorn.
Hay and Lundy they micht na langer remane,
Be south Tynto to ludge they maid in plane.
Schir John ye grahame gat wit yat yai war yair
To them he past, withouttin process mair.
Wallange gart bring fra Carlisle carriage,
To stuf Bothwell, both wine and good vernage.
Lundy and Grahame gat with of that vittall,
Richt suddandly they maid them to assaill.
Fyftie they war of Nobill Cheualry,
Aganis four scoir of Inglis cumpany.
Ane Squyar than, keipit the carriage,
All Brankistuhait haill, that was his heritage.
Lundy and Grahame, met with yat Squyat wicht,
Feill Inglismen, derfly to deith they dicht.
Sextie was slane upon the Sutheroun side,
And five Scottis, sa baldly they abide.
Greit good they wan, both gold and other geir,
Vittall and horse, thus hapnit in this weir.
Syne yai have seen, weill lang yai micht not lest,
Into that land, for thy they thocht it best.
To seik sum place, in strenth that they micht bide
For Sutheroun folk had pleneist on Ilk side.
^undyis ludge they left upon ane nicht,
Into the Lennox they past the way full richt.
To Erli Malcolme that keipit that cuntrie,
Fra Inglismen throw help of their supply.
Setoun and Lyle into the Bas abaid,
For Inglismen sa greit maistrie had maid.
That all the South was taken into their hand,
And How ye Hay they send into Ingland.
And other Airis, to presoun at their will,
The Northla^d Lordis saw na help come yame till
Ane Squyar Guthrie, amang yame ordanit they,
To warn Wallace in all the haist he may.
Out of Abirbrothok he passit to the se,
And at the Sluice land takin sone hes he.
In Flanderis land na residence he maid,
In France he past, bot Wallace weill abaid.
On his purpois, in Guyan at the weir,
On Inglismen he had done mekill deir.
Quhill good Guthrie had gottin his presence,
He haistit fast, and maid na residence.
He hes him tauld, with Scotland how it stude,
Than Wallace said. their tythingis ar nocht good.
I had exempill of times that is by worn,
Trewis to bynd, with yame that is manesworne.
Bot I as than, couth nocht think of sic thing,
Because that we tuik piece with their falls King.
Be their Chancellar the the other piece was bun^in
And that full sair our foir Elderis hes fundin.
Under that true yai gart auchtene scoir de,
That Nobillis war, the best in our cuntrie.
To the greit God, my avow heir I make,
Piece with that King think I never to tak.
He sall repent that he this weir began,
Thus mouit he with money Royal man.
Unto the King, and tald him his Intent,
To lat him pas the King wald nocht consent.
Quhill Wallace their, maid promeis be his hand,
Gif ever agane he thocht to leif Scotland.
To cum to him, his greit Seill he him gaif,
Of quhat Lordschip that he lykit to haif.
Thus at the King ane haistie leif tuik he,
Na man with him he brocht of that cuntrie.
Bot his awin men, and Schir Thomas ye Kniche
In Flanderis land, they past with all yair micht.
Guthreis Barge at the Sluice couth ly still,
To ye sey yai went, with ane full egir will.
Both Forth and Tay, they left and passit by,
On the North coist, good Guthrie was their gy.
In Montros hauin they brocht him to the land,
To true Scottis it was ane blyith tythand.
Schir Iohne Ramsay, yat worthy was and wicht,
Fra Ouchtirhous the way he cheissit richt.
To meit Wallace with men of armis strange,
For his dwelling, they had thocht wounder lang.
The true Rothuen come als withouttin baid,
In Birnane wod he had his ludgeing maid.
Barklay, Bissat, to Wallace semblit fast,
With three hundredth to Ouchtirhous he past.

The Tent Buik declairis how Wallace wan Sanct Iohnstoun be ane Ieopardie.
Ca. j.
THe latter day of August fell this case,
For the reskew thus ordanit good Wallace.
Of Sanct Iohnstou^, yat Sutheroun occupyit
Fast towart Tay they passit and espyit.
Or it was day under kynnoull them laid,
Out of the town, as Scottismen to him said:
Their seruandis I schit with Cartis, hay to leid,
Swa was it suith, and hapnit in that steid.
Than sex their come, and brocht bot Cartis three,
Quhen yai of hay was leidand besylie.
Guthrie with ten, in handis hes them taken,
Put all to deith, of them he saifit nane.
Wallace in haist, gart tak their vmest weid,
And siclyke men they waillit weill good speid.
Four was richt good, Wallace him self tuik ane,
Ane Russet cloik, and with him good Rothuen.
Guthrie, Bissat, and als good emen two,
In that Ilk fute, they graithit them to ga.
Fyftene they tuik, of men of armis wicht,
In Ilk Cart five, they ordanit out of sicht.
Full subtellie they couerit them with hay,
Syne to the town they went the ganest way.
Their Carteris had schort swordis of good steill,
Under their weid, callit forth the Cartis weill.
Schir John Ramsay, baid in the buscheme^t still,
Quhen myster war, to help yame with good will.
Their true Carteris past on withouttin let,
Atouir the brig, and enterit at the et.
Quhen they war in, their cloikis kest them fra,
Good Wallace than the chief portar couth ^a.
Upon the heid, quhill deid he hes him left,
Syne other two the life fra them he reft.
Guthrie, Bissat, did richt weill in the town,
And Rothuen als, dang of their fey men down.
The armit men, that in the Cartis war brocht,
Raise up and weill their deuoir dewly wrocht.
Upon the gait they gart feill Sutheroun de,
Than Ramsayis spy, hes seen them get enter.
The buschement brak both brig and port hes wyn
Into the town greit strife their was begun.
Twenty and ane or Ramsay come in plane,
Within the town had forty Sutheroun slane.
The Inglismen to array was nocht gane,
The Scottis as than, laiser leit yame have nane.
Fra good Ramsay with his men enterit in,
They saiffit nane, was knawin of Sutherou^ kin.
And Longoueill, ye worthy Knicht schir Thomas
Preuit weill their, and money other place.
Aganis his dynt, few Inglismen micht stand,
Wallace in him greit faith and kyndnes fand.
The Sutheroun part saw weil ye town was tynt
Feirsly they fled, as fire dois of the flynt.
Sum fled, sum fell, into draw dykis deip,
Sum to the Kirk, their life gif they micht keip.
Sum fled to Tay, and in small veschell eid,
Sum derfly deit, and drownit in that dreid.
Schir Iohne Psewart at the west et out past,
To Methuen wod he sped him wounder fast.
Ane hundredth men the Kirk tuik for succor,
Bot Wallace wald na grace grant in that hour.
He bad slay all of cruel Sutheroun kyn,
Them for to slay, he said it was na syn.
Four hundredth men within the town was deid,
Seuin scoir on life, chaipit out of that steid.
Wyfis and barnis, they maid them fre to ga,
With Wallace will he wald slay nane of tha.
Riches they fand, that Inglismen had brocht new
Pleneist the town, with worthy Scottis and true.
Schir Iohne Psewart left Methuen Forest stra^g
Went to the Gask full feill Sutheroun amang.
And syne in Fyfe quhair Wallange Schiref was
Maid Scurriouris sone, out throw ye la^d to pas.
And gadderit men, ane stalwart cumpany,
To Ardagane he drew them privately.
Ordanit them in reddy bergane bown,
Agane he thocht to sail Sanct Iohnstoun.
Quhair Wallace lay, and wald na langer rest,
Reullit the town, as than him lykit best.
Schir Iohne Ramsay greit Capitane ordanit he,
Rothuen Schiref, at ane accord to be.
This charge he gaif, gif men yame warning maid
To cum to him, withouttin mair abaid.
And sa yai did, quhen tythingis was yame brocht
With ane hundredth Wallace forth fra yame socht.
The Battle of Blak Irne side Forest. Ca. ij.
IN Fyfe he passit, to vesy that cuntrie,
Bot wrang warnit of Inglismen was he.
Schir Iohne Psewart quhe^ yai war passit by,
Fra the Oychell he sped him haistely.
Upon Wallace followit with all his micht,
In Abirnethy tuik ludgeing that first nicht.
Upon the morn with fyftene hundredth men,
To Blak Irnesyde, as his gydis couth him ken.
Their Wallace was, and micht na message send,
To Sanct Iohnstoun, to make this Journey ke^d.
For Inglismen that full subtle hes been,
Greit wachis warnit, yat nane micht pas betuene
Than Wallace said, this matter plesis nocht me,
He callit to him the Squyar good Guthrie.
And Bissat als, that knew full weill the land,
And askit at yame quhat deid was best on hand.
Message to make, our power for to get,
With feill Sutheroun we will be vnbeset.
And wickit Scottis that knawis this Forest best
They ar the cause that we may have na rest.
I dreid far mair Wallange that is the gyde,
Than all the laif, that cu^mis upon that side.
Than Guthrie said, micht we get anis ouir Tay,
To Sanct Iohnstoun it war the ganest way.
And warn Ramsay, we wald get succor sone,
Ouir suith it is, that can nocht weill be done.
Richt weill I wait, Veschell is leuit nane,
Fra the wod hauin, to ye Ferry callit Arrane.
Than Wallace said, the watter awful is,
My self can swoume. I trow and aill na mys.
Bot currour use accordis nocht for me,
And leif ow heir, it had I leuar de.
Throw Goddis grace we sall better eschew,
The strenth is strange, and we are men anew.
In Elchok Park bot forty men war we,
For seuin hundredth, and gart feill Sutheroun de.
Eschaipit weill in money vnlyklie place,
Sa sall we heir, throw help of Goddis grace.
Quhill men may fast, we may this wod hald still,
For thy Ilk man be of true hardy will.
And that we do sa Nobilly into deid,
Of us be fund, after na lak to reid.
The richt is ouris, we should mair ardent be,
I think to freith this land or ellis de.
His waillit speiche, with wit and hardiment,
Maid all the laif sa cruel of Intent.
Sum bad tak field, and gif battle in plane,
Wallace said nay, they wordis ar in vane.
We will nocht leif, that may be our auantage,
This wod to us is worth ane ei^is wage.
Of he win tymmer in haist he gart them tak,
Sillis of Aik, and ane greit Barreris make.
At ane foir front, fast in the Forest side,
Maid ane greit stre^th quhair yai purposit to bide.
Stellit them fast, to treis that growand was,
That they micht weill in fra the Barreris pas.
And se their vaill on ather side about,
Syne cum agane, quhen yai saw yair was dout.
Be that this strenth arrayit was at richt,
The Inglis Oist approchit to their sicht.
Than Psewart come, yat way for to have wend*
That they war wont, his gydis sa him kend.
At their enter, they thocht to have passage,
Bot sone they fand, yat maid yame greit stopage.
Ane thousand he led of men in armis strange,
With five hundredth he gart John Walla^ge gang.
Without the wod, that nane should chaip him fra,
Wallace with him had forty Archearis thra.
The laif was speiris, full Nobill in ane neid,
On their enemeis they bikker with greit speid.
Ane cruel counter was at the Barreris seen,
The Scottis defense, sa sicker was and kene.
Sutheroun stude aw, to enter them amang,
Feill to the ground, yai ouirthrew in that thrang.
Ane rowme was left, quhair part in front micht fair,
Quha enterit in, agane eid never mair.
Forty they slew, that ganewart wald have past
All disarayit, the Oist was all aghast.
Ane part of horse throw schot to deith was brocht,
Brak to ane plane, the Sutheroun to them socht
Than Psewart said, allace how may this be,
And do na harm, ouir greit rebute have we.
He callit Wallange, and askit his counsall,
Schiref thou art, quhat may us may auaill.
Bot few they ar, that makis this greit debait,
Iohne Wallange said, this is the best I wait.
To ceis heirof, and remane heir beside,
For they may nocht lang in this Forest bide.
For falt of fude they man in the cuntrie,
Than war mair time to make on them melle.
Or they be wyn, on force into this strife,
Feill that e leid, sall erar lois the life.
Than Psewart said, this read I will nocht tak,
And Scottis be warnit, reskew sone will yai make
Of this despite amendis I think to half,
Or de thairfoir in number with the laif.
Into ane range my self on fute will fair,
Aucht hundredth he tuik, the lykliest yat was yair.
Syne bad the laif bide at the Barreris still,
With Iohne Wallange to reull yame at his will.
Wallange he said be ford wart in this case,
In sic ane snair, we couth nocht get Wallace.
Tak or slay him, I promeis be my life,
That King Edward sall make the Erll of Fyfe.
At one Eist part we think to enter in,
I bad na mair, micht e this Barreris wyn.
Fra they be closit graithly amang us sa,
Bot meruell be, they sall na farther ga.
Assail sair, quhen e wit we cum neir,
On ather side we sall hald them on steir.
Thus Psewart their upon ane awful wise,
Wallace hes seen, quhat hes been their deuyse.
Good men he said, understand this deid,
Forsooth he said, they ar richt mekill to dreid.
one Psewart is ane worthy Nob^ll Knicht,
Ford wart in weir, richt hardy, wise, and wicht.
His assail he ordanis wounder sair,
Us for to harm, ma^nis wit can do na mair.
Plesand it is, ane wise Chiftane to ga,
Sa Chiftane like, it should greit comfort ma.
To his awin men, and they of worschip be,
Than for to se ten thousand cowartis fle.
Sen we are set, with enemeis on Ilk side,
And heir on force mon in this Forest bide.
That all the laif of us abaissit be,
Assay the first, for Goddis saik cruelly.
Craufurd he left, and Longoueill the Knicht,
Forty with them, to keip the Barreris wicht.
With him sextie, all worthy men in weid,
To meit Psewart, with hardy will he eid.
Ane manner of dyke, into the wod was maid,
Of thortour ryis, baldly he their abaid.
Ane dounwith vaill the Sutheroun to yame had,
Sone semblit they, with straikis sair and sad.
Scharp speiris than, duschand on ather side,
Throw birneis bricht, maid wou^dis deip and wide.
The vantage was, the Scottis them dantit sa,
That na Inglismen durst fra his fellowis ga.
To brek array, or formest enter in,
Of cristynit blude to se it was greit sin.
For wrangous cause, and hes been money day,
Feill Inglismen in the dyke deid their lay.
Speiris full sone, all into splenderis sprang,
With scharp swordis they hewit on in thrang.
Blude bristit out throw fine harnes and maill,
Iohne Wallange als, full scharply can assaill.
Upon Craufurd, and the Knicht Longoueill,
With their power keipit the Barreris weill.
Maid good defense, be wit, manheid, and micht,
At the enter feill men to deith they dicht.
Thus all atanis they saileit ather place,
Nane that was their durst turn fra ye Barrace.
To help Wallace na man of his durst pas,
To reskew them, sa fell the fechting was.
At ather hand they handillit war full hait,
Bot do or de, na succor ellis they wait.
Wallace was stad into that stalwart stour,
Guthrie, Bissat, with men of greit valor.
Richard Wallace, that worthy was of hand,
Psewart meruellit, yat contrair yame micht stand.
That ever sa few micht bide in battle place,
Aganis them, and machit face for face.
He thocht him self, to end that matter weill,
Fast preissit in, with ane good brand of steill.
Into the dyke, ane Scottis man gart he de,
Wallace thairfoir in heart had greit piety.
Ane mendis to have, he followit on him fast,
Bot Inglismen sa thick betuix them past:
That upon him, ane straik get culd he nocht,
Other worthy detfly to deith he brocht.
Sloppis they maid throw all the Cheualry,
The hardy Scottis than wrocht sa worthily.
Than Sutheroun saw of their good men sa dressed,
Langer to bide, yame thocht it nocht the best.
Four scoir war slane, or they wald leif the steid.
And fyftie als was at the Barreris deid.
Ane Trumpet blew, and fra the wod they draw,
Wallange left of, that sicht fra that he saw.
To sail mair, they thocht it was na speid,
Without the wod to counsall sone they eid.
The worthy Scortis, to rest them was full fane
Fell hurtis they had, bot few of them was slane.
Wallace bad all, of good comfort to be,
Thankit be God, the fairar part have we.
one Knicht Psewart hes at greit Iourneyis been
Sa fair assay I have bot seildin seen.
I had leuar on Wallange wrokin be,
Than any man that is of one mean.
The Scottis all unto the Barreris eid,
Stanchit woundis, that couth full braithly bleid.
Sum Scottismen had bled full mekill blude,
For falt of drink, and als wanting of fude.
Sum febillit fast, that had feill hurtis their,
Wallace thairfoir sichit with heart full sair.
Ane hat he hint to get watter is gane,
Other refuge as than he wist of nane.
Ane lytill strand he fand that ran him by,
Of cleir watter he brocht them abundantly.
And drank him self, syne said with sober mude,
The wine in France me thocht not half sa good.
Than of the day, three quarteris was ouir went,
Schir Iohne Psewart, hes cassin in his Intent.
To sail mair, as than he couth nocht preif,
Quhill on the morn that new men couth releif.
And keip them in, quhill they for honger soir,
Cum in his will, or ellis de thairfoir.
Wallange he said, I charge the for to bide,
And keip them in, quhill I to Cowper ride.
Thou sall remane with five hundredth at thy will
And I ye morn with power sall cum the till.
Iohne Wallange said, this charge heir I forsaik,
After this day, all nicht I may nocht waik.
Bot traistis weill, they will Ische to the plane,
Thocht e bide als, or ellis de in the pane.
Psewart bad bide, or underly the blame,
I the command on good King Edwardis name.
Or heir to God, avow I make beforne,
And they brek out to hyng the hie the morn.
Of his command John Wallange had greit dreid
Psewart fra them with nine scoir into deid.
Nixt hand the wod, and his good men of Fyfe,
The Scotts was blyith, quhe^ yt yai hard sic strife.
Wallace drew neir, his time quhen yat he saw,
To the wod side, and couth on Wallange caw.
That Knicht hes hecht ye morn to hang the hie,
Cum^n to us, I sall thy warrant be.
In contrair him, and all King Edwardis micht,
Tak we him quyk, we sall him hang on hicht.
Ane good Lordschip I sall the gif heir Eist,
In this Ilk land that thy brother hes leisit.
Wallange was wise, full sone couth understand,
Be lyklines Wallace should win the land.
And better him war, into the richt to bide,
Than be in weir upon the the other side.
With schort auysement, to Wallace in they socht,
Than Psewart cryit, and said that beis for nocht.
And falls of kind, thou art of heritage,
Edward on the hes evil wairit greit wage.
Heir I sall bide, my purpois to fulfill,
Outher to de, or have the at my will.
For all his speiche, to pas yai wald nocht spair,
With full glaid heart Wallace ressauit yame yair.
Be that Rothwen, and Ramsay of Renoun,
Be ane true Scot, yat past to Sa^ct Iohnstoun.
Them warning maid, yat Psewart followit fast
Upon Wallace, than war they sair aghast.
Out of the town, Ischit in all their micht,
With three hundredth, yat worthy war and wicht.
To Blak Irnesyde assemblit in that place,
As Wallange was gane in to good Wallace.
The Knicht Psewart hes weill their cu^ming seen
Ane fair plane field he cheisit them betuene.
Elleuin hundredth, and four scoir than had he,
The Scottis men, war five hundredth and sextie.
Their was bot few, ane plane field for to tak,
Out of the wod good Wallace can him make.
He wist na wit of them that cu^mand was,
Mair hardiment was fra the strenth to pas.
Bot quhen he hard, Rothuen and Ramsay cry,
Of Ouchtirhous blyith was this Cheualry.
Micht they of gold, have brocht ane Kingis rent,
To good Wallace micht nocht sa weill content.
Than to array they eid on ather side,
In cruel Ire at battle bowne to bide.
Worthyer men than Psewart semblit their,
In all his time Edward had never mair.
Bot Psewart saw his number was far ma,
His power sone he gart deuyde in two.
To fecht in that cause Knichtly he them kend,
In that Journey outher to win or end.
The worthy Scottis yat first amang yame baid,
Full greit slauchter on Inglismen they maid.
Into the wod befoir had preuit weill,
Than on the plane they soneit never adeill.
In curage grew, as they war new begun,
Schort rest they had, fra rising of the Sone.
Be that Ram^ay, and good worthy Rothuane,
Throw out the thickest of the preis is gane.
Sloppis they maid amang the Inglismen,
Disseuerit them be twenty, and be ten.
Quhen speiris war gane, with swordis of mettel^
To Inglismen their cu^ming sauld full deir.
Wallace and his be worthynes of hand,
Feill Sutheroun blude gart licht upon ye land.
The two feildis togidder reillit than,
Schir Iohne Psewart with money Nobill man.
To help their Lord three hundredth in ane place,
About him stude, and did their besynes.
Defendand him with money awful dynt,
Quhill all the outwart of the field was tynt.
Of commounis part, into the Forest fled,
Su^cour to seik, their men sa had them led.
The Scottis hes seen sa money in ane rout,
With Psewart stand, that Inueronit him about,
Upon all sydis, assaileit wounder sair,
The poleist plaitis with poyntis peirsit bair.
The Sutheroun maid defense full cruelly,
All occupyit was this Nobill Cheualry.
Schir Iohne Ramsay wald they had oldin been
Wallace said nay, it is all wrang e mean.
Ransoun to tak, we can nocht now begin,
On sic ane wise, this land e may nocht win.
one Knicht of auld our enemy hes been,
Sa fell to us, of them I have nocht seen.
Now he sall de throw help of Goddis grace,
He come to pay his Ransoun in this place.
The Sutheroun saw, and wist planely to de,
Reskew was nane, suppois that they wald fle.
Freschly they faucht, as they had enterit new,
Upon our side part worthy men they slew.
Tha^ Psewart said, allace throw wrangous thing
Our lyfis we lois, for desire of our King.
That felloun Knicht dou^it his life richt nocht,
Amang the Scottis full manfully he wrocht.
Bisset he straik to deith for outtin mair,
Wallace preuit with his sword birneist bair.
At Psewartis hals, he ettillit with greit Ire,
Throw pe^ane stuf, in sunder straik the swyre.
Deid to the ground he ruschit for all his micht,
Be Wallace, and thus endit that good Knicht
The remanent without mercy they sla,
For good Bisset, the Scottis was wounder wa.
In handis sum, they stikkit but remeid,
Na Sutheroun past with life out of that steid.
Than to the wod, for them that left the field,
Ane range they set thus micht they get na veild.
eid nane away was contrair our opinioun,
Good Rothuen past agane to Sanct Iohnstoun.
Schir Iohne Ramsay to Cowper Castle raid,
That house he tuik, for defense nane was maid.
Wallace, Craufurd, and with yame good Guthrie
Richard Wallace had lang been in mellie.
And Longoueill into Lundoris baid still,
Fastit they had to lang agane their will.
Wallange they maid their Stewart for to be,
Of meit and drink they fand abundantly.
The power fled, and durst na langer bide,
That was befoir upon the Sutheroun side.
Upon the morn to Sanctandrois they past,
Out of the town that Bischop bownit fast.
The King of Ingland had him thidder send,
That rent at will he gaif him in commend.
His Kingis charge, as than he durst nocht hald,
Ane wrangous Pape yat Tyran micht be called.
Few fled with him, and gat away be see,
For all Scotland, Wallace he wald nocht se.
Of him as than, he maid bot licht record,
Ga^t restoir him, that their was richteous Lord.
The worthy Knicht that into Cowper lay,
Gart spuile it upon the secund day.
Syne ordanit men, at the command of Wallace,
But mair process for to cast down the place.
Myndouris gart sone peirs out throw the wall,
Syne punciounis fyrit, unto the gound kest all.
Schir Iohne Ramsay syne to Carrell can fair,
Sutheroun was fled, and left bot wallis bair.
After Psewart they durst nocht tarry lang,
The Scottis at large out throw all Fyfe yai ra^g.
Na Inglismen was left in that cuntrie,
Bot in Lochleuin their baid ane cumpanie.
Upon that Inche in small housis they licht,
Castle was nane, bot wallit with watter wicht.
Beside Carrell semblit Wallace beforne,
His purpois was for to assay Kingorne.
Ane Knicht Musgraif, Capitane in it was,
Be schort auyse he purposit for to pas.
Erar he wald bide challange of his King,
Than with Wallace to reckin for sic thing.
That house they tuik, and lytill tarry maid,
Upon the morn withouttin mair abaid.
Atouir the mure, quhair they the tryst had set,
Neir Scotland well their ludging tuik but let.
After Supper, Wallace bad them ga rest,
My self will walk, me think it may be best.
The wynning of Lochleuin. Cap. iij.
AS he comma^dit but grunching yai have done,
Into their sleip Wallace him grauhit sone.
Past to Lochleuin as it was neir mydnicht.
Auchtene with him, that he had warnit richt
Their men weind weill he come to ves^ it,
Fellowis he said, I do ow weill to wit.
Considder weill this place and understand,
That it may do full greit skaith to Scotland.
Out of the south, and power cum them till,
They may tak in, to keip at their awin will.
Upon one Inche richt money men may be,
And syne Ische out, their time quhen yar yai se.
To bide langer heir we may nocht upon chance,
one folk hes fude, traist weill at sufficance.
Watter fra them, forsooth can nocht be fet,
Sum other wyle behouis us for to get.
e sall remane heir at this part all still,
And I my self the boit sall bring ow till.
Their with his weid in baist of castis he,
Upon one side na wache man can I se.
Held on his sark, and tuik his sword sa good,
Bund on his nek, syne lap into the flude.
And ouir he swame, for letting had he nocht,
The Boit he tuik, and to his men it brocht.
Arrayit him weill, and wald na langer bide,
Bot passit in, and rowit to the the other side.
The Inche yai tuik, with drawin swordis in had,
They spairit nane, that they befoir them fand.
Straik durris up, and stikkit men quhair yai ^ay,
Upon the Sutheroun this sadly sembill they.
Threttie they slew, that was into that place,
To make defense, the Inglismen had na space.
Their women five, was send out of that steid,
Women nor barnis, he gart never put to deid.
The good they tuik, as it had been their awin,
Than Wallace said, fellowis I make ow knawin
The pur^eyante that is within their wanis,
We will nocht tyne, ga^ sembill us all atanis.
Lat warn Ramsay, and our good men Ilkane,
I will remane quhill that this stuf be gane.
Send forth ane man their horsis for to keip,
Drew up the boit, syne beddis tuik to sleip.
Wallace power, neir Scotland Well quhilk lay,
Befoir the Sone they myssit him away.
Sum mening maid, and meruellit of that case,
Ramsay bad ceis, and murne nocht for Wallace.
It is for good, that he is fra us went,
That sall e se, and traist weill werrayment.
My heid to wed, Lochleuin he passit to se,
Bot in that place, na Inglismen knew he.
Into this land, bet^ix their watteris left,
Tythingis of him, full sone e sall heir eft.
As they about war talkand on this wise,
Message come, and chargit them to rise.
My Lord he said, to Denner hes ow called,
Into Lochleuin, quhilk is ane lyklie hald.
e sall fair weill, thairfoir put of all sorrow,
They graithit them, richt airly on the morrow.
And thidder past of Wallace will to wit,
Than semblit in, ane full blyith fellowschip.
They lugi^ yame yair, quhil viij dayis was at end
Of me it and drink, they had aneuch to spend.
Turssit forth geir yat Sutheroun had brocht yair
Gart byrn the boit, to Sanct Iohnstoun yai fair.
Bischop Sinklar, that worthy was and wise,
To Wallace come, and tauld him his auyse.
Thus he desyrit Wallace with him wald ride,
And in Dunkeld Soiorne that winter tide.
Bot he said nay, that hald I nocht the best,
And Scotland thus, in piece we can nocht rest.
The Bischop said, planely e may nocht wend,
Into the North, for men I reid ow send.
I grant (quod he) and cheisit ane messingair,
The worthy Iop was with the Bischop their.
And Master Blair, quhill Wallace come yai baid
With yat good Lord, yat Nobill cheir, yame maid.
Wallace send Blair, into his Preistis weid,
To warn ye west, quhair freindis had greit dreid.
How they should pas, or to good Wallace wyn,
For Inglismen, that held them lang in twyn.
Adam Wallace, and Lindesay that was wicht,
Rauthlic they left, and went away be nicht.
Throw out the land, to the Lennor they fair,
To Erll Malcolme, that welcu^mit yame full air.
Master Iohne Blair, was blyith of that semblie,
Good Grahame was yair, and Richard of Lu^die.
Als Robert Boyd, that out of Bute them socht,
Gat yai Wallace, of na thing than they rocht.
Bot Inglismen betuix them was sa strange,

The Erll Patrik at plane field keipit he.

To help Wallace in fence of Scotlandis richt.

Befoir Wallace, and tauld how they had done.
Bot Master Blair, sa good tythingis him brocht,

Als Inglismen, than had full mekill dreid,
Fra Fyfe was tynt, the war they trowit to speid.
The Duke and Erll that time in Scotland led,

Fra Sanct Iohnstoun, and tuik with him fyftie.

For Inglismen they had haldin the richt.
In waith men weid, and fendit them richt welll
To good Wallace they war als true as steill.
To follow him, they two thocht never lang,
Throw the Oychell, they maid yame for to gang.
Of mair power he taryit nocht that tide,
To keip the land the laif he gart abide.

For strange power of Inglismen their was.

And buskit them in ane dern steid their by.

In Ingland borne, and hecht Thomlin of weir.

To bruik that land they did power and will.

Contrair his will, gart him be to them sworn.
In their service they held him day and nicht,
Befoir the Sone Wallace gart Iop him dicht.
And send him forth the passage to espy,
On that fischear he hapnit suddandly.
All him allane, bot ane boy that was their,

For Goddis saik this man askit mercy.

In their service, aganis my will full sair,
Bot for my life, that I remanit their.
To seik fische I come on this North side,
Be e ane Scot, I wald fane with ow bide.
Than he him brocht in presence to Wallace,
The Scottis was blyith, quhen yai have seen yis case
For with his boit yai micht weil passage haif,
For Ferry craft he thocht nocht for to craif.
Upon that side, lang space they taryit nocht,
In the south land with glaid hartis they socht.
Syne brak the boit, quhen they war landit their,
Ser^ice of it, Sutheroun micht have na mair.
Than throw the Mos, they passit full good speid,
To the Torwod yat man with them they leid.
The Wedow their, brocht tythingis to Wallace,
Of his true Eme, that dwelt in Donypace.

For mair tresour ya nhe befoir micht get.

Scho gat them meit, and in quiet they baid,
Quhill it was nicht, syne reddy sone they maid.
Towart Earth hall, richt suddandly them drew,
Ane strenth their was, yat weill ye fischear knew.
Of draw dykis, and full of watter wan,
Wysel^e thairof hes warnit them this man.
On the bak side he led them priuatlie
Fra the watter, as wount to cum was he.
Our ane small brig, good Wallace enterit in,
Into the hall him self thocht to begin.
Fra the Supper, as they war bown to rise,
He salust them upon ane awful wise.
His men him followit, suddandly atanis,
Haistie sorrow was rasit in they wanis.
With scheira^d swordis, scharply about yame dang
Feill on the flure, was fellit them amang.
With Thomlin weir, Wallace him self hes met,
Ane felloun straik sadly upon him set.
Throw heid and swyre, all throw ye coist him claif
The worthy Scottis fast stikkit of the laif.
Keipit durris, and to the deith them dicht,
To chaip away, the Sutheroun had na micht.

Bot all for nocht, full fey was maid that rout.
About the fire buschit the blude sa Reid,
Ane hundredth men was slane into that steid.
Than Wallace socht quhair his Uncle should be,
In ane deip Coif he was set dulefullie.
Quhair watter stude, and he in Irnis strange,

Of that myrk hoill, brocht him with strenth and list,
Bot noyis he hard, of na thing ellis he wist.

And their with sichit, quhen he had Wallace seen.

Quhill neir the day, they sleip withouttin let.
Quhen they had sicht, spuileit the place in hy,
Fand ganand geir, both gold and Iowalry.
Ouir all that day in quiet held them still,
Quhe^ Sutheroun come, ressauit yame with good will.
In yat laubour ye Scottis was full bane,

Women and barnis, put in presoun and caif,

VAllace him self was sicker gyde that nicht,
To Dunbartane the way he cheisit richt.
Or it was day, for than the nicht was lang,
Unto the town full privately they gang.
Mekill of it Inglismen occupyit,
Good Waallce sone, throw ane dark garth him hyit
Unto ane house quhair he was wont to ken,
Ane wedow dwelt, that was friend to our men.
About her bed, on the bak side was maid,

Their Wallace callit, and sone fra scho him knew
In haist scho raise, and privately him drew:
To ane clois barn, quhair they micht keipit be,
Both meit and drink, scho brocht yame greit plenty.
Ane gudly gift, to Wallace als scho gaif,
Ane hundredth pund, and mair atouir the laif.
Nine Sonis scho had, was likly men and wicht,
Ane aith to him scho gart them sweir full richt.
In piece they dwelt, in trubill they had been,
And tribute payit to Inglis Capitanis kene.
Schir Iohne Menteith, the Castle had in hand,
Bot sum men said their was ane preuie band.
To Sutheroun maid, be meanis of that Knicht,
In their supply to be at all his micht.
Thairof as now, I will na process make,

Quhen it was nicht he bad the wedow pas,
And mark the duris, quhair Sutheroun dwella^d was.
Syne after this, he and his Cheualry,
Graithit them weill, and wappinis tuik in hy.
Went on the gait, quhair Sutherou^ was on s^ei^*
Ane greit Oistillary our Scottis tuik to keip

Sum wissit Lundy, yat chaipit was in Fyfe,
Sum wichter was, nor Setoun yan in strife.
Quhen Wallace, hard, the Sutherou^ make sic din
He gart all bide, and him allane went in.
The laif remanit to heir of their ty^hance,
He salust them with sturdy countenance.
F^llowis he said, sen I come last fra ^ame,
In travel I was, in land ouir uncouth fame.
Fra South Ireland I come in this cuntrie,
The new conqueis of Scotland for to se.
Part of our drink, and sum good I wald haif,
The Capitane than ane schrewit answer him gaif
Thou semis ane Scot unlikely us to spy,
Thou may be ane of Wallace cumpany.
Contrait our King he is ryssin agane,
The land of Fyfe he hes riddin in plane.
Thou sall heir bide, quhill we wit how it be,
Be thou of his, thou sall be hangit hie.
Wallace thocht than it was na time to stand,
His Nobill sword he grippit sone in hand.
Ouir thort the face, drew the Capitane in tene,
Straik all away, that grew abone his Ene.
Ane other braithly in the breist he bair,
Both braune and bane, ye buir^y blaid throw schair.
The laif ruschit up, to Wallace in greit Ire,
The third he fellit, full derfly in the fire.
Steuin of Ireland, and Keirly in that thrang,
Keipit na charge, bot enterit them amang.
And other ma, that to the dure can preis,
Quhill yai him saw, yair culd na thing them ceis
The Sutheroun men full sone was brocht to deid
The blyith Oistillar, bad them good aill and breid.
Wallace said nay, quhill we have laiser mair,
To be our gyde, thou sall befoir us fair.
And begin fire quhair yat the Sutheroun lyis,
The Oistillar sone upon ane haistie wyis.
Hynt fire in hand, and to ane greit house eid,
Quhair Inglismen was into mekill dreid.
For they wist nocht, quhill yat ye Reid low raise,
As wod beistis amang ye fire than gais.
With panis fell, ruschit full sorrowfully,
The laif without of our good Cheualry.
At Ilk house quhair the Oistillar began,
Keipit the duris, fra them chaipit na man.
For all yair micht, thocht king edward had sworn
Gat nane away, that was of Ingland borne.
Bot outher brynt, or but reskew was slane,
And sum throw force dreuin in the fire agane.
Part Scottis folk in service them amang,
Fra any pane freely they leit them gang.
Three hundredth men was to Dunbertane send,
To keip the land, as their Lord had them kend.
Skaithles of them, for ay was this Regioun,
Wallace or day maid him out of the town.
Unto the Coif of Dunbertane they eid,
And all that day, their soiornit but dreid.
Both meit and drink the Oistillar gart be brocht
Quhe^ nicht was cu^min, in all ye haist they mocht
Towart Rosneith full ernistly they gang,
For Inglismen was in that Castle strange.
On the Garloch they purpois them to bide,
Betuix the Kirk, that neir was their beside.
And to the Castle full privately they ga,
Under ane bray they lubgit them full la.
Under the watter quhair commoun use had they
The Castle stuf unto the Kirk Ilk day.
Ane marriage als, was that day to begin,
All Ischit out, and left na man thairin.
That fence micht make, bot seruandis in that place
Thus to that tryst they passit upon case.
Wallace and his drew them full privately,
Neir hand the place, quhen they war passit by.
Within the hall, and thocht to keip that steid,
Fra Sutheroun men, or ellis thairfoir be deid.
Compleit was maid, the marriage into plane,
Unto Rosneth they passit hame agane.
Four scoir and ma, was in that cumpany,
Bot nocht arrayit, as was our Cheualry.
To the Castle they weind to pas but let,
The worthy Scottis sa hardly on them set.
Forty atanis derfly to ground they bair,
The remanent effrayit war sa sair.
Langer in field they had na micht to bide,
Bot feirsly fled fra them on ather side.
The Scottis their with, weill hes ye enter win,
And slew all their, that in the house was fundin.
Syne on the flearis followit wounder fast,
Na Inglisman with life their fra them past.
The women sone they seisit into hand,
Keipit them clois for warning of the land.
And deid bodyis all out of sicht they kest,
Than at good eis they maid them for to rest.
On that purueyance seuin dayis ludgit their,
At rude coistis, to spend they wald nocht spair.
Quhe^ Sutheroun come, they tuik them glaidly in,
Bot out agane they leit nane of that kin.
Quhat tythingis send the Capitane of yat steid,
Their seruitouris the Scottis put to deid.
Spuileit the place, and left na gudis their,
Brak wallis down, and maid the biggingis bair.
Quhen yai had spilt all stane werk yat yai mocht,
Syne kendillit fire, and fra Rosneth they socht.
Quhen they had brynt all trein werk in yat place
Wallace gart freith the women of his grace.
To do them harm never his purpois was,
Than to Falkland, the worthy Scottis can pas.
Quhair Erll Malcolme, was bydand at defense,
Richt blyith he was of Wallace good presence.
Than he fand their ane Nobill cumpany,
Schir Iohne ye Grahame, and Richard of Lu^dy.
Adam Wallace that worthy was and wise,
Barklay, and Boyd, with men mekill to pryse.
At Cristynmes, yair Wallace Soiornit still,
Of his mother tythingis was brocht him till.
That time befoir, scho had left Ellerstie,
For Inglismen scho durst nocht in it be.
Fra thine disagysit scho past in pilgrame weid,
Sum girth to seik, to Dunfermling scho eid.
Seiknes scho had, forsooth into that steid,
Deceissit scho was, God tuik her Sprite to leid.
Quhen Wallace hard yat yir tythingis war true
How sadness sa, on Ilk side can persew.
In thank he tuik, because it is natural,
He louit God with sicker heart and haill.
Better him thocht, as it was hapnit sa,
Than Sutheroun should put her to other wa.
He ordanit Iop, and alswa master Blair,
Thidder to pas, and for na coist to spair.
Bot honorabilly ye Corpse put in Sepulture,
At his command they seruit all the cure.
Doand thairto, as deith requyrit to haif,
With rich entry, the Corpse they put in graif.
Agane they turnit, and schewit of her end,
He thankit God, quhat grace that ever he send.
He seis the world sa full of fantasy,
Comfort he tuik leit all murning ga by.
His may desire was for to freith Scotland,
Now will I tell quhat case yan come on hand.

And richt lyklie to freith Scotland agane.

For in that life richt lang he couth nocht left.

Forty they ar, all men of mekill vaill,
Be they on fuit, they will our sair assaill.

On thy richt hand ane stalwart axe is set.

Neir the Castle he drew them privately.
Unto ane Schaw, Sutheroun mistraistit nocht,
To the nixt wod with Diksoun sone he socht.

In ouir the wod, enterit or they wald ceis.

Within the clois the Scottismen them slew.
Or any scry was raisit in that stour,

Ran up the Greece quhair that the Capitane lay,
On fuit he gat, and wald have been away.
Quir lait it was, Douglas straik up the dure,
Bewfurd he fand in myddis of the flure.
With ane stif sword to deith he hes him dicht,

The men they slew, that was within they wanis
Syne in the clois they semblit all at atanis.

Gat nane bot ane, with life out of that steid.
For that the et sa lang vnsteikit was,
This spy he fled, and to Durrisdeir can pas.
Tald that Capitane that they had hapnit sa,
And other he gart unto the Ennoch ga.
And Tyberis mure was warnit of this case,
And Lochmabane all semblit to this place.

Quhen Douglas wist, that nane was fra them chaip
To sail him, he trowit yt yai wald schaip.

To warn Wallace in all the haist he micht.

With four hundredth that was of mekill mane.

That Rauinda^ll held, bot true men leit him wit
That he was out, that time in Cu^mernald,

Quhen Wallace wist, he gart Erll Malcome ly,
With two hundredth in buschement neir thairby.
To keip the house, that nane should to it fair,

For this actio^n me think yat we should strife.

Of Inglismen sone he gaif ouir that wage.

And bide thairat, rewaird should have but leis.

With Lordlyke feir, and Chiftane like was he.

Their number was sex hundredth of Renoun.

With glaid hartis they past throw Cliddisdaill.
The Seige began, was to the Sau^uhair set,

Quhen Sutherou^ hard yat Wallace was sa neir,

The Chi^tane said, sen their King had befoir,
Fra Wallace fled, their causis was the moir.
Fra South yai socht, to bide it was greit wraith

In Craufurd mure be than was good Wallace,
Quhen men him tauld that Sutherou^ upon case:

After the horse full freschly than they ride*
Five hundredth large, or they past Daiswy^toun,
On Sutheroun side, to ground was brocht down
The Scottis horse, money began to tire,
Suppois their self was feirs as any fire.
The flearis left, both wod, watteris and hill,
To tak the plane, speidfull they thocht them till.
In greit battle away full fast they raid,
Into ye strenthis they thocht to make na baid.
N^ir Lochmabane, and Ochti^hous they went,
Beside Croichmad, quhair feill Sutheroun was sche^.

And trauellit sair, they micht na farther gang.

Raithly he raid, and wrocht full money wound,
Their three Capitanis he stikkit in ane stound.
Of Durrisdeir, Ennoch, and Teberris mure,
Lord Cu^urdis Eme away to Carlisle fure.
The quhilk befoir yat keipit Lochmabane,
Na landit man with him cha^pit bot ane.
For Maxwell als, out of Carlauerok come,
On ye Sutheroun the ganest way hes nome.
Into the chase sa wilfully they ride,
Few gat away, that come upon that side.
Beside Cokpule full feill fechting they fand,
Sum drownit was, sum slane upon the land.
Quha chaipit was, in Ingland fled away,
Wallace returnit, na presoner tuik they.
In Carlauerok, that nicht resting they maid,
Upon the morn to Dumfreis bly^thly raid.
Their Wallace cryit, quha wald cum to his peis,
Aganis Sutheroun, their malice for to ceis.
To true Scottis he ordanit warysoun,
Quha taltit had, he grantit remissioun.
In Dumfreis than, he wald na langer bide,
The Sutheroun fled ^f Scotland on Ilk side.
Be sey and land without langer abaid,
Of Castellis, tounes, yan Wallace Chiftanis maid.
Reullit the land, and put it in good rest,
With true keiperis the quhilkis he traistit best.
The good Douglas, that I ow tald of air,
Keiper he was fra Drumlanerik to Air.
Because he had, on Sutheroun sie thing wrocht,
His wife was wraith, bot yat scho schew it nocht.
Under covert her malice held perfyte,
Ane Serpent waitis, her time yat scho may byte
To Douglas often, scho wrocht full mekill cair,
Of that as now, I leif quhill farther mair.
Bot Sutheroun men durst yan na Castellis hald
They left Scotland, befoir as I ow tald.
Saif ane Mortoun, ane Capitane feirs and sell,
That held Dundie, Wallace wald nocht dwell.
Thidder he past, and lappit it about,
Quhen Mortoun saw, that he was in yat dout.
He askit leif with their for lyfis to ga,
Wallace denyis, and sayis it beis nocht swa.
The last Capitane of Ingland yat heir was,
I gaif him leif haill with his men to pas.
Thou sall forthink sic maistrie for to make,
All Ingland sall of the exempill tak.
Sic men I weind, fra thine for to have worn,
Thou salbe hangit, suppois thy King had sworn*
He gart command na Scottis should to yame speik,
Confermit the seige, and said we sall us wreik:
On Inglismen, as skill will of Dundie,
Skrymgeour he maid, their Constabill to be.
Ane Ballingair of Ingland that was their,
Past out of Tay, and come to Quhitbie fair.
To Londoun send, and tald of all this case,
To hyng Mortoun sa vowit had Wallace.
Befoir this time, Edward with power eid,
To weir on France, for than he had na dreid.
Befoir he trowit Scotland to be his a win,
Quhen they him warnit how his men was ouirthrawin:
Agane he tuik, to Ingland haistely,
And left his deid, all fiklit in folly.
Gascoun he clamit all in heritage,
He left it thus, with all his hie barnage.
And Flanderis als, he thocht to tak on hand,
All their he left, and come to reif Scotland.
Quhe^ yat this King in England was cu^min hame,
Su^moundis yai maid, and chargit Bruce be name.
And other ma, that leuit under his Crown,
Bischop Barroun, to cum at his Summoun.
Quhe^ Wallace twyis throw grace had fred Scotland
This tyran King tuik planely upon hand.
For sic desire, that he micht have na rest,
He thocht to him, to make it plane conquest.
In couetise he had rungin sa lang,
Chiftanis he maid, yat they should nocht pas wrang
Gydis they these, fra strenthis them to gy,
They thocht na mair to bide at Ieopardy.
In plane battle, and they micht Wallace wyn,
He trowit of weir, they wald na mair begin.
Leif I this King makand his Ordinance,
My purpois is, to speik sum thing of France.
The Inglismen, than Guyan held of weir,
To French folk, yai did full mekill deir.
King and counsall sone in their wittis kest,
To get Wallace, them thocht it was the best.
For Guyan land the Inglismen had they,
Than schuip they thus, in all the haist they may.
For they traistit gif Scotland war weill stad,
Wallace wald cum, as he them promeist had.
The samyn Herald befoir in Scotland was,
They him commandit, and ordanit he should pas.
Into Scotland without langer delay,
Out of the Sluice als gudly as he may.
Reddy he was, in Schip he past on cais,
In Tayis mouth but baid the hauin he tais.
Quhair Wallace than, was at ye sail still,
And he ressauit the Herald with good will.
Their writ he red, and said them on this wise,
Ane answer sone he couth them nocht deuyse.
To honest Iunis, the Herald than he send,
On Wallace coist richt baldly for to spend.
Quhill time he saw how other materis eid,
Than answer he should have withouttin dreid.
The wit of France, thocht Wallace to commend,
Into Scotland with his Herald they send.
Praise of his deid, and als the descriptioun,
Of him taken their be men of discretioun.
Clerkis, Knichtis, Heraldis that him saw,
Bot I heirof, can nocht reheirs at aw.
Wallace stature of greitnes and of hicht,
Was Iudgit thus be discretioun of sicht.
That saw him both on Cheuall and in weid,
Nine quarteris large of hicht he was in deid.
Third part that lenth, in schulderis braid was he,
Richt semely strange, and richt lusty to se.
In lymmis greit, with stalwart pais and sound,
His braunis hard, with armis lang and round.
His handis maid richt like to ane Palmeir,
Of manlyke make, with naillis lang and cleir.
Proportionat fair, and lang was his visage,
Richt sad of speiche, and abill of curage.
Braid breistit heich, with sturdy craig and greit,
His lippis round, his neis was squair and treit.
Broundant broun hair on browis and breis licht
Cleir asper ene, like Dyamantis bricht.
Under his chyn, on his left side was seen,
Be hurt ane wen his color was sanguene.
Woundis he had in money diverse place,
Bot fair and haill weill keipit was his face.
Of riches als he keipit na propir thing,
Gaif yat he wan, like Alexander the King.
In time of peis meik as ane maid should be,
Quhair weir approchit, the richt Hector was he.
To Scottis men richt good credence he gaif,
Bot knawin enemyis yai couth him nocht dissaif.
Their properteis war Iudgit into France,
Of him to be, ane gudly remembrance.
Master John Blair, this Patroun couth ressai^,
In Wallace buik he breuit it with the laif.
Bot he heirof, as than tuik lytill heid,
His lauborous mind was all of other deid.
At Dundie Seige, this ernest as he lay,
Tythingis to him Iop brocht upon ane day.
How Edward King with lyklie men to waill,
Ane hundredth thousand come for to assaill.
Than Scotland ground they had taken upon case
Into sum part it greuit good Wallace.
He maid Skrymgeour at the house to ly,
With two thousand, and chargit him for thy.
That nane should chaip with life out of that steid,
That Sutheroun war, bot put yame all to deid.
Skry^geour grantit, richt faithfully to bide,
With aucht thousand Wallace can fra him ride.
To Sanct Iohnstoun three dayis he graithit yair
With sad auyse towart the south can fair.
For King Edward that time ordanit had,
Ten thousand haill, to pas that was full glaid.
With oung Wodstok, ane Lord of mekill micht,
A^ Striuiling brig he ordanit them full richt.
And their to bide, the entry for to weir,
Of Wallace than, he trowit to have na deir.
Their leif they tuik, and past on but delay,
Richt Royally into ane good array.
To Striuiling come, and their wald nocht abide
To se the North beond Forth can they ride.
Sic new curage sa fell in his Intent,
Quhilk maid Sutheroun full ^air for to repent.

Of Scottis as than, he had bot lytill dreid.
For weill they trowit for to reskew Dundie
Their Schippis come to Tay in be the se.
His gydis said, that they should leid him by

Sa war they war of Wallace and his rout.
Than in sumpart he remordit his thocht,
The Kingis command because he keipit nocht.
Bot fra he saw they fewar was nor he,

On Sehiref mure Waallce the field hes taken,
With aucht thousand, of worthy men in wane.
The Sutheroun war richt douchtie into deid,

In rayit battle seuin thousand down they bair,
Deid on the bent, that cowerit never mair.
Richt fell fechting with wappinnis grou^din kene,

The stalwart stour that felloun was and strange,
The worthy Scottis sa derfly on them dang.
That all was deid within ane lytill stound,
Nane of that place had power for to found.

The Scottis spuileit of good geir them beforne
Quhat them thocht best of fine harnes yai waill
Both gold and good, and horse that micht auaill.
To Striuiling brig, without resting they raid,
Or ma should cum, Wallace this ordinance maid.
Past ouir the brig, Wallace gart wrichtis call,
And with craftis men undid the passage all,
Syne they same folk he send to the Drip furd,
Gart set the ground with stark staikkis and burd
With nine or ten Sillis he kest the gait befoir,
Endlang the schald maid it als deip as schoir.
Than Wallace said we sall on ane side be,

Endlang the coist quhair any Veschell was.
And men with him, that besylie couth luik,

In Striuiling lay upon his purpois still,
For Inglismen, to se quhat way they will.
The Erll Malcolme Striuiling in keiping had,
To him he come, with men of armis sad.
Three hundredth haill, that sicker was and true,
Of Lennox folk, their power to renew.
Schir Iohne the Grahame fra Dundaf sickerly,
To Wallace come, with ane good Cheualry.
Tytha^dis him brocht, ye Sutherou^ come at hand
In Torphtchen King Edward was ludgeand.

Sanct Iohnis good as than yai wald nocht spair
Good Stewart of Bute come to Wallace yair,
With him he had twelf hundredth men and mair.
The Cumyng than was past in Cumm^rnald,
Upon the morn bownit the Stewart bald.
Sone to array, with men of armis bricht,
Twenty thousand than semblit to their sicht.
The Lord Stewart, and Cumyng forth ya^ ride
To the Fawkirk, and thocht their to abide

With ten thousand of worthy men in deid.
Quha culd behald his awful Lordly vul^,

Sa good Chifranis, as with sa few they b^,
Without ane King, was never in Scotland ^ene.

And money other quhilk preuit weill in preis,

Their passage maid into Slam^nane mure.
Into ane plane set Tentis and Pauilloun,

Good Iop him self Iudgit be his sicht,
In haill number ane hundredth thousand richt.
Of Wallace come the Scottis sic comfort tuik,
Quhen they him saw all dreddour they forsuik.
For of Inuy was few their that it wist,
Tressonabill folk their matter wirkis with list.
Poysoun sen syne at the Fawkirk is called,
Throw greit tressoun and corruptioun of ald.
Lord Cumyng had Inuy at good Wallace,
For Erll Patrik that hapnit upon case.
Countes of March was Cumyngis Sister deir,
Under color he wrocht on this maneir.
Into the Oist had ordanit Wallace deid,
And maid Stewart to fall with him at pleid.
That Lord he said, that Wallace had na richt,
Power to leid, and he present in sicht.
He bad him tak the vangaird for to gy*
Sa wist he weill that he should strife for thy.
Lord Stewart askit at Wallace his counsall,
Said Schir e know, quhat may us may auaill
one awful King is felloun for to b^de,
Richt vnabasit Wallace answerit that tide.
And I have seen ma swyis into Sc^la^d,
With one ilk King quhe^ Scot^s^e^ tuik on hand
With ^ewar men, than now a^ hidder soch^,
This Realm agane, to full good purpois brocht
Schir we will fecht, for we have men anew,
As for ane day, so that we all be true.
The Stewart said, he wald the vangaird haif,
Wallace answerit, and said sa God ^e ^f.
That e sall nocht, sa lang as I may ring,
Nor na man ellis, quhill I se my richteous King.
Gif he will cum, and tak on him the Crown,
At his command, I sall be reddy boun.
Throw Goddis grace I reskewit Scotland twyis
I war to mad, to tyne it on sic wise.
To tyne for boist, that I have gouernit lang,
Thus half in wraith, srawa^t him ca^ he gang.
Stewart their with all bowdnit into ba^,
Wallace he said, be the I tell ane ^a^ll.
Say forth (quod he) o^ the fairest e can,
Unhappily his ta^ thus he began.
Wallace he said thou ^akis the mekill cu^e,
Sa fairir it be wirking of nature.
How ane Howlet complenit of his Fethrame,
Quhill Dame nature tuik of Ilk bird but blame:
Ane fair fedder, and to the Howlet gaif,
Than he throw pride rebutit all the laif.
Quhairfoir should thou thy Seen schaw sa hie,
Thou thinkis nane heir, that should thy fellow be.
This makis it, thou art cled with our men,
Had we our awin, thine war bot few token.
At their wordis good Wallace brynt as fire,
Quir hastily he answerit him in Ire:
Thou leid he said, the suith full often hes been,
Their have I biddin, quhe^ thou durst not be seen
Co^trair thy enemeis na mair for Scotlandes richt,
Nor dar the Howlet, quhen yat ye day is licht.
That taill full neir thou hes tald be thy sell,
To thy desire thou sall me nocht compel.
Cumyng it is hes geuin the this counfall,
Will God e sall of our first purpois faill.
This false tratour, that I of danger brocht,
Is wounder like this Realm to bring to nocht.
For thine oggart outher thou sall bide or de,
To presoun led, or cowartly to fle.
Reskew of me, thou sall get nane this day,
Their with he ^urnit, and fra them raid his way
Ten thousand haill, away with Wallace raid,
Naue better was in all the world sa braid.
As of sic men, that leuand was on life,
Aliace greit harm fell Scotland for that strife.
Past to ane wod, fra the Fawkirk be eist,
He wald nocht bide for command nor requeist.
For charge of nane, bot it had been his King,
That micht that time bring him fra his etling.
The v^her Scottis that saw this discentioun,
For discomfort to leif the field was boun.
Bot that they men was native to Stewart,
Principal of Bute, tuik hardiment in heart.
Lord Stewart was at Cumyng greuit their,
Hecht and he leuit, he should repent full sair.
The greit trespass that he throw mysknawlage,
Had gart him make to Wallace in that place.
Of their debait it was ane greit piety,
For Inglismen than micht na blyithar be.
Haistit sa fast, ane battle to the field,
Thrertie thousand, yat weil couth wappines weild.
The Erll of Harthfurd was chosin yair Chi^tane,
The good Stewart than to array is gane.
The field he tuik, as true and worthy Knicht,
The Inglismen come on with full greit micht.
Their feill meiting was awful for to se,
At that counter they gart feill Sutheroun de.
Que^ speiris war spilt, hynt out with swerdis sone
On ather side full douchtie deid was done.
Feill on the ground was fellit in that place,
Stewart and his can on their enemeis race.
Blude bristit out throw maile burn^st bricht,
Twenty thousand with dreidful wappinis ^icht
Of Sutheroun men derfly to deith they ding,
The remanent agane fled to the King.
Ten thounsand than after the deid eschewit,
With their Chiftane unto the Oist releuit.
Agane to ray the hardy Stewart eid,
Quhen Wallace saw this worthy Nobill deid:
Held up his handis, with humbill prayer pressed,
O God he said, gif one Lord grace to left.
And power have, his worschip to attend,
To win their folk, and tak the haill commend.
Greit harm it war that he should be ouirset,
With new power they than on him reb^t.
Be that the Bruce ane awful battle rayir,
The Bischop Belk, that often had been assayit.
Forty thousand upon the Scottis to fair,
With feill effeir they rais^t up richt ^hair.
The Brucis Baner with gold and goulis cleir,
Quhen Wallace saw the battellis approchit neir:
The richt Lyoun aganis his awin Kynrike,
Allace he said the world is contrair like.
This land should be one tyranis heritage,
That cu^mis thus, to stroy his awin barnage.
Sa I war fre, of it that I said Air,
I wald forsweir Scotland for ever mair.
Contrair Bruce, I should reskew them now,
Or de thairfoir, to God I make avow.
The greit debait in Wallace wit can wald,
Betuix kyndnes, and wilful vow was maid,
Kyndnes bad him reskew them fra yair sa,
Than will said nay, quhy fuill wald thou do sa*
Thou hes na wit, with richt thy self to leid,
Should thou help him, that wald put the to deid.
Kyndnes said it, they ar good Scottis men,
Than will said wit, the verity thou may ken.
Had they been g^de all ane we had been,
Be ressoun here, the contrair weill is seen.
For they me ha^t, mair than the Sutheroun leid,
Kyndnes said nay that schaw yai nocht in deid.
Thocht ane of yame, be falls into their saw,
Becau^ of (...) thou should nocht lois them aw.
They have done weill into o^e felloun stour,
(...) yame now, and tak ane hie honor.
Will said they wald, have reft fra me my life,
I baid for them in money ane felloun strife.
Kyndnes said help, their power is at nocht,
Syne wreik on him, that all the malice wrocht.
Will said this day they sall nocht helpit be,
That I have said, fall ay be said for me.
They ar bot deid, God grant them of his blis,
Inuy lang syne, hes done greit harm and mis.
Wallace their with turnit for Ire and tene,
Teiris for baill brist out fra both his ene.
Schir Iohne ye Grahame, and money worthy wicht
Weipit in woe, for sorrow of that Knicht.
Quhen Brucis battle upon the Scottis straik,
Their truell cu^ming, maid cowartis for to quaik.
Lord Cumyng fled to Cu^mernald away,
About the Scottis, the Sutheroun lappit they.
The men of Bute befoir their Lord they stude,
Defending him, quhen feill stremis of blude:
All them about, in floitis quha^ they eid,
Baithit in blude was Brucis sword and weid.
Throw feill slanchter of feill men of his awin,
Sone to the deid, the Scottis war duirthrawin.
Syne slew the Lord, for he wald nocht be taken,
Quhe^ Wallace saw, yat yair good men war gane
Lordis he said, quhat now is our counsall?
Two choissis their is, I reid the best e waill.
onder the King his Oist abandounand,
With Bruce and Beik in one battle to stand.
one King in weir wise and felloun hes been,
Their Capitanis als, full cruel ar and kene.
Better of hand is nocht leuand I wis,
In tyranny, e trow me weill of this.
Nor Bruce and Beik, to quhat side they be set,
We have ane chois, quhilk is full hard but let.
And we turn eist, for strenth in Louthiane land,
They stu^ane ^hace, richt hard I understand.
Tak we the m^re, one King is us befoir,
Their is bot this, withouttin wordis moir.
To the Torwod, for our succor is their,
Throw Brucis Oist, forsooth first man we fair.
Amang us now, their neidis na debait,
one men ar deid, we neid nocht strive for stait.
They consent haill to wirk richt as he will,
Quhat him thocht best, they grantit to fulfill.
Good Wallace than, yat stoutly couth them steir,
Befoir them raid, into his armor cleir.
Reullit his speiris, all in aue number round,
And we have grace, for to pas throw yame sound
And few be loist, to our strenth will we ride,
Want we money in faith we sall abide.
With their armit horse, fast on the Oist yai raid,
The rei^d than raise, quhen speiris in sunder glaid.
Duschi^ in dros* ^untit with speiris dynt,
Fra forgit steill the fire flow forth but stynt.
The felloun thrang quhen horse and men renewit,
Up draif the dust, quhair yai yair pithis preuit.
The the other Oist micht nocht yair deidis se*
For stour that raise, quhill they disseuerit be.
The worthy Scottis viij. thousand down yai baie
Few was at eird that good Wallace brocht yair.
The King cryit horse upon yame for to ride,
Bot this wise Lord gaif him counsall to bide,
The Erll of ork said Schir e wirk ane mis,
To brek array, one men quyte throw them is.
They ken the land, and will to strenthis draw,
Tak we the plane, we are in perrell aw.
The King consauit, that his counsall was richt,
Reullit his Oist, and baid still in tha^r sicht.
Or Bruce and Beik micht return their battall,
The Scottis war throw, and had ane greit auail
Wallace commandit the Oist should pas away,
To the Torwod in all the haist they may.
Him self and Grahame, and Lawder turnit in,
Betuix battellis, price and prowes for to win.
And with them baid in yat place hun^rethis ^hre
Of west land men, vsit in Ieopardie.
Upon wicht horse, yat richt wyselie couth ride,
Ane slop they maid, quhair they set on ane side.
Na speiris they had bot swordis of good steill,
Their with in stour, they leit their enemeis ^eill.
How they full often had preuit been in preis,
Of Inglismen they maid feill to deceis.
Or Bruce thairof micht weill persauing haif,
Three hundredth yair was graithit to yair graif.
The hardy Bruce ane Oist abandounit,
Threttie thousand he reullit be force and wit.
Upon the Scottis, his men for to reskew,
Seruit they war with good speiris anew.
And Bischop Beik ane stuf to him to be,
Quhen good Wallace their ordinance can se:
Allace he said, one man hes mekill micht,
And ouir good will, to undo his awin richt.
He bad his men towart the Oist in ride,
Them for to saif, he wald behind them bide.
Mekill he trowit in God and his awin deid,
To saif his men into his douchtie weid.
Upon him self mekill travel he tais,
The greit battle, compleit upon him gais.
In the foir brunt, he returuit full often,
Quhome ever he hit, their sauchning was vnsoft.
That day in wa^ld knawin was nocht his maik,
Ane Sutheroun man ay he slew at ane straik.
Bot his awin strenth, micht not aganis yame be,
Towart his Oist, behouit him to fle.
The Bruce him hurt, at his returning their,
Under the hanche, ane deip wound and ane sair.
Blude bristit out, bra^thly ane speiris lenth,
Fra the greit Oist, he fled towart his strenth.
Sic ane slear befoir was never seen,
Nocht at Gaderis of Gaudifere the kene.
Quhen Alexander reskewit the Forreouris,
Micht nocht to him, be compairit in they houris.
The feill turning of for^eouris he maid,
How bandounly befoir the Oist he baid.
Nor how good Grahame with cruel hardymen^,
Nor how Lawder amang his fais went.
How them allane into the stour they stude,
Quhill Wallace was in stanching of his vsude.
Be than he had stemmit full weill his wound,
With three hundredth, unto the field can found.
To reskew Grahame, and Lawder yt was wicht,
Bot Bischop Be^k come with sic strenth and slicht.
The worthy Scottis, they reirit far on bak,
Seuin aikir breid in turning of their bak.
it was they two, their delyuerit weill,
Be his a win hand, and ane good sword of steill.
The awful Bruce, amang yame with greit mane
At the reskew, three Scottismen hes slane.
Quhome he hit richt, ay at ane straik was deid,
Wallace preissit in, thairfoir to set remeid.
With ane good speir ye Bruce was seruit but baid
With greit ^nuy, to Wallace fast he raid.
And he to him, asso^oit nocht for thy,
The Bruce him mist, as Wallace passit by.
Akwart he straik, with his schairp groundin glaif
Speir and horse craig, he all in sunder draif.
Bruce was at eird, or Wallace turnit about,
The greit battle of Sutheroun stern and stout.
They horsit Bruce, with men of greit valor,
Wallace allane was in that stalwart stour.
Grahame preissit in, and straik ane Inglis Knicht
Befoir the Bruce, upon the Basnet bricht.
That fruell stuf, and all his other weid,
Both bane and braune, ye nobill sword throw eid.
The Knicht was deid, good grahame returnit tite
Ane subtell Knicht, yair at had greit despite.
Followit at wait, and hes persauit weill,
Grahamis birny, to narrow was sum deill.
Beneth the waist, at clois it micht nocht be,
On the fillat full sternly straik that he.
Peirsit the bak, in the bowellis him bair.
With ane schairp speir, that he micht leif na mair.
Grahame turnit their, and smoit that Knicht in tene
Throw the Visair, ane lytill beneth the ene.
Deid of that dynt, to the ground he duschit down,
Schir Iohne ye Grahame swounit on his arsoun
Or he ouircome to pas to his party,
Feill Sutheroun men, that was on fuit him by:
Stikkit his horse, that he na farther eid,
Grahame ald to God his good sprite and his deid.
Quhe^ Wallace saw yis guide Knicht to deid brocht
The pieteous pane sa fair thirlit his thocht.
All out of kind it alterit his curage,
His wit in weir, was than bot ane wod rage.
The horse him bair, in field quhair sa him list,
For of him self, as than lytill he wist.
Like ane wod beist, that war fra ressoun rent,
As wi^les wy into the Oist he went.
Dingand on hard quhat Sutheroun he richt hit,
Straucht upon horse, agane micht never sit.
Into that rage, full feill solk he dang down,
All him about was reddit ane greit room.
Quhen Bruce persauit, with Wallace it stude sa,
He chargit men lang speiris for to ta.
And slay his horse, sa he culd nocht eschaip,
Feill Sutheroun yan to Wallace can yameschaip
Peirsit his horse with speiris on ather side,
Woundis yai maid, yat war both deip and wide
Of schaftis part Wallace in sunder schair,
Bot feill heidis into his horse left their.
Sum wit agane to Wallace, can redoun,
In his awin mind sa reullit him ressoun.
Sa for to de he thocht it na va^age,
Than for to fle, he tuik intill ane rage.
Spurrit the horse, he ran in ane randoun,
To his awin folk, was bydand on Caroun.
The sey was in, they stoppit and still stude,
On loud he cryit, and bad them tak ye flude.
Togidder bide, e may nocht lois ane man,
At his command they tuik the watter than.
He returnit, the entry for to keip,
Quhill all the Oist was passit ouir the deip.
Syne followit fast, and dred his horse should faill,
Him self was cled in heavy plait of maill.
Thocht he couth swoume, he trowit he micht nocht weill,
The cleir watter cuillit the horse sum deill.
Atouir the flude he bair him to the land,
Syne fell down deid, and micht na langer st^^d.
Keirly full sone ane Cuirsour to him brocht,
Than up he lap, amang the Oist he socht.
Grahame was away, and other fyftene wicht,
On Magdalene day, their folk to deith was dicht.
Threttie thousand of Inglismen for true,
The worthy Scottis upon that day they slew.
Quhat be Stewart, and syne be wicht Wallace,
For all his price King Edward rewit that race.
To the Torwod, he bad the Oist should ride,
Keirly and he passit on Caroun side.
Behaldand ouir upon the south party,
Bruce formest come, and couth on Wallace cry.
Quhat art thou their? ane man Wallace can say,
The Bruce answerit, that hes thou preuit to day.
Abide he said, thou neidis nocht now to fle,
Wallace answerit, I eschewit nocht for the.
Bot that thy power hes neir thine awin undone,
Amendis will God, heirof we sall have sone.
Langage of the, the Bruce sayis I desire,
Say forth quod he, thou may for lytill hyre.
Ride fra thy Oist, and gar yame bide with Beik,
I wald fane heir, quhat thou lykis to speik.
The Oist baid still the Bruce passit yame fra,
Na man with him, bot ane Scot yat hecht Ra.
Quhen that the Bruce out of their heiring were,
He turnit in hy, and this questioun can spear.
Quhy wirkis thou thus, and micht in good piece be?
Than Wallace said, bot in defalt of the.
Throw thy falset, thine awin wit is myskend,
I clame na richt, bot wald this land defend.
That thou vndois throw thy falls cruel deid,
Thou hes tint two, yat was worth far mair meid
Upon this day, with ane good King to found,
Nor five Millioun of fynest gold sa round.
That ever was wrocht, in werk or cune bricht,
I trow in world be nocht ane better Knicht.
Than was good Grahame, of treuth and hardyme^t,
Teiris their with fra Wallace ene down went.
Bruce said far mair on this day we have loist,
Wallace answerit, allace they war evil coist.
Throw thy tressoun yat should be our richtous King
That wilfully distroyis thine awin offspring.
The Bruce answerit, will thou do my deuyse?
Wallace said nay, thou leuis in sic ane wise:
Thou wald me make at Edwardis will to be,
it had I lever, ye morn be hangit hie.
it sall I say, as I wald counsall geif,
Than as ane Lord, thou micht at lyking leif.
At thine awin will in Scotland for to Ring,
To be in piece, and hald of Edward King.
Of that falls King I think never to tak,
Bot contrair him with my power to make.
I clame na thing as be tytill of richt,
Thocht I micht reif, sen God hes lent me micht.
Fra the thy Crown of this Regioun to weir,
Bot I will nocht sic charge upon me beir.
Greit God wait best, quhat weir I tuik on hand,
For to keip fre, that thou art ganestandand.
It micht be said of lang time beforne,
In curssit time, thou was for Scotland borne.
Schamis thou nocht, that never it did good,
Thou Regnegat deuorar of thy blude,
I vow to God may I thy master be,
In any field, thou sall far rather de:
Than sall ane Turk, for thy falls cruel weir,
Paganis to us, dois nocht sa mekill deir.
Than leuch the Bruce at Wallace ernistnes,
And said thou seis, that thus standis the cais.
This day thou art with our power ouirset,
Aganis one King, ouirhand thou may not get.
Than Wallace said we are be mekill thing,
Starker this day incontrary one King.
Than at Bigger quhair he left money of his.
And als the ^eild, sa sall he do with this.
Or de thairfoir, for all his mekill micht,
Into this field we have loist bot ane Knicht.
And Scotland now, into sic perrell is stad,
To leif it thus, I micht be ^allit full mad.
Wallace he said, it approchis neir the nicht,
Wald thou the morn, quhe^ yat ye day is licht:
Or nine of B^ll meit me at this Chapel,
By Donypace, I wald have thy counsel.
Wallace said nay, or that Ilk time be went,
War all the men hyne to the Orient.
Into ane will with Edward quha had sworn,
We sall bergane or nine houris the morn.
Of his wrang reif, outher he sall think schame,
Or de thairfoir, or fle in Ingland hame.
Bot and thou will, sone be the hour of three,
At that Ilk tryst, will God I sall the se.
Quhill I may lest, this Realm sall nocht forfait,
Bruce promeist him, with twelf Scotts to be yair.
Than Wallace said, stuid thou richteous to me,
Ane contrapeir, I should nocht be to the.
I sall bring ten, and for thy power ma,
I gi^ na force, thocht thou be f^eind or fa.
Thus they depart, the Bruce passit his way,
To Lynlithgow raid, quhair ye King Edward lay.
The field had left, and ludgit be south the town,
To Supper set, as B^uce at the Pauilloun,
Sa enterit in, and saw vacand his seit,
Na watter he tuik, bot maid him to the meit.
Fastand he was, and been in mekill dreid,
Bludy was all his wappinis and his weid.
Sutheroun Lordis, scornit in termis rude,
And said behald, one Scot eitis his awin blude.
The King thocht evil they maid sic derisioun,
Bad have watter to Bruce of Huntingtoun.
They bad him wesche, he said that wald he nocht
This blude is mine, that hurtis may my thocht.
Sadly the Bruce than in his mind remordit,
The wordis suith Wallace had him recordit.
Than rewit he sair, fra ressoun had him knawin,
That blude and land should both have been his awin.
With them he was, lang or he gat away,
Bot contrair Scottis he faucht nocht fra yat day
Leif I the Bruce sair murnand in his Intent,
Good Wallace sone, agane to his Oist went.
In the Torwod, quhilk had their ludging maid,
Fyris they bet, that was both bricht and braid.
Of nolt and scheip they tuik at sufficence,
Thairof full sone to get yame sustinence.
Wallace steipit, bot schort quhyle and sone raise,
To reull the Oist on ane good make he gais.
To Erll Malcolme, Ramsay and Lundy wicht,
With five thousand in battle yame he dicht.
Wallace, Lawder, and Cristall of Setoun,
Five thousand led, and Wallace of Ricardtoun.
Full weill arrayit into their armor clean,
Past to the field, quhair that the chase had been.
Amang deid men seikand the worthyaist,
The Corpse of Grahame for quhome yai murning may
Quhe^ yai him fand, and guide wallace him saw
He lychtit down, him hynt befoir them aw.
In armis up behaldand his paill face,
He kissit him, and cryit full often allace.
My best brother, in world that ever I had,
My afald friend, quhen I was hardest stad.
My hoip, my heill, thou was of may honor,
My faith, my help, my strenthar into stour.
In the was wit, fredome and hardynes,
In the was treuth, manheid and Nobilnes.
In the was reull, in the was governance,
In the vertew, withouttin variance.
In the lawtie, in the was greit largnes,
In the gentrice, in the was steidfastnes.
Thou was greit cause of wyning of Scotland,
Thocht I began and tuik the weir on hand.
I vow to God that hes the world to wald,
Thy deid sall be to Sutheroun full deir sald.
Martyr thou art for Scotlandis richt and me.
I sall the venge or ellis thairfoir to de.
Was na man their fra weiping micht refrene,
For lois of him, quhen they hard Wallace plene.
They caryit him with worschip and honor,
In the Fawkirk maid him ane Sepultour.
Wallace commandit his men thairfoir to bide,
His ten he tuik, for to meit Bruce that tide.
South west he past, quhair that the tryst was set,
The Bruce full sone, and good Wallace is met.
For lois of Grahame, and als for propir tene,
He grew in Ire, quhen he the Bruce hes seen.
Their salussing was bot bustous and thrawin,
Rewis thou he said, thou art contrair thy awin.
Bruce said Wallace, rebute me nocht na mair,
Mine awin deidis hes bet me wounder sair.
Quhen Wallace hard, with Bruce yat it ^ind sa,
On kneis he fell, fair countenance can him ma.
In armis sone, the Bruce hes Wallace taken,
Out f^a their men, in counsall ar they gane.
I can nocht tell perfytlie their langage,
Bot this was it, their men had of knawlege.
Wallace him prayit cum fra his Sutheroun King
The Bruce said nay, their lattis me ane thing.
I am sa bund, with witness to ^e ^e^^t,
For all Ingland I wald nocht ^a^s my Seill.
Bot of ane thing, I hecht to God and the,
That contrair Scottis, agane I sall nocht be.
Into na field, with wappinis that I beir,
In thy purpois I sall the never deir.
Gif God the grantis ouirhand of us to haif,
I will bot fle, mine awin self for to laif.
And Edward chaip, I pas with him agane,
Bot I throw force be outher taken or sl^ne.
Brek he on me, quhen that my teirme is out,
I cum to the, may I chaip fra that dout.
Of their counsall I can tell ow na mair.
The Bruce tuik leif, and can to Edward fair.
Richt sad in mind, for Scottismen that war loist,
Wallace in haist prouydit sone his Oist.
He maid Craua^d, the Erll Malcolme to gyde,
The latch way to Inner^auy^ to ride.
For their wachis ^han should them not espy,
The the other Oist him self left haistely.
Be south Manwell, quhill that they war betuene
Of the out wacht, this chaipit they unseen.
The Erll Malcolme on Lynlithgow enter^t in,
Their haistely, greit strife he can b^gin.
Wallace was nocht all to the battle boun,
Quhen that they hard, the scry rise in the town.
On Edwardis Oist they set full suddandly,
Wallace and his, maid lytill noyis or cry.
Bot occupyit with wappinis in that stour,
Feill fellit to deith, that was without armor.
All disarrayit the Inglis Oist was than,
Amang ye Pauilliounis ye Scottis quhair money man
Cuttit down cordis, gart money Tentis fall,
Nane soneit than, a^anis was fechtand all.
Good Wallace Oist, and Erll Malcolme with micht
King Edward than with awful feir on hicht:
Cryit to array, on Bruce sa stern and stout,
Twenty thousand in armis him about.
Into harnes had biddin all the nicht,
Bot frayit folk sa duilfully was dicht.
On Ilk side fled, for feirsnes of their deid,
Wallace and his, sa rouchly throw them eid.
Towart the King, and fellit feill to ground,
Quha baid yame yair, richt feill fechting hes ^ou^d
The cruel King richt awfully abaid,
To all his folk ane greit comfort he maid.
The worthy Scottis agane him in that stour,
Feill Sutheroun slew into their fine armor.
Sa fordwartly they preissit in that thrang,
Befoir the King, maid s^oppis them amang.
Inglis commounis than fled on ather side,
Bot Nobill men, their durst nane other bide.
The Bruce as than, to Scottis did na greuance,
Bot Judge he was, with feneit countenance.
Sa did he never into na battle air,
Nor it after, sic deid as he schew their.
The Erll Malcolme, be than into the town,
The Erll Harthfurd, to fle he maid him boun.
The Lennox men set their lugeis in fire,
Than feiritly fled feill money Sutheroun sire.
The King Edward, yat it was fechtand still,
Hes seen yame fle, yan lykit him full Ill.
The worthy Scottis fast towart him yai preis,
His brydill neir, assayit or they wald ceis.
His baner man Wallace slew in that place,
And syne to ground, the baner sone they race.
The Erll of ork counsallit the King to fle,
Than he returnit, sen na succor they se.
The Inglismen hes seen their baner fall,
Without comfort, to fle they purpois all.
Ten thousand men, in field and town was deid,
Of Edwardis folk, or him self left that steid.
Twenty thousand away togidder raid,
King and Chiftanis na langer tarry maid.
The Scottis in haist, than to their horse yai eid,
To stuf the chase, with worthy men in weid.
The Lennox folk, that wantit horse and geir,
Tuik them at will, to help them in yair weir.
At stragill raid, quhat Scot micht formest pas,
On Sutheroun men, quhair full greit s^auchter was
Wallace hes seen the Scottis vnordourly,
Follow the chase, he maid Maissaris in hy.
Them for to reull, and altogidder ride,
Commandand them, Ilk ane should other bide.
Into fleing the Sutheroun subtell ar,
Se they ane time, they will set on us sair.
Feill scaillit folk to them will sone renew,
For e se weill that they ar men anew.
The followaris war reullit weill with skill,
In good array they raid all at his will.
And slew dou^ fast, quhat Sutheroun yai ouirtak
Contrair ye Scottis come nocht maistrie to make.
Into the chase, they haistit them sa neir,
Na Inglisman durst fra the Oist out steir.
The frayit folk at stragill was sleand,
Drew to the King, weill ma yan ten thousand.
Threttie thousand in number yan war they,
Into array togidder past yai away.
Feill Scottis horse sa dreuin was in trauaill,
For run that day, sa Irkit began to faill.
The Sutheroun was with horse seruit sa weill,
Of Wallace chase, the Sutheroun had sum feill.
Of horse they war purueyit in greit wane,
The King changit of sindrie horse of Spane.
Than Wallace said, Lordis e may weill se,
one folk ar now, all that one King may be.
For falt of stuf we lois ouir mekill thing,
Had we good horse to pas befoir this King:
We should make end of all this lang debait,
it sum of them sall be handillit sa hait.
Part of our horse ar haldin fresche and wicht,
Set on them fast, quhill that we are in micht.
With yat ye Scottis sa hard amang them drew
Of the outwaird three thousand yair yai slew.
In Craufurd mure money ane man was slane,
Edward gart call the Bruce mekill of mane.
Than said he thus, good Erll of Huntingtoun,
e se the Scottis puttis feill to confusioun.
Wald e with men, agane on them releif,
And mar them anis, I sall quhill I may leif:
Luif ow far mair than any other Knicht,
And for all this sall put ow to our richt.
Than said the Bruce, Schir lous me of my band,
And I sall turn, I hecht ow be my hand.
The King full sone considderit in his mind,
Quhen he hard Bruce answer him in sic kind:
Fra Inglismen the Brucis heart set is,
Than kest he thus, how he should mend that mis.
And sa he did in Ingland at his will,
Na Scottis man he leit with Bruce bide still.
Bot quhair he past, held him in subiectioun,
Of Inglismen, under ane greit bandoun.
He turnit nocht, nor na mair langage maid,
In rayit battle the King to Sulway raid.
With mekill pane past upon Ingland coist,
Fyftie thousand in that travel they loist.
Quhen Wallace saw, he chaipit was away,
Upon command, agane returnit they.
To Edinburgh withouttin wordis moir,
Put in Craufurd, that Capitane was befoir.
Of heritage he had in Manwell land,
Wallace commandit, Ilk man should hald in hand.
Their awin office, as they befoir time had,
Put in good piece, Scotland in richt he stad.
On the tent day to Sanct Iohnstoun he went,
Semblit Lordis, syne schawit yame his Intent.
Skrymgeour come, yat than had wyn Dundie,
Wallace command that time weill keipit be.
He saileit sa, quhill strange hounger yame draif,
Sa ^ebillit war, the house to him they gaif.
They wageouris sone, he put to confusioun,
Syne brocht Mortoun to make ane conclusioun.
Befoir Wallace, and sone fra he him saw,
He garthyng him, for all King Edwardis aw.
Masounis, myndouris, with Skrymgeour forth he se^d,
Kest down Dundie, and yairof maid ane end.
Wallace sadly, quhen their deidis war done,
The Lordis he callit, and his will schew yame sone.
Good men he said, I was our Governor,
My mind was set to do ow ay honor.
And for to bring this Realm to richteousnes,
For it I past in money panefull place.
To win our awin, my self I never spaird,
At the Fawkirk they ordand me rewaird.
Of their rewaird, e heir na mair throw me,
To sic giftis God will full weill have E.
NOw e ar fre throw the maker of micht,
He grant ow grace for to defend our richt
Als I presume gif harm be ordand me,
They ar Scottis men, quhilk should ye wirkaris be
I have aneuch of our auld enemeis strife,
Me think our awin should nocht Inuy my life.
My office heir, ouir planely I resing
I think na mair to tak on me sic thing.
In France I will, and wyn my leuing their,
As now auysit, and hame to cum na mair.
Lordis ganestude, bot all that helpit nocht,
For any their, he did as him self thocht.
Bischop Sinklair, was vesyit with seiknes,
Into Dunkeld, and syne throw Goddis grace:
He recouerit quhen Wallace past away,
After the Bruce he leuit money ane day.
Good Wallace thus tuik leif in Sanct Iohnstoun
Auchteue with him, to Dundie maid yame boun.
Longoueill past, that douchtie was in deid,
The Barrounis sone of Breichen with him eid.
Two brether als, with their Uncle them dicht,
Simon Wallace and Richard that was wicht.
Schir Thomas Gray, this Priest can with him fair

Good Keirly past, had been with Wallace lang,
And done full weill in money felloun thrang.
This Keirly than, that couth with Wallace fair,
Will Ker he hecht, mine Author dois declair.
Keirlie in Irisch, is bot Ker lytill called,
In Carrik he had heritage of ald.
His foirbear, quhilk worthy was of hand,
Sanct David King him brocht out of Ireland*
Syne at Du^moir, quhair first Norowais ^ome in
This good Ker maid greit discomfit of yair kin.
With seuin hundredth, he vincust nine thousand,
Sum drownit in Done, sum slane upon ye land.
They landis haill the good King gaif him till.
How Wallace past, now farther speik we will.
How Wallace met with Iohne of Lyn upon the sey. Cap. ij.
AMang Merchandis yus Wallace tuik ye se,
Pray we to God, that he their helper be.
They saillit forth be part of Ingland schoir,
To Humber mouth, quhen that they come befoir.
Out of the South ane greit Reid Saill yai se,
Into the Top, three Leopardis standand hie.
The Merchandis than, ye sign quhe^ yat yai saw
Cumand sa neir, they war discomfort aw.
For weill they wist, that it was Iohne of Lyn,
Scottis to slay, he said it was na syn.
Their frayit folk they eid to Confessioun,
Than Wallace said, sic ane deuotioun:
it saw I never, in na place quhair I past,
That for ane Schip, me think ow all aghast.
one wod Cattis, sall do us lytill deir,
We saw yame faill twyis ma quhen yat yai weir.
On ane fair field, sa sall they on the se,
Despite it is, to se them stand sa hie.
The Steirsman said, Schir will e understand,
He saisis nane, that is borne of Scotland.
We may nocht fle fra one Barge wai^ I weill,
Weill stufit yai ar, with gun and gane of steill.
Upon the sey one Reuar lang hes been,
To richteous men he dois full mekill tene.
Micht we be saifit we rek nocht of our good,
This use he hes, in schort for to conclude.
Ane flude he beiris upon his coit armor,
Ay drownand folk, sa paintit is his figour.
Suppois we murne, e should have na meruaill,
Than Wallace said, heir is men of mair vaill:
To saill the Schip, thairfoir in how thou ga,
And thy feiris, na mair cu^mir thou ma.
Wallace and his, than sone to harnes eid,
Quhen they war graithit into their worthy weid
Him self and Blair, and the Knicht Longoueill,
Their three hes taken to keip the mydschip weill.
Befoir was aucht, and sex be eft he kend,
Syne two he cheisit; the Top for to defend.
And Gray he maid yair Steirisman for to be,
The Merchandis than saw them sa manfully:
Defend them self, because they had na weid,
Out of the how they tuik skynnis good speid.
Ay betuix two stuffit woll as they micht best,
Agane the straik, that they micht sumpart lest.
Than Wallace leuch, and commendit them aw,
Of sic harnes, befoir he never saw.
Be that the Barge come on them wounder fast,
Seuin scoir in her, that was na thing aghast.
Quhen Iohne of Lyn saw yame in armor bricht
He leuch and said, their haultand wordis on hicht.
one glaikit Scottis, can us nocht understand,
Fuillis they ar, new cu^min of the land.
He cryit stryke, bot nane answer they maid,
Blair with ane Bow, schot fast withouttin baid.
Or they clippit, he schot bot arrowis three,
And at ilk schot, he gart ane Reuar de.
The Briggantis than yai bikkerit wounder fast,
Amang the Scottis, with schot of gunnis cast.
And they agane, with speiris heidit weill,
Feill woundis maid, throw plaitis of fine steill.
Ather other festnit with clippis kene,
Ane cruel counter their was at schipburd seen.
The derf schot draif als thick as haill schour,
Lestit yair weill, neir the space of ane hour.
Quhen schot was gane, ye Scottis greit comfort had
At hand straikis they war sicker and sad.
The Merchandis als, with sic thing as yai micht,
Preuit full weill, in defense of their richt.
Wallace and his, at neir straikis quhen they se,
With schairp swordis, yai gart feill Brigga^tis de.
They in the Top, sa wichtly wrocht with hand,
In the south Top yair micht na Reuar stand.
All the mydschip of Reuaris was maid waist,
That to gif ouir in point they war almaist.
Than Iohne of Lyn was richt greitly aghast,
He saw his folk about him fail fast.
With egir will he wald have been away,
Bad wynd the Saill in all the haist they may.
Bot fra the Scottis than micht yai nocht eskey,
The Schippis sa sair on ather side they wey.
They saw na thing that micht be to them eis,
Craufurd on loft, their Saill brynt in ane bleis.
Or Iohne of Lyn schuip for to leif that steid,
Of his best men, sextie war brocht to deid.
Their schip by ouris, ane burd was mair of hicht,
Wallace lap in amang they Reuaris wicht.
Ane man he straik, ouir schip burd in the se,
On the ouir loft he slew sone other three.
Longoueill enterit, and als good Master Blair,
They gaif na grace, to freik yat yai fand their.
Wallace him self with Iohne of Lyn he met,
At his collair ane felloun straik he set
Both Helm and heid, fra the schulderis he draif,
Blair ouir the burd, in the sey kest the laif.
Of his, body than all the remanand,
Enterit and slew, the Briggantis that yai fand.
The Schip they tuik, greit gold and other geir,
That they Reuaris had gadderit lang in weir.
Bot Master Blair spak na thing of him sell,
In deid of armis, quhat adventure that befell.
Schir Thomas Gray was Priest yan to Wallace
Put in the buik how them hapnit this case.
That Blair was in, and money worthy deid,
Of quhilk him self had na plesance to reid.
Wallace gart reull the schip with his awin men,
And saillit forth the richt course for to ken.
In the Sluice hauin, quhill they enterit be,
The Merchandis weill he helpit in saiftie.
Of gold and geir he tuik part that they fand,
Gaif them the Schip, syne passit to the land.
Throw Flanderis raid, upon ane gudly wise,
Enterit in France, and syne socht to Parise.
The glaid tythingis, yat to the King was brocht,
Of Wallace cu^ming, it comfort all their thocht.
They trowit be him, to get redres of wrang,
The Sutheroun had, in Guyan wrocht sa lang.
The Peiris of France war still at yair Parliament
The King commandit, with haill and true Intent
They should foirse ane Lordschip to Wallace,
The Lordis than all demit of this case.
For Guyan was all haill out of their hand,
They thocht it best for to gif him that land.
For weill they trowit, he had wrocht sa befoir,
He should it wyn, or ellis de thairfoir.
Alswa of it they micht na proffeit haif,
This was the cause to Wallace they it gaif.
This Decreit sone they schew unto the King,
Displesit he was, they maid him sic ane thing.
Of Guyan thus, quhen Wallace had ane feill,
Na land he said, lykit him half sa weill.
My chance is thus, for to be ay in weir,
And Inglismen, hes done our Realm may deir.
It was weill knawin my defense richteous yair,
Richt have I heir, my comfort is the mair.
I thank ow Lordis, maid sic rewaird to me,
our purpois is, I sall nocht Idill be.
The King bad him be Duke of Guyan land,
To yat command Wallace was ganestandand.
Because that land was haistely to conqueis,
His thocht was ay to win it throw Goddis grace
Bot nevertheless the King had maid him Knicht,
And gaif him gold for to mantene his richt.
And syne gaif charge to all weirmen in France,

And als of him he bad him armis tak,

In our service, or ellis thairfoir to de.
Good Wallace thocht his time he wald not waist
Unto the weir, he graithit him in haist.
All Scottis men that was into that land,
To him they socht with their fewtie and band.

In Wallace help, this good Knicht glaidly gais.
Ten thousand haill of Nobill men they wair,
The braid Baner displayit of Scotland their.
Their weirmen sone upon Guyan they ^ure,
Brak bigginges down, quhilk had been stark and sture
Sutheroun they slew, agane them maid debait,
Brichtly on breid, they raisit fyris hait.
Schemon yai tuik, that Wallace first had winin,
And slew all men of Sutheroun yair was fundin.
Into that town Wallace his dwelling maid,
All their about he wan the country braid.
The worthy Duke of Orlyance was Lord,
Semblit his folk into ane good accord.
Twelf thousand than, he had in armor bricht,
And thocht to help good Wallace in his richt.
Leif I them thus, the Duke and Wallace both,
And speik su^ part how Scotland tuik greit skaith.
How Edward King of Ingland come in Scotland and maid haill Conqueis thairof.

Than said the Bruce, fell their sa fair ane chance,
That we micht get agane Wallace of France:
Be wit and force, he couth this Kingrik wyn,
Allace we have been ouir lang haldin in twyn.
To that langage Cumyng maid na record,
Of auld deidis into his mind remord.
The Bruce and he completit forth their band,
Syne yat same nicht seillit it with their hand.
This Ragment left the Bruce with Cumyng yair
With King Edward hame in Ingland couth fair.
And yair remanit, quhil yis ragme^t was knawin,
Three eir or mair, or Bruce preissit to his awin.
Sum men demis, Cumyng the Ragment send,
Sum men thairfoir, agane makis defend.
Nane may say weill that Cumyng was saikles,
Because his wife was Edwardis Cousignes.
He seruit deid be richt law of his King,
Sa reklesly myskeipit sic ane thing.
Had Bruce past by, but baid to Sanct Iohnstoun
Be haill assent, and ressauit his Crown.
On Cumyng syne he micht have done the law,
He couth nocht th^ill, fra time that he him saw.
Thus Scotland left in hard perplexity,
Of Wallace ma^e, in him part speik will we.

The Twelft Buik declairis how Wallace Conqueist the land of Guyan, and how he
was maid Lord thairof.

THe sair travel, the ernist besynes,
The fell laubour he had in money place.
To win the land, yat ye good King him gaif
Into his Regne he wald na Sutheroun saif.
In Guyan land Wallace was still at weir,
Of Scotlandis lois, it did his heart grei^ deir.
Of true Scottis in mind he had piety,
He thocht to help, his time quhen he micht se.
Of set battellis five he discomfeist haill,
But Ieopardie, and money strange assaill.
Syne they forsuik, and durst him nocht abide,
The Sutheroun fled, fra thine on ather side.
To Burdeous, into greit multiply,
The town they stuf, with vittallis be the se.
All Guyan land Wallace tuik to his peis,
To Burdeous he past or he wald ceis.
On out biggingis full greit maistrie he maid,
Still twenty dayis, at strange assaileing baid.
Forthis and werk that was without the town,
They brak and brynt, and put to confusioun.
Hedgis and alayis, be laubour that was their,
Fuileit and spilt, they wald na fruitis spair.
The Inglismen maid greit defense agane,
With schot and cast, that mekill war of mane.
Of gu^nis they war, and ganeis stuffit weill,
All artaile, and wappinis of fine steill.
With men and meit within was buskit been,
The greit Capitane, was wise, cruel, and kene.
Of Gloucester the huge Lord and Here,
The Erll had been ay vsit into were.
Keipit his men be wit and hardyment,
Without the town yair durst nane fra him went.
The land without was neir waistit away,
Weirmen sa lang into the country lay.
In Wallace Oist sa scant was of vittaill,
They micht nocht bide na langer to assaill.
Than this wise Lord the Duke of Orlyance,
To Wallace said, Schir e should ken this chance.
It standis ouir weill with yis falls sutherou^ blude
For on na wise can we stop their fude.
The hauin they have, and schippis at their will,
Of Ingland cu^mis, vittall aneuch them till.
The land is pure of vittall should us beild,
And e se weill, als they forsaik the field.
They will nocht fecht, thocht e all eir should bide,

My counsall is, in plane anent this thing,
That e wald pas with worschip to the King.
Be his assent, e may at laiser waill,
With prouisioun agane them to assaill.
Wallace Inclynit, and thankit this wise Lord,
Than they returnit, all in ane good accord.
Past up in France, with honor to the King,
And schew him haill the verity of this thing.
And he thairof in heart was wounder glaid,
French men befoir, yat hundredth eir nocht had:
Of Guyan haill sa mekill in their hand,
Writing be than was new cu^min of Scotland.
Fra part of Lordis, and good Bischop Sinklair,
Besocht the King into their termis fair.
Of his gentrice, and of his gudly grace,
For their supple, to counsall good Wallace:
To cum agane, and bring them of bandoun,
And tak to weir, the Crown of that Regioun.
This writ as than, he wald nocht to him schaw,
Richt laith he was, for freindschip, feid, or aw.
Wallace should pas sa sone fra his presence,
Ane dwelling place he tuik to his residence.
In Schynnone still, Wallace his dwelling maid,
And held about, richt lykand landis braid.
Ane kene Capitane than clamit in heritage,
Office of it, and greit landis in wage.
Thairfoir he thocht good Wallace for to sla,
Under color sic maistrie for to ma.
Lang time he socht to get ane day and place,
Said he desyrit in service to Wallace.
ANe tryste they set with fyftene on the side,
Forty their by he gart in buschement bide.
Of men in armis, quhen he with Wallace met,
Richt awfully he bad them on him set.
Nane armor had Wallace men in that place,
Bot sword and knyfe yai bure on yame throw grace
Part of his men left neir ane Forest side,
Richt busteously the Capitane said that tide:
That Wallace held of his landis vnricht,
Richt soberly he said to that French Knicht:
I have na land, bot quhilk the King gaif me,
My life thairfoir hes been in Ieopardie.
The Knicht answerit, thy life sall be forlorn,
Or ellis that land, the contrair quha had sworn.
Abak he lap, and out ane sword he drew,
The buschement brak, quhen he that takin schew.
Good Wallace thocht that matter stude not weill,
He grippit sone ane scheirand sword of steill.
And at ane straik the Knicht to deith he draif,
About sextene sone lappit all the laif.
Wallace and his, sa worthily they wrocht,
Full feill they ^lew, that ^airest on them socht.
The Knichtis brother, yat stalwart was and strange,
And thocht they should be vengit or they gang.
Of Wallace men sum part he woundit sair,
Mawand their was, into ane Meadow their:
Nine stout Carllis, all seruandis to that Knicht,
Syithis they hynt, and ran in all their micht:
To the fechtaris, or they come neir that place,
Bot them persauit, richt weil hes good Wallace.
Sa awful thing, of sic he never saw,
Them to resist, him self can to them draw.
Into the stout left his men fechtand still,
To meit they Carllis, that come with egir will.
The first leit draw at Wallace with his Syith,
Deliver he was, and heich ouirlap it swyith.
Ane akwart straik hit the Churll on the heid,
Derfly on ground, he hes him left for deid.
The the other he met, ouir lap his Syith sa kene,
On the schulder, als straik him in that tene.
Throw all the coist, the Nobill sword down schair
The third he met, with ane full awful fair.
The groundin Syith, at Wallace he leit draw,
This good Chiftane clenely ouir lap them aw.
With his guide sword he maid ane hiddeous wou^d
Left him for deid, syne on the feird can found.
On the Rig bane in greit Ire can him ta,
Cleuit the coist richt cruelly in two.
Three formest Syithis yis good Wallace ouir lap,
And four he slew, yai saw sic was their hap.
For ane man ay he slew at euerilk straik,
The last fled first, this can their power ^laik.
Wallace followis, and sone the fyft ouirtais,
Straik him to deith, that na farther he gais.
Syne sped him sone, unto his men agane,
Be than they had the Knichtis brother slane.
Fyftie and sex, derfly to deith was dicht,
Except seuin men, that fled out of their sicht.
Five Mawaris als, that Wallace self with met,
To Frenchemen, sen syne na sic tryst set,
Because that they him brocht to sic ane case,
The King hard tell, weill chaipit was Wallace.
Send for him sone, syne prayit him for to be,
Of his houshald, and leif in good saiftie.
For weill he saw they had him at Inuy,
Still with him self, he gart him bide for thy.
Two eiris their, Wallace with mirth abaid,
Still into France money good Journey maid.
The King him pleisit in all his gudly mane,
Fra him he thocht, he should nocht part agane.
Lordis and Ladyis honourit him reverently,
Wretchis and Schrewis, ay had him at Inuy.
How Wallace slew the two Campiounis. Cap. i^.
Two Campiounis, yat time dwelt with ye King
Had greit despite, at Wallace in all thing.
Togidder eid ay their two Campiounis,
Of felloun force, and thrawart conditiounis.
Richt greit despite they spak ay of Scotland,
Quhill on ane day, it hapnit upon hand.
Wallace and they war leuit them allane,
Be adventure, into ane house of stane.
They vsit to beir na wappinis in that hall,
They trowit thairfoir, ane mys yai micht not fall.
Their commonnit they of Scotland scornefully,
Than Wallace said, e wrang us utterly.
Sen we are bund in freindschip to our King,
And he of us, is plesit in all thing.
All Scottismen hes helpit this Realm fra dreid,
Me think e should, gif good word for good deid.
Quhat may e speik of our enemeis bot evil,
In lichtlynes they maid answer their till.
And him dispytit in their langage als,
e Scottis they said, hes ever it been falls.
Wallace tuik ane, on the face in his tene,
With his good hand, quhill neis mouth and ene:
Throw the braith blaw, all buschit out of blude,
Grouflingis to ground he smoit him quhair he stude
The the other hynt to Wallace in that steid,
For weill he weind, his fellow had been deid.
And he agane, in grief him grippit sair,
Quhill his spreit faileit, yat he micht do na mair.
The first freik raise, and smoit on Wallace fast,
Both to the deith he brocht them at the last.
Upon ane Pillair their harnis out he dang,
And with his handis out at ye dur yame slang.
And said quhat Devil, mouit one Carllis at me,
Lang time in France, I wald haif lattin yame be
Traist weill in treuth, thus war they gane in deid
Thocht French me^ now, not lykis yairof to reid.
Als I will ceis, and put it out of Ryme,
Better it is, quha richt can luik the time:
Money greit Lord was displeisit in France,
Bot ye good King, yat knew all haill the chance.
Richt greit despite, of Scotland spokin had they,
This passit ouir, quhill yat upon ane day:
Was nane of them, yat durst it undertake,
He had done wrang, or yairfoir battle make.
How Wallace slew the Lyoun in the Barrace. Cap. iij.
THis Royal Roy ane hie worschip him gaif,
As Conqueror, him honourit ouir ye laif.
Ane fell Lyoun yis King had gart be brocht
Within Barrace, for greit harm yat he wrocht.
Tyrlisit in Irne na mair power him gaif,
Of wodnes he exceidit all the laif.
Bot he was fair, and richt felloun in deid,
In that strange strenth he gart men him feid.
Keipit him clos, for men and bestiall,
In Court yair dwelt two Squyares of greit vaill.
That Cousingis war, to ye Ca^piou^is two,
The quhilk befoir Wallace hapnit to sla.
Ane band they maid in preuy conclusioun,
At their power to wirk his confusioun.
Be any mean, throw fraud and subteltie,
After yairfoir yai thocht nocht for to de.
To deith or schame, sa yat yai micht him bring,
Upon ane time they went unto the King.
This Scot they said, that e sa weill fair make,
He seis nocht heir, bot he wald undertake.
Be his greit force to put to confusioun,
Now he desyris to fecht with our Lyoun.
And bad us ask, at ow this battle strange,
e grant him leif in the Barrace to gang.
Sadly agane, to them answerit the King,
Sair me forthinkis he desyris sic a thing.
Bot I will nouther, for grief nor it plesa^ce,
Deny Wallace, quhat he desyris in France.
Than went they forth, and sone met with Wallace,
Ane figurat taill they tauld him in yat case.
Wallace they said, the King desyris that e,
Direne battle, sa cruel for to se.
And chargis ow, to fecht with this Lyoun,
Wallace answerit in haistie conclusioun.
And I sall do quhat be the Kingis will,
At my power richt glaidly to fulfill.
Than passit he unto the King but mair,
Ane Lord of Court, quhen he approchit their:
Vnwyselie speirit without prouisioun,
Wallace dar e, ga fecht with our Lyoun?
And he said e, sa the King suffer me,
Or with our self, gif e ocht better be.
Quhat will e mair, this thing admittit was,
That Wallace should unto the Lyoun pas.
The King chargit to bring him good harnes,
And he said nay, God scheild me fra sic cais.
I should it tak, gif I faucht with ane man,
Bot for ane Dog, that nocht of armis can.
I will have nane, bot singlil as I ga,
Ane greit mantill about his hand can ta.
And ane good sword with him he tuik na mair,
Abandoundly in Barrace enterit their.
Greit cheineis was wrocht in ye et with a gin,
And pullit to, quhen Wallace was thairin.
The wod Lyoun, on Wallace quhair he stude,
Rampand he brayit, for he desyrit blude.
With his round pollis in the mantill rocht sa,
Akwart the bak it Wallace can him ta.
With his good sword, that was of birneist steill,
His body in two, it cuttit euerilk deill.
Syne to the King he raikit in greit Ire,
And said on loud, was this all our desire?
To wair ane Scot this lichtly into vane,
Is their ma Doggis, yat e it wald have slane?
Ga bring yame forth, sen I man Doggis quell,
To do bidding, quhill yat I with ow dwell.
It ganis full weill, to graith me in Scotland,
For greiter deidis, yair men hes taken on hand.
Than with ane Dog in battle to encheif,
At ow and France, for ever I tak my leif.
The King persauit yat Wallace greuit was,
Sa ernistly he askit leif to pas.
Rewit in his mind, that it was hapnit sa,
Sa lewd ane deid, to lat him vnderta.
Knawand the worschip, and ye greit Nobilnes,
Of him quhilk sprang, yat time in money place.
Hamely he said, it should displeis ow nocht,
It e desyrit, it bred never in my thocht.
And be the faith I aw the Crown of France,
I thocht never to charge ow to sic chance.
Bot men of vaill, that askit it for ow,
Wallace answerit, to God I make ane vow:
I lykit never, sic battle to be in,
Upon ane Dog, na worschip is to win.
The King consauit how this falset was wrocht,
The Squyaris both, was to his presence brocht.
Culd nocht deny, quhen they come him befoir,
All their trespass, they tald withouttin moir.
The King commandit, yai should be done to deid,
Smoit of their heidis without any remeid.
The Campiounis, lo for Inuy caus^es,
To sudda^d deith Wallace yame brocht throw cais
The Squyaris als, fra yair falsnes was kend,
Inuy yame brocht, both to ane suddand end.
Lordis behald, Inuy the evil Dragoun,
In cruel fire he byrnis this Regioun.
For he is nocht yat aboundis in Inuy,
To sum mischief, it bringis them haistely.
Forsaik Inuy, thou sall the better speid,
Heirof as now, I will na farther reid.
Bot in my matter, that I befoir began,
I sall declair, als planely as I can.
QVhen Wallace saw, they had him at Inuy,
Langer to bide, he couth nocht yan planely.
Better him thocht, in Scotland for to be,
And adventure tak, outher to leif or de.
To help his awin, he had far mair plesance,
Than their to bide, with all the wealth in France.
Than his haill mind, manheid, and curage,
Was planely set, to win out of bondage.
Scotland agane, fra pane, and mekill schoir,
He vowit he should, or ellis de thairfoir.
The King hes seen how good Wallace is set,
The letter than, him gaif withouttin let.
The quhilk of lait fra Scotland was him send,
Wallace it saw, and weill yair harmis kend.
Be the first writ thairto accordiall,
Them to supple, he thocht he wald nocht faill.
Quhairof should I, heirof lang process make,
Wallace of France ane gudly leif can tak.
The King hes seen, it wald nocht ellis be,
To Chalmer went, behald him micht nocht he.
For greit langour, quhen Wallace can remufe,
The King to him keipit kyndnes ay and lufe.
Iowellis and gold, his worschip for to saif,
He bad them gif als mekill as he wald haif.
Lordis and Ladyis weipit wounder fast,
Quhen Wallace their, sa tuik his leif and past.
Na man he tuik, bot quham he thidder brocht,
Agane with him good Longoueill forth socht.
For pane or blis, yat good Knicht left him never,
For case befell, quhill deith maid yame disseuer.

At Ernis mouth, and is to Elchok gane.
He gart the Schip in covert saill away,
Sa out of sicht, they war or it was day.
At Elchok dwelt, ane Wallace Cousing deir,
That Craufurd hecht, ye house quhe^ yai come neir.
On the bak side Wallace ane wyndo fand,
And in he callit, syne Craufurd come at hand.
Fra time he wist, that it was good Wallace,
Into his Barn he ordanit yame ane place.
Ane mow of corn he biggit them about,
And closit it weill, nane micht persaif their out.
Bot at ane place quhair meit was to yame brocht
And bedding to, als gudly as he mocht.
Ane dern hoill forth on the north side they had,
Unto the watter, quhair of Wallace was glaid.
Four dayis or five, in rest yai soiornit their,
Quhill meit was gane, than Craufurd bownit for mair
To Sa^ct Iohnstoun yair purueyance to by
Inglismen thocht he tuik mair abundantly:
Than he was wount in any time befoir,
They have him taken, put him in presoun ^oir.
Quhat gaistis he had, to tell they maid requeist,
He said it was bot to ane Kirking feist.
it they presumit the cu^ming of Wallace,
Knawledge to get, yai set ane subtell race.
They leit him pas with thing that he had bocht,
Syne after sone in all the haist they mocht.
To harnes eid the power of the town,
Aucht hundredth men with Buttellar maid yame boun
Followit on dreich, quhill yat yis man come hame
Wallace him saw, and said he seruit blame.
In my sleiping ane fell visioun me tald,
Till Inglismen, that thou should me have sald.
Craufurd him said, he had been torment sair,
With Inglismen that had him at despair.
Thairfoir rise up, and sone sum succor se,
I dreid full sair they set wachis on me.
The worthy scottis yai graith yame in guide weid
Their wappinis tuik, syne of that house they eid.
Thus suddandly their feill Sutheroun yai saw,
To few they war to fecht agane them aw.
That kenely come, with ou^g Buttellar ye knicht,
Than Wallace said, ane plane land is nocht richt.
Bot Elchok Park, that is neir heir beside,
The first sail e, we think their to abide.
Nyntene they war, and Craufurd with good will,
The twenty man, the number to fulfill,
The Park they tuik, Wallace ane place hes seen,
Ot greit Holing, yat grew both heich and grene.
With thortour treis ane manner of strenth maid he
Or that war wyn, they thocht to gar feill de.
The wod was thick, bot lytill of breid and lenth,
And yai had meit, yai thocht to hald that strenth.
The Inglismen than past to Craufurdis place,
Fand in the barn the ludgeing of Wallace.
Than Craufurdis wife in handis they have taken,
And askit at her, quhat way the Scottis is gane?
Richt weill they trowit, that Wallace should yair be
Fra France to Tay, he was cu^mit throw the se.
Scho wald nocht tell for boist nor it rewaird,
Tha^ Buttellar said, ouir la^g thou hes been spaird
Their with he grew in matalent and Ire,
And gart them big ane braid byrnand fire.
The Sutheroun swore yairin scho should brynt be,
Than Wallace said scho sall nocht end for me.
Greit sin it war, one faikles wicht to sla,
Or scho should end, in faith yair sall de ma.
He left the strenth, and the plane field can ta,
On loud he cryit, and said lo heir thy fa.
Thinkis thou not schame for to torment ane wife,
Cum first to me, and make end of our strife.
Fra Buttellar had on field good Wallace seen,
For auld malice he woxe neir wod for tene.
Upon ye Scottis they schuip all with greit mane
Good Wallace sone the strenth he tuik agane.
Ane feill bikker the Inglismen began,
Assaileit sair with money cruel man.
Bot yai within war Nobill of defense,
Maid greit debait with force and violence.
At the entry fyftene they put to deid,
Than all the laif remouit fra that steid.
e^d to array, agane to sail new,
Wallace beheld, quhilk weill in weir him knew.
Fellowis he said agane all at this place,
They will nocht faill, bot thus standis the case.
one Knicht thinkis for to deuyde his men,
In Seir placis, the suith e sall weill ken.
Agane on us to preif how it may be,
Us now behouis sum other way to se.
Contrair their micht, ane good defense to make,
Now Longoueill thou sall sex with the tak:
William my Eme, als money sall with ow ga,
And live with me, as now we have na ma.
Knicht Buttellar than, partit his men in three,
Wallace vesyit quhair Buttellar schuip to be.
Thidder he yan past, that entry for to weir,
Quhilk side they did assail with greit feir.
Wallace leit part on the entry begin,
Bot nane eid out, that on the Scottis come in.
Seuin formest was that in the frount first eid,
Wallace five men that douchtie was in deid.
Ilk ane slew ane, and Wallace gart two de,
Buttellar was neist, and said yis will nocht be.
Abak he drew, and leit his curage slaik*
The worthy scottis preuit weill for scotlandes saik.
Good Longoueill his counter maid sa sair,
And Craufurd als, they saileit them na mair.
Richt neir be than approchit to mirk nicht,
And sternis to appeir, began into their sicht.
Sutheroun set wachis, and to their Supper went
The Buttellar was sair greuit in his Intent.
it fure they weill, of good stuf, aill, and breid
Wallace and his, they wist of na remeid.
Bot called watter that ran out throw ane strand,
In that ludgeing, nane other fude they fand.
Than Wallace said, good fellowis think not lang,
Will God we sall be sone out of this thrang.
Suppois we fast ane day ouir or ane nicht,
Tak all in thank, this pane for Scotlandis richt.
The Erll of ork was in Sanct Iohnstoun still
To Buttellar send, and bad him bide at will.
To him full sone yair should cum new power,
And als him self thus tauld the Messinger.
Buttellar wald fane Wallace had oldin been,
Or the Erll come, and for this cause was seen:
His Grandschir and his Father both he slew,
This Knicht yair with towart ye Park him drew
Quhat cheir they maid, upon the Scottis he called,
Than Wallace said, far better than th^w wald.
The Buttellar said, I wald fane speik with the,
Wallace answerit, thou may for lytill fe.
Wallace he said, thou hes done me greit skaith,
My Father and my Grandschir thou slew both.
Than Wallace said, for stait that thou art in,
It war my det, for to undo thy kin.
And I think als, as God of heuin me saif,
That my two handis sall graith the to thy graif.
The Buttellar said, that is nocht lyklie now,
Bot we the have, we sall gar sydis sow.
Of this I ask, and thou wald make me grant,
Quhat I the hecht, yat thing thou sall not want.
Say forth (quod he) be thy desire ressonabill,
I sall it grant, withouttin any fabill.
The Buttellar said, Wallace thou knawis richt,
Thou may not chaip, be power nor be ^licht.
And sen thou seis, it may na better be,
For thy gentrice thou wald the eild to me.
Than Wallace said thy will unskillful is,
Thou wald me do, quhilk is ouir hi^ ane mis.
oldin I am, to better I can prufe,
To quhome he askit? to the greit God abu^e.
For euerilk day, sen I had wit of man,
Befoir my werk, to eild me I began.
And als at euin, quhen yat I faileit licht,
I me betuik, to the maker of micht.
The Buttellar said, me think thou hes done weill
it of ane thing, I pray the let me feill.
For thy manheid, yis to me manifest,
Quhen that thou seis, thou may na langer lest:
On this Ilk place, quhilk I have taken to weir,
That thou cum forth, and all other forbeir.
Than Wallace leuch at his cruel desire,
And said I sall, thocht thou war wod as fire.
And all Ingland the contrary had sworn,
I sall cum out, at that Ilk place the morn.
Or ellis this nicht, traist weill yat I the say,
I bide nocht heir, quhill nine houris of the day.
Buttellar send forth, ye chak wache on Ilk side,
In that Ilk place baldly he bownit to bide.
Thus still they baid, quhill day began to peir,
Ane thick mist fell, ye Planeit was nocht cleir.
Wallace assayit, all that place about,
Leit as he wald, at any ane place brek out.
Quhill Buttellaris men away fra him couth ga,
To help the laif, quhen yai saw it was sa.
Wallace and his, fast sped them to that steid,
Quhair Buttellar baid, feill men yai draif to deid.
The worthy Scottis sone passit throw yat melle,
Craufurd their with was sair hurt in ye kne.
At eird he was, good Wallace turnit agane,
And at ane straik he hes the Buttellar slane.
Hynt up that man, under his arm sa strange,
Defendand him out of that felloun thrang.
Good room he maid, ama^g yame quhair he gais,
With his richt hand he slew five of his fais.
Bure out Craufurd be force of his persoun,
Nine aiker braid, or ever he set him down.
The Sutheroun fand, yt their Capitane was deid
Semblit him about, bot yan was na remeid.
Threttie with him, of the wichtest they brocht,
Deid on that place quhair at ye Scottis out socht
Wallace and his, be than was fra their sicht,
Sutheroun baid still for greit lois of that nicht.
The mist was mirk, that Wallace lykit weill,
Him self was glaid, and said to Longoueill:
At Methuen wod, is my desire to be,
For their is bestiall to get of greit plenty.
Be than they war, weill cu^min to the hicht,
The mist slaikit, the Sone schynit fair and bricht.
Sone war they war, ane lytill space them by,
Of four and threttie in ane cumpany.
Than Wallace said, be one friend or fa,
We will them se, sen that they ar na ma.
Quhen they come neir ane Nobill Knicht it was,
The quhilk to Name hecht Hew of Dundas.
And schir John Scot, ane wise and worthy knicht,
Into Stra^herne ane man of mekill micht.
For their he had, greit part of heritage,
Dundas Sister he had in marriage.
Passand they war, and micht na langer lest,
To Inglismen, their fewtie for to fest.
The Lord of Breichen sic cu^nand had yame maid
Of King Edward to hald their landis braid.
Bot fra they saw, that it was wicht Wallace
Held up their handis, and thankit God of grace.
Of his greit help, quhilk he had send yame yair,
To Methuen wod with ane assent they fair.
Sone gat them meit of bestiall that they fand,
Restit that day, quhe^ nicht was cu^min on hand:
To Birnane wod, but resting ar they gane,
Quhair yai have fund, ye Squyar good Ruthuane
In outlaw use he had lang leuit their,
Of bestiall, quhill he micht get na mair.
They taryit nocht, bot into Athoill eid,
Quhair meit was scant, yair Wallace had greit dreid
Passit to Lorne, richt lytill fand he their,
Of wyld and tame, that country was maid bair,
Bot in strenthis, their fude was leuit nane,
Their worthy scottis yan maid ane pieteous mane
Schir Iohne Scot said, he had far rather de
Into good name, and leif his airis fre.
Than for to bide, as bund in subiectioun,
Quhen Wallace saw their good men of Renoun:
With hunger stad, almaist micht leif na mair,
Wit e for them he sichit wounder sair.
Good men he said, I am the cause of this,
At our desire I sall amend this mis.
Or leif ow fre, sum cheuisance for to ma,
All him allane he bownit for to ga.
Prayit them bide, quhill he micht cum agane,
Out ouir ane hill he passit into plane.
OVt of their sicht, into ane Forest side,
He set him down under ane Aik to bide.
His Bow and Sword he lenit to ane tree,
In anguische, grief, on grouf sa turnit he.
This pieteous mane, was for his men sa wrocht,
That of him self, lytill thing than he rocht.
O wretch he said, that never couth be content,
Of ouir greit micht, yat ye greit God the lent.
Bot thy feirs mind, wilful and variabill,
With greit Lordschip thou couth not sa bide stabill
And wilful wit, for to make Scotland fre,
God lykis nocht, that I have taken on me.
Far worthyar than I, of birth was borne,
Throw my desire, for hounger ar forlorn.
I ask at God, them to restoir agane,
I am the cause, I should have all the pane.
Quhyle studyand yus, quhyle flyta^d with him sell,
Quhill at the last, upon s^eiping he fell.
Three dayis befoir their had him followit Five,
The quhilk was bund, or ellis to lois yair live.
The Erll of ork bad yame sa greit guardoun,
That they be thift, thocht to put Wallace down.
Three of yame was borne men of Ingland,
And two was Scottis, yat tuik ye deid on hand.
And sum men said, ye third brother betraisit,
Kyndro^me eist, quhair greit sorrow was raisit.
Ane Child yai had quhilk helpit to beir meit,
In wilderness, amang the montanis greit.
They had all seen the disseuering of Wallace,
Fra his good men, and quhair he baid on ca^e.
Amang thick wod, in covert held them law,
Quhill they persauit, he couth on sleiping faw.
And than their five, approchit Wallace neir,
Quhat best to do, at other fast they speir?
Ane man said thus, it war ane hie Renoun,
And we micht quick leid him to Sanct Iohnstou^
Lo how he lyis, we may our grippis waill,
Of his wappinis, he sall have nane auaill.
We sall him bynd in contrair of his will,
And leid him thus on bak side of one hill.
Sa that his men sall na thing of him know,
The the other four assentit to his saw.
And than their five maid them unto Wallace,
And thocht throw force to bynd him in that place.
Quhat trowit their five for to hald Wallace down?
The manlyest man, the starkest of persoun.
Leuand he was, als stude into sic richt,
We traist weill God his deidis hes in sicht.
They grippit him, and out of sleip he braid,
Quhat menis this? than sadly Wallace said.
About he turnit, and up his armis thrang,
On they tratouris with Knichtly feir he dang.
The starkest man into his hand hynt he,
And all his harnis he dang out on ane tree.
His sword he gat, sone after that he raise,
Campioun like, amang the four he gais.
Ever ane man, he gart de at ane dynt,
Quhe^ two was deid, ye the other three wald not stynt
Maid them to fle, bot than it was na bute,
Was nane leuand micht fra him pas on fute.
He followit fast, and sone to deith them brocht,
Than to the Child, sadly agane he socht.
Quhat did thou heir? ye Child with ane pail face
On kneis fell, and askit Wallace grace.
With them I was, and knew na thing yair thocht,
Into service, as they me bad I wrocht.
Quhat beiris thou their? bot meit ye Child can say,
Ga tak it up, and pas with me away.
Meit in this time is far better nor gold,
Wallace and he forth foundit on the fold,
Quhat brocht Wallace fra his enemeis bald,
Quha bot greit God, yat hes this world to hald.
He was his help in money felloun thrang,
With glaid cheir thus, unto Erne can he gang.
Both roistit flesche, yair was als breid and cheis,
To succor yame, yat was in point to leis.
And he it deillis to four men and fyftie,
Quhilk had befoir fastit ouir dayis three.
Syne tuik his part, he had fastit als lang,
Quhair hard e ever any in sic thrang.
In hounger sa sleipand and wappinles,
Sa weill recouerit, as Wallace did in cais.
Planely be force vincust his enemeis five,
Men of wit this questioun now discryue.
Withouttin glois I will tell forth my taill,
How come this meit? the fellowschip askit haill.
To their desire, Wallace na answer ald,
Quhair five was deid, he led yame forth and tald
Greitly displeisit was all that Cheualry,
To ane Chiftane they held it fantasy.
To walk allane, Wallace with sobir mude,
Sayis heirof, is cum na thing bot good.
To the Law land agane full fast they socht,
Speirit at yis Child, gif he couth wis yame ocht.
Quhair they micht best, of purueyance for to win,
Of nane he said was that country within.
Nor all about, in als far as I know,
Quhill yat e cum down to the Rannoch haw.
That Lord hes stuf, both aill, breid, and vernage,
Of King Edward he takis full mekill wage.
Than Wallace said, my self sall be our gyde,
I know that steid, about on ather side.
Throw the wyld la^d, he gydit them full richt,
To Rannoch hall he brocht them yat same nicht.
Ane wache was out, and that full sone they ta,
He was ane Scot, it he wald nocht him sla.
Bot gart him tell the manner of that place,
Thus enterit they within ane lytill space.
The et they wan, for Castle was yair nane,
Bot mud wall wicht, withouttin lyme or stane.
Wallace in haist straik up the Chalmer dure,
With his richt fuit, that stalwart was and sture.
Than they within walknit suddandly,
The Lord gat up, and mercy can him cry.
Fra time he wist that good Wallace was their,
He thankit God, syne said their wordis mair.
True man I was, and wyn aganis my will,
With Inglismen, suppois I lykit Ill.
All Scottis we are, yat in this house is now,
At our command, all baldly sall we bow.
Of our Natioun good Wallace had piety.
Tuik aithis of them, and syne meit askit he.
Good cheir yai maid, quhill licht day on ye morn,
This true man than sone semblit him beforne.
Three Sonis he had, yat stalwart war and bald,
And twenty men of kyn in his houshald.
Wallace was blyith they maid him sic supply,
Said I thank God, yat we thus multiply.
All that day ouir, in good lyking they rest,
Wachis they waill, to keip them that couth best.
Upon the morn the licht day quhen they saw,
Than Wallace said our power for to know.
We will tak field, and up our Baner raise,
In richt of Scotland, and contrair of our fais.
We will na mair now us in covert hyde,
Power to us, will sembill on Ilk side.
Than horse they get, the best that culd be their,
Towart Dunkeld the ganest way they fair.
The Bischop than gat to Sanct Iohnstoun,
The Scottis slew that was of yair Natioun.
Both pure and rich, and seruandis yat yai fand,
Left nane on life that borne was of Ingland.
The place they tuik, and maid yame weill to fair,
Of purueyance that Bischop had brocht their.
Iowellis they gat, both gold and silver bricht,
With good cheir yair five dayis Soiornit richt.
On the sext day Wallace to counsall went,
Gart call the best, and schew yame his Intent.
Na men we have to sail Sanct Iohnstoun,
Into the North, thairfoir lat make us boun.
In Ros e know good men ane strenth hes maid,
Heir yai of us, yai cum withouttin baid.
Als into Bute is good Bischop Sinklair,
Fra he get wit, he cu^mis withouttin mair.
Good westland men, of Arrane and Rauchlie,
Fra they be warnit, they will all cum to me.
Thus purpois tuik, and in the North yai ride,
Na Inglisman durst in their gait abide.
Quhome Wallace tuik, yai knew ye auld ransoun
Fra he come hame, to fle they make yame boun.
And Scottismen semblit to Wallace fast,
In awful feir out throw the land they past.
Strenthis was left, wit e all desolait,
Agane their folk na man durst make debait.
In rayit battle they raid to Abirdene,
In haill number vij. thousand than was seen.
Bot Inglismen had left the town all waist,
On euerilk side away than can them haist.
In all that land left nouther mair nor les,
Lord Bewmont tuik the sey at Buchane nes.
Throw Scotland than was manifest in plane,
The Lordis that fled, in heart was wounder fane.
The Knicht Clement of Ros come suddandly,
In Murray land, with their good Cheualry.
The house of Narne yat guide knicht weil hes taken
Slew the Capitane, and good men money ane.
Out of Murray, and Buchane land come they,
To seik Bewmont, bot he was past away.
Than their good men to Wallace passit richt,
Quhe^ Wallace saw schir Iohne Ramsay ye knicht
And other good men, that had been fra him lang,
Greit curage yan was raisit them amang.
The land he reullit, as that him lykit best,
To Sanct Iohnstoun, syne raid or yai wald rest.
The Seige of Sanct Iohnstoun.
AT euerilk port ane stalwart wache he maid,
Confermit ane Seige, and steidfastly abaid.
Bischop Sinklair in all good haist him dicht,
Come out of Bute, with semely men be sicht.
Out of the Ilis, of Rauchlie and Arrane,
Lindesay and Boyd, with good men money ane.
Adam Wallace, Barroun of Ricardtoun,
Full sadly socht to Wallace of Renoun.
At Sanct Iohnstoun baid at the Sail still,
For Sutheroun men, yai micht weill pas at will.
For in their way their durst na enemy be,
Bot fled away, be land and als be se.
About that town thus semblit they but moir,
For they had been with good Wallace befoir.
Setoun, Lawder, good Richard of Lundie,
In ane good Barge they past about the se.
In Sa^ct Iohnstoun hauin, yair ankeris have yai set
Two Inglis schippes, yai tuik withouttin let.
The taken they brynt, and stuffit the the other weill,
With artaile, and stalwart men in steill.
To keip the Port, yait should cum na vittaill,
Into the town, nor men that micht auaill.
Fra South and North, money of Scotland fled,
Left Castellis waist, feill leuit their lysis in wed.
The Sutheroun Bischop yat befoir left Dunkell,
To Londoun past, and tald Edward him sell
In Scotland yair had fallin ane greit myschance,
Than send he sone for Aymeir the Walla^ce.
And askit him, quhat than was best to do,
He hecht to pas, and tak greit gold thairto.
Into Scotland sum meanis for to make,
Aganis Wallace, on hand this can he tak.
He said he wald, undo King Edwardis Crown,
Bot gif he micht throw tressoun put him down.
King Edward hecht, quhat thing ye Wallange ba^d
He ^uld it keip, yairto he gaif his hand.
Wallange tuik leif, and into Scotland went,
To Bothwell come, syne kest in his Intent.
Quhat man their was micht best Wallace begyle
And sone he fand within ane lytill quhyle:
Schir Iohne Menteith Wallace Gossop was,
Ane Messinger Schir Aymeir hes gart pas.
Unto Schir Iohne, and sone ane tryst hes set,
At Ruglyn Kirk, their two togidder met.
Than Wallange said, Schir Iohne you knawis yis thing
Wallace agane rysis contrair ye King.
And you may hau^ quhat lordschip you will wail
And you wald wirk as I wald gi^ counsel,
one tyran haldis the Realmis at trubill both,
To thriftie men it dois full mekill skaith.
He traistis ye, you may full weill him tak,
Of this matter, I reid ane end you make.
War he away we micht at lyking Ring,
As Lordis all, and leif under ane King.
Than Menteith said, he is our Governor,
For us he baid in money felloun stour.
Nocht for him self, bot for our heritage,
To sell him thus, it war ane foull outrage.
Than Wallange said, and thou weill understood
Greit merit it war, he spillis sa mekill blude.
Of cristin men, puttis saullis into perrell,
I bynd me als, he sall be haldin haill.
As for his life and keipit in presoun,
King Edward wald have him in subiectioun.
Than Menteith thocht sa they wald keip cu^nand
He wald full fane have had him of Scotland.
Wallange saw him into ane study be,
Three thousand pund of fine gold leit him se.
And hecht he should the Lennox have at will,
Thus tressonabilly Menteith grantit their till.
Ane Obligatioun with his awin hand he maid,
Syne tuik ye gold, and Edwardis Seil sa braid
And gaif them his, quhen he his time micht se,
To tak Wallace, ouir Sulway gif him fre.
To Inglismen, be this tressonabill concord,
Schir Iohne should be of all the Lennox Lord.
Thus Wallace should in Ingland keipit be,
Sa Edward micht make Scotland to him fre.
Their couetise was ouir greit master seen,
Nane exempill takis how ane other hes been.
For couetise put in panis strange and fell,
For couetise the Serpent is in hell.
For couetise good Hector tuik the deid,
For couetise their can be na remeid.
Throw couetise good Alexander was loist,
And Julius als, for all his reif and boist.
Throw couetise deit Arthur of Britane,
For couetise, their hes deit money ane.
For couetise the tratour Gauilioun,
The flour of France he put to confusioun.
Throw couetise they poysonit good Godefray,
In Antioche, as the Author will say.
For couetise Menteith upon falls wyis,
Betraisit Wallace, yat was his Gossop thryis.
Wallange in haist, with blyith will and good heart
To Londoun past, and schew to King Edwart.
Of their contract he had far mair plesance,
Than of fine gold geuin in Balance:
Of greiter wecht than his Ransoun micht be,
Of Wallace forth it speik sum part will we.
AT Sanct Iohnstoun was at the seigeing still,
In ane morning ye Sutherou^ with guide will
Five hundredth men in armis richt Egerly,
They Ischit forth to make ane Ieopardy.
At the South Port upon Scot and Dundas,
Quhilk in yair time richt wise and worthy was.
Aganis their fais richt scharply faucht and sair,
In that counter seuin scoir to deith they bair.
it Inglismen that cruel was and kene,
Full derfly faucht* quhair douchtie deid was seen.
Fra the west et drew all the Scottis haill,
To the fechtaris, quhen yai saw nocht auaill.
Bot in agane, full fast they can them speid,
The Knicht Dundas preuit douchtie in deid.
Ouir neir the et, full bandounly he baid,
With ane good sword, full greit maistrie he maid.
Nocht wittand weill, his fellowis was him fra,
In at the et, the Sutheroun can him ta.
Unto the Erll they led him haistelie,
Quhen he him saw, he said he should nocht de.
To slay this ane, it may us lytill remeid,
He send him forth, to Wallace in that steid,
Unto the North his battellis hes he brocht,
Quhill he him saw, of this he wist richt nocht.
Send to the Erll, and thankit him largely,
Hecht for to quyte, quhen he sic cause micht se.
Bot it yairfoir, souerance he wald nocht grant,
Thocht they war oldin, and cum recryant.
For gold nor good he wald na tribute tak,
Ane greit assault, than he began to make.
The Erll of Fyfe, dwelt under trewis lang,
Of King Edward, and than he thocht it wrang.
That Wallace sa was seigand Sanct Iohnstoun
Bot gif he come in richt help of the Crown.
To Inglismen he wald nocht keip that band,
Than he come sone, with good men of the land.
And Iohne Wallange was yan Schiref of Fyfe,
To Wallace past, and starkit him in that strife.
The Erll was cu^min of good true Nobill blude,
Of ye auld Thane, quhilk in his time was good.
Than all about to Sanct Iohnstoun yai gang,
The felloun sault, was hiddeous, schairp and strange.
Full feill faggaldis, into the dyke they cast,
Haddir and hay, wound about flaikis fast.
With treis and eird, ane greit passage yai maid,
Out ouir the wallis, they eid in battle braid.
The Sutheroun than, maid greit defense agane,
Quhil at the wallis their was ane thousand slane
Wallace eid in, and his rayit battle richt,
All Sutheroun men derfly to deith yai dicht.
To saif the Erll, Wallace the Herald send,
Good Iop him self, the quhilk befoir him kend:
For Dundas saik, he said he should nocht de,
Wallace him self, thus ordanit for to be.
Ane small Haiknay to him he gart be tak,
Silver and gold, his coistis for to make
Set on his cloik, ane takin for to se,
Ane Lyoun in wa^e, that should his Conduct be.
Conuoyit him forth, and na man him with all,
Women and barnis, Wallace gart freith yame all.
And syne cryit true Scottis to their awin,
Pleneist ye la^d, quhilk lang had been ouirthrawin
Than Wallace past, the south land for to se,
Edward the Bruce in his time richt worthy.
That eir befoir he had in Ireland been,
And their with him cruel men and kene.
Fyftie in feir, was of his motheris kin,
At Kirkcudbricht in Galloway enterit in.
With they fyftie, he had vincust nine scoir,
And syne he past withouttin tarry moir.
To Wigtoun sone, and that Castle hes taken,
Sutheroun was fled, and left it all allane.
Wallace him met, with true men reverently,
To Lochmabane, went all that Cheualrie.
They maid Edward both Lord and leidar yair,
This conditioun Wallace him maid but mair.
Bot ane schort time to bide Robert the King,
Gif he come nocht in this Regioun to Ring:
That Edward should ressaif the Crown but faill,
This hecht Wallace, and all the barnage haill.
In Lochmabane Prince Edward leyndit still,
And Wallace past to Cumnok with good will.
At the Blak bog, quhair he was wount to be,
Upon that steid ane Royal house held he.
Inglis Wardanis to Londoun past but mair,
And tauld the King of all their greit mysfair.
How Wallace can Scotland fra them reduce,
And how he had, ressauit Edward Bruce.
The Commounis swore yai should cum never mair,
Upon Scotland, and Wallace leuand wair.
Than Edward wrait to Menteith priualy,
Prayit him to haist, the time was passit by.
Of the promeis, ye quhilk yat he was bundin,
Schir Iohne Menteith, into his wit hes fundin:
How he should best his purpois do fulfill,
His Sister sone in haist he callit him till.
And ordanit him in dwelling with Wallace,
Ane aith agane he gart him make on case.
Quhat time he wist, Wallace in quiet draw,
He should him warn, quhat adventure micht faw.
This man grantit, that sic thing should be done,
With Wallace thus, he was in service sone.
Bot of tressoun Wallace had lytill thocht,
His lauborous mind in other materis wrocht.
Thus Wallace thryis, hes maid all Scotland fre,
Than he desyrit in lestand piece to be.
For as of weir he was in sum part Irk,
He purpoisit than to serve God and the Kirk.
And for to leif under his richteous King,
That he desyrit atouir all eirdly thing.
How Wallace was betraisit be Schir John of Menteith, and had in Ingland, and
Martyrit their. Cap. v.
THe Herald Iop, in Ingland sone he send,
And wrait to Bruce richt hartly his commend
Beseikand him, to cum and tak his Crown,
Nane should ganestand, Clerk, Burges, nor Barrou^
The Herald past, quhen Bruce saw his credance,
Thairof he tuik, ane perfyte greit plesance.
With his awin hand, agane wrait to Wallace,
And thankit him of lawtie and kyndnes.
Beseikand him, this matter to conceill,
For him behouit, out of Ingland to steill.
For lang befoir was keipit the Ragment,
Quhilk Cumyng had, to bide the Parliament.
Into Londoun, and gif they him accuse,
To cum fra them, he should make sum excuse.
He prayit Wallace, on Glasgow mure to waik,
The nixt first nicht of Iulij for his saik.
And bad he should, bot into quiet be,
For he with him, micht bring few Cheualrie.
Wallace was blyith, quhen he this writing saw,
His houshald sone, he gart to Glasgow draw.
That month their, he ordanit them to bide,
Keirly he tuik, Ilk nicht with him to ride.
And this oung man yat Menteith to him send,
Wist nane bot yir, quhat way yat Wallace wend.
The quhilk gart warn his Eme the xviij. nicht,
Sextie full sone, Schir John Me^teith gart dicht.
Of his awin kyn, and allya was borne,
To this tressoun he gart yame all be sworn.
Fra Dunbertane yai sped them haistely,
Neir Glasgow Kirk they buskit yame privily.
Wallace past forth quhair yat ye tryst was set,
Ane spy they maid, and followit him but let.
Robert Railstoun, was neir the way beside,
And bot ane house quhair Wallace vsit to bide.
He woik on fuit, quhill passit was mydnicht,
Keirly and he, than for ane s^eip yame dicht.
They bad this man, that he should walk his part,
And walkin Wallace, come men fra any art.
Quhen they sleipit, yis tratour tuik good h^id,
He met his Eme, and bad him have na dreid.
On sleip he was, and with him bot ane man,
e may him have, for any craft he can.
Without the house, their wappinnis laid yame fra
For weill they wist, gat Wallace ane of tha.
And on his feit, his Ransoun should be sauld,
Thus semblit they about that febill hauld.
This tratour wa^he fra Wallace than he stall,
Both knyfe and sword, his bow and arrowis all.
After mydnicht in handis they have him taken,
Slomerit on sleip, with him na man bot ane.
Keirly they tuik, and led him fra that place,
Did him to deith, withouttin langer space.
They thocht to bynd, Wallace with stre^this stra^g
On fuit he gat, they fell tratouris amang.
He grippit about, bot na wappin he fand,
Upon ane Sill he saw beside him stand:
The bak of ane he bristit in that thrang,
And of ane other the harnis our he dang.
And als money as handis couth on him lay,
Be force him hynt, for to have him away.
Bot that power ane fuit micht nocht him leid,
Out of that house, quhill yai or he war deid.
Schir Iohne saw weill, be force it couth not be,
Or he war taken, erar he thocht to de.
Menteith bad ceis, and thus spak to Wallace,
Syne schew him forth, ane full richt subtell case.
e have sa lang heir vsit ow, allane,
Quhill wit thairof is into Ingland gane.
Thairfoir heir me, and sober our curage,
The Inglismen with ane full greit barnage:
Ar semblit heir, and set this house about,
That e be force, on na wayis may wyn out.
Suppois e had the strenth of good Hector,
Amang this Oist, e may nocht lang Endure.
And they ow tak in haist our deith is dicht,
I have spokin with Lord Cliffurd that Knicht.
With their Chiftane, weill menit for our life,
They ask na mair, bot be quyte of our strife.
To Dunbartane e sall pas forth with me,
In our awin house, e may in saiftie be.
Sutheroun sic use with Menteith lang had they,
That Wallace trowit, sum part that he wald say.
Menteith said Schir, lo wappinis we name haif,
We come in traist, our life gif we micht saif.
Wallace trowit weill, and he his Gossop thryis,
That he wald nocht be na manner of wyis:
Him do betrais, for all Scotland sa wide,
Ane aith of him* he askit in that tide.
Their wantit wit, quhat should his aithis moi^,
Forsworn to him, he was lang time befoir.
The aith he maid, Wallace come in his will,
Richt fraudfully all thus he schewit him till.
Gossop he said, as Presoner yai mon ow se,
Or yan throw force, yai will tak ow fra me.
Ane Courche with slicht upon his handis yai laid,
And under syne with sicker cordis they braid.
Both schairp and teuch, and fast togidder drew,
Allace the Bruce, micht fair that bynding rue.
Quhilk maid Scotland sone brokin upon case,
For Cumyngis deith, and lois of good Wallace.
They led him forth in feir amang them aw,
Keirly he mist, and na Sutheroun he saw.
Than wist he weill, that he betraissit was,
Towart the South with him quhen yai can pas.
it they him said, in trenth he should nochc de,
King Edward wald, him keip in good saiftie.
For the honor in weir that he had wrocht,
The sair bandis sa trublit all his thocht.
Credence thairto forsooth he couth nocht geif,
He wist full weill, they wald nocht lat him leif.
Ane falls foull cais yat Menteith hes him sald,
Quhen on this wise good Wallace he was called.
Sum men sayis it was to saif his Lord,
They leid all out, that maid that falls record.
At the Fawkirk the good Stewart was slane,
Our Chronicklis, reheirsis that in plane.
On Magdalene day the xviij. eir befoir,
Cumyngis deith thairfoir it witnessis moir.
At Restoun Wallace was tressonabilly,
Thus falsely stollin fra his good Cheualry.
In Glasgow lay, and wist nocht of this thing,
Thus he was loist in byding of his King.
South they him led, ay haldand the waist land,
Deliuerit him in haist ouir Sulway sand.
The Lord Cliffurd, and Wallange tuik him their
To Carleill town, full fast with him they fair.
In Presoun him set, that was ane greit dolor,
That house after, they callit Wallace Tour.
Sum men syne said, yat knew not weill ye case,
In Berwik town, to deith they put Wallace.
Contrair is knawin, be this opinioun,
For Scottismen than had all Berwik town.
To Scotland fre, until yat Soullis it gaif,
For Lord Cumyng to Ingland with the laif.
Ane other point is, the tratouris durst nocht pas,
That sauld him sa, quhair scottismen master was.
The third point is, ye commounis of Ingland,
Quhat they deny, they will nocht understand.
That thing be done, for witness that may be,
Na credence gif farther nor yai may se.
To se him de Edward had mair desire,
Than to be Lord of all the haill Empire.
And for this cause they keipit him sa lang,
Quhill ye commounis micht unto Londoun ga^g.
Allace Scotland, to quhome sall thou co^plene?
Allace fra pane, quha sall the now refrene?
Allace thy help, is fastly brocht to ground,
The best Chiftane in braith bandis is bund.
Allace thou hes now loissit thy gyde of licht,
Allace quha sall defend the in thy richt?
Allace thy pane approchit wounder neir,
With sorrow sone, thou man be left on steir.
Thy gracious gyde, thy greitest Governor,
Allace ouir neir is cum thy fatal hour.
Allace quha sall now beit the of thy baill?
Allace quhen sall of harmis thou be haill?
Quha sall defend? quha sall the now make fre?
Allace in weir, quha sall thy helper be?
Quha sall the keip? quha sall the now redeem?
Allace quha sall the Saxonis fra the fleme?
I can na mair, bot beseik God of grace,
The to restoir, in haist to wealth and piece,
Sen good Wallace may succor the na mair,
The lois of him Incressis mekill cair.
Now of his men, in Glasgow still that lay,
Quhat sorrow raise, quhen they missit him away.
The cruel pane, the woeful complening,
Thairof to tell it war ouir heavy thing.
I will lat be, and speik thairof na mair,
Lytill reheirs is ouir mekill of cair.
And principally quhair redemptioun is nane,
It helpis nocht, to tell their pieteous mane.
The deith yairof is it in remembrance,
I will lat slaik of sorrow the balance.
Bot Longoueill to Lochmabane can pas,
and yair hecht he quhair good prince Edward was
Out of Scotland he should pas never mair,
Lois of Wallace socht to his heart sa ^air.
The Realm of France he vowit never to se,
Bot avenge Wallace, or ellis yairfoir to de.
Their he remanit quhill cu^ming of the King,
With Bruce in weir, yis guide knicht forth did ring
Remembrance syne is in the Brucis Buik,
Secund he was, quhe^ yai Sanct Iohnstou^ tuik.
Followit the King at wynning of the town,
The Bruce thairfoir, gaif him full greit guardoun
All Charteris landis ye good King to him gaif
Charteris sen syne of his kyn is the laif.
Quhairto should I far in this Story wend,
B^t of my buik to make ane final end.
Robert the Bruce come hame on the third day,
In Scotland after, that Wallace was had away.
To Lochmabane, quhair he fand good Edwart,
Quhairof he was, greitly reioysit in heart.
Bot fra he wist, Wallace away was led,
Sa mekill baill into his breist was bred.
Neir out of wit he worthit for to weid,
Edward full sone yan to his brother eid.
Ane suddand chance this was in wa fra weill,
Good Edward sayis yis helpis nocht adeill.
Lat murning be, it may be na remeid,
e have him tynt, e should Revenge his deid.
Bot for our cause, he tuik the weir on hand,
In our defense, and thryis hes fred Scotland.
The quhilk was tynt, fra us and all our kyn.
War nocht Wallace, we had never enterit in.
Myrrour he was, of lawtie and manheid,
In weir the best, that ever sall power leid.
Had he lykit, for to have taken our Crown,
Wald nane him let, yat was in this Regioun.
Had nocht been he, e should had na entres,
Into this Realm for tressoun and falsnes.
That sall e se, the tratour that him sald,
Fra ow he thinkis, Dunbartane for to hald.
Sum comfort tak, and lat slaik of this sorrow,
The King chargit Edward upon the morrow.
Redres to tak of wrang yat wrocht him was,
To Dalswyntoun he ordanit him to pas.
And men of armis, gif yai fand Cumyng their,
Put him to deith, for na dreid they should spair.
They fand him nocht, the King him after s^ew,
Into Drumfreis, quhai^ witness was anew.
That hapnit wrang, ouir greit haist in ane King,
To wirk by law, it may skaith mekill thing.
I neid nocht heir na farther for to schaw,
How that was done, is knawin to ow aw.
BOt oung Douglas first to the King ca^ pas,
In all his weir, yat wicht and worthy was.
Nor how ye King hes taken on him ye Croun,
Of all that heir I mas bot schort mentioun.
Nor how Lord Sou^is gaif Berwik town away
How after sone tynt was Galloway.
How Iohne of Lorne agane his richt King raise,
On ather side how Bruce had money fais.
How bald Breichen contrair his King couth ride,
Richt few was than in weir with him to bide.
Nor how the North was geuin fra the good King
Quhilk maid him lang, in panefull weir to Ring.
Bot true to him, was James ye good Douglas
For Brucis richt, ba^d weill in money place.
Under the King he was the best Chiftane.
Bot Wallace I set ane Chiftane him allane.
Thairfoir to him is na comparisoun,
As of ane man, saif reverence of the Crown.
Bot sa money as of the Douglas hes been,
Good of all thing, was never in Scotland seen.
Comparisounis I can nocht weill declair,
Of Brucis Buik, as now I speik na mair.
Master Iohne Harbor, quhilk was ane worthy Clerk
He said the Bruce amang his other week.
In this matter I am prolixt all may*
To my purpois briefly I will me haist.
How good Wallace was set amang his fais*
To Londoun with him Cliffurd and Wallange gais
Quhair King Edward was richt fane of ye fang,
They have him set richt in ane Presoun strange.
Of Wallace end my self wald leif for dreid,
To say the werst, bot richteousnes me leid.
We find his life was all sa verray true,
His fatal hour I will nocht fene now.
Menteith him sauld, and yat ouir weill was knawin
Feill of that kyn, in Scotland yan was sawin.
Chargit to bide under the greit Judgment,
That King Robert actit in his Parliament.
Thairof I make na langer continewance,
Bot Wallace end in world was displesance.
Thairfoir I ceis, and puttis it nocht in Ryme,
Scotland may thank the blyssit happy time:
That he was borne, be principal pointis two,
This is the first, or that we farther ga.
Scotland he fred, and brocht it fra thirllage,
And now in heuin he hes his herberage.
As it is preuit be good experiance,
Wise Clerkis it hes it in remembrance.
Because that the mair part of their thingis followand, as altogidder
superstitious and not agreabill to ye treuth of Goddis word, we have thocht it
expedient to admonische the (good Reidar) that albeit we have Insert yame after
the form of our Copy, it notwithstanding we do na thing les than allow or
appru^e tham^ for any treuth, bot rather on the ane part we have retenit them
still to schaw the blyndnes and error of that time, quhairin me^ were (as it
were) enforcit to belief sic vaniteis and leis: yat now that may be steirit up
to gif thankis to the Eternal our God that hes oppinnit their eyis and
deliuerit yame from Ignorance, yat yai may cleirly discern betuix licht and
mirknes, richt and wrang. On the other part to satisfy the appetytis of money
that culd nocht esely permit any thing to be taken away or alterit in this wark,
quhair in we have borne with them, alterand almaist na thing heirin, lest they
should Judge us rasche or haistie in doing thairof, at our liberty and pleasure.
HOw that ane Monk of Bury Abbay than,
Into that time ane richt Religious man.
Ane ou^g man als, with him in ordour stude
Quhilk knew his life, was clean, perfyte, and good.
This Father Monk was vesyit with seiknes,
Out of the world, as he should pas on cais.
His brother saw, his spreit lyklie to pas,
Ane band of him, richt ernestly couth he as.
To cum agane, and schaw him of the meid,
That he should ask of God for his good deid.
He grantit him, at his power to preif,
And cum agane, gif God wald gif him leif.
His spreit changit out of yis warldis pane,
In that same time come to the Monk agane.
Sic thing hes been, and is be voce and sicht,
Quhair he appeirit, yair schynit mekill licht.
Like to Lanternis, that Illuminit sa cleir,
That warldly licht thairto micht be na peir.
Ane voce said thus, God hes me grantit grace,
That I sall keip my promeis in this place.
The Monk was blyith of this clean figure fair,
Bot ane fire brand in his foirheid he bair.
And yat him thocht mislydst all the laif,
Quhair art thou spreit* answer sa God the saif.
In Purgatory how lang sall thou be their?
Bot half ane hour, to cum, and lytill mair.
Purgatory is, I lat the weill to wit,
In any place quhair God will it commit.
Ane houris space I was yair Iudgit to be,
And that passis suppois I speik with the.
Quhy hes thou that, and all the laif sa haill?
For of science, I thocht me may of vaill.
Quha prydis yairin yair laubour is in waist,
For science cu^mis bot of the haly Gaist.
After thy hour, quhatis thy passage euin?
Quhen time cu^mis, he said to lest and heuin.
Quhat time is that? I pray ow now declair,
Two ar on life, man be befoir me their.
Quhilk two ar they? the verity me ken,
The first hes been ane greit slayer of men.
Now yai him keip, to Martyr in Londoun town,
On Wednisday, befoir King and Commoun.
Is nane on life, that hes sa money slane,
Brother he said, that taill is bot in vane.
For slauchter is to God abhominabill,
Than said the spreit, forsooth this is na fabill.
He is Wallace defender of Scotland.
For richteous weir, that he tuik upon hand.
Their richteousnes is luiffit ouir the laif,
Thairfoir in heuyn he sall that honor haif.
Syne ane pure Priest, is mekill to commend,
He tuik in thank, quhat thing that God him send.
For godlynes, and good deuotioun,
Heuin he sall have to lest and warysoun.
I am the third, grantit throw Goddis grace,
Brother he said, tell I this in our place,
They will bot deem, I outher dreme or raif,
Than said the Spreit, this witness you sall haif.
The bellis sall ring for ocht that e do may,
Quhen they him slay, half ane hour of the day.
And sa they did, ye Monk wist quhat yai a^^i^t,
Throw braid Bertane ye word yairof was scailli^
The spreit tuik leif, at Goddis will to be,
Of Wallace end, to heir is greit piety.
ANd I wald nocht put men in greit dolor,
Bot lichtly pas, out ouir this fatal hour.
On Wednisday yi^ falls Sutheroun forth brocht,
To martyr him, as they befoir had wrocht.
Wallace was Martyrit, ye suith to ow to tell,
As were Oswald, Edmond, Edward, with panis tell.
Of men in armis led him ane full greit rout,
With ane bald spreit Wallace blent about.
Ane Priest he askit, for him that deit on tree,
King Edward than commandit his Clergy,
And said I charge, in pane of lois of life,
Nane be sa bold one tyran for to schryfe.
He hes rung lang incontrair of my hienes,
Ane blissit Bischop sone present in that place.
Of Canterbery he than was richteous Lord,
Aganis the King he maid this richt record.
And said my self sall heir his Confessioun,
Gif I have micht, incontrair of thy Crown.
Or thou throw force sall stop me fra this thing,
I vow to God quhilk is my richteous King:
Or all Ingland I sall than Interdyte,
And make it knawin thou art ane Heretyke.
The Sacrament of Kirk I sall him geif,
Syne tak thy chois to sterf or lat him leif.
It war mair vaill in worschip of thy Crown,
To keip sic ane on life in thy bandoun.
Than all the land and good yat thou hes re^t,
Bot couetise ye ay fra honor dre^t.
Thou hes thy life rung in all wrangous deid,
That sall be seen, on the or on thy seid.
The King gaif charge they should the Bischop ta,
Bot wise Lordis counsallit to lat him ga.
All wise men said, yat his desire was richt,
To Wallace than he raikit in their sicht.
And sadly hard his Confessioun to end,
Humbly to God his spreit he did commend.
Lawly him seruit with hartly deuotioun,
Upon his kneis, and said ane Orisoun.
His leif he tuik, and to Westmynster raid,
The Cleuch men than yai buir Wallace but baid,
Unto ane place, his martyrdom to tak,
For to his deith he will na furthering make.
Fra the first nicht he was taken in Scotland,
They keipit him into that samin band.
Na thing he had that hes done him good,
Bot Inglismen him seruit of cairfull fude.
This warldly life desyris the sustenance,
Thocht he it gat incontrair of plesance.
They threttie dayis his bandis yai durst not flaik
Quhill he was bund on ane Scamyll of Aik.
With Irne cheineis, that war both stark and kene,
Ane Clerk they set to heir quhat he wald mean.
Thou Scot he said, yat sa greit wrang hes done,
Thy fatal hour, thou seis approchis sone.
Thou should in mind remember thy mysdeid,
That Clerkis may, quhen yai yair Psalms reid:
For Cristin saullis, yat makis them to pray,
In their number, you may be ane of they.
For now thou seis, on force thou man deceis,
Than Wallace said, for all thy round reheirs:
Thou hes na charge, suppois I had done mys,
one blissit Bischop hes hecht I sall have blys.
And I trow weill, that God sall it admit,
Thy simulate wordis, sall not my conscience smit.
Comfort I have, of way that I should gang,
May pane I feill, that I bide heir sa lang.
Than said this Clerk, our King often send the till,
Thou micht have had, all Scotland at thy will,
To hald of him, and ceissit of thy strife,
Sa as ane Lord, to rungin forth thy life.
Than Wallace said, thou speikis of michty thing,
Had I lestit, and gottin my richteous King,
Fra worthy Bruce had ressauit his Crown,
I thocht haif maid Ingland at his bandoun.
That utterly should have been at his will,
Quhat pleisit him, to saif thy King or spill.
Weill said the Clerk, I se thou repentis nocht,
Of wickitnes, thou hes ane felloun thocht.
Is nane in world, that hes sa money ^lane,
Thairfoir to ask, me think thou should be bane,
Grace at our King, and syne at his barnage,
Than Wallace smylit, ane lytill at his langage.
I grant he said, sum Inglismen I slew,
In my querrell, me thocht nocht half anew.
I muifit na weir, bot for to win our awin,
Both God and man ye richt full weill hes knawin
Thy frustrat wordis dois nocht bot tyris me,
I the command of Goddis Name let me be.
Ane Schiref gart this Clerk sone fra him pas,
Richt as they durst, grantit quhat he wald as.
Ane Psalter Buik Wallace had on him ever,
Fra his Chyldheid, with it he wald nocht sever.
The better he trowit in veyage for to speid,
Bot than he was dispuileit of his weid.
This grace he askit at Lord Cliffurd that Knicht,
To lat him have his Psalter buik in sicht.
He gart ane Priest it oppin befoir him hald,
Quhill they to him, had done quhat yat yai wald,
Steidfast he red, for ocht they did him their,
Feill Sutheroun said, that Wallace feld na sair.
Good deuotioun sa was his beginning,
Continewit yair with, and swa was his ending.
Quhill speiche and Spreit atanis all can fair,
To lestand blys, we trow for ever mair.
I will nocht tell how he deuydit was,
In five partis, and ordanit for to pas.
it his spreit thus, be lyklines was weill,
Of Wallace life quha hes ane better ^eill.
May schew forth mair, with writ and eloquence,
For I to this hes done my diligence.
After the Prose geuin fra the Latin buik,
Quhilk Master Blair in his time under tuik.
In fair Latin compylit to ane end,
With good witness, the mair is to commend.
Bischop Sinklair than Lord was of Dunkell,
He gat this Buik, and confirmit it him sell.
For verray treuth, thairof he had na dreid,
Him self hard greit part of Wallace deid.
His purpois was to have send it to Rome,
Our Father of Kirk yairin to gif his dome.
Bot Master Blair, and als schir Thomas Gray,
After Wallace they leuit money ane day.
Their two knew best of good schir Williamis deid
Fra sextene eir, quhill nine and twenty eid.
Forty and five Wallace of age was called,
That time yat he was to the Sutheroun sald.
Thocht this matter be nocht to all plesance,
His suithfast deid is worthy to auance.
All worthy men, that reidis this rural dyte,
Blame nocht the buik, thocht I be Imperfyte.
I should have thank, sen I na travel spaird,
For my travel na man hecht me rewaird.
Na charge I had, of King nor other Lord,
Greit harm I thocht his good deid should be smord
I have said heir, neir as the process gais,
And feneit nocht, for freindis nor it for fais.
For coistis heirof, was na man bund to me,
In this sentence, I had na will to le.
Bot in als mekill, as I reheirsit nocht,
Sa worthily as Nobill Wallace wrocht.
Bot in ane point, I grant, I said ane mis,
Their two Knichtis should blamit be of this.
The Knicht Wallace of Cragy richteous Lord,
And Lyddaill als, gart me make wrang record.
On Allartoun mure, ye Crown he tuik ane day,
To get battle, as mine Author will say.
Their two gart me say on ane other wise,
To Master Blair, we did part of suppryse.
GO Nobill buik fulfillit of sentence,
Suppois thou be barrane of eloquence.
Go worthy buik, fulfillit of worthy deid,
Bot the to help, of langage thou hes neid.
Quhen good makeris rang weill in to Scotland,
Greit harm it was, that nane of them the fand.
it their is part, that can the weill auance,
Now bide the time, and be in remembrance.
I ow beseik of our benevolence,
Quha will nocht loif, lak nocht my eloquence.
It is weill knawin I am ane Rural man,
And heir hes done, als gudely as I can.
My tongue did never ornate termis embrace,
I beseik God that geuar is of grace:
Maid hell and eird, and set ye heuin abufe,
That he till us grant, his deir lestand lufe.
Thus endit Williame Wallace the wicht,
Behind him left nocht sic ane Knicht.
Be worthynes, and deid of hand,
Fra thraldom thryis he fred this land.
Imprentit at Edinburgh be Robert Lekpreuik at the Expensis of Henry
Charteris, and ar to be sauld in his Buith, on the North side of ye gait abone
the Throne. Anno. Do. M.D.LXX.
