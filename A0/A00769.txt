A sermon had at Paulis by the commandment of the most reverend father in god
my lord legate / and said by John^ the bishop of Rochester / upon
qui^quagesom sunday / concerning certain heretics / which tha^ were
abiured for holding the heresies of Martyn Luther that famous heretic / and
for ye keeping and reteynyng of his books against the ordinance of the bulle of
pope Leo the tenthe.

Cu^ priuilegio a rege indulto.



First here follows an Epistole unto the reder by the same bishop.
My dear brother or sister in our savior Christ Jesu / who so ever ye be / yt
shall fortune to read this queare our lord for his great mercy grant you his
grace / that the redyng thereof some what may proffit your soul.

First I shall beseech you not to misconstrue mine intent / in puttyng forth
this queare to be printed / but that ye take it to the best. For verily my will
and mind is / that some fruit might rise by the same unto the christian people
/ which be the spouse of Christ. Unto whom (though unworthy) I am ordained a
minister for my little portion. My duty is to endeuer me after my pour power /
to resist these heretics / the which seasse not to subuett the church of
Christ. If we shall sit still and let them in every place sow their
ungracious heresies / and every where distroye the soulis / which were so
derely bought with that most precious blood of our savior Christ Jesu / how
terribly shall he lay this until our charge / when we shall be called until a
reckoning for this matter? It shall be much rebukefull and much worthy
punishment / if we for our party shall not give diligence for the defense of
the true christen people / fro these heresies / as these heretics give for
the corruption of the same / specially when we be certain / that our labor
shall not be unrewarded / as saint Paul does promise / saying / Vnusquisque
propriam mercedem accipiet secu^du^ suum laborem: Every 1. Cor^. 3.
man shall take his own reward according to his labor. And so much the
more diligence we must give / because that the wretched nature of man is more
prone to every thing / that naught is / than it is to that / which is of
greatter fruit. The dry tender is not more ready to be kendled with the least
sparkell of fire / than we be ready to be incensed to all evil. Our hearts by
the old corruption of sin / be of that molde / that they withoute^ any great
diligence of them self / bring for the all manner of vices: but nothing that
virtuous is / withouten a great labor. And assuredly these herelies be like
the stynkynge weeds / the which i^ every earth spring by them self: for as
these evil weeds need no setting / no sowynge / no waterynge / no wedynge /
nor such other deligence / as the good herbs require / but spring anon
withouten all that business: and where they have enteres ones in any ground /
it is very herd to deliver that ground from them: even so it is of these
heresies / they need no plantynge / they need no wateryng / they need no
lowkyng / nor wedyng / but rankly spring by them self / of a full light
occasion. Contrary wise it is of true doctrine of god / this is like unto the
good herbs / which will not every where lightly grow / but they must be set
or sown in a chosen earth / they must be watered / they must be weded / and
have much attendaunce / orels they will anon myscary. Ye may se this
evidently by the beginning of Christis church. Our savior when he him self
did sow his doctrine / he complained of the untowardness of men's hearts / and
said: Sermo meus Jo. ^.
non capit in vobis: This sede of my word takes no rote in the earth of your
hearts. And upon a time a great nombre of his disciples forsook him and cast
him up: For their hearts could not savor his doctrine. If this doctrine sown
by this most mighty and counnynge sower / took none effect in these persons
hearts / ye may se / that the erth^ of our hearts by it self can not receive
this sed^* Saint Paul / the which in like manner gave his diligence to plant
and to water this sede / yet as much as he proffitted by his preaching in one
place / he lost by his abse^ce in an other place. Does he not cry out therefore
upon ye Galathes / because that this doctrine / which he had sown among them
/ sone after his deperture from them / did wyther in their hearts? O insensati
Galathe / quis ^a^. ^.
vos fascinauit no^ obedire veritati? O ye folishe people / who has thus
witched you / that ye do not obey unto the troth? And every where the same
saint Paul fights against the heretics / and is very solicit and
careful / lest the flock of Christ shall be corrupted by their heresies. In so
much yt he says unto ye Corinthies: Timeo / ne sicut serpe^s ^. Cor^ ^1.
Euam seduxit astucia sua / ita sensus vestri corrumpantur a simplicitate / que
est in Christo: I dread me / lest as the serpent desceyued the first woman Eve
by his wylynes / so your senses shall be corrupted by these heretics / and so
fall from the symplicite of faith / which ye have in Christ. And therefore a
litel after he calls them / Pseudo apostolos / and operarios subdolos ^. Cor^
11.
tra^sfigura^tes se i^ apostolos Christi. that is to say / falls apostles /
disceytful workers / prete^dyng to be the messangers of Christ / and be not in
very deed. If there were such peril of heretics in the time of saint Paul
/ as it does appear in all his epistoles: and if ye heresies tha^ so lightly
took root in ye hearts of men: And if the sede of the doctrine of Christ with
such difficulty did spring and grow in the hearts of the people / which
were in that marvelous and plentuous time of all grace: What wonder is it that
likewise now / in this miserable time / these heretics multiply / and their
heresies do sprede? When hit was prophesied before not only by our savior
Christ / but also by saint Peter in his epistoles / and by saint Paul in his
both / and by saint Jude / that such heresies should rise / and specially
toward the end of the world. Now therefore when so litell diligence is done
about the ministryng of this true doctrine / it is necessary that all tho that
have charge of the flock of Christ / endeavor them self to gaynestande these
pernicious heresies. Wherein doutles the most Reverend father in god my lord
legate has now meritoriously traueiled / and so entendeth to persevere and to
continue / to the full extirpatio^ of the same. For heresy is a perilous wede
/ it is the sede of the devil / the inspiration of the wicked spirits / the
corruption of oux hearts / the blyndyng of our sight / the quenching of our
faith / the destruction of all good fruit / and finally the mourder of our
souls. And therefore some what to resist this wicked sede / by the mocion of
diverse persons / I have put forth this sermon to be read / which for ye
great noise of ye people within ye church of Paul's / when it was said /
might not be herd. And if paraue^ture any disciple of Luthers shall think /
that mine arguments and reasons against his master be not sufficient: First
let him consider / that I did shape them to be spoken until a multitude of
people / which were not brought vp^^ ^^btyll disputations of the schole.
Second. if it may like the same disciple to come unto me secretly / and
break his mind at more length / I bind me by these presents / both to keep
his secreasy / and also to spare a leysoure for him to here the bottum of his
mind / and he shall here mine again / if it so please him: and I trust in our
lord / that finally we shall so agree / that either he shall make me a Luthera^
/ orels I shall enduce him to be a catholyke / and to follow the doctrine of
Christis church. And one thing I do acertayne him / that though his master
Luther dydlyue never so well and perfetly / yet for as much as his doctrine is
diverse from the doctrine of the church he is to be fled: for so teaches us
ye holy mertyr Ignacius in his epistole ad Hereneum / saying: Omnis igitur qui
dixerit preter ea / que tradita sunt / tametsi fide dignus sit / tametsi
ieiunet / tametsi virginitate^ seruet / tametsi signa faciat / tametsi
prophetet / supus tivi appareat in grege ouium / corruptionem faciens. That is
to say / who so ever affermeth contrary to the traditions and doctrine of ye
church / though he for his life be worthy to be believed / though he fast never
so much / though he keep his virginite / though he work miracles though he
prophecy of things for to come / for all this take him but as a wolf /
intending corruption among a flock of sheep. Wherefore when Luther has in
him none of these good conditions above rehearsed / as we shall prove here after
/ that is to say / he neither is faith worthy / because of his repugnant
doctrine / nor he chastises not his body by fasting / nor he keeps not his
virginite / nor he does no miracles / nor he is no prophet of things for to
come / and yet nevertheless he techeth clean contrary doctrynes unto the
doctrine of the church / he is to be reputed as a wolf corruptyng the flock
of Christ. Thus fare ye well in our lord Jesu.

Respice / fides tua te saluum fecit.
THese words ben written in ye gospel / read in the church this quinquagesime
sunday. They may thus be englis shed. Open thyn eyes / thy faith has made the
safe. In this gospel saint Luke tells a miracle / ye which our savior did
show upon a blind man. He says / that a blind man sitting nigh to the way
/ herd a noise of people passing forby / and enquired what that was. It was
told him / that Jesus of Nazareth passed yt way. He gave faith unto this
word / and cried for mercy / saying: Jesu the son of David have mercy upon
me. Part of this people went before our savior in ye way / and part came
after him. They that went before (as the gospel says) rebuked the blind man /
and he much rather cried for mercy / saying: The son of David have mercy upon
me. Our savior sta^dyng / commanded this man to be brought unto him. And when
he was brought to his presence / our savior asked him what he would. O sir
said this man / that I might have my sight again. Than did our savior this
miracle upon him / and said these words above rehearsed: Respice / fides tua te
saluum fecit: Open thyn eyes / thy faith has made ye safe. And forth with this
bly^de man was restored to his sight / and followed our savior in the way with
the other people.

By this word and other such / Martyn Luther has taken occasion of many
great errors: where by he has blinded many a christen soul / and brought them
out of the way / saying / that only faith does justify us / and suffiseth to
our salvation. Whereby many one litell regards any good works / but only
rests unto faith.

This gospel therefore may sufficiently instruct any reasonable man / what
faith suffiseth / and what not: For it maruelously perteyneth to this purpose /
if we with any diligence observe and mark every mystery thereof.

First let us considre this multitude in it self / where many went before
our savior Jesu / and many followed after: and he in ye myddys of them all. Tho
that went before him betoken unto us / the fathers and the people of the old
testament / the which did pass the course of this world before the birth of
our savior Christ: tho that followed after / do signifye the fathers and the
people of the new testamennt / the which succeeded the birth of Christ. Both
these make but one people: For they be al of one faith.

Tho that went before believed that Christ should comme in to this world / and
dye for man. Tho that follow / believe that Christ is comme / and has suffered
his death for man. Never the less in some points there is difference between
these two: For they were under the law of Moses / which was a law of dread
/ and of rygour / as saint Paul says unto the Hebrews: Irritan^ quis
faciens legem Mosy / sine vlla miseratione / duovus aut trivus testibus
moriatur: who that has broken the law of Moses / if he were convinced by two
or three witnesses / he without any mercy should dye. And in token hereof it is
said of them that went before: Et qui preibant / increpabant eum: And tho
that went before / rebuked the blind man / that cried for mercy. But tho that
followed Christ were and be under the law of grace and marcy. For wha^ our
savior was borne in to this world / all grace and mercy came with him. And
therefore to show a difference of these two people / saint Johan says: Lex per
Moysen data est / gratia et veritas per Jesum Christum exorta est: That is to
say / the law was given unto that people by Moses: but grace and true
perfourmance of al promysses rose unto us by our savior Christ. All things
was showed unto that people by figures and shadows / as saint Paul says:
Omnia in figura contingebant illis. Till us (that succeed the coming of our
savior) the same things be disclosed and made open. And good reason why. For
they that follow a light se more clearly by that light / than they that go
before. That people might not well and easily bear the weight and strayte
commandmentes / the which were leyde upon their shoulders. And therefore saint
Peter in the Actis of the apostles: Neque nos / neque patres nostri portare
potuimus: The burden of the law of Moses was so heavy / that neither we nor
our fathers might sustain them.

But now to us the laws of savior Christ be made easy by the abundance of
grace / and by the dulcenes of love / which the holy ghost has put in our
hearts / as saint Paul says: Charitas dei diffusa est in cordibus nostris per
spiritum sanctum / qui datus est nobis: that is say / the love of god is
spredde in our hearts by the holy ghost / the which is given unto us. And this
is a great preemine^ce that we have above that people. This multitude that
follows Christ in the way / and is in passage / is the succession of Christis
church / which has continued and shall continue unto the worlds end / even
like a floode that passes continually / the waters go and pass / but yet the
floode continues / and reteyneth still the name of ye floode: so the succession
of Christis church ever continues / and is called ye church catholic /
though ye people yearly renew. Thus much tha^ I have said for this multitude
/ among which our savior Christ was. Now let us also briefly consydre /
what this blind man does mean and signify.

This man does betoken unto us the heretics / and that for. iiij. conditions
above rehearsed in this gospel. And here my brethren / ye that now be abiured
take heed.

First here I say that this man was singular by him self: and so the heretics
study to be singular in their opinions. Singularite and pride is ye the
ground of al heresy.
ground of all heresy. When a man studieth to be singular in his opinion / an
wylnat conform him self unto the multitude of good persons / than falls he
into heresies.

Second. this man was blind / and had lost his sight. And the heretics / by
the error of false doctrines and of peruersed heresies / be blyded in their
hearts / and have not the clear light of faith.

Third. this man sat out of the right way / and walked not: And so like wise
these heretics sytte out of the right way / and walk not in the journey
toward heaven.

Fourth. this man was divided from this people / among whom Christ Jesu was:
And so be the heretics like wise: they be divided from ye church of Christ /
with whom our savior Christ continues unto the worlds end. Thus ye
perceive I suppose / that this man (which was singular / ^ blind / and sat
out of ye way / divided from Christ for these. iiij. conditions) represents
ye heretics.

In the third place we may by this easily conceive / what great diversity is
between the church catholic and the heretics.

First / they that be of this multitude / and of the church catholic / they
be of one mind and opinion / concerning the substance of our faith / to agree
to gether in one doctrine. The heretics be singular / and have opinions by
them self: and they be repugnant not only with the church / but with them
self among them self / as we shall show here after. It is a very troth
that one wise man has said: Omne verum omni vero consonat / falsum autem tam
a se ipso quam ab ipsa veritate discrepat: Every troth agrees with other: but
falshod is both repugnant against him self and against ye troth. Secunde. The
church is in the clear brightness of faith. The heretics be blinded by their
false and erroneous opinions. For as truth gives a light and a brightness /
so falsehode blyndeth / and brings in to derkenes.

Third. The church is in the right way. The heretics be out of the right way.

Forth. The church walks and profits in their journey toward the country
of heaven. The heretics sit in Cathedra pestisentie / in the seat of
pestilence / and profete nothing in this journey / but rather synkethe depper
and depper toward the pytte of hell.

Fyfte. ye church has in it ye presence of Chrste / and shall have continually
unto the worlds end: The heretics be divided from Christ in this present
time / and so finally shall be excluded from the sight of his face for ever. All
these five differences be so manifest in this gospel / that we need not much
decleration for the same.

Now in the fourth place let us discuss / how this blind man was restored
unto his sight: to thentent that we may perceive how an heretic How an
heretic may be restored to the true faith.
may be restored to the true faith of Christis church. This blind man by.
iiij. manner of ways was brought unto his sight.

First he hering and inquiryng the very troth of that multitude / which
passed forby: Audiuit turbam pretereuntem / et interrogauit / quid hoc esset:
He herd the people which was in passage / and of them he learned what Jesus of
Nazareth was. So must heretics do / if he will be restored unto the true
faith. For no where the true doctrine of Jesu can be learned / but in the
church. Here must the word of god be learned. And this is wonderfully
expressed in this gospel by mystery. It is certain that the people of the
Jews / when yt Manhu was sent unto them from above / and they saw it in the
lykenes of the corriander sede / they made this same question / which this
blind man now does ask: Quid hoc? what is that. And of this question that
sede took this name / and was called Manhu. Now Manhu betokens in figure the
word of god. Who therefore so ever will learn the true doctrine of the word
of god / he must enquire it of this multitude / that walks in the right
way: that is to say / of the church catholic. Doutles out of ye church this
troth can not be learned.

Second. this bly^de man cried for mercy: so must ye heretic do: he must
beseech our savior Christ to enlighten his heart by clear faith / and to
remove from his heart ye blyndnes of all errors and heresye.

Third. our savior did co^mande yt this blind man should be brought unto
him: And so must ye heretics be reduced unto ye ways of ye church. But by
whom commands our savior / that thus they shall be reduced? truly by them
that be set in spiritual auctorite: as now yt most reverent fader i god my
lord Legate / hauy^g this most sovereign auctorite / has endeavored him self
for these men here present / and other / which were out of the way / to reduce
them in to the ways of the church. The heretics contend / that it shall not
belefull thus to do: but they would have every man left unto their liberty.
But doutles it may not be so: For the nature of man is more prone to all
noughtynes / rather than to any goodness. And therefore many must be compelled /
according as the gospel says in an other place: Compellite eos intrare. If
every man should have liberty to say what he would / we should have a marvelous
world. No man should stere any where for heresies. And therefore saint Paul
considering ye pronytie of man's heart to be infected with heresies / gives
often warning / that we shall in any wise eschew the perilous infections of
these heretics. And the same saint Paul often pronunceth excommunication
against them yt sow this puersed doctrines among the Christen people.
Wherefore it is not lefull yt any man shall have liberty to speak in these
matters concerning our faith / what so ever that he list: but he must be
compelled to conform him unto the wholesome doctrine of the church.

Fourth this blind man / when he was brought unto our savior / yet had he not
his sight unto than he did fully assent with his holle will unto the same. And
to that purpose our savior asked him what he would: Quid vis vt faciam tibi?
And so made him to confess his full assent. Thus must the heretic do that will
have his spiritual sight: he must fully assent unto the doctrine of Christis
church. He may be compelled to come bodily / but if he come not also with the
feet of his soul / and fully assent unto the church: he can not have this
true faith. The faith of the church is not made our faith / but by our
assent: which assent comes of us / and is the womb of our soul. And
therefore it is not absolutely said / fides but fides tua: That is to say / thy
faith. The faith of ye church (which by thine assent is made thy faith) does
make the safe.

In the fyfte and ye last place / as touching Martyn Luthers opinion of faith /
now will I speks some what. To rehearse his reasons / and so w^ade in this
matter with them / it were enough for all holle day. Neither the time will
serve it now / nor yet the people can attain to the conceyuyng of it. But I
shall breuely say. iij. things.

The first is this. Luther sore abuses and discey How Luther disceue^^e the
people by his erroneous opinion of faith.
ueth the people as concerning faith: For doutles he makes them in his common
sermons to thy^ke it is an easy matter to believe / and to have faith / and
there by to besaued: and so they care for no good works at all. But where he
boulteth and discusseth this matter unto the very trial / there he makes it
an hard matter. For in the declaration of the. vi. psalm he says these
words: Hoc certu^ est / nemine^ peruenturum ad dei misericordiam / nisi eam
veheme^tissime esuriat / et sitiat: cum isso qui ait: Que^admodum desiderat
ceruus ad fontes aquarum / it a desiderat anima mea ad te deus. Who has this
faith? Who comes to this high prick of faith / to desire as ernestly the
presence of god / as an heart / when he is chased / preaseth and coueteth to
come unto the soil? Here ye may se the commen people be disceyued / which be
far fro this point. But if only faith does justify us / we can not be
repelled from this mercy / when we be fully justified.

Second. why does Luther deny that the works do not justify us? His reason
is this. He says because they be our works: and what so ever reyseth from us
/ it is but sin. Tha^ let him observe these wordis: Fides tua. Our savior
says / not only Fides / but Fides tua. Thy faith (a troth it is) is the gift
of god: but it is not made my faith / nor thy faith / nor his faith / as I said
before / but by our assent. By our assent faith (which comes from above) is
made ours. But our assent is plainly our work. wherefore at the least one work
of ours joins with faith to our iusti^ienge.

Third. saint Paul in the epistole this day / plainly condemns this
opinion: for he says / that faith / hope / and charity be. iij. diverse
things: Fides / spes / et charitas / tria hec: These be. iij. diverse things
/ faith / hope / and charity. He says further: Si habuero oninem fidem / ita
vt montes trasferam / charitatem a^te^ non habuero / nihil sum: If I had all
and every faith / so that I might by my faith remove any great mountain: yet
if I have not charity / I am naught. wherefore if a man have al manner of faith /
and wants charity / he is never the more iustyfyed. Withoutten charity
therefore no man can be justified: but who that has charity / has also good
works: as the same saint Paul also proves at length in the same Epistole.
Wherefore withouten good works / either done / or in a full will to be done /
no man can be fully justified. And for this saint Paul in the Epistole ad
Romans expresses / what faith does justify a man. Fides (he says) que per
dilectione^ operatur: that is to say / faith which works by love / and that
is by love pregnant with good works.

Finally for a more clerenesse of these words / we shall considre. iij. manner
of persons: one of them that be in the way / an other of them that be nigh
unto the way / third is of them that be far out of the way: and each of
these have a believe. The Turk believes in god / and parauenture more
constantly than many christen men do: but he believes not in Christ the son
of god: nor upon the doctrine of the church: which doutles was inspired by
the holy ghost. And therefore his faith is not sufficient: he is very far out
of the way. The heretic believes in god and in Christ: and therefore he is
one degree nerer unto the right way / tha^ the turk is: he sytteth by the high
way side: but yet his faith is not sufficient: For he does not assent unto the
doctrine of the church: which is inspired by the holy ghost. Ye herd by the
gospel / that the blind man (when he sat out out of the high way) believed in
Christ for he said / Jesufi^^ David miserere me^: Jesu the son of David have
mercy upon me. By these words it appears that he believed he was both god and
man. God in that that he might restore his sight: man in that / that he called
him the son of David. But yet this faith gave him not his sight: He recovered
not his sight to than he was brought unto the way / and joined with this
multitude / among whom Christ Jesus was / and gave his full assent. So the
heretic / have he never so much faith of god and of Christ / if he be not
co^myn in to this way / if he be not joined with this multitude of christen
people / if he be not made one of this nombre / if he has not given his full
assent unto the doctrine of the church catholic / which is inspired of the
holy ghost / doutles he wants the sight of true faith. But wha^ he has fully
assented to bileue in god the father / and in Christ Jesus his son / and
upon and in the doctrine of the church / which devoutly was inspired by the
holy ghost: than this miracle is done upon him. He is restored to the sight of
clear faith. This is the faith good brethren that may make you safe / and
restore you unto your perfet sight. And therefore if ye have this faith / I may
say now to each of you: Respice / fides tua te fasuum fecit: Open thine eyes /
thy faith has made the safe. It is not the faith that the turk has / nor
the faith that the heretic has / but the faith catholic of Christis church
that shall save the: which faith is made thy faith / if thou truly come unto
the right way / if thou fastly join thy self with the church catholic / if
thou entierly make thy self one of this no^bre / if thou uprightly walk by
good works doing / if thou freely and fully assent unto the comme^ doctrine of
this multitude / among whom Christ Jesu is. And to thentent that your sightis
may be ye more clered in this faith / I shall gether. iiij. collectio^s: by the
which to all them that be not over peruersedly drowned in the heresies of
Luther / it shall appear (as I verily suppose) that his doctrine is very
pestilent and pernicious.

But here first I must beseech you to help me with your devout prayers /
that it may please that infinite goodness of almighty god so to assiste me with
his grace in vtteryng these collections / that it may be unto the true
faithful catholic herers some fruitful comfort: and to the favorers of
these most pernicious errors and heresies a very confusion: and that these
pour brethern^ of ours (which have been out of ye way) may the better be
confirmed and establisshed now in the same. To this prayer it may like you to
have reco^mended the universal church / ye very spouse of Christ / with
every state and degree of persons in the same / high and low / spiritual and
temporal / as well them that be now living as other that be departed hens /
enduryng as yet the grievous payns of purgatory: where they now abide the great
mercy of our lord / and the releue of our prayers. And to this purpose every
parson of your charity say some what after your devotion.

The first collection
FOr a more strengthynge of these collections / we shall adioyne unto this
miracle a parable of our savior Christ / which ^^ the same evangelist saint
Lu^e tells in this manner.

The sower (he says) went forth to sow his sede / and in the sowyng some part
of his sede fell nigh unto the high way / and so was trodden upon: and the
birds of the air did eat up this sede. An other part fell upon the stones /
which was covered over with a litell earth / and so the sede did sprowre: but
when it was sprowted / it might take no root for the hardness and drynes of ye
stones / but anon withered for lack of moisture. A third part fell among
the thorns: and this sede rooted and rose up a littel: but the thorns over
grew it / and so did suffocate it / that it might bring forth no fruit. The
fourth part fell upon the good earth / and sprowted / and took root / and
shote up / and brought forth great increase of fruit / an hundred fold so
much.

Wha^ our savior had spoke this parable / he cried mightily / saying: Om havet
autes audiendi / audiat: who that has the inward ears of heryng / let him
here and mark this parable. Four thiges noted in this patable.


In this parable we shall note. iiij. things: and of them / by the leave of
all mighty god / we shall gether as many collections.

Of these. iiij. things / the first is the sower / ye second is ye sede / ye
third is ye good earth / ye fourth is ye great e^creace of fruit. All these.
iiij. things under other names be contained in ye gospel of the miracle.
There our savior is ready to take away ye blyndnes of our hearts. ^here is he
called a sower of his sede. The multitude there e^structeth ye blind man where
Jesus of Nazareth is / and enfurmeth him in ye doctrine of faith. He / or ye
same doctrine is called the sede of the word of god. That multitude / which
ther^ has Christ among them / here is called the good earth. There ye
multitude profits in merit / by walkyng and nigh approaching unto our savior
Christ: here this merit is called the plenteous encreace of good fruit.

First tha^ as co^cerny^g ye sower / some person might First / the sower.
here lightly think / yt our savior was not fully circu^spect in tellyng this
parable. for here seems to want some thing yt is chiefly necessary for ye
ple^teous e^creace of fruit to be had. here is left out vnspoke^ of ye
favorable disposition and influence of ye heuens / which is pri^cipally
required unto ye purpose. For put that ye sede be never so good / and ye earth
never so well prepared and ordered / and that ye sower do his part never so
much / yet if the favorable influence of the heuens want / all that labor is
but in vain / there shall no fruit arise of that sowyng. This is a very troth
/ I can not say the contrary / these. iiij. things must needs be co^curra^t to
work each with other / and join to gether in one purpose. I say / the
influence of the heuyns / the diligence of the sower / the goodness of the sede
/ the due preparation and tyllyng of ye earth. And albe it that here is no
special mention made of the influence of the heuyns / it is never the less
included. For when we know who is the sower / we shall well perceive he has
all the influence of the heuyns in his own hand: and this shall well appear /
if we join the parable and his declaration to gether. Join I say the parable
with the declaration of the same / and ye shall find that this sower / that is
meant here / is very god. And by this reason: the parable says: Exiit / qui
seminat / seminare seme^ suu^: He that is the very sower has issued for to
sow his own sede. The declaration is / Semen est verbum dei. This sede is the
word of god. Now tha^ if the sede that this sower does sow / be the word of
god / and this sede which he sows is his very own: It follows necessarily
that this sower is very god: And so must he needs have in his hands the holle
influence of the heuyns. Whersore here nothing lacks in this parable. But as
for the bodily heuyns let them pass: all is spiritual that is meant here:
the heuyns / the influence / the sower / the sede / the earth / the fruit / all
is spiritual: and we must conceive all this spiritually. And therefore our
savior said: Oui habet aures audiendi / audiat: who that has the inward
ears of spiritual herynge / and spiritual conceyuyng he is mete to here and
to conceive this parable.

First this sower (as I have said) is the son of god* our savior Christ
Jesu: and he is ye very spiritual son of this world / Qui illuminat omne
hominem venientem in hunc mundum / That spreads his comfortable beams upon
the souls of men. He issued out from the bosom of his father / and came i^ to
this world purposely to sow i^ ye hearts of men the sede of troth. He it is
that sows his own sede. The preachers of this word be nothy^g else / but as
the cophyns and the hoppers / wherein this sede is couched. Thus saint Augustine
says of him self: Ego quid sum / nisi cophinus seminatoris* What am I says
he? verily nothing else but the cophyne / or the hopper of him that sows. The
preacher may well rehearse ye words of scripture: but they be not his words /
they be the words of Christ. And if our savior Christ speak not within the
preacher / the sede shall be but cast in vain. Therefore saint Paul says unto
the Corrinthies of him self: In me loquitur Christus: Christ says 2. Cor. 13
he / speaks within me. Christ that spoke in saint Paul was the very sower:
and as he spoke in saint Paul / so spoke he i^ ye other blessed fathers /
which for their time did instruct and teach the people / and minister this
sede unto them. And not only Christ did sow this sede by their mouths: but
also ye spirit of god gave his gracious influence unto this sede by their
mouths / in like manner. wherefore of this spirit our savior says: No^ vos
estis / qui loquimini / sed spiritus partis vestri / qui Mar. 10.
loquitur in vobis? Ye be not the speakers (he says) but ye spirit of your
father speaks within you. Farther more / both this sower and this influe^te
continues in ye church unto the worlds end: For ye sower says of him
self: Ecce / ego vobiscu^ sum omnibus Matt. 18.
diebus vsque ad co^suminatione^ seculi: Trust assuredly that I am and shall be
with you unto the end of the world. And for ye spirit our savior also
promest / that he should abide with ye church euerlasty^gly / Vt maneat
vobiscu^ in eternu^. This most holy spirit / which Jo. 14.
is the bountious fontayne of influence of all graces / after the corporal
ascension of our savior unto the heuens / was se^te down upon the church /
according to the promise of our savior before made: to thentent that the
sowyng of this sede should never want the heavenly influence of al graces.

Now than to my purpose / thus far we be / ye now conceive (I suppose) that
this spiritual sower / all be it so (...) be corporally ascended unto his
father / yet neu^^thelesse he by his godhed and by the assistence of his grace
/ has been ever sens verily present with his church / to sow therein the
sede of his word. And also the heavenly influence / that is to say / the
influence of the holy ghost / is favorably spread upon the toward and well
wyllyng hearts / to thentent that this sede may bring forth a plentuous
increase of good fruit / and in this gracious purpose they both / I say both
the sower and this holy spirit / have continued / and will so continue / unto
ye worldis end. Who tha^ may dout / but in this long time / which is above
fyftene hundred years / the true sede of the word of god / that is to say the
scriptures of god have been truly taught unto the people: and the people has
truly believed and given true faith unto the same doctrine of the scriptures?

Who is so deuyllysshe / that may think that our savior Christ / the which
so derely beloved his church / that for the weal of hit / would suffer so
bitter / so villaynous / so horrible a deth^* and shede his most precious
blood in the cross^* to prepare the hearts of his people for the receyuyng of
this sede? I say who may think / that ever he / that did so much for us /
would break his promise unto us? And if he have not broke his promise: than
has he ben with his church all this long time of fyftene hundred years: and
has sown the tre^^e sede of his word: and his most holy spirit also has
been all this time present in the church: and has given unto the toward
hearts his gracious influence / both to receive this sede / and also to bring
forth plentuous fruit.

Now than / if this sede were thus truly sown: than would I learn / who were
the mynysters of this true sede? Who but the preachers of this word: I say
the holy doctors / which taught the people: and to whom by the holy spirit
was commysedde the governance of the flock of Christ / as saint Paul says
in ye Acts of the Apostles: Attendite vobis / et vniuerso gregi / in Act. 10.
quo vos spiritus sanctus posuit episcopos / ad rege^dam ecclesiam dei / quam
acquesiuit sanguine suo: Take heed unto your self / and to the holle flock of
Christ / where the spirit of god has ordained you bisshoppes / to govern
his church: the which he so derely purchased by his own most precious
blood. Ye herd in the tellyng of the miracle / how the first mean for the
blind man to come unto his sight was heryng. For as saint Paul says: Fides
e^ Romans 10.
auditu: Faith comes by heryng: by the preaching of the holy doctors the
people herd the word of god / and believed it. For as saint Paul says:
Quomodo credent ei / de quo non audierunt? How shall the people believe / if
they here not? Et quomodo audient sine predicante? And how shall they here
without it be preached unto them? This is than the order and the holle cheane:
the blyndenes of our hertes can not be put away / but by true faith: true faith
can not be gotten / but by herynge of this word. The heryng of this word shall
not be had / but by the means of preaching: prechynge can not be ministered
without the preacher: the preacher can not profitte / onles Christ Jesu
(which is the very sower) speak within him: and also the spirit of Christ
give his influence unto ye same.

It is manifest than / that these preachers were the true ministers of this
sede. It is also not to be douted / but the true christen people always
hitherto has given faith to the doctrine of the catholic preachers: and so
did believe ye scriptures as they did expound them / that were in times paste.
And it is farther more certain / that these catholic doctors ministered this
sede / in like manner as they have left written unto us in their books. Wherefore
if the preachers did err in teaching the scriptures of god: the people did
err in beleuyng their doctrine. And if both the preachers and the people did
err: where was ye true sowynge of this sede? Where was the doctrine of the
faith? where was bicome the promise of our savior Christ? O cursed Luther / O
mischeuous Apostata / O most execrable heretic yt denyest and dispisest all
the fathers that ever were before us: For in so denyeng / thou must needs
affirm / yt neither the doctrine of true faith / nor any true sowyng of this
sede was in the church of Christ by so many years: and that our savior
Christ Jesu nothing regarded his promise all this long time / either as
concerning his own presence to be continually with his church: or as
concerny^g the presence of his holy spirit / for to give his influence with
the sowynge of this sede. It is therefore clear and evident (as I suppose) by
this collection / that ye fathers / which under our savior Christ and this
holy spirit have hitherto governed the church catholic / have also truly
ministered this sede unto ye people / and truly have interpretate the
scriptures of god unto them: and yt our savior Christ Jesu by their mouths
did truly sow this sede / and the holy spirit of god gave his most gracious
influence so plentiously / both unto the fathers / and unto the people that
this most gracious sede took / effect in both their hearts.

By this collection all the heresies of Luther at here the heresyed of Euther
fasse.
ones fall unto the ground. For if the doctrine of the fathers be true (as it
must be / if our savior spoke by their mouths) Luthers doctrine / which is
contrary / must nedis be false.

Now therefore my brethren / ye that be abiured / here take heed.

Since it is evident / that our savior by ye mouths of the fathers has sown
this sede of his word / and declared the scriptures of god by ye same: the
spirit of god has also gyueu his influence unto this same sede: By whom
suppose ye / that the doctrine of Luther (which is plain contrary unto this
doctrine / and utterly condemned by the holy fathers) by whom (I say) suppose
ye / that this mischeuous sede was sown? By whom else / but by the devil / and
inspired by the wicked spirits. Therefore if ye love your own souls / now
flee this doctrine hens forward: and join you unto the doctrine of the
church / and believe as the church believes: that I may say unto each of you:
Rispice / fides tua te saluum fecit: Open thine eyes / for this faith / that
now thou haste / beleleuynge as the church of Christ believes / has
sauedthe.

The second collection.
THe second thing that I The sede.
said was to be marked / is the sede of the word of god: which here is not
called Semina / but Seme^ / not many but one. This sede for. iii.
considerations / is but one sede.

First for it is fortable and agreeable / and like unto The sede of ye word of
god is but one sede for. 3 consyderations.
it self in every part. As when we se an heap of wheat / that is clean and
pure wheare / without any diverse medlyng of cockel / or of any other noughty
and evil sede / though there be many diverse cornis / yet for as much as they
be all of one kind / we say it is al one sede: and in like manner it is of the
word of god: though there be many words / and many trouthes in it / many
specialties / many parables / many similitudes / many commandments / many
consailes / many thretes / many promises / many persuasions / yet for as much
as it has no falsehod nor untruth / none error / no wicked doctrine meddled
therewith / but is all (as ye would say) of one grain / of one grows / of one
country: for all comes from above. Est saptentia desursunt descendens a patre
luminum / as Jacobi. ^.
saint James says. Therefore it is but one word / one sede / one doctrine.
Contrary wise it is of the doctrine of Luther: For it is a medley made of many
diverse colors / and of diverse patches / and has a party coote: Hit is not
one / but many doctrines adulterate / as saint Paul says: Adulterantes verbum
dei: These heretics adulterate ^. Col. ^.
the word of god / and make a show and a face of their heresy outward / as
though it were ye word of god / and hit is not. It is diverse from the
doctrine and sede of this word. I say not / but Luther uses full often the
words and scriptures of god / I should say rather / abuses them: But he
intermedleth with them many great errors / many falsehodes / many perverse
expositions / contrary unto the true teaching / left unto us by the holy
fathers in times paste: and contrary to the holle determination of Christis
church. And for because that he thus has intermedled much evil sede with
the sede of god: and interlaced many great heresies: Therefore his doctrine is
not one but diverse / and of many kinds.

The second consideration / why ye sede of the word The second consydecation.
of god is one / is for because there is in it no discord / no repugnancy / no
contradiction / of one part of it with another. It is like of it and of a
song / where be many syngers / that diuersely descant upon the plain song:
but for as much as they all agree withouten any gerryng / withouten any
mystunynge / they make al but one so^ge / and one armony. In like manner it is
of the scriptures of god / and of the doctrine of the church: There be many
singers / and some sing the plain song / and some sing the descant / saint
Mathewe / saint Mark / saint Luke / saint Johane / saint Peter / saint Paul /
saint James / saint Jude sing the plain song. Than be there a great nombre of
the doctors / which descante upon this plain song: but for because there is
no discord / no repugnancy / no contradiction among them / at the leest in
any point concerning the substance of our faith: all their boyces make but one
song / and one armony. The doctrine of Luther can not be so: For he not only
disagreeth with the fathers / but also with him self in places innumerable: as
they / which have written against him / have evidently proved who that redeth
the kings book / the book of master More / the books of Catharinus / the
books of Empser / of Corleus / of Eckius / and many other / he shall clearly se
/ that this is a troth / which I now say. And not only this / but also god
thereof highly be thanked / they now gerre and difagre The heretihes ^isegre
among them self
among them self. Three principal capitaynes of them defend. iij. plain
contrary senteces / and that in that most high word of Christ / concerning the
sacrament of the auter. I dare not rehearse their contrary expositions. For as
saint Paul says: Sermo eorum sicut cancer serpit: Their ^. Tim. 2
hersies be perilous: For they spredde like a canker: and as a pestilence they
do infecte the herers. Nevertheless this is a very troth / that I say unto
you / twain of them / that is to say / Luther and Oecola^padius fully disagre
/ and make plain contradictorie expositions of these same words. And the
third / which is called Carlstadius / holds clean contrary to them both.
Here be worthy masters for a good christen man to put his soul in their
hands / yt so repugnantly vary in expou^dyng ye scriptures. And yet all these.
iij. be me^ of great name / and of high reputacion in lernyng among the
Lutherians. This is the syngular goodness of god / to stricke them with this
contradiction and repugnancy among them self: so yt one of them shall not
here another. Even as wha^ the tower of Babylon was enforsed to be builded /
all mighty god thus stroke ye builders of that tower / that one of them did not
understand another: So now has he stricken these heretics / which enforsed
them to build a tower against the church / that among them self they have
clean contrary doctrynes: and one of them will not here another.

The third consideration / why the sede of the The third consyderation.
word of god is but one / is this. Though there be many books of scripture /
both in the old testament and in the new also / yet all these books be so
fully agreed by the expositio^s and interpretations of the holy doctors / that
they make but one book / and one body of scripture: and have in them all but
one spirit of life: that is to say / the spirit of Christ Jesu. Even as in
the body of man there be many parts and many members / yet for as much as in
every of them is but one life and one soul: therefore the body is but one. This
thing was figured in a vision / showed unto the prophet Ezechiell: he saw one
roundell and many roundels / and each of them in the myddis of other: but in
all these roundels was but one spirit of life. So every part of scripture is
like a roundel: For it has no corners. Troth is round and has none angles.
The psalter of David is a roundell of truth / and each of the gospels is a
roundell of truth: The gospelles be in the psalter: and the psalter is in the
gospelles: and the spirit of Christ makes one roundell of them all. The new
testament is a roundell / and the old testament is a roundell / and either of
them is in the other: but there is but one spirit of life in them both: and
so in every roundell of scripture: and this spirit makes one roundell of all.
And with these also the expositio^s of the fathers / which were inspired by
the same spirit / make one roundell with the same.

The doctrine of Luther can not be thus / nor yet partiner of this spirit of
life / because it is repugnant and divided from the holle corpse of the
doctrine of the church. Wherefore we may necessarily The doctrine of Luther is
not one with the doctrine of Christ.
conclude / that the doctrine of Luther is not one with the doctrine of Christ
/ nor has in it the spirit of life: For as much as it is repugnant and
contradyctorily diverse from the doctrine of the church. Which thing we may
prove by. iij. reasons. The first is this. The doctrine of the church / wherein
all ye fathers agree / is spoken by Christ / and inspired by the holy spirit
of Christ / as it does appear of the first collection. But Christ and his
holy spirit can not teach and inspire two doctrynes / the which be clean
contrary. Wherefore the doctrine of Luther is not the doctrine of Christ / and
of his most holy spirit.

Second. Christ Jesu says of him self / that he is the very troth: Ego
sum veritas. But one troth can not be divided at ones to two contradictories.
And why? If that one of them have the troth / that other must needs want it:
For one troth can not be commune unto them both.

Third. the holy ghost is the spirit of life unto the doctrine of the
church. But the sprite of life can not be divided: but it must go holle: As we
se that wha^ a man's arm is cut from his body / the life is not divided /
part unto the arm / and part unto the body: but the holle life gothe with
the body / and the arm has no part thereof. So for because that Luther by his
intricate expositions makes one part of scripture to be repugnant against an
other / as he confesses him self / that he can not frame his other
expositions with the Epistole of saint James / and with the gospel of Luke.
Therefore it is manifest* that his doctrine is divided from the holle corpse of
scripture / and is not one with the doctrine of the church / nor has not in
it the spirit of life.

But now by your sufferance / I will speak a few words unto these persons /
which be abiured.

My brethren / ye may perceive by this that I have said / that the sede of ye
word of god / that is to say ye doctrine of Christis church / for these. iij.
considerations before rehearsed / is one: And that the doctrine of Luther is by
the same. iij. considerations not one. Wherefore ye may sufficiently conclude /
that the doctrine of Luther is not the gracious sede of the word of god / nor
has in it the spirit of life: but is an evil sede / a sede of corruption / a
sede of pestilent infection / a sede that bly^^deth me^nes hertes / a sede that
enueougleth their sight / a sede that extincteth in them ye true faith * a sede
that distroyeth their souls / finally the very sede of the devil / which is
inspired by the wicked spirits. Therefore good brethren / I would advise both
you and every other true christen man / to eschew this sede. And if it be sown
i^ your hearts / to pluck it out by the routis / and to receive the gracious
sede of the word of god / and fully to assent to the doctrine of Christis
church / that the words above rehearsed may be said to each of you: Respice /
fides tua te safu^i fecit: Open thyn^ies / this is the faith / that may make
the safe.

The third collection.
THe third thing to be marked is The good earth.
the good earth: by the which our savior understands in this parable one
certain manner of people: For he so declares it him self / saying: Quod autem
in terram bonam / hi sunt qui cord honesto et bono: That is to say / this good
earth betokens them / which be of one heart honest and good. I mean the
people / of whom we spoke in ye gospel of the miracle before: the multitude I
say / which had Christ among them. Soon after that our savior had begone
together this people to giders / which we call the christen people / he said
un them that than were present: Amen di^o ^obis / non preteribit generatio ^ec
/ donec ^ec omnia fucta Mat. 24.
fuerint: I tell you for a certain / this generation shall not pass / unto
than all these things that I now have spoken of / shall be performed. He meant
not here any carnal generation. No. for that carnal generation / to whom he
than spoke / were deed many hundred years ago. And also tho things that he
than spoke of / be not yet perfurmed / but shall be performed about the end of
the world. Wherefore doubtless he meant a spiritual generation: that is to say /
the generation of christian people: which hitherto in dispite of all their
ennemies / have continued / and shall continue unto the worldis end. Great
malice and persecution has been used against this generation / both by the
Jews and by the gentiles / by the tyrants / by the philosophers / and the
heretics: but all they might not prevail against this generation / according
as our savior Christ has promised: Et port inferi non preuasebunt aduersue
^am: And all the Mat. 16.
malice of hell shall not prevail against this generation / nor interrupt it.

The wonderful continuance of this generation was one thing specially / that
kept saint Augustyne (as he reportethe him self) and held him in the
catholic faith. In the book contra ij. things did establishe saint Augustyne
i^ the catholyke faith.
Manichesi he remembers. ij. things concerning this matter. That one is this.
Tenet me ab ipsa sede Petri apostoli / cui pascendas oues suas post
resurrectionem dominus commendauit / vsque ad presentem episcopatu^ successio
sacerdotum: It holds me first to be one of the church / the continual
succession / that I se of popes one after an other / fro the first sittyng of
Peter in the Sea apostolice / to whom our savior commysed his flock to be
fed / unto this present time. This holy doctor saint Augustyne co^sidred
what name Christ gave unto Peter*callynge him Cephas / which is as much to
say as Petra / or ^apis. And he marked also well / what promise our savior
did make unto him / saying: Et super hanc petram edificabo ecclesiam m^am. And
he observed farther more / how that among all the other apostles only the
succession of Peter does continue / and to se the promise of our savior thus
truly put in effect: This was some thing yt made saint Augustine to follow
constantly the doctrine of the church. An other is this. Tenet ipsum cotholice
nomen / quod no^ sine causa inter tam multas hereses ista ecclesia sola
obtinuit: That is to say / and this thing also keeps me fast in the doctrine
of the church / that this congregation / which is deriuied from the sea of
Peter / has among so many heresies / and against so many heretics / only
and not withoute^ cause opteyned this name Catholica / that it is called the
catholic church. These two things did conferme and establisshe saint
Augustine in the catho like faith. And truly who that depely weyeth al these
things shall think the same. I say / if he co^sydre depely with him self:
first yt such a manner of name Pet received of our savior Christ: he was
called Cephas / which is as much to say as a stone. This no man can deny.

Second. if he considre / how that our savior said unto Peter / that upon
that stone he would build his church: against the which the gates of hell
should not prevail.

Third. if he remember beside this / how unto the same Peter he seriously
co^mysed his flock to be fed and to be governed.

Fourth. if he considre / that the true christen people / which we have at
this day / was deriuied by a continual succession from the sea of Peter. For
where is now the christen people of the region of Scithia / which came of the
succession of saint Andrewe: Be they not now infidels? Where is now the
people of Ephesus / and of all Asia / which came of the succession of saint
John^? Be they not infidels? Where is now the people of both Aethiops /
which came of the succession of saint Mattheu and saint Mathye? Be they not
infidels? And breuely to say / where is all the other people / which came of
ye succession of the other apostles? either they now be infidels / or else
schismatickes / or other wise divided from the church of Christ.

Finally / if he put unto these / that only the succession of Peter in dispite
of al their e^nemyes does yet continue / and yet bears the name of the very
catholic church / and so shall do unto the worldis end / he shall se
evidently / that this multitude and this successiou is the very church of
Christ: against the which the gates of hell shall never prevail.

Thus than ye se which is the good earth: I say the multitude of christen
people / which hitherto by a continual succession was deriuied from the sea
of Peter.

But now let us here what conditions our savior The conditions of the good
earth.
adioyneth unto this good earth / he says: hi sunt / qui in cord honesto et
bono. Pardon me / though I rehearse ye words aft ye greek book: for they make
better against our e^nemies / he says: In cord honesto / et vono. Here be.
iij. conditions. First in cord / The first condition. Act. 4.
that is to say of one heart and mind / according as it is written /
Mustitudinis credentium erat cor vnum / et anima vna: All that multitude that
believed in Christ / was of one heart and of one mind / that is to say / they
were not divided by contrary doctrynes. And therefore likewise saint Paul /
writing unto the Corinthies / says: Idem loquamini 1. Cor. 1.
omnes / et non sint inter vos dissidia / sed s^itis integrum corpus / eadem
mente / et eade^ sententia: That is to say / speak ye all one way / and let
there be no contrary opinions among you / but be ye as an holle body of one
mind and of one sentence. Sith that Luther with his sect / is of an other
mind and sentence / and of a diverse heart and opinion fro the church / as I
have showed before / it is manifest by this first condition / that they be
excluded fro this good earth / and fro this succession of christen people /
which we call the church catholic. As for us it is certain / that we come
derectly of this succession / and join fully with the fathers in all their
doctrynes. Contrariwyse Luther dispiseth them and their doctrynes / as I said
before: and there he deuideth him self from the doctrine of the church / and
fro this good earth. For what is the doctrine of the church / but the doctrine
of the fathers? Not many years ago / as Luther confesses him self / he joined
with the fathers / and with the church / as we do: but now he has cut him
self fro the church. We came not out of him and of his sect / but all they
came out of us / and so have divided them self from us. We still keep and follow
the doctrine / which has been left unto us by the gracious fathers / men of
singular learning and excellent holiness / which by the holy ghost had the
continual governance of the church unto this day / as saint Paul does
witness in the Actis of ye apostles / as I said before. We than that follow
such doctrynes / as have been left unto us / by these governors / which went
before us / be of one heart and mind with them / and with the church. And
Luther with his adherentes / which will not accept and allow these doctrynes
/ be of a diverse heart and mind fro the fathers / and have so divided them
self fro the church. Wherefore it is manifest / that they want this first
condition of the good earth: they be not of one heart and of one mind with us.

The second condition is honesto / that is honest The sec^^ condition.
and fair: For the greek word is indifferent to both. The light of true
faith / which is a clear brightness without any errors / much does honest
and make beauteous the heart of a christen man: For withouten hit there is no
honest nor beauty in a soul. Sine fide impossible est placere deo. This
faith can not be in the Lutherians / but remains only in ye succession of the
church / whereof we come. But the Luthera^s (as I said) be divided from the
church / and their faith is a clean contrary doctrine from ours / and against
all them that were in the same succession before us. It is also full of many
great errors. One error suffiseth to spill and to distroye any man's faith:
but much rather many great errors / and specially such as here before have
been condemned by many general counsayles / had in the church. At the which
counsayles were present great nou^bre of honorable fathers assembled to gether
by the holy ghost / men of singular lerny^g and excellent holiness / the which
was confirmed by many great miracles. Wherefore the faith of the Lutherans and
the faith of the church / can not agree / but be clean repugnant one against
an other. And therefore if they both be true faithes / than shall there be two
faithes: the which saint Paul utterly denies / sayng: Dnus dominus / vna
Ephe. 4
fides. Wherefore also they want this second condiction / that is to say /
honesty and beauty of faith.

The third condition is bono / that means the The third condition.
towardnes of a good will to bring forth ye fruit of good works: For
withouten that all faith is naught / as says saint James: Fides sine operibus
Jac. 2.
mortua est. It suffiseth not for a christen man to believe the doctrine of the
church / but he must also work and bring forth some increase of good
fruit. This fruit they bring not forth / as it more plainly shall appear here
after. Wherefore they want also this condition of the good earth. But what tha^
be they? Surely they be the trodde earth in the high way / and the stones / and
the thorns / whereof the gospel here speaks. Saint Peter in his second
Epistole / where he prophiseth of such heretics / has ^. Peir^ ^
expressedly discribed ye Lutherans / and tells. iij. conditions of them:
Whereby they How the Luthera^s may be known.
may be clerery known.

The first is this. Qui carnem sequentes in co^cupiscentia polutionis ambulant.
That is to say / they follow the ways of their flesh / and walk in the
unclean disires of the same. Thus Luther does withoute^ doubt and they all /
which be of his sect: for he says it is necessary for every man and woman to
have the carnal use of their body / as it is to eat or to drink. But where
this carnalite reigns / there ye wicked spirits have full dominatio^: and
there they keep their hau^te / and make that soul and heart as common a
trodde as is ye high way. These be the birds of the air / which eat up the
sede of the word of god: they leave nothing but the very hulle of that sede
/ the virtue o^ it they convey away. The fair speech / ye eloquece / the
knowledge of languages / these be but the very hulle of the scriptures. This
hulle these heretics have: But the very pithe and substance of the sede is
piked out of their hearts by these evil spirits / that keep them in this
carnalite.

The second condition is. Dominationem contenmu^t audaces / prefracti. That is
to say / they despise al governors / and them that be i^ auctorite / and they
be stiff and heedy in their ways: be not ye Lutherans thus? who is more
styffe / yea more furious than Luther is? For he dispiseth kings / princes /
popes / bisshoppes / and all auctorite both spiritual and temporal. And what
is this / but a very stonynes / indurate of pride and obstynacie?

The third condition is this. Qui gloria precesientes non verentur co^uitus
incessere. That is to say / they dread not / nor be a shamed to skoffe / and
check / and to rebuke / yea to tear / scratche and rent the fames and lives
of noble men. And this the Lutherans also do / and Luther him self
principally: and thus they show them self to be very thorns and briers /
which / as the gospel says / does strangle the good sede.

Now tha^ to you my brethren / which be abiured / I must direct my speech.
For as much as by this collectio^ ye perceive / yt the earth meant in this
parable is the true christen people / which have Christ among them /
according as the gospel of the miracle tells: and that this people has
continued their succession hitherto / fro ye see of Peter: and that also they
have in them. iij. conditions / that is to say / they be of one heart / by true
doctrine: they be of one honesty / by ye brightness of faith: And third / they
be of one good will to bring forth e^crease of good fruit. The Lutherans want
these. iij. conditions: they be not of one heart and of one doctrine with this
multitude: Nor they have not one faith with them: And as for any fruit they
care not: as shall be clearly showed in the fourth collection. Wherefore they be
not this good earth / but they rather have the conditions of thorns and stones
/ and of the clonge earth / as it manifestly appears by the prophecy of saint
Peter / as ye have herd. Wherefore it shall be expedient that ye from hensforth
fle their company / and adioyne you with ye good earth / with the catholic
people / and follow the doctrine of Christis church: that I may repete unto
every of you the wordis above rehearsed: Respice / fides tua te saluum fecit /
Open thyn eyes / this thy faith / now beleuynge as the church believes / has
made the safe.

The fourth collection concerning the encreace of good fruit.
THe fourth / and the last thing to be marked in this parable / is the
encreace of fruit* the which in ye gospel of Mattheu is told more expressly*
Aliud quide^ centuplam / aliud sex^^^agecuplum Mat. 1^.
/ aliud trigecupsum: In some earth this sede brings forth an hundred fold
encreace / in some sixtyfolde / in some thyrtyfolde. This diversity of encreace
betokens unto us diverse degrees of spiritualnes / which the sede of the
word of god workethe in our hearts / more or less / according as our hearts
better or worse be disposed. The heart that is more towardly disposed / is made
more spiritual: and the heart that is less towarly / is less spiritual.

The same diversity of fruit was signified in the gospel of the miracle. For
there all that multitude yt followed Christ / was not elyke nygh unto Christ /
every one of them. Wherefore tho that were next until him / betoken the most
perfect: tho that were farther of / less perfect: and tho that were farthest
of / the least perfect. But we shall now speak of the diverse degrees of
increase of fruit.

Conceive me what I mean. Ye se that though the ground in the feeldes / by
the dylygence of men / be never so well broken and seasoned / yet if there be
no good seed sown in it / it brings nothing forth of it self but weeds
/ and all his natural moisture tourneth in to weeds: But when some good sede
is cast in to hit / than that sede by his natural virtue / and by the
influence of the heuens / so myghtily draws that erthely moisture of the
ground / and changes it / and assembleth it in to his own substance: in so
much that in some well prepared earth there spryngeth not one weed / but all
the moisture of the ground is turned in to corn. In some other be fewer or
mo weeds / according to the goodness of the earth / or better / or less
diligence in preparyng of the same. In like manner it is of the sede of the
word of god / and of the heart of man. An heart that is not sown with the
word of god / but left until his own nature / brings nothing forth but
the weeds of carnalitie / carnal thoughts / carnal affections / and carnal
works. But when the word of god is sown / and the spirit of god gives the
influence of his grace: than that sede of the word of god / by his
supernatural virtue / and by the gracious influence of the holy spirit of god
/ works in that heart / and changes the carnalitie thereof in to a
spiritualnes / according as the heart is better or worse disposed / by three
manners of degrees.

The lowest degree of this spiritualnes is in the state of matrimony: where
though there be many weeds / yet there is much e^crease of fruit / if this
sacrament truly be kept / there the increase of fruit is thyrtyfolde.

The myddell degree is in ye state of wydowheed / the which has fewer weeds
and more fruit. Here the increase of fruit is three skore fold.

The third is i^ the state of virginite / which has The state of virginite.
very few weeds / or none at all / but all is fruit: and this increase is an
hundred fold so much. First than let us begin to speak of this high state
of virginite.

The word of god with the influence of grace so works in the hearts of true
virgins / that in manner it leaves no carnalitie there / but changes all in
to a spiritualnes / that it makes them to despise all thoughts / all
affections / al works / that be carnal / save only these / which be
necessarily requisite unto ye bodily life: that is to say / to keep the soul
and the body together. Of this virginite our savior gave example him self:
the same followed his blyssed mother / and saint Johan the Evangelist likewise:
which for his clennes was singularly beloved of our savior: and for ye same
he co^mysed the custody of his mother until him. And likewise to saint Paul
he gave example hy^ self of clennes / and continency of his body. And therefore
he does wisshe / that other would do the same / and persuadeth there unto
saying thus: Velim omnes homines esse / sicut et ipse su^. And a litel after:
1. Cor. 7.
Bonsi eis est / si manserint / vt et ego. Of such also our savior speaks in
the gospel / and preyseth them saying: Sunt enuchi / qui se castrauerunt
propter regnum Mat. 19.
cesoru^: There be some / which have splayde them self spiritually / that is
to say / have cut from their hearts the carnal affections of their bodi es
/ for ye love of the kingdom of heaven. A troth it is / all will not do thus /
and so our savior says in the same place: Non omnes capiu^t ver^^ hoc: This
word works not in every heart. Yet nevertheless he does exhort there unto /
saying: Qui potest capere / capiat: He that may take this word and keep his
virginite / let him take it. But thus did a great nombre of christen people in
Alexandria / which by the preaching of saint Mark / consecrate their
virginite unto Christ both men and women / as Philo the Hebrewe tells. Such
were also great nombre of women / the which in Jerusalem likewise unto
Christ did consecrate their virginite / as tells Euseby i^ his story. And
these thus did by the prechynge of the apostles. Innumerable such also both
men and women were in the desartes of Eyry of Egypt and Ethiop. All these by
watch / fasting / prayer contempned their flesh / chastised their bodies /
and kept them low / to thente^t that they might keep their souls clean unto
Christ. And it is not to be douted / but that there is in Christendom / at
this day / many thousands of religious men and women / that full truly keep
their religion and their chastity unto Christ. For when Hely the prophet had
supposed that so great a persecution was made agay^st the true servants of
god / that he was left alone / it was answered until him by almighty god / as
says saint Paul. Adhuc reliqui mihi septe^ milia / To. ^^.
qui non curuauerunt genu ante Baal: I have yet reserved unto me seven
thousand / the which has done none idolatry before Baall. And if almighty
god did reserve in that little portion of Jury so great a multitude beyond the
estimation of this prophet Hely: what nombre suppose ye. does yet remain in
all Christendom of religious men and women / not withstanding this great
persecution of religious monasteries both of men and of women / done by these
heretics / by this most execrable doctrine? It is not to be doubted / but in
all Christendom be left many thousands / which at this hour live chaste /
and truly keep their virginite unto Christ.

Now let us se / whether ye sede of god work this The fruit of Luthers
doctrine.
high fruit among the Lutherans or not. No. no. nothy^g less. Halas it will
make a true christian ma^s heart to blede blody tears within his breast / for
to here their lyuy^g. The prestis of his sect / which should keep their hands
and hearts clean for to mynister the blessed sacrament / follow the lust and
carnalite of their flesh. The religious men forsake their religion / and
return unto ye world / and take them queanes. The virgins that were
consecrate unto god / and had promised to keep them self self as true spouses
unto Christ / now give their bodies till all wretched pleasure / and suffer
them self to be stuprate and abhomynably defiled and soused in all carnalite O
Jesus / this is the fruit that comes of the wicked sede / which this
ungracious heretic has sowe^ among them. How far is this from the example
of Christ / and from ye other blessed fathers innumerable / which both lived
chaste them self / and procured likewise that other should do the same? If the
devil have not excecate our eyes / we may se by this evidently / yt this
doctrine comes not from above: For than it should not be contrary unto the
counsayles of Christ / and of saint Paul / and of the other scriptures of
god: but it comes plainly from ye devil. And yet he is not ashamed to write /
that al his doctrine he has of god. Thus much for the first fruit.

By this first ye may judge what his mind and The fruit of widow ^ed.
sentence is / concerning the second fruit / that is to say / as touchy^g
wydowes. He that calls virgins to forsake their virginite / will but a little
regard the state and fruit of wydwohed. And herein also he teaches contrary
unto ye counsel of saint Paul / which cou^saileth wydowes to keep them sole
and specially to thentent that they may in a more liberte serve god. For (as he
says) Innupta 1. Cor. 7.
curat ea / que sunt domini / vt sit sancta quum corpore tum spiritu. Contra.
q^ nupta est / curat ea / que su^t mu^di / quomodo placitura sit viro. That is
to say / she that is not married is myndful and studious / for tho things /
which perteyne to Christ: But contrary wise / she that is married / is
careful of the things / which belong unto the world / and studieth / how
she may please her husband. But the carnal doctrine of Luther no more
regards this counsel / nor this manner of e^creace / tha^ he does yt other
of virginite.

The third and the lowest degree of encreace of The fruit of marriage.
fruit is in ye state of marriage. The holy sacrament of matrimony preserves by
his virtue the works and deeds of them that be married / so that the works /
which without this sacrament should be dedly / be made by virtue of this
sacrament either to be no sin / or at the least but venial sin / so long
I say as they truly keep this sacrament / and use it accordyngly. In token
whereof our savior at a marriage changed water in to wine: thereby signifienge
that much of the waterynes of carnalitie between the married persons / by
virtue of this sacrament / is changed into the wine of merit. But this
encreace also is lost by the wicked doctrine of Luther: For he has now married
him self unto a nou^ne: A friar and a nounne together / can this be any good
marriage? No doubtless: which things shall appear by* iij. reasons. First for
because that he makes ye sacrament of matrimony to be no sacrament. A very mad
man / he to mary / and yet to affirm yt this sacrament has no virtue in it /
and yt directly against ye scriptures of god / and so makes as much as lies
in him / yt the virtue of this sacrament nothing profits / neither till him
self / neither to other yt be married / if they so believe as he techeth. But
their marriages as they use them (not beleuyng yt the sacrament has any virtue)
has nothy^g in them that is spiritual / but be full of carnalite without any
spiritualnes / full of wateryng without any verdours of merit / full of
sty^kyng weeds / without any good fruit at all. For as saint Paul says / Qui
seminat per carne^ sua^ / de carne metet corruptione^: Et qui seminat per
spiritu^ / de spiritu Gal. 6
metet vita^ eternal: Who yt sows by his flesh carnally / shall reap of his
flesh corruption: And he yt sows by the spirit / shall reap of his spirit
ye reward of everlasting life. But take away this holy sacrament / and doubtless
all the use of the bodies of them that be married is only carnal / which by
this sacrament is made in some manner spiritual / and takes by ye virtue
thereof a spiritualnes. For as much tha^ as Luther has destroyed this holy
sacrament / he can reap no good fruit of his marriage / but only carnal
corruption / and his marriage is no marriage.

The second reason is this. How can it be a good The second reason.
marriage / where one man abuses an other man's wife / specially wha^ he
medleth with her / which was consecrate the spouse of Christ? Among the
Jentils it was reputed abominable / for to abuse the virgins / which had
consecrate their virginite unto ye Idols. Much rather it should so be thought
among the christen people / to abuse the spouse of Christ / consecrate unto
him. Saint Mattheu when he was desired by a certain prince called Hirtacus /
that he should move a virgin named Ephegenia / which had before consecrate
her virginite to Christ / he made him this answer: Siregis spo^sam regis
seruus vsurpare voluerit / vinus tr^d^t incendiis: That is to say / if the
servant of a king would abuse the kings spouse / he were worthy to be
thrown quick in to the fire. He meant that if Hirtacus / which than was
christened / and should have been the servant of Christ / would covet to mary
that virgin / which was consecrate to Christ / as his spouse / he were worthy
to be brent. What suppose ye that this blessed apostel would say / if he now
were present here again / and herd this abominable deed / this carnally
disposed man / thus to abuse a religious virgin / which was consecrate the
spouse of Christ? O Jesus. How much would he aborre this matter? And what
dreadful sentence would he pronounce of such sudden ^uisement against this
heretic? The third reason is this. The third reason.
If we consider what promise this man had made be fore / and ye great strength
of yt promise / we shall well perceive / yt this second promise can have no
place. And why? For yt promise / which he made before was to keep his
chastity: this is clean contrary. That was a former promise: this promise is a
later promise / and that by many years latter. Third. that promise was for the
weal of his soul: this promise is made for the carnal pleasure of his body.
Fourth. that promise was made solemly and with a great deliberation: this
promise was made in a corner and of some short aduiseme^t: For with in vi.
wekes after the marriage / his woman had a child. This was spedy work / a
woman to have a child within. vi. wekes of her marriage. This must either be a
great miracle / orels they had met to gether before. That promise was made
according to the rules of holy religion / which was devised by the holy
fathers / and inspired by the spirit of god: this promise is made against all
good rulis / and by the carnal misordre of ye wretchedness of the flesh. That
promise was made accordy^g to ye cou^sailes of our savior Christ / saint Paul
/ and of the other apostles: this promise was made by the counsel of Satanas
/ and of all ye deuylles of hell. Finally. that promise was made unto god / and
he will not be mocked / as says saint Paul: Deus non irridetur: God is not to
be mocked. But it is a Sal. 6.
plain mockery / so solemly to promise unto god / and never the less to
break ye promise made. An honest man will look to keep his promise made unto
his neighbor / but much rather / if his promise be made unto almighty god /
he so should keep the same. When than that former promise was made to god / and
for the weal of his soul / and solemly by great deliberation / according to
the holy rulis of religion / and according to the counsayles of the holy
scripture / who sees not cuide^tly / that this later promise made unto a woman
/ with all contrary co^ditio^s to these above rehearsed / can have no place? For
the former promise is so strong that it disanulleth and debarreth quite this
other promise / which was later made. But here one will say: Sir / Luther saw
that it was impossible for him to conteyne him self. But I s^y again / that
Luther should have looked at that point / before that he made this promise to
god and before he entered holy religion. And here I would be answered of all my
masters the Lutherans in this one point / what life this heretic has lived
all these years before that he was married. If Luther might not co^teyne him
self now in his later days / when he is of more age and of elder years /
what life suppose ye that he lived in ye fervor and heat of his youth^* He
speaks much of hypocricy / but what hypocricy used he all this long time
that he was a friar / under his freers coote? If he did not than conteyne: What
abominations did he use in the lust of his youth / that now in his later
days may not live chaste? O Jesus who may think that any gracious and
frutfull knowledge of holy scriptures did enter and abpde in this man's breast
/ when it is written: In masiuosam animam non introihit saptentia / nec
habitabit Sap. 1.
in corpore subdito peccatis. We read of diverse that for the foul uncleanness
of their bodies / lost ye singular gift of the holy spirit / which they had
got before. Wherefore if this man led this abominable life before / and might
not conteyne him self / it is certain he has no frutfull knowledge of god /
nor of his holy scriptures. And so this excuse shall be rather his co^dempnation.
But if they say that he before contained. Than I say that he should so now
have done / specially being now of elder years / and a religious man / and a
preacher of the word of god. He should have chastised his body as saint Paul
did / saying: Ego castigo corpus mefi / ^. Cor. 9.
et in seruitute^ redigo / ne quum aliis predicauero / ipse reprobus inueniar:
I chastise my body / and subdue it / lest that when I shall preach to other /
I be found reprouable my self. Did not saint Paul suffer many temptations /
and assaults and brontes in his flesh? yes doubtless / and so he says him
self: But by ye chastiseme^t of his body / and by grace of god / he did
overcome them. And so this man should have done / he should have chastised his
body / by fasting / by watch / by prayer / and so by the help of grace / have
mortified his carnal desires.

Thus tha^ ye perceive (I suppose) clearly / that the doctrine of this most
peruersed heretic has neither the increase of the fruit after the hiest
degree of virginite: nor after ye mean degree of wydowhed: nor after the
lowest of matrimony: but yt the couplyng of him and of his mate to gyders is a
very brothelry / and a detestable sacrilege before the eyes of god / of both
these parties. So that I dare surely say / that all the stews less offe^deth
ye eyes of god / with their abominations / than does Luther and his mate /
with their double sacrilege.

Put now unto this / ye blasphemes and reproaches The blasphemes of Luther.
against almighty god / whereby he does impute unto god / that he should be the
auctour of sin: And that his co^mandementes be impossible to be kept.
Against our savior Christ / denyeng yt he by ye mouths of the fathers has
sown ye true ^^positio^ of the holy scriptures. Nor that he so was assistent
with his church / according to his promise. Against the holy ghost / that he
should (...) sufficiently instruct by the same fathers ye christen people / in
every troth perteyny^g unto ye faith of Christ. Against the blessed mother of
Christ / yt there should be no difference between her and other women / but yt
she was as synful as other be. Against the holy cross / that he would bre^ne
as many peates thereof as he might get. Agay^st the blessed saints / yt their
prayers help us not: and that they should not be honored upon us. Agay^st
certeyn^ books of scripture / namely ye gospel of Luke / and the Epistole of
saint James. Against ye other scriptures: who shall nombre the false
co^structio^s / ye wrong intpretatio^s / ye mischeuous errors / where by he
has corrupted ye holy scriptures of god? Against ye sacraments of Christis
church / all save twain / that is ye sacrament of ye altar / and baptyme. And
against the holy canon of ye mass. Against the doctrine of the holy fathers /
whose holiness was confirmed by many miracles / he clearly dispiseth both them
and their miracles. Against religion: who shall reken / how many religious
persons both men and women / which before were in ye high way of salvation /
that now by his pestilent doctrine / be become apostatas / and have forsaken
their order / and be returned unto ye carnal ways of the world / to their
peril and everlasting damnation? Against all them that be in souerayntie / as
well te^porall as spiritual / contrary to the plain doctrine of holy
scriptures. Against him self and his herers and folowers / intriky^ge and
snarlyng both him and them in so pestilent errors and heresies / to ye high
displeasure of god / that he has suffered them to tomble in mentem improbam /
that is to say / into a peruersed judgment / approuyng this wretched
carnalitie / wherein they now live. Against his own country / gyuyng occasion
by his most mischeuous doctrine to the subuersio^ of that country (which was
the flower of ye empire) by insurrections among them self: whereby many pyles
/ many castles / many great holds / many strong fortresses have been
overthrown and cast unto the ground / many temples / many famous monasteries
/ many noble houses of religion have been clearly destroyed / and such a
murdre of me^ / as in our days has not ben herd of in so short a time:
Doutles it is the hand and stroke of god upon them / for the favoring and
subporty^g of his most mischeuous doctrines: Such a murdre of men / as
credebly and faithfully is reported above an. C. thousand. This is ye fruit /
which is spronge of this most wicked sede. The sede of god in the good hearts
of true christen people works great encreace of gracious fruit. Contrary wise
/ the sede of the devil in the hearts of the Lutherans / works all mischefe
and corruption. I shall conclude (as I verily think) I believe / yt onles
Satanas were let lose out of hell / as in ye Apocalypsis it is promised / that
he should believed toward ye end of the world / so great a mischefe by one
man / withouten his counsel / cou(...) have been wrought.

Now my brethren / I would auise you so look well upon this matter / and not
so lightly to cast your soulis away by beleuy^g this doctrine of this most
pernicious heretic / which brings forth none e^crease of fruit after any
of these. u^. degrees above rehearsed / but much habundance of pest^^^, and
stynkyng weeds / of carnal corruption / of horrible blasphemes / of
detestable murders. Follow rather the doctrine of the church / by the which /
in the hearts of ye true christian people / springs / and aryseth / and
increases all these. iii. degrees ple^teously: so that by this doctrine ye may
also be restored to the clerenes of your sight / as was ye bly^d man / upon
whom our savior showed that great miracle before told. And now hens forward
(as that man did) follow ye Christ in the right way. For it is said there of
him: Confestum vidit / et sequebatur eum: He forth with had his sight / and
followed Christ. Do ye in like wise / and beware that ye return not in to
your old errors again / nor that ye look not back unto these heresies / nor
stop in the way by any wavering of your faith: but go forth right in
meritorious works / wherein the church walks / which has with them the
continual presence of Christ / and of his most holy spirit / that one to
sow this gracious doctrine / that other to give his influence with the same
unto the herers. And doubt not / but this way shall finally bring you unto
the glorious country of heaven / where ye shall have ye presence of almighty god
/ with endless joy and bliss: to the which he bring us all / Qui cum patre
et spiritu sancto viu^^ et regnat deus.

Amen.
