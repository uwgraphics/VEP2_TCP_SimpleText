Here begins the chorle and the bird.


PRoblemes of old lykenes and fygures.
Which prou^^n fructuous of sentence
And auct^^es grounded on scryptures
By rese^blaunce of notable appearance
with moralytes co^cludy^ge on prudence
Like as the nyble reherseth by writing
(...)s chose them sometime a king
First in their chose they named the olyue
To reygne among them (Iudiciu^) does express
But he him self began excuse belyue
He might not forsake his tatrenesse
Ne the fygge tree his amerous swetnesse
Ne the vine his wholesome tarage
Which gives comfort to all manner aege
And semblably poets laurente
By derke parables full conuenyent
Feign that birds and beestes of estate
As ryall egles and lions by assente
Sent out wryttes to hold a parlayment
And made decrets bryefly for to say
Some to have lordshyp and some to obey
Egles in the air highest make their flight
Power of lions on the ground is seen
Cedre among trees highest is of sight
And the laurere of nature is aye grene
Of flowers all Flora aye goddess and queen
Thus of all things there ben dyuersytees
Some of estate and some of low degrees
Poets write wonderful lyknes
And under couerte keep them self close
They take beestes and fowls to wytnes
Of whose faynynge fables first arose
And here I call to my purpose
Out of frensshe a tale to translate
Which in a paunflete I read and saw late
This tale which I make of mencyon
In groos rehearsed plainly to declare
Three proverbs paid for a raunson
Of a bird which was take in a snare
Wonder desirous to escape fro her care
Of mine auctours following the process
So as it befell in order I shall express
Sometime there was a small vyllage
As mine auctour makes rehercayle
A chorle which had lust and great courage
Within himself by delygent travail
To make a gardyn of rich entayle
Of length and bread like square and long
Hedged and dytched to make it sure and strong
All the aleys were made plain with sonde
The benche covered with new turues grene Chorle.
Sweet herbe^s with conduytes at the hand
That will it up again the son shene
Like silver stremes as crystal clean
The burbyll ways in their up boylynge
Round as beryll the bemes out showing
Mydde in the gardyn stood a fresshe lauryre
Thereon a bird singing day and night
With shynynge feathers bryghter than gold wyre
Which with her song made heavy hertes light
That to behold it was an heavenly sight
How toward even and in the dawenynge
She did her pain most amerously to sing
Esperus enforced strongely her courage
Toward even when Phoebus began to west
Among the branches to her advantage
To sing her complyne and than go to rest
And at rysynge of queen Alceste
To sing again as it was her dew
Erly on morrow the day sterre to salewe
It was a very heavenly melodye
Even and morn to here the birds song
And the sweet sugared armonye
Of vncoute werblys and tewnes draw alonge
That all the gardyn of the noise ronge
Till on morrow when Tytan shone clear
This bird was trapped and caught with a pantere
The chorle was glad when he this bird had take
Merry of chere of look and of vysage
And in all haste he purposed to make
Within his house a little preaty cage
And with her song to rejoice his courage
Till at the last the sely bird abrayd
And soberly thus to the chorle she said
I am now take and stand under dangere
Holden straight that I may not flee
A dieu my song and all my notes clear
Now that I have lost my lybertee
Now am I thrall where sometime I was free
And trust well while that I am in dystresse
I can not sing nor make no gladness
And though my cage forged were of gold
And the pynacles of berell and crystal
I remember a proverb said of old
Who leseth his fredome forsooth he leseth all
For I had lever upon a branch small
Merely to sing among the wodes grene
Than in a cage of silver bright and shene
Song in prison has none accordaunce
Trowest thou that I will sing in prison
Song proceeds of Joy and pleasaunce.
And prison causes death and destruccyon
Ryngynge of feters is no merry sown
Or how should he be glad or Iocounde
Again his will that lies in chains bound
What avails it a lion to be king
Of beests all shette in a toure of stone
Or an egle under streyte keeping
Called also king of fowls euerychone
Fie on lordshyppe when lyberte is gone
Answer herto let it not a sterte
Who syngeth meryly ye syngeth not at heart
And if thou will rejoice of my singing
Let me go fle far from all daungere
And every day in the morning
I shall repair upon thy laurere
And fresshely sing with lusty notes clear
Under thy chamber or before thine halle
Every season when thou list me call
To be shytte up and pynned under dread
Nothing accords unto my nature
Though I were fed with milk and wastell bread
And with cruddes brought to my pasture
Yet had I lever to do my besy cure
Erly on morrow to scrape in the vale
To find my dinner among the worms small
The labourer is gladder at the plough
Erly on morrow to feed him on bacon
Than some man is that has good enough
And all deyntes plente and foyson
And has no fredome with his possessyon
To go at large but as a bear at a stake
To pass his bonds but if he leave take
Take this answer for a full conclusyon
To sing in prison you shalt not me constrayne
Till I have fredome in wodes up and down
To flee at large on bows rough and plain
And of reason thou sholdest not dysdayne
Of my desire but laughe and have game
But who is a chorle he would each man were ye same
Well quod the chorle syeth it will not be
That I desire as by thy talking,
Maugre thy will thou shalt chese of three
Within a cage merely to sing
Or to the kechyne I shall thy body bring
Pull thy feathers that be bright and clear
And after roast or bake the to my sopere
Than said the bird to reason say I not nay
Touching my song a full answer thou have
And when my feathers plucked ben away
And my body roasted or baken in a paast
Thou shalt of me have a small repaast
But and thou will work by my counceyll
Thou may by me have a great auayll
If thou will to my reason assent
And suffer me go freely from prison
Without raunson or any other rent
I shall the ryue a notable guardon
Three great wysdoms according to reason
More of value take heed what I profre
Than all the gold that shytte is in thy cofre
Trust me well I shall the not dysceyue
Well said the chorle tell anon let se
Nay said the bird thou must before conceive
Who shall teache of reason must go fre
It sytteth a master to have his lyberte
And at large to teache his lesson
Have me not suspecte I mean no treason
Well said the chorle I hold me content
I trust thy promise that thou have made to me
The bird flewe forth the chorle was of assent
And took her flight upon the laurer tree
Than thought she thus now stand I free
With snares and panters I purpose not my live
Ne with no lyme twigs any more to strive
He is a fool that escaped is fro daungere
And has broke his feters and fled out of prison
Again to resort / brent child dredeth fire
Each man beware by wisdom and reason
Sugar strawed that hydeth false poison
There is no venym so peryllous of sharpness
As when it has of tryacle the likeness
Who dredeth no peril in peril he shall fall
Smoth waters ben oftyme deep
The quayle pype can most falsely call
Till the quayle under the net does crepe
A blere eyed fowler trust not though he weep
Eschew his thombe of weeping take none head
That small bird can nype by the head
And now that I such daungere am eschaped
Ilwyll beware and for a provide
That of no fowler I will no more be Iaped
Fro their lyme twigs I will flee fer a side
Where peril is peril is to abide
Come nere thou chorle and herke to my speech
Of three wysedomes that I shall the teache
Neue not of wisdom to hastily credence
To every tale ne to every tydynge
But conceive of reason and of prudence
Among many tales in many a lesynge
Hastily credence has caused great hyndrynge
Report of tales and tidings told of new
Makes many a man to behold untrue
For one part take this for my raunson
Learn the second grounded on scripture
Desire not thou by no condycyon
Thing which is Impossyble to recure
Worldly desires stand all in adventure
And who desires to clymbe high a lofte
By sudden turn falls often vnsofte
The third is this beware both eve and morrow
Forgete it not but learn this of me
For treasour lost make never to great sorrow
Which in no wise may recovered be
For who soroweth for loss in that degree
Reken first his loss and after his pain
Of one sorrow he makes sorrows twain
After this lesson the bird began a song
Of her escape gretely reioysynge
And remembered her also of the wrong
Done by the chorle first at her taking
Of her affraye and of her prysonynge
Glad that she was at large and out of dread
Said to him houynge above his heed
Thou were said she a very naturell fool
To suffer me depart of thy lewdnes
Thou oughtes of right complain and make dole
And in thyn heart to have great heaviness
That thou have lost so passing great riches
Which might suffyse by value in reckoning
To pay the raunson of a mighty king
There is a stone which called is a Iagonce
Of old engendered within mine entrayll
Which of fine gold peyseth an ounce
Cytryne of color like garnettes of entayll
Which makes men vyctoryous in battle
And who so ever bear on him the stone
Is full assured against his mortal fone
Who has this stone in his possessyon
Shall suffer no pouerte no none Indygence
But of all tresour have plente and foyson
And every man shall do him reverence
And enemy shall do him none offense
But from thyn hondes now that I am gone
Plain if thou will for thy part is none
It causes love it makes men gracyous
And favorable in every man's sight
It makes accord between folks enuyous
Comforts sorrowful makes heavy hertes light
Like to pasyon of color sonnysshe bright
I am a fool to tell all at ones
Or teache a chorle the pryse of precious stones
Men should not put a precious margaryte
As rubyes sapphires and other stones of ynde
Emerawdes and other perles white
Before rude swyne that love drafe of kind
For a sow delyteth as I find
More in draffe her pigs for to glade
Than in all the perry that comes out of garnade
Each thing draws to his semblable
Fysshes in the sea Bestes on the stronde
The air for fowls by nature is couenable
And to the plough man for to till the land
And to a chorle a dongforke in his hand
I lose my time any more to tarry
For to tell a chorle of lapydary
That thou had thou gettest no more again
Thy lyme twigs and panters I defye
To let me go thou were foul over seen
To lose thy richesse only of folly
I am now fre to sing and to fly
Where that me list and he is a fool at all
That is at large and makes himself thrall
To here of wisdom thine eeres ben half deef
Like an ass that lystneth on an harp
Thou may go pype on an yue leef
Better is to me to sing on thorns sharp
Than in a cage with a chorle to carpe
For it was said of folks years agone
A chorles chorle is often woo begone
The chorle felt his heart part on tweyne
For very sorrow and a sonder ryue
Alas said he I may well weep and plain
As a wratche never like to thryue
But for to endure in pouerte all my live
For of folly and of wylfulnes
I have now lost all hole my riches
I was a lord I cry out on fortune
I had great trasoure late in my keeping
Which might have made me long continue
With that stone to have lived like a king
if I had set it in a ring
Borne it upon me. I had good enough
I should than no more have gone to the ploughe
When the bird saw the chorle thus morn
And how that he was heavy of his chere
She took her flight and began again return
Toward him and said as ye shall here
O dulle chorle wysedomes for to lere
That I the taught all is left behind
Racyd away and clean out of thy mind
Taught I the not this wisdom in sentence
To every tale brought to the of new
Not to hastily give thereto credence
Unto time thou know that it were true
All is not gold that shows goldesshe hew^
Nor stones all be nature as I find
Be not saphyrs that show color ynde
In this doctrine I lost my labor
To teache the such proverbs of sustaunce
Now may thou see thy blind error
For all my body poysed in balaunce
Weyth not an ounce rude is thy remembrance
I to have more poyse cloysed in mine entrayll
Than all my body set for the counteruayll
All my body weyth not an ounce
How might than I in me have a stone
That peyseth more than a Iagonce
Thy brain is dulle thy wit is almoost gone
Of three wysdomes thou have forgoten one
Thou sholdest not after my sentence
To every tale to hastily give credence
I bad also beware both even and morrow
For a thing lost of sudden adventure
Thou sholdest not make to much sorrow
When thou see thou may not it recure
And here thou faylest which do thy curs
In thy snare to catch me again
Thou art a fool thy labor is in vain
In the third thou do crave
I bad thou sholdest in no manner wise
Coueyte thing that thou may not have
In which thou have forgone mine enpryse
Than may I say plainly to deuyse
Thou have of madness forgoten all three
Notable wysdomes that I taught the
The vyntener treats of holsom wynes
Of gentle fruit bosteth the gardyner
The fyssher casts out hokes and lines
To catch fysshe in every fresshe river
Of tylthe of land treats the bouer
The gentylman talks of gentery
The chorle delyteth to speak of rybaudry
All one to the fawcone and a kyte
As good an owl as a popyngaye
A ducke of the donghylle as deynte as a snyte
Who serves a chorle has many a careful day
A deu sir chorle fair well I fle my way
I cast me never hens forth my living
To fore a chorle any more to sing
Ye folk that shall this fable see or read
New forged tales I counseyll you to fle
For loss of good take never great head
Be not sorrowful for none aduersyte
Coueyte nothing that may not recovered be
And remember where every ride or gone
A chorles chorle is always woo begone
Unto purpose this proverb is full ryf
Read and reported by old remembrance
A chyldes bird and a knaves wife
Have often sith great sorrow and myschaunce
And who has fredome has all suffysaunce
Better is fredome with little in gladness
Than to be thrall with all worldely riches
Go little quayer and recommaunde me
Unto my master with humbly affection
Beseech him lowly of mercy and pity
Of thy rude making to have compassyon
And as touching thy translacyon
Out of Frensshe / how that it English be
All things is said under correccyon
With supportacyon of his benygnyte
AMEN
Here ends the chorle and the bird.
