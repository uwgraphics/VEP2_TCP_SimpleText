of Master John Parker lately deceased.

incessantly solicited, by diverse, who either had themselves heard, or from
others heard of, what was delivered at the enterrement of your late wor^hy
Consort, and either had known him in his life time, or taken notice of his
course of life then related, to make that more public, that was then uttered,
in the audience but of a few to speak of, and by reason of the lowness and
feebleness of my voice, of the fewer; I was at length overwrought (though
having formerly no such purpose) to condescend thereunto: the rather hoping
that his examplary course of life and carriage, with the good effect and
comfortable issue of it, might be a means, through Gods blessing working
together therewith, to invite, incite, allure and win others to the like.

they draw the more after them, either to good or to evil. And I may well
add, that a r^ligious rich man is likewise (witness blessed Job 1.10.
Job) a great Moat in the Devils Eye: not only because such an one, having his
heart enlarged answerably to his hand, may Job 29.13, 15, 16. and 31.16, 20.

without which they think wealth cannot possibly be compassed. Yea, let me add
in the third place, that a religious industrious man (and yet I see not well,
Ephesians. 4.28. 1 Timothy 5.8.
how they can be severed) is a great Moat in the Devils Eye. For that by his^
aven and wise practice such an one makes it manifest, that a man may well
serve God in a constant course, and yet follow also the duties of his special
calling; and that there is therefore no such necessity, as many, on either side
faulty, pretend, of neglect of the one, if the other be diligently attended;
but that 1 Cor. 7.20, 24. Vbi vo^atio duplex, in qa, ad qam
both of them may have their due time and place, without enterfering or
justling out either of other, as the 1 These. 4.11. 2 These. 3^7, 12.
rules both of reason and Religion require. The common, yea, almost general
abuse of the times, might well require me to add, that a sober and temperate,
as well as a religious (and yet Ephesians 5.18. Romans 13.13, 14^
what Religion can be, where excess reigns?) but yet, that a sober and
temperate Merchant or Tradesman, may well be reckoned among those Moates, that
disturb the common adversaries eye: since that by such it appears, that men
may have ordinarily, in orderly manner, mutual commerce, trade, and traffic
either with other, without (...), ut Athen. dipnos. l. 11. Persa^um ritu, qibus
(...). vid. Plut. Sympos. l. 7. c. 9.10.
beating every bargain they make over a Wine-pot, and concluding it with
brains equally distempered on either side. In these therefore and diverse other
respects, I supposed the example of this our worthy friend and faithful
servant of Christ might be useful to many: and was in that regard the rather
induced to satisfy the desire of those, that so instantly pressed me in it.
Which having once concluded on, I knew none fitter to address it to, then to
your self; who had chief interest under God in him, G^n. 2.24. 1 Cor. 7.4.
by Gods own ordinance, while he lived; and may with fairest title and plea lay
best claim to the memory of him now deceased. To you therefore, beloved in our
common Savior, I tender it to remain by you; for my self, as a monument of
mine entire a^fection to him, who is now with the Lord, and to his surviving
for him; for your self, as a memorial of what a precious Jewel it pleased
God sometime to possess you of, and to grace you with: yet not thereby to
renew your grief for your temporary loss of him, (if it may be so termed,
when he is but, as Philem. 15. Deside an^us ^s^ tibi, q^si absens, n^n q^si

THE DECEASE OF LAZARUS CHRIST'S Friend.
John, Chap. 11. Verse. 11. Our Friend Lazarus sleeps.
THey are the words of our Savior Christ, more covertly intimating that to his
Disciples, which presently after he tells them in plain terms; to wit,
Sum.
Lazarus his decease. And they need no curious Analysis; for the sentence is
but short; nor large explication; for there is nothing in them ambiguous, but
what our Savior himself in the words following explaineth.

In them we may consider; Branches 2.
1. The person spoken of: 1.
and 2.
2. His present estate and condition.


Branch 1.
The person spoken of is described; Person. his 1. Name.
1. By his name; Lazarus, or Ita Tertullian de idolatr. c. 13. and Prudent.
hymn^ de exeq. Vide Rigalt. ad Ter^.
Eleazer. For Drus. ad voc. Hebr. N.T^
all is one: and it ^ignifieth one whose aid God is. 2 Relation.
2. By his relation to Christ, and his Disciples. Our Friend.


Branch 2. Condition.
His present estate and condition is expressed in a Metaphore. He sleeps.
That is, as our Savior himself by and by after expounds it, Verse 14.
He is deceased, he is dead.

Points 5.
From the words thus opened, these Points of instruction offer themselves unto
us.

1.
1. That every faithful one is one of Christ's friends. 2.
2. That every friend of Christ, is a friend of those also that are Christ's. 3.
3. That Christ's friends dye as well as others. 4.
4. That death, to such especially, is but as a s^^epe. 5.
5. That this their friendship never fails: it surceas^th not in death, but
surviveth their decease.
Point 1.
And of these in order, as God shall enable, and the streights of time permit.

First then,

(...). Cl^m. pro^rep^. I^ter b^^^s viros and Deum amiciti^ est. S^nec. de
provid. cap. 1. q^nqam negare h^c videatur Arist. Eth. magn. l. 2. c. 11
Every faithful soul is a friend of Christ.

Every true Christian is one of Christ's Favorites. It is the usual style of
Abraham, ^om. ^.11.
the Father of the faithful; Gods friend. 2 Chronicles. ^0.7.
To Abraham thy friend: says Iehoshaphat to God. And, Es^y 41^^.
ye seed of Abraham my friend; says God to his people. And, James 2.23.
Abraham, says S. James, believed God; and he was called Gods friend. So here,
of Lazarus, a Son of Abraham, Christ's friend. Our friend Lazarus, says our
Savior. And to his Disciples elsewhere in general, Luc. 12.4.
I tell you, my friends. And, John 15.14.
ye are my friends. John 15.15. (...). Clem. S^rom. l. 2. (...). Ib. l. 7.
Potest ergo and servus esse and amicus, qi servu^ est bonus. Aug. in Joan. 85.
Qos amat, amicos habet, nonservos, amicus fit de magistro, neque enim amicos
discipulos diceret, si non essent. Bern in Cant. 59.
No more servants, but friends.

This will more clearly appear unto us, Reason 1.
if we shall consider, what the common nature of friendship or amity is.

Friendship is defined, (...). Arist. Ethic. Nicom. l. 8. c. 2. and l. 9 c. 5.
Amor, sive benevolentia mutua, non la^ens.
A mutual love manifested: or, more largely, A mutual love and affection
between party and party, manifested by some means from either to other. And
such is there between Christ and the faithful.

1. Branch. 1.
There is (...). Aristot. Rhetor. l. 2. c. 4. Amicitia est voluntas erga
aliquem rerum bonarum illius, ipsius causa qem diligit, cum ipsius pari
volun^ate. Cicer. de Invent. l 2.
a mutual love and affection required unto friendship. And such there is
between Christ and the faithful. For (...).
Christ loves them; and they love him.

He loves them. Ephesians. 5.28.
Christ loved his Church; says the Apostle S. Paul. And Apoc. 1.5.
to him that loved us; says S. John: and they love him. John 16.27.
My Father, says he, loves you, because you love me: and, 1 John 4.19.
we love him, says S. John, because he has loved us. And again, Prove. 8.17.
I love them, says he, that love me: and, John 14.21.
if any man love me, the Father will love him, and I will love him too. So that
Been igitur ratio accepti a^que expen^i inter nos conven^. Tu me amas, ego te
amo: merito id fieri ut^rq^e existimat. Plaut. Mostel. 1.3.
there is no love lost between Christ and his. Ej^s amor nostrum and praeparat
and remun^rat. Bern. de dilig. Deo. cap. 3. Et nostrum libenter, qem praecessit
subseqitur. Idem. Epistol. 107.
He loves them first: and they love him, because he loves them: and again,
he loves them the rather, because they love him. Sweetly therefore Bernard;
Nemo se di^^idat ama^i, qi j^m amat. Q^modo enim redamare pigebit, ^qi amavit
necdum ama^tes? Bernard. Epist. 107.
Let no man, whose heart can truly testify for him, that he loves Christ,
make any doubt but that Christ loves him. For how can he choose but love thee,
when thou love him, 1 John 4.10.
who loved thee then, when thou loved'st not him?

Branch 2.
2. Unto friendship is required, that this mutual love and affection between
party and party be manifested from either to other. And so is it also between
Christ and the faithful: the love and affection they bear either to other is
by them mutually made manifest from either to other. John 10.14.
I know mine, says our Savior, and am known of mine^ I know them, and they
know me. I know their love to me. John 21.15.
Lord, says Saint Peter to our Savior, thou know that I love thee. And 1
John 4.16.
they know my love to them. ^ Gal. 2.20.
He loved me, says the Apostle: and, we know, says Saint John, the love that
God bears to us. And, E^hes. 3.18, 19.
that with all the Saints, ye may know the love of Christ, says S. Paul
again. Yea, he has manifested his John 15.13. Romans 6.8.
matchless love to them, by what he has done and endured for them: by giving
himself for them, Ga^. 2.20.
He loved me, says the Apostle, and gave himself ^or me. And, Ephesians. 5.25.
Christ loved his Church, and gave himself for it: and making a bath of his
own heart-blood, to bath their souls in, for the curing and healing of them.
Ap^c. 1.5.
He loved us, says S. John, and washed us from our sins in his blood.
Besides that, he has given them his Spirit, for this very end, to Romans 5.5. 1
John 4.13.
seal up his love to them, and 1 Cor. 2.12.
to make them know what, out of his love to them, he both has done, and will
further do for them. And they manifest and testify their, though far meaner,
love to him, by their diligent observance of him, and dutiful obedience to
him; by John 14.15.21, 23.
keeping his Commandments, and John 15.14.
doing whatsoever he enjoyneth them.

Again, Reason 2.
there is a solemn league of amity between Christ and the faithful. Just
such as that between Jonathan and David. For as they 1 S^m. 18.3, 4. Q^modo
Glaucus and Diomedes in amicitiae ^ospit^litatisque mutuae ^esseram, (...).
Homer. ^l. (...).
to confirm that league of amity mutually between them, changed apparel one
with other: Jonathan took David's raiment and put it on him self; he took his
own garments and put them upon David; So our blessed Savior Christ has
changed apparel with us (a 2 Cor 8.9. (...).
sorry change indeed to him self, though advantageous to us) has taken and
put on himself our garments, not Heb. 1.16.
our nature alone, but even the sorry rags of it, Heb. 4.15. Romans 1.3.
our infirmities, by participation, and Esaias 53.4, 5, 6. 2 Cor. 5.21. 1 Pet.
2.24.
our iniquities also, by imputation, and he has taken his own raiment and put
it upon us, 1 Cor. 1.30.
the rich roabe of his merits, and the royal roabes of his holiness and
righteousness; Romans 3.24, 25.
by imputation, unto justification, the one; and John 1.16.
by participation, for our sanctification, the other.

Reason 3.
In a word, Heb. 3.14.
he has bestowed himself upon them; and 2 Cor. 8.5.
they have given up themselves unto him. So that Cant. 2.16.
he is not more his own now, then he is theirs: 1 Cor^ 3.23.
nor are they now more their own, then they are his. And what nearer or more
intimate amity can there be then this?

Use 1. for Information.
Now the Use hereof may first be for information, to inform us of the most high
and honorable estate and condition, of every faithful soul, of every true
Christian: he is a friend of God, he is a favo^rite of Christ. It is noted as a
special, yea a singular honor, in Zabud the Son of Nathan the Prophet, that
1 Kings 4.5.
he was the Kings, to wit, King Solomon's, friend. But behold Matthew. 12.42.
a greater then Solomon here: and a greater honor therefore then King Solomon's
favor was able to afford. Every true hearted Christian, be he never so mean,
be he never so contemptible in the eyes of the world, (for 1 John 3.2.
this dignity of theirs, worldly men cannot see, the world is not aware of) is,
John 15.15.
not a servant only, (and yet were that honor enough; it is that the Apostle
prefixeth before diverse of his Epistles, as a matter of no small credit to him,
Romans 1.1. Philip. 1.1. Tit. 1.1.
Paul a servant of Jesus Christ) but a friend and favorite of him who is Apoc.
19.16.
King of Kings, and Matthew. 28.18.
Lord of Heaven and Earth: then which what estate can be more high or more
honorable?

A second Use may be for exhortation, Use 2. for Exhortation.
to incite every one of us to labor to be of the number of those, whom this
dignity, belongs unto. Prove. 29.^6.
Many, yea Prove 19.6.
every one, says Solomon, seeks the face, (...)^ Facies pro f^vore and
gratia Hebraeis passim. Number. 6.25. Psalm. 4.6. and 80.3, 7, 19. and 105.4.
that is, the favor, of the Prince, of the Ruler. And indeed what will not men
do and endure, if there be any hope or possibility, as they conceive, of
success, to insinuate themselves into the favor of great ones? Creep on all
four, as 1 Samuel 14.13.
Jonathan to get up the Rock, Obsequio gr^ssare, -- and leniter in sp^m Arrepe
officiosus. Pers^a atque obdura: seu ^ubra canicula findat Infantes statuas,
seu pingri tentus omaso Furius hyber^a^ ca^a nive conspuit Alps. Flac. Sermon.
l. 2. Sat. 5.
debase themselves to the lowest and meanest services that may be, attend them
with neglect of their own affairs and themselves. And why should a man then
think any thing too much to do, too hard or harsh to endure, though it be to
Matthew. 16 24. Luke 9.23.
the denying, forsaking, and abandoning of himself, (as Matthew. 16.25.
there is no way indeed but this to save himself) Phil. 3.8.
for the indeering of Christ to himself, for the winding of himself into the
favor and friendship of Christ. For alas, what is the greatest favor of the
greatest Monarch in the World without this? or what is the greatest favor of
the greatest on earth unto this?

For first, Difference 1.
Princes favors are fickle. A man may be in favor to day, and out of favor
the next day: and so (...). Qui summus body cr^s futuru^ nullu^ est.
aloft now, and as low as the lowest to morrow; yea, or sooner then so.
Lubricu^ est secundu^ ^pud regem l^cus.
The second place in Court, said Plati^^ in P^^. 2.
AEneas Sylvius sometime, is a slippery place. Yea, as it is Aul^ cul^en
lubricum. Senec. Thyest.
slippery, so they that hold it, if they slip and fall (as Confragosa in
fastigium dignitatis via est. Non in lubrico tantum illic statur, sed in
praerup^o. Sen. Ep. 82. and de tranq. c. 10. Quae excelsa videntur, praerupta
sunt. (...). Plut. Symp. l. 2. c. 1.
soon they may) Psal^ 73.15, 18.
they come down with a witness, (...). N.Q. apud Stob. c. 105. -- Ex alto
magna ruina venit. Catale^^. Vi^gil. Et gravius summo culmi^e missar^unt.
Maximin. Eleg. 1.
they fall heavy; their downfall is very dismal and dreadful. We have an
example of it in Est^er. 5.11.12. and 7.9.10.
Haman: I cannot stand to relate it: you may when you will, read it. Yea, I
need not to relate it. For who is ignorant of it, that has read, or heard read
or told the story of Queen Esther? And this may befall those that are in
favor with Princes, though they be never so faithful unto them, never so
careful to please them. But Christ's favor is not fickle: it is constant, it
is permanent. John 13.1.
Whom he loves once, he loves ever. Do thou Deuteronomy. 4.4.
cleave close to him; and he will never leave thee: Apo^. 2.10.
be thou faithful to him; and Heb. 13.5.
he will never forsake thee, Psalm. 89.32.
he will never break his faith with thee.

Difference 2.
Again, Princes favors are no sure shelters. The greatest favorite may be
slain in his Sovereigns eye, at his Sovereigns feet. Alas, Psalm. 146.3, 4.
how can they save them, when they cannot secure themselves? Dominus est vitae
tuae^ qisqis contempsit suam. Sen. Ep. 44.
Any one is Lord of their life, who sets light by his own life; unless the
Lord be pleased to protect and afford them shelter against such. But Christ's
favor is a sure shelter. For Esaias 63.1.
he is able to save; Psalm. 68.20.
to give issues against death; Ier. 1.19.
to preserve his from death; to protect them so in death; that John. 8.51.
though they dye, yet they shall not dye; though Luke 21.16.
they be slain, yet there shall Luke 21.18. ^t Acts 27.34. 1 Samuel 14.45. ^
Sam. 14^11. 1 Kings 1.52.
not an hairs harm befall them; and to save them everlastingly after death.
For Heb. 7.25.
he lives for ever, to save perfectly all those that be his.

A third Use may be for comfort, Use 3. for Consolation.

not be denied thee, nor detained from thee, Psalm. 34.10. and 84.11.
when thy necessity shall require them, and they may be for thy good. For well
may thou reason here, as the Apostle of God; Romans 8.32. (...). Chrysostom. in
Romans Hom. 15.
He that spared not his Son, but gave him up for us, how much more will he
give us all things together with him? So of Christ; He that spared not
himself, but has given up himself for me, has bestowed himself upon me,
has not denied himself to me, how can he refuse to afford with all unto me,
whatsoever shall be requisite, either for my support here, or for mine eternal
welfare and salvation hereafter?

2. For matter of protection. Branch 2. for Protection.
Have thou Christ to friend? Thou may well reason, as the same Apostle does
in the same place, Romans 8.31.
If God be with us; so, if Christ be with us, (for Romans 9.5.
Christ also is God) who shall be against us? as, Si Deus co^^ra nos, qis pro
nobis? Petr. Cellen. ep. 23. lib. 6.
if he be against thee, who can be for thee? so, Qid tibi malipoteri^ nocer^?
aut qid tibi boni poterit deesse, si ^lle te diligi^, qi de ^ihilo cuncta
cr^avit? Bern. in Caen. Dom. Qid timendum, si adsit nobis, qi purtat omnia?
Hebr. 1.3. Idem in Psalm. 90 conc. 1.
if he be for thee, who can be against thee? And thou may therefore, having
Christ to friend, say confidently with the Psalmist, Psalm. 27.1
The Lord is my light, and my salvation, whom should I fear? or of what should
I be afraid? as long as he provideth for me, Psalm. 23.1. Hebr. 13.6.
I shall be sure to want nothing: as long as he protecteth me, I need not to
fear any thing. Psalm. 23.3.
Though I walk, says he, through the vale of deadly shade, I will fear
nothing, so long as thou art with me. Vbi enim aut ^ecum male, aut sine (...)
been esse poterit^ Bern. in advent. 1. (...). Plut contr. Epicur.
For where can a man be in safety without Christ? or where can he be but in
safety with Christ?

Use 4. for Caution.
A fourth Use may be for Caution, to dissuade, yea, and deter men^ from
opposing or wronging any of the faithful. 2 Samuel 18.12.
How fearful are men usually of offending a favorite? But all the faithful
are Christ's favorites. 2 Cor. 11.28, 29. (...) Plut. de mul. amic.
How chary are men of the credit, welfare, contentment, safety, and indemnity
of their friend? even as chary as of their own; yea, or more. What is more
usual, then when we hear a friend traduced, or threatened, to say, ^ Romans
16.4. 2 Cor. 7.3. and 12.15. Phil. 2.17. (...). Plato^ in Symp. (...). Eurip.
Iph. Taur. Dionysio caput Platoni ^bla^u^^ ^i^i^ami, m^^n prius, inqit Xenoc.
L^eri, l. 4.
speak what you please of me; but forbear my friend: do what you will to me;
but meddle not with my friend? And is not Christ think we, as chary, and as
regardfull of those that be his? Yes undoubtedly. These are those, in behalf
of whom he gives warning, and orieth, hands off; saying, Psalm. 10^.15.
Touch not mine anointed ones. It is spoken 1 Samuel ^4.7. and 26.9.11.
of Kings, and that 2 Samuel 22.51. Psalm. 18.50. and 21.7.12.
in a special manner, and Psalm. 105.14.
unto Kings there in their behalf: as Ch^ysost. Theod. Euthymius, Aug. Prosp.
Hugo Card, Lyran. in loc.
the Ancients generally expound it. Does thy conscience then tell thee; that
such an one though never so poor a wretch, never so mean an abject, is a
faithful soul, a good Christian, one that sincerely fears God, one that
truly loves Christ? Matthew. 18 10.
take heed how thou wrongest him. Thou shall be sure to hear of it again at
one time or other, if thou do. He has Christ to friend: he is one of
Christ's favorites, Zech. 2.8. Psalm. 17.8.
as dear unto him, as the very apple of his eye. Ier. 2.3. Matthew. 18.6.
Nor will he suffer any wrong offered in word or deed, unto any of his, to go
unrighed, or unrevenged.

A fifth use may be for trial and examination. Use 5. for Examination.
Hereby then thou may try thy self, whether thou be a friend of Christ,
or no, and one that has Christ to friend. (For 1 John. 2.4. Frustra nobis in
^o plaudimus, cujus mandata non implemus. Hieron. ad Iovi^. l. 2. Neque enim
Christianus esse videtur, qi Christiani nominis opus non agit, cum nomen sine
act^ atque officio su^ nihil sit. Salvia^. l. 4 c. 1

Aug. Ep. 171. Christiani in contum^liam and opprobrium Christi. Salvian. l. 4.
c. 11.
There are some that so walk; and of professed Christians he speaks; that
they are enemies to Christ's Cross, and to Christ himself consequently) If
thou be a Lazarus; one that make Psalm. 70.5.
God, not the World thine aid, and thy stay. If thou be an Abraham; or
Luke. 19.9.
a child at least of Abraham; one that Romans 4.12. Gal. 4.12. Romans 4.16. Eorum
enim filli dicimur, qorum m^res imitamur. Orig. in Ezekiel. 16^ Vide Iuvenal. Sat.
8.
walk in the steps of the faith of Abraham, y who is the father of all the
faithful.

But these things, you will say, are too general. Use 6. for Admonition.
We will descend therefore to some particular notes in our ensuing discourse.
And so pass we to the sixth and last Use of this Point: which shall be for
Admonition, to admonish us of the duties required of all those that profess or
pretend to be in friendship and amity with Christ. Prove. 18.24.
He that has a friend, says Solomon, must carry himself friendly. If thou will therefore have a friend of Christ, thou must be Christ's friend, (for
friend and friend are Correlatives) thou must carry thy self as a friend unto
Christ.

Duties 4.
How is that? you will say.

Duty 1. Faithfulness.
First, thou must be faithful and loyal to Christ. For Prove. 20.6^
faithfulness is especially required of friends, and regarded in friendship.
Apoc. 2.10.
Be thou faithful, says he, unto death. Nor speaks he of the faith that we
Qam habe^us in Christum.
repose and put in him, but of the faith that we Qam pr^sta^u^ Christo.
yield and perform unto him.

Notes 2.
But when are we faithful unto Christ?

Note 1.
I answer. First, when we keep our heart and affections loyal and true to him,
not suffering James 4.4. 1 John 2.15, 16.
this wicked world, or any sinful lust (for these be the 2 Samuel 15 6.
Absoloms that filch our hearts from this our David) to sway in our souls; nor
our affections to be so set upon any outward thing, even such as we may
lawfully love, Matthew. 10.37.
father or mother, husband or wife, child, friend, or acquaintance, or ought
else whatsoever, that it should either 1 Kings 11.1, 4.
withdraw our affection from Christ, or minish our love unto Christ, or Luke
14.26.33.
that we should not be willing to relinquish it for Christ, if either Licet
pa^vulus ex c^llo pe^d^at nepos, licet sparso crine and ^usis v^stibus, ubera
qibus ^e nutrierat, ma^^r ostendat, licet in limine pater jaceat, p^r calcatu^

est, in hac re esse crudelem, Hier. ad Heli^d^r.
it shall stand between Christ and us, or he shall be pleased to require it
from us.

Secondly, Note 2.
then are we faithful to Christ, when we are affected as he is; when we love
what he loves, and hate what he hates. For Idem ^elle and nolle, ^a demum

what is true friendship, but when men will and nill the same things? Psalm.
97.10.
Ye that love the Lord, says the Psalmist, hate that that is evil. Whereupon
Augustine; Amas Deum? debes odisse qod odit. Aug ib.
Do thou love the Lord? thou must hate what he hates. So art thou, or
would thou be Christ's friend? thou must love what he loves; and hate what
he hates. And what loves he? Psalm. 11.7. and 45.7.
He loves piety, purity, mercy, charity, humility, sobriety, upright dealing,
and the like. And on the other side, Prove. 6.16.19. and 8.13.
he hates profaneness, uncleanness, unmercifulness, uncharitableness,
haughtiness, drunkenness, intemperance, falsehood, unjust dealing, and the
like. If then thou Zech. 8.19. Amos 5.15.
love, affectest, and labourest in the former, not so much because they
conduce and are consentaneous to humane society, (for so one may do that is no
friend to Christ or Christianity) as because Christ 1 John 3.22.
likes and loves them, and they make thee 1 John 3.3, 7. and 4.17. Luke 6.35,
36.
like unto him: and Prove. 8.13. Amos ^.15. Rom 12.9.
hate the latter, not so much because they are contrary to civil society, as
because Christ Zec^. 8.17.
hates them, and they make unlike unto him, Colos. 1.10.
whom thou desire to please, and to approve thy self unto; yea, whom thou
endeavourest 1 Cor. 11.1. Ephesians. 5.1. (...). Marcus Imper. ^p. Julian. in
C^sar^ (...). Just. ad Diog^ (...). Gr. Nys. de profes. Christ.
to imitate, and strivest to be Romans 8.29. Phil. 3.10. (...) Marcus Imp. l. 10.
c. 8.
like unto: knowing that (...). Plat. leg. l. 4. (...). Plat. ib. l. 8. (...).
Idem Lysid. qod and Arist. Eth. l. 9. c. 3. (...).
likeness breeds further liking and love: thou art then a true friend to
Christ indeed. But on the other side, if thou can not brook or abide, but
hate the former, which he loves; and love and delightest in the latter,
which he hates and abhors; it is certain, there is I^ter dispares ^nim
mores non potest esse amicitia. Ambr. offic. lib. 3. c. 16. In tanea morum
discordia, qae potest esse concordia? ^ier. ad Nepot. (...). Plato Phadr. Clem.
Strom. l. 5. and Eusebius. praep. l. 13. c. 13.
no friendship between Christ and thee, whatsoever thou may profess or
pretend to the contrary.

Duty 2. Observance.
Secondly, if thou will show thy self a friend to Christ, thou must diligently
observe him. Friends, we see, are careful to observe either other. Especially,
if a meaner person have some great man to friend, how careful and sedulous
will he be to observe and attend upon such an one? And it is expected he should
so do. So we find in story, that it was the manner of those among the Romans
that enjoyed the favor of any great ones, Mane salut^tum venio, tu diceris
ante isse salutatum. Martia. l. ^. Ep. 1^. Nec venit inanis rustici^^
salutator. idem. l. 3. Ep. ^8. Mercenari^^ salu^^tor circ^^volitat limi^^

to repair to them every morning, (that was Prima salutan^es at^ altera (...)
art^ l. 4. ^p. 8.
the first work they did, and (...) c^^re^e, cu^ pr^t^r li^^orem i^pell^t, and
ire pr^^^pite^ ^ubeas^ (...) Ne prior (...) 3.
strived who should first do it) attend upon them so soon as they came forth,
and tender themselves and their service unto them. In like manner, do thou
desire to maintain friendship with Christ? thou must diligently and constantly
attend upon him in his ordinances, in public, in private: Psalm. 2^.8. ^ 27.4^
and ^2.2. and 84.2^ and ^22.^^^
repair frequently to his house; attend at his threshold: ( Prove. 8.34. Psalm.
84.4.
he is a blessed man that so does) Col. 3.16.
invite him often to thine house: Luke 19.5. John 14.23.
he is not dainty of repair to the meanest of his: Io^n 1.12. Luke 10.38, 39.
he is willing to be entertained of us; and Prove. 8.31.
delights in such invitements: especially take heed, how, when Apoc 3.20.
he knocks at the door of thine heart by the ministry of his Word or the
motions of his Spirit, thou either refuse or neglect to open unto him. Ca^t
^5.2.6.
Such an oversight the Spouse committed, and she smarted for it, it cost her
full dear. And Exclusit. red^am? Ter. ^u^. 1.1
such unkindnesses often make shrewd breaches between friends. Yea take heed of
intermitting and letting fall thine usual and wonted resorts. (...). A^istot.
Ethic l. 8. c. 5.
Intermission of intercourse breeds strangeness between friends And such
intermission of spiritual intercourse; may, though not cut off all amity, yet
breed no small strangeness between Christ and thy soul.

Thirdly, Duty. 3. Obedience.
our friendship with Christ must appear, as by our diligent observance of him,
so by our constant obedience to him. John 14.15^21, 23, 24. Proba^io
dilectionis ex^ibitio est operis, de dilectione conditoris m^ns and vita
reqiratur, nunqam o^iosus est amor Dei, operator si est; sin operari renuit,
amor non est^ Greg. in Evang. 10. and Be^n. de temp. 106. and can. Dom. q. 8.
If a man love me, says our Savior, he will show his love to me by keeping
my Commandments. And, John 15.14.
you are then my friends, and manifest your selves so to be, when you do what I
enjoyne you. Yea then indeed do we show our selves, to esteem Christ our
friend, and carry our selves toward him as toward a friend, 1 John. 5.3. Nil
grave aut miserum est mihi, Qod re (...) voluisse: ^u tant in impera. Oedipus
Antigonae in Thebaid. ^. Minor huic est labor jussa exeqi, qam mihi j^bere:

ideo gravis est; aut di^^git, and gravis esse non po^est. Aug. de not. and
great. cap. 69.
when his Commandments seem not harsh and grievous unto us: when Ephesians. 6.5,
7.
with heart and goodwill we serve the Lord Jesus, either in that we do for him,
or for others at his request. That which a man does lumpishly and heavily for a
mere stranger, the same yet he does readily and (...). Liban. orat. 11. Non
sunt onerosi labores amantium, sed delectant ipsi. Julian. de viduit. c. 21.
Nonsentiunt amanies, qod laborant. Sed tunc ab eis plus laboratur, q^ndo a
labor qisque prohibetur. Aug. de Matthew. 16.24.
cheerfully for a friend. And that is it, that makes Matthew. 11.30.
Christ's yoke seem so easy, and his load so light to his, that Non omnibus
sunt onerosa tolerantibus, sed tolerare nolentibus, gravia vel levia facit
animus tolerantis. Sicut nihil est tamleve, qod ^i grave non sit, qi invitus
facit: sic ^ihil est tam grave, qod non ei, qi id libenter exeqitur, leve esse
videatur. Salvian. de provid. l. 1. c. 2. Facit praeceptum liber, qi facit
libens. Aug. de great. Chr. l. 1. c. 13.
seem so unweldy and so unsupportable to others.

Duty 4. Patience.
Lastly, it must appear, as in matter of Obedience, so in matter of Patience;
as in constant doing, so in patient enduring any thing whatsoever for him, even
Luke 14.26, 33.
to loss of liberty, limme, livelihood, and life it self too. For what would
not a man do or endure for a dear friend? Or what has he not done and endured
for us? Yea, appear it must, not in patient only and quiet, but in willing and
cheerful enduring, undergoing and going through with, whatsoever we may be
called to suffer and sustain for his sake. Genesis 29.18.
Jacob, though he served for Rachel some term of years, an Gen^ 31.38.42.
hard s^rvice under an harsh Master; by day parcht with the heat, and by night
nipt with the frost, yet he went cheerfully through with it, and Genesis 29.20.
Amanti enim nihil difficile. Cicer. de orat. perfect. Qid grave n^n leviter
tolerat, qi amat? Greg. in 1 Reg. 12.
those many years seemed unto him but as a few days, because he loved her. So
of the Apostles, Peter and John, two of Christ's faithful friends, it is said,
that when they had been in the Jewish Consistory, not rated and reviled, nor
threatened only, but Act^ 5.40.
beaten also, Ac^s 5.41.
they went away rejoicing, that they (...). Oxymoron ^l^gantissimum. C^s^ub.
were graced so much as to be disgraced for Christ. And, Romans 5.3.
we, not rejoice only, but even (...).
glory, in our afflictions; says S. Paul, another of Christ's friends, and that
in the name of the rest; Romans 5.5.
because the love of God Romans 8.39.
in Christ, and so Romans 8.35.
of Christ, is shed into our hearts by the Spirit that is 1 Cor. 2.12. 1 John
3.24.
given unto us.

In a word, what we do or endure for him, must come freely from us. Amor
Affectus est, non contractu^. Ber^. de dilig. Deo. Amicitia non est vectigalis,
sed liberalis: virtus enim, non qastus est. Amb. Offi. l. 3. c. 16 and Cas^io.
de amic. c. 2. Multum a beneficio distat negotiatio. Cleanth. Sen. de benef. l.
6. c. 13.
Friendship, as love the ground of it, is a free affection; not a trade or
traffic for lucre and gain. (...). Arist. Ethic. l 8. c. 5. and ibid. l. 9.
c. 4. (...). Idem. Rhet. l. 2. c. 4.
That is done by a man ^reely, that is done for his friend; it is done as for
(...). Marc. Imp. l. 7. Sect. 13. (...). Ib. Sect. 32 (...).
himself: his friend (...). Arist. Eth. l. 9. c. 4. Amicus alter ipse. Amb.
desp. l 2. c. 7.
being to him as himself. Benefi^iorum simplex est ratio, erogantur, non
computantur. S^n. de benef^ l. 1. c. 2. Interitura ^st rei ^a^tae dignitas, si
beneficium me^cem facimus. lb. l. 3. c. 14^ Beneficium virtutis est; and

suum, i^lud non est beneficium, sed soenus. Ibid. l. 4. c. 3. Non est
beneficium qod in qastum mi^^i^ur, hoc dab^. hoc rec^piam, auctio est. Ib. c.
14.
We must not stand to demand, or forecast with our selves, as those profane
ones in Job 21.15.
Job, What shall I get or gain by what I do or endure? What shall thou gain
by it? say thou? It is gain sufficient, and so art thou to esteem it, that
thou may do Christ any service. A singular precedent have we of this
freeness of disposition in that Acts 9.16.
choice vessel S. Paul: Phil. 1.20, 21.
I care not what become of me, says he, so that Christ be magnified in me, be
it by life or by death. For all the gain that I aim at both in li^e and
death, is Christ: that is, to do service unto Christ, to bring glory unto him,
as that D. Ayray in loc.
Reverend Doctor of ours rightly expounds it. Yea as the Apostle, I may well
say, expounds himself, where he tells those of Ephesus at his taking leave
of them, Act^ 20.22, 23, 24.
that he was going to Jerusalem bound thither by the Spirit, not knowing what
might befall him when he should come thither: and howsoever from the Holy Ghost
he was every where told, that bonds and afflictions there aboade him; yet did
none of these things trouble him, nor was his life dear unto him, he regarded
not what became of him, so he might joyfully finish his course, and discharge
the work of his Ministry committed to him by Christ. That was all he de^ired,
and all that he aimed at, to do service to his Savior, to finish cheerfully
his task assigned him by him. And the like disposition who so can find in
himself, may assure himself that he is a true friend to Christ, and may build
upon it, that he has Christ to friend.

And thus much for the first Point, that Every faithful one is Christ's friend.

The second follows, that Every friend of Christ, Point ^.
is a friend also to those that be his.

Lazarus, says our Savior, not my friend, but our friend, mine and yours too:
as well mine as yours, and yours as mine. And 1. John 1.3.
the communion, or society, says S. John, which you have with God and Christ,
ye have also with us.

And so it must needs be. For,

1. John 17.21.
All the faithful are one, Reason. 1.
as in Christ, so with Christ. They are Ro^. 12.4, 5.
all members of one and the same Christ's mystical body; 1 Cor. 12.12. Caput
and corpus, unus est Christus. Aug. de Trinit. l. 4. c^ 9. and in Psalm. 45. and
de verb. Dom. 49. and 65. and de temp. 40. Bern. Ep. 190. Beda in Joan. 17.
Omnes sancti and fideles cum h^mine Christo sunt unus Christus. Aug. de pec.
mer. and rem. l. 1. c. 31.
the head and the whole body making up but one Christ. Nor can a man be a
friend ^o the head, that is an enemy to the heart or the hand, yea to the heel
or the toe, to the lowest and meanest member of the body. Acts 9.4, 5. Non
potest concordiam habere cum Christo, qi discordare voluerit cum Christiano.
August. de verb. Dom. 57.
Nor can he be in amity with Christ, who is at enmity with any member of that
body, whereof Christ is the head.

2. (...). A^ist. Rhet. l. 2. c. 4.
He that has a friend must be a friend not to him alone, Reason 2.
but to his friends also. He therefore that is a friend to Christ, must be a
friend also to them that are Christ's friends; and such are all the faithful;
as has formerly been showed.

The Use whereof may be,

First, to admonish u^ of our duty. Use 1. for Admonition.
Do we profess our selves to be of the number of Christ's friends? We must then
be friends also to those that be his. We must show our love to him by our
friendly disposition and carriage toward them; and that,

1. In affection. Branch 1. Affection.
We must have Romans 12.16. Compatiamur affectu. Ambr. Offic. l. 3. c. 16.
a sympathy, a fellow feeling, and fellow like affection with them. (...).
Arist. Eth. l. 9. c. 4. and Rhe^. l. 2. c. 4. (...).
Friends rejoice in the good one of another, 2 Cor. 2.3.
as in their own; they (...).
grieve for the evils one of another, as for their own: and Romans 12.15.
so must thou, yea so will thou, if thou be a friend of Christ, Esaias 66.10.
(...)
rejoice with his when they have occasion of joy, 2 Cor. 2.2. (...) Eurip. ^p^.
Aul.
weep with them, when they have occasions of grief. Yea so it is with the
members, as of the natural, so of this s^irituall body, 1 Cor. 12.26.
if any one be honored, all rejoice ^^^h it; 2 Cor. 11.29. Heb. 10.34. and
13.3.
if any one be afflicted, all sorrow and suffer with it. But how can we rejoice
in the good of our Christian brethren, when we 1 Cor. 13.3.
envy their welfare? How can we grieve with them in their grief, when we our
selves Romans 14.15, 1 Cor. 6.8.
grieve them, or are Psalm. 119.158. 2 Cor. 2.5.
causes of grief to them.

Branch 2. Action.
2. In action: we must show our love unto Christ by doing good unto them. Psalm.
16.2.
O Lord, says David, thou art my God, Acts 17.25. (...). Eurip. Herc. f^^.
Clem. Strom. l. 5. Plut. de Stoic. Contradict. c. 37. Ipse est Deu^ tuu^, qi
^o^ eget bonis tuis. Aug. in Ps. 80. Nec ille collat^ eget, nec nos ei qic^am
confer poss^mus. Senec. de ^^^^f. l. 4. ^. 9.
thou have no need of me; all my goodness, or well-doing, cannot reach unto
thee. Ps. 16.3.
But unto thy Saints that are here upon earth, to such as excel in grace and
virtue, my desire and delight is to be doing good unto them. What I would, but
cannot do unto thee, that for thee I do to them. So here, Acts 3.21.
Christ indeed himself is in Heaven; nor can ought we do reach to him, nor
has he need of it himself. But in his stead he commends unto us his poor
limbs here on Earth. Mat. 26.11.
Me have you not always with you; but my poor^ members you have, and you may
do them good when you will. Non eget miseria, sed eget misericordi^: non eget
deitate pr^se; sedeget pietate pro suis. Salvian. cont. avar. l. 3.
Yea though he wants not himself, yet he suffer^th want in them. Mat. 25.35,
36, 42, 43. An non ege^, qi esurire, ^i sitire se qeritur^ Salv. ib. (...).
I was, says he, naked, and a thirst, and a hungry, and sick, and restrained:
and, Matthew. 25.40, 45.
whatsoever is done to them, it is done to him, and whatsoever is denied unto
them, it is denied unto him.

And hereby therefore we may well try and examine our selves, Use 2. for
Examination.
whether we be indeed, as we profess, true friends unto Christ; if we show our
love to Christ, by Ga^. 6.10. 1 John 3.17, 18.
our beneficence and well doing to those that be Christ's. Which if we fail in,
we fail in truth of affection to him, whatsoever we may pretend. For as the
Apostle reasons, John 4.20.
How can he love God, whom he never saw, that loves not his neighbor, whom he
daily sees? So, how can any man say he is a friend to Christ, whom he never
conversed with, if he show no friendship to such members of Christ, his
Christian brethren, with whom he daily converseth?

Besides that, Use 3. for Consolation.
it may be a comfort to every sincerely faithful soul, that every true
Christian is his friend; and he has interest therefore both in the 1 Cor.
12.7, 25.
parts, and in the Romans 1.9. Ephesians. 1.16. Colos. 1.3. 2 Cor. 1.11.
prayers of all the faithful, a great stay to a Christian soul, when it
cannot satisfy it self with its own suits. Yea, that it has a stock going
with them every where: though it have little of its own. But I hasten.

The next Point is, Point 3.
that

Christ's friends dye as well as others. James 2.23.
Abraham Gods friend: and yet John 8.52. Genesis 25.8.
Abraham is dead. Amos 3.7. John 15.15.
The Prophets Gods favorites: and yet Zech. 1.5. John 8 52.
the Prophets are dead too. Lazarus Christ's friend: and yet Verse. 14.
Lazarus is dead. The Apostles Luke 4.4^
Christ's friends: and yet 2 Timothy 4 6. 2 Pet. 1.14.
the Apostles are dead. Yea, John 21.20.
the beloved Disciple, Christ's John 13.23, 24.
chief favorite is dead. For John 21.23.
Christ did not say, that he should not dye.

And no marvel. For, Reason 1.
1. They are made (...). Cle^. Strom. l. 2. Job 6.12. (...). Chrysostom. de
Compunct. (...). Greg. Naz. pro^aup.
of the same mould that others are: though they be possessed of precious
treasure, yet 2 Cor. 4.7.
is it but an earthen vessel that the same is contained in. Reason 2.
2. They are subject to the like casualties that others are. For Eccle. 9.2.
Cuivis po^est accidere, qod cuiqam potest. P. Syrus.
all things here come alike unto all; to the good and the bad, the pure and the
impure: to Christ's friends, and Christ's foes. Reason 3.
3. They are by their natural condition and constitution, as Esaias 40.6, 7. 1
Pet. 1.24, 25.
the grass; which though it be not cut down, yet will wither of it self.


Objection.
Yea, but as the Jews reasoned, when they saw John 11.35.
Christ weep at Lazarus his grave, John 11.36.
Behold how he loved him: say some of them. And again other some, John 11.37.
Could not he that made the man borne blind to see, have caused that this man
should not have dyed? As if they had said, If he John 11.5.
loved Lazarus so, Solution.
why did he suffer him to dye, whom he could have saved from death? So may some
say, If the faithful be Christ's friends, why does he suffer them to dye? when
as Dan. 3.17. John 21.22.
he might, if he pleased, deliver them from death?

Reason 1.
I answer. 1. Because it is for their good. For they dye, Apoc. 14.13.
to rest from their labors; to be Romans 6.7. Qod a malo liberat, qis non bonum
pronunciabit? Tert. Scorp. c. 5.
rid of sin; to be 2 Cor. 5^4. Excutitur morte ve^ernus mortis. mors morte
dissolvitur; vita a^fer^n^^ confertur. Tert. ib. (...). An^^^han. Moriar?
desi^a^ m^ri posse. S^^. Ep. 24.
freed from death; to 2 Timothy 4.8.
^eceive the reward of their well doing; to 2 Cor. 5.8.
go to God; to Phil. 1.23.
be with Christ.

2. It is according to their own desire that they so do. Reason 2.
Their desire with Luke 2.29.
Simeon is to 1 King. 19.10.
be dismissed: they desire to be 2 Cor. 5.6.
eased of that burd^n, Romans 7.24.
released from that body of death, that they bear here about them; Vide
Methodii parabolam de caprifici radicibu^ and radicum fibris templi parietibus
inna^is, q^ nisi compag^ dissoluta eximi p^ni^us n^n possunt^ apud Epip^an. in
^a^e^. ^4.
which cannot be done but by death; they desire to Psalm. 120.5, 6.
leave this wicked and wretched world, and to 2 Cor. 5.8.
go to their own home, to their John 14.2.
Fathers house, 2 Cor 5.1.
to Heaven: they desire to depa^t hence, that they may Phil. 1.23. John 14.3.
be with the Lord Jesus, and 1 These. 4.17.
abide with him for ever.

3. It is for Gods glory that they dye; Reason 3.
and that they regard too as much as their own good. For Phil. 1.20.
Christ is magnified in them as well by their death, as by their life; as well
by their pious and patient end and conclusion, as by their godly course of life
and conversation. And a man may thereby as well glorify God, though he dye in
his bed, as if he dyed at a stake, or with John 21.19.
Saint Peter on the Cross.

4. They John 8.51. (...). Callimach. Epig. 14.
dye not, Reason 4.
though they dye: death is no death to them: as they Prove. 14.32.
hope even in death; so they John 11.26.
live even in death. (...). Ch^ys. in Philip. Hom. 3.
As others are Luke 9.60. 1 Timothy 5^6.
dead while they live; so they Luke ^0.38.
live when they dye. As to the wordly their Per vitam ad moriem transitu^ es^.
life is but a passage unto death; So to the godly their Per mortem ad vitam
reditus est. Am^r^ de bon. mort.
death is but an entrance into life: their Eccles. 7.1.
deaths-day is better to them then their birthday: it is the Apoc. 21.4.
birthday of their immortality, the AEternina^alu est. Senec. Epist. 102.
birthday of their eternity.

Use 1. for Admonition.
Now it is so, that even the faithful, though Chri^ts friends, yet are as well
as others subject to death; are no more privileged or exempt from it, then
others are? This may then first serve to admonish us that have such friends, to
make use of them while we have them, not to be like those fools, of which
Solomon; Prove. 17.16.
why is there a price in the ^ands of a fool to get wisdom with, when he has
no heart to make use of it? Nor like those, whom the Heathen man speaks of,
that Virtutem in co^lume^ odimus: subla^a^ ex oculis qaerimus invidi. Flac.
carm. l. 3. od. 24.
cannot brook or abide such while they live, and yet lament for t^em, and wish
them again alive when they are dead: but Hab^^mus tanqam amissuri, tanqam
recessuri, in o recedentibus uta^u^: tanqam exte^plo abituros possideamus,
Senec. ad Marc. c. 10.
to make the best use we can of them for our spiritual good while we have
them, not knowing how soon or suddenly they may be taken away from us.

Use 2. for Consol^t^on, and Encouragement.
Again, it may serve as to encourage us against the fear of death, so to
mitigate our grief for the decease of such our friends; since that nothing
therein shall betide us, or has befallen them, but Psalm. 49.^0. Esay^ 57.1.
what all Gods friends and Christ's favorites have undergone before us, and do
daily undergo. Nor would he suffer the same to befall those that are his
intimatest friends, his best beloved, his dearest darlings, his nearest
favorites, were there any Prove. 1.33. Nihil accidere bo^^ viro mali potest.
Son. de provid. c. 2.
evil in it, yea or were it not for their Romans 8.28. Etiam pro ipsis est.
Senec. ib. c. 3.
good.

Point. 4.
And so pass we to the next Point, to wit, that Sanctorum mors som^^^. Hieron.
in Matthew. 25.
Death, to such especially, is but as a sleep.

So here, Our friend Lazarus (...). C^llimach. Epig. 14.
sleeps, and Acts 7.60.
Steven, when he had so said, fell a sleep: and, Acts 13.36.
David, when he had served his time, fell asleep: and, 1 Cor. 11.30.
for this cause some among you are sick, and some sleep: and, 1 Cor. 15.6.
whereof some are asleep, and some yet survive.

And indeed in diverse respects is death to such as a sleep.

For 1. Reason 1.
sleep gives Somnu^ malorum domi^or, reqies animi: ^ars humanae melior vitae
Senec. Herc. fur. Vtmors, sic somnus miseros foelicibus aeqa^. (...), E^stath.
ad (...). Inde dictu^, (...). Aristot. Eth. l. 1. c. 13.
ease of pains and of troubles for the time: and so does death to the
faithful: for Apoc. 14.13.
they rest from their labors, their troubles, their travels. But sleep does
it only, as those Delinimenia, sive lenocinia morbi, non remedia. Sen. de beat.
c. 17. and Salvian. de provid. prafat.
palliating medicines that empiricks usually give, that abate the pains for
the present, but work no sound cure, so that the pain returns after again
as fresh and fierce as before: whereas death with the faithful works Job
3.13, 18. Mors simulut veni^, dolores, no^ a^^get, (non mitigat) sed aufert: ut
remedium esse videatur, non poena. Ambr. de Cain and Abel. l. 2. c. 10. Pro

a perfect cure of all evils either Esaias 57.1, 2.
corporal or Romans 6.7. Reason 2.
spiritual, so as they never feel them, or see them, or hear of them any
more.

2. Those that sleep are John 11.12.
not perished, are not dead; they are alive still: there is with them only a

all worldly employments. Verse. 12. (...). Solet enim esse somnus aegrotantium,
salutis i^dicium. August. in Joan. 49.
Lord, if he sleep, say they, he shall do well. In like manner, 1 Cor. 15.18.
Mors non est peremptoria, per qam non adimitur Vita. Ambr. de Cain and Abel. ^.
10.
those that sleep in Christ, are not perished; though to the outward eye, to
carnal sense they may so seem. ( ^sai. 57.1.
The righteous, says he, perishes, and no man considers it,) yet in truth
it is not so: all Eccles. 9.6. Job 14.21. Esaias 63.16.
worldly employments indeed are suspended and surceased with them, but they
Esaias 57.2.
rest in their beds, and they Luke 20.38.
live unto God.

Reason 3.
3. Sleep is but for a time; men are wont to Psalm. 3.5. (...). Arist. de Somn.
c. 1.
awake again after a while; and (...). Chrysostom. de stat. orat. 5. Stul^e qid est
somnu^, gelid^ nisi mortis imago? Lo^ga qi escendi tempora fata dabunt. Naso
Amor. 2.9.
death is but a sleep somewhat longer then ordinary. Job 14.12.
Man, says Job, if he dye, shall not be awakened again, until 2 Pet. 3.10.
the Heavens be no more. But then John 11.24. Vere dormit, qia de mor^e, velut
de somno erat surrecturus. August. de temp. 104.
he shall, at the worlds end, when he shall hear that voice of our Savior,
Esaias 26.19.
Awake ye that sleep in the dust of the earth, and John 5.^8.
all hearing it shall arise.

Reason 4.
4. Men usually rise from sleep, (...). Arist. de somn. c. 2. Hac reparat
vires, membraque fessa levat. Naso Ep. 4.
refreshed with it, in better plight then they were when they laid them down
to rest. So shall the 1 Cor. 15.42.44
faithful rise again from death, in far better plight then ever they were
while they lived here. Psalm. 17.15.
When I awake, says David, I shall behold thy face, and shall be satisfied
with thine image. For 1 John 3.2.
then shall we become perfectly like unto him, not 1 John 3.3.
in grace alone, but Colos. 3.4.
in glory, too, when we shall see him as he is.

Use 1. for Enco^ragement.
Now is death then but as a sleep to the faithful? then first (...). Chrysostom. de
stat. orat. 5. (...)^ Ibid.
why should any faithful, any friend of Christ fear death? It is a childish
thing for a man to be afraid to put off his clothes and go to bed; and what is
death more then a stripping of us, that we may lay our selves down to rest? It
is true indeed that in some diseases even sleep it self is so (...). Plut. de
sup. (...). Hom^r. Odys. (...).
restless and troublesome to the sick (it was Job 7.14.
Jobs case sometime) and they are so ill after it, that they are Qomodo
interest in ipsis, qi qotidie dor^iunt and exurgunt, qid qisque videat in
somnis: alii sentiunt laeta somnia, alii torqentia, ita ut evigilans dormire

afraid and loath to sleep: and so indeed Mors enim peccatori finis est
naturae, non p^^ae. Ambr. in Luc. l. 7. c. 1^.
it is, or may well be, in this case with the wicked. But it is not so with the
godly: they may well say with the Prophet, Ierem, 31.26.
I slept, and my sleep was sweet unto me. The sleep of death is no dreadful,
but (...). Iliad. (...) Ibid. (...) and (...) dulcis qies mortis. Ambr. de bon.
mort. c. 8.
a sweet sleep unto them.

Secondly, Use 2. for Comfort.
is death as a sleep, and such a sleep, to the faithful? (...). Chrysostom. de
^^at. orat. 5.
there is no cause then to mourn and take on for such deceased. We read of a
people that De morib. gent. Author. incertus. (...). Theod. de Chrysostom. ^ra^. 3.
used to houle and keep an hideous coile every day at the setting of the
Sun, as if they feared he would never rise again. Would we not condemn
such of extreme folly? or would we not deem him little better then a mad man,
that should stand weeping and wringing his hands over one that were fallen
asleep, as supposing he would never awake again? Yet the like do thou,
when thou do so over the dead: since that they are but in a deep sleep. 1
Cor 15 18.
They are fallen asleep in Christ. And, 1 These. 4.13. Contrist^mur in
nost^o^u^ m^r^ibus, de necessi^a^^ amittendi: s^d cons^lemur, de sper^cipiendi,
ideo enim d^rmire dicuntur, ^t cum dormientes audimus, evig^la^u^os ne
d^speremus. Aug. de Ve^b. Ap. 32.
I would not therefore, says the Apostle, that you should be grieved and
sorrow for those that be D^rmientes appellavit, qi^ resurrecturos

again. For 1 These 4.14. Manet ergo little vita, qos manet resurrectio. Ambr. de
obit. Valent.
those that be asleep in Christ, will God awake, and bring again together
with Christ.

Use 3. for Confirmation
Thirdly, this may help to strengthen Somnus mors dicitur, propter futuram
resurrectionem, velu^ evigil^tionem. August. Ep. 1 ^0. c. 32. Id^o mortu^s
consu^vit, Scriptura dicere do^mientes; qia ev^gilaturos, id est, resurrecturos

fidem initiaris, spem meditaris, discis mori and vivere. Tertullian. de anim.
cap. 25.
our faith in the assurance of the resurrection of the dead. Augustine speaking
of those words of our Savior, Mat^h. 9 24.
The Damsel is not dead, but sleeps: Dormiebat: sed illi, qi poterat
excitare^ Aug. de verb. Dom. 44.
she sleeps indeed, says he; but to him who is able to awake her. So,
Sor^ribus mortu^^ erat; Domino d^r^iebat, hominibus mortuus erat, qi eum
suscitare non poterant: nam Dominus tan^a eum facilitate excitabat de Sepul^ro,
qan^a tu non excitas dormientem d^lecto. A^gustin. in Io^n. 49.
Lazarus sleeps here, but to Christ, who John 11.43, 44.
was able to awake him, and M^rtuos tanqam e somno suscitavit. Martial. Epist.
2. Sect. 1.
to raise him up again with a word. He sleeps, says he here: but I go to
awake him. And indeed as easy a thing it is for Christ with a word to raise
out of this sleep, not Tardius qi^ de som^o susci^a^ur, qam Lazarus de m^^te.

by making a noise to awake any one that lies fast asleep.

Use 4. for Admon^^ion.
Lastly, is death as a sleep? We have that daily then before our eyes that may
mind us of death. Somnus mortis imago. Naso am^r. l. 3. cl. 9. Speculum mortis
s^mnus and exemplar. Tert^ l. de anim. c. 24. Prop^nitur tibi corpus amica vi

Our sleep is a lively emblem of it: Qoties dormis and vigilas, toties
moreris and resu^gis. Petr. Chrysolog. Ser. 59.
so often, says he, as thou layest thee down to sleep, and awakest again from
sleep: so often, in a similitude, as the Apostle Heb. 11.19.
of Isaac, thou dyest, and risest again from the dead. And well were it for
us, could we take occasion thereby daily so to Deuteronomy. 32.29.
mind our end, that we might live Job 14.14.
in a continual exp^ctation of it, and a continual Psalm. 90.12.
preparation for it.

The last point is, Point 5.
that

This friendship beweene Christ and the faithful never fails.

It surceaseth not in death, but surviveth their decease.

So here, Verse. 14.
Lazarus is dead, and yet, our friend still, says Christ, and of Abraham, God,
when he had been many hundreds of years deceased, Esaias 41.8.
Abraham my friend.

And no marvel. For,

1. Neither does Christ's love to them, nor theirs to him surcease, at their
decease. Reason 1.
He cease not then to love them still: for John 13.1.
whom he loves he loves for ever. Nor do they cease then to love him: nay they
love him more then, then ever before, better then, then ever they did, or could
do: they never did or could love him so well as then, when the grace of 1 John
4.17, 1^.
love, as 1 Cor. 13.10^
all other, comes to be perfected in them.

Reason 2.
2. So far is it from this, that death should breed any enmity, or infringe that
amity, that is between Christ and them, that it removes utterly all the
relics and remainders of that, Colos. 1.21.
that at first bred an enmity between God and them, and makes some Esaias 59.2.
and 57.17. and 54.7, 8.
breaches between them now and then, while they live here, to wit, Romans 7.24.
and 6.7.
sin and corruption; which sanctification indeed eats out here by degrees,
but death utterly destroys.

Reason. 3.
3. Christ and the faithful, they part not in death. Ruth 1.17.
The Lord do so to me and more too, says Ruth to Naomi, if ought but death do
part thee and me: and it is a solemn clause in our espousals, till death us So
should it be read, not, depart.
do part. But it is more then so between this loving couple; between the
faithful soul and Christ. As David says of Saul and Jonathan, 2 Samuel 1.23.
they are lovely and amiable either to other in their life, nor are they
divided and sundred in death. Mark 6.16, 27.
The sword and death may sever the Christian man's head from his body, and his
body from his soul: but neither Romans 8^35.
sword nor Romans 8.38, 39.
death can sever him either from his head Christ, or from the love of God in
Christ.

Reason 4.
4. Death brings Philip. 1.23.
Christ and the faithful nearer together 2 Cor. 5.6.
then ever: it brings them to a 2 Cor. 5.8. Apoc. 14.4. 1 These. 4.17.
more entire and immediate communion either with other, to 1 Cor. 15.28.
a fuller fruition either of other.

Use 1. for Exhortation.
First then would thou have a sure friend, a constant friend both to thee and
thine, one that may stand by thee and stick to thee, when all other may forsake
thee, yea of necessity must leave thee? Make Christ thy friend, and Genesis 28.15.
Josh. 1.5. Heb. 13.5.
he will never leave thee, though 2 Timothy 4.16, 17.
all others do, when all others shall. Ad limen carceris deduxerunt vo^.

Yea, have thou made Christ thy friend? Use 2. for Consolation.
He will continue so Genesis 17.7. Exodus 20.6. Psalm. 37.25, 26. and 115.13, 14.
not to thee only, but to thine also for thee. It troubles men many times (and
well may it, considering (...). Eurip. Stob. c. 127.
the untrustinesse and unfaithful dealing of many professed friends) upon
their sick, and as it may fall out, their deathbeds, to think whom they
should entrust with their charge, their children, if God shall call them away.
This may well ease in part the mind of the godly man in this case: Christ
Jesus thy friend he will undertake the charge of them, he will be a trusty
friend to thee as well when thou art gone, as while thou art here. 2 Samuel 9.1.
Who is there left, says David, of Ionathans issue, that I may show kindness
unto for Ionath^ns sake? Nor could David's love to his friend Jonathan surviving
his decease, prevail more with him, to move him to deal kindly with those
that he left behind him, then Christ's love will with him toward those that
have been, yea that are still, though deceased, his friends, to cause him to
deal friendly with those whom deceasing they leave here behind them, Use 3.
for Imitation.
or at their decease commit unto his charge. It is the Argument that God uses
to his people, to encourage them to depend upon him, not doubting of the
continuance of his kindness to them, Esaias 41.8.

Ou^ friend Lazarus sleeps. For he was indeed a Lazarus, though not in name,
yet in truth, one that made God his aid, his help, his strength, his stay.
Nor was he less a friend to Christ, and to all that were Christ's; to his
Ministers, to his members; yea to all for Christ, with this aim, either to
bring them on unto Christ, or to build them up in Christ.

religious, without superstition or ostentation; zealo^s in ^n high degree, but
with spiritual dis^retion; industrious in his Calling, (one that abhorred

attendance on better things; of a good understanding; a sound judgment; a
tender conscience; a circumspect carriage; a strict course of life, yet without
austerity or censoriousnesse: in a word, of a wise and prudent temper in all
things.

I remember a story in Plut. in Pr^c^pt. p^litic.
Plutarch of an Artist at Athens, who being called among others to the
undertaking of a piece of work for the public, when one of his fellow-workmen
had made a long speech, to show them in what manner he would do it, if they
would put it into his hands, he being a man of few words, but of good skill,
said no more but this, (...).
As this man has said it, so will I do it. To apply it to our purpose. We have
spoken much^ of the duties that are required of all those that pro^esse
friendship with Christ; their faithfulness to him, their ob^ervance of him;
their obedience to him; their loving what he loves, loving whom he loves; and
the like. Now of this our brother we may well and truly say, What we have said^
he did: he made good all we have said in a method, in a manner, in a measure
more than ordinary. And for the making good of what I say, that which I shall
deliver unto you, shall be the most of it, out of his own remembrances, (for he
kept journals as well of his spiritual ^stat^ and ^mployments, as of his
worldly reckonings and affairs) and the rest either from mine own knowledge,
or the credible relation of those that conversed versed most constantly and
inwardly with him.

When it pleased God to bring him first acquainted with Christ, His first
Conversion.
and to discover unto him the vanity of those courses that he had formerly
taken; albeit he had a great measure of inward remorse, and was much humbled
for the same, and he was now res^lved upon a new, and that a strict course of
life; yet it troubled him not a little, that he could not shed tears, as he
desired, for his sins, and his fore-passed excesses; that which made him
somewhat doubtful therefore of the sincerity of his then present repentance:
nor did he leave earnestly begging of this grace and favor at Gods hands,
until it pleased God to vouchsafe it in great abundance unto him. In which
te^res of his he professes that he found more sound comfort, (...). Eurip.
Helen. (...). Greg. Naz. pro pauper. (...)^ Chrysostom. in Phil. Hom. 15. (...).
Basil^ Caes. Hom. 4. (...). Basil. Caes. Hom. 19.
more hearty joy, more true contentment, then all his former mirth and jolity,
ever did, yea then all the mirth and merry company in the world (and he knew by
experience to his grief what such things meant) were able to afford unto any.

Being now thus grown into some intimacy with Christ; Observa^ce of Christ by
attendance on him in his Ordinances.
that no strangeness by neglect might accrue between him and Christ, he was
careful to maintain it by a frequent and constant attendance upon him in his
ordinances, both in private and in public. For his ordinary addresses unto God
in private: Ordinary. Private.
he used prayer constantly, as Psalm. 55.17.
David, and Dan. 6.10.
Dani^l, thrice a day; morning and evening with his fa^ily; and some other time
of the day a part, either with his religious consort, if she were in the way,
or in her absence, alone by himself. On the Lord's Day his common course was,
not as the manner of many. Yea the most, to lie longer in bed, and take their
ease more on that day, then on others; but to get up early, that he might be an
hour at least, if not more, sometime two, in private with God: after which he
used to spend some time in prayer with his family: yet so, let me tell you,
that the public might not be drowned and swallowed up in the private; Public.
(for it was ever his saying, that the private must yield and give way to the
public) but that both he and his might be present in the congregation, as well
at the public prayers and service of the Church as at the preaching of the
Word: after which public performances also, his constant course was at his
return home to repeat with his family, and press upon them, (which well he
could do) those things that had in public been delivered unto them. And for
the Week-dayes, once or twice at least, ordinarily he frequented the ministry
of some of those of the best note about the City. And thus much of it I had
from himself (the rest from those that conversed familiarly with him) when
some half a year or thereabout before his decease, advising with me
concerning some thoughts that he then had, of either abandoning, or abatement
of his worldly employments, for the freer pursuit of spiritual things, which
he most eagerly thirsted after, he related to me in particular what liberty he
had, notwithstanding his then present engagements by his trade and traffic,
for the prosecution of the better part.

This then was his ordinary course of addresses unto God, and attendances upon
Christ. But besides these he had solemn days of humiliation upon special
occasions: Extraordinary^ Days of Humiliation.
and no business of more then ordinary weight did he lightly undertake without
some such employment. It is said of Cornelius, Acts 10.4.

these two constantly concurred, as with Acts 10.2.

and no small sums in it, to distribute, where he supposed most need was, or
deemed most good might be done: for neither did he (...). Isid. l. 1. Ep. 44.

Now as he had such times of solemn seeking to God; Gratulation.
so he kept a due account of the success of his suits, and the return of his
addresses: and he had then accordingly, solemn days of gratulation and
thanksgiving; on which the bag likewise with the greater sums walked, out of
that stock and store, of which anon, that he had set a part for such purposes:
that so the poor servants of God partaking with him in that wherewith God had
blessed him, might bless God for him, and together with him.

Obedience.
Thus much then for his due and diligent observance of Christ and attendance
upon him. Now for matter of obedience; ( Prove. 15.8. and 21.17. Esaias 1.11.14.
and 66.3. Ier. 17.2^.23. Ezekiel. 20 39.
without which all such observances are but loathsome, nor acceptable, but
abominable in Gods eye) he was one that Colos. 1.10.
in all things endeavored to approve himself unto God, desirous, as the
Apostle speaks, H^b. 13.18.
to keep a good conscience in all things. And indeed he was a man of a very
tender, yea of a scrupulous conscience, out of a fear to do ought, though
unwittingly, that might be offensive unto God. To which purpose I can truly
testify of him that he made many a journey over of purpose unto me (that which
also first occasioned mine acquaintance with him) to request resolution in such
cases as seemed any whit ambiguous, Iuxt^ illud R. Gamalielis in Dictis P^t^um,
c. 1. Sect. 16. (...) Ab^^ineas ^e a re dubia. Illudque c^utissimi cu^usque

not daring to undertake them, till he knew what warrant there were for them,
nor desiring to deal in them, unless he might see some good ground for what
he did. In which kind I know that he forbore diverse things, because they
seemed doubtful, which might in likelihood have proved very advantageous unto
him, and that few would have stuck at.

in many things he may fail, either in doing that he should not do, or not
doing that he should, or not doing it as he should; that he might not therefore
run far behind hand with God, he had his nightly exercise, as he terms it,
both in his remembrances, and (where he seriously commends it also to his) in
his Will: Iuxta illud Pythagorae monitum. (...). La^rt. in Pythag. Plut. d^

wherein having withdrawn himself a part, he used to take a strict surveigh
and account of his employments the day past: to the end that if he found ought
therein amiss, he might humble himself for it, and by renewed repentance make
up the breach; if he found nothing, he might yet, with Psalm. 19.12.
David, crave pardon for his hidden transgressions, and bless God for his
direction and 1 Samuel 25.32, 33.
preservation so far forth. And yet beside this, he had his weekly, monthly,
and yearly times of account, not for his worldly, but for his spiritual
estate and condition, to Psalm. 119.59^
examine how therein it fared with him, and how he either thrived or paired in
it.

And thus much, as for his observance of Christ, so for his obedience unto
Christ; his desire and endeavor not to fail in any office required of him,
and his care to find out wherein he might fail, and to amend what he ^ound
amiss.

But may some say, you told us ere while among other things, that those that
are Christ's friends must show their love to Christ, in loving those that he
loves, in being friendly, and doing good, unto those that are his.

Beneficence.
Why? this was one of the principal flowers, in that Garland of graces,
wherewith it pleased God to crown and adorn this our Brother. In other things
he excelled others, (...). Eurip. apud Plut. in G^rg. and Alcib. 2. and Plut.
Sympos. l. 1. c. 4. and l. 2. c. 1.
in this even himself. What faithful minister of Christ did he not entirely 1
These. 5, 12, 13.
love, and affect? What faithful member of Christ, though never so mean, did
he not Psalm. 15.4. 1 Pet. 2.17.
honor and respect? Neither was this his love and respect, 1 John 3.18.
verbal, or James 2.15, 16.
complementall, but active and real, ready largely and liberally to manifest
it self at all occasions, upon the least intimation and signification made to
him, as my self at diverse times have had experience, and that even there Qod
de Atheni^us. Aristides. (...).
where no motion at all has been made to him for them, but he had come
occa^ionally to understand of their wants and necessities.

At his first effectual call, among other things he then resolved upon, this
was one, to set apart every year a tenth of his gain for the relief of the
poor (and that besides his tithe to God. Tenth of yearly gain for the Poor.
) And will you know the reasons that induced him thereunto? you shall have them
out of his own memorials, and most in his own words.

Reason. 1.
First, to show his love and his thankfulness unto God; as Genesis 32.10.
for raising him from a mean condition, having less then fifty pounds to
begin withal at first, to that wealth that then he had; so more especially for
Eph^s. 1.3, 4.
his spiritual goodness to him, in electing him, redeeming him, reclaiming
him, Psalm. 103.1, 4.
remitting his sins, and receiving him to grace and favor in Christ.

Secondly, Reason 2.
because he conceived, that this distribution of alms would be an excellent
means of keeping him from being proud and high-minded, 1 Timothy 6.17. (...).
Isidor. l. 3. ^. 322. Ante omnia nihil est qod s^c generant divit^a, q^mode
superbiam: omne pom^m, granum, ^ructus, lignum ^abet vermem suum: liu^ est
vermis mali, ali^^ py^i, alius fa^^, aliu^ tri^ici: vermis divitiarum superbia.
Aug. de verb. Dom. 5. and homil. 15. Primus vermis divitiarum superbia. Idem de
temp. 205.
a vice that usually follows wealth; for when in the exercise of this gift he
should behold so many lamentable creatures, some blind, some lame, some sore,
some diseased, some hunger-starved, having death in their faces either through
famine or other ways, it would minister him occasion of these and the like
thoughts. Sicut rusticus qidam ab aut^re Anonymo buf^ne conspecto lachrymas
^bertim fudisse refertur, h^c consideratione motus, potuisse eundem, qi hominem
f^ceratipsum, ^usonem ejusmodi fecisse. Greg. Naz. pro pauper. (...).
Why am not I as this lamentable creature? Or why is not this lamentable
creature as I am? 1 Cor. 4.7.
What makes the difference between me and him, but the mercy of God only more
in this kind to me then to him?

Thirdly, Reason 3.
it would 2 Cor. 9.12, 13.
occasion many to bless God, and to pierce the Heavens with their prayers, and
indeed in giving to any his word was usually, Ha^ est (...). ut Marc. Imp. l.
6.. 7
Praise God: or when he sent to others, as to my self sometime, any sum to
be distributed among poor people, his manner was to add in his lines
accompanying it, will them to praise God for it.

Reason 4.
Fourthly, he conceived he should be no small gainer by such gift. And shall I
tell you from himself, what the gain he meant, was? He considered, he says,
what Philem. 7.
comfort would accrue to such poor ones by his gift: and what a joy must it
needs then be unto him, (yea and no small (...). Gr^g. Naz. pro paup. (...).

comfort to any member of Christ? I might well add, and to Matthew. 25.40. (...).

Idem hom. 47. Q^d in terra jacentibus porrigi^is, in coelo sedenti datis. Greg^
in Evang. 40.
Christ in them. This therefore 1 Cor. 16.2.
he constantly set apart: and out of this treasury it was, that upon the
forenamed occasions he so liberally dispensed. That which being cast up,
amounts to many hundreds, a greater sum then for some considerations I
think meet to express: and yet what beside he freely bestowed upon his kindred
and allies, is deemed to amount to as great, yea a greater sum then it. Nor
do I reckon what over and above all this also went out of his poores purse,
which he never carried out empty; that he might Gal. 6.9. (...) ^lut. de S^^.
^^lit and contr. C^lo^. Hoc est qod Marc. l. 12. Sect 29. (...)^

delighted in, blessing and praising God, in his remembrances, that had (...).
M^^c. l. 1. Sect. 17.
given him ability and opportunity so to do: it being one branch also of his
daily prayer, that as God increased him in wealth, so he would be pleased
withal to increase in him, wisdom, humility, and thankfulness, together
with a constant and comfortable perseverance in that lovely grace of charity.

Yea but, what got he, or gained he, may some of you say, by this his
beneficence? or what was the fruit and effect of it?

I answer. He esteemed it (...). Ph^laris Ep. 17. and Ep. 119. (...).
B^neficium dand^ accepit, qi digno dedit. P. Syrus. Marc. l. 11. Sect. 4.
(...). Idem lib. 9. Sect. 42. (...); Plut. de ^ffect. e^g. ^r. 4. (...).

liberalis, cupiens dare, etiam cum dederit, and augere novis ac recentibus
vetera. Seneca de benef. lib. 4. cap. 14.
gain enough to do any good: and Hebr. 13.16.
Gods acceptance of this his service to be recompense sufficient. But yet it
pleased God abundantly to recompense this his beneficence unto him, both with
outward and inward blessings.

True it is indeed, Gods trial of him.
that for some space of time, some three or four years after that his
resolution of setting a tenth apart for such purposes, he thrived not, he found
no increase, nor came forward in the world, as formerly he had done. Yet was he
not thereby discouraged, nor did he forbear to be bountiful as opportunity
was offered, and the necessity of poor people required it; but he gave still
with cheerfulness and comfort out of love unto God, (I give you his own
words) freely leaving prosperity in temporal things to God his fathers good
pleasure; and conceiving (so he says) that God in wisdom and goodness
prospered him not, thereby to try his sincerity to him, and his charity to
others^ yea and that ^^n. 2^.^2. (...), id est, (...) ^e f^^i: ign^tus enim
^ibi qisque est a^te interrogatione^ tentationis: latentque homi^em dilectionis
and ^idei sua vires, nisi exp^rimento divino eidem inno^escant. Aug. in Gen
qaest. 57. and in Deuteronomy. 13.3. q. 19. and in Psalm. 58. and de Trinit. l. 1. c.
12. and l. 3. c. 11.
he himself might thereby have experience of his love unto God, his faith,
patience, and constancy; nor would he forgo those evidences hereof, that
thereby he gained, for ten thousand times ten thousand times more then they
cost him. So that albeit he prospered not in his wordly estate, yet even then
also he thrived much in his spiritual estate, and in the fruits and comforts
of it.

Blessing of him in his estate temporal.
But from that time forward God abundantly advanced his estate. (You hear him
again speaking to you in his own language) so that he found experimentally
those gracious promises of God true, Psalm. 112.9.
Prove. 19.17.
(and he cites the places) of his blessing of him that disperseth and
dispenses to the poor; of the repayment of that with interest, Eccles. 11.1.
that is so lent to the Lord; of the finding again after many days with
increase the bread, or (...) panem, id est, semen: ut Psalm. 104.15. Iun.
bread-corne, that is cast upon the face of the waters, or Secundum aqas in
l^^is irriguis, ac proinde feracibus. Esaias 32.20. Iun.
on the land near thereunto, though it seem cast away for the present.

But that, which is above all, and beyond all, it pleased God withal to afford
him such evidences and assurances of his favor and love toward him,
Spiritual.
as who^oever would buy from him by offer of the whole world and all the
sovereignty thereof, he professes he would refuse a thousand such worlds in
exchange for them. By means whereof, as he led (...). Phil. 3.20. Qod Cypr l.

joys and comforts (...). Greg. Naz apolog. (...). Chrysostom. de stat^is. 2.
he had an heaven here out of heaven. And this cheerful and comfortable
estate and condition continued with him to the end.

The nearenesse whereof as presaging before his departure into foreign parts,
whither his affairs drew him, he took a great deal of pains according to Esaias
38.2.
Esaies advice to Ezechiah, in the se^ling of his estate, and in composing of
his Will^ Pliny the younger says, it was a received opinion and common conceit
in his times, Preparation for his End.
that Testamenta ^ominum, specula morum. Plin. l. 8, ^p. 18.
men's last Wills and Testaments, were as looking-glasses, in which a man might
as clearly descry and discern the inward disposition of their mind, as he
may see their bodily face in a glass. And such indeed was the Will of this our
deceased brother, His Will^
all savouring of piety, all of charity, very lively resembling and
representing his inward disposition. Few Wills, I suppose, so composed, come
into the Office: full of spiritual, religious, holy, heavenly expressions;
full of blessings of Gods name, and acknowledgements of his goodness, with
incitement of others thereunto; full of works of mercy, bounty, and charity, In
it, His charity.
as if he were but then beginning that work, which the most put off till then.
Besides large Legacies to not a few of his near kindred and acquaintance,
which I cast out of this account. To the poor Palatine exiles, fifty pounds:
to the Town of Leicester for the use of the poor Weavers and Knitters there,
fifty pounds: for the relief of poor prisoners, one hundred pounds: for the
taking up in the streets a certain number of poor children, Boys, and
Girls, to be fitted for, sent out to, and placed in the foreign Plantations,
three hundred pounds: among his poor servants, seventy pounds: among other
poor, left to the discretion of his Executors, fifty pounds: to this poor
man, and that poor Minister, as they came then in his mind, to the sum of
forty and seven pounds; which in all amounts to six hundred sixty and seven
pounds.

This for his charity, Apoc. 2.19.
as fresh at last as at first, notwithstanding his charge, that is wont to
cool charity with many, but did not so with him.

His Piety.
Now for his piety, and his care of the continuance of it with those whom God
had blessed him with or committed to his charge. It is report^d of Plato, that
when he had occasion to go abroad, he used to give in charge to those young men
that lived with him, (...). Plut. de Sanit. conserv.
to spend their time during his absence, in some useful employments: and
blessed Peter the Apostle was careful to take such a course, that 2 Pet. ^.13.
his Disciples might after his departure remember and bear in mind those
things, that he had delivered to them while he lived. In like manner was it
with this our brother. As he was always careful, (therein a true child of
Genesis 18.19.
Abraham) to commend piety to his people, and to inform those of his family,
as well servants as children, how to fear and serve God: so in special
manner, at his departure beyond the seas, he assigned each of them, as their
abilities and capacities were, what they should learn of the grounds of
religion, and proofs thereof out of Scripture, against his return. And yet
more specially for the better continuance of piety and godliness in those his
child^en whom God had blessed him withal, and the i^citing of them by his
example and the fruit he had found in it, to a more constant and cheerful
practice thereof, he gave order in his will, to have all his spiritual
journals, his meditations and remembrances, gathered together, digested and
reduced into a method, by some two godly Divines, unto whom also he has
assigned a very liberal consideration for their pains therein taken: and
several Copies thereof to be transcribed and made up for the use of each of
his Children: that therein they might see him when he was gone, and Qomodo de
Pt^l^m^^. Th^^^r. idyl. 17.

-- (...). Eurip. Helen.


treading in those steps that he had walked in before them, they might at
length Heb. 13.7.
arrive at that end, that he has now attained to: which Qod Commod^ Marci
fili^ Aristides; (...).
the Lord in mercy grant they may. Thus both living and dying, yea as well dead
as ^live (though not dead indeed, but alive still, alive to God, yea alive to
his too) he desired every way to do good.

What shall I need to add ought concerning his end? His End.
It is seldom seen, and Vix fi^ri p^test, ut been moriatur, qi male vixe^it.
hardly, says one, can it be, that one that has lived ill, should make a good
end. But Fieri non potest, ut male moriatur, qi been vixerit. A^g. ^om. de ver.
and f^ls^p^nit.
it cannot be, that one that has lived so well should make any other then a
good end. Sure it was so with this our brother, by report of those that were
eyewitnesses of it: full of pious expressions and sweet comforts to the last;
and that, even after that speech failed him, but memory and understanding
continued with him, by sign^s outwardly expressed, upon such passages recited,
as he had before given order to them about him to be read by him. Insomuch that
we may well with good probability suppose, that God in his holy wisdom had so
disposed it, that he should go ov^r hence to make his end in that place, amids
the enemies of Gods truth and grace, that those that are seduced by them, might
see^ pregnant proof of ^^e power of piety, in the religious and comfortable
end of one deceasing in that faith and profession, in which those seducers of
them bear them in hand, that there is no safety or comfort to be had, either
in life or in death.

In a word to conclude all with the words of my Text; Our friend, and your
friend; Christ's friend, and the friend of all Christ his, sleeps; his soul
being entered into his Masters joy, his body to be laid up in its Chamber of
rest; until Christ come to awake him, and us altogether with him, to the
et^^nall bliss of both. Conclusion of all.
Let us all make that use of wh^^ has ^^en delivered, that we be thereby
encited to i^itate him in those good things that we have, either seen in him,
or heard of him, that so through Gods goodness and his gracious ac^eptance of
our godly endeavors, we may both attain and retain those spiritual joys
and inward comforts that he found and felt, both in life and in death.
