The Tragical and lamentable History of Ceyx and Alcione.
WHen frowning Fortune began assault
her Foes: whose death she does desire
She will revenge, though for no fault,
When Envy has her set on fire:
She seeks to bring men to decaie
whom erst alofte:
She had set up at pleasant stay,
though reeling often.
And then at last they tumbling down
from highest stay, to lowest step:
To lamentacion from Renown,
with tumbling cast they downwarde lep,
Among all other, one I find
unfortunate:
For at his state, Fortune repinde
with cruel hate.
He was sometime of Thracine King,
And CEYX I read he had to name:
Dame Fortune his mischaunce seeking
she told him straight by flickering Fame
How Peleus his brother was
by ruinous chance,
With Death distroyed, as came to pass,
by Fortunes Lance.
Whereat he musing stood dismayde,
and vexed sore then in his thought:
How easily might the signs he said,
the which before his death were wrought
Of all men well perceived be,
as came to pass,
Betokening this his destiny,
which fearful was.
When CEYX the matter did perceive,
misdoubting what was best to do:
He did devise where he might have,
a remedy to slake his woo:
For counsel he to seek with speed
at Sacred SPELLS,
Deuiseth thus, as I do read,
where this God dwells.
The God of CLAROS I do mean,
where as an Oracle would tell,
Each thing to fill fond fancies stream,
but no good counsel their did dwell:
King CEYX disposed thus to go,
to this fond God:
Dame Fortune has provided lo,
this scorging Rod.
He had a wife who had to name,
ALCIONE then Thrachine Queen:
She was a wife of passing fame,
few such at this time can be seen:
To whom he minded to disclose,
all his intent,
Unto his loving Mate he goes,
untimely sent.
He then began with faultring voice,
to show the matter to his wife,
At whose presence she did rejoice,
for sure she loved him as her life,
But when she heard he would depart,
with fear there struck:
A chilnes straighte unto her heart
that tears out brake.
Three times she then about to speak,
three times she washed her face with tears
Three times she of from tears did break,
and thus complained in his ears,
What fault of mine (O Husband dear)
does thee compel?
That thou will dwell no longer here,
but go to SPELL.
Do Iorneies long delight thee now?
or does mine absence better please
Then my presence? then I vow
to NEPTVNE, Guider of the Seas
Whose Storms uncertain thou must bide
in woeful plight:
To offer Gifts if he will guide
thy Ship aright.
Until thou comst at wisshed Port:
For sure my care is great for thee,
Thou art my Joy and sure comfort,
my faithful Spouse give ear to me:
Shall I have cause only to mourn?
And shall my care
Of thy uncertain home return
be void of fear?
The Sea does make me sore afraid
to think on it, my Corpse does quake,
My mind with musing is dismaide,
for very woe my Ioinctes do shake:
For broken late upon the shore
the Ribs of Ships
I saw, whose Masters long before
the waves in whips.
But yet my Spouse, if that thy will
I can by no entreatance move:
But that thou will persevere still,
Consider then my tender love,
And me dear Husband) with thee take
that I may be
Partaker of thy grief, and make
some mirth for thee.
O loving Wife ALCIONE,
my Love, my dear and only joy
(Quoth he) and wept full tenderlye:
Let not mine absence thee annoye:
Content thy self full quietly,
And will no more
On houering waves to go with me
from Thrachine shore.
For my Return shall be again
if that the Gods permit me life,
Within two Months I tell thee plain,
as thou art my espoused wife;
With that she began for joy to weep,
that CEYX had,
Appointed days and sighed deep,
and wexed glad.
She there does bring him to the Shoore,
Where he his last farewell did take,
ALCIONES, heart misgaue before,
she did with trembling joints often quake,
And straining CEYX in her arms,
with pittious look,
Her last farewell mistrusting harms,
she sadly took.
And when she saw the watermen,
the Ship begin to drive from shore,
And that she must her spouse leave then,
she much more heavy then before,
My only joy is gone she said,
why do I live?
Let death of thine, with mine be paid,
I would it give.
And casting up her waterie eyes,
she did behold her husband stand,
On Hatches gone now far on Seas,
she saw him becking with his hand:
And she like wise her hands did shake,
as love did move,
Where as she did her last sight take,
of her dear love.
And when the Ship was out of sight,
she straight unto her Chamber went,
She screeked out with maine and might,
and pitiously she did lament,
She cast her body on her bed,
with sorry heart,
With dumped sprites as heavy as Led,
renewes her smart.
And whilst she lies musing here,
a pleasant gale of wind does blow,
The wether waxes very clear,
these shipmen now in Seas do row,
And CEYX does make his men up hale,
the highest mast,
And set them up with the top sail,
that no wind wast.
At last they all arrived are,
when night was com and day was spent,
Where each of them must end their care:
and eke must there, their lives relent,
For BOREAS with his bitter blasts
does fierslie blow:
And waves do rise up all in haste
to overthrow
Their ship and they with fearful speed
do cut down Sails, and Clothes down rend
Each man is busy now at need,
Yet all in vain they do contend:
For now the Tempest has by force
the upper hand:
King CEYX does oftimes wish his Corse
to be on land.
With his dear Love ALCIONE
who now he says, did warning give
Of foming Tempests of the Sea,
yet he as then would not believe:
But willingly would forward go
to seek Counsel,
To pass the Sea would forward row
to go to SPELL.
King CEYX did of his Love still speak,
he always cried (ALCIONE,)
Nothing would make his tongue of break
but wicked waves of watrie Sea
When thus with Death he conquered was
and diynge in Sea:
He seemde to speak half dead (alas)
ALCIONE.
Whilste CEYX does lie thus in the Sea:
quite drownde with over gulfing waves
On rufull Bed ALCIONE
with weeping eyes, she restles craves
For safe and speedy coming home
of CEYX her Mate:
Who lies tossed on salt Sea foam,
unfortunate.
Now dead and drowned in the Sea,
yet she the days does count and tell,
She thinks poor wretch ALCIONE,
her husbands home return from SPELL
To be but slow: and she does think,
each hour a day,
No joys into her heart can sink,
for his delay.
She hops yet to see him again
alive at his appointed hour:
Her expectacion was in vain,
for Fortune was disposed to lower,
On him poor wretch as late befell,
yet she does make,
Acompt of his return from SPELL
her loving make.
The Lady being thus mindful still,
of her own spouse and husband dear
The day is past the night does fill,
each thing with darkness bright and clear,
And she to restles Bed is gone,
to take her sleep
And straight a slumber stealing on,
her eyes yet weep:
This woeful wight ALCIONE,
does dream she sees stand by her Bed,
Her only joy late drowned in Sea,
pale, wan, stark nakt, and cold as lead,
She thought he leaned on her breast,
and to her said,
My loving wife me thou know,
be not dismayed.
Thy CEYX is dead, therefore in vain
of my return no reckening make,
The boisterous winds with might and main
our ship on Seas did toss and shake,
Until it was turned vpsidowne,
and drowned in Sea,
O worthy wight of high renown,
ALCIONE,
Thou hear not by false report,
but I my self my shipwreke show,
Arise therefore come and comfort
thy husband, and some tears bestow
Upon thy spouse, and deck the now
with moorning weed,
For I can mirth no more allow,
now I am dead.
With that she stretched forth her hands,
her husbands Ghost for to embrace,
He steps a side and backward stands,
with that the tears ran down her face
she screeketh out, why do thou fly?
and leave me alone,
Then take me with thee, for I must die,
if thou art gone.
All this she did yet being a sleep,
and by and by she did awake,
And rewfully began to weep,
and heauely the matter take:
She rent her Clothes, and fare her here,
with extreme woe:
Her Nurce then rose with rewfull fear
and ran her to.
She did demand what was the cause
of her great grief and piteous moan
Whereat this Lady yet did pause
at last she said, I am undone,
ALCIONE is cast away
with CEYX his death:
For he has yielded up I say
his vital breath.
This, this, it is that I did fear
before thy Journey in my mind:
I warned thee, thou did not care,
That thou should not trust to the wind
And whilst she talked, the night was gone,
and Day was bright:
Unto the shore with speed she run
and footesteppes light.
She standing mourning on the shore,
and casting up her weeping eyes
And listening how the Sea did roar
a great way of, on Sea she spies
A thing come tumbling on the Sea
much like a Corce,
She meruailed what it should be
that waters force
Brought houering so toward the shore,
at last she saw, it was a man:
She knew not who it was therefore,
To speak she then with woe began,
Alas poor wretch (she said) thy wife
if any there be,
May wish her self deuoyde of life
for Death of thee.
And as the Wind, the waves did toss,
the Body floated nearer land
Yet she not ware of her great loss
Until it came unto her hand,
Anon it did arryue on shore:
ALCIONE
Saw CEYX who grieved her full sore
late drownde in Sea.
And therwithall she scratched her face,
her Here and Garments she did tear
She reached out in woeful case
to CEYX her tremblyng hands with fear
She said now comst thou home my love,
in such a case:
He being dead, she did remove
to touch his face.
And also yet not being content,
this wretched wight ALCIONE,
She ^ieth D' ^tropos consent,
and cast her self into the Sea*
And on her husbands corce does (...),
as Poets feign:
And both were turned to (...)
and still remain.
Their love right well we may (...)
for few such Mates are at this day:
Who love so steadfast to the end,
Therefore e^^^^le take we may,
By CEYX and ALCIONE.
which both live still,
As I do read and haunt the Sea,
as Poets will,
Faelix quem fa^ (...) Cantum. FINIS
