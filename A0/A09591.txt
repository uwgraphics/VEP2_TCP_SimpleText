A FRIENDLY Larum, or faithful warning to the true hearted Subjects of
England. Discoueryng the Acts, and malicious minds of those obstinate and
rebellious Papists that hope (as they term it) to have their Golden day.

By I. Phil.

Imprinted at London in Fleetstreete, by William How: for Richard Iohnes.

To the most virtuous and gracious Lady Katherin Duches of Suffolk, John
Phillip wishes continual health of body and mind, from God the father of our
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
NOt utterly ignorant, (most gracious Lady) of your many and sundry virtues,
which sufficientlye are made open and manifest to the lovers of Gods sincere
and Catholic Gospel, as otherwise ardent and zealous desire, that your noble
heart does possess: in wishyng the conversion of those that are enemies not
only to Gods verity, but also to the favorers of the same, which who so ever
he ^e that shall enter (in these points) into deep and earnest consyderation
of mind with him self, shall not only be moved to be thankful therefore to
God the giver of al good things, but also be provoked and stirred day by day
to pray, that God, as he by his unspeakable providence, has framed so good a
gift in your (most gracious breast) and to illumine your eyes with his divine
knowledge, whereby your person is, and can be able thereby to discern falsehood
from truth, light from darkensse, pure religion from unwritten verities, and
Gods Euangely from men's tradicions: so he may increase and multiply the same
in so noble a heart, that you may persevere and go forward therein to ye glory of
God, the advancement of his word, and the comfort and consolation both of
your gracious body and mind: that when Christ shall come to judge, you may
participate as fellow Heir with him, that eternal and Heavenly kyngedome,
purchased with his dear heart blood: where he has laid up in store, for all
that faithfully, and earnestly believe on his most holy name, immortal and
i^corruptible Crowns of everlasting life, the which are allotted to his
beloved and adopted sons, in his blood. Knowing therefore (O virtuous Lady)
your Estate, to be such, as scarsly I might for want of knowledge, once be
worthy to name, so great is the weakness and imbicillitie of my wit:
much less then, to wright unto so noble a Lady as your grace is. Yet
incoraged by hope, I am imboldened to pitche mine Anchor, amidst the Floods of
your virtues, and to build my travel on ye foundation of your knowledge,
being persuaded, that having so worthy a Matrone as you are, to be a sheilde
to this my weak and unskillful labor: it shall not only be a shield
sufficient thereto, but cause it also to be the better regarded and esteemed. In
consyderation whereof, I most humbly beseech your Grace to accept and take the
same in good part, and hereafter as God shall increase in me greater knowledge,
I shall with matters of greater weight and importance, trouble your most
gracious person, as knows God, who grant you long life, prosperity and
peace, with the comfort and great joy of your worthy children, to his good
pleasure now and ever.

Your humble and obedient orator Son of your poor servant (of long time,)
John Phillip.

To the Reader I. Phillip wishes health in Christ the giver thereof, etc.
CALLING TO MIND (Good Reader) the estate of this our miserable time,
knowing that CHRIST in his Gospel has given us knowledge thereof, forewarnyng
us therefore to the intent that our minds should not be troubled or carried
about, as the weather Cock is commonly with every puff and small blast of
Wind. Let this therefore advertise thee, that thou look not back from that
Canonical and heavenly doctrine, Which our master Christ has taught, and
confirmed as his blessed will and Testament, with the price of his precious
death and bloudshedding on the Cross: with which he has sealed the same, and
left it unto us and our posterities, that we and they which shall come after us
might teach it unto our Children, as a law given by him to be observed for
ever: Then since he has so mercyfully and lovingly dealt with us, shall we
reward his good will, with ingratitude? or shall we in recompense of so great
benefits yield or quit him with disdain? No, rather like obedient and loving
children, let us indeuer to obey his commandments, and to show our selves
follows of his word, not only in talk but in deed: for deeds to confirm
our profession are required, not that by them we may merit ought at all: for
faith and not works are our iustificacion, yet I condemn not works, for they
are the fruits of faith and testefie the same: sundry causes have moved me,
though unworthy to take this labor in hand: the one, the mutteringe of
Papists, which mutter there and here, as opportunity seruith their turns,
strange lies and news far distant from truth. Another cause is, that the
minds of many men are disquieted and brought out of frame by the ungodly
means of such* as not only rebel against God and his word, but also against
the estate of this Realm, our Queen and dignity of her Crown: and so
through the means and actions of a few unnatural branches, stand half in
doubt whether they may turn to the right hand or the left: this therefore may
be to comfort the one, to discourage and utterly deface the other: Which not
only purpose the ruin and spoil of their natural Nourse and country, but
also as their unjust dealings, their crafty attempts, and subtle pretenses
plainly show and demonstrate the damage and decay of our most gracious and
excellent Princess, whose high renown of majesty every true and faithful
subject as far as life and goods will stretch* ought to defend, support and
maintain, as her Majesty's person is the lawful heir of the famous Prince
King Henry the eight (who was) a suppresser and ouerthrower of all
superstition and Idolatry, so our Delbora does not only study to vanquish and
confound the same: but follows the trace of her most excellent Father, a
wise and prudent Solomon, as did that young and godly Ezechias the sixth
EDWARD her majesty's valiant brother, who* as she planted the Lords
Vineyarde, and repaired the walls of Sion again, Till such time as our God
seeing our ingratefulnesse delivered us into the hands of the Bulls of Basan,
who no only defaced the buildinge substancially framed and begone: but more then
this, gave the greedy Boar of Rome free liberty to enter thereunto: whose
spoiling Tuskes did spoil and root up such good and godly Branches, as
therein did beautify and cause the same increase: and after in their steads
planted Dernell weeds and stinking Brambles, which fruict was unsavory and
unpleasant before GOD, who for the grievous groans, the Tears, and plaintes,
most bitterly thrown forth of his little flock and Church, restored us again
from the yoke of Cruel and bloody Pharo, and in place of CYSERA or DIOCLESIAN,
who always were bente, to work the destruction of his people and Church*
shortened their rage, abated their pride, and gave us a wise and witty HESTER,
a godly IVDITH, a valiant DEBORA, or rather a chaste SUSANNA, to rule, to
govern, and raygne over us, whose clemency we can witness, whose love, we
could never want, but ever has abounded toward her subjects: and as for the
love she has to GOD we are able sufficiently to witness: her mercy, the
very obstinate and blind bluddringe BALAMITS can sufficiently record; Why
then do we so disdainefully recompense her, whom we are bound by GOD and
nature to love and obey? as it becomes good and godly subjects to do.
Therefore to put those in mind that be negligent, of their duties, which
though they know, yet they neglect to execute, and to confirm those that are
waueryng: as to condemn the whisperinges of Papists and other, as a man may
say, Iackes of both sides, I have framed this work, called A freindly Larum,
or faithful warning to the true hearted Subjects of England: Wherein is
discovered and plainly set forth unto all faithful people, as well the
obstinate and malicious minds of the Papist and Rebels here in England: as
also the cruel murders and shameless persecution lately done in other places
by the consent of their patron the monstrous Pope, the only cause of this
whurly burly, and disquietnesse of all Christendom: the very Antechrist or
Babilonicall strompet* that S. John speaks of in his Revelation, whose
Sorcerie and crafty iuglinges have bewitched and disceaued the Princes of the
World, and blinded their external eyes from beholdinge the light of Gods
profounde and endelesse wisdom: Which when thou have Read, then I pray thee
judge according to my plain and simple meaning* and not unto knowledge: for if
thou look for any Eloquence or fine Phrases of Rethorike, thou art deceived:
and thus loathe to trouble or molest thy mind with tediousness, or to weary
thy mind with reading, so gross and rude Letters, deuoyde of skill or
conninge, I commit the to GOD, who defend and save thee for ever.

Thy poor freende John Phillip.

A faithful Warnyng, to the true hearted Subjects of England.
WHat means the ragynge minds,
of cruel careless sort?
To raunge with rage whose chollor hot
they deem a sweet disporte.
Or why do Papists mutter so,
in every corner now?
Such tidinges strange, as scarsly they
in trial dare auow.
Their tongues to tell forth lies,
they daily do employ:
To sclaunder truth, and godly men,
they take exceeding joy.
As rechlesse forth they raunge,
regarding naught at all:
Some live in hope again to see
the worship of God Baall.
And still they boast thereof,
as perverse Papists will:
They spit their poison where they please,
as Hydras whelps full ill.
And here they pry, and there they spy,
their equals forth to find:
And often in Paul's they parley forth
their spiteful cankered mind.
Yea, still they talk of news,
and then their minds they say:
But partinge then, adieu says one,
unto the Golden day.
When we shall have our wills,
and purpose come to pass:
And eke enjoy as we do wish,
our long desired Mass.
And then shall go to wrack,
the brood that Luther bred:
Old custom shall supply the Church,
which error now has fed.
Thus prate they as they list,
in secret muttringe sort:
Not basshing such pernicious talk,
to parley and report.
Some wish the Basan Bull,
might have the rulinge sway:
Who (as they boast) shall them restoare
unto there Golden day.
Some wish the waueringe Moon,
might quite Eclips the Sun:
And thus before their wits we see,
some Papists tounges do run.
Some wish ye Redco^bde bird might crow,
and bear away the game:
But yet his comb may hap be cut,
for practisinge the same.
And long this savage crewe,
of Bonner made account:
To Throne of Londons rule again,
in Golden day should mount.
Who then would make our Protestants,
the Cuckoes song to singe:
Or else with faggottes fiery flames,
to ruin them to bring.
But God berefte their hope,
which vainly fed their mind:
And unto his elected Church,
a pleadge of love assinde.
For when they bragged most,
to have there Golden day:
Then God by death did overthrow,
the pillar of their stay.
And then they hunge their heads,
as men that wanted brains:
And sobbingly did show by sighs,
their strange tormentinge pains.
Some the^ were drowned in deep despair,
that long in hope did live:
Yea, some did show with streams,
what grief his death did give.
Thus were the Papists drencht
in fluddes of flowinge woe:
As plainly men might see and view,
by their external shoe.
As every subject will,
that God and truth does love:
Indeuer to the uttermost,
these Rebels rage to move.
And seek in Princes cause,
and quarrel to contend:
As far as life and worldly pelf,
will serve for to extend.
Although the wave ringe Moon,
and other of his crewe:
As does the Bull and so the rest,
rebelliously renew.
To bring again to Throne
the Bore that fometh so:
Which fears by force of sincere truth,
his Kingdom to forgo.
And therefore has begone to work,
according to his skill:
With greedy tuskes to pray upon,
all such as hate his will.
What havoc has he made?
how toils he evermore?
For to deface the blood of Christ,
and such as him adore:
His pompous pride, his Pagans heart,
corrupt and most unjust:
Delights with Martirs blood to quentch,
his hot and Woluishe thurst,
Not Phallaris the fearce,
the Bulls of Brass did frame:
To vex the Saints that did delight,
to praise Christ's holy name.
In tyranny does more exceed,
then does this Tiger wood:
Whose exercise is wholly bent,
to spill the faithfuls blood.
As Nero sought to butcher those,
that Idolles did disdain:
So does this Borish Brock with sword,
his maingie Mass maintain.
As Traiean did extort we read,
when he did Septer hold
In Rome, as lawful Emperor,
the sheep of Christ's fold.
So does this Romish Wolf,
not spare to take his pray:
And where he may, no Sheep nor Lamb,
his teeth can escape away.
As has been heard and seen,
in France and Flaunders late:
Where cruel Pharo furiously,
does maintain his estate.
And so torments the Fold,
and flock of Christ in deed:
That for to hear the faithful hearts,
may cause with woe to bleed.
In France by Civil war,
the Pope has plaide his part:
His toil is seen, Gods open truth
by force for to subuart.
What slaughter has been there,
to us has not ben hid:
Ne yet to them that thousands have,
from out this life ben rid.
Their country sore decaid*
their wealth decreased still:
And shall be sure if case the Pope,
may have his wisshed will.
For as he hates the truth,
and seeks to hide the same:
So does he seek to butcher those,
that love and fear Gods name.
And where as Gods most sincere word,
does seek to take a root:
This viper does attempt by force,
to tread it under foot.
But Heaven and Earth, says Christ,
shall perish and decaie:
When his eternal verity,
unspotted still shall stay.
And though Saul hauock make of his,
and touch them to the quick:
Let Saul take heed, for hard it is
to spurn against the prick.
For though his Curres a time,
do persecute and spoil:
At last Gods truth maugre there might,
shall give his foes the foil.
In spite of all his crew,
that purpose his advance:
Gods truth through knowledge at the last
shall rule and reign in France.
He shall confound that careless train,
those Iabins fearce and fell,
Which spoil his Church, and kill his Saints
that love his dear Gospel.
In steed of war and bloody fight,
he shall establish peace:
And plant his word, even there as here,
when Papistrie shall cease.
In Flaunders to discourse,
the Tirannie which is there:
Not only strikes the heart with grief,
but noyes the Christian ear.
As well by fight as other wise*
the Popish train do toil:
To wast and harm the godly ones,
their goods to pray by spoil.
Young men, and Uirgines pure,
which God and truth do love:
O violent rigor from this life,
by dent of death does move.
The Husband from his Wife,
by violence is refte:
And oftentimes the wife even then,
all Husbandles is left.
And all to keep the Pope in Throne,
God knows a heavy thing:
When Darnell shall be caused thus,
by Princes power to spring.
As late a Pageant strange,
by force inured there:
Upon a worthy man of God,
servant of Christ so dear.
John Camberlaine he hight,
in Arms a worthy man:
Whose hawtie courage, all the train
of Papists witness can.
So zealous in his Masters cause,
his doctrine to maintain:
As pressed for to resist the crewe,
of Popish doctors vain.
So valliant in the field,
to cheer his Souldiars all:
That Camberlaine they wail with tears,
and often this Captain call.
Who to the Papists was a prick,
and cause of gripinge grief:
Unto the Protestants in need,
a comfort and relief.
Against this godly wight,
in Arms renowned so:
His enemies conspierd still,
to give him cause of woe.
And God permitting them,
this Captain true to take:
A sacrifice unto him self,
this Camberlaine did make.
In prison they him cast,
sore clogd with iron bands:
Which as reward, the faithful reap,
at these preude Papists hands.
No triumph small was made,
that Camberlaine was caught:
The Popes own pigges right joyful were
the faithful took great thought.
And Camberlaine in fetters clogd,
to God did call for aid:
To strengthen him with patience,
for constancy he praide.
That as he had begone to taste,
the fulness of his grace:
So in his truth he would confirm,
his frail and mortal race.
Corroborat Lord this carkas now,
which is but dust and slime:
All torments strange for to endure,
for testimony thine.
I know as thou my Christ,
of worldlings were contemd:
And under Pilate or the Jews,
to cruel death condemd.
So shall thy servant liynge here,
with fetters sore oppressed:
Among the brood of currish Caines*
with death be due distressed.
I read that thy Electes,
by Tirantes have been slain:
I read that Herod for thy sake,
put Infants young to pain.
And afterward the Tetriarcke,
which Herod also hight:
For Herodias sake, John Baptist head,
in prison of did smight.
I read that Peter and S. Paul,
by Nero lost their lives:
And so these Curres of Neroes brood,
thy Saints from breath depriues.
And shall thy servant then,
now subject to thy cross:
Despair one whit to follow thee?
or think his life a loss?
No, no my God, for since the world
have thee no favor shown:
Now should they love, or favor those
which aye remain thine own.
Oh should thy servant thee exceed,
since thou was well content:
With thy heart blood upon the Cross,
to seal thy Testament.
Since they have persecuted thee,
thy Saints, and Prophets pure:
How should they spa^e, to vex thy Flock,
which in thy truth endure?
These Popish Traieans brood,
the bluddringe Balams blind:
To vex thee in thy members still,
occasion do find.
But Lord when thou shall think it meet,
rise up, redress the wrong:
That thy elected Church and Saints,
have now endured long.
With draw their necks from Pharos yoke
thy heavy cross remove:
Not as I will, but as thou will,
O rulinge Jove above:
And fortefie this brittell Flesh,
so weak and frail my Christ:
That to the death, with loss of blood
thy foes I may resist.
This carkas is the pray,
that Papists think to spoil:
To reaue from it my breathed life,
with hot desire they toil.
But so confirm my faith,
when perilles present be:
That fear of death constrain me not,
to swerve or straie from thee.
The Chaos of this fleash,
is mould and slippery dust:
Then whereunto, or unto whom,
should I thy servant trust.
But only unto thee my God,
whose mercy does abound:
Which to relieve thy Saints oppressed,
by grace mean have found.
To thee I still appeal,
to thee I call and cry:
My faith persuades me I am thine,
although my fleash shall dye.
And with thy preaching Paul,
who rests in thy hands:
I covet Lord dissolved to be,
from these terrestrial bands.
But when it shall thee please,
thy Sion hill restore:
Reedefie Jerusalem,
deface the Popish Lore.
The Turrets of proud Babylon,
in mercy overthrow:
That all the world a mighty God,
thy Majesty may know.
This said, the Tormentours in have,
from prison him convey:
To Brussels in the market steed,
where they their Pagents play.
So strange to hear and know,
as any heart would bleed:
To think that worthy Camberlaine,
should so be vexte in deed.
Whose pains so passinge were,
so perilous and great:
That any Pagan would abhor,
to work so vilde a feate.
For passinge by the Bishops gate,
a gate so named there:
With knife in hand, a slaughter man
to Camber. did appear.
And unto him approached fast,
and cut of both his ears:
Which fact of those that fear the Lord,
requiers bloody tears.
But yet as vncontent,
they prosecute their ill:
They spoil him of his robes and then,
they whip and scourge him still.
Unto the fiery flames, where he
shall fine his vital life:
Where they his torments to enlarge,
do show them selves full rife,
And then with pron Tongues,
in fire burninge hot:
They pinch, and pull his flesh from boanes
all mercy is forgot.
But he oppressed with pain,
to God does call and cry:
To place his soul among his Saints,
above the Starrie sky.
But when his flesh from boanes,
is plucked in many a place:
About the market steed with whippes,
they Camberlaine do chase.
So that no part of him is free,
from bloody streams so read:
And then to fiery flames again,
this Godly man is led.
Where as they did before,
they double more his pain:
From boanes to pluck his tender flesh,
the Tormenters are feign.
But still he cries to God,
to aid him in that case:
And at the last to grant to him,
in Heaven a resting place.
The Tormentors again,
to take their whippes prepare:
About the market him to scourge,
they pr^st and ready are.
This done, unto a stake they bind
and tie this Godly wight:
And on the top, a burninge tubbe,
of pitch the Papists pight.
So that the drops did light a pace,
upon his tender skin:
This kind of pain did Camberlaine,
for Christ's Gospel win.
Who then amidst his panges of pain,
did never more oblight:
To mighty God for to commend,
his ghost and troubled spright.
And often he wished that Antichrist,
might have an utter fall:
And that the truth might published be,
to overthrow of Baall.
But still these Uipers fell, alas,
have sought his torments still,
And iiii. foot distant from the stake,
to show their cursed will.
A fire huge they frame,
to compass Camber. bound:
Whose ardent heat about the stake,
constraines him to run round.
Till God from Heaven cast down his eyes
his torments to assuage:
Who now no doubt does rest in joy,
most free from Papists rage.
Judge ye that have Gods fear,
judge ye these Papists spite:
And magnify the God of Gods,
for Camberlaine that wight.
Whose praise in spite of death,
shall live and last for aye:
Maugre all those that wish and look,
for such a Golden day.
That they may burn and whip,
as Papists learn by skill:
All those that seem for to prefer,
Gods Testament and will.
Also the late attempted fact,
in Skottish zoyle and land:
Which cruel clownishe caitife late,
to practice took in hand.
Does plain discourse to me,
what fruits in Traitors rain:
As well records the Noble blood,
Lord Ieamie lately slain.
With thundringe stroke of gunne,
and eger pearsinge shot:
A grief to comely Courtiers sure,
and subjects true God wot.
This Regents death is wept,
with sobbes in many a place:
Who with the sound of justice sought,
disorder to deface.
His truth and Noble skill,
in Arms was not unknown:
A prick to those which unto truth,
were heinous mortal fone.
But cursed be that Tiger fell,
that Gorgon fearce and wood:
Which greedely to quench his thirst,
did shed Lord Ieamies blood.
Woe worth that Caitifes hand,
that made the simple morn:
Whose stroke of gun, with heaps of ioies
the Papists did adorn.
But so torments the minds,
of those that faithful be:
That brinish streams does show to them
a dismal day they see.
But yet perhaps* this verlet vile,
which did commit this fact:
May Canonised be a Saint,
by Pope for that his act.
For Cronicles discourse to me,
Alphonsus borne in Spain:
Which did the Lore of Pope we see,
by study long maintain.
Did so disdain his brother dear,
Diazius by name:
Who then with Bucer sought to preach,
the word of life and fame.
That all in rage against reasons skill,
and natures skillful Lore:
He sought for to convert him still,
as busied evermore.
To hate the truth, but all in vain
Diazius faithful was:
And sought by truth him to allure,
from pelting Popish Mass.
And then Alphonsus fainde him self,
converted for to be:
And outward iesture made it play,
as all estates might see.
He seemd with tongue to speak,
that heart disdained quight,
Against the Poape he fained then,
with earnest truth to fight.
His brother was right glad in mind,
and Joyful in his heart,
That Alphonse did from Papistrie,
to sincere truth conuarte.
And often embraste him in his arms,
and kissed his tender face,
Eke he with tears repentaunt seemde,
though doubleness had place.
And faining to depart from thence,
a letter did endight,
And hierd a Slave to bear the same,
to Diazius poor wight
Who nothing slow to execute,
his purpose and his will,
A hatchet brought under his cloak,
Diazius to kill.
And as he to peruse the same,
was diligent in deed:
The Hangman cleft into his head,
while he the same did read.
Then home to Rome Alphonsus fled,
pursuit was after made:
But yet the Popes most sacred Bull,
causde Justice skill to fade.
And for this bloody murder shown,
he Canonised was:
A Saint, such zeal has peevish Pope,
to his most wicked Mass.
And so this Clown which late we hear,
Lord James with gunne did kill:
The Pope may hap to make a Saint,
so diuelishe is his will.
Judge now the Iuglinge castes they use,
judge you the cruel trade:
Judge you the cause of Civil strife,
the Pope this time has made.
Whose cruelty is such,
expressed every where:
That unto such as love Gods truth,
right noisome is to hear.
Was Nero half so wood,
as are our Papists now:
The Turks that hear this cruelty,
will not the same allow.
Not Phallaris so cruel was,
such torments to devise:
As do our Bloudhoundes in defense,
of their late written lies.
Though Dioclesian cruel were,
to butcher Christ's flock:
Which unto Jupiter his God,
for mercy would not knock.
Not half so merciless was he,
as seem our Papists aye:
For some would bite, which now do bark
to have a Golden day.
But whence does spring the cause,
and ground of all this strife?
Even from the filthy Seas of Rome,
in mischief very rife.
Whose wares began to smell,
as dunge and durtie dross:
And therefore like a ravenous Wolf,
the Saints of God does toss.
And now the time is come he sees,
that truth must run his race:
He fears the wrack of Babylon,
and of his Papal place.
He fears his pelting pardons now,
no longer will be sold:
And therefore strives with footh and nail
his trinckets to uphold.
He fears his slender God,
his Robin in his box:
He fears no man will be so mad,
to call to Stoanes and Stocks.
He dreades a sudden change,
may happen soon to fall:
Which him and his, if truth run forth
may speedely appall.
And therefore sends forth,
with thundryng voice his curse:
Wherewith he thinks, to stay and cause
his foes to speed the worse.
And then he stirs up freindes,
and Pardon does them send:
That in his cause, and quarrel will
by force of Arms contend.
Thus seeks he to obscure the truth,
which God will have to reign:
Yea, to divide al Kingdoms now,
employed is his pain.
Where peace should ay remainynge be,
he Battle does procure:
Where love should reign, ye fruits of hate
he travels to invre.
As has in France and Flaunders sure*
continued very song:
And now into our English pale,
he seeks fast to thronge.
And many Northen Dawes,
aquaynt them with his Grace:
And seem to burn their Bibels pure,
and Mass books plant in place.
Some seem to disanull the thing,
that God and Queen allows:
And seek to prosecute apace,
their Popish peltinge vows.
The brood of Balaams Priests,
their Coapes did soon assay:
And some in London then had thought,
to have their Golden day.
When they might knock and kneel,
and crutch to Mass again:
When they might pray, and suck the blood
of such as truth maintain.
But then their hope suppressed,
and dashed by Princess might:
And both the Moon and Bull for fear,
had take them selves to flight.
And these pestiferous Priests,
which Mass began to singe:
Were trussed up, and sent to Heaven
as some say in a stringe.
The portly Bear. the shininge STAR*
this whurly burly ceast:
In Princess cause, have rebels rage
by Justice skill dicreast.
And quiet made those storms,
which then did seem to floe:
And quenched quite, those glimering sparks
that then began to gloe.
Even suddenly the wavering Moon*
so apt for every change:
As eke the Bull, which after him
most fickelly did raunge.
Had lost the day, that lingering hope
to gain their minds had fed:
Another Bird of careless kind,
after their Pipes was led.
As well content, to tread the dance
that they had so begone:
As into further peril sure,
disordredly to run.
And now with foreign power,
they mixed do remain:
Intendinge by their practice found,
to work their Countries pain.
They naught regard the Princess love,
her favor they disdain:
Also her offered Pardon late,
the Bull, and Moon thought vain.
And contrary unto their Oaths,
unto their Princess plight:
They took the field against her grace,
and offered there to fight.
But then the STAR prepared in post,
their malice to withstand:
And at the last a prudent Bear*
would take the Bull in hand.
The Moon was quaild, the Bulls heart faild
they fled away for fear:
And left their Soldiars in the field,
dispersed here and theare.
Who hearing these two Champions fled,
began to shifte for life:
But England has just cause to hate,
the Authors of this strife.
But then the Redcombd byrd in field,
in Princes cause was found:
With Spear and Shield by force of Arms
those Rebels to confound.
And none more pressed, then he was there
for to pursue the chase:
Of those that sought, as perjured wights
to disobay her Grace.
But when these storms were calmd,
and every thing at rest:
Even then to join with them, we hear
the careless Bird thought best.
And being a faithful feathered Bird,
disceyte has chokte his heart.
But God I pray for Christ's sake,
their stony minds conuart.
And overthrow the enterprice,
that they have take in hand:
Which only tendes the Laws of God,
and Princess to withstand.
But if their minds corrupt,
do Devilish custom love:
And that to place the Pope in Throne,
this discord now they move.
Let them take heed, for God is just,
and Maugre all their might:
As he has done, so will he now
for his Elected fight.
When Pharo did oppress,
the Isralites we read:
He plagued him and all his Land,
with sundry Plagues in deed.
And Maugre Pharoes Host,
and fortitude so strong:
He brought them thence, and drowned those
that would his people wrong.
And is he not? the same God now
like wonders for to show:
On those that neither will his might,
nor Gospel learn to know.
Think you his Arm does weaken now:
or is his power less?
At this present, then then it was
his foes for to suppress.
If not, why seek ye then
his Honor to decay?
And that the Pope in England should,
again bear rulinge sway.
Where are your English hearts become?
is truth and faith now fled?
Have ye forgot the place, where ye
where borne and also bred?
Regard ye not your Nourse,
your Native zoyle and Land:
Whose Honor you are bound to seek,
and all her fees withstand.
Your God ye should obey,
his word you ought to love:
Your Crown and Country to defend,
it would you all behoue.
First God to Honor ye are bound,
for giuinge breathed life:
For blessyng you with wealths increase,
as you have felt full rife.
And next your Queen whose clemency,
ye have both known and felt:
Which bountuously unto you all,
her gracious gifts has dealt.
As well for that her Grace,
is heir unto the Crown:
And child unto the Eight Henry,
a Prince of hie renown.
As also that her Majesty,
all errors does suppress:
And travels still, that Gods truth may
in England have success.
And to your Country ye be bound,
as Nature does you will:
Because that she has Nursed you up,
ye ought to love her still.
In her Defense ye ought with sword,
as well in Princess cause:
In bloody field to strive against,
all those that hate her laws.
But you forget all this,
no God, nor Prince ye fear:
Ne to your Country any love,
your deeds do prove you bear.
But even as Catterpillers sure,
ye seek her wealth to spoil:
But God is able by his power,
to give you all the foil.
When that his people have been vexed,
by Tirants raginge ire:
As now your Pope this rule to keep,
perhaps does you require.
Whose peltinge Pardon ye enjoy,
to make your hearts so strong:
That forth ye rush, to work your wills
suppressinge right for wrong.
What are ye now absolu'd
from thrift and fall to sin?
Or does the Pope to make you Saints,
for this practice begin?
Why then, its Cock: ye may be bold,
the Heavens shall be your own:
I blame ye not if your good wills,
to further him be shown.
But hark ye Balaams blind,
if Popish Saints ye be:
The darkness with clear light,
at no time can agree.
Can Christ an^ Belliall love?
can truth a falsehood be?
Or shall the Goats expulse the Lambs,
from Heaven confess to me?
No more can you his Saints,
the Flock of God deface:
Ne yet his Pardon grant to you,
in Heaven a resting place.
But yet if cursed cruel Cain,
which shed just Abels blood:
For Homicide shall win the Heavens?
then Christ shall do you good.
If Arius that Heretic,
enjoy felicity?
Then shall your Pope, and you his Saints
which are as ill as he.
If Judas for betraying Christ,
shall reign in Heaven on hie?
So shall the Pope, and you his Saints
I can it not deny.
If Mahomet that Prophet false,
eternity do gain?
Then shall the Pope, and you his Saints
in Heaven be sure to reign.
If Julius Apostata,
with Christ a place possess?
So shall the Pope, and you his Saints
of force I must confess.
But hark, prepare your ears to hear
what tidinges I shall tell:
As these for their most wicked lives,
did sincke down into Hell.
So shall the Pope, and all his Saints
unless they do repent:
Receive like hyre, when Christ from Heaven
to Judge us shall be sent.
For none more prone then he,
the truth for to withstand:
And none more apt then are his Saints
to take the sword in hand*
To fight against Gods heavenly truth,
and those that love the same:
Such zeal have they unto the dross,
that peltinge Popes did frame.
What truth their doctrine has,
is easy for to try:
A man may Judge the fruits thereof,
that has but half an eye.
No truth contaynes the same,
therein is flatly coutcht
A heap of errors false and vain,
which they for truth have voucht.
Then cursed are they then,
that Heresies maintain:
And teach untruths, in steed of truth
the Apostell says plain.
If Christ's death and precious blood,
shed forth upon the Cross:
Unable be to pourge our sin,
and pay to God our loss.
His death was vain I judge,
his blood was shed in waste:
Which all that know and trust therein,
do know the gain they taste.
By faith they purged are,
from sin in his sweet blood:
Though now the Pope, do tell to us
a tale of Robin hood.
Who comes with peltinge pardons now,
and stinkinge Bulls of lead:
To Pardon sin, and would cause us
under our feet to tread.
The blood of Christ, that heavenly Lamb
(a pretty Iuglinge cast)
But God from Heaven with vengeance hot
this Monster vile will blast.
Yea, he will break the crewe,
of all the Popish brood:
That hope to have a Golden day,
to shed more Martyrs blood.
Yea, Christ will swage the greedy thirst,
of cruel careless Cain:
Which persecute his members still,
and put his Saints to pain.
He will not leave his Church,
to languish in distress:
Though he permit some Tirants still,
her Children to oppress.
But as a faithful husband sure,
he does his Church regard:
And at the last amidst his wrath,
his foes will sure reward.
Yea, he will break the Jaws
of Antichrist so wood*
Which greedely his Woluish thirst,
does quench with-Martyrs blood.
When OG and ZEON sought to spoil,
the Israelites I find:
A Ieptha for to shield his flock,
the mighty God assinde.
When that Phelistia sought,
with Israel to strive:
A Sampson God did raise at last,
to den his foes to drive.
When Ahab did displease the Lord,
and Iesabell his Queen:
Whose havoc to oppress his Saints,
full greedely was seen.
He waxed wroth, and plagued her
in his most furious mood:
She brake her neck, the dogs at last
did lap her gilty blood.
When ^abins Captain Cisera.
did sore oppress Gods fold:
God raised a Debora we read,
to make his heart full cold.
When that Assyria annoide,
Samaria in deed:
God by his power, fought for them
and from their foes them freede.
When Oliphemus did assault,
Bethulia I find:
A valiant Judith unto them,
the mighty God assingd.
When that Antiochus did extort,
the people of the Lord:
And sought for to distroy them clean,
by force of bloody sword.
God raise a Machabeus then,
his flock Elect to shield:
Thus unto his oppressed Church,
God comfort still does yield.
And what have these his foes?
vnplagued gonne away:
No, Cysera lost his life I read,
in Tent where hid he lay.
And Oliphernus lost his head,
by Iudiths valiant hand:
Thus God does fight for Sions health,
you Foes may understand.
What? was not Haman hanged on
the tree he did prepare:
To hang the Jews, why then I red
some Papists to beware?
Antiochus was plagued sore,
in Chariot where he lay:
The worms did drop out of his flesh,
as you can not denay.
The Bible forth does show,
a number such as these:
Which plagued were, because the Lord,
they did so sore displease.
For which some Papists look,
and thereof make great boast:
And then as late they did, be sure
the faithful they will roast.
Then rigor should have rule,
where mercy now does reign:
And fire and faggots should not fail,
your Mass for to maintain.
You long to have your Holy water,
and holy bread again:
Ye long to have your little round God,
in Pix for to remain.
You long to have a popish priest,
to sing a pelting Mass:
Ye wish to have the Church again,
abused as it was.
But God your longing can depose,
though long therefore ye look:
Your Golden day may chance to cause,
Your necks to stand a crook.
And therefore leave your whispering you,
that daily gape for news:
Take heed all ye that do Paul's Church,
in order such abuse.
Repent, amend and call for grace,
while God does lend you time:
Embrace the truth and skorne it not,
least vengeance plague your crime.
And ye that stand in doubt my freindes,
cast all your doubts away:
And unto Gods eternal truth,
trust as your only stay.
For if ye stray from Christ,
and unto Satan cleave:
He will when you have greatest need,
in danger still you leave.
For who so does forsake the Lord,
for fear of worldly loss:
And thinks skorne upon his back,
to take his Masters Cross.
Is far unmeet to have a place,
with Christ in Heaven above:
As plainly he in his Gospel,
at large does show and prove.
And now ye that do raunge at large,
like Papists stout and bold:
In many a place of London sure,
when tidinges strange are told.
Refrain your tounges, beware he^ceforth
what you do speak and say:
For God regards his little Fold,
we have the Golden day.
His Gospel pure is truly taught,
and Preachers ready are:
To us out of his holy Law,
our duties to declare.
The Sacraments are ministered,
as Christ to us has tought:
Wherein we learn what he for us,
by his dear death has wrought.
For as we eat material Bread,
and Drink material Wine:
So spiritually we feed by Faith,
on Christ's flesh divine.
And so we drink his precious Blood,
to cheer our Souls with all:
Not grossly as you Papists say,
with outward teeth Carnal.
But Spiritually by Faith,
upon his Flesh we feed:
And so we Drink his precious Blood,
to comfort us in deed.
Then have we not a Golden day?
the Lord prolonge the same:
That in his fear, henceforth we may
practice our lives to frame.
And so be thankful to our God,
for these his gifts of grace:
That he may still behold our days,
with his most loving face.
That all our words and deeds henceforth,
may learn so to accord:
That we with hearts unfeigned may,
still live and Laud the Lord.
And next our gracious Queen,
so Honor and obaye:
That England may be freed still,
from Papists Golden day.
Which unto those that fear the Lord,
and love his Ueritie:
Through rigor and extorted force,
a dismal day would be.
From which Lord fend thy littel flock,
and give our foes a fall:
Confound those cruel Caines (O Lord)
that for a change do call.
And so thy truth do grafte,
with in our tender heart:
That from thy truth and Testament,
no danger cause us start.
Confound the rage of Rebels stout,
Lord be our strength and Tower:
As from the Turk so shield us Lord,
from force of Popish power.
Abate their pride which wilful be,
in lingringe hope to stay:
Protect thy Fold, defend thy Church
from Papists Golden day.
Advance thy Gospel still,
let not thy praise decaie:
Stretch forth thine arm, and shield us still
from Papists Golden day.
Let all that love thy Testament,
with hearts unfeigned pray:
That never more in England here,
the Pope have Golden day.
Increase the number of thy fold,
thy mercy Lord displaie:
Prolonge among thy simple sheep,
this happy Golden day.
That we thy pasture may attain,
and so thy word obaie:
That we at no time need to fear,
the Papists Golden day.
Come have thy kingdom mighty God,
come Jesus Christ we pray:
That all our foes, may learn and know
we have a Golden day.
Our Realm and Queen defend dear God,
with heart and mind I pray:
That by thy aid her Grace may keep,
the Papists from their day.
Her health, her wealth, and vital race
in mercy long increase:
And grant that Civil war and strife,
in England still may cease.
Confound the pupose and devise,
of all that careless crewe:
Which seek by force for to withstand,
thy word and Gospel true.
Preserve the Counsel of this Realm,
let thy Sprite be their stay:
That they their Council may employ,
to break the Papists day.
Send Preachers true good Lord,
thy Gospel to display:
That by their travel they may let,
the Papists Golden day.
The Commons of this Realm defend,
that love may ay abound:
And grant obedience to our Queen,
may ever more be found.
That as she faithful is,
her Subjects ay to love:
So true and trusty unto her,
our hearts may ever prove.
Thus shall the mighty God,
be our Defense and stay:
And keep the cruel Papists still,
from their long wished day.
And we shall have as God do grant,
to Papists swift decay:
The word of grace sincerely Preached,
which is our Golden day.
Which to continue long,
to God let us all pray:
Whose glorious name be Lauded still,
for this our Golden day.
FINIS.
