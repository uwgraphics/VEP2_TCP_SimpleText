A Looking-glass for City and Country: Wherein is to be seen many fearful
examples in the time of this grievous Visitation, with an admonition to our
Londoners flying from the City; and a perswasior Country to be more pitiful to
suchas come for succor amongst them.


OH London, thou Paragon of this Kingdom for beauty and brave buildings, how
art thou now widowed of thy chiefest Inhabitants, how art thou left
disconsolate, for lack of thy Merchants, and industricus tradesmen, how sit^st
thou mourning for loss of thy sons and daughters, all the Gentry, that of late
made thee their Sanctury of safety has now left thee, and with the wings of
fear flies from thee as from a place of terror, by reason of this grievous
visitation here laid upon thee, where to the number of 16000 of thy ablest
Inhabitants are departed into the Country, as they have been lately numbered
in diverse of thy Parishes

Besides, the hourly ringing of dead men's knels, the digging up of graves, the
shutting up of doors, the blazing forth of Red Crosses, and the setting Lord
have mercy upon us. upon the forefront of infected houses, makes the remainder
of thy Inhabitants hearts to tremble and qua^e, and to say, what shall we do
to save our lives.

Some flies to their tender hearted Parents to be succored, some to their
brothers and sisters, some to their dearest acquaintance, some to their lands
and livings in the Country, to their fair builded houses, leaving their goods
and all they have here behind them in this City, as it were in the keeping of
strangers.

What multitudes do we see daily passing into all Countries and shi^es of this
Kingdom, with their whole families, some to one place some to another, not
daring once to look back to this discomforted City, both by Wagon,
Coach-horse and foot, even as it were bearing packs upon their backs to lodge
upon.

Oh you men of much fear, why do you thus do? In not God as strong there as
here, does not his servant death as soon strike you in the Country, as in the
City: wheresoever you go or fly he can find you forth: descend into the
depths of the earth, there he will follow you, if you a^cend the clouds he is
there also, if to the sea, he will be there likewise, and at his pleasure with
his pale Dart of vengeance he will suddenly strike you.

There is no flying from God, for his hand, is both swift and strong, and can
in the twinkling of an eye if so he please destroy us all, and follow us in any
place wheresoever we seek to hide our selves: go not away, but stay by it,
set to your helping hands to relieve the poor which now are shut up in the
time of this grievous visitation, and then no doubt but God in his mercy will
stay his heavy wrath and indignation, here inflicted upon us.

Yet man I see is mistrustfull, and dares not trust God so much in the City as
in the Country, else would they not fly so fast as they do, but rather stay
here to comfort the inflicted, and soonerly at home in their down beds, then
upon hard flocks abroad.

Great are the woes of many flying Citizens, that for want of lodging, are
forced to lie in the fields in haycocks, and pads of straw: some in Barnes,
some in stables, some in sheepecots, some in hog-houses, yea most in simple
cottages, where the fearful Country people dare hardly come near them, but
ever keep upon the wind side, lest this doubted infection should blow upon
them.

I have heard of a young man of this City that in this present sickness, went
to his father in the Country to be received, who would give him no
entertainment, till he had washed himself stark naked in a pond of water, and
so without raiment to come naked into his house, where new clothes were ready
provided for him, and the old ones cast quite away, this was the fear of a
father to his son.

Others I have known lodged in Barnes for a whole month together before they
were suffered to come in any house, (though their nearest kinsfolks) to prove
if they were infected or not, and then with much fear they were received in:
all which is now our Citizens usage in many Countries, so great is the doubt of
simple people.

There scarcely can a Citizen pass the highways without a Certificate, as
the use of vagrants are, but must be either conuayed from town with bills and
clubs, or kept out at the towns end as Gypsies have been in times past.

Oh misery, upon misery, that one English man should thus use another and to b^
so estranged, that they will hardly let a Traveler have a piece of bread, or a
cup of small drink for his money, unless he will eat and drink it by the
highway, and after receiving money they will wash it in a bowl of clean water,
for fear the silver should have the Infection.

Many have dyed traveling by the way for want of succor and warm lodging,
and being dead they have been buried clothes and all, without prayer or Church
rights belonging to Christian burial, most like unto Infidels, or as beasts
without souls.

The usage of the Country is so hard that at this present time that a fathers
house have been shut up for giving his son but one nights lod^ing, and not
suffered to come abroad for a whole months space, though never so clear from
infection.

These and such like are the terrors of the Plague, which makes the Countryman
shun a Londoner as from a Bazaliske or Cockatrice, whose very sight and eyes
seems to carry infection: some of them at a Citizens passing by, will close up
their doors, and look out a far off (...) their windows, to see if they pass
through the Town and not call i^ at any house at all.

This makes London now almost a forsaken City, for her Marke^s are greatly
decayed, and grow barren, for the Country-woman dares not bring up her butter,
cheese, eggs and such like things, but sel^s them more dearer by the way as
she comes, and more quicker, then if they should furnish our Markets with the
same, and being come hither, she is in danger of shuting up at her return
back, for the very money she takes for her commodities is thought to bring the
Plague down with it into the Country.

Not a Carier is scarce suffered to bring up provision for the City, nor bear
the like down again, but is kept out of the Town from whence he came and
dwells, and himself and his cattle compelled t^ lie in the fields, and not
any of them suffered to carry down people either young or old, though their own
sons, sisters, brothers or daughters, such are the sorrows of these times, God
amend them when his good will and pleasure is.

It is reported that in Greenwich a Noblemans footman coming by very sick,
died in a Barn, for which the owner thereof, had both his Barn, and his house
shut up for a whole month after, and none of his household suffered to come
abroad, which is a more cruelty and strictness then is here now in London,
where the hand of God now heavily strikes.

For here the care of our Magistrates is such, that seeing the distress of the
poor growing great by reason of rich men's leaving the City, that should
supply them with relief, and the deadness of the time, when poor men would
work if they had it, and having wrought they cannot get money when they have
earned it, all this considered the care of our King has been graciously cast
upon us, in commanding the poor, and such as be shut up to be mercifully
looked unto, and most favorably comforted by our Magistrates.

The providence of the Lord Mayor is greatly to be commended in requesting the
Companies of the City to extend their benevolence to the poor and infected
houses, by whose appointment the same is weekly most charitably given: likewise
his care deserves the like commendations, in persuading the people of ability
to give their weekly reliefes to the poor that are not able to help
themselves: also the zeal of our Preachers, that morning evening, and at all
times humbly desires God to be merciful to this distressed City now in the
hand of God, even ready to be destroyed.

And now to conclude, it is not your flying from the City, the leaving your
houses, almost empty in every street, your going into fresh airs and pleasant
fields, nor your abiding in Country houses can keep you from this terrible
stroke of death, for you there are visited as well as here, and dye as suddenly
in the Country, as we in London.

Many could I name at this present time, that no sooner settled in the Country,
as they think in safety, but have dyed presently, therefore it is prayer and
true contrition of sins that must allay Gods heavy wrath, and not your lurking
in corners, and by places, for Death can find you every where he goes before
you, he follows after, he bears you company, he spares none, neither Prince
nor Peasant, old nor young, be they never so noble, rich, strong, wise, learned,
or running in Physic, he comes into your counting houses and ki^^eth your
money tellers, he overthrows the dancer, and stops, ^he sweet voice of the
singer, he breaks wedlock, makes widows, fatherless children, and comes in
the Chambers of Merchants, their wives and families: therefore say not with the
heathen Philosophers that this Pestilence comes by mortal chance, by
concourse of stars infecting the air, corrupting and poisoning of living
things* No, it is the messenger of God, his scourge and cross to all (...)
good and bad, in the reward of sin, wherein we are all borne and ^^^ceiued:
Then Lord have mercy upon us, according to thy great ^^^cies and loving
kindness, To whom (Oh sweet Lord) we m^^e our daily Prayers, in this grievous
time of Visitation, trusting thou ^^ll most graciously hear us for thy dear
Sons sake our Saui^^r Jesus Christ, Amen.
