with Its admirable Diminution lately discovered. By Henry Gellibrand Professor

A DISCOVRSE MATHEMATICAL on the variation of the Magneticall Needle.
TO write an Encomiastique of the Magnet is not my intention; the bold and
confident attempts of Seamen, thorough those hidden paths of the vast Ocean, to
all navigable parts of the earth, will spare me the labor; neither will these
few lines permit me to speak of all Magneticall qualities, they that list may
have recourse for their satisfaction herein, to that most learned work
(admired by all Foreiners) long ago penned by Mr. Dr. Gilbert our countryman,
sometimes Physician to that Renowned Lady our late Queen. That which I here
principally aim at, is the deflection of the Needle from the Terrestrial
Meridian, together with that abstruse and admirable variation of the Variation,
lately discovered to the world.

The Variation then is the deflection of the Magneticall Meridian from the
Terrestrial, the Horizon determining its Quantity and Quality. These
Meridians sometimes are coincident, and in such places there can be no
Variation* Sometimes again they are different, and then that Hemispere wherein
either extremity of the Needle lies, denominates its Quality, for if it be the
Eastern Hemispere, it is called Easterly variation, if the western, westerly.
And the Horizon supposed (as all great Circles are) to be divided into 360
parts, and each part subdivided into Centesmes or Millesmes, defines the
Quantity as 10, 20, 30, etc. parts of variation.

For our more distinct proceeding (and to give some satisfaction to those that
are not altogether Mathematical) it will not be impertinent to our present
purpose to give some probable Reason for this variation or swarving of the
Needle from the meridians of most places.

Take a vigorous Magnet, convert it into a Sphericall Body, and having found
its Poles, delineat the same with Meridians, the Aequinoctiall, and Parallells.

Then take a fine sowing Needle, and applying it to the intersection of a
Meridian and the Aequinoctiall, it will be found precisely to point out the
Poles of the stone; and if the Needle be moved toward either Pole, according
to its own direction, it will trace out a Circle over the said Magnetique
Pole. But if this Sphaericall Magnet shall have a part of it excavated, as
admit about the forty fifth Parallel, and forty fifth Meridian or degree of
longitude, the Needle moved forwards from the foresaid intersection, as soon as
it shall draw near to the limb of this excavation, will forthwith leave its
former position, as lying in the plane of the prime meridian, and incline to
the other solid side, not respecting at all the aforesaid Poles: and this
deflection we call the variation of the Needle: And the greater will this
variation be, the nearer it approaches to the Poles. For whereas before the
excavation each side being a like potent, Which may be some cause of those
sudden and exorbitant variations in the Nortwest and other Northern and
Southern parts of the Earth.
the Needle like an upright and indifferent Arbiter inclined to neither part;
after the excavation it will convert it self to the more solid side,
rejecting the imperfect and defective, and so much the more powerfully, by how
much the other side shall be found to have lost more of its Magnetique vigorous
substance.

The like will fall out if the Needle be so placed, as that it shall bisect the
excavated part, for then will it acurately point out the true Poles of the
stone formerly found, but suddenly swerve from them after any little
dislocation, strongly applying it self to the more solid side.

As it is with this little, so likewise with the greater Magnet the Earth,
whose solid magnetique parts are great Continents, the defective and
excavated, the deep and vast channel of the Sea. For if there were
observations made in the midd way between the Easterly Coast of China and this
western of Europe, it is very probable there would be found no variation at
all, the Terrestrial and Magneticall Meridians being congruall; but if we
shall incline to either side, as admit to the westward, the Needle will in like
manner move it self to the Eastern Continent, as the more prevalent side, the
channel of the Sea being a part deficient of the Sphericall Body of the Earth,
and the Needle finding no encouragement to apply it self there to.

And so likewise for the Ocean, which palliates the imperfect parts of the
Earth, it is evident, that if the Needle shall equally divide the Marine
distance between two continents, there will be found no variation, as having
both the Meridians united, the Needle equally disposing itself to either
Continent. But if we shall swerue from this mediety, it will preponderate with
the next continent.

For the evidence of the truth hereof, let a man examaine generally the
variations of our most expert Seamen, (a Catalogue whereof we have annexed to
that accurate work of Mr. Wright in his detection and conection of errors in
Navigation) (although by reason of the diversities of the setts of their
Compasses and oftentimes unapt handling of their instruments, they very seldom
concur) observed in the Atlantique Ocean, from the Equator unto the parts of
Norway, all along the East Coast from the Meridian of the Azores, as far
North as has been discovered, and he shall find the ordinary practice to
testify the truth hereof. As also after the same manner from the Equator
southward, unto the streights of Magellan, and all along the back parts of
America in the South Sea, and on the East Coast unto the Cape of Bona Speranza,
and he shall perceive the like agreement; But in failing from the aforesaid
Cape further Eastward, that sometime they do find it otherwise, the cause
proceeds from the different situation of the South Continent hitherto
undiscovered. And whereas in the Atlantique Ocean about 135 leagues from the
Islands of Corues and Flores to the westward, Mr. John Wells.
there has been found by an able Artist no variation at all, it is a manifest
argument, that the Place is equidistant from the Europaean or Affrican
continents and the American: And as we approach to either Continent, so shall
we find the Needle praepotent in its conversion; from whence the variation
shall receive its denomination.

Therefore its absurd for Seamen to touch their Compasses with the allowance of
the variation of any particular place, considering this variation is
perpetually variable according to the ships motion.

And moreover its absolutely necessary for that Seaman who sails by his
Compass, continually to search the variatio^, that so by the
Prosthaphaereticall application thereof, the true point of the compass (which
is his principal Mercurialist) may be rectified.

And this artifice may be performed by the assistance of the Planets or fixed
Stars, and that either without or with their Altitudes. I shall not need to
exemplify all varieties, as having elsewhere copiously and demonstratively
delivered the same. I think it only convenient to touch lightly at one or two,
and such as best conduce to our present purpose.

And first without an Altitude. Find two fixed Stars of equal right
Ascension, and holding up a thread and plummet, observe when the thread bisects
them (for that is the exact Meridian of the place) and at that instant apply
the Compass to them; if the Needle precisely respect them, there is no
variation; if not, then is the difference, the variation inquired; and that
part of the Horizon to which it inclines, (always accounting from the same
intersection of the Horizon and Meridian) claims it.

It may likewise be performed by the Amplitude Ortive or Occiduall of the
Sun, and as well by night as by day, by the rest of the Planets or fixed
Stars, having only their declinations and the Latitude of the places, either
Geometrically by an Analemme, or Arithmetically by the help of the Canon of
Triangles, for the ordinary terms of the proportion run thus.

As the Sine complement of the Latitude, is to the Radius, So the Sine of the
declination, to the Sine of the Amplitude. Turning therefore the Compass to
the Sun or Stars, the difference of the Arcs is the variation inquired. Or
by knowing the time of the Suns incidence into the Plane of the Prime
vertical, after the like manner we may obtain our desires.

But in these and some other ways, we are confined to a certain time: If
therefore to the former requisits we shall add an Altitude, this Artifice may
be performed at any convenient appearance of a Planet or Star, as we shall by
and by show.

And for the more easy and certain obtaining of the variation at Sea, I would
advise the Seaman to extend or prolong the capital of his Needle, or fix some
style on it, so that it may cut the Fly at right Angles, for then the Compass
coverted to the Sun, this style will readily shadow out the Azimuth
Magneticall, and comparing it with that of the Sun, he has the variation
near enough without any further labor or preparation.

Thus hitherto (according to the Tenants of all our Magneticall Philosophers)
we have supposed the variations of all particular places to continue one and
the same: So that when a Seaman shall happly return to a place where formerly
he found the same variation, he may hence conclude, he is in the same former
Longitude. For it is the Assertion of Mr. Dr. Gilberts. Variatio v^icuiusque
Loci constans est, that is to say, the same place does always retain the same
variation. Neither has this Assertion (for ought I ever heard) been questioned
by any man. But most diligent magneticall observations have plainly offered
violence to the same, and proved the contrary, namely that the variation is
accompanied with a variation. For whereas in the year 1580 Mr. Burrows (a man
of unquestionable abilities in the Mathematiques) found the variation at
Limhouse near London to be 11 gr. 15 min. or near one point of the Compass;
In the year 1622 Mr. Gunter sometimes professor of Astronomy in Gresham
College, found the variation in the same place to be but 6 gr. 13 min. And my
self this present year 1634 with some friends had recourse to Dedpford (where
Mr. Gunter had heretofore made the same observations with those at Limehouse)
and found it not much to exceed 4 degrees.

For the clearer manifestation of this truth, (because all men have not been
furnished with or seen the fore said observations, I hold it necessary to
transfer theirs hither, and subnect those which were lately made by my self
with the assistance of some friends.

Mr. Burrowes his observations made at Limehouse October. 16. 1580.

The way of finding the variation after this manner is easy to be conceived. A
time being chosen when the Heavens were like to be unmasked for the whole day,
the altitudes of the Sun were taken by him to each degree of a Quadrant both
forenoone and Afternoon, from 17 to 25 gr. making nine several observations.
And at every Altitude turning his Needle to the Sunn, observed the degree and
parts cut thereby. Then comparing the Magneticall Azimuthes made in the
Forenoone, with those in the Afternoon answerable to the same Solar altitudes,
the half of the difference is the variation. Thus at the altitude of 17 gr. in
the Forenoone, the Needle cutting 52 gr. 35 min. and at the same altitude in
the Afternoon 30 gr. 0 min: the difference is 22 gr. 35 min: the half whereof
is 11 gr. 17 min: 30 Sec. the variation inquired.

Before we proceed to other Observations it will be requisite we take a review
of these, and after correction of some of the apparent Altitudes, call the
Solar Azimuthes to the Judicature of a Triangle.

It is not unknown that about this time of Mr. Burrowes his observations the
accurate and corrected tables of the Suns motion were not published to the
world, Neither the Angles of the Obliquity and Paralaxes of the Sun so truly
determined. And as for the refraction (which insinuates it self in every
Altitude not exceeding 45 degrees) being then in its infancy and a stranger to
the world it was not called into the account, no not by the Ancients
themselves, nor limited before that great Astronomer and honorable Dane Tyche
Brahe opened the same way. If therefore we shall examine these Altitudes
acording to the late corrected grounds, we shall somewhat alter the variations
of Mr. Burrowes, but so as that we shall not much differ from him, or suspect
any great error in his work.

These observations then of his, were made the 16 of October Anno 1580. And by
Astronomicall Calculation should begin about 9 in the Morning, and end about 2
in the Afternoon. Let us now make choice of the Magneticall Azimuthes
answerable to the Altitudes of 20 gr. being the fourth observation. The true
place of the Sun about this time correspondent to this Altitude according to
the late Rud^lphins Tables, (with consideration to the difference of Meridians
and Equation of Time) is thus found after the Centesimall way with the
connection of our British Logarithmes, but with some alteration of the Anomalies

but less after Noone, where the deflection is Easterly as here with us in
England and the adjacent parts. But the Magneticall azimuth is altogether found
by isntrumental observation, the Solar by Calculation or the resolution of the
obliquangular sphaericall Triangle PZS, whose sides are already known, and
therefore the Angle PZS may be obtained by the fourth compend of the last
chapter of the British Trigonometry after this manner.

The like may we do with the same Altitude for the Afternoon, if we shall
only rectify the declination answerable to the Suns motion for the internal
of time. The Suns true place was in 3179445 of the declination correspondent
was 1261740. Then in the adjacent diagram, being the same with the former, save
only that the magneticall Azimuth CZS is (as it ought to be) greater then the
Solar PZS, we have the same terms given, and therefore by resolving the
Triangle PZS, the angle inquired PZS may be found either by the former or the
third variety belonging to the 11 Problem of the same book, and agreeing as
well with the Calculation of a Plane Triangle as of a Sphaericall, after this
manner.

which converted into sexagesmes, is 11 gr. 32 min. 28: sec. And if with this
we compare the morning variation, (which should have been the same with the
afternoones) the difference will be 32 min: 28 sec: which may easily arise
either from the Insufficiency or Fabrique or gross handling of the
Instruments. So that if we take the Arithmeticall mean, we may probably
conclude the variation answerable to his time to be about 11 gr. 16 min: with
which very near concurreth Dr. Gilbert, finding it 11 gr. 20 min.

From these we proceed to Mr. Gunters Observations, the Table whereof we have
here inserted, as we find them in his mathematical works, where we see the
variation not to exceed 6 gr. 13 min. His instruments were one Quadrant of
three foot Radius for the Suns Altitudes: His Needles were two, the one of
six, the other of 10 Inches in length. The Suns Azimuthes were found by
calculation, and the Azimuthes Magneticall, taken off a Horizontall Plane by a
line of Chordes, whose Semidiameter was twelve Inches.

Thus have we prooved that for the Interstice of 42 years, there has been an
evident diminution of five, degrees variation. I deny not the Artifice to be
very nice and subtle, and that an error may unawares easily insinuate it self,
which together with this great discrepance, moved some of us to be overhasty in
casting an aspersion of error on Mr. Burrows observations, Mr. John Mar.
(though since upon noe just grounds) till an acquaintance of ours, lately
applying Mr. Gunters own Needle to the side of the Cubicall Stone of his
Majesty's Dial in White Hall garden, could not find the variation so great as
6 gr. 15 min: formerly found; whereupon resolving with some friends to make an
experiment hereof, we went to Diepford the last year 1633 the day of the
Suns entrance into the summer Solstice, to the very same place where Mr.
Gunter heretofore had made observation, and found it much less then five
degrees; And afterward calling into Question the Insufficiency of our
Instruments, that all scruple might be quite taken away, we had recourse this
present year 1634 Ioh. 12. stilo vet: to the same Garden of our learned and
ingenuous friend Mr. John Wells, with a Quadrant of six foot Radius for solar
Altitudes, continually rectified with great care, and a Horizontall Quadrant of
two foot Radius, for the determining of the Magneticall Azimuthes, exactly set
to the Magneticall meridian, and in paralellisme to the Horizon; (otherwise
great error might ensue) with two Needles of twelve Inches in length well
touched with good Magnetts; And for the better satisfaction, took with us also
the very same Needle wherewith Mr. Gunter made the foresaid observations, in
length ten Inches; all three must, accurately respecting the same Magneticall
Meridian as we then proved. And least there might arise some diversity in the
variation through the touches of several Stones, I caused the one Needle first
touched by a very good Magnet, to be retouch't by another as good if no better,
and the same wherewith most of our zea compastes are touched, and yet found no
difference between them. And so June the 14. 1634* we made these following
observations, where we found the variation not to exceed 4 gr. 10 min. as
appears by the Table annexed.

And because in the Resolutions of these obliquangular sphaericall Triangles
for the Solar Azimuthes we have necessary use of the Latitude of the Place, the
same we determine by the Suns meridian Altitude to be 51 gr. 30 min. after
this manner.

These Concordant Observations can not produce a variation greater then 4 gr.
12 min. nor less then 3 gr. 55 min. the Arithmeticall mean limiting it to 4
gr. and about 4 minutes.

And for a further confirmation hereof (though moved upon no just reason to
suspect these observations, being every way as cautelous in them as possible we
could) as soon as the intermission from my public Exercise would permit, I
caused the same instruments to be transported to Paul's Cray in Kent, distant
from London SE and by S about 12 miles, where the fourth of July following (
Fide Astronimica) I made the subsequent animadversions, hardly amounting to 4
degrees.

The Latitude of the Place I find by the same large Quadrant to be 51 gr. 25

It were needless having so many sufficient testimonies, to produce any more;
one only observation made with circumspection being as good as one hundredth.
So that its plain, the observations made in this place do all make the
variation to fall near upon 4 degrees.

Hence therefore we may conclude that for the space of 54 years (the
difference of time between Mr. Burrowes and these last observations of ours)
there has been a sensible diminution of 7 degrees and better.

If any affected with magneticall Philosophy shall yet desire to see an
experiment made for their own particular satisfaction, where I may prevail, I
would advise them to pitch a fair stone parallel to the Horizon there to rest
immovable, and having a Needle of a convenient length strongly touched by a
vigorous Magnet to draw a Magneticall Meridian thereby, and yearly to examine
by the application of the same (well preserved from the air and rust, its
greatest enemies) whether time will produce the like alteration.

I will not here enter into a dispute concerning the cause of this sensible
diminution, whether it may be imputed to the Magnet, or the Earth, or both. It
is not unknown to the world, how the Greatest Masters of Astronomy, which
this age has afforded, for the more easy salving the apparent anomalar motions
of the fixed and erratique caelestiall lights, and avoiding that supervacaneous
furniture of the Ancients, do with all alacrity embrace that admirable
Copernicean Hypothesis of the diurnal, Annual, and Secular motions of the
earth, in so much as conferring with that Great Astronomer D. Phil. Lansberg.
in Zealand about Astronomicall matters, did most seriously affirm unto me, he
should never be dissuaded from that Truth. This which he was pleased to style a
truth, I should readily receive as an Hypothesis, and so be easily led on to
the consideration of the imbecility of Man's apprehension, as not able rightly
to conceive of this admirable opifice of God or frame of the world, without
falling foul on so great an absurdity. Yet sure I am, it is a probable
inducement to shake a wavering understanding. And which adds somewhat more, I
understand by Galilaeus a Florentine, and a most acute and learned
Mathematician, that an Italian Gentleman of the Family of the Marsilii has
lately found the mutation of the Terrestrial Meridians, and penned a treatise
thereof not yet published, which the said Galilaeus has seen and read
constupore, not without amazement. His words are these.

Surge di present una quinta novita, dalle quale si possa arguir mobilita nel
globo terrestre, mediante quello, che sottilissimamente va scoprendo l'
illustrissimo S. Caesare della nobilissima famiglia de i Marsilij di Bologna,
pur' Academico Linceo, il quale in una dottissima scrittura va esponendo, come
ha osservato una continua mutazione, benche tardissima, nella linea Meridiana;
della quale scrittura, da me ultimamente con stupore veduta, spero che douera
fare coppia a tutti gli studio si delle maraviglie della natura.

Which in English runs thus.

Now there arises a fifth noveltie, from which we may argue the mobility of the
tererestriall Globe, by the means of that which most subtllie the most
mustruous Gentleman Sig: Caesar of the most noble family of the Marsilij of
Bologna a Lyncean Academicke also, has discovered, who in a most learned tract
plainly shows how he has observed a continual mutation, although very
slow, in the Meridian line; which discourse, which with wonder I lately saw, I
hope he will impart to all those who are Studious of the wonders of nature.

Surely if it be so, the due consideration of the premises does (as I
conceive) lay open a fair way for the salving of that Irregular Motion imputed
to the Axis of the Earth. I mean the alterable Obliquity of the Ecliptique,
which to deny (as some yet do, not without great violence offered to the
Ancients) I shall hardly (without very strong argument) be persuaded. I
pretermit likewise a suppofition which might be made of the correspondent
motion of the Pole of the Magnet with those of some of the Planets, and diverse
other conceits, which must be all left to future times to discover, this
Invention being but newly presented to the world in its infancy.
