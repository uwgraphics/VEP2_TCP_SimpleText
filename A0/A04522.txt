than he thought in himself that he came to treat with him for some patyse or
for some peace / but he swear his law yt little or naught he should entrete
him. Than to se up the gyaunt and took an horrible gre +e clubbe in his hands
/ which any man had enough to do to lift it up fro the ground / and so he
came against Geffray and cried to him with a hye voice. What art thou that
dare come so boldly toward me in arms / by my law well shall thou be
paid therefore / for who that sends ye hither would have the deed. And
Geffray cried to him I defyethe defend thou thy self if thou can. And with
these words Geffray touched his spear and spored his horse with the spores and
ran and smote the gyaunt in the breast so myghtely that he ouerthrewe him the
legs upward / And anon geffray descended fro his horse ferynge that the
gyaunte should slay him And than the gyaunt came toward geffray / but almost
he could not perceive hy^ he was so little of stature to the regard of him /
and when he was nyghe him he said to him. Say me thou little body who art thou
that so valiauntly have overthrown me / by mahounde I shall never have
ho(...)nen.

Right as the gyaunt understood yt he was much abashed, for well he wist that
he might not be slain but by Geffrays hands / not that withstondy^ge he
answered to him. I know the well enough / thou slew that other day my cosyn
Guedon in Guerrende / all the deuylles of hell has well brought the hither /
And Geffray him answered / no doubt but I shall slay the if I may. And when
the gyaunt understood it he haunced his clubbe and would have dyscharged it
upon Geffrays heed / but he faylled. And then Geffray smote him upon the
sholdre so yt the blood ran down And when he felt that stroke he began to
cry and said / cursed be that arm that so can smite / and hanged be the smyth
that forged that (...)e and then with his clubbe he wend (...) (...) (...)
^^ue smyten Geffray / but Geffray fle(...)e stroke / for if he had attained him
(...) slain him / and the clubbe entered a (...) in to the earth / but or ever
the gyau(...) haunced his clubbe Geffray smote (...) his sword so that he made
it to fle(...) of his hands / and therewith he cut (...)te piece of it.

How the gyaunt fled and geffr^^ ^^lowed him. Ca.


ANd than was the gyaunt right dolant and abashed when he saw his clubbe cut
lyenge on the ground / for he durst not bow himself to take it up Than he
lept on Geffray and stroke him with his (...)t on the helmet so that Geffray was
a(...)ost astonyed / but Geffray smote the ^^^^nt upon the thye so that he cut
a gre(...) (...)ce of it. And when the gyaunt saw (...) thus hurt he fled
and entered in to (...)le of the mountain / whereof geffray (...) much
abashed. Than came geffray (...)e hoole and looked in / but it was so ob(...)e
and so deep that he saw nor wyste ^^ere the gyaunt was become. And he
re(...)ned and mounted upon his horse and (...)cended in to the valeye and came
to his (...)yne which had great meruayll when (...) saw him return hoole
and sound (...) especyall the two knights wondered much and were abashed of
it. And they asked him if he had seen the gyaunt / and he said to them I have
fought with him red ye / and than they said it was for naught to seek him /
for well he wist that he should deye by the hands of Geffray doubt you not
said Geffray for well I know where he is entered in / and to morn with gods
help I shall find him well. And when they herd geffray speak so they had
great Joye and said that Geffray was the most valiant knight of the world.

How Geffray went and entered in to ye hoole for to fight with the gyaunt.
lxviii.
UPon ye morrow by times geffray armed him and mounted upon his horse and rode
till he came to the said hoole / and alyght and with his sword in his hand
fair and softely let himself fall in to the hole. And when he was in the
botom of it he perceived some light and saw a little pathe / and than he made
the sign of the cross in his foreheed and went for the that way.

How Geffray found the sepulture of ye king of Albanye his graundfader
Helynas within the mountain. ca. lxix.
When Geffray was therein he had not gone far when he found a rich chamber
where as were gr(...)

(...) How Geffray was the death of the earl of Forestz his uncle. Ca. lxxi.
SO long rode Geffray that he came to the castle and alyghted / and went in
to the halle where he found the earl among his barons. And than he cried with
a hye voice. To death traytoure for thrughe the we have lost our mother / and
with his naked sword went toward the earl. And the earl* which knew well
his fyersnes fled in to a chamber / and geffray followed him / and so long
chased hy^ from chamber to chamber to ye highest part of the toure where he saw
he might no ferder flee / he took a wyndowe and supposed to have passed unto a
toure nygh / but his fete faylled and he fell down and broke his neck. When
Geffray saw that he came down in to the halle / but there was none so hardy to
say one word against hy^ And he them commanded that his uncle should be
buried / and so he was and his obsequye done. And after that Geffray recounted
to the barons why he would have slain his uncle / and because of the earls
mysdede and falls report they were somewhat peased. And Geffray made them do
ho^mage to Raymond his brother. And here cesseth thystorye of him / and speaks
of Raymondyn his fader.

NOw says thystorye that sone after this was showed to Raymondyn whereof he
was right dolant and sorrowful but he sone forgate it / byca^se that his brother
had announced him (...) tidings whereby he lost his wife (...) said to
himself this that is do may(...)ne otherwise I must pease Geffra^ (...) do any
more do^mage. And therefore (...)te word to him by his brother Theod(...) that
he should come toward him at Lusygnen / and Geffray came to his fader at his
maundement / and knelynge asked him mercy and pardon saying. My right
redoubted lord and fader I beseech you o^ forgyuenes / and I swear you that I
shall do make again thabbaye of Maylleres fayrer than ever it was tofore / and
found ten monks more than there was before. By god said Raymondyn all that
may be do with the help of god / but to the deed folk ye may not restore their
life. But Geffray it is truth that I must go to a pilgrimage that I have
auowed / and therefore I shall leave you the governance of my land / and if by
adventure god did his will of me all the land is yours. But I will and charge
you to fulfill the last will of your mother / and he granted thereto.

THis done Raimondin made his apparayll and with him mounted on horsbacke many
lords and knights and took with him great fynaunce / and rode forth on his
way. And Geffray and theodoryk conuayed him till he badde them (...) fine
gold and of the richesse of the place and of ye figure of queen pressyne that
stood up right and held a table of gold / and of that which was there written
/ and how their three daughters were predestined / of the which said Geffray
our mother was (...) of them / and wete it well that Raymon (...) ^erkened him
gladly / and was well (...)ed. And than he gave license to his (...)en to
return / and so they did / and ^^^^ondyn held on his way toward (...)e /
and to Theodoryk he gave ye ryng which Melusyne gave him at her departing fro
him.

How Raymondyn came toward the pope of Rome and confessed his sins to him.
Ca. lxxiii.
HEre says thystorye that Raymondin rode so long that he came to Rome and his
company with him where he found the pope named benedicte and drew him toward
him to whom humbly he made reverence and sith kneled tofore him and confessed
his misdedes and sins in his best wise / And as touching this that he was
forsworn against god and Melusyne his wife the pope enjoined him lauful
penance. And that same day Raymondyn dyned with the pope / and on the morn
he yede and vysyted the holy places there. And when he had done there all
that he must do he took le(...) is at Mounferrat in Aragon a (...) and holy
place / and there would I feign be. My fair sone said the pope so it is said.
And to him said Raymondyn fader in god my entencion is to go thither and to
yield my self there hermyte for to pray god that it please him to give
allegeaunce to my lady my wife. Now fair sone said ye pope with the holy ghost
may ye go / and al yt ye shall do with good will I remysse it to your penance.
And thanne Raymondyn kneled and kyssed the popes fete / and the pope gave him
his benedyecyon. Then Raymondyn departed and rode so long till he came to
Thoulouse / and there he gave license to all his meyne to depart and return
except only a chapelayne and a clerk that he took with him / and well and
truly he paid every one so that they were content / but sorry they were all
of their master that so departed fro them / and he sent lettres to Geffray and
to the barons of his land that they should do their hommage to his sone
Geffray and receive hy^ for their lord. And his meyne took ye lettres and so
they departed fro their lord with great sorrow and heaviness / for he never
told them what way he should take but wete it he had with him goods enough
/ and did so much that he came to Nerbonne where he rested him a little space
of ^yme

HEre shows the hystorye yt when Raymondin was come to Nerbon he did do make
many hermyte habytes*
